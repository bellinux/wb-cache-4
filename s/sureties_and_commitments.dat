40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{the institutions of}} <b>sureties</b> <b>and</b> guarantees of the Treasury resulting to the obligations related from the issuance of bonds, indicating the grounds for substantive of these institutions, rules for granting the above-mentioned <b>sureties</b> <b>and</b> guarantees and objectives to achieve. A {{significant part of the}} study was devoted to discussion of the information concerning the practical application of these institutions. The author concludes that guarantees <b>and</b> <b>sureties</b> granted by the Treasury are an important and practical instrument of public finances, which are used to the economic development of the state. The main areas supported by these legal solutions are focused around the development and maintenance of infrastructure. It must be said that these institutions must not be misused in the Polish legal system, because they can cause an increase in public debt and undermine the credibility of the state...|$|R
25|$|In what {{is thought}} to be an archaic {{survival}} in some versions of Iorwerth it is stated that women are not entitled to act as sureties or to give sureties. Later versions of this rule in Iorwerth state that women were entitled to give <b>sureties,</b> <b>and</b> could therefore enter into contracts, though they were still not allowed to act as sureties. In Colan, Cyfnerth and some of the Latin texts women could give <b>sureties</b> <b>and</b> could under certain circumstances act as sureties. This appears to indicate a gradual improvement in the legal position of women in this respect.|$|R

There is no privity of contract between a <b>surety</b> <b>and</b> the principal debtor. Rather, the surety contracts with the creditor and is not jointly liable to the creditor.|$|R
