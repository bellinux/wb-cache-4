5|$|One of {{the major}} {{legacies}} of colonial rule in Kasai was the arbitrary redivision of the population into new ethnic groups. Despite the shared language (Tshiluba) {{and culture of the}} two groups, colonial administrators believed the inhabitants of the Lulua river area to be ethnically different from the Baluba and dubbed them the Bena Lulua. The colonists believed the Baluba to be more intelligent, hardworking and open to new ideas than the Bena Lulua who were believed to be more reactionary and <b>stupid.</b> <b>As</b> a result, from the 1930s, the state began to treat the two groups differently and applied different policies to each and promoted the Baluba to positions above other ethnicities.|$|E

25|$|Just over a {{year after}} signing with the WWF, the Legion of Doom won the WWF World Tag Team Titles from The Nasty Boys at SummerSlam 1991 and held them for about six months. When they lost the titles in February 1992 they were briefly taken off television, only to return with long-time manager Paul Ellering by their side, {{as well as a}} wooden dummy called “Rocco”. Both members of the L.O.D. thought the gimmick was <b>stupid,</b> <b>as</b> did most of the fans and it led to Hawk quitting the WWF, leaving Animal on his own {{for the first time in}} 9 years. When Animal {{suffered}} a severe back injury a short while later, everyone thought it was the end of the legendary team.|$|E
25|$|If {{you wish}} you may tell the police {{to be careful not}} to rile me. Of course, I am a {{reasonable}} spirit. I take no offense at the way they have conducted their investigations in the past. In fact, they have been so utterly <b>stupid</b> <b>as</b> to not only amuse me, but His Satanic Majesty, Francis Josef, etc. But tell them to beware. Let them not try to discover what I am, for it were better that they were never born than to incur the wrath of the Axeman. I don't think there is any need of such a warning, for I feel sure the police will always dodge me, as they have in the past. They are wise and know how to keep away from all harm.|$|E

500|$|... "Deep Space Homer" [...] {{was written}} by then-executive {{producer}} David Mirkin. Mirkin had worked on {{the idea for the}} episode for a long time, basing the story on NASA's Teacher in Space Project to send ordinary civilians into space in order to spark interest amongst the general public. There was some controversy amongst the show's writing staff during production. Some of the writers felt that having Homer go into space was too large an idea. Matt Groening felt that the idea was so big that it gave the writers [...] "nowhere to go". Several silly gags were therefore toned down to make the episode feel more realistic, including an idea that everyone at NASA was as <b>stupid</b> <b>as</b> Homer. The writers focused more upon the relationship between Homer and his family and Homer's attempts to be a hero.|$|E

500|$|Awards that I Not Stupid won include Best Chinese Film at the Golden Bauhinia Awards and Best Chinese Humanitarian Film at the 2002 Taiwan Golden Torch Awards; {{the movie}} was also {{nominated}} for Best Asian Film at the Hong Kong Film Awards, losing to My Sassy Girl. Critics praised the film for its humour and uniqueness, noting that it touched a raw nerve among Singaporeans. For example, Sanjuro of LoveHKFilm.com wrote, [...] "I Not Stupid covers a variety of serious subjects, but all the while maintains a light comedic touch. Jack Neo [...] a clever, well-crafted social commentary and a damn good film to boot." [...] Other reviewers described I Not <b>Stupid</b> <b>as</b> [...] "one of the greatest cinematic feats I’ve {{had the pleasure of}} experiencing" [...] and displaying a [...] "simple and yet excellent execution". In contrast, FilmAsia reviewer Soh Yun-Huei, found it [...] "most shocking...that the Singapore censors actually allowed this film through in the first place".|$|E
500|$|The {{next day}} Kenny rejoins his friends, who are {{dressed up for}} a Halloween costume contest. Stan is dressed as Raggedy Andy (since Wendy would be going as Raggedy Ann, thus making a pair), Kyle wears a Chewbacca mask, and Cartman is dressed as Adolf Hitler, much to the fury of Kyle, who is Jewish. A zombified Kenny joins the boys, but they fail to notice {{that he is a}} zombie. At school, Kyle gets more annoyed after {{discovering}} that the other students (as well as Mr. Hat) are also dressed as Chewbacca, while Mr. Garrison is dressed as Marilyn Monroe. Worst of all, Wendy is dressed as Chewbacca; she explains that she changed costumes because they would have looked <b>stupid</b> <b>as</b> the Raggedy couple and she figured Stan would realize it too. A stubborn Kyle decides to make a new costume so he can win the prize, two tons of candy. Both Chef (dressed as Evel Knievel) and Principal Victoria are annoyed to see Cartman dressed as Hitler. Victoria makes him a [...] "ghost" [...] costume but he ends up looking more like a Ku Klux Klan member, which annoys Chef even more. At the contest, which is judged by Tina Yothers, Wendy (despite wearing the same costume as the other students) wins the candy, much to the fury of Kyle, who is now dressed as the Solar System. Stan wins the worst costume and everyone laughs at him, leaving him humiliated.|$|E
500|$|The season five episode [...] "Deep Space Homer", {{in which}} the {{characters}} Homer and Barney are recruited by NASA, is Mirkin's first writing credit on The Simpsons, the second being [...] "The Man Who Came to Be Dinner", which was co-written with Al Jean. Mirkin worked on the concept for a long time, basing the story on NASA's Teacher in Space Project scheme to send ordinary civilians into space in order to spark interest amongst the general public. The idea proved controversial {{to some of the}} show's writing staff, who felt that having Homer go into space was too [...] "large" [...] an idea. Series creator Matt Groening felt that the idea gave the writers [...] "nowhere to go". Based on these attitudes, several jokes were toned down to make the episode feel more realistic, including the impression that everyone at NASA was as <b>stupid</b> <b>as</b> Homer. During re-writes, Mirkin and the other writers placed greater emphasis on the relationship between Homer and his family and on Homer's attempts to be a hero, but most of Mirkin's original script was retained. The episode {{is considered one of the}} show's best. Colin Kennedy of Empire magazine named it a [...] "contender for greatest ever episode", and in Chris Turner's book, Planet Simpson, he says the episode is [...] "second to none". Regarding the long sequence that begins with Homer eating potato chips in the space shuttle and ends with Kent Brockman's dramatic speech, Turner claimed that it was [...] "simply among the finest comedic moments in the history of television". A copy of the episode was later sent to the International Space Station for astronauts to view. Mirkin considers the episode to be [...] "very very special". Ortved says the episode, in its plot and surreal humor, epitomizes Mirkin's era.|$|E
