Two such samples were inserted into the next line <b>synchronising</b> <b>pulse.</b> At the destination, the audio samples were converted back to analogue form and the video waveform restored to normal. Compandors operating on the signal before encoding and after decoding enabled the required signal-to-noise ratio to be achieved. As the PCM noise was predominantly high-pitched, the compandor only needed to operate on the high frequencies. Also, the compandor only operated at high audio levels, so that modulation of the noise by the companding would be masked by the relatively loud high-frequency audio components. A pilot tone at half the sampling frequency was transmitted to enable the expander to track the gain adjustment applied by the compressor, even when the latter was limiting.|$|E

In vestigial sideband, the full upper sideband of bandwidth W2 = 4.75MHz is transmitted, but only W1 = 1.25MHz of the lower sideband is transmitted, along with a carrier.

30|$|Our method {{not only}} {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} generating accurately synchronised video signals in a simple and very economical way, but also avoids the need for transferring frame or line <b>synchronising</b> <b>pulses</b> between cameras. This avoids the delays associated with the transmission of such pulses making it applicable to systems requiring ultra-high speed operation without posing any serious restrictions on the relative positioning of the cameras. Much higher frames rates can be realistically achieved this way. In addition, the high precision synchronisation afforded by our method allows the aggregation of multivision cameras into a system that mimics a multi-tap camera. This allows the combined and faithful transmission of the outputs of several cameras over a single Camera-Link® connection over substantial distances. The method presented here extends, without violating, the provisions for multi-tap video, as {{laid out in the}} Camera-Link® specification. This method also avoids the need for a “store and forward” mechanism and hence does not incur any of the cost, complexity and latency associated with the internal buffering used in other methods.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. There is {{a growing}} need to {{introduce}} and develop computa-tional models capable of faithfully modelling systems whose behaviour combines synchrony with asynchrony {{in a variety of}} complicated ways. Examples of such real-life systems can be found from VLSI hardware GALS systems to systems of cells within which biochemical reactions happen in <b>synchronised</b> <b>pulses.</b> One way of capturing the resulting intri-cate behaviours is to use Petri nets with localities where transitions are partitioned into disjoint groups within which execution is synchronous and maximally concurrent. In this paper, we generalise this type of nets by allowing each transition to belong to several localities. Moreover, we define this extension in a generic way for all classes of nets defined by net-types. We show that Petri nets with overlapping localities are an in-stance of the general model of nets with policies. Thanks to this fact, it is possible to automatically construct nets with localities from behavioural specifications given in terms of finite step transition systems. After that we outline our initial ideas concerning net synthesis when the association of transition to localities is not given and has to be determined by the synthesis algorithm...|$|R

The large-scale logistics required for these mass immunisation campaigns magnifies the need for research into the effectiveness and optimal deployment of pulse vaccination. In order to better understand this control strategy, we propose a mathematical model accounting for the disease dynamics in connected regions, incorporating seasonality, environmental reservoirs and independent periodic pulse vaccination schedules in each region. The effective reproduction number, $R_e$, is defined and {{proved to be a}} global threshold for persistence of the disease. Analytical and numerical calculations show the importance of <b>synchronising</b> the <b>pulse</b> vaccinations in connected regions and the timing of the pulses with respect to the pathogen circulation seasonality. Our results indicate that it may be crucial for mass-vaccination programs, such as national immunisation days, to be synchronised across different regions. In addition, simulations show that a migration imbalance can increase $R_e$ and alter how pulse vaccination should be optimally distributed among the patches, similar to results found with constant-rate vaccination. Furthermore, contrary to the case of constant-rate vaccination, the fraction of environmental transmission affects the value of $R_e$ when pulse vaccination is present.

40|$|The {{development}} of solid-state switches for pulsed power applications {{has been of}} considerable interest since high-power semiconductor devices became available. However, the use of solid-state devices in the pulsed power environment has usually been restricted by device limitations in either their voltage/current ratings or their switching speed. The stacking of fast medium-voltage devices, such as IGBTs, to improve the voitage rating, makes solid-state switches a potential substitute for conventional switches such as hard glass tubes, thyratrons and spark gaps. Previous. studies into stacking IGBTs have been concerned with specific devices, designed or modified particularly fcir a specific application. The present study is concerned with stacking. fast and commercially available IGBTs and their application to the generation of pulsed electric field and the switching of a high intensity Xenon flashlamp. The aim ofthe first section {{of the present study}} was to investigate different solid-state switching devices with a stacking capability and this led to the choice of the Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT). It was found that the collector-emitter voltage decreases in two stages in most of the available IGBTs. Experiments and simulation showed that a reason for this behaviour could be fast variations in device parasitic parameters particularly gate-collector capacitance. Choosing theÃ‚Â· proper IGBT, as well as dealing with problems such as unbalanced voltage and current sharing, are important aspects of stacking and these were reported in this study. Dynamic and steady state voltage imbalances caused by gate driver delay was controlled using an array of <b>synchronised</b> <b>pulses,</b> isolated with magnetic and optical coupling. The design procedure for pulse transformers, optical' modules, the drive circuits required to minimise possible jitter and time delays, and over-voltage protection ofIGBT modules are also important aspects of stacking, and were reported in this study. The second purpose of this study was to investigate the switching performance of both magnetically coupled and optically coupled stacks, in pulse power applications such as Pulse Electric Field (PEF). inactivation of microorganisms and UV light inactivation of food-related pathogenic bacteria. The stack, consisting of 50. 1. 2 kV !GBTs with the voltage and current capabilities of 10 kV, 400 A, was incorporated into a coaxial cable Blumlein type pulse generator and its performance was successfully tested with both magnetic and optical coupling. As a second application of the switch, a fully integrated solid-state Marx generator was designed and assembled to drive a UV flashlamp for the purpose of microbiological inactivation. The generator has an output voltage rating of 3 kV and a peak current rating of 2 kA, although the modular approach taken allows for a number of voltage and current ratings to be achieved. The performance of the switch was successfully tested over a period of more than 106 pulses when it was applied to pulse a xenon flashlamp.

The investigation has been carried out by drift mobility techniques which represent a very direct and essentially new approach {{to the study of the}} acoustoelectrie interaction. In the experiments highly resistive thin platelet crystals were fitted with evaporated metal electrodes on opposite faces, and a fast electron or light pulse generated electron-hole pairs in a narrow region below the top electrode. A <b>synchronised</b> field <b>pulse</b> drew thin space charge layer of one type of carrier out of this region and the transit time and drift velocity were obtained directly; it was thus possible to study the acoustoelectric interaction during a single transit. The field dependence of the electron drift velocity was studied in CdS with the applied field parallel and perpendicular to the c-axis, and in both cubic and hexagonal ZnS specimens. In all cases a sharp discontinuity in the slope of the graph occurred at a critical drift velocity vd', which agreed with the piezoelectric sound velocity in the particular crystallographic direction. A clear distinction between the longitudinal and shear wave interactions could be made. In CdS the interaction for both electrons and holes was observed. The drift velocity measurements have been checked by transient current pulse experiments. The effect of shallow trapping on the acoustoelectric interaction has been investigated by drift velocity experiments at lower temperatures. It is found in all cases that the interaction disappeared when the drift mobility was reduced to about 0. 38 of the lattice mobility. The interesting result of all these experiments was the surprisingly strong interaction between the drifting carriers and the piezoelectric modes. This was found to build up within a fraction of a transit time, certainly in less than 20 nsecs. The possible meohanisms to explain this strong interaction are discussed and it is concluded that the non-uniform excitation is at least partly responsible. The results of some preliminary ultrasonic measurements indicate that the stress wave associated with the excitation pulse may be amplified in a region close to the top electrode...|$|R

QWs of the alloy material InGaN exhibit a dependence of the exciton dimensionality on the thermal energy available. It was demonstrated that this dependence in uences the rate for uorescence resonant energy transfer from the QW to a layer of CdS-NC deposited on top of its capping layer. Investigations of different capping layer thicknesses demonstrated the dependence of the exciton dimensionality on the disorder potential of the QW. Furthermore, spectroscopic measurements of elongated asymmetric cadmium selenide/- cadmium sulfide CdSe/CdS nanorods (NR) under the application of external magnetic and electric fields are discussed. Asymmetric CdSe/CdS-NR represent a special case of elongated NR as the analytical treatment of spherical NC can be combined with numerical methods of calculating the electron and hole energies and wave functions. The results for the excitonic fine structure splitting in these nanomaterials is used to explain the dependence of the exciton dynamics under an external magnetic field.

40|$|Worldwide ophthalmologists are daily {{confronted with}} eye {{diseases}} {{as a result}} of cardiovascular diseases with associated deterioration of the eye blood circulation (for example systemic arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, peripheral arterial disease and many more). Even in the pathogenesis of glaucoma the blood circulation of the eye or the optic nerve head plays an equally important role as the intraocular pressure. As with pressure in the systemic circulation, pressure and blood flow conditions in the eye are also dynamic variables: The eye pressure rises and falls simultaneously with the heart's rhythm, and presents itself quantitatively as systolic and diastolic pressure in the eye – the difference between the systolic and diastolic eye pressure is called the ocular pulse amplitude. A few years ago quantification of these <b>synchronised</b> <b>pulse</b> pressure fluctuations was not possible without much effort for examiner and patient. Since 2004 the PASCAL® dynamic contour tonometer has become available nationwide in Germany. For the first time the diastolic pressure in the eye and the ocular pulse amplitude are relatively simple to measure in a tolerable time frame for examiner and patient. A particular advantage of the modern PASCAL® System, compared with other previously existing tonometers, is it’s independence from corneal conditions. This means the real intraocular pressure can be measured non-invasive for the first time. However, the assessment of the ocular pulse amplitude proves to be problematic, because uniformly accepted standard values are not available. The aim of this study was primarily the creation of standard values for the ocular pulse amplitude, measured with the PASCAL® System. In addition, the mean difference of ocular pulse amplitude within a pair of eyes should be determined and the results of the dynamic contour tonometry should be investigated in relation to the factors which could influence them. With the acceptance of the ethics committee a healthy population of 208 subjects were recruited (m: f = 104 : 104) in the Schlosspark-Clinic Berlin. Statistics based on anamnestic data, blood pressure, pulse rate, visual acuity and refraction, ocular axis length, anterior chamber depth, corneal thickness/ radius, results of ophthalmologic function tests (motility, pupil reaction) and examinations of the anterior and posterior eye segments with the slit lamp, intraocular pressure measured by Goldmann applanation tonometry and ocular pressure and ocular pulse amplitude using PASCAL® dynamic contour tonometry. Our studies showed a mean difference in ocular pulse amplitude within a pair of eyes of 0. 12 ± 0. 04 mm Hg (mean value with confidence interval P = 95 %) with little gender difference (mean m: f = 0. 13 : 0. 10 mm Hg). Evaluations of other statistical data were carried out randomly according to statistic standards, so that in each case either a right or left eye was randomly chosen per person for the study. Due to a statistically significant “tonography effect” on the observed pressure data only the first value of a series of measurements from three measurements was used for the statistical analysis. The determined standard values show a significant gender difference (p = 0. 0129) with 2. 20 mm Hg for males (Prognosis range: 1. 09 mm Hg to 3. 91 mm Hg) and 2. 45 mm Hg for females (Prognosis range: 1. 05 mm Hg to 4. 81 mm Hg). The comparison between the raised intraocular pressure values with PASCAL® System and Goldmann applanation tonometry revealed an average difference of 0. 52 mm Hg (95 % CI: 0. 12 to 0. 92 mm Hg) for women and 1. 66 mm Hg (95 % CI: 1. 14 to 2. 17 mm Hg) for men. Within the framework of monofactorial analysis we found that there are for both sexes a negative correlation between ocular pulse amplitude and axial length and a positive correlation with the intraocular pressure. Regarding corneal thickness, astigmatism, corneal radius, age, systemic blood pressure, blood pressure amplitude and pulse rate in the monofactorial studies no correlation to ocular pulse amplitude could be found. Multifactorial analysis revealed that from all collected factors for the male sex the axial length in connection with pulse rate influences the ocular pulse amplitude, and for the female sex the axial length in connection with the raised eye pressure by applanation tonometry. Our results indicate that women and men need a differentiated view because of the significant differences. The measured variables only show a partial influence on the ocular pulse amplitude. Besides the genetic factor also hormonal differences and individual biomechanical properties of the eye {{play an important role in}} connection with the ocular pulse amplitude, which requires further investigations. In consideration of the sum of our results and the literature research, the PASCAL® dynamic contour tonometry is not just an alternative to applanation tonometry. Especially by its independence from the corneal thickness in a wide range, the data of the intraocular pressure is more precise, what is essential for the therapy and monitoring of glaucoma. Furthermore the ocular pulse amplitude can be measured in parallel with relatively little effort for examiner and patient, which is an additional advantage: The more than a century of glaucoma diagnosis ruling focus on the intraocular pressure alone is extended for each ophthalmologic practice. In addition, the ocular pulse amplitude also serves as a useful diagnostic criteria in the context of many other diseases that affect not only ocular but also the cerebral or systemic vascular system. However, until the measuring of ocular pulse amplitude is well established in clinical practice, even more extensive experiences and studies for better understanding of the dependent variables and specific changes by different diseases are needed...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{describes}} {{a new high}} precision measurement of the 1 S- 2 S transition frequency in muonium, carried out at the ISIS facility at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, using a solid-state laser system. The focus of the thesis is mainly the work carried out on the pulsed part of the laser system. The transition frequency {{is measured by the}} Doppler-free spectroscopy. The two-photon 1 S- 2 S transition is detected by observing the positive muon released after subsequent photo-ionisation from the 2 S state by a third photon from the same laser field. An accurate frequency standard for the experiment was provided by a Doppler-free transition in molecular iodine. A cw Ti:sapphire laser operating around 732 nm locked to this reference transition provided a stable output for injection seeding the pulsed alexandrite laser. This has been optimised and modified to achieve a stable operation in a single transverse and longitudinal mode. There were stringent requirements on the laser pulse timing relative to an external trigger in order to <b>synchronise</b> the laser <b>pulse</b> with the muon pulse from the ISIS facility. A method of cavity length stabilisation, which reduced the jitter of the laser from approximately 20 #mu#s to 100 ns and allowed us to trigger the laser externally, is described. This was performed in two stages using an intracavity, piezo-mounted, quartz plate and two fast, electro-optic modulators. The frequency chirp of the laser output, measured using a heterodyne technique to 1 MHz, was found to be of the order of 80 - 120 MHz for a 30 - 40 mJ output. This chirp was shown {{to be the result of}} a fast change of the refractive index in the alexandrite rods, and was found to be directly proportional to the population inversion change during the Q-switched pulse. A method of chirp compensation was developed leading to a reduction of the chirp by an order of magnitude i. e. to the level of 5 - 15 MHz. The alexandrite output was frequency tripled using LBO and BBO crystals with a conversion efficiency in excess of 10 %, yielding UV pulse energies of 3 to 6 mJ. The 1 S- 2 S transition frequency has been measured to be 2, 455, 528, 940. 99 (9. 75) (3. 5) MHz which is in agreement with the theoretical value of 2, 455, 528, 934. 61 (3. 44) MHz. Measurement of 1 S- 2 S interval in deuterium, performed primarily to study systematic errors, represents the best pulsed measurement to date and is in an agreement with values obtained with cw lasers.
