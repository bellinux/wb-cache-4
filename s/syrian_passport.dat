5000|$|On 3 September 2015, Alan Kurdi (3 years old), {{his brother}} Ghalib Kurdi (5 years old) {{and their mother}} drowned, as their family {{attempts}} to migrate by sea into Europe. The image of Alan Kurdi's body washed up on a Turkish beach becomes a seminal moment in the refugee crises and global response. National debates and media coverage about the Syrian refugee crises increase markedly, bringing considerable attention to the human costs of the Syrian Civil War, the responsibilities of host countries, pressures forcing refugees to migrate from their host countries, people smuggling, and the responsibilities of third countries to resettle refugees. During the same month, The Prime Minister of Hungary announced {{the construction of a}} border fence with Croatia to stop undocumented refugees from crossing into the country. Also in September, German customs seized packages of fake <b>Syrian</b> <b>passports</b> which police suspect are being sold to non-Syrians seeking asylum in Germany. [...] In October, the UN's human rights chief claims the Czech Republic is holding migrants in [...] "degrading" [...] and jail like conditions Also in October 2015, the European Commission proposed a large-scale refugee resettlement scheme to distribute up to 200,000 refugees among European countries, starting in 2016. By 21 December, an estimated 500,000 Syrian refugees have entered Europe, 80 percent arrived by sea, and most land in Greece. Some Syrian refugees have resorted to prostitution as a means of survival, particularly among women and girls.|$|R
50|$|Syrian President Bashar al-Assad blamed Europe and the United States for {{the migrant}} crisis, saying {{most of the}} {{refugees}} are fleeing the “terrorism” that he accuses the West of fomenting by supporting elements of the Syrian opposition. Meanwhile, the Syrian government announced increased military conscription, and simultaneously {{made it easier for}} <b>Syrians</b> to obtain <b>passports,</b> leading Middle East policy experts to speculate that he was implementing a policy to encourage opponents of his regime to leave the country.|$|R

However, he contracted malaria and remained in a guest house called Bait al-Ansar in Peshawar for a year before attending Sayyaf's camp, where'd he trained on an AK-47 with a group named Ittihad-i-Islami. He made three subsequent trips into Afghanistan {{to stay at the}} camps under Sayyaf's leadership, using his savings to finance the third trip.|$|E

He was discovered by his first manager and producer George Yazbeck at a wedding party that Wassouf was performing at, aged 12 years old. At the age of 16 he was called Sultan El-Tarab by the Lebanese journalist George Ibrahim El Khoury, a magazine director, Arabic for The Sultan of Music, with his classic song [...] "el-Hawa Sultan". He became famous after appearing on the Lebanese show Studio El Fan 1980 when he was 19 years old as Sultan of Tarab.|$|E
50|$|On 13 November 2015, {{as part of}} {{a series}} of Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) {{terrorist}} attacks across Paris, three gunmen who were French nationals of Algerian descent conducted a mass shooting at the Bataclan. An Austrian duo, the White Miles, had completed their performance, and the American rock band Eagles of Death Metal {{were in the midst of}} their performance when three gunmen wearing suicide belts entered the theatre, firing at people at random, and taking hostages. The police later stormed the theatre, and two gunmen killed themselves during the police raid by detonating suicide vests they were wearing; a third was killed by police gunfire before he could detonate his vest. Two of the attackers, Samy Amimour and Omar Ismaïl Mostefaï, were French citizens. The third attacker, Foued Mohamed-Aggad, was carrying what was thought to be a stolen <b>Syrian</b> <b>passport.</b> As a result of the attacks, 90 people were killed and over 200 were wounded.|$|E
5000|$|Another bomber {{carried a}} {{passport}} {{belonging to a}} 25-year-old Syrian named [...] "Ahmad al-Mohammad". A passport-holder claiming to be a Syrian refugee with that name was registered on Leros in October upon his arrival from Turkey. The dead attacker's fingerprints matched those taken at the registration on Leros. French officials concluded that [...] "Ahmad al-Mohammad" [...] is probably a dead <b>Syrian</b> soldier whose <b>passport</b> was stolen after {{he was killed in}} Syria. ISIS identified him as [...] "Ukasah al-Iraqi", indicating that he was from Iraq.|$|R
50|$|<b>Syrian</b> and Egyptian <b>passports</b> {{were found}} near {{the bodies of}} two of the {{perpetrators}} at two attack sites, but Egyptian authorities said the passport belonged to a victim, Aleed Abdel-Razzak, and not one of the perpetrators. By 16 November, the focus of the French and Belgian investigation turned to Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the radical jihadist they believed was the leader of the plot. Abaaoud, a Belgian of Berber-Moroccan origin, had escaped to Syria after having been suspected in other plots in Belgium and France, including the thwarted 2015 Thalys train attack. Abaaoud had recruited an extensive network of accomplices, including two brothers, Brahim Abdeslam and Salah Abdeslam, to execute terrorist attacks; Abaaoud was killed in the Saint-Denis raid on 18 November.|$|R
5000|$|At an October 28 {{hearing before}} U.S. District Judge Claude M. Hilton, Soueid pled not guilty. Hilton set the trial date at March 5, 2012 and {{reversed}} the magistrate judge's decision, ordering that Soueid be detained until the trial. At the hearing, prosecutor Fitzpatrick presented more detailed {{evidence to suggest}} that Soueid was a high-level operative, stating that the prosecution had [...] "tread lightly" [...] on presenting evidence at the detention hearing the week earlier because much of it came from a confidential source paid by the FBI whom the prosecution did not wish to endanger more. In a brief, Fitzpatrick described Soueid as wanting to retaliate against the two people who sued him and Syrian Embassy officials in a civil suit. Fitzpatrick stated that five days after Soueid had returned from the trip to Syria, Soueid had taken the confidential source to a Lorton, Virginia shooting range and asked the source if he had ever killed anyone. According to prosecutors, [...] "the two reportedly agreed to stick with Plan A, collecting and delivering information about Syrian dissidents in the United States, until they needed Plan B, taking hostile action." [...] Prosecutors allege that Soueid told a foreign intelligence contact about the source's shooting skills after their meeting. Fitzpatrick stressed Soueid's recent acquisition of a <b>Syrian</b> <b>passport,</b> stating that Soueid was [...] "extension of the government of Syria" [...] and [...] "clearly has designs to flee". Defense attorney Faraj argued that the government's claims were exaggerated. Faraj stated that the weapons found at Soueid's home reflected that Soueid was a long-time member of the National Rifle Association who frequented shooting ranges and hunted with his twin sons, and the overseas intelligence contact was merely a friend of Soueid's. Faraj stated that Soueid's <b>Syrian</b> <b>passport</b> reflected [...] "home pride". Reuters reported that Soueid was dressed in a green prison jumpsuit for the hearing and [...] "bowed his head after the judge's decision, running his hands through his hair", mouthing [...] "it's OK" [...] and giving a [...] "thumbs up" [...] gesture to his family members as he was led from the courtroom. CNN reported that after the hearing Faraj stated that [...] "he is considering whether to appeal Soueid's continued detention to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals", although [...] "he acknowledged such appeals are rarely successful".|$|E
40|$|Following the 2015 Paris attacks, {{public opinion}} on {{refugees}} drastically diverged in Canada and the United States. Whereas Canadians became more supportive towards taking in Syrian refugees, US-Americans increasingly disapproved the intake of refugees. In the weeks after the attacks, {{the fact that one}} of the attackers entered Europe with a <b>Syrian</b> <b>passport</b> through the refugee roads initiated a global discussion on the safety of taking in Syrian refugees. Especially television news were of major importance in pushing this debate. Through critical discourse analysis, this bachelor thesis examined whether the divergent trends in public opinion in the United States and Canada could be explained by differing news discourses. The analysis found that the US discourse extensively focused on refugees as a potential threat to national security. Due to the fact the US had entered the pre-election phase at this point, the discussion on refugees was markedly politicized. Especially Republican presidential candidates were given plenty of airtime to comment on refugees, while refugees themselves were left almost entirely voiceless. In contrast, the Canadian news discourse discussed the crisis more from a humanitarian perspective, extensively covering philanthropist Canadians who were aiding Syrian refugees through different means such as privately-sponsoring, providing medical care or donating money, clothes and housing. This analysis demonstrates that the news discourses in Canada and the US were indeed profoundly different. This supports the theory that different reporting on refugees {{in the wake of the}} Paris attacks contributed to the shifts in public opinion in Canada and the US...|$|E
