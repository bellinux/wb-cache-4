40|$|Topological superconductors {{have become}} a subject of intense {{research}} due to their potential use for technical applications in device fabrication and quantum information. Besides fully gapped superconductors, unconventional superconductors with point or line nodes in their order parameter can also exhibit nontrivial topological characteristics. This article reviews recent progress in the theoretical understanding of nodal topological superconductors, {{with a focus on}} Weyl and noncentrosymmetric superconductors and their protected surface states. Using selected examples, we review the bulk topological properties of these systems, study different types of topological surface states, and examine their unusual properties. Furthermore, we survey some candidate materials for topological superconductivity and discuss different experimental signatures of topological surface states.

40|$|Sevgi, Levent (Dogus Author) We {{were shocked}} by two natural {{disasters}} lately. First, a major earthquake (EQ) struck Southern Haiti (with magnitude of 7. 0 on January 12, 2010). An even greater earthquake hit central Chile (with magnitude 8. 8 on February 27, 2010), knocking down buildings and infrastructure, inflicting catastrophes, and causing heavy damage and severe losses. These earthquakes trigger the classical discussion on earthquake prediction. We, electromagnetic (EM) people, are {{right at the}} center of these discussions, because a majority of the earthquake-prediction claims are based on EM precursors. I have been in touch with experts/scientists from Japan, USA, and Europe, and plan to prepare a tutorial on this topic. The title has been tentatively fixed: "Prediction: Extrapolation to the Future.

Following these exchange paradoxes are two longer puzzles, also with answers provided at the end. The longer puzzles focus on externality problems: how to design social conventions and toll systems to minimize inefficient waiting in line.

40|$|In {{response}} to a Senate request, the Undergraduate Educational Effectiveness Task Force (UEETF) was established and charged with developing procedures for identifying and articulating the educational objectives of UC undergraduate academic programs and with determining methods for evaluating the success of those programs.

It proposes that each UC campus establishes departmentally-specific learning assessment programs with the dual aims of improving undergraduate education and informing the public about learning achievements of UC undergraduates.

This is a special issue {{covering}} International Children’s Book Day (ICBD), and includes news of two important events in the region.

It is inspiring to read about the celebration of ICBD around the world, especially when comparing news from {{a country with a}} long established tradition of its celebration, as with the Children’s Book Council of Iran, with news from a country such as Cambodia where the national section celebrated this day for the very first time.
