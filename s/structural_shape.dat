2500|$|Several early reports {{proposed}} {{that a group}} I WRKY transcription factor was the progenitor of the family. [...] It was thought that a single group I WRKY domain occurred first and then duplicated to form the original ancestral WRKY transcription factor. [...] However, more recent evidence suggests that WRKY transcription factors evolved from a single group IIc-like gene, which then diversified into group I, group IIc, and group IIa+b domains. [...] The original WRKY protein domain has been proposed to have arisen from the GCM1 and FLYWCH zinc finger factors. [...] GCM1 and FLYWCH are proposed ancestral proteins base on their crystal structural similarity to the WRKY domain. [...] Both GCM1 and FLYWCH belong to families of DNA-binding factors found in metazoan.

60|$|All {{that night}} Godfrey was toiling to {{retrieve}} the disaster. He took down the whole tower from where it stood and raised it again on the high ground {{to the north of}} the city which is now marked by the pine tree that grows outside Herod's gate. And all the time he toiled, it was said, sinister sorcerers sat upon the battlements, working unknown marvels for the undoing of the labour of man. If the great knight had a touch of such symbolism on his own side, he might have seen in his own strife with the solid timber something of the craft that had surrounded the birth of his creed, and the sacred trade of the carpenter. And indeed the very pattern of all carpentry is cruciform, and there is something more than an accident in the allegory. The transverse position of the timber does indeed involve many of those mathematical that are analogous to moral truths and almost every <b>structural</b> <b>shape</b> has the shadow of the mystic rood, as the three dimensions have a shadow of the Trinity. Here is the true mystery of equality; since the longer beam might lengthen itself to infinity, and never be nearer to the symbolic shape without the help of the shorter. Here is that war and wedding between two contrary forces, resisting and supporting each other; the meeting-place of contraries which we, by a sort of pietistic pun, still call the crux of the question. Here is our angular and defiant answer to the self-devouring circle of Asia. It may be improbable, though it is far from impossible (for the age was philosophical enough) that a man like Godfrey thus extended the mystical to the metaphysical; but the writer of a real romance about him would be well within his rights in making him see the symbolism of his own tower, a tower rising above him through the clouds of night as if taking hold on the heaven or showing its network of beams black against the daybreak; scaling the skies and open to all the winds, a ladder and a labyrinth, repeating till it was lost in the twilight the pattern of the sign of the cross.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: A simple {{procedure}} is {{developed for the}} selection of pultruded <b>structural</b> <b>shapes</b> {{to be used as}} beam-columns in structural design. The design equations are then validated by comparison with experimental data gathered during beam-column testing of wide-flange and I-beam pultruded <b>structural</b> <b>shapes.</b> The design procedure accounts for axial load eccentricity and bending action induced by lateral loads and end-moments. The design equations are set in the context of load and resistance factor design, considering both strength and serviceability. This paper addresses the methodology to determine the resistance factors, which should be used with properly selected load-factors accounting for the variability and uncertainty of the loads. The design equations use section-properties, such as the bending stiffness (El), which must be measured and supplied by industry. It is found that the section-properties used in the design of beams and columns are sufficient for the design of beaql-columns. Therefore, the cost and time involved in testing <b>structural</b> <b>shapes</b> are minimized. This paper also addresses the means by which section-properties can be generated effectively and inexpensively...|$|R

Additional modifications of the surface could be through attachment of functional groups of 2D or 3D patterns on the surface so that cell alignment is guided and new tissue formation is improved.|$|E
