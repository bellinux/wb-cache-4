40|$|We conduct {{molecular}} dynamics simulations of athermal systems undergoing boundary-driven planar shear flow {{in two and}} three spatial dimensions. We find that these systems possess nonlinear mean velocity profiles when the velocity u of the <b>shearing</b> <b>wall</b> exceeds a critical value u_c. Above u_c, we also show that the packing fraction and mean-square velocity profiles become spatially-dependent with dilation and enhanced velocity fluctuations near the moving boundary. In systems with overdamped dynamics, u_c is only weakly dependent on packing fraction ϕ. However, in systems with underdamped dynamics, u_c is set by the speed of shear waves in the material and tends to zero as ϕ approaches ϕ_c. In the small damping limit, ϕ_c approaches values for random close-packing obtained in systems at zero temperature. For underdamped systems with ϕ<ϕ_c, u_c is zero and thus they possess nonlinear velocity profiles at any nonzero boundary velocity. Comment: 4 pages, 4 figure...|$|E
40|$|Machinery {{such as an}} IsaMillTM used in communition {{to produce}} fine {{particle}} sizes that allow minerals to be extracted are best modelled using granular flows. A single rheological description that captures all the features of granular flows {{has not yet been}} realised, although considerable progress towards a complete theory has been made. Existing models of such horizontally stirred mills are empirical, tend to be extremely dependent on boundary conditions and do not allow for confident extrapolation beyond their window of design. As a first step to understanding the dynamics inside the IsaMillTM,a constitutive stress model of a horizontal annular shear cell is developed. This shear stress model was used in an athermal energy balance to develop a description of the power dissipation, which drives the communition purpose of the IsaMillTM. The key ingredients (velocity, shear rate and volume fraction distributions) to the granular ow model are extracted from experiments using Positron Emission Particle Tracking (PEPT), as well as Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations. 5 mm glass beads were used to fill an annulus 51 mm wide. In the PEPT experiments, two different surfaces of the driving wall (the inner cylinder of the shear cell) were used, over two shearing velocities. The effect of two friction coefficients over a range of <b>shearing</b> <b>wall</b> velocities were examined in the DEM simulations. The data were examined over 3 selected radial lines and utilised to calculate the shear stress distribution and the power dissipation from the developed models. It was found that even the usually simple relations describing the dynamics within a vertical shear cell are greatly modified by changing the orientation of the rotation axis...|$|E

However, seismic design coefficients have not been developed {{for the design of}} SCWF <b>shear</b> <b>walls</b> as a main lateral force resisting system for seismic forces. Research is needed to help designers of post-frame construction with accurately determining the behavior of SCWF <b>shear</b> <b>walls</b> subjected to lateral loads. To address these needs, finite element analysis (FEA) models of SCWF <b>shear</b> <b>walls</b> under monotonic and cyclic loading as well as the reversed cyclic SCWF <b>shear</b> <b>wall</b> tests were developed. With validated FEA predictions, and experimental data on behavior of SCWF <b>shear</b> <b>walls,</b> design information can be developed for post-frame buildings in seismic and high wind regions. FEA models were developed and validated to predict shear strength and effective shear modulus of SCWF <b>shear</b> <b>walls</b> under monotonic loading. Moreover, the hysteretic behavior of SCWF <b>shear</b> <b>walls</b> was predicted using hysteretic behavior of sheathing-to-framing connector elements. Analyses were performed to assess the shear strength, stiffness, ductility, equivalent energy elastic plastic (EEEP), and hysteretic parameters of tested SCWF <b>shear</b> <b>wall</b> specimens. Experimental tests also provided the seismic design coefficients of SCWF <b>shear</b> <b>walls,</b> which are currently lacking in the building codes. The dynamic implicit FEA models predicted well the shear strength and effective shear stiffness of SCWF <b>shear</b> <b>walls</b> under monotonic loading. The dynamic implicit FEA also overcame the deficiencies of the static implicit approach with regard to bucking, nonlinear geometry behavior of steel cladding. In addition, experimental test results showed that SCWF <b>shear</b> <b>walls</b> had high ductility, especially for unstitched <b>shear</b> <b>wall</b> configurations. Based on the research herein, <b>shear</b> <b>walls</b> with high ductility can be considered equivalent to light-framed wood <b>shear</b> <b>walls</b> with regard to behavior under seismic loading. Moreover, the hysteretic behavior of SCWF <b>shear</b> <b>walls</b> under cyclic loading was predicted well, especially for unstitched <b>shear</b> <b>wall</b> configurations. Good agreement was also obtained with regard to shear strength backbone curve, except for heavily stitched <b>shear</b> <b>walls.</b> Therefore, the FEA models can be used to determine the equivalency between SCWF <b>shear</b> <b>walls</b> and light-framed wood <b>shear</b> <b>walls.</b> Washington State University, Civil Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|Oscillatory data {{obtained}} for mashed potatoes made from fresh tubers from measuring geometries of different designs and sizes were analyzed and compared at the sample temperatures of 25 and 55 C. The measuring geometries used were smooth parallel plates (PP 40 and PP 20, 40 - and 20 -mm-diameter plates, respectively); truncated cone and plate (CP 4 / 40, 40 -mm-diameter cone having an angle of 4 °); FL 25 four-bladed vane tool (diameter: 25 mm, height: 55 mm); and serrated parallel plate (SPP 40, 40 -mm-diameter plate). Three different gaps between plates were used (2, 1. 5 and 1 mm) {{to simulate the}} range of aggregate spacing in fresh mashed potatoes. The measured oscillatory rheological properties were significantly affected {{not only by the}} sample temperature but also by the test geometry used and the friction of and gap between its shearing surfaces. Dynamic parameter values were higher at 55 than at 25 C, possibly indicating the onset and propagation of gelatinization of the potato starch grains. Unexpectedly, test geometries with higher friction capabilities, such as the serrated plate and vane tool, presented lower viscoelastic properties compared with results of other test geometries with lower friction capabilities. This result provides evidence of the influence of other factors on the measured oscillatory rheological properties of the mashed potato, such as measurement accuracy of the rheometer at different very small strains, homogeneity of the temperature for the different samples, existence of a complex dependency on the possibly complex stress condition that is imposed on the material upon loading, or even samples being prone to drying. The effect of the variation of the gap between parallel plates on oscillatory parameters depended on the <b>shearing</b> <b>wall</b> friction. The study highlights the difficulty in reconciling rheological results from different sources and the need for standardized rheological test methods so that rheological interlaboratory results can be critically analyzed and compared. © 2007, The Author(s); Journal compilation © 2007, Blackwell Publishing.

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Shear</b> <b>wall</b> is {{commonly}} {{employed as a}} principal element to resist lateral loads due to wind or earthquake forces. An accurate model for a <b>shear</b> <b>wall</b> system needs to consider the effect of all components for analyses i. e. <b>shear</b> <b>wall,</b> foundation, and subsoil. This investigation presents the modeling of a <b>shear</b> <b>wall</b> structure- foundation and soil system using the super element, finite and infinite elem ents while considering soil nonlinearity. The applicability of the proposed idealization has been shown by analyzing a <b>shear</b> <b>wall</b> structure under static loadings. In order to explore the efficiency of using super elements, an attempt has also been made to model the <b>shear</b> <b>wall</b> building using fully conventional finite element discretization. Furthermore the paper investigates the necessity of including soil structure interaction in analyzing <b>shear</b> <b>wall</b> structures. The results obtained from the analysis of a <b>shear</b> <b>wall</b> model considering five different types of soil for the soil media show that the influence of soil interaction is very significant in the displacement as well as stresses induced in the <b>shear</b> <b>wall</b> buildings. ...|$|R

A simple analytical equation has been proposed to calculate the maximum displacement of <b>shear</b> <b>walls</b> by considering the effective stiffness of cracked sections of <b>shear</b> <b>wall</b> components. The results demonstrated that the haunches caused a delay to the formation of cracks and increased the capacity of coupling beams and enhanced the ultimate strength and stiffness of <b>shear</b> <b>wall</b> structures. The accuracy of suggested maximum displacement equation was assessed and concluded that the results were in good agreement with experimen...|$|R

In order to explore the seismic performance of {{the original}} <b>shear</b> <b>wall</b> structure and the altered <b>shear</b> <b>wall</b> structure, the cyclic loading testes of the <b>shear</b> <b>walls</b> with different reinforcement ratio and constructional details are carried out. This paper presents the numerical analysis of the cyclic loading testes of <b>shear</b> <b>walls</b> with SWNA (<b>Shear</b> <b>Wall</b> Nonlinear Analysis) program.

40|$|The {{usefulness}} of structural {{walls in the}} framing of buildings has long been recognized. It is generally preferred to use <b>shear</b> <b>wall</b> in combination with moment resisting frame. In the present study, an effort is also made to investigate the shear wall-RC frame interaction using 2 -D modeling of 20, 30 and 35 storey RC frame building with <b>shear</b> <b>wall.</b> In equivalent simplified 2 -D model, two exterior frames with <b>shear</b> <b>wall</b> modeled as single frame with double stiffness, strength and weight. The interior frames without <b>shear</b> <b>wall</b> are modeled as a single frame with equivalent stiffness, strength and weight. The modeled frames are connected with rigid link at each floor level. Using 2 -D plane frame model the lateral force distribution between Exterior frame with <b>shear</b> <b>wall</b> and Interior frame without <b>shear</b> <b>wall</b> is investigated. From the analysis, {{it is observed that}} up to bottom seven/eight storey more than 50 % load is taken by frame with <b>shear</b> <b>wall</b> and the lower most three storeys take about 75 % of total storey shear...|$|R
40|$|The {{reinforced}} concrete slit <b>shear</b> <b>wall</b> {{system has been}} introduced recently as {{a new breed of}} earthquake resistant structures. Some theoretical and experimental investigations have been conducted to study the behaviour of isolated connecting beams and slit <b>shear</b> <b>wall</b> models under static load, but little work has been carried out to investigate the dynamic behaviour of the structural system. In this paper, the non-linear seismic response of slit <b>shear</b> <b>walls</b> under earthquake excitation is analyzed. Based on a simplified structural model, which is shown to have sufficient accuracy for slit <b>shear</b> <b>wall</b> structures, the influence of the elasto-plastic behaviour of the connecting beams on the dynamic response of the slit <b>shear</b> <b>wall</b> structure is evaluated. The results reveal that yielding of the connecting beams can significantly reduce the deflection response of the slit <b>shear</b> <b>wall</b> structure and the seismic loading induced on it. Moreover, there appears to be an optimum yield strength value for the connecting beams that would lead to the best overall seismic performance of the slit <b>shear</b> <b>wall</b> system. © 1999 Academic Press. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: <b>Shear</b> <b>walls</b> are {{commonly}} used as structural elements to resist earthquake. The seismic performance of <b>shear</b> <b>wall</b> can be guaranteed under small earthquakes, but problems exist when it is subjected to large earthquakes. To improve the ductility and energy dissipation capacity of <b>shear</b> <b>walls</b> in large earthquakes, shear failure must be avoided {{and the performance of}} plastic hinge region must be improved. The adaptive-slit <b>shear</b> <b>walls</b> (ASSW) is proposed in this paper The mechanical characteristics of ASSW satisfy the requirements of structures under different seismic level. Therefore the damage process of ASSW can be controlled and the ductile shear failure can be realized, which obviously improve the seismic performance of <b>shear</b> <b>wall</b> structures...|$|R
