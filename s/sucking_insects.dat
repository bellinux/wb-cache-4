25|$|The {{sloth bear}} (Melursus ursinus), {{also known as}} the labiated bear, is an insectivorous bear species native to the Indian subcontinent. The sloth bear evolved from ancestral brown bears during the Pleistocene and shares {{features}} found in insect-eating mammals through convergent evolution. The population isolated in Sri Lanka is considered a subspecies. Compared to brown and black bears, sloth bears have lankier builds, long, shaggy coats that form a mane around the face (similar to that of a lion), long, sickle-shaped claws, and a specially adapted lower lip and palate used for <b>sucking</b> <b>insects.</b> Sloth bears breed during spring and early summer and give birth near the beginning of winter. They feed on termites, honeybee colonies, and fruits. Sloth bears sometimes attack humans who encroach on their territories. Historically, humans have drastically reduced their habitat and diminished their population by hunting them for food and products such as their bacula and claws. These bears have been used as performing pets due to their tameable nature. The sloth bear is listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN due to habitat loss and poaching.|$|E

40|$|Being {{members of}} complex communities, plants often emit {{a wide range}} of {{volatile}} organic compounds to defend themselves against insect invasions. Although many studies exist on insect-induced plant volatile emission, most of them either compare the influences of various herbivore species on one plant species or the impact of a given herbivore on several host plant species. Moreover, informations related to the influence of insect density as well as the infestation duration are still needed. Here, we showed that a <b>sucking</b> <b>insect</b> – Myzus persicae (green peach aphid) induced the volatile emission from Arabidopsis thaliana Columbia wild-type (A. thaliana Col- 0) under laboratory conditions based on results obtained by solid-phase micro-extraction coupled with gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (SPME-GC/MS). The released volatile blend was discussed in relation to related biosynthesis pathways and functions. These included terpenoids, green leaf volatiles, alcohols and isothiocyanate. The qualitative and overall proportion of volatile components differed depended on the number and residence duration of aphids on leaves. By studying the effects of <b>sucking</b> <b>insect</b> stresses to plant, we not only aim to contribute to the fundamental understanding of the emission of volatile components in the interaction between plants and pests, but also to provide standardised and easy to use assays to assess A. thaliana volatile changes according to cross stresses, including both biotic and abiotic ones in ongoing experiments...|$|R
