50|$|Heading into 2008, the <b>Silver</b> <b>Stars</b> were {{regarded}} as a premiere contender and did not disappoint. After an average start, the Stars seized control of the Western Conference and rode to {{the best record in}} the West, and the #1 seed in the playoffs. In the first round, the <b>Silver</b> <b>Stars</b> once again faced off against the Sacramento Monarchs. Unlike 2007, the Stars won Game 1 on the road, 85-78. But the Monarchs would prove pesky, spoiling a potential clinch in Game 2 crushing the <b>Silver</b> <b>Stars</b> at home 84-67. Now the <b>Silver</b> <b>Stars</b> had to win game 3 or face an offseason of disappointment. In the Game, the <b>Silver</b> <b>Stars</b> would secure a 14-point lead and it seemed over. But a late rally by the Monarchs, including the last seven points in regulation, sent the game into overtime. In overtime, the <b>Silver</b> <b>Stars</b> clamped down and proved they were the better team, defeating the Monarchs 86-81, advancing to the Western Conference Finals for the second season in a row. In the West Finals, the Stars faced the resurgent Los Angeles Sparks team. In Game 1 in LA, the Stars took an early lead, but an 11-0 run by the Sparks into the half changed the tempo of the game and the Sparks took Game 1 85-70. In Game 2, the <b>Silver</b> <b>Stars</b> blew a 14-point lead in the final quarter, as the Sparks took a one-point lead with 1.3 seconds left. The Stars season was over unless there would be a miracle. Fortunately for the Stars, Sophia Young delivered with a 14-foot turnaround shot to lift the <b>Silver</b> <b>Stars</b> to a 67-66 game 2. It came down to Game 3, with a trip to the WNBA Finals on the line. The two teams battled down the stretch, but the stellar play of Becky Hammon, who had 35 points and 4 crucial free throws, would lift the <b>Silver</b> <b>Stars</b> to their first WNBA Finals, defeating the Sparks 76-72. In the WNBA Finals, the <b>Silver</b> <b>Stars</b> faced the Detroit Shock, who were making their third WNBA Finals appearance in a row. In Game 1 at home, the <b>Silver</b> <b>Stars</b> fell behind early, but would tie the game at 69 with 2:15 left in the 4th quarter. But from there the Shock took control once again and won the game 77-69.|$|R
50|$|The 2007 season {{brought a}} lot of change for the <b>Silver</b> <b>Stars.</b> They {{acquired}} stars Becky Hammon, Ruth Riley, and Sandora Irvin in trades, selected Helen Darling in Charlotte Sting's dispersal draft, drafted Camille Little in the second round, signed Erin Buescher during the off-season, and retained key players, such as Marie Ferdinand-Harris, Vickie Johnson, Shanna Crossley, Kendra Wecker, and Sophia Young. The new-look <b>Silver</b> <b>Stars</b> became an instant contender in the Western Conference. On August 4, 2007 the <b>Silver</b> <b>Stars</b> clinched their first playoff berth since the franchise relocated to San Antonio in 2003. In the first round, the <b>Silver</b> <b>Stars</b> were matched up against the Sacramento Monarchs. After losing game 1 in Sacramento, the <b>Silver</b> <b>Stars</b> would win games 2 and 3 to advance to the Western Finals. The <b>Silver</b> <b>Stars</b> faced off against a strong Phoenix Mercury team, which had the number 1 seed in the Western Conference. The <b>Silver</b> <b>Stars</b> would lose Game 1 at home 102-100 on a controversial call by ref Lisa Mattingly. Mattingly called a foul on Shanna Crossley with 2.1 seconds left in the game and the score tied at 100. Replay showed that Crossley made no contact with Phoenix's Cappie Pondexter. However, Pondexter was sent to the line and made both free throws and Crossley's half-court shot to win the game nearly went in. On September 1, 2007 the Silver Stars' season came to an end after the Stars lost Game 2 98-92 in Phoenix.|$|R

When he subsequently in 2000, also opted to purchase a 50% ownership of the football club <b>Silver</b> <b>Stars,</b> he decided together with the other owner of <b>Silver</b> <b>Stars,</b> to create a fruitful collaboration between the two clubs. This meant that the professional <b>Silver</b> <b>Stars</b> top club, became renamed to [...] "HP Silver Stars", while the Highlands Park junior team {{for a couple of}} years worked as the nursery team for the club.As HP <b>Silver</b> <b>Stars</b> played their matches at the Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane, 309 km northeast of Highlands North, it was however soon decided also to create a <b>Silver</b> <b>Stars</b> junior team in Polokwane.

5|$|The 42nd Division {{entered the}} line in the quiet Lunéville sector in February 1918. On 26 February, MacArthur and Captain Thomas T. Handy {{accompanied}} a French trench raid in which MacArthur assisted in the capture of a number of German prisoners. The commander of the French VII Corps, Major General Georges de Bazelaire, decorated MacArthur with the Croix de guerre. Menoher recommended MacArthur for a <b>Silver</b> <b>Star,</b> which he later received. The <b>Silver</b> <b>Star</b> Medal was not instituted until 8 August 1932, but small Silver Citation Stars were authorized to be worn on the campaign ribbons of those cited in orders for gallantry, similar to the British mention in despatches. When the <b>Silver</b> <b>Star</b> Medal was instituted, it was retroactively awarded to those who had been awarded Silver Citation Stars. On 9 March, the 42nd Division launched three raids of its own on German trenches in the Salient du Feys. MacArthur accompanied a company of the 168th Infantry. This time, his leadership was rewarded with the Distinguished Service Cross. A few days later, MacArthur, who was strict about his men carrying their gas masks but often neglected to bring his own, was gassed. He recovered in time to show Secretary Baker around the area on 19 March.|$|E
