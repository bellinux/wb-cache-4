5|$|I'm {{really happy}} to do this. I feel rejuvenated by it, I feel excited again. You're very much alive, you're {{very much in the}} moment, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> feel I'm really living.|$|E
5|$|If it {{had gone}} by me, it's a two-on-one. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> got a little lucky there, but Derek gave me a great pass and when I got the pass I was moving across. As I skated across, Glenn had to move across the crease and had to open his pads a little. I was really {{trying to get the}} puck on net, and I did. As I went across, Glenn's legs opened. I looked back, and I saw it go in, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> jumped.|$|E
5|$|It all {{happened}} that night. She {{told us the}} title of the song, the concept and sang us the melody. We usually have Big Jim Wright sit in on those kind of sessions to work out the chords. he wasn't there <b>so</b> <b>I</b> had to work on the chord myself. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> was playing and there was a part where I said 'Man, what chord am I supposed to do here?' and Mariah has such a good ear that she sang me the chord.|$|E

5|$|<b>So</b> <b>I</b> {{went out}} and saw the band – Billy, James, and D'arcy – playing at Avalon with a drum machine. Man, did they sound horrible! They were atrocious. But the thing I noticed was that {{not only were the}} song {{structures}} good, but Billy's voice had a lot of drive to it, like he was dying to succeed. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> ended up driving from work every Wednesday to rehearse with them.|$|E
5|$|We {{could have}} played on, {{but it was a}} Test match and we just had to win. I {{realised}} something drastic had to be done or three wickets might be lost. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> appealed after every second ball. I complained of the people moving about, the light, and, in fact, anything, {{in an effort to get}} the appeal upheld. Hammond and Yardley were inspecting the wet pitch. I knew there was a chance of losing valuable wickets <b>so</b> <b>I</b> just kept on appealing until the umpires answered me.|$|E
5|$|A writer {{tends to}} find her {{characters}} in her self, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> can tell you... that Nixon, Pat, Mme. Mao, Kissinger and the chorus were all 'me.' And the inner lives of Mao and Chou En-Lai, who I couldn't find in myself at all, were drawn {{from a couple of}} close acquaintances.|$|E

5|$|I {{called to}} him to turn hard opposite, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> could {{sandwich}} the Red fighters, but in his standard-rate bomber turn he got hit. I saw {{the whole thing and}} ordered him to dive and bail out immediately. To my intense relief I saw him leave the aircraft and his parachute blossom. I was happy to get this Airacobra, but I was mad at myself for not harkening to my intuition not to fly with Günther Capito.|$|E
5|$|I heard {{dance and}} techno {{and was always}} {{interested}} in it but didn't really know where to go. But I went to a club one night and saw that people were losing their mind to these dance tracks. It wasn't really that I wanted to mimic that sound. I just wanted to have that energy and have people going crazy. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> knew the fusion was putting R with trance.|$|E
5|$|I was in Russia, then Germany, {{and spent}} a lot of time in Eastern Europe. There is this amazing German house-techno music, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> wanted to make a pop {{experimental}} record. I kind of wanted to leave the '80s a little bit, so the chorus is a '90s melody, which is what the inspiration was. There was certainly some whisky involved in the writing of the record. It's about being in love with your best friend.|$|E

5|$|I'd {{done a lot}} {{of videos}} and wasn't always a hundred percent thrilled. For the most part, I was never thrilled with the results, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> figured I would give {{directing}} a shot. It was a pretty simple concept. Most of the scenes were featured at the amusement park, at a late-night outdoor celebration. I was really happy to be able to include O.D.B in the remix video.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} a {{struggle}} telling this story over the years, {{because a lot of}} people don't want to hear about this kind of history. People don't relate to it, or just don't want to hear about it. But Mama told me to keep it alive, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> keep telling it... It's a sad story, but it's one I think everyone needs to hear.|$|E
5|$|She's so soft. She's {{beautiful}} too. I {{always tell}} her this story: When I {{was locked up}} in jail, that song 'Vision of Love' was the hottest song in the world.

6000|$|... "Seem <b>I</b> <b>so</b> well, dear Charlotte?" [...] he {{at length}} {{said in a}} low, tremulous, and hollow voice, [...] "seem <b>I</b> <b>so</b> well? <b>I</b> believe you are right, and that I shall shortly be better--much better." ...|$|R
5|$|Their daughter, Scottie, wrote {{after their}} deaths: I think (short of {{documentary}} {{evidence to the}} contrary) that if people are not crazy, they get themselves out of crazy situations, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> {{have never been able}} to buy the notion that it was my father's drinking which led her to the sanitarium.
