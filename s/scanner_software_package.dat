50|$|Array size: The first microarrays {{used for}} ChIP-on-Chip {{contained}} about 13,000 spotted DNA segments representing all ORFs and intergenic regions from the yeast genome. Nowadays, Affymetrix offers whole-genome tiled yeast arrays with {{a resolution of}} 5bp (all in all 3.2 million probes). Tiled arrays for the human genome {{become more and more}} powerful, too. Just to name example, Affymetrix offers a set of seven arrays with about 90 million probes, spanning the complete non-repetitive part of the human genome with about 35bp spacing. (Feb 2007)Besides the actual microarray, other hard- and software equipment is necessary to run ChIP-on-chip experiments. It is generally the case that one company’s microarrays can not be analyzed by another company’s processing hardware. Hence, buying an array requires also buying the associated workflow equipment. The most important elements are, among others, hybridization ovens, chip <b>scanners,</b> and <b>software</b> <b>packages</b> for subsequent numerical analysis of the raw data.|$|R
