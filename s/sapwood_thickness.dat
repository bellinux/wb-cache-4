40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to explore the distribution of major nutrients (N, P, K, Ca and Mg) in the aboveground compartments of an intensively managed tree species (Pinus pinaster Ait.). A total of 53 trees were cut down in even-aged stands respectively 8, 16, 26, 32 and 40 years old. The nutrient concentrations of the aboveground compartments were analysed. Nutrient concentrations of foliage did not vary with any of the variables used, except needle age. Nutrient concentrations of living branches, stem bark, stem sapwood, stem heartwood, stemwood and stem decreased with increasing branch diameter, bark thickness, <b>sapwood</b> <b>thickness</b> and heartwood thickness, respectively. Beyond a certain value of the predictive variable (stem diameter approximate to 15 cm; branch diameter approximate to 2. 5 cm), the concentration of all the nutrients stabilised. A 50 year-old pine stand was used to obtain a validation dataset for nitrogen concentration. For this nutrient, the regression relationships gave satisfactory estimates for most compartments (mean error = 12 - 25 %) and particularly for the stem. A procedure is proposed to estimate the nutrient exports associated with harvests of Pinus pinaster biomass...|$|E

Growth rings, heartwood development, anatomical characteristics of wood and bark and wood density were studied at different ages and sites. The wood showed growth ring porosity, high fibre and rays proportion and high wood density. The heartwood proportion was relatively high and increased from the base to the top following the trunk profile. <b>Sapwood</b> <b>thickness</b> was approximately constant. The fibre and multiseriate rays showed an increasing tendency towards the bark {{as well as the}} mean earlywood vessels area. The ring width and wood density decreased from pith to bark. The variation sources included age, trees and environmental conditions. Site was responsible for the main variations followed by tree and cambial age. The correlations between the studied variables showed that growth and wood quality might be estimated namely with ring width. The wood characterization and relative stem homogeneity allow exploitation of this species and reinforce its role in forest diversity...|$|E
40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at www 3. interscience. wiley. com. In the Pacific north-west, the Cascade Mountain Range blocks much of the precipitation and maritime influence of the Pacific Ocean, resulting in distinct climates east and west of the mountains. The current study aimed to investigate relationships between water storage and transport properties in populations of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) adapted to both climates. <b>Sapwood</b> <b>thickness,</b> capacitance, vulnerability to embolism, and axial and radial conductivity were measured on samples collected from trunks of mature trees. The sapwood of ponderosa pine was {{three to four times}} thicker than Douglas-fir. Radial conductivity was higher in west-side populations of both species, but axial conductivity was higher in the east-side populations and in Douglas-fir. Eastern populations of both species had sapwood that was more vulnerable to embolism than west-side populations. Sapwood capacitance was similar between species, but was about twice as great in east-side populations (580 kg m⁻³ MPa⁻¹) as in west-side populations (274 kg m⁻³ MPa⁻¹). Capacitance was positively correlated with both mean embolism pressure and axial conductivity across species and populations, suggesting that coordinated adjustments in xylem efficiency, safety and water storage capacity may serve to avoid embolism along a gradient of increasing aridity...|$|E
40|$|An {{appropriate}} moisture {{transport and}} a control of moisture distribution are needed {{from the early}} beginning of drying process, especially at drying of high dense and less permeable hardwoods. For determination of suitable process conditions at drying of European beechwood (Fagus sylvatica L.) the unidirectional drying kinetics, with an emphasis of free water removal was researched. We used radially oriented <b>sapwood</b> specimens, having <b>thickness</b> from 6 mm to 24 mm (f L = 6 mm). Series of conventional drying processes were {{carried out in the}} laboratory tunnel drier at constant climate (T = 30 2. 5 m/s) lead to early irreversible reduction of initial moisture flow and transition to the period of significantly falling drying rate, where the internal mass resistance predominated and caused high initial moisture content gradient.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the quality of the plywood, manufactured from Pinus taeda and Pinus oocarpa, with 20 and 24 years old respectively, using three differentformulations of the fenol-formaldheyde resin. The results of the glue line shearing tests not showed statistical differences between the species and three resin formulations. In the hot water test, all of the boards were classified as “BR” and, the boards of the Pinus oocarpa produced with formulations (1) and (3), were classified as “WBP”. The different resin formulations not influenced on the modulus ofelasticity (MOE) and modulus of rupture (MOR) The boards of Pinus taeda with formulations (1) and(2) showed higher values of MOE in comparison of the Pinus oocarpa. The MOR of the Pinus oocarpa withformulation (2) was higher than Pinus taeda. The mechanical properties of the plywood wereprobably influenced by wood variability related to <b>sapwood</b> and hartwood, <b>thickness</b> of growth ringsand, springwood and summerwood...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of climatic and site fertility conditions affect wood quality from fast growing trees. The change in tree diameter, thickness of sapwood, heartwood percentage and bark and pith tissue, physical and mechanical properties, resistance to termite attack {{and the presence}} of drying defects on lumber boards were evaluated. Four teak trees (Tectona grandis L. f.) from fast growing plantations in Costa Rica were selected for the study. Teak trees of 11 years old growing in two climatic conditions and two fertility types (high and low fertility) in Costa Rica were studied. The results showed that tree diameter, <b>sapwood</b> <b>thickness,</b> pith diameter and its percentage were higher in the climate with more rainfall and greater fertility. However, the percentage of heartwood and bark were higher at low fertility sites with less rainfall. It was also observed that only sites with low fertility produce modifications in specify gravity, fiber saturation point, initial moisture content, MOR in flexion in green and dry condition, MOE in bending and resistance to termite attack. Incidence and magnitude of defects increased with drying, and were mainly affected when wood comes from younger trees from high fertility sites and growing in tropical moist forest climate. © 2015, Indian Academy of Wood Science...|$|E
40|$|A qualidade da madeira aparentemente está associada às características dendrométricas, que por sua vez são influenciadas pelas condições de crescimento. Os objetivos deste estudo foram a caracterização dendrométrica e a realização de correlações de Pearson entre alguns parâmetros tecnológicos da madeira do híbrido clonal de Eucalyptus urophylla x Eucalyptus grandis sob três estratos silviculturais. Os dados dendrométricos foram analisados mediante a análise de regressão. Os resultados mostraram que o híbrido apresenta comportamento similar ao das demais madeiras da mesma espécie que cresceram em outras regiões, destacando-se a espessura do alburno no E 1 (talhadia simples, 70 meses e com um desbaste), com pouca variação ao longo do fuste. Todas as árvores apresentaram, em geral, baixa conicidade ao longo do fuste e baixo volume de casca entre os estratos. Na correlação de Pearson foram avaliados entre si nove parâmetros dendrométricos, sete físicos e três mecânicos, longitudinalmente em seções de 3 m e na posição medula-casca nas duas primeiras toras. Os coeficientes encontrados demonstram haver fortes correlações entre as propriedades, destacando-se a densidade básica em relação às demais características e o coeficiente de anisotropia, ambas importantes no processo de desdobro e secagem da madeira. Não houve correlações significativas nas contrações lineares e volumétricas ao longo do comprimento do fuste. A variação radial mostrou boas correlações entre todas as propriedades mecânicas avaliadas nas duas primeiras toras. Em contrapartida, as propriedades físicas avaliadas na posição radial não apresentaram correlações significativas. Wood {{quality is}} {{apparently}} {{associated with the}} dendrometric characteristics that are influenced by growth conditions. The {{aim of this study}} was the dendrometric characterization and realization of Pearson Correlations among some technological parameters in the clonal hybrid wood Eucalyptus urophylla x Eucalyptus grandis grown in three silvicultural extracts. The dendrometric data were analyzed by regression analysis. The results show that the hybrid presents similar behavior to other eucalypt of the same species grown in other places with <b>sapwood</b> <b>thickness</b> in E 1 (coppice with 70 months and one thinning), with little variation along the stem. All evaluated trees presented, in general, a low taper along the stem with very little bark volume among the extracts. The Pearson Correlation studied nine dendrometric parameters, seven physical and three mechanical properties. The parameters were evaluated, longitudinally, in three meter sections along the stem and in the pith-bark position in the first two logs according to the Pearson's Correlation. The coefficients demonstrated a strong correlation among the properties, with basic density being highly correlated to the other characteristics and anisotropic coefficient, important in the process of sawing and drying wood, as well as <b>sapwood</b> <b>thickness.</b> The correlation to the height relationship wasn't significant to the linear and volumetric shrinkage. Radial variation showed a good correlation among all the evaluated mechanical properties in the two first logs. On the other hand, the physical properties in the radial position didn't present significant correlations with tangential shrinkage...|$|E
40|$|A major {{challenge}} in surface hydrology involves predicting streamflow in ungauged catchments with heterogeneous vegetation and spatiotemporally varying evapotranspiration (ET) rates. We present a top-down approach for quantifying {{the influence of}} broad-scale changes in forest structure on ET and hence streamflow. Across three catchments between 18 and 100 km 2 in size and with regenerating Eucalyptus regnans and E. delegatensis forest, we demonstrate how variation in ET can be mapped in space and over time using LiDAR data and commonly available forest inventory data. The model scales plot-level sapwood area (SA) to the catchment-level using basal area (BA) and tree stocking density (N) estimates in forest growth models. The SA estimates over a 69 year regeneration period are used in a relationship between SA and vegetation induced streamflow loss (L) to predict annual streamflow (Q) with annual rainfall (P) estimates. Without calibrating P, BA, N, SA, and L to Q data, we predict annual Q with R 2 between 0. 68 and 0. 75 and Nash Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) between 0. 44 and 0. 48. To remove bias, the model was extended to allow for runoff carry-over into the following year as well as minor correction to rainfall bias, which produced R 2 values between 0. 72 and 0. 79, and NSE between 0. 70 and 0. 79. The model under-predicts streamflow during drought periods as it lacks representation of ecohydrological processes that reduce L with either reduced growth rates or rainfall interception during drought. Refining the relationship between <b>sapwood</b> <b>thickness</b> and forest inventory variables is likely to further improve results...|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} a novel methodology for measuring stand sapwood area (SA), {{which provides a}} useful indicator of evapotranspiration from forest stands. The method is demonstrated in a 73 -year-old Eucalyptus regnans forest comprising 784 stems over a 5 [*]ha area. We used photos of stump cross-sections to differentiate sapwood from heartwood and found 90 % of stump segments to have a visible transition boundary. The digital images were corrected for lens distortion and scaled to an actual cross-sectional area, with resulting stump perimeters corresponding well with field-measured perimeters traced using string (root-mean-square error[*]=[*] 4 [*]cm, R²[*]=[*] 0. 99). Calculated SA and basal area (BA) at stump height were coupled with tree and sapwood taper data to predict the SA:BA ratio at 1. 3 [*]m height (̂R 1. 3). Tree taper data were coupled with stump dimensions data in a mixed-effects model to predict each stump's BA at 1. 3 [*]m, and sapwood taper data from buttress logs were used to improve each stems ̂R 1. 3. Using this procedure, we found our study site to have an ̂R 1. 3 of 0. 21 and total stand SA at 1. 3 [*]m height of 9. 3 [*]m²[*]ha⁻¹. We quantified the bias in traditional ̂R 1. 3 estimates that use cores to measure <b>sapwood</b> <b>thickness</b> and diameter tape to calculate SA. We show traditional methods underestimate inline image that increases with tree diameter and decreases with stem circularity, whereas our methodology gave more accurate measures of SA in large buttressing trees. Our methodology also provides a more efficient way of generating maps of SA variation across large forested catchments...|$|E
