40|$|Abstract. Plasma sprayed CoNiCrAlY coating {{can prevent}} {{oxidation}} and corrosion of turbine blades in a gas turbine plant. Cracking and delamination of coatings {{are affected by}} the residual stresses in the coatings. In this study, the arising mechanism of residual stress in the plasma sprayed coating was discussed. The residual stresses in CoNiCrAlY coatings were measured by X-ray diffraction method. The coatings were deposited by either low pressure plasma spraying (LPPS) or atmospheric plasma spraying (APS). Each elastic constant which was used for determining the X-ray stress constant was mechanically measured by a bending test. Two kinds of substrates were prepared for each coating in order to examine the effect of thermal expansion coefficient of a substrate. Results were as follows. The residual stresses of the coatings on steel substrates were tensile. On the other hand, the residual stresses on stainless substrates were lower than those on steel substrates. Arising mechanism of the residual stresses can be explained by both the linear expansion coefficient and the range of changing temperature. It was also found that the absolute residual stresses were affected by the <b>spraying</b> <b>powder</b> size and increased with a decrease of the <b>spraying</b> <b>powder</b> size.

30|$|Cold spray is {{a method}} of {{material}} deposition in which coatings are applied by accelerating powdered feedstock of ductile metal to speeds of 300 – 1200  m/s via gas-dynamic techniques using nitrogen or helium as the process gas. Due to relatively low temperature (0 – 800  °C) of the expanded gas, it {{is also known as}} cold gas-dynamic <b>spraying.</b> <b>Powder</b> feed rate up to 14  kg/h [99] is generally used. Cold spray coatings also show better adhesion, reduced material loss by vaporization, low gas entrapment, non-uniform grain growth, recrystallization, low residual stress and better surface finishes. Cold spray is restricted to the deposition of ductile metals, alloys (Zn, Sn, Ag, Cu, Al, NiCr, Ti, Nb, Mo, Cu-Al, MCrAlYs and nickel alloys), polymers and blends of >  50 vol% ductile materials with brittle metals or ceramics. Disadvantages of cold spray process include the increased gas costs, and use of high gas flows; {{especially in the case of}} helium, recycling would be needed. Therefore, lesser-cost gases such as nitrogen are being examined as an alternative. Also, high gas pressures leads to the development and modification of feeders. Solid materials traveling at high velocities are abrasive, so the dimensional and lifetime stability of key components are emphasized [100]. Cold spray coating applications include corrosion protection, where the lack of process-induced oxidation may offer better performance; the application of metallic coatings to glass substrates and deposition of ceramics for solders and electrical conductors. It is difficult to coat the inner surfaces of small diameter bores and other limited access surfaces. Also the usage of flammable gases, with acetylene, needs to be used safely and storage of gases should be done carefully [101].|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the use of Cold Gas Spray {{technology}} (CGS) to spray different nature powders onto light alloys with the aim of increasing their wear resistance. The growing industrial interest for costs reduction (fuel consumption, machinery lifetime, or personal security) has emphasized the necessity to investigate the potential applications that light alloys can offer. Weight reduction is a reason why light metals and its alloys have been associated with strong industries as transport or aerospace. Nevertheless, weight saving aspect should not opaque the fact that light metals possess other “relevant technological” properties like the high corrosion resistance and high electrical and thermal conductivity of aluminium, the machinability of magnesium and the extreme corrosion resistance of titanium. It {{must be taken into account}} that despite these technological importance properties, due to their density, among some other physical properties, aluminium and magnesium have a low hardness and low wear resistance, which provokes the need of improving its surface properties. The main objective has been the obtention and optimization of Ti 6 Al 4 V and 316 L stainless steel coatings onto light alloys, by means of Cold Gas Spray technology, a thermal spray technique which provides a dense and with no oxidation traces coatings, keeping the original microstructure of the spraying powders. Ti 6 Al 4 V and SS 316 L coatings have been produced onto Al- 7075 -T 6 and AZ 31 substrates and Ti 6 Al 4 V coatings have been also produced onto Ti 6 Al 4 V substrate. Actually industrial machinery made of titanium alloy Ti 6 Al 4 V, that due to use has been damaged, needs repair and it will be easily repairable through this technique leading to a reduction in costs and repair times. In the present thesis, coatings based on Ti 6 Al 4 V and Stainless Steel 316 L have been successfully obtained by means of Cold Gas Spray Technologies onto three different light alloys (Ti 6 Al 4 V, Al- 7075 -T 6 and AZ 31) improving their properties with respect to wear and corrosion resistance. Two different powder morphologies (spherical and irregular) of each spraying material have been tested onto the three substrates. Coatings have been obtained under the conditions of two different design of experiments, each one developed for the different used cold gas spray guns (KINETIC 8000 and KINETIC 4000) From the obtained coatings and its properties it can be said that: Irregular powders reach higher in flight velocities than the spherical ones due to drag coefficient, and despite both powders have the same hardness, the deposition efficiencies of the spherical powders are higher. Irregular powders are more oxidized due to production process (gas atomization vs. hydride-dehydride and water atomization) and this reduces the DE. Comparing both systems, spherical Ti 6 Al 4 V and irregular Ti 6 Al 4 V spraying powders, higher deposition efficiencies are obtained with spherical powder, arriving to 140 % higher on the optimal spraying conditions. As the spraying temperature and pressure increases, deposition efficiency does it also because more particles are reaching its critical velocity. In addition, porosity reduces because particles are more ductile due to the temperature and they are able to deform more closing the existing pores of the coating. For structural applications where the light alloy structures would undergo to wear and corrosion processes, coatings must be thick and dense. Fully dense coatings have been obtained using He as propellant, gas protecting the substrates against corrosion, but He is more than 4 times expensive than N 2. When <b>spraying</b> <b>powder</b> on substrate with the same or similar nature, as it happened with Ti 6 Al 4 V <b>spraying</b> <b>powder</b> and Titanium or Ti 6 Al 4 V substrate, microfusions are produced due to impact, making strong the bond between particles and substrate, but when <b>spraying</b> <b>powder</b> and substrate has different nature and properties (hardness, ductility, thermal conductivity, crystal structure, deformation mechanism), as it has been seen with Ti 6 Al 4 V as <b>spraying</b> <b>powder</b> and Al- 7075 -T 6 and AZ 31 as substrates, mechanical bonding is produced by anchoring. No fusion zones are founded. The obtained results of cavitation test, have helped to identify experimentally CGS bonding mechanisms as a function of particle/substrate nature. The order in bonding strength is Ti, Ti 6 Al 4 V, Al- 7075 -T 6 and finally AZ 31. These results are in accordance to those obtained with adhesion tests. Concerning to corrosion resistance, the obtained Ti 6 Al 4 V coatings onto the three substrates, using He as propellant gas, are fully resistant to corrosion. After 24 hours testing, no electrolyte has reached substrate surface showing fully resistance and ensuring the accomplishment of ASTM D- 1411 standard. SS 316 L coatings onto Al- 7075 -T 6 and AZ 31 substrates, using N 2 as propellant gas, are fully resistant to corrosion, following the same standard as before. Esta tesis se centra en el uso de la tecnología de Cold Gas Spray para proyectar polvos micrométricos sobre diferentes aleaciones ligeras con el fin de obtener un recubrimiento que aumente la resistencia al desgaste y a la corrosión. El creciente interés por parte de la industria en reducir al máximo los costes (consumo de combustible, duración maquinaria, o la seguridad personal) ha fomentado la necesidad de investigar las posibles aplicaciones que las aleaciones ligeras pueden ofrecer. La reducción de peso es una razón por la cual los metales ligeros y sus aleaciones se han asociado con fuertes industrias como el transporte o la industria aeroespacial. Sin embargo, los aspectos de ahorro de peso no debe ocultar el hecho de que los metales ligeros poseen otras propiedades "tecnológicas" como la alta resistencia a la corrosión y alta conductividad eléctrica y térmica del aluminio, la mecanizabilidad de magnesio y la resistencia a la corrosión extrema de titanio. Hay que tener en cuenta que a pesar de estas propiedades de importancia tecnológica, debido a su densidad el aluminio y magnesio tienen una baja dureza y una baja resistencia al desgaste, lo que provoca la necesidad de mejorar sus propiedades superficiales. El objetivo principal ha sido la obtención y optimización de recubrimientos de Ti 6 Al 4 V y de acero inoxidable 316 L sobre aleaciones ligeras a través del uso de técnicas de proyección térmica, concretamente la proyección fría (Cold Gas Spray), que permite obtener recubrimientos densos y sin rastros de oxidación manteniendo la microestructura original de los materiales de partida, tanto los sustratos como los polvos de proyección.

Se ha mejorado la resistencia al desgaste en un 300 % con respecto a los sustratos de partida, y la resistencia a la corrosión de los sustratos empleados debido a la formación de recubrimientos completamente densos. También se han obtenido de forma experimental indicios que confirman las teorías de enlace establecidas hasta el momento para el proceso de proyección fría, entre las partículas y el sustrato así como entre las propias partículas depositadas...|$|E
40|$|In load-following {{power plants}} it is {{necessary}} to adjust the electrical output to the demand within adequate time. When a steam turbine is used in a load-following power plant the availability of the plant is mainly limited by the thermal cycling behaviour of the steam turbine. Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) offer the potential to increase the operational flexibility of steam turbines. When applied to a turbine, TBCs may alter the temperature regime of components in a way that enables to shorten the start-up / shut-down procedure. Such an improvement would make load-following steam power plants more flexible in terms of electricity output. In the present study the suitability of atmospheric plasma sprayed thermal barrier coating systems for steam turbine applications was investigated. Coating systems consisted of a metallic bondcoat for oxidation protection, a ceramic TBC for thermal insulation and a metallic topcoat for erosion protection. The substrates on which the coatings were applied were ferritic / martensitic 1 %Cr and 10 %Cr-steels and the Ni-base alloy Nimonic 80 A. The investigated bondcoats were Ni 20 Cr, Fe 22 Cr and a CoNiCrAlY coating. The TBCs consisted of ZrO 2 / 7 wt%Y 2 O 3. The topcoat was Ni 20 Cr. The coating systems were tested at ambient pressure in Ar- 50 %H 2 O at 550 to 700 °C for up to 10000 h. TBCs were found to be stable under the investigated conditions. The bondcoat microstructure strongly depended on the plasma spraying parameters and particle size of the <b>spraying</b> <b>powder.</b> On the ferritic / martensitic steels CoNiCrAlY coatings showed the best performance during high temperature exposure. No cracks or delamination were observed. Submicrometer thin, protective Al 2 O 3 scales formed, which were found to prevent interdiffusion between the bondcoat and the substrate material. Ni 20 Cr and Fe 22 Cr bondcoats showed more oxide formation than CoNiCrAlY coatings. Also, interdiffusion with the substrate material occurred. On the Nimonic 80 A substrate only Ni 20 Cr and Fe 22 Cr bondcoats were investigated. The Ni 20 Cr bondcoat showed best oxidation resistance and almost totally suppressed substrate oxidation. No TBC damage or coating delamination was observed on Ni 20 Cr. The Ni 20 Cr topcoats formed cracks propagating in the underlying ceramic thus causing significant TBC damage. The reason for the crack formation are the mechanical stresses which develop when the topcoats cool down to room temperature after plasma spraying...|$|E

Methods: The sCT-CS-NPs were prepared by the ionic gelation method using sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP) as a cross-linking polyion. Inhalable dry powders were obtained by co-spray drying aqueous dispersion of sCT-CS-NPs and mannitol. sCT-CS-NPs co-spray dried powders were characterized with respect to morphology, particle size, powder density, aerodynamic diameter, protein integrity, in vitro release of sCT, and aerosolization. The plasmatic sCT levels following intratracheal administration of sCT-CS-NPs <b>spray</b> dried <b>powders</b> to the rats was also determined. Results: sCT-CS-NPs were able to be incorporated into mannitol forming inhalable microparticles by the spray drying process. The sCT-CS-NPs/mannitol ratios and spray drying process affected the properties of the microparticles obtained. The conformation of the secondary structures of sCTs was affected by both mannitol content and spray dry inlet temperature. The sCT-CS-NPs were recovered after reconstitution of <b>spray</b> dried <b>powders</b> in an aqueous medium. The sCT release profile from <b>spray</b> dried <b>powders</b> was similar to that from sCT-CS-NPs. In vitro inhalation parameters measured by the Andersen cascade impactor indicated sCT-CS-NPs <b>spray</b> dried <b>powders</b> having promising aerodynamic properties for deposition in the deep lung. Determination of the plasmatic sCT levels following intratracheal administration to rats revealed that the inhalable sCT-CS NPs <b>spray</b> dried <b>powders</b> provided higher protein absorption compared to native sCT powders. Conclusion: The sCT-CS-NPs with mannitol based <b>spray</b> dried <b>powders</b> were prepared to have appropriate aerodynamic properties for pulmonary delivery. The developed system was able to deliver sCT via a pulmonary route into the systemic circulation.

It is also used in the manufacture of plastic food wrap and similar products to help prevent pieces of plastic from sticking together because of static electricity.|$|R
25|$|Another crucial {{preventive}} measure {{is the use}} of persistent acaricides, such as topical repellents or pesticides that contain triazapentadienes (Amitraz), phenylpyrazoles (Fipronil), or permethrin (pyrethroids). These acaricides target primarily the adult stages of Lyme-carrying ticks and reduce the number of reproductively active ticks in the environment. Formulations of these ingredients are available in a variety of topical forms, including spot-ons, <b>sprays,</b> <b>powders,</b> impregnated collars, solutions, and shampoos.|$|R
