50|$|<b>Explosives</b> <b>safety</b> {{originated}} as {{a formal}} {{program in the}} United States {{in the aftermath of}} World War I when several ammunition storage areas were destroyed in a series of mishaps. The most serious occurred at Picatinny Arsenal Ammunition Storage Depot, New Jersey, in July, 1926 when an electrical storm led to fires that caused explosions and widespread destruction. The severe property damage and 19 fatalities led Congress to empower a board of Army and Naval officers to investigate the Picatinny Arsenal disaster and determine if similar conditions existed at other ammunition depots. The board reported in its findings that this mishap could recur, prompting Congress to establish a permanent board of colonels to develop <b>explosives</b> <b>safety</b> standards and ensure compliance beginning in 1928. This organization evolved into the Department of Defense <b>Explosives</b> <b>Safety</b> Board (DDESB) and is chartered in Title 10 of the US Code. Today, the DDESB authors DOD Manual 6055.9, Ammunition and <b>Explosives</b> <b>Safety</b> Standards. It also evaluates scientific data which may adjust those standards, reviews and approves all explosives site plans for new construction, and conducts worldwide visits to locations containing US title munitions.|$|R

40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) has {{recognized}} that safety assurance requires {{a balance of}} institutional and engineering approaches {{as part of an}} ongoing safety process. This recognition formed the basis for a new approach to nuclear <b>explosive</b> <b>safety</b> with a focus on the inherent value of the examination process, as opposed to an absolute justification of the nuclear explosive operation against some preddined acceptance criteria. This new approach to safety is reflected in recent DOE Orders and Standards in that there is no requirement that quantitative risk assessment or risk quantification be used in meeting requirements. Furthermore, there is no requirement to compare hazard and accident analysis results against numerical acceptance criteria.
