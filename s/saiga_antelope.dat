5|$|In Siberia, {{the main}} prey species are Manchurian wapiti and wild boar (the two species {{comprising}} nearly 80% of the prey selected) followed by sika deer, moose, roe deer, and musk deer. Asiatic black bears and Ussuri brown bears may also {{fall prey to}} tigers, and they constitute up to 40.7% of the diet of Siberian tigers depending on local conditions and the bear populations. In Sumatra, prey include sambar deer, muntjac, wild boar, Malayan tapir and orangutan. In the former Caspian tiger's range, prey included <b>saiga</b> <b>antelope,</b> camels, Caucasian wisent, yak, and wild horses. Like many predators, tigers are opportunistic and may eat much smaller prey, such as monkeys, peafowl and other ground-based birds, hares, porcupines, and fish.|$|E

The researchers also supported the loops acting as a resonance chamber, comparable to the enlongated nasal passages of <b>saiga</b> <b>antelope</b> and looping trachea of cranes and swans. Reconstructions of the inner ear suggest adaptation to hearing at low frequencies, such as the low-toned resonant sounds possibly produced by the nasal passages.

25|$|The {{collapse}} of the Marxist-Leninist government in the country had a significant influence on the average Russian's economic ability to maintain his or her family. Because of the large population of bears in Russia and an increasing demand for bear parts, especially bile, poaching of bears became increasingly popular. Its main trade partners in bear parts are primarily nearby Asian countries like South Korea and the People's Republic of China. Poaching of the snow leopard is also a serious problem in Russia along with Afghanistan, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, People’s Republic of China, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. The situation for antelopes has deteriorated significantly since the {{collapse of}} the Soviet system. There has been increase in poaching of the <b>saiga</b> <b>antelope</b> which reduced the saiga population in the country.|$|E
25|$|Differences in {{the social}} {{structure}} and marking behavior among different species {{may lead to a}} different size and position of the preorbital glands on the animal's face. For example, Günther's dik-dik (Madoqua guentheri) is a monogamous species of antelope that lives in a permanent territory, the boundaries of which the animals mark several times a day by actively pressing the preorbital glands to grasses and low-lying plants and applying the secretions. In this territorial animal, the preorbital glands remain of considerable size throughout the year. The glands are located in large preorbital pits in the lacrimal bone, and are surrounded by specialized facial muscles that compress them to express the secretions more effectively. In contrast, the <b>saiga</b> <b>antelope</b> (Saiga tatarica) is a polygamous and somewhat nomadic species which does not occupy any permanent territory {{at any time during the}} year. For most of the year the preorbital glands remain small, only growing to substantial size during the rut. At that time of year, secretions ooze more or less continuously from the glands. In this nonterritorial animal, the preorbital glands are not as well-developed, lack well-developed surrounding facial muscles, and are positioned in an inconspicuous and shallow depression of the lacrimal bone.|$|E
25|$|In the Late Pleistocene, Beringia was {{a mosaic}} of {{biological}} communities. Commencing from BP (MIS 3), steppe–tundra vegetation dominated large parts of Beringia with a rich diversity of grasses and herbs. There were patches of shrub tundra with isolated refugia of larch (Larix) and spruce (Picea) forests with birch (Betula) and alder (Alnus) trees. It has been proposed that {{the largest and most}} diverse megafaunal community residing in Beringia at this time could only have been sustained in a highly diverse and productive environment. Analysis at Chukotka on the Siberian edge of the land bridge indicated that from BP (MIS 3 to MIS 2) the environment was wetter and colder than the steppe–tundra to the east and west, with warming in parts of Beringia from BP. These changes provided the most likely explanation for mammal migrations after BP, as the warming provided increased forage for browsers and mixed feeders. Beringia did not block the movement of most dry steppe-adapted large species such as <b>saiga</b> <b>antelope,</b> woolly mammoth, and caballid horses. However, from the west the woolly rhino went no further east than the Anadyr River, and from the east North American camels, the American kiang-like equids, the short-faced bear, bonnet-horned muskoxen, and badger did not travel west. At the beginning of the Holocene, some mesic habitat-adapted species left the refugium and spread westward into what had become tundra-vegetated northern Asia and eastward into northern North America.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. <b>Saiga</b> <b>antelopes</b> (<b>Saiga</b> tatarica), {{presently}} {{confined to}} Central Asia, spread westward to England and eastward to the Northwest Territories of Canada {{during the late}} Pleistocene. Two saiga cranial fragments from the Yukon Territory and the Northwest Territories have yielded radiocarbon dates of 13 390 ± 180 and 14 920 ± 160 B. P. respectively. Thus, saigas occupied the easternmost part of their known Pleistocene range toward {{the close of the}} Wisconsinan glaciation. Saigas probably died out between 13 000 and 10 000 years ago in North America because of rapid changes in climate and plantscapes occurring about that time, as former steppe-like terrain was replaced by spruce forest and tundra...|$|R

25|$|Of {{wild species}} of ungulate, deer are the {{preferred}} prey family. In {{a study in}} the Italian Alps, the most common prey species of all was the European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), which made up 32.2% of nest remains. The roe deer was also a prominent prey item in the French Pyrenees (14.9%) and Switzerland (14.6%), respectively. In several parts of the Scottish Highlands, red deer (Cervus elaphus) are eaten with some regularity, the maximum representation there being 22.3% of prey remains in the Northwest Highlands. In North America, several deer species, but mainly mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) fawns, were significant in the diet in Washington state (14.3%) and California (12.7%). Around the Himalayas, the small white-bellied musk deer (Moschus leucogaster) is reportedly a favorite prey item (though no quantitative analysis are known). In the near Arctic regions of Scandinavia, reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) of both semi-domestic and wild stock are fed on with some regularity; one study in northern Sweden found reindeer formed 11.4% of prey items. In the northernmost stretches of Alaska, golden eagles are more scarce than in equivalent areas of Scandinavia and only occasionally hunt wild reindeer. However, golden eagles were reportedly the most prolific predator of neonatal calves from the Porcupine caribou (Rangifer tarandus granti) herd of central Alaska. Partial moose (Alces alces) remains have been found at a nest in Sweden. Live fawns and carrion probably comprise most of the golden eagle's consumption of deer (certainly in larger-bodied species such as red deer). Among wild bovids, eagles are reportedly the main predator of <b>Saiga</b> <b>antelope</b> (Saiga tatarica) calves in Mongolia and are regularly reported to take chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra) and Alpine ibex (Capra ibex) calves in Europe. Mongolian gazelles (Procapra gutturosa) comprised about 15% of the remains found at a nest in Mongolia. Up to seven wild species of goat, five other wild species of sheep and at least two wild gazelle species are confirmed golden eagle prey. In North America, pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) are occasionally hunted.|$|E
25|$|Proponents for wolf hunting often {{point out}} the {{apparently}} adverse effects large wolf populations have on game herds. An example occurred in 2008, in which the Alaska Board of Game approved plans calling for department staff to shoot wolves from helicopters on the southern Alaska Peninsula in order to assist {{the survival of the}} Southern Alaska Peninsula Caribou Herd. Wolves were believed to be responsible for a dramatic drop in the Southern Alaska Caribou Herd's population, which once numbered up to 10,000 in 1983, only to drop to a population of 600 animals in 2008. Wolf predation was also believed to be responsible for virtually no calves surviving for the two years prior the culling plans, despite a 70% pregnancy rate. In the former Soviet Union, depending on the locality, a single wolf can consume 90 saiga, 50-80 wild boar or an average of 50 domestic or wild caribou annually. A pack of 2-5 wolves will often kill 2 caribou every three days. Further reports from the former Soviet Union indicate that rather than prey on exclusively sick or infirm prey, wolves seem to attack young or pregnant animals far more frequently, regardless of their sanitary state. In the Nenetskij National Okrug, wolves were shown to select pregnant female domestic caribou and calves rather than infirm specimens, with some reports showing that wolves bypassed emaciated, sickly animals in favour of well fed ones. Large numbers of wolves have also been blamed on the decline of critically endangered <b>saiga</b> <b>antelope</b> herds in Central Asia. During the late 1950s and early 1960s when the Soviet Union used poison to effectively bring down wolf numbers, the number, as well as the range of moose, wild boar and red deer increased. Caspian seals were valued as fur bearers in the Soviet industry, and in a three-week period in February 1978, wolves were responsible for the wanton killing of numerous seals on the Caspian sea near Astrakhan. Between 17-40% of the seals in the area were estimated to have been killed, but not eaten.|$|E

5000|$|Biologist Murat Nurushev {{suggested}} that the cause might be acute ruminal tympany, whose symptoms (bloating, mouth foaming and diarrhea) had been observed in dead <b>saiga</b> <b>antelopes.</b> According to Nurushev, this disease occurred {{as a result of}} foraging on a large amount of easily fermenting plants (alfalfa, clover, sainfoins and mixed wet green grass).

Illustrations of <b>saiga</b> <b>antelopes</b> can be found among the cave paintings that were dated back to seventh-fifth century B.C. Moreover, saiga bones were found among the remains of other wild animals near the human settlements. The fragmented information shows an abundance of saigas on the territory of modern Kazakhstan in the 14th-16th centuries. The migratory routes ranged throughout the country's area, especially the region between Volga and Ural rivers was heavily populated. The population's size remained high until {{the second half of the}} 19th century when excessive horn export began. The high price and demand for horns drove radical hunting. The number of animals decreased in all regions and the migratory routes shifted southward.|$|R
50|$|In its {{original}} habitat, the hortaya borzaya is still purely a hunting sight hound. It {{is used on}} all game living in the steppe, especially for hunting hares, foxes, wolves and <b>Saiga</b> <b>antelopes.</b> It is extremely enduring, capable of working from early morning to late evening. Up to 8 - 10 runs on game in a day (including tracking prey together with the hunter across large distances) is a perfectly feasible workload. Unlike the Whippet or Greyhound, the hortaya is not a short distance sprinter. Game is usually chased for distances up to 4 km on the open steppe, and a hortaya can repeat such runs after only a short rest. Unlike most sight hounds, the hortaya does not hunt using sight alone; it often will track game it has lost sight of using its well-developed sense of smell.|$|R
25|$|Concerns {{have also}} arisen {{over the use}} of {{pangolin}} scales, turtle plastron, seahorses, and the gill plates of mobula and manta rays.

Fewer than 30,000 <b>saiga</b> <b>antelopes</b> remain, which are exported to China for use in traditional fever therapies. Organized gangs illegally export the horn of the antelopes to China.

40|$|We {{report the}} results of the first {{serological}} survey for bluetongue virus in Kazakhstan. We analysed blood samples collected from 958 livestock and 513 wild <b>saiga</b> <b>antelopes</b> over a large area of the country, and found 23. 2 % seroprevalence in livestock and 0 % in saigas. Seroprevalence in livestock did not vary by species, but increased significantly with age. There was no evidence for variation in seroprevalence at the regional level, but there was significant clustering at the farm level. Bluetongue has never before been reported in Kazakhstan, yet our results suggest that it may be endemic. We found seropositive animals at the furthest known northern limits of the bluetongue virus in this region of the world. Recorded vectors are not known to be present in Kazakhstan, so a novel vector is likely to be operating. The lack of evidence for bluetongue virus in saigas is unexpected and suggests a need for further investigation. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
5000|$|Other {{species have}} evolved {{internal}} inflatable air spaces {{connected to the}} vocal tract, which {{play a role in}} vocal tract resonance.

40|$|A {{transmission}} {{model was}} devised for trichostrongyloid nematodes of <b>saiga</b> <b>antelopes</b> and domestic sheep in Kazakhstan. The framework extends previous models by including seasonal migration of saigas, contact with separate populations of sheep, and climate-driven stochasticity in herbage biomass {{and in the}} development, survival and migration onto herbage of free-living larvae. The model was parameterised for the contrasting life histories of Marshallagia, Haemonchus and Nematodirus, three important parasites of saigas and sheep in the region, and was successful at predicting broad qualitative patterns of infection dynamics in sheep and saigas. Parasite transmission between saigas and sheep was predicted to be most important for Marshallagia (from sheep to saigas {{in the south in}} winter, and onward transmission to sheep in the north in summer) and Haemonchus (from sheep in the north in summer via saigas to sheep further south in autumn). Model predictions for winter transmission of Marshallagia infection in saigas were consistent with field data, which showed that saigas culled before they have grazed the winter range carry lower burdens of this parasite than older animals. The model provides a mechanistic explanation for its predictions, which will assist hypothesis formation, and further the epidemiological basis of efforts to control parasite transmission between wildlife and livestock in both directions. A similar modelling approach could prove useful in other situations where detailed mechanistic models of parasite transmission are inappropriate in the face of parameter uncertainty and spatio-temporal variation in climate and host density. This is likely to include the majority of wildlife-parasite systems. ...|$|R
