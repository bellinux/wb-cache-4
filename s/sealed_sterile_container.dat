40|$|Background. Identifying the {{microorganism}} in {{a prosthetic}} joint infection {{is the key}} to appropriately targeting antimicrobial treatment. Despite the availability of various techniques, no single test is considered the definitive gold standard. Aim. Our aim was to determine the sensitivity, specificity, and positive/negative predictive values for a variety of culture techniques. Methods. We performed a retrospective case series of 219 patients undergoing revision surgery of their hip or knee replacement between May 2004 and February 2013. The patients were classified as either infected or noninfected according to criteria set out by the Musculoskeletal Infection Society. The number and type of samples taken intraoperatively varied between cases but included tissue samples and fluid sent in either blood culture vials or <b>sterile</b> <b>containers.</b> Results. The highest sensitivity was found with blood culture vials (0. 85) compared to fluid in <b>sterile</b> <b>containers</b> (0. 26) and tissues samples (0. 32). Blood culture vials also had a better specificity and positive and negative predictive values profile. Conclusion. We conclude that, of the techniques studied, fluid in blood culture vials had the best profile for the correct identification of microorganisms and advocate its use...|$|R

This device also ensures that none of the sample is lost when transferring it from one container to another.|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} obtain {{mechanically}} stimulated saliva, {{the participants were asked}} to chew onto a piece of tubing (200 mm cut pieces of 1.6 mm bore, 1.4 mm wall platinum cured silicone tubing) for 1 minute and then expectorate the first component while keeping the tubing in the mouth. The participants expectorated the saliva into a pre-labelled <b>sterile</b> <b>container</b> once every 30 seconds while chewing onto the tubing until an adequate volume (~ 2 mL of saliva) was collected. The samples were then immediately placed on ice to minimise bacterial degradation of salivary proteins until further processing. In order to collect acid stimulated saliva, food-grade citric acid (0.25 %, supermarket grade) was prepared and participants were asked to swirl 5 mL of the citric acid solution in the mouth for 15 seconds and then expectorate into a waste container. This procedure was repeated. The participants were then asked to pool saliva in their mouth and expectorate every 30 seconds into a pre-labelled <b>sterile</b> <b>container</b> until ~ 2 mL of saliva was collected and processed on ice similar to the above procedure. Salivary flow rate was calculated by dividing the saliva volume (mL, measured using a pipette) by the time (mins) it took to produce the volume of saliva measured.|$|R
