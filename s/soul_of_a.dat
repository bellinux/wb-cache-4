5|$|In desperation, Mary {{decides to}} tell the truth to Gopalam and Ammi. To save their jobs, Rao makes up a far-fetched story that Mary is possessed by the <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Christian woman named after the mother of Jesus. Gopalam lies that he will marry Sita off to Rao. Raju, like Gopalam, is unaware of Rao's deception. In love with Sita, he wants to keep Rao away from her and turns to Mary for help in {{teaching}} music (which ends in disaster). At the end of their first month at the school, Rao and Mary receive their salaries and Mary repays her debt.|$|E
5|$|The last Hindu {{function}} for Hell-based reincarnations is the text Preta khanda in the Garuda Purana used by Hindu priests during Śrāddha rituals. During these rituals, the <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dying or deceased individual is given safe passage {{into the next}} life. This ritual {{is directly related to}} the economic prosperity of Hindu priests and their ability to “save” the dying soul from a hellish reincarnation through gifts given on behalf of the deceased to the priest performing the ritual. With each gift given, crimes committed during the deceased's life are forgiven and the next life is progressively improved.|$|E
5|$|According to Hinduism, {{the souls}} of three {{preceding}} generations of one's ancestor reside in Pitru–loka, a realm between heaven and earth. This realm is governed by Yama, the god of death, who takes the <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dying man from earth to Pitru–loka. When a person {{of the next generation}} dies, the first generation shifts to heaven and unites with God, so Shraddha offerings are not given. Thus, only the three generations in Pitru–loka are given Shraddha rites, in which Yama plays a significant role. According to the sacred Hindu epics, at the beginning of Pitru Paksha, the sun enters the zodiac sign of Libra (Tula). Coinciding with this moment, it is believed that the spirits leave Pitru–loka and reside in their descendants' homes for a month until the sun enters the next zodiacScorpio (Vrichchhika)and there is a full moon. Hindus are expected to propitiate the ancestors in the first half, during the dark fortnight.|$|E

5|$|Her first magical mentor was the Irish occultist and Freemason Theodore Moriarty. She had befriended {{him while}} still {{involved}} in psychotherapy, believing {{that he could}} help one of her patients, {{a young man who}} had been fighting on the Western Front and claimed to be plagued by unexplained physical phenomena. Moriarty performed an exorcism, claiming that the young man was the victim of the <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> deceased East European soldier which had latched onto him as a parasite. Fortune became an acolyte of Moriarty's Masonic-influenced lodge, which was based in Hammersmith, and joined his community of followers living at Gwen Stafford-Allen's home in Bishop's Stortford. Moriarty spent much time talking about the lost city of Atlantis, a topic that would also come to be embraced by Fortune. Fortune later fictionalised Moriarty as the character Dr. Taverner, who appeared in a number of short stories first published in 1922, later assembled in a collected volume as The Secrets of Dr. Taverner in 1926. Like Moriarty, Dr. Taverner was portrayed as carrying out exorcisms to protect humans from the attacks of etheric vampires.|$|E

25|$|Fan opinion {{has been}} divided {{as to whether}} Ross Robinson's {{production}} properly captured {{the intricacies of the}} band's sound.

25|$|<b>Soul</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> New Machine (1992), {{which was}} {{recorded}} with producer Colin Richardson, gave the band greater exposure {{in the music}} scene. It was considered revolutionary for its industrial death metal sound that combined Bell's harsh and melodic vocals, Herrera's machine-like battery, the integrated industrial samples and textures and the sharp, down-tuned, rhythmic, death metal riffs of Dino Cazares. Cazares and Herrera wrote all the music. Because the band had no bass player, Cazares played both guitar and bass on the recording.|$|E
25|$|To {{promote the}} album, Fear Factory {{embarked}} on extensive U.S. tours with Biohazard, Sepultura, and Sick Of It All. During this period, sampler-keyboardist Reynor Diego joined the group.

The following year, they hired Front Line Assembly member Rhys Fulber to remix some {{songs from the}} album, demonstrating the band's willingness to experiment with their music. The results took on a predominantly industrial guise, and were released as the Fear Is the Mindkiller EP (1993). <b>Soul</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> New Machine and Fear is the Mindkiller were released (2004) as a package in a new re-mastered reissue by Roadrunner Records.|$|E
25|$|It {{is thought}} that the <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{deceased}} person {{is made up of}} yin and yang components called hun and po (魂 and 魄). The yin component, po, is associated with the grave, and the yang component, hun, is associated with ancestral tablets . At death the components split into three different souls; the po stays with the body to the grave, another goes to judgment, and the hun resides in an ancestral tablet. The po and hun are not immortal and need to be nourished by offerings made by descendants. Eventually both the po and hun go to the underworld, although the hun goes to heaven first. Unlike in western usages of the term, underworld has no negative connotation.|$|E
