40|$|We study various {{properties}} of the Z(3) interface which forms between the different ordered phases of pure SU(3) gauge theory above a critical temperature. We simulate the theory on a computational lattice of two space and one time dimensions, at various temperatures above this critical point. At high temperatures, we perform an accurate measurement of the interface tension, which shows good agreement with the prediction of perturbation theory. Near the critical temperature, we show {{that it is possible}} to observe the behaviour of the interface amidst the phase turbulence near its collapse, and we characterise its fluctuations in terms of various displacement moments. We show that the interface behaves like a fluctuating string, and model its behaviour in terms of an interacting scalar field theory. We also examine other {{properties of}} the interface, including its intrinsic and Debye electric <b>screening</b> <b>widths,</b> its formation and movement on the lattice, and its wetting.

40|$|In-space {{propulsion}} often necessitates {{the use of}} {{a capillary}} liquid acquisition device (LAD) to assure that gas-free liquid propellant is available to support engine restarts in microgravity. If a capillary screen-channel device is chosen, then the designer must determine the appropriate combination screen mesh and channel geometry. A screen mesh selection which results in the smallest LAD width when compared to any other screen candidate (for a constant length) is desirable; however, no best screen exists for all LAD design requirements. Flow rate, percent fill, and acceleration are the most influential drivers for determining <b>screen</b> <b>widths.</b> Increased flow rates and reduced percent fills increase the through-the-screen flow pressure losses, which drive the LAD to increased <b>widths</b> regardless of <b>screen</b> choice. Similarly, increased acceleration levels and corresponding liquid head pressures drive the screen mesh selection toward a higher bubble point (liquid retention capability). After ruling out some screens on the basis of acceleration requirements alone, candidates can be identified by examining screens with small flow-loss-to-bubble point ratios for a given condition (i. e., comparing screens at certain flow rates and fill levels). Within the same flow rate and fill level, the screen constants inertia resistance coefficient, void fraction, screen pore or opening diameter, and bubble point can become the driving forces in identifying the smaller flow-loss-to-bubble point ratios...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis was to produce a web {{application}} for ordering food (pizzas) online. The thesis mainly focuses on providing the most effective sales possible. For that reason we built a special mechanism for automatic categorisation of pizzas in different categories, which combined with data on a user's past purchases provided a selection of the most appropriate pizzas for that specific user. The {{first part of the}} thesis describes the technologies and tools used. In developing the application PHP scripting language and other online technologies were used (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX and SQL), as well as libraries and tools (jQuery, Twitter Bootstrap and others). MySQL database was used for data storage. The second part describes the development of the web application from the idea, design and production {{to the use of the}} final product. The website is composed of a fore-end and back-end part of the web application, which enables different types of users to use the website. It is built in such a way that it is responsive to different <b>screen</b> <b>widths.</b> The thesis in detail describes the algorithm for pizza categorisations and suggestions, which is the main advantage of the application. The final part provides a comparison of the website with similar websites, an analysis of the application and concludes with an overview of the work done, the main problem in development and the idea for future work...|$|R

50|$|A common variant on this {{resolution}} is 1360×768, which confers several technical benefits, most significantly {{a reduction in}} memory requirements from just over to just under 1 MB per 8-bit channel (1366×768 needs 1024.5 KB per channel; 1360×768 needs 1020 KB; 1 MB is equal to 1024 KB), which simplifies architecture and can significantly reduce the amount - and speed - of VRAM required with only a very minor change in available resolution, as memory chips are usually only available in fixed megabyte capacities. For example, at 32-bit color, a 1360×768 framebuffer would require only 4 MB, whilst a 1366×768 one may need 5, 6 or even 8 MB depending on the exact display circuitry architecture and available chip capacities. The 6-pixel reduction also means each line's width is divisible by 8 pixels, simplifying numerous routines used in both computer and broadcast/theatrical video processing, which operate on 8-pixel blocks. Historically, many video cards also mandated <b>screen</b> <b>widths</b> divisible by 8 for their lower-color, planar modes to accelerate memory accesses and simplify pixel position calculations (e.g. fetching 4-bit pixels from 32-bit memory is much faster when performed 8 pixels at a time, and calculating exactly where a particular pixel is within a memory block is much easier when lines do not end partway through a memory word), and this convention still persisted in low-end hardware even into {{the early days of}} widescreen, LCD HDTVs; thus, most 1366-width displays also quietly support display of 1360-width material, with a thin border of unused pixel columns at each side. This narrower mode is of course even further removed from the 16:9 ideal, but the error is still less than 0.5% (technically, the mode is either 15.94:9.00 or 16.00:9.04) and should be imperceptible.|$|R

Typical Web pages divide the screen into a menu area for navigation and a content area to display information. The Golden Section can be applied to decide on the proportion of these two areas on the screen when designing this type of page. Using a computer-controlled experiment, we examined the role of aesthetics in the use of Web pages. Ninety-eight participants completed an information retrieval task. Analysis of variance showed that the effect of <b>screen</b> ratio (<b>width</b> of menu area to content area) on task performance and subjective outcomes was statistically significant. Application of the Golden Section was found to result in the worst screen ratio.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Turbidity, {{dynamic light}} scattering, and electrophoretic {{mobility}} {{were used to}} {{study the effects of}} added salt on coacervation in the system composed of the strong cationic polymer poly-(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDADMAC) and oppositely charged mixed micelles of Triton X- 100 (TX 100) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The phase behavior in the range of ionic strengths from 0. 05 to 0. 60 M includes regimes of soluble complex formation, coacervation, and precipitation. The corresponding phase boundaries are determined from differential turbidity curves. The shift of the phase boundaries to higher ratios of SDS:TX 100 with increase in salt concentration is explained on the basis of electrostatic <b>screening.</b> The <b>width</b> of the coacervation region is found to increase with ionic strength. These observations are consistent with previous reports of the “salt suppression ” and “salt enhancement ” of coacervation. In the coacervation region, the electrophoretic mobility is found to be close to zero. At higher and lower ionic strengths, soluble complexes are positively or negatively charged, respectively. It is suggested that the principal factor governing coacervation in this system is electroneutrality of the polyion-micelle complex which in turn depends on the charge and number of bound micelles...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of ionized impurity scattering on the hole mobility in d-doped-channel AlGaAs-InGaAs quantum wells is investigated. Improvements {{by a factor}} of 2. 5 were observed experimentally when moving a d-doped impurity plane across the quantum well towards an interface, highlighting the scope of selective doping and wave-function engineering techniques to enhance the transport mobility of such devices. Theoretical hole mobility calculations were performed and reveal an overestimation of the transport mobility, common to the random-phase approximation (RPA), that is much stronger for p-type structures than for n-type structures. This effect is partially attributed to an underestimation of the <b>screening</b> charge distribution <b>width.</b> Using a lower limit for this distribution of around 50 Å, it is shown that the RPA can provide accurate predictions between samples with different impurity distributions and densities...|$|R
