[...] For many years he lived in Kilburn, London, as the flatmate of novelist Robert Hudson. In 2007, he was best man at Robert Webb's wedding to Abigail Burdess.|$|E

[...] Fisher knew that the FBI's use of his rank could have only come from Häyhänen.

Steevens, according to Evelyn Wenner, who has studied the history of the Boydell edition, was [...] "at first an ardent advocate of the plan" [...] but [...] "soon realized that the editor of this text must in the very scheme of things give way to painters, publishers and engravers". He was also ultimately disappointed in the quality of the prints, but he <b>said</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> jeopardize the edition's sales. Steevens, who had already edited two complete Shakespeare editions, was not asked to edit the text anew; instead, he picked which version of the text to reprint.

As two of Britain's most flamboyant, {{outrageous}} and best-loved entertainers, they shared {{much in common}} and instantly became close friends. Everett would {{play a major role}} in Queen's early success when, in 1975, armed with an advance copy of the single [...] "Bohemian Rhapsody", Mercury went to see Everett. While privately Everett doubted any station would play the song due to its length at over 6 minutes, he <b>said</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> Mercury and placed the song on the turntable, and, after hearing it, enthused: [...] "forget it, it's going to be number one for centuries". While Capital Radio hadn't officially accepted the song, the anarchic Everett would talk incessantly about a record he had but couldn't play, before the song [...] "accidentally" [...] started playing, with Everett stating: [...] "Oops, my finger must've slipped." [...] Capital's switchboard was jammed with callers wanting to know when the song was going to be released – on one occasion Everett aired the song 36 times in one day.|$|E

2500|$|However, Ellis, {{releasing}} a letter Monday evening {{that he sent}} Saturday to county Chief Operating Officer Robert W. Graf, denies violating the agreement. The letter, in part, states: [...] "As for Ms. Bradley and myself, that case was amicably closed April 1 and never violated by either party. As I told Ms. Jackson, I did mistakenly dial Ms. Bradley on her cell when trying to call someone with a very close number and I dialed too quickly...after four years, {{it was an old}} habit. Nothing was said and I immediately hung up when I realized my mistake. That happened one time in a month.

[...] Yet Duchamp did appear in the illustrations to Du [...] "Cubisme", he participated in the La Maison Cubiste (Cubist House), organized by the designer André Mare for the Salon d'Automne of 1912 (a few months after the Indépendants); he signed the Section d'Or invitation and participated in the Section d'Or exhibition during the fall of 1912. The impression is, Brooke writes, [...] "it was precisely because he wished to remain part of the group that he withdrew the painting; and that, far from being ill treated by the group, he was given a rather privileged position, probably through the patronage of Picabia".|$|E

2500|$|The mood aboard Bismarck was mixed. Seaman Adolf Eich was {{off duty}} for some fresh air. He climbed {{up to the}} bridge {{for as long as}} nobody stopped him. When he got there he found the {{atmosphere}} pleasant. Lindemann was shaking the hand of Adalbert Schneider for his Knight's Cross award bestowed upon him for the destruction of Hood. Lütjens also looked pleased. As the morning wore on the atmosphere changed. Müllenheim-Rechberg saw Lindemann wearing a life jacket and watched as the captain ate his breakfast in silence. He did not return Müllenheim-Rechberg's salute. Müllenheim-Rechberg also met Lütjens as the Admiral {{made his way to the}} bridge. Lütjens returned his salute as he brushed past but <b>said</b> <b>nothing.</b> <b>To</b> Müllenheim-Rechberg it seemed as if the two men most responsible for Bismarck had retreated into their own private worlds. That morning, on the 27 May 1941, Lütjens sent a request for a U-Boat to pick up the ship's war diary. In this last transmission, Lütjens included: [...] "Ship no longer manoeuvrable. We fight to the last shell. Long live the Führer". Lütjens did not hide their fate from his crew. He ordered the ships stores to be opened and allowed the crew to help themselves. It was a sign to all onboard Bismarck was doomed.|$|E
2500|$|Livingstone {{believed}} {{that he had a}} spiritual calling for exploration to find routes for commercial trade which would displace slave trade routes, rather than for preaching. He was encouraged by the response in Britain to his discoveries and support for future expeditions, so he resigned from the London Missionary Society in 1857. According to his Victorian biographer W. Garden Blaikie, the reason was to prevent public concerns that his non-missionary activities such as his scientific work might show the LMS to be [...] "departing from the proper objects of a missionary body". Livingstone had written to the directors of the society to express complaints about their policies and the clustering of too many missionaries near the Cape Colony, despite the sparse native population. [...] Blaikie, not wishing to offend Livingstone's relatives, still living in 1880 when his book was published, concealed the real reason why Livingstone left the LMS and the manner of it. In a letter from the directors of the LMS, which Livingstone received at Quelimane, he was congratulated on his journey but was told that the directors were [...] "restricted in their power of aiding plans connected only remotely with the spread of the Gospel". This brusque rejection of his plan for new mission stations north of the Zambesi and his wider object of opening the interior via the Zambezi, was not enough to make him resign at once. When he was approached by Roderick Murchison, president of the Royal Geographical Society, who put him in touch with the Foreign Secretary, Livingstone <b>said</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> the LMS directors, even when his leadership of a government expedition to the Zambezi seemed increasingly likely to be funded by the Exchequer. [...] "I am not yet fairly on with the Government," [...] he told a friend, [...] "but am nearly quite off with the Society (LMS)." [...] And while he negotiated with the government, he deceived the LMS into thinking that he would return to Africa with their mission to the Kololo in Barotseland, which Livingstone had used his national fame to coerce them into initiating against their better judgement. As biographer Tim Jeal shows in Chapter 12 of his biography, the end result would be the death of a missionary and his wife, the death of a second missionary's wife and the deaths of three children from malaria. Livingstone had suffered over thirty attacks during his journey but had deliberately understated his suffering so not to discourage the LMS from sending missionaries to the Kololo. Consequently the missionaries had set out for a marshy region with wholly inadequate supplies of quinine and they had soon weakened and died.|$|E
