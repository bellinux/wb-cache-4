5|$|In the Sybertsville quadrangle, the <b>surficial</b> geology in {{the valley}} of Little Wapwallopen Creek mainly {{consists}} of alluvium, alluvial terrace, alluvial fan, Wisconsinan Ice-Contact Stratified Drift, and some small patches of Wisconsinan Till. The <b>surficial</b> geology on the valley slopes and uplands mainly consists of bedrock. In the quadrangle of Freeland, the <b>surficial</b> geology near Little Wapwallopen Creek mainly features Wisconsinan Till, Wisconsinan Ice-Contact Stratified Drift, and alluvium. The <b>surficial</b> geology near the creek in the Wilkes-Barre West quadrangle mainly consists of Wisconsinan Till, with some scattered areas of bedrock and alluvium.|$|E
5|$|Near its mouth, the <b>surficial</b> geology in the {{vicinity}} of Nanticoke Creek mainly consists of alluvium (which mainly consists of stratified silt, sand, and gravel, with some boulders), Wisconsinan Outwash (which contains stratified sand and gravel), and urban land (which is highly disrupted by cut and fill). Further upstream, the <b>surficial</b> geology mainly consists of coal dumps and surface mining land (both of which are rich in rick waste), as well as a glacial or resedimented till known as Wisconsinan Till, and bedrock consisting of sandstone and shale. The upper reaches of the creek mainly are around <b>surficial</b> geology consisting of surface mining land, bedrock, and Wisconsinan Till.|$|E
5|$|All of Florida's {{abundant}} {{fresh water}} {{is the result of}} precipitation that returns to the atmosphere in a process called evapotranspiration that involves evaporation and transpiration of moisture from plants. As rains fall, most of the water is directed to lakes, streams, and rivers. However, a significant amount of fresh water is held underground but close to the surface in aquifers. A <b>surficial</b> aquifer consisting mostly of clay, shells, and sand is over a confining layer of denser materials. Wells are drilled in the <b>surficial</b> aquifer, which supplies better quality water in areas where the deepest aquifer has a high mineral content. Occasionally the confining layer is fractured to allow breaches of water to percolate down to recharge the layer below. The Floridan Aquifer, underneath the confining layer, underlies the entire state and portions of Georgia, Alabama, and South Carolina. It is particularly accessible {{in the northern part of}} Florida, serving as the fresh water source of metropolitan areas from St. Petersburg north to Jacksonville and Tallahassee.|$|E
5|$|In {{its lower}} reaches, the <b>surficial</b> geology in the {{vicinity}} of Shickshinny Creek consists of urban land highly disrupted by cut and fill, alluvium, alluvial terrace, fill, Wisconsinan Ice-Contact Stratified Drift containing stratified sand and gravel, Wisconsinan Ice-Contact Delta containing sand and gravel, Wisconsinan Bouldery Till (a glaicial or resedimented till containing boulders, and bedrock consisting of sandstone and shale. The bedrock mainly occurs on the mountains {{in this part of the}} watershed. In the middle reaches of the creek, the <b>surficial</b> geology mainly features bedrock consisting of sandstone and shale, alluvium, and a glacial or resedimented till known as Wisconsinan Till. Some Wisconsinan Outwash and alluvial terrace is also present near Koonsville. Some patches of Wisconsinan Bouldery Till and wetlands are also present. In its upper reaches, the creek is almost entirely dominated by Wisconsinan Till, bedrock, and some lakes. However, there is a patch of alluvial fan immediately north of Shickshinny Lake and some Wisconsinan Bouldery Till and Wisconsinan Outwash not far from the creek's source.|$|E
5|$|The <b>surficial</b> geology near Shickshinny Creek mainly {{consists}} of urban land, fill, alluvium, alluvial terrace, alluvial fan, Wisconsinan Ice-Contact Stratified Drift, Wisconsinan Ice-Contact Delta, Wisconsinan Bouldery Till, Wisconsinan Till, lakes, and wetlands. The lower {{reaches of the}} creek are in a water gap between Huntington Mountain and Shickshinny Mountain. A lake known as Shickshinny Lake is in the watershed and is dammed by the Shickshinny Lake Dam.|$|E
5|$|Ithan Creek {{is within}} the Piedmont Uplands physiographic province. The Piedmont Uplands section has {{generally}} old, hard upland rocks that eroded from the Appalachian Mountains. The rocks in the watershed date to the Precambrian Era and Lower Paleozoic Era. The <b>surficial</b> geology mainly consist of felsic gneiss and mafic gneiss formations, with small amounts of serpentinite {{near the mouth of}} the creek. Silvery mica schist is exposed along the creek. According to a report by the Geological Society of Pennsylvania, the exposures are rare in the vicinity of Ithan Creek.|$|E
5|$|Osteochondrosis, or <b>surficial</b> pits in bone {{at places}} where bones articulate, {{is also known}} in Edmontosaurus. This condition, {{resulting}} from cartilage failing {{to be replaced by}} bone during growth, was found to be present in 2.2% of 224edmontosaur toe bones. The underlying cause of the condition is unknown. Genetic predisposition, trauma, feeding intensity, alterations in blood supply, excess thyroid hormones, and deficiencies in various growth factors have been suggested. Among dinosaurs, osteochondrosis (like tumors) is most commonly found in hadrosaurids.|$|E
25|$|The <b>surficial</b> geology {{near the}} mouth of Beaver Run mainly {{consists}} of alluvial terrace, alluvium, and a till known as Wisconsinan Till. The latter two types of <b>surficial</b> geology are also common further upstream, as is Wisconsinan Ice-Contact Stratified Drift. There are also some patches of wetland, alluvial fan, fill, and bedrock consisting of sandstone and shale. The <b>surficial</b> geology further upstream also includes many of these features.|$|E
25|$|The <b>surficial</b> geology along much of Kennedy Creek {{consists}} of alluvium. However, the <b>surficial</b> geology in the creek's valley {{as a whole}} consists mostly of a till known as Wisconsinan Till.

Alluvium is also found in some areas and there is one patch of sandstone and shale pits.|$|E
25|$|The {{extent of}} the {{salinization}} of the aquifer on Fongafale Islet {{is the result of}} both man-made changes to the topography that occurred when the air field was built in World War II by reclaiming swamp land and excavating coral rock {{from other parts of the}} islet. These topographic changes are exacerbated by the groundwater dynamics of the islet, as tidal forcing pushes salt water into the <b>surficial</b> aquifer during spring tides.|$|E
25|$|The plume {{magmatism}} {{theory is}} based on observations that most large igneous provinces include both hypabyssal and <b>surficial</b> manifestations of voluminous mafic magmatism within the same temporal period. For instance, in most Archaean cratons, greenstone belts correlate with voluminous dike injections as well as usually some form of larger intrusive episodes into the crust. This is particularly true {{of a series of}} ultramafic-mafic layered intrusions in the Yilgarn Craton of ~2.8 Ga and associated komatiite volcanism and widespread tholeiitic volcanism.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the rocks}} exposed in the park date to over one billion years in age, making them among the oldest in Virginia. Bedrock in the park {{includes}} Grenville-age granitic basement rocks (1.2–1.0billion years old) and a cover sequence of metamorphosed Neoproterozoic (570–550million years old) sedimentary and volcanic rocks of the Swift Run and Catoctin formations. Columns of Catoctin Formation metamorphosed basalt {{can be seen at}} Compton Peak. Clastic rocks of the Chilhowee Group are of early Cambrian age (542–520million years old). Quaternary <b>surficial</b> deposits are common and cover much of the bedrock throughout the park.|$|E
25|$|M3 {{detected}} absorption features near 2.8–3.0µm on {{the surface}} of the Moon. For silicate bodies, such features are typically attributed to hydroxyl- and/or water-bearing materials. On the Moon, the feature is seen as a widely distributed absorption that appears strongest at cooler high latitudes and at several fresh feldspathic craters. The general lack of correlation of this feature in sunlit M3 data with neutron spectrometer H abundance data suggests that the formation and retention of OH and H2O is an ongoing <b>surficial</b> process. OH/H2O production processes may feed polar cold traps and make the lunar regolith a candidate source of volatiles for human exploration.|$|E
25|$|Although {{primarily}} {{composed of}} flowing snow and air, large avalanches {{have the capability}} to entrain ice, rocks, trees, and other <b>surficial</b> material. However, they are distinct from mudslides which have greater fluidity, rock slides which are often ice free, and serac collapses during an icefall. Avalanches are not rare or random events and are endemic to any mountain range that accumulates a standing snowpack. Avalanches are most common during winter or spring but glacier movements may cause ice and snow avalanches at any time of year. In mountainous terrain, avalanches are among the most serious objective natural hazards to life and property, with their destructive capability resulting from their potential to carry enormous masses of snow at high speeds.|$|E
25|$|Swartswood State Park {{is located}} in the Kittatinny Valley which is a segment of the Great Appalachian Valley that {{stretches}} from Quebec to Alabama. The valley and surrounding area is part of New Jersey's Ridge and Valley physiographic province. The <b>surficial</b> geology of the valley, namely its soils and parent materials, were created from materials left behind by the retreat of the Wisconsin glaciation after the last glacial maximum. The topography of the valley, and the lake itself, were formed by the damming or obstruction of a river valley with extra-morainic stratified drift and till deposits. As a glacial lake, Swartswood Lake eventually will atrophy into a bog, a natural progression that is estimated to occur in 100,000 years.|$|E
25|$|There {{is further}} {{contention}} {{as to whether}} saltwater encroachment that is destroying the gardens for pulaka, taro and coconut palms is the consequence {{of changes in the}} sea level; or the consequence of the fresh water being extracted from the freshwater lens in the sub-surface of the atoll or the consequence of the creation of the borrow pits, which are the result of the extraction of coral to build the runway at Funafuti during World War II. The investigation of groundwater dynamics of Fongafale Islet, Funafuti, show that tidal forcing results in salt water contamination of the <b>surficial</b> aquifer during spring tides. The degree of aquifer salinization depends on the specific topographic characteristics and the hydrologic controls in the sub-surface of the atoll. About half of Fongafale islet is reclaimed swamp that contains porous, highly permeable coral blocks that allow the tidal forcing of salt water. Increases in the sea level will exacerbate the aquifer salinization as the result of increases in tidal forcing.|$|E
25|$|The {{relative}} age {{and nature}} of intercrater plains material are as uncertain in the Borealis region as they are elsewhere on Mercury. Strom noted the similarity in <b>surficial</b> morphologies between mercurian intercrater plains and pre-Imbrian pitted plains south-southwest of Mare Nectaris on the Moon (Wilhelms and McCauley, 1971; Scott, 1972). The pits in the lunar pre-Imbrian pitted plains {{are similar to the}} small secondaries that pepper the surface of Mercurian intercrater plains material. On the Moon, pre-Imbrian pitted plains material embays the Janssen Formation (Scott, 1972), whose base is defined as the base of the Nectarian System (Stuart-Alexander and Wilhelms, 1975). However, the crater density of the intercrater plains material in the Borealis region matches that of an area {{on the far side of}} the Moon, in the region northwest of crater Tsiolkovskiy bounded by crater Mendeleev and Mare Smithii. This area is dominated by pre-Nectarian unmantled terra and pre-Nectarian and Nectarian craters (Wilhelms and El- Baz, 1977). The similarity in crater density of intercrater plains material on Mercury and of pre-Nectarian terrain on the Moon is geologically significant, inasmuch as it shows that the oldest recognizable surfaces on both Mercury and the Moon went through similar stages of crustal cratering, but not necessarily at the same absolute geologic time. Differences in crater density as well as embayment relations in the Borealis region show that the intercrater plains material and the smoother intermediate plains material are younger than many craters in the area northeast of crater Turgenev, and older than smooth plains material in Borealis Planitia.|$|E
500|$|Most of the <b>surficial</b> geology in the {{watershed}} of Black Creek consists of bedrock. However, glaciofluvial deposits and mining waste also occur in some areas.

500|$|Little Wapwallopen Creek {{ranges from}} {{slightly}} acidic to slightly basic. It {{is a significant}} source of flooding in Conyngham Township, Dorrance Township, and Rice Township. Numerous bridges have been constructed across the creek. The <b>surficial</b> geology in its vicinity consists of alluvium, alluvial terrace, alluvial fan, Wisconsinan Ice-Contact Stratified Drift, [...] Wisconsinan Till, and wetlands. Numerous bridges have also been constructed across the creek.|$|E
500|$|At {{seawater}} pH, {{most of the}} CO2 {{is immediately}} converted back into [...] The reaction results in a net transport of one molecule of CO2 from the ocean/atmosphere into the lithosphere. The result is that each Ca2+ ion released by chemical weathering ultimately removes one CO2 molecule from the <b>surficial</b> system (atmosphere, ocean, soils and living organisms), storing it in carbonate rocks where {{it is likely to}} stay for hundreds of millions of years. The weathering of calcium from rocks thus scrubs CO2 from the ocean and atmosphere, exerting a strong long-term effect on climate.|$|E
500|$|Alluvium, which {{consists}} of stratified sand, silt, and gravel, {{as well as some}} boulders, occurs in the valley of Little Wapwallopen Creek to a depth of [...] or more.

Alluvial terrace also occurs near the creek, which is {{the only place in the}} quadrangle of Sybertsville that contains it in the <b>surficial</b> geology. Wisconsinan Loess, {{which consists}} of windblown silt and fine sand, occurs in the southern part of the creek's valley in the Sybertsville quadrangle. The remains of outwash terraces also occur near the creek in that quadrangle.|$|E
500|$|Cambrian to Ordovician-age dolomite, {{part of the}} Wappinger Group, and {{calcareous}} shales {{from the}} Hudson River Group underlie the Fonteyn Kill. Between 15–20 kya, a glacial lake covered the land that would become the Fonteyn Kill. Till {{and to a lesser}} extent other glacial sediments today sit atop the dolomite and shale. Surrounding soils are loamy, either silt loam or gravelly loam depending on the underlying <b>surficial</b> geology. The streambed is composed of about 25% sand, silt, and clay and approximately 75% cobbles. Quicksand was once common around the Fonteyn Kill and its minor tributaries.
