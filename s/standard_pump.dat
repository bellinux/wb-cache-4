The cabinet has a wide bottom section, which houses large floor speakers and glowing neon lamps. Above this sits a narrower section that contains the monitor, and on top is a lighted marquee graphic, with two small speakers and flashing lights on it. The dance stage is a raised metal platform divided into two sides. Each side houses a set of five acrylic glass pads arranged like the pips on the 5 side of a die, separated by metal squares. Each pad sits atop pressure activated switches, and a software-controlled cold cathode lamp illuminating the translucent pad. A metal safety bar {{in the shape of}} an [...] "R" [...] is mounted to the dance stage behind each player. Some players make use of this safety bar to help maintain proper balance, do tricks during Freestyle routines, and to relieve weight from the legs so that arrows can be pressed with greater speed and accuracy. The community however, places more emphasis on no-bar play, as most major Pump it Up tournaments do not allow bar usage or have a separate division allowing it.|$|E

MethodsA clinical trial–based economic evaluation was performed in which the net costs and effectiveness of the two treatment modalities were calculated and expressed as an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). The clinical outcome of interest for the evaluation was the rate of severe hypoglycemia in each arm of the LGS study. Quality-of-life utility scores were calculated using the three-level EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire. Resource use costs were estimated using public sources. ResultsAfter 6 months, the use of sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy with LGS significantly reduced the incidence of severe hypoglycemia compared with <b>standard</b> <b>pump</b> therapy (incident rate difference 1. 85 [0. 17 – 3. 53]; P = 0. 037). Based on a primary randomized study, the ICER per severe hypoglycemic event avoided was $ 18, 257 for all patients and $ 14, 944 for those aged 12 years and older. Including all major medical resource costs (e. g., hospital admissions), the ICERs were $ 17, 602 and $ 14, 289, respectively. Over the 6 -month period, the cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained was $ 40, 803 for patients aged 12 years and older. ConclusionsBased on the Australian experience evaluating new interventions across {{a broad range of}} therapeutic areas, sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy with LGS may be considered a cost-effective alternative to <b>standard</b> <b>pump</b> therapy with self-monitoring of blood glucose in hypoglycemia unaware patients with type 1 diabetes...|$|E

The analysis calculates theoretically the behavior of the PAT under the best efficiency point and extends the investigation to other operating points using both a combined theoretical approach and CFD simulation under dynamic conditions. The effects of possible modifications to the initial design of the pump are investigated when running in turbine mode and their influence on the <b>standard</b> <b>pump</b> operation is also determined. Numerical simulation demonstrates that the impeller trimming leads to improvement in the PAT efficiency in some operating conditions.

40|$|DHI are {{interested}} in understanding a rather unusual water extraction system that is operated by a water supply company. Typically when water is extracted from the ground a well is dug and a pump is installed in the well to push the water to the surface where it enters a distribution system of pipes.

The system that DHI wish to more fully understand consists of a series of ten wells connected to a single collection pipe.

The goal of this investigation is to prototype a miniature multistage centrifugal pump and assess whether or not such pumps can perform in flow chemistry applications in the place of displacement pumps. This thesis explores the design features implemented in the development of this pump and how they contributed to its performance as pertaining to use in flow chemistry. Specifically, the pump was designed to be comprised of modularly stackable pump stages and to be thermochemically stable, operating without the use of dynamic seals. Ultimately, the device designed succeeded in being modularly stackable and in operating without dynamic seals. However, the target pressure rise per stage was not fully met. Moreover, testing of the pump revealed a high sensitivity in flow rate to changes in generated pressure head. Thus, it is not yet deemed a viable alternative to the current standard of displacement pumps. by Brian Yue. Thesis: S.

The tapered laser diodes provided 1 to 1. 2 W of output power around 675 nm, at an electrical-to-optical conversion efficiency of about 30 %. Using a single tapered diode laser as the pump source, we have demonstrated output powers of 500 mW and 410 mW together with slope efficiencies of 47 % and 41 % from continuous wave (cw) Cr:LiSAF and Cr:LiCAF lasers, respectively. In cw mode-locked operation, sub- 100 -fs pulse trains with average power between 200 mW and 250 mW were obtained at repetition rates around 100 MHz. Upon pumping the Cr:Colquiriite lasers with two tapered laser diodes (one from {{each side of}} the crystal), we have observed scaling of cw powers to 850 mW in Cr:LiSAF and to 650 mW in Cr:LiCAF.

The key difference between the disc assembly and a standard centrifugal pump impeller is that, with the disc assembly, the pumpage does not impinge on the rotating pump mechanism, so that it generates a pulsation-free, laminar flow pattern through the pump. The disc pump can operate effectively in hard-to-pump applications because it lacks an ?impingement? device, which results in minimal contact between the pump and pumpage...|$|E
