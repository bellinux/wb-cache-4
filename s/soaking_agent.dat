40|$|Doctoral thesis {{deals with}} {{professional}} laundry care process and reduction of energy intensity {{and use of}} other operational commodities used in the process. Professional laundry care process is a specific energy intensive process; its purpose is to re-establish original properties of the now dirty laundry so that it may fulfil its functions again. This is basically a recycling and regeneration process comprising many sub-operations. Key operation is washing of the laundry in a washing bath, which removes impurities from the laundry. This thesis describes the most common technology of impurities removal, which is washing in a hot washing bath in cooperation with mechanical work and detergents. However, all of the described procedures may also be applied on alternative technologies, such as ozone washing, washing with low-temperature enzymes and ultrasound. Water is applied in all these technologies as a <b>soaking</b> <b>agent.</b> Water must have appropriate properties and must {{be removed from the}} laundry after the washing process in subsequent operations (drying, ironing, and pressing). Theoretical introduction of the thesis describes professional laundry care process in detail, and continues with mathematical modelling of the process and its main sub-operations (washing, drying) using mass and heat balance, and data acquisition and their application in research and development. Thesis further describes design of information system on the basis of relational database controlled by web application. This system enables to organize data and information from various sources – measured experimental data, data concerning measurement devices, operational records of machines, etc. Thesis further proposes how to evaluate and reduce energy intensity of a process. Descriptions are validated by examples and case studies. Key section of the thesis is a chapter describing experimental infrastructure. This infrastructure integrates several instalments of laundry equipment and is a fully functional operation of industrial laundry facility with 500 kg/shift capacity, which serves as a model of energy intensive process. Sophisticated infrastructure and data acquisition system allows measuring wide spectrum of physical entities and examining factors influencing energy intensity of processes, and relationships between these factors as well as effectiveness of various savings measures in real life facilities...|$|E
40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the proper {{foundation}} of the Venus Flytrap (Dionaea muscipula Ell.) culture under in vitro conditions. The hypothesis {{of this paper is}} that the solution of Savo containing sodium hypochlorite will be able to sterilize effectively seeds of Flytrap without damaging them at certain concentrations. This experiment was founded in three repetitions in two locations - in the Prague Botanical Garden, where one repetition was founded, and at the Department of Horticulture at the Czech University of Life Sciences Prague, where two more repetitions were founded. The seeds were treated in five solutions of Savo Original namely concentrations of 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 % with the addition of <b>soaking</b> <b>agent</b> Trend 90 and planted on 1 / 2 MS medium where plants were grown for 4 months and then transplanted on the same medium for another 4 months. Cultivation was carried out under light conditions 16 hours of light, 8 hours of dark. During the cultivation the formation of contamination was monitored after the foundation of the culture, and also the number of germinated seeds and the number of plants with developed phyllomae. Also the qualitative appearance and the mass of plants were evaluated. The results show that all solutions of Savo are effective enough for sterilizing seeds for in vitro culture. Influence of individual solutions on the development of germination is statistically significant at two solutions - 15 and 20 % solutions of Savo. In these solutions, the development of germination is much faster than the other. On the final number of germinated seeds nor the mass of plants, these 2 solutions didn't have a statistically significant effect. During cultivation, there were occurred some interesting phenomena - spontaneous multiplication of plants, production of polyphenols, flowering of explants, chlorosis and vitrification of tissues. After the previous cultivation, the plants were transferred to non-sterile substrates. Variants of substrates were perlite, peat and perlite in the ratio 2 : 1 and pure peat. Before cultivation, substrates were treated with a fungicide Previcur Energy. High humidity was ensured during the cultivation. For these conditions the mixture of peat and perlit seems to be the most suitable because of minimum losses...|$|E
30|$|The cell {{viability}} of primary root was evaluated using Evans Blue staining. After treatment with 0 or 150  mM NaCl for 3  days, 6 -day-old seedlings were stained with 2.5 % Evans Blue for 10  min and then washed twice with deionized water. Prior to observation, the seedlings were <b>soaked</b> in transparent <b>agent</b> for 12  h.|$|R
40|$|Modified {{though it}} may be, {{distorted}} or twisted, a neuron or a neuroepithelium, every sensory recep-tor is a nerve end. Whenever a nerve is cut, a nerve end is made available that might help elucidate the behavior of these real nerve ends and clarify recep-tor mechanisms. Considering this, the usual fate of the artifactual nerve end is indeed discouraging. The nerve end is hung on wires and crushed, muti-lated, or <b>soaked</b> in blocking <b>agents</b> intended specifi-cally to discourage any contribution it might make to the electrical record. Perhaps something useful may come from treating the artifactual nerve end more kindly. I cannot {{tell you how it}} may help in any particular case, but I hope you will agree that it may be worth trying. I would like to describ...|$|R
30|$|The {{catalysts}} were sulfurized using {{straight run}} gas oil spiked with dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) (4 wt. % S) as sulfiding agent. The catalyst was dried under N 2 flow (100  mL min− 1) for 2  h and then <b>soaked</b> with sulfiding <b>agent</b> and hydrogen flow for 1  h at 150  °C. Subsequently, the liquid-phase sulfidation conditions were set: liquid hour space velocity (LHSV) of 2.4  h− 1; H 2 /oil volume ratio of 300  N L/L and 30 barg of hydrogen. The temperature was increased at 0.5  °C min− 1 to 240  °C {{and kept it}} for 4  h, then further rising at 0.5  °C.min− 1 to 340  °C and kept at 340  °C for 2  h. Afterward, the reactor was cooled down to 220  °C under sulfiding agent and H 2 flow condition. After finishing the sulfidation process, the feedstock was switched at 220  °C and the reaction pressure (35 barg), temperature (340  °C), liquid hour space velocity (1.2  h− 1) and H 2 /oil volume ratio (250  N L/L) were adjusted to the reaction condition. The temperature was increased up to 340  °C using a heating ramp of 0.5  °C/min.|$|R
40|$|Injecting scolicidal {{solutions}} {{into the}} hydatid cyst and packing the operative field with sponges <b>soaked</b> in scolicidal <b>agents</b> {{have been used}} to avoid dissemination of the parasite during surgery. In {{the first part of this}} invitro study, we tried to determine the scolicidal property of various agents in different concentrations and exposure times. In the second part, we tested whether sponges soaked in different type and concentrations of scolicidal agents have any role beyond being a mechanical barrier. 20 % saline, 3 % hydrogen peroxide, 1. 5 % cetrimide- 0. 15 % chlorhexidine (10 % Savlon®), 95 % ethyl alcohol, 10 % polyvinylpirrolidone-iodine (Betadine®) and their further dilutions were used in this study. Protoscoleces were obtained from the cyst containing livers of the sheep and viability was determined with dye-uptake (0. 1 % Eosin) and flame cell activity. Savlon® was found to be the least concentration dependent scolicidal agent among those studied. Scoleces sprayed on sponges soaked in 20 % saline, 95 % ethyl alcohol, Betadine® and 3 % hydrogen peroxide were killed after 15 minutes. 3 % and 10 % saline and normal saline were ineffective. Sponges work not only as a mechanical barrier but also as a chemical one if the agent is chosen correctly. In purely cystic hydatid liver disease, the risk of dissemination of the cyst contents can be avoided by injection of a potent scolicidal agent such as Savlon®...|$|R
40|$|Presoaking meshes for {{hernia repair}} with {{antiseptics}} prior to implantation could decrease the adhesion of microorganisms {{to the material}} surface and {{reduce the risk of}} antibiotic resistances. In this work, we evaluate chlorhexidine and allicin (natural antiseptic not yet tested for these purposes) against vancomycin as antiseptics {{to be used in the}} pretreatment of a heavyweight polypropylene mesh using an in vitro model of bacterial contamination. Solutions of saline, vancomycin (40 µg/mL), allicin (1, 000 µg/mL), chlorhexidine (2 %- 0. 05 %) and the combination allicin-chlorhexidine (900 µg/mL- 0. 05 %) were analyzed with agar diffusion tests in the presence of 106 CFU Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923. Additionally, sterile fragments of Surgipro (1 cm 2) were soaked with the solutions and cultured onto contaminated agar plates for 24 / 48 / 72 h. The antimicrobial material DualMesh Plus was utilized as positive control. At every time, the inhibition zones were measured and the bacterial adhesion to the mesh surface quantified (sonication, scanning electron microscopy). Cytotoxicity of the treatments was examined (alamarBlue) using rabbit skin fibroblasts. The largest zones of inhibition were created by allicin-chlorhexidine. Chlorhexidine was more effective than vancomycin, and allicin lost its effectiveness after 24 h. No bacteria adhered to the surface of the DualMesh Plus or the meshes soaked with vancomycin, chlorhexidine and allicin-chlorhexidine. On the contrary, saline and allicin allowed adherence of high loads of bacteria. Vancomycin had no toxic effects on fibroblasts, while allicin and chlorhexidine exerted high toxicity. Cytotoxicity was significantly reduced with the allicin-chlorhexidine combination. The use of antiseptics such as chlorhexidine, alone or combined with others like allicin, could represent an adequate prophylactic strategy to be used for hernia repair materials because <b>soaking</b> with these <b>agents</b> provides the mesh with similar antibacterial properties to those observed after soaking with vancomycin, similar to the effect of DualMesh Plus...|$|R
40|$|Bacterial leaf blight, {{the disease}} caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), a seedborne pathogen, {{has been known}} to reduce rice yield by 50 %. In this study, two {{consecutive}} experiments were conducted in order to investigate the effect of various biological seed treatments applied on rice seeds artifi cially infected by Xoo on seed quality and seedling growth. Laboratory experiment was arranged in a completely randomized design while greenhouse experiment was arranged in a completely randomized block design. In both experiments, 12 seed treatments were applied: un-infected seeds (negative control) without seed treatment, Xoo infected seeds (positive control) without seed treatment, infected seeds soaked in bactericide Agrept 0. 2 %, infected seeds <b>soaked</b> in biological <b>agent</b> suspension isolate A 6, infected seeds soaked in A 54 isolate, infected seeds soaked in 5 /B isolate, infected seeds soaked in 11 /C isolate, infected seeds matriconditioned + A 6 isolate, infected seeds matriconditioned + A 54 isolate, infected seeds matriconditioned + 5 /B isolate, and infected seeds matriconditioned + 11 /C isolate. Soaking seeds either in Agrept 0. 2 % or in biological agent suspension was conducted for 30 h. Matriconditioning was conducted using ratio of seeds to carrier (burned rice hull 32 mesh) to biological agent suspension or bactericide solution of 1. 0 (g) : 0. 8 (g) : 1. 2 (mL) for 30 h in air-conditioned room ca. 25 oC. Results of experiments showed that all biological seed treatments could suppress Xoo in rice seeds. Matriconditioning plus biological agent (isolate A 6), biopriming with isolate A 6 or isolate A 54 were the best seed treatments to improve seed viability and vigor. In greenhouse experiment, matriconditioning plus isolate A 54 was the best seed treatment to increase seedling growth...|$|R
