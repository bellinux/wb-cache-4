5|$|JIVE Records {{commissioned}} a music video {{for the song}} to be directed by Billie Woodruff. It was produced under Geneva Films, while the choreography was created by Wade Robson.

As the dream begins, Spears is shown in a blue and silver futuristic room with several different levels, where she sings and walks around, and puts {{her feet on the}} wall while wearing a shiny silver outfit. MTV news reporter Ellen Thompson considered it the sexiest moment of the music video.

The following scenes shows the singer wearing white clothes and singing in the room in which she is sleeping, while her love interest comes into her room to see her. Together, they start a pillow fight that shortly ends after Spears is shown again in her room still sleeping, however, now with a smile upon her face. A longer dance segment intercalates with all the scenes during the whole video.|$|E
5|$|Nan Chiau High School's uniform {{is closely}} linked to its {{heritage}} as a former traditional Chinese school. Originally, the school uniform was in full white with the Chinese name of the school sewed on the right chest level of the blouse, much similar to other institutions with Chinese heritage. Students in the senior high and pre-university section wore white shirts with dark coloured skirts, before the pre-university classes were made mandatory to be taught at junior colleges, a policy declared by the ministry of education in 1979. Nearing the 1990s, the school uniform was switched to be worn with dark coloured school pants or <b>skirt,</b> <b>with</b> dark coloured school tag was sewed {{on the left side}} of the shirt. The uniform was redesigned as an effort to preserve the school's identity along with the relocation of the campus in 2000, which integrated the original heritage of the uniform in the 1960s and the 1990s.|$|E

5|$|The larvae of inarticulates swim as {{plankton}} {{for months}} and are like miniature adults, with valves, mantle lobes, a pedicle that coils in the mantle cavity, and a small lophophore, which is used for both feeding and swimming—except that Craniids have no pedicle. As the shell becomes heavier, the juvenile sinks {{to the bottom and}} becomes a sessile adult. The larvae of articulate species live only on yolk, and remain among the plankton for only a few days. This type of larva has a ciliated frontmost lobe that becomes the body and lophophore, a rear lobe that becomes the pedicle, and a mantle like a <b>skirt,</b> <b>with</b> the hem towards the rear. On metamorphosing into an adult, the pedicle attaches to a surface, the front lobe develops the lophophore and other organs, and the mantle rolls up over the front lobe and starts to secrete the shell. In cold seas, brachiopod growth is seasonal and the animals often lose weight in winter. These variations in growth often form growth lines in the shells. Members of some genera have survived for a year in aquaria without food.|$|E

25|$|A common {{version of}} Malaysian school uniform is of public schools. The dress code for males {{is the most}} {{standardised}} while female uniforms are more varied based on the religion of students {{and the type of}} schools.

25|$|To the Pennimans {{were born}} four children; Hortensia, who married Judge Brayton of Swanton; Udney, who {{inherited}} the homestead in Colchester; Julietta, who married Dr. Nathan Ryno Smith, a physician of Baltimore; and Adelia, {{who became the}} wife of Dr. Moody, {{one of the early}} physicians of Burlington. Two daughters of Adelia were well known in Burlington, Mrs. Mary M. Howe, and Mrs. Ella M. Goodrich, wife of Prof. E. Goodrich. Penniman’s descendants had in their possession some interesting Allen relics, but two beautiful old Copley portraits of Penniman and her mother, Mrs. Crean Brush, passed into the possession of Mr. Pell, the owner of Ft. Ticonderoga. They were painted in New York in 1771, when Frances was eleven years of age. She is quaintly arrayed in a long bodice and long full <b>skirt</b> <b>with</b> her hair pompadoured and powdered like her mother’s. But her face is strikingly bright and expressive. She holds in one slender hand a basket of flowers, a prophetic hint of that taste that brought her so much satisfaction when she became middle-aged. A Female Academy was started in Middlebury, Vermont in 1802, and Mrs. Emma Willard began the Middlebury Female Seminary there in 1811. It was to her school, first in Middlebury and then in Troy (Emma Willard School), that Adelia Penniman was sent for her education.|$|E
