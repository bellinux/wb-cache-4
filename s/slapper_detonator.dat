50|$|FEGs find {{multiple}} uses {{due to their}} compact character; charging banks of capacitors, initiation of <b>slapper</b> <b>detonator</b> arrays in nuclear weapons and other devices, driving nuclear fusion reactions, powering pulsed neutron generators, seed power sources for stronger pulse generators (e.g. EPFCGs), electromagnetic pulse generators, electromagnetic weapons, vector inversion generators, etc.|$|E
50|$|The EBW and the <b>slapper</b> <b>detonator</b> are {{the safest}} known types of detonators, {{as only a}} very high-current fast-rise pulse can {{successfully}} trigger them. However, they require a bulky power source for the current surges required. The extremely short rise times are usually achieved by discharging a low-inductance, high-capacitance, high-voltage capacitor (e.g., oil-filled, Mylar-foil, or ceramic) through a suitable switch (spark gap, thyratron, krytron, etc.) into the bridge wire. A very rough approximation for the capacitor is a rating of 5 kilovolts and 1 microfarad, and the peak current ranges between 500 and 1000 amperes. The high voltage may be generated using a Marx generator. Low-impedance capacitors and low-impedance coaxial cables are required to achieve the necessary current rise rate.|$|E
50|$|The <b>slapper</b> <b>detonators</b> are {{frequently}} used in modern weapon designs and aerospace technology.|$|R
50|$|For {{safety and}} reliability, {{exploding}} bridgewire <b>detonators</b> and <b>slapper</b> <b>detonators</b> {{are often used}} in aerospace technology instead of classical blasting caps.|$|R
50|$|<b>Slapper</b> <b>detonators</b> {{are used}} in nuclear weapons. These {{components}} require large quantities of energy to initiate, making them extremely unlikely to accidentally discharge.|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} {{categories}} of electrical detonators: instantaneous electrical detonators (IED), short period delay detonators (SPD) and long period delay detonators (LPD). SPDs are measured in milliseconds and LPDs are measured in seconds. In situations where nanosecond accuracy is required, specifically in the implosion charges in nuclear weapons, exploding-bridgewire detonators are employed. The initial shock wave is created by vaporizing a length of a thin wire by an electric discharge. A new development is a <b>slapper</b> <b>detonator,</b> which uses thin plates accelerated by an electrically exploded wire or foil to deliver the initial shock. It is in use in some modern weapon systems. A variant of this concept is used in mining operations, when the foil is exploded by a laser pulse delivered to the foil by optical fiber.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>slapper</b> <b>detonator,</b> {{also called}} {{exploding}} foil initiator (EFI), {{is a relatively}} recent kind of a detonator developed by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, US Patent No. 4,788,913. It is an improvement of the earlier exploding-bridgewire detonator; instead of directly coupling the shock wave from the exploding wire, the expanding plasma from an explosion of a metal foil drives another thin plastic or metal foil called a [...] "flyer" [...] or a [...] "slapper" [...] across a gap, and its high-velocity impact on the explosive (for example, PETN or hexanitrostilbene) then delivers the energy and shock needed to initiate a detonation. Normally all the slapper's kinetic energy is supplied only by the heating (and hence expansion) of the plasma (the former foil) by the current passing through it, though constructions with a [...] "back strap" [...] to further drive the plasma forward by magnetic field exist too. This assembly is quite efficient; up to 30% of the electrical energy {{can be converted to}} the slapper's kinetic energy.|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a detonation {{system that will}} be useful in the seismological examination of geological structures. The explosive component of this system is produced by the mixing of two liquids; these liquids are classified as non-explosive materials by the Department of Transportation. This detonation system could be employed in a borehole tool in which many explosions are made to occur at various points in the borehole. The explosive for each explosion would be mixed within the tool immediately prior to its being fired. Such an arrangement ensures that no humans are ever in proximity to explosives. Initiation of the explosive mixture is achieved with an electrical <b>slapper</b> <b>detonator</b> whose specific parameters are described; this electrical initiation system does not contain any explosive. The complete electrical/mechanical/explosive system is shown {{to be able to}} perform correctly at temperatures {le} 120 {degrees}C and at depths in a water-filled borehole of {le} 4600 ft (i. e., at pressures of {le} 2000 psig) ...|$|E
50|$|Trigatrons {{find many}} {{different}} uses in pulsed power applications. For example, {{they were used}} in early radar modulators to feed the high-power pulses into the magnetrons, for use with <b>slapper</b> <b>detonators,</b> or for triggering a Marx generator.|$|R
50|$|<b>Slapper</b> <b>detonators</b> are an {{improvement}} on EBW <b>detonators.</b> <b>Slappers,</b> instead of directly using the exploding foil to detonate the initiator explosive, use the electrical vaporization of the foil {{to drive a}} small circle of insulating material such as PET film or kapton down a circular hole in an additional disc of insulating material. At {{the far end of}} that hole is a pellet of conventional initiator explosive.|$|R

(A) <b>Slapper</b> <b>detonator's</b> pellet or flyer impacts a wider area {{of surface}} on the explosive output charge, {{and even though}} energy is lost {{to the sides of}} the area impacted, a cone of explosive is efficiently compressed. (B) EBW detonators only initiate a single point, and energy is lost in all directions, making the energy transfer less efficient.|$|R
40|$|Ranchero is an explosively driven {{magnetic}} flux-compression generator {{that has}} been developed, {{over the last four}} years, as a versatile power source for high energy density physics experiments. It is coaxial, and comprises a 15 cm-diameter armature and a 30 -cm stator, each aluminum. The length may be varied to suit the demands of each experiment; thus far, lengths of 0. 43 m and 1. 4 m have been used. The stator is filled and driven by a high performance cast explosive, and the ultimate performance of the device is limited by the smoothness of the armature expansion. The armature explosive is initiated on axis by PETN hemispheres, spaced at intervals of about 18 mm and 24. 5 mm; each is simultaneously detonated by a <b>slapper</b> <b>detonator</b> system. Calculations of armature expansion predicted ripples less than 0. 2 mm, and this was confirmed in early experiments. Yet, ripples approaching tens of millimeters were observed in some more recent experiments. The authors discuss the possible origins of the se large ripples, and the methods the authors have used to correct them...|$|E
25|$|Large {{capacitor}} banks (reservoir) {{are used as}} energy sources for the exploding-bridgewire <b>detonators</b> or <b>slapper</b> <b>detonators</b> in nuclear weapons and other specialty weapons. Experimental work is under way using banks of capacitors as power sources for electromagnetic armour and electromagnetic railguns and coilguns.|$|R
50|$|Krytrons {{and their}} {{variations}} are manufactured by Perkin-Elmer Components {{and used in}} a variety of industrial and military devices. They are best known for their use in igniting exploding-bridgewire and <b>slapper</b> <b>detonators</b> in nuclear weapons, their original application, either directly (sprytrons are usually used for this) or by triggering higher-power spark gap switches. They are also used to trigger thyratrons, large flashlamps in photocopiers, lasers and scientific apparatus, and for firing ignitors for industrial explosives.|$|R
5000|$|If {{the current}} rise rate is lower, the bridge may burn, perhaps causing {{deflagration}} of the PETN pellet, {{but it will}} not cause detonation. PETN-containing EBWs are also relatively insensitive to a static electricity discharge. Their use is limited by the thermal stability range of PETN. (cf. <b>slapper</b> <b>detonators,</b> which can use high density hexanitrostilbene, allowing their use in temperatures up to almost 300 °C and at both vacuum and at high pressures.) ...|$|R
40|$|Laser {{detonators}} offer {{several advantages}} over traditional electrical detonators, such as exploding bridgewire and <b>slapper</b> <b>detonators,</b> {{in terms of}} both safety and performance. Laser detonators remove the electrical conduction path to the energetic material, providing immunity from threats such as electrostatic discharge and lightning. A larger separation between the initiating energy source and the explosive devices is possible, up to several tens of metres, compared to a few metres for electrical <b>slapper</b> <b>detonators.</b> A laser detonator system has been developed, with laser-driven flyer plates used to shock initiate the explosive. All aspects of the system, including coupling into an optical fibre, used to transmit the laser energy to the detonator, the optical fibre, the flyer plate launch and acceleration and subsquent shock into the explosive, and the explosive initiation have been investigated, with an understanding of the underlying principles and processes developed. Shock initiation of two secondary explosives, hexanitrostilbene and pentaerythritol tetranitrate, has been studied at extremely high shock pressures, comparable to the detonation pressure, and the critical energy fluence required for initiation established. The laser detonator system is robust and optimised, with design tools developed to enable efficient design of future system© Cranfield University, 201...|$|R
40|$|Streak camera {{breakout}} and Fabry-Perot interferometer {{data have}} been taken on the outer surface of 1. 80 g/cm{sup 3 } TATB hemispherical boosters initiated by <b>slapper</b> <b>detonators</b> at three temperatures. The slapper causes breakout to occur at 54 {sup o} at ambient temperatures and 42 {sup o} at - 54 C, where the axis of rotation is 0 {sup o}. The Fabry velocities {{may be associated with}} pressures, and these decrease for large timing delays in breakout seen at the colder temperatures. At room temperature, the Fabry pressures appear constant at all angles. Both fresh and decade-old explosive are tested and no difference is seen. The problem has been modeled with reactive flow. Adjustment of the JWL for temperature makes little difference, but cooling to - 54 C decreases the rate constant by 1 / 6 th. The problem was run both at constant density and with density differences using two different codes. The ambient code results show that a density difference is probably there but it cannot be quantified...|$|R
40|$|Short duration, high {{amplitude}} shock waves and other high-speed motion generated by explosives; high-energy plasmas; and <b>slapper</b> <b>detonators</b> {{are difficult to}} measure due to their fast reaction times. One measurement tool frequently used is VISAR (Velocity Interferometer System for Any Reflector). VISAR is an optical-based system that utilizes Doppler interferometry techniques to measure the complete time-history of the motion of a surface. This technique is gaining worldwide acceptance as the tool of choice for measurement of shock phenomena. However, one limitation of VISAR {{is that it can}} only measure one point on a surface. The new high-speed Multi Point VISAR remedies most of the single point VISAR’s limitations by using multiple fiber optics to send and receive Doppler information from a target. The receiving fiber optics are bundled together and the light is routed through one interferometer cavity. The fiber optic bundle image is separated into single fiber optic images where the Doppler information is individually analyzed. Multi Point VISAR allows the user to measure multiple events, then temporally correlate the shock arrival time as well as shock amplitude history. This paper will discuss some of the new VISAR developments. Shock planarity, amplitude, and simultaneity data will also be presented. *Sandia is a multiprogram laboratory operated by Sandia Corporation, a Lockheed Martin Company, for the United State...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to find a material and configuration that could reliably detect the proper functioning of a <b>slapper</b> (non-explosive) <b>detonator.</b> Because of the small size of the slapper geometry (on the order of a 15 mils), most diagnostic techniques are not suitable. This program has the additional requirements that the device would be used on centrifuge so that it could not use any electrical power or output signals. This required that the diagnostic be completely passive. The paper describes the three facets of the development effort: complete characterization of the slapper using VISAR measurements, selection of the diagnostic material and configuration, and testing of the prototype designs. The VISAR testing required that use of a special optical probe to allow the laser light to reach both bridges of the dual-slapper detonator. Results are given in the form of flyer velocity as a function of the initiating charge voltage level. The selected diagnostic design functions in a manner similar to a dent block except that the impact of the Kapton disk from a properly-functioning slapper causes a fracture pattern. A quick visual inspection is all that is needed to determine if the flyer velocity exceeded the threshold value. Sub-threshold velocities produce a substantially different appearance...|$|R
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{our work}} on high-voltage switches {{during the past}} few years. With joint funding from the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Department of Defense (DOD), we tested a wide variety of switches to a common standard. This approach permitted meaningful comparisons between disparate switches. Most switches were purchased from commercial sources, though some were experimental devices. For the purposes of this report, we divided the switches into three generic types (gas, vacuum, and semiconductor) and selected data that best illustrates important strengths and weaknesses of each switch type. Test techniques that indicate the state of health of the switches are emphasized. For example, a good indicator of residual gas in a vacuum switch is the systematic variation of the switching delay in response to changes in temperature and/or operating conditions. We believe that the presentation of this kind of information will help engineers to select and to test switches for their particular applications. Our work was limited to switches capable of driving slappers. Also known as exploding-foil initiators, <b>slappers</b> are <b>detonators</b> that initiate a secondary explosive by direct impact with a small piece of matter moving at the detonation velocity (several thousands of meters per second). A slapper is desirable for enhanced safety (no primary explosive), but it also places extra demands on the capacitor-discharge circuit to deliver a fast-rising current pulse (greater than 10 A/ns) of several thousand amperes. The required energy is substantially less than one joule; but this energy is delivered in less than one microsecond, taking the peak power into the megawatt regime. In our study, the switches operated in the 1 kV to 3 kV range and were physically small, roughly 1 cm{sup 3 } or less. Although a fuze functions only once in actual use, multiple-shot capability is important for production testing and for research work. For this reason, we restricted this report to multiple-shot switches. Furthermore, our work included only switches with submicrosecond timing precision, thereby excluding mechanical switches...|$|R
