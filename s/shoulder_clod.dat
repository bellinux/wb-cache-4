5000|$|This cut {{of steak}} {{is from the}} {{shoulder}} of a beef animal. [...] It is located adjacent {{to the heart of}} the <b>shoulder</b> <b>clod,</b> under the seven or paddle bone (shoulder blade or scapula). The steak encompasses the infraspinatus muscles of beef, and one may see this displayed in some butcher shops and meat markets as a [...] "top blade" [...] roast. Anatomically, the muscle forms the dorsal part of the rotator cuff of the steer. This cut is anatomically distinct from the shoulder tender, which lies directly below it and is the teres major.|$|E
5000|$|The beef clod or {{shoulder}} {{is one of}} {{the cheapest}} cuts of beef and is taken from the shoulder region of the cattle. This is why it is sometimes called chuck or <b>shoulder</b> <b>clod,</b> because obviously [...] "chuck" [...] or [...] "clod" [...] means cheap, apparently. Beef clod consists of a large muscle system and some fat that covers the muscles. Beef clod can be prepared in a variety of methods both dry and moist, but the most recommended method to cook beef clod is to cook it with moist heat or braising. Long slow smoking also provides acceptable results.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of our study}} was to evaluate the relationships among total iron content, myoglobin/total iron ratio, hemoglobin/total iron ratio, and flavor attributes in beef top sirloin, <b>shoulder</b> <b>clod,</b> and tenderloin muscles. Top sirloin (n= 74), <b>shoulder</b> <b>clod</b> (n= 68), and tenderloin (n= 73) muscles from A or B maturity carcasses that were either USDA Slight or USDA Small marbling and of either normal pH (6. 0) were vacuum packaged, aged 35 days at 35 ºF, and stored at - 4 ºF until analysis. A well trained, flavorprofile sensory panel determined flavor attributes on charbroiled steaks. Flavor attributes included beef flavor identification, bloody/serumy, brown roasted, livery, metallic, rancid, and sour. Concentrations of myoglobin and hemoglobin were determined by using high-pressure liquid chromatography. Total iron concentration was determined by using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The <b>shoulder</b> <b>clod</b> had greater total iron (P< 0. 05) than the top sirloin or tenderloin. Livery flavor increased (P< 0. 05) and beef flavor identification and brown roasted flavor decreased (P< 0. 05) in the top sirloin as total iron increased. Compared with the top sirloin and <b>shoulder</b> <b>clod,</b> the tenderloin had lower (P< 0. 05) myoglobin/total iron ratios and greater (P< 0. 05) hemoglobin/total iron ratios. At medium and high myoglobin/total iron ratios, samples with Slight marbling had more (P< 0. 05) livery flavor. At low myoglobin/total iron ratios, A-maturity samples had more (P< 0. 05) rancid off-flavor than B maturity samples. There were no relationships between hemoglobin/total iron ratios and flavor attributes. Total iron may contribute to livery flavor in the top sirloin, but total iron is not a reliable indicator of livery flavor...|$|E

Two experiments {{were conducted to}} evaluate the effects of diet on fresh and processed meat quality in beef. In experiment 1, steers and heifers (n = 48) were assigned randomly to one of four treatment groups and fed individually. Treatments were as follows: steam-flaked corn diet with no modified distillers grains with solubles (MDGS) or glycerin (CON); CON with 35 % MDGS (MDGS); CON with 10 % glycerin (GLY); and CON with 35 % MDGS and 10 % glycerin (MDGS/GLY). When cattle reached a mean weight of 590 kg, they were humanely harvested at a commercial abattoir. Strip loins and <b>shoulder</b> <b>clods</b> {{were removed from the}} right side of each carcass. Treatment had no effect any specific fatty acid (P > 0. 05), vacuum purge loss (P = 0. 75), cooking loss (P = 0. 40), Warner-Bratzler shear force values (P = 0. 94), strip steak L*, a*, or b* values (P > 0. 05) or ground beef L*, a*, or b* values (P > 0. 05). CON and MDGS had higher values for consumer overall liking and texture liking of strip steaks (P < 0. 05). Treatment did not affect flavor liking (P < 0. 05). In experiment 2, <b>shoulder</b> <b>clods</b> and inside rounds from 24 forage-finished steers were ground in groups, divided into five 35 kg batches, and assigned randomly to one of five antioxidant treatments: control (CON); ground wild rice (WR); rosemary extract (ROSE); cherry seed powder (CHERRY); rosemary and pomegranate extract blend (X). Each antioxidant was added at 1 % and mixed into a batch for 1 minute. Batches were formed into patties and objective and subject color scores, sensory evaluation, and TBARS were measured. L* and b* did not differ between treatment (P = 0. 49 and 0. 66, respectively), however inclusion of CHERRY did increase a* values (P = 0. 01). Texture liking was decreased with X compared to the WR and CHERRY (P = 0. 006. Toughness was decreased with WR (P = 0. 03) as compared to X and juiciness increased with the addition of CHERRY (P = 0. 003). Overall liking, flavor liking, and off flavor were unaffected by treatment (P = 0. 09, 0. 07, and 0. 06, respectively).

Subprimals were fabricated into bone-in or boneless retail or foodservice cuts and associated components by trained retail meat cutters. After each retail cutting test, trained technicians recorded weights of all cuts, lean trim, fat trim, and bone. All retail cuts were trimmed to an eighth of an inch (0. 32 cm), unless otherwise specified. Time (s) was recorded for each-cutting test and in two major phases: opening (retrieval of the subprimal from vacuum-packaged bag) and cutting (removal of all external and seam fat, connective tissue, and separation of individual muscles, as well as producing tray ready retail cuts). In general, Select subprimals had higher saleable yields than Choice subprimals. Select subprimals had less trimmable fat than Choice subprimals, and differences in retail yields appeared to follow these factors. Few significant differences were observed for processing times between USDA quality grade groups.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine if excised, cold-shortened muscle improves in tenderness with refrigerated aging. Changes in muscle tenderness due to cooking rates were also evaluated. Beef ribeye and <b>shoulder</b> <b>clod</b> muscles from the left side of 12 carcasses were removed 45 min postmortem and placed in an ice bath to induce cold shortening. Corresponding muscles from the right side were chilled conventionally on the intact side. One-inch steaks from these muscles were either frozen at 24 hours or aged for 14 days at 40 ºF before being cooked and analyzed. Steaks were analyzed raw, or cooked to 160 ºF internally in a oven at 200 (SLOW) or 500 °F (FAST). Sarcomere length (degree of contraction), tenderness, and the extent of degradation of structural proteins were measured. Rapid chilling caused severe muscle contraction, which had a dramatic toughening effect. At 24 hours, the cold-shortened muscle showed less protein degradation than conventionally chilled muscle. After aging 14 days, tenderness had improved and protein degradation had occurred in both cold-shortened and conventional muscles, but degradation was still less in cold-shortened muscles. The improvement in tenderness and the increase in protein degradation from 1 to 14 days were equal between cold-shortened and conventional chilling treatments but the cold-shortened muscles remained tougher. FAST cooking resulted in greater cooking losses and greater sarcomere shortening than SLOW cooking. Cooking rate did not affect the tenderness of ribeye steaks, but SLOW cooking improved the tenderness of <b>shoulder</b> <b>clod</b> steaks that are higher in connective tissue. Extreme chilling conditions, which induce cold shortening, may reduce protein degradation beyond the effect of shortening.

40|$|This {{research}} compared off-flavor {{notes and}} the relationship of pH and heme-iron content to off-flavor for different beef muscles. After grading, knuckles and <b>shoulder</b> <b>clods</b> were removed from 16 USDA Choice and 14 USDA Select beef carcasses, vacuum- packaged, and aged for 7 d. The rectus femoris (REC), vastus medalis (VAM), vastus lateralis (VAL), teres major (TER), infraspinatus (INF), and triceps brachii-long head (TRI) were separated, cut into steaks, and frozen (− 16 °C). Sensory analysis was conducted using a trained taste panel, with steaks grilled to an internal temperature of 65 °C. Heme-iron concentration and pH were determined. The INF had lower (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) off-flavor intensity ratings and less frequent sour flavor than the other muscles, and the VAL had the most intense (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) off-flavor ratings and among the greatest frequency of sour, charred, and oxidized flavors. The frequencies of liver-like, bloody, and rancid flavors were not affected by muscle type. Heme-iron concentration did not differ among muscles. Three USDA Select carcasses had intense off-flavor in the muscles. Liver-like flavor was highly negatively correlated with off-flavor intensity for each of the muscles tested.

40|$|These studies {{analyzed}} {{the effects of}} feeding distillers grains on the shelf life of cooked and raw ground beef, and how the addition of postmortem or dietary antioxidants impact shelf life. For study one, cattle were assigned to backgrounding diets containing low or high concentrations of wet distillers grains (WDGS) and either corn gluten feed or modified wet distillers grains (MDGS) during finishing. For study two, cattle were fed one of five finishing diets; corn, wet distillers grains (WDGS), WDGS + vitamin E, WDGS + Ethoxyquin/TBHQ, or WDGS + vitamin E + Ethoxyquin/TBHQ. <b>Shoulder</b> <b>clods</b> from each dietary treatment were ground and lean, fat, and composite samples were taken for fatty acid analysis. Patties were overwrapped for retail display and analyzed for lipid oxidation, discoloration and objective color. Cooked beef links were manufactured with salt and phosphate. Links from the first study contained different concentrations of rosemary and green tea extract. Beef was stuffed into links, cooked, and lipid oxidation was measured throughout refrigerated or frozen storage. For study one, {{there were no differences}} in lipid oxidation of patties, yet ground beef from heifers finished with MDGS discolored faster than beef from cattle finished on corn gluten feed. Increased lipid oxidation in beef links occurred when cattle were fed distillers grains during backgrounding or finishing but antioxidants reduced lipid oxidation similarly regardless of concentration. For study two, ground beef patties showed no dietary differences for instrumental color, only increased percent discoloration over time. All ground beef TBARS increased over time, and supplementation of vitamin E resulted in lower TBARS values than corn after 2 d of retail display. An increase in PUFA and C 18 : 2 was observed in lean and composite fatty acids in WDGS versus corn-finished cattle. Both dietary and postmortem antioxidants were effective at extending shelf life in ground beef from cattle fed distillers grains. Additionally, the effect of feeding distillers grains on shelf life varies depending on when distillers grains was supplemented. Advisor: Gary A. Sulliva...|$|R
40|$|Muscle {{profiling}} {{research conducted}} {{in the early part}} of this decade by the University of Nebraska and the University of Florida for The Beef Checkoff was highly successfully.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Popularity of the microwave and a "fast-lane" lifestyle adopted by most Americans has prompted the development of frozen and shelf-stable microwaveable foods. Many foods such as vegetables, potatoes, and casseroles can be acceptably cooked from the raw state in a microwave oven. Consumer attempts to add meats to the menu that are cooked from the raw state or partially cooked such as, ground beef patties, steaks, chops, meat loaves and whole muscle meats result in decreased acceptability. This research was undertaken to identify starches and hydrocolloids with moisture-retention qualities that improve cook yield, evaporation loss and acceptability by the consumer, of pre-injected, precooked, whole muscle meat products. Beef <b>shoulder</b> <b>clod</b> roasts for Experiment I were injected with I % Firm-tex[], I % Pen Plus 10 TM, 0. 5 % carrageenan and 0. 25 % Kelgum[] (xanthan gum). There were few differences in physical, chemical and sensory parameters. Firm-tex[] and Kelgum[] were selected for further study on the basis of numeric cook yield values and percent evaporation loss after reheating in the microwave. In Experiment 11, beef <b>shoulder</b> <b>clod</b> roasts were injected with I% Firm-tex[], 0. 25 % Kelgum[], a 35 %/ 65 % and 65 %/ 35 % blend of Firm-tex[]/Kelgum[] and compared to a control. Cook yields favored the Firm-tex[], treatments of 35 %/ 65 % and 65 %/ 35 % Firm-tex/Kelgum[] blends with values of 94. 46 %, 93. 5 % and 92. 8 %, respectively. Because Firm-tex[] increased cook yields over control and Kelgum[], and did not have detrimental effects, it was selected for further testing in Experiment III. In Experiment III, top round and sirloin tip roasts were compared with and without 1 % Firm-tex[] (starch). Cook yields and evaporation losses after reheating were not different. Firm-tex[] had little effect on shear values but did affect mushiness. Increased yields with Firm-tex[] without altering product quality could be useful in preparing a beef should clod roast for microwave application. Use of Firm-tex[] at levels of I% in sirloin tip and top round roasts did not appear to improve the processing or microwave reheating properties over conventional brine injection...|$|E

In regards to steak sensory, no differences were found in flavor liking (P = 0. 102), juiciness (P = 0. 375), or off-flavor (P = 0. 313). Differences were found in overall liking (P = 0. 008) with CC being more liked than CON (P = 0. 013) and Ca(OH) 2 (P = 0. 019). Texture liking was affected by dietary treatment (P < 0. 001), with CC higher than CON (P < 0. 001), H 2 O (P = 0. 021), and Ca(OH) 2 (P < 0. 001). Toughness scores were also affected by dietary treatment (P < 0. 001) with CC having the lowest values compared to CON (P < 0. 001), H 2 O (P = 0. 015), and Ca(OH) 2 (P < 0. 001). For bologna sensory, no differences among dietary treatments were found for overall liking (P = 0. 610), flavor liking (P = 0. 707), texture liking (P = 0. 828), juiciness (P = 0. 371), and off-flavor (P = 0. 716). A difference in toughness was found (P = 0. 011) with H 2 O being more tough than Ca(OH) 2 (P = 0. 008). It was concluded that the use of calcium hydroxide treatment of corn stover in backgrounding diets of beef calves does not affect carcass characteristics or moisture loss, but does affect fresh and further processed beef characteristics. Although there were differences found among dietary treatments for meat characteristics, these differences do not appear to be large enough from a practical stand point to make a recommendation against the feeding of alkali-treated corn stover during calf backgrounding...|$|R
40|$|This {{trial was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the quantitative carcass traits of Nellore, F 1 Simmental × Nellore and F 1 Angus × Nellore steers fed at maintenance level or ad libitum with 1 % and 2 % of the body weight in concentrate. The animals were allotted to the treatments in a completely randomized experimental design, in a 3 × 3 factorial arrangement. The animals fed the ad libitum diet with more concentrate had greater cold carcass weight, cold carcass yield and longissimus muscle area/ 100 kg of cold carcass weight when compared with animals fed the diet with low concentrate allowance. There {{was no difference between}} the ad libitum diets for all of the carcass cuts yields, except for top sirloin. Crossbred animals had cold carcass yield larger than the Nellore animals. F 1 Angus × Nellore animals had greater rib fat thickness and smaller longissimus muscle area/ 100 kg than the F 1 Simmental × Nellore cattle. The yield of commercial carcass cuts was not influenced by genetic group, except for the <b>shoulder</b> <b>clod</b> yield, which was smaller in crossbred animals compared with Nellore animals. The longissimus muscle area, rib fat thickness and rump fat, taken by ultrasound were influenced by the body weight of the animals.

Foram utilizados 15 cordeiros inteiros, originados de partos simples, abatidos ao atingirem peso vivo final de 28 kg. As carcaças foram mantidas em câmara de refrigeração a 5 ºC, durante 24 horas, para registro das medidas objetivas, realizado após separação dos cortes comerciais, na meia-carcaça esquerda. A área do músculo Longissimus dorsi foi mensurada para determinação da área de olho de lombo (AOL cm²). No lombo esquerdo congelado, realizou-se a análise de composição química e, no direito, também congelado, o teste de maciez peloWarner Bratzler Shear Force. Os níveis de proteína bruta não influenciaram as medidas objetivas de carcaça nem as do músculo Longissimus dorsi. Houve efeito significativo para peso e rendimento da paleta, com superioridade para o tratamento contendo 25 % de proteína bruta. Nas análises químicas do músculo Longissimus dorsi, observou-se efeito significativo para extrato etéreo, cinzas e maciez. No sistema de alimentação e terminação de cordeiros Suffolk em creep feeding, a ração formulada com farelo de soja como fonte protéica deve ser balanceada com 25 % de proteína bruta por diminuir o teor de gordura e melhorar a maciez da carne e o peso e rendimento da paleta, sem afetar as medidas objetivas da carcaça, os demais pesos e os rendimentos dos cortes. The {{objective}} of this trial was to evaluate the effects of three concentrate protein levels (15, 20 or 25 % CP) on measurements of carcass and Longissimus dorsi muscle, weights and yields of cuts, and chemical composition and tenderness of meat of Suffolk lambs in creep feeding. Fifteen single birth lambs were used in this study. Lambs were slaughtered when they reached a final body weight of 28 kg. After slaughter, carcasses were maintained in a refrigerator at 5 ºC for 24 hours followed by measurements on the left half carcass done after separation of the commercial cuts. The Longissimus dorsi area was measured to obtain the loin eye area (LEA, cm 2). Both left and right loins were frozen; the left was used for determination of chemical composition while the right for a tenderness test ("Warner Bratzler Shear Force"). Different concentrate crude protein levels did not affect carcass measurements as well as measurements on the Longissimus dorsi. However, significant differences among treatments were observed for weight and yield of <b>shoulder</b> <b>clod</b> with the highest values found on the 25 % crude protein concentrate. Chemical analyses of Longissimus dorsi showed significant differences across treatments for ether extract, ash, and tenderness. It can be concluded that the diet containing soybean meal must be formulated to yield 25 % of crude protein because it reduced the fat content and improved the tenderness of the meat. In addition, it also increased both weight and yield of <b>shoulder</b> <b>clod</b> with no changes on carcass measurements and weight and yields of the remaining cuts...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} was to evaluate the effect of diets containing levels of linseed oil in the performance, carcass characteristics, weight, yield of cuts of meat, and meat quality of heifers and steers Nellore x Canchim. Fifteen 24 -monthold steers (427. 80 ± 40. 59 kg) and fourteen 24 -month-old heifers (400. 57 ± 32. 57 kg, average body weight) were confined in individual pens, receiving diets with 80 % of concentrated, sugar cane as exclusive roughage and increasing levels of linseed oil (1. 0, 3. 8 and 5. 2 % on a DM basis). The experiment was designed in an incomplete random blocks one, in a factorial scheme of 3 x 2 (type of diet and sexual condition). The initial weight of animals was used as co-variable and the blocks were considered as the randomizing effect. All of the animals of every block were slaughtered once they reached an average body weight of 500 kg; this resulted in 96 days of feedlot for two blocks, 110 days for other two blocks and 138 days for one block, after 28 days of adaptation. Dry matter consumption by animals, in kg and body weight percentage, was reduced (P< 0. 05), accompanied with higher daily weight gains, an improvement in feed efficiency {{and an increase in}} the Longissimus eye area in the carcass with an elevation of oil levels in diets, without differences between sex conditions.

40|$|Purpose This {{data set}} {{provides}} retailers with {{a tool to}} find the most accurate beef nutrient data for the purpose of on-pack nutrition labeling. This data set focuses on the beef cuts identified by the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) for nutrition labeling and, in addition, some new Beef Value Cuts. IntroductionSince 1990 ’s, nutrient composition data for beef products in the USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference (SR) have been updated regularly. These updates have been important since changes in animal husbandry practices and industry procedures have led to the availability of leaner cuts, as well as the marketing of cuts not previously available. The USDA Nutrient Data Laboratory (NDL) has been involved in three different studies designed to update or expand the data on beef cuts in SR. These studies included the 1 / 8 Inch Study, the Beef Value Cuts (BVC) Study, and the Beef Nutrient Database Improvement Study [...] In addition to providing current and accurate estimates for the beef data in SR, these new data are also useful for the industry to meet the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) proposed labeling regulations for fresh, single-ingredient meats. The 1 / 8 Inch Study was a collaborative research project conducted by USDA NDL, Texas A 2 ̆ 6 M University, and sponsored by the National Cattleman’s Beef Association (NCBA) with support from the the Beef Checkoff Program. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the physical characteristics and nutrient composition of 13 raw and cooked retail cuts that had been fabricated with fat trim levels representative of current retail cuts. This study generated analytical data that had not previously been available in SR. The purpose of the BVC Study was to provide information on a new line of single muscle roasts and steaks, fabricated from the outside round, the knuckle, and the chuck <b>shoulder</b> <b>clod.</b> These cuts, introduced into the retail market in 2001 - 2002, include the top blade steak (Infraspinatus), shoulder top and center steaks (Triceps brachii), shoulder tender (Teres major), tip center (Rectus femoris), tip side (Vastus lateralis) and bottom round (Biceps femoris). USDA’s NDL, in collaboration with NCBA, with support from the Beef Checkoff Program and the University of Wisconsin conducted this study to determine the nutrient profile of the BVC for inclusion in SR. Since there is no separable fat present in the denuded single muscles of the BVC study, nutrient values for “Separable Lean Only” and “Separable Lean and Fat” are the same. Five of these six major cuts met the USDA definition of lean 1...|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} zilpaterol hydrochloride (ZH) on carcass cutability and tenderness of calf-fed Holstein steers, calf-fed Holstein carcasses (n = 102) were selected {{from a pool of}} 2, 300 steers that were fed 0 or 8. 3 mg/kg (DM basis) of ZH. Zilpaterol hydrochloride was supplemented the last 20 d of the finishing period and withdrawn for 3 d before slaughter. Carcasses were selected based on carcass weight as well as predetermined USDA Yield grade categories. For tenderness evaluation, steaks from the strip loin, bottom round, and top round (n = 54 per subprimal) were aged for 14 or 21 d postmortem. Carcasses from ZH-fed steers had more (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) saleable yield than carcasses from control-fed steers. Additionally, ZH-fed steers had greater (P ≤ 0. 01) subprimal yield from the <b>shoulder</b> <b>clod,</b> strip loin, peeled tenderloin, top sirloin butt, bottom sirloin tri-tip, peeled knuckle, inside round, bottom round flat, eye of round, heel, and shank. Furthermore, ZH decreased (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) the total amount and percentage of bone and fat trim from the carcass. Moisture loss was not affected by ZH in LM or inside round steaks (P 3 ̆e 0. 05); however, ZH increased thawing loss (P = 0. 05) but reduced cooking loss (P = 0. 05) in bottom round steaks. Shear force values of LM and inside round steaks increased with ZH inclusion (P 3 ̆c 0. 01), but {{there was no difference in}} bottom round steaks (P 3 ̆e 0. 05). Steaks aged for 21 d had smaller (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBS) values than 14 -d steaks from all 3 subprimals. Trained sensory panelists did not detect any differences (P 3 ̆e 0. 05) in sensory juiciness, tenderness, or flavor variables of LM or inside round steaks, except ZH steaks from the LM received smaller scores for sustained juiciness (P = 0. 01) and overall tenderness (P = 0. 04) than control steaks. Although LM steaks from ZH cattle were tougher than control steaks, the ZH-treated steaks had an average WBS value of 4. 10 kg, which would be classified as intermediate in tenderness, with trained panelists rating ZH steaks slightly to moderately tender. Feeding ZH improved carcass cutability of calf-fed Holstein steers; however, tenderness was reduced in LM and inside round steaks. The interaction of postmortem tenderization techniques should be investigated to {{evaluate the}}ir impact on palatability in cattle supplemented with β-agonists to allow the beef industry to take full advantage of the enhancement in performance and carcass yield...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of these studies}} was to evaluate the effects of zilpaterol hydrochloride (ZH), fed for 0, 20, or 30 d, on meat quality attributes of calf-fed Holstein steers. Steers were slaughtered at a commercial facility, and carcasses were selected by HCW to represent the pen mean. Further carcass selection was based on quality grade (Choice and Select) and yield grade. Proximate composition, measures of water holding capacity, and tenderness using Warner-Bratzler shear force after 7, 14, or 21 d postmortem were evaluated on the <b>shoulder</b> <b>clod</b> (triceps brachii), top butt (gluteus medius), and strip loin (longissimus lumborum). Percentage of purge for the 3 subprimals was not different (P 3 ̆e 0. 05) among ZH treatments. Steers fed ZH for 20 d or 30 d had decreased (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) percentages of fat in the triceps brachii, compared with 0 -d ZH. Percentage of fat was less (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) in the gluteus medius and longissimus lumborum when steers were fed ZH for 30 d compared with those steers fed ZH for 0 d. Percentage of fat was greater in Choice triceps brachii (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) and longissimus lumborum (P 3 ̆c 0. 10) compared with Select. Thaw loss was not different (P 3 ̆e 0. 05) for any muscle due to ZH treatment. Only longissimus had a greater (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) cooking loss with ZH treatment. Cooking loss was not different (P 3 ̆e 0. 05) for the gluteus medius or longissimus lumborum due to quality grade or aging day. At each aging day, the 20 - and 30 -d ZH longissimus lumborum had greater (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) shear force values than 0 d; however, 20 - and 30 -d ZH had a greater absolute change in shear force from 7 to 21 d than that of 0 d ZH. Triceps brachii steaks were less tender (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) after ZH treatment, but gluteus medius steaks were not different (P 3 ̆e 0. 05). There was no difference (P 3 ̆e 0. 05) in shear force due to quality grade. Results illustrate the use of ZH in calf-fed Holstein steers will have minimal effects on purge, thaw, or cooking loss. Percentage of intramuscular fat will decrease, especially when fed for longer durations. Steaks from ZH treated steers were tougher than steaks from control animals at all aging times, but ZH steaks became more tender with postmortem aging...|$|E
40|$|Richmond Ltd. has {{recently}} undergone {{a change in}} strategy, away from the traditional commodity based meat industry, towards the modern food business. To do this, opportunities to add value to their current product range must be identified. This involves the conversion of traditionally low value commodity based products into products that demand a premium. An {{example of this is}} converting muscles that are currently used for grinding meat into a further processed convenience food (i. e. ready meals). Another method is to add further value to premium products by making them more appealing to consumers (i. e. nutritional information on labels). This work details investigations into the functional properties of selected beef forequarter muscles (low value commodity products) and the nutritional properties of selected export lamb products (premium products). The functional properties of a number of beef forequarter muscles were measured to identify which had the best potential for further processing applications with respect to ready meals. The functional properties of tenderness, cook loss and shrinkage were measured for the Latissimus Dorsi, Pectorialis Profundus (Point End Brisket), Infraspinatus (Cross Cut Blade), Triceps Brachi Longhead (Main muscle in Bolar <b>Shoulder</b> <b>Clod),</b> Supraspinatus (Chuck Tender), Serratus Ventralis and Triceps Brachi Medialhead (Muscle in Bolar <b>Shoulder</b> <b>Clod.</b> From the tests conducted the Infraspinatus and the Triceps Brachi Longhead have been identified as having the best functional properties with respect to further processing for ready meal applications. As well as conducting tests to identify the forequarter muscles with the best potential for further processing applications, investigations were carried out to identify cooking regimes that would optimise the functional properties. This work confirmed that there are three major chemical reactions, which determine the resultant functional properties of cooked meat. They are the denaturation and aggregation of the myofibrillar proteins and the denaturation and solubilisation of connective tissue (collagen). At around 50 °C myosin (45 % to 50 % of the myofibrillar proteins) denatures, which results in a substantial increase in cook loss and reduction in water holding capacity. At around 60 °C collagen (main connective tissue protein) denatures, which results in a substantial increase in tenderness and increase in cook loss. This is because as the collagen denatures it loses it mechanical strength (increase in tenderness) and can no longer support its own structure, and causes it to contract. This contraction causes fluid within the meat and cook loss caused by the denaturation of myosin to be expelled from the meat by compressive forces (squeezed out). At around 70 °C actomyosin (22 % of the myofibrillar proteins) denatures. This results in a substantial increase in the cook loss and firming of the meat. The increase in cook loss or decrease in water holding capacity that occurs with myofibrillar protein denaturation {{is due to the fact}} that when these proteins denature and aggregate their ability to bind water is greatly reduced. From the results of the cooking regime trials it is recommended that for functional property considerations that during the cooking of further processed meat products (i. e. ready meal applications) a meat temperature of 62 °C should be aimed for, for the slowest heating region during cooking (usually the centre). This is because it has been identified that a cooking temperature of 65 °C should not be exceeded otherwise detrimental effects can occur to the functional properties of the cooked meat. For health concerns a 7 D bacterial death reduction has to be achieved. This means that for a cooking temperature of 62 °C the meat has to be held at this temperature for at least 5 minutes. Therefore the total cooking time would be the time needed to heat all the meat to 62 °C plus 5 minutes to ensure a safe product. The heating or cooking system employed should also ensure that a minimal amount of the meat is heated above 65 °C. This can be easily achieved by minimising the external cooking temperature, but long cooking times will result. An industrial cooking process will be a compromise between the cost associated with longer residence time and product functionality. As mentioned earlier another way to add value is to supply nutritional information for selected cuts. Consequentially one of the objectives of this project was to provide some nutritional information for selected meat cuts. Though the primary objective of this part of the project was to develop a method for producing the needed information, so that Richmond N. Z. Ltd. can develop further information on an as needs basis. The nutritional characteristics of a number of export lamb cuts from the saddle region has also been investigated and a method devised to allow further characterisation of other cuts. The method involves breaking down a standard cut into its constituent components (e. g. Frenched rack consists of loin eye, fat cap, intercostals and fatty tissue). The constituent components are tested for their nutritional properties. The frenched rack nutritional properties are calculated from the nutritional properties of the constituents components and the yield data (percentage of each constituent component within a frenched rack) for frenched racks. This method allowed the identification of the main sources of variation for nutritional characteristics. These differences were found to be caused by the lean to fat ratio, not nutritional differences in lean tissue from the same region of lamb (i. e. loin eye and tenderloin very similar nutritionally). The difference in lean to fat ration also accounts for the variation between grades (i. e. PX grade lamb cuts have a higher fat content than YX grade lamb cuts due to PX grade cuts having a higher percentage fat tissue in their cuts). The cuts characterised were the shortloin section (whole section or chop), rack section (whole section or chop), 75 mm racks frenched 25 mm, boneless loin and tenderloin for both PX and YX grade lamb. The method will be applicable to other regions of lamb (i. e. hindquarter and forequarter) for which nutritional information already exists, but for which yielding data will have to be collected. The method would also be applicable to other species such as beef and venison, but both nutritional data for constituent components and yielding data would have to be collected...|$|E

Foram avaliados os pesos de corpo vazio (PCV), de carcaça quente (PCQ) e de carcaça fria (PCF), a partir dos quais foram calculados os rendimentos biológico (RB), de carcaça quente (RCQ) e de carcaça fria (RCF) e a perda de peso por resfriamento (PPR). A carcaça foi dividida em cinco cortes cárneos (perna, lombo, costelas, paleta e pescoço), os quais foram pesados para cálculo de seus rendimentos em relação ao peso da meia-carcaça. A perna foi dissecada em músculo, osso e gordura e os pesos desses tecidos foram expressos em peso absoluto e em porcentagem da perna. Calcularam-se as relações músculo:osso e músculo:gordura, o índice de musculosidade da perna (IMP) e a área de olho-de-lombo (AOL). O aumento de 30 para 60 % de concentrado na dieta elevou os rendimentos de carcaça quente e carcaça fria, assim como o rendimento biológico. Os crescentes teores de concentrado na dieta não afetaram a porcentagem de músculo na perna, mas proporcionaram maior deposição de gordura e maior área de olho-de-lombo. Eighteen lambs {{averaging}} initial {{body weight}} (BW) of 15 kg were allotted to six {{groups of three}} animals (one lamb per diet) and were fed diets with following forage:concentrate ratios (F:C) : 1) 40 F: 60 C; 2) 55 F: 45 C; or 3) 70 F: 30 C. Lambs of each group were slaughtered when the animal fed the diet with the highest concentrate level reached 25 kg of BW. Animals were slaughtered after 16 h of fasting (feed and water). After obtaining the slaughter body weight (SBW), animals were anesthetized by electric discharge and killed by bleeding of the carotid arteries and jugular veins. Blood was then collected and weigthed. Soon after evisceration, skin, head and extremities of the fore and rear members were removed. The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) was emptied, weighted and the value added to that of blood to obtain the empty body weight (EBW), which was calculated by subtracting SBW from GIT + blood weights. The carcasses were weighted and stored at 4 °C within a 24 -hours period. The empty body (EBW), hot carcass (HCW) and cold carcass weights (CCW) were all {{used to calculate the}} biological (BY), hot carcass (HCY) and cold carcass yields (CCY) as well as the weight loss by cooling process (CWL). The carcass was divided in five cuts (leg, loin, ribs, <b>shoulder</b> <b>clod</b> and neck) that were weighted for calculation of cut yields. The leg was dissected in muscle, bone and fat, and weights of these tissues were expressed in absolute weight and in percentage of leg weight. The muscle:bone and muscle:fat ratios, index of leg muscularity (ILM) and the loin eye area (LEA) were also calculated. Increasing dietary concentrate from 30 to 60 % increased not only hot and cold carcass yields but also biological yield. The increasing levels of concentrate in the diet showed no effect on the percentage of leg muscle. However, it was observed an increase in both fat deposition and rib eye area...|$|E

Angus steers (n= 48) were individually fed {{one of three}} dietary treatments in the feedlot finishing phase that included a conventional corn based diet (CON); a treatment containing 35 % dried distillers grains with solubles replacing dry rolled corn (DDGS); and a treatment containing 35 % high protein dried distillers grains replacing dry rolled corn (HPDDG). Including HPDDG in beef cattle finishing diets tended to reduce overall daily feed intake (P= 0. 08); however, average daily gain and final body weight were not affected (P= 0. 49 and P= 0. 54, respectively). There were no differences among treatments for dressing percentage (P= 0. 22), hot carcass weight (P= 0. 54), 12 th rib back fat (P= 0. 18), and percent kidney pelvic and heart fat (P= 0. 35). Longissimus muscle was similar (P= 0. 57) among treatment and averaged 78. 1 cm 2 for across treatments. Average USDA Yield Grades were similar (P= 0. 54) for CON, DDGS, and HPDDG (2. 56, 2. 75, and 2. 69, respectively). Marbling scores (where 500 =small 00, 600 =modest 00) were similar (P= 0. 26) across treatments. Fabrication loss was similar across treatments for the inside round, strip loin, and <b>shoulder</b> <b>clod</b> (P= 0. 20, 0. 36, and 0. 20, respectively). Drip and purge loss percentages were similar across treatments (P= 0. 49 and 0. 16, respectively). Shear force values did not differ among treatments (P= 0. 25) and averaged 2. 54, 2. 37, and 2. 88 kg, respectively. Consumer sensory scores for overall liking (P= 0. 10), texture liking (P= 0. 47), toughness (P= 0. 17), and off flavor (P= 0. 20) did not differ among treatments; however, there was a trend for higher flavor liking ratings for CON steaks compared to HPDDG (P= 0. 06). High protein dried distillers grains steaks were rated the highest for juiciness (8. 49). For cooked sausage, CON rated the highest for overall liking and flavor liking (P= 0. 01 and P= 0. 04, respectively). The CON and HPDDG sausages were rated higher than DDGS for texture liking and toughness (P= 0. 01 and P < 0. 001, respectively). For strip steak objective shelf life, treatment did not affect L* or b* values (P= 0. 87 and 0. 43, respectively), however treatment did affect a* values (P= 0. 0001). Redness values were higher for CON as compared to DDGS and HPDDG. Treatment affected subjective scores for lean color, surface discoloration and overall appearance (P= 0. 0001) of strip steaks. Objective shelf life analysis of ground beef, summer sausage, and bologna indicated that treatment did not affect mean L*, a*, or b* values (P= 0. 15, 0. 16, and 0. 23 respectively). CON ground beef had a more desirable subjective lean color (P= 0. 001) and overall appearance (P= 0. 001) than DDGS and HPDDG. Treatment {{had no effect on}} bologna subjective scores for lean color and surface discoloration (P= 0. 07 and 0. 10, respectively). Treatment did affect mean overall appearance (P= 0. 03), with higher values for CON as compared to DDGS and HPDDG. For summer sausage, there was no effect of treatment on subjective scores for lean color (P= 0. 35) surface discoloration (P= 0. 38) and overall appearance (P= 0. 31). Treatment had no effect on saturated fatty acid and monounsaturated fatty acid percentage (P= 0. 44 and 0. 86 respectively), however; treatment did affect polyunsaturated fatty acid (P= 0. 0001), with CON having lower values than DDGS and HPDDG. There was no difference between treatments on d 0 (P= 0. 50) for lipid oxidation in ground beef, however, on d 7 HPDDG had increased values compared to DDGS and CON (P= 0. 001) as indicated by TBARS. Results indicate that beef cattle finished on diets containing high protein dried distillers grains may replace up to 35 % of corn grain in feedlot diets and not affect carcass characteristics, moisture loss, and shear force of fresh beef products. However, inclusion of HPDDG in the diet at 35 % may increase lipid oxidation resulting in a decrease in shelf life and unfavorable changes in sensory characteristics of fresh steaks.

40|$|The {{objective}} was to evaluate the physics and chemical characteristics, enzymatic activity, fatty acids ratio and quality indexes of the Longissimus and the Triceps brachii of 35 Nellore steers fed protected linseed oil for 35, 70 or 105 days before slaughter, in natura oil or without oil addition for 105 days. The roughage was corn silage (40 % DM) and diets with added oil were isocaloric (76. 1 % TDN and 6. 1 % EE). The animals were confined in individual pens and slaughtered with 522. 71 ± 27. 99 kg of body weight. The diet addition of linseed oil resulted in increased (P< 0. 10) levels of saturated and hypercholesterolemic fatty acids, thrombogenicity and atherogenicity indices, and lower Δ 9 desaturases enzymes activity on meat compared to the treatment with no oil; on the other hand, increased the concentration of conjugated linoleic acid and ω 3 fatty acids, and the ratio ω 6 :ω 3 reduced, but in natura linseed oil was more efficient than the protected form. Increasing the duration time of protected oil supplementation decreased (P< 0. 10) linearly the cholesterol content and the fatty acids ratio ω 6 :ω 3, and increased conjugated linoleic acid and ω 3. The comparison between muscles showed that the Longissimus had higher shear force, lower percentage of cooking losses, total collagen and lipid oxidation compared to Triceps brachii. Higher concentrations of the acids C 14 : 0, C 14 : 1, C 16 : 0, C 18 : 2 cis 9 trans 11, C 18 : 3 ω 6 and C 20 : 0 were found on Longissimus, however, the Triceps brachii accumulated highest levels of C 17 : 1, C 18 : 2 ω 6,C 18 : 3 ω 3, C 20 : 1 ω 9, C 20 : 3 ω 6, C 20 : 4 ω 6, C 20 : 5 ω 3, C 22 : 4 ω 6, C 22 : 6 ω 3 and C 24 : 1 ω 9 acids, showing greater correlation between unsaturated:saturated and polyunsaturated:saturated fatty acid, and we also observed increased elongase activity on <b>shoulder</b> <b>clod</b> than sirloin. Beef incorporates the beneficial aspects for human health of linseed oil fed to fattening steers, even some quality indices were [...] . Objetivou-se avaliar as características físico-químicas, atividade enzimática, relações e índices de qualidade dos ácidos graxos do Longissimus e Triceps brachii de 35 novilhos Nelore alimentados com óleo de linhaça protegido durante 35, 70 ou 105 dias antes do abate, esse óleo na forma in natura ou sem adição de óleo durante 105 dias. O volumoso utilizado foi silagem de milho (40 % da MS) e as dietas com adição de óleo eram isoenergéticas (76, 0 % NDT e 6, 1 % EE). Os animais foram confinados em baias individuais e abatidos com 522, 71 ± 27, 99 kg de peso corporal. A adição de óleo de linhaça na dieta determinou maiores (P< 0, 10) teores de ácidos graxos saturados e hipercolesterolêmicos, índices de trombogenicidade e aterogenicidade e menor atividade das enzimas Δ 9 dessaturases na carne do que a dos animais que não receberam óleo. Por outro lado, aumentou a concentração do ácido linoleico conjugado e ω 3, e reduziu a relação ω 6 :ω 3 mas o óleo in natura foi mais eficiente do que a forma protegida. O aumento do tempo de fornecimento do óleo protegido reduziu (P< 0, 10) linearmente o teor de colesterol e a relação ω 6 :ω 3, e aumentou os ácidos ω 3 e linoleico conjugado. Quanto à comparação entre os músculos, o Longissimus obteve maior força de cisalhamento, menor porcentagem de perdas no cozimento, teor de colágeno total e oxidação lipídica comparado ao Triceps brachii. Maiores concentrações dos ácidos C 14 : 0, C 14 : 1, C 16 : 0, C 18 : 2 cis 9 trans 11, C 18 : 3 ω 6 e C 20 : 0 foram encontradas no Longissimus. Entretanto, o músculo Triceps brachii acumulou maiores teores dos ácidos C 17 : 1, C 18 : 2 ω 6, C 18 : 3 ω 3, C 20 : 1 ω 9, C 20 : 3 ω 6, C 20 : 4 ω 6, C 20 : 5 ω 3, C 22 : 4 ω 6, C 22 : 6 ω 3 e C 24 : 1 ω 9. Portanto, o músculo Triceps brachii apresentou maiores relações entre os ácidos graxos insaturados:saturados e poli-insaturados:saturados, e também foi observada maior atividade da enzima elongase do que no Longissimus.
