40|$|ABSTRACT The {{deployment}} of <b>soluble</b> <b>fertilizers</b> {{has been one}} of the most commonly applied agricultural practices in the bid to increase crop yield. However, the production of <b>soluble</b> <b>fertilizers</b> has a considerable economic cost and consumes a substantial amount of energy. In general, soil organic matter provides the nutrients needed for plant growth in organic agriculture. However, these nutrients are not sufficient if the best yield is to be obtained. The aim of our field experiment was to evaluate the effectiveness of phosphate and potassic sources (rocks, bio-fertilizers and <b>soluble</b> <b>fertilizers)</b> based on several sugarcane characteristics and soil attributes. Our experiment was conducted over two consecutive years, and we assessed the effect of using sugarcane filter mud cake (SFMC). In addition, we mixed the phosphate and potassic sources with earthworm compost enriched in N by inoculation with diazotrophic bacteria (OM) and applied at 50, 100 and 150 % of the recommended dosage rate (RDR). The PK biofertilizer with OM enriched in N positively affected sugarcane height, yield, and industrial characteristics. The application of SFMC greatly increased available P and K in the soil and plant characteristics with residual effect in the two consecutive harvests. We conclude that the biofertilizer has the potential to increase sugarcane characteristics and may represent an alternative to <b>soluble</b> <b>fertilizers...</b>|$|R

The utilization of rock biofertilizers is a practical process that reduces energy consumption and increases nutrient availability in soils. In a field experiment, the effect of biofertilizers produced with phosphate and potash rocks plus Acidithiobacillus inoculation were evaluated on the chemical attributes of an Argisoil from the São Francisco Valley, Pernambuco State, Brazil, after melon cultivation. The experiment was arranged in a factorial 3 ²+ 2 scheme in randomized block design, with four replicates. Two sources of P biofertilizer (PB) and K biofertilizer (KB) were applied in the same doses recommended for simple superphosphate (SS) and potassium chloride (KCl), and in doses which corresponded to two and three times the recommended ones. Additional treatments were carried out (<b>soluble</b> <b>fertilizers</b> (SS) and potassium chloride KCl), applied in the recommended dose, and control treatment with no addition of P and K (P 0 +K 0)). Biofertilizers reduced soil pH and higher available P and K values were obtained when higher doses of biofertilizers (PB and KB) were applied. Mg content increased when KB biofertilizers were applied in higher rates, probably due to the solubilization of Mg present in the biotite.

O experimento foi conduzido em Jaboticabal, SP, Brasil, localizado na Latitude 21 º 15 - 22 " S e Longitude 48 º 18 - 58 " W. Cultivou-se o meloeiro (Cucumis melo L. cv. Bonus nº 2) em substrato, com semeadura realizada em outubro de 2003 e se utilizou delineamento {{experimental}} em blocos casualisados com 16 tratamentos e 5 repetições, em esquema fatorial 4 x 4 (4 substratos e 4 soluções nutritivas). Os 4 substratos se compunham de diferentes proporções da mistura entre a parte sólida do efluente de biodigestor e a areia grossa lavada; as 4 soluções nutritivas foram compostas pela parte líquida do efluente de biodigestor (biofertilizante) em substituição a adubos minerais hidrossolúveis. A adição do efluente à areia proporcionou crescimento vegetativo mais rápido, maior precocidade na colheita, frutos mais pesados e maior produtividade à cultura do meloeiro. Adubos minerais hidrossolúveis utilizados no cultivo de plantas em substrato podem ser parcialmente substituídos pelo biofertilizante estudado. Looking for {{the sustainability}} of a small farming enterprise, the present study focused {{the benefit of the}} biodigestor effluent resulting from the anaerobic fermentation of the bovine manure in a soilless melon plant experiment. The research was conducted in Jaboticabal, in the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil, at latitude of 21 ° 15 - 22 [...] S and a longitude of 48 ° 18 - 58 [...] W. The melon plant (Cucumis melo L. cv Bonus n° 2) was grown with substrate, seedling obtained in 10 / 2003. An experimental design was adapted in a randomized block with 16 treatments and 5 replications in a factorial 4 x 4 (4 substrates and 4 nutrient solutions). The 4 substrates were made up of different proportions in volume of the blend composition taking into consideration both the solid part of the biodigestor effluent and the washed raw sand. The 4 nutrient solutions were made up of the liquid part of the biodigestor effluent (biofertilizer) in substitution to the mineral water <b>soluble</b> <b>fertilizers.</b> The addition of the effluent in the sand led to a more rapid vegetative growth, a more precoceous crop with heavier fruits and a much better yield of melon crop. The mineral water <b>soluble</b> <b>fertilizers</b> used in the cultivation of plants in substrates can be partially replaced by the biofertilizer studied...|$|R
