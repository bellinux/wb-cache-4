40|$|Includes bibliographical references. In {{the mineral}} {{processing}} industry, comminution circuits contain slurries {{composed of a}} mixture of particles of varying degrees of liberation and size. Hydrocyclones are commonly used to classify these particles. If the classification stage is not efficient, both grinding and flotation cannot be optimised or operated efficiently. Ores that are mined in industry contain metals of varying specific gravity, which makes recovery of the desired metal challenging. This study focussed {{on the effect of}} the hydrocyclone spigot to vortex finder diameter ratio, termed as the cone ratio, solids concentration and viscosity on the classification of two dual density ores. The rheological characteristic of the overflow was also evaluated. A UG 2 ore (Upper Group), which consists mainly of silicates, and chromite, and an iron ore, containing mainly iron and silicates, were used as feed material. The UG 2 test work was carried out on a University of Cape Town (UCT) 4 inch Multotec cyclone, while the iron ore test work was carried out on an Anglo-American 4 inch Krebs cyclone. The cyclone performance was assessed using the corrected cut size, water recovery to the underflow, <b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> and feed throughput. The rheological characterisation of both the UG 2 and iron ore were carried out using an AR (ARES-G 2) 1000 EX vane rheometer. The results obtained indicated that the cyclone cone ratio, feed solids concentration and viscosity influence the cyclone performance. For the UG 2 it was observed that as the cone ratio increased the cut size decreased and levelled off at a cone ratio of 1. However, for the iron ore it was observed that the cut size increased with an increase in the cone ratio, until it reached a peak at a cone ratio of approximately 0. 68, before decreasing. The water recovery to the underflow increased with cone ratio and solids concentration and for both ore types. However it was observed that the water recovery was more sensitive to the cone ratio within the range of conditions investigated. The <b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> for the UG 2 ore increased with cone ratio for all solids concentrations investigated and reached a peak at a cone ratio of approximately 1 then decreased. The <b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> for the iron ore illustrated different trends at different feed solids concentration. Between 10 and 20 wt. % feed solids concentration the <b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> for iron ore was fairly constant, while at 50 wt. % solids concentration the <b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> increased with cone ratio and then levelled off at a cone ratio of 0. 67. An increase in the volumetric throughput with cone ratio was observed for both ore types. Rheological characterization revealed Bingham plastic behaviour for both ore types. An increase in the feed viscosity led to an increase in the cut size, water recovery and <b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> for both UG 2 and iron ore. A comparison of the results with a semi mechanistic model revealed a good fit for the volumetric throughput, water recovery and viscosity. However, the <b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> and cut size had more scatter. The standard error for the <b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> model fit was 21 % for UG 2 and 23 % for iron ore while the error for the cut size was 41 % for the UG 2 ore and 43 % for the iron ore. It was recommended that for future work, test work should be carried at a constant pressure in order to assess purely the effect of cone ratio. Furthermore, a coarser ore should be used in order to evaluate the effect of cone ratio and feed viscosity on the individual deportment of the prevalent components in the dual density ore types investigated by carrying out assays...|$|E

The IRS curves are invariant to the column configuration (i. e., feed location and {{total number of}} stages) and therefore, they are useful to set quantitative targets such as minimum energy requirement (minimum condenser and reboiler duties), appropriate feed location, proper feed preconditioning, scope for side-condensers/reboilers, as well as thermo-economic optimization of distillation column. In this paper, {{the relation between the}} IRS curves and exergy loss in an adiabatic distillation column is established through a simple graphical representation.

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the problem of}} accuracy in {{the determination of the}} partition curve of gravity separation processes, which is strongly affected by both the <b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> of the density analysis system used and the width of the density range selected. The problem is important when the density analysis of the separation products cannot be performed using heavy liquids, but has to be performed using heavy suspensions or using other systems such magnetogravimetric separation. The imperfect separation given by these systems and the use of large density ranges lead to the determination of apparent partition curves instead of actual partition curves for the process. In the paper the relation between apparent and actual partition curves is studied under different conditions through a simulation program. For different input data, special diagrams are given which, once the apparent partition curves and the sharpness of the density cuts are known, allow calculation of the actual partition curves and the related parameters...|$|E

For dry separation, creating and sustaining the air dense medium is a complex process which requires intensive investigation. The dynamic stability of the bed which {{plays an important role}} in the <b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> the <b>separation</b> has also been studied. Based on experimental data, four dimensionless groups i. e. Froude number, Reynolds number, ratio of density of fluid and solid and aspect ratio of the system are used to characterize the stability and quality of fluidization. The above stabilized bed is used to beneficiate coarse coal of - 10 + 0. 1 mm size. The quality <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> is judged by ash analysis of the beneficiated coal samples collected from specified heights of the bed. Enrichment is represented as a function of different operating parameters represented by four dimensionless groups obtained from dimensional analysis approach.

40|$|The flow {{behavior}} in hydrocyclones is extremely complex, leading the designers {{to rely on}} empirical equations for predicting cyclone performance. A number of classifying cyclone models have been developed and used in mineral comminution circuit simulators in the past. The problem with these empirical cyclone models is that they cannot be used outside the range of conditions under which they were developed. A semi-mechanistic hydrocyclone model is developed using the dimensionless approach based on both the fluid mechanics concepts from Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations and {{the wide range of}} industrial cyclone performance data. The improved model consist a set of equations for the water split to underflow (R), reduced cut-size (d), throughput (Q) and <b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> the <b>separation</b> (α).

40|$|Mineral {{processing}} is {{the process}} that involves liberation and beneficiation of valuable constituents of an ore. Several physical beneficiation processes exist and one such process is classification. Screens are classification devices sometimes used in the classification stage of closed grinding circuits to separate mill product into different size classes. Poor classification of particles results in reduced throughput, high power consumption and over - grinding. Most {{of the research on}} screening has been done in scalping applications or classification at relatively large cut sizes. There is limited work done on screening at feed sizes of minus 150 μm and there are no robust models for wet fine screening application for use in circuit simulation studies. The effect of feed flow rate, solids concentration and aperture size on wet fine screening performance was evaluated in this study. The range of values of the factors investigated were the feed rate (9, 13, 19, 25, 30 and 35 t/h), screen aperture size (45, 75, 106 and 150 μm) and solids content (30, 40, 50 and 60 %). A pilot Derrick screen plant at Mintek in Johannesburg was used for the experiments on a UG 2 and chromite ore blend. Screen undersize and oversize samples were collected for particle size distribution analysis and mass balance calculations. The samples collected were filtered, de - lumped and split down to masses ranging between 200 and 300 grams for wet screening using the Malvern MasterSizer particle analyser. The results were used to analyse the effect of the investigated factors on the wet fine screening performance. These results were used to develop a wet fine screening model. Results indicate that increased feed flow rate and solids concentration lead to finer cut sizes, reduced <b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> and higher water recoveries to the oversize. An increase in aperture size increased the <b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> and decreased the water recoveries to the oversize. The solids concentration appeared to have a higher effect on cut size than the feed flow rate. The highest cut size and <b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> and lowest water recovery to oversize were attained at the lowest feed rate. The lowest solids concentration produced the best performance with regards to all partition curve properties. The cut size approached the aperture size at the lowest throughput and solids concentration for all aperture sizes. All the efficiency curves exhibited fish hooks at fine particle sizes with the fish hooks becoming more pronounced at higher feed flow rates and solids concentration and smaller aperture sizes. A wet fine screen model that includes multi component ores as well as changes in operating conditions was developed using the 2 - parameter Whiten screen model as a basis. The dimensional analysis approach was applied in developing the sub - models that relate the operating and design parameters to the Whiten model parameters. The dimensional analysis approach was further applied to develop the model that describes the fish hook effect for subsequent incorporation into the overall modified fine screen model. Generally, the modified model is capable of predicting the performance of the wet fine screen reasonably well with minor errors and accommodates for the data that exhibits the fish hook. The model also reduces the fitting process required in the original Whiten model...|$|E
40|$|A more {{efficient}} classifying cyclone (CC) for fine particle classification {{has been developed}} in recent years at the JKMRC. The novel CC, known as the JKCC, has modified profiles of the cyclone body, vortex finder, and spigot when compared to conventional hydrocyclones. The novel design increases the centrifugal force inside the cyclone and mitigates the short circuiting flow that exists in all current cyclones. It also decreases the probability of particle contamination in the place near the cyclone spigot. Consequently the cyclone efficiency is improved while the unit maintains a simple structure. An international patent has been granted for this novel cyclone design. In the first development stage - a feasibility study - a 100 mm JKCC was tested and compared with two 100 mm commercial units. Very encouraging results were achieved, indicating good potential for the novel design. In the second development stage - a scale-up stage - the JKCC was scaled up to 200 mm in diameter, and its geometry was optimized through numerous tests. The performance of the JKCC was compared with a 150 mm commercial unit and exhibited sharper separation, finer separation size, and lower flow ratios. The JKCC is now being scaled up into a full-size (480 mm) hydrocyclone in the third development stage - an industrial study. The 480 mm diameter unit will be tested in an Australian coal preparation plant, and directly compared with a commercial CC operating under the same conditions. Classifying cyclone performance for fine coal could be further improved if the unit is installed in an inclined position. The study using the 200 mm JKCC has revealed that <b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> improved and the flow ratio to underflow was decreased by 43 % as the cyclone inclination was varied from the vertical position (0 °) to the horizontal position (90 °). The separation size was not affected, although the feed rate was slightly decreased. To ensure self-emptying upon shutdown, {{it is recommended that}} the JKCC be installed at an inclination of 75 - 80 °. At this angle the cyclone performance is very similar to that at a horizontal position. Similar findings have been derived from the testing of a conventional hydrocyclone. This may be of benefit to operations that require improved performance from their classifying cyclones in terms of <b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> and flow ratio, while tolerating slightly reduced feed rate.

40|$|The flow in a {{hydrocyclone}} classifier {{is highly}} turbulent complex nature of multi-phase structure, {{which has led}} designers to rely on empirical mathematical models for predicting the performance. A number of classifying cyclone models have been developed and successfully used in mineral comminution circuit simulators {{over the past four}} decades (Plitt, 1976 and Nageswararao, 1978). However, most of the mathematical models currently available to describe hydrocyclone classifier performance are based on single average mineral density component behavior. In industrial comminution circuits, the feed to the cyclone composed of a mixture of particles of varying degrees of liberation and sizes. The behavior of multi-component particles in a hydrocyclone is poorly understood and unaccounted for in most of the mathematical model equations available in the literature. There is evidence from a number of experimental data sets indicating the significant influence of the multi-component particles on measured cyclone performance. A concept for modeling the performance of hydrocyclones based on multi-component behavior is proposed in this paper.

40|$|AbstractFeature {{extraction}} {{is crucial}} to rotating machinery prognosis, which is {{an important aspect of}} condition monitoring as well as maintenance program, since the quality of feature will impact the result significantly. Vibration signals are commonly used as the source for feature extraction during the prognosis process, especially the energy feature of fundamental frequency (which is written as 1 X), 2 X, 3 X, 1 / 2 X, etc. Yet this kind of feature shows insufficiency for identifying stages of performance degradation and classifying the type of early fault, therefore researchers focused mainly on improving the methods of feature extraction to solve this problem. However, features extracted from vibration signals always ignore some fault information such as kinematics information and phase information, thus other source of feature is needed to provide supplement or even substitute for higher efficiency and <b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> in rotating machinery prognosis, which are strongly demanded by today's complex and advanced machines. This paper introduced one kind of classic feature source: shaft orbit, which is widely used in traditional diagnosis for failure classification, into prognosis, and its effectiveness is verified in rotor early unbalance fault identification using features extracted from it, compared with energy features of frequency band extracted from vibration signals. Result shows that shaft orbit feature can be used in identifying different early fault stages of rotor unbalance, which indicates that utilizing shaft orbit as source of feature extraction can provide a new approach of getting early fault features in rotating machinery prognosis...|$|E
40|$|Different {{patterns}} of boundaries between Roma and non-Roma neighbourhoods Vir 1 g T HAS Centre for Economic and Regional Studies, Institute for Regional Studies, Budapest G_S Social segregation, poverty, {{and social policy}} in space According to various sociological surveys, every fifth Roma lives in segregated neighbourhoods, and out of them every third lives in small towns. Small towns {{have been described as}} places, where differing {{patterns of}} segregation and the separation between Roma and non-Roma people appear in a most diversified manner. In my view the status of various parts of the towns, referred to as 2 ̆ 018 segregated' in the development documents and in the narratives of policy makers, is not fixed, but, rather, continually changes, and reflects the relation of townspeople and leaders of local community to poor people and various ethnic groups. In other words, wherever majority society is still stable and has enough resources to uphold the spatial, social and institutional segregation of the Roma, it {{will continue to do so}} in most cases, and it will exactly regulate which parts of the settlement the Roma can move in. Whether the Roma families in the settlement live concentrated in one neighbourhood or in several locations of various status and public perception reflects the degree of separation and the different needs of Roma and non-Roma for segregation, as well as the difference among the various groups of Roma. Based on that, we can establish the existence of sharp physical or/and mental boundaries within the settlements, enclosing the segregated Roma neighbourhood within a given settlement; or blurred boundaries separating such a neighbourhood from the rest of the settlement. The degree of <b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> is mostly influenced by (1) whether a newly segregated neighbourhood was formed during the seventies' programme to eliminate Roma ghettos; (2) how layered the local Roma society is; (3) whether economic co-operation or social contacts exist between Roma and the non-Roma.

40|$|The {{contribution}} describes {{results of}} steam coal washing in water-only (WO) cyclone at various diameter of underflow jets. The overflow jet with {{the diameter of}} 68 mm was used. In the case of underflow the following jet were applied: 18 mm, 15. 6 mm and 14. 5 mm. Washing products were subjected to chemical, grain size and float-sink analyses. Mass yields of these products were also determined to compute the material balance of coal components. Conclusively, the partition curves have been constructed and cut points as well as errors probable and imperfections were determined. The Grumbrecht´s efficiency of preparation was also computed. Ash and total sulphur in dry matter were observed in washing products. The overflow product with the lowest content of ash i. e. 11. 62 % was won at the underflow jet diameter of 18 mm, but also at the lowest yield and combustible matter recovery. The highest recovery of combustible matter was achieved at the diameter of 15. 6 mm, however at the highest ash content [...] The grain size analysis resided in the sieving of overflow and underflow products into following classes:  0. 5 mm, 0. 5  1 mm, 1  2 mm, 2  3 mm and + 3 mm. On the basis of mass yields the partition curves were constructed with the aim to determine a classifying effect. Only {{in the case of}} jet ratio 68 / 18 it was possible to determine basic characteristics: d 50 = 2. 2 mm, Ep = 1. 74. It has to be mentioned that the coarser grain went to overflow and finer concentrated in underflow in all three cases. Hence, it is reverse situation as at a classical classifying hydrocyclone. The float-sink analyses were conducted at the following densities: 1. 3, 1. 4, 1. 5, 1. 7 and 1. 8 gcm- 3. According to obtained results, i. e. mass yields into density classes, the comparison of separation efficiency with regard to the grain size {{as well as to the}} ratio of overflow and underflow jets diameters has been also carried out. The best <b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> was achieved at the underflow jet diameter of 18 mm. Summary parameters are as follows: Ep = 0. 255 and W = 68. 58 %. The both values are almost twice higher as in the case of other jet diameters. Also in this case the errors probable for all grain sizes are the lowest and the Grumbrecht´s efficiencies attain the highest values. As to grain size the best results were obtained for the class of 1 - 2 mm and 2 - 3 mm, respectively, at all tested diameters of underflow jet. The reduction of underflow jet diameter results in a low enhancement of mass yield into overflow as well as in the increasing of ash content and combustible matter recovery in this product. The separation sharpness at smaller jets diameter was worse and the increasing of slurries creation at the mass yield of 40 % with the ash content over 70 % can be observed...|$|E

We propose two novel approaches to visually express emotions in affective agents. Both models employ a simplistic character consisting of an abstract body modelled as a closed sequence of concatenated curves. Emotions are represented in terms of arousal and valence dimensions. In the first model, the arousal value is expressed through the <b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> the curves that comprise the character outline, while the valence value is expressed through the curvature of the character's mouth. In the second model, the arousal value is expressed through the character's movement, while the valence value is expressed through the <b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> the curves that comprise the character outline. Thus, <b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> curvature is used to express arousal in the first model and valence in the second one. The paper also describes a user experiment which investigated whether the arousal and valence expressed by our models are appropriately perceived by the users or not. The results support both models and suggest that <b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> curvature could be used to express arousal or valence if consistently combined with other appropriate modalities...|$|R
