5|$|Considerable {{effort is}} put into {{training}} and education by the Institution, particularly for young people; more than 6,000 children a week are <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> by education volunteers about sea and beach safety, and over 800 children a week receive training. The Institution has saved some 140,000 lives since its foundation, {{at a cost of}} more than 600 lives lost in service.|$|E
5|$|Detectives who had <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> both Green and Farrar {{the night}} of the fire testified as to Green's unusual {{demeanor}} during their interview, and a videotape of the questioning was played, including Green's statements about having urged Tim Farrar to stay in the burning house and her references to her children in the past tense.|$|E

5|$|Majure {{was a man}} who {{yearned to}} please his passengers, and if he made them happy then he also made his airline happy. He had often <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> friends about how {{important}} it was for him to get travelers to their destinations on time and how proud he was of USAir's on-time record. All the same, he was also portrayed as a by-the-book, cautious pilot.|$|E
5|$|Queen Cersei, and {{her twin}} brother, Jaime Lannister, are {{watching}} as the dead body of Jon Arryn, The Hand of The King is tended to by the Silent Sisters.

Jaime assures his sister that if Arryn had <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> anyone, they would already have been executed.|$|E

There's been enough of that.|$|E

5|$|As {{they read}} the end, Joan of Arc is being burnt at the stake, still waiting for God to save her (the real Joan had said several days earlier that her voices had <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> her of martyrdom). Shocked, Lisa asks Homer if she was really burned to death. Marge then interrupts, {{claiming}} that Joan of Arc was rescued by Sir Lancelot, and they get married and live in a spaceship. She then rips out the last page and eats it, remarking that {{it is easier to}} chew than the video of Bambi.|$|E
5|$|His father, Hyman Krustofski, was a rabbi and {{strongly}} opposed young Herschel's wish {{to become a}} comedian; he wanted the boy to go to yeshiva instead. Krusty did attend the school, where he said he made the other students laugh by doing funny impressions of his father. As a result, Krusty became a slapstick comedian behind his father's back. One night, Krusty performed at a rabbi's convention and a rabbi squirted seltzer on him, washing off his clown makeup. Rabbi Krustofski, {{who was in the}} audience, recognized him, was furious and disowned his son, and now it has been 25 years since they have seen or <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> each other.|$|E

5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the third act, Bart argues that modern writers like Steven Bochco, one of the creators of the television series NYPD Blue, are more talented than Shakespeare. Bochco saw the episode with his children and was so flattered that he sent The Simpsons staff some NYPD Blue merchandise. After the ghost of Homer has <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> Bart, he leaves Bart's room by flying through the wall, causing slime to appear on the wall. This is a reference to Slimer, a ghost from the Ghostbusters franchise who has a similar function.|$|E
5|$|Live at Benaroya Hall {{features}} arrangements by British arranger {{and composer}} Paul Buckmaster, who worked previously with Carlile on Give Up the Ghost, and Sean O'Loughlin. Seattle-based producer and audio engineer Martin Feveyear, who had mixed Carlile's debut album {{in addition to}} other live EPs and demos, recorded, mixed, and mastered the album. Carlile had not <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> Feveyear prior to the first rehearsal, but was pleased with the result of his work. Carlile's band included long-time members (and brothers) Phil and Tim Hanseroth on guitar and bass, Josh Neumann on cello, and Allison Miller on drums. The Seattle Symphony was led by Assistant Conductor Eric Garcia.|$|E
5|$|Other {{theories}} {{of foul play}} have suggested an attack by Riffian pirates, who were active {{off the coast of}} Morocco in the 1870s. Charles Edey Fay, in his 1942 account, observes that pirates would have looted the ship, yet the personal possessions of captain and crew, some of significant value, were left undisturbed. In 1925, the historian John Gilbert Lockhart surmised that Briggs, in a fit of a religious mania, had slaughtered all on board and then killed himself. In a later edition of his book Lockhart, who had by then <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> Briggs's descendants, apologized and withdrew this theory.|$|E

6000|$|Angut looked gravely at {{the speaker}} {{for a moment}} or two, and shook his head. Dead silence prevailed. Then in a voice that was unusually soft and deep he said: [...] "I am no angekok.

The winds that whistle round the icebergs and rush among the hummocks on the frozen sea <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> me sometimes; the {{crashing}} ice-cliffs that thunder down the glens <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> me; the noisy rivulets, the rising sun and moon and winking stars all <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> me, though it is difficult to understand what they say; but no familiar spirit ever <b>speaks</b> <b>to</b> me." ...|$|R

5|$|Raetia {{maintained}} its Roman traditions {{longer than the}} rest of Switzerland, but most of it was eventually assimilated as well, leaving only a small territory where a Vulgar Latin dialect, Romansh, is <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> this day. The assassination of Aetius in 454 and the subsequent retreat of Roman forces to the south of the Alps marked the definitive end of Roman power in Switzerland, {{and the beginning of the}} transition to the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosecution}} {{argued that}} Bamber {{had not received}} {{a telephone call from}} his father, that Nevill was too badly injured after the first shots to have <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> anyone, that there was no blood on the kitchen phone that had been left off the hook, and that Nevill would have called the police before calling Bamber. They also argued that, had Bamber really received such a call, he would have dialled 999, alerted the farm workers, then made his way quickly there himself.|$|E
5|$|The small fictional town of Twin Peaks, Washington, {{has been}} {{shocked by the}} murder of schoolgirl Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee) and the {{attempted}} murder of her friend Ronette Pulaski (Phoebe Augustine).

5|$|This {{still left}} {{the problem of}} getting {{government}} support for uranium research. Another friend of Szil√°rd's, the Austrian economist Gustav Stolper, suggested approaching Alexander Sachs, who had access to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Sachs told Szil√°rd that he had already <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> the President about uranium, but that Fermi and Pegram had reported that the prospects for building an atomic bomb were remote. He told Szil√°rd that he would deliver the letter, but suggested that it come from someone more prestigious. For Szil√°rd, Einstein was again the obvious choice. Sachs and Szil√°rd drafted a letter riddled with spelling errors and mailed it to Einstein.|$|E
5|$|While at the hotel, Hendrix {{made several}} {{telephone}} calls. Dannemann said he phoned his lawyer Henry Steingarten, {{asking him to}} find a way out of his contract with his manager Mike Jeffery, and producer Eddie Kramer, for whom Hendrix left a voice message. Mitch Mitchell said that he called Hendrix at the Cumberland on September 17, after having been asked to do so by tour manager Gerry Stickells, who had <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> Hendrix just minutes earlier. Mitchell said that during the phone conversation Hendrix agreed to join him around midnight at the Speakeasy Club for a previously arranged jam session, which included Sly Stone.|$|E
5|$|Columbia Pictures {{executive}} Amy Pascal suggested Angelina Jolie to Noyce, who {{had often}} <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> Jolie {{in the past}} about a desire to create a female spy franchise. Pascal even invited Jolie for a Bond girl role, but the actress playfully replied that she {{was more interested in}} playing James Bond himself instead. Jolie was sent Salts script in September 2008 and liked it. Wimmer, Noyce, and producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura went to visit Jolie at her home in France to discuss a possible script and character change. Writer Brian Helgeland helped with the character development and dialogue of the script based on the notes that came out of those discussions with Jolie and to accompany the gender change, the title character's name was changed to Evelyn Salt.|$|E
