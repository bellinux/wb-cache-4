500|$|An {{early morning}} {{kick-off}} away to fierce rivals Liverpool {{ended in a}} routine victory for United. Losing to Juventus in the last match of the Champions League before hiatus had {{seemed to have no}} effect on United's domestic dominance. They comprehensively defeated Aston Villa thanks to a solitary Giggs goal and followed it up with a heroic Schmeichel performance to deny Newcastle United at St James' Park. British Prime Minister Tony Blair, a lifelong fan of the Geordies, was among the crowd and was in awe over Ferguson's team, believing that the manager had assembled [...] "one of the greatest sides of the century". Two out of two became three as Everton found no answer to deny the league leaders, who extended their lead {{at the top of the}} table to six points on Boxing Day. The win marked the end of Karel Poborský's spell, coming on for David Beckham in the second half ahead of a switch to Graeme Souness' Benfica. However, what was to come at the end of December exemplified the vulnerability of the defence during the second half of the season. In losing to mid-table Coventry City two days after the Everton win, United blew the chance to open up a nine-point lead at the top of the table, which would virtually <b>slam</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> shut on the challengers. They again found themselves a goal down, this time courtesy of Noel Whelan, Solskjær and Sheringham responded to restore the advantage back on the champions but a Dion Dublin penalty and mazy run from youngster Darren Huckerby in the last minute ensured an implausible victory, given the fact that Coventry were 2–1 down with five minutes to go. Prior to the game, Ferguson highlighted the fact that the league [...] "wasn't won in December", but following the defeat blasted his side's display as [...] "silly" [...] and [...] "on the verge of complacency".|$|E
2500|$|Adamski {{informed}} a London newspaper {{about the}} invitation, which prompted {{the court and}} cabinet to request that the queen cancel her private audience with Adamski, but the queen went ahead with the audience, saying, [...] "A hostess cannot <b>slam</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{in the face of}} her guests." [...] After the audience, Dutch Aeronautical Association president Cornelis Kolff said [...] "The Queen showed an extraordinary interest in the whole subject." [...] The Royal Netherlands Air Force Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Haye Schaper said [...] "The man's a pathological case." [...] Wire services such as United Press International and Reuters circulated reports of the meeting to newspapers around the world.|$|E
60|$|With a quick {{movement}} Kemp {{thrust the}} Invisible Man back, sprang aside, and <b>slammed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> <b>The</b> key was outside and ready. In another moment Griffin {{would have been}} alone in the belvedere study, a prisoner. Save for one little thing. The key had been slipped in hastily that morning. As Kemp <b>slammed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> it fell noisily upon the carpet.|$|R
60|$|Dow, however, {{had already}} entered <b>the</b> house and <b>slammed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R
60|$|Uneasy, frightened, then horrified, Mrs. Zapp swung bulkily {{about and}} <b>slammed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The queen {{was noted}} for her {{courtesy}} and kindness. In May 1959, for example, Polish-American ufologist George Adamski {{received a letter}} from the head of the Dutch Unidentified Flying Objects Society, Rey d'Aquilla, informing him that she had been contacted by Queen Juliana's palace and [...] "that the Queen would like to receive you". Adamski informed a London newspaper about the invitation, which prompted the court and cabinet to request that the queen cancel her meeting with Adamski, but the queen went ahead with the meeting, saying that [...] "A hostess cannot <b>slam</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> in the face of her guests." [...] After the meeting, Dutch Aeronautical Association president Cornelis Kolff said: [...] "The Queen showed an extraordinary interest in the whole subject." [...] The Dutch press put it more straightforwardly. According to Time magazine, Amsterdam newspaper de Volkskrant said: [...] "The Dutch press could hardly be accused of concealing the facts last week. Once again, Queen Juliana's weakness for the preternatural had landed her back in the headlines: she had invited to the palace a crackpot from California who numbered among his friends men from Mars, Venus and other solar-system suburbs." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Giants' {{lead was}} brief. [...] Lewis {{doubled in the}} bottom of the eighth, and then Fletcher's terrible day {{continued}} with his third error allowing Larry Gardner to reach base and Lewis to score. [...] This tied the game 5–5. [...] In the ninth, Boston reliever Charley Hall, who had replaced Ray Collins in the eighth, got the first two outs but proceeded to walk Snodgrass, Larry Doyle and Beals Becker consecutively. [...] But with the bases loaded, Red Murray grounded into a forceout and the Red Sox escaped. [...] Boston went quietly {{in the bottom of}} the ninth, setting up extra innings. [...] Fred Merkle led off the New York tenth with a triple and scored on a sacrifice fly to give the Giants a 6–5 lead. [...] Mathewson, who pitched the entire game for New York, came back to the mound {{in the bottom of the}} tenth with a chance to <b>slam</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> on Boston and even the Series at one game apiece, but Tris Speaker, who had hit [...]383 in the regular season, slammed an extra-base hit to center field. [...] Giant third baseman Buck Herzog deliberately collided with Speaker to prevent an inside-the-park home run, but Speaker got up and came home anyway. [...] Becker threw the ball in to cutoff man Tillie Shafer, who threw to the plate but catcher Art Wilson dropped the ball—for New York's fifth error of the game—and Speaker, who was credited with a triple on the play, scored to tie the game 6–6. [...] McGraw claimed, and reporters in the press box agreed, that Speaker had missed first base, but base umpire Cy Rigler ruled that he hadn't on appeal. [...] Lewis followed with a double to put the winning run in scoring position, but Mathewson retired Gardner and Stahl to escape the inning with a tie.|$|E

60|$|He hurried {{them out}} and <b>slammed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> behind him. He took Susie's hand.|$|R

60|$|Barney {{was close}} behind him, but fear lent wings to the {{governor}} of Blentz, {{so that he was}} able to dart into the passage behind the picture and <b>slam</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> behind him a moment before the infuriated man was upon him.|$|E
60|$|The carts {{moved off}} without a word, and Sidney went into <b>the</b> house and <b>slammed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R

60|$|She {{went out}} (perhaps she <b>slammed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> a little, in an unemancipated way) to Mrs. Wade's room.|$|R
60|$|Mr Mantalini, who had doubtless well {{considered}} his part, no sooner heard these words pronounced {{in a tone}} of grief and severity, than he recoiled several paces, assumed an expression of consuming mental agony, rushed headlong from the room, and was, soon afterwards, heard to <b>slam</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of an upstairs dressing-room with great violence.|$|E
6000|$|He was {{now about}} to <b>slam</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> in his visitor's face without further ceremony, when Alan, who had {{observed}} symptoms {{that the name}} of Redgauntlet did not seem altogether so indifferent {{to him as he}} pretended, arrested his purpose by saying, in a low voice, 'At least you can tell me what age the moon is?' ...|$|E
60|$|He began a {{long history}} of three days in the metropolis. I listened, and heard little. I heard more plainly the cry of some night birds over Nethermere, and the peevish, wailing, yarling cry of some beast in the wood. I was thankful to <b>slam</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> behind me, to stand {{in the light of the}} hall.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, and a fat {{lot of good}} it's done us," [...] said Naughten. [...] "They come in {{here and}} jaw our heads off when we ought to be jawin' them.

All your fault, Tulke." ...|$|E
60|$|Old Sam said it wasn't {{right to}} play with a gal's 'art in that way, but arter a lot o' talking and telling Sam to shut up, Ginger took the bet.

60|$|Without a sound he lunged to the floor, dead; but {{the women}} without had caught a {{fleeting}} glimpse of what had taken place within the little chamber, even before Barbara Harding could <b>slam</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> again, and with shrieks of rage and fright they rushed into {{the main street of}} the village shouting at the tops of their voices that Oda Yorimoto and Hawa Nisho had been slain by the woman of the sei-yo-jin.|$|E
60|$|He drew Holt {{out into}} the hall, where Pepper waited. Some one <b>slammed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and began to curse.|$|R
