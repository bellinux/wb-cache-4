5|$|At night, Francis spies on Dr. Caligari and observes {{what appears}} to be Cesare <b>sleeping</b> <b>in</b> his box. However, the real Cesare sneaks into Jane's home as she sleeps. He raises a knife to stab her, but instead abducts her after a struggle, {{dragging}} her through the window onto the street. Chased by an angry mob, Cesare eventually drops Jane and flees; he soon collapses and dies. Francis also confirms that the caught criminal has been locked away and could not have been the attacker. Francis and the police investigate Dr. Caligari's sideshow and realize that the 'Cesare' <b>sleeping</b> <b>in</b> the box is only a dummy. Dr. Caligari escapes in the confusion. Francis follows and sees Caligari go through the entrance of an insane asylum.|$|E
5|$|In 2015 {{a common}} grey seal {{found its way}} from the Wash up the river and spent a few weeks <b>sleeping</b> <b>in</b> gardens next to the river in Deeping St James. The seal was spotted further {{downstream}} in Spalding as it eventually made its {{way back to the}} sea.|$|E
5|$|Paul Newman as Hud Bannon, the arrogant, self-centered son of rancher Homer Bannon. To {{prepare for}} the role Newman worked for ten days on a Texas ranch, <b>sleeping</b> <b>in</b> a bunkhouse.

5|$|Although fewer postcranial remains {{have been}} {{discovered}} for Hadropithecus than for Archaeolemur, what has been found indicates that both were adapted for a terrestrial or semi-terrestrial lifestyle, an unusual trait for lemurs. Both genera had short limbs and a powerful build. Due to its specialized dentition and likely diet, Hadropithecus {{is thought to have}} been the more terrestrial of the two, since Archaeolemur may have sent more time foraging and <b>sleeping</b> <b>in</b> the trees. Both genera also have shortened hands and feet, an adaptation for walking on the ground.|$|E
5|$|At least 116 {{people were}} killed, most being {{children}} <b>sleeping</b> <b>in</b> their beds, {{with more than}} 68 missing and over 13,500 left homeless in Nicaragua. At least 1,300 houses and 185 fishing boats were destroyed along {{the west coast of}} Nicaragua. Total damage in Nicaragua was estimated at between 20 and 30 million U.S. dollars.|$|E
5|$|Conditions in {{the casual}} wards were worse {{than in the}} {{relieving}} rooms and deliberately designed to discourage vagrants, who were considered potential trouble-makers and probably disease-ridden. Vagrants who presented themselves {{at the door of}} a workhouse were {{at the mercy of the}} porter, whose decision it was whether or not to allocate them a bed for the night in the casual ward. Those refused entry risked being sentenced to two weeks of hard labour if they were found begging or <b>sleeping</b> <b>in</b> the open and prosecuted for an offence under the Vagrancy Act 1824.|$|E

30|$|For {{adopting}} <b>sleeping</b> mode <b>in</b> MBSs, some researches {{verify that}} energy consumption of MBSs can be significantly reduced {{while maintaining the}} downlink coverage and user power consumption performance [10]. Soh et al. study the overage extension and energy saving problems in [11], where closed-form expression for macrocell user equipment (MUE) coverage probability is derived. The purpose of MBSs is to maintain network coverage, meanwhile MBSs increase energy consumption tremendously. Only adopting <b>sleeping</b> mode <b>in</b> FAPs can keep coverage while can not effectively reduce system energy consumption. On the other hand, only adopting <b>sleeping</b> mode <b>in</b> MBSs effectively reduces system energy consumption while reduces the network coverage. So adopting <b>sleeping</b> mode <b>in</b> both MBSs and FAPs can reach a tradeoff between coverage and energy consumption.|$|R
5|$|During {{the last}} years of his life, Santos toured the United States and Latin-America, while {{experiencing}} health problems. He continued performing with several music groups. While he performed with the Sonora Matancera, Santos suffered a heart attack while he was <b>sleeping</b> <b>in</b> a hotel located in La Reforma after eating dinner. Santos continued performing during the following decades, making presentations in several Latin American countries. He continued to sing the songs which he had written during his career until he finally retired and established a residence in Florida.|$|E
5|$|In {{one shot}} Guinness appears as seven of his {{characters}} at {{once in a}} single frame. This was accomplished by masking the lens.

5|$|Nirjarā is {{possible}} through tapas, austerities and penances. Tapas {{can be either}} external or internal. Six forms of external tapas are—fasting, control of appetite, accepting food under certain conditions, renunciation of delicious food, sitting and <b>sleeping</b> <b>in</b> lonely place and renunciation of comforts. Six forms of internal tapas are—atonement, reverence, rendering of service to worthy ones, spiritual study, avoiding selfish feelings and meditation.|$|E

She stops in the ICU where a John Doe (Dallas), Prince Charming, is <b>sleeping</b> <b>in</b> a coma. Mary Margaret is unaware of who he is. Meanwhile, at the Mayor's home, Regina takes the book from Henry's room and goes downstairs {{to look at her}} mirror, with an expression that seems to acknowledge she is aware of her fairy tale existence.|$|E
5|$|The 1895 {{capture of}} the Merina royal capitol, the Rova of Antananarivo, by the French sparked the Menalamba {{rebellion}} against foreigners, Christianity and Merina domination. In the chaotic 1895–97 period, bands of Sakalava, Marofotsy and other bandits engaged in raids to loot cattle and other goods. The Sihanaka were especially hard hit owing to their reputation as a relatively wealthy trading people. Many Sihanaka villagers resorted to <b>sleeping</b> <b>in</b> the forests and fields to avoid falling victim to nighttime pillage and arson; entire Sihanaka villages were burned.|$|E
5|$|The Norwich School {{continued}} the landscape tradition, while the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood with their vivid and detailed style revived the Early Renaissance style—Holman Hunt, Dante Gabriel Rossetti and John Everett Millais were leaders. Prominent amongst 20th-century artists was Henry Moore, {{regarded as the}} voice of British sculpture, and of British modernism in general. Contemporary painters include Lucian Freud, whose work Benefits Supervisor <b>Sleeping</b> <b>in</b> 2008 set a world record for sale value of a painting by a living artist.|$|E

5|$|When Sunday {{began to}} attract crowds larger {{than could be}} {{accommodated}} in rural churches or town halls, he pitched rented canvas tents. Again, Sunday did much of the physical work of putting them up, manipulating ropes during storms, and seeing to their security by <b>sleeping</b> <b>in</b> them at night. Not until 1905 was he well-off enough to hire his own advance man.|$|E
5|$|William Thompson {{was born}} on 16 August 1927 in Brooklyn, New York to an {{unmarried}} mother. Little is known of Thompson's early life, but {{he grew up in}} an impoverished tenement house neighborhood. He dropped out of school at a young age, and spent his teen years wandering the streets. A local minister noticed Thompson <b>sleeping</b> <b>in</b> a park one evening and took him to a homeless shelter, the New York Home for Homeless Boys. Thompson remained a resident there until he turned 18 in 1945.|$|E
5|$|After {{crossing}} the Rio Grande and arriving at Ojo de Agua at approximately 1am, the Mexican raiders attacked the village's garrison. The American {{soldiers who had}} been <b>sleeping</b> <b>in</b> a wooden building stubbornly resisted. The Americans were heavily outgunned, though, as the Signal Corps personnel were armed only with pistols. In the fighting Sergeant Schaeffer was killed, {{and as a result}} command devolved to Sergeant First Class Herbert Reeves Smith who by that time had also been wounded three times. In addition to attacking the garrison, the raiders robbed the post office and attacked the home of the Dillard family, setting their house on fire and stealing their livestock.|$|E

5|$|Agârbiceanu {{recalled}} {{an idyllic}} childhood, with summers spent tending to his father's sheep and <b>sleeping</b> <b>in</b> a stick hut. An avid reader of stories by Petre Ispirescu, he attended school {{in his native}} village and in Blaj, graduating from the Superior Gymnasium in 1900. Literary historians describe this as the period of his literary debut, which was a collaboration with Unirea newspaper. There, Agârbiceanu published a feuilleton (signed as Alfius), poetry, and, in 1900, the short story În postul Paștelui ("At Lent"). Agârbiceanu also served {{as secretary of the}} Blaj Literary Society, at the time the city's only Romanian-speaking literary body still tolerated by the Hungarian authorities. He soon became a correspondent of Răvașul, a Cluj-based newspaper, signing his first pieces there with the pen name Alfius, then as Agarbi or Potcoavă ("Horseshoe").|$|E
5|$|Collier {{applied to}} the Admiralty for the {{opportunity}} to clear his name, but this was not satisfied. Friends and relations had become increasingly concerned about his mental state as a result. His brother took the precaution of removing the razors from his home, but Collier appears to have smuggled one to his room, and used it to cut his own throat early in the morning on 24 March 1824. His servant who was <b>sleeping</b> <b>in</b> the same room immediately brought help, but nothing could be done and Collier died less than five minutes after inflicting the injury. The inquest later determined that 'The deceased destroyed himself, being in a state of temporary mental derangement.' The baronetcy became extinct upon his death.|$|E
5|$|Dahl {{was told}} by radio {{executives}} that he'd never make it in radio because his voice was too high. At one point, Dahl was so discouraged that he quit {{for about six months}} and attempted to pursue a career as a recording engineer. However, this never amounted to anything more than making mix tapes of popular songs for play on airplanes. Throughout this time period, he was making efforts to reconcile with his ex-wife, who by then was dating the program director at the Los Angeles radio station where she worked. He later admitted to stalking her by <b>sleeping</b> <b>in</b> his Subaru outside her house.|$|E
