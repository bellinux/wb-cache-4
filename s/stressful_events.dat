5|$|Most {{pituitary}} hormones can {{be replaced}} indirectly by administering {{the products of the}} effector glands: hydrocortisone (cortisol) for adrenal insufficiency, levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, testosterone for male hypogonadism, and estradiol for female hypogonadism (usually with a progestogen to inhibit unwanted effects on the uterus). Growth hormone is available in synthetic form, but needs to be administered parenterally (by injection). Antidiuretic hormone {{can be replaced}} by desmopressin (DDAVP) tablets or nose spray. Generally, the lowest dose of the replacement medication is used to restore wellbeing and correct the deranged results, as excessive doses would cause side-effects or complications. Those requiring hydrocortisone are usually instructed to increase their dose in physically <b>stressful</b> <b>events</b> such as injury, hospitalization and dental work as these are times when the normal supplementary dose may be inadequate, putting the patient at risk of adrenal crisis.|$|E

25|$|The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis) regulates {{cortisol}} production, {{which is}} released {{in response to}} stress. Cortisol production tends to be elevated in people with BPD, indicating a hyperactive HPA axis in these individuals. This causes them to experience a greater biological stress response, which might explain their greater vulnerability to irritability. Since traumatic events can increase cortisol production and HPA axis activity, {{one possibility is that}} the prevalence of higher than average activity in the HPA axis of people with BPD may simply be a reflection of the higher than average prevalence of traumatic childhood and maturational events among people with BPD. Another possibility is that, by heightening their sensitivity to <b>stressful</b> <b>events,</b> increased cortisol production may predispose those with BPD to experience stressful childhood and maturational events as traumatic.|$|E

Although changes related to infectious disease and wound healing have provided the strongest evidence to date, the clinical importance of immunological dysregulation is highlighted by increased risks across diverse conditions and diseases. For example, stressors can produce profound health consequences. In one epidemiological study, all-cause mortality increased in the month following a severe stressor – {{the death of a}} spouse. Theorists propose that <b>stressful</b> <b>events</b> trigger cognitive and affective responses which, in turn, induce sympathetic nervous system and endocrine changes, and these ultimately impair immune function.

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{traumatic}} experiences is traditionally {{examined in the}} context of posttraumatic stress disorder which assumes a causal link between trauma exposure and psychopathology. The thesis challenges this assumption by implementing a diathesis-stress perspective accounting for <b>stressful</b> <b>event</b> severity and its interaction with two cognitive vulnerability factors modulating posttraumatic outcome: self-control and appraisal. Self-control variables of impulsive behavioral tendencies and emotion regulation differentially impacted outcome as a function of trauma, such that adaptive and maladaptive emotional responses were observed. Negative appraisals of the self were related to posttraumatic symptoms regardless of <b>stressful</b> <b>event</b> severity, while memory appraisals for mainly positive events were less intense as a function of <b>stressful</b> <b>event</b> severity. In line with the diathesis-stress perspective, the overall findings demonstrated that <b>stressful</b> <b>event</b> severity is a catalyst for activating vulnerability factors associated with posttraumatic symptoms, and that posttraumatic outcome is a dimensional representation encompassing psychopathology and resilience...|$|R

25|$|This type {{of therapy}} uses {{a blend of}} cognitive, {{behavioral}} and some humanistic training techniques to target the stressors of the client. This usually is used to help clients better cope with their stress or anxiety after <b>stressful</b> <b>events.</b> This is a three-phase process that trains the client to use skills that they already have to better adapt to their current stressors. The first phase is an interview phase that includes psychological testing, client self-monitoring, {{and a variety of}} reading materials. This allows the therapist to individually tailor the training process to the client. Clients learn how to categorize problems into emotion-focused or problem-focused, so that they can better treat their negative situations. This phase ultimately prepares the client to eventually confront and reflect upon their current reactions to stressors, before looking at ways to change their reactions and emotions in relation to their stressors. The focus is conceptualization.|$|E
25|$|Even well-intentioned support can {{negatively}} {{impact the}} care recipient's psychological adjustment to <b>stressful</b> <b>events</b> {{if it is}} inappropriate or excessive, or inadvertently highlights {{the fact that the}} care recipient does not have sufficient skills or resources to handle the stressor by him- or herself. Consequently, Niall Bolger and colleagues have put forward the idea that support is most effective when it is invisible, or operates outside of the care-recipient's direct awareness. To investigate this proposition, the researchers recruited couples in which one member was a law student preparing to undergo a highly stressful event, the New York State Bar Examination, and had both members of the couple complete daily diary entries about given and received emotional support. They found that the law students exhibited heightened levels of depression on days they reported receiving support, but lowered levels of depression on the days when their partners reported providing more support than the law students reported receiving. That is, participants in this study gained most psychological benefits from support they were not explicitly aware of having received. However, other researchers have argued that the responsiveness of enacted support is a more important factor than the visibility of the support. One study examining the effects of visible and invisible support on emotional and relationship well-being showed that visible support was linked to neutral or positive outcomes when it was high in responsiveness, and invisible support was linked to negative outcomes when it was low in responsiveness. That is, visible support is not always negative and invisible support is not always positive, but the effectiveness of both types of support hinges on responsiveness.|$|E

Research has shown that when facing a <b>stressful</b> life <b>event,</b> an individual can experience negative and lasting consequences long after the event is over. All subjects used in this study were VCU juniors who entered VCU in the fall of 2011 (n= 970). Participants were asked about exposure to different types of traumatic life events (natural disaster, transportation accident or assault). <b>Stressful</b> life <b>events</b> were also measured by creating a sum score based on the total number of <b>stressful</b> life <b>events</b> a person experienced.

Forty-four PhD students completed evening and morning questionnaires on eight days from 1 &#x 00 A 0;month before their dissertation defense until one month thereafter. Results showed increased stress leading up to the defense, while fatigue and sleep quality remained unchanged. Comparing the night before the defense with the night after, stress rapidly decreased, whereas fatigue and sleep quality increased. Following the defense, stress and sleep quality remained stable, whereas fatigue declined. Stress 1 &#x 00 A 0;month before the defense was higher than 1 &#x 00 A 0;month thereafter. Regarding day-level relations, stress was adversely affected by negative anticipation and favorably by positive outcome expectancy, whereas positive anticipation had no influence. Positive outcome expectancy was an important predictor of improved sleep quality. We conclude that stress may be elevated long before a <b>stressful</b> <b>event</b> takes place but that one can recover rather quickly from temporary stress. Positive outcome expectancy of a <b>stressful</b> <b>event</b> may be an important predictor of reduced day-level stress and improved day-level sleep quality leading up to a <b>stressful</b> <b>event...</b>|$|R

40|$|Objective: <b>Stressful</b> life <b>events,</b> longterm difficulties, {{and high}} {{neuroticism}} are established {{risk factors for}} depression. Less is known about their role in late-life depression, how they modify or mediate one another's effects, and whether this differs between major and subsyndromal, first and recurrent episodes. Method: The authors used a prospective case-control design nested in a community survey of elderly subjects that included a measure of neuroticism. They compared 83 survey participants who subsequently developed a depressive episode with 83 randomly selected comparison participants. The authors determined dates of onset, history, and severity of episodes and dates of occurrence and severity of <b>stressful</b> life <b>events</b> and difficulties. Results: <b>Stressful</b> life <b>events</b> did not mediate the effects of high neuroticism and difficulties at onset, possibly because of the uncontrollable nature of common <b>stressful</b> life <b>events</b> in later life. Without both high neuroticism and difficulties, <b>stressful</b> life <b>events</b> did not increase risk. High neuroticism and difficulties increased risk, even without a <b>stressful</b> life <b>event.</b> In the presence of high neuroticism and/or difficulties, the depressogenic effect of <b>stressful</b> life <b>events</b> was substantial, suggesting effect modification. The authors found no evidence to suggest etiological discontinuity between major and subsyndromal episodes. First and recurrent episodes showed a discontinuous pattern of associations. Severe <b>stressful</b> life <b>events</b> had weaker associations, but high neuroticism and mild <b>stressful</b> life <b>events</b> had stronger associations with recurrent than with first episodes. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the usefulness of a dynamic stress-vulnerability model for understanding late-life depression.

The analyses were based on longitudinal data from 2 studies, including samples of 328 young adults (Study 1) and 371 adults (Study 2). The effects of self-esteem and narcissism were mutually controlled for each other and, moreover, controlled for effects of depression. After conducting the study-level analyses, we meta-analytically aggregated the findings. Self-esteem had a selection effect, suggesting that low self-esteem led to the occurrence of stressful life events; however, this effect became nonsignificant when depression was controlled for. Regardless of whether depression was controlled for or not, narcissism had a selection effect, suggesting that high narcissism led to the occurrence of <b>stressful</b> life <b>events.</b> Moreover, <b>stressful</b> life <b>events</b> had a socialization effect on self-esteem, but not on narcissism, suggesting that the occurrence of <b>stressful</b> life <b>events</b> decreased self-esteem.
