50|$|The {{distinct}} pattern {{produced by}} Čerenkov radiation allows for particle identification, {{an important tool}} both understanding the potential proton decay signal and for rejecting backgrounds. The ID is possible because the <b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the ring depends on the particle producing the radiation. Electrons (and therefore also gamma rays) produce fuzzy rings due to the multiple scattering of the low mass electrons. Minimum ionizing muons, in contrast produce very sharp rings as their heavier mass allows them to propagate directly.|$|E
50|$|A {{neutrino}} {{interaction with}} the electrons or nuclei of water can produce a charged particle that moves faster {{than the speed of}} light in water (not to be confused with exceeding the speed of light in a vacuum). This creates a cone of light known as Cherenkov radiation, which is the optical equivalent to a sonic boom. The Cherenkov light is projected as a ring {{on the wall of the}} detector and recorded by the PMTs. Using the timing and charge information recorded by each PMT, the interaction vertex, ring direction and flavor of the incoming neutrino is determined. From the <b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the ring the type of particle can be inferred. The multiple scattering of electrons is large, so electromagnetic showers produce fuzzy rings. Highly relativistic muons, in contrast, travel almost straight through the detector and produce rings with sharp edges.|$|E

As a result, the need to display and print digital images has increased. Nowadays, highresolution display and printing devices are available to users. Therefore, high-resolution images are {{needed in order to}} produce high quality displayed images and high quality prints.

40|$|Self-gravitating stellar disks with {{random motion}} support both {{exponentially}} growing and, in some cases, purely oscillatory axisymmetric bending modes, unlike their cold disk counterparts. A razor-thin disk with even {{a very small}} degree of random motion in the plane is both unstable and possesses a discrete spectrum of neutral modes, irrespective of the <b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge.</b> Random motion normal to the disk plane has a stabilizing effect {{but at the same}} time allows bending waves to couple to the internal vibrations of the particles, which causes the formerly neutral modes to decay through Landau damping. Focusing first on instabilities, I here determine the degree of random motion normal to the plane needed to suppress global, axisymmetric, bending instabilities in a family of self-gravitating disks. As found previously, bending instabilities are suppressed only when the thickness exceeds that expected from a naïve local criterion when the degree of pressure support within the disk plane is comparable to, or exceeds, the support from rotation. A modest disk thickness is adequate for the bending stability of most disk galaxies, except perhaps near their centers. The discretization of the neutral spectrum in a zero-thickness disk is due to the existence of a turning point for bending waves in a warm disk, which is absent when the disk is cold. When the disk is given a finite thickness, the discrete neutral modes generally become strongly damped through wave-particle interactions. It is surprising therefore that I find some simulations of warm, stable disks can support (quasi-) neutral, large-scale, bending modes that decay very slowly, if at all.

One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reasons for the FWI failure is that the updates at earlier iterations are too smooth to capture <b>the</b> sharp <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> salt boundary. We compare several regularization approaches, which promote <b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges.</b> Minimum gradient support (MGS) regularization focuses the inversion on blocky models, {{even more than the}} total variation (TV) does. However, both approaches try to invert undesirable high wavenumbers in the model too early for a model of complex structure. Therefore, we apply the Sobolev space norm as a regularizing term in order to maintain a balance between sharp and smooth updates in FWI. We demonstrate <b>the</b> application <b>of</b> these regularizations on a Marmousi model, enriched by a chunk <b>of</b> salt. <b>The</b> model turns out to be too complex in some parts to retrieve its full velocity distribution, yet the salt shape and contrast are retrieved...|$|R
