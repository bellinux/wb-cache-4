Parents, 15 F 1 crosses and 4 filler genotypes, were evaluated in a 5 × 5 simple lattice design. For all the traits studied, except seed length, the efficiency of lattice design was less than one. Therefore, data were analysed as a randomized complete block and after eliminating the filler genotypes, Grriffing’s method 2 with mixed B model was used in the genetic analyses. General and specific combining ability (GCA and SCA) mean squares were statistically significant for all traits studied. The ratios of GCA to SCA mean squares were greater than one for all traits, except for the number of <b>seed</b> <b>rows</b> per ear, indicating the importance of non-additive gene effects in their genetic control. Low heritability estimates and degrees of dominance lower than one were further evidence of the presence of non additive gene effects for all the traits studied, except for the number of <b>seed</b> <b>rows</b> per ear. Therefore, production of single cross hybrids in order to take advantage of non-additive gene effects is of prime importance for grain yield, number of <b>seeds</b> per ear <b>row,</b> l 00 -seed weight, seed length, ear length, and comb percentage. For genetic improvement of number of <b>seed</b> <b>rows</b> per ear, selection methods for parental lines will be more efficient. In the hybrids studied, number of <b>seed</b> per ear <b>row</b> and l 00 -seed weight played a more important role in the observed variations in yield.

In the second case, the <b>seed</b> <b>rows</b> themselves were detected by the camera without making use of the marker disc. In both cases, several video sequences were acquired in various situations, including different soil textures and various illumination conditions (375 sequences were acquired during three years).

In the first case, the best results were obtained by using an image treatment based on the Hough transform coupled to a recursive filter. The search of the maximum of the Hough transform was performed using a mean shift algorithm. In the second case, where several parallel rows were simultaneously present on the images, an adapted Hough transform was proposed which took into account the a priori knowledge of the rows spacing. The trueness and precision in row detection were superior in the second case. The results are compatible with the application, since the trueness was smaller than 30 mm.

Considerably higher yield of fenugreek seed in all variations was obtained in the second study year which was probably caused by more favorable precipitation during vegetation period. Average temperature during vegetation period was similar in both study years, therefore it could not have influenced significantly the differences in yield and quality of seed. The highest seed yield was achieved in both study years in case of seeding method with 50 cm distance between <b>seeding</b> <b>rows</b> and 10 cm distance between plants in a row.

In 1986, the thiocarbamate herbicides, vernolate (Surpass), EPTC (Eptam, Genep) and butylate (Swan +, Genate plus) were evaluated as preplant and postemergence incorporated applications for selective control of purple nutsedge in cotton.

40|$|Development {{in higher}} plants {{depends on the}} {{activity}} of meristems, formative regions that continuously initiate new organs at their flanks. Meristems must maintain a balance between stem cell renewal and organ initiation. In fasciated mutants, organ initiation fails {{to keep pace with}} meristem proliferation. The thick tassel dwarf 1 (td 1) mutation of maize affects both male and female inflorescence development. The female inflorescence, which results in the ear, is fasciated, with extra rows of kernels. The male inflorescence, or tassel, shows an increase in spikelet density. Floral meristems are also affected in td 1 mutants; for example, male florets have an increase in stamen number. These results suggest that td 1 functions in the inflorescence to limit meristem size. In addition, td 1 mutants are slightly shorter than normal siblings, indicating that td 1 also plays a role in vegetative development. td 1 encodes a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK) that is a putative ortholog of the Arabidopsis CLAVATA 1 protein.

40|$|Subsurface drip {{irrigation}} (SDI) is gaining popularity with {{producers in the}} Southern and Central Great Plains region of the United States. Drip laterals are commonly installed in alternate furrows because it is cost prohibitive to install laterals in every bed for low value crops; however, crop germination can be difficult if preseason precipitation is inadequate. We evaluated soybean emergence and grain yield with laterals installed in wide beds containing two seed rows and compared this to laterals installed in alternate furrows and in every bed. The wide bed design requires {{the same number of}} laterals as the alternate furrow design, but the <b>seed</b> <b>row</b> is closer to the lateral. For each bed design, lateral burial depth was 6 -, 9 -, and 12 -in., and irrigation amounts were 33, 66, and 100 % of full crop evapotranspiration (ETc). The wide bed design generally resulted in greater plant emergence early in the season than standard beds; however, bed design and lateral installation depth did not usually result in significant differences in final grain yield. This implied that for sparser plant populations, greater water and nutrient availability per plant may have been compensating factors for final yield. This paper reports data for a single soybean crop season, and this experiment will continue for additional seasons and different crops...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{fertilizer}} {{rates at}} sowing can provide {{significant increases in}} grain yield in vegetable crops. However, very high rates can impair root development because of increased soil salinization in the rows mainly because of KCl fertilizer. Broadcast fertilization without incorporation into soil may be a viable strategy to avoid this salinization. Therefore, we conducted a study {{to determine the effect}} of different fertilizer rates applied to the soil surface without incorporation on common bean grain yield and yield components in a no-tillage system. An irrigated field experiment with a randomized block experimental design with four replications was conducted in Brazil during the 2012 and 2013 growing seasons. The treatments consisted of four fertilizer rates of an N-P-K blend that were 0, 50, 100 (15 kg ha- 1 of N, 90 kg ha- 1 of P 2 O 5 and 45 kg ha- 1 of K 2 O) and 150 % of the recommended fertilizer rate for in-furrow applications. Increasing broadcast fertilizer application provided a significant increase in common bean grain yield. The application of 300 kg ha- 1 of fertilizer (100 % of the recommended fertilizer rate) on the soil surface without incorporation provided a similar result as the application of the same amount in the <b>seed</b> <b>row.</b> The results document that broadcast application of a fertilizer blend on the soil surface without incorporation is a viable management tool to increase common bean grain yield in no-tillage systems in soil with high fertility, which is based mainly on its content of organic matter, phosphorus, and base saturation. 201...|$|E
40|$|Key words: Hybrid corn, {{maturity}} and phenological stages. In {{order to determine}} the growing characteristics and detecting the morphological bases of yield difference, study of relations between different traits {{with each other and with}} grain yield, determining the most important effective traits on yield in hybrids of seed corn and comparison of native and foreign hybrids had been studied and classification of them had been done on the basis of morphological traits. For this purpose an experiment carried out in 2007 at Moghan agricultural research center. In this experiment, 28 hybrids of seed corn (18 foreigner hybrids and 10 native hybrids) were studied in two different experiments with using a complete randomized block designed in 4 replications. Hybrids of both groups had meaningful differences in some characteristics. In this test some of medium maturing foreigner hybrids had low yield in comparison with the early maturing native hybrids, this result showed the different reactions of these hybrids in studied test conditions (P< 0. 05). Public heritability, the yield, number of <b>seed</b> <b>rows,</b> number of <b>seeds</b> per <b>row,</b> 1000 - grain weight, plant height, ear height, number of tassel branches, number of leaves, location of appearance of ear, And length of leaf in hybrids of these two groups was high...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Soil surface roughness, as {{investigated}} in this study, is decomposed in a dual scale process. Therefore, we investigated photogrammetrically acquired roughness information over different agricultural {{fields in the}} size of 6 – 22 m 2 and decomposed them into a dual scale process by using geostatistical techniques. For the characterization of soil surface roughness, we calculated two different roughness indices (the RMS height s and the autocorrelation length l) differing significantly for each scale. While we could relate the small scale roughness pattern clearly to the <b>seedbed</b> <b>rows,</b> the larger second scale pattern could be related to the appearance of wheel tracks of the tillage machine used. As a result, major progress was made in the understanding of the different scales in soil surface roughness characterization and its quantification possibilities...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{nitrogen}} fertilizer application and different methods for weed control on yield and yield components of corn was evaluated in Khorramabad in 2011. The experiment was conducted as a split plot based on randomized complete block design in 3 replications. Nitrogen application was as main plot in 4 levels (no nitrogen, broadcasting nitrogen, banding nitrogen and sprayed nitrogen) {{and methods of}} weed control were in 4 levels (non-control weeds, application Equip herbicide, once hand control of weeds and application Equip herbicide+once time weeding) was as subplots. Result illustrated that effects of nitrogen fertilizer application were significant on grain and forage yield, 100 seeds weight, harvest index, grain number per row and cob weight per plant. Grain yield increased by 91. 4 and 3. 9 % in application banding and broadcasting for nitrogen fertilizer, respectively, compared to the no fertilizer treatment. The results show improved efficiency of nitrogen utilization by banding application. Grain yield, harvest index, <b>seed</b> <b>rows</b> per cob, <b>seeds</b> per <b>row</b> and cob weight were increased by weed control. In the application of Equip herbicide+ hand weeding treatment corn grain yield was increased 126 % in comparison to weedy control. It represents of the intense affects of weed competition with corn. The highest corn grain yield (6758 kg h - 1) {{was related to the}} application banding of nitrogen fertilizer and Equip herbicide+once hand weeding...|$|R
