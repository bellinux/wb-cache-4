40|$|Ceramic {{vibrating}} sample magnenometer (VSM) {{samples are}} {{usually in the}} form of a sintered monolith, a <b>sintered</b> <b>pressed</b> pellet, or a powder set in a resin or wax. The problem of mounting an aligned fibre sample, so that it retains alignment whilst remaining fixed in place as it is vibrated in a large magnetic field, was addressed for the first time. The most successful sample preparation method involved the formation of a flat, square composite sample through impregnation of the fibre with a fast-setting resin. Such aligned fibre samples had a fibre volume fraction of 3 - 4 %, but random fibre samples were also prepared, forming a much denser composite with typically 10 times as much fibre in the sample. The magnetic properties of a range of polycrystalline hexagonal ferrite fibres prepared by this method, and the effects of fibre alignment upon those properties, are currently being published in a series of articles.

Experiments were performed on two types of commercially available, nano-sized, ZrC> 2 - 3 mol% Y 2 O 3 (3 Y-TZP) powders. An unstabilised zirconia powder was also investigated for comparison purposes. Particle size analysis of these powder yield particle sizes ranging from 1. 29 |xm to 1. 78 pm, suggesting that the particles are heavily prone to agglomeration in water. BET specific surface area analysis showed the powders to be nano-sized as determined using equivalent spherical diameter theory. The density of the powders was measured using helium gas pycnometry. DTA/TGA analysis indicates that binder burnout occurs on heating in the range 300 - 440 °C. Shrinkage and densification rate characteristics of the powders during sintering was investigated using dilatometry. One of the powders demonstrated full shrinkage during isothermal sintering; the other did not. The point of maximum densification rate differed by approximately 100 °C for these powders. A dramatic expansion associated with the tetragonal to monoclinic transformation on cooling from 1400 °C is observed by dilatometry for unstabilised zirconia powder sample but not for stabilised powder samples. This indicates that the sintered samples retain in tetragonal phase on cooling to room temperature.
