The following research questions were investigated: (1) To what extent is the students’ reading comprehension ability after using <b>strategy</b> <b>to</b> infer the meaning from contextual cues? (2) To what extent is the students’ reading comprehension ability after using <b>strategy</b> <b>to</b> consult a dictionary of unfamiliar words in texts? (3) To what extent is the students’ reading comprehension ability after using <b>strategy</b> <b>to</b> continue reading without regarding to unfamiliar words? (4) Which one {{is the most effective}} <b>strategy</b> <b>to</b> improve the reading comprehension ability? This research was tried to answer these questions by experimental design. The research was comparing the effectiveness of the three strategies. The Results of the study revealed that the <b>strategy</b> <b>to</b> consult a dictionary is the best strategy.

The research used the Importance Performance Analysis (IPA) method {{to find out the}} level of the visitors’ interest and satisfaction. For the internal and external analyses, the Internal Factor Evaluation (IFE) method, the External Factor Evaluation (EFE) method,  Strength Weakness Opportunity and Threat (SWOT) and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) were used <b>to</b> determine the <b>strategies</b> for marketing Sukorambi Botanic Garden. Three resource persons were used by purposive sampling technique. Thirty respondents were used for analytical level of interest by distributing questionnaires to visitors. The results of the research showed that the priorities of marketing Sukorambi Botanic Garden were 1) the <b>strategy</b> <b>to</b> maximize the concept of recreation while studying  such as crop cultivation and animal farming, 2) the <b>strategy</b> <b>to</b> increase the number of outbound games, 3) the <b>strategy</b> <b>to</b> coordinate intensively with stakeholders for improvement and sustainable development, 4) the <b>strategy</b> <b>to</b> get a loan from  a financial institution to increase capital, 5) the <b>strategy</b> <b>to</b> optimize promotion activities, (6)   the <b>strategy</b> <b>to</b> improve the quality of community services through improved performance and transportation facilities, 7) the <b>strategy</b> <b>to</b> improve the quality of services through trainings for the employees to improve the company’s management system, 8) the <b>strategy</b> <b>to</b> realize facility development on the remainder of the land  accompanied by improvement of existing facilities, and 9) the <b>strategy</b> <b>to</b> optimize online promotion activities.      Keywords: Agrotourism, marketing development strategy, Sukorambi Botanic Garden, AHP, SWOT <br /...|$|R

Those species that seek pest insects are considered beneficial 'biological control agents' and their presence encouraged in biological pest control programmes.|$|E

Woodpeckers may aggressively harass potential competitors, and also use other <b>strategies</b> <b>to</b> reduce the chance of being usurped from their nesting site; for example the red-crowned woodpecker digs its nest in the underside of a small branch, which reduces the chance that a larger species will take it over and expand it.|$|E

Many are {{extremely}} well camouflaged to evade predators such as birds that hunt by sight. As well as being coloured like tree bark, they are disruptively patterned to break up their outlines; their partly transparent wings are held over the body and pressed close to the substrate. The wings are antireflective, avoiding the typical shine of insect cuticle, which would break the cicada's camouflage. Some cicada species play dead when threatened.|$|E

Numerous fossilized flipper bones (i.e., segments of the pectoral fins) and caudal vertebrae of large whales from the Pliocene have been found with megalodon bite marks, which suggests that megalodon would immobilize a large whale by ripping apart or biting off its fins before killing and feeding on it.|$|E
5|$|In {{computer}} science, {{simulations of}} evolution using evolutionary algorithms and artificial life {{started in the}} 1960s and were extended with simulation of artificial selection. Artificial evolution became a widely recognised optimisation method {{as a result of}} the work of Ingo Rechenberg in the 1960s. He used evolution <b>strategies</b> <b>to</b> solve complex engineering problems. Genetic algorithms in particular became popular through the writing of John Henry Holland. Practical applications also include automatic evolution of computer programmes. Evolutionary algorithms are now used to solve multi-dimensional problems more efficiently than software produced by human designers and also to optimise the design of systems.|$|E
