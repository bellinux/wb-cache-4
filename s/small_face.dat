2500|$|With the {{addition}} of Wood and Stewart, the [...] "small" [...] {{part of the original}} band name was dropped, partly because the two newcomers (at 5'9" [...] and 5'10" [...] respectively) were significantly taller than the three former <b>Small</b> <b>Faces.</b> Hoping to capitalise on the Small Faces' earlier success, record company executives wanted the band to keep their old name; however, the band objected, arguing the personnel changes resulted in a group very different from the <b>Small</b> <b>Faces.</b> As a compromise, in the US their debut album was credited to the <b>Small</b> <b>Faces,</b> while subsequent albums appeared under their new name.|$|R
