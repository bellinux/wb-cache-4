40|$|Iowa {{farmers have}} been growing too much corn. Iowa farm land simply will not stand as large a corn acreage as was devoted to it just prior to 1934. This {{conclusion}} is borne out by both the research* of the Agricultural Experiment Station and by estimates made by farmers in their County Land Use Planning reports. ** But if less corn is grown, what effect will this change in crops have upon the kinds and numbers of livestock produced? Ever since the AAA started its first program in the Corn Belt, {{one of the questions}} uppermost in the minds of both farmers and AAA planners has been: What will less corn and more grass do to hog, beef and dairy production? Within the Corn Belt farmers have been concerned chiefly about the influence of less corn upon hog supplies. Will a soil conservation program with its reduction of <b>soil</b> <b>depleting</b> <b>crops</b> hold hog numbers sufficiently in check to avoid a recurrence of large surpluses and low hog prices? Outside of the Corn Belt some apprehension has been expressed by dairy and cattle interests. They ask: “Will not the curtailment in concentrates and the rise in roughages promoted by the AAA programs shrink sow herds and add to the number of cows that are kept on Corn Belt farms?...|$|R

30|$|In {{agricultural}} systems, high-density monoculture <b>crops</b> <b>deplete</b> <b>soil</b> minerals {{quickly and}} therefore rely on external supplies {{for most of}} their nutrients, particularly nitrogen, potassium (K) and phosphorus (Amtmann et al., 2006). A balanced supply of mineral nutrients is crucial for both quantity and quality of the crop, but rarely achieved in the field. Of the mineral nutrients, imbalanced nutrition with K is well known and becoming an important constraint to crop production in many areas (Cakmak, 2010).|$|R

50|$|Carver {{developed}} {{techniques to}} improve <b>soils</b> <b>depleted</b> by repeated plantings of cotton. Together with other agricultural experts, he urged farmers to restore nitrogen to their soils by practicing systematic crop rotation: alternating cotton crops with plantings of sweet potatoes or legumes (such as peanuts, soybeans and cowpeas). These crops both restored nitrogen {{to the soil}} and were good for human consumption. Following the crop rotation practice resulted in improved cotton yields and gave farmers alternative cash crops. To train farmers to successfully rotate and cultivate the new crops, Carver developed an agricultural extension program for Alabama that {{was similar to the}} one at Iowa State. To encourage better nutrition in the South, he widely distributed recipes using the alternative crops.|$|R
50|$|Tithonia diversifolia is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the Asteraceae family that {{is commonly known as}} the tree marigold, Mexican tournesol, Mexican sunflower, Japanese sunflower or Nitobe chrysanthemum. It is native to Mexico and Central America but has a nearly pantropical distribution as an introduced species. Depending on the area they may be either annual or perennial. It has shown great potential in raising the soil fertility in <b>soils</b> <b>depleted</b> in nutrients. Originating in Mexico; research has shown its potential in benefiting poor African farmers. This plant is a weed that grows quickly and has become an option as an affordable alternative to expensive synthetic fertilizers. It has shown to increase plant yields and the soil nutrients of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K).|$|R

40|$|Mangroves can {{be defined}} as trees, shrubs, or palms, {{exceeding}} 0. 5 m in height that occur in the upper intertidal zone. They are not a single taxonomic group but rather a diverse range of plants with adaptations enabling survival in this otherwise inhospitable saline and anaerobic environment. Adaptations include viviparous propagules, for example, in many genera seeds remain attached and germinate on the tree and then are buoyant during a short aquatic dispersal phase. Many mangroves have developed mechanisms to tolerate salt, and the majority have root systems that enable the plants to respire despite being anchored in saturated, non-porous <b>soils</b> <b>depleted</b> of oxygen.

40|$|Economic {{returns from}} {{conservation}} farming {{are influenced by}} many factors. Some {{are associated with the}} direct application of recommended practices. Others are associated with changes that occur in farm organization as a result of adopting conservation rotations. The purpose of this discussion is to consider how costs and returns from conservation practices depend upon (1) different levels of con-servation, (2) soil type, (3) crop disposition, (4) price relationships, and (5) period of time considered. COMPARISON OF DIFFERENT LEVELS OF CONSERVATION Returns from soil conservation practices depend upon the comparative levels because many degrees of intensity exist in actual practice. Different levels are possible in many areas {{because of the number of}} practices recommended. For example, some farmers follow a good rotation, but fail to adopt the mechanical practices recommended for their farms. Other farmers apply an adequate amount of lime and fertilizer on the cropland, but continue to follow a <b>soil</b> <b>depleting</b> rotation.

40|$|The {{semi-arid}} tropics (SAT), {{spread over}} 11. 6 million km 2 worldwide, {{is home to}} millions of poor people. The soils are low in fertility and degraded to varying extent.

40|$|Piliostigma reticulatum and Guiera senegalensis are two native shrubs that {{coexist with}} row crops in parkland {{systems of the}} Sahel of Africa. Although {{permanently}} green all year around in <b>soil</b> <b>depleted</b> in nutrients and dry for a nine-month period, these shrubs have been largely overlooked.

50|$|In {{many areas}} sow thistles are {{considered}} noxious weeds, {{as they grow}} quickly {{in a wide range}} of conditions and their wind-borne seeds allow them to spread rapidly. Sonchus arvensis, the perennial sow thistle, is considered the most economically detrimental, as it can crowd commercial crops, is a heavy consumer of nitrogen in <b>soils,</b> may <b>deplete</b> <b>soil</b> water of land left to fallow, and can regrow and sprout additional plants from its creeping roots. However, sow thistles are easily uprooted by hand, and their soft stems present little resistance to slashing or mowing. Most livestock will readily devour sow thistle in preference to grass, and this lettuce-relative is edible and nutritious to humans — in fact this is the meaning of the second part of the Latin name of the common sow thistle, oleraceus. Attempts at weed control by herbicidal use, to the neglect of other methods, may have led to a proliferation of this species in some environments.|$|R
