50|$|Harper {{proved to}} be a capable <b>stud</b> <b>farmer</b> and horse breeder to the extent that one of his horses, Banker won the 1863 Melbourne Cup and the Victorian Cup two days later. Banker was a younger brother of the horse Barwon that also ran in the 1863 Melbourne Cup but had {{finished}} fourth. Barwon had won the 1862 Victoria Derby, the 1863 VRC St Leger and the Australian Cup in 1861.|$|E
5000|$|Graham Beck was a South African {{business}} magnate, wine maker, <b>stud</b> <b>farmer</b> and philanthropist. [...] He is {{best known}} as the one of the richest men in South Africa and founder of Kangra Group as well as the non-profit Graham Beck Foundation. He also owned the stud farm Gainesway Farm in the United States and the wine farm Steenberg in Cape Town in addition to other wine farms in Robertson and Franschhoek. Although the true extent of his wealth was unknown to the public it is known that he netted R1.08 billion in 2006 from the purchase of his 60% stake in Kangra Group's coal operation to the Spanish company Fenosa.|$|E
500|$|The Haras National de Saint-Lô (National Stud of Saint-Lo) {{was founded}} in 1806 by Napoleon. This stud and the Haras du Pin (Stud of Pin) became the main {{production}} centers for the Carrossier Normand. The Norman horse-Thoroughbred crossbreds produced at these studs {{were divided into two}} groups. The first were lighter cavalry horses, and the second were heavier horses, called [...] "cobs", used for draft work in the region. At this time, there was no breed registry or studbook; instead, selective breeding was practiced by the two <b>studs,</b> and <b>farmers</b> tested the capabilities of young horses to select breeding stock.|$|R
500|$|Whitemore, {{along with}} Hagley, has {{historically}} {{had one of}} the highest concentrations of stud farms breeding pedigree livestock, in Australia. In the 1950s there were more than 100 registered studs within [...] of the town's centre. The Poll Dorset, an important breed in prime lamb production in Australia, was first bred at a Whitemore <b>stud.</b> Whitemore <b>farmers,</b> the French family, began breeding Ryeland lambs in early 21st century. The family had originally farmed this breed in the 1930s, but it had now become uncommon in Australia due to changing fashions in meat. The Heazlewood family breeds the Border Leicester, another sheep breed that is now uncommon in Australia. The family was honoured by the Royal Agricultural Society of Tasmania in 2013 for their involvement in the Tasmanian sheep industry over the previous one hundred years.|$|R
500|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Henry Blanc was {{appointed}} {{as the new}} director of the French National Stud, and began the conversion of French draft breeds into animals bred for slaughter into horse meat. The <b>stud</b> encouraged <b>farmers</b> who could no longer find buyers for their animals to fatten them for resale to the slaughter markets. Breeding {{for the production of}} meat helped to safeguard the Auxois breed by keeping its gene pool intact, but also transformed the previously powerful breed into one bred solely for weight— the main consideration in pricing at slaughter. In 1976, an official French decree changed the name of the category in which the Auxois fit from [...] "draft horses" [...] to [...] "heavy horses" [...] and encouraged farmers to select the heaviest breeding stallions possible, to increase the average weight of the breed. The National Stud approved this change, and between the 1950s and the 1980s, the average weight of the Auxois increased from [...] to [...] or more.|$|R
5000|$|In October 1971 at Haydock Park, {{where he}} was {{sponsoring}} the Vernons Sprint Cup, Sangster was introduced to John Magnier, a <b>stud</b> <b>farmer</b> from County Cork who was then aged 23. Sangster entered into partnership with Magnier and the legendary Irish trainer Vincent O'Brien, investing in the Coolmore Stud in County Tipperary. The trio became known as [...] "the Brethren". Their idea was to use Sangster's money to buy up the best yearlings at the Keeneland Sales in Kentucky, cornering the line of horses bred from the stallion Northern Dancer. Trained by O'Brien at his Ballydoyle stables these horses {{would go on to}} success on the track and command enormous fees standing at stud.|$|E
40|$|Theileriosis is a tick-transmitted protozoal disease {{caused by}} several Theileria species. The most virulent species {{affecting}} cattle are T. parva and T. annulata. Theileria parva {{is responsible for}} causing East Coast Fever (ECF), Corridor Disease and January Disease. Theileria parva is endemic in certain areas of South Africa, Zambia, Zimbabwe and elsewhere. In South Africa these areas are controlled, include mostly game reserves containing infected African buffaloes and are in declared Corridor disease infected districts. African buffaloes are natural reservoirs of the T. parva parasite and if suitable tick species (Rhipicephalus appendiculatus and R. zambeziensis) are present, cattle may become infected. Currently, T. parva is diagnosed by conducting an array of tests including Giemsa-stained blood and lymph node smears, indirect immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) test, standard PCR and PCR/DNA-probe test. Recent progress in the diagnosis of T. parva has involved {{the development of a}} Reverse-Line Blot (RLB) technique and a real-time PCR for detecting T. parva. Over the last decade, several outbreaks of T. parva have occurred in cattle in the province of KwaZulu- Natal. Between 2002 and 2004, Mr A. Green, a Red Brangus <b>stud</b> <b>farmer</b> in the Ladysmith district, lost a total of 42 cattle to T. parva infection. An investigation into the epidemiology of T. parva in KwaZulu-Natal was structured in three parts: (i) a survey of Red Brangus on Mr Green‟s farm in order to gain insight into the current prevalence of theileriosis and other tick-borne diseases in the herd; (ii) transmission experiments from T. parva-infected cattle on Mr Green‟s farm to susceptible cattle to demonstrate vector transmission as well as replicate the disease process and pathology; (iii) tick transmission experiments from persistently T. parva positive-testing buffalo and persistently T. parva negative-testing buffalo, to susceptible bovines to demonstrate suitability of tick transmission methods and compare pathology and clinical signs seen on the farm and in the tick transmission experiments. The survey demonstrated that several factors may interact in determining the number of infected animals, the period that they remain infective to ticks as well as the susceptibility {{of the rest of the}} herd to T. parva. Sampled bovines did not show clinical signs of T. parva-associated disease and with test results indicated that the number of subclinical carriers may be high. Attempts to transmit T. parva from infected cattle on Mr Green‟s farm to susceptible cattle were not successful. Transmission from an infected buffalo to a susceptible bovine was successful and transmission of T. parva from a negative-testing buffalo to a susceptible bovine could not be demonstrated. These experiments give some confidence that the tick-transmission methods and diagnostic tests used were reliable. It remains important to consider African buffalo as a possible source of T. parva infection in a cattle herd even when a direct link cannot be established.

40|$|In South Africa, the {{increasing}} incidence of stock theft and poaching, with the accompanying cruelty to animals, affects {{all sectors of}} the livestock farming, including the large commercial <b>farmers,</b> <b>stud</b> breeders and the smallholder rural farmers who may own one or two cattle. Animal forensics, which includes DNA and protein technologies, can provide {{a useful tool for}} identifying stolen animals. Protein and DNA based methods can be used to establish the identity, ownership, parentage and traceablitiy or origin of the species of individual animals, using samples of blood meat, hair and other tissues collected from crime scenes. DNA microsatellite marker sets are used to obtain DNA profiles. The PCR procedure provides for the analysis of minute quantities of DNA. The analysis of protein profiles provides a simple but powerful means for animal and species identification. The paper discusses cases where animal forensic techniques have led to successful convictions...|$|R
5000|$|The {{breeding}} of Auvergne horses for light cavalry was {{managed by the}} National <b>Stud</b> and associated <b>farmers.</b> As {{the size of the}} Auvergne horse was too small for light cavalry it was crossed with the Thoroughbred and Anglo-Norman resulting in the [...] "half-blood Auvergne" [...] a horse of [...] "light size" [...] destined for war and widely used during the wars of empire. It had little in common with the old type of breed. Farmers were reluctant to cross with Thoroughbreds, preferring the Arabian. Although Eugene Gayot defended the usefulness of these crosses, they often had poor results from creating horses with slender limbs, long kidneys, flat ribs, and a lot less hardy than the original Auvergne horse According to Andre Sanson they had strong ancestral qualities of the Auvergne horse. In addition rearing conditions were so bad that a third of the population was infected by periodic ophthalmia.|$|R
