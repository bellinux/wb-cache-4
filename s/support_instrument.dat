40|$|This {{report is}} the Austrian {{contribution}} to the European TSER research project "SMEPOL" ("SME policy and the regional dimension of innovation"). The objective of this project is to analyze innovation policies aiming at SMEs, to evaluate their effectiveness and to propose potential improvements. For this purpose, important innovation <b>support</b> <b>instruments</b> for SMEs in several European regions - Upper Austria, the Triangle region in southern Jutland (Denmark), Lombardy and Apulia in Italy, Limburg in the Netherlands, Wallonia, northern and south-eastern Norway, Valencia in Spain, parts of London and its outer metropolitan area - have been investigated. This report focusses on the region of Upper Austria. It has four major parts: First, an introductory text describing the conceptual model of the research, its design and methodology, and presenting the investigated Austrian region. Second, {{a description of the}} national and regional innovation support system in general and an analysis of those <b>support</b> <b>instruments</b> which are most important for innovation activities of SMEs in particular. Third, an investigation of the innovativeness of SMEs in Upper Austria, the innovation barriers, and the effects of the selected <b>support</b> <b>instruments</b> on the firms' innovation activities. Fourth, conclusions regarding {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the innovation <b>support</b> <b>instruments</b> and proposals for improvements. (author's abstract, ed. M.

50|$|The final t can be {{replaced}} with an open tone using the middle finger a little further away from the rim.The effect of the <b>supporting</b> <b>instruments</b> together, is to build tension from an anticipation just before 1 (the third open note played by the atabaque) to 2, and resolution on 3, which then pushes the cell forward with the anticipation at the pick up to 1. As the berimbaus play with and against this framework along with the song verses, a surprising amount of syncopation results, despite the simple nature of the patterns.There is very little room allowed for improvisation in these <b>supporting</b> <b>instruments.</b> To allow otherwise would tend to distract too much from {{the content of the}} songs and the action inside the roda, as well as compete for attention with the berimbaus. There is still room, however, for occasional variations on the basic rhythms by the <b>supporting</b> <b>instruments,</b> especially when the overall energy of the roda is fairly high.|$|R

50|$|Current GDP {{per capita}} of Tanzania grew more than 40 percent between 1998 and 2007.

The PRGF was the successor program to the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility, which Tanzania also participated in from 1996-1999. The IMF's PSI program provides policy support and signaling to participating low-income countries and is intended for countries that have usually achieved a reasonable growth performance, low underlying inflation, an adequate level of official international reserves, and have begun to establish external and net domestic debt sustainability.|$|E

Furthermore, based on this, it draws a number of policy implications to design future research and innovation <b>support</b> <b>instruments</b> targeting innovative company growth in Europe. The result of this work indicates that: a) EU needs support policies to foster R&D investment in some specific typology of innovative companies and only where there are market failures and clear high social returns; b) the establishment of any targeted <b>support</b> <b>instruments</b> should take into account an integrated set of criteria including: firms' age and size, the sectors where firms operate, the involved risks in and potential for their innovative and commercial activities, the country/techno-economic environment, and the degree of internationalisation; c) to be successful, no matter the new targeted policies and <b>supporting</b> <b>instruments,</b> they should be designed using policy experimentation and its results should be regularly measured and evaluated using appropriate indicators and analyses.

5000|$|The {{third round}} of reform focused mainly on {{creating}} fit policies to accommodate the economic reforms brought forth by the previous two reforms. From 2006 and on, the IMF’s interference switched to providing the country with policy advices. Under {{the operation of the}} Policy <b>Support</b> <b>Instrument</b> (PSI), the IMF continues to provide the country with economic advices fostering better economic growth rate and improving the situation of poverty. As we can see from the IMF record, starting since 2003, the amount of loan to Tanzania approved by the IMF was only US$29.1 million, and in 2007, only the PSI was in operation and no loan was included. This greatly signals that the IMF has assumed a more passive role as a policy advisor in the case of Tanzania. From the 2017 policy report of Tanzania, the IMF stated that the economy of Tanzania, with the implementation of the PSI-supported program, is looking strong with a moderate level of inflation.' ...|$|E

Debtor {{countries are}} expected to provide a precise description of their economic and financial situation, 2) have implemented and are committed to implementing reforms to restore their economic and financial situation, and 3) have a demonstrated track record of implementing reforms under an IMF program. This means in practice that the country must have a current program supported by an appropriate arrangement with the IMF (Stand-By, Extended Fund Facility, Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility, Policy <b>Support</b> <b>Instrument).</b> The level of the debt treatment {{is based on the}} financing gap identified in the IMF program. In the case of a flow treatment, the consolidation period coincides with the period when the IMF arrangement shows a need for debt relief. When the flow treatment extends {{over a long period of}} time (generally more than one year), the Paris Club agreement is divided into phases. The amounts falling due during the first phase are treated as soon as the agreement enters into force. Subsequent phases are implemented following completion of conditions mentioned in the Agreed Minutes, including non-accumulation of arrears and approval of the reviews of the IMF program.|$|E

Changes that are introduced in the software at the peril of individual developers may affect aspects of the software such as stability, usability, and overall quality.

In order to support this type of analysis, we have created a checklist-based process <b>support</b> <b>instrument,</b> the purpose {{of which is to}} allow for objective and systematic analyses. We present an approach for adapting generic checklists along three axes: process, domain, and roles, as well as character-istics of the resulting <b>support</b> <b>instrument.</b> We also describe two evaluations of the change control process, of which the latter is designed with the stepwise character of the process in mind. We discuss some preliminary evaluation results, and in the light of these conclude that the use of checklist-based process support seems promising so far. 1...|$|E
