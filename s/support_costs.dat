25|$|The Lockheed P-3 Orion, a {{turboprop}} ASW aircraft, {{has been}} in service with the United States Navy since 1962. In the 1980s, the Navy began studies for a P-3 replacement, the range and endurance of which were reduced due to increasing weight and airframe fatigue life limitations. The specification required a new aircraft to have reduced operating and <b>support</b> <b>costs.</b> In 1989, the Navy awarded Lockheed a fixed-price contract to develop the P-7, but this was canceled the following year. A second competition for a replacement began in 2000. Lockheed Martin submitted the Orion 21, an updated new-build version of the P-3. Boeing's proposal was based on its 737-800 airliner. BAE Systems offered a new-build version of the Nimrod MRA4, a British jet-powered maritime patrol aircraft. BAE withdrew from the competition in October 2002, recognizing that without a production partner based in the United States, the bid was politically unrealistic. On 14 May 2004, Boeing {{was selected as the}} winner.|$|E
500|$|The Ramah Navajo Chapter was {{represented}} by Carter G. Phillips, who argued {{that this was a}} simple contract case to which the Ferris doctrine applied. [...] The Chapter contracted with the United States to perform a service and completed its obligations, and the United States breached the contract by refusing to pay according to the terms of the contract. [...] The statute, in addition to establishing that contract <b>support</b> <b>costs</b> were to be paid, also mandated the use of a model contract, reducing the BIA's ability to modify the terms of the contract. [...] To allow the government to breach would be bad public policy, where no contractor to the government could be assured of receiving payment. [...] Phillips noted that the statute was clear, and if it was not, the canons of statutory construction required that the ambiguity be resolved in the tribes favor.|$|E

To compare with the traditional approach, the method has demonstrated that by creating a centralised environment such as the databases and using a data-driven approach, the system is made more efficient by reducing the number of processes in carrying out cost estimation and thus this provides more information to make an informed concept design decision during the product development process based on the systems competence of instant cost estimation feedback...|$|R
500|$|The {{circuit court}} {{noted that this}} was an issue on how the statute was to be interpreted. [...] First, the court noted that the statute {{required}} the Secretary of the Interior to add the full amount of indirect, contract <b>support</b> <b>costs</b> to the contract. Beginning in 1994, Congress began to cap the total amount of funds {{that could be used for}} IDEAA contracts. [...] This amount was insufficient to cover the contracts with all Indian tribes, but was sufficient to cover each individual contract that was entered into by BIA. [...] The court noted that when construing a statute dealing with Indian tribes, the statute is to be construed to the favor of the tribe over the more general canon requiring deference to agency determinations. [...] The court then held that since there were sufficient funds to pay each individual contract in full, the government was obligated to do so. [...] The circuit court reversed and remanded the decision of the district court, ruling in favor of the Chapter.|$|E
500|$|Parallel to his {{initiatives}} in Air Force education and training, Hewitt introduced a revised aircrew ranking scheme {{that consisted of}} skill categories with various levels, such as navigator level4 or pilot level1, rather than the regular military ranks such as sergeant or flight lieutenant. This was abandoned in 1950 due to dissatisfaction caused {{by the lack of}} obvious equivalence between these specialist 'ranks' and the traditional ranking system common {{to the rest of the}} RAAF and other defence forces. After completing his term as Air Member for Personnel in 1948, he was posted to London as the Australian Defence Representative. By now promoted air vice marshal, Hewitt was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1951 New Year Honours. Returning from Britain the same year, he took over as Air Member for Supply and Equipment (AMSE) from Air Vice Marshal George Mackinolty, who had died suddenly of [...] cancer. Hewitt served as AMSE until his retirement from the RAAF in April 1956. In this role, he again cooperated with Air Vice Marshal Wackett—now the Air Member for Technical Services—to introduce the concept of acquiring spare parts based on 'life-of-type', whereby the forecast number and type of spares necessary for an aircraft's projected service life would be ordered when it was first deployed operationally, to reduce <b>support</b> <b>costs</b> and delivery times.|$|E

2500|$|Historically, device {{manufacturers}} and mobile carriers have typically been unsupportive of third-party firmware development. Manufacturers express concern about improper functioning of devices running unofficial software and the <b>support</b> <b>costs</b> resulting from this. Moreover, modified firmware such as CyanogenMod sometimes offer features, such as tethering, for which carriers would otherwise charge a premium. As a result, technical obstacles including locked bootloaders and restricted access to root permissions {{are common in}} many devices. However, as community-developed software has grown more popular, and following a statement by the Librarian of Congress in the United States that permits the [...] "jailbreaking" [...] of mobile devices, {{manufacturers and}} carriers have softened their position regarding third party development, with some, including HTC, Motorola, Samsung and Sony, providing support and encouraging development. As a result of this, over time the need to circumvent hardware restrictions to install unofficial firmware has lessened as {{an increasing number of}} devices are shipped with unlocked or unlockable bootloaders, similar to Nexus series of phones, although usually requiring that users waive their devices' warranties to do so. However, despite manufacturer acceptance, some carriers in the US still require that phones are locked down, frustrating developers and customers.|$|E
