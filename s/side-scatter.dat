However, identification of Hz-containing leukocytes or parasitized erythrocytes is usually based on microscopy, with inherent limitations. Flow cytometric detection of depolarized <b>Side-Scatter</b> is more accurate and its adaptation to common bench top flow cytometers might allow several applications. These can range from the ex-vivo and in-vitro detection and functional analysis of Hz-containing leukocytes to the detection of parasitized Red-Blood-Cells (pRBCs) to assess antimalarial activity. Methods A standard benchtop flow cytometer was adapted to detect depolarized <b>Side-Scatter.</b> Synthetic and Plasmodium falciparum Hz were incubated with whole blood and PBMCs to detect Hz-containing leukocytes and CD 16 expression on monocytes. C 5 BL/ 6 mice were infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA or P. berghei NK 65 and Hz-containing leukocytes were analysed using CD 11 b and Gr 1 expression. Parasitized RBC from infected mice were identified using anti-Ter 119 and SYBR green I and were analysed for depolarized Side Scatter. A highly depolarizing RBC population was monitored in an in-vitro culture incubated with chloroquine or quinine. Results A flow cytometer can be easily adapted to detect depolarized <b>Side-Scatter</b> and thus, intracellular Hz. The detection and counting of Hz containing leukocytes in fresh human or mouse blood, as well as in leukocytes from in-vitro experiments was rapid and easy. Analysis of CD 14 /CD 16 and CD 11 b/Gr 1 monocyte expression in human or mouse blood, in a mixed populations of Hz-containing and non-containing monocytes, appears to show distinct patterns in both types of cells.

But so far, it has been difficult to detect PM 2. 5 mass concentration profile. The proposed methodology to study the relationship between aerosol extinction coefficient and PM 2. 5 mass concentration is described, which indicates that the PM 2. 5 mass concentration profile could be retrieved by combining a charge-coupled device (CCD) <b>side-scatter</b> lidar with a PM 2. 5 sampling detector. When the relative humidity is less than 70  %, PM 2. 5, mass concentration is proportional to the aerosol extinction coefficient, and then the specific coefficient can be calculated.

Up to seven different subpopu-lations were distinguished by FCM based on nucleic acid content and light side scattering of the cells. The cell size analysis of symbionts showed that the symbiotic population was very heterogeneous in size, i. e., ranging from 0. 5 to 5 m in length, with variable amounts of intracellular sulfur. The <b>side-scatter</b> signal analyzed by FCM, which is often taken as a proxy of cell size, was greatly influenced by the sulfur content of the symbionts.

It is shown that multiple Bragg scattering leads to a transition into diffusive regime of the wave propagation obstructing the plasma density profile measurement, if the turbulence level exceeds a threshold value. The criteria determining the threshold plasma density fluctuation level are derived both in the one-dimensional model and accounting for the two-dimensional <b>side-scattering</b> effects. The corresponding thresholds are evaluated for different modifications of reflectometry diagnostics planed for ITER...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} several techniques {{developed by}} the High Resolution Fly's Eye experiment for measuring aerosol vertical optical depth, aerosol horizontal attenuation length, and aerosol phase function. The techniques are based on measurements of <b>side-scattered</b> light generated by a steerable ultraviolet laser and collected by an optical detector designed to measure fluorescence light from cosmic-ray air showers. We also present a technique to cross-check the aerosol optical depth measurement using air showers observed in stereo. These methods {{can be used by}} future air fluorescence experiments.
