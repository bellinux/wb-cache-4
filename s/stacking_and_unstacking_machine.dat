40|$|In {{cyanobacteria}} and chloroplasts, thylakoids are {{the complex}} internal membrane system {{where the light}} reactions of oxygenic photosynthesis occur. In plant chloroplasts, thylakoids are differentiated into a highly interconnected system of <b>stacked</b> grana <b>and</b> <b>unstacked</b> stroma membranes. In contrast, in cyanobacteria, the evolutionary progenitors of chloroplasts, thylakoids do not routinely form <b>stacked</b> <b>and</b> <b>unstacked</b> regions, <b>and</b> {{the architecture of the}} thylakoid membrane systems is only now being described in detail in these organisms. We used electron tomography to examine the thylakoid membrane systems in one cyanobacterium, Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142. Our data showed that thylakoids form a complicated branched network with a rudimentary quasi-helical architecture in this organism. A well accepted helical model of grana-stroma architecture of plant thylakoids describes an organization in which stroma thylakoids wind around stacked granum in right-handed spirals. Here we present data showing that the simplified helical architecture in Cyanothece 51142 is lefthanded in nature. We propose a model comparing the thylakoid membranes in plants and this cyanobacterium in which the system in Cyanothece 51142 is composed of non-stacked membranes linked by fret-like connections to other membrane components of the system in a limited left-handed arrangement...|$|R

Based on action spectroscopic studies in vacuo, the dimer complexes were found to absorb 50 – 70 meV to the red of the monomers under the same conditions. First-principles calculations predict shifts that somewhat depend on the relative orientation of the two Chl units, namely 50 and 30 meV for structures where the Chl rings are <b>stacked</b> <b>and</b> <b>unstacked,</b> respectively.

Using isolated spinach thylakoids, we investigated the relationship between light-induced <b>unstacking</b> of thylakoids <b>and</b> damage to the D 1 protein.

The sunlight also causes quantitative phosphorylation of major photosystem II proteins. Analysis of the Arabidopsis thaliana stn 7 xstn 8 double mutant deficient in thylakoid protein kinases STN 7 and STN 8 revealed light-independent phosphorylation of PsbH protein and greatly reduced N-terminal phosphorylation of D 2 protein. The stn 7 xstn 8 and stn 8 mutants deficient in light-induced phosphorylation of photosystem II had increased thylakoid membrane folding compared with wild-type and stn 7 plants.

40|$|In this work, the {{transfer}} of excitation energy was studied in native <b>and</b> cation-depletion induced, <b>unstacked</b> thylakoid membranes of spinach by steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. Fluorescence emission spectra at 5 K show an increase in photosystem I (PSI) emission upon unstacking, which suggests an increase of its antenna size. Fluorescence excitation measurements at 77 K indicate that the increase of PSI emission upon unstacking is caused both by a direct spillover from the photosystem II (PSII) core antenna and by a functional association of light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) to PSI, which is most likely caused by the formation of LHCII-LHCI-PSI supercomplexes. Time-resolved fluorescence measurements, both at room temperature and at 77 K, reveal differences in the fluorescence decay kinetics of <b>stacked</b> <b>and</b> <b>unstacked</b> membranes. Energy transfer between LHCII and PSI is observed to take place within 25 ps at room temperature and within 38 ps at 77 K, consistent {{with the formation of}} LHCII-LHCI-PSI supercomplexes.

Petty had wanted to create a contemporary adventure game, maintaining the characters and stories while reinventing the normal point-and-click interface used for such games. After observing his daughter playing with matryoshka dolls, he realized that the dolls themselves could be the characters, the inventory, and the action verbs at the same time. Petty and Schafer later reflected that the use of dolls, a common toy, would help to make the game appealing to the casual player, as they would quickly understand the mechanics of <b>stacking</b> <b>and</b> <b>unstacking,</b> while still having an allure for hardcore players with deeper gameplay mechanics. The idea of using these dolls would later be of benefit in production, as the basic structure of the doll model in the game's engine could easily be reused for the more than one hundred unique dolls within the game. Schafer assisted in helping Petty to write the game's story and to design some of the puzzles. Schafer estimated the total budget for the game at $2 million.|$|R

NMR spectroscopic studies of folding in these copolymers, induced by NH 4 SCN that coordinates with the OE- 6 segments and facilitates the charge-transfer (C-T) induced D-A stacking, clearly reveals the presence of PDI units that are isolated {{and those that are}} located at the ends of (D-A),, stacks. Similar conclusions regarding the presence of <b>stacked</b> <b>and</b> <b>unstacked</b> regions along the polymer chain were also inferred from UV-vis spectroscopic studies that probe the evolution of charge-transfer band.

The N-peptide/boxB complex has been extensively studied, and serves as a paradigm for understanding mechanisms of protein/RNA recognition. Particularly, ultrafast spectroscopy techniques have been applied to monitor picosecond fluorescence decay behaviors of 2 -aminopurines embedded at various positions of the boxB RNA. The studies have led to a model in which the bound N-peptide exists in dynamic equilibrium between two states, with peptide C-terminal fragment either stacking on (i. e., the stacked state) or peeling away from (i. e., the unstacked state) the RNA loop. The function of the N-peptide/boxB complex seems to correlate with the fraction of the stacked state. Here, the N-peptide/boxB system is studied using the site-directed spin labeling technique, in which X-band electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy is applied to monitor nanosecond rotational behaviors of stable nitroxide radicals covalently attached to different positions of the N-peptide. The data reveal that in the nanosecond regime the C-terminal fragment of bound N-peptide adopts multiple discrete conformations within the complex. The characteristics of these conformations are consistent with the proposed <b>stacked</b> <b>and</b> <b>unstacked</b> states, <b>and</b> their distributions vary upon mutations within the N-peptide.

On the exoplasmic (E) fracture face, the particle density is greater in stacked regions (≈ 3100 particles/μm 2) than in unstacked regions (≈ 925 particles/μm 2). On the complementary protoplasmic (P) fracture face, the particle density is lower in stacked regions (≈ 2265 particles/μm 2 than in unstacked regions (≈ 4980 particles/μm 2). The histogram of the diameters of E face particles in unstacked regions shows a single broad peak centered at 80 Å. In stacked regions, four distinct peaks, at 75, 105, 130, and 160 Å, are observed. These size classes are virtually identical to those found on E faces of thylakoids of the green alga Chlamydomonas and of greening pea chloroplasts. In the latter systems, the different size classes of E face particles are believed to represent photosystem II units surrounded by variable amounts of chlorophyll a/b light-harvesting complex. We propose that the same interpretation applies to the thylakoids of Prochloron, which contain a similar chlorophyll a/b complex. Our results add to the evidence supporting {{the view of the}} chlorophyll a/b complex as both a light-harvesting complex and a membrane adhesion factor.

The effect of Mn-deficiency was the specific loss of three-quarters of the particles from the endoplasmic fracture face of appressed thylakoids (EFs). Mn-deficient leaves were restored to near normal 2 days after application of exogenous Mn to the nutrient solution. It is concluded that the loss of most, but not all, functional photosystem II reaction centers from grana, with no alteration in light-harvesting complex or photosystem I, is responsible for the fluorescence and functional properties observed. The response of thylakoids to Mn deficiency shows that there is a fundamental difference in composition <b>and</b> function of <b>stacked</b> <b>and</b> <b>unstacked</b> endoplasmic fracture particles. The stacked endoplasmic fracture particle probably contains, in close association, the photosystem II reaction center and also the Mn-containing polypeptide, the 3 -(3, 4 -dichlorophenyl) - 1, 1 -dimethylurea-binding protein, and all electron transport components in between...|$|R
40|$|Photosystem II (PSII) and its {{associated}} light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) are highly concentrated in the stacked grana regions of photosynthetic thylakoid membranes from plants and green algae. PSII-LHCII supercomplexes can be arranged in disordered packings, ordered arrays, or mixtures thereof. The physical driving forces underlying array formation are unknown, and statistically robust methods of identifying arrays in micrographs are lacking, complicating attempts to determine a possible functional role for arrays in regulating light harvesting or energy conversion efficiency. This dissertation introduces new computational tools for studying the nano- and mesoscale organization of the membrane proteins that comprise the photosynthetic apparatus, and applies them to illuminate {{the origins of the}} diversity of local structural motifs in this adaptive biomaterial. First, we introduce a coarse-grained model of protein interactions in coupled photosynthetic membranes, focusing on a small number of particle types that feature simple shapes and potential energies motivated by structural studies. Reporting on computer simulations of the model's equilibrium fluctuations, we demonstrate its success in reproducing diverse structural features observed in experiments, including extended PSII-LHCII arrays. Free energy calculations reveal that the appearance of arrays marks a phase transition from the disordered fluid state to a system-spanning crystal. The predicted region of fluid-crystal coexistence is broad, encompassing much of the physiologically relevant parameter regime. Our results suggest that grana membranes lie at or near phase coexistence, conferring significant structural and functional flexibility to this densely packed membrane protein system. Upon extending this model to include simple representations of the membrane morphology and protein components found in thylakoid margins and stroma lamellae, we find that LHCII <b>stacking</b> <b>and</b> crowding in the grana are also primary determinants of the segregation of protein components between <b>stacked</b> <b>and</b> <b>unstacked</b> regions of the thylakoid membrane. In addition, we develop a statistical pipeline for identifying PSII crystals in nanometer-resolution micrographs of thylakoid membranes that would assist in future experimental tests of the predictions put forth in this dissertation; we validate our method on atomic force microscopy measurements of grana membranes isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana wild-type and soq 1 mutant plants. As a whole, this work creates a foundation for future rigorous biophysical investigations of the structure, function, and dynamics of the photosynthetic apparatus...|$|R
40|$|Polythiophenes {{have great}} {{potential}} as semiconductors {{for use in}} organic field effect transistors and light emitting diodes. Recent research {{has been focused on}} the design, synthesis and characterization of fluorinated polythiophenes and oligothiophenes. Various fluoroalkyl side chains have been introduced to induce polymer self-assembly, to control the electronic properties of the conjugated backbone, and to modify the solubility of the polymer in supercritical CO 2. This work led to the preparation of poly(3 -(perfluorooctyl) thiophene), which is one of only a few examples of n-dopable polythiophenes, and is the first supercritical CO 2 -soluble conducting polymer. An alternating copolymer consisting of 3 -perfluoroakyl and 3 -alkylthiophene units has been synthesized. This polymer, with alternating electron-donating and withdrawing substituents, has a high quantum yield for fluorescence in solution relative to the two homopolymers, and strong fluorescence in solid state. Based on the study on its nanocrystals, the unusual photophyiscs {{may be due to the}} formation of the supramolecular structure with hexagonal packing. A novel thiophene monomer, 3 -(1, 1 -difluorooctyl) thiophene, was prepared to further tune the electronic structure of polythiophenes by changing the fluorination pattern of side chains, while retaining solubility in organic solvents by virtue of the hydrocarbon side chain. a-Hexyl-w-perfluorohexylsexithiophene was synthesized to make a novel amphiphilic material for use in TFTs. Models for interchain charge transfer in doped conducting polymers were also developed. <b>Stacked</b> <b>and</b> <b>unstacked</b> conjugated oligomers have been synthesized as models for conducting polymers. The bis(radical cation) form and the dication-neutral form of compounds in which conjugated oligomers are held in a stacked arrangement are shown to coexist and in equilibrium with each other. The coexistence of these two forms further suggests that both may serve as charge carriers. Interconversion between these forms by disproportionation mimics a possible mechanism for charge migration in doped conjugated polymers. Ph. D. Committee Chair: David M.

40|$|Cytochrome f/b 6 and ATP {{synthetase}} (CF 0 -CF 1) complexes from spinach chloroplasts {{have been}} reconstituted into liposomes prepared from soybean phospholipids and purified spinach galactolipids. Freeze- fracture analysis revealed homogeneous populations of particles spanning the lipid bilayers with their elongated axes {{perpendicular to the}} membrane plane. The lipid composition of the liposomes {{had no effect on}} the size of the reconstituted complexes, the average diameter of cytochrome f/b 6 complex measuring 8. 5 nm, and of the CF 0 base piece of the ATP synthetase, 9. 5 nm. When reconstituted cytochrome f/b 6 complexes were cross-linked by means of antibodies prepared against the whole complex, the thus aggregated particles formed either hexagonal or square arrays. In both instances the center-to-center spacing of the particles was 8. 3 nm, thereby suggesting that this value could be closer to the real diameter of the complexes than the one obtained from measuring individual particles. Assuming an ellipsoidal shape for these particles, and using a measured height of 11 nm, a molecular weight of approximately 280, 000 could be calculated for the reconstituted cytochrome f/b 6 complex, consistent with a dimeric configuration. In many instances the crystalline sheets of antibody-aggregated cytochrome f/b 6 complexes were found to be free in the buffer solution; apparently the antibody-induced strains caused the sheet-like aggregates to pop out of the liposomal membranes. Agglutination studies of inside-out and right-side-out thylakoid vesicles revealed the antigenic determinants of the cytochrome f and cytochrome b 6 polypeptides to be exposed on the inner thylakoid surface and to be present in <b>stacked</b> <b>and</b> <b>unstacked</b> membrane regions. The molecular weight calculated from the size of freeze-fractured CF 0 base pieces was over twice the value determined by x-ray scattering data. This discrepancy may be caused by significant lipid domains within the base piece, or by an unusual fracturing behavior of the base piece in reconstituted liposomes...|$|R
