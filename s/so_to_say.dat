As pathogenic {{pressure on the}} previously common alleles decreases, their frequency in the population stabilizes, and remain circulating in a large population.

25|$|Now, imagine {{starting}} at the bottom left corner of the phase diagram, in the vacuum where μ=T=0. If we heat up the system without introducing any preference for quarks over antiquarks, this corresponds to moving vertically upwards along the T axis. At first, quarks are still confined and we create a gas of hadrons (pions, mostly). Then around T=150MeV there is a crossover to the quark gluon plasma: thermal fluctuations break up the pions, and we find a gas of quarks, antiquarks, and gluons, as well as lighter particles such as photons, electrons, positrons, etc. Following this path corresponds to travelling far back in time (<b>so</b> <b>to</b> <b>say),</b> {{to the state of}} the universe shortly after the big bang (where there was a very tiny preference for quarks over antiquarks).|$|E
500|$|Basset was the {{founding}} member of a dynasty of royal servants who continued to serve the kings of England until around 1250. The medieval writer and chronicler Orderic Vitalis described Basset {{as one of the}} new men of King Henry, who [...] "raised them, <b>so</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> from the dust". Among Basset's four sons were Richard Basset, and Nicholas. Another son was Ralph who became a cleric. A fourth son was Turstin, who held land around Wallingford. Basset also had daughters, but their names are not known. Only the first initial of his wife's name is known, which was A. Richard received the Norman estates, but not most of the English lands, perhaps because he married an heiress.|$|E
500|$|However, his {{discontent with}} the British liberal {{movement}} grew following {{the election of}} the Liberal Party's William Ewart Gladstone to the Premiership in 1880. Morris was particularly angered that Gladstone's government did not reverse the Disraeli regime's occupation of the Transvaal, introduced the Coercion Bill, and oversaw the Bombardment of Alexandria. Morris later related that while he had once believed that [...] "one might further real Socialistic progress by doing what one could on the lines of ordinary middle-class Radicalism", following Gladstone's election he came to realise [...] "that Radicalism is on the wrong line, <b>so</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> and will never develope [...] into anything more than Radicalism: in fact that it is made for and by the middle classes and will always be under the control of rich capitalists.|$|E

500|$|Critics also derided Benchley's writing. Time {{reviewer}} John Skow {{described the}} novel as [...] "cliché and crude literary calculation", where events [...] "refuse to take on life and momentum" [...] and the climax [...] "lacks only Queequeg's coffin to resemble a bath tub version of Moby-Dick." [...] Writing for The Village Voice, Donald Newlove declared that [...] "Jaws has rubber teeth for a plot.

[...] An article in The Listener criticized the plot, stating the [...] "novel only has bite, <b>so</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> at feed time," [...] and these scenes are [...] "naïve attempts at whipping along a flagging story-line." [...] Andrew Bergman of The New York Times Book Review felt that despite the book serving as [...] "fluid entertainment", [...] "passages of hollow portentousness creep in" [...] while poor scene [...] "connections [...] stark manipulations impair the narrative." ...|$|E
500|$|Pain {{was one of}} Henry's [...] "new men", who owed their {{positions}} and wealth to the king. The medieval writer Orderic Vitalis described them as a group as [...] "of base stock who had served him [...] well, raised them, <b>so</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> from the dust" [...] and that the king [...] "stationed them above earls and famous castellans". Although Orderic stated that the families of these men were not considered high status, this was probably an exaggeration on the chronicler's part. Pain's family was respectable enough, as his father held a number of properties directly from the king. It appears that Pain did not always take the king's side; the historian C. Warren Hollister has argued that Pain was not among the supporters of Henry's only surviving legitimate child, Matilda, in 1126, when Henry had his nobility swear that they would recognise her as his heiress. Hollister feels that the removal of Waleran from Pain's custody {{was a sign that}} Pain had not supported Matilda.|$|E

2500|$|Hrizea and {{his family}} found safety in Brăila, but the {{authorities}} there eventually surrendered them to Constantin. All family members were then exiled as hostages to Feyérvár. This was arranged by Rákóczi, who set Hrizea's ransom at 100,000 ducats. Hrizea could not pay that sum, and was therefore moved from a townhouse he rented to a cell in the city garrison. Xenopol suggests that Hrizea was in fact sheltered, and even allowed to command his own army of 500 Seimeni, which Rákóczi used as leverage in his dealings with Constantin. As noted by the same author, the intervention of 1655 had made Constantin entirely dependent on the Transylvanian Prince, who was now his [...] "protector and, <b>so</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> his second-hand suzerain". Eventually, the nucleus of Seimeni in Wallachia submitted to Constantin and Rákóczi. Xenopol summarizes their [...] "strange reconciliation", with the mercenaries expressing regret and referring to Constantin as a [...] "good and gentle Prince".|$|E
2500|$|On May 9, 1927, {{following}} a Federation congress, the old PSDR was reborn, {{with a more}} centralized structure. Moscovici, Petrescu, Pistiner, Jumanca and Flueraș, {{as well as the}} younger Lothar Rădăceanu, were voted in as the Executive Bureau; Jumanca was the Secretary, Moscovici the Party Treasurer. He also took charge of the PSDR's publishing activity and cultural club. It was hosted by the printing offices of Barbu Brănișteanu, on Calea Victoriei, where Moscovici was the sales manager. He had regular meetings with left-wing figures such as the Peasantist leader Constantin Stere, the physician Simion Iagnov, and Voinea's half-brother, the sociologist Henri H. Stahl. As Stahl recalls: [...] "the basis of my political conceptions, <b>so</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> came from Moscovici, who was a very interesting man. He was a very well-read man. [...] he was a furious anti-Bolshevik." [...] The enterprise, however, went out of business after publishing a single title—a brochure about Giacomo Matteotti.|$|E
2500|$|But the {{communist}} revolution {{does not end}} with the negation of individual liberty and equality ("collectivism"), but with the [...] "negation of the negation": [...] "individual property" [...] in the capitalist regime {{is in fact the}} [...] "expropriation of the immediate producers." [...] "Self-earned private property, that is based, <b>so</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> on the fusing together of the isolated, independent laboring-individual with the conditions of his labor, is supplanted by capitalistic private property, which rests on exploitation of the nominally free labor of others, i.e., on wage-labor... The capitalist mode of appropriation, the result of the capitalist mode of production, produces capitalist private property. This is the first negation of individual private property, as founded on the labor of the proprietor. But capitalist production begets, with the inexorability of a law of Nature, its own negation. It is the negation of negation. This does not re-establish private property for the producer, but gives him individual property based on the acquisition of the capitalist era: i.e., on co-operation and the possession in common of the land and of the means of production.|$|E

2500|$|In 2005, McCain {{announced}} that he supported the inclusion of intelligent design teaching in schools.

But they've got to be thoroughly presented. <b>So</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that you can only teach one line of thinking … or one belief on how people and the world was created I think there's nothing wrong with teaching different schools of thought." [...] In 2006 he seemed to back off the position a bit, saying, [...] "Should [...] be taught as a science class? Probably not." [...] McCain's 2005 book Character Is Destiny had included a highly complimentary chapter on Charles Darwin, in which McCain wrote, [...] "Darwin helped explain nature's laws. He did not speculate, in his published theories at least, on the origin of life. The only undeniable challenge the theory of evolution poses to Christian beliefs is its obvious contradiction of the idea that God created the world as it is in less than a week." ...|$|E

The chair was taken by Mr. J. G. Biggar, MP. On rising to introduce the lecturer, he soon discerned that trouble was impending, that there was, <b>so</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "a storm in the offing." [...] An [...] "Advanced" [...] person, a Mr. Flesh of Ramsbottom, came on the Platform and informed him that {{at a meeting of}} Nationalists held on the previous evening, it was decided that the lecture might be allowed to proceed only on the condition that the lecturer should first answer satisfactorily a series of questions which had been drawn up for him. The main purpose of those interrogatories was to ascertain whether he held and was prepared to support the principles of Wolfe Tone, Lord Edward Fitzgerald, and Robert Emmet. The chairman said those questions were not in order, as the lecture was to be on a non-political subject; however, he would leave it to the lecturer to deal with the queries as he thought fit, Mr. O'Connor Power then came to the front and said, amidst much noise, that with regard to the questions that had been read, his view was identical with that of the chairman. He begged leave to point out – He could say no more: the platform was rushed; there was a smashing of chairs and tables, a noise of heavy blows, and of fierce exclamations from men engaged in close combat, mingled with the shouts and screams of women, while blood flowed freely from many wounded persons ... The subject of Mr. O'Connor Power's intended lecture was [...] "Irish Wit and Humour".|$|E
