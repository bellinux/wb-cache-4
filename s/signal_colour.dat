40|$|Recent {{investigations}} {{have shown that}} smooth pursuit target selection is biased according to a hierarchy of red, green, yellow, and blue (e. g. red is always selected over green). This implies that colours higher on the hierarchy have greater attentional salience. Using the stop signal task, we conducted experiments in which go <b>signal</b> <b>colour</b> was manipulated (exps. 1 and 2) and in which stop <b>signal</b> <b>colour</b> was manipulated (exp. 3) {{to determine whether the}} hierarchy also applied to response execution and inhibition. When colour was either irrelevant (exp. 1) or relevant (exp. 2) to response execution there was no effect on reaction times or individual RT variance. When colour was relevant to response inhibition (exp. 3) estimated stop signal reaction times were significantly faster for red (~ 225 ms) relative to green (~ 250 ms) stop signals. This suggests that response inhibition, but not execution, networks are sensitive to differences in colour salience...|$|E

Since opponent processes <b>signal</b> <b>colour,</b> {{we hypothesized that}} under these viewing conditions dichromats should perceive spectral increments as coloured at detection threshold. Psychophysical detection and colour discrimination thresholds were determined for normal and dichromatic humans. Test stimuli were 2 °, 200 ms increments presented upon a white, 1000 td, spatially coincident background. As expected, normal observers were able to discriminate between white and spectral flashes at intensities near detection threshold intensities. Dichromatic observers required suprathreshold (≈ 0. 30 log units) stimulus intensities to discriminate between the white and spectral flashes. The results do not support our hypothesis and alternative explanations for the elevated colour discrimination thresholds in dichromats are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Animal signals exhibit amazing diversity, {{and even}} {{closely related species}} often have signals that differ greatly in {{physical}} form. Understanding the evolutionary forces {{that give rise to}} signal form and diversity is a major goal of studies of animal communication. In the case of visual signals, colour has received the most intense scrutiny in the literature (for a review, see Bradbury and Vehrencamp, 1998). The colours of a visual signal can serve various different functions, such as an indicator of breeding or dominance status, as an indicator of condition or as a signal of species identity. However, before a signal can serve any of these functions, it must be seen by its intended viewer, and this often occurs in a complex visual environment. Thus, {{one of the most critical}} functions of colour is to make the signal easy for the intended receiver to detect. To do this, a <b>signal</b> <b>colour</b> must efficientl...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:Quality of the Colour Composite {{video signal}} {{has become the}} basic {{criteria}} of today’s TV transmission systems (Terrestrial / Satellite / Cable). Video streaming is increasingly finding its way in day-to-day lives of people. The videos typically passes through several processing stages {{before they reach the}} end user. The effect of most processing stages is to degrade the quality of the video that passes through it. The only reliable method to assess the video quality perceived by a human observer is to ask human subjects for their opinion, which is termed subjective video quality assessment (VQA). Subjective VQA is impractical for most applications due to the human involvement in the process. Hence we go for objective analysis, which includes the verifying Colour Composite Video Signal parameters like sync pulses, colour burst and the luminance. The need to have a low cost video switcher and a CCVS analyzer with high performance and to easily carry the analyzer equipment from one place to other i. e., a portable system, made us to develop the low cost microcontroller based automatic video switcher and CCVS analyzer.

40|$|Variation {{in visual}} {{spectral}} tuning has evolved {{in concert with}} <b>signal</b> <b>colour</b> in some taxa, but there is limited evidence of this pattern in birds. To further investigate this possibility, we compared spectral sensitivity among bowerbird species that occupy different visual habitats and are highly diverged in plumage and decoration colour displays, which are important in mate choice and possibly reproductive isolation. Microspectrophotometry of violet-, short-, medium- and long-wavelength-sensitive cones revealed no significant interspecific variation in visual pigment peak spectral absorbance values that ranged between 404 – 410, 454, 503 – 511 and 558 – 568 nm, respectively. Mean cut-off wavelength values for C-, Y-, R- and P-type coloured oil droplets were 418 – 441, 508 – 523, 558 – 573 and 412 – 503 nm, respectively, with values at longer wavelengths in ventral compared with dorsal retina cones. Low ocular media mid-wavelength transmission values (340 – 352 nm) suggest that bowerbirds may represent a transitional stage in the evolution from the ancestral violet-sensitive- to the derived ultraviolet-sensitive-type short-wavelength-sensitive- 1 -based visual system found in younger passerine lineages. Sequence data obtained for rod opsin and four cone opsin genes were identical at key tuning sites, except for an interspecific leucine- 52 -alanine polymorphism in the short-wavelength-sensitive 2 opsin. There was no obvious relationship between relative proportions of cone classes and either visual habitat or display colour. Overall, we detected little interspecific variation in bowerbird spectral sensitivity and no association between sensitivity and display diversity, {{which is consistent with}} the general trend among avian taxa. 16 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Nature's most striking, {{complex and}} {{innovative}} colour signals are generated via selective reflectance from optical nanostructures (rather than selective absorbance by pigments), a {{phenomenon known as}} structural coloration. These colours reach their height of visual brilliance as sexual signals, {{a context in which}} they also express both great functional innovation and high evolutionary lability. However, owing to a historical preoccupation with pigments, we know relatively little about the evolutionary causes and consequences of innovation in structurally coloured sexual signals, especially in exemplar arthropod taxa. In this study we addressed the possibility that species differences in intraspecific mating preferences may contribute to visual and functional variation in structural coloration. We contrasted mate preferences and signal properties between two closely related butterfly species (Hypolimnas alimena and Hypolimnas bolina) that possess male-elaborated structural coloration. Hypolimnas bolina offers a valuable comparative basis because females are known to prefer highly bright and limited-view ultraviolet markings, which males generate via complex nanoscale surface multilayer arrays. Male H. alimena, by contrast, display less bright and weakly iridescent dorsal blue, arising from a simpler surface microarchitecture. In two separate experiments, we found that female H. alimena did not distinguish between males spanning a graded range of 0. 25 – 1. 4 × natural peak brightness. Only once the dorsal blue was completely obscured did male mating success suffer. Furthermore, a sample of wild phenotypes indicated greater variance for signal brightness in male H. bolina than H. alimena, but no difference in peak hue (i. e. <b>signal</b> <b>colour).</b> These results supported a priori predictions, and are consistent with a scenario whereby directional female preference has driven male signal exaggeration in H. bolina, but not its less ornamented close congener...|$|E

40|$|Colour and {{greyscale}} (black and white) pictures {{look different}} to us, {{but it is}} not clear whether the difference in appearance is a consequence of the way our visual system uses <b>colour</b> <b>signals</b> or a by-product of our experience. In principle, colour images are qualitatively different from greyscale images because they make it possible to use different processing strategies. <b>Colour</b> <b>signals</b> provide important cues for segmenting the image into areas that represent different objects and for linking together areas that represent the same object. If this property of <b>colour</b> <b>signals</b> is exploited in visual processing we would expect colour stimuli to look different, as a class, from greyscale stimuli. We would also expect that adding <b>colour</b> <b>signals</b> to greyscale signals should change the way that those signals are processed. We have investigated these questions in behavioural and in physiological experiments. We find that male marmosets (all of which are dichromats) rapidly learn to distinguish between colour and greyscale copies of the same images. The discrimination transfers to new image pairs, to new colours and to image pairs in which the colour and greyscale images are spatially different. We find that, in a proportion of neurons recorded in the marmoset visual cortex, colour-shifts in opposite directions produce similar enhancements of the response to a luminance stimulus. We conclude that colour is, both behaviourally and physiologically, a distinctive property of images. ...|$|R
