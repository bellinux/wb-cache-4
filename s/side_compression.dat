40|$|Abstract. The {{improvement}} of the load carrying capacity of concrete columns under a triaxial compressive stress results from the strain restriction. Under a triaxial stress state, {{the capacity of the}} deformation of concrete is greatly decreased with the increase of the <b>side</b> <b>compression.</b> Therefore, confining the deformation in the lateral orientation is an effective way to improve the strength and ductility of concrete columns. This paper carried out an experimental investigation on axially loaded normal strength concrete columns confined by 10 different types of materials, including steel tube, glass fiber confined steel tube (GFRP), PVC tube, carbon fiber confined PVC tube (CFRP), glas...|$|E
30|$|Globally, higher VM {{stresses}} {{were located}} {{on the right side}} of the pelvis in position 1 of the gait (left foot strike). The superior ramus experiences higher VM stresses (25  MPa) than the inferior ramus (18  MPa). Additionally, it may be noted the slight concentration of stresses with a maximum of 15  MPa on the right face of the sacrum and also on the right wing internally to the pelvic ring. Regarding principal stress vectors, the length is proportional to the absolute value, with red colour for tension and blue colour for compression. Therefore, it indicates a bending of rami by external compression and internal tension, with higher values on the right <b>side.</b> <b>Compression</b> zones are also internally located at the greater sciatic notch and sacrum.|$|E

The results showed that when the pore pressure unchanged and the compression was at a certain range, the permeability of coal decreased with the increasing of stress. While the compression was unloaded, the permeability could {{not return to the}} origin value. This was mainly because that the plastic damage was generated owing to the effect of stress and adsorption. And the coal permeability of triaxial was consistent with that of quasi- axial...|$|E

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of orthodontic relapse adds time, cost, and frustration to an orthodontic case. Little {{is known about}} the biological basis of relapse. Proper characterizations and quantification of osteoblast differentiation in a mouse model of orthodontic relapse have yet to be demonstrated. It is the goal of this study to characterize and quantify osteoblast differentiation in orthodontic relapse in an in vivo transgenic mouse model. Transgenic mice with GFP bound to Bone Sialo Protein (BSP) promoter marker, a protein expressed by early osteoblast lineage cells were used. It is hypothesized that GFP-BSP will be decreased on the <b>compression</b> <b>side</b> of the furcation of the mouse maxillary first molar when compared with the contralateral control molar in both orthodontic tooth movement and relapse. Nineteen 10 - 12 week old mice were divided into two groups: 1.) 2 weeks of OTM applied by spring, 2.) 10 days OTM followed by spring removal and 4 days of relapse movement. TUNEL staining was performed to evaluate apoptosis. Results show a marked decrease in BSP-GFP on the <b>compression</b> <b>side</b> and tension side after 2 weeks of OTM. A significant decrease was also seen on the <b>compression</b> <b>side</b> after 10 days of OTM and 4 days relapse.

40|$|Abstract — Wireless {{telemedicine}} {{is currently}} a reality, re-quiring also the transmission of medical video sequences over often unreliable links. The contrasting requirements of al-most lossless compression and low available bandwidth have to be tackled in this case. On one <b>side</b> <b>compression</b> tech-niques need to be conservative, {{in order to avoid}} removing perceptively important information; on the other side error resilience and correction should be provided, with the con-straint of a limited bandwidth. An approach based on qual-ity driven, network aware, joint source and channel coding is described in this paper. The approach has been developed in the framework of the IST PHOENIX project (www. ist-phoenix. org), focusing on wireless multimedia transmission over IP networks. After a description of the considered cross-layer approach and of the information to be exchanged among the system component blocks, the techniques con-sidered for this information exchange and the concept of “JSCC/D controllers ” are introduced.

40|$|The steady {{theory of}} V-belt {{mechanics}} {{is well established}} [1, 2, 3]. Owing to the <b>side</b> <b>compression</b> of the pulley walls, the belt penetrates into the groove a depth variable along the arc of contact and is subject to radial components of the friction forces. Nevertheless, the operative conditions of mechanical variators are seldom steady (see cars and motorcycles), because alternating phases of shift up and down of the speed ratio are continuously requested by the driver. Very few theoretical approaches to this topic are reported in the literature. They generally assume an ideal inextensible-incompressible belt and find out the path of each belt element by simple geometrical analyses. The "rigid belt " hypothesis is certainly acceptable for metal V-belts (e. g. Van Doorne) and rapid ratio changes, but become inappropriate for rubber V-belt or slow shifts. In the rubber belt case, the longitudinal elongation and the radial penetration influence the sliding direction of the single belt elements {{in conjunction with the}} overall inside/outside motion due to the opening/closing of the pulley. In the metal belt case, the plate bending is generally more significant than the belt deformation and may affect the mechanical behaviour of the drive during the ratio change for moderate shift rate [4]...|$|E

The engines employed in both programs operate at supersonic and low hypersonic speeds and use inlets employing forebody external and sidewall compression. Aerojet has developed and validated a successful design methodology applicable to these inlet types. Design features include an integrated vehicle forebody, external <b>side</b> <b>compression</b> struts, strut sidewall and throat bleed, a throat shock trap, and variable geometry internal contraction. Computation Fluid Dynamic (CFD) predictions and test data show these inlets allow substantially increased flow turning angles over other designs. These increased flow turning angles allow shorter and lighter engines than current designs, {{which in turn}} enables higher performing vehicles with broad operating characteristics. This paper describes the designs of two different inlets evaluated by the NASA-MSFC and USAF programs, discusses the results of wind tunnel tests performed by NASA-Lewis Research Center, and provides correlations of test data with CFD predictions.

Location of cracks and propagations were investigated by SEM and X-ray compositional analysis methods. The {{stress and strain}} distribution under cyclic bending loading were investigated by FEM analysis. The results obtained are as follows. (1) Crack initiation occurred at ceramic/interlayer interface at the specimen corner under cyclic bending loading. The unstable fracture occurred from the interface crack. At the 84 〜 90 % of mean strength, crack initiated at ceramic/interlayer interface at the specimen corner. (2) After a main crack occurred many microcracks appeared in order near the main crack region {{with the increase of}} maximum stress. Finally they united to the main crack under cyclic loading. The length of crack was increased with increasing maximum stress. The curve slopes of crack lengths versus stresses also increased with increasing maximum stress. Under constant cyclic bending loading, the cracks intermittently grew. (3) At <b>compression</b> <b>side,</b> when the absolute value of maximum stresses were higher than those of tension side, cracks started on the ceramic/interlayer interface and grew up to about 40 μm, and finally halted. (4) The crack initiations occurred at the ceramic/brazing filler interface. The location of crack initiation under cyclic bending loading was same as monotonic strength. (5) The crack length increment was decelerated with increasing energy release rate, then increased. The difference of the relationship between crack length increment and energy release rate was less than that of crack length increment and maximum stress. (6) From the FEM analysis, the plastic deformation progressed in interlayer when specimen was loaded and the plastic strain of interlayer left when unloaded. In the interlayer of interface, as compressional plastic strain was constrained by materials around it, tensile residual stresses occured at the <b>compression</b> <b>side</b> at end of unloading.

40|$|This study assessed: (i) how the {{magnitude}} and direction of principal strains vary for different sideways fall loading directions; (ii) how the principal strains for a sideways fall differ from physiological loading directions; (iii) the fracture mechanism during a sideways fall. Eleven human femurs were instrumented with 16 triaxial strain gauges each. The femurs were non-destructively subjected to: (a) six loading configurations covering the range of physiological loading directions; (b) twelve configurations simulating sideways falls. The femurs were eventually fractured in a sideways fall configuration while high-speed cameras recorded the event. When the same force magnitude was applied, strains were significantly larger in a sideways fall than for physiological loading directions (principal compressive strain was 70 % larger in a sideways fall). Also the compressive-to-tensile strain ratio was different: for physiological loading the largest compressive strain was only 30 % larger than the largest tensile strain; but for the sideways fall, compressive strains were {{twice as large as}} the tensile strains. Principal strains during a sideways fall were nearly perpendicular to the direction of principal strains for physiological loading. In the most critical regions (medial part of the head-neck) the direction of principal strain varied by less than 9 ° between the different physiological loading conditions, whereas it varied by up to 17 ° between the sideways fall loading conditions. This was associated with a specific fracture mechanism during sideways fall, where failure initiated on the superior-lateral <b>side</b> (<b>compression)</b> followed by later failure of the medially (tension), often exhibiting a two-peak force-displacement curve...|$|E
40|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} (RC) {{structures are}} widely used in construction. Due to aging infrastructure, increased loads, and inadequate maintenance, RC structures need to be retrofitted for prolonged lifespan and increased capacity. Traditional methods of strengthening involve the installation of fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composites to the tension side of structures. This can be problematic in practice {{because of the difficulty}} in accessing the underside, the tension side, of the structural member. In addition, traditional strengthening techniques typically result in exposing the FRP to the external environment with possible degradation and other environmental effects. 	This research investigates an innovative method to strengthen concrete structures using a combination of ultra high performance concrete (UHPC) and FRP. Using this combination, FRP {{can be applied to the}} top <b>side,</b> <b>compression</b> side, of the slab. The hypothesis is that the implementation of the UHPC overlay will push the neutral axis up to the UHPC overlay, allowing the FRP to act as a tension element at ultimate conditions. Two full scale RC slabs were cast and tested to failure; the first as a control and the second using this new strengthening technique. On the strengthened slab, the FRP was installed on top of the slab, which is the compression side. A thin UHPC overlay was cast above the FRP, forming an effective composite where the UHPC resisted all of the compressive stresses and the FRP and reinforcing steel resisted the tensile stresses. The proposed strengthening system increased the ultimate load carrying capacity of the slab by 41 %, the stiffness by 197 %, and toughness by 167 %. The relative ductility of the strengthened slab was 3. 3 times greater than the control slab at service loading and 2. 1 times greater than the control slab at failure. 	In addition, finite element models of the control and strengthened slabs were developed. The finite element models are able to accurately simulate the behavior of both slabs. A parametric study on the effect of overlay strength was also performed. It is concluded that UHPC is the compressive material of choice for this technique. The enhanced mechanical and durability characteristics of UHPC and FRP as well as the relative ease of installation makes this proposed alternative method attractive for strengthening RC structures.

40|$|The Cambium {{investigation}} {{is one in}} a pair of investigations which utilizes the Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS). Cambium seeks definitive evidence that gravity has a direct effect on cambial cells (cells located under the inner bark where secondary growth occurs) in willow, Salix babylonica. The Cambium investigation uses willow plants flown on the International Space Station to better understand the fundamental processes by which plants produce cellulose and lignin, the two main structural materials found in plant matter. On Earth, the nature of wood within tree stems varies depending on position, and that within-tree variation includes differences in cell types and chemistry including lignin and cellulose, two major components of wood influencing wood strength, usefulness and carbon content. Reaction wood is an extreme example of such variation, and it is believed that reaction wood develops as a reaction to the influence of gravity. For the Cambium experiment, young willow plants will be launched to the ISS where their stems will be looped in an attempt to induce reaction wood formation. After on-orbit growth, the plants will be preserved and returned to Earth for analysis. Understanding the role of gravity in wood formation is expected to enable wiser management of forests for carbon sequestration as well as better utilization of trees for wood products. Detailed Research Description: The Cambium experiment will provide an understanding of physiological processes such as gene expression, metabolism and general plant development that are affected in plant systems exposed to space flight. Cambium seeks definitive evidence that gravity has a direct effect on the cambial cells (cells located under the inner bark where secondary growth occurs) that contribute to xylogenesis (reaction wood formation) in willow plants, Salix babylonica. Tension wood fibers differentiate on the upper sides of stems when the stem is altered from its normal (vertical) growth position by looping. This reaction wood response does not occur if the orientation of the plant stem with respect to gravity is not altered. If a localized zone of tension wood should be formed in looped stems under microgravity conditions, this would be the first conclusive evidence that gravity is not required. On the other hand, if a zone of tension wood is not produced in looped stems (subjected to tension on one <b>side,</b> <b>compression</b> on the other) in microgravity, this would be the first definitive evidence that gravity has a direct effect on the cambial cells which contribute to reaction wood formation. Following return to Earth the plants will be analyzed by microscopy and chemical methods...|$|E
