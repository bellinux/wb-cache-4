5|$|Critical {{reception}} of the show was good to average, with a general appreciation for the realistic portrayal of Middle America. Generally speaking, however, there were <b>serious</b> <b>doubts</b> about whether the show {{would be able to}} stay on the air very long, though it has since gone on to complete five seasons. The episode's viewership of just over seven million was characterized as disappointing, though it did relatively well among men aged 18 to 34.|$|E
5|$|In Washington, Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully {{conduct a}} {{discreet}} {{meeting with a}} Russian informant, Vsevlod Pudovkin, {{who claims to have}} seen a UFO at a secret research center. Upon returning to FBI headquarters, Mulder heads out on vacation to visit Graceland, leaving Scully to follow up on the Pudovkin case for him. Scully is uninterested in the case and expresses <b>serious</b> <b>doubts</b> about Pudovkin's credibility, leading to an argument with an inconsiderate Mulder. Scully becomes upset over the direction her life and career are going.|$|E
5|$|Between late 2005–2006 Hwang {{was accused}} {{of a series of}} misconducts. The first {{allegations}} related to his work prior to Snuppy; the claim that he had successfully cloned a human embryo. The charges alleged Hwang had paid for egg donations and that some of eggs came from his employees, which constitute serious breaches of the code of bioethics. It was later found that photographs he published did not depict what was suggested and that most of the stem-cell lines he claimed to have created were not clones at all. This brought <b>serious</b> <b>doubts</b> onto the validity of Snuppy, which Hwang consistently claimed was a genuine clone. Hwang hired HumanPass Inc., a Korean DNA lab to investigate Snuppy, who found that Snuppy was authentic. The findings by HumanPass were dismissed {{on the grounds that they}} were employed by Hwang, and a panel at the Seoul National University ordered their own investigation. The investigation found that, despite his fabrications in previous projects, Hwang's research related to Snuppy was accurate and Snuppy was a clone of the adult Afghan hound. As a result of his forgeries, Hwang was indicted for fraud and dismissed from the university.|$|E

5|$|The normal {{progress}} for an able Magister {{was to go}} on to further study in one of the four faculties at Leuven: Theology, Medicine, Canon Law and Roman Law. Gisbert might have hoped that Mercator would go further in theology and train for the priesthood but Mercator did not: like many twenty year old young men he was having his first <b>serious</b> <b>doubts.</b> The problem was the contradiction between the authority of Aristotle and his own biblical study and scientific observations, particularly in relation to the creation and description of the world. Such doubt was heresy at the University and {{it is quite possible that}} he had already said enough in classroom disputations to come to the notice of the authorities: fortunately he did not put his sentiments into print. He left Leuven for Antwerp, there to devote his time to contemplation of philosophy. This period of his life is clouded in uncertainty. He certainly read widely but only succeeded in uncovering more contradictions between the world of the Bible and the world of geography, a hiatus which would occupy him for the rest of his life. He certainly could not effect a reconciliation between his studies and the world of Aristotle.|$|E
25|$|The Kriegler report, {{commissioned}} {{to investigate the}} violent aftermath of the 2007 elections and alleged vote-rigging, stated that about 1.2 million dead voters existed in the voters register, raising <b>serious</b> <b>doubts</b> {{to the integrity of}} the election.|$|E
25|$|French {{was awakened}} at 2am on 26 August with news that Haig's I Corps was under attack at Landrecies, and ordered Smith-Dorrien (3:50 am) to assist him. Smith-Dorrien {{replied that he}} was “unable to move a man”. This irritated French, as Haig (who already had <b>serious</b> <b>doubts</b> of French's competence) was a protegé of his.|$|E

50|$|Drosnin {{attempted}} {{to find this}} obelisk and explain why the Third World War didn't begin in 2006 as Drosnin had suggested in The Bible Code II. These events did not occur, casting <b>serious</b> <b>doubt</b> on the whole paradigm.|$|R

25|$|In 1853, {{under the}} tutelage of his long-time {{retainer}} Bhajan Lal (himself a Christian convert), he converted to Christianity at Fatehgarh with the approval of the Governor-General Lord Dalhousie. His conversion remains controversial, and it occurred before he turned 15. He later had <b>serious</b> <b>doubts</b> and regrets regarding this decision and reconverted back to Sikhism in 1886.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, after a {{brief period}} in which the media {{coverage}} generated a great interest in the Beta Israel community, the interest among the Jewish communities world wide declined. This happened mainly because <b>serious</b> <b>doubts</b> still remained about the Jewishness of the Beta Israel community and because the Alliance Israélite Universelle organization did not comply with Halévy's recommendations.|$|E
25|$|Sheridan {{read the}} play and noticed it was {{relatively}} simplistic compared to Shakespeare's other works. John Philip Kemble, actor and manager of Drury Lane Theatre, later claimed he had <b>serious</b> <b>doubts</b> about its authenticity; he also suggested that the play appear on April Fool's Day, though Samuel Ireland objected, and the play {{was moved to the}} next day.|$|E

50|$|In 1925, {{the scholar}} Andrea Balletti {{published}} a {{volume on the}} history of Reggio Emilia, which put the existence of Luceria in <b>serious</b> <b>doubt.</b> He pointed to the paucity of discoveries and argued that the settlement was an unreliable invention of historians.|$|R

25|$|Aided by {{the monkey}} prince Hanuman, Rama {{eventually}} discovers Sita's location and brings the monkey army {{to assist in}} her rescue. Ravana is slain and Sita restored to her husband, although he expresses <b>serious</b> <b>doubts</b> concerning her fidelity during her confinement. She submits to a trial by fire, a test of her purity; upon throwing herself into the flames, she is immediately rescued by the gods, who all proclaim her devotion and fidelity.|$|E
25|$|In August 2009, {{scientists}} in Israel raised <b>serious</b> <b>doubts</b> concerning {{the use of}} DNA by law enforcement as the ultimate method of identification. In a paper {{published in the journal}} Forensic Science International: Genetics, the Israeli researchers demonstrated {{that it is possible to}} manufacture DNA in a laboratory, thus falsifying DNA evidence. The scientists fabricated saliva and blood samples, which originally contained DNA from a person other than the supposed donor of the blood and saliva.|$|E
25|$|A U.S. President {{decides to}} replace his Secretary of State to promote {{rapprochement}} with the Soviet Union. Nominee Robert Leffingwell, a darling of liberals, {{is viewed by}} many conservative senators as an appeaser. Others, including the pivotal character of Senator Seabright (Seab) Cooley of South Carolina, have <b>serious</b> <b>doubts</b> about Leffingwell's character. The book {{tells the story of}} an up-and-down nomination process that most people fully expect to result in a quick approval of the controversial nominee.|$|E

25|$|However, {{there are}} <b>serious</b> <b>doubts</b> about the used methods and the {{interpretation}} of the results, especially the use of 0.5 as cut-off point for the effect-size. A complete reanalysis and recalculation based on the same FDA data discovered that the Kirsch study suffered from important flaws in the calculations. The authors concluded that although {{a large percentage of the}} placebo response was due to expectancy, this was not true for the active drug. Besides confirming drug effectiveness, they found that the drug effect was not related to depression severity.|$|E
25|$|On one hand, Enăchiuc's {{proposition}} can {{be criticized}} for {{the method of}} transliteration. Symbols that characteristically appear in the same context throughout the codex are regularly transliterated with different letters, so that the patterns in the original code are lost in the transliteration. On the other hand, Enăchiuc is criticized as a linguist and historian. She provided the only linguistic source of a hitherto unknown state of the Romanian language, and her text (even with her glossary) raises so <b>serious</b> <b>doubts</b> both in its linguistic and historic authenticity that they render her work unscientific.|$|E
25|$|On 29 June, a CIA case officer flew in to Xieng Dat to {{appraise}} the combat {{effectiveness of the}} Neutralists. He met with a sullen commanding officer, Colonel Sing, who reported the desertion of 50 soldiers the previous night, and claimed {{to be short of}} weaponry. On the other hand, when the case officer moved on to the Hmong, the CIA man found Vang Pao personally firing a 4.2 inch mortar at the enemy. The inspection tour left <b>serious</b> <b>doubts</b> as to whether the Hmong had sufficient military power to tackle an offensive by themselves. To further complicate matters, Vang Pao and the Neutralists loathed one another.|$|E
50|$|Paul Krugman {{said that}} the {{consumption}} tax hike from 5 percent to 8 percent raised <b>serious</b> <b>doubt</b> about Japan's economic recovery, and {{that in order to}} lift the economy, the government should decrease the VAT to 5 percent and work to build up inflation expectations.|$|R

25|$|The already-strained {{relationship}} with Ray Saidel in New Hampshire was finally broken during negotiations between Saidel and TVR in May 1959. Derek Harris, the TVR chairman, attempted to pressure Saidel into purchasing fifty cars per year (rather than the previously agreed upon twenty-five.) Saidel {{walked out of}} the negotiations and made it clear {{in a letter to the}} factory, dated 18 June, that he felt TVR's expectations to be extremely unrealistic. By July 1959, the situation at TVR was dire; there were significant inconsistencies in pricing and in financial recordkeeping, stocks of components were not being properly managed, the factory did not employ enough skilled workers, and there were <b>serious</b> <b>doubts</b> about the capability of the company's leadership.|$|E
25|$|After Shastri's death, {{his wife}} Lalita Shastri had alleged he was poisoned. An epic poetry book in Hindi titled Lalita Ke Aansoo written by Krant M. L. Verma was {{published}} in 1978. In this book, the tragic story {{about the death of}} Shastri has been narrated by his wife Lalita Shastri. There are still <b>serious</b> <b>doubts</b> surrounding the nature of his death. His son, Sunil Shastri, asked the government to unravel the mystery behind Lal Bahadur Shastri's death. Raising doubts about the dark blue spots and cut marks on the abdomen of his father's body after his death in 1966, Sunil asked how the cut marks appeared if a post-mortem had not been conducted.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, a team at HP Labs {{claimed to}} have found Chua's missing memristor based on an {{analysis}} of a thin film of titanium dioxide thus connecting the operation of RRAM devices to the memristor concept. The HP result {{was published in the}} scientific journal Nature. Following this claim, Leon Chua has argued that the memristor definition could be generalized to cover all forms of two-terminal non-volatile memory devices based on resistance switching effects. There are, however, some <b>serious</b> <b>doubts</b> as to whether the memristor can actually exist in physical reality. Additionally, some experimental evidence contradicts Chua's generalization since a non-passive nanobattery effect is observable in resistance switching memory. Chua also argued that the memristor is the oldest known circuit element, with its effects predating the resistor, capacitor and inductor.|$|E
