5|$|Historians' {{assessments}} of the Vengeance's career in Australian service differ. While there is consensus that the type was obsolete, <b>some</b> <b>argue</b> that it nevertheless proved successful. Others, including the RAAF's Air Power Development Centre, have judged that the Vengeance's performance was mixed and the type was not suited to Australia's requirements.|$|E
5|$|On the {{macroeconomic}} scale, Lars-Hendrik Röller and Leonard Waverman {{suggested a}} causal link between good telecommunication infrastructure and economic growth. Few dispute {{the existence of}} a correlation although <b>some</b> <b>argue</b> it is wrong to view the relationship as causal.|$|E
5|$|Other {{details about}} the {{poisoning}} have always been in dispute. While <b>some</b> <b>argue</b> that Claudius was in Rome, others claim he was in Sinuessa on the night he was poisoned. Whether one ingestion of poison was only enough to cause Claudius to fall ill and whether a second dose was given to kill him is also debated.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{adoption}} of double hull has been more of an economic than a purely architectural decision, <b>some</b> <b>argue</b> that double-sided ships receive less comprehensive surveys and suffer more from hidden corrosion. In spite of opposition, double hulls became a requirement for Panamax and Capesize vessels in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Women {{from within}} the Black Lives Matter, {{including}} professor and civil rights advocate Treva B. Lindsey, have argued that BLM has sidelined black women's experiences in favor of black men's experiences. For example, <b>some</b> <b>argue</b> that more protests have been organized around the killings of Michael Brown and Trayvon Martin than around the killings of Kayla Moore or Rekia Boyd.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Supreme Court's {{desire to}} resolve {{conflicts}} between circuit courts, legal scholars disagree about whether circuit splits are detrimental or beneficial. <b>Some</b> <b>argue</b> that circuit splits are harmful because they create confusion and encourage forum shopping, while other {{scholars argue that}} variation among circuits allows local courts to experiment with new laws that reflect the values of local residents. Scholars have also observed that regional variations in {{different areas of the}} United States have provided certain circuits with a particular specialization or expertise in some subjects of the law.|$|E

5000|$|Languages of the {{northwest}} coast of North America, including Salishan, Wakashan and Chinookan languages, allow stop consonants and voiceless fricatives as syllables at the phonemic level, {{in even the most}} careful enunciation. An example is Chinook [...] those two women are coming this way out of the water. Linguists have analyzed this situation in various ways, <b>some</b> <b>arguing</b> that such syllables have no nucleus at all and <b>some</b> <b>arguing</b> that the concept of [...] "syllable" [...] cannot clearly be applied at all to these languages.|$|R
5|$|Supporters of {{evolution}} dismiss such criticisms as counterfactual, and <b>some</b> <b>argue</b> that the opposite {{seems to be}} the case. A study published by the author and illustrator Gregory S. Paul found that religious beliefs, including belief in creationism and disbelief in evolution, are positively correlated with social ills like crime. The Barna Group surveys find that Christians and non-Christians in the U.S. have similar divorce rates, and the highest divorce rates in the U.S. are among Baptists and Pentecostals, both sects which reject evolution and embrace creationism.|$|E
5|$|The topics the Drapier {{addresses}} span from absentee land {{owners to}} importing of goods from Britain to the favouring of Englishmen over Irishmen for Irish governmental positions. These issues were the many issues that Swift cared about and saw as threatening Ireland before Wood's halfpence controversy. However, these individual issues {{were not as}} important as the independence and unity of Ireland: the specifics of independence were less important than self-rule. <b>Some</b> <b>argue</b> that Swift, after Wood's patent was withdrawn, removed himself from the political landscape to focus on writing Gulliver's Travels, in which he picked up many of the same ideas.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} related genus Barosaurus, the very long neck of Diplodocus {{is the source}} of much {{controversy}} among scientists. A 1992 Columbia University study of diplodocid neck structure indicated that the longest necks would have required a 1.6-ton heart — a tenth of the animal's body weight. The study proposed that animals like these would have had rudimentary auxiliary 'hearts' in their necks, whose only purpose was to pump blood up to the next 'heart'. <b>Some</b> <b>argue</b> that the near-horizontal posture {{of the head and neck}} would have eliminated the problem of supplying blood to the brain, as it would not be elevated.|$|E
50|$|The play gained mixed {{response}} from psychiatrists {{at the time}} of its first broadcast, with <b>some</b> <b>arguing</b> that Kate is depressed and hysterical rather than truly schizophrenic.|$|R
50|$|Another {{debate was}} over Zhang Xun's refusal to surrender. <b>Some</b> <b>argued</b> that, when the Tang army {{ran out of}} food {{supplies}} around July 757 AD, the army should have surrendered, which would have prevented the cannibalism that happened later on. On the other hand, <b>some</b> <b>argued</b> that Zhang Xun made the correct choice in delaying the Yan army {{for as long as}} he could. They believed that his only mistake was wrongly believing that the other Tang governors, or even the imperial guards, would give him support much earlier than October.|$|R

5|$|DST has mixed {{effects on}} health. In {{societies}} with fixed work schedules it provides more afternoon sunlight for outdoor exercise. It alters sunlight exposure; {{whether this is}} beneficial depends on one's location and daily schedule, as sunlight triggers vitamin D synthesis in the skin, but overexposure can lead to skin cancer. DST may help in depression by causing individuals to rise earlier, but <b>some</b> <b>argue</b> the reverse. The Retinitis Pigmentosa Foundation Fighting Blindness, chaired by blind sports magnate Gordon Gund, successfully lobbied in 1985 and 2005 for U.S. DST extensions. DST shifts are associated with higher rates of ischemic stroke {{in the first two}} days after the shift, though not in the week thereafter.|$|E
5|$|From the 10th century BC onwards, Assyria {{fought for}} control of the {{southern}} Levant. Frequently, cities and kingdoms of the southern Levant appealed to Egypt for aid in their struggles against the powerful Assyrian army. Taharqa enjoyed some initial success in his attempts to regain a foothold in the Near East. Taharqa aided the Judean King Hezekiah when Hezekiah and Jerusalem was besieged by the Assyrian king, Sennacherib. Scholars disagree on the primary reason for Assyria's abandonment of their siege on Jerusalem. Reasons for the Assyrian withdrawal range from conflict with the Egyptian/Kushite army to divine intervention to surrender to disease. Henry Aubin argues that the Kushite/Egyptian army saved Jerusalem from the Assyrians and prevented the Assyrians from returning to capture Jerusalem for the remainder of Sennacherib's life (20 years). <b>Some</b> <b>argue</b> that disease was the primary reason for failing to actually take the city; however, Senacherib's annals claim Judah was forced into tribute regardless.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the worsening security situation, William conducted his second northern campaign in 1069. He built another castle in York, on what is now Baile Hill {{on the west bank}} of the Ouse opposite the first castle, in an effort to improve his control over the city. This second castle was also a motte and bailey design, with the Baile Hill motte probably reached by a horizontal bridge and steps cut up the side of the motte. Later that year, a Danish Viking fleet sailed up to York along the Humber and the Ouse, and attacked both castles with the assistance of Cospatrick of Northumbria and a number of local rebels. The Normans, attempting to drive the rebels back, set fire to some of the city's houses. The fire grew out of control and also set fire to York Minster and, <b>some</b> <b>argue,</b> the castles as well. The castles were captured and partially dismantled, and Malet was taken hostage by the Danes.|$|E

5|$|Male {{participation}} in feminism is encouraged by feminists and {{is seen as}} an important strategy for achieving full societal commitment to gender equality. Many male feminists and pro-feminists are active in both women's rights activism, feminist theory, and masculinity studies. However, <b>some</b> <b>argue</b> that while male engagement with feminism is necessary, it is problematic because of the ingrained social influences of patriarchy in gender relations. The consensus today in feminist and masculinity theories is that both genders can and should cooperate to achieve the larger goals of feminism. It has been proposed that, in large part, this can be achieved through considerations of women's agency.|$|E
5|$|Many {{recently}} developed SGDs include performance measurement and analysis tools to help monitor the content used by an individual. This raises concerns about privacy, and <b>some</b> <b>argue</b> that the device user {{should be involved}} in the decision to monitor use in this way. Similar concerns have been raised regarding the proposals for devices with automatic content generation, and privacy is increasingly a factor in design of SGDs. As AAC devices are designed to be used in all areas of a user’s life, there are sensitive legal, social, and technical issues centred on a wide family of personal data management problems that can be found in contexts of AAC use. For example, SGDs may have to be designed so that they support the user's right to delete logs of conversations or content that has been added automatically.|$|E
5|$|Religious {{debates over}} the Harry Potter series of books by J. K. Rowling are based on claims that the novels contain occult or Satanic subtexts. A number of Protestant, Catholic, and Orthodox Christians have argued against the series, as have some Shia and Sunni Muslims. Supporters of the series {{have said that the}} magic in Harry Potter bears little {{resemblance}} to occultism, being more in the vein of fairy tales such as Cinderella and Snow White, or to the works of C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien, both of whom are known for writing fantasy novels with Christian subtexts. Far from promoting a particular religion, <b>some</b> <b>argue,</b> the Harry Potter novels {{go out of their way}} to avoid discussing religion at all. However, the author of the series, J. K. Rowling, describes herself as a practising Christian, and many have noted the Christian references which she includes in the final novel Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.|$|E
30|$|Most {{scholars}} and United Nations’ official reports believe China’s total fertility rate is about 1.4 – 1.5, while <b>some</b> <b>argues</b> {{that it has}} fallen to 1.18, based on census in 2010 (Mu 2012).|$|R

5|$|The early texts do {{not contain}} just-war {{ideology}} as such. <b>Some</b> <b>argue</b> that a sutta in the Gamani Samyuttam rules out all military service. In this passage, a soldier asks the Buddha {{if it is true}} that, as he has been told, soldiers slain in battle are reborn in a heavenly realm. The Buddha reluctantly replies that if he is killed in battle while his mind is seized with the intention to kill, he will undergo an unpleasant rebirth. In the early texts, a person's mental state at the time of death is generally viewed as having a great impact on the next birth.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} main {{accounts}} of the battle, none of them contemporary. The closest is Polybius, who wrote his account 50 years after the battle. Livy wrote {{in the time of}} Augustus, and Appian later still. Appian's account describes events that have no relation with those of Livy and Polybius. Polybius portrays the battle as the ultimate nadir of Roman fortunes, functioning as a literary device such that the subsequent Roman recovery is more dramatic. For example, <b>some</b> <b>argue</b> that his casualty figures are exaggerated—"more symbolic than factual". Livy portrays the Senate in the role of hero and hence assigns blame for the Roman defeat to the low-born Varro. Blaming Varro also serves to lift blame from the Roman soldiers, whom Livy has a tendency to idealize. Scholars tend to discount Appian's account. The verdict of Philip Sabin—"a worthless farrago"—is typical.|$|E
5|$|After Edgehill, Rupert asked Charles for a swift cavalry {{attack on}} London before the Earl of Essex's army could return. The King's senior counsellors, however, {{urged him to}} advance slowly on the capital with the whole army. By the time they arrived, the city had {{organised}} defences against them. <b>Some</b> <b>argue</b> that, in delaying, the Royalists had perhaps lost their best chance of winning the war, although others have argued that Rupert's proposed attack would have had trouble penetrating a hostile London. Instead, early in 1643, Rupert began to clear the South-West, taking Cirencester in February before moving further against Bristol, a key port. Rupert took Bristol in July with his brother Maurice using Cornish forces and was appointed Governor of the city. By mid-1643 Rupert had become so well known {{that he was an}} issue in any potential peace accommodation—Parliament was seeking to see him punished as part of any negotiated solution, and the presence of Rupert at the court, close to the King during the negotiations, was perceived as a bellicose statement in itself.|$|E
50|$|Although <b>some</b> <b>argued</b> that {{easier access}} to {{abortion}} would cause abortion rates to increase, {{the number of abortions}} has remained stable since the early 1970s, especially when adjusted for demographic changes related to fertility.|$|R
50|$|In 1990, Coleman's DNA was tested. He {{was found}} to be within the 2% of the {{population}} who could have committed the crime. <b>Some</b> <b>argued</b> that DNA and blood tests combined reduced this figure to 0.2%.|$|R
50|$|Because {{the body}} {{had been found in}} a {{different}} state (Missouri), <b>some</b> <b>argued</b> for federal jurisdiction, but because Hall was arrested and in custody in Johnson County, that jurisdiction had the legal authority to pursue the case.|$|R
