The eco-environment of the Yangtze River and Three Gorges Reservoir Region is severely impacted by serious soil erosion in that region. Take the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) as the foundation, and the choice of the rains etching power, the tlerrain fluctuation degree, the soil texture and the vegetation cover and so on, the natural factor is as the soil erosion sensitive appraisal target. According to target graduation standard of the Chongqing natural environment characteristic formulation appraisal, we utilize GIS and RS technology, and obtain that the extremely <b>sensitive</b> <b>area</b> of Chongqing is 1 159. 41 km 2, the highly <b>sensitive</b> <b>area</b> is 4 892. 19 km 2, the moderate <b>sensitive</b> <b>area</b> is 7 014. 4 km 2, the mikl <b>sensitive</b> <b>area</b> is 2 882. 97 km 2, and the general <b>sensitive</b> <b>area</b> is 13 673. 94 km 2, It accounts for 3. 93 %, 16. 59 %, 23. 79 %, 9. 79 % and 46. 38 % respectively in Chongqing.

5|$|Chelation challenge, {{also known}} as {{provocation}} testing, is used to indicate an elevated and mobilizable body burden of heavy metals including lead. This testing involves collecting urine before and after administering a one-off dose of chelating agent to mobilize heavy metals into the urine. Then urine is analyzed by a laboratory for levels of heavy metals; from this analysis overall body burden is inferred. Chelation challenge mainly measures the burden of lead in soft tissues, though whether it accurately reflects long-term exposure or the amount of lead stored in bone remains controversial. Although the technique {{has been used to}} determine whether chelation therapy is indicated and to diagnose heavy metal exposure, some evidence does not support these uses as blood levels after chelation are not comparable to the reference range typically used to diagnose heavy metal poisoning. The single chelation dose could also redistribute the heavy metals to more <b>sensitive</b> <b>areas</b> such as central nervous system tissue.|$|E
5|$|The {{wings of}} bats are much thinner and consist of more bones {{than that of}} birds, {{allowing}} bats to maneuver more accurately and fly with more lift and less drag. By folding the wings inwards towards their body on the upstroke, they use 35% less energy during flight than birds. The membranes are delicate, ripping easily; however, the tissue of the bat's membrane is able to regrow, such that small tears can heal quickly. The surface of their wings is equipped with touch-sensitive receptors on small bumps called Merkel cells, also found on human fingertips. These <b>sensitive</b> <b>areas</b> are different in bats, as each bump has a tiny hair in the center, making it even more sensitive and allowing the bat to detect and collect information about the air flowing over its wings, and to fly more efficiently by changing the shape of its wings in response.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of urbanization in China, {{the ecological environment}} {{is more and more}} seriously threatened; most cities should be focused on urban ecological environment construction and protection. In this paper, we choose the vegetation, slope, elevation, surface river system as the factors, and their weights were determined by analytic hierarchy process (AHP). Applying with GIS spatial analysis technique, the ecological sensitivity of the four factors was divided into four grades which contains high <b>sensitive</b> <b>area,</b> moderately <b>sensitive</b> <b>area,</b> low <b>sensitive</b> <b>area</b> and insensitive area areas occupied 9. 43 %, 36. 46 %, 50. 61 % and 3. 50 %.

25|$|The lack of {{wastewater}} treatment {{in some cities}} and towns discharging wastewater into <b>sensitive</b> <b>areas</b> is another matter of concern. In January 2008 the European Commission sent France a final warning alerting it {{that it will be}} taken to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) for the second time and possibly face fines unless it quickly brings its waste water treatment up to EU standards. France is not complying with the 1991 EU directive on urban waste water treatment. The deadline for treating all wastewater covered by the directive was 31 December 2000. In 2004 the European Court of Justice (ECJ) condemned France for failing to designate eleven areas as sensitive and for inadequate treatment facilities in a number of settlements which discharge their waste waters into these areas. The ECJ also found that 121 settlements breached the directive by discharging their waste waters into previously designated <b>sensitive</b> <b>areas.</b> In 2006 France designated the eleven areas as sensitive. However, 140 settlements – including the city of Paris – continue to discharge into these <b>sensitive</b> <b>areas.</b> With regard to the 121 settlements discharging into the previously designated <b>sensitive</b> <b>areas</b> France proceeded to rearrange them into 164 settlements, resulting in some settlements no longer meeting the threshold level of 10,000 residents at which the directive applies. The Commission considers such rearranging of settlements to avoid compliance with the directive unacceptable. In November 2009 it referred the matter to the ECJ.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The spatial {{characteristics}} of ensemble transform Kalman filter (ETKF) <b>sensitive</b> <b>area</b> predictions (SAPs) are explored using ensemble forecasts from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts {{for the period}} of the 2003 North Atlantic THORPEX Regional Campaign. The ensemble size necessary for a robust <b>sensitive</b> <b>area</b> prediction is found to be surprisingly small: a 10 -member ensemble is capable of replicating approximately the same <b>sensitive</b> <b>area</b> structure as a 50 -member ensemble. This result is corroborated {{by the fact that the}} leading eigenvector of the ensemble perturbations explains over 70 % of the ensemble variance and possesses a nearly identical spatial structure regardless of the ensemble size. The structures of the SAPs were found to vary with the lead-time between the ensemble initialization and the adaptive observing time, indicating the necessity of using as recent an ensemble as possible in ensemble-based <b>sensitive</b> <b>area</b> predictions. The ETKF SAPs exhibit similar structures at different levels in the atmosphere and there is no indication of a vertical tilt. A relationship is found between the SAPs and the zonal wind, horizontal temperature gradient and the Eady index, indicating that the ETKF identifies regions with significant gradients in the mass-momentum field as regions of large initial error or large error growth.
