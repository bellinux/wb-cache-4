Hartman sprang in front of me. This was no time for explanations. We were well dressed, and that was enough. His fist shot out, striking the woman between her burning eyes. The impact of the blow drove her backward, but she struck the wall of her on-coming fellows and bounced forward again, dazed and helpless, the brandished hatchet falling feebly on Hartman's shoulder.|$|E

Formerly the Dollhouse's most popular Doll, she was attacked by Alpha {{with a pair of}} scissors, causing extensive facial scarring. Shortly afterward, Alpha killed the actual Dr. Saunders, and Whiskey was imprinted with his personality and skill-set to serve as his replacement before the events of the first episode. Saunders has trouble adjusting to the realization that she is merely Topher's creation, and objects to being wiped or restored as that would be equivalent to dying. She takes leave of the Dollhouse for some time to find herself. Later, she begins a relationship with Boyd and he brings her back to the Dollhouse for the confrontation with Rossum. Boyd is later revealed to be one of Rossum's founders and has been working against the group all along.

Heartbroken, Dottie wonders what to do and decides that she must go ahead and collect her tooth on her own, or Lori may forever give up believing in fairies. When she arrives at Lori's house, Dottie has a lot of difficulty getting around, partly because she refuses to wear the glasses she needs in order to see well. Dottie tries the tooth-retrieving [...] "sparkling" [...] spell, but is unsuccessful. She suffers from a cold, and when she tries to get the tooth on her own, without the aid of her wand, <b>she</b> <b>lets</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> big sneeze and wakes up the sleeping girl. Lori wonders who she is for a minute, but seeing her wings and wand she realizes that the tooth fairy has finally arrived. Dottie is dismayed and disappointed, knowing that she has broken one of the major rules of the tooth fairies; getting seen by humans is prohibited. Still, Lori, who is also afraid of wearing her new glasses, allows Dottie to spend the night inside her dollhouse and the next morning, she invites her new friend to come to school with her. Though Dottie tries to explain that she must return home and practice for her exams, she is touched by Lori's pleas and agrees to stay with her the remainder of the week. During the days the two of them spend together, they develop a strong bond and both are heartbroken when they must say goodbye. However, though Dottie is scolded afterwards for allowing herself to be seen by a human child, her good heart is rewarded in the end when a classmate, Twinkles, speaks out for her and her friendship with Lori.|$|R

The affair quickly goes to some dark places, with power and class playing a key role.The movie starts with a prologue that sees a young Miss Julie aimlessly wandering in the empty confines of her father’s castle. We see her calling out for her mother and walking by the brook where she sees one of her dolls stuck in <b>a</b> tree. <b>She</b> <b>lets</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> slightly sinister snicker at the sight of the abandoned doll, and returns to her vast mansion. We jump to Midsummer Night 1890, where the same castle is deserted, save for three individuals; Cathleen the maid (Samantha Morton), John the valet and Miss Julie, the count's daughter. Cathleen and John immediately gossip about the lady of the house, specifically how she forced John to dance with her. The flirty dynamic between Cathleen and John suggests a familiarity that oversteps the boundaries of a working relationship, and John doesn’t fail to notice Cathleen’s jealous reaction. And then, Miss Julie enters. Cathleen takes her leave to look after Miss Julie’s suffering dog, while the young aristocrat, who appears to be in a mischievous sort of mood, traps John. The night grows stranger still, as master and servant continue to exchange impassioned monologues composed of lustful innuendoes and agonizing tension. At one moment, John confesses that he’s been in love with her since he first laid eyes on her as a child, and the next sees him in staunch denial, quick to remind her of their vastly different positions on the social ladder. She’s just as capricious, ordering him around like a slave, and then transforming into a damsel in distress. The back-and-forth continues, until libido overpowers them both and they end up in John’s bedroom. Be it a product of John’s uncontrollable instincts, or Julie’s need to be wanted, the sex comes with catastrophic implications and the tensions continue to ascend to a boiling point.|$|R

50|$|This {{is one of}} {{the more}} {{interesting}} Works of Xiang Jing. It shows two women in modern clothing, one of which is cowering in fear while the other is smiling. The woman that is smiling has her hand shaped as a gun and it pointing it directly towards the head of the other woman. The woman that is in fear does not seem to realize the feeling on her head is just the finger of the other woman. She truly believes she is about to die. After looking closely, her eyes are shut and it feels like <b>she</b> is <b>letting</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> terrified scream. The other woman seems to be taking joy in this action. This is a good example of how Xiang Jing shows a sense of violence through her work. The woman is taking pleasure in the fear and fear of the other woman. The woman who is in fear is vulnerable because of her fear of death. The women are in modern clothes, Xiang Jing is trying to show that some women live in this sort of fear in the modern day. She is showing that there are two different types of women; the ones who fear and those who are feared. She could also be playing on the violence of society causing people to live in fear or society causing the violence. This is another sculpture painted in porcelain. It is very realistic. Unlike Your Body, the women are in shape but they seem real still. Xiang Jing creates lifelike sculpture to portray a stronger message to the audience.|$|R

6000|$|It was not {{surprising}} that Lady Clavering should dislike her solitude at Clavering Park house, nor surprising that Sir Hugh should find the place disagreeable. The house was a large, square stone building, {{with none of the}} prettinesses of modern country-houses about it. The gardens were away from the house, and the cold, desolate, fiat park came up close around the windows: The rooms were very large and lofty--very excellent for the purpose of a large household, but with nothing of that snug, pretty comfort which solitude requires for its solace. The furniture was old and heavy, and the hangings were dark in color. Lady Clavering when alone there--and she generally was alone--never entered the rooms on the ground-floor. Nor did she ever pass through the wilderness of a hall by which the front door was to be reached. Throughout more than half her days she never came down stairs at all; but when she did so, preparatory to being dragged about the parish lanes in the old family carriage, <b>she</b> was <b>let</b> <b>out</b> at <b>a</b> small side-door; and so it came to pass that during the absences of the lord of the mansion, the shutters were not even moved from any of the lower windows.
