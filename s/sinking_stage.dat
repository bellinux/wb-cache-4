40|$|Abstract. Spot welding can be {{considered}} a very common joining technique in automotive and transportation industries as it permits to obtain effective lap-joints with short process times and what is more it is easily developed through robots and automated systems. Recently the Friction Stir Spot Welding (FSSW) process has been proposed as a natural evolution of the already known Friction Stir Welding (FSW) process, allowing to obtain sound spot joints that do not suffer from the insurgence of typical welding defects due to the fusion of the base material. In the paper, a modified Friction Stir Spot Welding (FSSW) process, with a spiral circular movement given to the tool after the <b>sinking</b> <b>stage,</b> is proposed. A continuum based numerical model for Friction Stir Spot Welding process is developed, that is 2 D Lagrangian implicit, coupled, rigid-viscoplastic. This model is used to investigate the distribution of the main field variables, namely temperature, strain and strain rate, as well as the Zener-Hollomon parameter which, in turn, strongly affects the Continuous Dynamic Recrystallization (CDRX) process that takes place in the weld nugget. Numerical and experimental results are presented showing the effects of the process parameters on the joint performances and the mechanical effectiveness of the modified process...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} process {{parameters}} on vertical forces and temperatures developed during {{friction stir welding}} of AZ 31 magnesium alloy sheets was widely investigated. To this end, FSW experiments were carried out with constant values of the rotational and welding speeds in the ranges from 1200 to 2500 rpm, and from 30 to 100 mm/min, respectively. The influence of the time {{between the end of}} the <b>sinking</b> <b>stage</b> {{and the beginning of the}} welding one was also studied using dwelling time values ranging from 0 to 120 s. Vertical forces occurring during all stages of friction stir welding were measured using a low-cost dynamometer developed by authors. Furthermore, temperatures in different positions of the welding line were monitored by means of K-type thermocouples. It was shown that during the dwelling stage the vertical force decreases until a steady state regime is reached. However, the dwelling time does not significantly affect the force value in the welding stage. The vertical force vs. time curve promptly reaches a steady state during the welding stage. The force value rises with increasing welding speed and decreasing rotational speed; such effect is consistent with the one showed by rotational and welding speeds on temperature measured in different positions during FSW. Finally, forces and temperatures have been related to the mechanical properties of the joints. It was shown that both the ultimate tensile strength and ultimate elongation exhibit the highest values under the process parameters leading to the lowest vertical force and highest welding temperature...|$|E

40|$|An {{understanding}} of the mechanisms responsible for persistent volcanism can be acquired through the integration of geophysical and geochemical data sets. By interpreting data on micro-gravity, ground deformation and SO 2 flux collected at Masaya Volcano since 1993, {{it is now clear}} that the characteristically cyclical nature of the activity is not driven by intrusion of additional magma into the system. Rather, it may be due in large part to the blocking and accumulation of gas by restrictions in the volcano substructure. The history of crater collapse and formation of caverns beneath the crater floor would greatly facilitate the trapping and storage of gas in a zone immediately beneath San Pedro and the other craters. Another mechanism that may explain the observed gravity and gas flux variations is the convective overturn of shallow, pre-existing, degassed, cooled, dense magma that is replaced periodically by lower density, hot, gas-rich magma from depth. Buoyant gas-rich magma rises from depth and is emplaced near the surface, resulting in the formation and fluctuation of a low-density gas-rich layer centred beneath Nindirí and Santiago craters. As this magma vigorously degasses, it must cool, increase in density and eventually <b>sink.</b> Five <b>stages</b> of activity have been identified at Masaya since 1853 and the most recent data suggest that the system may have been entering another period of reduced degassing in 2000. This type of analysis has important implications for hazard mitigation because periods of intense degassing are associated with poor agricultural yields and reduced quality of life. A better {{understanding of}} persistent cyclically active volcanoes will allow for more effective planning of urban development and agricultural land use...|$|R
60|$|The cool {{voice of}} his {{companion}} cut in upon his monologue, calling {{to him from}} a little farther along the cliff, {{to tell him that}} he had found the ladder of descent. It began as a steep and somewhat greasy path, which then tumbled down twenty or thirty feet {{in the form of a}} fall of rough stone steps. After that, there was a rather awkward drop on to a ledge of stone and then the journey was undertaken easily and even elegantly by the remains of an ornamental staircase, such as might have belonged to some long-disused watering-place. All the time that the two travellers <b>sank</b> from <b>stage</b> to stage of this downward journey, there closed over their heads living bridges and caverns of the most varied foliage, all of which grew greener, redder, or more golden, in the growing sunlight of the morning.

Other birds were shaken up in great clouds from the tree-tops, as if they were blossoms detached and scattered up to heaven. Animals which Turnbull was too much of a Londoner and MacIan too much of a Northerner to know, slipped by among the tangle or ran pattering up the tree-trunks.

It was down this clamorous ladder of life that they went down to die.|$|R
40|$|Mr. NISHIMURA {{has pointed}} out in his report that we have become able to know {{underwater}} distribution of tunas. The author on board the Nagasaki-Maru engaged in tuna long-line fishing in the South China Sea and in the waters off the Palau Is., in January, June and December 1961. The author tried to record the underwater formation of the long-line {{by means of the}} fish finder obtaining succcessful records as shown in PL. Ⅲ-Fig. 1 in June and analysable dater in December for the first time. Using those records in December, the author calculated the resistance of water against the long-line. From the result of calculation, the author believes that the echo-sounding is the most reliable method to verify the underwater formation of long-line and the distribution of tuna. The available range of the fish-finder, however, is rather limited, and the long-line can not be recorded in many cases by it as the long-line is often moved out of the signal range by currents and other factors, especially on rough sea. Factors affecting the depth of hooks 1. Design of the long-line, the longer the main line, branch lines and float lines are designed, the deeper the hooks sink. 2. Amount of slack allowed during setting-down of line, The larger the distances between each buoy become, the deeper the hooks sink. 3. Effects of current and wind, The stronger the current and wind flow, the shallower the hooks become. Variation of hook-depth after setting-down of line ﻿Fig. 1 is the diagrm in which those records show the <b>sinking</b> <b>stages</b> of the deepest part of main line. Half an hour after setting-down of long-line, the main line usually sinks to a maximum catenary depth of 100 m, and after one hour, it becomes perfectly balanced. Theoretical diagram of vertical distribution of the gear 1. In case of no effect from current and wind According to reports by YOSHIHARA (1951), MORITA (1955), HAMURO and ISHII (1961) and J. J. GRAHAM (1958), they have all agreeded thet the underwater condition of tuna long-line indicates a catenary curve with any effect from external force. Fig. 2 shows the scale graph of a tuna long-line used by the Nagasaki-Maru. The condition of the main line differs according to the distance between buoys. The actual hook-depth is equal to the sum of the values of the branch line setting-point, length of buoy line and the branch line, i. e., y=a. cosh・x/a, 1 / 2 of total length of main line= 1 / 2 of buoy distances+(1 / 2 buoy dist.) 3 / 6 a 2 2. In case of effect from current and wind a) External force from horizontal right angle direction to the buoy formation is shown in Fig. 3, i. e., y=(buoy line length+a• cosh•-x/a-a) cosθ θ: the heeling angle of long line under effect of external force b) External force from longitudinal direction of the buoy formation is shown in Fig. 4. In any case, the long line always draws a catenary curve and no any other type of curve. Analysis of fish-finder records 1. From the result of analysis conducted in December 3 1961 in the waters off the Palau Is., the author found the amount of external force against long-line in the water. As shown in Fig. 5 and PL IV-Fig. 4, the long-line has been affected by an external force from horizontal right angle direction to the buoy formation. In this case, the speed of external force is 0. 2 kuot. 2. As shown in Fig. 6 and PL. in-Fig. 2, the long-line has been affected by an external force from longitudinal direction to the buoy formation. In this case, the speed of external force is 0. 26 knot...|$|R

Macroscopic tendril development is subdivided based on thigmotropic capacity. Stage I is the elongation stage and, although {{the rate of}} photosynthesis {{is similar to that}} of stage II and III tendrils, dark respiration rates are higher in stage I.

Only stage III tendrils act as sources of newly fixed carbon. Export from them is blocked by cold, heat girdling of the petiole, or anoxia treatment of the tendrils. A late stage II tendril complex, in which coiling is occurring, may be exporting photoassimilates; however, this phenomenon can be attributed to the fact that the pea leaf is a compound structure and there may be one or more stage III tendrils, no longer thigmotropic, within the tendril complex. Photosynthetic maturity in pea tendrils occurs at stage III and is characterized by the ability of these tendrils to export photoassimilates...|$|R

This will be accomplished using a 3 -stage adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator (ADR). The design is dictated {{by the need to}} operate with full redundancy with both a superfluid helium dewar at 1. 3 K or below, and with a 4. 5 K Joule-Thomson (JT) cooler. The ADR is configured as a 2 -stage unit that is located in a well in the helium tank, and a third stage that is mounted {{to the top of the}} helium tank.

40|$|Much of {{the most}} {{interesting}} information regarding our universe is hidden in the sub-millimeter, infrared, and x-rays bands of the spectrum, to which our atmosphere is largely opaque. Thus, missions exploring these bands are {{a very important part of}} NASA s Space Science program. Coincidentally, the most sensitive detectors in these spectral regions operate at extremely low temperatures, typically 0. 05 - 0. 10 K. Generally these temperatures will be achieved using magnetic refrigerators, also know as Adiabatic Demagnetization Refrigerators, or ADRs. Current ADRs, such as the one used in the XRS-II instrument on the Astro-E 2 satellite, use a single-stage to cool detectors from 1. 3 K to 0. 06 K. The ADR is designed so that it can absorb the heat on the detector stage for at least 24 hours before it must stop, warm up to the helium bath temperature (1. 3 K), and dump the accumulated heat. Future detector arrays will be much larger and will have higher heat dissipation. Furthermore, future missions will use mechanical cryocoolers to provide upper stage cooling, but they can only reach 4 - 10 K. Trying to scale heavy (- 15 kg) single stage ADRs up to the higher heat loads and higher heat rejection temperatures required leads to unacceptably large systems. The GSFC Cryogenics Branch has developed the Continuous ADR (CADR) to solve this problem. The CADR consists of a series of ADR stages that sequentially pass heat from the load up to the high temperature heat <b>sink.</b> The <b>stage</b> connected to the load remains at a constant temperature. The continuous stage effectively decouples detector operation from ADR operation, allowing the ADR stages to be cycled much more rapidly. Rapid cycling leads to higher cooling power density. The cascading, multistage arrangement allows the magnetic refrigerant of each stage to be optimized for its own temperature swing. In the past year, we have made good progress toward a 0. 05 to 10 K system. A four-stage system that operates from 4. 2 K was demonstrated. Magnetic shielding was added to eliminate inter-stage coupling. Improvements were made to superconducting and passive gas-gap heat switches. A second type of passive gas gap switch, one meant for use at higher temperature, was demonstrated. The presentation will focus primarily on these recent design improvements, and on the challenges that remain on the progress toward a system that will operate from 10 K or higher...|$|R

[...] Old questions these, which the sprightly critic justly condemns as morbid and futile, and not to be dangled before a merry world of make-believe. Perhaps he is right.

40|$|Growth and {{physiological}} characters of Avicennia marina seedlings cultured under {{different levels of}} salinity were compared at 45 and 100 days after sowing. Based on the growth {{and physiological}} responses, the levels of salinity were grouped into two kinds, moderate (5 - 30 parts per thousand) and extreme (40 and 50 parts per thousand as well as 0 parts per thousand). Root and shoot length, leaf area, biomass of different organs, and net photosynthesis rate all showed a similar trend: the seedlings grew better at moderate levels of salinity but were adversely affected by extreme levels. Longer exposure (100 days) to salinity markedly enhanced {{the difference between the}} effects of the two levels on growth. By 45 th day, the cotyledons had withered and fallen off. The concentration of ions (K+, Na+, Ca+, Mg 2 +, Cl-) and ash content of the cotyledons were determined before sowing and 45 days later. Ion concentrations and ash content of cotyledons were markedly lower at 45 days-lower than the initial levels-in seedlings irrigated with water at 0 parts per thousand salinity level. This suggested that the poor growth of these seedlings at 100 days may be due to lack of ions provided by the cotyledons. The high ion concentrations in the cotyledons grown at moderate salinity levels suggest that these organs may function as ion <b>sinks</b> at this <b>stage,</b> reducing the concentration of ions and consequent toxicity caused by excessive concentrations. Root biomass was higher than shoot biomass 45 days after sowing, whereas after 100 days, shoot biomass was higher. At the early stage of growth (45 days), the rate of photosynthesis at lower levels of salinity (0 - 30 parts per thousand) was limited mainly by stomatal closure but at higher levels of salinity (40 - 50 parts per thousand), other factors came into play. Later, at 100 days, the causes of reduced photosynthetic rate were other than stomatal closure at both low and high levels of salinity. This indicates that photosynthesis is affected by prolonged exposure to salt stress-including that caused by 0 parts per thousand salinity, as shown by poor growth of the seedlings...|$|R

The present investigations {{were carried out}} to find out interactive effect of square/fruiting branch removal in Bt cotton cultivar IR- 3701 using different nitrogen and potassium doses. Two experiments were planted during 2011 and repeated during 2012 at the Agronomic Research Area, University of Agriculture Faisalabad. First experiment comprised of manual alteration of plant architecture i. e. F 1 : no fruiting branch removal, F 2 : removal of first fruiting branch, F 3 : removal of first and second fruiting branch, F 4 :removal of all squares (floral bud) from first fruiting branch, F 5 : removal of all squares from first and second fruiting branch; and three nitrogen rates i. e. N 1 : 175, N 2 : 225 and N 3 : 275 kg ha- 1. Removal of first and second fruiting branch and removal of all squares from first and second fruiting branch along with increasing nitrogen dose improved yield, yield components and quality of cotton as well as helped in delayed onset of senescence and in increasing Cry 1 Ac concentration in boll pericarp; but {{on the basis of}} marginal rate of return, removal of first and second fruiting branch with medium level of nitrogen application (225 kg N ha- 1) was the best treatment combination.

40|$|Common {{measures}} of egg quality have been survival to specific developmental stages, higher hatching rate of fertilized eggs and final production of fry. Determinants of egg quality are variable among and between teleost species and no common unified criteria have been established. Maternally inherited genes influence egg quality and early embryo development is partially programmed by the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA). Among the genes, the insulin family {{is important for}} growth functions {{and the presence of}} their transcripts in the ovary, oocytes and embryos implies their involvement during the reproductive process and their relevance to egg quality. The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system has three components, the ligands IGF-I and II, the IGFBPs (insulin-like growth factor binding proteins) and the IGF receptors that mediate biological activity of the ligands. Vitellogenin (Vtg) is the major source of nutrients for the developing embryo and elevated levels in female fish plasma signals gonadal development preceding spawning. In oviparous fish where the developing embryo is dependent on the stored food in the yolk, vitellogenin levels in the egg could indicate its capability to support embryonic growth. This study aimed to develop molecular tools, specifically probes for IGF-I, IGF-II and IGF-IR, for the evaluation of fish egg quality. These probes would be used to determine expression levels of IGF-I, IGF-II and IGF-IR during egg development to assess their potential as molecular indicators for egg quality. In addition, this study also aimed to establish an enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) for quantifying Vtg in fish eggs and determine if differences in Vtg levels could be linked to fertilization and hatching success. Through reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) putative complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) fragments of IGF-I, IGF-II and IGF-IR were cloned and sequenced from mullet (Mugil cephalus) and grouper (Epinephelus coioides). The relative expression ratio of the three genes in the eggs of mullet and grouper were assayed by quantitative PCR (QPCR) and calculated using the Pfaffl method (Pfaffl, 2001). Levels of vitellogenin in different batches of mullet eggs were quantified by ELISA. Spawned eggs of grouper were grouped into low (60 %) fertilization rate (FR) and the fertilized eggs that were incubated until hatching were grouped into medium (> 90 %) or high (> 90 %) hatching rate (HR). Samples were categorized into sinking eggs, late embryo and hatched larvae. Relative expression ratio of IGF-II was significantly high (P< 0. 01) compared to IGF-I and IGF-IR in all samples examined. All three genes were strongly expressed in sinking eggs compared to either late embryo or hatched larvae. However, there was no significant interaction effect between the genes and the samples analyzed. Mullet samples all came from a high FR and high HR group and were categorized into <b>sinking,</b> multicell <b>stage,</b> blastula, gastrula, late embryo and hatched larvae. There was a significant interaction effect (P< 0. 01) between gene and stage, showing that genes are differentially expressed during embryonic development. IGF-II was strongly expressed relative to the other genes in all stages examined and was highest during the gastrula stage. Vtg levels were examined in mullet oocytes and egg samples that were grouped into 4; oocytes from females that subsequently spawned, had fertilized eggs which hatched (Group A); oocytes from females that did not spawn, therefore no fertilization and no hatching (Group B); eggs that were stripped, artificially fertilized but no hatching (Group C); and eggs that were spawned, assumed to be fertilized but did not hatch (Group D). Group A showed a trend of higher Vtg levels than the other three but this result was not statistically significant...|$|R
