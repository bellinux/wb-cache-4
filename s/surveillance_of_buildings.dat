40|$|Abstract Micro aerial vehicles, such as multirotors, are {{particular}} {{well suited}} for the autonomous monitoring, inspection, and <b>surveillance</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings,</b> e. g., for main-tenance in industrial plants. Key prerequisites for the fully autonomous operation of micro aerial vehicles in restricted environments are 3 D mapping, real-time pose tracking, obstacle detection, and planning of collision-free trajectories. In this arti-cle, we propose a complete navigation system with a multimodal sensor setup for omnidirectional environment perception. Measurements of a 3 D laser scanner are aggregated in egocentric local multiresolution grid maps. Local maps are registered and merged to allocentric maps in which the MAV localizes. For autonomous navi-gation, we generate trajectories in a multi-layered approach: from mission planning over global and local trajectory planning to reactive obstacle avoidance. We evaluate our approach in a GNSS-denied indoor environment where multiple collision hazards require reliable omnidirectional perception and quick navigation reactions.

40|$|Abstract—This work {{focuses on}} the problem of patrolling an {{environment}} with a team of autonomous agents. Given a set of strategically important locations (viewpoints) with different priorities, our patrolling strategy consists of (i) constructing a tour through the viewpoints, and (ii) driving the robots along the tour in a coordinated way. As performance criteria, we consider the weighted refresh time, i. e., the longest time interval between any two visits of a viewpoint, weighted by the viewpoint’s priority. We consider the design of both optimal trajectories and distributed control laws for the robots to converge to optimal trajectories. First, we propose a patrolling strategy and we characterize its performance {{as a function of the}} environment and the viewpoints priorities. Second, we restrict our attention to the problem of patrolling a non-intersecting tour, and we describe a team trajectory with minimum weighted refresh time. Third, for the tour patrolling problem and for two distinct communication scenarios, namely the Passing and the Neighbor-Broadcast communication models, we develop distributed algorithms to steer the robots towards a minimum weighted refresh time team trajectory. Finally, we show the effectiveness and robustness of our control algorithms via simulations and experiments. Fig. 1. This figure represents a part of the UCSB campus. For the <b>surveillance</b> <b>of</b> the <b>buildings</b> in the map by a team of autonomous robots, a set of 35 important locations (viewpoints) has been identified, and a tour through the viewpoints has been computed. The robots repeatedly patrol the tour to guarantee complete and persistent <b>surveillance</b> <b>of</b> the <b>buildings.</b> We propose the Equal-Time-Spacing trajectory, which minimizes the longest priorityweighted time gap between any two visits of the same viewpoint.

40|$|International audiencePattern mining over data streams is {{critical}} {{to a variety of}} applications such as understanding and predicting weather phenomena or outdoor <b>surveillance.</b> Most <b>of</b> the current techniques attempt to discover relationships between time-point events but are not practical for discovering dependencies over interval-based events. In this work, we present a new approach to mine dependencies between streams of interval-basedevents that links two events if they occur in a similar manner, one being often followed by the other one after a certain time interval in thedata. The proposed method is robust to temporal variability of events and determines the most appropriate time intervals whose validity is assessed by a Chi 2 test. As several intervals may redundantly describe the same dependency, the approach retrieves only the most specic intervals with respect to a dominance relationship over temporal dependencies, and thus avoids the classical problem of pattern flooding in data mining. The TEDDY algorithm, TEmporal Dependency DiscoverY, prunes the search space while guaranteeing the discovery of all valid and significant temporal dependencies. We present empirical results on simulated and real-life data to show the scalability and the robustness of our approach. Thedependency relationships define a graph that supports intelligent analysis as illustrated by two case studies: Outdoor <b>surveillance</b> <b>of</b> a <b>building</b> viavideo camera and motion sensors, and assistance for road deicing operations based on the humidity and temperature measurements at the urbanscale.

When presented with an unseen viewpoint (target domain), closely related models in the source domain are selected for detection based on a novel discriminatively trained distance metric function, which takes into account scene geometry, vehicle motion patterns, and the generalizing ability of the models. Extensive experimental evaluation on a challenging test set, consisting of images collected from fifty different surveillance cameras, demonstrates that our unsupervised approach can outperform complex methods that utilize labeled training data from the target domain, {{both in terms of}} speed as well as accuracy. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of WSNs, the RSSI has been {{traditionally}} exploited for localization, distance estimation, and link quality assessment. Recent {{research has shown that}} variations of the signal strength in indoor environments where nodes have been deployed can reveal movements of persons. Moreover, the time-histories of the RSSI over multiple links allow reconstructing the paths followed by the persons in the monitored area. This approach, though effective, requires the transmission of multiple entire RSSI time-histories to a sink where the signals are processed, increasing latency and power consumption. This work aims at applying distributed processing of the RSSI signals for indoor surveillance purposes. Through distributed processing, the nodes are able to autonomously detect and localize moving persons. The latency and power consumption of the proposed intrusion detection system is minimized by transmitting to the sink only the alert notifications raised by significant events. Moreover, an accurate time-synchronization allows the nodes to keep the radio off most of the time. The proposed system was able to detect the intrusion of a walking person inside the monitored area, and to correctly keep track of the path he had followed. Possible applications of such a system include <b>surveillance</b> <b>of</b> critical <b>buildings,</b> support to emergency workers in locating people e. g. during fires and earthquakes, and to police in hostage situations or terrorist attacks. 1...|$|R
