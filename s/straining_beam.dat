40|$|A {{comparison}} of strain measurement results, from an embedded fibre-optic Bragg grating (FBG) sensor and surface mounted strain gauge, at different vibration frequency ranges {{and using a}} clamped-clamped glass fibre composite beam, is presented. It is shown that the FBG sensor is able to precisely measure the peaks at the first-two natural frequency modes compared with the spectrum captured from the strain gauge. The results also demonstrate that the strains measured from the FBG sensor agreed well with the strain gauge at frequencies below 100 Hz. Beyond this value, the actual <b>strain</b> on the <b>beam</b> surface was less than 3 mu epsilon, and the data extracted from the strain gauge are no longer valid. For a clamped-clamped structure, the longitudinal <b>strain</b> of the <b>beam</b> correlates to its vibration amplitude and excitation frequency. Increasing the frequency results in decreasing the longitudinal <b>strain</b> of the <b>beam</b> and erroneous measurements from the strain gauge resulted. This study provides important information on the feasibility of using embedded FBG sensors as vibration monitoring devices to measure mechanical performance of composite structures...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} based on the merger of two {{separate}} theories to further the efficiency with which joined-wing structural models are designed. The first theory is Geometrically Exact Beam Theory (GEBT). GEBT is a small <b>strain</b> <b>beam</b> theory which is capable of accurately capturing the geometric bend-twist coupling in beam elements. This is cruicial to the joined-wing problem as it is geometrically nonlinear. The second theory concerns Equivalent Static Loads (ESL). These ESL consist of a load vector that produces the same nodal displacements and rotations as those computed from a pure nonlinear analysis. The ESL displacements and rotations are then used to calculate ESL stresses. By merging these two theories into a single structural optimization effort, computational cost is reduced by orders of magnitude when compared to purely nonlinear analysis. The final design obtained by the optimization is the same for both types of analysis. The final result is a much simpler model than a detailed finite element model of the joined-wing aircraft that can be optimized without significant loss in fidelity in a fraction of the time required for a single optimization cycle using finite element analysis.

In addition, adopting three rectangular curvature blocks facilitates the integration of curvatures, as this concept assumes the distribution of constant <b>strain</b> at <b>beam</b> sections within a block along the beam span.|$|R
40|$|A {{finite element}} {{approach}} to the mechanical behaviour of braided ropes at the scale of their internal components is proposed in this paper. The ropes considered are composed of a few tens of textile yarns, twisted into strands, which are then braided together. The approach aims at determining the mechanical equilibrium of such structures, viewed as assemblies of yarns undergoing large displacements and developing contact-friction interactions. To solve this equilibrium within a quasi-static framework, and using an implicit solution scheme, each yarn of the rope is represented by a finite <b>strain</b> <b>beam</b> model, and special emphasis is put on the detection and modelling of contact-friction interactions between yarns. The approach is used first to determine the unknown initial configuration of the rope, starting from an arbitrary configuration and using contact interactions together with information from the selected braid pattern, to determine the braided structure as the solution of a mechanical equilibrium. Comparisons are made with experimental data on this initial geometry. Tensile test experiments were performed to characterize the mechanical response of both the elementary yarns and the braided rope. These tests were simulated with the model, and results are compared with experiment. Sensitivity analyses on design parameters showing the abilities of the model are reported...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the influences of}} modelling assumptions on the dynamic behaviour of collapsible channel flows. The elastic wall is modelled in various different ways: as a large <b>strain</b> Bernoulli–Euler <b>beam,</b> as a small <b>strain</b> Timoshenko <b>beam,</b> and as a 2 D-solid model derived from a general virtual work approach, using small strain or large strain assumptions. Different inlet boundary conditions are also considered. The in-house finite element codes and the commercial finite element package ADINA 8. 4 are used. The steady results agree very well when using the different models/approaches. The unsteady results, on the other hand, can be quite different. The dynamic behaviour {{of the system is}} analysed for a set of chosen parameters, using the full numerical solvers, the linear stability analysis, and the Fourier transform. It is found that the system stability is highly sensitive to the solid modelling assumptions used, numerical solvers adopted, or the boundary conditions imposed. Accuracy of the numerical schemes also has an impact on the system’s unsteady behaviour. However, despite the high sensitivity of the unsteady solutions to the modelling assumptions, a cascade stability structure previously revealed by the authors seems to exist when different numerical approaches are used.

40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} we propose a finite element {{approach}} which simulates the mechanical behaviour of beam assemblies that are subject to large deformations and that develop contact-friction interactions. We focus on detecting and modeling contact-friction interactions within the assembly of beams. Contact between beams [...] or between parts of the same beam in the case of self-contact, is detected from intermediate geometries defined within proximity zones associating close parts of beam axes. The discretization of contact-friction interactions is performed on these intermediate geometries by means of contact elements, constituted of pairs of material particles which are predicted to enter into contact. A 3 D finite <b>strain</b> <b>beam</b> model is used to represent the behaviour of each beam. This model describes the kinematics of each beam cross-section using nine degrees of freedom, and is therefore able to represent plane deformations of these cross-sections. Algorithms are proposed to solve the global nonlinear problem using an implicit scheme, under quasi-static assumptions. Simulation results of the tightening and releasing of knots made on monofilament and multifilament yarns are shown as an application. Straight fibers are first twisted together to make a yarn, before suitable conditions are applied to their ends to form and tighten the knot. Tightening forces are finally released to obtain an equilibrium configuration of the knot without external forces...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental campaign carried out to investigate the behavior of reinforced concrete (RC) beams strengthened in shear with externally bonded composites. Two different types of composites were studied: Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) and Fiber Reinforced Cementitious Matrix (FRCM) composites. In addition, different types of fiber (carbon and steel) were employed, and the influence of internal transverse steel reinforcement ratio and the presence of composite anchors were investigated. Internal-external shear reinforcement interaction, i. e. reduction of the stirrup strain due to the presence of the composite, was observed for both FRP and FRCM strengthened beams, but the inter- action was less pronounced for those with FRCM composites. The anchors employed in this study did not affect the shear strength of the beams, but changes in the concrete crack pattern, mid-span displacement, and failure mode were observed. For FRCM strengthened <b>beams,</b> <b>strains</b> measured in the fibers showed higher exploitation ratios, i. e. the ratio between the maximum measured fiber strain and the rupture <b>strain,</b> for <b>beams</b> with carbon FRCM than those with steel FRCM.

40|$|An {{instrument}} {{to measure the}} momentum flux (total pressure) of plasma and neutral particle jets onto a surface has been developed. While this instrument was developed for magnetized plasmas, the concept works for non-magnetized plasmas as well. We have measured forces as small as 10 (exp - 4) Newtons on a surface immersed in the plasma where small forces are due to ionic and neutral particles with kinetic energies {{on the order of}} a few eV impacting the surface. This instrument, a force sensor, uses a target plate (surface) that is immersed in the plasma and connected to one end of an alumina rod while {{the opposite end of the}} alumina rod is mechanically connected to a titanium beam on which four strain gauges are mounted. The force on the target generates torque causing <b>strain</b> in the <b>beam.</b> The resulting <b>strain</b> measurements can be correlated to a force on the target plate. The alumina rod electrically and thermally isolates the target plate from the <b>strain</b> gauge <b>beam</b> and allows the strain gauges to be located out of the plasma flow while also serving as a moment arm of several inches to increase the <b>strain</b> in the <b>beam</b> at the <b>strain</b> gauge location. These force measurements correspond directly to momentum flux and may be used with known plasma conditions to place boundaries on the kinetic energies of the plasma and neutral particles. The force measurements may also be used to infer thrust produced by a plasma propulsive device. Stainless steel, titanium, molybdenum, and aluminum flat target plates have been used.

40|$|Indium-tin-oxide (ITO) {{thin film}} strain gages were {{successfully}} demonstrated at temperatures beyond 1500 C. High temperature static strain tests {{revealed that the}} piezoresistive response and electrical stability of the ceramic sensors depended on {{the thickness of the}} ITO films comprising the active strain elements. When 2. 5 microns-thick ITO films were employed as the active strain elements, the piezoresistive response became unstable at temperatures above 1225 C. In contrast to this, ceramic sensors prepared with 5 microns-thick ITO were stable beyond 1430 C and sensors prepared with 8 microns-thick ITO survived more than 20 hr of operation at 1481 C. Very thick (10 microns) ITo strain gages were extremely stable and responsive at 1528 C. ESCA depth profiles confirmed that an interfacial reaction between the ITO strain gage and alumina substrate was responsible for the high temperature electrical stability observed. Similar improvements in high temperature stability were achieved by doping the active ITO strain elements with aluminum. Several Sic-Sic CMC constant <b>strain</b> <b>beams</b> were instrumented with ITO strain gages and delivered to NASA for testing. Due to the extreme surface roughness of the CMC substrates, new lithography techniques and surface preparation methods were developed. These techniques relied heavily on a combination of Sic and A 12 O 3 cement layers to provide the necessary surface finish for efficient pattern transfer. Micro-contact printing using soft lithography and PDMS stamps was also used to successfully transfer the thin film strain gage patterns to the resist coated CMC substrates.
