5|$|From Boston, Edwards {{moved to}} New York {{to stay for}} some ten years, {{performing}} on stage and participating in insect studies.

Papilio was published until 1885 when its subscription base was merged into the more general Entomologia Americana, published by the Brooklyn Entomological Society.|$|E
5|$|Near the Congo River {{a female}} who participates in strong {{emotional}} or sexual relationships with another female among the Nkundo people {{is known as}} yaikya bonsángo (a woman who presses against another woman). Lesbian relationships are also known in matrilineal <b>societies</b> <b>in</b> Ghana among the Akan people. In Lesotho, females engage in what is commonly considered sexual behavior to the Western world: they kiss, sleep together, rub genitals, participate in cunnilingus, and maintain their relationships with other females vigilantly. Since the people of Lesotho believe sex requires a penis, however, they do not consider their behavior sexual, nor label themselves lesbians.|$|E
5|$|Social {{anthropology}} is {{the branch}} of anthropology that studies how contemporary living human beings behave in social groups. Practitioners of social anthropology, like sociologists, investigate various facets of social organization. Traditionally, social anthropologists analysed non-industrial and non-Western societies, whereas sociologists focused on industrialized <b>societies</b> <b>in</b> the Western world. In recent years, however, social anthropology has expanded its focus to modern Western societies, meaning that the two disciplines increasingly converge.|$|E

5|$|The Order of the Torch is a semi-secret honorary {{leadership}} society akin {{to other}} secret <b>societies</b> <b>in</b> the state such as Florida Blue Key at the University of Florida, and the Iron Arrow Honor Society at the University of Miami.

Members now include students, faculty, staff and community members, including FIU alumni Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Alvarez (class of 1974). Top leadership in Student Government, Homecoming, and the most elite campus fraternal organizations, rank among its members.|$|E
5|$|The {{declaration}} spurred {{an unintended}} and extraordinary {{increase in the}} number of adherents of American Zionism; in 1914 the 200 American Zionist societies comprised a total of 7,500 members, which grew to 30,000 members in 600 <b>societies</b> <b>in</b> 1918 and 149,000 members in 1919. Whilst the British had considered that the declaration reflected a previously established dominance of the Zionist position in Jewish thought, it was the declaration itself that was subsequently responsible for Zionism's legitimacy and leadership.|$|E

5|$|Yellowhammers of the British and Irish race, E. c. caliginosa were {{introduced}} to New Zealand by local acclimatisation <b>societies</b> <b>in</b> 1862, and soon spread over the main islands. They sometimes visit New Zealand's subantarctic islands, although rarely staying to breed, and have reached Australia's Lord Howe Island {{on a number of}} occasions. At the beginning of the 20th century, this bunting was seen as a serious agricultural pest in its adopted country.|$|E
5|$|After {{more than}} 210years of {{relations}} with the Spanish, both indigenous societies lost cohesiveness. Official records indicate that survivors of war and disease were transported to Havana in the late 18th century. Isolated groups may have been assimilated into the Seminole nation, which formed in northern Florida when a band of Creeks consolidated surviving members of pre-Columbian <b>societies</b> <b>in</b> Florida into their own to become a distinct tribe. Seminoles were forced into the Everglades by the U.S. military during the Seminole Wars from 1835 to 1842. The U.S. military pursued the Seminoles into the region, which resulted {{in some of the}} first recorded explorations of much of the area. Seminoles continue to live in the Everglades region, and support themselves with casino gambling on six reservations located throughout the state.|$|E
5|$|Bears {{have been}} hunted since prehistoric times for their meat and fur; {{they have been}} used for bear-baiting and other forms of entertainment, such as being made to dance. With their {{powerful}} physical presence, they play a prominent role in the arts, mythology, and other cultural aspects of various human <b>societies.</b> <b>In</b> modern times, bears have come under pressure through encroachment on their habitats and illegal trade in bear parts, including the Asian bile bear market. The IUCN lists six bear species as vulnerable or endangered, and even least concern species, such as the brown bear, are at risk of extirpation in certain countries. The poaching and international trade of these most threatened populations are prohibited, but still ongoing.|$|E

5|$|Caligari had its Los Angeles premiere at Miller's Theater on 7 May 1921, but {{the theatre}} {{was forced to}} pull it due to demonstrations by protestors. However, the protest was {{organized}} by the Hollywood branch of the American Legion due to fears of unemployment stemming from the import of German films into America, not over objections {{to the content of}} Caligari itself. After running in large commercial theatres, Caligari began to be shown in smaller theatres and film <b>societies</b> <b>in</b> major cities. Box office figures were not regularly published in the 1920s, so it has been difficult to assess the commercial success or failure of Caligari in the United States. Film historians Kristin Thompson and David B. Pratt separately studied trade publications from the time in an attempt to make a determination, but reached conflicting findings; with Thompson concluding it was a box office success and Pratt concluding it was a failure. However, both agreed it was more commercially successful in major cities than in theatres in smaller communities, where tastes were considered more conservative.|$|E
5|$|Despite declining health, Vivekananda {{left for}} the West {{for a second time}} in June 1899 {{accompanied}} by Sister Nivedita and Swami Turiyananda. Following a brief stay in England, he went to the United States. During this visit, Vivekananda established Vedanta <b>Societies</b> <b>in</b> San Francisco and New York and founded a shanti ashrama (peace retreat) in California. He then went to Paris for the Congress of Religions in 1900. His lectures in Paris concerned the worship of the lingam and the authenticity of the Bhagavad Gita. Vivekananda then visited Brittany, Vienna, Istanbul, Athens and Egypt. The French philosopher Jules Bois was his host for most of this period, until he returned to Calcutta on 9 December 1900.|$|E
5|$|Governments and {{conservation}} groups work to protect birds, either by passing laws that preserve and restore bird habitat, or by establishing captive populations for reintroductions. Such projects have produced some successes; one study estimated that conservation efforts saved 16 species of bird {{that would otherwise}} have gone extinct between 1994 and 2004, including the California condor and Norfolk parakeet. The British Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, founded as the Plumage League in 1889 to protect birds such as the egret from hunting for their plumes, used in fashion, has grown to have over a million members; it has been followed by similar <b>societies</b> <b>in</b> other countries. A more specialised organisation, the Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust, works to conserve waterfowl and their wetland habitats, with projects around the world.|$|E
