40|$|In {{order to}} allow an {{efficient}} energy recovery from off-gas in the steel industry, the high variability of heat flow should be managed. A temperature smoothing device based on phase change materials at high temperatures is inserted into the off-gas line of a continuous charge electric arc furnace process with <b>scrap</b> <b>preheating.</b> To address overheating issues, a heat transfer fluid flowing through containers is introduced and selected by developing an analytical model. The performance of the smoothing system is analyzed by thermo-fluid dynamic simulations. The reduced maximum temperature of off-gas allows {{to reduce the size}} and investment cost of the downstream energy recovery system, while the increased minimum temperature enhances the steam turbine load factor, thus increasing its utilization. Benefits on environmental issues due to dioxins generation are also gained...|$|E
40|$|In {{electric}} arc furnace steelmaking units, the essential parameters that considered important are reducing price, increasing production and decreasing environmental pollution. Electric arc furnaces are the largest users of electric energy in industry. The most important techniques {{that can be used}} to reduce the electric energy consumption in {{electric arc}} furnaces are <b>scrap</b> <b>preheating,</b> stirring, use of burners and hot charge and foamy slag. Between these methods, use of foamy slag is the most useful and economic factor. Foamy slag can reduce the amount of energy, electrods, refractory consumption, tap to tap time and increases productivity. In this research, method of production and optimum conditions for foamy slag in 200 tons {{electric arc furnace}} were investigated. The use of foamy slag in this research shows that it can reduce the electric energy consumption from 670 to 580 kwh/ton and also the melting time from 130 to 115 min. and the electric power input can be increase with foamy slag. It also shows that with foamy slag the optimum amount of FeO in slag is 20 - 24 percent and the optimum basicity is 2 - 2. 2...|$|E
40|$|The Bureau of Mines {{investigated}} preheating of continuously fed, fragmented {{ferrous scrap}} charges by furnace offgases and utilizing substitutes for imported fluorspar to condition electric steelmaking slags. Three types of continuous scrap charging procedures were investigated to determine electrical energy consumption in a I-st (short ton) electric arc furnace. Cold and preheated scrap charges were continuously fed at rates averaging 37. 5 and 43. 7 lb/min, respectively. The feed rate varied appreciably from test to test owing to hangup of the scrap in the charge bin. Approximately 7 pct less electrical energy was consumed in melting scrap preheated to 8400 to 1, 1100 F by furnace off-gases than in melting cold scrap. Overall energy consumptions were 888 kW'h/st for cold scrap, 829 kW'h/st for preheated scrap" and 637 kW'h/st for conventional backcharged scrap. Stack gases from <b>scrap</b> <b>preheating</b> averaged 1200 F and a flow rate of 1, 615 scfm compared with 2200 F and 1, 302 sefm for cold-charged scrap. Slag conditioners tested included synthetic fluorspar, boric acid, hydroboracite, used aluminum potlining wastes and aluminum anode tailing wastes, and Sorelflux B. The boron-containing conditioners fluidized the slags the best, followed in order by the conditioners containing fluorine and titanium...|$|E
50|$|Earlier converters, with a {{false bottom}} {{that can be}} {{detached}} and repaired, are still in use. Modern converters have a fixed bottom with plugs for argon purging. The Energy Optimization Furnace is a BOF variant associated with a scrap preheater where the sensible heat in the off-gas is used for <b>preheating</b> <b>scrap,</b> located above the furnace roof.|$|R
40|$|Using {{solar tower}} {{technology}} with ceramic particles as heat transfer and storage medium to <b>preheat</b> <b>scrap</b> for induction furnaces in foundries provides solar generated heat to save electricity. With {{such a system}} an unsubsidized payback time of only 4 years is achieved for a 70000 t/a foundry in Brazil. The same system can be also used for heat treatment of metals. If electricity is used to heat inert atmospheres a favorable economic performance is also achievable for the particle system. The storage in a particle system enables solar boosting to be restricted to only peak times, enabling an interesting business case opportunity...|$|R
5000|$|The furnace {{is built}} on a tilting {{platform}} so that the liquid steel can be poured into another vessel for transport. The operation of tilting the furnace to pour molten steel is called [...] "tapping". Originally, all steelmaking furnaces had a tapping spout closed with refractory that washed out when the furnace was tilted, but often modern furnaces have an eccentric bottom tap-hole (EBT) to reduce inclusion of nitrogen and slag in the liquid steel. These furnaces have a taphole that passes vertically through the hearth and shell, and is set off-centre in the narrow [...] "nose" [...] of the egg-shaped hearth. It is filled with refractory sand, such as olivine, when it is closed off. Modern plants may have two shells with a single set of electrodes that can be transferred between the two; one shell <b>preheats</b> <b>scrap</b> while the other shell is utilised for meltdown. Other DC-based furnaces have a similar arrangement, but have electrodes for each shell and one set of electronics.|$|R
40|$|Utilizing {{electric}} arc smelters for making steel has allowed many smaller manufacturers {{to compete with}} large integrated mills. The {{electric arc}} furnace melts scrap to produce steel. The subject of this report is a Scrap Preheater that heats and cleans the arc furnace scrap using its own low cost natural gas energy supply. <b>Scrap</b> <b>preheating</b> can increase the capacity of a given arc furnace and reduce the operating costs. In addition it reduces the air emissions and allows utilization of lower cost scrap. The program was divided into three phases and was to culminate with an operating prototype at a demonstration host site steel mill. A host site agreement was executed and critical components were tested. The prototype scrap preheater was completely designed. It was sized to preheat 30 tons of scrap in a scrap bucket in 30 minutes. Energy is supplied by a rich fume reactor that completely oxidizes organics from the scrap and auxiliary natural gas. There were several delays {{and changes in the}} project that resulted in the host site requesting to withdraw from the program. Extensive efforts were made to secure a replacement host site. However, when another host could not be found, the project was terminated...|$|E
40|$|Electric {{steelmaking}} {{accounts for}} approximately 35 % {{of the world}} steel production. In the past two decades, {{the increase in the}} proportion of steel made by Mini Mills (Electric Arc Furnace based steelmaking) has been remarkable in North America, Europe and South-East Asia. Over 50 % of the energy used to produce rebar in Mini Mills is electric energy used at the EAF. Off-gas energy losses account for about 22 % of an EAF energy balance (approximately 55 % of total energy losses). The energy recovery potential of the EAF process is high; various technical solutions were devised in the last 40 years in order to utilise off-gas heat to preheat the steel scrap. The increase in energy cost (electrical energy and in particular fossil energy - Carbon Tax) and the increasing raw material cost are demanding actions from steel makers and furnace designers to be able to optimise the conversion cost of the melting operation and increase the productivity of the EAF to gain a competitive edge. In this context, <b>scrap</b> <b>preheating</b> can be helpful in reducing the overall EAF energy consumption. Assuming an average preheating temperature between 400 and 600 &# 0176;C and an overall melting efficiency between 70 and 80 %, energy savings between 80 and 120 kWh per tonne of liquid steel are possible...|$|E
40|$|This thesis explores a {{recently}} developed {{concentrated solar thermal}} (CST) central receiver technology, known as the solid particle receiver (SPR). Calculations of long and near term thermo-economic competitiveness for promising potential applications were preformed, {{for the first time}} within the Australian context. With these results, the most suitable SPR technology configurations and technical developments, required to reach the commercial potential, were identified. An innovative simulation tool which included a variety of different thermodynamic and economic models, was developed to compute the annual performance of solar SPR systems. This simulation tool was then applied to design and to optimise CST SPR tower systems based on hourly simulations utilising meteorological data, the NREL Solar Position Algorithm, solar field efficiency matrices generated by DLR software HFLCAL, as well as a mathematical SPR model for calculating receiver efficiency. The SPR model was calibrated using results from DLR receiver prototype tests. To allow economic assessment of the entire SPR system, a financial model was implemented within the tool and detailed CST component costs were generated. The optimisation process utilised in the CST tower system design is more detailed than typical for a research project, since it adds a new degree of freedom when optimising the receiver and solar field. By decoupling the connection between solar field and receiver, the energy delivered from the solar field relative to the design receiver power becomes an additional optimisation variable. Applications of SPR systems for electricity production and industrial process heat generation have been identified for the Australian market. Promising heat supply uses of SPR technology examined in this thesis were: thermal enhanced oil recovery, <b>preheating</b> <b>scrap</b> metal during steel production, and solar augmentation of coal-fired steam power stations. Before this project, there were no detailed investigations on utilising SPR based CST power plants in Australia. This thesis has identified several potential applications, the required sub-components and system integration methods which should be further developed for commercialisation of this solar technology in the Australian market...|$|R
40|$|The {{kinetics}} {{of scrap}} melting {{is an important}} aspect of EAF steelmaking and {{has been the subject of}} several studies. In EAF steelmaking, there are two distinct melting mechanisms; (i) the melting of scrap by the arc through a combination of radiant and convective heat transfer and (ii) the melting of scrap immersed in a molten steel bath without direct heating from the arc. In traditional EAF steelmaking, the first mechanism dominated the melting process but with the increasing use of 'hot heel' operation and a general trend to utilization of the liquid bath as the melting medium, the second mechanism has become more important. Previous studies have focused on investigating the melting behaviour of single scrap pieces with regular shapes, though Gaye et al. did consider the physics of multi-piece scrap melting. One of the most important aspects of scrap melting in a bath that has received little attention is the agglomeration of scrap pieces even though industrial experience suggests that this is a critical aspect of understanding the kinetics of scrap melting. The effect of <b>preheating</b> <b>scrap,</b> including the formation of oxide layer, on scrap melting kinetics is another area worthy offuture attention. This study is focused on investigating multi-piece scrap melting in liquid steel by both mathematical modeling and high temperature experimentation. The study emphasizes the formation and agglomeration of solidified shells and investigates the effect of size, shape, oxidation and initial scrap temperature on melting behaviour. A new approach for modeling melting behaviour has been developed, the phase field technique, to model convective heat transfer in the case of scrap melting in a bath. The phase field model is able to deal more easily with complex geometry compared to traditional 'sharp interface' heat transfer equations where tracking the interfaces and their interactions is complex. It is expected that from this study a better understanding of scrap melting can be developed and provide insight into how to improve the melting process in an EAF...|$|R
