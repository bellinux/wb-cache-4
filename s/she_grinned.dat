500|$|Jon Pareles of The New York Times {{compared}} the DVD with Taylor Swift's [...] which aired {{as a special}} {{the same day as}} I Am... World Tour. He noted, [...] "Beyoncé's I Am... World Tour placed her before much larger audiences, documenting her choreographed razzle-dazzle as she played arenas and stadiums in 2009-10." [...] He further said, [...] "Beyoncé didn't explain: she performed. With costumes that made her a comic-book heroine, a cyborg, a club hottie, and a white-clad vision of purity, she worked her big stages with hip-pumping moves and a soul diva's voice, from creamy to raspy. The documentary quietly flaunted her consistency as a trouper in montages that segued multiple shows — supertitled in small type — with Beyoncé in the same outfit making the same moves, while the fans' nationalities changed around her. Yet for all her superhuman pep, she also came across as warmer than Ms. Swift. <b>She</b> <b>grinned</b> knowingly after belting a phrase into the bleachers, and she drew listeners into her own pop generalities. Andy Gill of The Independent was much less impressed with the DVD, qualifying it as an [...] "unsatisfying, incoherent entertainment experience" [...] even though she liked the way [...] "the visual spectacle put everything in perspective". The concert film received a nomination for a NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Variety – Series or Special in 2011. I Am... World Tour was nominated in the category for Best Long Form Music Video at the 54th Grammy Awards, held on February 12, 2012.|$|E
60|$|Meerta merely {{smiled to}} the salutation; that in to say, <b>she</b> <b>grinned.</b>|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>grinned</b> as she {{repeated}} and dwelt upon the fatal monosyllable, {{with the emphasis}} of a vindictive fiend.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{young lady}} says the old {{coloured}} woman {{would take them}} a note. I sat down and wrote it, {{and gave it to}} the dame with plain directions what to do, and <b>she</b> <b>grins</b> like a baboon and shakes her head.|$|R
50|$|When {{the doors}} open, Ellen drops her knife and faces the garage. She hears voices ahead {{telling her to}} hold the {{elevator}} open for them, and soon {{a large group of}} people run toward her direction shouting and screaming, fleeing from something behind them, implying that what Hank first told Ellen and Ben was true and monsters were indeed attacking. The people squeeze past Ellen as <b>she</b> <b>grins</b> emptily, implying they will be Ellen's next victims instead.|$|R
60|$|The {{service is}} pretty well {{advanced}} before Mr. Datchery can discern Her Royal Highness. But {{by that time}} he has made her out, in the shade. She is behind a pillar, carefully withdrawn from the Choir-master’s view, but regards him with the closest attention. All unconscious of her presence, he chants and sings. <b>She</b> <b>grins</b> when he is most musically fervid, and—yes, Mr. Datchery sees her do it!—shakes her fist at him behind the pillar’s friendly shelter.|$|R
6000|$|Then <b>she</b> <b>grinned.</b> The {{world was}} rose-colored and hung with tinkling bells. [...] "I love even that Pinky person!" [...] she said. In the yard of the hotel, beside her Gomez, was a Teal bug, {{and two men}} were {{sleeping}} in blankets on the ground.|$|E
6000|$|The {{young man}} was {{grateful}} for these words, and promised to obey them. Then he rode on, and soon reached the castle. He walked boldly {{up the steps and}} entered the hall, where the hideous old witch came to meet him. <b>She</b> <b>grinned</b> horribly at him, and cried out, 'With one hair of my head I can change you into stone.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Hullo, puss,' I says to him, 'and 'ow are you, sir?' 'Be careful,' {{says the}} missis. ''E's that timid,' she says, 'you wouldn't believe,' she says. ''E's only just settled down, {{as you may}} say,' she says. 'Ho, don't you fret,' I says to her, ''im and me understands each other. 'Im and me,' I says, 'is old friends. 'E's my dear old pal, Corporal Banks.' <b>She</b> <b>grinned</b> at that, ma'am, Corporal Banks being a man we'd 'ad many a 'earty laugh at in the old days.

40|$|Photographic {{portrait}} of Lucretia Del Valle de Grady (or Lucretia de Grady Del Valle), ca. 1910 - 1940. She {{can be seen}} from the chest up. She has short dark curled hair and is wearing a fur around her shoulders. <b>She</b> <b>grins</b> with her teeth showing as she looks back over her right shoulder. She is the wife of San Francisco politician Henry Francis Grady (1882 - 1957) who served as a U. S. Ambassador (1947 - 1951). Portrait by A. A. (?) Curtis...|$|R
40|$|Cartoon showing France, {{a savage}} virago, dandling a tiny Napoleon seated {{on her hand}} and wearing a royal robe over his {{military}} dress. Above her head she holds a rattle with bells surmounted by a crown. <b>She</b> <b>grins</b> at the mannikin, singing: [...] . Beside her are her spear, dripping blood, and shield, with the bleeding head of Louis XVI above a reversed crown, with the inscriptions: Vive la Republique and The last of kings.

40|$|Photograph of a Havasupai Indian woman {{grinding}} corn into meal, ca. 1900. She {{is wrapped}} in a brightly patterned blanket or cloth under which she wears a plaid dress. She sits cross-legged {{on the ground with}} her hands on a stone grinding corn on another flat stone. <b>She</b> <b>grins</b> broadly at the camera. At left are two baskets, one tall, the other shallow. At right is a "Kathak", a large conical basket. Wild grass grows behind her. In the background is the canyon wall (blurred), cast in shadow...|$|R
60|$|When he took final {{leave of}} her he shook her hand, {{and as he}} did so he gave her a {{peculiar}} grasp which, in his own mind, indicated that he and she had now nothing more to do with each other, and that the acquaintance was adjourned without day. She bade him a simple farewell, and as he left the house <b>she</b> <b>grinned</b> at his broad back. This grin expressed, to herself at least, that the old and rather faulty acquaintance was at an end, and that the new connection which she intended to establish between herself and him would be upon an entirely different basis.|$|E
6000|$|How {{well she}} remembered the place! <b>She</b> <b>grinned</b> as {{she looked up at}} the little {{entresol}} which she had occupied, and thought of the Bareacres family, bawling for horses and flight, as their carriage stood in the porte-cochere of the hotel. She went to Waterloo and to Laeken, where George Osborne's monument much struck her. She made a little sketch of it. [...] "That poor Cupid!" [...] she said; [...] "how dreadfully he was in love with me, and what a fool he was! I wonder whether little Emmy is alive. It was a good little creature; and that fat brother of hers. I have his funny fat picture still among my papers. They were kind simple people." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{house was}} {{rather like the}} {{ordinary}} kind, {{but there was a}} convenient sausage-shop exactly opposite (trust Joey for that) and we saw a policeman in the street looking the other way, as they always do look just before you rub them. A woman wearing the same kind of clothes as people in other houses wear, told us {{to go up to the}} second floor, and <b>she</b> <b>grinned</b> at David, as if she had heard about him; so up we went, David muttering through his clenched teeth, [...] "I sha'n't laugh," [...] and as soon as we knocked a voice called out, [...] "Here we are again!" [...] at which a shudder passed through David as if he feared that he had set himself an impossible task. In we went, however, and though the voice had certainly come from this room we found nobody there. I looked in bewilderment at David, and he quickly put his hand over his mouth.|$|E
5000|$|Willis gives certain {{dialogue}} traits to some characters. Joanna, {{seeking to}} avoid leading questions, continuously asks {{of patients and}} even friends, [...] "Can you describe it?" [...] and [...] "Can you be more specific?" [...] (When she finds Dr. Wright starting to unconsciously mimic her, <b>she</b> <b>grins</b> in approval.) Maisie, meanwhile, always manipulating Joanna and others to remain with her during her boring bouts in hospital rooms, tends to begin questions with, [...] "Did you know...?" [...] as in, about the Hindenburg, [...] "Did you know they had a piano? Up in a balloon?" [...] Later, when Kit Briarley begins a question, [...] "Did you know...?" [...] Joanna laughs in appreciation.|$|R
60|$|Then, while Sproatly <b>grinned,</b> <b>she</b> {{went out}} and drove away through the bitter frost.|$|R
60|$|Topsy {{had never}} been spoken to so kindly and gently in all her life. For a minute {{she looked as if}} she were going to cry. The next <b>she</b> was <b>grinning</b> as usual in her ugly way.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Jackson {{seemed a}} little disappointed, but she {{smoothed}} the dress over her sharp knees, and continued: [...] "Right there {{the good old days}} ended for yore ma--and for us. The cattle business has been steadily on the chute--that is, the free-range business. I saw it comin', an' I says to Jackson, 'Camp on some river-bottom and chuck in the alfalfy,' I says. An' that's what we did. We got a little bunch o' cattle up in the park--Uncle Sam's man is lookin' after 'em." [...] <b>She</b> <b>grinned.</b> [...] "Jackson kicked at the fee, but I says: 'Twenty cents a head is cheap pasture. We're lucky to get any grass at all, now that everybody's goin' in for sheep. 'Pears like the sheepmen air gettin' bolder and bolder in this free-range graft, and I'm a-bettin' on trouble.'" [...] She rose. [...] "Well, I'm glad to 've had a word with ye; but you hear me: yore ma has got to have doctor's help, or she's a-goin' to fall down some day soon." ...|$|E
60|$|Had {{there been}} some kind gentle soul near at hand who could read and {{appreciate}} this silent generous heart, who knows {{but that the}} reign of Amelia might have been over, and that friend William's love might have flowed into a kinder channel? But there was only Glorvina of the jetty ringlets with whom his intercourse was familiar, and this dashing young woman was not bent upon loving the Major, but rather on making the Major admire HER--a most vain and hopeless task, too, at least considering the means that the poor girl possessed to carry it out. She curled her hair and showed her shoulders at him, as much as to say, did ye ever see such jet ringlets and such a complexion? <b>She</b> <b>grinned</b> at him {{so that he might}} see that every tooth in her head was sound--and he never heeded all these charms. Very soon after the arrival of the box of millinery, and perhaps indeed in honour of it, Lady O'Dowd and the ladies of the King's Regiment gave a ball to the Company's Regiments and the civilians at the station. Glorvina sported the killing pink frock, and the Major, who attended the party and walked very ruefully up and down the rooms, never so much as perceived the pink garment. Glorvina danced past him in a fury with all the young subalterns of the station, and the Major was not in the least jealous of her performance, or angry because Captain Bangles of the Cavalry handed her to supper. It was not jealousy, or frocks, or shoulders that could move him, and Glorvina had nothing more.|$|E
5000|$|The {{lyrics of}} the song consist of Simpson insisting to another girl that [...] "You really got it wrong: I didn't steal your boyfriend." [...] Simpson has denied rumors that the song refers to an alleged {{relationship}} with Wilmer Valderrama, ex-boyfriend of Lindsay Lohan, saying [...] "It's not about one person in particular, it's just something every girl can relate to...It's a song about how every girl out there sometimes thinks you stole her boyfriend. It's just making fun of that." [...] She has, however, said that the song was her way of making fun of something she went through, and has said that she leaves {{the question of who}} the song is about up to the imagination; in one interview, Ryan Seacrest observed that <b>she</b> <b>grinned</b> every time she denied that it was about [...] "anyone in particular".|$|E
60|$|A {{few minutes}} later out of the Green Forest came Old Granny Fox, and <b>she</b> was <b>grinning,</b> for once more she had fooled Bowser the Hound and now could take a nap in peace. Still <b>grinning,</b> <b>she</b> turned around {{two or three times}} to make herself {{comfortable}} and then, with a sigh of contentment, curled up for a sun-nap, and in a few minutes was asleep. And just a little way off behind the pine boughs sat Farmer Brown's boy holding his terrible gun and grinning. At last he had caught Old Granny Fox napping.|$|R
40|$|Talk {{about health}} policy reform often loses {{sight of the}} people in the system and their stories. For Inside Story, Melissa Sweet watches two GPs in action ZARA HAS BEEN waiting a while for her turn, but <b>she’s</b> <b>grinning</b> as <b>she</b> hobbles through the door. “I’m the problem child,” she says. She is not {{complaining}} or apologising, just matter-of-fact. Smiling from behind her desk, Sue Harnett agrees. She explains to me, the observer in the corner, that Zara “freaks Neale out. ” Her colleague Neale Gunning has a squeamish stomach and had to tend Zara’s dressings last week when Sue was on holiday in the Kimberley… Read the full article Photo: Melissa Swee...|$|R
6000|$|How <b>she</b> did <b>grin</b> and <b>grin</b> when <b>she</b> saw Tom. [...] "Yar!" [...] said she, [...] "you little meddlesome wretch, I {{have you}} now! I will serve you out for telling the salmon where I was!" [...] And she crawled {{all over the}} pot to get in.|$|R

I wish you would tell me He knew it had to be important, if she’d called Marina). (2) there are six intentions of love expressions, namely showing affection (I’m glad you’re happy, sweetheart, Andy whispered to her that night), showing care (Take care, he said quietly, and then they left), showing eagerness (I wish today is never end, she said, closing her eyes, and thinking of how wonderful it had been), showing engagement (I promise I’ll make it as easy as I can), showing persuasion (You look absolutely gorgeous!, he raved appreciatively and <b>she</b> <b>grinned),</b> and showing praise (You’re a beautiful bride, barb, Mark told her as they dance slowly around the floor) ...|$|E

50|$|Suddenly, {{all hell}} breaks loose as the Hierophant is murdered with the dagger Poison {{acquired}} for Aelthar. The lords of the varying realms {{are in an}} uproar, as {{the death of the}} Hierophant means that a successor must take his place, and each realm wants the new Hierophant to be of their own world. Aelthar is particularly determined, and Poison discovers that he—by way of the Scarecrow, the phaerie creature who steals children from their beds and replaces them with changelings—has been breeding phaerie-human hybrids, as humans are the only species with imaginations and therefore best suited to become Hierophant. He shows Poison her own sister, now a teenager, who he had sent home after deeming her unsuitable. Poison realizes that the girl she sent back to Gull with word of her journey was, in fact, her rapidly aged sister. Deprived of her quest, Poison is furious and determined to get revenge. Aelthar sets the Scarecrow after her among the Hierophant's archives, and she kills it, upon which she is stabbed by Aelthar's assistant. The world starts to rapidly dissolve around her, and <b>she</b> <b>grins</b> through the blood, announcing that she has realized that she is the new Hierophant.|$|R
6000|$|Old Mrs Keswick {{was kind}} to him, but grave, and rather silent. Once {{she passed the}} open door of the parlor, by the window of which sat Miss Annie and Lawrence, deeply engaged, their heads together, in {{studying}} out something on a map, and as she went up-stairs <b>she</b> grimly <b>grinned,</b> and said to herself: [...] "If that Null could look in and see them now, I reckon our young man would wish he had the use of all his arms and legs." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> {{found him}} <b>grinning</b> over the bowl. She was discovered, and she blushed a little. [...] "Thank you, Monseigneur," [...] she said. [...] "You see your ladies have been here. How good of you! I couldn't come before--I {{was in the}} kitchen making a pudding." ...|$|R
