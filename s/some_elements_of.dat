5|$|At {{the time}} of Constantine the Great (r. 306–337), barely 10% of the Roman Empire's {{population}} were Christians, with most of them being urban population and generally found {{in the eastern part}} of the Roman Empire. The majority of people still honoured the old gods in the public Roman way of religio. As Christianity became a complete philosophical system, whose theory and apologetics were heavily indebted to the Classic word, this changed. In addition, Constantine, as Pontifex Maximus, was responsible for the correct cultus or veneratio of the deity which was in accordance with former Roman practice. The move from the old religion to the new entailed <b>some</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> continuity as well as break with the past, though the artistic heritage of paganism was literally broken by Christian zeal.|$|E

5|$|For {{the scenery}} design, layout {{supervisor}} Rasoul Azadani took many {{pictures of his}} hometown of Isfahan, Iran for guidance.

Eighth Army also ordered the US 24th Infantry Division to move to Kyongsan, southeast of Taegu, in a regrouping of forces. The US 21st Infantry Regiment had already moved there on the 14th.

5|$|The Supreme Court has {{eventually}} adopted <b>some</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> Harlan's approach, {{holding that}} only some Bill of Rights guarantees were applicable against the states—the doctrine known as selective incorporation. However, under Chief Justice Earl Warren during the 1960s, {{an increasing number}} of rights were deemed sufficiently fundamental for incorporation (Harlan regularly dissented from these rulings). Hence, the majority of provisions from the Bill of Rights have been extended to the states; the exceptions are the Third Amendment, the grand jury clause of the Fifth Amendment, the Seventh Amendment, the excessive bail provision of the Eighth Amendment, the Ninth Amendment, and the Tenth Amendment. Thus, although the Supreme Court has agreed with Harlan's general reasoning, the end result of its jurisprudence is very different from what Harlan advocated.|$|E

Modern scholars have sought, as yet unsuccessfully, to determine a written source of the theological program of the ceiling and have questioned {{whether or not it was}} entirely devised by the artist himself, who was both an avid reader of the Bible and a genius. Also of interest to some modern scholars is the question of how Michelangelo's own spiritual and psychological state is reflected in the iconography and the expression of the ceiling. One such speculation is that Michelangelo was tormented by conflict between homosexual desires and passionate Christian beliefs.|$|E
