This achievement prompted her parents to rent an apartment in Melbourne, <b>so</b> <b>she</b> could train with Froelich on a regular basis.

This was completed in October 1942, and it changed the old battleship's appearance <b>so</b> <b>she</b> slightly resembled a South Dakota from a distance. Her 5"/51s and 5"/25s were replaced with sixteen 5"/38 caliber guns in new twin mounts. Nevada then sailed for Alaska, where she provided fire support from 11–18 May 1943 for the capture of Attu.|$|E
