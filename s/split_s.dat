The P-38's engine troubles at high altitudes only occurred with the Eighth Air Force. One {{reason for this}} was the inadequate cooling systems of the G and H models; the improved P-38 J and L had tremendous success flying out of Italy into Germany at all altitudes. Until the -J-25 variant, P-38s were easily avoided by German fighters {{because of the lack}} of dive flaps to counter compressibility in dives. German fighter pilots not wishing to fight would perform the first half of a <b>Split</b> <b>S</b> and continue into steep dives because they knew the Lightnings would be reluctant to follow.|$|E

40|$|Ribosome {{recycling}} factor (RRF), {{elongation factor}} G (EF-G) and GTP <b>split</b> 70 <b>S</b> ribosomes into subunits. Here, we {{demonstrated that the}} splitting was transient and the exhaustion of GTP resulted in re-association of the split subunits into 70 S ribosomes unless IF 3 (initiation factor 3) was present. However, the splitting was observed with sucrose density gradient centrifugation (SDGC) without IF 3 if RRF, EF-G and GTP {{were present in the}} SDGC buffer. The <b>splitting</b> of 70 <b>S</b> ribosomes causes the decrease of light scattering by ribosomes. Kinetic constants obtained from the light scattering studies are sufficient to account for the <b>splitting</b> of 70 <b>S</b> ribosomes by RRF and EF-G/GTP during the lag phase for activation of ribosomes for the log phase. As the amount of 70 S ribosomes increased, more RRF, EF-G and GTP were necessary to <b>split</b> 70 <b>S</b> ribosomes. In the presence of a physiological amount of polyamines, GTP and factors, even 0. 6 microM 70 S ribosomes (12 times higher than the 70 S ribosomes for routine assay) were split.

Here {{we report that}} H(2) <b>S</b> can be <b>splitted</b> stoichiometrically into hydrogen and sulfur on CdS-based photocatalysts under visible light irradiation using ethanolamine as a H(2) S solvent and reaction media at room temperature. Raman spectra showed that the produced sulfur existed as S(4) (2 -) and S(6) (2 -) after photocatalytic reaction. The hydroxyls of the reaction media {{were found to be}} crucial for the hydrogen production, and the rate-determining step (RDS) of photocatalytic <b>splitting</b> H(2) <b>S</b> in diethanolamine is discussed. Electrochemical evaluation showed that the potential of H(2) <b>S</b> <b>splitting</b> in ethanolamine was greatly lowered and the photogenerated electrons could be fully used to reduce protons for hydrogen production.

50|$|In modern {{aerobatic}}s, an Immelmann turn (also {{known as}} a roll-off-the-top, or simply an Immelmann) is an aerobatic maneuver.

5000|$|The {{reasons for}} {{starting}} the <b>Split</b> <b>S</b> manoeuvre from the inverted position include {{the fact that}} people tolerate acceleration ("g-force") applied from head to feet several times better than the reverse direction, as much as 9g versus 3g.

A much tighter manoeuvre is therefore possible with the half roll.|$|E
