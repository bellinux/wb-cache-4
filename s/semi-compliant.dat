25|$|When and how {{applications}} are taught varies from style to style. Today, many styles begin to teach new students {{by focusing on}} exercises in which each student knows a prescribed range of combat and technique to drill on. These drills are often <b>semi-compliant,</b> meaning one student does not offer active resistance to a technique, {{in order to allow}} its demonstrative, clean execution. In more resisting drills, fewer rules apply, and students practice how to react and respond. 'Sparring' refers to {{the most important aspect of}} application training, which simulates a combat situation while including rules that reduce the chance of serious injury.|$|E
40|$|Angioplasty {{balloons}} {{are used}} to enlarge narrowed blood vessels; the balloons are required to have thin walls, and yet high burst pressure, and also be <b>semi-compliant</b> (e. g., limited increase in balloon diameter past the nominal pressure). In this study, the 3 X 15 mm and 8 X 30 mm balloons are formed by a unique micro-blow molding process. The process starts by stretching an extruded tubing of thermoplastic elastomer, into a &# 039;parison&# 039; {{by means of a}} Double End Stretching Machine. The balloon forming is accomplished through a process called stretch blow molding, where the &# 039;parison&# 039; is stretched under pressure and at elevated temperatures to form a &# 039;balloon&# 039;. Following the formation of the balloon, a secondary temperature is applied over a dwell time; this annealing step prevents shrinkage of the balloon once it is removed from the mould. The current study focuses on the effects of heat treatment during micro blow molding process to achieve <b>semi-compliant</b> balloons with thin walls and high burst pressure. To this end, the balloons prepared under different processing conditions are characterized in terms of mechanical properties. An ideal process condition is proposed...|$|E
40|$|Optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) is used {{to study}} the deformation of a mock artery in an angioplasty simulation setup. An OCT probe integrated in a balloon catheter provides intraluminal real-time images during balloon inflation. Swept-source OCT is used for imaging. A 4 mm <b>semi-compliant</b> polyurethane balloon is used for experiments. The balloon is inflated inside a custom-built multi-layer artery phantom. The phantom has three layers to mock artery layers, namely, intima, media and adventitia. Semi-automatic segmentation of phantom layers is performed to provide a detailed assessment of the phantom deformation at various inflation pressures. Characterization of luminal diameter and thickness of different layers of the mock artery is provided for various inflation pressures. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|In {{coronary}} intervention practice, optimal stent deployment {{in terms}} of adequate expansion and complete apposition {{is of paramount importance}} to obtain favorable immediate and long-term results. Even with the introduction of stent delivery systems based on a <b>semi-compliant</b> balloon allowing stent deployment at higher pressures (≥ 14 atm), adjunctive post dilation with a non-compliant (NC) balloon at very high pressures (≥ 20 atm) is still necessary to optimize the result in a vast majority of cases. After the introduction of drug-eluting stents, this issue has been highlighted in order to reduce restenosis and prevent the devastating event of stent thrombosis. 1 Nevertheless, advancing the NC balloon across the proximal edge or body of a freshly deployed stent might prove challenging in some situations. NC balloons hav...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{industrial}} robots in the aircraft {{industry has been}} hampered {{by a combination of}} poor accuracy of the robots and poor calibration of the workcell, and also manufacturing variability in composite parts. A way to handle these difficulties is using force control. An experimental case where a <b>semi-compliant</b> rib is aligned to multiple surfaces is used as an example to show this. The constraint-based task specification framework is used for the modelling and control, and the search and alignment sequence required for the assembly is modeled with a state machine. An implementation on an industrial robot system is presented and experimental data is evaluated. The described approach is easy to apply to other fields and more complicated assembly operations as well...|$|E
40|$|Today, the {{majority}} of coronary stents are balloon-expandable and are deployed using a balloon-tipped catheter. To improve deliverability, the membrane of the angioplasty balloon is typically folded about the catheter in a pleated configuration. As such, the deployment of the angioplasty balloon is governed by the material properties of the balloon membrane, its folded configuration and its attachment to the catheter. Despite this observation, however, an optimum strategy for modelling {{the configuration of the}} angioplasty balloon in finite element studies of coronary stent deployment has not been identified, and idealised models of the angioplasty balloon are commonly employed in the literature. These idealised models often neglect complex geometrical features, such as the folded configuration of the balloon membrane and its attachment to the catheter, which may have a significant influence on the deployment of a stent. In this study, three increasingly sophisticated models of a typical <b>semi-compliant</b> angioplasty balloon were employed to determine the influence of angioplasty balloon configuration on the deployment of a stent. The results {{of this study indicate that}} angioplasty balloon configuration has a significant influence on both the transient behaviour of the stent and its impact on the mechanical environment of the coronary artery...|$|E
40|$|Inserting {{an end of}} a rope {{through a}} loop is a common and {{important}} action that is required for creating most types of knots. To perform this action, we need to pass {{the end of the}} rope through an area that is enclosed by another segment of rope. As for all knotting actions, the robot must for this exercise control over a <b>semi-compliant</b> and flexible body whose complex 3 d shape is difficult to perceive and follow. Additionally, the target loop often deforms during the insertion. We address this problem by defining a virtual magnetic field through the loop's interior and use the Biot Savart law to guide the robotic manipulator that holds the end of the rope. This approach directly defines, for any manipulator position, a motion vector that results in a path that passes through the loop. The motion vector is directly derived from the position of the loop and changes as soon as it moves or deforms. In simulation, we test the insertion action against dynamic loop deformation of different intensity. We also combine insertion with grasp and release actions, coordinated by a hybrid control system, to tie knots in simulation and with a NAO robot. Comment: 8 page...|$|E
40|$|We {{explored}} {{the potential of}} intravascular optical coherence tomography (IVOCT) to assess deformation during angioplasty balloon inflation. Using a <b>semi-compliant</b> balloon and artery phantoms, we considered two experimental scenarios. The goal for the first scenario was to investigate if variation in the elasticity of the structure surrounding the balloon could be sensed by IVOCT monitoring. In this scenario, we used three single-layer phantoms with various mechanical properties. Image analysis was performed to extract {{the inner and outer}} diameters of the phantoms at various pressures. The goal for the second scenario was twofold. First, we investigated the IVOCT capability to monitor a more complex balloon inflation process. The balloon was in a folded state prior to inflation. This allowed studying two stages of deformation: during balloon unfolding and during balloon expansion. Second, we investigated IVOCT capability to monitor the deformation in a three-layer phantom used to better mimic a true artery. So, not only were the IVOCT images processed to provide the inner and outer diameters of the phantom, but the layer thicknesses were also determined. In both scenarios, IVOCT monitoring revealed to be very efficient in providing relevant information about the phantom deformation during balloon inflation.

40|$|Balloon {{angioplasty}} revolutionised percutaneous {{treatment for}} {{coronary artery disease}} four decades ago, but vessel-threatening dissections, elastic recoil and restenosis were major drawbacks to an otherwise successful long-lasting intervention. Subsequent advances with bare metal stents and then drug eluting stents followed, aiming to mitigate the risks of acute vessel closure and restenosis. However, stent implantation often necessitates dual antiplatelet therapy for a prolonged period of time, which in itself can lead to adverse outcomes, especially in the frail elderly population at higher risk of bleeding. More recently, bioabsorbable stents have been implemented in clinical practice enabling earlier intimal coverage of the stent and apposition. However, another addition to the armamentarium of percutaneous coronary intervention {{is the use of}} drug-coated balloons without the need for deploying any coronary stents or scaffolds. Drug-coated balloons are <b>semi-compliant</b> balloons coated with an antiproliferative agent that is rapidly released on contact with the vessel intima exerting an anti-restenotic effect. The absence of a metallic scaffold means that the need for antiplatelet therapy can potentially be negated in the longer term if required. In this article, we will review the history of percutaneous coronary intervention and the available evidence for the appropriate use of drug-coated balloons especially in the elderly population. We will conclude this review by demonstrating the potential use of drug-coated balloon rather percutaneous stenting through case examples...|$|E
40|$|Cementation of all-ceramic restorations with resin-cements {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} to {{reduce the incidence of}} fracture in service. The aim was to investigate the influence of loading force and loading duration applied during cementation on the reinforcement conferred by a resin-cement on a leucite reinforced glass-ceramic. 210 glass-ceramic discs (12 mm diameter, 0. 8 mm thickness) were allocated to seven groups (n= 30). The bi-axial flexure strength (BFS) was determined for 'as-fired' specimens (group A), following HF-acid etching (group B) and following etching and centrally loading on a <b>semi-compliant</b> substrate with 30 N for 300 s (group C). Further etched specimens were coated with Rely-X Unicem resin-cement under cementation loading of 5 or 30 N, for 60 or 300 s (groups D-F) prior to BFS determination using multilayered analytical solutions. BFS data was compared using factorial or one-way analyses of variance and the Weibull analysis. HF-acid etching of the 'as-fired' surface resulted in a significant reduction in mean BFS (P< 0. 001) whereas resin-cementation subsequently conferred significant strengthening (P< 0. 001) ranging from 24 to 38 % and dependent on the loading parameters employed. A factorial significance (P= 0. 004) of seating load (5 or 30 N) and significant factorial interaction (P< 0. 001) of seating load and load duration (60 or 300 s) on the mean BFS were identified. The magnitude of resin-reinforcement conferred was sensitive to the loading parameters investigated although the mechanisms underlying the variation appear complex. Similar patterns of variability can be expected clinically impacting on the clinical longevity of resin-cemented glass-ceramic restorations...|$|E
40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. M. E. thesis. August 2015. Major: Mechanical Engineering. Advisor: Barney Klamecki. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xii, 104 pages. Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA) is frequently used for revascularization of atherosclerotic lesions {{in patients with}} peripheral and coronary artery disease. The secondary success rate of the intervention is low due {{to the process of}} restenosis which {{is said to be a}} response of the tissue to vascular injury post dilation. The stresses and damage in the artery may be an important marker for this process. Morphology of the plaque is an important predictor for these arterial stresses and there is a need to understand the dependence of wall damage to the underlying plaque morphology. Orbital atherectomy (OA) is a minimally invasive interventional procedure used in heavily diseased and calcified lesions. Clinical studies have demonstrated that OA procedure may increase the lesion compliance. However the computational studies for OA procedure are rare. Given the increasing use of OA in clinical practice, a computational investigation of the procedure is in order. Angioplasty simulations were carried out for a peripheral lesion model based on a histological study of the superficial peripheral artery. The effect of changing the degree of calcification on stresses and damage in the vessel wall during PTA was examined. The results indicate that increasing the degree of calcification increases the peak stresses in the non-calcified portion of the wall making it more susceptible to injury. Plasticity of the lesion components and the original SFA geometry were also considered for some simulations and demonstrate similar results in stresses. In another set of simulations, the influence of decreasing the plaque stiffness on the vessel stresses and damage was investigated. The results show that under the action of a <b>semi-compliant</b> angioplasty balloon, the stresses in the wall decrease with decreasing stiffness of the plaque components. This necessitates the investigation of procedures like atherectomy which are hypothesized to increase lesion compliance. An experimental study was carried out at Cardiovascular Systems Inc to explore the change in compliance of the lesion post OA procedure. Cadaveric SFA lesion was internally pressurized before and after OA and the cross-sectional lumen areas were recorded using an Optical Coherence Tomography imaging catheter. The analysis of the results showed that there was an increase in compliance of the vessel after OA. A computational analysis of OA was also carried out based on experimental crown dynamics observed in a study carried out by a fellow researcher, Yihao Zheng at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. The same lesion model used in the PTA simulations was used for this study and the results demonstrate that the stress field in OA is quite localized the area of contact near the crown tool. The damage field and peak stresses are therefore localized to the plaque components and the peak stresses in the vessel wall are much smaller than in PTA simulations. The softening of the plaque components was evident through the damage field and compliance at low internal pressure levels similar to ones used in the experimental investigation was calculated. The results show an increase in compliance at low internal pressure levels after OA procedure. Damage energy density analysis was carried out for simulations of both the interventional procedures and the damage in the individual components was compared. The results show that the damage in the media and adventitia much smaller in the OA simulations as compared to PTA. The work presented in this thesis has provided a better understanding of the mechanical response of atherosclerotic lesions to PTA and OA interventional procedures and serve as a basis for future work for computational work in this field...|$|E
