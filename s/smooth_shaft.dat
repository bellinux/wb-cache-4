60|$|The room is, of course, {{very clear}} and clean and simple; {{not by any means}} cheaply equipped, but {{designed}} to economise the labour of redding and repair just as much as is possible. It is beautifully proportioned, and rather lower than most rooms I know on earth. There is no fireplace, and I am perplexed by that until I find a thermometer beside six switches on the wall. Above this switch-board is a brief instruction: one switch warms the floor, which is not carpeted, but covered by a substance like soft oilcloth; one warms the mattress (which is of metal with resistance coils threaded to and fro in it); and the others warm the wall in various degrees, each directing current through a separate system of resistances. The casement does not open, but above, flush with the ceiling, a noiseless rapid fan pumps air out of the room. The air enters by a Tobin shaft. There is a recess dressing-room, equipped with a bath and all that is necessary to one's toilette, and the water, one remarks, is warmed, if one desires it warm, by passing it through an electrically heated spiral of tubing. A cake of soap drops out of a store machine on the turn of a handle, and when you have done with it, you drop that and your soiled towels and so forth, which also are given you by machines, into a little box, through the bottom of which they drop at once, and sail down a <b>smooth</b> <b>shaft.</b> A little notice tells you the price of your room, and you gather the price is doubled if you do not leave the toilette as you found it. Beside the bed, and to be lit at night by a handy switch over the pillow, is a little clock, its face flush with the wall. The room has no corners to gather dirt, wall meets floor with a gentle curve, and the apartment could be swept out effectually by a few strokes of a mechanical sweeper. The door frames and window frames are of metal, rounded and impervious to draught. You are politely requested to turn a handle at the foot of your bed before leaving the room, and forthwith the frame turns up into a vertical position, and the bedclothes hang airing. You stand at the doorway and realise that there remains not a minute's work for anyone to do. Memories of the foetid disorder of many an earthly bedroom after a night's use float across your mind.|$|E
50|$|The arched, {{tripartite}} window immediately {{above the}} main portal is echoed by similar window treatments {{in the wall}} dormers and another just to its left. The main window above the portal and {{the one in the}} front elevation dormer are adorned with <b>smooth</b> <b>shaft</b> colonnettes. These arched windows, as well as the building’s other, flat-headed window openings (also arranged in threes) are embellished with stained-glass transoms and smooth transom bars.|$|E
50|$|Young-Noyes House, {{also known}} as the University of Charleston President's House, is a {{historic}} home located at Charleston, West Virginia. It was built in 1922 and is a white-painted 15-room brick house, featuring a central two-story gabled block and a shallow two-story gabled ell. It has a river-facing flat-roofed tetrastyle portico; the two-story <b>smooth</b> <b>shaft</b> columns are of the Doric order. The home is in the Colonial Revival style. It was purchased in 1951 to serve as the Morris Harvey College President's home.|$|E

50|$|The park is also {{notable for}} its {{numerous}} glacial potholes, <b>smooth</b> <b>shafts</b> scoured into rock. These were formed {{at the end}} of the Wisconsin glaciation when the river was swollen by the melting ice, and powerful eddies sent debris swirling around and around, literally drilling shafts into the streambed. The Log Creek Arches in the northern section are potholes whose bottoms have been worn away on one side.|$|R

50|$|The 2 ½ story {{structure}} {{rests on}} a raised basement and is dominated by a colossal offset tower {{to the left of}} the massive main entrance portal and by smaller, secondary prominences such as steeply pitched wall dormers and an octagonal turret on the corner to the right of the main portal. This massive portal is flanked on its left by a large <b>smooth</b> <b>shaft</b> column with Byzantine capital; the place of its mate on the opposite side is occupied by the heavy main tower. The spandrels of the portal arch are decorated with a delicate, foliate relief pattern.|$|E

[...] It has a <b>smooth</b> <b>shaft</b> {{ending in a}} handle wrapped in a coloured cord ending with a hanging tassel. A small tine is attached just above the grip. Originally the colour of the wrapping-cord indicated the social level of the wielder. [...] The original design of the Ikkaku-ryū jutte had a hexagonal shaft cross-section with the tine attached {{to one of the}} corners instead of the flat surface. [...] The inside of the tine was also sharpened which enabled the wielder to use it for cutting if applicable.|$|E
60|$|You {{should look}} at the North American forests of social trees-- {{especially}} of pines and firs, where trees of one species, crowded together, and competing with equal advantages for the air and light, form themselves into one wilderness of straight <b>smooth</b> <b>shafts,</b> surmounted by a flat sheet of foliage, held up by boughs like the ribs of a groined roof, while underneath the ground is bare as a cathedral floor.|$|R

5000|$|The first level: {{ground floor}} {{in the middle of}} the body (4 axis), has a small flat roof porch with the main portal. The portal has fanlight, flanked by half-columns with <b>smooth</b> <b>shafts.</b> The capitals with {{cornices}} are decorated palmettes. The portal is closed with a full arc, archivolts geometrically ornamented with triangles. Fortunately, this molding was known from the side portals. The auxiliary arches are decorated with palmettes with volutes. This motif was also seen on the fragments of the side portals. The porch plaster is split with horizontal and vertical lines, creating a framework. The porch's corners are visibly projecting forward.|$|R
50|$|Built in grey-green {{serpentine}} {{coming from}} the near cave in Oira, it {{dates back to the}} early 12th century. It has a squared drawing with four columns sustaining the parapet, whose base is decorated with Acanthus leaves. The four columns are different one from each other: two have <b>smooth</b> <b>shaft,</b> while the other two are decorated with twisted motives: of particular note are the leaves and animal head-decorated capitals. On the parapet, counter-clockwise, are represented: a Centaur bow hunting a deer hunted by two wild beasts; the Tetramorph and a Griffin biting a crocodile's tail. The two fighting scenes, with typical figures of the medieval bestiaries, mean the struggle between good and evil.|$|E
50|$|Paddles {{used for}} stand up surfing {{are similar to}} but longer than {{traditional}} canoe paddles. They are usually constructed from carbon, fiberglass or wood with a flat blade on one end connecting to {{a handle on the}} other end by a long <b>smooth</b> <b>shaft.</b> The blade ranges from 6 to 10 inches in width with an oval or round shaft ranging from 67 to 86 inches in length with a 1 to 1.5 inch diameter. Blades are designed with several shapes and features. Normally the blade has a banana peel shape sometimes with a slight keel on {{the back side of the}} blade. Other commonly used shapes include diamonds, or oars. Different blade shapes are sometimes used for different types of paddling conditions (long-distance, flat lake water versus ocean surf for example).|$|E
50|$|The main western {{entrance}} has rosette ornamentations and {{is framed}} by two fluted pilasters supporting a plain entablature which rests on pedestals decorated with acanthus leaves. The other two lintels {{are of the}} same classic design which inspired the western front. The surrounding arcades to the north have lost {{the tip of the}} <b>smooth</b> <b>shaft</b> columns on pedestals flanking the cross and crown brackets. The southern end is made up of raised segments with raised padded, bracketed by the remains of a braided columella. It is also trimmed with separate columns along the remainder of the left side, topped with a capital of acanthus leaves. A decorative fascia runs along the lintel, a classical entablature, alternating corrugated eight-petalled rosettes. This fascia also travels outside the transepts and chancel. The vaulted roof, resting on pillars, is topped with fluted fascia capitals. The porch floor is decorated with curlicues. The tower of the church, almost 27 meters high at the western end of the portico is divided into three sections: entrance porch, bell tower and level landing, upon which stands a pavilion topped by an octagonal chamfered cupola.|$|E

In the {{earliest}} and grandest shaft architecture which we know, that of Egypt, {{we have no}} grouped arrangements, properly so called, but either single and <b>smooth</b> <b>shafts,</b> or richly reeded and furrowed shafts, which represent the extreme conditions of a complicated group bound together to sustain a single mass; and are indeed, without doubt, nothing else than imitations of bundles of reeds, or of clusters of lotus:[42] but in these shafts there is merely {{the idea of a}} group, not the actual function or structure of a group; they are just as much solid and simple shafts as those which are smooth, and merely by the method of their decoration present to the eye the image of a richly complex arrangement.|$|R

30|$|They {{are even}} more rare at the sacral level than those higher on the spine because of the {{stability}} of the bony pelvis [9, 10]. For the case described here, a possible explanation of the anterior development of the pseudomeningocele with sacral erosion could be a complete and extensile lesion of the dura at the fracture level and the posterior closure of the lesion with a synthetic patch; as the pseudomeningocele was lying against the <b>smooth</b> <b>shaft</b> of the screw, its wall was damaged by the screw thread during its removal, thus causing liquorrhea.|$|E
30|$|The {{zygomatic}} bone was adequately exposed. Implants from Noris Medical Ltd. (Nesher, Israel) were chosen. The working, threaded {{part of the}} implant is 13  mm long, while the remaining, fully <b>smooth</b> <b>shaft</b> has 4 -mm diameter and variable length. In all, length ranges from 35 to 57.5  mm. Implant drilling was performed using both straight and angled handpieces. The fixtures were placed at 35  rpm for the 2 / 3 of the apical and manually for the most coronal 1 / 3 working part. Palatal-alveolar repair was attained with soft tissue, local flaps: these were also wrapped around the implants. In order to obtain a durable watertight seal between oral and nasal/antral cavities, implant uncovering and loading were planned to be deferred by 3  months.|$|E

The proposed methodology is realised via {{the control of the}} instantaneous output torque of each excited phase by regulating its associated co-energy to follow a co-energy profile. As the parameters of the feedback controller are independent of the motor parameters in the analysis of the co-energy control system with the proposed methodology, the design of the proposed controller is simple when compared to that for traditional current controllers. <b>Smooth</b> <b>shaft</b> torque is obtained by torque sharing among the active phases during commutation.

40|$|Shaft is {{a machine}} element with main {{function}} for power transmission. Shaft is often needed in steppd form (change in cross-section). For a non <b>smooth</b> <b>shaft</b> (stepped shaft), the elementary stress equations {{are no longer}} hold for calculating the actual stress as the stress would be higher than the nominal stress. To relate the maximum stress at the discontinuity with the nominal stress calculated using the elementary stress equations, a factor is needed which is called stress concentration factors (SCF). This paper aims to present an expeimantal results of stress concentration factors of stepped shaft of circular-to-square cross section under pure torsion. The results show that stress concentration factors of stepped-shaft of circular to square cross-section is slightly higher than corresponding stepped-shaft of circular-to-circular crosssection...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims at a {{theoretical}} {{explanation of the}} following two experimental observations of radial lip seals: fluid film formation and upstream pumping action. The origins of these observations are still poorly understood. A hydrodynamic analysis is presented for the fully flooded contact zone of a <b>smooth</b> <b>shaft</b> surface running against a rough seal surface. Four roughness structures are considered: one-dimensional sinusoidal and two-dimensional sinusoidal seal roughness structures both without and with a tangential seal surface displacement. The tangential seal surface displacement is chosen asymmetric with the axial position in the contact. It follows that the tangential deformation of the one- and two-dimensional seal roughness structures used in this paper can explain the aforementioned experimental observations and simulate the observed order of magnitude of load-carrying capacity, pump rate, and friction torque found in the literature...|$|E

40|$|In this study, thermohydrodynamic {{performance}} of a journal bearing with a microgroove created on the shaft is analysed. A plain journal bearing is modelled using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software package. Navier-Stokes and energy equations are solved. The rotor-stator interaction is treated by using a computational grid deformation technique. Results are presented in terms of typical bearing parameters as well as flow patterns. Results are also compared to the bearing with a <b>smooth</b> <b>shaft.</b> The effect induced by a microgroove on pressure distribution is explained for different bearing configurations, eccentricities and microgroove depths. It is shown that the microgroove produces a local drop in pressure which, averaged over one revolution, decreases the load carrying capacity. The load carrying capacity is further decreased by using deeper microgrooves. With thermal effects considered, the microgroove carries more cold lubricant into the warmest regions of the bearing. This effect, more pronounced with deeper microgrooves, {{is due to a}} global flow recirculation inside the microgroove, which improve mixingGodkänd; 2011; 20111113 (cervante...|$|E
40|$|The {{contractility}} of platelets {{has been}} attributed to an actomyosin-like protein which has been well defined on a physicochemical basis. Moreover, platelets contain ± 80 A filaments which resemble actin filaments in smooth muscle. Studies were undertaken on human and bovine platelets to better define the morphologic structures which may subserve this contractile function. In order to identify actin, the ability of the filaments to react with heavy meromyosin (HMM) was tested. Accordingly, platelets were glycerinated and treated with HMM. In addition, platelet actin was extracted, reacted with HMM, and examined by negative staining. In both instances typical arrowhead structures with clearly defined polarity and a periodicity of ± 360 A formed. As is the case with purified muscle actin, the complexes were dissociable with Mg-ATP. The formation of myosin-like filaments was observed when osmotically shocked platelets were incubated with MgCl 2 and excess ATP. These “thick” filaments measured 250 - 300 A in width, tapered at both ends and often occurred in clumps. They resembled aggregates of thick filaments described in contracted smooth muscle. Extraction of platelets by methods suitable for the demonstration of myosin showed filaments with an average length of 0. 3 μ, a <b>smooth</b> <b>shaft,</b> and frayed or bulbous ends. These appeared identical to those seen in synthetically prepared myosin of striated muscle. It is suggested that the filaments described here represent the actin and myosin of platelets...|$|E

5000|$|A rivet is a {{permanent}} mechanical fastener. Before being installed, a rivet consists of a <b>smooth</b> cylindrical <b>shaft</b> with a head on one end. The end opposite to the head is called the tail. On installation the rivet is placed in a punched or drilled hole, and the tail is upset, or bucked (i.e., deformed), so that it expands to about 1.5 times the original shaft diameter, holding the rivet in place. In other words, pounding creates a new [...] "head" [...] {{on the other end}} by smashing the [...] "tail" [...] material flatter, resulting in a rivet that is roughly a dumbbell shape.
