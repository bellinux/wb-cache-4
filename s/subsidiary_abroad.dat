50|$|Capital {{movements}} {{offset the}} surpluses or deficits {{in the current}} account. A current account surplus, for example, implies that rather than using all the foreign currency earned by selling exports to buy imports, corporations and individuals choose to invest the money in foreign-currency-denominated assets instead. As measured in Japan's balance of payments data, capital movements consist of long- and short-term investments and movements in official foreign exchange reserves and private bank accounts. Capital movements include loans, portfolio investments in corporate stock, and direct investment (establishment or purchase of subsidiaries abroad). A capital outflow occurs when a Japanese individual or corporation makes a loan, buys foreign stock, or establishes a <b>subsidiary</b> <b>abroad.</b> A capital inflow occurs when foreigners engage in these operations in Japan.|$|E

From this position of strength, it was also (probably) the first Finnish company to open a <b>subsidiary</b> <b>abroad,</b> in the Swedish town of Härnösand in 1903. The severe competition between the Finnish tobacco producers (such as P.C. Rettig & Co and Tollander & Klaerich) led to rapid technological development in the branch.

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} reason that affects a banks decision to entry a foreign market is to “follow the customer” also called the defensive hypothesis. Foreign banks building upon the expertise in their home country they can differentiate themselves from their competitors in the host country by offering complex and specialized services to their home country corporate customers. Years of long-lasting relationship have provided the banks with crucial information about the unique financial needs that their clients have, the knowledge of which is unavailable to host country institutions. In addition, through this relationship banks are able to develop a competitive advantage stemming through the lower marginal costs that those banks experience when dealing with loan renewals over their local competitors. Unlike manufacturing where knowledge can be protected through patterns and other means, commercial intelligence can be easily gained by any bank with an interest in starting its operations in specific market or industries. In addition, letting other financial institutions to develop a relationship with its existing corporate clients can result in the loss of market share in the banks home county. In order to prevent this from happening banks are obliged to follow the client by opening an office (branch, <b>subsidiary)</b> <b>abroad</b> themselves in order to defend their unique bank client relationship.|$|E

40|$|International labour {{mobility}} {{is becoming a}} key feature of a globalizing world. There is an increasing amount of literature on the success and failure conditions of migrant workers.

40|$|Background: Family Businesses {{represent}} the highest proportion of {{businesses in the}} world (Lin, 2012). Globalisation offers new business opportunities for growth and in-ternational diversification. Generally the internationalisation of family businesses is a well-studied field in family business research (Kontinen & Ojala, 2009). Still, there are certain shortcomings {{when it comes to}} the specific area of corporate governance adapta-tion in family firms that open subsidiaries (Calabro & Mussolino, 2011). Hence, this paper analyses the proceedings of family firms that internationalise through a subsidi-ary. From a methodological standpoint, existing studies concerned with family business internationalisation focus on quantitative research approaches. The results of these in-clude some limitations, since they cannot account for questions such as how and why family firms proceed during diversification (Kontinen & Ojala, 2009). Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the rationale behind corporate gov-ernance structures in family businesses, focusing on the special case of internationalisa-tion through a subsidiary. Frame of Reference: A summary of recent research regarding the three main issues family businesses, internationalisation, and corporate governance will be given in the frame of reference. This theoretical background will serve as the basis for a solid analy-sis of our empirical data. Method: A qualitative approach with an extensive literature review and a case study based on in-depth interviews with employees of the company Väderstad-Verken AB was chosen in order to fulfil the purpose. Conclusion: The rationale behind corporate governance structures when setting up a <b>subsidiary</b> <b>abroad</b> is driven by the ambition to preserve a family firms’ stewardship ori-ented culture and its informal structures.

It analyses the findings of interviews with training officers and Directors of Human Resources in more than 40 German <b>subsidiaries</b> <b>abroad.</b> These interviews show clearly that local factors in the host country exert such a strong influence that it is not possible completely to transfer the German VET system to another country. What is more likely is that an accommodation is reached with local VET structures, local labour market conditions and other socio-cultural features. The findings suggest that policy borrowing in the area of VET is likely to be only partial and will be strongly influenced by the national characteristics of the host country...|$|R
40|$|People make {{up one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} resources for a corporation and therefore it has to continuously seek an ever more diverse and international workforce. Inpatriation is another way of utilizing foreign expertise in a corporation. An inpatriate refers to a person that is on an international assignment at the headquarters of a corporation, where they have been sent either from a <b>subsidiary</b> <b>abroad</b> or from a third country outside the corporation. Strengthening the social network of the inpatriate and their family contributes to the adjustment process and furthermore the success of the work assignment. As social networking sites are currently the fastest developing personal networking tools in the world, it is interesting to see how they can help in inpatriate adjustment. The objective of this thesis is to explore the potential of social networking sites (SNS) in inpatriate adjustment. The main objective can be divided into three sub objectives: 1. What is SNS used for during the inpatriate assignment? 2. What are the inpatriates’ motivations to use SNS? 3. Could the three facets of adjustment (work, interaction and general) be gained through SNS? This qualitative study utilizes the theme interview data collection method and the thematic analysis approach for analysing the interview data. From the interviews with five Indian inpatriates in Finland the most mentioned uses of SNS were related to participating (sharing opinions, recommendations and discussing things and connecting to friends, family and colleagues) and consuming (collecting information for work and free time), the least mentioned use of SNS was producing (posting videos, photos and updates). An interesting finding was that the five interviewees did not use SNS for purely entertainment motives at all during their assignment.

40|$|Our {{empirical}} {{study provides}} the first insights of executive staffing practice patterns in foreign-owned multinational company (MNC) subsidiaries based in Japan. We explore determinants for parent country nationals (PCN) as top managing directors and - {{new in the}} International Human Resource Management (IHRM) literature - also the ratio of PCN found on the board (Ratio) and examine under which conditions they are prevalent in the subsidiaries. We sampled {{the full range of}} 3, 241 foreign companies in Japan. For the PCN/Ratio, several of our hypotheses were relevant for the PCN and were tested to be positive. In regard to the ownership ratio of the subsidiaries, the PCN/Ratio is highly significant to 1 %, supporting the theory that also for Japan high ownership matters when it comes to sending one's "own" people to the <b>subsidiary</b> <b>abroad.</b> In contrast to studies for other countries, however, the size of the subsidiary does not matter for Japan, at least when measured (like usually done) by the number of employees. Only if we measure size by capital does the PCN/Ratio prevalence become significant. The PCN/Ratio also becomes highly significant (by 1 %) in countries with a high Power Distance and a high Uncertainty Avoidance. PCN sending behavior seems to be somehow a country-specific phenomenon. We, furthermore, show that it matters whether companies settle down in one of the two big centers in Japan (Kanto and Kansai), which cultural circumstances for PCN tend to be more similar than in other areas of Japan. In Kanto and Kansai there are statistically significant more PCN and, therefore, a higher PCN/Ratio than in other Japanese areas. In regard to MNCs, we show that smaller sized MNCs have a lower prevalence of PCN as their top managing director. These findings are in contrast to the International Human Resource Management literature. We put MNCs into two groups and show that MNCs with under 5000 employees have a lower prevalence of PCN as top managing directors (on average 28 %). At the same time however, the PCN to the whole board (Ratio) is higher in these smaller MNCs (up to 10 %). In other words, bigger companies seem to rely on their PCN as their top managing director in Japan. In contrast to this, in smaller companies, Japanese senior managers prevail as the top managing directors (HCN), although our research suggests that there are more PCN sent to the board of the bigger MNCs. Finally, we produce evidence that US subsidiaries in Japan have the lowest PCN/Ratio, with the PCN only counting for 22 %, and the Ratio at 28 %. In stark contrast, Asian countries have the highest PCN/Ratio in our sample, with Korea leading with PCN of 81 % and a Ratio of 82 %.

40|$|A {{key factor}} in the {{sustainability}} of China's economic growth is the potential of Chinese firms to develop innovative capabilities autonomously and international management know-how thus enabling them {{to move up the}} technological ladder of the production process and to globalise their operations. If successful, some Chinese firms will eventually develop their own brands and open up subsidiaries abroad like their Japanese and South Korean counterparts a few decades ago. If this is not achieved, then China’s future growth could remain overly dependent on overseas markets and foreign technology. Chinese firms could remain highly competitive in traditional labour-intensive exports (such as the textile, lighters and toys industries of the Zhejiang province) or in relatively simple electric products (such as household appliance) but would not possess the capacity to become innovators of high tech products. The Chinese firms could only operate internationally in highly competitive industries characterised by low barriers to entry and with moderate margins while firms from the most advanced economies could continue to extract rents in industries characterised by high tech and/or differentiated products thanks to their technological innovation capacities and management know-how. The purpose of this paper will be to assess the capacity of China's largest firms to transform themselves into global competitors possessing ownership-specific advantages or intangible assets like some of their East Asian counterparts and to determine to what extent could the Chinese state pursue a strategic industrial policy to help them do so. The fact that a firm establishes a <b>subsidiary</b> <b>abroad</b> does not make it a global competitor, not even a Multinational Enterprise (MNE) or a Trans-National Corporation (TNC). According to United Nations’ (UN) classification, to be considered as TNC or MNE, a firm must have subsidiaries in at least six different countries. Many Chinese firms satisfy these criteria and can be considered as MNEs. Nevertheless, there is a significant gap in terms of possession of intangible assets between being a multinational enterprise and a top global competitor. According to UN estimates, in 2004, there were 70, 000 MNE which controlled 690, 000 subsidiaries across the globe (El Mouhoub, 2006 : 17). Obviously all of those firms cannot be considered as truly global competitors. To delineate more clearly the prerequisites necessary for a firm to evolve into a global competitor, this section will refer to Dunning’s eclectic paradigm and OLI configuration. For Dunning, in order for a firm to transform itself into a MNE, it must possess “ownership-specific advantages”. That is, intangible assets which constitute substantial barriers to entry for other potential competitors. Dunning lists the following assets: “product innovations, product management, organizational and marketing systems, innovatory capacity, organization of work, non-codifiable knowledge (bank of human capital experience), ability to reduce the cost of intra and/or inter-firm transactions” (Dunning, 1993 : 81). Dunning also includes absolute cost advantages coming from a privileged access to inputs, learning by doing, “knowledge of international markets and operations”, “capacity to learn from societal difference in organisational and managerial processes and systems” (Dunning, 1993 : 81). In this paper, the term “global competitors” refers to incumbents of their industries which are protected by natural and strategic barriers to entry and which operate across the different regions of the world economy. These global competitors enjoy most and often all of the ownership-specific Expert PDF Evaluation 2 advantages listed above. Many of them are the “prime movers” from America and Europe whose emergence in the late 19 th century has been analysed by Chandler (Chandler, 1990). They were joined by the Japanese keiretsu in the 1960 ’s and the South Korean chaebol in the 1980 ’s. This paper will attempt to determine whether emerging Chinese champions are effectively acquiring sufficient ownership-specific advantages to have a hope of joining this group of global competitors. The analysis of China’s greatest MNEs and outward FDI flows will show that both the type of ownership-specific advantages and the motivations of Chinese firms investing overseas differ radically from the global competitors of the developed economy. It will also show that, in that respect, Chinese firms are not following the internationalisation path of the Japanese keiretsu in the 1960 ’s or the South Korean chaebol in the 1980 ’s. The first part of the paper will provide an analysis of Chinese outward FDI outflows in an attempt to determine the importance of Chinese MNEs and their performance compared to other developing economies. It will also highlight the limitations of working with such an aggregate {{when it comes to the}} official Chinese data of foreign direct investment. The second part of this contribution will provide a qualitative analysis of the overseas projects made by Chinese MNEs. An attempt will be made to determine the technological level and the capital- intensity of their overseas operations. The extent of government protection and support extended to these largest firms and the sector in which they operate will be examined. It will be demonstrated that the largest Chinese firms are located in sectors which are heavily protected and aided by the Chinese central government. Finally, it will be made clear that that Chinese FDI outflows are predominantly motivated by the Chinese government's geopolitical objectives rather than by business profit maximisation. The third part of the paper will provide a comparative analysis of the performance of China's largest firms’ with that of their global competitors. Aspects to be looked at include capital-intensity, profits and assets. This comparison has two purposes: to clearly delineate the existing gap between these two groups; and to compare the current relative situation of the largest Chinese firms with that of East Asian MNEs at the time of their overseas expansion. This will reveal that Chinese firms have a much lower degree of profitability and capital intensity than the largest Japanese and Korean firms had in the early stages of internationalising their business operations. The three first parts of this paper will highlight the weaknesses of the largest Chinese firms and the gap with their global competitors in terms of profitability, capital and technology intensity. It will be demonstrated that they are unlikely to transform themselves into global competitors without being sheltered by a strong Chinese state industrial policy, as was the case also for their South Korean and Japanese counterparts at a similar stage of their expansion. The fourth and fifth part of the paper will follow up on this by focusing on the capacity of the Chinese state to pursue a strategic trade and industrial policy necessary to transform its national champions into global competitors...|$|E
