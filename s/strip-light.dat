50|$|The Emperor of the Imperial Dalek faction {{features}} in Remembrance of the Daleks. During the serial it is revealed that it contains the Kaled Davros, {{rather than a}} Dalek mutant. With only his head and partial torso visible, he is carried in a life support casing similar in design to the TV21 comic version of the Dalek Emperor. The travel machine has no appendages. A translucent hexagonal panel is located centrally {{on the front of}} the dome, in a position approximating that where an eye stalk would be mounted on a standard Dalek casing. A <b>strip-light</b> is mounted vertically behind it, which scans from side to side when the Emperor speaks. The front upper section of the dome is shown to operate like a visor, retracting upward and to the rear to reveal Davros within.|$|E

The trap is placed horizon-tally in the breeding- wate, ' partially submerged by support on win's or floats. TlU ' subdued luminance of the Betalight is derived li'om the action of tritium gas on a phosphor coating lining the g-Iasstube of the light. They are safe, unaffected by immersion in water, produce no heat, and last for several years. In laboratory tpsts with 50 or 100 lan'ae in aquarium tanks in a dark room, control traps (without a light) caught 8 %- 15 % ofIarvae. Catches with a white Betalight ranged from 45 %- 85 % for Culex pipiens mole. rtllS, C. p. fat(J;llIIs and Aedes togoi, 24 %- 35 % for Anophele. r labranehiae atroparl'l~f, but few Aedes aeg;'Pti were taken. With g-reen, blue or red Betalights catches were from 74 %- 96...|$|E
