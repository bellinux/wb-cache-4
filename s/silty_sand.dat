25|$|The dam {{formed the}} {{southern}} wall {{of one of}} the mill's three holding ponds, which were used to evaporate tailings solution until the remaining solid waste could be buried. During its operation from 1967 to 1982, the mill produced 3.5 million tons of tailings at the rate of 4,000 tons a day. The 35-foot-high embankment was constructed on a deposit of collapsible clayey, <b>silty</b> <b>sand</b> a hundred feet deep. United Nuclear used a new design, recommended by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, that used earth rather than tailings themselves as building material. The holding pond was not lined, in violation of standards in the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978 that required that holding ponds be impermeable. This lack of lining allowed tailings solution to seep into the ground, weakening the foundation of the dam and contaminating the groundwater.|$|E

40|$|The {{empirical}} liquefaction triggering {{chart of}} Idriss and Boulanger (2008) {{is compared to}} direct measurements of the cyclic resistance of Christchurch <b>silty</b> <b>sands</b> via undisturbed and reconstituted lab specimens. Comparisons suggest that overall there is a reasonable agreement between the empirical triggering curve and the interpreted test data.

40|$|Recent {{earthquake}} {{case histories}} have revealed the liquefaction of <b>silty</b> <b>sands</b> during earthquakes. A major challenge is {{the selection of}} the appropriate residual strength of liquefied materials for use in analyses to assess the post-liquefaction stability of embankments and other soil structures. During the Bhuj earthquake on 26 th January 2001, fine sand containing appreciable amount of silt was transported to the ground surface due to liquefaction-induced upward ground water flow. Several sand-boils were observed near the region close to the epicenter of the earthquake. This paper describes the results of an experimental study on the undrained shear behavior of such <b>silty</b> <b>sands</b> collected from the locations very close to the epicenter of the Bhuj earthquake. The present study focuses on the effects of appreciable amount of silt content and confining stress on residual shear strength of <b>silty</b> <b>sands</b> in triaxial compression under monotonic loading and on potential for liquefaction under cyclic loading...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{changes of}} the cyclic {{resistance}} of two <b>silty</b> <b>sands</b> under unsaturated, partially saturated and fully saturated conditions are examined based {{on a series of}} undrained cyclic tests conducted using triaxial test apparatus specially equipped for testing unsaturated soils as well as ordinary triaxial test apparatus for testing partially saturated and fully saturated soils. Based on the observations of volumetric strain, pore air and pore water pressures of unsaturated soil specimens, the possibility of soil liquefaction triggering under different degrees of saturation is examined and discussed. The changes in the cyclic resistance under different degrees of saturation are then examined. Those two unsaturated <b>silty</b> <b>sands</b> with different grain size compositions are found to give rise to different responses on the volumetric strain as well as pore air and pore water pressure developments during undrained cyclic loading, leading to different relations between cyclic resistance and degree of saturation, covering unsaturated, partially saturated and fully saturated conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{assemblage}} {{structure of}} harpacticoid copepods inhabiting the soft sediments of littoral and sublittoral areas of Cat Ba archipelago (South China Sea) is analysed. Three basic types of harpacticoid taxocenes {{were observed in}} the upper sublittoral. Main dominant species of taxocenes were Amphiascoides sp., Stenhelia latioperculata, Paramphiascella sp., Phyllopodopsyllus sp., Tisbe sp. 1 and Amphiascoides sp. In addition, the main characteristics of harpacticoid species composition in littoral rock pools are described. A comparative analysis of shallow-water harpacticoid communities from different biotopes of the tropical region is presented, and shows that harpacticoid diversity and abundance are lowest in muddy sediments. Highest diversity and abundance are found in washed <b>sands</b> and <b>silty</b> <b>sands</b> with detritus. In general, the structure of muddy bottom communities is the most homogeneous throughout the tropics. Mangrove forests have no significant influence on harpacticoid taxocene structure. Harpacticoid associations of washed <b>sands</b> and <b>silty</b> <b>sands</b> with detritus demonstrate greater diversity and are region-specific...|$|R

25|$|Liquefaction is {{more likely}} to occur in loose to {{moderately}} saturated granular soils with poor drainage, such as <b>silty</b> <b>sands</b> or sands and gravels capped or containing seams of impermeable sediments.
