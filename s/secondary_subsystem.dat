50|$|In practice, {{there are}} cases where {{multiple}} subsystems work together to achieve a common goal. This is a fairly common practice for reliability engineering. This technique involves systems working together collaboratively and the reliable operation of the overarching system is an important issue. Fault tolerant strategies are combined with the subsystems to form a fault tolerant collaborative system. A direct application is the case where two robotic manipulators work together to grasp a common object. For these systems, {{it is important that}} when one subsystem becomes faulty, the healthy subsystem reconfigures itself to operate alone to ensure the whole system can still perform its operations until the other subsystem is repaired. In this case, the subsystems create a dialogue between themselves to determine one another's status. In the event of one system starting to exhibit numerous or dangerous faults the <b>secondary</b> <b>subsystem</b> takes over the operation until the faulty system can be repaired.|$|E

The component-mode synthesis method is applied to investigate the seismic response of <b>secondary</b> <b>subsystems</b> multi-connected to primary structures with irregularities. The proposed approach is more accurate than the cascade approximation, often used in the design practice, as the primarysecondary dynamic interaction is considered through the modes of vibration of the two components. The results of parametric analyses on a representative case study reveal similar trends in the displacements of the two components for mass irregularities in elevation, while sti ness irregularities in plan can result in significant torsional motion in both components, with the effects in terms of absolute accelerations being in general larger than those associated with the lateral drifts. This suggests that dynamic analyses with the component-mode synthesis method are particularly indicated for the seismic assessment of acceleration-sensitive <b>secondary</b> <b>subsystems...</b>|$|R
40|$|Semi-Plenary LectureInternational audienceIn {{transient}} nonlinear structural dynamics, the dynamical {{levels of}} transient vibrations {{can be defined}} in terms of a shock response spectrum (SRS) in order to specify the transient loads which are applied to an equipment or to a <b>secondary</b> <b>subsystem.</b> A fundamental problem is then to construct a generator of the non-stationary stochastic process (the transient signal) satisfying a given SRS. This problem has been looked at by many scientists in using specific representations of the non-stationary stochastic process (the accelerogram). In this paper, we propose to solve this challenging stochastic inverse problem by another way in using Information Theory. In the approach proposed, the target SRS is taken as the mean value of the unknown random SRS spanned by the unknown non-stationary stochastic accelerogram for which the probabilistic model has to be constructed. We present the construction of the probability model which allows the confidence region of the random SRS to be carried out. The method presented is validated with an example...|$|E

This paper reviews several families of adaptive aerostructures which have enabled or significantly enhanced flightworthy uninhabited aerial vehicles (UAVs), including rotary and fixed wing aircraft, missiles and munitions. More than 40 adaptive aerostructures programs which have had a direct connection to flight test and/or production UAVs, ranging from hover through hypersonic, sea-level to exo-stratospheric are examined.

An historical analysis shows the evolution of flightworthy adaptive aerostructures from the earliest staggering flights in 1994 to modern adaptive UAVs supporting live-fire exercises in harsh military environments. Because there are profound differences between bench test, wind tunnel test, flight test and military grade flightworthy adaptive aerostructures, some of the most mature industrial design and fabrication techniques in use today will be outlined.

40|$|Portions of the 242 -A Evaporator on the Hanford Site must be {{assessed}} {{to meet the}} requirements of the Washington State Department of Ecology`s Dangerous Waste Regulation, Washington Administrative Code (WAC) 173 - 303. The assessment is limited to the provisions of Section 173 - 303 - 640. This Integrity Assessment Plan (IAP) identifies tasks which will be performed during the assessment phase and describes the intended assessment techniques. The 242 -A Evaporator facility processes waste solutions from most of the operating laboratories and plants of the Hanford Site. The waste solutions are concentrated in the evaporator to a slurry of liquid and crystallized salts. This concentrated slurry is returned to the Tank Farms at a significantly reduce volume. The water vapor from the evaporation process is condensed, filtered, and can be pumped through an ion exchange bed before transfer to a retention basin. The non-condensable portion of the vapor is filtered and continuously monitored before venting to the atmosphere. The 242 -A Evaporator will {{be assessed}} as seven subsystems. Four of the subsystems store, transport or treat Washington State Dangerous wastes, the other three subsystems are integral parts of the process, however, they do not directly store, transfer, or treat listed dangerous wastes.
