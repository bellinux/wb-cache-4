500|$|San Lorenzo Colossal Head7 (also {{known as}} San Lorenzo Monument53) {{measures}} [...] high by [...] wide by [...] deep and weighs 18 tons. San Lorenzo Colossal Head7 was reworked from a monumental throne; {{it was discovered}} by a joint archaeological project by the Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia and Yale University, {{as a result of}} a magnetometer survey. It was buried at a depth of less than [...] and was lying facing upwards, leaning slightly northwards on its right hand side. The head is poorly preserved and has suffered both from erosion and deliberate damage. The headdress is decorated with a pair of human hands; a feathered ornament is carved at the back of the headband and two discs adorn the front. A <b>short</b> <b>strap</b> descends from the headband and hangs in front of the right ear. The head sports large earflares that completely cover the earlobes, although severe erosion makes their exact form difficult to distinguish. The face has wrinkles between the nose and cheeks, sagging cheeks and deep-set eyes; the lips are badly damaged and the mouth is open, displaying the teeth. In 1986 the head was transported to the Museo de Antropología de Xalapa.|$|E
500|$|San Lorenzo Colossal Head6 (also {{known as}} San Lorenzo Monument17) {{is one of}} the smaller {{examples}} of colossal heads, standing [...] It measures [...] wide by [...] deep and is estimated to weigh between 8 and 10 tons. The head was discovered by a local farmworker and was excavated in 1965 by Luis Aveleyra and Román Piña Chan. The head had collapsed into a ravine under its own weight and was found face down on its left hand side. In 1970 it was transported to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York for the museum's centenary exhibition. After its return to Mexico, it was placed in the Museo Nacional de Antropología in Mexico City. It is sculpted with a net-like head covering joined together with sculpted beads. A covering descends from under the headdress to cover the back half of the neck. The headband is divided into four strips and begins above the right ear, extending around the entire head. A <b>short</b> <b>strap</b> descends from either side of the head to the ear. The ear ornaments are complex and are larger {{at the front of the}} ear than at the back. The face is that of an ageing male with the forehead creased in a frown, wrinkles under the eyes, sagging cheeks and deep creases on either side of the nose. The face is somewhat asymmetric, possibly due to errors in the execution of the monument.|$|E
60|$|The sketch {{represents}} {{a section of}} the pack-saddle, at the place where one of the hooks is situated on either side, but the front of the kegs themselves, and not their section, is given. Above and between the kegs lies a bag, and a strap passing from the near side of the saddle goes over the whole burden, and is buckled to a similar <b>short</b> <b>strap</b> on the other side. It is of importance that the bung-hole should be placed even nearer to the rim than where it is drawn, for it is necessary that it should be convenient to pour out of and to pour into, and that it should be placed on the highest part of the keg, both when on the beast's back and also when it stands on the ground, lest water should leak and be lost. According to the above plan, when water is ladled into it, the rim keeps it from spilling; and in pouring out water, the run acts as a spout. In making the bung-hole, a metal plate, with a screw-hole in it, is firmly fixed {{in the face of the}} cask; into this a wooden stopper, bound with iron, is made to screw (natives would probably steal a metal one). The stopper has a small head and a deeply-cut neck, by which it is tied to the cask, and its body has a large hole bored in it, which admits of a stick being put through, to prize it round, if it should become jammed. A spigot, to screw into the bung-hole on arriving at camp, might be really useful; but if used, a gimlet-hole must be bored in the cask to act as an air-vent. A large tundish is very convenient, and a spare plug might be taken; but a traveller, with a little painstaking, could soon cut a plug with his own knife, sufficiently well made to allow of its being Firmly screwed in, and of retaining the water, if it had a bit of rag wrapped round it. A piece of rag rolled tightly, will suffice to plug a hole.|$|E

50|$|Like the CW Sling, the Ching sling uses three sling sockets. Unlike the CW Sling, the Ching sling {{consists}} of a main strap, which {{is attached to the}} forearm and buttstock sockets like a normal carry sling, and a <b>short</b> <b>strap.</b> A clockwise half twist in the sling at the fore-end socket allows the strap to lie flat against the arm when shooting. A stop button screws onto the main strap about two-thirds back from the front loop. The <b>short</b> <b>strap</b> attaches to the middle socket and to an oval ring that slides freely along the main strap between the forearm sling loop and the button. The unfinished side faces the muzzle.|$|E

50|$|The Irish {{martingale}} {{is not a}} true martingale in {{the sense}} of a device that affects the rider's control over the horse. Thus, it is sometimes known as a semi-martingale. It is a simple <b>short</b> <b>strap</b> with a ring on either end. The reins are each run through a ring on either side before being buckled. The Irish martingale's purpose is not to control the head, but to prevent the reins from coming over the horse's head, risking entanglement, should a rider fall. It is used mostly in European horse racing.|$|E
5000|$|... 1920: Huitfeldt style {{bindings}} were by far {{the most}} popular system for decades, with the only major change being Marius Eriksen's 1920 introduction of pre-formed plates that were screwed on top of the ski. Other binding systems did exist, in particular a class of bindings originally introduced by Mathias Zdarsky that replaced the heel strap with a long metal plate under the sole of the boot, hinged at the front to allow the heel to rise. The heel was held to the plate by a <b>short</b> <b>strap</b> attaching at the back. These gave even better control than the Huitfeldt design, but so firmly attached the leg that injury was a real problem.|$|E
50|$|Most {{chastity}} cages {{consist of}} a ring seated {{around the base of}} the penis behind the scrotum and a tube or penis cage that holds the penis, with the two parts mating together with a hinge or pin. The penis cage is designed so that the penis inside cannot be stimulated directly with hands and fingers. The tip of the penis cage is perforated to allow urine to pass and the design may incorporate vents to facilitate long-term wear and cleaning. The flaccid penis is inserted into the cage and is held at a downwards angle so as to make an erection uncomfortable or impossible. Some designs have an extra short penis cage into which the penis may be squeezed to restrict it even more than in a regular penis cage. Other designs incorporate a tip covering the glans through which a catheter is fixed, and the tip is then secured by <b>short</b> <b>straps</b> which confine the penis and are fixed to the ring seated behind the scrotum.|$|R

50|$|One common halter {{design is}} made of either flat nylon webbing or flat leather, has a noseband that passes around the muzzle with one ring under the jaw, usually used to attach a lead rope, and two rings {{on either side of}} the head. The noseband is usually {{adjusted}} to lie about halfway between the end of the cheekbones and the corners of the mouth, crossing over the strong, bony part of the face. The noseband connects to a cheekpiece on either side that go up next to the cheekbone to meet with a ring on either side that usually is placed just above the level of the eye. These rings meet the throatlatch and the crownpiece. The crownpiece is a long strap on the right-hand side of the halter that goes up behind the ears, over the poll and is buckled to a shorter strap coming up from the left. The throatlatch goes under the throat, and sometimes has a snap or clip that allows the halter to be removed in a manner similar to the bridle. Many halters have another <b>short</b> <b>strap</b> connecting the noseband and the throatlatch.|$|E

40|$|The {{current status}} of the {{mechanical}} and electromagnetic design for the ICRF antenna system for W 7 -X is presented. Two antenna plugins are discussed: one consisting {{of a pair of}} straps with pre-matching to cover the first frequency band, 25 – 38 MHz, and a second one consisting of two <b>short</b> <b>strap</b> triplets to cover a frequency band around 76 MHz. This paper focusses on the two strap antenna for the lower frequency band. Power coupling of the antenna to a reference plasma profile is studied {{with the help of the}} codes TOPICA and Microwave Studio that deliver the scattering matrix needed for the optimization of the geometric parameters of the straps and antenna box. Radiation power spectra for different phasings of the two straps are obtained using the code ANTITER II and different heating scenario are discussed. The potential for heating, fast particle generation, and current drive is discussed. The problem of RF coupling through the plasma edge and of edge power deposition is summarized. Important elements of the complete ion cyclotron resonance heating system are discussed: a resonator circuit with tap feed to limit the maximum voltage in the system, and a decoupler to counterbalance the large mutual coupling between the 2 straps. The mechanical design highlights the challenges encountered with this antenna: adaptation to a large variety of plasma configurations, the limited space within the port to accommodate the necessary matching components and the watercooling needed for long pulse operation...|$|E
