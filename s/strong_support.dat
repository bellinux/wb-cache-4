5|$|By the 1850s Indiana's Republican party, whose adherents {{tended to}} favor the temperance movement, began {{challenging}} the state's Democrats, who supported personal freedom and a limited federal government, for political power. Early temperance legislation in Indiana earned only limited and temporary success. In 1853 Republicans persuaded the state legislature to pass a local option law that would allow township voters to declare their township dry, but it was later deemed unconstitutional. In 1855 a statewide prohibition law was passed, but it met the same fate as the local option. In the decades to come Protestant churches, especially the Methodists, Baptists, Presbyterians, Disciples of Christ, Quakers, and women's groups would continue to support temperance efforts and gave <b>strong</b> <b>support</b> to the mostly dry Republican Party. The Catholics, Episcopalians and Lutherans stood opposed and gave <b>strong</b> <b>support</b> to the wet Democratic Party.|$|E

With a split in the Labor vote, the first LCL government was formed with Richard Layton Butler as Premier.|$|E

With the exception of Wii Music, the games and their sequels have all been highly successful.|$|E

5|$|Batista {{had come}} under {{increasing}} pressure by 1958. His army's military failures, coupled with his press censorship {{and the police}} and army's use of torture and extrajudicial executions, were increasingly criticized both domestically and abroad. Influenced by anti-Batista sentiment among their citizens, the U.S. government ceased supplying him with weaponry, leading him to buy arms from the United Kingdom. The opposition used this opportunity to call a general strike, accompanied by armed attacks from the MR-26-7. Beginning on 9 April, it received <b>strong</b> <b>support</b> {{in central and eastern}} Cuba, but little elsewhere.|$|E

Rieger led a {{campaign}} to eject Smetana from the conductorship and reappoint Maýr, and in December 1872 a petition signed by 86subscribers to the theatre called for Smetana's resignation. <b>Strong</b> <b>support</b> from vice-chairman Antonín Čísek, and an ultimatum from prominent musicians among whom was Antonín Dvořák, ensured Smetana's survival. In January 1873 he was reappointed, with a bigger salary and increased responsibility as Artistic Director.|$|E

5|$|Histological {{examination}} {{reveals that}} pachycephalosaurid domes {{are composed of}} a unique form of fibrolamellar bone which contains fibroblasts that {{play a critical role}} in wound healing, and are capable of rapidly depositing bone during remodeling. Peterson et al. (2013) concluded that taken together, the frequency of lesion distribution and the bone structure of frontoparietal domes, lends <b>strong</b> <b>support</b> to the hypothesis that pachycephalosaurids used their unique cranial structures for agonistic behavior. CT scan comparisons of the skulls of Stegoceras validum, Prenocephale prenes, and several head-striking artiodactyls have also supported pachycephalosaurids as being well-equipped for head-butting.|$|E

Rangel warned that Slaughter had strong ties to the Congressional Black Caucus as well as <b>strong</b> <b>support</b> from labor, women's and pro-choice groups.|$|E
