5|$|In the episode, alien time {{traveller}} the Doctor and {{his companions}} Amy Pond and her husband Rory find themselves trapped in {{what appears to be}} a 1980s hotel with constantly changing corridors. They meet Rita, Howie, Joe, and Gibbis, who have also appeared in the hotel, without any idea how they arrived. The Doctor learns that each hotel room contains the greatest fear of <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> been in the hotel, and that a minotaur-like creature is feeding off their fear.|$|E
5|$|The {{medical costs}} for catastrophic {{injuries}} {{can be extremely}} high—a 2011 estimate from the National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center notes that first-year costs of <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> high tetraplegia, an injury that causes partial or full loss of use in all limbs, is USD $1,044,097, with subsequent years costing $181,328. Many high schools across the United States require students to have an insurance policy, while others offer supplementary insurance to help offset the cost; some schools also request that boosters help families pay for these policies.|$|E

5|$|The most {{effective}} method of avoiding genital infections is by avoiding vaginal, oral, and anal sex. Condom use decreases the risk somewhat. Daily antiviral medication taken by <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> the infection can also reduce spread. There is no available vaccine and once infected, {{there is no}} cure. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) and topical lidocaine {{may be used to}} help with the symptoms. Treatments with antiviral medication such as aciclovir or valaciclovir can lessen the severity of symptomatic episodes.|$|E
5|$|After {{a company}} night {{out to the}} Springfield drag races, Smithers fails to protect Mr. Burns from being harassed by a drunken Lenny. Though he tries to make amends the next day, Smithers again bungles his duties and {{attempts}} to drown himself in the water cooler out of guilt, so Burns suggests he take a vacation. Seeking a replacement who will not outshine him, Smithers purposely selects Homer for the job. Burns soon proves to be ridiculously demanding for <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> not {{devoted his life to}} him like Smithers. After putting up with Mr. Burns' constant abuse for several days, Homer finally snaps and punches Burns. Fearing he has killed the old man, Homer runs away in panic, and hides at home.|$|E
5|$|On atheism, Sagan commented in 1981: An atheist {{is someone}} who is certain that God does not exist, <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> {{compelling}} evidence against the existence of God. I know of no such compelling evidence. Because God can be relegated to remote times and places and to ultimate causes, {{we would have to}} know a great deal more about the universe than we do now to be sure that no such God exists. To be certain of the existence of God and to be certain of the nonexistence of God seem to me to be the confident extremes in a subject so riddled with doubt and uncertainty as to inspire very little confidence indeed.|$|E

50|$|The printer's {{identity}} is unknown. It may <b>have</b> been Gutenberg, <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> worked for him, or <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> bought type {{and other equipment}} from him. Several pieces of evidence show that Gutenberg was linked in some way with the 36-line Bible. In the 1980s cyclotron analysis performed by Richard Schwab and Thomas Cahill established that the ink used {{was similar to that}} used for the 42-line Bible.|$|R
5|$|The Guardian {{reported}} that Dr. Ademola Aremu, the National Treasurer of the Union, {{said that the}} story of Prof. Adewole 'IFA' as we popularly called him is the story of <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> been destined to serve humanity. His achievements as a provost of the college of medicine made him to receive overwhelming support from the university community when he indicated interest to serve on the university governing council and later on as vice chancellor. As vice chancellor, he totally turned the university around in terms of staff and student welfare, academically, University of Ibadan unarguably became the best in Nigeria {{and one of the best}} in Africa.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{the current}} and {{previous}} Worldcon are eligible to nominate new writers for the Campbell Award under the same procedures as the Hugo Awards. Initial nominations are made by members in January through March, at which point a shortlist is made of the five most-nominated writers, with additional nominees possible {{in the case of}} ties. Voting on the ballot of five nominations is performed roughly in April through July, subject to change depending on when that year's Worldcon is held. Writers become eligible once they have a work published anywhere in the world which was sold for more than a nominal amount. While final decisions on eligibility are decided by the WSFS, the given criteria for an author to be eligible are specifically defined as <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> had a written work in a publication which had more than 10,000 readers and which paid the writer at least 3 cents per word and a total of at least 50 US dollars.|$|E
5|$|Reformed Christians {{believe that}} {{immersion}} {{is not necessary}} for baptism to be properly performed, but that pouring or sprinkling are acceptable. Sprinkling is said to symbolize the sprinkling of the blood of Christ {{for the removal of}} the guilt of sin. Only ordained ministers are permitted to administer baptism in Reformed churches, contrary to the allowance for emergency baptism by midwives in Roman Catholic churches, though baptisms performed by non-ministers are generally considered valid. Reformed churches, while rejecting the baptismal ceremonies of the Roman Catholic church (such as the use of chrism, salt, and insufflation), accept the validity of baptisms performed with them on the basis that the substance of baptism remains. They do not rebaptize <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> been baptized using these ceremonies because baptism is never to be repeated.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} report undertaken by Suicide Prevention Australia and the University of New England {{is based on}} the responses of 3, 220 Australian residents who self- identified as having been touched by suicide in some way. Among its key findings, the report highlights that suicide is a public health issue in Australia with 89 % of respondents stating they knew <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> attempted suicide and 85 % knew <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> died by suicide...|$|R

5|$|An {{additional}} eight {{members of}} the parliament are elected from the twelfth constituency. It encompasses the entire country; candidates in this constituency are elected by voters belonging to 22 recognized minorities in Croatia: the Serb minority elects three MPs, the Hungarians and Italians elect one MP each, the Czech and Slovak minorities jointly elect one MP, and all other minorities elect the final two MPs. Minority MPs are elected by simple plurality system (candidates with the most number of votes are elected). The nationality of the voters is listed in the voter registry, which {{is provided by the}} registrar's office that maintains Croatia's vital records. Voter nationalities are normally officially declared by the parents at birth, but any citizen may declare or change that information later on at the registrar's office at least 14 days ahead of elections (not at the polling station). The voter's nationality need not be declared or may be declared as unknown. During elections, voters who have officially declared they belong to one of the recognized minorities in Croatia may choose to vote for either a territorially applicable list or a corresponding national minority list; a voter of unknown or non-declared nationality may vote for either a territorially applicable list or any minority list; a voter who has declared a nationality other than Croat or a recognized minority may vote only for a territorially applicable list (the same as <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> declared themselves a Croat).|$|E
5|$|When {{the gunmen}} {{stop at a}} restaurant, Lou phones the police. They arrive and {{exchange}} gunfire. One suspect is killed while the other manages to escape in his SUV. The police give chase with Lou and Rick tailing and recording. After the gunman's SUV crashes, Lou urges Rick to film the gunman, claiming he is dead. The wounded gunman shoots Rick through the glass and tries to escape but is shot by police. As Rick lies dying, Lou films him and tells him that he cannot work with <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> leverage over him. Nina is awed by the chase footage and expresses her devotion to Lou. The news team discovers that the home invasion was actually a drug deal gone wrong; Nina refuses to report this information to maximize the story's impact. Police try to confiscate the footage for evidence but Nina defends her right to withhold it. Interrogated by Frontieri, Lou fabricates {{a story about the}} men in the SUV following him; Frontieri suspects he is lying, but cannot prove it. Lou hires a team of interns and buys new vans to expand his business.|$|E

50|$|Before the {{institution}} of the praetorship, it was common for the magister equitum to be <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> already served as consul or consular tribune. In this way, the magistracy was held by <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> prior experience with military command. For those <b>who</b> <b>had</b> yet to achieve the highest offices of the Roman state, this appointment was a valuable stepping stone toward those offices. In the later republic, it was common for the magister equitum to be chosen from men of praetorian rank; that is, from those <b>who</b> <b>had</b> held the praetorship, but <b>who</b> <b>had</b> not yet been elected consul.|$|R
