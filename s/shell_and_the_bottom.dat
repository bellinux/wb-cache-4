40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{continue}} {{the study of}} the energy-momentum spectrum of a class of translation invariant, linearly coupled, and massive Hamiltonians from non-relativistic quantum field theory. The class contains the Hamiltonians of E. Nelson and H. Froehlich. One of us previously investigated the structure of the ground state mass <b>shell</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the continuous energy-momentum spectrum. Here we study the continuous energy-momentum spectrum itself up to the two-boson threshold, the threshold for energetic support of two-boson scattering states. We prove that non-threshold embedded mass shells have finite multiplicity and can accumulate only at thresholds. We furthermore establish the non-existence of singular continuous energy-momentum spectrum. Our results hold true for all values of the particle-field coupling strength but only below the two-boson threshold. The proof revolves around the construction of a certain relative velocity vector field used to construct a conjugate operator in the sense of Mourre...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{shows that}} the contour of a sheet blank at all stages of superplastic forming can be {{described}} using universal formulas known as a «superformula» Gielis and «superellipse» Lamé. The work provides information on the values range of the coefficients entering into these formulas. The paper shows the results of approximation {{by means of the}} proposed formulas of shell contours manufactured by superplastic forming by different methods. The application of the «superformula» to approximate the spherical shell contours in the first stage of molding has been tested. The graphs that show the ratio of the ordinates of the contours of the spherical shells and the hemisphere are given. It is shown that the contours of the shells from the AlMg 5 and Pb- 38 %Sn alloys are rejected {{in the direction of the}} formation of parabolas. It was found that the deviations increase with decreasing the coefficient of high-speed hardening of the alloy of the shell. The contour of AMg 6 alloy shells and blanks of variable thickness, with maximum in the central zone, is diverted from the hemisphere towards the ellipse. The first stage of forming in a non-uniform temperature field forms a contour of shells, similar to an ellipse. Forming shells with the ratio of the height (H) and the radius (R) as H = 0, 6 R in the angular zones of the matrix forms intermediate contours of different shapes.

However, the details of factors controlling the isotopic disequilibrium between <b>the</b> <b>shells</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> surrounding <b>bottom</b> seawater (<b>the</b> vital effect) are still ambiguous.

As a result, we can choose suitable species as bottom water proxies by using the inter-individual isotopic variations. In addition, by using the simplified interpretation of the vital effect established in this study, we can reconstruct the &delta; 13 C values of dissolved inorganic carbon in bottom water by correcting foraminiferal isotopic compositions for the isotopic shift resulting from the vital effect. Our findings will allow the use of isotope data for all benthic foraminifera as more reliable proxies for reconstructing past bottom water conditions and evaluating global carbon cycling...|$|R

40|$|The {{current work}} {{is devoted to}} the problem of sound wave {{scattering}} by elastic cylindrical objects in a plain acoustic waveguide. The Multi- Modal Integral Method (MMIM) is proposed, which is based on nonstandard representation of the Green's function. It combines advantages of integral equation and eigenfunction methods and provides a quickly converging and highly accurate solution, taking into account all the waveguide modes up to infinite order. As illustrations of application of this method, acoustic diffraction is calculated from a system of several parallel homogeneous cylinders and from an air-filled cylindrical elastic shell. Numerical solutions are found for various versions of the system of elastic cylinders in a fluid layer with perfectly soft and rigid boundaries. Phase - frequency and amplitude - frequency characteristics are found for modal coefficients of the scattered field. Sharp increase of their amplitudes is found near resonance frequencies of <b>the</b> waveguide <b>and</b> <b>the</b> scattering cylinders. Pictures of the source density {{on the surface of the}} cylinders show that the nature of their distribution strongly depends on <b>the</b> frequency <b>and</b> <b>the</b> mutual location of the cylinders in the waveguide. Field structure near the cylinders reveals that higher-order waveguide modes play a significant role in the scattering process. Spatial distribution of the acoustic power flow near the scattering object is calculated for several frequencies and two sets of elastic properties of the cylinder. It is shown that at the critical frequencies of the waveguide as well as at the internal resonances of the cylinder the acoustic energy flows in closed paths in some regions of the waveguide. Near the internal resonances of the cylinder the closed paths are located in the near vicinity of <b>the</b> scattering object <b>and</b> partially go through its interior. It is suggested that re-radiation of the energy stored in the vortices may contribute to the echo phenomenon. The integral reflection coefficient is calculated for a system waveguide/shell for different values of wall thickness <b>and</b> distance between <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> waveguide <b>bottom.</b> Maxima <b>and</b> minima in <b>the</b> reflection coefficient associated with cut-on frequencies of <b>the</b> waveguide modes <b>and</b> structural resonances of the shell are identified. The calculations show that the conventional definition of target strength in a shallow waveguide is inappropriate. Different kinds of resonances are identified in frequency and angular dependencies of the velocity amplitude of the shell surface. These resonances belong to the following groups: a) critical frequencies of the waveguide modes, b) structural resonances of the elastic shell, c) resonance oscillations of the gas-filled interior of the shell, d) resonance oscillations of the coupled fluid-shell. Application of the Multi-Modal Integral Method (MMIM) to Sound Wave Scattering in an Acoustic Waveguide. Temporal sequences of pictures showing the spatial structure of <b>the</b> total <b>and</b> scattered fields in <b>the</b> near <b>and</b> far field zones are obtained. It is shown that the incident field produces waves of acoustic pressure propagating along the boundary of the scattering object, which, in turn, generate the scattered acoustic field. In the process of propagation, the waves may interact with each other via the fluid or the scattering object. This leads to significant changes of the structure of <b>the</b> acoustic field <b>and</b> of <b>the</b> amount of acoustic energy reflected from the scatterer. It is also shown that, in most cases, standing waves exist between <b>the</b> scatterer <b>and</b> <b>the</b> waveguide boundaries. Accuracy of the Multi-Modal Integral Method is discussed. It is shown that the implementation of the method requires few computer resources for good accuracy of the solution. Thesis (Ph. D.)
