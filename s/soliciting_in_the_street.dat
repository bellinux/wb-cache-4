Under <b>the</b> <b>Street</b> Offences Act 1959, it was a crime for prostitutes to [...] "loiter or <b>solicit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> for <b>the</b> purposes of prostitution". The defendants were calling to men <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> from balconies and tapping on windows. They claimed they were not guilty as they were not <b>in</b> <b>the</b> [...] "street". The judge applied the mischief rule {{to come to the}} conclusion that they were guilty as the intention of the Act was to cover the mischief of harassment from prostitutes.|$|R

60|$|The French have no front gardens; but <b>the</b> <b>street</b> {{is every}} man's front garden.

5000|$|A {{play that}} has {{influenced}} {{the style of}} scene-to-scene stories of Lion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Streets</b> is La Ronde. La Ronde was written by German playwright, Arthur Schnitzler. It is set in 1890's Vienna, and is a dramatically structured play consisting of ten interlocking scenes between pairs of lovers. Each of its ten characters appears in two consecutive scenes, with the Whore appearing twice. Lion <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Streets</b> is similar to this play <b>in</b> <b>the</b> way it is set up. From each scene <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Lion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Streets,</b> one character moves along to he next scene. The difference between La Ronde and Lion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Streets</b> is firstly that Lion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Streets</b> isn't strictly about lovers (one people with something in common, i.e. Relationships.), also {{that there is one}} character (Isobel) who is a [...] "Main Character" [...] and follows each consecutive scene.|$|R
