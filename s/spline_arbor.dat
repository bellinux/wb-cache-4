40|$|An {{analysis}} of the dynamic and stability characteristics of a guided wood cutting <b>spline</b> <b>arbor</b> circular saw is presented. A multibody dynamic model is developed to consider the idling and cutting characteristics. The model considers {{the interaction between the}} blade, the arbor, and the guide pads. The model is capable of analyzing in-plane and out-of-plane edge forces which enables simulation of the cutting performance of the saw. In order to verify the computer model, an experimental test of a guided spline saw during idling run-up is presented. The frequencies and amplitudes of the blade vibrations are documented and plotted. Cutting tests are also conducted and the cutting forces are estimated. The results of a simulation of the idling response of the blade by the computer model and the experimental results are in a good agreement. Factors that significantly affect the characteristics of guided spline saws during cutting are discussed. The computer model is shown to be capable of predicting stable cutting operations of a guided spline saw...|$|E
40|$|Guided splined disks‚Äù {{are defined}} as flat thin disks in which the inner radius of the disk is splined and matches a <b>splined</b> <b>arbor</b> that {{provides}} the driving torque for rotating the disk. Lateral constraint for the disk is provided by space fixed guide pads. Experimental lateral displacement of run-up tests of such a system is presented, and the flutter instability zones are identified. The results indicate that flutter instability occurs at speeds when a backward travelling wave of a mode meets a reflected wave of a different mode. Sometimes, the system cannot pass a flutter zone, and transverse vibrations of the disk lock into that flutter instability zone. The governing linear equations of transverse motion of such a spinning disk, with assumed free inner and outer boundary conditions, are derived. A lateral constraint is introduced and modeled as a linear spring. Rigid body translational and tilting degrees of freedom {{are included in the}} analysis of the total motion of the spinning disk. The eigenvalues of the system are computed numerically, and the flutter instability zones are defined. The results show that the mathematical model can predict accurately the flutter instability zones measured in the experimental tests...|$|R
