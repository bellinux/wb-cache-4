Workshops covered crucial issues such as heatwaves and bushfires, rising costs of water, energy and transport, physical and mental health, and the heightened vulnerability of groups such as the mentally ill, homeless, aged, and infants.

500|$|An {{important}} {{theme of}} the book is the North-South relationship as it influences the extent of federalism in the United States. [...] The book describes how from before the Civil War to well after the Civil Rights Movement the balance of power between protectors of state's rights and defenders of the federal government have battled over resources and power along North-South alliances. [...] Jackson is a detractor of state's rights and feels that the extensive power given to states has slowed our broad distribution of social goods by perpetuating inequality and thus unrest. [...] Dyson also notes that Jackson attempts to bring class to the forefront of the discourse in an effort to offer a political vision toward <b>social</b> <b>equity</b> and equality. [...] He says Jackson views race as the lens to optimally view American history and views economic issues as the hearing aid through which the politics of today can best be heard.|$|E
500|$|A recent UNEP report {{proposes a}} green economy defined {{as one that}} [...] "improves human {{well-being}} and <b>social</b> <b>equity,</b> while significantly reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities": it [...] "does not favor one political perspective over another but works to minimize excessive depletion of natural capital". The report makes three key findings: [...] "that greening not only generates increases in wealth, in particular a gain in ecological commons or natural capital, but also (over a period of six years) produces {{a higher rate of}} GDP growth"; that there is [...] "an inextricable link between poverty eradication and better maintenance and conservation of the ecological commons, arising from the benefit flows from natural capital that are received directly by the poor"; [...] "in the transition to a green economy, new jobs are created, which in time exceed the losses in [...] "brown economy" [...] jobs.

2500|$|Publicly {{sponsored}} {{affordable housing}} projects use public funds or tax breaks {{in order to}} increase the stock of housing available to low income people. In addition, these projects often seek {{to improve the quality of}} the stock, in order to offer [...] "decent, safe, sanitary, and affordable living environments". [...] Green Affordable Housing projects add to those goals by lowering the lifetime cost of units and improving the quality. [...] The concept of the triple bottom line defines sustainability to include economics, <b>social</b> <b>equity</b> and the environment. Affordable housing already addresses economics and <b>social</b> <b>equity.</b> Sustainability measures obviously help the environment, but they can help the economics and <b>social</b> <b>equity</b> of housing projects as well. Housing units with a better design can improve health outcomes. With lower utility costs and improved health outcomes, the projects are more beneficial to low-income households, who are particularly exposed to poor housing quality and increases in general life costs, e.g. for utilities or medical expenses. Economically, sustainable design lowers the lifetime cost of a building. [...] Since the preservation of affordable housing is sensitive to public funding, making affordable housing greener is a logic step to reducing long-term costs and increasing stability. [...] Green design increases the economics, <b>social</b> <b>equity,</b> and environmental impact of affordable housing projects.|$|E
