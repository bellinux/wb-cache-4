After Grove proved himself in spring training, manager Jimmy Dykes gave him his first major test of the season against the New York Yankees in relief of Eddie Smith. He won the game in extra innings, and {{was placed in the}} starting rotation. In 1943, Grove had to deal with issues related to World War II and the selective service.
