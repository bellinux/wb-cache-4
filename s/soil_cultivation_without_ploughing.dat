40|$|Effects {{of various}} agrotechnical {{measures}} on macrostructural {{changes in the}} ploughing layer and subsoil were studied within the period of 2008 – 2010. Soil macrostructure was evaluated {{on the base of}} water stability of soil aggregates. Altogether three variants of soil tillage were established, viz. ploughing to the depth of 0. 22 [*]m (Variant 1), deep soil loosening to the depth of 0. 35 – 0. 40 [*]m (Variant 2), and shallow tillage to the depth of 0. 15 [*]m (Variant 3). Experiments were established on a field with Modal Chernozem in the locality Hrušovany nad Jevišovkou (maize-growing region, altitude of 210 [*]m, average annual sum of precipitation 461 mm). In the first experimental year, winter rape was the cultivated crop and it was followed by winter wheat, maize and spring wheat in subsequent years. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate effects of different methods of tillage on water stability of soil aggregates and on yields of individual crops. An overall analysis of results revealed a positive effect of <b>cultivation</b> <b>without</b> <b>ploughing</b> on water stability of soil aggregates. In the variant with ploughing was found out a statistically significant decrease of this stability. At the same time it was also found out that both minimum tillage and deep soil loosening showed a positive effect on yields of crops under study (above all of maize and winter wheat) ...|$|R

In {{the soil and}} agricultural sciences, infiltration improvement usually involves cultivation to soften the surface <b>soils.</b> However, <b>cultivation</b> can dry the soils, and heavy rainfall can wash away organic-rich surface layers (Osawa et al.

On the other hand, the forest land was higher in most fertility status of the soil physicochemical properties than the cultivated land. This indicates that the grazing land had high biomass that contributed to its high OC content and characterized with minimum <b>soil</b> disturbance. Continuous <b>cultivation</b> <b>without</b> proper <b>soil</b> management in the cultivated field, on the other hand, enhanced deterioration of OC and degradation of other soil physicochemical properties, which accounts for its poor fertility status as compared to the grazing and forest lands.|$|R

This study aimed at evaluating the microbial activity of soils contaminated with picloram and pre-cultivated with phytoremediation species. The experimental design was completely randomized, with three replicates. The treatments were organized in a 5 x 2 factorial scheme, with the first factor being the types of cultivation (autoclaved and non-autoclaved <b>soil</b> <b>without</b> <b>cultivation</b> and <b>soil</b> from the rhizosphere of Urochloa brizantha, Panicum maximum and Zea mays) and the second factor referring to the absence or presence (240 g ha- 1) of picloram. The evolved C-CO 2, microbial biomass carbon and metabolic quotient were estimated. The herbicide altered the evolved C-CO 2, however, it did not affect the microbial biomass carbon and the metabolic quotient in the rhizospheric soils of the species. The cultivation of Zea mays increased the rhizosphere activity. The three plant species affect the soil microbial activity, however, the cultivation of Panicum maximum and Urochloa brizantha cause a lower disturbance on the microbial population, if compared to Zea mays.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Pinus <b>cultivation</b> <b>without</b> {{fertilization}} is {{a common}} practice in southern Brazil, which can induce {{a decline in the}} availability of phosphorus (P) in the soil. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the changes in phosphorus fractions in a Humic Cambisol subjected to continuous Pinus taeda L. <b>cultivation</b> <b>without</b> fertilization. Two forest stands were evaluated, after 16 years of Pinus cultivation (1 st crop) and 49 years (3 rd crop), when soil samples were collected (layers 0 - 10, 10 - 20, 20 - 40, 40 - 60, and 60 - 80 cm) from six trenches per forest. In soil samples, the P contained in organic (Po) and inorganic (Pi) forms was determined by sequential chemical fractionation. Labile inorganic P fractions remained unchanged after the different cultivation periods. However, the labile organic fractions declined from the first to the third cycle (from 70. 6 to 39. 8 mg dm- 3 in the 0 - 10 cm layer), indicating that these forms influence the buffering capacity of labile Pi. The moderately labile organic P acted as a P drain, increasing its percentage of the total, from 34. 7 to 56. 3 %, from the first to the third crop. <b>Soil</b> <b>cultivation</b> for 49 years with Pinus taeda resulted in a reduction of the organic P content, indicating that for this soil use, this P form should be used to diagnose P availability and fertilization requirements...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Water erosion is {{the main}} cause of soil {{degradation}} and is influenced by rainfall, soil, topography, land use, soil cover and management, and conservation practices. The objective {{of this study was to}} quantify water erosion in a Humic Dystrudept in two experiments. In experiment I, treatments consisted of different rates of fertilizer applied to the soil surface under no-tillage conditions. In experiment II, treatments consisted of a no-tillage in natural rangeland, burned natural rangeland and natural rangeland. Forage turnip, black beans, common vetch, and corn were used in rotation in the treatments with crops in the no-tillage during study period. The treatments with crops and the burned rangeland and natural rangeland were compared to a bare <b>soil</b> control, <b>without</b> <b>cultivation</b> and <b>without</b> fertilization. Increasing fertilization rates increased organic carbon content, soil resistance to disintegration, and the macropore volume of the soil, due to the increase in the dry mass of the crops, resulting in an important reduction in water erosion. The exponential model of the ŷ = ae-bx type satisfactorily described the reduction in water and soil losses in accordance with the increase in fertilization rate and also described the decrease in soil losses in accordance with the increase in dry mass of the crops. Water erosion occurred in the following increasing intensity: in natural rangeland, in cultivated natural rangeland, and in burned natural rangeland. Water erosion had less effect on water losses than on soil losses, regardless of the soil management practices...|$|R
