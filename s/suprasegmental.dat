5|$|Beyond {{the letters}} themselves, {{there are a}} variety of {{secondary}} symbols which aid in transcription. Diacritic marks can be combined with IPA letters to transcribe modified phonetic values or secondary articulations. There are also special symbols for <b>suprasegmental</b> features such as stress and tone that are often employed.|$|E
5|$|The {{sound of}} speech can be {{analyzed}} into a combination of segmental and <b>suprasegmental</b> elements. The segmental elements are those that follow each other in sequences, which are usually represented by distinct letters in alphabetic scripts, such as the Roman script. In free flowing speech, there are no clear boundaries between one segment and the next, nor usually are there any audible pauses between words. Segments therefore are distinguished by their distinct sounds which {{are a result of}} their different articulations, and they can be either vowels or consonants. <b>Suprasegmental</b> phenomena encompass such elements as stress, phonation type, voice timbre, and prosody or intonation, all of which may have effects across multiple segments.|$|E
5|$|All spoken {{languages}} have phonemes of {{at least}} two different categories, vowels and consonants, that can be combined to form syllables. As well as segments such as consonants and vowels, some languages also use sound in other ways to convey meaning. Many languages, for example, use stress, pitch, duration, and tone to distinguish meaning. Because these phenomena operate outside of the level of single segments, they are called <b>suprasegmental.</b> Some languages have only a few phonemes, for example, Rotokas and Pirahã language with 11 and 10 phonemes respectively, whereas languages like Taa may have as many as 141 phonemes. In sign languages, the equivalent to phonemes (formerly called cheremes) are defined by the basic elements of gestures, such as hand shape, orientation, location, and motion, which correspond to manners of articulation in spoken language.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{follows the}} line of {{contrastive}} linguistics and aims to analyze the contrast mechanism that differentiates stressed from unstressed syllables, in Brazilian Portuguesa (BP) and Spanish, in relation to duration. The paper aims as well to discuss how of results {{can be useful in}} the construction of teaching materials. Results indicate that duration operates at a more consistent and systematic way as correlate of lexical prominence in Portuguese. By presenting a contrastive analysis between the two languages, this work provides detailed and useful information about <b>suprasegmentals.</b> This contribution can be used both implicitly and explicitly to benefit students and teachers working with both of these languages. Including such information in the elaboration of teaching materials may provide opportunities to enhance learning and facilitate the use of <b>suprasegmentals</b> in L 2...|$|R
25|$|A similar process {{occurs in}} Skolt Sami, where palatalization of consonants and {{fronting}} of vowels is a <b>suprasegmental</b> process applying {{to a whole}} syllable. <b>Suprasegmental</b> palatalization is marked with the letter ʹ, which is a freestanding acute accent, for example in the word vääʹrr 'mountain, hill'.|$|E
25|$|At {{four months}} infants still prefer infant-directed speech to adult-directed speech. Whereas 1-month-olds only exhibit this {{preference}} if the full speech signal is played to them, 4-month-old infants prefer infant-directed speech even when just the pitch contours are played. This shows that between 1 and 4 months of age, infants improve in tracking the <b>suprasegmental</b> {{information in the}} speech directed at them. By 4 months, finally, infants have learned which features {{they have to pay}} attention to at the <b>suprasegmental</b> level.|$|E

40|$|The Importance of <b>Suprasegmentals</b> in Subtitling Based on the {{definition}} and delimitation {{of the term}} <b>suprasegmentals,</b> their importance in conversation will be examined before different possibilities of visualizing paralingual properties in the subtitles are discussed. The subtitling process not only covers the transformation of spoken into written language, it also applies special techniques such as reducing what is heard to the essentials. What is initially a question of intralingual subtitling, reveals further aspects {{in the process of}} translation into another language, because the written product of the target language has not only to meet the oral form and the language varieties in the film (sociolect, dialect etc.), but also needs to take cultural matters into account. Paralingual criteria (intonation, pausing, voice volume, etc.) might have special culture-bound significance. – The outlined issues are discussed by means of examples taken from selected television commercials...|$|R
50|$|The {{family of}} North Huon Gulf {{languages}} is a subgroup of the Huon Gulf languages of Papua New Guinea. It consists of 3 languages, {{all of which}} are distinguished by severe truncation of many inherited roots and the compensatory development of <b>suprasegmentals</b> on vowels: phonemic tone in Yabem and Bukawa (Ross 1993) and nasalization in Kela (Johnson 1994).|$|R
50|$|Phonology also {{includes}} {{topics such as}} phonotactics (the phonological constraints on what sounds can appear in what positions in a given language) and phonological alternation (how the pronunciation of a sound changes {{through the application of}} phonological rules, sometimes in a given order which can be feeding or bleeding,) as well as prosody, the study of <b>suprasegmentals</b> and topics such as stress and intonation.|$|R
25|$|If {{the word}} form is monosyllabic and {{ends in a}} consonant, a non-phonemic weakly voiced or {{unvoiced}} vowel is pronounced after the final consonant. This vowel is e-colored if <b>suprasegmental</b> palatalization is present, but a-colored if not.|$|E
25|$|Diphthongs {{may also}} have two {{variants}} depending on whether they occur in a plain or palatalized environment. This has a clearer effect with diphthongs whose second element is back or central. Certain inflectional forms, including {{the addition of the}} palatalizing <b>suprasegmental,</b> also trigger a change in diphthong quality.|$|E
25|$|Tonal {{languages}} are often stripped of articulation, leaving only <b>suprasegmental</b> {{features such as}} duration and tone, and when whistled retain the spoken melodic line. Thus whistled tonal languages convey phonemic information solely through tone, length, and, to a lesser extent, stress, and most segmental phonemic distinctions of the spoken language are lost.|$|E
40|$|<b>Suprasegmentals</b> are of {{paramount}} importance in spoken English. Yet, these pronunciation features are marginalised in EFL/ESL teaching-learning. This article deals with a study through reflective learning method and  That aims to describe the increase in supramental english skill {{find out if the}} improvements achieved in the english pronounciation. Kemmis and Taggart’s model of action research was adopted. The study involved twenty-four undergraduate students at Muhammadiyah University of Purwokerto, Indonesia. The investigation contained two cycles, each of which comprised three sessions. Data were gathered through observation, recorded conversation, diary, interview, and test. Overall, the study has shown that reflective method using video integrated into communicative activities enhanced student involvement in learning the pronunciation of English <b>suprasegmentals.</b> Students got involved in monitoring and evaluating their own learning. In addition, a majority of the students gave positive response to the instruction. Level of pronunciation mastery rose sharply from only 4. 16 % of students passing the test in the pre-intervention (baseline) to 65. 21 % in first cycle, and 73. 9 % in second cycle.

25|$|ASL, {{like other}} mature signed languages, makes {{extensive}} use of morphology. Many of ASL's affixes are combined simultaneously rather than sequentially. For example, Ted Supalla's seminal work on ASL verbs of motion revealed that these signs consist of many different affixes, articulated simultaneously according to complex grammatical constraints. This differs from the concatenative morphology of many spoken languages, which except for <b>suprasegmental</b> features such as tone are tightly constrained by the sequential nature of voice sounds.|$|E
25|$|Hangul is a {{featural}} alphabet {{written in}} morpho-syllabic blocks, and {{was designed for}} both the Korean and Chinese languages, though the letters specific to Chinese are now obsolete. Each block consists {{of at least one}} consonant letter and one vowel letter. When promulgated, the blocks reflected the morphology of Korean, but for most of the fifteenth century they were organized into syllables. In the twentieth century the morpho-syllabic tradition was revived. The blocks were traditionally written in vertical columns from top to bottom, although they are now commonly written in horizontal rows from left to right as well. Spacing has been introduced to separate words in the Western fashion, and punctuation to indicate clauses and sentences, so that Hangul now transcribes Korean at the levels of feature, segment, syllable, morpheme, word, clause, and sentence. However, the <b>suprasegmental</b> features of tone and vowel length, seen as single and double tick marks {{to the left of the}} syllabic blocks in the image in the next section, have been dropped. Six new letters, including two of Sejong's which had become obsolete, were introduced in North Korea in 1948 in order to make Hangul a perfect morphophonological fit to the Korean language, but they were soon discarded.|$|E

Regarding segmental phonology, as well as lexical <b>suprasegmentals</b> (lexical tone and stress), both the use of two levels of representation and the existence of an international phonetic alphabet have proved to be very useful.
