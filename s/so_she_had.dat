However, a contentious issue that was considered unresolved by the Akali's was the status of Chandigarh, a prosperous city on the Punjab-Haryana border, which Gandhi declared a union territory to be shared as a capital by both the states.|$|E
25|$|The {{music video}} staff {{were unable to}} enter Makuhari Messe before the day the video {{was going to be}} shot, so were unable to hold a trial run. The staff entered the {{building}} at 7:00am on the day, and started rehearsing with Sakanaction band members at 12:00am. From 3:00am onwards, they were able to record 10 takes of the video, however only two takes were successful. Okazaki had difficulty moving between the two locations she appeared in the scene in time, <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> to be transported by a staff member pushing her on a wheel chair. The band decided to release the earlier take of the video, as the second take was taken in the morning. This version was released on the band's Sakanarchive 2007-2011 video album in 2011. An additional video was created by the Tokyo FM radio program School of Lock!, featuring a selection of the 37 best cellphone videos out of 500 submissions by School of Lock! listeners across Japan.|$|E

25|$|James {{reports that}} Kent fought {{for almost two}} hours and that Rivington {{was killed by a}} shot to the head as the French boarded. He states that Kents {{armament}} consisted of twenty 12-pounders, and six 6-pounders on her castles, and that Confiances armament consisted of 20-22 long 8-pounder guns. He speculates that if Kent had carried 18 or 24-pounder carronades instead of the long 6-pounders, she {{might have been able to}} use grapeshot to deter boarding. He further reports that in addition to her crew of 100 or <b>so,</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> some 38 male and three female passengers, including seven or eight passengers that she had picked up at St. Salvador, after a fire there had destroyed the Indiaman Queen on 9 July. Apparently some four or five passengers were among the British dead, and there were also passengers among the wounded. James attributes the crew being overwhelmed by the boarders to a shortage of swords, pikes and pistols.|$|E

It was Varesco who planted them on her and she admits that he is the true owner of the premises. Poirot takes her into the next room where Higgs and Cerberus are waiting. Higgs can handle any dog and took the {{otherwise}} fierce animal out during the raid. Poirot asks Rossakoff to order the obedient dog to drop what it is holding in its mouth and it does so. A small sealed packet of cocaine drops to the ground. A shocked Rossakoff loudly proclaims her innocence and Poirot says he believes her – the true criminal is Alice who is in league with Verasco. She carried the drugs in her large skirt pockets and dropped them into her clients' pockets on the dance floor. When the raid occurred and the lights went out temporarily, Poirot was waiting by Cerberus and heard her put the packet in the dog's mouth – and Poirot took the opportunity to cut off a sample of cloth from her sleeve as proof.|$|E

The three escorting destroyers were detached at 04:14 on 22 May, while the force steamed off Trondheim.

They moved to Colac, Victoria where Charles found a new role as bank manager for the National Bank of Australasia, and they had two children, son [...] Charles Nalder who went on to be a journalist and establish a New Zealand magazine, and daughter Marion.

The ship then resumed ferrying aircraft from Japan to Truk and Kavieng on 1 November. In February–March 1943, she was accompanied by Un'yō. The following month, Un'yō was replaced by Chūyō. En route to Truk, she was again torpedoed by an American submarine; this time, however, the four torpedoes fired by [...] on 9 April failed to explode. Taiyō and Chūyō, escorted by two destroyers departed Truk, bound for Yokosuka, Japan, on 16 April. After another voyage to Truk and Mako, Formosa, the ship was briefly refitted at Sasebo.

500|$|In [...] "Time Is On My Side", Dean discovers Bela {{no longer}} has the Colt. He later gets her {{criminal}} record from England and learns her true name is Abbie. Almost ten years prior, when she was 14, she had her parents killed in exchange for her soul as part of a ten-year deal made with a Crossroads Demon; though Dean believes that she killed them to inherit their fortune and Bela supports this story, the audience is shown a flashback that suggests that she had actually agreed to the deal to escape abuse from her father. Now desperate because her time is running out, Bela tries to kill the Winchesters, but they anticipate her and escape ahead of time. Dean then calls her a few minutes before her deal is up and she confesses to him she tried {{to get out of the}} deal with the Crossroads Demon by trading the Colt. Once she gave it up, however, the deal changed <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> to kill Sam as well. Though Dean refuses her pleas for help, she reveals to him the demon Lilith holds all the contracts brokered by Crossroads Demons, including his own. Bela's deathand her soul's resulting descent into Hellis inevitable, but not shown.|$|E

When she resumed firing, Vampire was no longer visible and Shirayuki targeted Thanet instead at a range of , firing 82 rounds at her. Yugiri opened fire at 03:38 at Thanet [...] away and both ships observed their target slowing down at 03:45. At that same time, Yugiri radioed Hashimoto that [...] "The enemy is two destroyers" [...] <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> spotted Vampire as she fled, although Yugiri lost sight of Vampire 10 minutes later. Sendai, Fubuki, Asagiri, Amagiri, Hatsuyuki and W-1 all subsequently opened fire, mostly at Thanet, although Vampire reported being under fire for a considerable time. All told, the Japanese ships fired 469 rounds at the Allied destroyers, failing to hit Vampire even once. Shirayuki reported that Thanet had sunk at 04:18 and rescued an officer and 30 ratings from the water; another officer and 11 ratings died in the battle. The Japanese did not pursue and Vampire reached Singapore at 10:00 that morning.|$|E

500|$|In {{tandem with}} her studies under Moriarty, in 1919 Fortune had been {{initiated}} into the London Temple of the Alpha et Omega, an occult {{group that had}} developed from the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. Here, her primary teacher was Maiya Curtis-Webb, a longstanding friend of the Firth family. Fortune later claimed that in the period after the First World War, the Order had been [...] "manned mainly by widows and grey-bearded ancients". She was not enamoured with the ceremonial magic system that had been developed by the Golden Dawn, however it did provide her with the grounding {{in the study of}} the Hermetic Qabalah which would exert a great influence over her esoteric world-view. It was also through her involvement in the group that she embraced her family's [...] "Deo, non Fortuna" [...] as her personal magical motto. In January and March 1921 Fortune and Curtis-Webb embarked on a series of experiments in trance mediumship. This culminated in an act of trance mediumship that Fortune conducted in the Somerset town of Glastonbury with her mother and Frederick Bligh Bond. She claimed that in doing <b>so,</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> contacted spirit-entities known as [...] "the Watchers of Avalon" [...] who informed her that Glastonbury had once been the site of an ancient druidic college.

500|$|From 1986 to 1992 Hill {{was one of}} the world's top sport climbers, {{winning over}} thirty {{international}} titles, including five victories at the Arco Rock Master.

In 1990, at the final stage of the World Cup Final, she was one of three competitors and the only woman to reach the top of the wall—and the only climber to complete the hardest move. As Joseph Taylor writes in his history of climbers of Yosemite, [...] "at that moment Lynn Hill was arguably the best climber in the world, male or female". Hill describes this as her most satisfying win because her competition—Isabelle Patissier—received information on how to do the final climb from the men who had already finished it. Moreover, Hill was starting with zero points in the competition because she had made a mistake in the previous competition, <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> to win big or not at all (the World Cup consisted of a series of competitions in which the participants were given points for a variety of climbing techniques). [...] "It took all of my effort and concentration to pull through the route. The moves I had to make were really spectacular, but I managed to do them. I was so excited to get to the top... I proved a point about women and what we're capable of—a lot of the best men had fallen off that route." [...] As a professional climber, Hill was able during this time to support herself by doing what she loved; she made approximately half of her income from climbing competitions and half from sponsorships.|$|E
