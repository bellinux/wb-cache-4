50|$|Chatham County was a <b>swing</b> <b>area</b> {{for much}} of the late 20th century. In the 21st century it has tended to vote much more for the Democratic party than the state as a whole in presidential elections.|$|R
50|$|Eva Pilarová is {{a singer}} {{with a voice}} flowing with {{addition}} of superior singing technique. With the increasing trend are increasingly focuses on the genres of jazz and <b>swing</b> <b>area.</b> In 1977, to continue to act, she signed the Anticharta.|$|R
50|$|The Harbor is for {{children}} ages two to five. It is 2,000ftsq in size. It features a boardwalk, three full-sized play boats, and is surrounded by the flora of the park. It is located between the <b>swing</b> <b>areas</b> of the park.|$|R
50|$|The city of San Diego {{itself is}} more Democratic than the county's average and has voted for Democrats in each presidential {{election}} since 1992. Various cities within the county are <b>swing</b> <b>areas</b> that have split their votes in elections since 2000. Republican strength {{is concentrated in}} North County, {{as well as the}} inland portions.|$|R
50|$|Politically {{the county}} has been a <b>swing</b> <b>area</b> over the past quarter century, but over three {{of the last four}} {{elections}} has trended strongly Republican in Presidential elections (2008 being the exception; though the GOP had the most votes it was by a much smaller margin than the previous 2004 election or the subsequent 2012 and 2016 elections).|$|R
25|$|While North Carolina is {{historically}} a conservative state, Wake County is typically a <b>swing</b> voting <b>area.</b>|$|R
50|$|The city of San Diego {{itself is}} more Democratic than the county's average and has voted for Democrats Clinton, Gore, Kerry, and Obama, respectively, {{in the last}} six presidential elections. With a few exceptions, areas close to the Mexican border tend to be more Democratic, while North County tends be more Republican. In the 2004 presidential election, San Diego, Encinitas, National City, Del Mar, and some other areas voted for John Kerry; San Marcos, Escondido, Carlsbad, Oceanside, Coronado, Santee, Poway, El Cajon, and Vista {{overwhelmingly}} backed George W. Bush. Chula Vista, La Mesa, Lemon Grove, Solana Beach, and Imperial Beach are considered <b>swing</b> <b>areas</b> of the county - Chula Vista and Imperial Beach narrowly backed Al Gore in 2000 but narrowly voted for Bush in 2004, while Solana Beach switched from Bush in 2000 to Kerry in 2004. La Mesa narrowly voted for Bush both times, and Lemon Grove narrowly went Democratic both times. However, all of these <b>swing</b> <b>areas</b> as well as Oceanside voted for Obama in 2008.|$|R
50|$|Safety beam - This beam {{crosses the}} path of the user past the swing side. If interrupted, the {{operator}} assumes that a person has crossed into the <b>swing</b> <b>area,</b> and it is not safe to open the door at full speed. This sensor is ignored once the door has started to open, as then the operator assumes that it is the user having gone through the door that has interrupted the beam.|$|R
50|$|The GOP {{held the}} seat {{for all but}} three years from 1949 to 1983. After 20-year {{incumbent}} Don Clausen was unseated in 1983, the district was a <b>swing</b> <b>area</b> {{for most of the}} next 15 years. The GOP last held the seat in 1998 when U.S. Representative Frank Riggs decided to run for the U.S. Senate. Riggs was replaced by long-time Democratic Assemblyman and State Senator Mike Thompson. Redistricting in 2001 added Democratic-leaning areas of Yolo County.|$|R
50|$|Until 1943 {{the seat}} {{was held by}} non-Labor parties for all but three years. Since then, it has been {{consistently}} marginal, though it was in Labor hands for all but one term from 1943 to 1975. This is {{mainly because of the}} seat's demographics. The Eden area tilts toward the Liberals; most of the area is part of the historically safe Liberal state seat of Bega. In contrast, the Monaro area has traditionally been more of a <b>swing</b> <b>area.</b>|$|R
25|$|The fast-growing I-4 {{corridor}} area, {{which runs}} through Central Florida and connects {{the cities of}} Daytona Beach, Orlando, and Tampa/St. Petersburg, has had a fairly even breakdown of Republican and Democratic voters. The area is often seen as a merging point of the conservative northern portion {{of the state and}} the liberal southern portion, making it the biggest <b>swing</b> <b>area</b> in the state. Since the late 20th century, the voting results in this area, containing 40% of Florida voters, has often determined who will win the state of Florida in presidential elections.|$|R
50|$|The Division of Lindsay has {{bellwether}} status. At every {{federal election}} since its creation in 1984, its winning {{member of parliament}} has been from the party winning government. This has been widely attributed to Lindsay's buildup as an economically sensitive seat. The mortgage belt status of the electorate means fiscal matters such as interest rates, job security, petrol prices and quality of transportation are always critical issues at federal elections. The geographic buildup of the seat consists of Liberal voting areas in the west, Labor voting areas {{in the east and}} <b>swing</b> <b>areas</b> in the centre.|$|R
50|$|Party support varies between {{different}} parts of the riding. The consistently best areas for the Ontario New Democratic Party (NDP) are Old Ottawa South, the Glebe, and Centretown. Old Ottawa South and the Glebe are also the main Green party areas. The suburban far south and west of the riding around Hog's Back and Carlingwood Park, the large homes near the Civic Hospital, the expensive homes and apartments by the Rideau Canal, and the more expensive downtown condos are the most strongly Liberal and Conservative <b>areas.</b> The major <b>swing</b> <b>areas</b> are the western portions of the riding such as Hintonburg and Westboro: while traditionally Liberal, these neighbourhoods have recently become stronger for the NDP.|$|R
25|$|Democratic strongholds in {{the state}} include the Santa Fe Area, various areas of the Albuquerque Metro Area (such as the {{southeast}} and central areas, including the affluent Nob Hill neighborhood and {{the vicinity of the}} University of New Mexico), Northern and West Central New Mexico, and most of the Native American reservations, particularly the Navajo Nation. Republicans have traditionally had their strongholds in the eastern and southern parts of the state, the Farmington area, Rio Rancho, and the newly developed areas in the Northwest mesa. Albuquerque's Northeast Heights have historically leaned Republican, but have become a key <b>swing</b> <b>area</b> for Democrats in recent election cycles. While registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans by nearly 200,000, New Mexico voters have favored moderate to conservative candidates of both parties at the state and federal levels.|$|R
50|$|The Golf Club {{purchased}} a practice ground in 1977 for £10,000 and an extension {{was built to}} the clubhouse six years later. Abergele Golf Club held its first national tournament, the Welsh Boys Championship, in 1984. In the following year the owners brought land {{on the east side}} of the estate to expand the course and a new clubhouse was opened by the President W. Glyn Parry J.P. and the Lady President Pat K. Francis J.P. in 1997. A new putting green was opened in 1998, and in the same year, the first tee was constructed. The Professional's Shop had been dismantled by 1999 and a <b>swing</b> <b>area</b> and golf academy was established on the site. Between 2002 and 2003 the course was reconstructed by David Williams to meet United States Golf Association standards.|$|R
5000|$|Philadelphia is the Democratic {{stronghold of}} the state, often {{delivering}} huge margins for the Democrats in statewide elections. Other urban areas, such as Pittsburgh, lean Democratic as well. Like most states, Pennsylvania's rural areas {{tend to be}} more conservative and support Republicans. The resulting political map of Pennsylvania is therefore a red [...] "T" [...] {{in the center of the}} state with the Pittsburgh and Philadelphia areas a strong blue. In more recent years, the traditionally Democratic-voting areas in southwestern Pennsylvania have become much more Republican (especially after 2004), similar to other coal country areas in West Virginia and Kentucky. By 2016, counties that once voted for John Kerry in 2004 in the Pittsburgh area supported Donald Trump by more than 60%. The true <b>swing</b> <b>areas</b> of the state are the suburbs of the large cities, notably Philadelphia, which change year to year. The reason for this is the relatively moderate social and fiscal positions held by the citizens of the suburbs.|$|R
25|$|Along {{with being}} the capital of Canada, Ottawa is {{politically}} diverse in local politics. Most of the city has traditionally supported the Liberal Party. Perhaps the safest areas for the Liberals are the ones dominated by Francophones, especially in Vanier and central Gloucester. Central Ottawa is usually more left-leaning, and the New Democratic Party have won ridings there. Some of Ottawa's suburbs are <b>swing</b> <b>areas,</b> notably central Nepean and, despite its francophone population, Orléans. The southern and western parts {{of the old city}} of Ottawa are generally moderate and swing to the Conservative Party. The farther one goes outside the city centre like to Kanata and Barrhaven and rural areas, the voters tend to be increasingly conservative, both fiscally and socially. This is especially true in the former Townships of West Carleton, Goulbourn, Rideau and Osgoode, which are more in line with the conservative areas in the surrounding counties. However, not all rural areas support the Conservative Party. Rural parts of the former township of Cumberland, with a large number of Francophones, traditionally support the Liberal Party, though their support has recently weakened.|$|R
50|$|The crane {{stands to}} the {{northwest}} of the mill shed, the timber arm able to <b>swing</b> across this <b>area</b> of the site lifting logs to the platform. The motor is housed in a small shed near the crane.|$|R
50|$|McIntyre Park on Taylor Street was redeveloped {{beginning}} in October 2011. Funded {{by a grant}} from the Department of Housing and Urban Development at a cost of $83,000, the park upgraded its basketball court, seating <b>area,</b> <b>swings</b> and other playground equipment.|$|R
50|$|Lake Hollifield Complex: Located between Tucker Student Center and University Commons and {{is named}} after Mr. and Mrs. Hugh H. Hollifield. The complex {{features}} a jogging track, seating <b>areas,</b> <b>swings,</b> and the Lake Hollifield Bell Tower, which contains a 48 bell carillon.|$|R
5000|$|Camping {{facilities}} include 47 tent/trailer {{sites and}} 24 lean-tos, flush toilets, hot showers, and a dump station. Other facilities include a small picnic area {{located on a}} bluff above the lake, a stone pavilion for group gatherings, a volleyball <b>area,</b> <b>swings,</b> and shore access.|$|R
50|$|Four Mile Trail is a {{moderate}} to strenuous trail leading from Yosemite Valley to Glacier Point. The trail {{begins at the}} valley floor west of the <b>Swinging</b> Bridge recreation <b>area,</b> and climbs the south side 4.8 mi up to Glacier Point, an elevation change of 3200 ft.|$|R
50|$|Centennial Lakes Park is a 24 acre {{park and}} {{man-made}} pond {{located in the}} southeast portion of Edina, Minnesota, United States. The park features more than 1.5 mi of paved pathways meandering around a 10 acre lake and interspersed with landscaped grounds, formal and informal seating <b>areas,</b> <b>swinging</b> benches and fountains.|$|R
30|$|For these control methods, {{the only}} input signal for the DR {{controller}} is the frequency deviation, and the tie-line <b>swing</b> between the <b>areas</b> is not considered. Therefore, these DR control strategies aim at only restoring the area frequency. These control strategies {{are not good}} for damping inter-area oscillations and stabilizing the frequency in different areas.|$|R
50|$|With Simons whip, {{players can}} attack enemies in eight {{directions}} {{with the use}} of the control pad. By holding down the attack button, the whip will go limp and can be waved around with the control pad, which can be used to block projectiles. The length and power of the whip can be increased up to two levels by collecting an item called the Morning Star. The whip is not only used for fighting, but also for latching onto rings to <b>swing</b> over <b>areas</b> that are too wide or dangerous for the player to jump across. In addition to jumping, the player can control Simon to move while crouching.|$|R
2500|$|Tunnel Field is {{the primary}} {{recreational}} site in the township with several baseball and softball diamonds and soccer fields. [...] Tunnel also has a play <b>area</b> (including <b>swings</b> and play <b>area),</b> a basketball court and concession stand. [...] The field is located by Route 94 and is divided by the Lackawanna Cut-Off and is connected through an old tunnel (hence the name).|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to several <b>swing</b> sets, sand <b>areas</b> and other various playground equipment {{for children of}} all ages, the park also contains lighted tennis courts, two ball fields, a lake with paddle boats, covered and uncovered picnic areas, many picturesque paths and bridges, an adjacent Aquatic Center {{as well as the}} adjacent Pullen Arts Center and Theatre In the Park.|$|R

5000|$|Swing was {{originated}} by David Butler, {{a political}} science academic at Nuffield College, Oxford. In a contribution to The British General Election of 1945 he wrote [...] "this measurement of 'swing', admittedly imperfect, does give us a broad idea of the movement of opinion from Conservative to Labour" [...] {{and went on to}} compare the <b>swings</b> in each <b>area</b> of the country.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The {{election}} showed large <b>swings</b> in Mid-Levels <b>areas</b> in Hong Kong Island and New Territories West, {{particularly in}} Tsuen Wan, Tuen Mun, Kwai Tsing, Tin Shui Wai, and Tseung Kwan O in New Territories East, but {{the rural areas}} as well as urban areas in Sheung Shui, Tai Po, Sha Tin and Wong Tai Sin showed a small swing back to the pro-democrats.|$|R

50|$|Storrs Park {{is a small}} {{recreation}} area for the community, it {{is located at the}} junction of Storrs Lane and Lee Moor Lane. The park consists of a few children's <b>swings</b> and an <b>area</b> of grass on land leased and maintained by Bradfield Parish Council. There is no public transport for the hamlet, although the 762 school bus service passes through to take pupils to Bradfield School at Worrall.|$|R
50|$|Temperatures in North Pole {{are heavily}} {{affected}} {{by the amount of}} sunlight with almost no lag effect from solar radiation. North Pole's Santa Claus House is actually closed during the week in January and February due to extreme cold in those months. Due to being landlocked and protected by mountain ranges from marine influences, North Pole, much {{like the rest of the}} Alaskan Interior, sees little seasonal lag and much greater seasonal temperature <b>swings</b> than <b>areas</b> along the coast such as Anchorage, with winters that can dip to many tens of degrees below zero F with average lows remaining below 0 from November 5 to March 18, and summers that see many days in the 70s, 80s, and on occasion, even 90s F.|$|R
50|$|The Republican lock on Pennsylvania was {{permanently}} {{broken in}} the era after World War II, and Pennsylvania became a somewhat less powerful state in terms of electoral votes and number of House seats. Pennsylvania adopted its fifth and current constitution in 1968; the new constitution established a unified judicial system and allows governors and the other statewide elected officials to serve two consecutive terms. Between 1954 and 2012, each party consistently won two straight gubernatorial elections before ceding control to the other party. In presidential elections, the Republican Party won Pennsylvania in seven of the eleven elections between 1948 and 1988, but Democrats have won the state in every presidential election from 1992 to 2012. When Democratic presidential nominee Hubert Humphrey won Pennsylvania's electoral votes in 1968, {{he became the first}} non-Republican since 1824 to win Pennsylvania's votes without winning the presidential election. After having the second most electoral votes since the 18th century, Pennsylvania was eclipsed in electoral votes by California in 1964. Texas and Florida also now have more electoral votes, while New York also has more electoral votes and Illinois has the same number of electoral votes (and a slightly larger population). As of 2014, Pennsylvania is generally considered to be an important swing state in both presidential and congressional elections, and Pennsylvania has a Cook PVI of D+1. Since the 1990s, Republicans have usually controlled both houses of the legislature, while candidates from both parties have been elected to the statewide offices of governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, treasurer, and auditor general. Democrats generally win the cities and Republicans win the rural areas, with the suburbs voting for both parties and often acting as the key <b>swing</b> <b>areas.</b>|$|R
50|$|The lake has boats {{available}} for hire, along with safety gear such as life saving flotation jackets and devices. Fishing is permitted with payment of a licensing fee. The lake has floating pontoon platforms for visitors and boaters, and ghats for sitting and relaxing. Landscaped parks, sight-seeing walking trails and jogging tracks, over-water bridges, bush land, children's <b>swings</b> and play <b>area,</b> visitor's car park and toilets, and other amenities are available. There is no entry fee {{to use these}} areas.|$|R
50|$|Players may {{occasionally}} wish to bend around large {{objects or}} {{to take a step}} away from large objects which will interfere with a normal swing, even on fairways. However, it is illegal to take a step away from the final resting spot of the ball towards the hole. If the ball comes to rest adjacent to the hole, players are allowed to pick up the ball, but and allowing them to step and lean towards the object proved to be detrimental to the spirit of the game, as people chose to lean in for an easy shot instead of putting with the ball. This was particularly a problem with tall and lanky players, as stepping and leaning was only intended as a mechanism to allow players to <b>swing</b> from <b>areas</b> near interfering objects such as bushes and trees.|$|R
