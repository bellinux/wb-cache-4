500|$|Assigned to the North America and West Indies Station, the {{highlight}} of the ship's service in the Caribbean was the capture of the German blockade runner [...] in the Mona Passage between the islands of Hispaniola and Puerto Rico on the night of 8/9 March 1940. Initially intercepted by the light cruiser , the crew of Hannover disabled their steering gear and set the ship on fire. Assiniboine took the burning ship under tow to prevent her from entering the waters of the neutral Dominican Republic while the cruiser <b>sprayed</b> <b>water</b> on the fire. The two ships swapped roles in the morning and the destroyer put some of her crew aboard Hannover to help Dunedins boarding party fight the fire while the cruiser towed the freighter to Kingston. Assiniboine arrived in Halifax on 31 March for a refit.|$|E

40|$|The {{physical}} characteristic test of broiler ration pelleted that added of onggok as binder with <b>water</b> <b>spraying</b> process ABSTRACT. Pellet {{is a kind}} of solidified and mechanically compressed feed. Problem frequently rise is that pellet shape is easily damaged, brittle, and broken during production, transportation and storage processing. The purpose this study was to know the influence of onggok addition as binding agent with 5 % <b>water</b> <b>spraying</b> on the {{physical characteristic}} of pellet form ration. The data were analyzed by analyzed of variance and the significant experiment results would be examined by orthogonal contrast test. The treatments consist from the first experiment were: A 1 = basal ration + 0 % <b>spraying</b> <b>water,</b> A 2 = basal ration + 5 % <b>spraying</b> <b>water,</b> A 3 = basal ration + 10 % <b>spraying</b> <b>water</b> and A 4 = basal ration + 15 % <b>spraying</b> <b>water.</b> The best result from the first experiment would be used for the second experiment, the treatments second experiment were: R 1 = basal ration + 5 % <b>spraying</b> <b>water</b> + 0 % onggok, R 2 = basal ration + 5 % <b>spraying</b> <b>water</b> + 2 % onggok, R 3 = basal ration + 5 % <b>spraying</b> <b>water</b> + 4 % onggok and R 4 = basal ration + 5 % <b>spraying</b> <b>water</b> + 6 % onggok. The parameters were water content, water activity, specific gravity, loose bulk density, compressed bulk density, angle of repose, modulus of fineness, average particle sizes and the durability of pellet form. The conclusion of the experiment that added of onggok as binder significant influenced of the characteristic physical pellet, i. e. : increased loose bulk density, compressed bulk density, modulus of fineness, average particle sizes, and durability of pellet, but decreased specific gravity, water content, angle of repose and water activity...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} work was to evaluate phytotoxicity of mesotrione in poppy (Papaver somniferum). The amount of <b>spraying</b> <b>water</b> (150, 300 and 450 [*]l per hectare) was compared as well. In the end, the different growth stimulators (Atonik – 0. 6 [*]l .  ha− 1, Route – 0. 8 [*]l .  ha− 1) and the adjuvants (Atplus 463 – 0. 5 % solution, Silwet 77 – 0. 1 [*]l .  ha− 1) wre tested. Degree of phytotoxicity of individual va­riants was assessed by measuring chlorophyll fluorescence (parameter: maximum quantum yield of electron transport in photosystem II - QY) in 1 st to 21 st day after treatment. The results showed that the application of mesotrione caused phytotoxicity on poppy plants. The most significant phy­to­to­xi­ci­ty is evident at doses of 450 [*]l <b>spraying</b> <b>water</b> per hectare. Addition of growth stimulators and adjuvants increases the phytotoxicity (decreases the value of QY) compared to the herbicide application itself. The mesotrione reduced the weight of dry plants by 15 [*]% (150 [*]l of <b>spraying</b> <b>water),</b> 1 [*]% (300 [*]l of <b>spraying</b> <b>water)</b> and 64 [*]% (450 [*]l of <b>spraying</b> <b>water)</b> compared to control variant...|$|R

The rally was triggered by Park's adopting business-friendly labour policies and a decision to require middle and high schools to use only state-issued history textbooks in classes starting in 2017, combined with plans to make labour markets more flexible by giving employers more leeway in dismissing workers. Security forces fired tear gas and <b>sprayed</b> <b>water</b> cannons into the crowd when protesters attempted to break through police barricades.|$|E

40|$|On-line <b>spray</b> <b>water</b> cooling (OSWC) of electric-resistance-welded (ERW) steel pipes {{can replace}} the {{conventional}} off-line heat treatment process {{and become an}} important and critical procedure. The OSWC process improves production efficiency, decreases costs, and enhances the mechanical properties of ERW steel pipe, especially the impact properties of the weld joint. In this paper, an annular OSWC process is investigated based on an experimental simulation platform that can obtain precise real-time measurements of {{the temperature of the}} pipe, the water pressure and flux, etc. The effects of the modes of annular <b>spray</b> <b>water</b> cooling and related cooling parameters on the mechanical properties of the pipe are investigated. The temperature evolutions of the inner and outer walls of the pipe are measured during the <b>spray</b> <b>water</b> cooling process, and the uniformity of mechanical properties along the circumferential and longitudinal directions is investigated. A heat transfer coefficient model of <b>spray</b> <b>water</b> cooling is developed based on measured temperature data in conjunction with simulation using the finite element method. Industrial tests prove the validity of the heat transfer model of a steel pipe undergoing <b>spray</b> <b>water</b> cooling. The research results can provide a basis for the industrial application of the OSWC process in the production of ERW steel pipes...|$|R
40|$|Dioxins in the {{combustion}} gas of {{municipal solid waste}} incinerators (MSWIs) are resynthesized when {{the combustion}} gas passes from the outlet exaust gas boiler to the outlet gas duct. The objective {{of the study was}} to estimate if the suppression of the formation of dioxins depends on the inlet gas temperature and diameter and/or temperature of droplet <b>spray</b> <b>water</b> using an actual incinerator operation data. The dioxin formation and/or the quenching temperature is revealed using the Altwicker theory equation with the information of inlet gas temperature and droplet <b>spray</b> <b>water.</b> The evaporation rate of a <b>spray</b> <b>water</b> droplet also can be estimated using the Mizutani theory. The highest dioxin formation was found at 350 degrees C; thereafter, it decreased quickly. When an area of 500 microm for droplet-formed dioxins is defined as 100 %, the values of formed dioxins for 400, 300, 200 and 100 microm droplet areas are estimated as 71, 41, 25 and 18 %, respectively. It is revealed that the smaller size of droplet <b>spray</b> <b>water</b> and lower inlet gas temperature enable the decrease in dioxin formation. The decreased dioxin formation and/or the lower quenching temperature is revealed using the Altwicker theory equation with the information of inlet gas temperature and droplet <b>spray</b> <b>water</b> size...|$|R
