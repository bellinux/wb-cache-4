40|$|The pollen grains have a {{definite}} shape, size, colour, structure for each species, genus {{and family and}} these characters are useful for systematical botany. The pollen has nutritive properties due to its content: proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, vitamins, hormones and minerals. In the Romanian flora vegetate three species of Sambucus, but only S. nigra L. (elder or black elder) supplies a vegetal medical product, <b>Sambuci</b> <b>flos</b> or elder flowers, whereas the others species S. ebulus L. (dwarf elder) and S. racemosa L. (mountain elder or red elder) are considered adulterations. The pollen of Sambucus species were already studied using optical microscopy (Tarnavschi et al.), but the images are in one single layout, therefore the structure details cannot be easily notice. In this context the pollen grains of the three species already mentioned above were studied by SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy). The results demonstrated that this pollen have a small-middle size, oblat-sphaeroidal-prolat shape, threecolpat and the exine adornments are of reticulate type, haemitectate with sticks in the meshs of polygonale net. The flavonoids content is lower than in others species (0. 146 - 0. 564 %). The SEM analyse of Sambucus pollen allow a reliable identification of the genus but less for the species...|$|E
40|$|Cílem této práce bylo zjistit obsah flavonoidů v květech jedenácti vyšlechtěných kultivarů bezu černého, určit zdali jsou mezi nimi statisticky významné rozdíly a vypracovat přehled obsahových látek a účinků květů. Droga <b>Sambuci</b> nigrae <b>flos</b> se v terapii užívá zejména pro svůj obsah flavonoidů a hydroxyskořicových kyselin jako prostředek při nachlazení, onemocněních močového ústrojí a dýchacích cest. Její prospěšnost potvrdily i studie v rámci zkoumání antibakteriální a antivirové aktivity, diabetu a obezity, účinků na imunitní systém a též ochrany před UV zářením. Obsah flavonoidů byl stanoven spektrofotometricky metodou podle Českého lékopisu 2009, článku <b>Sambuci</b> nigrae <b>flos.</b> Výsledky byly statisticky vyhodnoceny testem ANOVA a Bonferroniho testem. Požadavek Českého lékopisu 2009 na minimální obsah flavonoidů 0, 80 % splnily květy z kultivarů: Albida, Heidegg 13, Riese auß Voßloch, Sambu, Samdal, Sampo a Samyl. Naopak by lékopisu nevyhověly květy kultivarů: Allesö, Aurea, Dana a Juicy. Nejvyšší obsah flavonoidů byl zjištěn v květech kultivaru Riese auß Voßloch s hodnotou 1, 3603 %, zatímco nejnižší u kultivaru Dana s obsahem 0, 3598 %.

The aim of {{this work}} was {{to find out the}} content of {{flavonoids}} in the flowers of eleven cultivars of black elder (Sambucus nigra L.) and determine if their contents differ according to the statistical significance.

Dr. Jirina Spilková, CSc Title of Thesis Microscopy of Elderberry {{flowers from}} {{cultivated}} varieties. Sambucus nigra L. (Sambucaceae) {{is an important}} medicinal plant. Flowers and fruits are used in folk medicine, pharmaceutical and food industries. Drug <b>Sambuci</b> nigrae <b>flos</b> has perspiratory and diuretic effect. It is a component of many tea blends used for colds and infections of the urinary tract. It is also used as a flavor and appearance korigens. More recent studies have observed the effects of antioxidant, antibacterial and antiviral and influence on type 2 diabetes. The Flowers {{are used in the}} food industry as flavoring in korigens syrups, jams and beverages. The flowers contain flavonoids (0. 7 to 3. 5 %), specially flavonols and their glycosides derived from quercetin (rutin, isokvercitrin, hyperoside, kvercitrin). The flowers also contain small amounts of essential oils, triterpenes and sterols, mucilage and calcium oxalate. Elderberry flowers are harvested from plants growing wild in the countryside. Flowers of cultural varieties that have been selected and bred for fruit production are subject of farmacognostic review, which also includes [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the stability of}} rutin in the inflorescences of the elder during processing. Elder (Sambucus nigra L.) is a medicinal plant that was used for medical purposes as early as in the Middle Ages. Both flowers (<b>Flos</b> <b>Sambuci)</b> and fruit (Fructus Sambuci) of the elder are {{on the list of}} official medicinal products of the State Institute for Drug Control. The main active phenolic substance is flavonoid rutin. Flavonoids are phenolic substances of plant origin. Among the best known properties of these substances is their antioxidant activity. They protect the low density blood lipoproteins from the oxidation modifications that cause the development of arteriosclerosis and hypertension. As a medical plant, the elder is used especially for the preparation of a medicinal drink. It is also commonly used as a material for the preparation of syrup. This product serves as a basis for a refreshing and tasty drink and lately is has also started to be sold in shops. For comparison, five single-flower syrups from the elderflower by different producers were bought. A method of preparation of the elderflower syrup was devised, based in one case on frozen elder inflorescences and in the other on dried inflorescences. The plant material came from wildly growing shrubs and it was collected in June 2013. Altogether, 8 syrups were prepared in the laboratory, 4 of them from fresh material and 4 from dried material. Two different methods were used. The first one was based on extraction using sugar solution, the second one on extraction using water solution where sugar was added afterwards. Another added substance was ethanol. The method for measuring the amount of rutin in the samples was a combination of two extraction steps. The first step was the usual exraction using aqueous methanol and the second step was extraction using a solid sorbent (SPE). The analysis of fresh and dried material concluded that dried elderflowers contain many times more rutin than fresh elder. Among the commercially produced syrups, the "Kitl Syrob Bezový" contained most rutin; a little less rutin was found in "Hamé Bylinný sirup Bezový květ". The concentration of rutin in the syrups prepared in the laboratory was much higher than in the commercial products. By using different methods of syrup preparation and their subsequent analysis, {{it was found that the}} syrups prepared from the dried inflorescences contained a higher amount of rutin than the syrups produced in the same way, but from frozen material. Addition of a small amount of ethanol had no effect on extraction of rutin from inflorescences. Free quercetin, which indicate a decomposition of rutin, wasn´t found in any of produced syrups. The produced syrups were used for the preparation of a drink and then underwent sensory analysis. The paired two-sided preference test included pairs of drinks consisting of a fresh elder drink and dried elder drink. The results showed that the evaluators preferred syrups from dried elderflowers in two of the cases, while in the other two evaluated pairs, the results were not statistically significant. In all cases, the evaluators most often found small and middle differences. The gained results show that the best method of syrup preparation uses dried plant material and sucrose solution as the extraction agent. The syrup prepared in this way contained most rutin and at the same time showed the smallest losses of this substance, which is beneficial to human health. Furthermore, it also tasted better in comparison with syrup prepared in the same way, but from fresh material...|$|R
