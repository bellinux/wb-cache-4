50|$|The ExxonMobil {{chemical}} plant produces approximately 750,000 tonnes of chemical products every year. The initial stage {{for many of}} the chemical products was the <b>steam</b> <b>cracker</b> (shut and dismantled in 2013), which took a feedstock of heavy naphtha or gas oil from the refinery to produce basic chemical building blocks: ethylene, propene and butene. This plant is now demolished, with Ethylene shipped directly in from a supplier; the propene and butene streams from the petroleum side of the refinery are used as feedstocks, mainly for the higher olefins plant and the isobutylene plant.

50|$|Polybutene {{is similar}} to but {{different}} from polyisobutylene (PIB). Polybutene is typically made from cat cracker mixed C4s (after the stream is Merox treated to remove sulfur and amines, and contain 1-butene, 2-butene, and isobutylene. Ethylene <b>steam</b> <b>cracker</b> C4s are also used as supplemental feed for polybutene. On the other hand, PIB is produced from essentially pure isobutylene made in a C4 complex of a major refinery. The presence of isomers other than isobutylene can have several effects including: 1) lower reactivity due to steric hindrance at the terminal carbon in, e.g., manufacture of polyisobutenyl succinic anhydride (PIBSA) dispersant manufacture; 2) the molecular weight—viscosity relationships of the two materials may also be somewhat different.|$|E
50|$|The {{importance}} of catalytic dehydrogenation of paraffin hydrocarbons to olefins {{has been growing}} steadily in recent years. Light olefins, such as butenes, are important raw materials for the synthesis of polymers, gasoline additives and various other petrochemical products. The cracking processes especially fluid catalytic cracking and <b>steam</b> <b>cracker</b> produce high-purity mono-olefins, such as 1-butene or butadiene. Despite such processes, currently more research is focused on developing alternatives such as oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) for two reasons: (1) undesired reactions take place at high temperature leading to coking and catalyst deactivation, making frequent regeneration of the catalyst unavoidable, (2) it consumes {{a large amount of}} heat and requires high reaction temperatures. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of n-butane is an alternative to classical dehydrogenation, steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking processes.|$|E
30|$|It {{could have}} been easier {{to fill the gap}} by {{reconfiguring}} the <b>steam</b> <b>cracker,</b> but the <b>steam</b> <b>cracker</b> does not provide flexibility of operation and it has high energy consumption.

According to Ren et al. [89], the pyrolysis section of a naphtha <b>steam</b> <b>cracker</b> alone consumes about 65  % of the total process energy and contributes to about 75  % of the total energy loss.|$|E
30|$|In the past, {{propylene}} {{was produced}} from steam cracking of naphtha and, as a result, propylene {{was available in}} substantial amounts. However, most modern <b>steam</b> <b>crackers</b> use ethane-based feed in place of heavy liquids leading to less propylene [19]. Consequently, {{it is expected that}} propylene production from <b>steam</b> <b>crackers</b> will further decrease {{as a result of the}} shift to ethane-based feeds. The knock-on effect is that more naphtha will be available as feedstock for the production of propylene via catalytic cracking and this can contribute to reducing the gap between the high demand and low supply of the propylene. The demand for propylene from FCC is growing at a faster rate than global FCC capacity and, therefore, propylene yields from FCC need to increase to keep up with demand.|$|R

Nevertheless, the propylene output rates from ethane-fed crackers are negligible.|$|R
30|$|Global {{propylene}} demand trends remain strong, {{and with}} the change toward lighter feedstocks in modern <b>steam</b> <b>crackers</b> {{there will be a}} growing dependence on the FCC to balance the supply side of the propylene equation. Some of the technologies described in this review are those that have been taken to the commercial stage such as DCC and HS–FCC, and are by no means an exhaustive list because there is a rising interest and ongoing research in applying special reactors and catalysts to control the yield of olefins and improve energy efficiency. The future development of catalytic olefin technologies would be strongly affected by the market forces and feedstock cost competition.|$|R
30|$|This review {{looks at}} the main {{processes}} available {{for the production of}} light olefins with a focus on maximizing the production of propylene. Maximization of propylene production has become the focus of most refineries because it is in high demand and there is a supply shortage from modern <b>steam</b> <b>crackers,</b> which now produce relatively less propylene. The flexibility of the fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) to various reaction conditions makes it possible as one of the means to close the gap between supply and demand. The appropriate modification of the FCC process is accomplished by the synergistic integration of the catalyst, temperature, reaction-residence time, coke make, and hydrocarbon partial pressure. The main constraints for maximum propylene yield are based on having a suitable catalyst, suitable reactor configuration and reaction conditions.|$|R

40|$|Ethylene {{cracking}} technology providers have continuously {{worked to}} improve the energy efficiency of their cracker designs. As a result, current designs are very complex and highly heat integrated. Although technology vendors claim that the three different designs for the cold section of a <b>steam</b> <b>cracker,</b> i. e. demethanizer first and the depropanizer first, have roughly the same energy efficiency, simulation results obtained with Aspen show that significant differences exist. For a naphtra <b>steam</b> <b>cracker</b> with an annual ethylene production capacity of 10 (6) ton ethylene the demethanizer first design is slightly more energy efficient than a depropanizer or a deethanizer first design.

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} trend to use bio-polyethene and bio-polypropene in Europe. However there is at present very limited production capacity available for producing the base chemicals {{that are used in}} polymerization processes. Therefore a production route for green ethene, propene and 1, 3 -butadiene is evaluated on a pilot plant scale starting from triglyceride and fatty acid based biomass. The first step consists of removing suspended solids, solubilized metals and phosphorus from the feedstock. The next step is catalytic hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of the purified product to reduce oxygen to less than 0. 1 wt%. Finally the HDO product is cracked into light olefins in a steam cracking pilot plant. For a coil outlet temperature of 835 degrees C and a steam dilution of 0. 45 kg kg(- 1) the product yields amount to 38 wt% ethene, 20 wt% propene and 7. 5 wt% 1, 3 -butadiene. This is significantly higher than the yields that are obtained when cracking classical fossil based naphtha under similar process conditions. Moreover, the fouling tendency of the renewable feed is also a factor of 2 smaller than that for naphtha. The pilot plant data have been used to scale up to a commercial scale <b>steam</b> <b>crackers</b> by applying a validated fundamental kinetic model, indicating the high potential of this route for producing green high value chemicals with a 20 % reduction in CO 2 emissions as compared to a naphtha cracker...|$|R
40|$|The {{petroleum}} industry is gradually shifting from using naphtha to ethane as its feedstock and new ethane <b>steam</b> <b>crackers</b> are being built. Using ethane as a feedstock produces more ethene and less co-products such as propene, aromatics and C 4 alkenes. Thus, {{the shift in}} feedstock will reduce the availability of these co-products. Developing methods for the interconversion of alkenes, and specifically using ethene as a reactant, can solve this problem. This project focuses on synthesis and characterization of zeolites with the BEA framework topology, and their nickel exchanged versions as potential ethene dimerization catalysts. In future work, these materials {{will be used to}} carry out catalytic studies for ethene dimerization. Nickel exchanges were carried out using nickel nitrate Ni(NO 3) 2 solution on commercial aluminosilicate samples from Clariant (HCZB- 25 Si/Al= 12. 5) and Zeolyst (CBV Si/Al= 12. 5) and an in-house synthesized aluminosilicate (Si/Al= 13). Nickel exchange was determined to reach equilibrium by 16 hours at 75 oC. Nickel exchanges were performed at this equilibration time with varying nickel nitrate molarities (0. 005 - 0. 1 M), but keeping all other factors constant (temperature at 75 oC, stirring at 300 R.

40|$|International @ ECI 2 D+NTT:LMA:LBU:JMIInternational audienceIn the future, {{a strong}} {{increase}} in the demand for propylene is expected because of the growing markets for polypropylene and propylene oxide. In the other hand next generation of <b>steam</b> <b>crackers</b> will use shale gas ethane as raw material and less by-products {{will be available for}} propylene production. There is thus a need to develop bio-propylene. The later could be produce by dehydration of 1 or 2 -propanol but contrarily to ethanol and 1 -butanol, there are not large-scale industrial processes to produce them. One way to overcome this problem would be to produce propylene by metathesis from ethylene and 2 -butene. The process would be economically attractive if 2 -butene is produced by dehydration of 1 -butanol, which is the isomer predominantly formed by fermentation and the number of reaction steps minimized. This can be done by running the dehydration of ethanol and 1 -butanol in one step without water pre-separation. In this study, we report on the catalytic properties of rare earth phosphates tested for the dehydration of alcohols mixtures. The study of the catalytic properties of these solids has been extended to ABE (acetone-butanol-ethanol) mixtures produced by bacterial fermentation. Nd, Gd and Sm phosphates with Rhabdophane structure have been prepared by co-precipitation [1]. The acid-base properties of the catalysts have been studied by NH 3 - and CO 2 -TPD and Lutidine adsorption followed by IRTF to correlate these properties to the catalytic properties [2]. The phosphates have been tested in the dehydration of ethanol and 1 -butanol mixtures (Fig. 1). Activity in dehydration of ethanol was in the order: Gd>Sm>Nd but inverse for activity in 1 -butanol and 2 -butene selectivity. The results were from acid-base properties. Gd is more active for ethanol dehydration because it has more strong Br?nsted acid sites compared to Sm and Nd. But Sm and Nd have more weak and moderate acids sites, which make them more active to dehydrate 1 -butanol and more selective to 2 -butene. In any case, only 1 -butene is formed besides 2 -butene when 1 -butanol is dehydrated. Since ethanol dehydration takes preferentially place on stronger acid sites, there is little competition between the reactions and total conversion of the 2 alcohols is observed. The catalysts were also shown to be very efficient to dehydrate ABE mixture (acetone, butanol, ethanol in 3 - 6 - 1 ratio). The conclusion of the work is that rare earth phosphates can dehydrate selectively alcohol mixtures or ABE mixtures produced by industrial fermentation processes. The catalysts are very selective for all alcohols in the same time and stable with time on stream. 1 -butanol is preferentially dehydrated to 2 -butene, which can be fruitfully used to transform ethanol 1 -butanol mixtures and subsequently performed metathesis reaction to produce propene. Industrially they open the way to build a large-scale process to produce propene from alcohols minimizing purification/separation steps energetically costly...|$|R

40|$|The {{interest}} {{in the production of}} 1, 3 -butadiene these days is increasing in both academic and industrial research. Researchers are looking for alternative on-purpose production routes to replace the current 1, 3 -butadiene supply as byproduct in the naphtha <b>steam</b> <b>crackers,</b> for ethylene production, to disconnect the supply and price from the ethylene demand. Different routes are available for such on-purpose production of 1, 3 ‑butadiene, like the dehydrogenation of butane and butenes, the dehydration of butanediols and the conversion of ethanol to 1, 3 -butadiene. The current PhD research focusses on the chemo catalytic conversion of ethanol into 1, 3 -butadiene. This process has been operated on an industrial scale long time ago. Despite the former success, improvements, likely {{at the level of the}} catalyst properties, are necessary for this process to become competitive in the present-day industry. In this PhD research, an extensive catalyst research was therefore conducted with the aim to increase the catalytic activity and butadiene selectivity, and to understand the complex catalytic systems. Such a catalyst research will play an important role in the improvements necessary for this process and aid the eventual assessment of the economic viability of this ethanol-based production method. Our thermodynamic calculations proved that the conversion of ethanol into 1, 3 -butadiene become favorable above 150 °C and the preferred reaction temperature is between 325 and 430 °C. The calculations also illustrated that 1, 3 -butadiene is thermodynamically not the most favorable reaction product; ethylene and all isomers of butene are more favorable products. Therefore, a multifunctional catalyst for the 1, 3 -butadiene formation process should be capable of catalyzing selectively the different reactions, but avoiding the formation of the thermodynamically more stable side-products. Inspired by old literature, an extensive catalytic research was conducted focusing on magnesia-silica type materials for the 1, 3 -butadiene formation from ethanol. The influences of the synthesis procedure, the Mg/Si ratio and the nature of different dopants on the catalytic activity were studied. The binary magnesia-silica catalysts didn’t prove to be very active in the 1, 3 -butadiene formation reaction. The modification of the magnesia-silica support with transition metal(oxide) s by means of a consecutive impregnation step significantly increased the ethanol conversion and 1, 3 -butadiene yield. Catalysts containing CuO, ZnO and Ag dopants obtained 1, 3 -butadiene yields higher than 50 % at full ethanol conversion. In the next part of this work, a thorough investigation was conducted on the silver doped magnesia-silica catalysts. The influences of the silver content and the type of silica material on the catalytic performance were studied in depth. The prepared catalysts were characterized by different techniques such as 29 Si NMR, N 2 sorption, SAXS, XRD, ESEM/EDX, IR spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine and CO 2, CO 2 ‑TPD and UV-vis DRS. It was shown that the contact with water during the impregnation of silver resulted in changes of the pore structure and in the formation of an amorphous magnesium silicate phase on the final catalyst. These changes also resulted in an increase of the Lewis acidity and basicity of the final catalyst. The catalytic results were combined with the characterization results to explain the catalytic activity of the silver doped magnesia-silica catalysts. The addition of silver increases the dehydrogenation activity of the magnesia-silica catalysts. The rate-determining step in the 1, 3 -butadiene formation therefore shifts from the dehydrogenation on silver-free catalysts to the aldol condensation on silver doped catalysts. These rate-determining reactions are catalyzed by, respectively, the silver species and the basic sites (MgO-pairs and basic OH groups) present on the surface of the active catalysts. The following steps in the reaction sequence, MPV reduction of crotonaldehyde and dehydration of crotyl alcohol, are catalyzed by, respectively, Lewis acidic Mg(II) atoms and mildly acidic silanol groups. The optimal silver loading is 1 ‑ 2 wt% silver for a magnesia-silica catalyst with a molar Mg/Si ratio of 2. The highest 1, 3 -butadiene productivity was reached at higher reaction temperatures, with a record productivity of almost 0. 3 gram butadiene per gram catalyst per hour at 480 °C and a WHSV of 1. 2 per hour. In the final part, the obtained information about the silver doped magnesia-silica catalysts is used to make alterations in the preparation method to gain further insights and improvements in this complex catalytic system and increase their catalytic activity. First, the sequence of the preparation method was altered. For these types of catalysts, silver was loaded on the silica source before mixing with the Mg source. Secondly, different solvents are introduced in the preparation method, both during the mixing of the Mg and Si sources and during the impregnation of silver, to control the contact between the MgO and SiO 2 phases and to control the formation of the magnesium silicate phase. Both alternative procedures are able to create active and selective catalysts for the conversion of ethanol into 1, 3 -butadiene, only when the magnesia and silica phase were simultaneously contacted with water. Both methods demonstrate the importance of the simultaneous contact with water, resulting in the formation of a magnesium silicate phase. The magnesium silicate phase is a vital part of the final active catalyst. The dehydrogenation and aldol condensation activity are significantly higher in the presence of the magnesium silicate phase, resulting in significantly higher 1, 3 -butadiene yields and productivities compared to catalysts without a magnesium silicate phase. The combination of catalytic experiments with thorough physicochemical characterizations was the foundations for the interpretation of the catalytic activity of the magnesia-silica materials. The novel insights, gained during this PhD research, also led to the construction of a tentative reaction pathway model explaining the role of the different active sites on the multifunctional catalyst in the conversion of ethanol into 1, 3 ‑butadiene. nrpages: 175 status: publishe...|$|R
