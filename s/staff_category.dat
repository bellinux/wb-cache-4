However, very few studies had addressed the theoretical and methodological aspects of health related absenteeism among University workers. A retrospective study of sickness records of 4447 employees of University of Ibadan made {{available at the}} University Staff Clinic (Jaja). The health records of each staff for the whole 12 months in 2007 were reviewed.

40|$|Academic {{libraries}} are {{a powerful}} tool for education and research. The library's significance in the university has been underlined by all studies because it takes part directly and effectively in institution's life. The historical, cultural and educational environment affects library development in general and university libraries in particular. The history of the Greek academic libraries starts since 1837 with the establishment of the first university in Greece. The new university was located in a small building in Athens. A room of this building was devoted to the library. For decades the university educational system in Greece was negative in attempts at developing central university libraries. Today in Greece there are 18 Universities and 14 Technical Educational Institutes. Both types of educational establishments compose the higher education in Greece. At these institutions there are in total 226 libraries. The educational system of Greece is divided into three levels: a. Primary education b. Secondary education c. Higher education which includes as it has mentioned the Higher Education Institutes(AEI) and the Technical Educational Institutes(TEI). For candidates who want to take a place in one of the higher education institutions there is a national competition every year. The studies are free of charge for all educational levels. Central and Departmental libraries are the schemes which serve the academic community. So far, there is no legislation, which will respond to the general operation issues of the academic libraries in Greece. Ad hoc organizational issues are solved within the university context. This might be one of the major issues in discussion about TQM in libraries in Greece. There are two categories of staff in libraries. The first has permanent contract with the university. This <b>staff</b> <b>category</b> supports all administration posts. The second one has a temporary contract, which means that they cannot officially take any administration post. In NTUA, there are 5 persons who have permanent contract and 20 persons with temporary contract. Recently in Greece the second <b>staff</b> <b>category</b> is the largest group of employees in the academic Libraries. This situation affects seriously the work effectiveness since decision-­making is a matter {{of a small group of}} employees within the same library...|$|E

Our study describes and explores staff interactions in a long-term care facility, which may facilitate or impede healthy transition processes for older residents in transition. Methods An ethnographic study based on fieldwork following ten older residents admission day and their initial week in the long-term care facility, seventeen individual semi-structured interviews with different nursing <b>staff</b> <b>categories</b> and the leader of the institution, and reading of relevant documents.

40|$|Scrutiny {{of staff}} {{turnover}} in Higher Education is traditionally reactive and involves benchmarking against peers at institution level. A university {{which is not}} an outlier will be tempted to infer that turnover is “satisfactory”. However, there may be varied and counterbalancing turnover patterns within individual departments which are not apparent from the institution-wide figure. Therefore situations that present challenges and require action could be missed. This research was instigated to investigate {{the degree to which}} headline staff turnover can mask internal variations, and sets out lessons for staff management. It involved a large post- 1992 English university with data covering a full academic year. The methods scrutinised related mainstream benchmarking sources, and analysed turnover for both staff that had left and new recruits, as well as net turnover. The inverted Nomogramma di Gandy helped highlight overall patterns and identify outliers. A wide range of <b>staff</b> <b>categories</b> and characteristics were examined, including age, gender, diversity, staff type and contractual status. It was concluded that headline staff turnover can mask (wide) internal variations between university departments and between different gender and age groups. Localised high turnover rates were found, with particular issues involving research staff. A proactive approach is essential, analysing local data to reflect internal structures, and <b>staff</b> <b>categories</b> and characteristics. Understanding internal and external staff dynamics supports organisations to meet strategic aims and objectives, and pinpoint where local action is necessary. The approach and findings are relevant to all universities in the UK and internationally in these times of uncertainty...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} the dimensions of affirmative action (AA) fairness in order to develop a valid and reliable questionnaire to assess employees' perceptions of the fairness of AA decisions and practices, and to explore the relationship between employees' biographical characteristics and their perceptions of the dimensions of AA fairness. The research sample consisted of 349 participants connected to a large financial institution in South Africa. Principal axis factor analysis with a varimax rotation was performed on the data in order to uncover the different factors that employees perceived to be important for the fair and just management of affirmative action practices.

40|$|The aim of {{the current}} study is to examine the health status and the Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) of {{hospital}} personnel in Greece, which is an important component of health, as defined by the World Health Organisation (WHO). It is the first large scale study focusing on health status and HRQoL not only of healthcare workers but of workforce in Greece in general. In addition, the present study attempts to investigate into the factors that influence the health status and HRQoL of the employees, work-related parameters and factors that influence disease prevention behaviour, in order to pinpoint needs for health promotion interventions for the employees. Material and Method: A stratified random sample of 719 personnel of 13 Health Promotion Hospitals (HNHPH) was selected, including 10 % of employees of all staff categories (administrative, medical, nursing, technical and auxiliary staff). In order to assess HRQoL, the Greek version of SF- 36 was administered. A purpose made questionnaire concerning self reported chronic morbidity, work accidents, risk factors (smoking, diet, obesity, alcohol consumption, physical activity), work related factors (stress at work, workplace problems, job satisfaction) and disease prevention behaviour was administered as well. Statistical analysis included linear regression analysis and logistic regression analysis to specify the independent predictive factors of HRQoL and preventive behaviour, respectively. Results: As far HRQoL is concerned, the mean scores of the 8 dimensions of SF- 36 of hospital staff were lower than those measured in previous studies of the general population in Greece. Linear regression analysis revealed tht sex, self reported chronic morbidity and job satisfaction are important independent predictive factors of all the dimensions of HRQoL, whereas age, <b>staff</b> <b>category,</b> physical exercise and diet can be considered as independent predictive factors of some of the scales of SF- 36. 38, 7 % of the employees reported chronic morbidity and 12, 6 % had an workplace accident during the previous year. 46, 7 % of the sample are current smokers, 58, 3 % follow a balanced diet according to the standards of the Mediterranean diet, 13, 9 % of the sample are obese, 70, 7 % consumes at least one drink daily and 24, 7 % are physically inactive. As far as workrelated factors are concerned, 78, 8 % reported stress at work, and 40, 8 % reported high levels of job satisfaction. As for preventive 300 behaviour, 90, 1 % replied that they have ever measured their blood pressure, 83, 2 % reported that they have ever measured thei blood cholesterol, and 63, 1 % reported a dental visit during the previous year. Self reported chronic morbidity was found to be the only independent predictive factor for blood pressure measurement. Daily alcohol consumption, diet and chronic morbidity can be considered as independent predictive factors for blood cholesterol measurement, whereas sex was found to be the only independent predictive factor for dental visits. As far as preventive tests for gynaecological cancers are concerned, only 15, 6 % of the women employees do self breast examination on a monthly basis and no indepent predictive factor was found for this test. 60, 8 % of the female of the sample have undergone breast clinical examination and <b>staff</b> <b>category,</b> job satisfaction and chronic morbidity were found to predict breast clinical examination independently. 77 % of women of the sample over the age of 50 have undergone mammography and <b>staff</b> <b>category,</b> job satisfaction and chronic morbidity can be considered as indendent predictive factors for this test. 90, 3 % of the female sample has ever done a Pap test and balanced diet and chronic morbidity were found to be independent predictive tests for this test. Conclusions: HRQoL of hospital staff was found to be lower than that of the general population in Greece and inequalities in HRQoL were revealed among the hospital employees. Self reported chronic morbidity of the sample is comparable to those of the Greek general population and the incidence of severe work accidents is one third of that measured in the general workforce in Greece according to Eurostat. Smoking prevalence is similar to that measured in studies of greek employees and diet is far from the recommendations for the weekly consumption of fish, eggs, dairy products, fruit and vegetables. The prevalence of obesity and alcohol consumption {{is similar to that of}} the general population in Greece, whereas the levels of physical activity are higher than those of the general population. Important inequalities were discovered in all the above mentioned risk factors according to sex, age and <b>staff</b> <b>category.</b> The observed levels of work stress in the sample were higher than those of the general workforce in Greece as well as the percentage of employees that report high levels of job satisfaction. As far as preventive behaviour is concerned, the percentage of those in the sample who have ever measured their blood pressure is higher than that of the general population, while the percentage of those who have jhad their blood cholesterol checked is similar to that of the Greek general population. As for womens‘ preventive tests, the percentage of women who perform monthly selfbreast 301 examination observed is lower than those observed ina study of healthcare workers in Greece. The compliance to clinical brest examination and mammography is similar to that of the Greek general population whereas the compliance to Pap smear test is higher than the general population...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} the major components of affirmative action (AA) fairness and to develop a valid and reliable measuring instrument, which could be used to measure the perceptions of employees on AA fairness. A literature study and an empirical study were conducted. The literature study focused on fairness principles, outlined AA practices and identified work behaviours related to commitment. On completion of the literature study, a questionnaire was developed to collect information on respondents’ biographical details and their perceptions of the fairness of AA, the treatment of AA employees and employees’ commitment. Using SPSS, principal axis factor analysis was performed on the data, with a Varimax rotation, in order to uncover the different factors related to the three behavioural domains. Four factors for each of the behavioural domains with latent roots greater than unity (Kaiser’s criteria) were extracted from the factor matrix of each domain. The factors postulating the different behavioural domains are as follows: AA fairness: interactional justice, procedural justice (input), procedural justice (criteria) and distributive Justice Treatment of AA employees: task autonomy, respect, responsibility and realistic expectations on the part of supervisors Employees’ commitment: obedience, participation, satisfaction and loyalty The influence and effect of the biographical variables on fairness perceptions were determined by xiv comparing the responses of various employee subsets with one another by means of univariate and multivariate analysis of variance. The results of the t-tests revealed that <b>staff</b> <b>category,</b> marital status and ethnicity have a statistically significant effect on employees’ perceptions of the distributive justice of AA. Decisions such as granting AA employees token positions, paying unrealistically high salaries to AA managers and appointing less-qualified employees, play a key role when managers, married employees and whites form perceptions of the fairness of AA. Women consider procedural fairness, adhering to rules and regulations and loyalty to be of paramount importance. The MANOVAs and associated ANOVAs indicated that ethnicity, <b>staff</b> <b>category</b> and age must be considered for their significant effect on perceptions of distributive justice, autonomy, respect and loyalty. Blacks, contrary to whites, believe that AA employees are not treated with respect and are not accorded autonomy. Older employees and clerical staff tend to be more loyal than their counterparts. Multiple regression statistics were used to predict how the treatment of AA employees relates to perceptions of the fairness of AA. The results indicated that the more task autonomy and respect accorded to employees, the more likely they will perceive decisions about AA to be fair. This study represents a vital step towards a better understanding of the dimensionality of AA fairness and should ultimately contribute to more effective management of AA in the workplace.

The study specifically examined the determinants of work-family balance experience among women in the banking sector. A review of literature was carried out while the study was anchored on two theoretical platforms: Role Theory and Social Exchange Theory. The research employed both qualitative and quantitative research techniques. Three hypotheses were formulated and tested for the study. The first hypothesis revealed that age of the respondents, children ever born (parity), marital status, <b>staff</b> <b>category</b> and religion are significant determinants of work-family balance. Women with children in parity ratio of 1 - 2, 3 - 4 and 5 and above are 1. 654, 1. 455 and 1. 235 {{times more likely to}} be unable to balance work-family roles compared to those with zero parity (i. e. the reference category). The third hypothesis estimated significant influence of work status on the work-family balance; this is statistically significant at p-values of 0. 005, 0. 003, and 0. 01 for senior staff, supervisors and junior staff respectively. The study concludes that if work demands become heavy, marital roles cannot be shelved or neglected and tension between the two boundaries will require a compromise.

The objective {{of the study was}} to identify the components of workplace treatment that indicate the perceived treatment of employees from designated groups. The study further investigated the influence of demographic factors on these perceptions. A quantitative approach was followed, and a questionnaire was developed to collect data pertaining to employees ’ biographical details and their perceptions of the treatment of employees from designated groups in the workplace. The population consisted of 29 688 employees at a leading South African bank and a sample of 1720 was used. A disproportionate, stratified sampling method was adopted and a sample of 349 employees participated. Factor analysis, correlations, T-tests and analysis of variance statistics were computed to achieve the objectives. The factor analysis identified four factors relating to the treatment of employees from designated groups: task autonomy, respect, responsibility and realistic expectations. The results of the T-tests revealed that race, years of service and <b>staff</b> <b>category</b> do influence employees ’ perceptions of the treatment of workers from designated groups in terms of task autonomy and respect. Black respondents, unlike white respondents, believe that employees from designated groups are not treated with respect, nor are they accorded task autonomy.

The {{objectives of the}} study were to investigate: 1) the extent to which workers in library and information services in KwaZulu-Natal are members of LIASA; and 2) the reasons for non-membership, if there are substantial numbers of LIS workers who are not members. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to report on the main findings of this study. The study surveyed three types of library services in KwaZulu-Natal, namely, academic, public and special libraries with 330 LIS workers participating in the study. A census was done of LIS workers in special libraries and in academic libraries of public higher education institutions in KZN. Simple random sampling was used to select public libraries in KZN for participation in the study. All staff in the selected sample of public libraries were surveyed. A self-administered questionnaire was used to gather the required data from the target population. It was established that a significant number of LIS workers in all three types of libraries surveyed in KZN are not members of LIASA for various reasons. LIASA has been unable to draw significant membership from the support <b>staff</b> <b>category</b> in LIS services despite its constitution claiming to embrace all LIS workers.

The study included an organizational stress screening survey instrument to survey the population (N = 1, 420) of academic, research, and support staff. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to evaluate the relationships between the independent variables (social support, workâ??life conflict, job performance), the covariates (<b>staff</b> <b>category,</b> direct reports, age, gender), and the dependent variable (workplace stress). The results showed a negative correlation between social support and workplace stress, a positive correlation between workâ??life conflict and workplace stress, and a negative correlation between job performance and workplace stress (p 3 ̆c. 05).

This approach will be possible through experimentation of a personalized care model. To analyze job satisfaction of health care professionals operating within the Spinal Cord Unit, preliminary to organizational change. Data collection was carried out by using questionnaires, interviews, shadowing. Results from quantitative analysis on the self-filled questionnaires were integrated with results from qualitative analysis. All the health care professionals operating in the field were involved. Positive aspects were the perception of carrying out a useful job, the feeling of personal fulfilment and the wish to engage new energies and resources.

The descentralization of the budget institutions makes the obtaining of some principles of the human resources management to be essential so that they create the conditions of involving and participating in the institution activity, as we wish to live in a society where the fundamental values are creativity, liberty, pluralism and tolerance. The pre-university education institution(kindergartens, schools and high schools) are not provided with a human resources manager. The descentralized management of the human resources level of the School County Inspectorate, the lack of a clear policy in the domain of the human resources (at the level of the School County Inspectorate even if there is a management department of the human resources, those who work in this department do not have the necessary qualification, being selected teaching staff on certain criteria, and the unprofessional involvement of the local authorities, these being disruptive factors of the training-educational process. ...|$|R
40|$|As part of {{a series}} of case studies (including Burkina Faso, Kenya, Senegal, South Africa, and Zambia) that {{assessed}} the status of and trends in human resource capacity, this study focused on staffing at the South African Agricultural Research Council (ARC) and the Faculty of Natural and Agricultural Sciences (FNAS&FVS) and Faculty of Veterinary Sciences (FVS) of the University of Pretoria (UP) during 2001 – 10. The specific characteristics studies were (1) the capacity of both research and support staff by gender, qualification level, and discipline; (2) the age profile of scientists; and (3) trends in staff recruitment and staff turnover. The results show that both the ARC and FNAS&FVS&FVS experienced an increase in the age of staff, although much more so at ARC than at FNAS&FVS. Unlike ARC, where research staff numbers have declined significantly over the past decade, FNAS&FVS recorded growth in researcher/lecturer capacity, although there has been a growing reliance on part-time appointments. Female participation in research has grown significantly at both the ARC and FNAS&FVS, albeit it in the junior (BSc-qualified) <b>staff</b> <b>category</b> at FNAS&FVS. In both cases it appears that the ability to compete with the private sector—and even the public sector in terms remuneration levels and the ability to attract and retain young researchers—is thus a constraint. Given the greater flexibility at universities in allowing staff to augment their income through consultancies, universities seems to be gaining ground over ARC, but this may not be sustainable in the long run.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{prospective}} {{study was to explore}} predictors of objective career success among Swedish women and men, focussing on gender differences. Data were drawn from the 2008 and 2010 waves of the Swedish Longitudinal Occupational Survey of Health (SLOSH) with a total of 3670 female and 2773 male participants. Odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals for job promotion and an above-average salary increase between 2008 and 2010 were obtained through binary logistic regression analyses. Individual and organisational factors measured in 2008 were used as predictors in analyses stratified by sex. Mutual adjustment was performed for these variables, as well as for labour market sector and <b>staff</b> <b>category</b> at baseline. In both sexes, younger age predicted both job promotion and an above-average salary increase. Job promotion was also in both sexes predicted by being part of decision-making processes, having conflicts with superiors, and being eager to advance. Furthermore, promotion was predicted by, among men, being educated to post-graduate level and having an open coping strategy and, among women, working > 60 hours/week. An above-average salary increase was predicted in both sexes by having a university education. Postgraduate education, having children living at home, and being very motivated to advance predicted an above-average salary increase among women, as did working 51 - 60 hours/week and being part of decision-making processes in men. Gender differences were seen in several predictors. In conclusion, the results support previous findings of gender differences in predictors of career success. A high level of education, motivation to advance, and procedural justice appear to be more important predictors of career success among women, while open coping was a more important predictor among men...|$|E
40|$|Summary: This report {{presents}} {{findings that}} were {{obtained in the}} PROFIO study on recruitment strategies and qualification requirements at the World Bank. As our method of analysis, we conduct and assess qualitative interviews with World Bank employees, primarily of the higher level <b>staff</b> <b>category.</b> We find that job preparedness derives {{from a combination of}} the educational background, professional work experience, and behavioral skills. With respect to the educational background, we find that the most frequent fields of study among our interviewees are Economics and development-related fields. Hence, we conclude that the study of such fields, and the integration of multi-disciplinary elements serve as a good educational preparation for a career at the World Bank. In addition, this study unveils differences among respondents when asked to evaluate their university education. We find that the Anglo-Saxon education tradition trumps other education systems in terms of usefulness; especially when compared to the German system of higher education. Through a sub-sample analysis of German respondents only, we are able to extrapolate specific weaknesses that render German higher education ill-suited to prepare its students for a career with the World Bank. Furthermore, this study offers specific recommendations with respect to curriculum design. To ensure students’ preparedness for employment with the World Bank, the interviewees advocated an international outlook of the educational institution as an essential prerequisite for students’ ability to perform in international settings – an international student body and English as the main language of instruction were frequently said to serve as means to acquire an international outlook early. Furthermore, respondents stressed the importance of knowledge application during one’s education. Hence, curricula should include problemsolving exercises and integrate internship opportunitie...|$|E
40|$|Relatively few {{articles}} {{have focused on}} exploring factors influencing soldiers' overall satisfaction and differences between inpatients' and outpatients' satisfaction, particularly in the Chinese army. Elucidating factors influencing military inpatient and outpatient care separately and analyzing their differences may provide more information for the health system. The Revised China National Health Service Survey questionnaire {{was used in the}} survey. The questionnaire included 5 sections and 32 items concerning demographic, inpatient, and outpatient characteristics and perception variables for both inpatients and outpatients. Bivariate and multivariate techniques were used to reveal relationships between satisfaction and the variables assessed. Outpatients' and inpatients' overall satisfaction rates were 19. 0 % and 18. 5 %, respectively. The strongest determinant of outpatients' satisfaction was satisfaction with doctor's communication regarding therapeutic regimen followed by length of military service, level of trust in medical staff, and disease severity. Determinants of inpatients' satisfaction included <b>staff</b> <b>categories,</b> satisfaction with environment, and satisfaction with medical quality. The factors influencing military outpatients' satisfaction differed from those of inpatients. Exploring the causes of satisfaction and dissatisfaction with military health institutions is important in their fulfillment of their responsibility to maintain soldiers' health...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background During the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak, high {{compliance}} {{in healthcare}} workers to hand hygiene was primarily driven by fear. However, the post-SARS period confirmed that this practice was not sustainable. At the Singapore General Hospital, a 1, 600 -bedded acute tertiary care hospital, the hand hygiene program was revised in early 2007 following Singapore's {{signing of the}} pledge to the World Health Organization (WHO) "Clean Care is Safer Care" program. Findings A multi-prong approach was used in designing the hand hygiene program. This included system change; training and education; evaluation and feedback; reminders in the workplace; and institutional safety climate. Hand hygiene compliance rate improved from 20 % (in January 2007) to 61 % (2010). Improvement was also seen annually in the compliance {{to each of the}} 5 moments as well as in all <b>staff</b> <b>categories.</b> Healthcare-associated MRSA infections were reduced from 0. 6 (2007) to 0. 3 (2010) per 1000 patient-days. Conclusions Leadership's support of the program evidenced through visible leadership presence, messaging and release of resources is the key factor in helping to make the program a true success. The hospital was recognised as a Global Hand Hygiene Expert Centre in January 2011. The WHO multi-prong interventions work in improving compliance and reducing healthcare associated infections. </p...|$|R
