5|$|Montejo was {{appointed}} alcalde mayor (a local colonial governor) of Tabasco in 1529, and pacified that province {{with the aid}} of his son, also named Francisco de Montejo. D'Avila was sent from eastern Yucatán to conquer Acalan, which extended southeast of the Laguna de Terminos. Montejo the Younger founded <b>Salamanca</b> de Xicalango as a base of operations. In 1530 D'Avila established <b>Salamanca</b> de Acalán as a base from which to launch new attempts to conquer Yucatán. <b>Salamanca</b> de Acalán proved a disappointment, with no gold for the taking and with lower levels of population than had been hoped. D'Avila soon abandoned the new settlement and set off across the lands of the Kejache to Champotón, arriving there towards the end of 1530. During a colonial power struggle in Tabasco, the elder Montejo was imprisoned for a time. Upon his release, he met up with his son in Xicalango, Tabasco, and they then both rejoined d'Avila at Champotón.|$|E

5|$|In Spain, Las Casas started {{securing}} {{official support}} for the Guatemalan mission, and {{he managed to get}} a royal decree forbidding secular intrusion into the Verapaces for the following five years. He also informed the Theologians of <b>Salamanca,</b> led by Francisco de Vitoria, of the mass baptism practiced by the Franciscans, resulting in a dictum condemning the practice as sacrilegious.|$|E
5|$|Wellington's army {{consisted}} of four combat arms: Infantry, cavalry and artillery. Engineers {{also played a}} valuable role in the Peninsula, such as {{the building of the}} Lines of Torres Vedras– a defensive line of forts built to protect Lisbon– and making preparations for any sieges throughout the war. Wellington's main combat arm was his well-trained infantry. He never had more than 2,000 cavalry before 1812 and his cannons, although highly competent, were inferior to French guns in both number and quality. It was with this force that Wellington aimed to defend Portugal until he took to an offensive strategy in 1812, beating the French at the <b>Salamanca.</b> He advanced on to Madrid, arriving on 12 August 1812– Joseph Bonaparte had abandoned the capital after the defeat at <b>Salamanca.</b>|$|E
5|$|NY18 was {{assigned}} in 1924 and originally {{extended from the}} Pennsylvania state line near <b>Salamanca</b> to downtown Buffalo via Dayton and Hamburg. It was extended northeast to Rochester via Niagara Falls {{as part of the}} 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York and east to NY250 in the town of Webster by the following year. NY18 was truncated on its west end to the town of Lewiston in the early 1960s and on its east end to Rochester in the early 1970s.|$|E
5|$|The Condor Legion {{also took}} part in the Battle of Brunete. The Legion was sent from the north to {{reinforce}} the broken line. There were repeated raids on Spanish Republican Army armoured vehicles and later defensive positions by both bombers and fighters based at <b>Salamanca.</b> Spanish Republican Air Force aircraft were ineffective, despite Nationalist fears, compared with German aircraft. The Legion lost eight aircraft, but claimed 18 victories. German tactics were also improved with the experience of Brunete, particularly the en masse use of tanks by the Nationalists.|$|E
5|$|The Condor Legion, upon establishment, {{consisted}} of the Kampfgruppe 88, with three squadrons of Ju 52 bombers and the Jagdgruppe 88 with three squadrons of Heinkel He 51 fighters, the reconnaissance Aufklärungsgruppe 88 (supplemented by the Aufklärungsgruppe See 88), an anti-aircraft group, the Flakbteilung 88, and a signals group, the Nachrichtenabteilung 88. Overall command was given to Hugo Sperrle, with Alexander Holle as chief of staff. Scheele was transferred to become a military attaché in <b>Salamanca.</b> Two armoured units {{under the command of}} Wilhelm Ritter von Thoma, with 106 Panzer Is, were also operational.|$|E

5|$|Writings {{about the}} theory of how to play chess {{began to appear in}} the 15thcentury. The Repetición de Amores y Arte de Ajedrez (Repetition of Love and the Art of Playing Chess) by Spanish churchman Luis Ramirez de Lucena was {{published}} in <b>Salamanca</b> in 1497. Lucena and later masters like Portuguese Pedro Damiano, Italians Giovanni Leonardo Di Bona, Giulio Cesare Polerio and Gioachino Greco, and Spanish bishop Ruy López de Segura developed elements of openings and started to analyze simple endgames.|$|E
5|$|As {{a part of}} Las Casas's defense by offense, he had {{to argue}} against Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda. Sepúlveda was a doctor of {{theology}} and law who, in his book Democrates Alter, sive de justis causis apud Indos (Another Democrates /or A New Democrates, or on the Just Causes of War against the Indians) had argued that some native peoples were incapable of ruling themselves and should be pacified forcefully. The book was deemed unsound for publication by the theologians of <b>Salamanca</b> and Alcalá for containing unsound doctrine, but the pro-encomendero faction seized on Sepúlveda as their intellectual champion.|$|E
5|$|Badajoz {{is home to}} the Universidad de Extremadura (UNEX) Badajoz campus, {{situated}} {{on the west side of}} the river. The university was founded on 4 November 1968, when the Faculty of Badajoz belonging to the University of Seville was established. Today, the University of Extremadura has branches in Badajoz, Cáceres, Mérida, and Plasencia. In 1971 the Council of Ministers approved the establishment of the College of Arts of Cáceres under the University of <b>Salamanca.</b> Secondary schools such as the Normal Schools of Education of Cáceres and Badajoz were integrated into the University in 1972 following the General Law of Education decree of 1970. The Intermediate Technical School of Agricultural Engineering of Badajoz was founded in Badajoz 1968, renamed the College of Agricultural Engineering in 1972.|$|E
5|$|In October 1960, {{ground was}} broken on the Kinzua Dam, which would dam the Allegheny River downriver from NY280 {{at a point}} east of Warren, Pennsylvania. The {{structure}} was completed on December13, 1965, leading {{to the creation of}} the Allegheny Reservoir. Much of NY280 was inundated by the new reservoir, as were Cold Spring, Quaker Bridge, and a significant portion of Pennsylvania Route346 (PA346) that ran along the river in Warren County. As a result, new alignments were built for both NY280 and PA346 along the eastern edge of the new reservoir. Construction of NY280's new alignment began in 1965 and was completed by 1968. NY280 now began at the realigned PA346 at the state line and ended at exit18 of the Southern Tier Expressway, which was built between Steamburg and <b>Salamanca</b> during the mid-1960s.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, the Brunswick Oels Jägers gave a good {{account of}} {{themselves}} during the war. The regiment — really a single battalion—arrived in Portugal in early 1811. The Duke of Wellington distributed one company to the 4th Division and two companies to the 5th Division as skirmishers, while the remaining nine companies {{served in the}} newly formed 7th Division. The Oels remained in this organization {{until the end of}} the war in April 1814. During this period, the Oels served in most of the major battles including Fuentes de Onoro, <b>Salamanca,</b> Vitoria, the Pyrenees, Nivelle, the Nive, and Orthez.|$|E
5|$|Rejecting his mother's {{proposal}} of sending him {{to study in}} Spain at the University of <b>Salamanca</b> and Alcalá de Henares, alongside his cousin Manuel Belgrano, he enrolled in jurisprudence studies in the University of Chuquisaca, in the Upper Peru (modern Bolivia). There, he learned about the ongoing French Revolution, and the new ideas of the Age of Enlightenment. He also learned about the 1782 Rebellion of Túpac Amaru II and the oppression of the indigenous peoples, which influenced his actions in his future Upper Peru campaign. Before returning to Buenos Aires, he visited Potosí and witnessed the use of slave labor in the mines.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of NY18's routing {{south of the}} village of Lewiston was incorporated into the U.S. Highway System in the early 1930s after US62 and US219 were extended into New York and US104 was assigned. NY18 now began concurrent to US219 at the state line and overlapped the route northward {{to the city of}} <b>Salamanca.</b> US219 left NY18 here, and the latter continued independently to the town of Dayton, where it intersected US62. From there, US62 followed NY18 north to a junction with US104 (Main Street) in Niagara Falls. US62 ended here, and NY18 became concurrent to US104 upon turning onto Main Street. The overlap ended in the village of Lewiston, where US104 turned east to follow Ridge Road instead.|$|E
5|$|Bartolomé de las Casas {{was born}} in Seville in 1484, on 11 November. For centuries, Las Casas's birthdate was {{believed}} to be 1474; however, in the 1970s, scholars conducting archival work demonstrated this to be an error, after uncovering in the Archivo General de Indias records of a contemporary lawsuit that demonstrated he was born a decade later than had been supposed. Subsequent biographers and authors have generally accepted and reflected this revision. His father, Pedro de las Casas, a merchant, descended from one of the families that had migrated from France to found the town of Seville; his family also spelled the name Casaus. According to one biographer, his family were of converso heritage, although others refer to them as ancient Christians who migrated from France. Following the testimony of Las Casas's biographer Antonio de Remesal, tradition has it that Las Casas studied a licentiate at <b>Salamanca,</b> but this is never mentioned in Las Casas's own writings. As a young man, in 1507, he journeyed to Rome where he observed the Festival of Flutes.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{earning a}} poor {{reputation}} for his conduct, Costa attracted interest from <b>Salamanca,</b> Gimnàstic de Tarragona and Málaga after his loan at Celta; García Pitarch ruled out any approach from the latter, fearing how Costa would behave on the Costa del Sol. After attending Atlético's pre-season tour of Mexico, he signed on loan for Albacete, also of Segunda División, on 22 August 2008, signing a contract {{which would have}} a lower fee depending on how many games he played. He initially threatened to terminate his deal with the Castile-La Mancha team, {{on account of the}} quality of his teammates and the city's lack of a beach. Nine days after signing, he scored a late winner in a 2–1 victory over Sevilla's reserves at the Estadio Carlos Belmonte. The Queso Mecánico suffered with financial problems during Costa's loan, with him threatening to strike unless their non-playing staff were paid in full. He was dropped to the bench by manager Juan Ignacio Martínez for the home game against Real Sociedad on 13 December as punishment for an argument with goalkeeper Jonathan, but came on as a substitute to score another late winner.|$|E
5|$|Friedman {{was best}} known for {{reviving}} interest in the money supply as a determinant of the nominal value of output, that is, the quantity theory of money. Monetarism is the set of views associated with modern quantity theory. Its origins {{can be traced back}} to the 16th-century School of <b>Salamanca</b> or even further; however, Friedman's contribution is largely responsible for its modern popularization. He co-authored, with Anna Schwartz, A Monetary History of the United States, 1867–1960 (1963), which was an examination of the role of the money supply and economic activity in the U.S. history. A striking conclusion of their research regarded the way in which money supply fluctuations contribute to economic fluctuations. Several regression studies with David Meiselman during the 1960s suggested the primacy of the money supply over investment and government spending in determining consumption and output. These challenged a prevailing, but largely untested, view on their relative importance. Friedman's empirical research and some theory supported the conclusion that the short-run effect of a change of the money supply was primarily on output but that the longer-run effect was primarily on the price level.|$|E
5|$|Montejo garrisoned Xelha with 40 {{soldiers}} and posted 20 more at nearby Pole. Xelha was renamed <b>Salamanca</b> de Xelha {{and became the}} first Spanish settlement in the peninsula. The provisions were soon exhausted and additional food was requisitioned from the local Maya villagers; this too was soon consumed. Many local Maya fled into the forest and Spanish raiding parties scoured the surrounding area for food, finding little. With discontent growing among his men, Montejo took the drastic step of burning his ships; this strengthened the resolve of his troops, who gradually acclimatised to the harsh conditions of Yucatán. Montejo was able to get more food from the still-friendly Aj Nuam Pat of Cozumel. Montejo took 125 men and set out on an expedition to explore the north-eastern portion of the Yucatán peninsula. At Belma, Montejo gathered the leaders of the nearby Maya towns and instructed them to swear loyalty to the Spanish Crown. After this, Montejo led his men to Conil, a town in Ekab, where the Spanish party halted for two months.|$|E
5|$|Belgrano {{also studied}} living languages, {{political}} economy, and public rights. The authors that most influenced him were Pedro Rodríguez de Campomanes, Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos, Adam Smith, and François Quesnay. Belgrano translated Quesnay's book Maximes générales de gouvernement economique d'un royaume agricole (General Maxims of the Economical Government in an Agricultural Kingdom) to Spanish. His main {{interest in the}} works of such authors were ideas that referred to the public good and popular prosperity. Like many South American students, he became interested in physiocracy, which stated that new wealth came from nature, that agriculture was an economic activity that generated more income than one needed, and that the state should not interfere at all with it. By that time, South America had plenty of natural resources and a very strict state interventionism in the economy. Belgrano developed the idea that the principles of physiocracy and those stated by Adam Smith could be applied together in the viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. In the development of this approach he was influenced by Fernando Galliani, who promoted the study of particular cases over theoric generalisations, and Antonio Genovesi, who thought that the absolute freedom promoted by physiocrats should be tempered by a moderate intervention by the state, such as the provision of free education for some. During his time in Europe, Belgrano became president of an Academy within the University of <b>Salamanca</b> devoted to Roman legislation, forensic practice and political economy.|$|E
5|$|Montejo garrisoned Xelha with 40 {{soldiers}} {{under his}} second-in-command, Alonso d'Avila, and posted 20 more at nearby Pole.

Montejo was able to get more food from the still-friendly Aj Nuam Pat, when the latter made a visit to the mainland. Montejo took 125 men and set out on an expedition to explore the north-eastern portion of the Yucatán peninsula. His expedition passed through the towns of Xamanha, Mochis and Belma, none of which survives today. At Belma, Montejo gathered the leaders of the nearby Maya towns and ordered them to swear loyalty to the Spanish Crown. After this, Montejo led his men to Conil, a town in Ekab that was described as having 5,000 houses, where the Spanish party halted for two months.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} congress, tobacco workers {{initiated}} {{a series of}} strikes at three factories, one of which lasted {{through to the end}} of November. Later, in the summer of 1888, strikes by tobacco workers led to a lockout by factory owners in more than 100 factories. The Círculo de Trabajadores organized a collection drive to support the locked out workers, {{going so far as to}} send representatives to Key West, Florida to solicit donations from American tobacco workers. By October, the lockout was ended by factory owners agreeing to meet with workers in negotiations. The outcome of this situation was so favorable to the Alianza Obrera that the union saw its membership jump from 3,000 to 5,000 in the subsequent six months, making it the most powerful union in Cuba. The following year, Roig San Martín died at age 46, just days after his release from jail by the Spanish colonial government; his funeral was reportedly attended by 10,000 mourners. Just a few months later, in response to a lockout/strike in the tobacco industry, the colonial head Manuel <b>Salamanca</b> y Negrete closed the manufacturer's union, the Alianza Obrera and the Círculo de Trabajadores, although the four schools maintained by the Círculo were allowed to remain open, and the Círculo as a whole was allowed to reopen the following year by the new administration.|$|E
5|$|Tuau Lapua Lapua participated on Tuvalu's behalf in the men's featherweight (62 kilogram) weightlifting competition. He was {{the oldest}} person to {{represent}} Tuvalu at age 21 and had not participated in any previous Olympic Games. Lapua qualified for the games by earning a wildcard place based on his performance at the 2012 Oceania Weightlifting Championships in Apia, Samoa. Before his event {{he said that he}} was delighted to compete in the competition and wanted to make Tuvalu proud. His event took place in 31 July, and included 14 athletes in total. During the event's snatch phase, Lapua was given three attempts. He successfully attempted to lift over 90 kilograms of weight in his first two attempts, but did not achieve this objective on the third attempt. Lapua then attempted 130 kilograms during the clean and jerk phrase of the event, successfully lifting it in all three of his attempts. Overall, the combination of Lapua's highest scores in snatch (108) and clean and jerk (135) yielded a score of 243 points. He ranked 12th in the event, ahead of Charles Ssekyaaya of Uganda (235 points) and behind El Salvador's Julio <b>Salamanca</b> (260 points). Lapua was 84 points behind the gold medallist Kim Un-guk from North Korea.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} gain a better {{understanding}} of the intellectual influences to which John was exposed in his formative years (and so to isolate what shaped his unusual theology), many scholars have tried to reconstruct John's likely course of studies while he was at <b>Salamanca</b> between 1563 and 1567, living at the Carmelite College of San Andrès and studying at the University of <b>Salamanca.</b> It has been widely acknowledged in the 20th century to be most likely that John would have received teaching both from the College of San Andres and from <b>Salamanca</b> University.|$|E

25|$|However, {{the belief}} that John was taught at both the Carmelite College of San Andrès and at the University of <b>Salamanca</b> has been criticised. He argues, firstly, that {{it is unclear whether}} there were in fact lectures in arts and {{theology}} at the College of San Andrès before 1571, that a reconstruction of the typical timetable of teaching at the University of <b>Salamanca</b> shows that there would have been little time for extra teaching at the College of the San Andrès, and that what therefore happened at San Andrès (if indeed it happened at all) is therefore likely to have taken the form of rehearsals, preparation of classes, and not in an official form — making the idea that John received systematic exposure to Baconthorpe less likely. More controversially, Bezares calls into question whether John even studied theology at the University of <b>Salamanca.</b> The philosophy courses John probably took in logic, natural and moral philosophy, can be reconstructed, but Bezares argues that John in fact abandoned his studies at <b>Salamanca</b> in 1568 to join Teresa, rather than having graduated, meaning that he did not study theology in <b>Salamanca.</b>|$|E
