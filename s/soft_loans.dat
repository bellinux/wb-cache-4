In May 1999, as THSRC faced {{difficulties in}} raising capital, {{the government of}} Japan promised <b>soft</b> <b>loans</b> if THSRC switched to TSC. Although Eurotrain promised to match TSC's financial offerings, the Eschede train disaster in combination with TSC offered the newer 700 Series Shinkansen, convinced THSRC to reopen core system bid, and ultimately resulting in TSC selected as the preferred rolling-stock supplier in December 1999. Although Eurotrain eventually conceded in the bid, in February 2001 it filed for a US$800 million damage claim against THSRC at the Singapore International Arbitration Centre. After a lengthy arbitration process, the court ruled in March 2004 that THSRC should pay a compensation for the US$32.4 million Eurotrain spent on development and US$35.7 million for unjust enrichment. THSRC agreed to pay US$65 million (US$89 million with interest) to Eurotrain in November 2004.|$|E

The U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation has lent USD 250m to Diwaco to support U.S. foreign investment on the basis that General Electric partially owns GAMA Energy. The state-owned French bank PROPARCO, which is the part of the French Development Agency (AFD) that supports private sector development, and the European Investment Bank (EIB) each lent about USD 100m to Diwaco. The loan package has been put together by the Arab Banking Corporation. Much of the government grant supporting the project comes from sovereign <b>soft</b> <b>loans</b> that the government of Jordan has borrowed from the EIB and AFD and passes on as a grant to the project. AFD provided USD 50m for the state grant and USD 48m for the stand-by facility.|$|E

The present investigation is an attempt to evaluate the NHB <b>soft</b> <b>loan</b> schemes for the state of Maharashtra, specially with respect to the post-harvest infrastructure (PHI) facilities created and adequacy of incentives under the scheme. This study has made some interesting observations. The focus of this study is specifically on two grape growers’ societies. The study showed a positive impact of <b>soft</b> <b>loan</b> scheme towards development of PHI facilities in the area. However, in order to improve the efficiency of the <b>soft</b> <b>loan</b> schemes, the study also suggested various measures which mainly revolved around simplification of loan procedure adopted by the NHB, timely disbursement of the loan, financing of the entire comprehensive project rather than for certain specific components, subsidization of electricity tariffs for the processing units, subsidization of sea freight, provision of funds for setting up of Research and Development (R&D) unit for the marketing of produce, provision of foreign market intelligence for the exports of horticultural crops, etc. Participation of NCDC in working capital requirement of the grape growers’ societies is another suggestion of this study. ...|$|R

These loans were intended to redress the issue of landownership in Ireland arising from the wars of the 17th century.
