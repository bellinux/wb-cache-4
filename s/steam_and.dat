5|$|Geysers are {{temporary}} geological features. Geysers {{are generally}} associated with volcanic areas. As the water boils, the resulting pressure forces a superheated column of <b>steam</b> <b>and</b> {{water to the}} surface through the geyser's internal plumbing.

40|$|Objectives : The {{aim of this}} {{experiment}} is to provide an differentiation of ginseng, red ginseng, cultivated wild ginseng(CWG), and red wild ginseng(RWG) through component analysis using HPLC(High Performance Liquid Chromatography, hereafter HPLC). Methods : Comparative analyses of ginsenoside Rg 3, ginsenoside Rh 2, and ginsenosides Rb 1 and Rg 1 of various ginsengs were conducted using HPLC. Results : 1. CWG was relatively heat-resistant and showed slow change in color {{during the process of}} <b>steaming</b> <b>and</b> drying, compared to cultivated ginseng. 2. Ginsenoside Rg 3 was not detected in cultivated ginseng and CWG, whereas it was high in red ginseng and RWG. Ginsenoside Rg 3 was more generated in red ginseng than in RWG. 3. Ginsenoside Rh 2 appreared during <b>steaming</b> <b>and</b> drying of cultivated ginseng, whereas it was more increased during <b>steaming</b> <b>and</b> drying of CWG. 4. Ginsenoside Rg 1 content was more increased during <b>steaming</b> <b>and</b> drying of cultivated ginseng, whereas it was more decreased during <b>steaming</b> <b>and</b> drying of CWG. 5.

40|$|Abstract This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the effect of different <b>steaming</b> <b>and</b> drying temperature conditions on the physicochemical characteristics of pumpkin powder. All the samples were steamed for 30 or 60 s and then were dried using hot air at 40, 50, 60, and 70 oC. The moisture content decreased with an increase in the hot-air drying temperature, while the soluble solid content and yield increased. The color values, L, a, and b of the pumpkin powder decreased with increasing hot-air drying temperature. The pumpkin powder, which was steamed for 60 s had the highest water absorption and water solubility indexes. The carotenoid content of pumpkin powder was mostly destroyed with the increase in the <b>steaming</b> <b>and</b> drying temperatures. The total sugar and reducing sugar contents increased with increasing <b>steaming</b> <b>and</b> drying temperatures. Thus, the <b>steaming</b> <b>and</b> dehydration temperature conditions influenced the physicochemica...|$|R
5|$|Abelson's studies {{indicated}} {{that in order}} to reduce the equilibrium time, he needed to have a much greater temperature gradient. The NRL considered building it at the Naval Engineering Experiment Station in Annapolis, Maryland, but this was estimated to cost $2.5 million, which the NRL regarded as too expensive. Other sites were canvassed, and it was decided to build a new pilot plant at the Naval Boiler and Turbine Laboratory (NBTL) at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, where there was space, <b>steam</b> <b>and</b> cooling water, and, perhaps most important of all, engineers with experience with high-pressure steam. The cost was estimated at $500,000. The pilot plant was authorized by Rear Admiral Earle W. Mills, the Assistant Chief of the Bureau of Ships on 17 November 1943. Construction commenced on 1 January 1944, and was completed in July. The NBTL was responsible for the design, construction and operation of the <b>steam</b> <b>and</b> cooling water systems, while the NRL dealt with the columns and subsidiary equipment. Captain Thorvald A. Solberg from the Bureau of Ships was project officer.|$|E
5|$|Although {{sufficient}} for the Southern Railway's needs, the Nclass was an ideal test-bed for experiments with new steam technology. The first experiment entailed fitting a Worthington feed pump to No.A819 in 1924. The trial was moderately successful, and the pump remained in use until removal in 1927. In June 1930, No.A816 was withdrawn from service {{for the application of}} experimental Anderson steam conservation equipment at Eastleigh Works. This was designed by a Scottish marine draughtsman, Mr. A.P.H. Anderson, who proposed the use of a fan system to condense spent <b>steam</b> <b>and</b> improve draughting of the fire on long-distance runs in regions with poor access to water.|$|E
5|$|Beginning with Rag Doll Kung Fu in October 2005, {{third-party}} games {{became available}} for purchase and download on <b>Steam,</b> <b>and</b> Valve announced that Steam had become profitable because of some highly successful Valve games. Although digital distribution could not yet match retail volume, profit margins for Valve and developers were far larger on Steam. Large developer-publishers, including id Software, Eidos Interactive, and Capcom, began distributing their games on Steam in 2007. By May that year, 13million accounts had been created on the service, and 150 games were for sale on the platform.|$|E

5|$|Broasting uses a {{pressure}} cooker {{to accelerate the}} process. The moisture inside the chicken becomes <b>steam</b> <b>and</b> increases the pressure in the cooker, lowering the cooking temperature needed. The steam also cooks the chicken through, but still allows the pieces to be moist and tender while maintaining a crisp coating. Fat is heated in {{a pressure}} cooker. Chicken pieces are prepared as described above and then placed in the hot fat. The lid {{is placed on the}} pressure cooker, and the chicken pieces are thus fried under pressure.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, glacier caves were {{discovered}} on the then-smooth glacier surface. Many of these glacier caves were {{big enough to}} explore, like the glacier caves on the summit of Mount Rainier. Most of the glacier caves were located near the 1980s lava dome, where hot <b>steam</b> <b>and</b> volcanic gas emissions from hidden fumaroles on the crater floor or lava dome melted holes in the young glacial ice. About 7,900 feet or 2.4km of underground caves and passageways in the glacier were mapped and studied.|$|E

That evening, Pułaskis crew raised <b>steam</b> <b>and</b> sailed the ship out of the harbor {{in defiance of the}} detainment.
