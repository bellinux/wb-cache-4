5|$|The speech bubble {{makes the}} entire canvas {{relevant}} by broadening {{the attention to}} the entire width of the painting and the curves of the bubble unite the narrative with several of the picture's other graphical elements. Lichtenstein has added color, including all of the primary colors, while transforming the original and making reference to mechanical reproduction via Ben-Day dots. Like Look Mickey, {{there is reason to}} describe this image as a self-portrait of sorts. The subject is extending a finger through a circular opening, which is a self-reference because it is representative of Lichtenstein's technique of <b>stenciling</b> Ben-day dots by pressing the fluid onto the painting surface through a screen with a device not too different in size and shape from a finger. An alternative self-representation is interpreted as a singular peephole that represents the monocular subject matter of Lichtenstein's training, while the entire canvas represents a doubt in this training's representation of the physical body, its perception and its actual view. However, the corporeal is depicted quite adequately in the intense phallicism and the dotted coloration of the skin.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 3rd century, sewing, {{followed}} later by weaving, {{was introduced to}} Japan from Korea. Early textiles were made of simple twisted cords from wisteria, mulberry, hemp or ramie fibres. Following a gift of silk clothes and silk worms from the Chinese court, the Japanese court started to support textile and silk production from the 4th century onward. Chinese and Korean weavers were encouraged to exhibit their fabrics bringing new techniques such as those used to make brocades or delicate silk gauzes. In the 8th century Nara period, Japanese weavers employed {{a variety of techniques}} such as tie-dyeing, <b>stenciling,</b> batik, and embroidery. They skillfully imitated continental weaves, including rich damasks, many types of brocades and chiffon-like gauzes. Because of a general change in aesthetics in the Heian period weaving and dyeing techniques became less varied with less colourful brocades, smaller patterns, and less elaborate gauzes. The Japanese aristocracy preferred plain silks over woven or dyed designs. A total of seven National Treasures have been designated in the weaving and dyeing category, including: two mandalas, two monk's surplices or kesa, one brocade, one embroidery with a Buddhist motif and a set of garments presented to a shrine.|$|E

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, in 1903, the church sent a missionary to India. She began programs there that continued for almost 50 years. A decade later the interior was redecorated following plans by Tiffany Studios. Green stained glass windows were added, along with green <b>stenciling</b> on the walls, new chancel woodwork and a wood-glass screen in the rear.|$|E
25|$|The early Japanese {{version was}} a {{refinement}} to <b>stenciling</b> that used human hairs {{to hold together}} parts of the stencil, such as the outside and center of a circle, so that visible bridges could be eliminated. Eventually the technique evolved to use fine screens, with some areas blocked by a film and some lines or areas left open to allow paint to pass through.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, {{possibly}} {{influenced by the}} minimalism of the International Style, a second renovation of the Sanctuary took place. The mid-20th-century renovation largely ignored the architectural history of the church. Louis Comfort Tiffany's paint and <b>stenciling</b> was obscured by a coat of light gray paint, and the purple Tiffany glass installed over the stained glass was removed. The oculus of the cupola was closed up. In some ways the removal of decoration recalled the congregation's Puritan roots.|$|E
25|$|In 1984 a research-driven {{restoration}} was begun. The {{period of}} the building's construction was adopted, using old photographs and engravings as sources, and paint analysis to replicate original colors, the interior spaces were returned closely to their 1875 appearance. Walls were repainted rose madder and the original Cummings and Sears' stencil patterns were recreated. The cupola was reopened, once more admitting light to the Sanctuary below. Polychrome <b>stenciling</b> repeated the original palette of ochre, bay leaf green, warm gray, and persimmon with metallic gold.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>stenciling,</b> de Forest's touch {{can be seen in}} the incorporation of other Eastern designs and Tiffany glass. De Forest used carved teakwood, like that produced by the Ahmedabad Woodcarving Company, in the molding along the outer edge of the fireplace in Mamie Gwinn's study, as well as some picture frames in the corridor between her and Thomas's study (the Blue Room). In the third expansion of the house in 1908, de Forest decorated the ceiling of the Dorothy Vernon Room with thin sheets of patterned brass in a variety of East Indian designs. Several of the rooms also included Tiffany glass lamps or fixtures that were designed by de Forest and created in the Tiffany Studios.|$|E

The animation artists at the animation studio in South Korea, {{where much of the}} animation process takes place, had begun <b>stenciling</b> the eyes with a template, which according to Lynch resulted in [...] "strangely round eyes which look a little too big sometimes and much too perfect. Which is very un-Simpsons like." [...] Marge was designed with shorter hair in the flashback sequences to make her appear younger. Lynch thought it was nice to see Marge in a [...] "younger, more attractive mode, and sort of watching her progress through pregnancy." ...|$|E
500|$|The three {{finished}} interior floors {{have been}} renovated, modernized, and updated since the original construction. [...] One step in modernization occurred in 1965, when an elevator {{was installed in}} the building. [...] Among various renovations, {{the second and third}} floors were updated around 1980. [...] Currently, the first floor has carpeting, fluorescent lighting, and acoustic ceiling tiles. [...] The north and south facades now have modern glass doors that form vestibules at the entrances. [...] The hallway ceilings have been molded with <b>stenciling.</b> [...] Some painted scenes, which are not original to the building, {{can be found in the}} main hallway. [...] One such scene includes a painting of the original courthouse surrounded by paintings of tablets representing each of the county's four townships, each with local scenes.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{perceptible}} {{element of}} de Forest's design aesthetic in the Deanery is his <b>stenciling,</b> a technique for which his Indian workshop was known. Geometric designs were stenciled {{on the walls}} or on the ceilings throughout the house, as, for example, on {{the ceiling of the}} Blue Room, as an upper border in the dining room, a mid-height border in the corridor between the studies, and as an upper border and on the ceiling in Mamie Gwinn's study. Even the floors of the dining room were stenciled, as Thomas noted in a letter to de Forest: [...] "You remember it was so with my dining room. In four years the <b>stenciling</b> under the wax which we put on the floors was entirely worn off." [...] Several pieces of furniture were also transformed into [...] "art furniture" [...] by the addition of stenciled designs, possibly as a cost-saving measure, as the 1894–1896 renovations cost over $14,000.|$|E

2500|$|The stone, brick, and polychrome-stenciled villa at Olana is {{an unusual}} mixture of Victorian {{structural}} elements and Middle-Eastern decorative motifs from different times and places. Moorish elements mix with contrasting Italianate themes. Frederic and Isabel Church were impressed by the architecture they had seen on their travels in Beirut, Jerusalem and Damascus in 1868. Upon their return to their farm, they abandoned preliminary plans from Richard Morris Hunt delineating a manor house in the French style. Instead, Church worked closely with architect Calvert Vaux to realize a more personal vision. Church {{was responsible for the}} overall design and much of the detail, with Vaux's involvement essentially that of consultant. Church wrote to a friend, [...] "I am building a house and am principally my own Architect. I give directions all day and draw plans and working drawings all night." [...] The result was a villa with asymmetrical massing of towers and block masonry punctuated by fanciful windows and porches. The irregular silhouette of the exterior contrasted with the more regular rhythm of rooms arranged around a central hall. On the exterior, Middle Eastern motifs were carried out in colored brick, slate, ceramic tile and especially <b>stenciling.</b> The cornices of the separate sections of the structure were each ornamented with multi-colored and gilt <b>stenciling,</b> the patterns designed by Church himself. The <b>stenciling</b> continued in the principle rooms of the first floor. Together, the various motifs and themes create a unique artistic unity, one that is difficult to categorize. It has been called variously Persian-Moorish-Eclectic, and Italianate-Eastern-Picturesque. Poet John Ashbery described the results: [...] "The ensemble is breathtaking, and despite the proliferation of architectural elements and polychrome tile decoration, it is not busy but solemn and wildly fanciful, like Church's painting." ...|$|E
2500|$|Typically {{the body}} is first fired in a kiln to convert it into a hard porous bisque. Underglaze {{decoration}} may then be applied, followed by glaze, which is fired so it bonds to the body. The glazed porcelain may then be painted with overglaze decoration and fired again to bond the paint with the glaze. Most pieces use only one of underglaze or overglaze painting, the latter often being referred to as [...] "enamelled". Decorations may be applied by brush or by <b>stenciling,</b> transfer printing, lithography and screen printing.|$|E
2500|$|From the outset, Thomas {{wished to}} see a tiled floor in the Dorothy Vernon Room. While she {{originally}} asked Mercer to use octagonal tiles interspersed with small square ones, upon which de Forest would stencil additional designs, she settled on the same small square tiles {{that were used in}} the Thomas Library. The additional <b>stenciling</b> was never applied as planned, as Mercer feared that the large quantity of traffic in the room would quickly destroy the <b>stenciling,</b> as had happened in the Deanery's dining room. Four larger tiles with Old English designs were incorporated to differentiate this design from others on campus. For the Deanery vestibule, Thomas requested that Mercer create a new design that he had not used on campus in the other buildings. In a letter to Mercer from 1908, Thomas rejected the diagonal pattern that Mercer created, on account of her dislike of diagonals for being [...] "unrestful." [...] In response, Mercer created a straight pattern that consisted of alternating plain square tiles and square tiles stamped with the letters THO-MAS. which were inspired by a 14th-century British tile design. In addition to the floors in these two public spaces, Mercer's tiles were also used in the fireplace in Mary Garrett's bedroom. In her correspondence with Mercer from 1908, Thomas asked Mercer his advice on what sort of tile would be most useful and pretty for such a project, referencing a fireplace that Mercer had similarly decorated.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} nineteenth century, {{itinerant}} artists would stencil walls in exchange for room and board. These artists would cut patterns from thin wood or heavy paper {{and use them to}} decorate walls and furniture. Stencil House’s parlor, dining room, and entrance hall exhibit a variety of <b>stenciled</b> patterns, including a grape leaf border, vases of flowers, and patriotic eagles, while Dutton House’s rooms and hallways reflect their original <b>stenciled</b> patterns.|$|R

[...] Trimmed in vermillion, the beams are fastened together by gold star-shaped bolts.

[...] The chancel and apse ceiling is painted in terra-cotta and features <b>stenciling</b> in gold leaf.

[...] The redesigned house features wood floors, <b>stenciling</b> in the entryway, and faux crown molding in the dining room. The color palette is now blues, roses, soft yellow, and gold colors, and the furniture is a mix of period piecessome originally owned by the Williams familyand contemporary furniture. [...] The theater was converted to a kitchen, and the bathroom was upgraded with antique fixtures.|$|E
