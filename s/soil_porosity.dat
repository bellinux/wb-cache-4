50|$|Humus {{formation}} {{is a process}} dependent {{on the amount of}} plant material added each year and the type of base soil. Both are affected by climate and the type of organisms present. Soils with humus can vary in nitrogen content but typically have 3 to 6 percent nitrogen. Raw organic matter, as a reserve of nitrogen and phosphorus, is a vital component affecting soil fertility. Humus also absorbs water, and expands and shrinks between dry and wet states, increasing <b>soil</b> <b>porosity.</b> Humus is less stable than the soil's mineral constituents, as it is reduced by microbial decomposition, and over time its concentration diminshes without the addition of new organic matter.

In a stable shifting cultivation system, the fallow is {{long enough for the}} natural vegetation to recover to the state that it was in before it was cleared, and for the soil to recover to the condition it was in before cropping began. During fallow periods soil temperatures are lower, wind and water erosion is much reduced, nutrient cycling becomes closed again, nutrients are extracted from the subsoil, soil fauna decreases, acidity is reduced, soil structure, texture and moisture characteristics improve and seed banks are replenished.|$|E

There are similar impacts on campgrounds such as soil compaction, erosion and composition, loss of vegetation and foliage plus the additional issues of campfires for cooking and heat. Informal trails are created around the campsite in order to collect firewood and water, and trees and saplings can be trampled, damaged or cut-down for fuel. The heat or burning of the campfire can harm the tree-root system. In formal campgrounds, tent pad areas are normally devoid of any vegetation while random camping can damage sensitive plants and grasses during a single overnight stay.|$|E

50|$|Sand and silt are the {{products}} of physical and chemical weathering of the parent rock; clay, on the other hand, is a most often {{the product of the}} precipitation of the dissolved parent rock as a secondary mineral. It is the surface area to volume ratio (specific surface area) of soil particles and the unbalanced ionic charges within those that determine their role in the fertility of soil, as measured by its cation exchange capacity. Sand is least active, followed by silt; clay is the most active. Sand's greatest benefit to soil is that it resists compaction and increases a <b>soil's</b> <b>porosity.</b> Silt is mineralogically like sand but with its higher specific surface area it is more chemically active than sand. But it is the clay content of soil, with its very high specific surface area and generally large number of negative charges, that gives a soil its high retention capacity for water and nutrients. Clay soils also resist wind and water erosion better than silty and sandy soils, as the particles bond tightly to each other.|$|R
50|$|The {{physical}} properties of soils, {{in order of}} decreasing importance, are texture, structure, density, porosity, consistency, temperature, colour and resistivity. Soil texture {{is determined by the}} relative proportion of the three kinds of soil mineral particles, called soil separates: sand, silt, and clay. At the next larger scale, soil structures called peds are created from the soil separates when iron oxides, carbonates, clay, silica and humus, coat particles and cause them to adhere into larger, relatively stable secondary structures. Soil density, particularly bulk density, is a measure of soil compaction. <b>Soil</b> <b>porosity</b> consists of the void part of the soil volume and is occupied by gases or water. Soil consistency is the ability of soil to stick together. Soil temperature and colour are self-defining. Resistivity refers to the resistance to conduction of electric currents and affects the rate of corrosion of metal and concrete structures. These properties may vary through the depth of a soil profile. Most of these properties determine the aeration of the soil and the ability of water to infiltrate and to be held within the soil.|$|E
50|$|Plants obtain their carbon from {{atmospheric}} carbon dioxide. About 45% of a plant's {{dry mass}} is carbon; plant residues typically have a carbon to nitrogen ratio (C/N) of between 13:1 and 100:1. As the soil organic material is digested by arthropods and micro-organisms, the C/N decreases as the carbonaceous material is metabolized {{and carbon dioxide}} (CO2) is released as a byproduct which then finds {{its way out of}} the soil and into the atmosphere. The nitrogen is sequestered in the bodies of the living matter of those decomposing organisms and so it builds up in the soil. Normal CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is 0.03%, this can be the factor limiting plant growth. In a field of maize on a still day during high light conditions in the growing season, the CO2 concentration drops very low, but under such conditions the crop could use up to 20 times the normal concentration. The respiration of CO2 by soil micro-organisms decomposing soil organic matter contributes an important amount of CO2 to the photosynthesising plants. Within the soil, CO2 concentration is 10 to 100 times that of atmospheric levels but may rise to toxic levels if the <b>soil</b> <b>porosity</b> is low or if diffusion is impeded by flooding.|$|E
50|$|The {{atmosphere}} of soil is {{radically different from}} the atmosphere above. The consumption of oxygen, by microbes and plant roots and their release of carbon dioxide, decrease oxygen and increase carbon dioxide concentration. Atmospheric CO2 concentration is 0.04%, but in the soil pore space it may range from 10 to 100 times that level. At extreme levels CO2 is toxic. In addition, the soil voids are saturated with water vapour. Adequate porosity is necessary, not just to allow the penetration of water, but also to allow gases to diffuse in and out. Movement of gases is by diffusion from high concentrations to lower. Oxygen diffuses in and is consumed and excess levels of carbon dioxide, diffuse out with other gases as well as water. Soil texture and structure strongly affect <b>soil</b> <b>porosity</b> and gas diffusion. It is the total pore space (porosity) of soil not the pore size that determines the rate of diffusion of gases {{into and out of}} soil. A Platy soil structure and compacted soils (low porosity) impede gas flow, and a deficiency of oxygen may encourage anaerobic bacteria to reduce (strip oxygen) from nitrate NO3 to the gases N2, N2O, and NO, which are then lost to the atmosphere, thereby depleting the soil of nitrogen. Aerated soil is also a net sink of methane CH4 but a net producer of greenhouse gases when soils are depleted of oxygen and subject to elevated temperatures.|$|E

Infectivity was similar for each individual species, but G.  mosseae and G.  intraradices together resulted in the lowest per cent root length colonised. Despite the lower percentage colonisation, this combination induced the greatest mycorrhizal growth response.

40|$|Endogeic {{earthworms}} significantly modify soil aggregation and porosity, {{which in}} turn control water flow in soil. This study aimed {{to determine how the}} earthworm casting activity influences <b>soil</b> <b>porosity</b> and its dynamics. The main hypothesis was that the deposition of belowground water-stable casts increases <b>soil</b> <b>porosity</b> and its water stability. First we quantified cast production by the endogeic earthworm species Metaphire posthuma under laboratory conditions for 15 days. Secondly, casts and the bulk soil were analysed for structural stability to water and were packed in soil and subjected to wetting under various conditions and energy levels. The shape and size of pores were measured by image analysis. Almost all casts (98 %) were produced belowground. M. posthuma produced approximately five times its own weight per day. Casts were depleted in C and were more easily disaggregated by water than the bulk soil. Although casts initially led to larger <b>soil</b> <b>porosity</b> (on average 50 %), their structure was unstable. As a consequence, water inputs led to a faster decrease in <b>soil</b> <b>porosity</b> in the presence of casts. Large pores in between casts were rapidly replaced by small elongated and rounded pores. These results suggest that cast lifespan and associated porosity are of primary importance in the regulation of <b>soil</b> <b>porosity</b> turnover and the ecological functions that are under its control. Our findings suggest that in the field, the low stability of casts is likely to lead to a rapid compaction of the soil after rainfall events. However, high levels of cast production may prevent <b>soil</b> <b>porosity</b> from being broken down. Soil structural porosity thus depends on the balance between the production and degradation of casts. Improvements to the soil structure will occur when the former predominates. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.
