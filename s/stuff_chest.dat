6000|$|Sept. 21.--Private Montease in bed all day. Cook anxious [...] "to do her bit" [...] {{rubbed his}} chest with home-made embrocation. Believe it is same <b>stuff</b> she rubs <b>chests</b> in hall with. Smells the same anyway.|$|R
5000|$|In (P), (WW), and {{the other}} variants, the devil is tricked into bearing chests with the women hidden inside, whereas in (Calv.) he is asked to carry back bags of laundry, to the women's mother, who is a widowed washerwoman. Here, (Calv.) adapts from (V) where the clever {{daughter}} tells the devil she is <b>stuffing</b> the <b>chest</b> with a [...] "bit of stuff (or clothes) to wash" [...] (un poca de roba a lavar).|$|R
50|$|The {{beginning}} in Europe of continual and increasingly rapid change in clothing styles can be fairly reliably dated. Historians, including James Laver and Fernand Braudel, date {{the start of}} Western fashion in clothing {{to the middle of}} the 14th century, though it should be noted that they tend to rely heavily on contemporary imagery and illuminated manuscripts were not common before the fourteenth century. The most dramatic early change in fashion was a sudden drastic shortening and tightening of the male over-garment from calf-length to barely covering the buttocks, sometimes accompanied with <b>stuffing</b> in the <b>chest</b> to make it look bigger. This created the distinctive Western outline of a tailored top worn over leggings or trousers.|$|R
5000|$|... "That song {{is about}} {{the person in the}} world that I hate more than Saddam Hussein," [...] Rose said. [...] "It was good {{to be able to get}} that <b>stuff</b> off my <b>chest</b> because I was able to express myself without doing {{anything}} stupid that would get me in trouble." [...] Guitarist John Connolly also noted, [...] "Dez is just a piece of shit. He’s just one of those people where, he’s basically a bad person. There’s good people and bad people in this world, and he’s just, he wants to be a good person and he wants to act like a good person, but he’s really just a bad dude and he’s just looking out for himself." ...|$|R
60|$|What {{happened}} {{inside the}} cavern the fagot-maker could neither see nor hear, but minute after minute passed while he sat as in a maze {{at all that}} had happened. Then presently he heard a deep thundering voice and a voice as {{of one of the}} old men in answer. Then there came a sound swelling louder and louder, as though a great crowd of people were gathering together, and with the voices came the noise of the neighing of horses and the trampling of hoofs. Then at last there came pouring from out the rock a great crowd of horses laden with bales and bundles of rich <b>stuffs</b> and <b>chests</b> and caskets of gold and silver and jewels, and each horse was led by a slave clad in a dress of cloth-of-gold, sparkling and glistening with precious gems. When all these had come out from the cavern, other horses followed, upon each of which sat a beautiful damsel, more lovely than the fancy of man could picture. Beside the damsels marched a guard, each man clad in silver armor, and each bearing a drawn sword that flashed in the brightening day more keenly than the lightning. So they all came pouring forth from the cavern until it seemed as though the whole woods below were filled with the wealth and the beauty of King Solomon's day--and then, last of all, came the three old men.|$|R
2500|$|Promotion on {{the album}} ended soon after its December release and Norwood {{subsequently}} started work on a second album with Epic Records. Amongst those to record with her were songwriting and production partners Tricky Stewart, The-Dream, Stargate, Ne-Yo, and Human collaborator Brian Kennedy. Expressing her dissatisfaction with Humans commercial performance, Norwood told Blues & Soul magazine she was [...] "a little disappointed about that" [...] but also felt [...] "pleased that Sony has given me another chance to do another project that I feel they're totally behind. In hindsight I do feel the last album was a little political. So a lotta changes have been made since Human – and hopefully they're changes for the better! Because, having got all the deep <b>stuff</b> off my <b>chest,</b> I'm now able to really tap into the fun part of music again [...] it's exactly the type of album that I need to be makiing right now!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Not {{long into}} production, Stern found himself {{at odds with}} TBS {{management}} regarding {{the direction of the}} series. This led to an incident on March 8, 1999 in which he improvised a raunchy performance art piece that involved full nudity and breaking two liquor bottles on the show's set. Stern was promptly fired for the incident despite claiming that he had permission from network officials to do what he called [...] "improv comedy" [...] described as [...] "trying to get <b>stuff</b> off my <b>chest</b> about the wrong-headed direction the show was taking." [...] On June 9, one day before the Chimp Channel series premiere, Stern filed a breach-of-contract suit against TBS, Warner Bros. Domestic Pay TV, Telescopic Pictures, and Palomar Pictures in Los Angeles, seeking damages in excess of $1,675,000. Stern was represented in the suit by Los Angeles attorney David Wall. Production of the series continued for a few more months without its creative founder.|$|R
40|$|I grew up {{predominantly}} in {{a context}} of privilege and protection, with a goodly smattering of denial and despair. I remember as a child sitting in my mother’s sewing room watching her mend socks wondering why – like the other kids—I couldn’t just get new socks instead. It wasn’t until later, far past the time those stitches became the soul-saving sutures of the permanent vest my mother stitched across my beloved <b>stuffed</b> rabbit’s <b>chest,</b> that I realized those mending stitches reflected an act of care – of preserving and mending relationship. Like many, I {{live in a world of}} contradiction, and the warmth of this literal mending was juxtaposed by a cultural tattering left unattended. My family spent many holidays with Gert-and- Dorothy. Gert was my grandmother’s sister, yet the Gert-and-Dorothy duo was such a tight pair you never uttered one name without the other. It wasn’t until my late twenties, after coming out myself, that I realized just who Dorothy was and why they were so comfortably together for many years. The L-word was not in my family’s or that decade’s vocabulary. I never heard how they met, how they struggled, how they cared for one another. Histories lost – possibilities of connection left unnamed and unexplored. Here I am many years later having recently returned from a trip to Cambodia. During my recent travel, I was struck by the intense beauty of the Cambodian textiles, a rich tradition lying in stark contrast to the poverty Cambodia faces, yet somehow completely in harmony with the warmth and beauty of the people themselves. I was struck by the fact that had I been there only 30 years prior, I would have witnessed the great devastation of a culture, a full scale attack on the people from both within and without that decimated the land and destroyed over 30 % of the population, and devastated a country’s cultural and aesthetic memory. I was struck also by a current phenomenon: the teeming number of organizations that recognize a potent route to regaining cultural memory and richness is to rebuild working knowledge of traditional craft. I could feast my eyes and soul on the majesty of hand-dyed and hand-woven ikats...|$|R
40|$|For millennia fabric banners {{have served}} as {{indicators}} of political affiliation and national allegiance. Flags are steeped in the foundational mythology of a country, region, or group. Flags sum up moments of glory (while ignoring ignominious history). Flags foster a pride in identity that can unite people. Flags are the <b>stuff</b> of swelled <b>chests</b> and Independence Day parades. But countries are composed of individuals who have private histories, relationships, hopes and dreams. Some people (or their ancestors) know firsthand their country’s failure to offer equality and justice to all its citizens. Most people use this national symbol to shade patriotism with their own particular concerns. By visually associating a position with the national icon, groups can wave the flag of patriotism—and lobby for their candidate, depict history in a particular light, or justify their special interests. Not surprisingly artists have employed flags or the depiction of flags. Like all material culture, these objects and images may be read superficially as reflective of nationalistic or geographic influence. Or they might be read more deeply—taking into account what precipitated the work. In Eugene Delacroix’s Liberty Leading the People from 1830, the historical context is not the French Revolution but the three-day revolt of 1830 that forced the abdication of Charles X. Besides serving as a national or public record, this painting also holds Delacroix’s ideology. Wearing a tall, black hat, Delacroix included himself in the scene as both witness and supporter of this group act...|$|R
