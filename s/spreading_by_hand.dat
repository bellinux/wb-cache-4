40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of various straw management and tillage systems on the emergence, grain yield and cob characteristics of maize (Zea mays L.) under different cereal rotations on two soils (Orthic Luvisols) of loamy sand and sandy loam textures. The study was conducted in 1999, 2002 and 2003 in a micro-plot (1 x 1 m) experiment. Concrete walls, 120 cm deep, separated each plot of 1 x 1 m (five replicates). Straw management systems included: removed straw (RS) and left straw (LS) in the amount of annual straw yield. The retained straw was chopped and <b>spread</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand.</b> Under each straw management system the three following tillage systems were applied: conventional tillage (CT), reduced tillage (RT), no-tillage (NT) with sowing to the uncultivated soil and chemical weed control. Each treatment had five replicates giving a total of sixty micro-plots. The preceding crops of maize were rye, winter wheat or maize, depending on the soil and year. The same maize varieties were used in both soils (Antares in 1999 - 2000 and Matilda in 2003). There was a tendency towards poorer maize emergence in plots with retained straw compared to removed straw under no-tillage system compared to conventionally tilled system in both soils. The results indicated that the reduced tillage systems in combination with chopped straw can be applied on the studied soils without any significant decrease in maize grain yield...|$|R

40|$|A consorciação com a gliricídia controla as plantas daninhas do milho. Com o objetivo de entender melhor esse controle, realizou-se uma análise do crescimento do milho em consorciação com a gliricídia. O híbrido duplo AG 1051 foi cultivado com capinas (duas capinas, aos 20 e 40 dias após a semeadura), sem capinas e em consorciação com a gliricídia. Na consorciação, a gliricídia foi semeada a lanço, com 25 sementes viáveis m- 2, por ocasião da semeadura do milho, entre as fileiras desta cultura. Utilizou-se o delineamento de blocos completos casualizados com parcelas subdivididas e oito repetições. O controle de plantas daninhas foi aplicado às parcelas, e as 13 coletas da parte aérea das plantas, para avaliação da área foliar e da matéria seca, às subparcelas. As coletas foram feitas de sete em sete dias, a partir dos 14 dias após a semeadura. Pode ser concluído que o controle das plantas daninhas com duas capinas determinou maiores valores na área e matéria seca foliares, bem como na matéria seca total da planta. Nessas características, as plantas das parcelas consorciadas apresentaram comportamento intermediário entre plantas das parcelas capinadas e das não capinadas. Portanto, as plantas daninhas reduzem o crescimento do milho, e a gliricídia provavelmente controla parcialmente o mato, beneficiando o milho. Não houve diferenças entre tratamentos de controle de plantas daninhas nas taxas de crescimento absolutas e relativas, área foliar específica e taxa assimilatória líquida. A maior razão de área foliar foi observada com a consorciação com gliricídia. The maize/gliricidia {{intercropping}} {{is known}} to control weeds. The aim of this work was {{to carry out a}} growth analysis of maize intercropped with gliricidia, to better evaluate the weed control. The double-hybrid AG 1051 was used and the crop was managed with three weed control procedures: (a) no-weeding; (b) two manual-weedings (at 20 and 40 days after seeding); and (c) maize intercropped with gliricidia, whose seeds were evenly <b>spread</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> between maize rows just after maize sowing, using 25 seeds m- 2. The experiment was a randomized complete block design, arranged in split-plots with eight replications. Weed control was applied to the plots, with the subplots consisting of ten plant samplings to evaluate leaf area and shoot dry matter yield. Maize shoot samplings were collected every seven days, 14 days after sowing. The control of weeds with two weedings resulted in higher values in area and leaf dry matter, as well as in total plant dry matter. Regarding these traits, the plants of the intercropped plots showed intermediate behavior between plants of weeded plots and plants of non-weeded plots. Therefore, weeds reduce the growth of maize while gliricidia probably partially controls the weeds, benefiting maize. There were no differences between treatments for weed control regarding absolute growth rates and relative growth rates, specific leaf area, and net assimilation rate. The highest leaf area ratio of maize was observed with gliricidia intercropping...|$|R

RobertsMany {{pathogenic}} microorganisms are <b>spread</b> <b>by</b> contaminated <b>hands</b> and {{may lead}} to foodborne illness. The use of hand sanitizers can significantly reduce bacterial contamination and is an efficient and inexpensive method to prevent infections and sickness. Previous {{researchers have found that}} the routine use of hand sanitizers allowed the U. S. Army to significantly reduce illness. However, few studies have been conducted within a U. S. Army dining facility, which is considered {{to be one of the}} primary sources of foodborne illness within the U. S. Army. Therefore, using the Theory of Planned Behavior, the purpose of this study was to identify the behavioral intention, attitudes, subjective norms, and perceptions of control of using hand sanitizer among military personnel. The study targeted soldiers using a written survey during their lunch hour on the U. S. Army base at Fort Riley, KS. A total of 201 surveys were collected. All data were screened and entered into IBM SPSS for analysis. Results indicated that attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control explained 64 % of the variance in behavioral intention. Attitude and subjective norms were found to be significant predictors of behavioral intention, with attitude being the strongest predictor. In general, behavioral beliefs were positive among soldiers. Related to normative beliefs, soldiers did perceive negative social pressure from other soldiers not to use hand sanitizers. Analysis of control beliefs found soldiers perceived hand sanitizers were readily available, but disliked their smell and feel after application. Food production managers and Army commanders can use these results to implement hand sanitation behavioral interventions within military dining environments. Practical implications will likely translate to reduced healthcare costs, decreased absenteeism rates, and improved mission readiness. Some of the limitations include commonly perceived social psychology bias. Further, clustered samples were collected within one military installation in a relatively short amount of time...|$|R
