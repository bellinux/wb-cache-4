6000|$|... [SHE appears. Much {{younger than}} the PROFESSOR, pale, very [...] pretty, of a Botticellian type in face, figure, and in her [...] {{clinging}} cream-coloured frock. <b>She</b> <b>gazes</b> <b>at</b> her abstracted [...] husband; then swiftly moves to the lintel of the open window, [...] and stands looking out.] ...|$|R

60|$|The {{poor girl}} heard, but {{no sign of}} {{appreciation}} moved her pale face as <b>she</b> <b>gazed</b> up <b>at</b> the approaching chaos of waters.|$|R
