40|$|Active Twist Rotor Blades {{have been}} {{developed}} for the use in secondary control such as higher harmonic control (HHC) and individual blade control (IBC). The basic principle of such blades is the implementation of piezoelectric actuators into the blades, using different types of coupling, causing the blades to twist. At the DLR five model scale rotor blades have been manufactured to demonstrate the feasibility of such systems in a complete four bladed rotor, leaving one <b>spare</b> <b>blade.</b> The rotor is meant to be tested in a wind tunnel experiment within the STAR consortium. The reference for this blade design is the BO 105 model rotor with a scaling factor of approximately 1 : 2. 5. The C-spar and the glas skin are also used in the active blades, as well as the rectangular planform. The blades are equipped with 24 piezoceramic actuators in the blade skin each, 12 on the upper and 12 on the lower side respectively. The blades are equipped with different amounts of strain gauges and pressure sensors, which cause small differences between the blades. This paper presents results of the experimental testing of those DLR active twist blades. A comparison to simulations is also given. The experimental testing includes cantilevered bench testing of blade dynamics and actuation performance, the experimental analysis of its elastic axis, stiffnesses as well as geometric and mass properties for each individual blade. The methods to derive this data is presented as well. The data that is shown in this paper represents all needed data for the use as an input for rotor simulation with comprehensive codes. Deviations are discussed and compared with simulations. Especially the actuation of the blades is discussed and different measurements of the actuation are presented, always comparing all five different blades and discussion of their differences. A special focus is put on the nonlinearities of the twist actuation, showing experimental results of just one blade for tip twist with different DC voltage offsets as well as different amplitudes. Especially a dependency of the tip twist in accordance with the actuation frequency is demonstrated for very low frequencies (< 1 Hz), where the dynamics of the blade should not have any influence on the blade behaviour. The results indicate phenomena, which are caused by the piezoceramic actuators themselves. These dependencies will make a difference for any quasi steady excitation – as it may be needed for active tracking for example. Finally the electric power used in one of the blades is analysed in more detail, showing dependencies of the frequencies and applied voltage amplitudes. Piezoceramic actuators are usually modelled in FE and analytical models in a linear simplification using d 33 as one constant value regardless of the frequency, amplitude and DC offset of the signal. This paper will help to show the limits of such simplifications for active twist blades...|$|E

5|$|Thrust is {{provided}} by four Rolls-Royce Mermaid azimuth thruster type podded propulsion units, each featuring one forward-facing low-vibration propeller with separately bolted blades. The forward pair of thrusters is fixed, but the aft pair can swivel through 360°, removing {{the need for a}} rudder. The Queen Mary 2 is the first quadruple-propeller passenger ship completed since the SS France in 1961. Queen Mary 2 carries eight <b>spare</b> <b>blades</b> on the foredeck, immediately forward of the bridge screen.|$|R
50|$|Modular {{propellers}} offer boaters {{several advantages}} a fixed-pitch propeller. The {{ability to change}} blades allows boat to make adjustments in pitch for various performance needs or a change in altitude. Carrying <b>spare</b> <b>blades</b> for this purpose takes up considerably less space then carrying a complete spare propeller. The ability to replace blades also offers the advantage of replacing damaged blades while still on the water, and saves long term repair costs. Other options include adjusting pitch for altitude, water sports, cruising, and quick turnover time.|$|R
50|$|Three {{fixed-pitch}} propellers provide Arktika {{with its}} thrust, power, and maneuverability. The starboard and centerline propellers turn clockwise while the port turns counter clockwise to compensate. Each propeller {{sits at the}} end of a 20 meter (65.6 ft) shaft and has four blades, which weigh seven tons and are attached by nine bolts to the hub which is 5.7 meters (18.7 ft) in diameter and weighs 50 tonnes. Arktika also carries four <b>spare</b> <b>blades</b> along with the appropriate diving equipment and tools so that propeller repairs may be made at sea; the operation can take anywhere from 1-4 days depending on the extent of the damage.|$|R

5000|$|For the 2001 summer season, Galaxy was {{replaced}} by the brand-new [...] in the Alaskan service. As a result, Galaxy was relocated into European waters, cruising the Mediterranean and Baltic Seas. On 2 June 2001, while departing Amsterdam in the Netherlands for a two-week cruise the Galaxy touched bottom on an outskirt of Forteiland at IJmuiden due to heavy northwesterly squalls, resulting in major damage to the port side propeller. The ship returned to the Port of Amsterdam for inspection and disembarkation of the passengers. The cruise had to be cancelled as the Galaxy went into drydock at Blohm + Voss in Hamburg, Germany. There it was discovered that all four blades of the port side propeller would have to be replaced; however the ship only carried two <b>spare</b> <b>blades</b> on board. To solve the problem two extra propeller blades carried on board Galaxys sister ship MV Mercury were flown from the Caribbean to Hamburg and installed on the Galaxy. Following repairs the ship re-entered service on 16 June 2001.|$|R

The key is identified via one of several antennas in the car's bodywork and a radio pulse generator in the key housing. Depending on the system, the vehicle is automatically unlocked when a button or sensor on the door handle or trunk release is pressed. Vehicles with a smart-key system fitted have a mechanical backup, usually {{in the form of}} a <b>spare</b> key <b>blade</b> supplied with the vehicle. Some manufacturers hide the backup lock behind a cover for styling.|$|R
50|$|The largest {{construction}} or workplace utility knives typically feature retractable and replaceable blades, made of either die-cast metal or molded plastic. Some use standard razor blades, others specialized double-ended utility blades. The user can adjust {{how far the}} blade extends from the handle, so that, for example, the knife {{can be used to}} cut the tape sealing a package without damaging the contents of the package. When the blade becomes dull, it can be quickly reversed or switched for a new one. <b>Spare</b> or used <b>blades</b> are stored in the hollow handle of some models, and can be accessed by removing a screw and opening the handle. Other models feature a quick-change mechanism that allows replacing the blade without tools, as well as a flip-out blade storage tray. The blades for this type of utility knife come in both double- and single-ended versions, and are interchangeable with many, but not all, of the later copies. Specialized blades also exist for cutting string, linoleum, and other materials.|$|R
40|$|Mira Sanders FDC Satellite, Brussels, Belgium Visual {{analysis}} and anecdotal descriptions converge in ‘Silent Letters’ (2009), the six video {{works at the}} centre of Belgian artist Mira Sanders’ exhibition ‘Invisible Lines’. A series of diaristic observations subtitling everyday scenes – cats darting over cobblestone paths and around beach volleyball games – spin travelogue commentary and light philosophy into epistolary entries that always refer back to ‘the line’. The lines in Sander’s work are both everywhere and nowhere: nondescript scenes provide an occasion to talk about boundaries and borders, from the volleyball net bisecting the frame of Silent Letter 22012009 (2009) to a reference to hopscotch. Likewise, the choppy flow of pedestrians walking past policemen regulating traffic in Silent Letter 27042008 (2009) speaks to guidelines and boundaries of an invisible order. A rolling progression of texts – set against a black background in Silent Letter, # Quotations (2009) – further emphasize the elusiveness of subdivisions, shifting the focus from boundaries to the line as {{it is used to}} create perspective. In one quote appearing in the video, excerpted from ‘The Horizon: A See – change’, Johann Wolfgang van Goethe credits the ‘simple noble line’ of the horizon as gifting him with not only inspiration, but the capability of drawing himself into relation with his surroundings. Relationships of scale are further explored in two black and white photographs of the hatched-line incisions on a cutting board in the artist’s studio next to crumpled bits of paper, soft balls of fibre and a <b>spare</b> cutting <b>blade</b> (Scale 1 : 2500 [Studio # 1 and # 2], 2009). In contrast, a selection of punchy and playful drawings from ‘Le dialogue de sourds’ (Dialogue of the Deaf, 2005 –ongoing) maps a conversation between images supplied by Sanders and accompanying texts added by art historian Marie-Pascale Gildemyn. There is no clear narrative in this humorous and sketchy series of vignettes that clarifies the purpose of the exchange, but it has lasted for six years. The drawing Paradis Artificiel. Paradis Perdu. Paradou (ill. 3) (Artificial Paradise, Paradise Lost, Paradou [ill. 3], 2005), for example, pairs an isolated palm tree with a brief note taken from a Wikipedia entry on an oasis. Sanders takes an ambling approach towards thinking about lines, but she is right in the sense that most are imagined or invisible. In its best moments, Sanders’ epistolary mode of address approaches competent poetry – but a series of contour line drawings of overlapping and continuously touching workplace tools on view in a back room overextend the trope of the line in a bit of thematic overkill. These works refer to the edges and borders of objects in a far too literal sense, missing at least two key elements that makes Sander’s otherwise promising work so strong: the artist addressing the landscape and viewer as a foreign observer and the weaving of critical observations into imaginative fictions through correspondence.
