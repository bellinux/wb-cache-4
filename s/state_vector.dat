25|$|Mathematically, a pure {{quantum state}} can be {{represented}} by a ray in a Hilbert space over the complex numbers. The ray {{is a set of}} nonzero vectors differing by just a complex scalar factor; any of them can be chosen as a <b>state</b> <b>vector</b> to represent the ray and thus the state. A unit vector is usually picked, but its phase factor can be chosen freely anyway. Nevertheless, such factors are important when state vectors are added together to form a superposition.|$|E
25|$|The {{combination}} of intrinsic (spin-transfer torque) and extrinsic (resistive switching) mechanisms naturally {{leads to a}} second-order memristive system described by the <b>state</b> <b>vector</b> x=(x1,x2), where x1 describes the magnetic state of the electrodes and x2 denotes the resistive state of the MgO barrier. In this case the change of x1 is current-controlled (spin torque {{is due to a}} high current density) whereas the change of x2 is voltage-controlled (the drift of oxygen vacancies is due to high electric fields). The presence of both effects in a memristive magnetic tunnel junction led {{to the idea of a}} nanoscopic synapse-neuron system.|$|E

25|$|Much of the {{mathematical}} apparatus {{of quantum mechanics}} appears in the classical description of a polarized sinusoidal electromagnetic wave. The Jones vector for a classical wave, for instance, is identical with the quantum polarization <b>state</b> <b>vector</b> for a photon. The right and left circular components of the Jones vector {{can be interpreted as}} probability amplitudes of spin states of the photon. Energy conservation requires that the states be transformed with a unitary operation. This implies that infinitesimal transformations are transformed with a Hermitian operator. These conclusions are a natural consequence of the structure of Maxwell's equations for classical waves.|$|E
25|$|During manned Apollo missions, {{the vehicle}} coasted in Earth orbit for 2-4 passes as the crew {{performed}} checks of systems status and other tasks, and as ground stations tracked the vehicle. During {{the hour and}} a half after launch, tracking stations around the world had refined estimates of the vehicle's position and velocity, collectively known as its <b>state</b> <b>vector.</b> The latest estimates were relayed to the guidance systems in the IU, and to the Command Module Computer in the spacecraft. When the Moon, Earth, and vehicle were in the optimum geometrical configuration, the third stage was reignited to put the vehicle into a translunar orbit. For Apollo 15, for example, this burn lasted 5 minutes 55 seconds.|$|E
25|$|Early {{scientific}} thought often {{portrayed the}} universe as deterministic – for example in the thought of Democritus or the Cārvākans – and some thinkers claimed that the simple process of gathering sufficient information {{would allow them to}} predict future events with perfect accuracy. Modern science, on the other hand, is a mixture of deterministic and stochastic theories. Quantum mechanics predicts events only in terms of probabilities, casting doubt on whether the universe is deterministic at all, although evolution of the universal <b>state</b> <b>vector</b> is completely deterministic. Current physical theories cannot resolve the question of whether determinism is true of the world, being very far from a potential Theory of Everything, and open to many different interpretations.|$|E

25|$|The {{description}} of photon polarization contains {{many of the}} physical concepts {{and much of the}} mathematical machinery of more involved quantum descriptions, such as the quantum mechanics of an electron in a potential well, and forms a fundamental basis for an understanding of more complicated quantum phenomena. Much of the mathematical machinery of quantum mechanics, such as state vectors, probability amplitudes, unitary operators, and Hermitian operators, emerge naturally from the classical Maxwell's equations in the description. The quantum polarization <b>state</b> <b>vector</b> for the photon, for instance, is identical with the Jones vector, usually used to describe the polarization of a classical wave. Unitary operators emerge from the classical requirement of the conservation of energy of a classical wave propagating through lossless media that alter the polarization state of the wave. Hermitian operators then follow for infinitesimal transformations of a classical polarization state.|$|E
500|$|The Born rule {{states that}} an {{observable}} property of a quantum system {{is defined by}} a Hermitian operator on a separable Hilbert space, that the only observable values of the property are the eigenvalues of the operator, and that the probability of the system being observed in a particular eigenvalue is {{the square of the}} absolute value of the complex number obtained by projecting the <b>state</b> <b>vector</b> (a point in the Hilbert space) onto the corresponding eigenvector.|$|E
500|$|Matrix powers appear {{often in}} the context of {{discrete}} dynamical systems, where the matrix A expresses a transition from a <b>state</b> <b>vector</b> x of some system to the next state Ax of the system. [...] This is the standard interpretation of a Markov chain, for example. [...] Then [...] is the state of the system after two time steps, and so forth: [...] is the state of the system after n time steps. [...] The matrix power [...] is the transition matrix between the state now and the state at a time n steps in the future. [...] So computing matrix powers is equivalent to solving the evolution of the dynamical system.

2500|$|While {{the state}} vectors are {{constant}} in {{time in the}} Heisenberg picture, the physical states they represent are not.

40|$|Four SL(2,C) spinors are {{considered}} {{within the framework}} of Wigner's little groups which dictate internal space-time symmetries of relativistic particles. It is indicated that the little group for a massive particle at rest is O(3), while it is O(3) -like for a moving massive particle.

Spin- 1 / 2 particles are studied in detail, and the origin of the gauge degrees of freedom for massless particles is clarified. The <b>state</b> <b>vectors</b> for the O(3) and O(3) -like little groups are constructed.
