40|$|Prior to European settlement, {{the area}} that would later become Norman, Oklahoma was {{dominated}} by prairie vegetation. Woody vegetation was limited to riparian zones and isolated groves presumably protected {{from the effects of}} fire. The contemporary landscape of Norman, stands in stark contrast to this “treeless” prairie, and is now characterized by a so-called urban forest. In this paper, we analyze a number of archival sources, ranging from early expedition and traveler accounts to postsettlement photography in order to qualitatively assess the nature of the landscape in and around the present-day city of Norman prior to and immediately following European settlement. We also utilize repeat photography to document the floristic and vegetation changes that have occurred. We found that the pre-European settlement landscape was characterized by rolling prairies heavily influenced by the grazing of black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus), bison (Bison bison), and pronghorn antelope (Antilocapra americana). Forbs were limited and herbaceous vegetation was dominated primarily by closely grazed grasses. Woody vegetation was limited primarily to watercourses and ravines, though numerous accounts cite thickets of oaks (Quercusspp.) occurring in the adjacent cross timbers. Today, the vegetation of Norman is characterized by the dominance of woody vegetation. Within Norman’s historical residential areas, commonly occurring species include hackberry (Celtis occidentalis), <b>Shumard’s</b> <b>oak</b> (Q. shumardii), silver maple (Acer saccharinum), and sycamore (Platanus occidentalis) ...|$|R

5000|$|Of the North American oaks, the {{northern}} red oak {{is the one}} of the most prized of the red oak group for lumber, much of which is marketed as red oak regardless of the species of origin. It is not good for outdoor use due to its open capillaries unless the wood is treated. If the wood is properly treated with preservatives, it will not rot as quickly as cured white oak heartwood. The closed cell structure of white oaks prevent them from absorbing preservatives. With northern red oak, one can blow air through an end grain piece 10 inches long to make bubbles come out in a glass of water. These openings give fungus easy access when the finish deteriorates. <b>Shumard</b> <b>oak,</b> a member of the red oak subgenus, provides timber which is described as [...] "mechanically superior" [...] to Northern Red oak.

Most nitrogen is found in the chlorophyll molecules of a leaf, and we are interested in understanding how nitrogen concentration varies oak species with different responses to flooding. The objectives of this study are to: (1) Determine the relationship between leaf chlorophyll and leaf nitrogen concentration for five different species of oak tree (bur oak, pin oak, swamp white oak, northern red oak and <b>shumard</b> <b>oak)</b> and (2) asses how flood tolerance affects the above relationship. The relationship between total leaf nitrogen concentration and chlorophyll of bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa), pin oak (Q. palustris), northern red oak (Q. rubra), <b>shumard</b> <b>oak</b> (Q. shumardii), and swamp white oak (Q. bicolor) were determined. Each tree species was represented by seedlings raised from acorns collected from both upland and lowland sites with the exception of northern red oak, which was represented by seedlings from a single location. A SPAD- 502 Meter (Minolta Corporation ltd., Osaka, Japan) was used to measure chlorophyll in a total of 135 individual seedlings for 5 consecutive weeks. A single leaf was repeatedly sampled on each seedling in each flooded and non-flooded (control) treatment over 5 replications in a greenhouse. The harvested leaves were then oven dried for 72 hours and nitrogen analysis was conducted in the lab by combusting the sample in an induction furnace and measuring the nitrogen via thermal conductivity.

40|$|Approximately {{two million}} {{hectares}} {{of land in}} the U. S. have been impacted by surface coal mining and subsequent reclamation. Soil replacement strategies follow standards set by state and federal regulations; however, permits allow for new techniques, such as the soil replacement method studied in this project, in order {{to improve the quality of}} the land. A new strategy, which involves dumping soil in overlapping piles with minimal equipment compaction, has been studied in the Appalachian coal region on a range of site conditions. However, this approach has not been evaluated in the Eastern Interior region, which includes Indiana. This study assessed the relationships of soil physiochemical and biological conditions on plant survival, growth, and root development by investigating growth responses of seedlings planted on standard graded (GR) plots and those planted on loosely dumped (LD) soil. The study, located on a reclaimed mine site in southern Indiana, used a split plot design. A total of 3200 seedlings of four hardwood species, northern red oak (Quercus rubra L.), white oak (Quercus bicolor W.), <b>Shumard</b> <b>oak</b> (Quercus shumardii B.), and American chestnut (Castanea dentate B.), were used. ^ Soil physical properties of the LD and GR soils showed significant treatment effects. Bulk density, moisture retention and porosity of the LD soil were favorable for plant growth. The GR soil had a significantly higher bulk density (1. 74 g/cm 3) compared to the LD soil (1. 54 g/cm 3) resulting in root impairment. The chemical properties of the LD and GR soils showed little variation and had low fertility status, organic carbon contents, and cation exchange capacities consistent with that of a subsurface soil. The presence and activity of soil microorganisms measured through microbial biomass (MB) and fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolysis were low and reflected the poor soil quality with slight treatment differences. ^ Seedling survival was significantly higher in the LD treatment compared to the GR treatment at the end of the second growing season. Above ground growth of the four hardwood species did not favor one soil replacement method over the other as few treatment effects were observed. A few exceptions to this generalization were observed which favored the LD treatment: average plant biomass significantly increased and plant water potential significantly decreased (less water stressed) in the LD treatment. The similarities in above ground growth among treatments is attributed, in part, to the short duration of the study (17 months) which may not be a sufficient amount of time for differences in above ground growth to manifest themselves. ^ In contrast, the below-ground growth parameters indicate that the method of soil replacement influenced root morphology and architecture due to the difference in soil properties. Increased lateral and tap root dry weights, root volume and projected root area (measured by WinRHIZO) were observed in seedlings grown on the LD treatment. It is likely that bulk density was the main root-restricting factor. ^ American chestnut seedlings ranked highest in root and shoot parameters, as well as plant water potential; yet this species ranked lowest in survival and had the greatest amount of dieback. In contrast, <b>Shumard</b> <b>oak</b> seedlings generally ranked second or third in root and shoot parameters; and yet had the highest survival rate and largest increase in lateral root dry weight compared to all other species. ^ Overall, this study showed that seedling survival and growth was favorable on the LD treatment. The below ground root responses measured with traditional or WinRHIZO analyses were clear indicators that the seedlings favored the LD treatment. In general, above-ground growth parameters were not sensitive indicators of growth over the 17 -month study period, whereas below-ground root parameters proved to be sensitive indicators of seedling growth. ...|$|E
