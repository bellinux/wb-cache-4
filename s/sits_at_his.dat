The show relocated from its original New York studio in late-1998 to NEP Studio 54 in New York City's Hell's Kitchen neighborhood, where it remained until 2005, when the studio was claimed by The Colbert Report. On July 11, 2005, the show premiered in its new studio, NEP Studio 52, at 733 11th Avenue, a few blocks west of its former location.|$|E
5|$|Laser {{remained}} in character as Heiter throughout the filming process, often shouting {{at the rest}} of the cast on set, but wherever possible staying away from the other actors and crew between scenes to preserve a level of separation. He only ate food he had brought onto the set himself, eating mostly fruit. He contributed dialogue for his character and selected many of his character's outfits from his personal wardrobe. Six claims that the jacket Heiter wore, which was bought by Laser, was a genuine jacket worn by real Nazi doctors. Laser was also happy for the other actors in The Human Centipede to add their own ideas to the film. For example, when Heiter is explaining his procedure to his victims, Katsuro's dialogue was improvised, which pleased Laser. During filming Laser accidentally kicked Kitamura (Katsuro), leading to a fight on set between the actors. The incident contributed to the tension and anger throughout the scene they were filming, in which Heiter <b>sits</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> dining table eating while the centipede eats dog food from the floor alongside him. Laser also hurt Williams during the scene when Heiter roughly grabs and injects Lindsay, which caused a pause in shooting before the filmmakers could continue.|$|E
25|$|Referred to as Thorwald's Cross, this stone {{cross is}} found in the church Andreas. Only {{attribution}} to the one who raised the stone—Þorvaldr—remains of the message inscribed on the cross. It has been badly damaged since it was recorded. The stone depicts a bearded human holding a spear downward at a wolf, his right foot in its mouth, while a large bird <b>sits</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> shoulder. Rundata dates it to 940, while Pluskowski dates it to the 11th century.|$|E

25|$|After breakfast, the Prince, {{accompanied}} by the playful Bendicò, goes into his office, which is lined with century-old paintings of the Salina family's estates. As he <b>sits</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> cluttered desk, the Prince recalls how much he dislikes both {{the room and the}} work it represents. This dislike intensifies during visits from his accountant and one of his tenants, both of whom are allied with the Redshirts. Both of them assure the Prince that the unification of Italy will be peaceful and will benefit everyone, including the nobility. The Prince allows himself to be reassured, certain that the class system will remain unchanged no matter what. The Prince's visit to the Salina chaplain, Father Pirrone, atop a tower where the men practice their joint hobby of astronomy, reinforces this belief.|$|E

500|$|... a {{partially}} surviving runestone erected at Kirk Andreas on the Isle of Man, depicts a bearded human holding a spear downward at a wolf, {{his right foot}} in its mouth, while a large bird <b>sits</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> shoulder. Rundata dates it to 940, while Pluskowski dates it to the 11th century. This depiction has been interpreted as Odin, with a raven or eagle at his shoulder, being consumed by Fenrir at Ragnarök. On the reverse of the stone is another image parallel to it that {{has been described as}} Christ triumphing over Satan. These combined elements have led to the cross as being described as [...] "syncretic art"; a mixture of pagan and Christian beliefs.|$|E

500|$|The Distrest Poet is an oil {{painting}} produced sometime around 1736 by the British artist William Hogarth. Reproduced as an etching and engraving, {{it was published}} in 1741 from a third state plate produced in 1740. The scene was probably inspired by Alexander Pope's satirical poem The Dunciad. [...] It depicts a scene in a small, dingy attic room where a poet <b>sits</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> desk in the dormer and, scratching his head, stares at the papers on the desk before him, evidently looking for inspiration to complete the poem he is writing. [...] Near him sits his wife darning clothes, surprised by the entrance of a milkmaid, who impatiently demands payment of debts.|$|E
500|$|Cameron Duddy and Mars {{directed}} the ballad's accompanying music video. It portrays Mars as a [...] "lonely balladeer" [...] who <b>sits</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> piano donned {{in a pair}} of sunglasses while setting a half-full glass of whiskey atop it. Critics resoundingly complimented the simplicity of the video's production. The song has been covered by artists, including Mike Ward, who released a studio version of the song after he performed it on The Voice UK. Ward's cover peaked at number 60 in the UK Singles Chart. [...] "When I Was Your Man" [...] was also added to the soundtrack of the Brazilian soap opera Amor à Vida. Mars performed the song on the Moonshine Jungle Tour (2013–14) and at the 24K Magic World Tour (2017–18).|$|E
500|$|Masereel uses an emotional, Expressionistic {{style to}} create a {{narrative}} replete with allegory, satire, and social criticism—a visual style he continued with throughout his career. [...] He expresses a broad variety of emotions through understated, unexaggerated gestures. [...] Most characters are given simple, passive expressions, which provides emphatic contrast with characters expressing more explicit emotion—love, despair, ecstasy. [...] He considered Passionate Journey partly autobiographical, which he emphasized {{with a pair of}} self-portraits that open the book—in the first, Masereel <b>sits</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> desk with his woodcutting tools, and in the second appears the protagonist, dressed in identical fashion with the first. [...] Literature scholar MartinS. Cohen wrote that it expressed themes that were to become universal in the wordless novel genre.|$|E

On {{the other side of}} the stone is a depiction of a large cross and another image parallel to the Odin figure that has been described as Christ triumphing over Satan. These combined elements have led to the cross as being described as [...] "syncretic art", a mixture of pagan and Christian beliefs.|$|E
500|$|Within {{the novel}} itself, {{the title is}} alluded to when Gail Hightower <b>sits</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> study window waiting for his {{recurring}} vision of his grandfather's last raid. The vision always occurs in [...] "that instant when all light has failed {{out of the sky}} and it would be night save for that faint light which daygranaried leaf and grass blade reluctant suspire, making still a little light on earth though night itself has come." [...] The story that would eventually become the novel, started by Faulkner in 1931, was originally titled [...] "Dark House" [...] and began with Hightower sitting at a dark window in his home. However, after a casual remark by his wife Estelle {{on the quality of the}} light in August, Faulkner changed the title.|$|E
