50|$|<b>Shrinkage</b> <b>stoping,</b> is most {{suitable}} for steeply dipping ore bodies (70°—90°). In <b>shrinkage</b> <b>stoping,</b> mining proceeds from the bottom upwards, in horizontal slices (similar to cut and fill mining), with the broken ore being left in place for miners to work from. Because blasted rock takes up a greater volume than in situ rock (due to swell factor), some of the blasted ore (approximately 40%) must be removed to provide working space for the next ore slice. Once {{the top of the}} stope is reached all the ore is removed from the stope. The stope may be backfilled or left empty, depending on the rock conditions.|$|E
50|$|Underhand stoping, {{also known}} as horizontal-cut underhand or underbreaking stoping, is the working of an ore deposit from the top downwards. Like <b>shrinkage</b> <b>stoping,</b> underhand stoping is most {{suitable}} for steeply dipping ore bodies. Because of the mechanical advantage it offers hand tools being struck downward (rather than upward, against gravity), this method was dominant prior to the invention of rock blasting and powered tools.|$|E
40|$|Focusing on a quantum-limit behavior, {{we study}} a single vortex {{in a clean}} s-wave type-II {{superconductor}} by self-consistently solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation. The discrete energy levels of the vortex bound states in the quantum limit is discussed. The vortex core radius shrinks monotonically up to an atomic-scale length on lowering the temperature T, and the <b>shrinkage</b> <b>stops</b> to saturate at a lower T. The pair potential, supercurrent, and local density of states around the vortex exhibit Friedel-like oscillations. The local density of states has particle-hole asymmetry induced by the vortex. These are potentially observed directly by STM. Comment: 4 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
40|$|Cross-sections of resin strands. Techniques were {{developed}} to make in situ measurements of gelled resin to determine linear shrinkage, stress-strain response and stress relaxation of single strands of SL 5170 epoxy and SL 5149 photocurable resins. Epoxy strands shrank approximately 1. 4 % and the acrylate strands about 1. 0 % after a single exposure. No forces were measured during cure shrinkage of strands following the first laser exposure. In multiple laser exposures, the acrylate continues to shrink; whereas (University of Dayton data) no additional shrinkage is observed in epoxy strands on a second hit. In force relaxation tests, a strand is drawn and then a 0. 5 % step strain is applied after different elapsed times. The epoxy initial modulus evolves (increases) with elapsed time following draw of the strand, and this evolution in modulus occurs after linear <b>shrinkage</b> has <b>stopped.</b> On the other hand, acrylates show no evolution of modulus with elapsed time following a single laser draw; i. e., once <b>shrinkage</b> <b>stops</b> after one laser hit, the initial modulus remains stable with elapsed time. Finally, relaxation response times of epoxy strands get larger with increasing elapsed time after laser draw. In acrylate strands there was no evolution in initial modulus with elapsed time after a single draw so relaxation times are not a function of elapsed time after a single hit with the laser...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{soil water}} {{characteristic}} curve (SWCC) {{has been tested}} during the drying process. In order to define the relationship between suction, degree of saturation and void ratio, fitting models of SWCC was established. Studies {{have shown that the}} shape of SWCC of three kinds of samples (taken from Jiaohe, Gaochang and Jiuzhoutai) was similar to the inverted “S”, the relationship between water content and matric suction was inversely proportional. Under the condition of the same moisture, the matric suction of the Jiaohe and Gaochang samples were greater than the Jiuzhoutai samples, and the changes of pore water pressures showed the same trend. The degree of saturation began to decrease when the water content reduced to the air entry value. When the degree of saturation was greater than 90 %, the volume of soil samples contracted significantly, and when saturation is below 80 %, volume <b>shrinkage</b> <b>stopped...</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Shrinkage</b> <b>stoping</b> is a short-hole {{mining method}} which is {{suitable}} for steeply dipping orebodies. The method is similar to cut and fill mining with the exception that after being blasted, broken ore is left in the stope where {{it is used to}} support the surrounding rock and as a platform from which to work. Only enough ore is removed from the stope to allow for drilling and blasting the next slice. The stope is emptied when all of the ore has been blasted. Although it is very selective and allows for low dilution, since most of the ore stays in the stope until mining is completed there is a delayed return on capital investments.|$|E
40|$|We {{focus our}} {{attention}} on Monte Carlo simulations of crystallization, {{which is one of}} the most important processes occurring in nature and technology of materials. Special attention is paid to the crystallization shrinkage and its consequences onto the growth of the new crystalline phase. We show that crystallization <b>shrinkage</b> <b>stops</b> after reaching the percolation threshold and that this is not the final stage of the crystallization process. Based on experimental evidences on sintering of diopside-albite systems and computer simulations we argue that crystallization continues inside the grains where the remaining liquid melt is a subject of accumulation of stress and because the stress relaxation by change in the volume is forbidden due to the already formed rigid core, the so called crystallization induced porosity appears. We show that even a relatively simple short range potential as the Lennard-Jones one, reveals such a complicated phenomenon as the crystallization induced porosity, which has a great importance onto the mechanical properties of the newly crystallized material.

40|$|AbstractA {{differential}} scanning calorimeter {{was used}} to determine the Tg of papaya pieces equilibrated with several water activities. Thermograms revealed the existence of two Tg. The first, which presented lower value, is due to the matrix formed by sugar and water. The second one, less visible and less plasticized by water, probably corresponds to macromolecules. The data of Tg were satisfactory correlated by the Gordon–Taylor model. A convective tray dryer was used for the drying experiments, which were carried out at air temperatures of 40 °C and 70 °C and air velocity of 1. 0 m/s. The shrinkage behavior was accomplished by total area and apparent volume alterations along drying. Samples were photographed during process, and their length and lateral areas were measured using the ImageJ® software. As result, the effect of air temperature on shrinkage was significant and the highest temperature (70 °C) induced higher extent of shrinkage values. At this condition, papaya sample was in a rubbery state, characterized by great matrix mobility, and remained so until the end of process, since product temperature (Tp) was above the Tg along the process. At lower temperature (40 °C), <b>shrinkage</b> <b>stopped</b> at a critical value of moisture content (0. 21 g/g, wet basis), which coincided with the point in which the Tg was close to Tp...|$|R
40|$|Resorcinol-formaldehyde hydrogels {{prepared}} {{at various}} resorcinol/sodium carbonate ratios, R/C, were convectively air dried. The {{influence of the}} drying operating conditions, i. e. air temperature and velocity, on the pore texture, shrinkage and cracking of the dried gels were investigated. Shrinkage {{was found to be}} isotropic. The shrinkage behaviour and the textural properties of the gels are independent of the drying operating conditions, but are completely determined by the value of the synthesis variables. The analysis of the drying kinetics shows two main drying periods. During the first phase, shrinkage occurs and the external surface of the material remains completely wet: heat and mass transfers are limited by external resistances located in a boundary layer. When <b>shrinkage</b> <b>stops,</b> the second period begins: the evaporation front recedes inside the solid and internal transfer limitations prevail. The drying time can be reduced by increasing the air temperature and/or velocity, but the temperature increase is limited when monolithicity is required, especially when the pores are small. For example, at a temperature of 160 degrees C and a velocity of 2 m/s, about 1 h is needed to dry a 2. 8 cm in diameter and 1 cm in height cylinder containing macropores (pore width > 50 nm after drying). The same cylinder presenting small mesopores (pore width = 10 - 15 nm after drying) requires 20 h at 30 degrees C and 2 m/s to reach complete dryness without the development of cracks.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the effect of intermittent wet and dry curing methods on the strength, modulus of elasticity, porosity, absorptivity, and shrinkage of the concrete. The study was carried out in field conditions that are characterized by hot air temperature, low relative humidity, large diurnal variations, direct solar radiation, and relatively high wind speed. It was found that intermittent wet curing methods are suitable in the aforesaid severe conditions with regard the strength and the durability of the concrete. However, as far as the rate of <b>shrinkage</b> after <b>stopping</b> the curing process is concerned, neither the intermittent wet curing nor the dry methods are an acceptable technique of curing. Therefore, other methods to reduce the rate of shrinkage were advised. Further, and {{based on the results of}} this study, some recommendations about using the design guidelines that were formulated on the basis of experimental results carried out in relatively cold and humid climate conditions were discussed. © 1994...|$|R
40|$|Electronic {{structure}} of a single vortex (or vortex core structure) in type-II superconductors is theoretically discussed in the present thesis. Low-lying excited states in the superconductors due to the vortex, i. e., "vortex bound states," are examined in detail {{on the basis of}} numerical calculations. Two points are focused on: the effect of superconducting gap anisotropy on a vortex (Chapter 2) and the property of a vortex in quantum-limit situation (Chapter 3). The anisotropy of a superconducting energy gap has substantial effects on the {{structure of}} the vortex bound states. The local density of states around a vortex is calculated in a clean superconductor with the gap anisotropy {{within the framework of the}} quasiclassical theory of superconductivity. A characteristic structure of the local density of states, observed experimentally in the layered hexagonal superconductor 2 H-NbSe(2) by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), is well reproduced by assuming an anisotropic s-wave gap. The local density of states (or the bound states) around a vortex in superconductors with gap anisotropy is interpreted in terms of quasiparticle trajectories to facilitate an understanding of the rich electronic structure observed in STM experiments. This reveals not only a rich internal electronic structure associated with a vortex core, but also unique ability of the STM spectroscopy. The quantum limit means that the superconducting coherence length is small in the limit, i. e., it is comparable to the atomic length order. Focusing on quantum-limit behavior, fundamental {{structure of a}} vortex is studied by self-consistently solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation. The discreteness of the energy levels of the vortex bound states is crucial for the vortex structure in the quantum limit. The following are revealed by the study of the quantum limit. The vortex core radius shrinks monotonically up to an atomic-scale length on lowering the temperature T, and the <b>shrinkage</b> <b>stops</b> to saturate at a lower T. The pair potential, supercurrent, and local density of states around the vortex exhibit Friedel-like oscillations. The local density of states inside a vortex core generally has particle-hole asymmetry induced by the existence of the vortex itself. Some essential properties of general vortices which are concealed within the conventional non-quantum-limit analysis can be extracted by the quantum-limit analysis. On the basis of the inherent particle-hole asymmetry inside vortex cores, it is discussed in this thesis that electric charging of a vortex core is originated from the Friedel oscillation of the Bogoliubov wave functions around the vortex (Chapter 4). This mechanism of the vortex core charging is independent of the slope in the normal-state density of states at the Fermi level. The temperature dependence of the vortex core charge is also presented. It is expected that by using STM, information on the vortex core charging is extracted through a relation between the vortex core charge and the vortex bound states...|$|R
40|$|That {{enterprise}} server utilization is low {{should come}} as no surprise. Enterprises upgraded their environments to address Y 2 K issues, and added more capacity in anticipation of endless growth. Supporting alternative approaches was seen as a way to hedge bets in a time of rapidly evolving enterprise technology. This added more equipment. Then the economy plummeted. Of course, these seemingly prudent excesses became an obvious source of waste in an era of constraint and outright <b>shrinkage.</b> Enterprises <b>stopped</b> buying, but unless they abandoned an application or closed a web site, they usually did not dispose of any of their IT assets early. Instead, most enterprises have turned their attention to getting more use out of existing hardware and software assets – to the point of sharing what was traditionally owned. So how do you convert the mansions of yesteryear into the efficiency of multi-tenancy? You architect a robust system of halls and doors, redesign rooms for multi-use and – oh yes – add more sound insulation. You do the same in IT environments. In the past few years, networks (halls) have become more pervasive, and switches (doors) have grown more intelligent (soundproof and secure). IT devices have become more reliable and self-healing. Partitioning and virtual machines have made server assets divisible. Encryption, precipitated security schemes, policy-based automation, and a myriad of poin...|$|R
40|$|The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a {{well known}} and {{challenging}} combinatorial optimisation problem. Its computational intractability has attracted a number of heuristic approaches to generate satisfactory, if not optimal, candidate solutions. In this paper we demonstrate a simple unconventional computation method to approximate the Euclidean TSP using a virtual material approach. The morphological adaptation behaviour of the material emerges from the low-level interactions of a population of particles moving within a diffusive lattice. A `blob' of this material is placed over a set of data points projected into the lattice, representing TSP city locations, and the blob is reduced in size over time. As the blob shrinks it morphologically adapts to {{the configuration of the}} cities. The <b>shrinkage</b> process automatically <b>stops</b> when the blob no longer completely covers all cities. By manually tracing the perimeter of the blob a path between cities is elicited corresponding to a TSP tour. Over 6 runs on 20 randomly generated datasets of 20 cities this simple and unguided method found tours with a mean best tour length of 1. 04, mean average tour length of 1. 07 and mean worst tour length of 1. 09 when expressed as a fraction of the minimal tour computed by an exact TSP solver. We examine the insertion mechanism by which the blob constructs a tour, note some properties and limitations of its performance, and discuss the relationship between the blob TSP and proximity graphs which group points on the plane. The method is notable for its simplicity and the spatially represented mechanical mode of its operation. We discuss similarities between this method and previously suggested models of human performance on the TSP and suggest possibilities for further improvement.

40|$|The FY 1994 DST/SST blend was {{prepared}} {{in accordance with}} the DST/SST blend feed specification. The laboratory preparation steps and observations were compared with an existing experience base to verify the acceptability of the feed specification for simulant make-up. The most significant test results included a variety of features. Ferrocyanide breaks down to NH{sub 3 } plus formate, during the low-temperature calcining phase of the tests. Ferrocyanide displayed no redox reactivity with the nitrates and nitrites contained in the slurry in the absence of sugar. Sugar displays a redox reaction with the nitrates and nitrites in the blend similar to the redox. reaction observed in the LLW feed simulant. Boiling of a free flowing slurry occurs at temperatures below about 120 {degrees}C. When about 45 % of the total water loss has occurred, the feed slurry congeals and continues to lose water, shrinking and developing <b>shrinkage</b> cracks. Water <b>stops</b> coming off between 350 {degrees}C and 400 {degrees}C. Slurry shear strength and viscosity strongly increase as the weight percent solids increases from 20 wt% to 45 wt%. The 45 wt% solids corresponds to approximately a 40 % water loss. The principle beat sensitivity for this material is the exothermic reaction which is activated when the temperature exceeds about 250 {degrees}C. The breakdown of ferrocyanide to ammonia and formate under strongly basic conditions may begin at temperatures less than 100 {degrees}C, but the rate increased strongly with increasing temperature and appeared to be completed in the time of our tests. Differential thermal analysis (DTA) results on feed slurry without and with ferrocyanide showed only endothermic behavior. This is consistent with the dry out and low temperature calcine studies which did not indicate any exothermic behavior for the feed slurry with and without ferrocyanide...|$|R
40|$|Multiphase {{transport}} in unsaturated swelling {{porous materials}} involves fluid mass transport, heat transfer {{as well as}} swelling of the porous solid matrix. Neglecting the deformation of the solid matrix can lead to erroneous results when modeling transport phenomena in porous materials. In particular, many porous materials exhibit viscoelastic effect upon wetting/drying, which can expedite or slow the transport process. This work presents modeling and simulation of two-way coupling of multiphase transport and viscoelastic large deformation of unsaturated swelling porous systems based on fundamental physics. The work includes {{the development of a}} thermomechanical theory for multiphase transport in unsaturated swelling porous media based on the Hybrid Mixture Theory (saturated systems can also be modeled as a special case of this general theory). The theory includes three phases: solid matrix, fluid and air and uses the Coleman-Noll procedure to obtain restrictions on the form of the constitutive equations. Derived relationships include, for example, a modified Darcy's law, which takes into account both Fickian and non-Fickian transport, and a viscoelastic constitutive relationship that relates the stress and strain tensors for the solid phase. A model is then developed based on this theory for isothermal conditions which involves a simple form of a differential-integral equation that governs the fluid transport and is fully coupled with the solid large deformation. Numerical implementation of this model is then presented that involves a finite element analysis of water absorption of plane sheet pasta and numerical results of sorption curves show good agreement with experimental results obtained from the literature. Importance of including viscoelastic relaxation is investigated for soaking processes of pasta. Drying of potato is also considered in this work as an important example of two-way coupling of multiphase transport and viscoelastic large deformation of the solid matrix of porous materials because during drying processes, the transition of outer surface of the material from rubbery to glassy state at low moisture content can slow or <b>stop</b> <b>shrinkage</b> of the materials, and thus viscoelasticity plays an important role...|$|R
