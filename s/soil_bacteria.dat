5|$|Coprinopsis variegata can attack <b>soil</b> <b>bacteria,</b> such as {{species of}} Pseudomonas and Agrobacterium, {{and use them}} as {{nutrient}} sources. The fungus achieves this by growing specialized hyphae {{in the direction of}} the bacteria, sensing them with some chemoattractive mechanism not yet fully understood. The fungus then secretes compounds to digest the bacteria while growing assimilative hyphae to absorb the nutrients. The process is relatively rapid, and bacterial colonies can be assimilated in less than 24 hours.|$|E
5|$|The ectomycorrhizae formed {{between the}} fungus and host plant can be {{influenced}} by soil microorganisms present in the mycorrhizosphere. For example, <b>soil</b> <b>bacteria</b> from the genera Paenibacillus and Burkholderia alter the branching structure of the root, whereas Bacillus species increase root growth and mycorrhizal colonization. The fungus {{does not require a}} specific soil but seems to prefer acidic and nutrient-deficient soil. Suillus luteus produces hydroxamic acid-based siderophores, which are compounds that can chelate iron and extract it from the soil in nutrient-poor conditions. Ignacio Chapela and colleagues analysed the carbon uptake of S.luteus in Ecuador, concluding pine plantations accompanied by S.luteus deplete carbon stored in the soil and raising concerns that these might not be a remedy for rising carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|The phrase {{acid rain}} {{was first used}} by Scottish chemist Robert Augus Smith in 1852. The pH of rain varies, {{especially}} due to its origin. On America's East Coast, rain that {{is derived from the}} Atlantic Ocean typically has a pH of 5.0-5.6; rain that comes across the continental from the west has a pH of 3.8-4.8; and local thunderstorms can have a pH as low as 2.0. Rain becomes acidic primarily due to the presence of two strong acids, sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and nitric acid (HNO3). Sulfuric acid is derived from natural sources such as volcanoes, and wetlands (sulfate reducing bacteria); and anthropogenic sources such as the combustion of fossil fuels, and mining where H2S is present. Nitric acid is produced by natural sources such as lightning, <b>soil</b> <b>bacteria,</b> and natural fires; while also produced anthropogenically by the combustion of fossil fuels and from power plants. In the past 20 years the concentrations of nitric and sulfuric acid has decreased in presence of rainwater, which {{may be due to the}} significant increase in ammonium (most likely as ammonia from livestock production), which acts as a buffer in acid rain and raises the pH.|$|E

25|$|Mycorrhizal {{plants are}} often more {{resistant}} to diseases, such as those caused by microbial soil-borne pathogens. AMF was also significantly correlated with soil biological fertility variables such as soil fungi and <b>soil</b> <b>bacteria,</b> including soil disease.

25|$|Tetanus {{was known}} to ancient people, who {{recognized}} the relationship between wounds and fatal muscle spasms. In 1884, Arthur Nicolaier isolated the strychnine-like toxin of tetanus from free-living, anaerobic <b>soil</b> <b>bacteria.</b> The etiology of the disease was further elucidated in 1890 by Antonio Carle and Giorgio Rattone, who demonstrated the transmissibility of tetanus for the first time. They produced tetanus in rabbits by injecting their sciatic nerve with pus from a fatal human tetanus case in that same year.|$|E
25|$|Specific organismal {{chemical}} signatures {{can be used}} {{to detect}} biomass of more cryptic organisms, such as AM fungi or <b>soil</b> <b>bacteria.</b> Lipids, more specifically phospholipids and neutral lipids, contain fatty acids connected to a glycerol backbone. The fatty acid composition of organisms varies, and the proportions of specific fatty acids can be organism specific. For example, in AM fungi the proportion of the fatty acids, 16:1ω5 and 18:1ω7, in the phospholipid portion account for approximately 58% of total fatty acid composition. The fatty acid, 16:1ω5 is the most commonly used acid to characterize AM fungi in soils and {{can be used as a}} strong indicator of mycelial biomass in soil sample.|$|E

25|$|A {{classic example}} of {{mutualism}} is the interaction between rhizobia <b>soil</b> <b>bacteria</b> and legumes (Fabaceae). In this interaction, rhizobia bacteria induce root nodule formation in legume plants via an exchange of molecular signals. Within the root nodules, rhizobia fix atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia using the nitrogenase enzyme. The legume benefits from a new supply of usable nitrogen from the rhizobia, and the rhizobia benefits from organic acid energy sources from the plant {{as well as the}} protection provided by the root nodule. Since the rhizobia live within the legume, {{this is an example of}} endosymbiosis, and since both the bacteria and the plant can survive independently, it is also an example of facultative symbiosis.|$|E
25|$|Some <b>soil</b> <b>bacteria</b> {{have been}} shown to have {{beneficial}} effects upon the establishment of ectomycorrhizal symbioses. Some of these bacteria, known as Mycorrhiza Helper Bacteria (MHBs), {{have been shown}} to stimulate EcM formation, root and shoot biomass. The presence of higher levels of ergosterol in the soil indicate that MHBs may be promoting fungal growth, as well, thereby generating an increase in mycelial tissue and hyphae capable of exploring greater soil volumes. The mechanisms by which these bacteria stimulate mycorrhizal formation are unclear. However, some mechanistic hypotheses include the softening of cell walls to make root cells more receptive, stimulation of short root formation in plants to allow for a higher probability of encounters with fungal propagules, and mediation of chemical elicitors involved in mutual recognition. However, regardless of mechanism, it is becoming evident that bacteria are more ubiquitous than previously thought and could represent a third component of mycorrhizas (3.4.l).|$|E
25|$|Since traits {{come from}} the genes in a cell, putting {{a new piece of}} DNA into a cell can produce a new trait. This is how genetic {{engineering}} works. For example, rice can be given genes from a maize and a <b>soil</b> <b>bacteria</b> so the rice produces beta-carotene, which the body converts to Vitamin A. This can help children suffering from Vitamin A deficiency. Another gene being put into some crops comes from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis; the gene makes a protein that is an insecticide. The insecticide kills insects that eat the plants, but is harmless to people. In these plants, the new genes are put into the plant before it is grown, so the genes are in every part of the plant, including its seeds. The plant's offspring inherit the new genes, which has led to concern about the spread of new traits into wild plants.|$|E

2500|$|Many <b>soil</b> <b>bacteria</b> {{possess the}} enzyme urease, which catalyzes {{conversion}} of urea to ammonia (NH3) or ammonium ion (NH4+) and bicarbonate ion (HCO3−). Thus urea fertilizers rapidly transform to the ammonium form in soils. Among the <b>soil</b> <b>bacteria</b> known to carry urease, some ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), such as species of Nitrosomonas, can also assimilate {{the carbon dioxide}} the reaction releases to make biomass via the Calvin cycle, and harvest energy by oxidizing ammonia (the other product of urease) to nitrite, a process termed [...] nitrification.C- and 15N-labeled urea added to soil|journal= Biology and Fertility of Soils|volume= 42|issue= 2|pages= 137|year= 2005|last1= Marsh|first1= K.

[...] Ammonium and nitrate are readily absorbed by plants, and are the dominant sources of nitrogen for plant growth. [...] Urea is also used in many multi-component solid fertilizer formulations. [...] Urea is highly soluble in water and is therefore also very suitable for use in fertilizer solutions (in combination with ammonium nitrate: UAN), e.g., in 'foliar feed' fertilizers. For fertilizer use, granules are preferred over prills because of their narrower particle size distribution, which is an advantage for mechanical application.|$|E
2500|$|Composting toilets use {{bacteria}} to decompose human feces into useful, odourless, sanitary compost. The process is sanitary because <b>soil</b> <b>bacteria</b> eat the human pathogens {{as well as}} most of the mass of the waste. [...] Nevertheless, most health authorities forbid direct use of [...] "humanure" [...] for growing food. The risk is microbial and viral contamination. [...] In a dry composting toilet, the waste is evaporated or digested to gas (mostly carbon dioxide) and vented, so a toilet produces only a few pounds of compost every six months. [...] To control the odor, modern toilets use a small fan to keep the toilet under negative pressure, and exhaust the gasses to a vent pipe.|$|E
2500|$|Due to the {{increase}} in temperature of the soil, CO2 levels in our atmosphere increase, the mean average temperature of the Earth is rising. This is due to man's activities such as forest clearing, soil denuding, developments that destroy autotrophic processes. With the loss of photosynthetic plants covering and cooling the surface of the soil, the infrared energy penetrates the soil heating it up and causing a rise in heterotrophic bacteria. Heterotrophs in the soil quickly degrade the organic matter and soil structure crumbles thus it dissolves into streams, rivers into the sea. Much of the organic matter swept away in floods caused by forest clearing goes into estuaries, wetlands and eventually into the open ocean. Increased turbidity of surface waters causes biological oxygen demand and more autotrophic organisms die in the wake of man's destruction. Carbon dioxide levels rise with increased respiration of <b>soil</b> <b>bacteria</b> after temperatures rise due to loss of soil cover.|$|E

2500|$|Soil animals graze on {{populations of}} {{bacteria}} and fungi {{as well as}} ingest and break up litter to increase soil respiration. Microfauna {{are made up of}} the smallest soil animals. These include nematodes and mites. This group specializes on <b>soil</b> <b>bacteria</b> and fungi. By ingesting these organisms, carbon that was initially in plant organic compounds and [...] was incorporated into bacterial and fungal structures will now be respired by the soil animal. Mesofauna are soil animals from [...] in length and will ingest soil litter. The fecal material will hold a greater amount of moisture and have a greater surface area. This will allow for new attack by microorganisms and a greater amount of soil respiration. Macrofauna are organisms from , such as earthworms and termites. Most macrofauna fragment litter, thereby exposing a greater amount of area to microbial attack. Other macrofauna burrow or ingest litter, reducing soil bulk density, breaking up soil aggregates and increasing soil aeration and the infiltration of water.|$|E
2500|$|In 1970 Paul Crutzen {{pointed out}} that {{emissions}} of nitrous oxide (...) , a stable, long-lived gas produced by <b>soil</b> <b>bacteria,</b> from the Earth's surface could affect the amount of nitric oxide (NO) in the stratosphere. Crutzen showed that nitrous oxide lives long enough to reach the stratosphere, where it is converted into NO. Crutzen then noted that increasing use of fertilizers might have led {{to an increase in}} nitrous oxide emissions over the natural background, which would in turn result in an increase in the amount of NO in the stratosphere. Thus human activity could affect the stratospheric ozone layer. In the following year, Crutzen and (independently) Harold Johnston suggested that NO emissions from supersonic passenger aircraft, which would fly in the lower stratosphere, could also deplete the ozone layer. However, more recent analysis in 1995 by David W. Fahey, an atmospheric scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, found that the drop in ozone would be from 1–2 percent if a fleet of 500 supersonic passenger aircraft were operated. This, Fahey expressed, would not be a showstopper for advanced supersonic passenger aircraft development.|$|E
