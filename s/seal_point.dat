50|$|Chocolate Point: Chocolate brown {{color on}} the points (face mask, ears, tail, and legs), {{as opposed to the}} darker seal brown. Body color is whiter and {{brighter}} than on a seal-point cat. One distinction between the chocolate point and <b>seal</b> <b>point</b> is the color of their paw pads.

40|$|A {{dual stage}} seat valve head {{arrangement}} is described {{which consists of}} a primary <b>sealing</b> <b>point</b> located between a fixed orifice seat and a valve poppet, and a secondary <b>sealing</b> <b>point</b> between an orifice poppet and a valve poppet. Upstream of the valve orifice is a flexible, convoluted metal diaphragm attached to the orifice poppet. Downstream of the valve orifice, a finger spring exerts a force against the valve poppet, tending to keep the valve in a closed position. The series arrangement of a double seat and poppet is able to tolerate small particle contamination while minimizing chatter by controlling throttling or metering across the secondary seat, thus preserving the primary sealing surface...|$|R

50|$|Throughout the Otways region some 276 Aboriginal {{archaeological sites}} had been {{identified}} by 1998, 73 in the Aire River valley alone.

Archaeological examinations of Aire River middens have uncovered both intertidal mollusc and freshwater mussel remains, together with parrot-fish residues and snails. At <b>Seal</b> <b>Point,</b> archaeologists have disinterred what looks like a warm weather camp, from spring to early summer, with pit huts, whose remains attest to a diet based on two species of marine animals-the elephant and brown fur seals- possums, wrasse, and bracken ferns, and to an industrial production of flake stone tools.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{work on a}} new glass-ceramic/alloy for {{pyrotechnic}} components is discussed. A {{newly developed}} family of austenitic stainless steels has been hermetically sealed to a widely used lithia-alumina-silica (LAS) glass-ceramic. These alloys, originally developed for high oxidation resistance, contain 4 - 5 wt% Al. The presence of Al offers several advantages from a glass or glass/ceramic <b>sealing</b> <b>point</b> of view: presence of a tenacious, stable oxide (Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 }) on the alloys` surface {{as well as the}} fact that they can be strengthened during sealing via precipitation of a secondary phase, NiAl. In addition these new alloys offer lower material and machining costs and improved weldability compared to the widely used Ni-base superalloys...|$|R
