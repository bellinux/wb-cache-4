5|$|After the High Councillor's {{downfall}} and the regime's {{defeat in}} Metropolis, the Regime is dismantled {{and all of}} its accomplices are arrested. Harley Quinn has the Joker sent back to the prime universe after realizing that he does not care about her, Green Lantern hands over his counterpart and Sinestro to the Guardians of the Universe to stand trial, and Wonder Woman dethrones her counterpart. The dictator Superman is placed in a prison emitting red sun radiation that renders him powerless, and his prime counterpart admits that if he were placed in the same position, he might have done the same thing. The alternate Batman tells Superman that he hopes that Superman never has to learn what he could be capable of if he turns evil, and warns him that if something ever happens to him, causing him to go down the path of his counterpart, he will come after him. As they walk away, the alternate Superman's eyes glow red, indicating he <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>some</b> degree of his powers.|$|E
5|$|The {{aftermath}} of the blast makes Rei realize that he was human all along, and that {{everyone else in the}} town were Phiroids. After collecting some supplies, the three of them leave the town and make it to the facility where Rei originally woke up, which <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>some</b> electricity. Tipi gives Rei access to an electronic library on a tablet shortly before her battery is no longer able to function. Rei and Shiona stay in the facility for a time until Shiona eventually succumbs to the gunshot wound which had damaged her internal components. Rei puts Shiona and Tipi in cryogenic pods before leaving with the music box in an attempt to find a world where humans and Phiroids can coexist. Sometime later, Shiona wakes up in a facility with her memories wiped, but she is told that there was a music box with her when she was found. The environment has recovered and human civilization is once again prosperous and highly technological. Shiona is taken back to the town where humans and Phiroids once again coexist. She is reunited with Tipi, who also had her memories wiped. Prompted by the tune playing from the music box, Shiona sings the song which is now known worldwide.|$|E

25|$|Fiction about gynoids {{or female}} cyborgs {{reinforce}} essentialist ideas of femininity, according to Margret Grebowicz. Such essentialist ideas may present as sexual or gender stereotypes. Among the few non-eroticized fictional gynoids include Rosie the Robot Maid from The Jetsons. However, she <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>some</b> stereotypically feminine qualities, {{such as a}} matronly shape and a predisposition to cry.|$|E

The issue of background independence in LQG <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>some</b> unresolved subtleties. For example, some derivations require a fixed choice of the topology, while any consistent quantum theory of gravity should include topology change as a dynamical process.|$|E
25|$|The 787's cabin {{windows are}} larger than any other civil air {{transport}} in-service or in development, with dimensions of , and a higher eye level so passengers can maintain {{a view of the}} horizon. The composite fuselage permits larger windows without the need for structural reinforcement. Instead of plastic window shades, the windows use electrochromism-based smart glass (supplied by PPG Industries) allowing flight attendants and passengers to adjust five levels of sunlight and visibility to their liking, reducing cabin glare while maintaining a view to the outside world, but the most opaque setting <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>some</b> transparency.

25|$|Even {{in times}} of solar minimum, when F2 is rarely available, 10 meters <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>some</b> long {{distance}} possibilities. Sporadic E propagation can bring in signals from a hundred to many thousands of miles away. Sporadic E on 10 meters is mainly a seasonal event, with late {{spring and early summer}} being prime time for the mode. A shorter, less-intense period occurs during mid-winter, often between Christmas and the new year. Other, off-peak openings may be seen almost anytime. Even during solar minimum, F2 openings often occur on transequatorial paths, for example between Europe and Southern Africa or between Pacific North America and the Eastern Pacific islands.|$|E

25|$|In {{the paradox}} of Achilles and the {{tortoise}}, Achilles is in a footrace with the tortoise. Achilles allows the tortoise a head start of 100 meters, for example. If we suppose that each racer starts running at some constant speed (one very fast and one very slow), then after some finite time, Achilles will have run 100 meters, bringing him to the tortoise's starting point. During this time, the tortoise has run a much shorter distance, say, 10 meters. It will then take Achilles some further time to run that distance, by which time the tortoise will have advanced farther; and then more time still to reach this third point, while the tortoise moves ahead. Thus, whenever Achilles arrives somewhere the tortoise has been, he <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>some</b> distance to go before he can even reach the tortoise.|$|E
25|$|The first mode is god mode, {{which allows}} players to design or terraform a {{selected}} {{tract of land}} where the city will be built. God mode also allows players to trigger disasters, including tornadoes and earthquakes among several others. Players can select an area where a disaster will occur and even control the direction of certain disasters. Most terraforming tools are disabled after the city is named and founded. The player <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>some</b> terraforming tools made available in mayor mode, although they become very limited and expensive, and they can still trigger disasters at will. In addition to these abilities, god mode also gives the player tools to reconcile {{the borders of the}} cities, so as to fix any discrepancies created during the terraforming process, and a day/night cycle adjustment, so that one can make it always day, always night, or alternate between day or night in accordance with the in-universe game clock. Both the ability to reconcile the city edges and the ability to modify the day/night cycle are available even once the city has been established.|$|E
25|$|Emma, Hook {{and their}} guest return to see Rumplestiltskin {{in the hopes}} that he can open the time portal, but instead he tells them that only they can re-open it because only the people who came through the portal can re-open it, but they need to wield magic. Rumple gives Emma a wand and tells her to open the portal if she has magic, but she doesn't think she can. Rumple decides he’d rather forget {{everything}} he’s learned so as not to alter his future, then he sends Emma and Hook to a dark vault where he keeps dangerous and unpredictable magic, where their Storybrooke outfits are restored. Hook says that Emma <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>some</b> magic in her and after seeing what happened to her parents and realizing everything Henry did to bring her to Storybrooke, she's ready to return home. Hook and Emma then notice the wand lights up with magic and open up the portal, allowing Hook and the woman to escape first. Before she can leave, Rumple holds on to Emma and demands to know what happened to Baelfire/Neal. Emma tells him what happened, then she begs him not to take away the fact he died a hero. Rumplestiltskin drinks the forgetting potion and lets go of Emma where she is pulled into the portal, which sends her, Hook, and the woman back to Storybrooke.|$|E

500|$|Nate Meyers of Digitally Obsessed {{gave the}} episode a 3.5/5 rating and commented that [...] "perhaps {{it is not}} {{profound}} in its examination of jealousy causing people to behave irrationally, but it handles the topic in a serious manner while not compromising the show's humor. The side story with Bart stems from {{the era of the}} series when Bart was the big star, but it <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>some</b> funny bits." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson wrote: [...] "Mean Homer equals Funny Homer, so 'When Flanders Failed' presents an above average show. He seems unusually crude here, which makes him amusing. The subplot with Bart and his karate class also adds good material, especially when he threatens to turn the 'Touch of Death' on Lisa. Another sappy finish slightly mars this one, but it remains generally solid." [...] Kimberly Potts of AOL named it tenth best episode of the show and commented: [...] "Schadenfreude is the theme of this tight episode about Homer's joy at the failure of Flanders' Leftorium store. There are few times Homer is more shamelessly smug than he was while imitating Flanders and using Ned's yard sale grill, and we haven't even mentioned Bart's 'Touch of Death' subplot." [...] Winston-Salem Journals Tim Clodfelter called it an [...] "outstanding" [...] episode.|$|E
