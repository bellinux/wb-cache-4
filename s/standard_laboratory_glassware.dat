40|$|Deuterated arylamines {{demonstrate}} {{great potential}} for use in optoelectronic devices, but their widespread utility requires a method for large-scale synthesis. The incorporation of these deuterated materials into optoelectronic devices also provides the opportunity for studies of the functioning device using neutron reflectometry based on {{the difference in the}} scattering length density between protonated and deuterated compounds. Here we report mild deuteration conditions utilising <b>standard</b> <b>laboratory</b> <b>glassware</b> for the deuteration of: diphenylamine, N-phenylnaphthylamine, N-phenyl-o-phenylenediamine and 1 -naphthylamine (via H/D exchange in D 2 O at 80 °C, catalysed by Pt/C and Pd/C). These conditions were not successful in the deuteration of triphenylamine or N,N-dimethylaniline, suggesting that these mild conditions are not suitable for the deuteration of tertiary arylamines, but are likely to be applicable for the deuteration of other primary and secondary arylamines. The deuterated arylamines can then be used for synthesis of larger organic molecules or polymers with optoelectronic applications. © 2014, Creative Commons...|$|E
40|$|T he {{production}} of high quality, individual ly char-acterized libraries of compounds requires a well-developed strategy, along with robust, user-friendly data and automation systems {{to support this}} strategy. We developed a workflow process to improve the efficiency of producing greater than 50, 000 individual compounds per year. Our workflow process elimi-nates bottlenecks in traditiona l procedures and thus ensures a steady, predictable compound production rate. Initially, virtu-al library creation allowed for {{the determination of the}} physio-chemical properties of libraries as well as the ability to calculate the needed amounts of reagents and solvents for a production campaign. At this point, we registered all samples into our library database. Production of libraries began with loading the appropriate linkers onto resins, followed by com-plete characterization of the resin-linker intermediate. The resins were then loaded into IRORI MiniKans ™ and sorted using the IRORI Autosort ™ 10 Kx sorting workstation. Chemistry was then performed using <b>standard</b> <b>laboratory</b> <b>glassware.</b> Additional sorting and chemistry steps were then performed until the compound was ready for cleavage off of the resin. The MiniKans were then sorted into Bohdan MiniBlocks ™ and treated with the appropriate cleavage cock-tail. Collection into 48 -position racks was followed by removal of cleavage solution through vacuum centrifugation. The concentrate was then dissolved in a solvent mixture that allowed for standard liquid handling automation to create 96 well plates for analysis by high throughput flow inject NMR and LC/MS. Compounds> 80 % pure by LC/MS and present-ing a> 80 % overall yield, as determined by NMR, were auto-matically flagged “acceptable ” in the database. Compounds that failed to pass these analytical criteria were flagged “fail” in the database and were examined for trends that could be corrected in future library production. Finally, acceptable compounds were reformatted from the original source plates into master plates...|$|E
