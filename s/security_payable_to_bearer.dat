5000|$|The term {{note payable}} is {{commonly}} used in accounting (as distinguished from accounts payable) or commonly as just a [...] "note", it is internationally defined by the Convention providing a uniform law for bills of exchange and promissory notes, but regional variations exist.

5000|$|Bank {{notes are}} {{frequently}} {{referred to as}} promissory notes, a promissory note made by a bank and <b>payable</b> <b>to</b> <b>bearer</b> on demand.

The Law of 26 January 1831 provided for a copper exchange company (Sociedad encambio del cobre) to issue notes for 1 and 5 pesos {{in exchange for}} copper coin. These notes were <b>payable</b> <b>to</b> <b>bearer</b> at sight after 90 days in gold onzas, silver pesos fuertes or patacones, or in subsidiary Brazilian silver, and they were received by government offices at par with silver and gold coin.|$|R

500|$|In {{keeping with}} the verbiage on large-size silver {{certificates}}, all the small-size Series 1928 certificates carried the obligation [...] "This certifies that there has (or have) been deposited in the Treasury of the United States of America X silver dollar(s) <b>payable</b> <b>to</b> the <b>bearer</b> on demand" [...] or [...] "X dollars in silver coin <b>payable</b> <b>to</b> the <b>bearer</b> on demand". This required that the Treasury maintain stocks of silver dollars to back and redeem the silver certificates in circulation. Beginning with the Series 1934 silver certificates the wording was changed to [...] "This certifies that there is on deposit in the Treasury of the United States of America X dollars in silver <b>payable</b> <b>to</b> the <b>bearer</b> on demand." [...] This freed the Treasury from storing bags of silver dollars in its vaults, and allowed it to redeem silver certificates with bullion or silver granules, rather than silver dollars. Years after the government stopped the redemption of silver certificates for silver, large quantities of silver dollars intended specifically to satisfy the earlier obligation for redemption in silver dollars were found in Treasury vaults.|$|R

50|$|Thus, France {{had to pay}} {{on account}} of this convention, 383,251 francs every day for five years; equal to about 16,000 pounds {{sterling}} at the exchange rate of the day. For this daily quota, the French government had to give assignations on the French treasury, <b>payable</b> <b>to</b> <b>bearer,</b> day by day. In the first instance, however, the Coalition Commissioners were to receive {{the whole of the}} 700 million in fifteen bonds of 46⅔ million each; the first of which was payable on 31 March 1816, the second on 21 July 1816, and so on, every fourth month. In the month preceding the commencement of each of these four monthly periods, France was to redeem successively one of these bonds for 46⅔ millions, by exchanging it against the first-mentioned daily assignations <b>payable</b> <b>to</b> <b>bearer,</b> which assignations, for the purpose of convenience and negotiability, were again subdivided into coupures, or sets of smaller sums. As a guarantee for the regular payment of these assignations, and to provide for deficiencies, France assigned, moreover, to the allies, a fund of interest, to be inscribed in the Grand Livre of her public debt, of seven millions francs on a capital of 140 millions. A liquidation was to take place every six months, when the assignations duly discharged by the French Treasury were to be received as payments to their amount, and the deficiency arising from assignations not honoured would be made good, with interest, at five percent from the fund of interest inscribed in the Grand Livre, in a manner specified in this convention.|$|R
50|$|The Demand Notes {{were also}} {{authorized}} by the Act of July 17, 1861 and were a transitional issue connecting Treasury Notes to modern paper money. The denominations of the Demand Notes ($5, $10 and $20) complemented those of the Seven-Thirties ($50 to $5000) - {{much in the way}} that the Small Treasury Notes of 1815 complemented the Large Notes. The Demand Notes had been intended to function as money, and were <b>payable</b> <b>to</b> <b>bearer,</b> but were authorized within the legal framework of Treasury Notes since the U.S. was not generally assumed to have the authority to issue banknotes at that time. Eventually the Demand Notes were granted legal tender status and were replaced in function by United States Notes.|$|R

5000|$|A {{demand draft}} {{can also be}} {{compared}} to a cheque. However, demand drafts are difficult to countermand. Demand drafts can only be made <b>payable</b> <b>to</b> a specified party, also known as pay to order.

50|$|Eurobonds {{are named}} after the {{currency}} they are denominated in. For example, Euroyen and Eurodollar bonds are denominated in Japanese yen and American dollars respectively. Eurobonds were originally in <b>bearer</b> bond form, <b>payable</b> <b>to</b> the <b>bearer</b> and were also free of withholding tax. The bank paid the holder of the coupon the interest payment due. Usually, no official records were kept. The word Eurobond was originally created by Julius Strauss.|$|R
50|$|The U.S. dollar {{has been}} issued as silver {{certificates}} in the past, each one represented one silver dollar <b>payable</b> <b>to</b> the <b>bearer</b> on demand. The notes were issued in denominations of $10, $5, and $1; however, since 1968, {{they can no}} longer be redeemed for physical silver; nor for any other form of lawful money, except Federal Reserve Notes (or their coin-equivalents) - on a dollar for dollar basis.|$|R
50|$|However, large, {{long-term}} loans {{had a high}} element of risk for the lender and consequently gave high interest rates. Governments later began to issue bonds that were <b>payable</b> <b>to</b> the <b>bearer,</b> rather than the original purchaser. This meant that someone who lent the state money could sell on the debt to someone else, reducing the risks involved and reducing the overall interest rates. Examples of this are British Consols and American Treasury bill bonds.|$|R
50|$|Other {{notes were}} {{identified}} by a date of issue. Interest-bearing notes were carefully identified as to the date of issue, because they reached maturity a fixed amount of time later. Gold Certificates, issued upon the government receiving a deposit of gold, were dated by hand, and also the depositor was identified. Only the depositor could redeem an early gold certificate. Starting with the Series of 1882, Gold Certificates were made <b>payable</b> <b>to</b> the <b>bearer.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{shift toward}} {{the use of}} these {{receipts}} as a means of payment took place in the mid-17th century, as the price revolution, when relatively rapid gold inflation, was causing a re-assessment of how money worked. The goldsmith-bankers of London began to give out the receipts as <b>payable</b> <b>to</b> the <b>bearer</b> of the document rather than the original depositor. This meant that the note could be used as currency based on the security of the goldsmith, not the account holder of the Goldsmith-banker.|$|R
5000|$|Until 1910 banks could issue {{private bank}} notes, except in Queensland which issued {{treasury}} notes (1866-1869) and banknotes (1893-1910) which were legal tender in Queensland.

There were, however, some restrictions on their issue or other provisions {{for the protection of the}} public. Queensland treasury notes were legal tender in that state. Notes of both categories continued in circulation until 1910, when the Australian Notes Act 1910 prohibited the circulation of state notes as money and the Bank Notes Tax Act 1910 imposed a tax of 10% per annum on 'all bank notes issued or re-issued by any bank in the Commonwealth ... and not redeemed'. These Acts put an end to the issue of notes by the trading banks and the Queensland Treasury. The Reserve Bank Act 1959 expressly prohibits persons from issuing bills or notes <b>payable</b> <b>to</b> <b>bearer</b> on demand and intended for circulation. In 1910, the Australian pound was issued and was the legal tender in Australia.|$|R

5000|$|In 1901, {{notes in}} {{circulation}} in Australia consisted of bank notes payable in gold coin and issued by the trading banks, and Queensland Treasury notes.

There were, however, some restrictions on their issue and other provisions {{for the protection of the}} public. Queensland Treasury notes were issued by the Queensland Government and were legal tender in that state. Notes of both categories continued in circulation until 1910, when the Commonwealth Parliament passed the Australian Notes Act 1910 and the Bank Notes Tax Act 1910. The Australian Notes Act 1910 prohibited the circulation of state notes as money, and the Bank Notes Tax Act 1910 imposed a tax of ten per cent, per annum, on [...] "all bank notes issued or re-issued by any bank in the Commonwealth after the commencement of this Act, and not redeemed". These Acts effectively put an end to the issue of notes by the trading banks and the Queensland Treasury.

5000|$|Among {{the several}} issues of Treasury Notes of special note are the [...] "Small Treasury Notes" [...] {{authorized}} by the Act of February 24, 1815 which were intended to circulate as currency {{in the aftermath of}} the 1814 suspension of specie payment. The Act had been drafted during the financial disarray late in the War of 1812 and called for Notes of denomination less than $100 which would bear no interest. The issued denominations were as low as $3, their size was typical of banknotes and, unlike the previously issued Notes, they were <b>payable</b> <b>to</b> <b>bearer</b> rather than <b>to</b> order. However, they were not a Legal Tender for private transactions. Like the larger Notes issued under the February 24, 1815 Act, this issue was also supported by the government's promise to receive them at face value for purchasing bonds at par, but in the case of the Small Notes the bonds were to yield 7% interest. Before the notes could be issued, however, the war had ended - an occasion which led to the 7% bonds being worth more than par, and the Small Treasury Notes, of which $3,392,994 were originally issued, were rapidly exchanged for the bonds. [...] In witness to the limited circulation achieved by these notes, only two issued uncancelled examples of the Small Treasury Notes are known today.|$|R
50|$|Blank {{endorsement}} {{of a financial}} instrument, such as a cheque, is only a signature, not indicating the payee.

25|$|The bank {{issued its}} first {{banknotes}} in 1694, although before 1745 {{they were written}} for irregular amounts, rather than predefined multiples of a pound. It tended to be times of war, which put inflationary pressure on the British economy, that led to greater note issue. In 1759, during the Seven Years' War, when the lowest-value note issued by the Bank was £20, a £10 note was issued for the first time. In 1793, during the war with revolutionary France, the Bank issued the first £5 note. Four years later, £1 and £2 notes appeared, although not on a permanent basis. Notes did not become entirely machine-printed and <b>payable</b> <b>to</b> the <b>bearer</b> until 1855.|$|R
40|$|Under Section 20 (5) of the Bills of Exchange Act (‘‘BEA s. 20 (5) ”) {{where on}} a bill of {{exchange}} ‘‘the payee is a fictitious or non-existing person, the bill may be treated as <b>payable</b> <b>to</b> <b>bearer.</b> ” A bill of exchange includes a cheque. Where BEA s. 20 (5) applies to a cheque, its effect is to reallocate forged endorsement losses from banks involved in the collection and payment of the cheque to the drawer. Quite recently, in commenting on Raza Kayani LLP v. Toronto-Dominion Bank, I highlighted the ongoing confusion in the judicial interpretation of BEA s. 20 (5) (‘‘Kayani Comment”). That comment {{does not appear to}} have been available to the judges of the Ontario Court of Appeal in subsequently rendering their judgement in Teva Canada Ltd. v. Bank of Montreal (‘‘Teva”). At the same time, in invoking a policy rationale, in addition to relying on a precedent, the Court in Teva acknowledged my position as had been already expressed in a previous writing on the subject. It thus recognized that as regards to cheque fraud committed by an insider in and on a corporate drawer BEA s. 20 (5) is to be interpreted as allocating losses to ‘‘the drawer, who typically is better positioned to discover the fraud or insure against it. ” Accordingly, the Court in Teva distinguished Boma Manufacturing Ltd. v.

60|$|It is chiefly in {{the latter}} form [promissory notes] that it has become, in {{commercial}} countries, an express occupation to issue such substitutes for money. Dealers in money wish to lend, not their capital merely, but their credit, and not only such portion of their credit as consists of funds actually deposited with them, but their power of obtaining credit from the public generally, so far as {{they think they can}} safely employ it. This is done in a very convenient manner by lending their own promissory notes <b>payable</b> <b>to</b> <b>bearer</b> on demand—the borrower being willing to accept these as so much money, because the credit of the lender makes other people willingly receive them on the same footing, in purchases or other payments. These notes, therefore, perform all the functions of currency, and render an equivalent amount of money, which was previously in circulation, unnecessary. As, however, being payable on demand, they may be at any time returned on the issuer, and money demanded for them, he must, on pain of bankruptcy, keep by him as much money as will enable him to meet any claims of that sort which can be expected to occur within the time necessary for providing himself with more; and prudence also requires that he should not attempt to issue notes beyond the amount which experience shows can remain in circulation without being presented for payment.|$|R

40|$|Inspired by Gerschenkron's thesis, {{this paper}} contends that {{conditions}} of institutional 'backwardness' in late-medieval England stimulated legal innovations {{to provide the}} foundations for negotiability in international financial instruments. Though late-medieval England was not 'backward' in the senses expounded by so many earlier historians, her financial institutions, in comparison with those found on the continent, were far less developed. More retrograde were English fiscal and monetary policies, which {{played a major role}} in the fall of England's wool trade, once her most lucrative source of revenue, and thus indirectly in the expansion of her cloth export trade, which came to be canalized on the Antwerp market, where the major financial innovations did take place. Medieval English bullionist legislation was particularly regressive, by contemporary standards, in attempting to prevent the use of credit in foreign trade, in order to force exporters to repatriate receipts in bullio n even if such policies had a seemingly noble purpose: to protect the integrity of the coinage, while eschewing continental practices of debasement. In their application, however, they not only hindered the use of credit but also prevented the development of deposit banking, with domestic transfer instruments, on the continental model. English Common Law, furthermore, was generally hostile to any developments that would make bonds, especially registered recognizances, fully transferable and negotiable. But, from the late thirteenth century, the crown proved to be progressive in permitting mercantile courts to utilize the practices of an international lex mercatoria. From the 1360 s, English merchants in the wool and cloth trades sought to reduce their transaction costs, to avoid costly recognizances and litigation in Common Law courts, by resorting to informal holograph bills <b>payable</b> <b>to</b> <b>bearer.</b> But these lacked legal protection in transfer payments, until 1436, when the London Mayor's law-merchant court specifically awarded the bearer of a dishonoured bill-of-exchange rights equal to those of the designated payee: the first recorded in Europe, serving as the vital precedent for a similar Antwerp court ruling in 1506 and for national Habsburg legislation in the 1530 s to establish full negotiability of commercial bills, including discounting, with revocation of the usury laws. ...|$|R

This pivotal shift changed the simple promissory note into an agency for the expansion of the monetary supply itself. As these receipts were increasingly used in the money circulation system, depositors began to ask for multiple receipts to be made out in smaller, fixed denominations for use as money. The receipts soon became a written order to pay the amount to whoever had possession of the note. These notes are credited as the first modern banknotes.|$|R

50|$|The {{climax of}} his {{elevation}} occurred in June 1737 when, on {{the extinction of}} the line of Kettler, the nobility ('estates') of Courland were arm-twisted into electing Biron as their reigning duke. Anna had been the wife of the penultimate duke, whose successor, his uncle Ferdinand, died childless in that year. The Kettler dynasty being now extinct, the estates were called upon to elect a new duke, and Anna proposed Biron. He was almost as unpopular in Courland as in Russia, and the estates were mortified at the prospect of this upstart holding sway over them, but the will of the empress could not be easily gainsaid. Still, it was found necessary to supply large sums of money, smuggled into Courland in the shape of bills <b>payable</b> in Amsterdam <b>to</b> <b>bearer,</b> in order <b>to</b> persuade the electors to fall in with Anna's choice. There was another complication: the duchy of Courland was then in dispute between Poland and Russia. Russian armies were employed to place Augustus III, Elector of Saxony, on the Polish throne. In return, the Elector promised that Biron would be invested with the duchy of Courland. The Emperor Charles VI, subordinating everything to his Pragmatic Sanction, readily countenanced these violent acts, and the king of Prussia was bought by certain territorial concessions. The investiture took place in 1739 at Warsaw by authority of the Polish king and senate.|$|R
