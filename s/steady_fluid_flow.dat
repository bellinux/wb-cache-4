A {{design of a}} two-dimensional acoustic metacage with subwavelength thickness which can shield acoustic waves from all directions while allowing <b>steady</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>flow</b> is presented in this paper. The structure is designed based on acoustic gradient-index metasurfaces composed of open channels and shunted Helmholtz resonators. The strong parallel momentum on the metacage surface rejects in-plane sound at an arbitrary angle of incidence which leads to low sound transmission through the metacage. The performance of the proposed metacage is verified by numerical simulations and measurements on a three-dimensional printed prototype.

Stream surfaces can depict the structure of a flow field more effectively than is possible with mere streamline curves, but careful placement of the rakes is needed to most effectively depict the important features of the flow. I have built visualization software which supports the interactive calculation and display of stream surfaces in flow fields represented on composite curvilinear grids. This software exploits several novel methods to improve the speed with which a particle may be advected through a vector field.

It is shown that existing approximations in which the effect of dispersion in the transport equation is ignored can affect significantly the value determined for the Michaelis-Menten saturation constant.

40|$|An {{integral}} {{balance is}} developed for <b>steady</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>flows</b> relating dissipation in volumes bounded by isosurfaces of a tracer (quasi-conserved quantity) and solid boundaries to the covariance of the tracer value and surface fluxes across the boundaries. The balance {{is used to}} estimate upper bounds for vertical eddy diffusion coefficients for temperature and salinity in various volumes of the ocean. The vertical temperature diffusivity is calculated to be small, O(0. 1 3 1024 m 2 s 21), except for the warmest and coldest volumes of the ocean. The vertical salinity diffusivity for the volume that makes {{up most of the}} deep ocean is estimated to be O(1 3 1024 m 2 s 21). Sources of error in these calculations are discussed, and the sensitivity to errors in the surface flux data is evaluated. The dissipation integral is also applied to demonstrate some related results concerning extrema and homog-enization. The Prandtl–Batchelor theorem is a special case of one of these results. As a consequence of these results, if turbulent transfer is downgradient and there are no internal sources or sinks, a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for a climatological tracer distribution to be in a steady state is the absence of internal extrema. The climatological salinity distribution does not appear to violate this condition. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} the dynamic analysis of initially tensioned orthotropic thin-walled cylindrical tubes conveying <b>steady</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>flow,</b> based on Sanders' non-linear theory of thin shells and the classical potential flow theory. The method is relatively straightforward, using a hydrodynamic pressure formulation derived from the velocity potential, a dynamic coupling condition at the fluid-structure interface and two-noded frustum elements to assess the dynamic behaviour of these tube/fluid systems accurately. A non-linear strain-displacement relationship is also deployed to derive the geometric stiffness matrix due to the initial stresses and hydrostatic pressures. The equations of motion for the tube and fluid are solved by a finite element method, and this is validated by comparing the natural frequencies obtained with other published results. The influence of material properties, fluid flow velocities and initial axial tensions on the natural frequencies is then illustrated and discussed...|$|E

There {{are two types}} of LANS-α equations: the anisotropic version in which the fluctuation tensor is a dynamic variable that is coupled with the evolution equations for the mean velocity, and the isotropic version in which the covariance tensor is assumed to be a constant multiple of the identity matrix. We prove the global-in-time existence and uniqueness of weak solutions to the isotropic LANS-α equations for the case of no-slip boundary conditions.
