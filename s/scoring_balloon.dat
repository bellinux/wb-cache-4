40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the influence of lesion preparation using the dual wire <b>scoring</b> <b>balloon</b> on stent expansion and long-term outcomes. Methods: Forty-six consecutive de novo lesions treated with a single > 2. 5 mm drug-eluting stent under intravascular ultrasound guidance, using two implantation strategies, were randomly assigned to: 1) pre-dilation with a non-compliant balloon (NC group; n = 23) or 2) pre-dilation with a dual wire <b>scoring</b> <b>balloon</b> (DS group; n = 23). Results: Although the balloon size and the maximal dilation pressure for pre-dilatation was larger (3. 33 ± 0. 28 vs 3. 09 ± 0. 33 mm, p = 0. 01) and higher (11. 6 ± 3. 2 vs 8. 6 ± 2. 7 atm, p < 0. 01) in the NC group than the DS group, there were no significant differences in the stent expansion. Quantitative coronary angiography at the follow-up demonstrated a smaller in-stent late loss (0. 71 ± 0. 63 mm vs 0. 23 ± 0. 52 mm, p = 0. 03) in the DS group. During the long-term follow-up, there were no significant differences in the major adverse cardiac event rates. Conclusions: Lesion preparation with a dual wire <b>scoring</b> <b>balloon</b> prior to drug-eluting stent implantation might therefore be a more feasible strategy than that using a non-compliant balloon. </span...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Nonalcoholic {{fatty liver}} disease (NAFLD) {{is one of}} the most {{important}} causes of liver-related morbidity and mortality in children. Recently, we have reported the effects of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), the major dietary long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, in children with NAFLD. DHA exerts a potent anti-inflammatory activity through the G protein-coupled receptor (GPR) 120. Our aim was to investigate in pediatric NAFLD the mechanisms underlying the effects of DHA administration on histo-pathological aspects, GPR 120 expression, hepatic progenitor cell activation and macrophage pool. Patients and Methods: 20 children with untreated NAFLD were included. Children were treated with DHA for 18 months. Liver biopsies before and after the treatment were analyzed. Hepatic progenitor cell activation, macrophage pool and GPR 120 expression were evaluated and correlated with clinical and histo-pathological parameters. Results: GPR 120 was expressed by hepatocytes, liver macrophages, and hepatic progenitor cells. After DHA treatment, the following modifications were present: i) the improvement of histo-pathological parameters such as NAFLD activity <b>score,</b> <b>ballooning,</b> and steatosis; ii) the reduction of hepatic progenitor cell activation in correlation with histo-pathological parameters; iii) the reduction of the number of inflammatory macrophages; iv) the increase of GPR 120 expression in hepatocytes; v) the reduction of serine- 311 -phosphorylated nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) nuclear translocation in hepatocytes and macrophages in correlation with serum inflammatory cytokines. Conclusions: DHA could modulate hepatic progenitor cell activation, hepatocyte survival and macrophage polarization through the interaction with GPR 120 and NF-kB repression. In this scenario, the modulation of GPR 120 exploits a novel crucial role in the regulation of the cell-to-cell cross-talk that drives inflammatory response, hepatic progenitor cell activation and hepatocyte survival. © 2014 Nobili et al...|$|R
40|$|SummaryDespite {{developments}} in coronary interventional cardiology, plaque calcification {{is a critical}} issue of stent expansion. AngioSculpt <b>Scoring</b> <b>Balloon</b> Catheter® (AngioSculpt; AngioScore Inc., Fremont, CA, USA) can produce more ‘scoring’ marks, which leads to prevention of ‘plaque shift’ and ‘balloon slippage’; moreover, the ‘scoring’ produces some cutting effect, leading to successful stent implantation even on severe calcified lesions. We have applied AngioSculpt on severe calcified lesions to achieve its adequate expansion, and report the mechanism of the ‘scoring’ and its efficacy evaluated by three-dimensional stereoscopic reconstruction (3 -D) of optical coherence tomography (OCT; LightLab Imaging, Inc., Westford, MA, USA). The patient is a 64 -year-old male, who had diffuse stenosis in the left circumflex coronary artery (LCX) with severe calcifications, and was treated using AngioSculpt. AngioSculpt predilatation with a high pressure led to successful stent implantation. The radial scores were clearly imaged by 3 -D OCT, demonstrating that radial nitinol wires made spiral indents from the relative weak points at the surface adjacent to calcification, {{which resulted in a}} less traumatic and safe dilatation although the scoring mark was not recognized clearly in intravascular ultrasound. This report suggests AngioSculpt might become one of the options for a severe calcified lesion...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: We {{sought to}} {{determine}} the efficacy and safety of a <b>scoring</b> <b>balloon</b> {{for the treatment of}} in-stent restenosis (ISR). Background: The optimal therapy for ISR is not yet properly established and subject to many discussions. The GRIP™ Balloon (Acrostak, Switzerland) might be of interest for the treatment of certain types of ISR. Methods: Between 2003 and 2009, 157 patients who were treated for ISR (182 lesions, 164 interventions) with the GRIP™ balloon were retrieved from our database and followed clinically. The safety endpoint was the occurrence of immediate coronary complication (such as perforation or dissection). The efficacy endpoint was freedom from major adverse cardiac events (MACE: cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and target lesion revascularisation) at 12 -month clinical follow-up. Results: Mean age was 65 ± 11 years and 82 % were men. A focal ISR was found in 54 % (n = 93) of lesions. Additional stenting was performed in 22 % of lesions after angioplasty with the GRIP™ balloon. There was no perforation as immediate coronary complication whereas localised dissection was identified in five patients (3 %). Survival was 98 % at 12 months. MACE occurred in 13 % of patients (n = 21). Target lesion revascularisation (TLR) needed to be performed in 17 (11 %). Myocardial infarction occurred in 2 (1 %), and stent thrombosis occurred in 1 (1 %) patient. MACE rates were higher in patients with diffuse ISR (20 %) compared with focal ISR (7 %) (p = 0. 02). Conclusions: Balloon angioplasty with the GRIP™ balloon for ISR can be safely and successfully performed, and leads to good clinical outcome in patients presenting with focal ISR...|$|E

Methods Fifty Wistar rats were randomized into five groups: G 1 (feed with standard diet); G 2 (feed with high-fat diet with 58 % of energy from fat); G 3 (high-fat diet + standardized Panax ginseng extract at 100 mg/kg/day); G 4 (high-fat diet + standardized Camellia sinensis extract at 100 mg/kg/day); and G 5 (high-fat diet + bezafibrate at 100 mg/kg/day), given by gavage. The animals were sacrificed eight weeks later and blood was collected for glucose, insulin, cholesterol, triglycerides, AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transferase determinations.

30|$|In this study, {{we clearly}} {{showed that the}} hepatic uptake of 18 F-FPP-RGD 2 was {{correlated}} with the hepatic expression of integrin αvβ 3 in CDAHFD-fed NASH model mice. The CDAHFD-fed model was developed as a new NAFLD/NASH mouse model and has a rapid onset and progression of hepatic fibrosis compared with the methionine-choline-deficient diet-fed mouse model [20]. In the present study, high ALT and ASL levels, steatosis, inflammation, and ballooning were observed in 3 - and 8 -week CDAHFD-fed mice. To assess the NASH pathology, the sum of steatosis score, inflammation <b>score,</b> and <b>ballooning</b> <b>score</b> called NAS, were used. According to the criteria, a NAS of 5 or more is diagnosed as “definitive NASH” and NAS of 3 or 4 is diagnosed as ‘borderline NASH’ [26]. Therefore, in this study, CDAHFD 3 and 8  weeks fed mice were considered as NASH-like pathology. However, Sirius red stain-positive areas were only observed in CDAHFD mice fed for 8  weeks. These results indicate that CDAHFD mice fed for 3  weeks developed NAFLD/NASH with minimal or no fibrosis and that CDAHFD mice fed for 8  weeks developed moderate fibrosis. A previous study reported that the mRNA and protein expressions of integrin αvβ 3 were increased during the development and progression of liver fibrosis in CCl 4 and thioacetamide models, which are used as hepatic fibrosis models commonly [19, 20, 27]. In this study, CDAHFD mice fed for 3  weeks had increased hepatic integrin αv and β 3 and α-SMA mRNA expressions, which are indicators of HSCs. Mouse fed a methionine choline-deficient diet, another commonly used NASH model, revealed an increase in α-SMA before fibrosis [21]. Therefore, it was considered that integrin αvβ 3 might be increased with HSC activation rather than fibrosis in the livers of NASH model mice induced by a methionine choline-deficient diet.|$|R

Cultured cells and animal models have been used to identify differently-regulated genes that might explain this effect. No studies evaluating the effect of coffee consumption on liver gene expression in patients with liver disease have been reported. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD who completed questionnaires about coffee consumption were classified into 3 groups: none (n = 108), minimal-to moderate (or = 7 servings/week; n = 88). Univariate and multivariate analysis were used to assess the relationship between coffee consumption, various histologic parameters (e. g., steatosis, NAS activity <b>score,</b> <b>ballooning,</b> fibrosis), and potentially-relevant demographic variables (e. g., age, gender, BMI). RNA was also isolated from the liver biopsies of 48 of these subjects and subjected to microarray analysis using Affymetrix genechip HGU 133 -plus 2. 0 to determine changes in liver gene expression associated with coffee consumption. 37 % of these 48 patients had advanced fibrosis (F 3 - 4) and 63 % had early fibrosis (F 0 - 1). Of the 23 patients who drank more than 7 cups/week, 18 (78 %) had F 0 - 1 fibrosis and 5 (22 %) had F 3 - 4 fibrosis (p= 0. 06). RESULTS: Coffee consumption was inversely associated with fibrosis severity in univariate analysis (p< 0. 012). In multivariate analysis, advanced fibrosis was positively correlated with age (p< 0. 04) and negatively correlated with coffee consumption (p< 0. 01). Coffee consumption was also associated with lower HbA 1 c values (r- 0. 17; p= 0. 01). However, the association of coffee consumption and lower fibrosis was independent of HbA 1 c (p= 0. 047). Consumption of other caffeine containing beverages, such as tea and soda, was not associated with fibrosis stage. Using linear regression analysis our microarray analysis confirmed a significant relationship between daily coffee consumption and lower expression of transforming growth factor -beta 1 (TGFβ 1) and higher expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD), Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alfa (PPARα) and gluthation-S-transferase (GST). CONCLUSION: Coffee consumption of at least a cup a day appears protective against fibrosis progression in NAFLD.

Whether coffee consumption is also protective against liver injury and/or fibrosis in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remains unknown. Patients and Methods: Patients with biopsy proven NAFLD (n = 296) for whom life-style questionnaire with coffee consumption history was obtained at time of liver biopsy were evaluated. Coffee consumption was classified as none, minimal-to moderate (< 7 servings/week) and daily (≥ 7 servings/week). In this group, univariant and multivariant analysis were used to assess the relationship between coffee consumption, various histologic parameters (e. g., steatosis, NAS activity <b>score,</b> <b>ballooning,</b> fibrosis), and potentially-relevant demographic variables (e. g., age, gender, BMI). RNA was also isolated from the liver biopsies of 72 of these subjects and subjected to microarray analysis using “Affymetrix genechip HGU 133 -plus 2. 0 ” to determine if changes in liver gene expression might be attributable to coffee consumption. Results: In univariate analysis, fibrosis stage was inversely related to the amount of coffee consumed (see figure), with higher coffee consumers (≥ 7 cups weekly) having significantly lower fibrosis stage than those who drank less coffee (p = 0. 011). Similar trends were noted for coffee consumption and ballooning (p = 0. 089), steatosis (p = 0. 094) and NASH activity score (p = 0. 059). In multivariate analysis, advanced fibrosis was positively correlated with age (p < 0. 04) and negatively correlated with coffee consumption (p < 0. 01). Coffee consumption was also associated with lower HbA 1 c values (r- 0. 17; p = 0. 01), however, the association of coffee consumption and lower fibrosis was independent of HbA 1 c (p = 0. 047). Consumption of other caffeine containing beverages, such as tea and soda, were not associated with fibrosis stage. Unbiased expression array data in patients with NASH who drank one or more cups of coffee/day compared to NASH patients with lower coffee consumption revealed 4 genes of interest differentially expressed, all of which were up-regulated with habitual coffee consumption: UGT 2, CYP 26 A 1, CYP 3 A 7, CYP 7 B 1.

40|$|Non-alcoholic {{fatty liver}} disease (NAFLD) {{is the most}} common form of liver disease and ranges from {{isolated}} steatosis to NASH. To determine whether circulating fatty acids could serve as diagnostic markers of NAFLD severity and whether specific fatty acids could contribute to the pathogenesis of NASH, we analyzed two independent NAFLD patient cohorts and used the methionine- and choline-deficient diet (MCD) NASH mouse model. We identified six fatty acids that could serve as non-invasive markers of NASH in patients with NAFLD. Serum levels of 15 : 0, 17 : 0 and 16 : 1 n 7 t negatively correlated with NAFLD activity <b>scores</b> and hepatocyte <b>ballooning</b> <b>scores,</b> while 18 : 1 n 7 c serum levels strongly correlated with fibrosis stage and liver inflammation. Serum levels of 15 : 0 and 17 : 0 also negatively correlated with fasting glucose and AST, while 16 : 1 n 7 c and 18 : 1 n 7 c levels positively correlated with AST and ferritin, respectively. Inclusion of demographic and clinical parameters improved the performance of the fatty acid panels in detecting NASH in NAFLD patients. The panel [15 : 0, 16 : 1 n 7 t, 18 : 1 n 7 c, 22 : 5 n 3, age, ferritin and APRI] predicted intermediate or advanced fibrosis in NAFLD patients, with 82 % sensitivity at 90 % specificity [AUROC = 0. 92]. 15 : 0 and 18 : 1 n 7 c were further selected for functional studies in vivo. Mice treated with 15 : 0 -supplemented MCD diet showed reduced AST levels and hepatic infiltration of ceroid-laden macrophages compared to MCD-treated mice, suggesting that 15 : 0 deficiency contributes to liver injury in NASH. In contrast, 18 : 1 n 7 c-supplemented MCD diet didn't affect liver pathology. In conclusion, 15 : 0 may serve as a promising biomarker or therapeutic target in NASH, opening avenues for the integration of diagnosis and treatment...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The {{diagnosis}} of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis staging {{are central to}} non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) assessment. We evaluated multi-parametric magnetic resonance (MR) {{in the assessment of}} NASH and fibrosis using histology as standard in NAFLD. METHODS: Seventy one patients with suspected NAFLD were recruited within one month of liver biopsy. MR data were used to define the liver inflammation and fibrosis score (LIF 0 - 4). Biopsies were assessed for steatosis, lobular inflammation, ballooning and fibrosis and classified as NASH or simple steatosis, and mild or significant (Activity ≥ 2 and / or Fibrosis ≥ 2 as defined by the Fatty Liver Inhibition of Progression consortium) NAFLD. Transient elastography (TE) was also performed. RESULTS: MR success rate was 95 % vs 59 % for TE (p< 0. 0001). Fibrosis stage on biopsy correlated with LIF (rs = 0. 51, p< 0. 0001). The area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) using LIF for the {{diagnosis of}} cirrhosis was 0. 85. LIF <b>score</b> for <b>ballooning</b> grades 0, 1 and 2 was 1. 2, 2. 7 and 3. 5 respectively (p< 0. 05) with an AUROC of 0. 83 for the diagnosis of ballooning. Patients with steatosis had lower LIF (1. 3) compared to patients with NASH (3. 0) (p< 0. 0001); AUROC for the diagnosis of NASH was 0. 80. LIF scores for patients with mild and significant NAFLD were 1. 2 and 2. 9 respectively (p< 0. 0001). The AUROC of LIF for the diagnosis of significant NAFLD was 0. 89.

40|$|Nonalcoholic {{fatty liver}} disease (NAFLD) {{is a growing}} medical problem around the world. NAFLD {{patients}} with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) can develop cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The ability to distinguish NASH from simple steatosis would be of great clinical significance. Ballooning hepatocytes are characteristic of typical pathological NASH; here, the polarized secretion of proteins is disrupted due to destruction of the cytoskeleton. We previously reported that fucosylated glycoproteins are secreted into bile, but not into sera in normal liver. Therefore, we hypothesized that the fucosylation-based sorting machinery would be disrupted in ballooning hepatocytes, and serum fucosylated glycoproteins would increase in NASH patients. To confirm our hypothesis, we evaluated serum fucosylated haptoglobin (Fuc-Hpt) levels in biopsy-proven NAFLD patients (n = 126) using a lectin-antibody ELISA kit. Fuc-Hpt levels were significantly increased in NASH patients compared with non-NASH (NAFLD patients without NASH) patients. Interestingly, Fuc-Hpt levels showed a significant stepwise increase with increasing hepatocyte <b>ballooning</b> <b>scores.</b> Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that Fuc-Hpt levels were independent and significant determinants {{of the presence of}} ballooning hepatocytes.
