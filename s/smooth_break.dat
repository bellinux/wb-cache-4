40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose Granger (non-) {{causality}} tests based on a VAR model allowing for time-varying coefficients. The functional form of the time-varying coefficients is a Logistic Smooth Transition Autoregressive (LSTAR) model using time as the transition variable. The model allows for testing Granger non-causality when the VAR is subject to a <b>smooth</b> <b>break</b> in the coefficients of the Granger causal variables. The proposed test then {{is applied to the}} money-output relationship using quarterly US data for the period 1952 : 2 - 2002 : 4.

40|$|We {{present results}} from a {{high-resolution}} and large-scale hybrid (fluid electrons and particle-in-cell protons) two-dimensional numerical simulation of decaying turbulence. Two distinct spectral regions (separated by a <b>smooth</b> <b>break</b> at proton scales) develop with clear power-law scaling, each one occupying about a decade in wave numbers. The simulation results exhibit simultaneously several properties of the observed solar wind fluctuations: spectral indices of the magnetic, kinetic, and residual energy spectra in the magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) inertial range along with a flattening of the electric field spectrum, an increase in magnetic compressibility, and a strong coupling of the cascade with the density and the parallel component of the magnetic fluctuations at sub-proton scales. Our findings support the interpretation that in the solar wind large-scale MHD fluctuations naturally evolve beyond proton scales into a turbulent regime that is governed by the generalized Ohm's law.

40|$|The {{possibility}} that a series can contain {{an unknown number of}} smooth breaks raises two distinct problems. First, even if the breaks are sharp, the number of breaks and the break dates themselves are generally unknown and need to be estimated along with the other parameters of the model. Second, even if the number of breaks is known, the possibility of a <b>smooth</b> <b>break</b> means that the functional form of the break is unknown to the researcher. A misspecification of the functional form of the breaks may be as problematic as ignoring the breaks altogether. Moreover, ever if a series contains no breaks, it may be subject to other nonlinearities or parameter instabilities. We summarize a number of papers that use a variant of Gallant’s (1981) Flexible Fourier Form to control for the unknown number and form of the breaks. The paper details and illustrates several unit root tests, stationarity tests, and tests for parameter instability that are based on a Fourier approximation...|$|E

40|$|We present {{analyses}} of the two-point correlation properties of the ESP galaxy redshift survey. From the redshift-space correlation function xi(s), we see positive clustering out to separations 50 /h Mpc, with a <b>smooth</b> <b>break</b> on larger scales and zero-crossing between 60 and 80 /h Mpc. xi(s) is reasonably well described by a shallow power law with γ 1. 5 between 3 and 50 /h Mpc, while on smaller scales (0. 2 - 2 /h Mpc) it has a shallower slope (γ 1). We examine the full effect of redshift-space distortions through the two-dimensional correlation function xi(rp,pi), from which we project out the real-space xi(r) below 10 /h Mpc. This function is well described by a power-law model (r/r_o) ^-γ, with r_o= 4. 15 ^+ 0. 20 _- 0. 21 h^- 1 Mpc and consistent picture in which clustering remains positive out to separations of 50 /h Mpc or larger, in substantial agreement with the results obtained from angular surveys like the APM and EDSGC. Also {{the shape of the}} two-point correlation function is remarkably unanimous among these data sets, in all cases requiring more power above 5 /h Mpc (a `shoulder'), than a simple extrapolation of the canonical xi(r) =(r/ 5) ^- 1. 8. xi(s) for volume-limited subsamples shows evidence of luminosity segregation only for the most luminous sample with M_b_J< - 20. 5. When redshift-space distortions are removed through projection of xi(rp,pi), however, a weak dependence on luminosity is seen at small separations also at fainter magnitudes. This effect is masked in redshift space, as the mean pairwise velocity dispersion experiences a parallel increase, basically erasing the effect of the clustering growth on xi(s) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{report on}} optical and {{near-infrared}} (NIR) follow-up {{observations of the}} afterglow of GRB 030226, mainly performed with the telescopes at ESO La Silla and Paranal, with additional data obtained at other places. Our first observations started 0. 2 days after the burst when the afterglow was at a magnitude of R approximately equal to 19. One week later {{the magnitude of the}} afterglow had fallen to R= 25, and at two weeks after the burst it could no longer be detected (R > 26). Our VLT blueband spectra show two absorption line systems at redshifts z = 1. 962 +/- 0. 001 and at z = 1. 986 +/- 0. 001, placing the redshift of the burster close to 2. Within our measurement errors no evidence for variations in the line strengths has been found between 0. 2 and 1. 2 days after the burst. An overabundance of alpha-group elements might indicate that the burst occurred in a chemically young interstellar region shaped by the nucleosynthesis from type II supernovae. The spectral slope of the afterglow shows no signs for cosmic dust along the line of sight in the GRB host galaxy, which itself remained undetected (R > 26. 2). At the given redshift no supernova component affected the light from the GRB afterglow, so that the optical transient was essentially only powered by the radiation from the GRB fireball, allowing for a detailed investigation of the color evolution of the afterglow light. In our data set no obvious evidence for color changes has been found before, during, or after the <b>smooth</b> <b>break</b> in the light curve approximately 1 day after the burst. In comparison with investigations by others, our data favor the interpretation that the afterglow began to develop into a homogeneous interstellar medium before the break in the light curve became apparent...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to study {{discontinuous}} Galerkin methods applied to coupled systems of partial differential equations in conservative form in 1 D and 2 D.

An alternate set of shallow water equations were derived yielding equivalent results for a continuous problem but different numerical solutions for the breaking dam problem.

However, the X-ray afterglow is contaminated by a nearby, variable source, which especially at late times obscures the behavior of the X-ray afterglow. We argue that ``anomalous'' optical afterglows are likely to be the norm, and that the rapid variations often seen in Swift-XRT data would also be seen in the optical light curves, given good enough sampling. As a result, some of the often employed procedures, such as deriving the jet opening angle using a smooth broken power-law fit to the optical light curves, in many cases might have a poor statistical significance. We argue that the early increase in brighness for both bursts might be due to the turn-on of the external shock. Existence of such features could provide valuable additional information about the burst.

Telematics insurance or usage-based insurance (UBI) can drive down the cost for low-mileage clients and good drivers. Car insurance is traditionally priced based on self-reported information from the policyholder, most importantly: age, license age, postal code, engine power, use of the vehicle, and claims history. Over time, insurers try to refine this a priori risk classification and restore fairness using no-claim discounts and claim penalties {{in the form of}} the bonus-malus system. It is expected that these traditional methods of risk assessment will become obsolete. Your car usage and your driver abilities can be better assessed based on telematics data collected, such as: the distance driven, the time of day, how long you have been driving, the location, the speed, harsh or <b>smooth</b> <b>breaking,</b> aggressive acceleration or deceleration, your cornering and parking skills [...] . This high dimensional data, collected on the fly, will force pricing actuaries to change their current practice. New statistical models will have to be developed to adequately set premiums based on individual policyholder’s motoring habits instead of the risk associated to their peer group. In this work, we take a first step in this direction. We analyze a telematics data set from a European insurer, collected in between 2010 and 2014, in which information is collected on the amount of meters insureds drive. Besides the number of meters driven, we also registered how this distance is divided over the different kind of road types and time slots. This data allows car insurers the use of real driving exposure to price the contract.
