[...] By the next day, however, Anonymous claimed to have taken down 3,824 pro-ISIS Twitter accounts, and by the third, more than 5,000, and to have doxxed recruiters. A week later, Anonymous increased their claim to 20,000 accounts and released a list of the accounts. The list included the Twitter accounts of Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, The New York Times and BBC News. The BBC reported that most of the accounts on the list appeared to be still active. A spokesman for Twitter told The Daily Dot that the company is not using the lists of accounts being reported by Anonymous, as they have been found to be “wildly inaccurate” and include accounts used by academics and journalists.|$|E

50|$|Through the 1950s, {{understanding}} of supersonic aerodynamics had improved {{to the point}} where <b>sustained</b> <b>operation</b> at high Mach was first becoming possible. A combination of new engines, engine intakes, new planforms like the delta wing, and new materials like titanium and stainless steel had solved many of the problems of earlier designs.

50|$|In November 1978, rhetoric was {{succeeded by}} {{full-scale}} action: Vietnamese forces launched a <b>sustained</b> <b>operation</b> on Cambodian {{soil in the}} area of Snuol and Memot (both in Kratié Province). This action cleared a liberated zone where anti-Khmer Rouge Cambodians could launch a broad-based political movement that would offer an alternative to the odious Pol Pot regime. Proclamation of this movement, the Kampuchean (or Khmer) National United Front for National Salvation (KNUFNS), took place in a rubber plantation clearing on 2 December 1978, amid rigid security provided by heavily armed Vietnamese units reinforced with airdefense weapons.|$|E

50|$|The {{key to a}} {{practical}} jet engine was the gas turbine, {{used to extract energy}} from the engine itself to drive the compressor. The gas turbine was not an idea developed in the 1930s: the patent for a stationary turbine was granted to John Barber in England in 1791. The first gas turbine to successfully run self-sustaining was built in 1903 by Norwegian engineer Ægidius Elling. Limitations in design and practical engineering and metallurgy prevented such engines reaching manufacture. The main problems were safety, reliability, weight and, especially, <b>sustained</b> <b>operation.</b>|$|E
50|$|Scramjet engines {{operate on}} the same {{principles}} as ramjets, but do not decelerate the flow to subsonic velocities. Rather, a scramjet combustor is supersonic: the inlet decelerates the flow to a lower Mach number for combustion, after which it is accelerated to an even higher Mach number through the nozzle. By limiting the amount of deceleration, temperatures within the engine are kept at a tolerable level, from both a material and combustive standpoint. Even so, current scramjet technology {{requires the use of}} high-energy fuels and active cooling schemes to maintain <b>sustained</b> <b>operation,</b> often using hydrogen and regenerative cooling techniques.|$|E
50|$|The first Optacon {{prototype}} {{using this}} retina was completed on September 1, 1969. It was portable and completely self-contained {{in that it}} combined the stimulator array, electronics, batteries, and camera in a single package measuring 13.5″ by 8″ by 2.25″. The total weight was 9 pounds. The low power electronics design in this unit was a joint effort by J. S. Brugler and W. T. Young which made possible about 12 hours of <b>sustained</b> <b>operation</b> from the rechargeable batteries. This unit included an improved optical system and camera plus a tactile bimorph driven screen, both developed by James Baer and John Gill at SRI.|$|E

50|$|The {{common valve}} spring system is {{satisfactory}} for traditional mass-produced engines {{that do not}} rev highly and are of a design that requires low maintenance. At the period of initial desmodromic development, valve springs were a major limitation on engine performance because they would break from metal fatigue. Vacuum melt processes developed in the 1950s helped remove impurities in the steel used to make valve springs, although after <b>sustained</b> <b>operation</b> above 8000 RPM often springs would still fail. The desmodromic system was devised to remedy this problem. Furthermore, as maximum RPM increases, higher spring force is required to prevent valve float, leading to increased cam drag and higher wear on the parts at all speeds, problems addressed by the desmodromic mechanism.|$|E
50|$|The great speed {{required}} for supercavitation to {{work can be}} achieved temporarily by a projectile fired under water or by an airborne projectile impacting the water. Rocket propulsion {{can be used for}} <b>sustained</b> <b>operation,</b> with the possibility of tapping high pressure gas to route to the object's nose in order to enhance the cavitation bubble. An example of rocket propulsion is the Russian VA-111 Shkval supercavitating torpedo. In principle, maneuvering may be achieved by various means such as drag fins that project through the bubble into the surrounding liquid (p. 22), by tilting the nose of the object, by injecting gas asymmetrically near the nose in order to distort the geometry of the cavity, by vectoring rocket thrust through gimbaling for a single nozzle, or by differential thrust for multiple nozzles.|$|E
5000|$|The Rothesays served {{throughout}} the 1960s and 1970s, with Londonderry {{converted into a}} weapons and electronics trials vessel in 1975. The successful performance of the Rothesays, and the ability they showed for <b>sustained</b> <b>operation</b> in rough North Atlantic sea conditions during the 1976 Cod War, showed {{that they were still}} relevant to the Royal Navy's main role of displaying that it had the ability to restrict Soviet submarine penetration through the Greenland-Iceland-UK Gap during the intensification of the Cold War. A more generous naval budget in the late 1970s provided by the new Prime Minister, the former RN Clerk James Callaghan, led to a provisional decision to retain the Rothesays through the 1980s with a second long refit. Plymouth, Yarmouth, and Rothesay were given full two year refits in 1978-81 with some significant updates of radar.|$|E

50|$|In October 1943, the Director of Naval Construction was {{instructed}} to prepare plans for a class of Landing Craft Tank vessels suitable for travelling to and operating in the Far East. They had {{to be capable of}} ocean operations and able to keep up with Landing Ship, Infantry convoys. Greater ranges and more lengthy periods of <b>sustained</b> <b>operation</b> than in the European or Mediterranean theatres would require a larger vessel with better seakeeping ability. Design and capabilities were heavily influenced by the United States' Mark 7 LCT (which was later re-categorised as Landing Ship Medium), which was capable of transporting multiple tanks over large distances. The Mark 8 was a synthesis of the best qualities of previous amphibious warfare vessels: the design was based on an enlarged version of the Mark 4 LCT, incorporating its light construction and suitability for mass-production, while including the robustness of the Mark 3 design, and adopting the bow layout and other elements from the Mark 2 Landing Ship Tank.|$|E
