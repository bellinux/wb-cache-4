40|$|A {{technique}} for detecting the pitches of a polyphonic signal is presented. The system utilises modified IIR comb filters, which are generated {{to ensure that}} a null (<b>stop</b> band <b>notches)</b> exists at multiples of note frequencies and that a very flat pass band is present in the remain of the spectrum. Thus, the signal spectrum is not distorted after applying the filters to the audio signal, which is the case when using FIR comb filters. the presented approach improves upon an existing multi pitch detection model based on a FIR comb filter framework...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{previously}} published papers by the authors, the specific heat energy loss per cycle (the Q parameter) {{was used to}} rationalize about 120 experimental results generated from constant amplitude, push-pull, stress- or strain-controlled fatigue tests on plain and notched hot rolled AISI 304 L stainless steel specimens {{as well as from}} cold drawn un-notched bars of the same steel, tested under fully-reversed axial or torsional fatigue loadings. It has been shown that Q can be estimated starting from the cooling gradient measured at the critical point immediately after the fatigue test has been <b>stopped.</b> Concerning <b>notched</b> specimens, it was noted that a 3 mm notch tip radius was close to the limitation of applicability of the adopted temperature sensor, consisting in 0. 127 -mm-diameter thermocouples, because of the 1. 5 -to- 2 mm diameter spot of the glue which prevented to measure the maximum temperature level. In this paper, the fatigue-damage-index effectiveness of Q parameter was investigated, carrying out fully reversed axial fatigue tests on 4 -mm-thick AISI 304 L specimens, having 3, 1 and 0. 5 mm notch tip radii. The cooling gradients were measured by using an infrared camera, characterized by a 20 μm/pixels spatial resolution. As a result, all new fatigue data could be rationalized using the same scatter band published previously by the authors...|$|R
50|$|Great Notch {{was a small}} {{station on}} the south side of Long Hill Road (Passaic County Route 631) in Great Notch. The station dated back to 1905 as a {{transfer}} point between the New York & Greenwood Lake and its Caldwell Branch to Essex Fells, New Jersey. The station was important in its heyday, but after the opening of Montclair State University station in 2004, about a mile away, ridership at the old station, which had only 69 parking spaces, began to dwindle. By January 2008, only one train inbound to Hoboken and two trains outbound towards Hackettstown/Dover <b>stopped</b> at Great <b>Notch.</b> In August 2008, New Jersey Transit approached the community of Great Notch, part of Little Falls, saying that the 103-year-old station would be closed by October. After a few days, there was public protest against the possible closure, and on September 3, a public meeting was held to strike a deal with residents.|$|R
40|$|In {{the current}} study, an Au/BN/C {{microwave}} back-to-back Schottky device is designed and characterized. The device morphology and roughness {{were evaluated by}} means of scanning electron and atomic force microscopy. As verified by the Richardson–Schottky current conduction transport mechanism which is well fitted to the experimental data, the temperature dependence of the current-voltage characteristics of the devices {{is dominated by the}} electric field assisted thermionic emission of charge carriers over a barrier height of ~ 0. 87 [*]eV and depletion region width of ~ 1. 1 [*]μm. Both the depletion width and barrier height followed an increasing trend with increasing temperature. On the other hand, the alternating current conductivity analysis which was carried out in the frequency range of 100 – 1400 [*]MHz revealed the domination of the phonon assisted quantum mechanical tunneling (hopping) of charge carriers through correlated barriers (CBH). In addition, the impedance and power spectral studies carried out in the gigahertz-frequency domain revealed a resonance-antiresonance feature at frequency of[*] ~ 1. 6 [*]GHz. The microwave power spectra of this device revealed an ideal band <b>stop</b> filter of <b>notch</b> frequency of [*]~ 1. 6 [*]GHz.

50|$|The Soundies {{were printed}} {{backwards}} (mirror image) {{so that they}} would appear in a correct orientation when played in a Panoram machine. A Panoram {{was the size of a}} refrigerator and employed a series of mirrors to reflect the image from a projector onto a 27-inch, rear-projection, etched-glass screen in a tight, enclosed cabinet. The popular machines were first produced in 1939 by the Mills Novelty Company of Chicago, Illinois, (which also made art-deco, fancy slot machines) and found their way into countless soda shops, taverns, bus and train stations and other public places across the nation. The specially made 16mm films ran in a continuous loop and <b>stopped</b> when a <b>notch</b> cut in the film allowed a micro switch to engage a step-back relay at the end of a Soundie. The patron then put another dime in the machine to run the series of eight 2- to 3-minute films again. The Panoram mechanics were housed in an Art Deco, high quality wood cabinet, the Soundies being 3½ minute films that typically showed jazz and other musicians of the day, as well as dance troupes and other acts. With the beginning of World War II, production of the Soundies and Panoram machines was drastically reduced due to a wartime raw material shortage and the Mills Panoram's 1940 success quickly faded.|$|R
40|$|Congenital heart defects (CHD) are {{structural}} anomalies {{affecting the}} heart, {{are found in}} 1 % {{of the population and}} arise during early stages of embryo development. Without surgical and medical interventions, most of the severe CHD cases would not survive after the first year of life. The improved health care for CHD patients has increased CHD prevalence significantly, and {{it has been estimated that}} the population of adults with CHD is growing ~ 5 % per year. Understanding the causes of CHD would greatly help improve our knowledge of the pathophysiology, family counseling and planning and possibly prevention and treatment in the future. Several lines of evidence from humans and animal models have supported a substantial genetic component for CHD. However, gene discovery in CHD has been difficult due to the extreme locus heterogeneity and the lack of a distinct genotype–phenotype correlation. Currently, genetic causes are identified in fewer than 20 -­‐ 30 % of the cases, most of which are syndromic while the isolated CHD cases remain largely without explanation. The aim of my thesis was to identify novel or known CHD genes enriched for rare coding genetic variants in isolated CHD cases and learn about the relative performance of different study designs. High-throughput next generation sequencing (NGS) was used to sequence all coding genes (whole exome) coupled with various analytical pipelines and tools to identify candidate genes in different family-based study designs. Since there is no general consensus on the underlying genetic model of isolated CHD, I developed a suite of software tools to enable different family-based exome analyses of de novo and inherited variants (chapter 2) and then piloted these tools in several gene discovery projects where the mode of inheritance was already known to identify previously described and novel pathogenic genes, before applying them to an analysis of families with two or more siblings with CHD. Based on the tools developed in chapter 2, I designed a two-stage study to investigate isolated parent-offspring trios with Tetralogy of Fallot (chapter 3). In the first stage, I used whole exome sequence data from 30 trios to identify genes with de novo coding variants. This analysis identified six de novo loss-of-function and 13 de novo missense variants. Only one gene showed recurrent de novo mutations in NOTCH 1, a well known CHD gene that has mostly been associated with left ventricle outflow tract malformations (LVOT). Besides NOTCH 1, the de novo analysis identified several possibly pathogenic novel genes such as ZMYM 2 and ARHGAP 35, that harbor de novo loss-of-function variants (frameshift and stop gain, respectively). In the second stage of the study, I designed custom baits to capture 122 candidate genes for additional sequencing using NGS in a larger sample size of 250 parent-offspring trios with isolated Tetralogy of Fallot and identified six de novo variants in four genes, half of them are loss-of-function variants. Both of NOTCH 1 and its ligand JAG 1 harbor two additional de novo mutations (two <b>stop</b> gains in <b>NOTCH</b> 1 and one missense and a splice donor in JAG 1). The analysis showed a strongly significant over-representation of de novo loss-of-function variants in NOTCH 1 (P= 3. 8 × 10 - 9). Additionally, when compared with 1, 080 control trios, NOTCH 1 exhibit significant burden of inherited rare missense variant (minor allele frequency < 1 % in 1000 genomes) (Fisher exact test, P= 8. 8 × 10 ^­‐ 05) in about 10 % of the isolated Tetralogy of Fallot patients. I also modified the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) to detect any distortion of rare coding allele transmission from healthy parent to their affected children. This modified TDT test identified ARHGAP 35 gene, which exhibits an over-­‐transmission of rare missense variants in children (P= 0. 025). Although, the p value does not reach a genome-­‐wide significant level after correcting for multiple tests, ARHGAP 35 gene has also a de novo stop gain variant in one trio from the primary cohort and recently shown to play a role in cardiomyocyte fate which make it an interesting novel ToF candidate gene for future studies. To assess alternative family-based study design in CHD, I combined the analysis from 13 isolated parent-offspring trios with 112 unrelated index cases of isolated atrioventricular septal defects (AVSD) in chapter 4. Initially, I started with a case/control analysis to test the burden of rare missense variants in cases compared with 5, 194 ethnically matching controls and identified the gene NR 2 F 2 (Fisher exact test P= 7. 7 × 10 - 07, odds ratio= 54). The de novo analysis in the AVSD trios identified two de novo missense variants in the same gene. NR 2 F 2 encodes a pleiotropic developmental transcription factor, and decreased dosage of NR 2 F 2 in mice has been shown to result in abnormal development of atrioventricular septa. The results from luciferase assays show that all coding sequence variants observed in patients significantly alter the activity of NR 2 F 2 target promoters. My work has identified both known and novel CHD genes enriched for rare coding variants using next-generation sequencing data. I was able to show how using single or combined family-based study designs is an effective approach to study the genetic causes of isolated CHD subtypes. Despite the extreme heterogeneity of CHD, combining NGS data with the proper study design has proved to be an effective approach to identify novel and known CHD genes. Future studies with considerably larger sample sizes are required to yield deeper insights into the genetic causes of isolated CHD. National Guard Health Affairs, Riyadh, Saudi Arabi...|$|R
