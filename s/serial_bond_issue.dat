40|$|The optimum coupon {{schedule}} for <b>serial</b> <b>bonds</b> <b>issued</b> by municipalities has been solved as a knapsack problem, and is widely implemented in bank and nonbank underwriting firms. A large subset of issues carries the additional requirement that limits {{the number of}} distinct coupons which the underwriters may assign to the issue. The paper formulates this problem as a dynamic programming model and discusses the computational aspects relating to this formulation by comparing it with a direct 0 / 1 integer programming model. Some computational experience is also provided. ...|$|R
40|$|Most <b>serial</b> <b>bond</b> <b>issues</b> {{are sold}} {{competitively}} on an NIC (net interest cost) basis. The municipality awards {{the issue to}} the bidder submitting the lowest NIC. Although it is often acknowledged that NIC is a defective measure of the interest cost and sometimes a costly one to the issuer, an alternative measure, the TIC (true interest cost, effective interest cost, interest cost according to the Canadian method, or the {{internal rate of return}}) is often regarded as too computationally difficult to employ. State and local governments are becoming increasingly aware of the internal rate of return or TIC as a measure of interest expense. The use of TIC as a method of awarding <b>bond</b> <b>issues</b> to underwriters is growing very rapidly. This paper contains a simple computer algorithm for calculating optimal bids on a TIC basis. ...|$|R

40|$|Municipal finance {{has been}} {{characterized}} {{in the past as}} being inefficient and outdated in developing tax-free debt issues, resulting in high costs to the issuers and taxpayers. A dynamic, competitive marketing environment combined with an increased need for funds has necessitated the application of improved decision making techniques in municipal finance. This research presents a multiple-objective based decision support system designed to aid the decision maker in determining the maturity structure and coupon rate assignments for a serial revenue debt issue. ^ The multiple-objective portion of the decision support system is formulated as a goal programming (GP) model. Goals deal with total interest costs, marketability, and debt servicing. The decision support system (DSS) combines the GP model with a group of pricing and statistical models that generate the required rate of return for the issues 2 ̆ 7 various maturities along with marketability, production and revenue flow information. Output from these DSS modules is then analyzed with regard to the purchase of insurance and the use of variable-rate or fixed-rate coupons. The DSS is designed to be flexible and work in an interactive fashion with the decision maker to aid {{in the development of a}} cost-effective minimal-risk <b>serial</b> revenue <b>bond</b> <b>issue.</b> This research begins with a review of the related literature followed by a presentation of the GP model and the DSS. A bond is structured with the use of the DSS to illustrate how the system is designed to operate. ...|$|R

40|$|In a sinking-fund bond, {{the issuer}} is {{required}} to retire portions of the bond prior to maturity, with the option of doing so either by calling the bonds by lottery, or by buying them back at their market value. This paper discusses the valuation of a default-free sinking-fund <b>bond</b> <b>issue</b> in the Vasicek (1977) and, alternatively, the Cox, Ingersoll and Ross (CIR) (1985) frameworks. We show in particular that, calling the <b>bond</b> <b>issue</b> without the delivery option 'corresponding serial', and the one without the prepayment feature 'corresponding coupon', under no-arbitrage a sinking-fund bond can be priced either {{in terms of the}} corresponding coupon bond and a bond call option, or in terms of the corresponding <b>serial</b> and a <b>bond</b> put option. We also present a detailed comparative-statics analysis of our valuation model, where we show that a sinking-fund bond has a stochastic duration intermediate between the ones of the corresponding <b>serial</b> and coupon <b>bonds.</b> We argue that such a feature gives a further rational for the presence of the delivery option. Moreover, we compare our results with the ones of Ho (1985), who has previously discussed the valuation problem under scrutiny. sinking-fund bonds, delivery option, term structure models, Vasicek, CIR,...|$|R
