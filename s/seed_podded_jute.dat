50|$|The larvae {{feed on the}} <b>seed</b> <b>pods</b> of Campsis radicans. Pupation {{also takes}} place in the <b>seed</b> <b>pods.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>seed</b> <b>pods,</b> legumes, {{are light}} brown and curved, 5-10 cm long and 5-10mm wide, {{constricted}} between {{the seeds and}} breaking easily into one-seeded segments. The stalk of the <b>seed</b> <b>pod</b> is orange to red. The seeds appear black and oval shaped, up to 3.5x3.5mm in size, situated longitudinal within the <b>seed</b> <b>pod.</b>|$|R
50|$|Newly forming flowers {{will appear}} from the highly reduced {{stem from the}} center of the root mass and are {{difficult}} to distinguish from aerial roots until the flower starts to develop. When new growth is apparent after giving the plants a resting period, resume normal watering. Plants which are large and have set <b>seed</b> <b>pods</b> should be given more frequent fertilizing and should limit only a single <b>seed</b> <b>pod</b> per plant by removing all but one <b>seed</b> <b>pod</b> from a plant. When attempting to produce <b>seed</b> <b>pods</b> from one of these plants, if the plant has multiple flowers all of them should be hand pollinated with pollenaria from a different plant if available, and only one <b>seed</b> <b>pod</b> allowed to remain on each plant, since not all of the flowers may successfully take. When mature, the pod contains thousands of microscopic dust-like seeds.|$|R
40|$|Coefficient of variation, in 25 exotic lentil genotypes {{were very}} low for {{maturity}} (days) (1. 16 %), flowering (4. 36 %) and seed yield plant - 1 (10. 22 %) but high for pod plant - 1 (44. 03 %), <b>seed</b> <b>pod</b> - 1 (22. 84 %), biological yield (21. 48 %) and plant height (cm) (20. 75 %). Seed yield had significantly positive correlation with pod plant - 1, branches plant - 1, and <b>seed</b> <b>pod</b> - 1. Flowering and maturity revealed weaker but positive correlation with seed yield, while biological yield showed negative correlation with <b>seed</b> yield. <b>Pods</b> plant - 1 and <b>seed</b> <b>pod</b> - 1 {{can be used}} while selecting lentil varieties for this zone. Plant height also showed very interesting correlation: reducing plant height meant more <b>seeds</b> <b>pod</b> - 1 and biological yield. However, early maturing, shorter varieties with more number of branches plant - 1 and <b>seed</b> <b>pod</b> - 1 may be considered an index for selection in the germplasm under study for yield...|$|R
