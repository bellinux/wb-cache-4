5|$|One of {{the major}} {{applications}} of sintered silicon nitride is in automobile industry as a material for engine parts. Those include, in diesel engines, glowplugs for faster start-up; precombustion chambers (swirl chambers) for lower emissions, faster start-up and lower noise; turbocharger for reduced engine lag and emissions. In <b>spark-ignition</b> engines, silicon nitride is used for rocker arm pads for lower wear, turbocharger for lower inertia and less engine lag, and in exhaust gas control valves for increased acceleration. As examples of production levels, there is an estimated more than 300,000 sintered silicon nitride turbochargers made annually.|$|E

25|$|Conventional diesel flash points vary between 52 and 96°C, {{which makes}} it safer than petrol and {{unsuitable}} for <b>spark-ignition</b> engines. Unlike petrol, the flash point of a diesel fuel has no relation to its performance in an engine nor to its auto ignition qualities.|$|E
25|$|The {{overhead}} camshaft design adds more valvetrain components that ultimately {{result in more}} complexity and higher manufacturing costs, but this is easily offset by many advantages over the older design: multi-valve design, higher RPM limit, and design freedom to better place valves, spark plugs (<b>Spark-ignition</b> engine), and intake/exhaust ports.|$|E
25|$|Ricardo {{worked on}} <b>spark-ignition</b> engines {{throughout}} his career, including pioneering work on direct injection gasoline engines {{for aircraft engines}} in the 1930s, but his best-known work was {{in the development of}} high-speed diesel engines, in particular for cars. He was responsible for designing the combustion-chamber for the first diesel car engines produced in quantity for the Citroën Rosalie in the mid-thirties. Later, various versions of Ricardo's Comet pre-combustion chamber were deployed in almost all car diesel engines over six decades, up to the mid 1990s, and the Comet remains one of Ricardo's best-known personal achievements in automobile engineering.|$|E

2500|$|Single-cylinder {{development}} {{began in}} 1937 under project engineer Harry Wood using a test unit designed by Ricardo. [...] Although originally {{conceived as a}} compression ignition engine, by the time Rolls-Royce started serious development, {{in conjunction with the}} Ricardo company, the decision had been taken by the Air Ministry to revert to a more conventional <b>spark-ignition</b> layout, although still retaining fuel injection.|$|E
2500|$|There {{has been}} {{research}} into {{compression ignition engines}} and the burning of diesel heavy fuel in rotaries using spark ignition. The basic design parameters of the Wankel engine preclude obtaining a compression ratio higher than 15:1 or 17:1 in a practical engine, but attempts are continuously being made to produce a compression-ignition Wankel. The Rolls-Royce and Yanmar compression-ignition [...] approach was to use a two-stage unit, with one rotor acting as compressor, while combustion {{takes place in the}} other. Conversion of an standard 294 cc per chamber <b>spark-ignition</b> unit to use heavy fuel was described in SAE paper 930682, by L. Louthan. SAE paper 930683, by D. Eiermann, resulted in the Wankel SuperTec line of compression-ignition rotary engines.|$|E
2500|$|The tests {{demonstrated}} {{that the type of}} engine [...] "could be developed into an automotive power train for passenger vehicles and that it could produce favorable results." [...] However, progress was achieved with equal-power <b>spark-ignition</b> engines since 1977, and the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) achieved by automobiles in the U.S. did not stand still. The Stirling engine still showed a shortfall in fuel efficiency and concerns about the ability to mass-produce it. There were also two things wrong with Stirling engine power: first was the time needed to warm up (because most drivers do not like to wait to start driving), and second was the difficulty in changing the engine's speed (thus limiting flexibility when driving). A 1980 AMC Concord was also fitted with a P-40 engine and used to inform the public about the Stirling engine and the ASE program.|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} multi-cylinder 4-stroke model engines have been commercially {{available}} in a radial configuration, beginning with the Japanese O.S. Max firm's FR5-300 five-cylinder, 3.0 cu.in. (50cm3) displacement [...] "Sirius" [...] radial in 1986. The American [...] "Technopower" [...] firm had made smaller-displacement five- and seven-cylinder model radial engines as early as 1976, but the OS firm's engine was the first mass-produced radial engine design in aeromodelling history. [...] The rival Saito Seisakusho firm in Japan has since produced a similarly sized five-cylinder radial four-stroke model engine of their own as a direct rival to the OS design, with Saito also creating a trio of three-cylinder radial engines ranging from 0.90 cu.in. (15cm3) to 4.50 cu.in. (75cm3) in displacement, also all now available in <b>spark-ignition</b> format up to 84cm3 displacement for use with gasoline. The German Seidel firm formerly made both seven- and nine-cylinder [...] "large" [...] (starting at 35cm3 displacement) radio control model radial engines, mostly for glow plug ignition, with an experimental fourteen-cylinder twin-row radial being tried out - the American Evolution firm now sells the Seidel-designed radials, with their manufacturing being done in India.|$|E
2500|$|Tractors {{and heavy}} {{equipment}} were often multifuel in the 1920s through 1940s, running <b>spark-ignition</b> and low-compression engines. Thus many farm tractors {{of the era}} could burn gasoline, alcohol, kerosene, and any light grade of fuel oil such as diesel fuel, heating oil, or tractor vaporising oil, according to whichever was most affordable in any region at any given time. On U.S. farms during this era, the name [...] "distillate" [...] often referred {{to any of the}} aforementioned light fuel oils. The engines did not start as well on distillate, so typically a small auxiliary gasoline tank was used for cold starting, and the fuel valves were adjusted several minutes later, after warm-up, to switch to distillate. Engine accessories such as vaporizers and radiator shrouds were also used, both with the aim of capturing heat, because when such an engine was run on distillate, it ran better when both it and the air it inhaled were warmer rather than at ambient temperature. Dieselization with dedicated diesel engines (high-compression with mechanical fuel injection and compression ignition) replaced such systems and made more efficient use of the diesel fuel being burned.|$|E
