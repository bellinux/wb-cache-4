The method {{is based on}} composite mechanics which is available in computer codes. It is used to simulate <b>structural</b> <b>sections</b> made from reinforced concrete which are typical in infrastructure as well as select reinforced concrete structures. The <b>structural</b> <b>sections</b> are represented {{by a number of}} layers through the thickness where different layers are used in concrete, and for the composite. The reinforced concrete structures are represented with finite elements where the element stiffness parameters are from the <b>structural</b> <b>sections</b> which are represented by composite mechanics. The load carrying capability of the structure is determined by progressive structural fractural. Results show up to 40 percent improvements for damage and for overload enhancement with relatively small laminate thickness for the <b>structural</b> <b>sections</b> and up to three times for the composite enhanced select structures (arches and domes) ...|$|R

50|$|In {{structural}} engineering, {{the plastic}} moment (Mp) is a property of a <b>structural</b> <b>section.</b> It {{is defined as}} the moment at which the entire cross section has reached its yield stress. This is theoretically the maximum bending moment that the section can resist - when this point is reached a plastic hinge is formed and any load beyond this point will result in theoretically infinite plastic deformation. In practice most materials work harden resulting in increased stiffness and moment resistance until the material fails. This is of little significance in structural mechanics as the deflection prior to this occurring is considered to be an earlier failure point in the member.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The use of {{concrete}} filling offers a practical alternative for achieving the required fire resistance in steel hollow <b>structural</b> <b>section</b> columns. However, the current prescriptive-based approach which evaluates fire resistance based on standard fire exposure {{does not account}} for realistic fire scenarios in the design {{of concrete}}-filled hollow <b>structural</b> <b>section</b> (CFHSS) columns. This article presents a methodology for evaluating the fire resistance of CFHSS columns under design fire scenarios without the need for costly computational models. The proposed approach is a derivative of the equal area concept, and evaluates the equivalent fire resistance of the column by comparing the time temperature curve of the standard fire exposure with that of the design fire exposure. The method has been validated against the results generated from finite element analysis (coupled heat transfer and strength analysis) on numerous CFHSS columns under a large number of design fires. The applicability of the approach in design situations is illustrated through a numerical example, and it is concluded that the proposed approach offers an attractive alternative for deriving equivalent fire resistance of CFHSS columns exposed to design fire scenarios.

40|$|Novelty-based {{segmentation}} {{of audio}} signals has proven good performances for {{the estimation of}} boundaries of <b>structural</b> <b>sections</b> within music pieces. However, boundaries are detected only if <b>structural</b> <b>sections</b> satisfy the condition of sufficient acoustic innerhomogeneity. While this constraint is very restrictive and not representative of all musical contents, we propose in this paper to extend the detection of acoustic novelty to transitions between homogeneous and non-homogeneous sections and vice versa. Moreover, {{the length of the}} considered sections for the boundary detection is crucial, we also introduce a multi-scale novelty approach that allows to capture boundaries between sections of different temporal scales in a same segmentation. Evaluation of the combination of these two methods proves convincing results for temporal segmentation of music pieces. Embedding the algorithm in a music structure segmentation system, we show that performances can be consistently improved for this task...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{models for}} the {{evolution}} of the Himalaya and adjacent regions have changed our understanding of how large mountain belts form. The key data that govern these models has largely been extracted from the exhumed mid-crustal core of the orogen, the Greater Himalayan sequence, and its bounding structures. Targeted mapping in the Likhu Khola region was carried out across the Greater Himalayan sequence as the initial phase of a project aimed to evaluate the viability of those models. The exhumed mid-crustal core in the study area exposes upper greenschist to upper amphibolite grade metamorphic rocks that have been pervasively deformed by ductile shearing. Mantled porphyroclasts and c, c’ and s fabrics record top-to-the-south directed shear. As with most transects across the Himalaya, metamorphic grade increases up <b>structural</b> <b>section.</b> Pressure and temperature estimates using THERMOCALC v. 3. 26 in average-PT mode with the internally consistent data set of Holland & Powell (1998) were conducted on eleven specimens at different structural positions. Temperatures increase slightly up <b>structural</b> <b>section</b> but become constant within error for the upper portion of the study area. Pressure estimates increase up <b>structural</b> <b>section</b> followed by an abrupt pressure decrease once partial-melting increases to form migmatitic rocks. This may indicate a potential tectonometamorphic discontinuity that separates two distinct domains that have different structural, thermal and metamorphic histories (e. g., Larson et al, 2010 a; Yakymchuk and Godin, 2012). In situ U-Th-Pb Monazite geochronology was utilized on six of the specimens used for P-T analyses to constrain the P-T data. Multiple domains of ages were obtained ranging from 27. 2 Ma to 15. 1 Ma and are interpreted to represent several recorded metamorphic events. These metamorphic events are best interpreted in ii conjunction with the relative concentration of trace elements present at each U-Th-Pb data point that was collected using a split stream LA-MC-ICP-MS. More specifically, certain rare earth elements provide insight into whether garnet was growing, resorbing into melt or being homogenized at high temperatures during specific U-Th-Pb age dates. The relationships between metamorphism, crustal melting, P-T conditions and monazite/garnet growth and resorption are critical to evaluating if current models proposed {{for the evolution of}} the Himalaya are applicable in east-central Nepal...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a research {{program designed to}} investigate the seismic performance of square concrete-filled tubular (CFT) columns subjected {{to a combination of}} axial load and biaxial bending moment. The square CFT columns included normal strength and high-strength concrete-filled square steel hollow <b>structural</b> <b>section</b> columns with two ratios of tube wall thickness to tube dimension. An extensive experimental program included testing twenty-four, concrete filled, square steel hollow <b>structural</b> <b>section</b> column specimens under constant axial compressive load and cyclic horizontal load with horizontal displacement control. This experimental investigation included strength capacity, ductility and flexural stiffness of CFT beam-columns for 203 x 203 x 9. 5 HSS (Class 1, compact sections) and 203 x 203 x 4. 8 (Class 4, slender sections) hollow <b>structural</b> <b>section</b> (HSS) filled with either normal strength or high strength concrete. Class 1 (compact) and Class 4 (slender) HSS CFT columns subjected to constant axial load and cyclic shear displacements exhibited excellent hysteresis behavior using either normal strength concrete or high strength concrete. No premature failure, local buckling before yielding, was observed for either Class 1 or Class 4 HSS CFT columns. The drift ratios exceeded 7 %. The moment capacities of HSS CFT columns loaded with the plane of bending across the diagonal were only slightly less than those loaded with the plane of bending parallel to the square side. This reduces the need for elaborate procedures to calculate the biaxial moment capacities at orientations between 0 and 45 °. The strength capacity of square HSS CFT columns subjected to constant axial compressive load and biaxial cyclic bending moment can be conservatively calculated by column section analysis using fully plastic behavior for both concrete and steel. Strength modification factors alpha 1 and alpha 2 accommodate confinement and seismic loading, fast concrete strain rates, effects on the CFT column sections and softening of the columns caused by large axial load. Flexural stiffness of square HSS CFT columns can be calculated using the ACI 318 - 99 flexural stiffness formula with modification to the coefficient of the flexural stiffness contributed by the concrete...|$|E
