He failed the entrance examination at France's most prominent film school, but started to write reviews for the prestigious Cahiers du cinéma where he worked for four years (1964–1967). His first article was about Truffaut’s The <b>Soft</b> <b>Skin,</b> published in July 1964.|$|E
25|$|Mustard gas did {{not need}} to be inhaled to be {{effective}} — any contact with skin was sufficient. Exposure to 0.1 ppm was enough to cause massive blisters. Higher concentrations could burn flesh to the bone. It was particularly effective against the <b>soft</b> <b>skin</b> of the eyes, nose, armpits and groin, since it dissolved in the natural moisture of those areas. Typical exposure would result in swelling of the conjunctiva and eyelids, forcing them closed and rendering the victim temporarily blind. Where it contacted the skin, moist red patches would immediately appear which after 24 hours would have formed into blisters. Other symptoms included severe headache, elevated pulse and temperature (fever), and pneumonia (from blistering in the lungs).|$|E
25|$|Bothriolepis had {{a slender}} trunk that was likely covered in <b>soft</b> <b>skin</b> with no scales or markings. The {{orientation}} {{that appears to}} have been most stable for resting was dorsal surface up, evidenced by the flat surface on the ventral side. The trunk’s outline suggests {{that there may have been}} a notochord present surrounded by a membranous sheath, however there is no direct evidence of this since the notochord is made up of soft tissue, which is not typically preserved in the fossil record. Similar to other antiarchs, the thoracic shield of Bothriolepis was attached to its heavily armored head. Its box-like body was enclosed in armor plates, providing protection from predators. Attached to the ventral surface of the trunk is a large, thin, circular plate marked by deep-lying lines and superficial ridges. This plate lies just below the opening to the cloaca.|$|E

25|$|One study {{compared}} {{patients with}} ingrown toenails to healthy controls {{and found no}} difference in the shape of toenails between those of patients and of the control group. The study suggested that treatment should not be based on the correction of a non-existent nail deformity. Ingrown toenails are caused by weight-bearing (activities such as walking, running, etc.) in patients that have too much <b>soft</b> <b>skin</b> tissue on the sides of their nail. Weight bearing causes this excessive amount of skin to bulge up along the sides of the nail. The pressure on the skin around the nail results in the tissue being damaged, resulting in swelling, redness and infection. Many treatments are directed at the nail itself and often include partial or full removal of the healthy nail. However, failure to treat the cutaneous condition can result in a return of the ingrowth and a deformity or mutilation of the nail.|$|E
25|$|Children's {{clothing}} (mikelnguut aturait) {{was made}} of <b>soft</b> <b>skin</b> of younger animals. Reindeer fawn and dog puppy skin parkas, with the fur inside, were made for babies (irniaq) and small children (mikelnguq). Puppies one and two months old were killed for the purpose. Fawn and puppy skins were turned inside out, scraped, hung out to dry, and then put away. When needed the skins were taken from storage, rubbed between the hands with a rotary motion, and chewed as necessary to soften and loosen tissue that had not previously been removed. For a sealskin parka, one skin was required for a three-year-old, two for a five- or six-year-old, and three for a child of 10 or 12 years. A small child's sealskin parka was often decorated with tassels of the same material stitched to the upper center of the back. A baby's boots were always made with the fur inside but otherwise were similar in construction to adult boots. In former times, babies wore long boots and no pants. When a child was toilet trained, pants separate from boots were put on a boy, while girls were given trouser-boots like those worn by women.|$|E
25|$|On 22 June 1944, the Red Army {{launched}} Operation Bagration. The Schlachtgeschwader were a {{vital part}} of German defences. The fluid situation on the ground meant units retreated rapidly westward. Fw 190 units that employed the aircraft as jabo, became the first line of defence as German ground defences broke down. The Fw 190 Gruppen sent a few aircraft out over pre-assigned areas each morning. They were able to identify any movements made by the enemy. The Fw 190s were sent out after enemy armour spearheads that were roaming in the German rear. Usually 250 or 500kg (550 and 1,100lb) bombs were used along with SD-2, 4 and 10 bombs and 13 and 20mm armaments for soft targets. If the Soviet tanks were operating without resistance, then the targets were the <b>soft</b> <b>skin</b> supporting vehicles. Eliminating them would deny fuel and ammunition to the armour, cutting short the Soviets' advance. If the tanks were engaged with German armour, the tanks themselves would be the target to support the defence. The usual approach was made at 1,600 m (6,000ft), above the reach of light enemy anti-aircraft fire. The Fw 190s would then drop to 4 to 10 m, dropping their loads just as the target disappeared under the nose of the fighter. The delay charge gave the German pilots about one second to get clear. At 485 k/ph (300mph) this was usually enough. In the battles that followed, it was not uncommon for German Schlachtgeschwader pilots to fly seven or eight sorties a day. Towards the end of August fuel shortages kept the German fighters units on the ground. To save fuel, animals, such as oxen were used to carry fighters from dispersal to the take off point. Pilots were ordered to shut down the engine immediately on landing. The Oberkommando der Luftwaffe (OKL – German Air Force High Command) managed to scrape fuel together while the battles lasted, allowing some units to fly five sorties per day.|$|E

500|$|In their 2000 {{review article}} [...] "The global decline of reptiles, deja vu amphibians", Gibbons and colleagues argue {{that while the}} general public is more {{sympathetic}} to amphibians (perhaps because of their <b>soft</b> <b>skin),</b> reptile species are actually more endangered. Although populations can decline from natural causes, {{and it is difficult}} to prove the exact reason for a specific reptile's decline, human actions are behind most of the species' problems. Gibbons et al. describe six causes of reptile reductions, incidentally furnishing several examples of state reptile species impacted.|$|E

500|$|Murray cod have <b>soft</b> <b>skin</b> {{and very}} fine scales that leave them {{vulnerable}} to infection from exotic disease organisms. The following exotic disease organisms all seriously affect wild Murray cod; {{all have been}} introduced by imports of exotic fish. Chilodenella is a single-celled, parasitic protozoa that infects the skin of Murray cod and has caused a number of serious kills of wild Murray cod. Saprolegnia is a fungus-like oomycete or [...] "water mould" [...] that frequently infects Murray cod eggs and the skin of Murray cod that have been roughly handled through poor catch and release technique. (It is essential that Murray cod intended for release only touch cool wet surfaces and are not put down on any hard, dry, rough or hot surfaces, e.g. boat gunwales, boat floors, dry grass, dry rocks, gravel banks, dry towels or mats, etc. Hands should also be wetted before touching them. They must not be hung vertically by the mouth or gill covers.) Wild Murray cod populations across their range suffer extremely severe infestations of Lernaea or [...] "anchor worm", a parasitic copepod vectored by introduced carp and that burrows into the skin of Murray cod. Lernaea puncture wounds are often secondarily infected by bacteria. Severe Lernaea infestations probably causes the death of many more adult Murray cod than commonly recognised. Ebner reports a young adult Murray cod seemingly killed by severe Lernaea infestation.|$|E

2500|$|A disease {{known as}} fibropapillomatosis {{manifests itself in}} turtles through {{external}} tumors. [...] These tumors often grow to be so large that they hinder a sea turtle’s ability to see, eat, and swim, therefore rendering the sea turtle unable to survive. [...] Inexplicably, {{the majority of the}} cases of fibropapillomatosis have been diagnosed in the green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas) while none have been in the leatherback sea turtle (Dermochelys coriacea). [...] Cases of this disease have been found in all major oceans. [...] Although the causes of this disease are not clear, many believe the source to be viral. [...] These tumors are either smooth or contain pointed projections and they are red, pink, grey, black, or purple in color. These tumors are usually located anywhere on the <b>soft</b> <b>skin</b> tissue of the sea turtle, either the neck, eyes, or bottom of the flippers and range in size anywhere from a pea to a grapefruit.|$|E

40|$|Spotted Wing Drosophila (SWD),Drosophila suzukii, an {{invasive}} {{fruit fly}} originally from Asia, appeared in NY in 2011 {{and has become}} of major concern to small fruit growers. Unlike other fruit flies, it has a serrated ovipositor that allows it to penetrate intact fruit and lay eggs often just prior to harvest. The larvae will hatch and develop within the fruit with no initial external damage to the fruit. Current pesticide control measures target the adult but there is great risk of developing resistance; resistance has already been reported on the West Coast. Known hosts of SWD include <b>soft</b> <b>skinned</b> fruit like raspberries, cherries, blueberries, peaches and strawberries.
