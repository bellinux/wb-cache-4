40|$|Eggs {{and small}} to {{medium-sized}} larvae of beet armyworm are exploited by {{a complex of}} natural enemies in hay alfalfa fields in northern California. Field studies at Davis (Yolo Co.) during 2004 revealed that predation on sentinel egg masses ranged from 50 - 90 %. The egg-predators included minute pirate bug, damsel bug, lygus bugs, big-eyed bugs, green-lacewing larvae, <b>soft-winged</b> <b>flower</b> <b>beetle</b> and convergent ladybird beetle. Three parasites were reared from larvae at Davis from 1999 - 2004; total parasitization ranged from 25 - 60 %. A few larvae were infected with a nuclear polyhedrosis virus (NPV); however, no epizootic occurred from 1999 - 2004. These results suggest that natural enemies, primarily generalist predators, are largely responsible for maintaining beet-armyworm populations at relatively low levels in non-treated alfalfa fields in the region...|$|E
40|$|Coccinellid {{communities}} across North America have experienced {{significant changes in}} recent decades, with declines in several native species reported. One potential mechanism for these declines is interference competition via intraguild predation; specifically, increased predation of native coccinellid eggs and larvae following the introduction of exotic coccinellids. Our previous {{studies have shown that}} agricultural fields in Michigan support a higher diversity and abundance of exotic coccinellids than similar fields in Iowa, and that the landscape surrounding agricultural fields across the north central U. S. influences the abundance and activity of coccinellid species. The goal {{of this study was to}} quantify the amount of egg predation experienced by a native coccinellid within Michigan and Iowa soybean fields and explore the influence of local and large-scale landscape structure. Using the native lady beetle Coleomegilla maculata as a model, we found that sentinel egg masses were subject to intense predation within both Michigan and Iowa soybean fields, with 60. 7 % of egg masses attacked and 43. 0 % of available eggs consumed within 48 h. In Michigan, the exotic coccinellids Coccinella septempunctata and Harmonia axyridis were the most abundant predators found in soybean fields whereas in Iowa, native species including C. maculata, Hippodamia parenthesis and the <b>soft-winged</b> <b>flower</b> <b>beetle</b> Collops nigriceps dominated the predator community. Predator abundance was greater in soybean fields within diverse landscapes, yet variation in predator numbers did not influence the intensity of egg predation observed. In contrast, the strongest predictor of native coccinelli...|$|E

40|$|Introduction The Quail Ridge Reserve {{is part of}} the University of California Natural Reserve System and {{is located}} in Napa County on a {{peninsula}} {{at the southern end of}} Lake Berryessa. The reserve is composed of land owned by the US Bureau of Land Management, US Bureau of Reclamation, Quail Ridge Wilderness Conservation, California Department of Fish and Game, and UC Regents. The University NRS continues to expand on the reserve as private property owners become willing to sell parcels, thereby increasing the size of this amazing protected wildlife and ecological study site. Vegetation on Quail Ridge consists primarily of mixed oak woodland, riparian, native and non-native grasslands, and chamise chaparral. The illustrated beetles and species and family list in this book are the product of a beetle survey conducted on the reserve. Beetles were collected by black light at the reserve field station and in Decker Canyon, on flowering vegetation, under logs and other harborage, and along roadsides during daytime and evening hours and reared from logs.

5000|$|Eudicella gralli, {{sometimes}} called the flamboyant <b>flower</b> <b>beetle</b> or striped love beetle, is a brightly coloured member of the scarab beetle family, in the subfamily known as <b>flower</b> <b>beetles.</b> Their shells {{seem to have a}} prismatic quality, refracting the ambient light to give the green of their carapace a rainbow tint. This species of <b>flower</b> <b>beetle</b> lives in the rainforests of Africa, where it feeds on the nectar and pollen of flowers, but is popular in the exotic pet trade. The larvae of the <b>flower</b> <b>beetle</b> live in decaying wood, feeding on dead wood and leaf litter. Adults reach lengths of 25 - 40 mm. As in other species of this genus, the males have a [...] "Y"-shaped horn, used to fight over females. The females have a shovel-like tusk, used for burrowing in wood. During their gestation period they will dig into the wood and lay eggs.|$|R
