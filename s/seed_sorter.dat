40|$|Seed radiographs {{are divided}} into density zones which are related to seed germination. The seeds which {{germinate}} have densities relating to false-color red. In turn, a <b>seed</b> <b>sorter</b> may be designed which rejects those seeds not having sufficient red to activate a gate along a moving belt containing the seed source. This results in separating only seeds with the preselected densities representing biological viability lending to germination. These selected seeds demand a higher market value. Actual false-coloring isn't required for a computer to distinguish the significant gray-zone range. This range can be predetermined and screened without the necessity of red imaging. Applying false-color enhancement {{is a means of}} emphasizing differences in densities of gray within any subject from photographic, radiographic, or video imaging. Within the 0 - 255 range of gray levels, colors can be assigned to any single level or group of gray levels. Densitometric values then become easily recognized colors which relate to the image density. Choosing a color to identify any given density allows separation by morphology or composition (form or function). Additionally, relative areas of each color are readily available for determining distribution of that density by comparison with other densities within the image...|$|E
40|$|Simple, swift, and {{comparatively}} inexpensive, a color-image-based <b>seed</b> <b>sorter</b> {{is helping}} plant breeders and others separate the seeds {{they want from}} those they don’t—with an impressive degree of accuracy. Agricultural Research Service agricultural engineer Thomas C. Pearson, based at the agency’s Center for Grain and Animal Health Research in Manhattan, Kansas, developed the sorter in collaboration with National Manufacturing in Lincoln, Nebraska. The company has marketed the device to customers in the United States and abroad since 2010. In tests, the compact, portable sorter— a simpler and faster version of other machine-vision equipment that Pearson developed in 2009 —speedily differentiated kernels of hard red wheat from kernels of hard white winter wheat with 98. 6 percent accuracy. Says Pearson, “Breeders cross red and white varieties of these bread-making wheats to transfer desirable traits from one to another. Test fields are planted with both hard red and hard white wheat. At harvest, the seeds have to be separated. ” The sorter is also skilled at separating yellow from brown flax and barley from durum wheat. Pearson explains that yellow flax is used somewhat like sesame seeds as a tasty, nut-flavored garnish for breads and other baked goods, while brown flax is harvested for its oil. The sorter was accurate 94 {{percent of the time}} in detecting yellow flax seeds from brown ones in Pearson’s tests. Barley plants can sometimes turn up as unwanted “rogues” or “volunteers” in neighboring test rows of candidate durum wheats. The sorter system detected durum kernels with 93 percent accuracy, Pearson reports...|$|E
