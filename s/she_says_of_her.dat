50|$|She {{researches}} {{her subjects}} prior to interview {{but she does}} not prepare a list of questions because she feels this is demeaning. She does not like to be interviewed herself, but it allows her to understand those she interviews.

The interviews last from between two and three hours before they are edited down. <b>She</b> <b>says</b> every person has his/her unique story even interviewing the same person twice will yield different results. For this reason, <b>she</b> <b>says</b> that <b>she</b> is still nervous before each interview she does, worried that she might not get all of the most important information. <b>She</b> <b>says</b> all <b>of</b> <b>her</b> interviewees have impressed her, with no one person standing out.|$|R

50|$|Garrison {{asserts that}} her then-husband beat and emotionally bullied their children. “I started seeing my kids {{completely}} break down.

I paint what makes me happy. These fleeting moments are so precious- perhaps painting is a way of capturing them. Perhaps I also paint to compensate for a feeling of loss- the loss of innocence, the loss of childhood, and the increasing loss of our beautiful English countryside".|$|E

Her favourite review classed her as [...] "Jane Austen in Modern Dress." [...] Her sales of 90,000 with Mrs Fytton's Country Life (2000) doubled her previous record. <b>She</b> <b>says</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> writing (2012) that she is one {{in a line of}} feminist, subversive women authors - with jokes.

5000|$|At age three, Olsen {{was adopted}} by a foster family that had cared for her since shortly after her birth. The {{difference}} in years {{between her and her}} parents left an impression. [...] "Because there are so many decades of difference between us, I became more interested in what their childhood was like," [...] <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> parents, both of whom still live in St. Louis.

[...] Despite early adolescent aspirations to be a [...] "pop star", her interests later shifted in high school. Olsen became more introverted, regularly attending punk rock and noise music shows at the Lemp Neighborhood Arts Center as well as Christian rock shows throughout the city. She began learning the piano and guitar and writing her own music. Two years after graduating from Tower Grove Christian High School, Olsen moved to Chicago.|$|E
5000|$|Drewchin jumps {{first to}} her childhood, {{growing up on}} a rural farm in New York state (“Like, ten miles away from a store where you could buy milk”) where she was homeschooled by her English mother. She started playing violin {{at the age of}} three, the influence, <b>she</b> <b>says,</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> Russian artist dad “holding the hammer above my head." [...] This “educational experiment” turned her into a “tangly-haired barefoot little freak,” at home with her three {{brothers}} and their chicken and sheep, but ill-prepared for the pressures of public school, which she was forced to attend as of her sophomore year of high school. Her parents split, and her mother sold their farm. “That was my first year in school ever,” she explains. “with the over-sensory input… I was like ‘What?‘” Soon she found herself picking up on her abandoned impulses toward music-making as a sort of “self-prescribed anxiety medication.” She pauses, looks down at the table, and grins, cognizant of the cliché that’s coming. “Music saved me,” she says.|$|E

To test it, he sings [...] "Young and Beautiful" [...] to Peggy, which reassures him that his fears are unfounded.|$|R

60|$|Still, {{it would}} be ungenerous not to {{recognise}} that Mary Carpenter gave {{to the children of}} the poor not merely her learning, but her love. In early life, her biographer tells us, she had longed for the happiness of being a wife and a mother; but later she became content that her affection could be freely given to all who needed it, and the verse in the prophecies, 'I have given thee children whom thou hast not borne,' seemed to her to indicate what was to be her true mission. Indeed, she rather inclined to Bacon's opinion, that unmarried people do the best public work. 'It is quite striking,' <b>she</b> <b>says</b> in one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> letters, 'to observe how much the useful power and influence of woman has developed of late years. Unattached ladies, such as widows and unmarried women, have quite ample work to do in the world for the good of others to absorb all their powers. Wives and mothers have a very noble work given them by God, and want no more.' The whole passage is extremely interesting, and the phrase 'unattached ladies' is quite delightful, and reminds one of Charles Lamb.|$|R
