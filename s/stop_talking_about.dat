5|$|Angel {{finds that}} he cannot <b>stop</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> his divorce {{when trying to}} meet new women at a bar. After he meets a woman {{recovering}} from her own divorce, he has to leave her {{to speak to a}} prostitute whom he sees across the room with a prosthetic hand and fingernails painted {{in the same way as}} the Ice Truck Killer's first victim. Working on a hunch that the Ice Truck Killer is an acrotomophiliac, Angel decides to speak to Debra's boyfriend, Rudy Cooper, a prosthetics specialist and (unbeknownst to anyone else) the actual Ice Truck Killer. Rudy cooperates with the interview upon realizing that Angel does not know his identity. Later, Angel is stabbed in a parking lot by a masked man. Angel manages to elbow him in the face before two men scare the attacker off. Minutes later, Rudy - who had earlier fallen out with Debra due to secretly having dinner with Dexter - arrives with flowers. They kiss, but Rudy backs away complaining of a cut lip, suggesting that he was Angel's attacker.|$|E

The repeating guitar riff and Burdon's screaming vocals did seem to ensure that of all the bands a crowd might see, the Animals were the group that people couldn't <b>stop</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> and the song the one they couldn't get out of their heads.|$|E
25|$|The {{expansion}} of St. Peter's led to federal {{approval for a}} post office at the mission in 1885. After arriving in Montana, Mother Amadeus asked Bishop Brondel to give her control over the Ursulines, but he declined to do so. Amadeus repeatedly asked Mother Stanislaus, head of the Toledo chapterhouse (and who exercised authority over the Ursulines at St. Peter's), for more sisters {{to help with the}} work in Montana. Her requests were denied. She appealed to Richard Gilmour, Bishop of Cleveland, Ohio. When Mother Stanislaus complained, Mother Amadeus denied she was making an end-run around the chapterhouse, claiming instead that she was acting under instruction from Bishop Brondel. In February 1886, Bishop Gilmour ordered the Ursulines in Toledo to <b>stop</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> how much they wished to teach in Montana, and ordered the St. Peter's Ursulines separated from the Toledo chapter.|$|E

Take 40 Australia elaborated on the audience's {{reception at the}} July 2011 Splendour in the Grass festival, [...] "Gotye's latest song featuring Kimbra 'Somebody That I Used To Know' had become somewhat of an unofficial anthem for the festival... every car was cranking it over their speakers all day, every day... and the question on everyone's lips was whether or not Kimbra would join him on the track. Fortunately, dreams came true... he smashed out an incredible set climaxing with {{a version of the}} song with Kimbra on co-lead vocals that people couldn't <b>stop</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> all weekend long". Allmusic's Jon O'Brien felt the track was an [...] "unexpected chart-topper... is an oddball break-up song whose stuttering rhythms, reggae hooks, and hushed vocals sound like The Police as remixed by the XX".|$|E
500|$|The Crusaders' {{winning run}} {{finally came to}} an end when they were beaten 39–5 by the Blues in the third round of the 2003 Super 12 season. Although their 15-match unbeaten streak had ended, Richie McCaw said of the loss, [...] "...in some ways it was almost a relief. We'd finally been beaten, the run was over, so people could <b>stop</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> it and we could get on with playing it week by week." [...] The Crusaders {{recovered}} to finish second on the table with eight wins. They hosted a semi-final against the Hurricanes, who were coached by Colin Cooper, a former assistant coach for the Crusaders. Despite this inside knowledge of the team by the Wellington coach, the Crusaders won the match 39–16. In the final, the Crusaders met the Blues, another team coached by a former Crusaders assistant coach, Peter Sloane. Hooker Mark Hammett scored two tries to give the Crusaders a 10–6 lead at half-time. The Blues hit back to lead 21–10 with ten minutes to go. The Crusaders managed another converted try, but it was not enough, and the Blues won 21–17.|$|E

2500|$|Idle's work in Python {{is often}} characterised by an {{obsession}} with language and communication: many of his characters have verbal peculiarities, such {{as the man who}} speaks in anagrams, the man who says words in the wrong order, and the butcher who alternates between rudeness and politeness every time he speaks. A number of his sketches involve extended monologues (for example the customer in the [...] "Travel Agency" [...] sketch who won't <b>stop</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> his unpleasant experiences with holidays), and he would frequently spoof the unnatural language and speech patterns of television presenters.

5000|$|The Kingdom of Bahrain (173rd) plunged 29 {{places to}} become one of the world's 10 most repressive countries. Bahraini and foreign journalists were {{systematically}} hounded from February onwards. An entire arsenal of measures were taken to prevent information circulating about the evolving situation in the country. At the same time, the authorities made extensive use of the media to put out pro-government propaganda. The creation of an independent commission of enquiry did not end the abuses against journalists.

5000|$|Fauset was {{admired by}} many {{literary}} intellectuals during the 1920s. Her first novel, There is Confusion, was applauded by Alain Locke in the 1924 February {{issue of the}} Crisis. Locke felt the novel would “mark an epoch” [...] because he believed it was educated literary material that the educated reader anticipated as it shined light on a higher class of black people rather than the usual “servant” type of character that was portrayed in past literature. In the 1924 June academic journal “Opportunity”, Howard University professor Montgomery Gregory gave praise to Fauset’s work because he felt she made clear of the “better elements” of African American life “to those who know us only as domestic servants, ‘uncles’, or criminals”. Although Fauset received many positive reviews on her literary work in the 1920s, she also faced negative feedback as well. Her new literary perspective was not received with open arms by everyone because it went against the stereotypical image white Americans made of middle class African Americans. The first publisher ever to see the There is Confusion manuscript rejected it saying, “white readers just don’t expect negroes to be like this”. Despite the mixed discussion on Fauset’s work in the 1920s, by the 1930s people <b>stopped</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> her and she became a forgotten writer. Locke felt that the reason people <b>stopped</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> Fauset was due {{to a change in}} the literary scene because of the Great Depression and Second World War.|$|R
2500|$|In February 2005, {{during an}} away match with Real Zaragoza, Eto'o {{was the subject}} of racist taunts by Zaragoza supporters, who began making monkey-like chants onto the pitch {{whenever}} he had possession of the ball. Referee Fernando Carmona Méndez, however, made no mention of the incidents in his match report, commenting only that the behavior of the crowd was [...] "normal"; two of the abusers were caught and given five-month sporting-event bans after being identified to police by other spectators. Eto'o later declared that the punishment was insufficient and that La Romareda should have been closed for at least one year, but his manager Frank Rijkaard, also of African origin, told him to concentrate on football and <b>stop</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the incident. Infuriated again by Zaragoza fans' racist chants the following season, however, Eto'o attempted to walk off the pitch in protest. His teammates intervened and convinced him to continue playing.|$|E

2500|$|In {{one popular}} {{interpretation}} of stage theory, {{each of the}} so-called levels of existence envelops those below it: an ethical person is still capable of aesthetic enjoyment, for example, and a religious person is still capable of aesthetic enjoyment and ethical duty. The difference between these ways of living are internal, not external, and thus there are no external signs one can point to determine at what level a person is living. This inner and outer relationship is commonly determined by an individual by looking to others to gauge one's action, Kierkegaard believed one should look to oneself and in that relationship look to Christ as the example instead of looking at others because the more you look at others the less you see of yourself. This {{makes it easier to}} degrade your neighbor instead of loving your neighbor. But one must love the person one sees not the person one wishes to see.

While it never expressly declared that arbitration of discrimination claims or consumer fraud claims fit within a contractarian model, as a practical matter, those claims were governed by the same rules that governed traditionally contractarian matters such as labor and commercial disputes. Most notably from my perspective, they all received the same extremely deferential standard of judicial review...|$|R

Later, after his relationship with Lulu had become public knowledge, he said: [...] "Lulu and I met on the Top of the Pops TV show three months ago, and then at the Saville Theatre in London last month". Later in 1968, Lulu was seen out on the town with Davy Jones of The Monkees, Jones was also a friend of Maurice's. As Gibb recalled, [...] "Davy Jones was a good friend of mine, I broke it off with Lulu over the phone and Davy called me up and said 'I am going to ask Lu to dinner with some friends, is that all right?' I said, 'Yes, I am not going out with her anymore, have a ball' and threw the phone down. They then took so many photos of them and made it look like a six-month romance, but she had only been out with him that one night, she did not even want to go out. She phoned me the next day and she was crying, saying she was sorry". Maurice later regretted not accepting her apology, [...] "We just grew up, that's all," [...] Maurice admitted. [...] "We were miserable apart and when we started going out again, it got so that I didn't want to be with anyone. I used to phone her up from Los Angeles about twice a day. Then she'd call me back.
