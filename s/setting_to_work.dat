60|$|CAPTAIN SHOTOVER [promptly {{taking his}} chair and <b>setting</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> at the drawing-board]. No. Go to bed. Good-night.|$|E
60|$|<b>Setting</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with a {{fork and}} shovel, they {{presently}} unearthed a rusty iron object which Stanton picked up.|$|E
6000|$|... "Play, my lad; {{that was}} only play--just to bring our hands in, before <b>setting</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> in earnest! What {{do you think of}} the health of the men, Doctor?" ...|$|E
50|$|The able-bodied poor were <b>to</b> be <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> in a House of Industry. Materials {{were to be}} {{provided}} for the poor <b>to</b> be <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b>|$|R
60|$|Two long days' marches {{took them}} {{deep into the}} woods lying north of Tlatlanquitepec. Here they <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> {{construct}} a rough hut of boughs, near a mountain spring; and when this was completed, they <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> hunting.|$|R
60|$|Three {{or four of}} the {{settlers}} at once volunteered <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> dig a grave.|$|R
6000|$|Before <b>setting</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> Dias {{passed his}} torch over the stone. Presently he stopped. [...] "Will you light {{two of the}} candles, señor; the torch {{flickers}} too much to see very plainly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, lads," [...] cried Cameron, <b>setting</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with a {{large wooden}} shovel, [...] "work like niggers. If there's any life left in the horse it'll soon be smothered out unless we set him free." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come along!" [...] cried Cary to the malcontents; [...] "we're raw {{longshore}} fellows, but we won't {{be outdone}} by any old sea-dog of them all." [...] And <b>setting</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> himself, {{he was soon}} followed by one and another, till order and work went on well enough.|$|E
60|$|Abe's {{plan was}} agreed to, {{and all the}} men <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> {{construct}} the dam, cradle, and shoot.|$|R
60|$|No {{answer came}} back, indeed, {{it was not}} to be expected. Kneeling over his parent, Dick <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> {{resuscitate}} the almost drowned man.|$|R
60|$|I {{immediately}} <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> {{complete it}} {{according to my}} original purpose.|$|R
60|$|Sailor-fashion, {{he had no}} armor on but a light morion and a cuirass, so he was not {{too much}} {{encumbered}} to prevent his springing to his legs instantly, and <b>setting</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> cutting and foining right and left at every sound, for sight there was none.|$|E
6000|$|... "T'other 'un next," [...] he said, <b>setting</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> on the {{remaining}} skate. When it was off, {{he looked up at}} her, and she darted a glance at him as she rose which showed that his compliment (her feet were, in fact, small and pretty) was appreciated.|$|E
6000|$|MORELL. That's a {{question}} for the Church, not for the laity. Has it done you any harm, that's the question for you, eh? Of course, it hasn't. Think no more of it. (He dismisses the subject by going to his place at the table and <b>setting</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> at his correspondence.) ...|$|E
60|$|Ralph smiled, and his hostess <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> {{carry out}} her instructions.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, there can't {{be more to}} do now," [...] Jack said, {{when the}} order was carried out, [...] "unless we <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> them all again." ...|$|R
60|$|So it {{was decided}} to lose no time, and Chet at once <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> prepare dinner and also some food to be carried along.|$|R
60|$|Although the <b>setting</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> of {{the hand}} looms and {{spindles}} relieved the dire pressure of want immediately about Marsden, in other parts things were worse than ever that winter, and the military were kept busy by the many threatening letters which were received by the mill owners from King Lud.|$|E
6000|$|MORELL (with a laugh {{which is}} half a sob). I suppose not. I beg all your pardons: I was not {{conscious}} {{of making a}} fuss. (Pulling himself together.) Well, well, well, well, well! (He {{goes back to his}} place at the table, <b>setting</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> at his papers again with resolute cheerfulness.) ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{epitome of}} the whole is this:--1. If you can only answer the {{question}} A, you must seek for the lost path by the tedious circle plan; or, what is the same, and a more manageable way of <b>setting</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> by travelling in an octagon, each side of which must be equal to four-fifths of P D. (See fig. 2.) ...|$|E
60|$|At length, Jonas {{urged the}} {{necessity}} for a halt, for rest and food. They chose a spot {{at the foot of}} a great tree, and then <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> collect a store of firewood. John took out the box of tinder which, in those days, everyone carried about with him, and a fire was soon lighted. Jonas then looked for two large flat stones, and <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> grind some grain.|$|R
60|$|So saying, {{they all}} <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> rolling snow-balls <b>to</b> make him.|$|R
60|$|The {{hands were}} now <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> {{shifting}} the kegs further aft.|$|R
60|$|All {{was quiet}} at the flat, and <b>setting</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> {{on the table}} with glue and stout cord, he soon had it on its legs. Looking down upon it as a {{completed}} job, he marveled at the reverence which his mother seemed to have for it, and his mind reverted to the astounding phenomena which he himself had witnessed over its top.|$|E
60|$|One day, {{shortly after}} their arrival at Butabué, John Creedy began talking in English to the catechist {{about the best}} way of <b>setting</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> to learn the native language. He had left the country when he was nine years old, he said, and had {{forgotten}} all about it. The catechist answered him quickly in a Fantee phrase. John Creedy looked amazed and started.|$|E
60|$|Day {{after day}} they moved on, {{and every day}} the poor {{merchant}} felt more ill and miserable. He wondered what kind of death the king would invent for him, and went through almost as much torture, as he lay awake nearly the whole of every night thinking over the situation, {{as he would have}} suffered if the king's executioners were already <b>setting</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> upon his neck.|$|E
60|$|And the two {{old ladies}} <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> a good dish of scandal.|$|R
60|$|They went <b>to</b> <b>work</b> {{that night}} {{transferring}} the stock from the wagon {{to the store}} shelves, and when this was finished both <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> wash and dress the show window.|$|R
60|$|Upon the {{following}} morning Nigel Graheme told his visitors that he had determined to accept their offer, and would at once <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> raise a company.|$|R
60|$|He {{was awakened}} by a pebble tossed upon him, and when he arose, stiff and sore, but feeling {{stronger}} and in better temper, the sun was wearing low. <b>Setting</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> at his task, he threw the loose rock out of a hollow in the ledge near by, and to this rude sepulchre Wetherford dragged the dead man, refusing all aid, and there piled a cairn of rocks above his grave.|$|E
60|$|He lost {{no time in}} <b>setting</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> and {{everyone}} rejoiced at having him in the kitchen, for the duke was not a patient man, and had been known to throw plates and dishes at his cooks and servants if the things served were not quite to his taste. Now all was changed. He never even grumbled at anything, had five meals instead of three, thought everything delicious, and grew fatter daily.|$|E
60|$|The {{storm was}} now breaking. Glimpses of blue sky were visible overhead, {{and the wind}} had greatly abated. The sea upon the reef was, however, as high as ever. <b>Setting</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> they hauled {{a large number of}} boxes and bales {{beyond the reach of the}} waves. One of the casks {{contained}} biscuits and, knocking in the head, they helped themselves to its contents, and sat down to talk over their position.|$|E
60|$|Accordingly, {{the next}} morning the two Grimstones went up country and <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b>|$|R
60|$|The lad easily evaded the shot, {{being well}} {{accustomed}} to elude much more deadly missiles, and, {{picking up the}} towel, quietly <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> perform the duty in dispute.|$|R
60|$|Carroll {{laid the}} message on a smooth stone and <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with a pencil.|$|R
