After ten minutes of trying, Leonard finally gets in the queue but is 15,211th in line. Tickets run out and the four men are {{disappointed}} {{that they will not}} be able to attend, especially as they had spent <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>on</b> their costumes, intending to go as different versions of the Hulk as portrayed by Lou Ferrigno, Eric Bana, Edward Norton, and Mark Ruffalo.|$|E

500|$|The Second Test in Cape Town saw an Australian victory, {{the first}} in Davidson's 14 Tests. He took 2/31 and 2/18 as South Africa lost by an innings after being forced to follow on. It was during this match that Davidson earned his famous {{reputation}} for injury complaints, something that became {{a constant source of}} humour; he spent <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>on</b> the massage table that his teammates attached a plaque that read [...] "The AK Davidson Autograph Treatment Table". Benaud reported that Davidson persistently complained to captain Craig about an injury before delivering the next ball with high pace and swing.|$|E

Out of rage, Dick would abandon the Justice League citing them to not get {{involved}} in his personal life after spending <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> working <b>on</b> their own lives. Dick then apprehends Oberon Sexton, whom he reveals to be the Joker, assassinating members of the Black Glove and finds out that Professor Pyg's virus is being carried as a Trojan Virus.|$|R

500|$|Kapoor next {{appeared}} in his father's directorial Mausam (2011); co-starring Sonam Kapoor, the star-crossed romance set over a decade, took two years to complete. Considering the film to be his [...] "dream project", Kapoor did not take on additional work while filming for it. For his role as an unambitious village boy who becomes an air force pilot, Kapoor trained to fly the F-16 Fighting Falcon. Rajeev Masand reviewed that [...] "while he doesn’t quite cut it as a convincing IAF pilot, Shahid Kapoor is terrific as the small-town brat". The film was a box office flop and Kapoor was later regretful for spending <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>on</b> the project.|$|E
500|$|Although Lang {{considered}} himself forward-thinking, he joined and became {{secretary of the}} Canning Club, the university's principal Conservative society. His contemporary Robert Cecil recorded that Lang's [...] "progressive" [...] opinions were somewhat frowned upon by traditional Tories, who nevertheless respected his ability. Lang later assisted in {{the founding of the}} University settlement of Toynbee Hall, a mission to help the poor in the East End of London. He had been first drawn to this work in 1883, after listening to a sermon in St Mary's Church, Oxford, by Samuel Augustus Barnett, Vicar of St Jude's, Whitechapel. Barnett became the settlement's first leader, while Lang became one of its first undergraduate secretaries. He spent <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>on</b> these duties that he was chided by the Master of Balliol, Benjamin Jowett, for neglecting his studies. In 1886 Lang graduated with first-class honours in History; in October he failed to secure a Fellowship of All Souls College, blaming his poor early scholastic training in Glasgow.|$|E

5000|$|Tchaikovsky {{wrote about}} him affectionately {{in his letters}} to his brother Modest, in terms such as: Since the time of Kotek I have never loved anyone so warmly as him. [...] Because they spent <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> {{together}} <b>on</b> these tours, it is often asserted that he and Tchaikovsky were lovers. However, Alexander Poznansky, in Tchaikovsky: The Quest for the Inner Man, writes: As {{in the case of}} Brandukov, it seems likely that an erotic element was present in Tchaikovsky's friendship with Sapelnikov and that he recognised it as such. Both men were quite young and good-looking. Almost certainly, however, their relations remained chaste.|$|R
40|$|We {{implemented}} Boehm-Turner’s {{model of}} agile and plan-based software development. That tool is augmented with an AI search engine {{to find the}} key factors that predict {{for the success of}} agile or traditional plan-based software developments. According to our simulations and AI search engine: (1) in no case did agile methods perform worse than plan-based approaches; (2) in some cases, agile performed best. Hence, we recommend that the default development practice for organizations be an agile method. The simplicity of this style of analysis begs the question: why is <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> wasted <b>on</b> evidence-less debates on software process when a simple combination of simulation plus automatic search can mature the dialogue much faster? 1...|$|R

2500|$|Klass's plasma {{hypothesis}} {{was not well}} received by those {{on either side of}} the UFO debate, who noted that Klass was using one unverified phenomenon—his hypothetical plasmas— to explain another unverified phenomenon—UFOs. [...] The two engaged in a bitter, months-long debate, leveling a variety of charges and accusations at one another. Eventually, Klass wrote to McDonald's superiors at the U.S. Navy (McDonald was formally retired from the Navy, but often worked with the Office of Naval Research), questioning how McDonald could spend <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>on</b> UFO research and still fulfill the requirements for his atmospheric research grant. This did not result in McDonald losing ONR funding but did draw some criticism of Klass from members of the UFO community.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{statement}} to the Senate panel considering his nomination, Geithner called the tax issues [...] "careless", [...] "avoidable", and [...] "unintentional" [...] errors, and {{he said he wanted to}} [...] "apologize to the committee for putting you in the position of having to spend <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>on</b> these issues." [...] Geithner testified that he used TurboTax to prepare his own return and that the tax errors are his own responsibility. The Washington Post quoted a tax expert who said that TurboTax has not been programmed to handle self-employment taxes when the user identifies himself as being employed. Geithner said at the hearing that he was always under the impression that he was an employee, not a self-employed contractor, while he served as director of the Policy Development and Review Department of IMF.|$|E

5000|$|... 10. Playing The Part Beth tries out for {{the school}} play, a revised edition of Romeo & Juliet, and lands the part of Juliet. Keith is jealous that {{she will have to}} spend <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> working <b>on</b> the play, gives Beth a lot of grief, and without telling her, asks Christie out on a date. Beth is blindsided and hurt, but since they were now not really exclusive, she reluctantly gives Christie {{permission}} to date Keith, even though it makes her cry in secret. Keith has a chance to score a record related to football, but breaks his leg mid-game. When Beth visits him in the hospital, he admits he didn't realize how hard it would be for her to give up acting when he has to give up football for a while to let his leg heal. They make up.|$|R
6000|$|And to him, {{the society}} of the Goyle was a new charm. He had been brought up to the {{technicalities}} and the business relations of art, and had a cultivated taste; but to be with a thoughtful, highly educated lady, able to enter into its higher and deeper associations, was an unspeakable delight and improvement to him. Vera was fairly satisfied as long as he sketched her in various attitudes, and held her hand while he talked; though she did grudge having <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> spent <b>on</b> [...] "taste, Shakespeare and the musical glasses." [...] Paula had various ecclesiastical interests in common with him, and began to expand and enter more into realities, while Thekla had in him a dear delightful delicious brother, who petted her, bantered her, mended her rabbit hutch, caught her hedgehog, taught her to guide her bicycle, drew picture games for her, and taught her to sketch.|$|R
2500|$|Critics and {{commentators}} broadly held Frasier in high regard. Caroline Frost {{said that the}} series overall showed {{a high level of}} wit, but noted that many critics felt that the marriage of Daphne and Niles in season ten had removed much of the show's comic tension. Ken Tucker felt that their marriage made the series seem desperate for storylines, while Robert Bianco felt that it was symptomatic of a show that had begun to dip in quality after <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>on</b> the air. Kelsey Grammer acknowledged the creative lull, saying that over the course of two later seasons the show [...] "took itself too seriously". Commentators do, however, acknowledge that there was an improvement following the return of the writers Christopher Lloyd and Joe Keenan, although not necessarily to its earlier high standards.|$|E
2500|$|As an example, Geist {{cites the}} scene in which Noriko and Hattori bicycle {{together}} {{to the beach and}} have a conversation there, an incident that appears to imply a budding romantic relationship between them. When Noriko slightly later reveals to her father that Hattori, before that bicycle trip, had already been engaged to another woman, [...] "we wonder", writes Geist, [...] "why Ozu has wasted <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>on</b> the 'wrong man' [...]" [...] However, the key to the beach scene’s importance to the plot, according to Geist, is the dialogue between Hattori and Noriko, in which the latter tells him that she is [...] "the jealous type." [...] This seemingly unlikely claim, given her affable nature, is later confirmed when she becomes bitterly jealous at her father’s apparent plan to remarry. [...] "Her jealousy goads her into her own marriage and is thus the pivot on which the plot turns." ...|$|E

At least Once prepared for its off week by giving us both halves of a two-parter—a story that, {{when all is said and}} done, maybe didn't need to be told over the course of two hours, though it was nice to see the show take some time to privilege character over plot tonight. The hour also revealed the answers to a few of the season's long-simmering unsolved mysteries—including how Elsa ended up trapped within the anti-magic urn. Could this indicate the end of the Arendelle fairybacks, considering that backstory seems to be fairly complete at this point? If it does, will you miss them—or are you looking forward to the show not spending quite <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>on</b> the Frozen crew?" ...|$|E
50|$|Stories {{referring}} to bonsai {{began to appear}} more frequently by the 17th century. Shogun Tokugawa Iemitsu (r. 1623-1651) was a hachi no ki enthusiast. A story tells of Okubo Hikozemon (1560-1639), councilor to the shogun, who threw one of Iemitsu's favorite trees away in the garden—in sight of the shogun—in order to dissuade him from spending <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> and attention <b>on</b> these trees. In spite of the servant's efforts, Iemitsu never gave up his beloved art form. Another story from this time tells of a samurai's gardener who killed himself when his master insulted a hachi no ki of which the artisan was especially proud.|$|R
2500|$|The Union {{squadron}} {{captured the}} abandoned Little Rebel {{and sent her}} to Cairo, Illinois, June 11 for repairs and for adjudication before the Illinois Prize Court. Her seizure was judged to be legal, so she was purchased by the U.S. Navy from the prize court. [...] On January 9, 1863, she entered Federal service. She was first assigned to a flotilla of gunboats commanded by Lieutenant Commander LeRoy Fitch, who had to suppress guerrilla activity on the Ohio, Cumberland, and Tennessee Rivers. Her deep draft made her unsuitable for this duty, <b>so</b> she spent <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>on</b> guard duty {{in the vicinity of}} Cairo.|$|R
5000|$|While {{domestic}} {{medicine at}} its roots was meant to empower the individual, the underlying motive was profit. Take Samuel Thomason, for instance, {{the founder of the}} movement towards domestic medicine [...] Once he had obtained a patent, he spent <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> focused <b>on</b> prosecuting potential knockoffs to his patent that he opposed the democratization of the medicines that he made, <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>so</b> that he opposed the development of Thomasonian medical schools. These schools could have been advantages to Samuel Thomason as it would have increased the legitimacy of those who practiced Thomasonian medicine [...] One positive that came out of this fear of patent violation was Thomason writing The New Guide to Health, as a way to expand the popularity and use of his patent. As a man who boasted on how his medical practice could be practiced by even the illiterate, it is ironic that he chose to publish a book on the topic as it would seem that that was not his target audience. However, this publication became widely popular with 200 institutional holdings of the book and even more in private hands ...|$|R

6000|$|Halleck {{prolonged}} {{his summer}} vacation beyond {{the end of}} October. He had been in town {{from time to time}} and then had set off again on some new absence; he was so restless and so far from well during the last of these flying visits, that the old people were glad when he wrote them that he should stay as long as the fine weather continued. He spoke of an interesting man whom he had met at the mountain resort where he was staying; a Spanish-American, attached to one of the Legations at Washington, who had a scheme for Americanizing popular education in his own country. [...] "He has made a regular set at me," [...] Halleck wrote, [...] "and if I had not fooled away <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> already <b>on</b> law and on leather, I should like to fool away a little more on such a cause as this."

500|$|Even though <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> {{was spent}} <b>on</b> production, Kerry King {{said that the}} mixing and {{mastering}} should have had more attention. The songs' origins came not only from television shows, but were also inspired by various other things, including Rush Limbaugh, and serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer. In 1998 the album was banned in Germany due to the lyrics of [...] "SS-3", [...] "Circle of Beliefs", [...] "Serenity in Murder", [...] "213" [...] and [...] "Mind Control". Divine Intervention received mixed reviews by critics. The album sold 93,000 copies in its first week. It peaked number eight on the Billboard 200 and charted at number 15 on UK Albums Chart. It was rewarded gold in the United States and Canada. An EP entitled Serenity in Murder was released shortly after the album.|$|R
5000|$|At {{one time}} or another, {{everyone}} wants life to be more rational and scientific. Then we wouldn't have to spend <b>so</b> <b>much</b> late-night <b>time</b> <b>on</b> the phone with friends, playing out scenarios of the possibilities life offers. Corporate executives aren't exempt from this desire. They too spin scenarios, of the bottom-line variety. This {{must have been the}} audience Adam M. Brandenburger and Barry J. Nalebuff had in mind when they wrote Co-opetition, a book about [...] "the game theory strategy that's changing the game of business," [...] as they put it. Mr. Brandenburger, a Harvard Business School professor, and Mr. Nalebuff, who teaches at the Yale School of Management, believe businesses can become more competitive by cooperating, hence the neologism [...] "co-opetition." ... The authors never really make clear what distinguishes game theory from good business sense. Decision-making is looking upside, downside, matching advantage against disadvantage, marrying a weakness to a strength and occasionally doing something [...] "counterintuitive" [...] that actually makes complete sense in context. Since the book is full of good stories, it's hard not to recommend it, but readers looking for science are likely to be disappointed.|$|R

5000|$|Out {{of all the}} characters, Frieda has {{the most}} trouble getting along with Snoopy, whom she {{frequently}} accuses of being [...] "lazy" [...] and [...] "useless." [...] She has strong pre-conceived notions of what a beagle should be doing with its time; she wants Snoopy to be a working dog and a hunter (especially a hunter of rabbits), and not spend <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> sleeping <b>on</b> top of his doghouse. She often comes over and tries to goad Snoopy into chasing rabbits with her, either by threat or persuasion, which he is always reluctant to do. If he does consent to [...] "hunt," [...] he'll either [...] it and only pretend {{to look for the}} rabbits, or if he does find rabbits he'll frolic and play with them once he's out of Frieda's sight. Once, in a fit of frustration, she reported Snoopy's behavior to the [...] "Head Beagle," [...] which led to him being found guilty of not meeting his rabbit quota and left the neighborhood kids mad at her for turning him in.

And, instead of doing the artist/audience performance-type thing, I wanted to deconstruct it and make the audience more of a fly-on-the-wall kind of observer...

So it is a difficult as well as an important issue. Housing designed for older people whose needs change as they age faces an almost built-in conflict of interest. They need more services as they age, so the costs are going to rise as more care is provided. Their income tends to be less over the years. They wish to reduce the cost but they need more services. Older and frailer residents are more costly, so when residents manage the schemes themselves they may wish to sell to active, fit and therefore younger people.” ...|$|R
