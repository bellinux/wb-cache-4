50|$|Dermestes maculatus, {{known as}} the hide beetle, leather beetle, or <b>skin</b> <b>beetle,</b> feeds on raw skins and hides like the larder beetle. This species is similar in {{appearance}} to the larder beetle, with short and long reddish brown or black setae, but its two spine-like posterior appendages curve forward. Also, the forewings are dark brown and the sternum is mostly white with some black. Its life cycle is 60 to 70 days and the female can lay up to 800 eggs.|$|E
40|$|The free-ranging urban dog, Canis domesticus (L.) carcass {{decomposition}} {{in tropical}} region, i. e., Takht-i-Bahi, Mardan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan during 15 - 25 May 2011 {{was characterized by}} 5 stages, i. e., fresh (12 h), bloated (13 - 48 h), active (49 - 96 h), advanced (97 - 144 h) and dry (145 - 265 h) and the ecological succession pattern of insect species collected were identified into 11 species of 3 orders. The insect species associated with the carcass of C. domesticus found that the blow flies, Chrysomya rufifacies (Macquart) and house fly, Musca domestica (Linnaeus, 1758) {{were found in the}} fresh, bloat and active decay stages. However, the blow fly, C. megacephala (Fabricius); flesh fly, Parasarcophaga ruficornis (Meigen) and the hornet wasp, Vespa orientalis (Linnaeus) were existed in the fresh and bloat stages. Moreover, cheese fly, Piophila casei (Linnaeus) was found bloat and active decay stages. Further, the hide beetle, Dermestes maculates (Geer), clown beetle, Hister sp. (Gullenhal); ham beetle, Necrobia rufipes (Fabricus) and <b>skin</b> <b>beetle,</b> Trox sp. (Harold) completed their life cycle in active decay, advance decay and dry stages. Furthermore, the jummper ant, Myrmecia pilosula (Smith) was collected from only fresh stage. The specimens of insect species were collected minimum 0. 8 % of V. orientalis and maximum 21. 3 % of 2 species, i. e., C. rufifacies and M. domestica. The temperature, humidity and rainfalls were found affected insect larvae, pupae and adults, and rate of decomposition of C. domesticus. The average temperature, humidity and rainfalls were 35. 34 ± 1. 54, 38. 8 % and 3. 8 mm, respectively, of 11 experimental days.

5|$|The nesting {{specimen}} MPC-D 107/15 {{has provided}} much {{information about the}} taphonomic processes (changes during fossilisation) in the Baruungoyot Formation. The specimen is preserved in facies that {{are thought to have}} been deposited through a sandstorm or dune-shift. It {{does not seem to have}} been transported after death, but the body appears to have shifted slightly to the right, indicating the sediment in which it was deposited came towards it from its left side. The neck is curved to the left, the left hand is folded backwards, and the legs are folded into a crouching position. The vertebral column, neck, and hips deteriorated during burial, and much of the damage to the skeleton is thought to have been caused by the activity of invertebrates. Borings in the bones, burrows, and reworked sediments (perhaps caused by the construction of pupal chambers) in the specimen indicate it was scavenged upon by colonies of <b>skin</b> <b>beetles</b> (Dermestidae) and perhaps other scavenging insects. There are many feeding traces in the joints of the skeleton, and almost all the surfaces where the bones articulated have been obliterated. There are also tunnels in the nest under the neck and skull, and no egg remains have been found in parts with such traces. Modern <b>skin</b> <b>beetles</b> mainly feed on muscle tissue but not on moist materials, and their activity is prevented by rapid burial. It is therefore thought that specimen MPC-D107/15 was only partially buried at first, with the upper part being exposed enough for a colony of <b>skin</b> <b>beetles</b> to develop. Some damage to the skeleton (especially in the vertebral column) may also have been caused by the scavenging of small mammals.|$|R
50|$|Maceration is an {{alternative}} to the Dermestes method in which <b>skin</b> <b>beetles</b> are used to clean the flesh off of the corpse, a method which is used with corpses of small mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians, because these animals' bones tend to fall apart in many tiny parts.

50|$|Dermestes lardarius, {{commonly}} known as the larder beetle, is a species of beetle in the family Dermestidae, the <b>skin</b> <b>beetles.</b> It is found worldwide. It is a common pest of households and storage facilities ("larders") in much of the world. It eats animal products, such as dried meats and fish, pet food, skins and hides, feathers, cheese, and museum specimens such as dried insects. It may also eat plant material that is high in protein, such as grain.|$|R
50|$|Dermestidae are {{a family}} of Coleoptera that are {{commonly}} referred to as <b>skin</b> <b>beetles.</b> Other common names include larder beetle, hide or leather beetles, carpet beetles, and khapra beetles. There are approximately 500 to 700 species worldwide. They can range in size from 1 to 12 mm. Key characteristics for adults are round oval shaped bodies covered in scales or setae. The (usually) clubbed antennae fit into deep grooves. The hind femora also fit into recesses of the coxa. Larvae are scarabaeiform and also have setae.|$|R
5000|$|Powderpost beetles are a {{group of}} seventy species of woodboring beetles {{classified}} in the insect subfamily Lyctinae. These beetles, along with spider beetles, death watch beetles, common furniture <b>beetles,</b> <b>skin</b> <b>beetles,</b> and others, make up the superfamily Bostrichoidea. While most woodborers have a large prothorax, powderpost beetles do not, making their heads more visible. In addition to this, their antennae have two-jointed clubs. They are considered pests and attack deciduous trees, over time reducing the wood to a powdery dust. The damage caused by longhorn beetles (family Cerambycidae) is often confused with that of powderpost beetles, but the two groups are unrelated. Their larvae are white and C-shaped.|$|R
5|$|The larva {{is usually}} the {{principal}} feeding stage of the beetle life cycle. Larvae tend to feed voraciously once they emerge from their eggs. Some feed externally on plants, {{such as those of}} certain leaf beetles, while others feed within their food sources. Examples of internal feeders are most Buprestidae and longhorn beetles. The larvae of many beetle families are predatory like the adults (ground beetles, ladybirds, rove beetles). The larval period varies between species, but can be as long as several years. The larvae of <b>skin</b> <b>beetles</b> undergo a degree of reversed development when starved, and later grow back to the previously attained level of maturity. The cycle can be repeated many times (see Biological immortality). Larval morphology is highly varied amongst species, with well-developed and sclerotized heads, distinguishable thoracic and abdominal segments (usually the tenth, though sometimes the eighth or ninth).|$|R
50|$|The {{environment}} of the Nemegt Formation {{has been compared to}} the Okavango Delta of present-day Botswana. The habitats in and around the Nemegt rivers provided a home for a wide array of organisms. Aquatic animals include molluscs, fish, turtles, and the crocodylomorph Shamosuchus. Fossils of mammals such as multituberculates have been found, and birds such as Gurilynia, Judinornis, and Teviornis are known. Herbivorous dinosaurs of the Nemegt Formation include ankylosaurids such as Tarchia, the pachycephalosaurian Prenocephale, hadrosaurids such as Saurolophus and Barsboldia, and sauropods such as Nemegtosaurus, and Opisthocoelicaudia. Other theropods include tyrannosauroids such as Tarbosaurus, Alioramus, and Bagaraatan, troodontids such as Borogovia, Tochisaurus, and Saurornithoides, therizinosaurs such as Therizinosaurus, and ornithomimosaurians such as Deinocheirus, Anserimimus, and Gallimimus. Other oviraptorosaur genera known from the Nemegt Formation include the basal Avimimus, the oviraptorids Rinchenia, Nomingia, and Ajancingenia, and the caenagnathid Elmisaurus. In addition, Conchoraptor is known from the Baruungoyot Formation. The Nemegt Formation is unique in having both oviraptorid and caenagnathid oviraptorosaurs, and in 1993 Phillip J. Currie and colleagues suggested this diversity was due to the two groups preferring different environments in the area. In 2016 Takanobu Tsuihiji and colleagues suggested that oviraptorids may have preferred drier environments, while caenagnathids preferred fluvial environments, based on the type of formations they have been found in. The nesting specimen MPC-D 107/15 has provided much information about the taphonomic processes (changes during fossilisation) in the Baruungoyot Formation.

5|$|The nesting Nemegtomaia {{specimen}} {{was placed}} on top of what was probably a ring of eggs, with its arms folded across them. None of the eggs are complete, but they are estimated to have been 5to 6cm (2to 2.3in) wide and 14to 16cm (5to 6in) long when intact. The specimen {{was found in a}} stratigraphic area that indicates Nemegtomaia preferred nesting near streams that would provide soft, sandy substrate and food. Nemegtomaia may have protected its eggs by covering them with its tail and wing feathers. The skeleton of the nesting specimen has damage that indicates it was scavenged by <b>skin</b> <b>beetles.</b> The diet of oviraptorids is uncertain, but their skulls are most similar to other animals that are known or thought to have been herbivorous. Nemegtomaia is known from the Nemegt and Baruungoyot Formations, which are thought to represent humid and arid environments that coexisted in the same area.|$|R

40|$|Phoretic mites {{are likely}} the most {{abundant}} arthropods found on carcases and corpses. They outnumber their scavenger carriers in both number and diversity. Many phoretic mites travel on scavenger insects and are highly specific; they will arrive on a particular species of host and no other. Because of this, they may be useful as trace indicators of their carriers even when their carriers are absent. Phoretic mites can be valuable markers of time. They are usually found in a specialised transitional transport or dispersal stage, often moulting and transforming to adults shortly after arrival on a carcase or corpse. Many are characterised by faster development and generation cycles than their carriers. Humans are normally unaware, but we too carry mites; they are skin mites that are present in our clothes. More than 212 phoretic mite species associated with carcases {{have been reported in}} the literature. Among these, mites belonging to the Mesostigmata form the dominant group, represented by 127 species with 25 phoretic mite species belonging to the family Parasitidae and 48 to the Macrochelidae. Most of these mesostigmatids are associated with particular species of flies or carrion beetles, though some are associated with small mammals arriving during the early stages of decomposition. During dry decay, members of the Astigmata are more frequently found; 52 species are phoretic on scavengers, and the majority of these travel on late-arriving scavengers such as hide <b>beetles,</b> <b>skin</b> <b>beetles</b> and moths. Several species of carrion beetles can visit a corpse simultaneously, and each may carry 1 - 10 species of phoretic mites. An informative diversity of phoretic mites may be found on a decaying carcass at any given time. The composition of the phoretic mite assemblage on a carcass might provide valuable information about the conditions of and time elapsed since death...|$|R

40|$|Introduction The Quail Ridge Reserve {{is part of}} the University of California Natural Reserve System and {{is located}} in Napa County on a {{peninsula}} {{at the southern end of}} Lake Berryessa. The reserve is composed of land owned by the US Bureau of Land Management, US Bureau of Reclamation, Quail Ridge Wilderness Conservation, California Department of Fish and Game, and UC Regents. The University NRS continues to expand on the reserve as private property owners become willing to sell parcels, thereby increasing the size of this amazing protected wildlife and ecological study site. Vegetation on Quail Ridge consists primarily of mixed oak woodland, riparian, native and non-native grasslands, and chamise chaparral. The illustrated beetles and species and family list in this book are the product of a beetle survey conducted on the reserve. Beetles were collected by black light at the reserve field station and in Decker Canyon, on flowering vegetation, under logs and other harborage, and along roadsides during daytime and evening hours and reared from logs.
