500|$|Reports {{arose in}} the media that the ticket sales for the tour were falling, leading Arthur Fogel, Chairman of Live Nation's Global Touring division, to brand them as [...] "ridiculous". He {{clarified}} to Billboard that the about 80% of the tickets were sold in North America and Europe, and {{they were still in}} the process of releasing future dates for numerous venues. The 29 shows in North America had grossed around US $26 million, with an average of almost $900,000 per show. Fogel also addressed concerns that Live Nation had lost $30 million from Gaga's tour, saying that if a similar situation really happened, then the company would have cancelled the concerts. [...] "I just don't know how this shit gets any traction without people doing their homework... Just a complete fool would say <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>and</b> it could only come from somebody who has an agenda, because it makes absolutely no sense, on any level", Fogel concluded. A total of 800,000 tickets have been sold for the tour, as reported by Billboard.|$|E
500|$|The lyrical themes on Dig Me Out {{deal with}} issues of heartbreak and survival. The song [...] "One More Hour" [...] is about the breakup of Tucker and Brownstein's romantic relationship. Before {{the release of the}} album, Spin {{published}} a controversial article discussing Tucker and Brownstein's personal relationship without their permission. Brownstein felt that [...] "it was a complete invasion of privacy. My parents didn't know Corin and I were going out. They didn't know I had ever dated a woman before. It was horrible. I was pissed at Spin, really mad. Luckily my parents are great people, but God forbid I would have some family that would disown me over <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> <b>And</b> I would have totally held Spin responsible for that." [...] The song features a lot of vocal interplay by Tucker and Brownstein. Chris Nelson of Addicted to Noise noted that [...] "one can almost hear Tucker crying in the studio as she wails, 'I needed it', while behind her Brownstein offers her attempts at consolation". In her 2015 memoir Hunger Makes Me A Modern Girl, Brownstein also states that almost all the songs on Dig Me Out are about either her or Tucker's future husband, Lance Bangs.|$|E
500|$|In June 2014, Clark Gregg stated he {{believed}} the season would be shown in a block of 10 episodes, then breaking for Agent Carter, before airing the remaining 12. Explaining this decision, Bell said, One of our challenges last year was to produce 22 episodes that aired over, what, 40 weeks? 36 weeks? <b>Something</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> <b>And</b> the age of re-runs is dead. Re-runs are death, and so you're trying to commit to the habit of the show and [...] tune in to something else or a re-run and they'll get pissed off. They'll go away. What this allows us to do is minimize repeats. We're showing ten episodes, and {{there has to be}} a gap or two because it's physically impossible to produce ten shows and get through post production in time, we can't do that so there's going to be a Marvel special at some point. But pretty much every week you're showing up and we're there, and then instead of a repeat showing up mid-run and losing momentum, Agent Carter comes in and has its own cool stuff, and they're running eight weeks in a row, then we can come back and run twelve in a row with no interruptions. We're still producing our show every week but it just gives us time, barely, to finish 22 on schedule. It takes out the need for repeats in the back half.|$|E

500|$|For a brief period, McDonald and Melton {{performed}} {{together as}} a duo at college campuses in the Northwest on behalf of Students for a Democratic Society before returning as regulars at the Jabberwock cafe. The two were joined by local jug band musicians, including Melton's roommates, bass player Bruce Barthol and guitarist Paul Armstrong, and bluegrass guitarist David Bennett Cohen, with whom Melton played in another jug band. The addition of drummer John Francis-Gunning rounded out the six-piece ensemble. It was during their residency at the Jabberwock that Country Joe and the Fish learned to play as a group and expand their repertoire. Within months, based on McDonald and Melton's interest in the live performances of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, the recordings on Bob Dylan's album, Highway 61 Revisited, and {{their use of the}} mind-altering drug LSD, the group began equipping themselves with electric instruments and delving more into psychedelia. As a result, Cohen was moved over to the organ. Cohen's experience with keyboards was limited to having played piano at a semiprofessional capacity at the Jabberwock, but, nonetheless, he quickly adapted to the qualities of the instrument. Melton describes the change of the group: [...] "Once we hit into the electric medium and into the rock medium, we were pandering to the public taste. We became extraordinarily popular. The little folk club where we used to play once every two weeks, we played every single night for a month, or <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> <b>and</b> filled it. And after a while we filled two shows every single night".|$|E

2500|$|Ladd offered Lucas some of {{the only}} support from the studio; he dealt with {{scrutiny}} from board members over the rising budget and complex screenplay drafts. Initially, Fox approved $8million for the project; Gary Kurtz said: [...] "we proceeded to pick a production plan and do a more final budget with a British art department and look for locations in North Africa, and kind of pulled together some things. Then, {{it was obvious that}} 8million wasn't going to do it—they had approved 8million." [...] After requests from the team that [...] "it had to be more", the executives [...] "got a bit scared". For two weeks, Lucas and his crew [...] "didn't really do anything except kind of pull together new budget figures". At the same time, after production fell behind schedule, Ladd told Lucas he had to finish production within a week or he would be forced to shut down production. Kurtz said that [...] "it came out to be like 9.8 or [...]9 or <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> <b>and</b> in the end they just said, 'Yes, that's okay, we'll go ahead. The crew split into three units, with those units led by Lucas, Kurtz, and production supervisor Robert Watts. Under the new system, the project met the studio's deadline.|$|E
