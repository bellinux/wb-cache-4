2500|$|Confusion {{has arisen}} {{regarding}} the exact date when Aguascalientes formally {{separated from the}} territory of Zacatecas.

Taking advantage of the independent souls of the Aguascalentenses, and by way of punishing Zacatecas for supporting the Revolution against them, by Federal Decree of General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna dated May 23, 1835, in the third article; ordered that Aguascalientes continue divided from the Zacatecas territory, without granting the territory any specific category, reinstating the appointment of the political boss, Pedro Garcia Rojas. [...] With respect to this, it must be mentioned that said order was not made official as it did not meet the legal requirements to take effect, since it was necessary that two thirds of each house, both Senators and Representatives, approved the order; furthermore it would be required that two thirds of the legislatures of the states also approved it. The second requirement not being completed, the constitutional congress convened again to develop the centralized constitution that would be known later as the Seven Laws. [...] The constitution did not acknowledge Aguascalientes in the rank of department, but it saw fit to eliminate the states, together with the federal regime, replacing the states with departments, and because of this it continued to belong to Zacatecas. [...] What can be said, since in the local constitution of Zacatecas of 1825, Aguascalientes was contemplated as a member of <b>said</b> <b>state.</b>|$|E
