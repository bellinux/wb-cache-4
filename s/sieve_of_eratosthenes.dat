We improved the <b>sieve</b> method <b>of</b> <b>Eratosthenes,</b> obtained a prime recursive formula, which give a direct strict constructive {{proof that the}} number of primes is infinite. Steep forward, we used both limits of the set sequence limT ′n, lim |T ′n | to prove that the twin prime conjecture,the prime triple conjecture, [...] .,and the prime k-tuple conjecture is true. 1. introduction If a, a+ 2 are simultaneously prime, we say the a is a twin prime, and denote it by the predicate R(2, a). If a + b 1, a + b 2, [...] ., a + bk are simultaneously prime, we say the a is a prime k-tuple, and denote it by the predicate R(k, a). The prime k-tuple conjecture assures {{that the number of}} prime k-tuples is infi-nite. Usually we denote it by the formal sentence ∀b∃a>bR(k, a). Great lot of numerical evidence supported that this sentence is true [1]. But, this is a sentence with the form ∏ 0 2, {{it is very hard to}} prove this sentence.

25|$|An {{algorithm}} yielding all primes up {{to a given}} limit, such {{as required}} in the primes-only trial division method, is called a prime number sieve. The oldest example, the <b>sieve</b> <b>of</b> <b>Eratosthenes</b> (see above), {{is still the most}} commonly used. The sieve of Atkin is another option. Before the advent of computers, lists of primes up to bounds like 107 were also used.|$|E
25|$|There are hints in the {{surviving}} {{records of the}} ancient Egyptians that they had some knowledge of prime numbers: the Egyptian fraction expansions in the Rhind papyrus, for instance, have quite different forms for primes and for composites. However, the earliest surviving records of the explicit study of prime numbers come from the Ancient Greeks. Euclid's Elements (circa 300 BC) contain important theorems about primes, including the infinitude of primes and the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. Euclid also showed how to construct a perfect number from a Mersenne prime. The <b>Sieve</b> <b>of</b> <b>Eratosthenes,</b> attributed to Eratosthenes, is a simple method to compute primes, although the large primes found today with computers are not generated this way.|$|E
25|$|The most {{extensive}} Egyptian mathematical text is the Rhind papyrus (sometimes {{also called the}} Ahmes Papyrus after its author), dated to c. 1650 BC but likely a copy of an older document from the Middle Kingdom of about 2000–1800 BC. It is an instruction manual for students in arithmetic and geometry. In addition to giving area formulas and methods for multiplication, division and working with unit fractions, it also contains evidence of other mathematical knowledge, including composite and prime numbers; arithmetic, geometric and harmonic means; and simplistic understandings of both the <b>Sieve</b> <b>of</b> <b>Eratosthenes</b> and perfect number theory (namely, that of the number 6). It also shows how to solve first order linear equations as well as arithmetic and geometric series.|$|E

2500|$|A {{large body}} of {{mathematical}} work would still be valid when calling 1 a prime, but Euclid's fundamental theorem of arithmetic (mentioned above) would not hold as stated. For example, the number 15 can be factored as [...] and if 1 were admitted as a prime, these two presentations would be considered different factorizations of 15 into prime numbers, so the statement of that theorem {{would have to be}} modified. Similarly, the <b>sieve</b> <b>of</b> <b>Eratosthenes</b> would not work correctly if 1 were considered a prime: {{a modified version of the}} sieve that considers 1 as prime would eliminate all multiples of 1 (that is, all other numbers) and produce as output only the single number1. Furthermore, the prime numbers have several properties that the number 1 lacks, such as the relationship of the number to its corresponding value of Euler's totient function or the sum of divisors function.|$|E
2500|$|Around {{the same}} time, Eratosthenes of Cyrene (c. 276–194 BC) devised the <b>Sieve</b> <b>of</b> <b>Eratosthenes</b> for finding prime numbers. The 3rd century BC is {{generally}} regarded as the [...] "Golden Age" [...] of Greek mathematics, with advances in pure mathematics henceforth in relative decline. Nevertheless, in the centuries that followed significant advances were made in applied mathematics, most notably trigonometry, largely {{to address the needs}} of astronomers. Hipparchus of Nicaea (c. 190–120 BC) is considered the founder of trigonometry for compiling the first known trigonometric table, and to him is also due the systematic use of the 360 degree circle. Heron of Alexandria (c. 10–70 AD) is credited with Heron's formula for finding the area of a scalene triangle and with being the first to recognize the possibility of negative numbers possessing square roots. Menelaus of Alexandria (c. 100 AD) pioneered spherical trigonometry through Menelaus' theorem. The most complete and influential trigonometric work of antiquity is the Almagest of Ptolemy (c. AD 90–168), a landmark astronomical treatise whose trigonometric tables would be used by astronomers for the next thousand years. Ptolemy is also credited with Ptolemy's theorem for deriving trigonometric quantities, and the most accurate value of π outside of China until the medieval period, 3.1416.|$|E
40|$|A {{few years}} ago we {{identified}} a recursion that works directly with the gaps among the generators in each stage <b>of</b> <b>Eratosthenes</b> <b>sieve.</b> This recursion provides explicit enumerations of sequences of gaps among the generators, which are known as constellations.

5000|$|Using big O {{notation}} is {{also not}} the correct way to compare practical performance of even variations of the <b>Sieve</b> <b>of</b> <b>Eratosthenes</b> as it ignores constant factors and offsets that may be very significant for practical ranges: The <b>sieve</b> <b>of</b> <b>Eratosthenes</b> variation known as the Pritchard wheel sieve has an [...] performance, but its basic implementation requires either a [...] "one large array" [...] algorithm which limits its usable range {{to the amount of}} available memory else it needs to be page segmented to reduce memory use. When implemented with page segmentation in order to save memory, the basic algorithm still requires about [...] bits of memory (much more than the requirement of the basic page segmented <b>sieve</b> <b>of</b> <b>Eratosthenes</b> using [...] bits of memory). Pritchard's work reduced the memory requirement to the limit as described above the table, but the cost is a fairly large constant factor of about three in execution time to about three quarters the sieve range due to the complex computations required to do so. As {{can be seen from the}} above table for the basic <b>sieve</b> <b>of</b> <b>Eratosthenes,</b> even though the resulting wheel sieve has [...] performance and an acceptable memory requirement, it will never be faster than a reasonably Wheel Factorized basic <b>sieve</b> <b>of</b> <b>Eratosthenes</b> for any practical sieving range by a factor of about two. Other than that it is quite complex to implement, it is rarely practically implemented because it still uses more memory than the basic <b>Sieve</b> <b>of</b> <b>Eratosthenes</b> implementations described here as well as being slower for practical ranges.
