5|$|The spores are white, smooth, roughly elliptical, {{and have}} {{dimensions}} of 7–8.5 by 5–6μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are 17–23 by 7.5–10μm, and four-spored with sterigmata around 3 μm long. The paraphyses are 5–8μm wide, {{shorter than the}} basidia, more abundant and form a somewhat gelatinous layer. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the cap edge) are 60 by 7–21μm, hyaline, conical or ventricose (inflated). The tips of the cheilocystidia are drawn out to a point, or have a short appendage measuring 15 by 2–3μm, which is sometimes branched, and is thin or slightly thick-walled. There are no cystidia on the gill face (pleurocystidia). Pileocystidia (cystidia {{on the surface of}} the cap) are club-shaped, measuring 25–60 by 13–25μm. They are somewhat thick-walled, and spiny on the exposed surface with short simple outgrowths extending up to 3μm long. The pileocystidia are joined together and form a continuous layer over the young cap, but break up as the cap expands. The caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) are conical or lance-shaped, hyaline, and smooth, with walls that are thin or slightly thickened. They measure up to 300 by 10–25μm, but are shorter in the upper regions of the <b>stem.</b> <b>Clamp</b> connections are present in the hyphae of all tissues.|$|E
50|$|Flat {{bars are}} the {{standard}} handlebars equipped on mountain bikes, hybrids, and recently on fixed-gear bicycles and flat bar road bikes. A flat bar is a nearly-straight tube, {{in most cases}} slightly bent toward the rider. Many penny-farthings and early safety bicycles had flat handlebars. The angle between the slightly swept-back ends of the handlebar and the axis of the <b>stem</b> <b>clamp</b> {{is known as the}} sweep angle.|$|E
50|$|The {{handlebars}} {{are similar}} in form to a shallow drop handlebar found on a racing bicycle which has been turned upside down. Handlegrips or bar tape are applied to the top, horizontal portions of the bar. The handlebar, which can spin 360°, is mounted to a stem that has no horizontal extension, which puts the <b>stem</b> <b>clamp</b> {{in line with the}} steering axis and allows for the handlebars to remain in the same relative position no matter whether the front wheel is facing forward or backward.|$|E
5000|$|Threadless: the <b>stem</b> <b>clamps</b> {{around the}} steerer tube, {{which is not}} {{threaded}} and extends above the headset.|$|R
50|$|Threadless stems, {{the newer}} {{of the two}} styles, are widely popular and have {{displaced}} quill stems as the industry standard on sport bikes. Threadless stems feature a modular design where the <b>stem</b> <b>clamps</b> around {{the outside of the}} top of the fork steerer tube that protrudes above the headset. Threadless stems are commonly available in lengths up to about 130 millimeters (5 inches).|$|R

50|$|A {{more recent}} {{standard}} is a 31.8 mm (1.25") clamp for both MTB and road bars. This is rapidly taking {{over from the}} previous mix of sizes, although other accessories such as some light or computer brackets may {{also need to be}} oversized to fit the thicker bars. Standard brake levers can be used as it is only the <b>stem</b> <b>clamp</b> central section that is oversized. Shims are available to fit a 31.8 mm stem to either a 25.4 mm or 26.0 mm bar, so many new models of stems are oversize-only.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>stem</b> <b>clamp</b> area, the shifter and/or brake lever and grip area on a bar can have several different diameters. For traditional road and mountain handlebars, these diameters are standard and so there has historically been little confusion except when mixing road and mountain components. However, in recent years there have been cross-over bar types that do not fall into one category or the other, and which can conceivably use either type of shifter, brake lever or grip (an example is the upright style bar). For this reason, certain handlebars are now available in multiple sizes related to the shifter or brake lever clamp diameter.|$|E

5000|$|The {{threadless}} headset is a {{more recent}} design. U.S. Patent 5095770 is owned by Cane Creek Cycling Components and expired on September 29, 2010. Headsets of this type are often referred to by the Dia-Compe (now Cane Creek) registered trademark [...] "Aheadset", and are manufactured under license. Like a traditional headset, it uses two sets of bearings and bearing cups. Unlike a threaded headset, a threadless headset {{does not have a}} threaded top headset race or use a threaded steerer tube. Instead the steerer tube extends from the fork {{all the way through the}} head tube and above the headset, and is held in place by the <b>stem</b> <b>clamped</b> on top.|$|R
5000|$|Care {{is needed}} when {{choosing}} a handlebar to match a stem, or vice versa, as there are several standards. The ISO standard for the <b>stem</b> <b>clamping</b> area of a handlebar is 25.4 mm, which is used on mountain bikes and many Japanese-made road handlebars. However, the Italian unofficial standard is 26.0 mm, {{which is the most}} common clamp size for road bars. There are also intermediate sizes such as 25.8 mm to try to achieve compatibility with either an ISO or Italian stem, and the old Cinelli-specific size of 26.4 mm. In practice, many modern stems with removable faceplates are quite accommodating of slight differences in handlebar clamp size, but the older type of stem with a single pinch bolt must be accurately matched. In the days of quill stems, a road stem was clearly identifiable from its [...] "7" [...] shape, but nowadays {{it can be hard to}} tell the difference between a [...] "road" [...] (26.0 mm) and [...] "MTB" [...] (25.4 mm) stem. Manufacturers frequently omit the clamp size from advertising or packaging.|$|R
5000|$|Stoker {{handlebars}} {{are typically}} {{connected to a}} stoker <b>stem</b> that is <b>clamped</b> around the captain's seatpost. The stoker handlebars are typically bull horns or very wide drop bars with [...] "stoker pegs" [...] instead of brake levers.|$|R
50|$|There {{are a few}} {{different}} types of headset distinguishable {{by the way the}} bearings are held in place (with a lock nut or with a <b>clamping</b> <b>stem),</b> or by where they are located (inside or outside the head tube).|$|R
40|$|Assembly of {{off-road}} bicycle handlebars with a <b>stem</b> that <b>clamps</b> {{the handlebar}} around its circumference {{would be expected}} to affect fatigue performance by introducing both assembly stresses and stress concentration. Because the effect of clamping on fatigue performance is unknown and because of the need to insure structural reliability in the stem-handlebar assembly to prevent serious injury, the objectives of the work reported by the present article were fourfold. One was to determine the stresses due to assembly and the stress concentration induced in a handlebar for two different clamp designs (i. e. 1 -bolt and 2 -bolt), a second was to determine experimentally the high cycle constant amplitude load fatigue lives of the two stem-handlebar assemblies, a third was to determine experimentally the variable amplitude load fatigue lives, and the fourth was to predict the variable amplitude load fatigue life with constant amplitude load fatigue test results. The handlebar was instrumented with strain gages and the assembly strains were measured when the <b>stem</b> <b>clamps</b> were tightened. The handlebar was also loaded as a cantilever beam while the applied strains were measured for each assembly. Stresses were computed and the maximum stresses induced by clamping exceeded 200 MPa for both assemblies. A method unique to this study was devised to determine the stress concentration at an arbitrary angular location around the circumference of the handlebar and for an arbitrary loading direction in the plane of the bicycle. For a load directed along an angle of - 38 degrees (clockwise rotation from horizontal viewed from the right), both stems created similar stress concentration; the location of maximum applied stress was shifted by 30 degrees from the point that would be expected in the absence of assembly and the stress was increased by 40 % at this location. The measured fatigue lifetimes for constant amplitude loading were similar for the two stem designs but the variable amplitude load fatigue lifetime for the 1 -bolt stem assembly was shorter than that for the 2 -bolt stem assembly by 19 %. The fatigue lifetimes for variable amplitude loading based on constant amplitude load fatigue test results were predicted to within 3 % and 33 % forthe 1 -bolt and 2 -bolt stems, respectively. Thus, constant amplitude load fatigue test results can be used to approximate the variable amplitude load fatigue life. However, the ranking of different assemblies may not be accurately indicated by constant amplitude load fatigue data...|$|R
50|$|In the {{threadless}} headset system, the spacers {{are important}} in placing the stem and preload bolt in the correct position on the steerer tube. Thus the stack height of the stem becomes important. The steerer tube of the fork must be cut to length such that it leaves at least enough of the steerer tube protruding above the headset for the <b>stem</b> to <b>clamp</b> on to; if the steerer tube is cut longer than the stem, then spacers are used {{to fill the gap}} between the stem and the conical compression washer. Bicycle racers seeking the greatest saddle-to-handlebar drop for better aerodynamics will often forego spacers and cut the steerer tube down to exactly match the headset bearing cup stack height plus the stem height.|$|R
40|$|Hemp (Cannabis sativa) {{produces}} phloem fibres, {{which are}} formed in bundles towards {{the periphery of}} the stem. This study investigated one aspect of the retting process, the dissociation of these fibres from the core of the stem, which is influenced by the action of micro-organisms. Peel tests were used to investigate the work required to remove a tissue peel, rich in fibres, from the core of the stem. Two separate experiments studied (1) the effects of tissue dehydration as stems were dried out in the oven; and (2) the progress of retting in stems that were dew-retted in the field. A comparison between two different types of peel tests, where the <b>stems</b> were <b>clamped</b> either vertically or horizontally in the jaws of a tensile testing machine and the load applied vertically, showed that the work required to peel stems in the vertical position was over 20...|$|R
40|$|MEMS {{resonators}} fabricated in silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology must be clamped to {{the substrate}} via anchoring stems connected either {{from within the}} resonator or through the sides, with the side-clamped solution often employed due to manufacturing constraints. This paper examines the effect of two types of commonly used side-clamped, anchoring-stem geometries on the quality factor of three different laterally-driven resonator topologies. This study employs an analytical framework which considers the relative distribution of strain energies between the resonating body and <b>clamping</b> <b>stems.</b> The ratios of the strain energies are computed using ANSYS FEA and used to provide {{an indicator of the}} expected anchor-limited quality factors. Three MEMS resonator topologies have been fabricated and characterized in moderate vacuum. The associated measured quality factors are compared against the computed strain energy ratios, and the trends are shown to agree well with the experimental data...|$|R
40|$|Flax and hemp produce phloem fibres {{towards the}} {{periphery}} of their stems; individual fibre cells are cemented into discrete bundles around the xylem core by a complex matrix of pectins, hemi-celluloses and lignin. Extraction of undamaged fibres from this structure is critical in successful fibre production. Typically, the cut stems are laid {{on the ground in}} swaths for several weeks, where aerobic fungi colonize the senescing stem and hydrolytic enzymes digest the fibre-bundle matrix (dew-retting). More recently, flax stems have been chemically desiccated and the fibre-bundle matrix digested in the standing crop, prior to cutting (stand-retting). Dew-retted hemp <b>stems</b> were <b>clamped</b> horizontally into the jaws of a tensile testing machine and the work required to remove a strip of fibre-containing peel from the xylem core was measured. A similar investigation was carried out on desiccated flax stems, but samples were clamped vertically due to their finer diameters. Results show an initial increase in the work to peel associated with the dehydration of the stems, from 185 – 210 J m- 2 in dew-retted hemp and 210 – 540 J m- 2 in desiccated flax. In both cases this initial increase was followed by a 45 % reduction in the work to peel during the following 3 – 4 weeks, despite relatively constant stem moisture content. This is thought to be a result of the retting process. The peel test can be used to monitor changes at the interface between the fibres and the xylem core during retting, allowing the process to be quantified and compared under different production conditions...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: In {{this paper}} we {{present the results}} of the {{mechanical}} testing of a new generation modular endoprosthesis, which has been designed to improve the results of mandibular reconstruction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The new cementless endoprosthesis consists of a male part, a female part (both with screws on the stems), connected via a dove-tailed connection and secured with a coronal screw. The endoprosthesis was fitted into standardized blocks of synthetic bone (Synbone AG, Malans, Switzerland). The set-up was fixed to an ElectroPuls testing machine at one end and loaded at the other end 25 mm away. Three specimens were loaded continuously until failure to determine the average load to failure of the construct. Five specimens were then loaded cyclically between 10 and 150 N until either failure or 500, 000 cycles. A finite element analysis was also performed on the set-up. RESULTS: Of the five specimens in the fatigue testing, only one survived while the other four either were bent or fractured at the <b>stem</b> of the <b>clamped</b> portion. The specimen that survived had very good bony contact with the prosthesis at the lower border. The connection of the modules via the dove-tailed design did not show any loosening. Finite element analysis showed areas of stress concentration at the superior surface of the stems to 188. 8 MPa. This was well below the yield strength of titanium alloy of 897 MPa. Statistical analysis performed for specimens 1 to 4 to calculated lower tolerance bounds on cycles to failure, representing the estimated minimum achievable cycles to failure at 90, 95, and 99 % of the population at 90 and 95 % confidence levels, showed that the estimated mean cycles to failure was 10, 132 cycles at the mean, minimum and maximum loads of 120 N and 18. 4 N respectively. CONCLUSION: Good bony contact seems to be essential at the lower border for long-term survival of the reconstruction. Small gaps increase the bending forces and thus shear stresses at the stem. The new design of the modular endoprosthesis is prone to stress concentrations at the superior surface of the stems. This is accentuated by the sharp screw threads of the stems. The loosening of the module connection seemed to have been stopped with the dove-tailed design...|$|R
