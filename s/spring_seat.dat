6000|$|In {{those days}} {{people did not}} [...] "call," [...] they went [...] "visitin'." [...] The women took their {{knitting}} and stayed all the afternoon and sometimes all night. No one owned a carriage. Each family journeyed in a heavy farm wagon with the father and mother riding high on the wooden <b>spring</b> <b>seat</b> while the children jounced {{up and down on}} the hay in the bottom of the box or clung desperately to the side-boards to keep from being jolted out. In such wise we started on our trip to the McClintocks'.|$|E
60|$|It is a raw November evening. Frank and Harriet and I {{are riding}} into {{a strange land}} in a {{clattering}} farm wagon. Father and mother are seated before us on the <b>spring</b> <b>seat.</b> The ground is frozen and {{the floor of the}} carriage pounds and jars. We cling to the iron-lined sides of the box to soften the blows. It is growing dark. Before us (in a similar vehicle) my Uncle David is leading the way. I catch momentary glimpses of him outlined against the pale yellow sky. He stands erect, holding the reins of his swiftly-moving horses in his powerful left hand. Occasionally he shouts back to my father, whose chin is buried in a thick buffalo-skin coat. Mother is only a vague mass, a figure wrapped in shawls. The wind is keen, the world gray and cheerless.|$|E
50|$|Within 6 {{months of}} {{provision}} of Hytrel washers {{on all the}} main line coaches, the failure of Axle box housing increased. The reason was the axle box wing cracks. Hence on examination of the failed axle boxes, it was noticed that the Hytrel washers were forming a deep groove of 4 to 8mm on the seating area of the axle box <b>spring</b> <b>seating.</b> They washers were also increasing {{the diameter of the}} <b>spring</b> <b>seating</b> due to continuous hitting of the raised section of the sitting area.|$|R

5000|$|Wakefield {{stood against}} Chief Minister Adam Giles in the 2016 election, {{in the south}} Alice <b>Springs</b> <b>seat</b> of Braitling. [...] Going into the election, Braitling was the fourth-safest seat in the Territory; Wakefield needed a 19.6 percent swing to win it. Like Alice Springs as a whole, Braitling had long been {{considered}} CLP heartland; it had only {{been out of the}} party's hands for two terms since its creation in 1984, when CLP-turned-independent Loraine Braham held it 2001 to 2008. Labor had never won an inner Alice <b>Springs</b> <b>seat</b> before (though it held at least one remote-based seat that spilled into Alice Springs from 1983 to 2012), and had never come particularly close to winning Braitling.|$|R
60|$|At last, in a nook {{formed by}} the {{weathered}} joints, Eustace found a rugged niche, somewhat dryer than the rest, and laid Cleer gently down in it, on a natural <b>spring</b> <b>seat</b> of tufted rock-plants. Then he settled down beside her, with what cheerfulness he could muster up, and taking off his wet coat, spread it on top across the cleft, like a tent roof, to shelter them. It was no time, indeed, to stand upon ceremony. Cleer recognized as much, and nestled close to his side, like a sensible girl as she was, so as to keep warm by mere company; while Eustace, still holding her hand, just to assure her of his presence, placed himself in such an attitude, leaning before her and above her, as to protect her {{as far as possible}} from the drizzling rainfall through the gap in front of them. There they sat till morning, talking gradually of many things, and growing more and more confidential, in spite of cold and wet, as they learnt more and more, with each passing hour, of each other's standpoint. There are some situations where you get to know people better in a few half-hours together than you could get to know them in months upon months of mere drawing-room acquaintance. And this was one of them. Before morning dawned, Eustace Le Neve and Cleer Trevennack felt just as if they had known one another quite well for years. They were old and trusted friends already. Old friends--and even something more than that. Though no word of love was spoken between them, each knew of what the other was thinking. Eustace felt Cleer loved him; Cleer felt Eustace loved her. And in spite of rain and cold and fog and darkness they were almost happy--before dawn came to interrupt their strange tete-a-tete on the islet.|$|E

50|$|Traditionally, rubber washers {{have been}} used at the seating {{arrangement}} of the primary springs of the axle box housing in the ICF design passenger coaches on the Indian Railways. The rubber washer is used directly on the axle box seating area. the lower <b>spring</b> <b>seat</b> sits on the washers. The lower <b>spring</b> <b>seat</b> is a tubular structure and 3/4 section is partitioned by using a circular ring which is welded at the 3/4 section. On the top of <b>spring</b> <b>seat,</b> a polymer ring called NFTC ring sits. The primary spring sits on the NFTC ring. The lower <b>spring</b> <b>seat</b> {{plays the role of}} a cylinder in the dashpot arrangement and is filled with oil. In the dashpot arrangement, the top portion is called the axle box guide. The axle box guide is welded to the bogie frame. The axle box guide works as a piston in the Lower <b>spring</b> <b>seat</b> filled with oil. This helps in damping the vibrations caused during running train operation.|$|E
60|$|Scarcely believing {{our good}} fortune, we all bounded towards these. In a moment I had mounted.

50|$|The primary {{suspension}} in an ICF Bogie {{is through a}} dashpot arrangement. The dashpot arrangement consists of a cylinder (lower <b>spring</b> <b>seat)</b> and the piston (axle box guide). Axle box springs are placed on the lower <b>spring</b> <b>seat</b> placed on the axle box wing of the axle box housing assembly. A rubber or a Hytrel washer is placed below the lower <b>spring</b> <b>seat</b> for cushioning effect. The axle box guide is welded to the bogie frame. The axle box guide acts as a piston. A homopolymer acetyle washer {{is placed on the}} lower end of the axle box guide. The end portion of the axle box guide is covered with a guide cap, which has holes in it. A sealing ring is placed near the washer and performs the function of a piston ring. The axle box guide moves in the lower <b>spring</b> <b>seat</b> filled with dashpot oil. This arrangement provides the dampening effect during the running of the coach.|$|E
50|$|Mercedes-Benz used a Cruden {{simulator}} {{during the}} development of its C-Class to experience different suspension settings, shock absorbers, <b>springs,</b> <b>seats,</b> engine mounts and car structure. According to Mercedes-Benz, using simulator during the product development stage reduced costs, time and also enabled engineers to accurately identify the different settings on the vehicle.|$|R
50|$|South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive (SYPTE) {{purchased}} over 100 examples between 1981 and 1985. The SYPTE standard fully <b>sprung</b> <b>seats</b> were fitted {{along with}} 20 MkIIs having coach seats for express work. The vehicles were noted for quick acceleration although had distinctive engine noise and were rust prone around the engine bay.|$|R
60|$|Our only {{carriage}} {{was still}} the lumber wagon but it had now two <b>spring</b> <b>seats,</b> one for father, mother and Jessie, and one for Harriet, Frank and myself. No one else had anything better, hence we {{had no sense of}} being poorly outfitted. We drove away across the frosty prairie toward Osage--moderately comfortable and perfectly happy.|$|R
50|$|The {{cylinder}} piston {{arrangement of the}} dashpot, i.e. the Lower <b>Spring</b> <b>seat</b> and the axle box guide is not fully sealed due to the limitation of the design and practical applicability. Its design provides that when a vertical vibration occurs during {{the movement of the}} railway coach, the axle box guide moves down. The downward movement of the Axle box guide puts pressure on the oil in the lower <b>spring</b> <b>seat.</b> The oil rushes up. However, since there are holes in the guide cap, the oil passes through these holes into the hollow body of the axle box guide. This helps in dampening the vertical vibrations. The axle box guide displaces the oil in the lower <b>spring</b> <b>seat</b> and pushes it upwards. Since, only part quantity of oil is able to move up in the hollow portion of the axle box guide, the balance displaced oil moves up.|$|E
50|$|The dashpot {{arrangement}} is mainly a cylinder piston arrangement {{used on the}} primary suspension of Indian Railway coaches of ICF design. The lower <b>spring</b> <b>seat</b> acts as a cylinder and the axle box guide acts as a piston.|$|E
50|$|The coaches {{come to the}} {{workshop}} once in a year. During examination of these coaches, it was noticed that the Hytrel washers have not only damaged the axle box housing but also the lower <b>spring</b> <b>seat</b> {{as well as the}} Protective tube.|$|E
5000|$|A {{program to}} {{refurbish}} the Harris trains began in 1982. The {{interior of the}} refurbished cars resembled a Comeng interior, having individual vinyl foam type seat cushions on an integrated plastic frame, replacing the former more traditional vinyl <b>sprung</b> <b>seats.</b> The refurbished cars also had air conditioning, and a new colour scheme. Due to their predominantly grey livery, the refurbished trains were known as [...] "Grey Ghosts".|$|R

50|$|On 2.4-litre cars, the {{independent}} rear suspension consisted {{on each side of}} a long oblique stamped steel link (incorporating the <b>spring</b> <b>seat)</b> and a transverse link, attached to the same crossmember which supported the differential; there were coil springs, single hydraulic dampers and an anti-roll bar.|$|E
50|$|The Cockburn Improved High Lift {{design has}} similar {{features}} to the Ross pop type. The exhaust steam is partially trapped {{on its way}} out and acts {{on the base of}} the <b>spring</b> <b>seat,</b> increasing the lift force on the valve and holding the valve further open.|$|E
50|$|The {{bottom of}} the axle box guide has a guide cap with {{perforations}} so that during the downward movement of the axle guide in the lower <b>spring</b> <b>seat,</b> the oil in the dashpot rushes in the axle box guide. This provides the dampening of vibration in a running coach.|$|E
50|$|There {{are four}} monomotor bogies, each {{powered by a}} {{longitudinally}} suspended motor driving both axles. The power supply is 750 volts DC from overhead lines using a pantograph (the Brecknell Willis High Reach pantograph). Speed is controlled from the cab by a joystick controller with a which must be continually held in place to keep the track brakes off. No other vigilance control is fitted, because of the perceived safety {{of a system of}} street-running trams. Drivers are <b>seated</b> on <b>sprung</b> <b>seats</b> for comfort and a PA system allows them to communicate with passengers.|$|R
