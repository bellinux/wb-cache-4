5|$|Many mental states {{seem to be}} {{experienced}} subjectively in different ways by different individuals. And it is characteristic of a mental state that it has some experiential quality, e.g. of pain, that it hurts. However, the sensation of pain between two individuals may not be identical, since {{no one has a}} perfect way to measure how much something hurts or of describing exactly how it feels to hurt. Philosophers and scientists therefore ask where these experiences come from. The existence of cerebral events, in and of themselves, cannot explain why they are accompanied by these corresponding qualitative experiences. The puzzle of why many cerebral processes occur with an accompanying experiential aspect in consciousness <b>seems</b> <b>impossible</b> to explain.|$|E

It <b>seems</b> <b>impossible</b> that the shattered Roman legions proclaimed emperor a traitor {{who was responsible}} for the loss of so many soldiers from their ranks. Another strong point against Gallus' treason {{is the fact that he}} adopted Hostilian, the younger son of Decius, after returning to Rome.|$|E

25|$|In {{classical}} theism, God {{is characterized}} as the metaphysically ultimate being (the first, timeless, absolutely simple and sovereign being, who is {{devoid of any}} anthropomorphic qualities), in distinction to other conceptions such as theistic personalism, open theism, and process theism. Classical theists {{do not believe that}} God can be completely defined. They believe it would contradict the transcendent nature of God for mere humans to define him. Robert Barron explains by analogy that it <b>seems</b> <b>impossible</b> for a two-dimensional object to conceive of three-dimensional humans.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{actively}} {{participating in}} the current discussions on evolutionary theory and genetics, Mosterín has also tackled issues like the definition of life itself or the ontology of biological organisms and species. Following in Aristotle’s and Schrödinger’s footsteps, he has been asking the simple question: what is life? He has analyzed the main proposed definitions, based on metabolism, reproduction, thermodynamics, complexity and evolution, and found all of them wanting. It is true that all organisms on Earth share many characteristics, from the encoding of genetic information in DNA to the storage of energy in ATP, but these common features merely reflect the inheritance from a common ancestor that possibly acquired them in a random way. From that point of view, our biology is the parochial science of life on Earth, rather than a universal science of life in general. Such a general biology <b>seems</b> <b>impossible,</b> {{as long as we}} do not detect and come to know other forms of life in the galaxy (if they exist). Concerning the ontological thesis of Michael Ghiselin and David Hull on the individuality of biological species, Mosterín shows that they are neither classes nor individuals in the usual meaning of these words. He tries to extend and make more precise the available conceptual framework of the discussion. Specifically, he shows the formal equivalence of the set-theoretical and the mereological (or part and individual) approach, so that everything that can be said about the classes can be translated into the jargon of individuals, and the other way around. All these concerns converge in his recent philosophy of animality, which combines the ontology of animals as paradigmatic individuals with the insights and results of biological research. This general theory of animals provides a solid foundation for the development of anthropology, conceived as the science of human primates.|$|E

[...] However, the court accepted his claim that he saved the lives of Allied POWs whose safety was gravely imperiled by Hitler's orders that they be shot or held as hostages. The court determined that Berger had disobeyed orders and placed himself in danger in order to intervene on behalf of the POWs in question. In contrast, Berger was found guilty of transporting Hungarian Jews to concentration camps and recruiting concentration camp guards. Berger also stated in his evidence that he considered Himmler [...] "an unassimilated half-breed and unfit for the SS".|$|E

500|$|From Russia, with Love {{is one of}} the few {{stories by}} Fleming in which the Soviets are the main enemy, {{although}} Eco considers Bond's Russian opponents [...] "so monstrous, so improbably evil that it <b>seems</b> <b>impossible</b> to take them seriously". Fleming introduced what was a new development for him, a female opponent for Bond, although much like the former adversaries in the series, Rosa Klebb is described as being physically repulsive, with poor hygiene and gross tastes. Eco—and Anthony Synnott, in his examination of aesthetics in the Bond novels—consider that despite Klebb being female, the character is more akin to a [...] "sexually neuter" [...] individual. Red Grant was Fleming's first [...] "psychotic opponent" [...] for Bond, according to Benson. Charlie Higson—who later wrote the Young Bond series—finds Grant to be [...] "a very modern villain: the relentless, remorseless psycho with the cold dead eyes of a 'drowned man'." ...|$|E
500|$|The subject {{addressed}} in the recording lyrics has led Spins critic, Chris Martins, to become [...] "slightly disappointed" [...] {{when he realized that}} [...] "the song was not, in fact, an ode to bootleg liquor", but a [...] "longing for the high water mark of a relationship that now <b>seems</b> <b>impossible</b> to reach", despite the fact that [...] "Mars’ lyrics intoxicate in their own way". The recording's composition brought attention due to its similarities to the works of Michael Jackson. Martins of Spin stated that the track finds Mars channeling [...] "the King of Pop with a markedly more reverent aplomb". Sam Lansky of Idolator concurred, writing that the artist is channeling [...] "80's pop icon: Michael Jackson". Nevertheless, Lansky discovered a [...] "a little bit of Prince in there", as well, [...] "but Mars’ vocals sound eerily like Jacko in his prime". The song has drawn comparisons to Daft Punk due to its [...] "disco groove", with Sarah Rodman from The Boston Globe calling the it [...] "wistful" [...] and Los Angeles Times Mikael Wood called it [...] "conflict-free tune" [...] gritting with [...] "desperation". Mars said that the primary influence for the track was American musician Prince.|$|E
500|$|Arguments for {{it being}} legally binding {{is based on}} several points. Firstly, the {{judiciary}} of the time were asked by Charles what standing they would give to the Petition were it passed; they concluded {{that it was a}} potentially legislative act. Charles's assent to the Petition was also made in Parliament, not in Whitehall, something normally done with statutes, and Henry Elsynge, the Clerk of the House of Commons, had the Petition placed on the statute rolls {{as if it were an}} Act of Parliament. It was later enforced by the courts; when Selden and other Members of Parliament were imprisoned, they cited the Petition as a reason to grant habeas corpus, something the judges accepted, and the ship money case, although a victory for Charles, was a victory in spite of the Petition rather than because of it; the judgment concluded that Charles's actions were acceptable under the Royal Prerogative, but would otherwise be in violation of the Petition. The final word remains elusive, since [...] "it <b>seems</b> <b>impossible</b> to establish conclusively which of these interpretations of the petition is correct. The Petition of Right of 1628 was a unique parliamentary act. It was interpreted differently by different people. And there are probably no absolute criteria by which its true nature can be determined".|$|E

500|$|Dumville, {{commenting on}} these {{attempts}} {{to establish the}} historicity of the poem in 1988, said, [...] "The case for authenticity, whatever exactly we mean by that, is not proven; {{but that does not}} mean that it cannot be." [...] Likewise, Patrick Sims-Williams concluded in 2016 that, 'evaluating the supposed proofs that poems in the Books of Aneirin and Taliesin cannot go back to the sixth century, we have found them either to be incorrect or to apply to only a very few lines or stanzas that may be explained as additions. It <b>seems</b> <b>impossible</b> to prove, however, that any poem must go back to the sixth century linguistically and cannot be a century or more later'. The fact that the great majority of the warriors mentioned in the poem are not known from other sources has been put forward by several authors as an argument against the idea that the poem could be a later composition. The poems which are known to be later [...] "forgeries" [...] have clearly been written for a purpose, for example to strengthen the claims of a particular dynasty. The men commemorated in Y Gododdin do not appear in the pedigrees of any Welsh dynasty. Breeze comments, [...] "it is difficult to see why a later poet should take the trouble to commemorate men who, but for the poem, would be forgotten".|$|E
