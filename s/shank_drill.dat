50|$|The SDS shank has the {{advantage}} of fitting into a simple spring-loaded chuck, so that bits are simply pushed into the chuck without tightening. This shank and chucks made for it are especially suited to hammer drilling with masonry drills in stone and concrete. The drill bit is not held solidly in the chuck, but can slide {{back and forth like a}} piston; it does not slip during rotation due to the non-circular shank cross-section, matching the chuck. The hammer of the drill acts to accelerate only the drill bit itself, and not the large mass of the chuck, which makes hammer drilling with an SDS <b>shank</b> <b>drill</b> bit much more productive than with other types of shank.|$|E
40|$|Glass Fibre Reinforced Plastic (GFRP) {{composite}} materials have wide applications {{in recent times}} due to their superior properties such as high specific strength and specific stiffness. These materials are most important and economic alternative to conventional materials. The main objective {{of this research is}} to analyse the experimental observations during drilling of Glass Fibre Reinforced Plastic composites using helical flute straight <b>shank</b> <b>drill</b> and ‘Brad and Spur ’ drill. The process parameters such as feed rate and cutting speed are considered for the experiment. The performances of drilling process are measured and analyzed in terms of thrust force, torque, delamination and specific cutting pressure. The effects of process parameters on the drilling performances are investigated in this study. It was observed from the analysis that thrust force and torque increases with feed rate, due to their increasing in shear area. Also the delamination factors (peel up & push out) increases with increase in thrust force. Specific cutting pressure durin...|$|E
40|$|A {{drill bit}} loader is {{described}} for loading a tapered <b>shank</b> of a <b>drill</b> bit into a similarly tapered recess {{in the end}} of a drill spindle. The spindle has a transverse slot at the inner end of the recess. The end of the tapered <b>shank</b> of the <b>drill</b> bit has a transverse tang adapted to engage in the slot so that the drill bit will be rotated by the spindle. The loader {{is in the form of}} a cylinder adapted to receive the drill bit with the shank projecting out of the outer end of the cylinder. Retainer pins prevent rotation of the drill bit in the cylinder. The spindle is lowered to extend the <b>shank</b> of the <b>drill</b> bit into the recess in the spindle and the spindle is rotated to align the slot in the spindle with the tang on the shank. A spring unit in the cylinder is compressed by the drill bit during its entry into the recess of the spindle and resiliently drives the tang into the slot in the spindle when the tang and slot are aligned. In typical remote drilling operations, whether in hot cells or water pits, drill bits have been held using a collet or end mill type holder with set screws. In either case, to load or change a drill bit required the use master-slave manipulators to position the bits and tighten the collet or set screws. This requirement eliminated many otherwise useful work areas because they were not equipped with slaves, particularly in water pits...|$|R
40|$|The {{drill head}} {{consists}} of a pointed end with cutting edges (5) {{on the ends of}} the flutes (3). The endface of the drill head, opposite the pointed end, incorporates a central blind hole (6). A separate drill shaft (2) has a cylindrical protrusion at its end which fits into the hole in the drill head to which it is attached by hard soldering. The drill head is made from a hard metal and is cut-of from a standard drill e. g by spark erosive machining which can also be used for making the hole in the endface of the head. The <b>drill</b> <b>shank</b> is made from a hardened steel. Aerospace Engineerin...|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Top: an {{assembled}} keyless chuck. This type of chuck is tightened by {{twisting the}} body using firm hand pressure only. While convenient, this feature {{can cause the}} chuck to loosen if too much torque is applied. Bottom: the widely used keyed type of drill chuck with its key. The arbor is shown separately to the right. These chucks require a toothed key to provide the necessary torque to tighten and loosen the jaws. When the key is turned its teeth mate with teeth on the chuck, turning an internal screw which in turn moves the threaded jaws in or out along a tapered surface. The taper allows the jaws to clamp <b>drill</b> <b>shanks</b> {{of a range of}} diameters. The end view shows the three small jaws that slide within the body.|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} enhancements {{of performance}} and energy efficiency of cutting tools by deposition of diamond-like carbon (DLC) coatings on machine parts. DLC was deposited on steel drill bits, using plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) with the acetylene precursor diluted with argon, to produce a surface with low friction and low wear rate. Drill bit performance in dry drilling of aluminium was quantified by analysis of power consumption and swarf flow. Optimised deposition conditions produced drill bits with greatly enhanced performance over uncoated drill bits, showing a 25 % reduction in swarf clogging, a 36 % reduction in power consumption and a greater than five-fold increase in lifetime. Surface analysis with scanning electron microscopy shows that DLC coated drills exhibit much lower aluminium build up on the trailing <b>shank</b> of the <b>drill,</b> enhancing the anti-adhering properties of the drill and reducing heat generation during operation, resulting in the observed improvements in efficiency. Variation of drilling efficiency with argon dilution of precursor is related {{to changes in the}} microstructure of the DLC coating...|$|R
40|$|Diploma work {{describes}} speed drill steels and its qualities {{before and}} after coating by methods PVD (Physical Vapour Deposition). The theoretic part is concerned with thermic processing of speed drill steels and their qualities with regard to individual alloying elements contained and its mechanical features. Second part of the theoretic part is concerned with particular methods of coating by the help of PVD technologies, kinds of coating with regard to additional elements and their qualities and surface treatments of coated material {{before and after}} its coating. The goal of the experimental part was the confrontation of cutting power features of cylindrical four-fluted face mills with straight <b>shank,</b> from speed <b>drill</b> steels non-coated and coated in two basic modes of milling – down-feed method and upfeed method. The results of measurements were interpreted by the help of four basic pictures (source values, power analysis, specific values). The result of all the experiment is that the application of PVD coatings enabled the increasing of cutting speed (with preservation of other cutting requirements) and led to decreasing of cutting force and cutting enforcements and extended durability of cutters...|$|R
5000|$|Under normal usage, swarf {{is carried}} {{up and away}} from the tip of the drill bit by the fluting of the drill bit. The cutting edges produce more chips which {{continue}} the movement of the chips outwards from the hole. This is successful until the chips pack too tightly, either because of deeper than normal holes or insufficient backing off (removing the drill slightly or totally from the hole while drilling). Cutting fluid is sometimes used to ease this problem and to prolong the tool's life by cooling and lubricating the tip and chip flow. Coolant may be introduced via holes through the <b>drill</b> <b>shank,</b> which is common when using a gun drill. When cutting aluminum in particular, cutting fluid helps ensure a smooth and accurate hole while preventing the metal from grabbing the drill bit in the process of drilling the hole. When cutting brass, and other soft metals that can grab the drill bit and causes [...] "chatter", a face of approx. 1-2 millimeters can be ground on the cutting edge to create an obtuse angle of 91 to 93 degrees. This prevents [...] "chatter" [...] during which the drill tears rather than cuts the metal. However, with that shape of bit cutting edge, the drill is pushing the metal away, rather than grabbing the metal. This creates high friction and very hot swarf.For heavy feeds and comparatively deep holes oil-hole drills are used in the drill bit, with a lubricant pumped to the drill head through a small hole in the bit and flowing out along the fluting. A conventional drill press arrangement can be used in oil-hole drilling, but it is more commonly seen in automatic drilling machinery in which it is the workpiece that rotates rather than the drill bit.|$|R
