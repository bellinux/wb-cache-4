The kit consists of two modules, the inertial guidance module and the <b>satellite</b> <b>guidance</b> module. The primary guidance system is the <b>satellite</b> <b>guidance</b> module, a technology reportedly to be reverse engineered from unexploded Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) ordnance in the NATO bombing of the People's Republic of China embassy in Belgrade, according to many Chinese military enthusiasts. A variety of <b>satellite</b> <b>guidance</b> can be used, such as GPS and GLONASS, as well as Chinese system Beidou navigation system, which will be usable in Asia-Pacific region in 2012. When <b>satellite</b> <b>guidance</b> is not available, the inertial guidance system is used, though the two systems are generally used together, complimenting each other.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. When {{navigating}} from landmarks, {{the numerical}} computation of the differential {{behavior of the}} mapping from measurements to states is well understood. This paper seeks to develop tools to foster an intuitive grasp of the spatial variation in the differential behavior of this mapping. Graphical methods are adapted from marine navigation in order to introduce the issues in low dimensional cases. The implicit function theorem and the pseudoinverse are then used in the general case to derive a quantity analogous to the geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) as it is used in <b>satellite</b> based <b>guidance.</b> An explicit expression is obtained for the conditioning of the triangulation computation {{as a function of}} position. This expression also directly provides the conditions under which the computation becomes singular. The application to a few common cases is illustrated. 1...|$|R

5000|$|The [...] "Spice" [...] munition is more {{advanced}} than most EO-guided bombs (GBU-15, for example), since it combines the advantages of <b>satellite</b> <b>guidance</b> (such {{as the ability to}} engage camouflaged and hidden targets; to provide a [...] "drop-and-forget" [...] option for several such targets simultaneously; and to operate in all weather and lighting conditions) and those of electro-optical guidance (such as the ability to provide [...] "man-in-the-loop" [...] guidance for extremely high precision; the ability to engage relocatable targets; lower CEP than that of satellite-guided munitions; and independence from external information sources like satellites) into one bomb - reducing the amount of munitions (and hence, payload) that an aircraft has to carry for a given strike mission, increasing its combat radius and maneuverability. This multiple guidance methods selectability is especially important in an [...] "information warfare" [...] battlefield, where an aircraft might approach a surface target while it is, for example, masked with smoke (in which case <b>satellite</b> <b>guidance</b> would be required) or moving around (in which case electro-optical guidance would be required).|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a novel guidance strategy {{that uses a}} randomized trajectory planning algorithm in a closed-loop fashion to provide robust motion planning and execution. By closing the guidance, navigation, and control loop around a randomized trajectory planning algorithm, a robotic vehicle can autonomously maneuver through a field of moving obstacles in a robust manner. The guidance strategy provides executable plans that are robust to known error sources when supplied with {{an estimate of the}} initial state, the goal, the predicted locations of obstacles, and bounds on error sources affecting the execution of a planned trajectory. The planning function presented in this thesis extends the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree algorithm to dynamic environments by exploring the configuration- x-time space using a node selection metric based on the maneuvering capability of the vehicle.

5000|$|Responding to after-action {{reports from}} pilots who {{employed}} laser and/or satellite guided weapons, Boeing {{has developed a}} Laser JDAM (LJDAM) to provide both types of guidance in a single kit. Based on the existing JDAM configurations, a laser guidance package is added to a GPS/INS guided weapon to increase the overall accuracy of the weapons. Raytheon has developed the Enhanced Paveway family, which adds GPS/INS guidance to their Paveway family of laser-guidance packages. These [...] "hybrid" [...] laser and GPS guided weapons permit the carriage of fewer weapons types, while retaining mission flexibility, because these weapons can be employed equally against moving and fixed targets, or targets of opportunity. For instance, a typical weapons load on an F-16 flying in the Iraq War included a single 2,000-lb JDAM and two 1,000-lb LGBs.

40|$|<b>Satellite</b> based <b>guidance</b> {{technology}} is a very challenging principle for future automation of agricultural machinery. The first generation types of systems are primarily self-contained solutions and added to the existing system set-up of the tractor. As being an important step towards robotics in agricultural machines, a better integration of this technology into the mechanical, hydraulic and especially the electronic architecture is a major issue. In principle, {{there are two main}} strategies for the integration. One is a concept based on a proprietary, manufacturer specific approach. The other one is to map as many functions as possible into the just state of the art becoming open and standardized ISOBUS. Within this paper, the capabilities of ISOBUS to be used for X-by-Wire applications are discussed from different point of views. In consequence, ISOBUS can only be used to create X-by-Wire applications with mechanical or hydraulic backup. Basic real-time capability with a reaction time of 100 ms seems to be achievable. However, some features of time-triggered protocols like determinism should be integrated by simulation on application layer level. Such concepts are the introduction of a heartbeat mechanism to serve as a coarse time synchronization and timeout reference. Additionally, the lack of unique and hard-wired addressing within ISOBUS demands new concepts like encryption algorithms. Based upon these theoretical considerations, a first proposal for a Steer-by-Wire approach via ISOBUS has been derived and implemented. First results are very promising, but further investigations like fault injection trials and extended network set-ups with pre-defined bus load scenarios are necessary...|$|R
5000|$|The Babur's {{guidance}} system uses {{a combination of}} inertial navigation systems (INS), terrain contour matching (TERCOM) and GPS <b>satellite</b> <b>guidance.</b> The {{guidance system}} reportedly gives the missile pinpoint accuracy. GPS access is not guaranteed under hostile conditions so the latest production models have also reportedly incorporated the Russian GLONASS.

[...] An upgraded variant tested on the 14 December 2016 included upgraded avionics where now the missile is able to accurately hit land and sea based targets {{without the aid of}} GPS. Also the missile is able to hit targets more accurately.|$|E
50|$|Another {{method is}} to target the missile by knowing the {{location}} of the target and using a guidance system such as INS, TERCOM or <b>satellite</b> <b>guidance.</b> This guidance system guides the missile by knowing the missile's current position and the position of the target, and then calculating a course between them. This job can also be performed somewhat crudely by a human operator who can see the target and the missile and guide it using either cable- or radio-based remote control, or by an automatic system that can simultaneously track the target and the missile.Furthermore, some missiles use initial targeting, sending them to a target area, where they will switch to primary targeting, using either radar or IR targeting to acquire the target.|$|E
50|$|The {{precision}} {{of these weapons}} is dependent both on the {{precision of}} the measurement system used for location determination and the precision in setting the coordinates of the target. The latter critically depends on intelligence information, not {{all of which is}} accurate. According to a CIA report, the accidental bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade during Operation Allied Force by NATO aircraft was attributed to faulty target information. However, if the targeting information is accurate, satellite-guided weapons are significantly more likely to achieve a successful strike in any given weather conditions than any other type of precision-guided munition.Other military <b>satellite</b> <b>guidance</b> systems include: Russian GLONASS, European Galileo (satellite navigation), Chinese BeiDou Navigation Satellite System, regional Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System, Japanese regional Quasi-Zenith Satellite System.|$|E
40|$|Issue BriefAs {{satellites}} become {{smaller and}} smarter, {{they will become}} increasingly capable of sophisticated operations in orbit. One class of operations "autonomous proximity operations" would allow satellites to inspect other satellites, diagnose malfunctions and provide on-orbit servicing. Such satellites could also provide sophisticated surveillance in space and would make excellent anti-satellite weapons. The rapid development of satellites capable of conducting close maneuvers to one another, in-orbit, may increase tension "suggesting that now may be the time to consider "rules of the road" for such operations. The Defense Technology Area Plan (2000) called for "the development of micro-satellite vehicles with significant capability" including the ability to "conduct missions such as diagnostic inspection of malfunctioning <b>satellites</b> through autonomous <b>guidance,</b> rendezvous, and even docking techniques.

50|$|The {{concept for}} {{autonomous}} vehicles {{has also been}} applied for commercial uses, like for autonomous or nearly autonomous trucks. As recorded in June 1995 in Popular Science Magazine, self-driving trucks were being developed for combat convoys, whereby only the lead truck would be driven by a human and the following trucks would rely on <b>satellite,</b> an inertial <b>guidance</b> system and ground-speed sensors. Caterpillar Inc. made early developments in 2013 with the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University to improve efficiency and reduce cost at various mining and construction sites.
