50|$|Lifelike {{mechanical}} arms, {{along with}} ordinary human arms, are so similar {{that it may}} be hard to distinguish between the two. The reason for this is because a spray, that places a coat on the prosthetic arm, makes the arm look real. This futuristic fantasy is beginning to become more of a reality. Scientists are even starting to create <b>sleeve</b> <b>type</b> artificial skins to keep a prosthetic arm looking like a normal arm.

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} effects of {{positioning}} and <b>sleeve</b> <b>type</b> bracing on passive position sense of shoulder joints of healthy untrained subjects. Method: A cross over study was carried out on 26 subjects (13 male, 13 female) with a proprioception measurement device. The selected method of testing was passive reproduction of a target angle. Both shoulder joints of all the subjects were evaluated with and without a compressive neoprene <b>sleeve</b> <b>type</b> of brace at two different start positions (45 ˚ internal rotation, 75 ˚external rotation) with an angular rotational movement at a constant speed of 0. 5 /̊s. The angular displacements from the target angles {{at the end of the}} reproduction tests were recorded as position sense deficit scores. Results: The overall mean (SD) deficit score (0. 99 (0. 06)) was significantly (p, 0. 001) lower with the brace than without, and the overall mean deficit score was significantly (p, 0. 001) higher at the 45 ˚ internal rotation start position than at the 75 ˚ external rotation start position. However, there was no significant (p. 0. 05) interaction between brace application and start position. Conclusion: Terminal limits of range of motion facilitate the position sense of shoulder joints. Compressive brace application improves the passive positioning sense possibly by stimulating cutaneous mechanoreceptors. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} the carbohydrate {{structure of the}} third component of complement (C 3) newly synthesized by cultured rat hepatocytes. When the cells were incubated with [3 H]mannose, [3 H]galactose or [3 H]glucosamine, these radioactive precursors were incorporated only into the alpha subunit of C 3, demonstrating that only the alpha subunit contains oligosaccharide chains. [3 H]Mannose-labelled C 3 was purified from the culture medium by immunoaffinity chromatography. Oligosaccharides prepared by Pronase digestion and strong alkaline hydrolysis were separated into two fractions by Bio-Gel P- 2 chromatography (Fractions I and II). The two fractions were analysed by concanavalin A-Sepharose chromatography, ion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography, and Bio-Gel P- 4 gel filtration before and after sequential exoglycosidase digestions. It was found that Fraction I contained two complex <b>type</b> oligosaccharide <b>chains,</b> (NeuAc) 2 (Gal) 2 (GlcNAc) 2 (Man) 3 (GlcNAc) 2 and (NeuAc) 3 (Gal) 3 (GlcNAc) 3 (Man) 3 (GlcNAc) 2, and Fraction II contained the high-mannose type, consisting mainly of (Man) 8 (GlcNAc) 2. Taken together with the carbohydrate composition of rat serum C 3, {{the results suggest that}} rat C 3 has one high-mannose <b>type</b> oligosaccharide <b>chain</b> and two complex <b>type</b> <b>chains</b> in the alpha subunit, which is different from the proposal for human C 3...|$|R

The antibody reacted only with A 1 erythrocytes in hemagglutination and antibody absorption assays; {{it did not}} react with A 2 erythrocytes, even after trypsin or sialidase treatment. This antibody detected, on TLC immunostaining, a series of glycolipids from A 1 erythrocytes but virtually none or very weak bands from A 2 erythrocytes.
