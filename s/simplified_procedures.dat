At this point, the US Army was {{about to embark on}} a national mobilization, and it was the task of the Construction Division of the Quartermaster Corps to prepare the necessary accommodations and training facilities for the vast army that would be created. The enormous construction program had been dogged by bottlenecks, shortages, delays, spiralling costs, and poor living conditions at the construction sites. Newspapers began publishing accounts charging the Construction Division with incompetence, ineptitude, and inefficiency. Farrell and Groves worked out new, <b>simplified</b> <b>procedures</b> for centralized procurement that provided the flexibility needed to get projects done on time with the accountability that such enormous expenditures demanded.

2500|$|Turkey is {{a transit}} point for illegal {{immigrants}} trying to reach Europe (as well as being a destination itself; see Immigration to Turkey for details). As a result of bilateral negotiations, a readmission agreement was signed between Turkey and Greece in November 2001 and {{went into effect in}} April 2002.

For nationals of the two countries the authorities can make use of <b>simplified</b> <b>procedures.</b> But the strict application of the agreement is reported to have retrograded as of 2003. Incidents concerning illegal immigration are frequent on the border of the two countries. Turkey, which is a transit point {{for illegal immigrants}} trying to reach Europe, has been accused {{of not being able to}} secure its borders with Greece. Since 1996 40 illegal immigrants have been killed by mines, after entering Greek territory in Evros. In 2001, about 800 illegal immigrants were rescued by the Greek coast guard after a fire broke out on board the Turkish-flagged Brelner, believed to have set sail from the Turkish port of İzmir, probably en route to Italy. According to Greek sources the Turkish authorities are tolerant of smugglers trafficking illegal immigrants into Greece; a notable such incident is the one of a trafficking boat, filmed in September 14, 2009 by the Latvian helicopter crew of Frontex patrolling near Farmakonisi island, during which [...] "it is clear that the Turkish coastguard, at best, does not prevent the [...] "slavetrade" [...] vessels to sail from its shores. At worst, it accompanies them into Greek territorial waters". The human trafficking into Greece through the Aegean Sea has been a documented, widespread phaenomenon while [...] "the failure, reported by Frontex, of Turkish officials to stop suspicious vessels as they leave, ensure that a steady stream of migrants reaches Lesbos and other islands in the Aegean".|$|E
