5|$|Julius Caesar {{mentions}} <b>small</b> <b>black</b> {{horses that}} resemble the Mérens in his Commentarii de Bello Gallico (Commentaries on the Gallic War), when discussing {{the defeat of}} Crassus by the Sotiates and their cavalry. Historian Paul Prunet {{was the first to}} link the animals discussed by Caesar to the Mérens, although the relationship has not been definitely established. The location of the Sotiates is the subject of controversy, with some authors placing them in the district of Nerac and others near Foix. The Mérens may have been used as a pack animal by the Romans, who may have taken some of the animals with them when they left. The <b>small</b> <b>black</b> horse from the Pyrenees is described throughout antiquity.|$|E

The Doctor arrives and he, Amy, and Rory {{are taken to}} UNIT headquarters, where Commander Kate Stewart {{explains}} {{that they have not}} been able to analyze the cubes' function. The Doctor waits with Amy and Rory for several days to monitor the situation, and gets to know Rory's father, Brian. The Doctor deems the cubes harmless and departs, though instructs Brian to keep watch.|$|E
5|$|The P. rebeli {{are noted}} for their large blue wings, with the males {{displaying}} a violet blue shade and the females displaying blue basal areas interspersed with brown spots, {{similar to other}} butterflies in its genus. The undersides of the butterfly are a dark brown with <b>small</b> <b>black</b> spots that are circled in white. It can be distinguished from its close relative, the P. alcon, by the broader black margins of the upperside male and the extensive blue basal areas in the females. It has a wingspan of approximately 32–36mm.|$|E

5|$|The local Cathars held {{a special}} place in their {{religion}} for horses, especially through their belief in the transmigration of souls. There was also a belief in Pamiers that knights took their horses with them when they died. In the 12th century, the Cathar princess Esclarmonde of Foix climbed to the fortress of Château de Montségur {{on the back of a}} small, sure-footed black horse. In the 14th century, the same <b>small</b> <b>black</b> horses are mentioned as accompanying the armies of Gaston III, Count of Foix.|$|E
5|$|The video's {{first scene}} {{is set in}} a desert at night. Rihanna, wearing a {{garrison}} cap, sunglasses, and a stylized white top, stands in front of an army. This scene is intercut with scenes of Rihanna in a bunker; she wears an army hard hat, pink lace up boots, and a skin-colored top with <b>small</b> <b>black</b> rectangles covering her breasts. Halfway through the first verse, the scene changes to a daytime desert scene in which Rihanna wears a low cut, short black dress with spiked shoulder pads, and walks through the location as small explosions occur around her.|$|E
5|$|A {{professional}} football career was unlikely for Willis when {{he graduated from}} Ohio State in 1945. While the exclusion of black players was not a written rule, no African-American had played in the National Football League since 1933. The gentlemen's agreement had been in effect ever since segregationist George Preston Marshall entered the league as owner of the Boston Redskins. In his physical prime but with no real prospect of playing professionally, Willis {{took a job as}} the head football coach at Kentucky State College in the fall of 1945. Kentucky State, an historically black school, played against other <b>small</b> <b>black</b> schools near its campus in Frankfort.|$|E

5|$|A transit of Venus {{across the}} Sun takes place when the planet Venus passes {{directly}} between the Sun and a superior planet, becoming visible against (and hence obscuring {{a small portion}} of) the solar disk. During a transit, Venus {{can be seen from}} Earth as a <b>small</b> <b>black</b> disk moving across the face of the Sun. The duration of such transits is usually several hours (the transit of 2012 lasted 6 hours and 40 minutes). A transit is similar to a solar eclipse by the Moon. While the diameter of Venus is more than 3 times that of the Moon, Venus appears smaller, and travels more slowly across the face of the Sun, because it is much farther away from Earth.|$|E
5|$|An unnamed narrator, while gazing {{upon his}} pet cat, begins to reminisce about {{a law in}} the town of Ulthar which forbids the killing of cats and relates the story of how this law came to be. The tale begins with the {{introduction}} of an old cotter and his wife who delight in trapping and violently killing any cats who venture onto their property. The people of the town are too afraid of the couple to speak against these acts, so they instead focus their efforts on keeping their felines from approaching the cotter's house. One night a caravan of travelers from a distant land arrives and passes through the village. They bring with them an orphan named Menes who, having lost his family to a plague, has only a <b>small,</b> <b>black</b> kitten to keep him company. After being unable to find his kitten on the third day of his stay, Menes hears the stories of the old cotter and his wife, and decides to take action.|$|E
5|$|Flambeau C (b. 1971) {{became a}} pillar of the French show jumping team in the 1980s. He participated in the 1984 Summer Olympics, where he took 7th individually, and the 1988 Summer Olympics, winning the bronze medal with the French team. The 1980s also saw the rise of Jappeloup (1975–1991), a <b>small</b> <b>black</b> horse with a {{conformation}} and gaits that were considered disadvantageous for show jumping. Despite this, he had an impressive jumping style, and won two French championships in 1982 and 1986, a European championship in 1987, several team medals at the European and World Championships, and a {{gold medal at the}} 1988 Summer Olympics with rider Pierre Durand, Jr.|$|E

5|$|The {{breeding}} male {{is bright}} russet or cinnamon red on its upperparts from its crown to its rump, {{with a black}} streaking on its mantle. It has a <b>small</b> <b>black</b> bib and black around its eye, separated from the russet of its crown by a very thin white supercilium, a stripe running from the bill {{to the rear of}} the head. The side of its neck and cheek are off-white, and its underparts are pale grey or washed with yellow, varying geographically. Shoulders and greater coverts are chestnut, and its median coverts are black at the base with white at the tips. The rest of the wing is light brown with black tinges. Its tail is blackish brown, edged with ashy brown. The non-breeding male differs little from the breeding male, being paler with more orange upperparts. The only species with which the male is easily confused is the Eurasian tree sparrow, which differs in its black cheek spot and brown back.|$|E
5|$|The {{black bean}} aphid (Aphis fabae) is a <b>small</b> <b>black</b> insect in the Aphis genus, with a broad, soft body, {{a member of}} the order Hemiptera. Other common names include blackfly, bean aphid and beet leaf aphid. In the warmer months of the year it is found in large numbers on the undersides of leaves and on the growing tips of host plants, {{including}} various agricultural crops and many wild and ornamental plants. Both winged and wingless forms exist and at this time of year, they are all females. They suck sap from stems and leaves and cause distortion of the shoots, stunted plants, reduced yield and spoiled crops. This aphid also acts as a vector for viruses that cause plant disease and the honeydew it secretes may encourage the growth of sooty mould. It breeds profusely by live birth but its numbers are kept in check, especially in the later part of the summer, by various predatory and parasitic insects. Ants feed on the honeydew it produces and take active steps to remove the aphid's enemies. It is a widely distributed pest of agricultural crops and can be controlled by chemical or biological means. In the autumn, winged forms move to different host plants where both males and females are produced. These mate and the females lay eggs which overwinter.|$|E
5|$|The first manga {{illustrated}} by Juri Misaki titled Clannad Official Comic was serialized in Jive's manga magazine Comic Rush between the May 2005 and April 2009 issues. Jive published eight tankōbon volumes between November 7, 2005 and March 7, 2009. The second manga, titled Official Another Story Clannad: Hikari Mimamoru Sakamichi de and {{illustrated by}} Rino Fujii, was serialized between June 21, 2007 and August 21, 2008 in Flex Comix's Comi Digi + magazine, and contained 11 chapters.

5|$|The {{smallest}} of the red robins, the red-capped robin is 10.5–12.5cm (4–5in) long with a wingspan of 15–19.5cm (6–8in), and weighs around 7–9g (0.25–0.31oz). Males and females are of similar size. It has longer legs than the other robins of the genus Petroica. The male has a distinctive scarlet cap and breast. Its upperparts are jet black with white shoulder bars, and its tail black with white tips. The underparts and shoulder are white. All colours are sharply delineated from one another. The female is an undistinguished grey-brown above with a reddish tint to the crown, and paler underneath with dark brown wings and pale buff wing patch. Some females have a reddish tint to the breast. Both sexes have a <b>small</b> <b>black</b> bill, and dark brown eyes and legs. Immature birds initially resemble the female; it is only with their second moult, which takes place at around or {{just over a year}} of age that males adopt their distinctive adult plumage. The red-capped robin moults once a year, after the breeding season which takes place between December and April.|$|E
5|$|Thought to have {{originated}} in prehistoric times, the exact {{early history of}} the Mérens remains a mystery. Theories on its origins include descent from Iberian horses, similar to many regional mountain horses, or possibly Oriental horses brought to the area by settlers from the east. <b>Small</b> <b>black</b> horses from the area of Ariège have been recorded {{as early as the}} time of Julius Caesar, as well as being associated with Charlemagne. They pulled artillery for Napoleon's Grand Army, as well as being used by farmers, dock workers, miners and smugglers moving goods through the Pyrenees mountains. They were frequently seen at local horse fairs, and were used to breed mules in a cross with Catalan donkeys. By the end of the 19th century, they had gained a reputation as light cavalry horses. At the same time, however, uncontrolled crossbreeding led to a decline in the purebred population, and in 1908 the local agricultural society was put in charge of the breed. The breed registry was created in 1933, and in 1948 the first stud book was created {{under the control of the}} French National Stud.|$|E
25|$|A pest which spreads through {{olive trees}} {{is the black}} scale bug, a <b>small</b> <b>black</b> scale insect that resembles a <b>small</b> <b>black</b> spot.
