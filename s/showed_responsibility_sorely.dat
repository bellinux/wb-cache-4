5000|$|EFD is a used {{modeling}} {{technique for}} {{the representation of}} enterprise functions and corresponding interactions. Different business processes can be modeled in these representations {{through the use of}} [...] "function modules" [...] and triggers. A starting business process delivers different inputs to different functions. A process flowing through all the functions and sub-functions creates multiple outputs. Enterprise function diagrams hereby give a very easy-to-use and detailed representation about a business process and corresponding functions, inputs, outputs and triggers.In this way EFD has many similarities with IDEF0 diagrams, which also represent in a hierarchical way business processes as a combination of functions and triggers. Difference is that an EFD places the business functions in an organization hierarchical perspective, which outlines the downstream of certain processes in the organization. On the contrary, IDEF0 diagrams <b>show</b> <b>responsibilities</b> of certain business functions through the use of arrows. Also, IDEF0 has a clear representation of inputs and outputs of every (sub)function.|$|R

Hofstede raises {{the idea that}} society's expectations of Individualism/Collectivism will be reflected by the employee inside the organization. Collectivist societies will have more emotional dependence on members in their organizations; when in equilibrium an organization is expected to <b>show</b> <b>responsibility</b> to members. Extreme individualism {{is seen in the}} US. In fact, collectivism in the US is seen as [...] "bad". Other cultures and societies than the US will therefore seek to resolve social and organizational problems in ways different from American ways. Hofstede says that a capitalist market economy fosters individualism and competition, and depends on it, but individualism is also related {{to the development of the}} middle class. Some people and cultures might have both high individualism and high collectivism. For example, someone who highly values duty to his or her group does not necessarily give a low priority to personal freedom and self-sufficiency.|$|R

40|$|Gambling {{availability}} {{has increased}} {{as well as}} the number of people gambling. Within gambling, addiction has become a growing problem, affecting both the gambling business {{as well as the}} individuals. This situation forces companies to balance their profit with responsible action in order to prevent gambling addiction. This thesis examines why and how gambling companies differ in their methods to help players avoid addiction in order to establish a sustainable society. A multiple case-study has been carried out, where three gambling companies have been examined and analyzed. The companies are Svenska Spel, Norsk Tipping and Unibet. The survey is based on interviews with representatives from the companies working in the departments of Responsible gambling or CSR. The conclusions of this study show that gambling companies can profit both economically and establish good will, if they <b>show</b> <b>responsibility.</b> Gambling companies differ in how they handle addiction, mainly because of diffuse concepts as CSR and Responsible Gambling. If gambling companies cooperate actively between themselves as well as with research of addiction, a balanced, sustainable society may be reached. Discussions of solving the problem of gambling addiction can preferably continue in order to reach a sustainable society...|$|R

The baseline characterization is achieved via compartmentalization and technical integration of subsystems, design functions, and discipline functions. First, a global design process overview is provided in order to <b>show</b> <b>responsibility,</b> interactions, and connectivity of overall aspects of the design process. Then design essentials are delineated in order to emphasize necessary features of the design process that are sometimes overlooked. Finally the design process characterization is presented. This is accomplished by considering project technical framework, technical integration, process description (technical integration model, subsystem tree, design/discipline planes, decision gates, and tasks), and the design sequence. Also included in the document are a snapshot relating to process improvements, illustrations of the process, a survey of recommendations from experienced practitioners in aerospace, lessons learned, references, and a bibliography...|$|R
