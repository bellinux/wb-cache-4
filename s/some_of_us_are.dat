500|$|Of the Chicago {{production}} at American Theater company, Chicago Tribune theatre critic Chris Jones praised {{the show as}} [...] "intensely arresting." [...] Time Out Chicago Kris Vire called the play [...] "a compact, stunning gut punch addressing the cultural affinities <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> allowed to escape and those we aren't." [...] However, Chicago Sun-Times critic Hedy Weiss noted that the plays five characters were all [...] "identity-warped", and the show was a [...] "minefield... that feels all too deliberately booby-trapped by the playwright." [...] The play won the Jeff Award—honoring excellence in Chicago Theater—for Best New Play in Chicago 2012.|$|E
500|$|With {{his career}} on hold, Hunt {{continued}} recording new songs and demos, posting {{them on his}} MySpace page, while Popular gained exposure among listeners through online music sharing. In 2009, he released the compilation album Use in Case of Emergency as a free download through his website. It featured previously unreleased material recorded by Hunt prior to Popular. He also continued touring, worked on an autobiographical book of short stories, entitled Tales of Friction, and studied classical piano. Hunt also took up photography after his girlfriend purchased him a camera. He started {{out on the streets}} of Los Angeles, where he photographed subjects on street corners and discarded objects, including furniture and numerous couches he found abandoned on the streets. In an interview for PopMatters, he explained how his photographying of people there inspired him: [...] "It's sad as you can quite imagine. It's also kind of welcoming to me. Sometimes I do get {{a chance to talk to}} them and hear a bit of their story. I'm not the only one out here who had an idea of trying to make it happen. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> luckier than others. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> more prepared than others. That's just the truth of the situation." [...] Along with photography, he was stimulated creatively after reading Legs McNeil's 1997 book Please Kill Me: The Uncensored Oral History of Punk and relating to its themes of artistic frustration and rebelliousness.|$|E

Despite this, Shears stated, [...] "I don't believe sexuality really matters when it comes to music." [...] In an interview featured on the We Are Scissor Sisters...

2500|$|In 2004, Alaska {{composer}} Philip Munger wrote a cantata about Corrie called The Skies are Weeping, {{which was}} scheduled to premiere on April 27 at the University of Alaska Anchorage, where Munger teaches. After objections to the upcoming performance were received, including {{from members of the}} Jewish community, a forum was held co-chaired by Munger and a local rabbi who claimed the work [...] "romanticized terrorism". After the forum [...] "disintegrate", Munger announced, [...] "I cannot subject 16 students ... to any possibility of physical harm or to the type of character assassination <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> already undergoing. Performance of The Skies are Weeping at this time and place is withdrawn {{for the safety of the}} student performers." [...] Munger later related that he had received threatening e-mails whose content he considered was [...] " [...] short of what you'd take to the troopers", and that some of his students had received similar communications. The cantata was eventually performed at the Hackney Empire theatre in London, premiering on November 1, 2005.|$|E
2500|$|In Echlin's {{article in}} The Guardian, six reasons for {{choosing}} polyamory are identified: a drive towards female independence and equality driven by feminism; disillusionment with monogamy; a yearning for community; honesty and realism {{in respect of}} relational nature of human beings; human nature; and individual non-matching of the traditional monogamous stereotype. Jim Fleckenstein, director of the Institute for 21st-Century Relationships, is quoted as stating that the polyamory movement has been driven not only by science fiction, but also by feminism: [...] "Increased financial independence means that women can build relationships {{the way they want}} to." [...] The disillusionment with monogamy is said to be [...] "because of widespread cheating and divorce". The longing for community is associated with a felt need for the richness of [...] "complex and deep relationships through extended networks" [...] in response to the replacement and fragmentation of the extended family by nuclear families. [...] "For many", Echlin writes, [...] "it is a hankering for community... we have become increasingly alienated, partly because of the 20th century's replacement of the extended family with the nuclear family. As a result, many of us are striving to create complex and deep relationships through extended networks of multiple lovers and extended families... Polys agree that some people are monogamous by nature. But <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> not, and more and more are refusing to be shoehorned into monogamy." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{will begin}} early – before <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> up, no doubt, {{and it will}} {{continue}} late. [...] The sidewalks will be worse obstructed in every street than Wall-street is where the brokers are in full blast. Old beds and ricketty bedstands, handsome pianos and kitchen furniture, will be chaotically huddled together. [...] Everything {{will be in a}} muddle. Everybody in a hurry, smashing mirrors in his haste, and carefully guarding boot boxes from harm. Sofas that go out sound will go in maimed, tables that enjoyed castors will scratch along and [...] "tip" [...] on one less than its complement. [...] Bed-screws will be lost in the confusion, and many a good piece of furniture badly bruised in consequence. [...] Family pictures will be sadly marred, and the china will be a broken set before night, in many a house. All houses will be dirty – never so dirty – into which people move, and the dirt of the old will seem enviable beside the cleanliness of the new. [...] The old people will in their hearts murmur at these moving dispensations. The younger people, though aching in every bone, and [...] "tired to death," [...] will relish the change, and think the new closets more roomy and more nice, and delight themselves fancying how this piece of furniture will look here and that piece in the other corner. The still [...] "younger ones" [...] will still more enjoy it. [...] Into the cellar and upon the roof, into the rat-holes and on the yard fence, into each room and prying into every cupboard, they mill make reprisals of many things [...] "worth saving," [...] and mark the day white in their calendar, as little less to be longed for in the return than Fourth of July itself.Keep your tempers, good people. Don't growl at the carmen nor haggle over the price charged. When the scratched furniture comes in don't believe it is utterly ruined, – a few nails, a little glue, a piece of putty, and a pint of varnish will rejuvenate many articles that will grow very old 'twixt morning and night, and undo much of the mischief that comes of moving, and which at first sight seems irreparable.|$|E

5000|$|In May 1974, the Genesis line-up of Peter Gabriel, Tony Banks, Mike Rutherford, Phil Collins and Steve Hackett wrapped their 1973-74 tour {{to support}} their fifth album, Selling England by the Pound (1973). In the {{following}} month, they booked three months at Headley Grange in Headley, East Hampshire to write and rehearse new material for their next album. Upon their arrival, the building {{was in a state}} left by the previous band with excrement on the floor and rat infestations. Both Collins and Hackett admitted to having issues with sleeping. By this time, the personal lives <b>of</b> <b>some</b> members started to affect the mood in the band which started to cause complications. Hackett explained: [...] "Everybody had their own agenda. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> married, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> had children, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> getting divorced.

6000|$|It was to {{the effect}} that {{although}} it was the Son of George whom Dingaan wanted, his orders were that all with him were to be taken also. Those orders could not be disobeyed.
