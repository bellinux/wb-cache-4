5|$|In March 1950 the {{municipality}} decided definitely {{to close the}} tramway, but its actual closure came somewhat later.

5|$|A Welsh shipbroker, W. J. Orders, {{organised}} {{a collection}} fund {{on the floor}} of the Cardiff Coal Exchange and floated a public testimonial of one shilling. The national response was considerable and within weeks the total was into hundreds of pounds. This drew the Welsh Football Union (WFU) into a confrontation with the IRFB, as rule 2 on professionalism stated that no player was allowed to receive money from his club, or any member of his club, for <b>services</b> <b>rendered</b> to football. The fund could have been seen as a professional fee to Gould, henceforth making him ineligible to play for his country. The WFU argued that the money raised was not given by the club, but rather an outpouring of thanks from the Welsh public to a national hero.|$|E

Paul hires Marty Kranic (Darius Perkins) to take care of Robbo, who is later hit by a car. Paul pays Marty off for <b>services</b> <b>rendered.</b> Jack Lassiter (Alan Hopgood) returns to Erinsborough and warns Paul about putting business before family.

5|$|The Alamanni high kings now {{ordered a}} mass {{mobilisation}} {{of all the}} confederation's member tribes, gathering their bands at Strasbourg. In addition, they received the timely support of the Alamanni cantons near Raetia that had been pacified by Constantius in 355. Their leaders were overthrown in an anti-Roman coup by their optimates. Gundomad was slain and Wadomar forced at sword-point to break his treaty and lead his warriors to join Chnodomar. Finally, they summoned the assistance of certain non-Alamanni tribes (probably Burgundians), partly for <b>services</b> <b>rendered</b> in the past, partly for payment. At Strasbourg on the Rhine (about 32km SE of Saverne), they gathered a combined force of some 35,000 men, according to Ammianus. This figure may be an exaggeration, but the exceptional size of the levy is shown {{by the presence of}} all the Alamanni kings and the report that German bands were crossing the Rhine to Strasbourg continuously for three days and nights. Their aim was to bring Julian to battle and crush him by sheer weight of numbers. They provoked Julian by sending him an ultimatum to evacuate Alsace immediately.|$|E
