The Sb atoms are observed to diffuse into the Si capping layer at concentrations much higher than the solid solubility limit in a Si crystal. In addition, the concentration of diffused Sb atoms does not show a monotonic decrease with increasing distance from the delta-layer plane. The lattice locations of the diffused Sb atoms are found to be strongly dependent on the distance from the original Sb delta-layer. Correspondences are found between defects in Si crystals and the depth profile and the lattice location of Sb atoms.

40|$|Surface Light <b>Scattering</b> <b>Spectroscopy</b> of the Gallium Liquid-Vapor Interface Vladimir Kolevzon Abstract High {{frequency}} capillary {{waves at}} liquid Ga surface {{have been studied}} by means of quasielastic light <b>scattering</b> <b>spectroscopy.</b> The observed frequencies and damping constants of waves differed greatly from classical theoretical treatment of liquid Ga surface {{as that of a}} simple liquid. This effect was explained due to the presence of the surface layer, possessing visco-elastic properties extracted, for the first time, from the fit of experimental spectra with an appropriate theoretical form. Negative value of the surface dilational viscosity has been derived for all wavenumbers studied. At high wavenumbers q the wave dispersion behavior is best likely linked to the weak coupling between dilational and capillary modes, while at low and moderate q the experimental data resemble to the mixed oscillations. This behavior is consistent with an influence of diffusion and adsorption on the waves propagation...|$|R

The NASA Smart Probe extends the concept of 'optical biopsy' by using neural network techniques to combine the output from 3 microsensors contained within a cannula 2. 7 mm in diameter (i. e. the diameter of a stereotactic brain biopsy needle).

40|$|Laser light <b>scattering</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> {{is based}} on the {{evaluation}} of the frequency shift of coherent light scattered by moving particles. This makes it particularly suitable for use in light guiding systems. In this study laser light <b>scattering</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> was assessed for its ability to provide information on the motility of respiratory cilia. In vitro and in vivo measurements were undertaken with animal tracheal mucosa. The intensity fluctuations of laser light scattered from moving cilia were analysed in terms of their autocorrelation functions to provide information on the frequency and synchrony of beating cilia. In vitro measurements were performed on fresh bovine trachea to estimate a safe laser power level for mucosal exposure and to test the method by defining the temperature dependence of the ciliary beat frequency. Power densities not exceeding 0. 3 kW/cm 2 were found to be the upper limit for long term exposure of the mucosa in vitro. Ciliary beat frequency showed a pronounced temperature dependence, ranging from 5. 8 to 28. 3 Hz over the temperature range 20 - 43. 5 degrees C. A maximum frequency was found at 41. 5 degrees C. In vivo measurements of ciliary activity were performed in six pigs by means of optical fibres for light transmission combined with fibreoptic bronchoscopy. A ciliary beat frequency of 5 Hz was obtained; heart and breathing frequencies could be separated and identified.
