50|$|The {{multi-mode}} switch {{consists of}} three settings: Off, Signal, and On. When the switch is set to Signal, the user is able to press and hold a button located just above the switch to turn the light on, and it will switch off again when the button is released. This allows users to signal using Morse code. When the switch is moved up to the On position, the flashlight remains on without any further user interaction. The modern MX-991/U also features a <b>switch</b> <b>guard</b> which was not present in previous variants as issued in the Vietnam War. The <b>switch</b> <b>guard</b> was suggested as an improvement from soldiers during the war, and later added to prevent unintentional operation of the flashlight. This helped to prevent soldiers from accidentally giving their position away in the dark should equipment, clothing etc press the signal button or move the switch.|$|E

5000|$|Deception: Strikers use feints or distractions to {{disguise}} the timing or direction of their attacks. Stomping the foot, noise, frequent hand movement, head movement, <b>switching</b> the <b>guard</b> position, etc. are common feints. Using feints, then attacking at multiple levels and with various techniques may help deceive the opponent, defeating their guard.|$|R

50|$|The {{pick and}} roll is often {{employed}} by a shorter guard handling {{the ball and}} a taller forward or center setting the screen; if the taller defender <b>switches</b> to <b>guard</b> the ballhandler, then the offensive team can have favorable mismatches. The shorter guard has a speed advantage over the taller defender, while the taller forward has a size advantage over the shorter defender.|$|R
5000|$|Howe had mused {{over the}} {{possibility}} of <b>switching</b> German <b>guards</b> with British imposters. His comments were not lost on Bissell, who quickly noticed the physical similarities between Sinclair {{and one of the}} German guard commanders, Stabsfeldwebel (Sergeant Major) Fritz Rothenberger, who was better known to the prisoners and guards as [...] "Franz Josef" [...] for his strong resemblance to Franz Josef, the former Austrian Emperor.|$|R
50|$|Melander {{played for}} the University of Minnesota Golden Gophers from 1986 to 1989, {{starting}} as a defensive end before <b>switching</b> to <b>guard</b> just before his junior year. Melander {{earned a degree in}} business management with an emphasis in finance from the Carlson School of Management in 1989. From 2000 to 2004, Melander's nephew, Rian, was an All Big Ten offensive tackle for the Golden Gophers. His uncle, Raymond, also played football for the Gophers.|$|R

40|$|Time and {{wavelength}} division multiplexed passive optical networks (TWDM-PONs) {{have been}} widely considered {{as one of the}} next evolutionary steps of optical access networks. A variety of algorithms exists that explore the problem of scheduling and wavelength assignment in TWDM-PONs. These algorithms, however, allow unlimited switching of wavelengths. In reality, wavelength <b>switching</b> increases <b>guard</b> bands due to the tuning and the switching time of components, limiting channel utilization and increasing packet delays. We propose a novel dynamic bandwidth allocation (DBA) algorithm for TWDM-PON that minimizes the performance degradation due to excessive wavelength switching...|$|R
5000|$|Many {{spacecraft}} use {{a form of}} dead man's <b>switch</b> to <b>guard</b> against command system failures. A timer {{is established}} that is normally reset by the receipt of any valid command (including one whose sole function is to reset the timer.) If the timer expires, the spacecraft enters a [...] "command loss" [...] algorithm that cycles through a predefined sequence of hardware and/or software modes (such as {{the selection of a}} backup command receiver) until a valid command is received. The spacecraft may also enter a safe mode to protect itself while waiting for further commands.|$|R

40|$|For {{efficient}} {{utilization of}} bandwidth in optical packet <b>switching,</b> the <b>guard</b> time Tg between packets {{should only be}} {{a small fraction of}} the packet transmission time Td. Since the guard time Tg of existing packet switching approaches must be larger than the reconfiguration time Tsw of optical switches, this imposes a stringent demand on the switch reconfiguration time Tsw as the transmission rate of optical fibers increases. By using batch transfer of packets or multiple switching fabrics in parallel, the requirement on the switch reconfiguration time can be significantly relaxed. The utilization of the transmission links can be greatly improved because the guard time between packets is no longer constrained by the switch reconfiguration time. © 2009 IEEE. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
5000|$|The player {{uses the}} {{joystick}} {{to move around}} the ring, as well as three buttons: face punch, body punch, and block punch. During a bout, the block punch button protects the player's fighter from enemy attacks and <b>switches</b> the character's <b>guard</b> between face and body each time it's pressed. The two punch buttons may be used alternately to pull out combinations or a special, more powerful [...] "Super Punch".|$|R
50|$|One {{method for}} {{mitigating}} {{this type of}} attack {{is to use the}} IP source guard feature available on many ethernet <b>switches.</b> The IP <b>guard</b> initially blocks all traffic except DHCP packets. When a client receives a valid IP address from the DHCP server the IP address and switch port relationship are bound in an Access Control List (ACL). The ACL then restricts traffic only to those IP addresses configured in the binding.|$|R
50|$|This {{season was}} {{highlighted}} by the individual performance of Stephen Curry, who was the nation's leading scorer after making the <b>switch</b> from Shooting <b>Guard</b> to Point Guard positions. He averaged 28.6 Points per Game and 5.6 Assists per Game. Stephen this season also took the title of all-time leading career point-scorer from former All-American John Gerdy. A {{few months after the}} season, Stephen announced his entry into the 2009 NBA Draft, ending his Davidson career.|$|R
50|$|According to PWD officials, {{the company}} that {{operated}} the ropeway had reinstated it. But before it started functioning, the forest department had asked the PWD to carry out an inspection and issue a certificate of fitness. Devices like limit <b>switches,</b> rope-catches and <b>guards</b> would be electrically operated and any flaw in the system would automatically halt the entire service. Such a system mitigates accidents due to human error and safeguards against the possibility of another catastrophe.|$|R
25|$|Detroit {{finished}} the 1954 regular season {{on top of}} the NFL West and again faced the Browns in the championship game, but lost by a score of 56–10. Martin <b>switched</b> from <b>guard</b> to linebacker the following year, when Detroit had a losing record. The team improved in 1956, however, and won another NFL championship over the Browns in 1957. Martin stayed with the Lions through the 1961 season. A strong placekicker, Martin was used primarily on kickoffs and on field goals in his later seasons in Detroit. In 1960, he became the first player in NFL history to kick two field goals longer than 50 yards in one game. He was selected for the Pro Bowl, the NFL's annual all-star game, in 1961 after leading the team in scoring with 15 field goals and 25 extra points.|$|R
