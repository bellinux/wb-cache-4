50|$|At about 8:15 a.m. on Wednesday 13 March 1996, Thomas Hamilton, aged 43, {{was seen}} {{scraping}} ice off his van outside his home at Kent Road in Stirling. He left soon afterwards and drove about 5 mi north to Dunblane. He {{arrived on the}} grounds of Dunblane Primary School at around 9:30 a.m. and parked his van near a telegraph pole in the car park of the school. Hamilton cut the cables {{at the bottom of the}} telegraph pole, which served nearby houses, with a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>pliers</b> before making his way across the car park towards the school buildings.|$|E
5000|$|Concerns {{were raised}} by some within the Thai establishment. General Pathomphong Kasornsuk, the former chief advisor of the Supreme Command, urged Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva to {{investigate}} the procurement scheme for the GT200 devices and {{other elements of the}} counter-insurgency campaign in southern Thailand. Jetsada Denduangboripan, a scientist at Chulalongkorn University, told a committee of the House of Representatives of Thailand in January 2010 that [...] "The GT200 cannot detect explosives. It is not scientific equipment. It works on the users' hunch. It is similar to a wood stick that people used to detect dead bodies buried in a cemetery." [...] He used a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>pliers,</b> a radio antenna and a piece of paper to produce a [...] "bomb detector" [...] that he said worked just as effectively as the GT200. The House committee on national security said that it would investigate the GT200 further and set up an inquiry into its effectiveness that would involve the military and scientists.|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} {{ultrahigh}} vacuum (UHV) three-probe {{scanning tunneling microscope}} in which each probe is capable of atomic resolution. A UHV JEOL scanning electron microscope aids in {{the placement of the}} probes on the sample. The machine also has a field ion microscope to clean, atomically image, and shape the probe tips. The machine uses bare conductive samples and tips with a homebuilt <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>pliers</b> for heating and loading. Automated feedback controlled tip-surface contacts allow for electrical stability and reproducibility while also greatly reducing tip and surface damage due to contact formation. The ability to register inter-tip position by imaging of a single surface feature by multiple tips is demonstrated. Four-probe material characterization is achieved by deploying two tips as fixed current probes and the third tip as a movable voltage probe. 9 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

40|$|Photograph {{of women}} workers {{handling}} panels of coils in an unidentified electronics office, ca. 1950. At center, {{a group of}} four women can be seen huddled {{around one of the}} ends of a large rectangular table. The three women around the sides of the table can be seen sitting on a large stool, while the woman {{on the end of the}} table is seen standing over her equipment. At the center of the table, two large slanted boxes are seen. One of the boxes is shown carrying nine smaller boxes filled with various pins and wires. Across from the two women seen in the foreground, a small panel with a raised axle at its center can be seen. The axle supports part of a square panel, and several coils are visible hanging from the panel. Also on the side of the table, a small wooden attachment holding two <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>pliers</b> and a screwdriver can be seen for each woman. The woman on the end of the table is seen gripping a small cylindrical object in her hands while standing over the panel of coils. A small metallic cylinder is also visible hanging near the edge of the table. In the extreme foreground, a large wooden box is seen supporting a smaller wooden box and a rag. In the extreme background, a large line of overhead lights are visible...|$|R

40|$|Many motor {{learning}} studies {{focus on}} average performance {{while it is}} known from everyday life experience that humans differ in their way of learning new motor tasks. This study emphasises the importance of recognizing individual differences in motor learning. We studied individual tool grasping profiles of individuals who learned to pick up objects with a novel tool, a pair <b>of</b> <b>pliers.</b> The pair <b>of</b> <b>pliers</b> {{was attached to the}} thumb and the index finger so that the tip of the thumb and the tip of the index finger were displaced to the beaks of the pair <b>of</b> <b>pliers.</b> The grasp component was manipulated by varying the location of the hinge of the pair <b>of</b> <b>pliers,</b> which resulted in different relations between beak opening and closing and finger opening and closing. The Wider Beak group had the hinge at 7 cm, the Same Beak group had the hinge at 10 cm (i. e., in the middle), and the Smaller Beak group had the hinge at 13 cm from the digits. Each group consisted of ten right-handed participants who picked up an object with one of the pairs <b>of</b> <b>pliers</b> 200 times on two subsequent days. Hand opening, plateau phase, hand closing, grasping time and maximum aperture were analyzed. To characterize individual changes over practice time, a log function was fitted on these dependent variables and the ratio of improvement was determined. Results showed that at the beginning stage of tool use learning the characteristic grasping profile consisted of three phases; hand opening, plateau phase and hand closing. Over practicing individual participants differed in the number of phases that changed, the amount of change in a phase and/or the direction of change. Moreover, with different pliers different learning paths were found. The importance of recognizing individual differences in motor learning is discussed...|$|R

50|$|As pliers in {{the general}} sense are an ancient and simple invention, no single point in history, or inventor, can be credited. Early metal working {{processes}} from several millennia BCE would have required plier-like devices to handle hot materials {{in the process of}} smithing or casting. Development from wooden to bronze pliers would have probably happened sometime prior to 3000 BCE. Among the oldest illustrations <b>of</b> <b>pliers</b> are those showing the Greek god Hephaestus in his forge. The number of different designs <b>of</b> <b>pliers</b> grew with the invention of the different objects which they were used to handle: horseshoes, fasteners, wire, pipes, electrical, and electronic components.|$|R
50|$|The {{basic design}} <b>of</b> <b>pliers</b> has changed little since their origins, with {{the pair of}} handles, the pivot (often formed by a rivet), and the head section with the {{gripping}} jaws or cutting edges forming the three elements.|$|R

50|$|In Mexico, Karyn tracks down Chris Halloran, {{the family}} friend who helped her {{during her first}} ordeal in Drago. She tells him that the werewolves of Drago have come for her and she needs his help once more. However, Chris's new girlfriend, Audrey, is jealous of his prior {{relationship}} with Karyn and does everything she can to undermine their friendship. When Roy and Marcia finally track Karyn down to Mexico, they set a trap for her at a Gypsy wagon with Audrey's unwitting help, and close in for the kill. Again, Chris comes to Karyn's rescue and fights with Roy (who {{takes the form of}} a wolf). Chris eventually manages to kill Roy with a silver knife, but in the nearby Gypsy wagon, Marcia is holding Karyn hostage and is about to torture her using a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> red hot <b>pliers</b> to pull the flesh off of her body a pinch at a time. However, as the full moon rises, Marcia abruptly begins her agonizing change into the half-human/half-wolf creature. She drops the pliers, which then cause a fire to break out in the wagon, allowing Karyn to escape. Outside, Karyn is reunited with Chris while Marcia (or the creature she has become) burns to death as the wagon goes up in flames.|$|R

5000|$|Being able to {{estimate}} an object's size {{in order to}} pick it up involves an integration of visual information and motor control. Upon viewing implied motion depicting the handles of a pair <b>of</b> <b>pliers</b> either opening or closing, participants change their physical hand grip size in keeping with representational momentum, anticipating the future position of the handles. [...] While the hand action anticipates the continued opening (or closing) <b>of</b> the <b>pliers,</b> visual judgments <b>of</b> the object's final handle position consistently underestimate the opening, indicating that the relationship between visual judgments and subsequent physical acts is not straightforward.|$|R
