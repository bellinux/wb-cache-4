Here we compared the effects of furrow and subsurface drip at different irrigation rates, based on a percentage of daily crop-evapotranspiration rates (ETc), on run-off and off-site movement of suspended sediment, nutrients and pesticides from cotton crops grownon a vertisol. Our results show that furrow irrigation significantly increased suspended soil loss, of 5. 26 t ha− 1, {{compared to that of}} <b>subsurface</b> drip <b>irrigation</b> at 120 % of ETc, of 2. 53 t ha− 1, whereas no erosion was recorded with deficit <b>subsurface</b> drip <b>irrigation.</b> Off-site movement of nitrogen in furrow, of 18. 63 kg ha− 1, was five times greater than <b>subsurface</b> drip <b>irrigation</b> at 120 % ETc. It was much less with 105 % ETc(0. 37 kg ha− 1) and 90 % ETc (0. 15 kg ha− 1), and absent for 75 % and 50 % of ETc. Phosphorus loss from furrow, of 778 g ha− 1, was greater than for the wetter subsurface drip treatments that gave 23 g ha− 1 for 90 % ETc and 19 g ha− 1 for 120 % ETc. No P loss was recorded from drier <b>subsurface</b> drip <b>irrigation</b> rates.

One important segment of the <b>subsurface</b> <b>irrigation</b> system that has not been thoroughly developed is the knowledge of flow and distribution patterns of the water after it is injected into the soil. The purpose of this study was to learn how to predict the interaction between the growing plant and the placement of a lateral in a <b>subsurface</b> <b>irrigation</b> system to properly design and manage a <b>subsurface</b> <b>irrigation</b> system. Two greenhouse type plexiglass soil bin models were built and instrumented with electrical resistance blocks as soil moisture sensors. Silty clay loam was used as irrigable soil. Irrigation water was applied through ½ inch I. D. polyethylene tube placed at depths of 18 -inches and 12 -inches below the soil surface. Wetting front movement patterns were photographed. Volumes of water applied were noted for calculating the model intake rates at their corresponding time values. Sorghum plants were grown on the model for determining soil moisture extraction patterns for various stages of plant growth. Heights of the plants and stem diameters of the plants were measured to study the plant growth. Plants were irrigated when the soil moisture level had dropped approximately to that of field capacity of the soil, 1 / 3 bar. Conclusions drawn from this study were: 1) wetting front movement patterns were symmetrical about the vertical plane passing through the center of lateral and ellipsoidal in shape; 2) the laterals should be placed at a spacing of 35 inches in field row crops; 3) the lateral depth of 18 -inches is preferable over 12 -inches; 4) study of growth of plants in <b>subsurface</b> <b>irrigation</b> system confirmed the S-shaped curve; 5) plant growth was 54 % during the 14 -hour day time; 6) an irrigation scheduling program can be determined using Delmhorst electrical resistance blocks as soil moisture sensors; 7) almost 100 percent of soil moisture removed as evapotranspiration is extracted from the top one foot of soil at various stages of plant growth in a <b>subsurface</b> <b>irrigation</b> system 8) model intake rates in a <b>subsurface</b> <b>irrigation</b> system can be expressed in a manner similar to that of furrow irrigation system; and 9) <b>subsurface</b> <b>irrigation</b> systems show great promise for the future.

40|$|In oasis areas, {{surface water}} {{resources}} {{are becoming increasingly}} scarce. Groundwater resources are often overexploited, and are of poor quality for their high salinity degree. Water conservation and economy have therefore become imperative for better oases durability. If localized irrigation is currently recommended in Morocco for saving water, its use in the sub-desert areas does not keep water safe from high evaporation rates. An alternative to this system would be the use of <b>subsurface</b> drip <b>irrigation.</b> This technique is defined as an application of water under soil surface through drippers, which discharge water at generally similar rates as the surface drip <b>irrigation.</b> As <b>subsurface</b> drip <b>irrigation</b> is a newly introduced technique in Morocco, a better understanding in local conditions of the infiltration process around a buried source, {{and its impact on}} plant growth is necessarily required. This study aims to contribute to improving the efficiency of water use by testing the performance of <b>subsurface</b> drip <b>irrigation</b> system, especially in areas where water is a limited resource. The objectives of this research are performance evaluation in arid conditions of the <b>subsurface</b> drip <b>irrigation</b> system for young date palms compared to the surface drip, as well as determining the appropriate method of flow measurement for a buried dripper. In this context, an experimental plot was installed on a farm in the region of Erfoud (Errachidia Province, Southeast Morocco) to characterize the respective performances of surface and <b>subsurface</b> drip <b>irrigation</b> on young date palm. Flow measurement to calculate the uniformity of the application of water was done through two methods: a flow measurement of drippers above the surface and another one underground. The latter method has also helped us to estimate losses through evaporation for both irrigation techniques. In addition, in order to compare the effect of two irrigation modes, plants were identified at random for each type of irrigation to monitor certain agronomic parameters (cumulative numbers of palms and root development). Experimentation referred to a distribution uniformity of about 88 %; considered satisfactory for <b>subsurface</b> drip <b>irrigation</b> while it is around 80 % for the surface drip irrigation.

The pipes of <b>subsurface</b> <b>irrigation</b> system were installed at 90 cm distance from trees trunk at each side of trees, and 50 cm from soil surface. Mean of pressure and discharge in the pipes was 0. 8 to 1 atmosphere and 5. 4 Lh- 1 m- 1, respectively. Different factors of quantity and quality pistachio yield, current vegetative growth, water use efficiency and soil electrical conductivity were measured. The results showed that change of conventional (flooding) to <b>subsurface</b> <b>irrigation</b> system is possible and the best treatment can have water rate of 7174 m 3 ha- 1 y- 1 with 14 days irrigation interval. In comparison with other treatments, this treatment has better quantity and quality pistachio yield. Water use efficiency (WUE) of this treatment was 164 g dry yield per cubic meter. Nevertheless, application of water rate of 4783 m 3 ha- 1 y- 1 can result in the deficiency of irrigation water. At this water rate, WUE was 177 g dry yield per cubic meter.

40|$|Background: Water stress {{during the}} {{critical}} growth periods reduces crop yield and quality. The {{present study was}} evaluated the effect of <b>subsurface</b> <b>irrigation</b> systems on water use efficiency and soybean growth at sandy-loam soil. Methods: Tractor attachable dripline injector was used to install the dripline to the each plot at NICS research field in Miryang, Korea. Five irrigation treatments including the control were applied in response to application wide (70 and 140 cm) and position (under ridge and furrow). Each plot contained twelve crop rows, 38 m in length and 70 cm row spacing. Results: Soil water content at top 10 cm was significantly greater than the control, which was significantly increased to 15. 8 % with 70 cm interval under ridge, 19. 1 % with 70 cm interval under furrow, 21. 0 % with 140 cm interval under ridge, and 24. 6 % with 140 cm interval under furrow, respectively. Soybean yield components including plant height and stem thickness were strongly influenced by irrigation practices. Chlorophyll concentration was also greater with irrigation practice compared to the control in whole growth stages. The highest grain yield was 3. 35 ton/ha with 70 cm interval under ridge plot, which was 34 % more yield compared to the control. Discussion: Soybean yield components and grain yield were significantly influenced by irrigation practices due to the plant favourable soil management such as timely water supply.

It was found that surplus water did not drain from the irrigated area until the water table anywhere in this area was 10 cm higher than the elevation of the overflow pipe in the control chamber. It was therefore concluded that a water table depth range of 10 cm {{should be included in the}} design of the water table control system to allow for the effects of rain...|$|E
40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{interest}} for the <b>subsurface</b> drip <b>irrigation</b> system due {{to the need for}} new technologies that present larger water application efficiency and allow the wastewater reuse. This kind of system allows to increase both, the plant production and the nutrient use efficiency, but it was not completely researched in full detail, despite there are thousands of hectares irrigated by that kind of system all over the world. The bibliographic references show a predominance of the system use in tomato crop, and Brazil is one of the countries rethe matter. Cotton is another crop in which <b>subsurface</b> drip <b>irrigation</b> systems are largely used, with a wide research in the United States. This kind of system is also highlighted for wastwater reuse,because it avoids the wastewater contact with plants and humans. It is being applied in the irrigation of grasslands of the United States, Canada and Europe. The main objective is to characterize and to describe {{the state of the art}} of the <b>subsurface</b> drip <b>irrigation</b> systems all over the world, trying to show its current use in agriculture, and also its advantages and disadvantages...|$|R
40|$|The present {{research}} was conducted during the dry and warm growing seasons of 2011, 2012 and 2013 at Guča, which is a well-known potato-growing region of Serbia. Potato was grown under both rainfed conditions and with irrigation, applying two methods: sprinkler and <b>subsurface</b> drip <b>irrigation.</b> The objective of the research was to conduct a comparative analysis and assess the profitability of potato production under rainfed conditions and with irrigation by these two methods. The main outcome of the research showed that higher yields and more profitable production are achievable with irrigation, compared to rainfed conditions. <b>Subsurface</b> drip <b>irrigation</b> {{was found to be}} more profitable than sprinkler irrigation. The results provided insight into the structure and distribution of income and expenses, the income and expense growth trend, the percentage profit growth in the case of sprinkler and <b>subsurface</b> drip <b>irrigation,</b> as well as potential income losses at the national level if the irrigation methods considered are not used. A detailed analysis of the production costs provided insight into the feasibility of optimizing potato-growing approaches for all three types of production. The higher profitability of irrigated potato production opens the question of the need to increase irrigation coverage in Serbia...|$|R
40|$|<b>Subsurface</b> drip <b>irrigation</b> {{that uses}} an emitter {{protection}} system to avoid its clogging by roots and soil particles may be viable {{compared to a}} conventional system. The objective of this work was to evaluate {{the performance of a}} system with emitter protection, and to compare the results with a system that uses a conventional emitter for <b>subsurface</b> drip <b>irrigation.</b> In the system with protection an inexpensive materials polyethylene hose, microtube, connector, and a dripper to control the flow rate were used; and, in the conventional system a commercial emitter was used. After 12 months of evaluation, the system with protector showed good performance, with relative average flow rate of 0. 97 and 0. 98 in pots with and without crop, respectively, showing no clogging problems and lower cost. In conventional system relative flow rate of 0. 51 and 0. 98 were observed in pots with and without crop, respectively, also clogging degree by roots of 49. 22 %, and emitters with soil inside was observed. Thus, the use of emitter with protection presented feasibility for <b>subsurface</b> drip <b>irrigation,</b> under conditions used in this research...|$|R
