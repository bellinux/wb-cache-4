40|$|Abstract. A short {{overview}} of Grid infrastructure <b>status</b> <b>monitoring</b> is given {{followed by a}} discussion of key concepts for advanced <b>status</b> <b>monitoring</b> systems: passive information gathering based on direct application instrumentation, indirect one based on service and middleware instrumentation, multidimensional matrix testing, and on-demand active testing using non-dedicated user identities. We also propose an idea of augmenting information provided traditionally using Grid information services by information from the infrastructure <b>status</b> <b>monitoring</b> which gives verified and thus valid information only. The approach is demonstrated using a Testbed <b>Status</b> <b>Monitoring</b> Tool prototype developed for a GridLab project. ...|$|R

The dual design approach followed consists of an in-depth device characterization with subsequent algorithm development. This allows to understand and leverage the correct design {{and implementation of the}} most critical components of the algorithms. The high-reliability <b>status</b> <b>monitoring</b> protocol operates based on monitoring windows with synchronous notification, subsequent acknowledgement rounds and periods of reduced activity, at regular intervals. This leads to deterministic and thus highly reliable operation of the <b>status</b> <b>monitoring</b> protocol implementation on the Tmote Sky platform. I...|$|R

40|$|This project, {{the result}} of a four week {{research}} project, delivers a concept Fibre Channel SAN health <b>status</b> <b>monitor.</b> Problem indicator from different sources and of different nature are combined into a relational model, and status levels have been defined to represent the health of a redundant storage infrastructure continuously, as well as over longer time periods. The scope of current SAN monitoring tools has been broadened to include information from hosts that connect to a Fibre Channel fabric. The relational model combines problem indicator subjects from hosts, fabric switches, and storage systems. Problem indicators and relations between them lead to different health status levels, which can be represented continuously as well as historically. Next steps towards the realisation of a SAN health <b>status</b> <b>monitor</b> are a proof of concept implementation, and further development of a translation scheme between problem indicators and their relations.
