40|$|OBJECTIVE: The study {{analyzed}} {{the relationship between}} anxiety and inappropriate eating behaviors in adolescent female athletes. METHODS: Eighty-eight track and field athletes aged 12 to 17 years participated in the study. We used the Eating Attitudes Test- 26 subscales to assess inappropriate eating behaviors and the Brazilian <b>State</b> - Trait <b>Anxiety</b> Inventory subscales to assess <b>State</b> and Trait <b>anxiety.</b> RESULTS: <b>State</b> - Trait <b>Anxiety</b> Inventory - <b>State</b> (p= 0. 18) or <b>State</b> - Trait <b>Anxiety</b> Inventory - Trait (p= 0. 14) had no significant influence on the Dieting subscale score. The Bulimia and Food Preoccupation subscale score was also not influenced by <b>State</b> - Trait <b>Anxiety</b> Inventory - <b>State</b> (p= 0. 25) or <b>State</b> - Trait <b>Anxiety</b> Inventory - Trait (p= 0. 21). However, <b>State</b> - Trait <b>Anxiety</b> Inventory - Trait (p= 0. 048) {{had a significant impact}} on the Oral Control subscale score, but <b>State</b> - Trait <b>Anxiety</b> Inventory - <b>State</b> (p= 0. 19) did not explain its variance. CONCLUSION: Only <b>State</b> - Trait <b>Anxiety</b> Inventory - Trait was related to oral control and the environmental and social forces that encourage food intake in female athletes...|$|R

40|$|Patients {{with social}} anxiety {{disorder}} (SAD) not only fear negative evaluation but are indeed less likeable than people without SAD. Previous research shows social performance to mediate this social anxiety-social rejection relationship. This study studied two pathways hypothesized to lead to poor social performance in social anxiety: increased self-focused attention and negative beliefs. <b>State</b> social <b>anxiety</b> was experimentally manipulated in high and low-blushing-fearful individuals by letting {{half of the participants}} believe that they blushed intensely during a 5 min getting-acquainted interaction with two confederates. Participants rated their <b>state</b> social <b>anxiety,</b> self-focused attention, and level of negative beliefs. Two confederates and two video-observers rated subsequently likeability (i. e., social rejection) and social performance of the participants. In both groups, the social anxiety-social rejection relationship was present. Although <b>state</b> social <b>anxiety</b> was related to heightened self-focused attention and negative beliefs, only negative beliefs were associated with relatively poor social performance. In contrast to current SAD models, self-focused attention did not play a key-role in poor social performance but seemed to function as a by-product of <b>state</b> social <b>anxiety.</b> Beliefs of being negatively evaluated seem to elicit changes in behavioral repertoire resulting in a poor social performance and subsequent rejection.

40|$|Background: Emotional and {{interpersonal}} impairments associated with alcohol-dependence have been recently explored, but the distorted cognitive representations underlying these deficits remain poorly understood. The present study aims at exploring {{the presence of}} maladaptive social self-beliefs among alcohol-dependent individuals, as these biased self-beliefs have been recently shown to {{play a crucial role}} in the development and maintenance of other psychopathological <b>states</b> (social <b>anxiety</b> and depression). Methodology/Principal findings: Twenty-five recently detoxified alcohol-dependent participants and 25 matched controls filled in self-report questionnaires evaluating maladaptive social self-beliefs, interpersonal problems and several comorbid <b>states</b> (<b>anxiety,</b> social anxiety, depression). As compared to controls, alcohol-dependent individuals showed higher scores than controls for the three subcategories of maladaptive social self-beliefs (high standards, conditional beliefs and unconditional beliefs). Our key finding was that when comorbidities were controlled for, alcohol-dependence was associated with a specific bias towards exaggerated high standards in social contexts. Moreover, these high standards beliefs were strongly correlated with interpersonal problems. Conclusions/Significance: These results provide the first insights into the influence of cognitive biases on interpersonal problems in addictive states, and suggest that maladaptive self-beliefs could have a central influence on the development and maintenance of alcohol-dependence. 6 page(s...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop, implement, and {{evaluate}} a group counseling program and its influence on anxiety levels in newly diagnosed cancer patients. A total of twenty-four subjects being treated for cancer were used in the study. They were assigned to either Group I (group counseling program) or to Group II (control). The subjects in both groups completed the <b>State</b> Trait <b>Anxiety</b> Inventory (STAI). Group I participated in a series of three highly structured group counseling sessions. The content of the sessions was designed to deal with problems that tend to produce or intensify anxiety in cancer patients. The three specific topics discussed were: relaxation techniques, nutrition, and assertiveness training. After completion of the group counseling program both groups were re-tested with the <b>State</b> Trait <b>Anxiety</b> Inventory. The Mann Whitney U-test was used to compare differences on <b>state</b> and trait <b>anxiety</b> levels between Group I and Group II. No significant differences on either <b>state</b> or trait <b>anxiety</b> were found between the two groups. Therefore, the null hypothesis could not be rejected. However, the data did suggest that a counseling program may have some positive effect on anxiety reduction in cancer patients...|$|R
