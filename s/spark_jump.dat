40|$|The {{behaviour}} of the pulsed discharge at {{atmospheric pressure}} between multiple needles- plane electrode has been investigated. This type of discharge {{has been used}} in our experiments as a suitable tool for plasma chemistry of COx, NOx and SOx, i. e. for effective decomposition of these radicals. The main advantage of it concludes to a phenomenon of <b>spark</b> <b>jumping</b> from one needle to another over whole volume of treated gas. The behaviour of the pulsed discharge of such type has been studied with use of the optical registration method of discharge for each needle...|$|R
50|$|In a Wimshurst machine, the two {{insulated}} discs {{and their}} metal sectors rotate {{in opposite directions}} passing the crossed metal neutralizer bars and their brushes. An imbalance of charges is induced, amplified, and collected by two pairs of metal combs with points placed near the surfaces of each disk. These collectors are mounted on insulating supports and connected to the output terminals. The positive feedback increases the accumulating charges exponentially until the dielectric breakdown voltage of the air is reached and an electric <b>spark</b> <b>jumps</b> across the gap.|$|R
50|$|He {{produced}} artificial lightning, with discharges {{consisting of}} millions of volts and up to 135 ft long. Thunder from the released energy was heard 15 mi away in Cripple Creek, Colorado. People walking along the street observed <b>sparks</b> <b>jumping</b> between their feet and the ground. Sparks sprang from water line taps when touched. Light bulbs within 100 ft of the lab glowed even when turned off. Horses in a livery stable bolted from their stalls after receiving shocks through their metal shoes. Butterflies were electrified, swirling in circles with blue halos of St. Elmo's fire around their wings.|$|R
50|$|In the 18th century, Benjamin Franklin {{conducted}} {{extensive research}} in electricity, selling his possessions to fund his work. In June 1752 he is reputed to have attached a metal {{key to the}} bottom of a dampened kite string and flown the kite in a storm-threatened sky. A succession of <b>sparks</b> <b>jumping</b> from the key {{to the back of his}} hand showed that lightning was indeed electrical in nature. He also explained the apparently paradoxical behavior of the Leyden jar as a device for storing large amounts of electrical charge, by coming up with the single fluid, two states theory of electricity.|$|R
50|$|Automotive {{spark plug}} wires are {{insulated}} by {{multiple layers of}} silicone to prevent <b>sparks</b> from <b>jumping</b> to adjacent wires, causing misfires. Silicone tubing is sometimes used in automotive intake systems (especially for engines with forced induction).|$|R
50|$|In modern conditions, {{this method}} {{has a very}} small impact on the length on the service {{intervals}} of the vehicle and the longevity of individual components. Modern ignition systems do not have breaker points, which have been almost entirely replaced by electronic systems. Modern ignition coils outlast most other components of the vehicle and modern spark plugs have excellent service life, {{though there is a}} slight-difference between the two plugs as to erosion suffered at the center electrode. Because the <b>spark</b> <b>jumps</b> in opposite directions on the companion plugs, one bank will erode the center electrode more, and the opposite bank will erode the ground electrode more.|$|R
5000|$|... "Normally {{there are}} two spheres, and a <b>spark</b> <b>jumps</b> between them. Now imagine the spheres are flat surfaces, superconductors, {{one of them a}} coil or O-ring. Under {{specific}} conditions, applying resonating fields and composite superconducting coatings, we can organize the energy discharge {{in such a way that}} it goes through the center of the electrode, accompanied by gravitation phenomena - reflecting gravitational waves that spread through the walls and hit objects on the floors below, knocking them over...The second generation of flying machines will reflect gravity waves and will be small, light, and fast, like UFOs. I have achieved impulse reflection; now the task is to make it work continuously." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Jump</b> <b>spark</b> {{ignition}} {{was used}} and {{two sets of}} dry cells supplied the necessary current.|$|R
5|$|Further {{work was}} {{conducted}} by Otto von Guericke, Robert Boyle, Stephen Gray and C. F. du Fay. In the 18th century, Benjamin Franklin conducted extensive research in electricity, selling his possessions to fund his work. In June 1752 he is reputed to have attached a metal key {{to the bottom of}} a dampened kite string and flown the kite in a storm-threatened sky. A succession of <b>sparks</b> <b>jumping</b> from the key {{to the back of his}} hand showed that lightning was indeed electrical in nature. He also explained the apparently paradoxical behavior of the Leyden jar as a device for storing large amounts of electrical charge in terms of electricity consisting of both positive and negative charges.|$|R
50|$|The grid of the flyswatter is {{electrically}} {{charged to}} a voltage of between 500 and 1500 volts (V) of direct current, activated by pressing {{and holding a}} button. When the electrically conductive body of a fly nearly bridges the gap between electrodes, a <b>spark</b> <b>jumps</b> through the fly. A capacitor attached to the electrodes discharges during the spark, and this initial discharge usually stuns or kills the fly. If the button is still pressed, the continuous current will roast and kill the fly. Many flyswatters have a three-layer grid to prevent people from touching both electrodes. The outermost grids or rods are at the same electrical potential, and are open enough to allow an insect to contact the inner charged grid.|$|R
6000|$|... "How odd they are," [...] {{said the}} voice of Bastin behind me. [...] "They remind me of those blue <b>sparks</b> which <b>jump</b> up from the wires of the tramways in London on a dark night. You know, don't you, Bickley? I mean when the {{conductor}} pulls round that long stick with an iron wheel {{on the top of}} it." ...|$|R
50|$|When a {{strongly}} inductive load {{such as an}} electric motor is switched off, the current cannot drop instantaneously to zero; a <b>spark</b> will <b>jump</b> across the opening contacts. Switches for inductive loads must be rated to handle these cases. The spark will cause electromagnetic interference if not suppressed; a snubber network of a resistor and capacitor in series will quell the spark.|$|R
50|$|Thales of Miletus, {{writing at}} around 600 BC, noted that rubbing fur on various {{substances}} such as amber would {{cause them to}} attract specks of dust and other light objects. Thales wrote on the effect now known as static electricity. The Greeks noted that if they rubbed the amber for long enough they could even get an electric <b>spark</b> to <b>jump.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Laser {{branding}}: [...] "Laser" [...] branding is {{a marketing}} term coined by Steve Haworth, who pioneered {{its use in}} body modification. The technical term is [...] "electrosurgical branding". Though it is technically possible to use a medical laser for scarification, this term refers not an actual laser, but rather an electrosurgical unit which uses electricity to cut and cauterize the skin, {{similar to the way}} an arc welder works. Electric <b>sparks</b> <b>jump</b> from the hand-held pen of the device to the skin, vaporizing it. This is a more precise form of scarification, because it is possible to greatly regulate the depth and nature of the damage being done to the skin. Whereas with traditional direct branding, heat is transferred to the tissues surrounding the brand, burning and damaging them, electrosurgery branding vaporizes the skin so precisely and so quickly that little to no heat or damage to the surrounding skin is caused. This means that pain and healing time after the scarification is greatly lessened.|$|R
50|$|Thales of Miletus, {{an ancient}} Greek philosopher, writing at around 600 B.C.E., {{described}} {{a form of}} static electricity, noting that rubbing fur on various substances, such as amber, would cause a particular attraction between the two. He noted that the amber buttons could attract light objects such as hair and that if they rubbed the amber for long enough they could even get a <b>spark</b> to <b>jump.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Ignition was {{supplied}} by a Bosch magneto directly driven from the cam gears. The high voltage current was then {{taken to a}} fixed electrode on the front bearing case, from which the <b>sparks</b> would <b>jump</b> to the <b>spark</b> plugs in the cylinder heads as they passed within 1/16 inch (1.5 mm) from it. According to Macomber's literature, it was [...] "guaranteed not to overheat".|$|R
25|$|As {{reported}} by the ancient Greek mathematician Thales of Miletus around 600 BC, charge (or electricity) could be accumulated by rubbing fur on various substances, such as amber. The Greeks observed that the charged amber buttons could attract light objects such as hair. They also found that if they rubbed the amber for long enough, they could even get an electric <b>spark</b> to <b>jump.</b> This property derives from the triboelectric effect.|$|R
50|$|At the Hambach Festival of 1832 {{the signs}} of {{political}} upheaval, known as the Vormärz ("pre-March") were evident. Among the participants at the festival was Johann Philipp Becker. After {{the outbreak of the}} French Revolution of 1848 in Paris and the proclamation of the Second Republic in France, the revolutionary <b>spark</b> initially <b>jumped</b> to Baden before the other countries of the German Confederation gave way to revolutionary unrest and uprisings.|$|R

5000|$|While experimenting, Tesla {{inadvertently}} faulted a {{power station}} generator, causing a power outage. In August 1917, Tesla explained {{what had happened}} in The Electrical Experimenter: [...] "As an example of what has been done with several hundred kilowatts of high frequency energy liberated, {{it was found that the}} dynamos in a power house 6 mi away were repeatedly burned out, due to the powerful high frequency currents set up in them, and which caused heavy <b>sparks</b> to <b>jump</b> through the windings and destroy the insulation!" ...|$|R
2500|$|Michigan won the 1916 game by a {{score of}} 9–0. [...] According to one account of the game, Michigan quarterback Cliff Sparks [...] "crumpled the Aggie line almost every time he crashed into it and circled ends with ease, and was eel-like in running back punts." [...] The play that drew the most {{attention}} was Sparks' drop-kick on a broken play that gave Michigan a 3-0 lead in the first quarter. [...] The play called for Sparks to take the snap from center and hold the ball for a field goal attempt. [...] The snap from center was high, forcing Sparks to react quickly. [...] One press account described Sparks' actions as follows:"And then seemingly with a single movement, <b>Sparks</b> <b>jumped</b> to his feet, grabbed the ball as {{it was about to}} clear his head, whirled to face the goal posts and drop-kicked the ball over the Aggie bar for a count of three points, which then and there cinched the game for the Wolverines. 'It was the greatest individual play ever seen in my whole career as coach or player,' was 'Hurry Up' Yost's comment after the game. [...] And every person in the crowd who saw Sparks plan and execute that play in something less than two seconds chanted 'Amen!'" ...|$|R
5000|$|An {{inductor}} {{attempts to}} maintain a constant current flow through it. If the current in the circuit in which the inductor is connected goes down for some reason, the voltage developed across the inductor will go up {{in an attempt to}} try to maintain the constant current. When used with an ignitor ignition system in an engine, there is current flow when the ignitor contacts are closed. When the ignitor contacts are opened by the mechanical parts of the engine, current flow is interrupted. Because the low tension coil wants to maintain that current flow, the voltage across the coil rapidly goes up (usually to several hundred volts). When the voltage rises high enough, the voltage will jump the still very small gap of the ignitor contacts and create a spark which ignites the fuel mixture in the engine. Since there is a finite amount of energy stored in the coil, as soon as the <b>spark</b> <b>jumps</b> the gap the voltage across the coil collapses. As soon as the engine rotates and the ignitor contacts again close, current starts to flow through the coil and it again stores energy for the next cycle. A good description and moving gif of a low tension coil in operation can be found on Harrys Old Engines Ignition Page ...|$|R
5000|$|The 1902 [...] "touring car" [...] came {{complete}} with a 15-horsepower motor and a double opposed cylinder, horizontal motor and weighed 1,950 pounds. Ignition was by <b>jump</b> <b>spark</b> supplied by dry batteries. Two sets of batteries were carried under the bonnet and front of the dash.|$|R
5|$|Resonance was noticed {{early on}} in {{experiments}} with the Leyden jar, invented in 1746. The Leyden jar stores electricity due to its capacitance, and is, in fact, an early form of capacitor. When a Leyden jar is discharged by allowing a <b>spark</b> to <b>jump</b> between the electrodes, the discharge is oscillatory. This was not suspected until 1826, when Felix Savary in France, and later (1842) Joseph Henry in the US noted that a steel needle placed close to the discharge does not always magnetise in the same direction. They both independently drew the conclusion {{that there was a}} transient oscillation dying with time.|$|R

50|$|The fire's {{ignition}} source {{was determined to}} be a <b>spark</b> that <b>jumped</b> from a wire on the far left of the spacecraft, under Grissom's seat, but their deaths were attributed {{to a wide range of}} lethal hazards in the early Apollo Command Module design and workmanship and conditions of the test, including the highly pressurized 100% oxygen pre-launch atmosphere, many wiring and plumbing flaws, flammable materials used in the cockpit and the astronauts' flight suits, and a hatch which could not be quickly opened in an emergency. After the incident, these problems were fixed, and the Apollo program carried on successfully to reach its objective of landing men on the Moon.|$|R
40|$|In a basic, {{ram-type}} EDM system (figure 1 - 1 O), the {{ram head}} is driven {{up and down}} with extreme accuracy by a servodriven system. The servo system is controlled by a microprocessor connected to the power supply. The power supply is solid-state and is also microprocessor controlled. One lead from the power supply is connected to the workpiece, which is immersed in a tank of dielectric oil. The dielectric tank is connected to a dielectric pump, an oil reservoir, and a filter system. The pump provides pressure for flushing the work area and moving the oil while the filter system removes and traps debris in the oil. The oil reservoir stores surplus oil and provides a container for draining the oil between operations. The other lead from the power supply is connected to the electrode. The power supply provides a pulsed DC output to the electrode/workpiece system. On-times and off-times are set manually, along with voltage and current values. When the EDM machine is turned on, the servo microprocessor, sensing that the gap is too wide for cutting to take place, signals the servo mechanism to lower the ram head. When the first <b>spark</b> <b>jumps</b> the gap, downward travel of the ram head stops. With the gap setting held constant, the process gradually erodes the surface. When enough metal has been removed to change the gap distance, the microprocessor senses this and signals the servo mechanism to advance the ram head sufficiently to maintain the proper gap width, and the process continues...|$|R
5000|$|During spring training, Mets manager Willie Randolph {{worked with}} Chávez {{to improve his}} hitting. Chávez's speed and his {{modified}} batting style <b>sparked</b> a 90-point <b>jump</b> in his batting average over the previous season (hitting [...]306 in 353 at bats) as the Mets fourth outfielder (often as an injury replacement for regular left fielder Cliff Floyd). His improved hitting and excellent defensive skills contributed to the Mets winning the National League East.|$|R
5000|$|Sessions were troubled, {{not least}} by the {{difficult}} relationship Dinger and Rother maintained. Dinger also disliked Rother's new style of music, exhibited on Lust, which forwent guitar for synthesizers: [...] "One {{of the reasons}} the <b>spark</b> did not <b>jump</b> during the recordings with Michael Rother in '85 that he had to search so long to find a guitar, so in the end he stuck to his Fairlight synthesizer." ...|$|R
50|$|A {{spark gap}} {{is one of}} the oldest {{protective}} electrical technologies still found in telephone circuits, having been developed in the nineteenth century. A carbon rod electrode is held with an insulator at a specific distance from a second electrode. The gap dimension determines the voltage at which a <b>spark</b> will <b>jump</b> between the two parts and short to ground. The typical spacing for telephone applications in North America is 0.076 mm (0.003"). Carbon block suppressors are similar to gas arrestors (GDTs) but with the two electrodes exposed to the air, so their behavior is affected by the surrounding atmosphere, especially the humidity. Since their operation produces an open spark, these devices should never be installed where an explosive atmosphere may develop.|$|R
