Now officially known as the Donjon Iron and Metal <b>Scrap</b> <b>Processing</b> Facility, the scrapyard was opened in 1964 by J. Arnold Witte, Sr. The scrapyard {{is known for its}} large assortment of obsolete steam tugs, ferries, carfloats, and other craft. Witte acquired them faster than he could break them up; the end result is dozens of vessels slowly rotting in the muck of the Arthur Kill. A number of noteworthy vessels, including the New York City Fire Department fireboat Abram S. Hewitt, which was involved in the rescue of survivors of the 1904 General Slocum tragedy and was the last coal-burning fireboat in operation in the FDNY's fleet, can be found here. Scenes from the 2010 thriller Salt, starring Angelina Jolie, were filmed on location at the Witte Marine Scrapyard.|$|E

50|$|Electronics {{companies}} are constantly {{coming out with}} new technologies, rendering old models obsolete.

This <b>scrap</b> <b>processing</b> is quite profitable due to an abundant workforce and cheap labour.

5000|$|The {{local economy}} of Agbogbloshie {{is based on}} an onion market serving {{immigrants}} to Accra from the greater Tamale Region (Dagbani) in the north. Unemployed immigrants turned to scrap metal collection, including auto scrap, to supplement incomes. Electronic <b>scrap</b> <b>processing</b> is a fairly small activity at the market. The claim that [...] "hundreds of millions of tons of electronic waste are imported to the area each year", as reported by several news sources, is considered by most experts to be utterly ridiculous and preposterous. The United States is definitely not the leading exporter of e-waste to Ghana, although imports arrive from other countries such asFrance, Germany, Korea, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Multinational brands such as Philips, Canon, Dell, Microsoft, Nokia, Siemens and Sony are commonly found throughout the waste. According to the E-Waste Assessment Studies, [...] "Refurbishing of EEE and the sales of used EEE is an important economic sector (e.g. Alaba market in Lagos). It is a well-organized and a dynamic sector that holds the potential for further industrial development. Indirectly, the sector has another important economic role, as it supplies low and middle income households with affordable ICT equipment and other EEE. In the view of the sector’s positive socio-economic performance, all policy measures aiming to improve e-waste management in Nigeria should refrain from undifferentiated banning of second-hand imports and refurbishing activities and strive for a co-operative approach by including the market and sector associations." [...] Followers of BAN.org have alleged that Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are adding to the waste when excess electronics are donated with the intention of helping scholarly institutions. They claim, based on the 75%-80% orphaned waste statistic, that exporters must have found numerous loopholes to avoid legislation forbidding e-waste shipping, such as labeling broken electronics as ‘end-of-life’ or ‘second-hand-goods’, falsely identifying them as in working order. If it were true that between 50% and 75% of the electronics imported are unable to be salvaged and remain on the land, the import would be illegal. [...] However, the UN Studies have failed to find evidence of the allegation, and the only source of the dumping statistic has denied it.|$|E
