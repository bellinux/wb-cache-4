40|$|Background:. Asymmetry is {{a common}} {{occurrence}} in bilaterian animals, particularly human beings. Through examination of patients and their photographs during rhinoplasty, we noted wider left-sided nasal and facial features in most patients. This observation led us to hypothesize {{that this might be}} consistent to the whole body. Methods:. We conducted a study in 3 parts to test the question above. First, we analyzed operating notes of 50 rhinoplasty patients to determine the wider side of the upper, middle, and lower thirds of the nose. Second, we analyzed the width of the face and chest wall in 31 patients to discern any correlation between facial and bodily asymmetry. Third, computerized tomographic scans of the thorax and body of 48 patients were studied to measure the width of the hemithorax and hemipelvic bone. Results:. (1) Upper vault width was wider on left side (78 %). Left middle vault width was wider (88 %). The lower lateral cartilage, lateral crura convexity was more prominent on left side (48 %), and a wider <b>scroll</b> <b>area</b> was found and trimmed in 21 (left) and 0 (right) cases. The alar base was wider on left side (56 %). (2) In the body and face analysis, 64. 5 % had a wider left-sided face and body. (3) In the computed tomographic scan analysis, same-sided thorax and pelvis asymmetry was seen (85. 35 %), 33 and 7 of which were left- and right-sided, respectively. Conclusion:. We observed generalized asymmetry of the face and body with left-sided predominance...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the influence of anthropometric characteristics and gender on postural balance in adults. One hundred individuals were examined (50 males, 50 females; age range 20 - 40 years). METHODS: The following body composition measurements were collected (using bone densitometry measurements) : fat percentage (% fat), tissue (g), fat (g), lean mass (g), bone mineral content (g), and bone mineral density (g/cm 2). In addition, the following anthropometric measurements were collected: body mass (kg), height (cm), length of the trunk-cephalic region (cm), length of the lower limbs (cm) and length of the upper limbs (cm). The following indices were calculated: body mass index (kg/m²), waist-hip ratio and the support base (cm²). Also, a postural balance test was performed using posturography variables with open and closed eyes. RESULTS: The analysis revealed poor correlations between postural balance and the anthropometric variables. A multiple linear regression analysis demonstrated that the whole group (female and male) height explained 12 % of the medial-lateral displacement, 10 % of the speed of oscillation, and 11 % of the displacement area. The length of the trunk-cephalic length explained 6 % of the displacement in the anteroposterior direction. With eyes closed, the support base and height explained 18 % of the medial displacement, and the lateral height explained 10 % of the displacement speed and 5 % of the <b>scroll</b> <b>area.</b> CONCLUSION: Measured using posturography, the postural balance was only slightly influenced by the anthropometric variables, both with open and closed eyes. Height was the anthropometric variable that most influenced postural balance, both in the whole group and separately for each gender. Postural balance was more influenced by anthropometric factors in males than females...|$|E
50|$|When {{horizontal}} scrolling is enabled ANTIC retrieves more screen memory bytes than displayed {{in order to}} show partially scrolled display bytes {{at the beginning and end}} of the line. If the display is in Narrow mode ANTIC retrieves the number of screen bytes necessary for Normal mode. If the display is in Normal mode ANTIC retrieves the number of bytes needed for Wide screen mode. In Wide screen mode ANTIC does not retrieve any additional screen bytes. Scrolling in Wide screen will cause blank data to be shifted into the <b>scrolled</b> <b>area.</b> This is not a problem, because it occurs in the overscan area which is not visible on a normal NTSC/PAL display.|$|R
50|$|The third game, titled Ninja Gaiden III: The Ancient Ship of Doom {{features}} rogue secret agents, {{genetic engineering}} and the eponymous warship. The gameplay is largely unchanged {{and more is}} revealed about Foster, the CIA agent who sent Ryu after Jaquio {{in the first game}} and his true intentions towards the ninja. It is the first game in the series to have limited continues. Additionally, most attacks deal 2 damage units to the player character (rather than 1 in the previous games), who still has only 16 health units. Additions include a sword extension power-up that increases the range of the player's attack {{until the end of the}} level or until death, new types of surfaces from which the player can hang, and automatically <b>scrolling</b> <b>areas.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{structure}} of the game consists of overhead, free-directional <b>scrolling</b> <b>areas</b> and the player's ship is armed with main shot to shoot airborne targets and a bomb shot to shoot ground enemies. Gameplay consists of flying the FIRE LEO over ORN occupied areas while destroying enemy base installations and turrets. Each area has {{a certain number of}} shield generators hidden under the ground based enemy targets; in order for an area to be completed, the shield generators must be found and destroyed. After doing so, the Dyradeizer will temporally appear and the player must destroy a certain section of it. Once this section is destroyed, the Dyradeizer will disappear and the player will be taken to the next area to repeat the process.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of Nautilus, the display list was set to divide the screen into five sections. At the top was a low-resolution text area {{displaying}} the score, followed by the horizontal-scrolling map used by the Colossus, followed by another text score <b>area,</b> a 2-D <b>scrolling</b> <b>area</b> for the Nautilus, and finally another text area for the status at the bottom. The graphics {{for each of these}} areas would be held in a separate area in memory. The ANTIC had a single register holding the position of the smooth scrolling. In order to have different scrolling positions for the upper and lower portions of the screen, the ANTIC was instructed to cause an interrupt after the second text area, calling into the 6502 to set the scrolling register to a different position.|$|R
50|$|This {{number of}} color clocks to shift is {{controlled}} with the HSCROL register. The maximum HSCROL value range covers fine scrolling 16 color clocks from 0 to 15. The color clock information used is buffered {{from the beginning}} of the mode line (ANTIC's current memory scan pointer) using enough screen memory bytes to satisfy the 16 color clocks. Horizontal scrolling simply directs ANTIC how many color clocks it can output from the buffered 16 color clocks starting at the last (right most) color clock of the buffered memory. Zero (0) is no color clocks output from the buffer. 1 is the last (right most) color clock of the buffer. The color clocks are inserted at the left edge of the screen, causing the <b>scrolling</b> <b>area</b> of the screen to shift to the right.|$|R
5|$|The player takes {{control of}} the Gunhed Star Fighter through nine {{vertically}} <b>scrolling</b> <b>areas.</b> The player's mission is to destroy the Dark Squadron and its eight enemy Super Weapons. Every area contains one or more bosses, all of which must be destroyed before continuing in the game. Players lose a life if they are hit by an enemy or projectile, with the game continuing at a previously–crossed checkpoint, unless they grab a flashing orb which destroys all on-screen enemies and allows them to continue {{at the point where}} their previous ship was destroyed (represented by the icon illustrating the remaining number of ships turning gold). The game ends when all lives have been lost, but the game awards 1-ups when the player scores a particular number of points. The game provides four continues in which players can restart the game at that level in which their previous game ended provided the system is not turned off.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This report {{describes}} {{a system that}} was adopted to allow stu-dents to provide feedback on their level of comprehension during a lecture.

5000|$|Spy vs. Spy: The Island Caper (also {{known as}} Spy vs. Spy II: The Island Caper) {{introduced}} a side <b>scrolling</b> play <b>area,</b> which effectively {{allowed for a}} small number of very wide [...] "rooms" [...] (the action actually takes place outside, on a tropical island). It also introduced the idea of traps being built from the sticks and coconuts on the island, meaning that each spy no longer started with a fixed number of traps, but must compete to acquire the raw materials necessary to build their traps. The spies must gather the three segments of a rocket and then dive into a sea where a submarine awaits them. However, only connected segments can be carried at any one time. The second installment also included more complex scenery and continued the dual-screen interface present in the first. The game starts with the two players parachuting onto an island in search of a buried missile. As they search, players are able to build traps to slow their enemy's progress. This game was going to come out on the NES in North America from Kemco but was scrapped because of poor sales of the first game on NES, but in 2009 reproductions of the game in cartridge form were released in both regular and black and white limited edition cartridges.|$|R

The cold flow experimental results are presented for the velocity field at the scroll tongue. In addition, a total pressure loss of 3. 5 percent for the scroll is revealed from the velocity measurements combined with the static pressure readings. Moreover, the measurement of the three normal stresses of the turbulence has showed that the flow is anisotropic. Furthermore, the mean velocity components are compared with a numerical solution of the potential flow field using the finite element technique. The theoretical prediction of the exit flow angle variation agrees well with the experimental results.

5|$|Believing {{their first}} {{attempts}} {{to be too}} derivative, the developers held brain storming sessions. During a session, they agreed that one of Asteroidss favorable elements was its wrapping effect. They felt a game that allowed the player to fly off the screen would be exciting, and decided to create a game world larger than the screen displayed. The game's environment was made longer than the screen, with the visible <b>area</b> <b>scrolling</b> horizontally. Expanding on the idea, they envisioned a version of Space Invaders rotated 90degrees. By changing the orientation of Space Invaders design, the ship moved up and down while flying horizontally. Large asteroids, an element from Asteroids, were then added to the game world, but were later removed because the staff felt it lacked enjoyment. Jarvis intended the screen to scroll only from left to right; fellow Williams employee Steve Ritchie, however, convinced him the game {{should be able to}} scroll in either direction.|$|R

Scroll Lock was also used to lock the cursor on its line and <b>scroll</b> the work <b>area</b> under it. In spreadsheets such as Microsoft Excel, it locks the cell pointer on the current cell, allowing the user to use the arrow keys to move the view window without moving the cell pointer.
