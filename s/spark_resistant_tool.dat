Compared to d. c. magnetron sputtering processes the pulsed magnetron sputter deposition technique could be shown as a clear advancement. Furthermore pure TiAlN hard coatings as well as TiAlN coatings modified by addition of elements like Si and Cr were prepared in order to improve the coating properties using the pulsed magnetron sputter technique in a batch coater equipped with 4 targets. Coatings prepared with the pulsed sputter process showed both high hardness and high wear resistance. The application potential of pulsed sputtered TiAlN coatings is demonstrated by turning test results of coated cemented carbide cutting inserts. Beside hardness and wear, other properties like adhesion or high temperature stability were determined. Cross sectional SEM images revealed the growth structure in dependence of the applied substrate bias and of the added elements. The chemical composition of the coatings was investigated by electron microprobe analysis and the phase and crystal size were determined by X-ray diffraction.

To address this issue, a revolutionary thermally stable diamond composite (TSDC) based cutting tool, also called Super Material Abrasive <b>Resistant</b> <b>Tool</b> (SMART∗CUT) was developed by CSIRO. Before this novel tool is employed for practical rock cutting, {{the effects of the}} cutting parameters on the performance of the SMART∗CUT picks must be determined and the cutting forces of the picks have to be estimated as they directly affect the capability and efficiency of the selected cutterhead and hence the excavation machine. In this study, rock cutting tests based on Taguchi’s L 25 orthogonal array were conducted to analyze the cutting parameters. The signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios and the analysis of variance (ANOVA) were applied to investigate the effects of depth of cut, attack angle, spacing and cutting speed on mean cutting and normal forces during the rock cutting process. Empirical models for predicting the cutting forces on SMART∗CUT picks were developed using multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural network (ANN) techniques. Parametric combinations for minimizing the cutting forces and the statistical significance of process factors were successfully determined by using the Taguchi technique.

The technological solutions to improve the existing processes are not obvious because of the enormous amount of possibilities in available materials, heat and surface treatments such as PVD coatings for the envisaged industrial processes and applications. An in-depth research to understand the manufacturing processes with the consequence of an increased performance and lifetime of the tools {{as well as the}} opportunity of further optimization was the main goal of this project.

40|$|Die casting {{is a very}} {{cost-efficient}} {{method of}} forming thin-walled and complex near net-shaped products with close geometric tolerances and good surface finish. A permanent die tool is used to make large quantities of identical products. The performance and tool life are limited by several mechanisms, e. g. thermal fatigue cracking, erosion, and corrosion. To develop new and more <b>resistant</b> <b>tool</b> materials for die casting detailed knowledge of the actual casting conditions and the tool failure mechanisms are essential. This thesis contributes to an increased knowledge of tool failure in die casting by investigating and simulating actual casting conditions and tool failure mechanisms. A method to record the temperature fluctuations in a cavity insert during actual brass die casting was developed, and details of the temperature conditions were obtained. Also, a test method based on cyclic induction heating and internal cooling of hollow cylindrical test rods was developed, where the surface strain during thermal cycling could be measured. This method reproduced the characteristic type of surface cracking observed on die casting tools, and proved to give information of the strains and stresses behind the fatigue failure. In actual die casting, the dominant tool failure mechanism is thermal fatigue cracking. The formation of the cracks is associated to accumulation of the local plastic strain that occurs during each casting cycle. Initial crack growth is facilitated by oxidation of the crack surfaces, and proceeded growth is facilitated by this oxidation in combination with crack filling of cast material, and by softening of the tool material. In addition, local enrichment of Pb at the crack front from the cast alloy melt was also observed to promote the crack growth in die casting of brass. In an investigation of thermal fatigue of two hot work tool steels, quenched and tempered to different conditions, {{it was found that}} low-cycle fatigue occurs, although the estimated tensile stress never exceed the initial yield strength of the steel. The reason is a gradual softening of the steel during the thermal cycling, and the presence of stress raising defects. The resistance against thermal cracking improves with initial tool steel hardness, because any initial ranking in hardness among the steels is unaffected by the thermal cycling. Another investigation on a selection of surface engineered tool steels, including common diffusion treatments, PVD coatings and combinations of these, showed that surface engineering generally reduce the resistance against thermal cracking as compared to untreated references, since the engineering processes influence negatively on the mechanical properties of the hot work tool steels. Finally, corrosion tests of CrN PVD-coated tool steels by exposing them to molten aluminium revealed the mechanisms of initiation and progress of liquid metal corrosion of this material combination, and that the corrosion resistance improves with the CrN coating thickness...|$|R

Concerns about its supply security have been raised by various studies in literature, mostly due to trade disputes arising from supply concentration and exports restrictions in China and its lack of viable substitutes. Although tungsten material flows have been analysed for specific regions, a global mass flow analysis of tungsten is still missing in literature and its global supply chain remains opaque for industry outsiders. The objective {{of this paper is}} to create a map of global tungsten flows to highlight and discuss key material efficiency (i. e., using less of a material to make a product or supply a service, or reducing the material entering production but ending up in waste) and supply security opportunities along tungsten’s supply chain that could be incorporated into the planning and prioritization of future supply security strategies. The results indicate the existence of various intervention alternatives that could help to broaden the supply base and improve the overall material efficiency of the system.

Titanium Carbide square milling insert was microwave sintered at 600 °C with 15 minutes of holding time. The face milling operations were conducted to Carbon Steel S 45 C block (130 mm x 95 mm x 40 mm) by using both of original and microwave sintered insert at 5 different cutting speed (60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 m/min), constant feed rate (0. 2 mm/tooth) and constant depth of cut(0. 2 mm/tooth). The flank wear of the insert was measured every nearest 10 th minute of complete cutting passes. The results of the experiment show that microwave post sintering treatment improves the <b>tool</b> <b>resistant</b> of the TiC insert. The flank wear of the sintered insert is lower at any machining time and all cutting speed. The research {{also found that the}} percentage of the improvement is lower at higher cutting speed compare to lower cutting speed...|$|R
