5|$|By 2004, Juniper {{controlled}} 38% of {{the core}} router market. By 2007, it had a 5%, 18% and 30% <b>share</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> for enterprise, edge and core routers respectively. Alcatel-Lucent was unsuccessful in challenging Juniper in the core router market but continued competing with Juniper in edge routers along with Cisco.|$|E
5|$|Electricity is used within telecommunications, {{and indeed}} the {{electrical}} telegraph, demonstrated commercially in 1837 by Cooke and Wheatstone, was one of its earliest applications. With the construction of first intercontinental, and then transatlantic, telegraph systems in the 1860s, electricity had enabled communications in minutes across the globe. Optical fibre and satellite communication have taken a <b>share</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> for communications systems, but electricity {{can be expected to}} remain {{an essential part of the}} process.|$|E
5|$|In January 2001, Cisco {{introduced}} {{a suite of}} router products that BusinessWeek said was intended to challenge Juniper's increasing market-share. According to BusinessWeek, Juniper's top-end router was four times as fast at only twice the cost of comparable Cisco products. Cisco's routers were not expected to erode Juniper's growing <b>share</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>market,</b> but other companies such as Lucent, Alcatel, and startups Avici Systems and Pluris had announced plans to release products that would out-pace Juniper's routers.|$|E

5|$|The {{effort to}} develop a lighter, quieter camera with a reflex {{viewfinder}} led {{to the introduction of}} the Panavision Silent Reflex (PSR) in 1967. The camera could provide a shutter angle of up to 200 degrees. Many refinements were made to the PSR during the first few years after its introduction, and it soon {{became one of the most}} popular studio cameras in the world. Panavision also began manufacturing spherical lenses for 1.85:1 photography, garnering a significant <b>share</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>market.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Tapps in 1835, his son Sir George William Tapps-Gervis {{inherited}} his father's estate. He hired the young local architect Benjamin Ferrey to develop the coastal area {{on the east side}} of the stream. Bournemouth's first hotel, later to become part of the Royal Bath Hotel, opened in 1838 and is one of the few buildings designed by Ferrey still standing. Bournemouth started to grow at a faster rate as Tapps-Gervis began developing the area similarly to the south coast resorts of Weymouth and Brighton. Despite enormous investment, the town's <b>share</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> remained modest. In 1841 Tapps-Gervis invited the physician and writer Augustus Granville to stay. Granville was the author of The Spas of England, which described health resorts around the country, and as a result of his visit he included a chapter on Bournemouth in the second edition of his book. The publication of the book, and the increase in visitors seeking the medicinal use of seawater and the pine-scented air, helped the town to grow and establish itself as an early tourist destination.|$|E

5|$|Both teams {{received}} significant financial {{rewards for}} reaching the Champions League final. However, despite losing the match, it was Manchester United who earned {{the most money}} from their 2008–09 Champions League campaign, receiving €38.281million compared to Barcelona's €30.968million. All 32 teams in the group stage of the competition received €3million for {{taking part in the}} competition and €2.4million for their participation in the group stage matches, as well as further bonuses based on their performances in each match (€600,000 for each win and €300,000 for each draw). For their four wins and one draw, Barcelona received a performance bonus of €2.7million, while Manchester United earned €2.4million for their two wins and four draws. Both teams then also received a total of €7.7million for their participation in the rounds leading up to the final; however, Barcelona received a win bonus of €7million for winning the final, while Manchester United received €4million for finishing as runners-up. The biggest difference between the teams' financial rewards came {{as a result of their}} <b>share</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> pool, based on the value of the television market in their home countries. As the most successful of the English teams in the competition, Manchester United received the greatest share (€18.781million) of approximately €55.5million reserved for the English teams. However, although Barcelona were the most successful of the Spanish teams in the competition, they had finished in third place in La Liga the previous season, and so received the second-smallest share of the €33.8million given to the four Spanish clubs, taking home €8.168million.|$|E
