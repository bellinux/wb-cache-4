25|$|<b>Spiral</b> <b>binding</b> is {{the most}} {{economical}} form of mechanical binding when using plastic or metal. It is commonly used for atlases and other publications where it is necessary or desirable {{to be able to}} open the publication back on itself without breaking the spine. There are several types but basically it is made by punching holes along {{the entire length of the}} spine of the page and winding a wire helix (like a spring) through the holes to provide a fully flexible hinge at the spine. Spiral coil binding uses a number of different hole patterns for binding documents. The most common hole pattern used with this style is 4:1 pitch (4 holes per inch). However, spiral coil spines are also available for use with 3:1 pitch, 5:1 pitch and 0.400-hole patterns.|$|E
50|$|In 2007 <b>Spiral</b> <b>Binding</b> {{acquired}} James Burn North America, {{which becomes}} James Burn USA, LLC. <b>Spiral</b> <b>Binding</b> then became the largest family-owned document finishing business in America, with 8 sales and distribution centers in North America.|$|E

50|$|<b>Spiral</b> coil <b>binding</b> {{supplies}} {{are also available}} {{in a wide variety}} of colors. In fact there are more than sixty standard colors available for <b>binding</b> documents with <b>spiral</b> coil. This makes <b>spiral</b> coil <b>binding</b> an excellent choice for marketing agencies and design firms that want to match the spine of the document to a specific color palette. It is even possible to get a Pantone color match for organizations that want their spines to match the exact colors used in their printed materials.|$|R
50|$|<b>Spiral</b> <b>Binding</b> Company, Inc. {{was started}} in 1932 as the first {{mechanical}} binding company in the United States.

50|$|One of the {{strengths}} of <b>spiral</b> coil <b>binding</b> is that the supplies are available {{in a variety of}} lengths. Most users purchase spiral coils in twelve inch lengths. This spine is inserted onto an eleven-inch document and the excess length of coil is cut and crimped {{at each end of the}} book. However, the forming process for creating <b>spiral</b> coil <b>binding</b> elements allows them to be created in virtually any length. Many binderies and print shops choose to purchase coils in 36-inch lengths in order to have the flexibility to bind custom document sizes and to reduce waste. For binding documents shorter than eleven inches it is also possible to purchase shorter lengths of spiral coil in order to save time and money.|$|R
50|$|After World War II, many {{customers}} {{wanted to bring}} their binding processes in-house. As a result, <b>Spiral</b> <b>Binding</b> sold some of their binderies and the equipment division flourished.

50|$|There {{is a large}} set {{of books}} that are made only to write private ideas, notes, and accounts. These books are rarely {{published}} and are typically destroyed or remain private. Notebooks are blank papers to be written in by the user. Students and writers commonly use them for taking notes. Scientists and other researchers use lab notebooks to record their notes. They often feature <b>spiral</b> coil <b>bindings</b> at the edge so that pages may easily be torn out.|$|R
5000|$|The only {{technical}} requirement {{for this type}} of stationery to be considered a true [...] "legal pad" [...] is that it must have margins of 1.25 inches (3.17 centimeters) from the left edge of legal pad.

40|$|The Vinca {{alkaloids}} are a {{group of}} widely used anticancer drugs, originally extracted from the Madagascar periwinkle, that disrupt microtubule dynamics in mammalian cells by interfering with proper assembly of α,β-tubulin heterodimers. They favor curved tubulin assemblies that destabilize microtubules and induce formation of <b>spiral</b> aggregates. Their <b>binding</b> energy profiles have been characterized by means of sedimentation velocity assays and the binding site of vinblastine at the interface between two tubulin dimers (α 1 β 1 -α 2 β 2) has been ascertained by X-ray crystallographic studies on a complex of tubulin with the stathmin-like domain of protein RB 3, albeit at relatively low resolution. Here we use molecular modeling and simulation techniques to build, refine and perform a comparative analysis of the three-dimensional complexes of vinblastine, vincristine, vinorelbine and vinflunine with a β 1 α 2 -tubulin interface in explicit water to rationalize the binding affinity differences in structural and energetic terms. Our results shed some more light into the binding determinants and the structure-activity relationships of these clinically useful agents. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
5000|$|Biosynthesis of msDNA is {{purported to}} follow a unique pathway found nowhere else in DNA/RNA biochemistry. Because of the {{similarity}} of the 2'-5' branch junction to the branch junctions found in RNA splicing intermediates, it might at first have been expected that branch formation would be via spliceosome- or ribozyme-mediated ligation. Surprisingly, however, experiments in cell-free systems using purified retron reverse transcriptase indicate that cDNA synthesis is directly primed from the 2'-OH group of the specific internal G residue of the primer RNA. The RT recognizes specific stem-loop structures in the precursor RNA, rendering synthesis of msDNA by the RT highly specific to its own retron. The priming of msDNA synthesis offers a fascinating challenge {{to our understanding of}} DNA synthesis. DNA polymerases (which include RT) share highly conserved structural features, which means that their active catalytic sites vary little from species to species, or even between DNA polymerases using DNA as a template, versus DNA polymerases using RNA as a template. The catalytic region of eukaryotic reverse transcriptase comprises three domains termed the [...] "fingers", [...] "palm", and [...] "thumb" [...] which hold the double-stranded primer-template in a right-hand grip with the 3'-OH of the primer buried in the active site of the polymerase, a cluster of highly conserved acidic and polar residues situated on the palm between what would be the index and middle fingers. In eukaryotic RTs, the RNase H domain lies on the wrist below the base of the thumb, but retron RTs lack RNase H activity. The nucleic acid binding cleft, extending from the polymerase active site to the RNase H active site, is about 60 Å in length in eukaryotic RTs, corresponding to nearly two helical turns. When eukaryotic RT extends a conventional primer, the growing DNA/RNA double helix spirals along the cleft, and as the double helix passes the RNase H domain, the template RNA is digested to release the nascent strand of cDNA. In the case of msDNA primer extension, however, a long strand of RNA remains attached to the 3'-OH of the priming G. Although it is possible to model an RT-primer template complex which would make the 2'-OH accessible for the priming reaction, further extension of the DNA strand presents a problem: as DNA synthesis progresses, the bulky RNA strand extending from the 3'-OH needs somehow to <b>spiral</b> down the <b>binding</b> cleft without being blocked by steric hindrance. To overcome this issue, the msDNA reverse transcriptase clearly would require special features not shared by other RTs.|$|R
50|$|Coil binding, {{also known}} as <b>spiral</b> <b>binding,</b> is a {{commonly}} used book binding style for documents. This binding style is known {{by a number of}} names including spiral coil, color coil, colorcoil, ez-coil, plastic coil, <b>spiral</b> <b>binding,</b> plastikoil and coilbind. Documents bound with helical coil (usually called spiral coil) can open flat on a desk or table and offer 360 degree rotation for easy note taking. This binding style is durable and is often used for documents that need to be mailed. Spiral coil binding spines are also available in more colors and sizes than other binding styles.|$|E

50|$|Over {{time the}} term Blunt came to {{describe}} any cigar {{wrapped in a}} single continuous leaf. However, in the 1970s a new manner of producing cigars was invented. This manner is known as <b>spiral</b> <b>binding.</b> No longer did cigars have to be rolled in a continuous single leaf but instead a continuous spiral wrap from base to tip could be employed. The basic shape of a blunt remained unchanged although the burn characteristics of a spiral wrapped cigar {{is not the same}} as a single continuous leaf. However spiral wrapping is much less expensive than using a full single tobacco leaf. Spiral wrapping gives a better seal than a single continuous leaf as overlapping can be done (much like wrapping an arm in a bandage, spiral wrapping is easier to seal than a single continuous bandage).|$|E
50|$|Plastic <b>spiral</b> <b>binding</b> is a three-step process: punch, insert, crimp. First, a punch creates holes {{along the}} edge of the document. Second, a coil {{inserter}} spins the coils through the holes. Third, a pair of coil crimping pliers or a crimping machine is used to cut off the excess coil and crimp the end to prevent the coil from coming loose from the document. There are also more automated systems that will insert and cut and crimp the coil in one process and even some fully automated systems that will punch, insert, and crimp for the very high volume users. Light volume or personal users may choose to buy a single machine that does all of these features or may even choose to spin the coils onto their books by hand. Higher volume users will often choose to separate these three functions to help increase productivity.|$|E
