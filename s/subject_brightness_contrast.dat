The film calls on a number of databases, each structured in the same fashion. The database containing video footage (as opposed to music) holds 425 clips selected from footage that Manovich himself shot at various locations over several years. Manovich aims to capture the idea of a [...] "Global City" [...] throughout these shots. Each video clip in the database holds 10 parameters, including location, <b>subject</b> matter, average <b>brightness,</b> <b>contrast,</b> the type of space, the type of camera motion, and several more. The software uses these parameters in selecting each clip, finding clips that are all similar in some fashion to the next.|$|R
40|$|The perceptual {{image quality}} of natural scenes as a {{function}} of the physical system parameter gamma has a definite optimum. This optimum is subject-independent and greater than 1, but was found to vary from one scene to another. If gamma is varied, <b>brightness</b> <b>contrast</b> is the most obviously changing perceptual attribute. Subjects appear to be able to make consistent, global judgments of <b>brightness</b> <b>contrast</b> in natural scenes, despite the fact that local <b>brightness</b> <b>contrast</b> may vary considerably. If scaled perceptual quality is plotted against scaled (perceived) <b>brightness</b> <b>contrast,</b> all curves coincide, suggesting that under the given conditions <b>brightness</b> <b>contrast</b> is the dominant psychological dimension of the perceptual image quality. Taking into account the grey-level distribution of the scene in combination with the luminance- reproduction function of the imaging chain, an effective gamma value can be defined. If scaled perceptual quality and global <b>brightness</b> <b>contrast</b> are plotted against this effective gamma, the differences between scenes disappear, although there are clear differences in the relative sizes of the light and dark parts of the various test scenes. An analysis by scaling global brightness of Gaussian blobs of randomly distributed sizes, modulation depths, and polarities shows that skewness of this distribution does indeed have only a weak effect over a considerable range. The data suggest that the ratio of maximum and minimum luminance determines global <b>brightness</b> <b>contrast</b> for complex scenes under these conditions...|$|R

40|$|The perceptual {{image quality}} of {{different}} scenes {{as a function}} of the gamma parameter of the imaging chain, determined by the slope in the inflection point of the luminance reproduction function, has a definite optimum. Although the optimal gamma values were found to be subject-independent, they did vary from scene to scene. If gamma is varied, global <b>brightness</b> <b>contrast</b> is clearly the changing perceptual attribute. Scaled global <b>brightness</b> <b>contrast</b> {{as a function of}} gamma also appears different for different scenes, while subjects are consistent. If scaled perceptual quality is plotted against scaled global <b>brightness</b> <b>contrast,</b> however, the curves of the different scenes tend to coincide. This confirms earlier results indicating that global <b>brightness</b> <b>contrast</b> is a dominant sensorial dimension of perceptual image quality. The scene dependence of the optimal gamma values was the immediate motive of the present study. An effective gamma can be defined taking into account the distribution of the luminance levels of the scene elements with respect to the luminance-reproduction curve. If this gamma is used, both perceptual quality versus gamma and global <b>brightness</b> <b>contrast</b> versus gamma for the different scenes merge. The optimal value of gamma is found to be 1. 2 - 1. 5...|$|R

40|$|A {{group of}} three pigeons was trained on a 4 -ply {{multiple}} schedule: a green color and a vertical line superimposed upon an achromatic background as positive stimuli, and a red color and a horizontal line on an achromatic background as negative stimuli. The pigeons were tested with the vertical line superimposed upon different achromatic background intensities, then with the vertical line superimposed upon different green background intensities, and finally with the vertical line and its training achromatic backgfound attenuated (and unattenuated) by a neutral density filter. The gradients peaked at the luminance of the achromatic background used during training and at the equivalent luminance for the green background when it was substituted for the achromatic background. The <b>brightness</b> <b>contrast,</b> not the background luminance, was the critical variable as the neutral density filter attenuated both the line and the background equally, leaving <b>brightness</b> <b>contrast</b> unchanged; {{there was no response}} decrement to this attenuated stimulus.

40|$|<b>Brightness</b> <b>contrast</b> can be {{the result}} of an {{interaction}} process with the luminance of the immediate surround (local interactions) or a consequence of perceptual organization (global factors). It is alreadyPosters: Brightness and lightness known that a display with competing local and global factors without exposure time limitations results in a perceived <b>brightness</b> <b>contrast</b> induced by global factors. In this study we used reverse contrast Necker cube type displays with the relative controls. The two experimental stimuli were two medium-gray dashed cubes. The ﬁrst one, having dark inducer corners, was placed on a light inducer background and the second one, having light inducer corners, was placed on a dark inducer background. The control stimuli were identical to the two experimental displays except that the inducer corners were medium gray. The stimuli were presented for 200, 300, 500 and 1000 ms. We asked observers to match the brightness of the dashed lines of each cube to the brightness of a gray scale. Our results show that the brightness change in function of the exposure time: local factors produced the <b>brightness</b> <b>contrast</b> eﬀect at short stimulus exposure time while at longer exposure time the global factors win the competition and become crucial for brightness perception...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} between brightness and color causes {{there to be}} different color appearance when {{one and the same}} object is viewed against surroundings of different <b>brightness.</b> <b>Brightness</b> <b>contrast</b> causes color to be desaturated, as has been found in perceptual exper-iments on color induction and color-gamut expansion in human vision. However, it is not clear yet where in the cerebral cortex the brightness–color interaction that causes thesemajor perceptual effects is located. One hypothesis is that brightness and color signals are processed separately and in parallel within the primary visual cortex V 1 and only interact in extrastriate cortex. Another hypothesis is that color and <b>brightness</b> <b>contrast</b> interact strongly already within V 1. We localized the brightness–color interaction in human V 1 by means of recording the chromatic visual-evoked potential. The chromatic visual-evoked potential measurements decisively support the idea that brightness–color interaction arises in a recurrent inhibitory network in V 1. Furthermore, our results show that the inhibitory signal for brightness–color interaction is generated by local <b>brightness</b> <b>contrast</b> at the boundary between target and surround, instead of by the luminance difference between the interior of the color target and its large background.
