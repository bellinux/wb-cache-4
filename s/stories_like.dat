5|$|The {{power of}} stories to {{entertain}} {{is evident in}} one of the most famous ones—Scheherazade—a story in the Persian professional storytelling tradition, of a woman who saves her own life by telling stories. The connections between the different types of entertainment are shown by the way that <b>stories</b> <b>like</b> this inspire a retelling in another medium, such as music, film or games. For example, composers Rimsky-Korsakov, Ravel and Szymanowski have each been inspired by the Scheherazade story and turned it into an orchestral work; director Pasolini made a film adaptation; and there is an innovative video game based on the tale. Stories may be told wordlessly, in music, dance or puppetry for example, such as in the Javanese tradition of wayang, in which the performance is accompanied by a gamelan orchestra or the similarly traditional Punch and Judy show.|$|E

25|$|After the 1930s, the Japanization policy {{affected}} puppet theatre. The customary Chinese Beiguan was forbidden, and {{was replaced}} with Western music. The costumes and the puppets were a mixture of Japanese and Chinese style. The plays often included Japanese <b>stories</b> <b>like</b> Mitokomon and others, with the puppets dressed in Japanese clothing. Performances were presented in Japanese. These new linguistic and cultural barriers reduced public acceptance, but introduced techniques which subsequently influenced the future development of the Golden Light puppet theatre, including music and stage settings.|$|E
25|$|Summiting Everest {{with disabilities}} such as amputations and {{diseases}} has become {{popular in the}} 21st century, with <b>stories</b> <b>like</b> that of Sudarshan Gautam, a man with no arms who {{made it to the}} top in 2013. A teenager with Down's syndrome made it to Base camp, which has become a substitute for more extreme record-breaking because it carries many of the same thrills including the trip to the Himalayas and rustic scenery. Danger lurks even at base camp though, which was the site where dozens were killed in the 2015 Mount Everest avalanches. Others that have climbed Everest with amputations include Mark Inglis (no legs), Paul Hockey (1 arm only), and Arunima Sinha (1 leg).|$|E

The art of short story was further taken ahead by Manto, Bedi, Krishn Chander {{and a host of}} highly acclaimed writers. Urdu novel reached further heights in the 1960s with novels of Qurratulain Haider and Abdullah Hussain. Towards the end of the 20th century Urdu novel entered into a new phase with trend setter novel MAKAAN of Paigham Afaqui. Urdu ghazal has also recently changed its colour with more and more penetration in and synchronization with modern and contemporary issues of life.|$|E
25|$|Director Pawan Kumar {{admitted}} {{to have taken}} influence from Christopher Nolan and David Lynch. The dream and real sequences being shot in monochrome and in color to differentiate between the two <b>stories,</b> <b>like</b> the Memento to alternate between two plot-lines. The movie's relation with dream and reality and the interrelation between the two. There is also a scene where Nolan's movie Following is seen playing on a TV screen. Requiem for a Dream is also seen playing on a TV in the same scene which is also an influence as the movie deals with addiction. Apart from the cinematic influences, the theme of dream and illusion is also shown as an influence of the poem Nee Mayeyolago by Kanaka Dasa which is quoted {{at the beginning of}} the movie. The poem is also partially contained in the lyrics of the song Nee Toreda Galigeyali in the soundtrack.|$|E

According to Entertainment Weeklys Evan Serpick: [...] "Along with recent success <b>stories</b> <b>like</b> System of a Down and up-and-comers like the Dillinger Escape Plan, Lightning Bolt, and Coheed and Cambria, the Mars Volta create incredibly complex and inventive music {{that sounds like a}} heavier, more aggressive version of ’70s behemoths such as Led Zeppelin and King Crimson." ...|$|E
500|$|Night School {{wanted the}} story to have scary and supernatural elements, without verging on horror.

The developers were influenced by other coming-of-age <b>stories</b> <b>like</b> Stand By Me when developing the characters and story; Krankel cited the character of Lindsay Weir from Freaks and Geeks as the biggest outside influence on the character of Alex.|$|E
500|$|Eureka {{presents}} {{themes and}} sentiments similar {{to some of}} those in Poe's fiction work, including attempts at breaking beyond the obstacle of death and specifically characters who return from death in <b>stories</b> <b>like</b> [...] "The Fall of the House of Usher" [...] and [...] "Ligeia". Similar to his theories on a good short story, Poe believes the universe is a self-contained, closed system. In coming to his conclusions, Poe uses ratiocination as a literary device, through his character C. Auguste Dupin, as if Poe himself were a detective solving the mystery of the universe. Eureka, then, is the culmination of Poe's interest in capturing truth through language, an extension of his interest in cryptography.|$|E

500|$|In 1951, the British {{physician}} Richard Asher {{published an}} article in The Lancet describing patients whose factitious disorders led them to lie about their own states of health. Asher proposed to call the disorder [...] "Munchausen's syndrome", commenting: [...] "Like the famous Baron von Munchausen, the persons affected have always travelled widely; and their <b>stories,</b> <b>like</b> those attributed to him, are both dramatic and untruthful. Accordingly, the syndrome is respectfully dedicated to the baron, and named after him". The disease is now usually referred to as Munchausen syndrome. The name has spawned two other coinages: Munchausen syndrome by proxy, in which illness is feigned by caretakers rather than patients, and Munchausen by Internet, in which illness is feigned online.|$|E

I mean, people really do <b>stories</b> <b>like</b> that." [...] Steven Keslowitz writes in his book The World According to the Simpsons that the episode showcases the fact that [...] "the viewing of attractive newscasters and the use of persuasive tones of voice often do {{have an impact on the}} minds of many intelligent members of American society." ...|$|E

[...] Falle partners with the Toronto Police Service's sex crimes unit, which developed the statistic that the average age for a girl to become involved in prostitution in Canada is 14. According to Falle's research, the average age is between 13 and 16. York Regional Police drugs and vice unit Detective Thai Truong said that all law enforcement personnel should hear <b>stories</b> <b>like</b> Falle's because [...] "they remind us that they are not just prostitutes or escorts, but they are somebody's daughter, somebody's sister, somebody's wife." ...|$|E

500|$|Based on a {{short story}} Kaksparsh written by Usha Datar, a Marathi play Janmagaath premiered on 16 December 1989. Actor-director Vinay Apte had done the role of Hari Damle in the play and Sukanya Kulkarni as Uma. Apte had tried making a film based on the story but was not successful. Sachin Khedekar had seen the play and came across the story again in 2007. He showed the story to Girish Joshi (screenplay writer of the film) who then {{developed}} a complete adapted screenplay from the story which had a length of 4–5 pages. Later, Khedekar and Joshi approached Mahesh Manjrekar in 2009 {{to make a film}} on the story. However, Majrekar was busy with his other projects and could not plan the film. Manjrekar said that when he heard the story for the first time, he considered it to be better than other Indian love <b>stories</b> <b>like</b> Bajirao-Mastani or Salim-Anarkali. Manjrekar had to wait as {{he did not have the}} copyrights for the story. He said that it [...] "took more than three years to make this film".|$|E
500|$|According to critic Nancy Wingate, Heyer's detective novels, {{the last}} written in 1953, often {{featured}} unoriginal methods, motives, and characters, with {{seven of them}} using inheritance as the motive. The novels were always set in London, a small village, or at a houseparty. Critic Erik Routley labelled many of her characters clichés, including the uneducated policeman, an exotic Spanish dancer, and a country vicar with a neurotic wife. In one of her novels, the characters' surnames were even in alphabetical order according to the order they were introduced. According to Wingate, Heyer's detective <b>stories,</b> <b>like</b> many of the others of the time, exhibited a distinct snobbery towards foreigners and the lower classes. Her middle-class men were often crude and stupid, while the women were either incredibly practical or exhibited poor judgement, usually using poor grammar that could become vicious. Despite the stereotypes, however, Routley maintains that Heyer had [...] "a quite remarkable gift for reproducing the brittle and ironic conversation of the upper middle class Englishwoman of that age (immediately before 1940)". Wingate further mentions that Heyer's thrillers were known [...] "for their wit and comedy {{as well as for}} their well-woven plots".|$|E
500|$|Released on August 2, 2005, the {{collection}} has received generally positive reviews from critics. Slant Magazine's Keith Uhlich rated it three-and-a-half stars out of five, noting {{that there is}} [...] "an unabashed confidence to these episodes", although this [...] "comes with something of a price as the thrill and surprise of season two mythology <b>stories</b> <b>like</b> [...] "Colony" [...] and [...] "End Game" [...] are replaced by a nagging suspicion that the writers are starting to tread water". Uhlich singles out [...] "Talitha Cumi" [...] as {{the collection}}'s highlight, calling it [...] "an overall mindblower". Writing for DVD Talk, Jeffrey Robinson {{was impressed with the}} collection, calling it [...] "highly recommended". However, he felt that the cohesion between the episodes was lacking somewhat, and that the two-part episodes [...] "Tempus Fugit" [...] and [...] "Max" [...] did not add much to the overall storyline. Exclaim! Monica S. Kuebler, on the other hand, [...] felt negatively about the collection. She too felt that the interrupted nature of the episodes caused a lack of [...] "believable" [...] pacing, and noted that the release [...] "feels like a blatant cash grab by Fox to milk an old franchise while they still can".|$|E
