5|$|Little {{is known}} of Echmarcach's short reign in Dublin other than an attack on Skryne and Duleek, {{recorded}} by the seventeenth-century Annals of the Four Masters in 1037. This strike could have been undertaken {{in the context of}} the Dubliner's gradual loss of power in Brega, and an attempt to regain authority of Skryne. Although there is no direct evidence that Echmarcach controlled Mann at this point in his career, Sitriuc does not appear to have taken refuge on the island after his expulsion from Dublin. This <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> the island was outwith Sitriuc's possession, and may indicate that Mann had fallen into the hands of Echmarcach sometime before. In fact, it is possible that Echmarcach may have used the island to launch his takeover of Dublin.|$|E
5|$|Ímar's {{probable}} uncle, Sitriuc, ruled Dublin {{for almost}} fifty years between 989 and 1036. There {{is reason to}} suspect that the latter's realm included Mann by the second or third decade of the eleventh century. His reign in Dublin was finally put to an end by Echmarcach mac Ragnaill (died 1064/1065), who drove Sitriuc from the coastal town and claimed the kingship for himself. Previously, Sitriuc seems to have been closely aligned with Knútr Sveinnsson (died 1035), ruler of the kingdoms of England, Denmark, and Norway. Knútr's apparent authority in the Irish Sea region, coupled with Sitriuc's seemingly close connections with him, could account for the remarkable security enjoyed by Sitriuc during Knútr's reign. It is possible that Echmarcach had been bound from taking action against Sitriuc whilst Knútr held power, and that the confusion caused by the latter's death in 1035 enabled Echmarcach to exploit the situation and seize control of the Irish Sea region. Although there is no direct evidence that Echmarcach controlled Mann by this date, Sitriuc {{does not appear to have}} taken refuge on the island after his expulsion from Dublin. This <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> the island was outside Sitriuc's possession, and may indicate that Mann had fallen into the hands of Echmarcach sometime before. In fact, it is possible that Echmarcach used the island to launch his takeover of Dublin.|$|E

25|$|This latter {{aspect of}} the {{principle}} <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> the religion must always accept current scientific knowledge as authoritative, but some Bahá'í scholars have suggested {{that this is not}} always the case.|$|E
25|$|General doubts {{have been}} raised about the {{potential}} of the use of Salvia divinorum alone to cause suicidal action. In fact, scientific literature <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> Salvia divinorum has significant anxiolytic and antidepressant effects in rodents.|$|E
25|$|One {{interesting}} and widely researched topic is {{the relation between}} cosmovision, religion, geography, and architecture in Mesoamerica. Much <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> many traits of Mesoamerican architecture were governed by religious and mythological ideas. For example, the layout of most Mesoamerican cities seem {{to be influenced by}} the cardinal directions and their mythological and symbolic meanings in Mesoamerican culture.|$|E

25|$|In the 'Scouring of the Shire', {{there is}} further {{mention of the}} half-orcs under Sharkey's control, and they are {{described}} as men having squinty (or slanty) eyes and sallow complexion (a description {{used to describe the}} Southerner, Saruman's spy in The Fellowship of the Ring, {{as well as some of}} the orcs in The Two Towers). Which <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> they look mostly human but share some of the features of the orcs.|$|E
25|$|Excessive {{measures}} {{of performance and}} constant reactivity to performance appraisals challenge the very purpose {{of the system of}} performance appraisals, but performance evaluations can still offer organizations feedback about their practices. If performance evaluations did not accurately measure individual's abilities and productivity, it would be fruitless to continue to execute a system of constant performance evaluations. However, a phenomenon known as the performance paradox <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> performance evaluations may not be altogether futile.|$|E
25|$|The {{subsequent}} {{history of}} this 9th century CE Insular/Anglo-Saxon manuscript after its production is equally speculative. However, the existing evidence <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> at some point after its production in the later 9th and early 10th centuries this codex may have been subsequently relocated somewhere in unoccupied Mercia, presumably Worcester, or even Wessex. This evacuation, along with other ecclesiastical manuscripts, {{was to provide a}} safe environment or repository to protect the book from potential Viking raids and incursions.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} {{compensate}} for the natural incline of the ground on which the market stands, its builders undertook significant earthworks. These earthworks have been dated as being amongst the oldest Roman constructions, and their orientation vis-à-vis the forum <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> they were not built on any earlier foundations. The modern-day location of the remains from the market near the forum should however not be misunderstood as indicating a link between the two. The market was almost completely destroyed during the construction of the Byzantine fort. It was excavated in 1918-1919.|$|E
25|$|Since Moses is {{described}} by the Bible as encountering Jethro, a Kenite who was a Midianite priest, shortly before encountering Sinai, this suggests that Sinai would be somewhere near their territory in Saudi Arabia; the Kenites and Midianites appear to have resided east of the Gulf of Aqaba. Additionally, the Song of Deborah, which some textual scholars consider {{one of the oldest}} parts of the Bible, portrays God as having dwelt at Mount Seir, and <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> this equates with Mount Sinai; Mount Seir designates the mountain range in the centre of Edom.|$|E
25|$|Evaluation of {{numerous}} public health interventions has generally shown that improvement in each individual component ordinarily attributed to poverty (for example, sanitation, health education and underlying nutrition status) often have minimal impact on transmission. For example, {{one study found}} that the introduction of latrines into a resource-limited community only reduced the prevalence of hookworm infection by four percent. However, another study in Salvador, Brazil found that improved drainage and sewerage had a significant impact (p<0.0001) on the prevalence of hookworm infection but no impact at all on the intensity of hookworm infection. This <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> environmental control alone has a limited but incomplete effect on the transmission of hookworms. It is imperative, therefore, that more research is performed to understand the efficacy and sustainability of integrated programs that combine numerous preventive methods including education, sanitation, and treatment.|$|E

25|$|The {{directive}} <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> {{discovery of}} the defect must be impossible while the UK implementation seems to broaden the defence to situations where, while {{it would have been}} possible to discover the defect, it would have been unreasonable to expect the producer to do so. This difference led the Commission of the European Union to bring legal action against the UK in 1989. As there was at that time no UK case law on the defence, the European Court of Justice found that {{there was no evidence that}} the UK was interpreting the defence more broadly than the wording of the directive. This is likely to ensure that the UK legislation is interpreted to be consistent with the directive in the future, as was the case in A & Others v. National Blood Authority where the judge referred to the directive rather than the UK legislation.|$|E
25|$|Vicari et al. {{describe}} that {{it remains unclear}} whether neural circuits involved in semantic and episodic memory overlap partially or completely, and this case <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> the two systems are independent. Both of the patient's hippocampal and diencephalic structures {{on the right and}} left sides were disconnected. When C.L. came to Vicari et al.'s office, her chief complaint was forgetfulness involving both semantic and episodic memory. After administering a battery of neuropsychological tests, Vicari determined that C.L. performed well in tests of visual naming and sentence comprehension, visual-spatial ability, and “general semantic knowledge about the world.” They also noted an improved vocabulary and general knowledge base after 18 months. C.L.'s episodic memory, on the other hand, was far below expectations: She could not retain daily events, where she had gone on vacation, the names of places she had been, and other such information. However, this study and others like it are susceptible to subjectivity, since it is not always possible to clearly distinguish between episodic and semantic memory. For this reason, the topic remains controversial and debated.|$|E
25|$|Shortly before Lugosi's {{death in}} August 1956, {{he had been}} working with Wood on {{numerous}} half-realized projects, variously titled Tomb of the Vampire or The Ghoul Goes West. Scenes unconnected to Plan 9, featuring Lugosi weeping at a funeral, walking in front of Tor Johnson's house at daytime, walking {{in and out of the}} side door of the Johnson home at nighttime, and a daylight scene on a patch of scrub land near a highway showing Lugosi stalking towards the camera and dramatically spreading his Dracula cape before furling it around himself and walking back the way he came, had been shot. Only the first two sequences had reached any level of completion. When Lugosi died, Wood shelved these projects. It is not certain for which projects the Lugosi footage was intended, and Wood's own account of the affair in his written memoirs <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> the director had something like Plan 9 in mind when the material was filmed. This claim stands in apparent contradiction to the Vampires' Tomb/Ghoul Goes West theory, backed up by a comment Lugosi made about Ghoul being his next project in a filmed interview upon his release from drug rehabilitation.|$|E
50|$|Although {{some have}} <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> {{the editor of}} the text is Tertullian, the editor’s {{identity}} remains uncertain. The writing style and content of the edited material do <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> the editor is male.|$|R

25|$|The Resurrection Stone {{allows the}} holder {{to bring back}} {{deceased}} loved ones, in a semi-physical form, and communicate with them. The form of Sirius Black generated by the stone tells Harry {{that he and the}} other forms created by the stone are part of him and invisible to others. This <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> these apparitions are conjured from memories and are not really resurrected people. According to the fairy tale concerning the origin of the Deathly Hallows, using the Resurrection Stone drove the owner to kill himself because he brought his late fiancée back from the dead, and she was very unhappy in the real world for she did not belong there. By the time the stone was seen in Marvolo Gaunt's possession, it had been set into a ring that bore the symbol of the Deathly Hallows, which the ignorant Gaunt believed to be the Peverell coat of arms; he used the ring to boast about his ancestry and blood purity. Both Dumbledore and Grindelwald desired the stone, but for different reasons. While Dumbledore wanted it to communicate with his dead family, Grindelwald allegedly intended to use it to create an army of zombie-like Inferi. Harry said this is the Hallow he would desire most, as like Dumbledore he could name people he would like to communicate with again. Voldemort became aware of the ring's antiquity and eventually used the stone as a Horcrux, a container for part of his soul, being unaware of its additional magical properties.|$|E
500|$|The {{ideology}} of female seclusion may have extended inside the house. [...] Literary evidence <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> there were separate men's and women's quarters in Athenian houses. [...] In On the Murder of Erastothenes, Euphiletos {{says that the}} women's quarters are above the men's, while in Xenophon's Oeconomicus {{they are on the}} same level as the men's quarters but [...] "separated by a bolted door". [...] However, the archaeological evidence suggests that this boundary was not as rigidly defined as the literary evidence suggests. [...] Lisa Nevett, for instance, has argued that Athenian women were in reality only restricted to the [...] "women's quarters" [...] when unrelated men visited.|$|E
500|$|The {{androgynous}} {{nature of}} the inhabitants of Gethen is used to examine gender relations in human society. On Gethen, the permanently male Genly Ai is an oddity, and {{is seen as a}} [...] "pervert" [...] by the natives; according to reviewers, this is Le Guin's way of gently critiquing masculinity. [...] Le Guin also <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> the absence of gender divisions leads to a society without the constriction of gender roles. The Gethenians are not inclined to go to war, which reviewers have linked to their lack of sexual aggressiveness, derived from their ambisexuality. According to Harold Bloom, [...] "Androgyny is clearly neither a political nor a sexual ideal" [...] in the book, but that [...] "ambisexuality is a more imaginative condition than our bisexuality.... the Gethenians know more than either men or women". Bloom added that this is the major difference between Estraven and Ai, and allows Estraven the freedom to carry out actions that Ai cannot; Estraven [...] "is better able to love, and freed therefore to sacrifice".|$|E
50|$|The {{fossil record}} as Darwin knew it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> the major {{metazoan}} groups {{appeared in a}} few million years of the early to mid-Cambrian, {{and even in the}} 1980s, this still appeared to be the case.|$|R
50|$|Individual {{deterrence}} {{may be said}} to {{be aimed}} primarily at the prevention of recidivism, although the rate of recidivism in South Africa is around ninety per cent, which would <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> it is not meeting with success.|$|R
50|$|Casorate Primo was {{referred}} to as an oppidum in the 15th century, which would <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> it had city walls, similar to some nearby communes such as Binasco and Rosate. Historians <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> such walls were flattened in 1783.|$|R
