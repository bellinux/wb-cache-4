In the meantime Alan Hart, Controller of BBC 1, had decided to move the programme from an autumn to a <b>spring</b> <b>transmission</b> slot. This was partly because, after eighteen years on Saturday evenings, he had also decided to change the transmission date, running the series twice-weekly on weekdays instead of once a week on Saturdays. This had the effect of halving the number of weeks the series was on-air to thirteen instead of twenty-six, and moving from an autumn to a spring debut. Additionally, Davison was also working on the BBC sit com Sink or Swim and was unavailable to record enough episodes to make an autumn start date viable.|$|E

In this paper, we examine a few existing mechanisms which provide {{the potential for the}} evolvabilityofa population to itself evolve. One key property that we identify among such mechanisms is a many-to-one genotype-to-phenotype mapping, which permits variations in evolvability to occur independent of tness. Another is the propensity for individuals to become increasingly conservative in parent-o <b>spring</b> <b>transmission</b> as they become more t, a phenomenon which becomes stronger as selection pressure becomes weaker. ...|$|E
40|$|Recently {{researchers}} {{have recognized the}} potential effects of climate variability and climate change on infectious disease ecology. Mosquito-borne diseases are of considerable concern due to their reliance on temperature to regulate vector reproduction, survival, and vector and agent development. Precipitation is also influential because it helps maintain habitat for immature mosquitoes. The interactions between climate, vector, and agent are complex, however, and thus assessing the overall impact of climate on disease occurrence is difficult. Discerning the influence of climate on mosquito-borne diseases requires an interdisciplinary synthesis {{of knowledge about the}} relationships between components of the disease system and analysis techniques that account for the individual and interacting roles that each element contributes to the ecology of the disease. In this dissertation, climate and climate change influences on dengue fever and West Nile virus are identified through process based modeling to simulate changes in vector and viral transmission dynamics. Analysis of the literature pertaining to climate influences on dengue virus ecology reveals that climate variables often interact interdependently to influence dengue virus transmission. Statistical techniques correlating or modeling climate-dengue relationships are often inconsistent and location specific. Process based modeling has been employed to better simulate the intricacies and non-linear dynamics involved, but most models focus only on vector populations. Therefore, models should incorporate viral development and transmission components to better simulate dengue virus ecology. A model of West Nile virus vector dynamics across the southern United States reveals that impacts from climate change are very location and context-specific. While temperatures generally increase the season length of vector activity, changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration dynamics often lead to lower summer mosquito populations and limited population development in water-stressed areas. A simulation of dengue fever cases in San Juan County, Puerto Rico with a coupled vector-epidemiological model showed strong agreement when compared with reported case data (Willmott's d = 0. 90 and r 2 = 0. 71). The model indicates that certain climate variables became disease limiting during specific times of the year. Temperature limits virus transmission during the winter by slowing viral development while lower precipitation limits <b>spring</b> <b>transmission</b> by suppressing vector populations...|$|E

The frame was changed to a fully sprung design using a swing-arm with non-adjustable hydraulic shockers at the rear, while the front used a brand-new telescopic fork of Royal Enfield's own design. This enabled the introduction of a bench seat made of simple foam and with no large <b>springs.</b> Power <b>transmission</b> was via the same four-speed Albion gearbox as the previous model, with a unique 'neutral-finder' lever the rider could press from any gear other than first to shift to neutral.

A three-node, isoparametric cable element having three translational and a torsional degree-of-freedom at each node is developed to model a conductor. Support insulator strings and remote conductor spans are represented by linear static <b>springs.</b> A <b>transmission</b> line’s interactions with a support tower are modelled through the tower’s equivalent stiffness at the conductor’s suspension point. An expedient time marching scheme is developed to obtain the envelope of galloping. The scheme can be utilized to integrate dynamic equilibrium equations involving not only geometric and material nonlinearities but also nonlinear damping. Time integration is performed in the sub-space to minimize computational effort. The finite element model has been employed to successfully simulate field galloping records.

40|$|Paper no. IMECE 2014 - 37785 Volume 8 A entitled: Heat Transfer and Thermal EngineeringThe {{interface}} {{mixing of}} metal-organic semiconductor layers plays a remarkable role in thermal transport in organic electronic devices. Here we apply the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) {{to simulate the}} effect of the interface mixing on thermal boundary conductance (TBC) of Ag-pentacene and Ag-CuPc thin films. The <b>spring</b> constant-dependent <b>transmission</b> coefficient is considered in the simulation to investigate {{the effect of the}} interfacial bonding on TBC. The simulation result is compared with the experimental result of Ag-CuPc thin film obtained by other research group. By varying the thickness and composition of the intermixing layer, a significant variation of the thermal boundary conductance of the thin film is observed. The total thermal boundary conductance will increase with the spring constant per area. The increase of the thickness of the intermixing layer leads to the downward trend of the total thermal boundary conductance and it is attributed to the enhancement of the intrinsic thermal resistance of the intermixing layer. These findings suggest the interfacial bonding, thickness and composition of the metal-organic intermixing layer should be carefully controlled to achieve the desired thermal boundary conductance...|$|R
40|$|Sound {{transmission}} through walls {{varies with}} {{the frequency of the}} sound and the mass and stiffness of the construction. An effective way of obtaining a large amount of sound insulation for a given weight per unit area is by means of a double wall construction. For simplicity, consider a double wall made of two single panels, each of which alone would have the mass law transmission loss characteristic. Place these two panels m_ 1 and m_ 2 parallel to each other at a distance d apart, with only air in space between. Assume that the panels are very large and that they are clamped around the edges {{in such a way that}} there is no flanking. The air space between the two panels behaves like a simple spring. The stiffness of this spring is inversely proportional to the spacing. The two panels are simply two masses, one on each end of the <b>spring.</b> The <b>transmission</b> loss of the double wall increases as the separation of the two parts of the double wall increase, provided the distance between them is less than a wave length, and the combined transmission loss of two panels should be the sum of the transmission losses for the separate panels when the distance between them is much greather than the wave length of the transmitted sound. Sound is not transmitted in vacuum space. If the pressure of the space between walls is very small, it is possible for the transmission loss to become even greater than the value as discussed above. In this paper, the authors studied on the transmission loss of the double wall with decompressed air space and the theoretical equations of TL were investigated...|$|R

40|$|The modern wine {{industry}} needs tools for process control and quality assessment {{in order to}} better manage fermentation or bottling processes. During wine fermentation it is important to measure both substrate and product concentrations (e. g. sugars, phenolic compounds), however, the analysis of these compounds by traditional means requires sample preparation and in some cases several steps of purification are needed. The combination of visible/near-infrared (Vis/NIR) spectroscopy and chemometrics potentially provides an ideal solution to accurately and rapidly monitor physical or chemical changes in wine during processing without the need for chemical analysis. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the possibility of combining spectral and multivariate techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA), discriminant partial least squares (DPLS), or linear discriminant analysis (LDA), to monitor time-related changes that occur during red wine fermentation. Samples (n = 652) were collected at various times from several pilot scale fermentations with grapes from either Cabernet Sauvignon or Shiraz varieties, over three vintages (2001 - 2003) and scanned using a monochromator instrument (Foss-NIRSystems 6500, Silver <b>Spring,</b> MD) in <b>transmission</b> mode (400 - 2, 500 nm). PCA was used to demonstrate consistent progressive spectral changes that occur through the time course of the fermentation.

40|$|Infection with verocytotoxin {{producing}} Escherichia coli   (VTEC) O 157 {{in humans}} {{can lead to}} mild or bloody diarrhoea, with e. g. the haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) as possible complication. Cattle appear to be important reservoirs of O 157 VTEC. The main objectives of research described in this thesis are investigating prevalences, risk factors, and transmission of O 157 VTEC to understand the dynamics of O 157 VTEC in Dutch cattle. Data from a monitoring program in Dutch animal herds indicated that O 157 VTEC is endemic in The Netherlands, with higher prevalences during summer and early fall. Risk factors for infection were identified. Within-herd prevalence, potential environmental reservoirs, intermediate hosts and DNA types of O 157 VTEC isolates were determined in a longitudinal study of a positive dairy farm. DNA clusters indicated persistence on the farm during winter and <b>spring.</b> Quantification of <b>transmission</b> using data from this dairy herd and from an experiment with calves showed that transmission was higher in calves. Transmission of O 157 VTEC during summer might differ from transmission during winter. Two other experiments indicated that both previously infected heifers and previously contaminated pastures did not function as reservoir of O 157 VTEC between shedding seasons. A retrospective cohort study established that positive farms from the Dutch monitoring program were only slightly {{more likely to be}} found positive in a next shedding season than previously negative farms, so between-herd transmission seems to occur. Factors associated with a positive test at second sampling implied (re-) introduction rather than long-term persistence of infection. Results of this thesis suggest that several types of O 157 VTEC might persist on a farm for some time, with possibly different strains as the most prevailing types in subsequent shedding seasons. Ultimately, the within-herd infection might become extinct due to limiting numbers of susceptible cattle. Between-herd transmission of O 157 VTEC can lead to persistence in a larger region, e. g. The Netherlands, maintaining the endemic status in Dutch cattle populations. Because of this, exposure of humans to O 157 VTEC cannot be ruled out in The Netherlands. Humans might become infected through food- and waterborne transmission and by transmission directly from animals to humans. When aiming at reducing risks for humans by interventions at farm-level, it is of importance {{to reduce the number of}} positive animals and farms. For this, more specific research for the effect of intervention measures on introduction, transmission and survival of O 157 VTEC on farms, and economic (cost-benefit) analysis, should be performed...|$|R
