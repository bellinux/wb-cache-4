5|$|Her husband {{announced}} {{his campaign for}} President of the United States in mid-1999, something that she agreed to. <b>She</b> <b>did</b> <b>say,</b> however, {{that she had never}} dreamed that he would run for office. The Bush campaign worked to assure voters that as First Lady, she would not seek to emulate then-First Lady Hillary Clinton. When asked who she would be like out of the past First Ladies, she insisted it would be herself.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} {{abortion}} in 2000, Bush {{said she did}} not believe Roe v. Wade should be overturned. She did not comment on whether women had the right to an abortion. <b>She</b> <b>did</b> <b>say,</b> however, that the country should do [...] "what we can {{to limit the number of}} abortions, to try to reduce the number of abortions in a lot of ways, and that is, by talking about responsibility with girls and boys, by teaching abstinence, having abstinence classes everywhere in schools and in churches and in Sunday school".|$|E
500|$|On August 12, 2014, the ACLU and Manning's {{civilian}} attorney David Coombs said Manning was {{not receiving}} treatment for her gender identity condition as previously approved by Secretary of Defense Hagel. They notified the USDB, Hagel and other Defense Department officials that a lawsuit would be filed {{if they did}} not confirm by September 4 that treatment would be provided. On August 22, Army spokeswoman Lt. Col. Alayne Conway told NBC News, [...] "The Department of Defense has approved a request by Army leadership to provide required medical treatment for an inmate diagnosed with gender dysphoria." [...] Although Conway would not discuss [...] "the medical needs of an individual", <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "In general terms, the initial stages of treatment for individuals with gender dysphoria include psychotherapy and elements of the 'real life experience' therapy. Treatment for the condition is highly individualized and generally is sequential and graduated." [...] The Army declined to say when treatment might begin.|$|E

6000|$|... "She's got {{too much}} to say," [...] thought Marilla, [...] "but she might be trained out of that. And there's nothing rude or slangy in what <b>she</b> <b>does</b> <b>say.</b> <b>She's</b> ladylike. It's likely her people were nice folks." ...|$|R
5000|$|In the 1981 mini-series The Borgias, Sancia {{was played}} by Eleanor David. In this adaptation, her adulterous affairs are focused solely on Cesare, {{although}} <b>she</b> <b>does</b> <b>say</b> that <b>she</b> {{not only has}} affairs with his brother Juan, but their father Rodrigo as well.|$|R
500|$|The {{video was}} criticized {{for the absence of}} story line by critics such as Laura Brooks of 'TeenToday', who [...] {{described}} the video as [...] " [...] to show off her lovely hair and her thighs" [...] that [...] "also features David Guetta who appears to have remembered at several points throughout the video that he's left his iron on dashes off to remedy the situation." [...] Alyssa Rosenberg of The Atlantic agreed, calling the clip [...] "dopey ... with guys who forgot to wash the home dye out of their hair" [...] (sic) and the dancing was on-par with sci-fi film The Matrix Reloaded. However <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>say</b> that [...] "It's a high-concept understanding of the dance floor, even if it's not my preferred interpretation of that space. If love and shaking it are war, Kelly seems like she'd be a pretty decent person to have boss you around in both." [...] Meanwhile Sound Savvy said [...] "There's some nice moves and Kelly sports some sexy looks for the clip. 'Commander' has received CRAZY airplay and the reception has been overwhelmingly positive for this track. I kinda dig the video, but I would've liked more choreography." ...|$|E
2500|$|She did {{not claim}} that she fought until being wounded, but <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>say</b> her weapon jammed {{immediately}} {{and that she}} could not have done anything anyway. Interviewed by Diane Sawyer, Lynch claimed, concerning the media and the Pentagon: [...] "They used me to symbolize all this stuff. It's wrong. I don't know why they filmed [...] or why they say these things." [...] She also stated [...] "I did not shoot, not a round, nothing. I went down praying to my knees. And that's the last I remember." ...|$|E
2500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Ahsan Haque of IGN {{stated that the}} [...] "scenes that worked in this episode were creatively brilliant" [...] but he did criticize some of the episode's jokes; ending his review by saying that [...] "with a bit more polish, this episode {{could have been a}} great one" [...] and he rated the episode a 7.4 out of 10. Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club graded the episode a B- and while she acknowledged MacFarlane's involvement was missing, <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>say</b> that it [...] "felt very much like Family Guy, albeit a not-so-great episode". Robert Pierson from the TV Critic also gave the episode a mixed review; he compared the story to the ones from the episodes of the show's first season which he stated was [...] "a good thing" [...] although he did classify the episode's jokes as [...] "more miss than hit"; he ended his review by calling the episode [...] "a fun story with plenty of good jokes flowing from it" [...] and he gave it a 58 out of 100.|$|E

6000|$|VALENTINE (rising in {{the wildest}} agitation). What! What! (Beginning to speak very fast.) When <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>say</b> that? Who <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>say</b> that to? ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>did</b> not <b>say</b> {{anything}} for a while, and when she spoke it was hesitatingly.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will say}} it fifty times,--till your ears are weary with it";--and <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>say</b> it to him, after her own fashion, fifty times.|$|E
60|$|Marilla {{opened her}} lips to say she knew not what of apology or deprecation. What <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>say</b> was a {{surprise}} to herself then and ever afterwards.|$|E

60|$|<b>She.</b> <b>Doing</b> little, <b>saying</b> less, and {{thinking}} a great deal. I've hardly been out at all.|$|R
6000|$|... "Little Joscelyn wasn't {{much of a}} talker," [...] said Aunty Nan dreamily. [...] "She {{was kind}} of a quiet child. But you {{remember}} what <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>say.</b> And I've never forgotten little Joscelyn." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{sorry to}} baulk Feemy of her walk, Captain Ussher, if <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>say</b> so. It's not very often I {{ask her to}} put herself out for me; but this afternoon, I shall feel obliged to her not to go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope not," [...] {{interrupted}} the other, [...] "but {{the fact is}} that I put the question you have supposed to Minnie long ago, and <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>say</b> `Yes' to it then, so it's not likely she's goin' to draw back now." ...|$|E

60|$|Hetty turned very white. Then {{she looked}} up at Harry, and then <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not <b>say</b> a single word.|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite so," [...] said Sophia. Sophia's wit {{was usually}} ready enough, {{but at that}} moment she could not resolve with what words she might make the most {{appropriate}} reply to her--friend. What <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>say</b> was rather lame, but it was not dangerous.|$|E
60|$|The {{trepidation}} {{caused by}} these thoughts {{on what she}} had intended to say shook so naturally the words <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>say,</b> that Knight never for a moment suspected them to be a last moment's substitution. He smiled and pressed her hand warmly.|$|E
6000|$|Whether Rosita {{would have}} comprehended this without Mary's blushes might be questioned, but <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>say,</b> 'Ah! yes! {{you were to}} have married the Visconde, were you not? El Senor was so angry! Did his father forbid when your father refused your portion?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You needn't {{imply that}} I {{like it to}} be in the dark. I would like to walk with you in broad day past all the houses in Leatherwood. But I don't suppose you'd let me."

60|$|What the {{destitute}} {{subject of}} such an offer tried to say, I need not repeat. What <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>say,</b> I could more easily tell, if it were worth the telling. What she felt, and will feel to her dying hour, I could never relate.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, a great deal. That is--no, not much, {{but what}} <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>say</b> was very interesting.
