40|$|The maximum ice-sheet {{extent of}} a {{glaciation}} or glacial phase is {{in most cases}} indicated by the position of end moraines.

The Charlottenthal profile is not characteristic in a sedimentological sense of a typical marginal end moraine or a sandur.

50|$|Uluru is dominantly {{composed}} of coarse-grained arkose (a type of sandstone {{characterized by an}} abundance of feldspar) and some conglomerate. Average composition is 50% feldspar, 25-35% quartz and up to 25% rock fragments; most feldspar is K-feldspar with only minor plagioclase as subrounded grains and highly altered inclusions within K-feldspar. The grains are typically 2 - 4 mm in diameter, and are angular to subangular; the finer sandstone is well sorted, with sorting decreasing with increasing grain size. The rock fragments include subrounded basalt, invariably replaced to various degrees by chlorite and epidote. The minerals present suggest derivation from a predominantly granite source, similar to the Musgrave Block exposed to the south. When relatively fresh, the rock has a grey colour, but weathering of iron-bearing minerals {{by the process of}} oxidation gives the outer surface layer of rock a red-brown rusty colour.

In order to depict its facies associations and depositional elements as well as to characterize the fluvial style, a facies and architectural element analysis was carried out in the eastern outcrop belt in Santa Catarina and Paraná States, southern Brazil.

40|$|Steep slopes {{prone to}} mass wasting {{processes}} such as debris flows cause extensive damage on hill country farms and adjacent lowlands. Fan activity is episodic and can be deciphered using soil stratigraphic techniques. Bullock creek fan is an active, debris flow dominated fan, covering 300 hectares. The fault shear zone on the eastern flank of Mount Thomas provides an abundant and easily eroded source of brecciated siltstones and highly fractured sandstones. The resultant fan sediments are mainly sandy matrix supported, gravelly to bouldery debris flow deposits and finer, massive or laminated <b>sheet</b> <b>flood</b> deposits. Five geomorphic surfaces have been recognised. The soils that characterise the three late Holocene surfaces, displayed increasing development from Fluvial Recent Soils (Entisols-USA), to Stony Brown Soils (Inceptisols-USA). Orthic Brown Soils (Aquepts-USA) formed in mixed loess and gravelly alluvium occurred on a mid to early Holocene surface, and Fragic Pallic Soils (Fragiaquepts-USA) were formed in 2. 5 metres of loess overlying a Late Pleistocene surface. In areas of thinner, <b>sheet</b> <b>flood</b> deposits, on the younger geomorphic surfaces, multisequal soil profiles with evident buried horizons were more common than unisequal soil profiles. By comparison, the thicker, debris flow lobes displayed a gradient of multisequal to unisequal soil profiles, from the edge to {{the centre of the}} lobes. Much of the detailed history of recent fan activity could be interpreted from the stratigraphy and distribution of multisequal soil profiles. With increased soil development and surface age, multisequal soils evolved to take on the morphological characteristics of unisequal soils and the details of earlier fan activity could only be broadly interpreted. The current period of fan activity has been occurring since the early 1900 's, producing a surface, dominated by Fluvial Recent Soils, which covered 60 % of the fan. In excess of ten deposition events were recognisable from the stratigraphy in the multisequal Fluvial Recent Soils. There has been significant aggradation on the mid and lower segments of the fan. Sedimentation, since 1978 has been largely confined to the back-filling of a fan head trench and valley floor. Soil development and the re-establishment of pastures on the aggrading fan surface had been enhanced by the texture and natural fertility of the sediments. <b>Sheet</b> <b>flood</b> deposits produced more easily cultivated soils because of their finer and more uniform soil textural properties and better moisture regime. Further phases of fan aggradation, caused by erosion of stored sediments in the valley floor and fan head, are anticipated in coming decades...|$|E

40|$|Horseshoe waterfalls are {{ubiquitous}} in natural streams, bedrock canyons, and engineering structures. Nevertheless, water flow patterns upstream of horseshoe waterfalls are poorly known and likely {{differ from the}} better studied case of a one-dimensional linear step because of flow focusing into the horseshoe. This is a significant knowledge gap because the hydraulics at waterfalls controls sediment transport and bedrock incision, which can compromise the integrity of engineered structures and influence the evolution of river canyons on Earth and Mars. Here we develop new semiempirical theory for the spatial acceleration of water upstream of, and the cumulative discharge into, horseshoe canyons and waterfalls. To this end, we performed 110 numerical experiments by solving the 2 -D depth-averaged shallow-water equations {{for a wide range}} of flood depths, widths and discharges, and canyon lengths, widths and bed gradients. We show that the upstream, normal flow Froude number is the dominant control on lateral flow focusing and acceleration into the canyon head and that focusing is limited when the flood width is small compared to a cross-stream backwater length scale. In addition, for <b>sheet</b> <b>floods</b> much wider than the canyon, flow focusing into the canyon head leads to reduced discharge (and drying in cases) across the canyon sidewalls, which is especially pronounced for canyons that are much longer than they are wide.
