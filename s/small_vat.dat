Unfortunately, no such workshop is known from Britain for the Early Medieval period. However, a double-checked trace of bromine, indicating the presence of whelk-dye, has been found on one page of an Anglo-Saxon book known as the Barberini Gospels. This manuscript dates to the late 8th or early 9th century AD, and the whelk dye occurs as a background panel to white lettering at the beginning of St John’s gospel. Efforts have also been made to find whelk dye on surviving fragments of Anglo-Saxon textiles, but the chemical analyses so far carried out have proved negative for bromine.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1999 Strains of Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis and Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris with {{potential}} {{use in the}} food industry which had been previously isolated from nature using 16 S rRNA probes were characterized for unique identifying traits and for attributes important for potential use in cheese manufacture. Strains of Lc. cremoris which showed desirable characteristics for cheesemaking were selected for Cheddar cheese making trials where they were used first as single strains then in combination. Biochemical testing included lithium chloride sensitivity using Alsan medium. Strains of Lc. cremoris showed greater sensitivity to lithium chloride than Lc. lactis. strains. however sensitivity was generally indicated by reduced colony size rather than absence of growth as predicted for Lc. cremoris. strains. Strains of both Lc. lactis and Lc. cremoris produced blue colonies on Alsan medium indicating citrate utilization. Citrate utilization could not be confirmed by other traditional methods. Carbohydrate utilization using API 50 test kits revealed no pattern which could definitively differentiate strains of Lc. lactis from Lc. cremoris. It was found that all strains fermented galactose, D-glucose. D-fructose. D-mannose. N-acetyl glucosamine and lactose. Regardless of genotype. strains which were shown to be phenotypically Lc. lactis generally fermented additional carbohydrates. whereas Lc. cremoris phenotype strains did not. Only one probe-isolated strain of Lc. lactis fermented D-xylose. Tests to identify potential Cheddar cheese starter strains were performed on all environmental isolates. All strains which were phenotypically identified as Lc. lactis were rejected as potential starters because they railed to coagulate milk after 15 to 18 hours or they developed undesirable flavors in milk. Nine of twenty strains that were both phenotypically and genotypically Lc. cremoris were identified as having good potential for use as Cheddar cheese starter cultures. Four strains (MS- 9, MS- 23, MS- 24, MS- 51) were selected for Cheddar cheesemaking trials. Twenty <b>small</b> <b>vats</b> of cheese were made using {{each of the four}} strains individually then in every possible combination.

40|$|In {{common with}} many {{developing}} countries, Bangladesh faces problems in raising sufficient tax revenues to fund its {{economic and social}} development. To address this problem and to improve economic efficiency and growth, a major tax reform program was initiated in 1991 which centred on {{the introduction of a}} valued-added tax (VAT) to replace a range of narrowly-based consumption taxes. This paper revisit the basic structure of VAT system of Bangladesh and attempt to analysis the contribution and performance of VAT in Bangladesh as comparing to other developing countries and also attempt to identify and provide some suggestions in possible area where attention and improved performance are required to enhance the contribution of VAT in economic development of Bangladesh. The relevant data shows that the performance of VAT was quite satisfactory in the initial years - but subsequently VAT collection has remained stagnant at a certain level. As a result, VAT is unable to meet the objectives for which it was introduced. The reasons behind this performance are many, such as: a relatively <b>small</b> number of <b>VAT</b> tax-payers, a general lack of awareness, and a weak monitoring system etc. There is still scope for improving the revenue collection from VAT: by increasing the number of VAT taxpayers; reforming the VAT administration; creating intensive awareness among the people, revisiting the list of VAT exempted items and increasing the efficiency of the monitoring system...|$|R

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVES: To {{describe}} a non-invasive guidance procedure, using intraoperative cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) and augmented fluoroscopy to guide lung resection during video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS). METHODS: Patients with solitary or multiple lung nodules between 5 and 20 mm in size were included. Under general anaesthesia, a moderate pneumothorax allowing the CBCT acquisition was first performed. Then a segmentation of the lesion {{was performed on}} a 3 D reconstruction. A projection of this 3 D reconstruction was then integrated into the digital workspace and automatically registered into the fluoroscopic images, creating an augmented fluoroscopy. The procedure was continued under classic video-thoracoscopic vision taking account of the augmented fluoroscopy to locate the targeted nodule. RESULTS: Eight patients were included (mean age 61 ± 11. 7 years) : 7 patients had an isolated lesion and 1 patient had two lesions (mean size 13. 2 ± 5. 1 mm). Their mean depth to the pleura was 21. 4 ± 10. 7 mm. Four patients underwent a wedge resection associated with lymph node resection. Two patients had an initial wedge resection followed by a complementary lobectomy associated with lymph node resection (primary lung tumour). One patient had a wedge resection in the upper lobe and a lobectomy of the inferior lobe associated with lymph node resection. One patient underwent a conversion and a bilobectomy due to vascular injury. The mean global operating time was 100. 6 ± 36. 7 min. All the nodules have been identified on the CBCT acquisitions. The segmentation of the lesion has been performed in all cases. We {{have been able to}} detect all the nodules and to successfully perform the resection in all cases owing to the augmented fluoroscopy. The mean fluoroscopic time was 134. 2 ± 55. 0 s. The mean imaging time, between the incision and the final nodule localization, was 11. 8 ± 3. 8 min. CONCLUSIONS: This paper is the first describing a clinical application of CBCT performed during thoracic surgery. Associated with augmented reality, it offers a significant progress in VATS resection of subpalpable lung nodules. This preliminary experience highlights the potential of the proposed CBCT approach to improve the perception of targeted <b>small</b> tumours during <b>VAT...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} ADRN {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Inter-Departmental Business Register (IDBR) is a comprehensive dataset of UK businesses which covers 99 percent of UK economic activity, holding records of approximately 2. 1 million businesses. The IDBS does not cover very <b>small</b> businesses without <b>VAT</b> or PAYE schemes (i. e. self-employed and those with low turnover and without employees) and some non-profit making organisations. The number of these businesses in the UK {{is estimated to be}} at 2. 3 million. The dataset also includes business with international operations or whose head office might be abroad. The data is available from 1994 / 95 onwards. The register is compiled from the following sources&# 58; Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) data on businesses registered for Value Added Tax (VAT) and employers operating a Pay As You Earn (PAYE) tax system for their employees. Companies House which provides information on incorporated businesses. Office for National Statistics (ONS) survey data and survey information from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment – Northern Ireland (DETINI) and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) farms register. The register includes information on business name, address, standard industrial classification, employment and employees, turnover, legal status and company number. Intrastate data on the value of goods and services that are traded (imports and exports) between the EU member states and the UK are also included. The dataset also includes foreign ownership codes and additional geographical variables such as parliamentary constituency and travel to work area. The IDBR complies with European Union regulation 2186 / 93 on harmonisation of business registers for statistical purposes and is protected by the National Statistics Code of Practice and by the Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007. The IDBR is mainly used by the ONS, government departments and local authorities as a sampling frame, or to update and expand previously conducted surveys. An annual publication providing a size analysis of UK businesses is available free on the National Statistics website for years from 1995 to 2013. Other analyses of IDBR data are available on the Neighbourhood Statistics and Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform websites. The details collected in the IDBR are maintained in two separate databases. One is known as ‘reporting units’, and this is for the head office or sole site of a business. The second is known as ‘enterprise units’ or ‘local units’ which are the local offices, plants or sites owned by the reporting unit. The two databases can be linked using the reporting unit reference number. The Inter-Departmental Business Register is large and so a time lag exists between businesses opening and being added or removed. Defunct businesses are generally slower to be removed from the register than when new businesses are added. Please note that re-classification of an industry or enterprise can occur {{as a result of a}} relatively small change in the nature of its operations, and this can have significant knock-on effects on industrial estimates produced by surveys using the IDBR for sampling. It is also important to note that because the IDBR is a live database, with fixed extracts being taken annually then historical or longitudinal analyses can prove difficult. Major events in the ‘lifetime’ of a business (e. g. mergers, bankruptcies, etc.) may not be reliably captured by either extracts taken from the live IDBR or from the annual ‘cuts’ of data. Small businesses, not registered for VAT, will also be under-represented in the IDBR. The IDBR is a dynamic live register and is updated on a daily basis. Fixed extracts are taken in March and populate the Business Structure Database (BSD). This dataset is an annual snapshot of the IDBR and is available through the Office for National Statistics’ Virtual Micro Laboratory. This linked, longitudinal derivative of the IDBR is employed to produce summary statistics which are usually published the following September on the National Statistics website. Research Usage and Linkage The Inter-Departmental Business Register enables Government and Local Authorities to conduct efficient and cost effective surveys/samples with minimum burden on businesses. It is used for labour market statistics and national accounts, as well as providing information on the structure of the economy (for example, business births and deaths) and monitoring targets. It also enables analyses of business activity and provides the information used to identify business to be included or have not responded to surveys and samples. The Inter-Departmental Business Register (IDBR) is made up of two separate databases; one for business head offices and the other for local offices. These are linked using a unique reference number. If a business continues to trade then data could be linked longitudinally. In theory, IDBR could be linked to HMRC employee or taxpayer records through PAYE reference numbers but this has not been done to date. The UK Data Service holds the following IDBR-related data&# 58; SN 6697 Business Structure Database&# 58; Secure Access (BSD) The BSD is derived primarily from the IDBR, complimented with data from ONS business surveys.
