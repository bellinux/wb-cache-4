5|$|Some {{fragments}} of the priory travelled further afield. At Hardwick Hall near Sedgefield, a mock ruin was built incorporating <b>sculptured</b> stones brought from the priory. The priory's wealth became the stuff of local legends, one of which claimed an underground passage led from the priory to a cave under the hills in which a raven stood guard over a chest of gold.|$|E

5|$|The <b>sculptured</b> puffball grows solitarily or {{in small}} groups in forest duff. It is {{typically}} associated with coniferous forests at high elevations, greater than about , on western mountains like the Sierra Nevada and the Cascade Range.

The park was officially opened by His Royal Highness, the Duke of Connaught on 15 July 1914.|$|E
5|$|Butterfly {{eggs are}} {{protected}} by a hard-ridged outer layer of shell, called the chorion. This is lined with a thin coating of wax which prevents the egg from drying out before the larva has had time to fully develop. Each egg contains a number of tiny funnel-shaped openings at one end, called micropyles; {{the purpose of these}} holes is to allow sperm to enter and fertilize the egg. Butterfly eggs vary greatly in size and shape between species, but are usually upright and finely <b>sculptured.</b> Some species lay eggs singly, others in batches. Many females produce between one hundred and two hundred eggs.|$|E

5|$|Formerly in {{the genus}} Clemmys, the wood turtle {{is now a}} member of the genus Glyptemys, a {{classification}} that the wood turtle shares with only the bog turtle. It and the bog turtle have a similar genetic makeup, which is marginally {{different from that of the}} spotted turtle (Clemmys guttata), the only current member of the genus Clemmys. The wood turtle has undergone extensive scientific name changes by various scientists over the course of its history. Today, there are several prominent common names for the wood turtle, including <b>sculptured</b> tortoise, red-legged tortoise, and redleg.|$|E
5|$|Founded as {{a cathedral}} in 597, the {{earliest}} parts are from 1070, completed 1505, except the north west tower of 1834. Canterbury {{is one of}} the biggest cathedrals in England, and seat of the Archbishop of Canterbury. It is famous for the Norman crypt with <b>sculptured</b> capitals, the east end of 1175–84 by William of Sens, the 12th- and 13th-century stained glass, the “supremely beautiful” Perpendicular nave of 1379–1405 by Henry Yevele, the fan vault of the tower of 1505 by John Wastell, the tomb of the Black Prince and the site of the murder of St. Thomas Becket.|$|E

5|$|The North Group was {{occupied}} from the Terminal Classic {{through to the}} Postclassic. This group's structures were built using a different method {{from those in the}} Central Group, and were made out of compacted clay without stone construction or facing. The group occupies Terraces7 through 9, which follow the contours of the natural terracing present and show no evidence of significant artificial levelling. In combination with a noted absence of <b>sculptured</b> monuments, the different construction methods and ceramic assemblages associated with this group imply an occupation of the North Group by a new settlement community who arrived in the Late Classic period, most probably K'iche' Maya from the highlands.|$|E
5|$|The eastern box turtle (Terrapene c. carolina) and Blanding's turtle {{are similar}} in {{appearance}} to the wood turtle and all three live in overlapping habitats. However, unlike the wood turtle, both Blanding's turtle and the eastern box turtle have hinged plastrons {{that allow them to}} completely close their shells. The diamondback terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin) has a shell closely resembling the wood turtle's; however its skin is gray in color, and it inhabits coastal brackish and saltwater marshes. The bog turtle and spotted turtle are also similar, but neither of these has the specific <b>sculptured</b> surface found on the carapaces of the wood turtle.|$|E
5|$|The <b>sculptured</b> mounds {{sometimes}} have elaborate and distinctive forms, {{such as those}} of the compass termite (Amitermes meridionalis and A. laurensis), which builds tall, wedge-shaped mounds with the long axis oriented approximately north–south, which gives them their common name. This orientation has been experimentally shown to assist thermoregulation. The north-south orientation causes the internal temperature of a mound to increase rapidly during the morning while avoiding overheating from the midday sun. The temperature then remains at a plateau {{for the rest of the}} day until the evening.|$|E
