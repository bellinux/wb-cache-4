For comparison, we also {{investigated the}} corresponding feathers in pigeons (Columba livia), kestrels (Falco tinnunculus), and sparrowhawks (Accipiter nisus). In all four species, the Young's moduli of the feathers ranged from 5. 9 to 8. 4 GPa. The feather shafts of F. peregrinus had the largest cross-sections and the highest <b>specific</b> bending <b>stiffness.</b> When normalized with respect to body mass, the <b>specific</b> bending <b>stiffness</b> of primary number 10 was highest in F. tinnunculus, while that of the alula was highest in A. nisus. In comparison, the <b>specific</b> bending <b>stiffness,</b> measured {{at the base of}} the tail feathers and in dorso-ventral bending direction, was much higher in F. peregrinus than in the other three species. This seems to correlate with the flight styles of the birds: F. tinnunculus hovers and its primaries might therefore withstand large mechanical forces. A. nisus has often to change its flight directions during hunting and perhaps needs its alulae for this maneuvers, and in F. peregrinus, the base of the tail feathers might need a high stiffness during breaking after diving...|$|R

40|$|Graphite-reinforced {{aluminum}} alloy metal-matrix composites are among materials {{being considered for}} structural components in dimensionally stable space structures. This application requires materials with low values of thermal expansions and high <b>specific</b> <b>stiffnesses.</b> They must remain stable during exposures to the space environment for periods extending to 20 years. The effects of thermal cycling on the thermal expansion behavior and mechanical properties of Thornel P 100 graphite 6061 aluminum composites, as fabricated and after thermal processing to eliminate thermal strain hysteresis, have been investigated. Two groups of composites were studied: one was fabricated by hot roll bonding and the other by diffusion bonding. Processing significantly reduced strain hysteresis during thermal cycling in both groups and improved the ultimate tensile strength and modulus in the diffusion-bonded composites. Thermal cycling stabilized the as-fabricated composites by reducing the residual fabrication stress and increased the matrix strength by metallurgical aging. Thermal expansion behavior of both groups after processing was insensitive to thermal cycling. Data scatter was too large to determine effects of thermal cycling on the mechanical properties.

40|$|One {{strategy}} {{to deal with}} unwanted vibrations of lightweight structures is to actively control systems using integrated actuators, such as piezoceramic multilayer actuators. In the presented research work, selective laser melting is used to manufacture active struts by integrating multilayer actuator into a metallic, monolithic housing. Besides the fulfilment of manufacturing constraints (e. g. low volume and individualization), a major objective {{of this study is}} to demonstrate the potential of selective laser melting for application tailored smart components. A truss structure is used as demonstration platform. Based on experimentally validated numerical models of the truss structure, a beneficial position of the active strut and the mode to be damped are determined. A model of the multilayer actuator and corresponding housing allows the dimensioning of the housing stiffness to maximize the electromechanical coupling. Thus, an efficient resistive resonant shunted system can be achieved. Numerically designed active struts with <b>specific</b> <b>stiffnesses</b> are manufactured and experimentally characterized.

40|$|Rock {{fractures}} {{filled with}} viscoelastic materials, such as sand, usually contribute to rock mass instability {{under the influence}} of seismic waves and dynamic loads. The {{purpose of this study is}} to verify that the <b>specific</b> fracture <b>stiffness</b> and the <b>specific</b> initial mass of the filling sand are two key fracture parameters in interrelating the physical, mechanical and seismic properties of a rock fracture filled with dry sand. A series of dynamic tests using a split Hopkinson rock bar was conducted on a simulated sand-filled fracture. The experimental results show that stress wave attenuation across the filled fracture is strongly affected by wave reflection and transmission at the fracture interfaces and the dynamic compaction of the filling sand. With the comparison between the analytical predictions by the displacement discontinuity model and the displacement and stress discontinuity model and the experimental results from the laboratory tests, it is found that both models can predict a filled fracture with a smaller thickness (i. e., less than 10 mm). The displacement and stress discontinuity model may be used to predict a fracture with a larger thickness by considering the specific initial mass of filling materials. The wave transmission coefficient for a filled fracture generally increases with increasing <b>specific</b> fracture <b>stiffness...</b>|$|R

40|$|Results from {{a series}} of {{laboratory}} experiments to determine fracture <b>specific</b> <b>stiffness,</b> for a fracture subjected to shear and normal stress, are presented and analyzed. The experimental work focuses on the determination of relations between normal and shear fracture <b>specific</b> <b>stiffness</b> and between spatial distribution of fracture <b>specific</b> <b>stiffness</b> and fluid flow through the fracture ^ The ratio of shear to normal fracture <b>specific</b> <b>stiffness</b> is experimentally investigated on a fracture subjected to shear as well as normal stress. Synthetic fractures made of gypsum and lucite were prepared with different fracture surface conditions: either well-mated or non-mated. For well-mated fracture surfaces, asperities were created by casting gypsum against sandpaper. A block of gypsum was cast against the sandpaper and then a second block was cast against the first block such that the two contact surfaces were well-mated. The surface roughness was controlled by using the sandpapers with different average grit size. Non-mated fracture surfaces were fabricated with two lucite blocks that were polished (lucite PL) or sand-blasted (lucite SB) along their contact surface. In the experiments, each specimen was subjected to normal and shear loading while the fracture was probed with transmitted and reflected compressional and shear waves. Shear and normal fracture specific stiffnesses were calculated using the displacement discontinuity theory. For non-mated fractures, the stiffness ratio was not sensitive to the application of shear stress and, as normal stress increased, approached a theoretical ratio which was determined assuming that the transmission of compressional and shear waves was equal. The stiffness ratio obtained from well-mated fractures ranged from 0. 5 to 1. 4, which deviated from the conventional assumption that shear and normal fracture <b>specific</b> <b>stiffness</b> are equal. The stiffness ratio increased with increasing surface roughness and with increasing shear stress. For well-mated surfaces under normal compression and no shear, the theoretical ratio gave a good approximation to experiment measurements. During shear, at constant load, and for well-mated fractures with large surface roughness, the stiffness ratio strongly depended on the shear fracture <b>specific</b> <b>stiffness</b> and increased with shear up to a maximum prior to failure. ^ The spatial variability of fracture <b>specific</b> <b>stiffness</b> along a fracture was investigated seismically on granite specimens with a single fracture. Seismic measurements on intact and fractured granite specimens were obtained as a function of stress. The granite matrix exhibited stress-sensitivity due to the existence of micro-cracks and was weakly anisotropic, with a ratio of about 0. 9 for shear wave velocities in two orthogonal directions. For fractured granite specimens, transmission of P- and S- waves across a fracture significantly increased as the fracture compressed. The increase of transmission was interpreted as the increase of fracture <b>specific</b> <b>stiffness.</b> Spectral analysis on the transmitted waves showed that the transmission of high frequency components of the signals increased and the dinant frequency approached the value of the intact specimen. The heterogeneity of the granite material resulted in a ± 8 ∼ 12 % variation in stiffness, which depended on the selection of an intact standard. Fracture <b>specific</b> <b>stiffness</b> was estimated at the dominant frequency of 0. 3 MHz for normal <b>specific</b> <b>stiffness</b> and 0. 5 MHz for shear. Fracture <b>specific</b> <b>stiffness</b> was non-uniformly distributed along the fracture plane and changed locally as a function of stress. The spatial variability of stiffness exceeded the variation of stiffness caused by the heterogeneity of granite matrix. It was found that local fracture geometry, e. g. local surface roughness distribution or local micro slope angles, influenced the magnitude of local shear fracture <b>specific</b> <b>stiffness.</b> The more uniform the asperity heights, the stiffer the fracture. Also, high micro-slope angles increased the shear fracture <b>specific</b> <b>stiffness.</b> ^ The seismic response of the rock matrix (granite) and fracture with and without flow was utilized to correlate fluid flow with fracture <b>specific</b> <b>stiffness.</b> Experiments of fluid invasion into a rock matrix and along a fracture showed an increase in wave velocity and a decrease in wave amplitude when the rock became wet. Invasion velocity was determined seismically by tracking the fluid front in the rock matrix. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) ...|$|E

40|$|The remote {{characterization}} of the hydraulic properties of fractures in rocks is important in many subsurface projects. Fractures create uncertainty in the hydraulic properties of the subsurface in that their topology controls the amount of flow that can occur {{in addition to that}} from the matrix. In turn, the fracture topology is also affected by stress which alters the topology as the stress changes directly. This alteration of fracture topology with stress is captured by fracture <b>specific</b> <b>stiffness.</b> The <b>specific</b> <b>stiffness</b> of a single fracture can be remotely probed from the attenuation and velocity of seismic waves. The hydromechanical coupling of single fractures, i. e. the relationship between flow and stiffness, holds the key to finding a method to remotely characterize a fractures hydraulic properties. This thesis is separated into two parts: (1) a description of the hydromechanical coupling of fractures based on numerical models used to generate synthetic fractures, compute the flow through a fracture, and deform fracture topologies to unravel the scaling function that is fundamental to the hydromechanical coupling of single fractures; (2) a Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method was developed to accurately simulate the scattered seismic waves from realistic fracture topologies. ^ The scaling regimes of fluid flow and <b>specific</b> <b>stiffness</b> in weakly correlated fractures are identified by using techniques from Percolation Theory and initially treating the two processes separately. The fixed points associated with fluid flow were found to display critical scaling while the fixed points for <b>specific</b> <b>stiffness</b> were trivial. The two processes could be indirectly related because the trivial scaling of the mechanical properties allowed the <b>specific</b> <b>stiffness</b> to be used as surrogate to the void area fraction. ^ The dynamic transport exponent was extracted at threshold by deforming fracture geometries within the effective medium regime (near the "cubic law 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 regime) to the critical regime. From this, a scaling function was defined for the hydromechanical coupling. This scaling function provides the link between fluid flow and fracture <b>specific</b> <b>stiffness</b> so that seismic waves may be used to remotely probe the hydraulic properties of fractures. Then, the DG method is shown to be capable of measuring such fracture specific stiffnesses by numerically measuring the velocity of interface waves when propagated across laboratory measured fracture geometries of Austin Chalk. ...|$|E
