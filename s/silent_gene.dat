40|$|The {{regulation}} of gene expression programmes {{is essential for}} the generation of diverse cell types during development and for adaptation to environmental signals. RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcribes genetic information and coordinates the recruitment of accessory proteins that are responsible for the establishment of active chromatin states and transcript maturation. RNAPII is post-translationally modified at active genes during transcription initiation, elongation and termination, and thereby recruits specific histone and RNA modifiers. RNAPII complexes are also located at <b>silent</b> <b>genes</b> in promoter-proximal paused configurations that provide dynamic transcriptional regulation downstream from initiation. In embryonic stem cells, <b>silent</b> developmental regulator <b>genes</b> that are repressed by Polycomb are associated with a form of RNAPII that can elongate through coding regions but that lacks the post-translational modifications that are important for coupling RNA synthesis to co-transcriptional maturation.

40|$|Understanding how <b>silent</b> <b>genes</b> can be {{competent}} for activation provides {{insight into}} development {{as well as}} cellular reprogramming and pathogenesis. We performed genomic location analysis of the pioneer transcription factor FoxA in the adult mouse liver and found that {{about one-third of the}} FoxA bound sites are near <b>silent</b> <b>genes,</b> including genes without detectable RNA polymerase II. Virtually all of the FoxA-bound silent sites are within conserved sequences, suggesting possible function. Such sites are enriched in motifs for transcriptional repressors, including for Rfx 1 and type II nuclear hormone receptors. We found one such target site at a cryptic "shadow" enhancer 7 kilobases (kb) downstream of the Cdx 2 gene, where Rfx 1 restricts transcriptional activation by FoxA. The Cdx 2 shadow enhancer exhibits a subset of regulatory properties of the upstream Cdx 2 promoter region. While Cdx 2 is ectopically induced in the early metaplastic condition of Barrett's esophagus, its expression is not necessarily present in progressive Barrett's with dysplasia or adenocarcinoma. By contrast, we find that Rfx 1 expression in the esophageal epithelium becomes gradually extinguished during progression to cancer, i. e, expression of Rfx 1 decreased markedly in dysplasia and adenocarcinoma. We propose that this decreased expression of Rfx 1 could be an indicator of progression from Barrett's esophagus to adenocarcinoma and that similar analyses of other transcription factors bound to <b>silent</b> <b>genes</b> can reveal unanticipated regulatory insights into oncogenic progression and cellular reprogramming...|$|R

40|$|CBP and {{the related}} p 300 protein are widely used {{transcriptional}} co-activators in metazoans that interact with multiple transcription factors. Whether CBP/p 300 occupies the genome equally with all factors or preferentially binds together with some factors is not known. We therefore compared Drosophila melanogaster CBP (nejire) ChIP-seq peaks with regions bound by 40 different transcription factors in early embryos, and we found high co-occupancy with the Rel-family protein Dorsal. Dorsal is required for CBP occupancy in the embryo, but only at regions where few other factors are present. CBP peaks in mutant embryos lacking nuclear Dorsal are best correlated with TGF-ß/Dpp-signaling and Smad-protein binding. Differences in CBP occupancy in mutant embryos reflect gene expression changes genome-wide, but CBP also occupies some non-expressed genes. The presence of CBP at <b>silent</b> <b>genes</b> does not result in histone acetylation. We find that Polycomb-repressed H 3 K 27 me 3 chromatin does not preclude CBP binding, but restricts histone acetylation at CBP-bound genomic sites.

However, phage as a carrier has disadvantages, including unstable packaging efficiency, a complex operational method and a limited screening ability. In this experiment, we made some improvements.

This eye, its nerve supply, and skeletal support, comprise a perfect unit {{which appears to be}} a spontaneous atavism. However, according to recent calculations this cannot be so. These suggest that while re-activation of long-silent genes, on which atavisms depend, can occur after a lapse of up to 6 million years (My), this is impossible after 10 My unless the gene is maintained by active selection, which cannot apply here. However, the Anostraca is an old group, and the atavism (if such it be) is clearly very ancient. Efficient DNA repair, not considered in the calculations, offers a possible explanation of how <b>silent</b> <b>genes</b> may survive for longer than the suggested period of viability. Particularly intriguing is that a binocular condition is primitive and the cyclopean derived, which has remarkable evolutionary implications.

40|$|Gene {{regulation}} {{is a complex}} process that involves recruitment of transcription machinery, chromatin modification, and co-transcriptional RNA processing. RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcribes protein-coding genes. It contains a carboxy- terminal domain (CTD) consisting of multiple repeats. Specific patterns of CTD modifications promote the recruitment of appropriate factors {{at different stages of}} the transcription cycle, integrating transcription with chromatin modification and co-transcriptional RNA processing. In pluripotent ES cells, Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs) silence important developmental regulator genes. I have investigated RNAPII regulation at PRC-target genes genome-wide in murine ES cells by mining ChIP-Seq and mRNA-Seq datasets, using computational approaches. PRC targets exhibit different expression and RNAPII states: <b>Silent</b> <b>genes</b> lacking RNAPII, <b>silent</b> <b>genes</b> associated with RNAPII which is phosphorylated on the serine 5 residue of the CTD (S 5 P) but lacking serine 2 phosphorylated residues (S 2 P), and expressed genes with both S 5 P and S 2 P. At <b>silent</b> PRC-target <b>genes,</b> S 5 P and PRCs co-occupy the same promoters and the complexes extend into coding regions in the absence of S 2 P, suggesting disruption of co-transcriptional RNA processing. Sequential ChIP demonstrates simultaneous association of PRC and RNAPII to the same chromatin. Most expressed PRC-target genes display CTD marks of activity, including presence of S 2 P throughout the gene body; however S 2 P and PRCs do not co-immunoprecipitate, suggesting that active and PRC-repression are two separate chromatin states, that occur in different cells of the ES population, or within different alleles in the same cell.

SeqGI provides a GUI framework for the simultaneous visualisation and statistical evaluation of read profiles over genomic features.

In this work, we generated the genome-wide maps of H 3 K 4 me 3 and H 3 K 27 me 3 of mouse cerebrum and testis using ChIP-seq and their high-coverage transcriptomes using ribominus RNA-seq with SOLiD technology. We examined the global patterns of H 3 K 4 me 3 and H 3 K 27 me 3 in both tissues and found that modifications are closely-associated with tissue-specific expression, function and development. Moreover, we revealed that H 3 K 4 me 3 and H 3 K 27 me 3 rarely occur in <b>silent</b> <b>genes,</b> which contradicts the findings in previous studies. Finally, we observed that bivalent domains, with both H 3 K 4 me 3 and H 3 K 27 me 3, existed ubiquitously in both tissues and demonstrated an invariable preference for the regulation of developmentally-related genes. However, the bivalent domains tend towards a “winner-takes-all” approach to regulate the expression of associated genes. We also verified the above results in mouse ES cells. As expected, the results in ES cells are consistent with those in cerebrum and testis. In conclusion, we present two very important findings. One is that H 3 K 4 me 3 and H 3 K 27 me 3 rarely occur in <b>silent</b> <b>genes.</b> The other is that bivalent domains may adopt a “winner-takes-all” principle to regulate gene expression...|$|R
