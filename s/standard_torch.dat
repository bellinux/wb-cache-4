2500|$|A new logo was {{developed}} by Indiana Standard and introduced in 1946. It combined the <b>Standard</b> <b>torch</b> with the Amoco oval. The oval colors were, from top to bottom, red, white, and blue. The new logo was called the [...] "Torch and Oval (T)". In {{parts of the country}} where the company could not use the name [...] "Standard", the logo read [...] "Utoco" [...] or [...] "Pan-Am". When the [...] "Pan-Am" [...] name was replaced by [...] "Amoco", it marked the first time the torch and oval was used with the Amoco name. [...] The red and black logo continued {{to be used in the}} northeast and maps distributed by Amoco in the late 1950s through 1960 showed both logos.|$|E

Screening {{for the common}} congenital infections associated with polymicrogyria with <b>standard</b> <b>TORCH</b> testing may be appropriate. Other specific tests targeting individual neurometabolic disorders can be obtained if clinically suggested.|$|E

5000|$|It was Simon's {{first album}} devoted to <b>standards,</b> namely <b>torch</b> songs, {{relating}} unrequited love or rejection. The album also features one Simon original, [...] "From the Heart". The album was recorded during her marriage break up to James Taylor, which was announced {{shortly after the}} release of the album.|$|R
2500|$|In 1990, she {{contributed a}} cover of [...] "You Do Something to Me" [...] to the Cole Porter tribute/AIDS {{fundraising}} album Red Hot + Blue produced by the Red Hot Organization. Red Hot + Blue {{was followed by the}} release of Am I Not Your Girl?, an album of <b>standards</b> and <b>torch</b> songs that she had listened to while growing up. The album received mixed-to-poor reviews, and was a commercial disappointment in light of the success of her previous work.|$|R
30|$|Metal {{analyses}} were performed by the method of Uysal et al. (2008) with some modifications. For each sample, 0.4  g of homogenized oyster tissue (wet weight) was accurately weighed and transferred into a 25  mL quartz vessel together with 5  mL of concentrated (65 %) nitric acid (HNO 3) and 1  mL of (35 %) hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2). The extraction vessel {{was placed in a}} microwave digestion system (Milestone ETHOS PLUS, Italy), and the digestion program was run in 2 steps (step (1) 25 – 180 °C for 30  min at 1000  W; step (2) 180 °C for 15  min at 1000  W). All the digested samples were diluted to 25  mL with milliQ water in pre-acid washed standard flasks and used for analysis. Cadmium and lead were analyzed using an Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectrometer (ICP AES, ICPE- 9000, Shimadzu, Japan) at 220  nm for cadmium and 210  nm for lead. A <b>standard</b> <b>torch</b> for this instrument was used with an outer argon gas flow rate of 15  L min- 1 and an intermediate gas flow of 0.9  L min- 1. The applied power was 1.0  kW. For mercury, 0.1  g of oyster soft tissue was accurately weighed in a sample boat, and total mercury was determined using a Direct Mercury Analyzer (DMA- 80, Milestone, Italy) without further sample preparation. Typical repeatability was 3.2 - 4.4 % for cadmium, 2.4 – 4.7 % for lead and 2.5 – 3.8 % for mercury. Good reproducibility of the method was obtained, yielding the intra-day and inter-day relative standard deviations less than 5 %. The instrument detection limits were 0.01  mg kg- 1 for cadmium 0.02  mg kg- 1 for lead and 0.5  ng g- 1 for mercury.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} the {{preparation}} of carbon fiber reinforced ultra-high temperature ceramic matrix composites was reported. Polymer infiltration and pyrolysis process was used to prepare 2 D C/TaC-SiC, C/NbC-SiC, and C/ZrC-SiC composites. The fracture strengths of all the samples were around 300 MPa and toughness around 10 MPa-m 1 / 2. <b>Standard</b> oxyacetylene <b>torch</b> tests (> 3000 °C, 30 s) showed that the minimum ablative rate of 2 D C/SiC-ZrC was as low as 0. 026 mm/s, much smaller than that of 2 D C/SiC composites (0. 088 mm/s) ...|$|R
5000|$|A ferro (plural ferri) or [...] is {{an item of}} {{functional}} wrought-iron work on the façade of an Italian building. Ferri are a common feature of Medieval and Renaissance architecture in Lazio, Tuscany and Umbria. They are of three main types: [...] have a ring for tethering horses, and are set at about [...] from the ground; holders for <b>standards</b> and <b>torches</b> are placed higher on the façade and on {{the corners of the}} building; [...] have a cup-shaped hook or hooks to support cloth for shade or to be dried, and are set near balconies.|$|R

AuCNL. The torch has a chalice shaped top with three sets of Olympic rings stamped onto the lip. On its base the inscription " Olympia - Melbourne, XVI Olympiad 1956 ". An additional round plate welded 14 mm. below this onto a handle (31 cm.). Made of diecast aluminium alloy, probably zinc and copper, weighing 1. 8 kg. A cylindrical fuel canister of naphthalene and hexamine clipped into {{the base of the}} bowl. 400 standard and 2 ceremonial torches were ordered by EMI Australia and produced by the parent company in England with 110 <b>standard</b> <b>torches</b> purchased for the Australian section. Each torch was reused up to 25 times, requiring two trucks as mobile workshops to service them. An hour was required to cool the torch before reuse. Melbourne 1956 Olympic Torch Relay...|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "PDRM82" [...] or Portable Dose Rate Meter and {{the desktop}} fixed PDRM 82(F) {{version of the}} same meter, that were {{manufactured}} by Plessey and introduced during the 1980s, gave more accurate readings and used <b>standard</b> 'C' cell <b>torch</b> batteries that lasted many times longer, up to 400 hours of operation.

50|$|It is {{possible}} to buy flammable juggling balls. Gloves are often needed but not always; fyrefli juggling balls for example are designed so the flame sits a few centimeters above the hand. Ball juggling is easier than club juggling, and with juggling fire balls, any stage performances look impressive. However, juggling necessarily requires the hands to alternately grip the flaming balls for 1 or more 'juggling beats'(usually around 0.5 second), known as 'dwell time'. This restricts the size of flame and {{the duration of the}} burn to avoid overheating the hands, even with gloves. For these reasons all commercially available fire juggling balls use a smaller wick and flame than <b>standard</b> juggling <b>torches.</b> Some enthusiasts have attempted to overcome this problem using fuel-soaked balls of kevlar rope and welding gloves or similar, but have been unable to achieve more than 30 seconds of useful juggling before the gloves catch fire.|$|R

The PDRM82 (F) had a remote sensor, mounted above ground under a polycarbonate dome and connected down a steel probe-pipe to the instrument by a coaxial cable.|$|R
5000|$|Since {{the disco}} era, Summer's work had covered {{a variety of}} musical genres and this album was no exception. It had quite a strong soul influence, and {{featured}} a couple of gospel-styled tracks, namely [...] "(If It) Hurts Just a Little" [...] and a version of Jon and Vangelis' [...] "State of Independence", which featured an all-star choir. Rock music was {{also found in the}} form of the Bruce Springsteen-penned [...] "Protection"; the track had been planned as a Donna Summer/Bruce Springsteen duet but that concept was abandoned as unworkable. The album concluded with Summer's take on the Billy Strayhorn <b>torch</b> <b>standard</b> [...] "Lush Life". The song [...] "Mystery of Love" [...] used the opening material from Bach's [...] "The Well-Tempered Clavier", Book 1: Prelude and Fugue No. 2 in C minor for the keyboard part in the introduction and verse.|$|R
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a gas shielded {{electric arc welding}} torch having a detachable gas cup extension which may be of any desired configuration or length. The gas cup extension assembly is mounted on a <b>standard</b> electric welding <b>torch</b> gas cup to enable welding in areas with limited access. The gas cup assembly has an upper tubular insert that fits within the gas cup such that its lower portion protrudes thereform and has a lower tubular extension that is screwed into the lower portion. The extension has a rim to define the outer perimeter of the seat edge about its entrance opening so a gasket may be placed to effect an airtight seal between the gas cup and extension. The tubular extension may be made of metal or cermaic material that can be machined. The novelty lies {{in the use of}} an extension assembly for a standard gas cup of an electric arc welding torch which extension assembly is detachable permitting the use of a number of extensions which may be of different configurations and materials and yet fit the standard gas cup...|$|R
