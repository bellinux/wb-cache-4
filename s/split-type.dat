The fuselage cross-section was reduced via the adoption of not only a main fuselage bomb bay but smaller bomb bays that were located within the wing roots. The low cantilever wing, which employed a structure designed and patented by Mercier, was constructed in four separate sections. Specifically, the inner section was built around two spars equipped with steel booms which had enough room between them to accommodate a 200 kg-class bomb and large self-sealing fuel tanks; the spars did not continue to the wing-tip but made way for a box-type structure.

40|$|AbstractA {{class of}} r-regular multiwavelets, {{depending}} on the smoothness of the multiwavelet functions, is introduced with the appropriate notation and definitions. Oscillation properties of orthonormal systems are obtained in Lemma 1 and Corollary 1 without assuming any vanishing moments for the scaling functions, and in Theorem 1 the existence of r-regular multiwavelets in L 2 (Rn) is established. In Theorem 2, a particular r-regular multiresolution analysis for multiwavelets is obtained from an r-regular multiresolution analysis for uniwavelets. In Theorem 3, an r-regular multiresolution analysis of <b>split-type</b> multiwavelets, which are perhaps the simplest multiwavelets, is easily obtained by using an r-regular multiresolution analysis for uniwavelets and a (2 n − 1) -fold regular multiresolution analysis for uniwavelets.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{describes}} a numerical approach for determining both the motive nozzle and constant-area diameters of an ejector as an expansion device, {{based on the}} cooling capacity of a <b>split-type</b> air-conditioner using R 290 as refrigerant. Previous {{studies have shown that}} replacement of HCFC R 22 with HC 290 (propane) in the air conditioner can improve the coefficient of performance (COP). The purpose of replacing the capillary tube with an ejector as an expansion device in a <b>split-type</b> air conditioner using HC 290 is to further improve the COP. In developing the model, conservation laws of mass, momentum and energy equations were applied to each part of the ejector. The numerical results show that the motive nozzle diameter remains constant (1. 03 mm) under varying condenser temperatures, whereas the diameter of the constant-area decreases as the condenser temperature increases. It was also found that improvement of the COP can reach 32. 90 % at a condenser temperature of 55 °C.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} an {{efficient}} <b>split-type</b> Finite-Difference (FD) scheme with high modal resolution – {{most important for}} the streamwise convection terms that cause wave transport and interaction – is derived for a mixed Fourier-spectral/FD method that is designed for the spatial direct numerical simulation (DNS) of boundary-layer transition and turbulence. Using a relatively simple but thorough and instructive modal analysis we discuss some principal trouble sources of the related FD discretization. The new scheme {{is based on a}} 6 th-order compact FD discretization in streamwise and wall-normal direction and the classical 4 th-order Runge–Kutta time-integration scheme with symmetrical final corrector step. Exemplary results of a fundamental-(K-) type breakdown simulation of a strongly decelerated Falkner–Skan boundary layer (Hartree parameter βH =− 0. 18) using 70 mega grid points in space are presented up to the early turbulent regime (Re θ,turb ≈ 820). The adverse pressure gradient gives rise to local separation zones during the breakdown stage and intensifies final breakdown by strong amplification of (background) disturbances thus enabling rapid transition at moderate Reynolds number. The appearance and dynamics of small-scale vortical structures in early turbulence basically similar to the large-scale structures at transition can be observed corroborating Kachanov’s hypothesis on the importance of the K-regime of breakdown for coherent structures in turbulence.

Experiments were carried out in a room-type calorimeter. The results have shown that (1) similar cooling effects {{can be achieved by}} matching various capillary tubes of different inner diameters; (2) parallel capillary tubes presented better system performance and flow stability with weaker inlet pressure fluctuations than the single capillary tube; (3) with the coil diameter of the capillary tube increasing from 40 Â mm to 120 Â mm, the mass flow rate tended to increase slightly. But the cooling capacity, input power and energy efficiency ratio (EER) did not show evident tendency of change; (4) the refrigerant charge and mass flow rate for HC 290 were only 44 % and 47 % of that for HCFC 22, respectively, due to the much lower density. And HC 290 had 4. 7 - 6. 7 % lower cooling capacity and 12. 1 - 12. 3 % lower input power with respect to HCFC 22. However, the EER of HC 290 can be 8. 5 % higher than that of HCFC 22, which exhibits the advantage of using HC 290.
