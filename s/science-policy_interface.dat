The DROUGHT-R&SPI project (2011 - 2015) {{advances}} on drought research and associated <b>science-policy</b> <b>interfacing.</b> This FP 7 project works at various scales, ranging from local to the pan-EU level. In addition to the European level, the project works in six Case Studies, in Greece (local), Spain & Italy (river basin), Portugal, Switzerland, and The Netherlands (national). In the paper, the various drought <b>science-policy</b> <b>interfacing</b> approaches are described. An overall finding is that <b>Science-Policy</b> <b>interfacing</b> at detailed scales (i. e. specific to sector, context and territory) is easier than at pan-European scale. Another important conclusion is that successful <b>science-policy</b> <b>interfaces</b> develop over time, based on their specific (socio-economic, historic and institutional) circumstances and specific drought characteristics.

How can universities and their stakeholder communities create effective boundary spanners for prompt inquiry and response to emergencies when there is insufficient data and local resources are disabled? With increasing cross-border interdependencies in higher learning, <b>science-policy</b> <b>interfaces</b> acquire a meaning greater than simply interdisciplinary collaboration or knowledge transfer.

40|$|Credibility, {{relevance}} and legitimacy (CRELE) of knowledge are {{widely recognized as}} key attributes of effective <b>science–policy</b> <b>interfaces</b> (SPIs). Yet, notwithstanding efforts to enhance the CRELE attributes of an SPI, it may still lack impact or be dismissed as not being credible, legitimate or relevant both inside, and outside the SPI. We introduce ‘iterativity’ as an additional attribute to the CRELE framework to better capture dynamic, continuous and multi-directional interactions between science, policy and society related to SPIs. Iterativity is understood {{in the context of}} an important shift in perspective by which SPIs are viewed as dynamic, evolving processes rather than linear processes or isolated events. Based on empirical material on biodiversity-related SPIs, we identify 14 features and lessons learned that explain the outcomes of SPIs regarding their participants and external audiences, and examine how SPIs’ structures, objectives, processes and outputs help to build CRELE and iterativity (CRELE + IT). The four attributes of CRELE + IT and results related to the features explaining outcomes of SPIs also provide useful practical tools for the design, implementation and revision of effective <b>science–policy</b> <b>interfaces.</b> These lessons regarding CRELE + IT help us understand both when and why SPIs are able to contribute to the pressing social and ecological need to halt biodiversity loss and the further deterioration of ecosystem services...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed at}} examining {{the integration of}} scientific and technological progress into practical uses in water resources management and highlighting an existing interface, the WISE-RTD Web Portal that was built to aid the science-policy communication of the European water legislation. It also presents the different possible solutions to address the science-policy and industry communication gaps. Based on the several lessons arising from existing literature, {{it is noted that}} challenges to the take up of science in policy stem from the fact that science and policy communities have very different “cultures”. Not only do most members understand each other poorly, in general most scientists have little time to engage with policy makers as their career path usually depends instead on research and scientific publications. Similarly, policy officials have little time to engage with scientists or the scientific information is not easily accessible or adapted to the policy implementation jargon. The two communities also often find themselves working to very different timescales, hence face difficulties of matching in-depth research and reporting with the day-to-day needs of policy making/decisions. Difficulties experienced to date stem from {{the fact that there is}} no sufficient streamlining of information from the scientific community to policy decision-makers and vice versa. Solutions consist of <b>science-policy</b> <b>interfacing</b> and communication channels. One such channel currently under development is the WISE-RTD Water Knowledge Portal. It is based on an intelligent matching system that maps research results and water technologies to water policies. Other solutions discussed in the paper are the need for scientists & research projects to establish a “Policy Watch” to anticipate policy evidence requirements and greater interaction, discussion and deliberation between researchers and policy makers is called for. It should also be noted that <b>science-policy</b> <b>interfacing</b> is about people; a focus solely on flows of information will not be able to build effective transfer mechanisms without these interactions. status: publishe...|$|R

In this public deliverable, we aim to supplement the outcomes of the consultations to determine the current and future needs of policy makers and advisors from relevant international, European and national public bodies. We also discuss what actions JPI Oceans could do to add value to existing science-policy mechanisms. This is considered {{in the context of}} joint programming, and looks at how other similar organisations have been effective at adding value. Firstly, we explore five examples of science-policy mechanisms as case studies. The case studies were selected to demonstrate examples of best practice, including examples highlighted by stakeholders and other known mechanisms, to explore how they work and what makes them effective. The second section of this report investigates how new technology and methodologies could be useful in improving <b>science-policy</b> <b>interfaces.</b> This section contains a number of specific examples of existing projects that could be considered relevant or cutting edge, while they are not discussed in detail, links have been provided for further reading.

40|$|Based on a {{literature}} review of over 160 journal articles and books, {{this article examines}} the ecosystem management and environmental governance approaches, and looks for common topics and integrated research agendas. While scientific articles on environmental governance stem primarily from social science research, the ecosystem management approach is more natural science-oriented. A review of journal articles from the ISI Web of Knowledge (Web of Science) reveals that the two research communities hardly interact. The paper discusses two thematic linkages between the two approaches: the debates dealing with the scale and level of environmental policy; and the discussions surrounding multi-stakeholder participation. Moreover, the article identifies areas with a high potential for the establishment of common ground, such as the current discussion on <b>science-policy</b> <b>interfaces.</b> We argue for more interaction, claim that the two research approaches can learn from each other, and discuss the potential for the development of interdisciplinary research agendas...|$|R
30|$|While {{there has}} been {{progress}} in national and local policy frameworks, the establishment of agencies for disaster management, understanding mechanisms of hazards, and forms of local engagement, future research directions need to better address <b>science-policy</b> <b>interfaces</b> in disaster risk management. This still requires connecting science with decision making, promoting the evidence base, seeking affordable best practice, and organizing the collection and sharing of data. Dynamic systems of governance for adaptive management have to be understood, while management needs to, among new investments in DRR, build trust and effective communication. United Nations member states have local and national DRR plans to meet {{the target of the}} Sendai framework.

40|$|AbstractWe empirically {{reveal how}} {{environmental}} experts interpret the objectivity norm while navigating the authority paradox. The paradox {{here is that}} {{while there is a}} need for objective scientific advice, such advice is only to be acquired from experts and expert agencies whose objectivity and, hence, authority are contested. Viewed through the lens of practice, we identify what practitioners at the PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency understand by objectivity. Using this paradigmatic case, we show how practitioners renegotiate the meaning of objectivity while seeking to engage with new policy actors and extended peers in an independent, rigorous and legitimate manner. Successfully navigating the authority paradox is related to skilfully representing and adapting to various meanings of objectivity. Experts and experts agencies accordingly need reflexive skills to recognise which meanings of objectivity they ascribe to and which ones are invoked in public debates.

40|$|Science-policy {{interactions}} are often contested, due to strategic production {{and use of}} knowledge. This is problematic because the potential of science to enrich decision-making is underexploited. Scientific literature suggests that these problems are related {{to a lack of}} credibility, salience and/or legitimacy of knowledge. <b>Science-policy</b> <b>interfaces</b> (SPIs), such as knowledge brokers, are suggested to enhance science-policy interactions by promoting the production of credible, salient and legitimate knowledge. However, the current scientific debate provides little clarity on which SPIs are most useful in solving which science-policy interaction problems and what strategies should be employed. Based on a profound literature review, this paper aims to arrive at a better understanding of SPIs, by providing conceptual clarity and linking typical SPIs to distinct problems and the contexts in which they emerge. We suggest an empirical research agenda to test theoretical claims about SPIs and our own refinements thereof, and to identify best practices. © 2014 Imperial College Press...|$|R
