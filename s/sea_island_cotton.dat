5|$|Newspapers {{reported}} that Myers had {{a monopoly on}} the making of hydrogen gas balloons and was the only producer in the United States of these balloons for the government. A loft in the Myers house was made available for a sewing area of balloon materials to make the large balloons. The fabric material was patterned, sewed together into large strips, and made ready for varnishing. He had a patent of a fabric made from <b>sea</b> <b>island</b> <b>cotton</b> that {{was used for the}} varnish application. Myers' patented varnish formula made the fabric impervious to hydrogen. The varnish used to seal the fabric material for the balloon envelopes was prepared in a low pit outdoors in a ravine behind the house. This was below ground level so the fabric being prepared was sheltered from the wind. It also provided a fire-pit in case the flammable material caught on fire. There was a water-hose handy for putting out a fire.|$|E
5|$|In 1795, Florida was {{transferred}} back to Spain which lured Americans with cheap land. A former loyalist to Britain who left South Carolina during the American Revolutionary War, a planter and slave trader named Zephaniah Kingsley {{seized the opportunity}} and built a plantation named Laurel Grove near what is now Doctors Lake, close {{to the west bank}} of the St. Johns River, south of where Orange Park is today. Three years later, Kingsley took a trip to Cuba and purchased a 13-year-old Wolof girl named Anna Madgigine Jai. She became his common-law wife, and managed Laurel Grove while Kingsley traveled and conducted business. The plantation grew citrus and <b>sea</b> <b>island</b> <b>cotton</b> (Gossypium barbadense). In 1814, they moved to a larger plantation on Fort George Island, where they lived for 25 years, and owned several other plantations and homesteads in what is today Jacksonville and another on Drayton Island at the north end of Lake George. Kingsley later married three other freed women in a polygamous relationship; Spanish-controlled Florida allowed interracial marriages, and white landowners such as James Erwin, George Clarke, Francisco Sánchez, John Fraser, and Francis Richard, Jr.—early settlers along the river—all were married to or in extramarital relationships with African women.|$|E
50|$|Fine Spinners and Doublers, {{formed from}} a group of {{spinning}} companies specialising in fine <b>Sea</b> <b>Island</b> <b>Cottons,</b> was registered on 31 March 1898. The Fine Cotton Spinners and Doublers Association Limited had the objective of promoting the interests of cotton spinners in North West England. It was founded through the efforts of Herbert Dixon and Scott Lings in 1897. Businesses that joined in this enterprise at the time included A&G Murray Ltd, Houldsworths, CE Bennett & Co, James & Wainwright Bellhouse and McConnell & Co; but many more followed in subsequent years.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sea</b> <b>Island</b> or long-staple <b>cotton</b> {{had been}} very {{profitable}} {{in the years immediately}} following the Revolutionary War, but the production of this variety was relegated to the narrow coastal zone and would not grow in the upland interior of the South. Green-seed cotton could be grown in the uplands but was difficult to process with the pre-1793 roller gin; consequently, Whitney’s invention opened the interior of the South to widespread cotton production.|$|R
2500|$|John Townsend {{was noted}} as an {{agriculturist}} and political leader in 19th century South Carolina. [...] He {{was one of}} the state's largest planters of <b>Sea</b> <b>Island</b> cotton; his <b>cotton</b> commanded a high price from lace-makers in Belgium and France, and won several prizes, for both its quality and its length. [...] Between 1822 and 1858, Townsend served several terms in the South Carolina General Assembly; in the early 1860s, he was a delegate to the state's Secession Convention, and a signer of the Ordinance of Secession, whereby South Carolina withdrew from the United States, part of a chain of events leading to the American Civil War.|$|R
25|$|The Confiscation Act of 1862 {{allowed the}} Treasury Department to sell many {{captured}} {{lands on the}} grounds of delinquent taxes. All told, the government now claimed 76,775 acres of Sea Island land. Auditors arrived in Port Royal and began to assess the estates now occupied by blacks and missionaries. The stakes were high: the <b>Sea</b> <b>Island</b> <b>cotton</b> harvest represented a lucrative commodity for Northern investors to control.|$|E
25|$|In {{consultation}} with Lee, Olmstead had distributed armament on the ramparts {{and in the}} casements to cover all approaches, and several were placed to cover westerly marshes and Savannah’s North Channel. Confederate marauders burned <b>sea</b> <b>island</b> <b>cotton</b> crops to deny them falling into Federal hands. Navigational aids like the Tybee Lighthouse were dismantled and burned. Reports from the field had Confederate troops setting fires to everything that might be used by advancing Federal troops.|$|E
25|$|Since 1879 {{the colony}} of Fiji had {{imported}} indentured workers (as cheap labour) from India {{to work in}} the European-owned plantations, which produced (according to demand) <b>sea</b> <b>island</b> <b>cotton</b> from the late 1860s to the early 1870s, then copra, then sugarcane from around 1880. This Indian immigration (which ended in 1916) came about because the Pacific Islands (particularly the New Hebrides and the Solomon Islands) couldn't provide enough labour. These islands provided labour from 1864 to 1911, when the European planters in the Solomon Islands and the New Hebrides brought about legislation to prevent emigration from those islands.|$|E

25|$|The {{plantation}} produced oranges, <b>sea</b> <b>island</b> <b>cotton,</b> indigo, okra, {{and other}} vegetables. Approximately 60 slaves were managed under the task system: each slave had a quota {{of work to}} do per day. When they were finished, they were allowed to do what they wished. Some slaves had personal gardens which they were allowed to cultivate, and from which they sold vegetables. Thirty-two cabins were constructed for and by the slaves, made from tabby, which made them durable, insulated, and inexpensive although labor-intensive. The cabins were located {{about a quarter of a}} mile (400 m) from the main house. Slaves were allowed to padlock their cabins and build porches that faced away from the main house. Both of these features were unusual for slave quarters in antebellum America.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{economic}} {{enterprise of}} the county was rice planting, particularly along the Satilla River. <b>Sea</b> <b>Island</b> <b>cotton</b> was grown on Cumberland Island, and short-staple cotton was grown on the mainland along with sugar cane. Various forest products including turpentine and timber were produced, mainly for consumption in the naval industry and the West Indies. Camden County {{also served as a}} hub of backcountry trade with American settlers and various Indian groups, and as a shipyard and shipping center centered around the town of St. Marys. The land in Camden County was owned by fewer than 300 people throughout the colonial and antebellum eras. Most of the white population worked in trades or as tenant farmers, while nearly all black residents were slaves. Until the 1840s (and increasingly strict black codes), Camden County had a small population of free black workers, mainly involved in day labor or maritime industry.|$|E
500|$|The {{island has}} a rich history {{that started with}} {{seasonal}} occupation by Native Americans thousands of years ago, and continued with European exploration and the <b>Sea</b> <b>Island</b> <b>Cotton</b> trade. It became an important base {{of operations for the}} Union blockade of the Southern ports during the Civil War. Once the island fell to Union troops, hundreds of ex-slaves flocked to Hilton Head, which is still home to many [...] "native islanders", many of whom are descendants of freed slaves known as the Gullah (or Geechee) who have managed to hold on to much of their ethnic and cultural identity.|$|E

40|$|A genetic model, {{including}} {{effects of}} environments, genotypes, and genotype by environment interaction, {{was employed to}} analyze five fiber traits of <b>Island</b> <b>cotton</b> (Gossypium barbadense L.). Genotypic values of 304 accessions were predicted by the adjusted unbiased prediction (AUP). Genetic similarities between different accessions were measured by Mahalanobis distances based on genotypic values. Appropriate sampling strategies, linkage rules in stepwise clustering, and sampling proportion were evaluated. To form a core collection of <b>Island</b> <b>cotton,</b> 60 accessions were sampled by the deviation sampling strategy combined with single linkage rule of hierarchical clustering. The genetic variation and structure captured by the core collection were examined in means, variances, ranges and coefficients of variation, correlation coefficients of quantitative traits, and the accessions distribution plotted by first two principal components between two collections. It was showed that the initial collection was well represented by the core collection for exploiting the <b>Island</b> <b>cotton</b> germplasm...|$|R
500|$|During the Civil War, Fort Walker was a Confederate fort {{in what is}} now Port Royal Plantation. The fort was {{a station}} for Confederate troops, and its guns helped protect the [...] {{entrance}} to Port Royal Sound, which is fed by two slow-moving and navigable rivers, the Broad River and the Beaufort River. It was vital to the <b>Sea</b> <b>Island</b> <b>Cotton</b> trade and the southern economy. On October 29, 1861, the largest fleet ever assembled in North America moved south to seize it. In the Battle of Port Royal, the fort came under attack by the U.S. Navy, and on November 7, 1861, it fell to over 12,000 Union troops. The fort was renamed Fort Welles, in honor of Gideon Welles, the Secretary of the Navy.|$|E
500|$|Marriages {{between white}} {{plantation}} owners and African women were common in East Florida. The Spanish government provided {{for a separate}} class of free people of color, and encouraged slaves to purchase their freedom. Slavery under Spain in Florida was not considered a lifelong condition, and free blacks {{were involved in the}} economic development of the region, many of them owning their own slaves. Anna oversaw 60 slaves at Fort George Island which grew [...] <b>sea</b> <b>island</b> <b>cotton,</b> citrus, corn, sugarcane, beans, and potatoes. John Maxwell, the fourth child, was born in 1824 when Kingsley and Anna lived on Fort George Island. Kingsley also maintained relationships with three other African women who acted as co-wives or concubines: Flora H., Sarah M.; and Munsilna McGundo. Anna Jai remained the matriarch in the polygamous family. Historian Daniel Schafer posits that Anna Jai would have been familiar with the concepts of polygamy and marrying a slave master to acquire one's freedom. [...] Visitors to the plantation were invited to a dinner table where Kingsley displayed his multi-racial children with pride. [...] He provided them with the best education he could afford, and considered them a shield from any potential racial uprising.|$|E
2500|$|Townsend died at Bleak Hall in 1881.

2500|$|Spain was {{offering}} land to settlers {{in order to}} populate Florida, so Kingsley petitioned the governor for land but was turned down. After waiting, he decided to purchase a [...] farm for $5,300 ($ in 2009). It was named Laurel Grove, and its main entrance was a dock on Doctors Lake, south of where Orange Park is located today. Kingsley arrived with ten slaves and began to cultivate it immediately. Another source stated he received a substantial land grant because he brought 74 slaves to Florida. The plantation grew oranges, <b>sea</b> <b>island</b> <b>cotton,</b> corn, potatoes, and peas.|$|E
2500|$|The cotton {{industry}} in the United States hit {{a crisis in the}} early 1920s. Cotton and tobacco prices collapsed in 1920 following overproduction and the boll weevil pest wiped out the <b>sea</b> <b>island</b> <b>cotton</b> crop in 1921. Annual production slumped from 1,365,000 bales in the 1910s to 801,000 in the 1920s. In South Carolina, Williamsburg County production fell from 37,000 bales in 1920 to 2,700 bales in 1922 and one farmer in McCormick County produced 65 bales in 1921 and just 6 in 1922. As a result of the devastating harvest of 1922, some 50,000 black cotton workers left South Carolina, and by the 1930s the state population had declined some 15%, largely due to cotton stagnation. Although the industry was badly affected by falling prices and pests in the early 1920s, the main reason is undoubtedly the mechanization of agriculture in explaining why many blacks moved to northern American cities in the 1940s and 1950s during the [...] "Great Migration" [...] as mechanization of agriculture was introduced, leaving many unemployed. The Hopson Planting Company produced the first crop of cotton to be entirely planted, harvested and baled by machinery in 1944.|$|E
