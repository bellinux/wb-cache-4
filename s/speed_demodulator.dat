40|$|National Natural Science Foundation of China [50702047, 51202204]A magnetoelectric {{hysteresis}} loop measurement {{system based on}} dynamic method was built under a demodulation concept with a lock-in amplifier as the high <b>speed</b> <b>demodulator.</b> A measuring speed as fast as 300 ms/point was achieved, and a complete and fluent magnetoelectric {{hysteresis loop}} could be obtained within minutes. Results show that the static magnetic phenomenon affects magnetoelectric effect significantly. This method is recommended to be the standard for magnetoelectric hysteresis loop measurement...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{position}} a Mobile Robot in an Intelligent Space, and this paper presents a sensorial system for measuring differential phase-shifts in a sinusoidally modulated infrared signal transmitted from the robot. Differential distances were obtained from these phase-shifts, and {{the position of the}} robot was estimated by hyperbolic trilateration. Due to the extremely severe trade-off between SNR, angle (coverage) and real-time response, a very accurate design and device selection was required to achieve good precision with wide coverage and acceptable robot <b>speed.</b> An I/Q <b>demodulator</b> was used to measure phases with one-stage synchronous demodulation to DC. A complete set of results from real measurements, both for distance and position estimations, is provided to demonstrate the validity of the system proposed, comparing it with other similar indoor positioning systems...|$|R
