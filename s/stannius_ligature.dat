5|$|Frogs {{have served}} as {{experimental}} animals {{throughout the history of}} science. Eighteenth-century biologist Luigi Galvani discovered the link between electricity and the nervous system by studying frogs. In 1852, H. F. Stannius used a frog's heart in a procedure called a <b>Stannius</b> <b>ligature</b> to demonstrate the ventricle and atria beat independently of each other and at different rates. The African clawed frog or platanna (Xenopus laevis) was first widely used in laboratories in pregnancy tests {{in the first half of}} the 20th century. A sample of urine from a pregnant woman injected into a female frog induces it to lay eggs, a discovery made by English zoologist Lancelot Hogben. This is because a hormone, human chorionic gonadotropin, is present in substantial quantities in the urine of women during pregnancy. In 1952, Robert Briggs and Thomas J. King cloned a frog by somatic cell nuclear transfer. This same technique was later used to create Dolly the sheep, and their experiment was the first time a successful nuclear transplantation had been accomplished in higher animals.|$|E
50|$|<b>Stannius</b> <b>Ligature</b> is an {{experimental}} procedure to illustrate impulse conduction in frog heart.A ligature placed either around the junction between the sinus venosus and atrium of the frog or turtle heart (first <b>stannius</b> <b>ligature)</b> {{or around the}} atrioventricular junction (second stannius ligature); demonstrates that the cardiac impulse is conducted from sinus venosus to atria to ventricle, but that successive chambers possess automaticity since each may continue to beat, but the atria now have a slower rate than the sinus venosus, and the ventricle either does not contract or beats at a slower rate than the atria.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the project}} was the {{development}} of computer aided multimedia experiments for practical training at the frog heart and the brain of rabbit. These experiments are going to use for the education in physiology of medical students. The real experiment is shown in digital videos and the measured biological signals simultaneously. The interactive handling is separated into an introduction, a preparation part, the experiment itself, analysing of the data and answering of questions. Physiological and anatomical informations to the experiment are available in texts, graphics and animations. Seven standard experiments of the practical training in physiology are completed: Straub heart, ECG of the frog, <b>Stannius</b> <b>ligatures,</b> Extrasystoles, Temperature dependence of the heart activity, Heart nerve effects, EEG/EP of the rabbit. The use of the programs is possible and planed in practical training of physiology for medical students, students of dental medicine, biology, veterinary medicine and pharmacy. Therefore there is a possibility to decrease the number of animal experiments for education. (orig.)
