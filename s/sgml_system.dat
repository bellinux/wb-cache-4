25|$|SGML {{specified}} a syntax {{for including}} the markup in documents, {{as well as}} one for separately describing what tags were allowed, and where (the Document Type Definition (DTD) or schema). This allowed authors to create and use any markup they wished, selecting tags that made the most sense to them and were named in their own natural languages. Thus, SGML is properly a meta-language, and many particular markup languages are derived from it. From the late '80s on, most substantial new markup languages have been based on <b>SGML</b> <b>system,</b> including for example TEI and DocBook. SGML was promulgated as an International Standard by International Organization for Standardization, ISO 8879, in 1986.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} has been initiated {{on the basis of}} practical experiences in developing a relatively large <b>SGML</b> <b>system</b> at the University of Oslo. This thesis contributes to the field of information systems, with a particular focus on document systems. The aim of this work is to inform the design of document systems by considering the transformation from paper to digital documents in organizations. The Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML, ISO 8879) approach is emphasized. The SGML approach takes the documents' structure and content as the starting point in design, and regards the document as a collection of structured information. This approach is challenged and tentatively improved by empirical studies of documents in use and theoretical considerations of artifacts at work. The research approach has been an Action Case, as defined by Vidgen and Braa (1997). The interpretation of the transformation process from paper to digital documents is based mainly on an in-depth case study that was conducted at a Norwegian news agency from January 1996 to March 1998. The empirical findings are discussed according to theoretical concepts that emphasize the significance of artifacts at work to illuminate the various roles of documents at work. Concepts from the Actor Network Theory (ANT) (for example, see Callon, 1986; Latour, 1987; Law, 1986) are applied to emphasize the interrelations of humans and artifacts, as well as the importance of artifacts' properties in these relations. The concepts of 'boundary object' (Star and Griesemer; 1989) and 'borderline issues' (Brown and Duguid, 1994) are applied to get various perspectives on the actor-network. The study illustrates that it is challenging to substitute paper documents with SGML documents. Firstly, two different types of technology, with different properties and features, are exchanged. By removing paper documents, we also remove resources that go beyond the canonical meaning of the artifact. These resources are related to paper as a technology. Secondly, the document perspective in SGML is too restricted in relation to the various perspectives on documents in practical use. The emphasis on structure complicates the production of documents. Thirdly, the application of shared document models across work practices turns the various heterogeneous actor-networks into one network, which requires a common objective among the actors involved. The dilemma of "who does the job and who gets the benefits" (Grudin, 1989; 1994) arises as well. The study indicates that an investigation of the actor-networks that include documents provides an insight into the more hidden aspects of work. By regarding documents' central, peripheral, local and shared properties, one can gain an understanding of how documents are embedded in work, including the importance of documents and related artifacts to aspects such as awareness, articulation and coordination of work. The properties determine how things become interrelated into heterogeneous networks. The research shows how a document's properties or inscriptions are essential to its production and application in use. Insight into these prerequisites helps us to understand how the computer system can fit into work practices, even if we do have no guarantees that it will be used in the way that we expect. According to design, work practices are improved by changing the technical properties or the technical fundamentals, by adding various inscriptions into the system. This thesis describes how an existing system was improved by the use of 'gateways'. In the design of the gateways, the idea has been to keep the technical possibilities that SGML provides, {{and at the same time}} take into account our knowledge about the paperwork...|$|E

40|$|With {{the growth}} of {{computer}} use, {{the invention of the}} World Wide Web, and the increased pace of scientific research, publishers realized that making research available electronically was vital to both researchers as well as their own business interests. Over the past decade, scholarly publishers have designed DTDs and implemented <b>SGML</b> <b>systems.</b> Despite efforts to create a common DTD for scholarly publishing, publishers have developed proprietary DTDs and SGML implementations that diverge from efforts toward standardization on a single DTD because publishers required solutions that best suited their business requirements. The recognition that individual organizations within an industry segment may have unique business requirements is important for all parties involved in the design and implementation of <b>SGML</b> <b>systems,</b> especially those who work on content or data interchange projects.

40|$|A patient {{record is}} {{typically}} a document which is updated by many users, {{required to be}} represented in many different layouts, transfered from a place to another, and archived for a long time.

An <b>SGML</b> based <b>system</b> requires that the structure of the document is defined in advance as a Data Type Definition (DTD). If the structure is defined based on the paper form, the structure does not necessary reflect what the doctors and nurses do in their everyday practise. The structure should reflect the use and reuse of the content elements. The object-oriented design methods produce this kind of information.

40|$|Purpose: Create {{a special}} {{adaptation}} of ICD- 10 {{to meet the}} needs of the outpatient sector of the German health care system. Methods: Requirements were identified together with the board of physicians. To ensure consistency with the original classification (even after annual updates) and to allow the automatic production from its master files, the <b>SGML</b> based <b>system</b> was enhanced. The final product was tested in a feasibility study. Results: Very rare conditions were moved to an appendix. A minimum coding level for general practitioners was defined. It is at the four character level only, if their typical equipment allows differential diagnosis or if detail is needed for reimbursement. However, the full four character classification was accepted for medical specialities. Two additional axes for laterality and certainty of diagnosis were introduced. Chapter XX was reduced to 22 codes only. A study with more than 2000 physicians proved feasibility of this approach. Conclusions: The introduction of ICD- 10 -SGBV is planned for 2000 for the outpatient sector. The hospitals will have to use the full classification plus the additional axes for laterality and certainty. Background In the end of 1995 the Federal Ministry for Health tried to introduce ICD- 10 coding for German hospitals and for the outpatient sector of the health care system.

40|$|A {{method for}} augmenting an <b>SGML</b> {{document}} repository <b>system</b> with database functionality is presented. SGML (ISO 8879, 1986) {{has been widely}} accepted as a standard language for writing text with added structural information that gives the text greater applicability. Recently {{there has been a}} trend to use this structural information as metadata in databases. The complex structure of docuuments, however, makes it difficult to directly map the structural information in documents to database structures. In particular, the flat nature of relational databases makes it extremely difficult to model documents that are inherently hierarchical in nature. Consequently, documents are modeled in object-oriented databases (Abite-boul, Cluet, & Milo, 1993), and object-relational databases (Holst, 1995), in which SGML documents are mapped into the corresponding database models and are later reconstructed as necessary. However, this mapping strategy is not natural and can potentially cause loss of information in the original SGML documents. Moreover, interfaces for building queries for current document databases are mostly built on form-based query techniques and do not use the â â look and feelâ â of the documents. This article introduces an implementation method for a complex-object modeling technique specifically for SGML documents and describes interface techniques tailored for text databases. Some of the concepts for a Structured Document Database Management System (SDDBMS) specifically designed for SGML documents are described. A small survey of some current products is also presented to demonstrate the need for such a system...|$|R
40|$|The Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) {{has been}} the International Organization of Standardization (ISO) {{published}} standard for text interchange for nearly a decade. Since 1986, SGML based publishing has been successfully implemented in many fields, notably those industries with massive and mission-critical publishing operations such as the military, legal, medical, and heavy industries. SGML based publishing differs from the WYSIWYG paradigm of desktop publishing in that an SGML document contains descriptive, structural markup rather than specific formatting markup. Specific markup describes {{the appearance of a}} document and is usually a proprietary code which makes the document difficult to re-use or interchange to different systems. The structurally generic markup codes in an SGML document allow the fullest exploitation of the information. An SGML document exhibits more re-usability than a document created and stored in a proprietary formatting code. In many cases, workflow and production are greatly improved by the implementation of SGML based publishing. Historical and anecdotal case studies of many applications clearly delineate the benefits of an <b>SGML</b> based publishing <b>system.</b> And certainly, the boom in Web publishing has spurred interest in enabling a publishing system with multi-output functionality. However, implementation is associated with high costs. The acquisition of new tools and new skills is a costly investment. A careful cost-benefit analysis must determine that the current publishing needs would be satisfied by moving to SGML. Increased productivity is the measure by which SGML is adopted. The purpose of this thesis project is to investigate the relative benefits and requirements of a simple SGML based publishing implementation. The graduate thesis for most of the School of Printing Management and Sciences at the Rochester Institute of Technology was used as an example. The author has expanded the requirements for the publication process of a graduate thesis with factors which do not exist in reality. The required output has been expanded from mere print output to include publishing on the World Wide Web (WWW) in the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), and to some proprietary electronic browser such as Folio Views for inclusion in a searchable collection of graduate theses on CD-ROM. A proposed set of tools and methods are discussed in order to clarify the requirements of such an SGML implementation...|$|R
