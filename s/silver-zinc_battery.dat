50|$|In 1962, she {{received}} a newly developed DIMUS sonar system and, on 7 December 1962, work began on her fourth major conversion which included the installation of concentric contra-rotating propellers, a high-capacity <b>silver-zinc</b> <b>battery</b> and a larger main motor. New radio equipment, BQS and BQR sonars, an emergency recovery system, and a new main ballast tank blow system were also added. After the work was completed in March 1965, Albacore prepared for deployment to Florida waters to study the results of her changes. She returned to Portsmouth on 8 October 1965 and continued to evaluate her capabilities under the new configuration. On 1 August 1966, she reentered the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard to replace the <b>silver-zinc</b> <b>battery</b> and to shorten {{the distance between the}} contra-rotating propellers—work which lasted into August 1967.|$|E
50|$|A related {{rechargeable}} {{secondary battery}} usually called a <b>silver-zinc</b> <b>battery</b> uses {{a variation of}} silver-oxide chemistry.

50|$|The {{communications}} system included the high-gain antenna and an omnidirectional medium-gain antenna and two transmitters at approximately 960 MHz, one with 0.25 W power output {{and the other}} with 3 W power output. Power was to be furnished by 8680 solar cells on the two panels, a 53.5 kg <b>silver-zinc</b> <b>battery,</b> and smaller batteries on some of the experiments.

The temperature was controlled passively by gold plating, white paint, and polished aluminum surfaces.|$|E
50|$|Electrical {{power is}} {{provided}} by solar cells attached to the two truncated cones. To keep the solar panels at a temperature below 165 C in proximity of the sun, the solar cells are interspersed with mirrors, covering 50% of the surface and reflecting part of the incident sunlight while dissipating the excess heat. The energy supplied by the solar panels is a minimum of 240 watts when the probe is in the farthest part of its orbit from the sun. The power whose voltage is regulated to 28 volts DC is stored on a <b>silver-zinc</b> <b>battery</b> of 8 Ah.|$|E
50|$|When the Chinese nuclear {{submarine}} program {{begun in the}} early 1960s, the design of torpedoes which would be used on the {{nuclear submarine}}s was also started in conjunction. A research team was first formed {{in the winter of}} 1964 by the 705th Research Institute, and it was decided that priority should be given to acoustic homing ASW torpedo. China was able to indigenously provide two types of propulsion systems, electrical and steam, but electrical propulsion could not provide the speed required, so the steam propulsion was selected. However, the steam propulsion had its own problem: there were two types of steam propulsion engines, reciprocating engine and steam turbine engine. China only had experience with the reciprocating engine, but the mechanical motion generated loud noise which greatly reduced the effectiveness of the acoustic seeker of the torpedo. Since the steam turbine technology was monopolized by the west, Chinese researchers suggested the plan of torpedo approaching the target at high speed, and then reduce the speed to home in on the target at low speed. In 1964, the design was submitted to the National Defense Science and Technology Committee and named as Yu-3 torpedo, and after continued evaluation that lasted from April 1965 to October 1965, and approval was given, the permission to begin the production program was issued in March 1966. Two month later, in May 1966, the design was change on last time, when China successfully developed <b>silver-zinc</b> <b>battery,</b> which enabled the torpedo to seek out targets at high speed, since electrically powered torpedo produced much less noise. The final propulsion of the Yu-3 torpedo selected was thus <b>silver-zinc</b> <b>battery.</b> The chief designer of the Yu-3 torpedo was Mr. Dong Lin (董琳), with Mr. Yang Baosheng (杨保生) and Mr. Jiang Liangfang (江连方) as the deputy chief designers.|$|E

50|$|The {{spacecraft}} was attitude stabilized {{in three}} axes, referenced {{to the sun}} and the star Canopus. It utilized 3 gyros, 2 sets of 6 nitrogen jets, which were mounted on the ends of the solar panels, a Canopus tracker, and two primary and four secondary sun sensors. Propulsion was provided by a 223-newton rocket motor, mounted within the frame, which used the mono-propellant hydrazine. The nozzle, with 4-jet vane vector control, protruded from one wall of the octagonal structure. Power was supplied by 17,472 photovoltaic cells, covering an area of 7.7 m2 on the four solar panels. These could provide 800 watts of power near Earth, and 449 watts while at Mars. The maximum power requirement was 380 watts, once Mars was reached. A 1200 watt-hour, rechargeable, <b>silver-zinc</b> <b>battery</b> was used to provide backup power. Thermal control was achieved through the use of adjustable louvers {{on the sides of the}} main compartment.|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{adoption}} of newer technologies such as the <b>silver-zinc</b> <b>battery,</b> the performance of Yu-4 torpedo has exceeded the Russian SAET-50 torpedo it is based on, and reached that of SAET-50M: the speed of the Yu-4 torpedo is increased more than 25% to 30 kn, even 1 kn faster than the SAET-50M, and the range is increased 50% to 6 km, equal to that of SAET-50M. For these reasons, the Yu-4 torpedo is considered at least equal or better than Russian SAET-50M torpedo, the successor of SAET-50 torpedo, and even comparable to Russian SAET-60 torpedo in some aspects. However, the 6 km range was considered rather short for modern naval warfare by the Chinese navy, which led to one of the major upgrade resulted in increased range (up to 15 km), and in comparison to Yu-1 torpedo, there were not as many Yu-4 torpedoes entering service like Yu-1 torpedo. Like Yu-1 torpedo, Yu-4 torpedoes in Chinese inventory have been continuously modified, such as incorporating ASW capability, updated electronics and propulsion system, and being converted as part of CAPTOR mine type mine systems.|$|E
50|$|The first ASDS became {{operational}} (completed {{testing and}} evaluation) from its base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, in 2003 and completed its first deployment on board an attack submarine, the USS Greeneville, to the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf {{as a unit}} of Expeditionary Strike Group One. The first ASDS {{has yet to be}} joined by other units, as the program has been slowed by escalating costs and technical problems. A Congressional Budget Office (CBO) study issued in 2003 cited two major technical problems: noisy propellers and <b>silver-zinc</b> <b>batteries</b> that depleted more quickly than planned. A new propeller made of composite material has been developed to rectify the noise problem. Development is under way on lithium-ion batteries to replace the <b>silver-zinc</b> <b>batteries</b> and enable the electrical system to meet the navy's requirements. Yardney Technical Products of Pawcatuck, Conn., has been awarded a $44 million contract modification to provide four lithium-ion batteries for the ASDS program by May 2009.|$|R
50|$|Explorer 32 was a {{stainless}} steel, vacuum-sealed sphere, 0.889 m in diameter.

It was powered by <b>silver-zinc</b> <b>batteries</b> and a solar cell array.|$|R
50|$|Undercarriage {{retraction}} was pneumatic, using {{bleed air}} from the engine. The main landing gear was a Gemini strut and wheel, whilst the nose gear was a Gemini tail wheel assembly. The wingtip outriggers were purpose built. Engine start and instrumentation was electric, as was the gear down/up display. To save weight and space <b>silver-zinc</b> <b>batteries</b> were fitted. Radio and oxygen systems were not fitted.|$|R
50|$|This {{technology}} had {{the highest}} energy density prior to lithium technologies. Primarily developed for aircraft, they have long been used in space launchers and crewed spacecraft where their short cycle life is not a drawback. Non-rechargeable silver-zinc batteries powered the first Soviet Sputnik satellites as well as US Saturn launch vehicles, the Apollo Lunar Module, lunar rover and life support backpack.The primary power sources for the command module were the hydrogen/oxygen fuel cells in the service module. They provided greater energy densities than any conventional battery, but peak power limitations required supplementation by silver-zinc batteries in the CM that also became its sole power supply during re-entry after separation of the service module. Only these batteries were recharged in flight.After the Apollo 13 near-disaster, an auxiliary <b>silver-zinc</b> <b>battery</b> {{was added to the}} service module as a backup to the fuel cells. The Apollo service modules used as crew ferries to the Skylab space station were powered by three silver-zinc batteries between undocking and SM jettison as the hydrogen and oxygen tanks could not store fuel cell reactants through the long stays at the station.|$|E
50|$|However, {{due to the}} {{political}} turmoil in China at the time, the diesel engine was never completed even after the program was terminated, {{despite the fact that}} the development of such engine was already started before the construction of the prototype. The <b>silver-zinc</b> <b>battery</b> suffered even greater in that the poor quality caused a 100% rejection after delivery when inspected by Deng Rui-San and other inspection team members. As result, Type 032 could not proceed as planned, and came to a complete stop. However, the partially started Type 032 did find its greatest use in supporting its prototype Type 032-1, which was suffering from the same quality and unavailability of subsystems problems. To keep the schedule of the prototype Type 032-1, available and qualified subsystems of the stopped production Type 032 were used on the prototype, and further construction of Type 032 and its subsystems were stopped by the order of Senior colonel Yu Xiao-Hong (于笑虹), until qualified parts and resources become available. Although Type 032-1/032 program was cancelled after only a single prototype was built, it did provide PLAN significant know-how on teardrop hull and important program managerial experience, which was used on the development of future Chinese submarines to avoid the same mistakes.|$|E
50|$|The {{electrical}} {{power for the}} instruments and the radio transmitter of Mariner 4 was supplied by 28,224 solar cells contained in the four 176 x 90 cm solar panels, which could provide 310 watts at the distance of Mars. A rechargeable 1200 W·h <b>silver-zinc</b> <b>battery</b> was also used for maneuvers and backup. Monopropellant hydrazine was used for propulsion, via a four-jet vane vector control motor, with 222 N thrust, installed {{on one of the}} sides of the octagonal structure. The space probe's attitude control was provided by 12 cold nitrogen gas jets mounted on the ends of the solar panels and three gyros. Solar pressure vanes, each with an area of 0.65 square meter (seven ft²), were attached to the tips of the solar panels. Positional information was provided by four Sun sensors, and a sensor for either the Earth, Mars, or the star Canopus, depending on the time in its spaceflight. Mariner 4 was the first space probe that needed a star for a navigational reference object, since earlier missions, which remained near either the Earth, the Moon, or the planet Venus, had sighted onto either the bright face of the home planet or the brightly lit target. During this flight, both the Earth and Mars would be too dim to lock onto. Another bright source at a wide angle away from the Sun was needed and Canopus filled this requirement. Subsequently, Canopus was used as a reference point in many following missions.|$|E
