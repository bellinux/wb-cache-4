When such soils are {{to be used for}} embankments but are unsuitable for such use, they must be solidified first. When solidifying agents are added, the gain in strength appears shortly thereafter, but there are cases where banking cannot be done within the prescribed time after mixing with <b>solidifying</b> <b>agent,</b> due to sudden changes of work schedule or weather. The solidified soil must then be crushed and compacted before use. The strength characteristics of such soil are unclear. To clarify the strength characteristics of soil that has been mixed with solidifying agents, cured for a certain period, crushed and then compacted (“crushed solidified soil”), we conducted several laboratory tests in which the time elapsed between the addition of <b>solidifying</b> <b>agent</b> to soil and crushing was varied. The test results showed that the strength of crushed solidified soil could be estimated from the strength of solidified soil. Also, the tests showed that the cone index of crushed solidified soil is greatly affected by the time elapsed between the addition of solidifying agents and crushing. However, unconfined compressive strength, cohesion and California Bearing Ratio (CBR) of crushed solidified soil did not greatly change from one day of elapsed time onward...|$|E

Papermaking sludge was solidified and stabilized by the <b>solidifying</b> <b>agents</b> including cement, powder fly ash (PFA) and cinder. The mechanical properties of solidified sludge block were evaluated by compressive strength, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and heavy metals concentration in the leachate from the solidified block were tested as well. When the <b>solidifying</b> <b>agents</b> has the following composition (cement 0. 12 kg/kg, PFA 0. 02 kg/kg and cinder 0. 10 kg/kg respectively), and the curing time was 6 ds, the compressive strength of the solidified sludge blocks reached 360 kPa. The results showed that cement and cinder were all positive in the compressed strength of sludge block. If they were mixed with PFA together, they could enhanced the solidification of organic and heavy metals in the sludge. Under this conditions, the COD in leachate from the solidified block was 115. 7 mg/L, and the heavy metal concentration had reached the related national standards, after 6 ds of curing time, water ratio of the solidified block kept from 35 % to 40 %, which met the prescribed standards of landfill...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} recent reports {{concerning}} the inhibitory action of sulphated polysaccharides on d strains of poliovirus prompted a reinvestigation of the factors involved. It was found that polyglucose compounds in agar are not released in concentrations sufficient to inhibit viruses under the overlay conditionsused for suppressing d strains of poliovirus. Furthermore, sulphated polyanions in agar cannot be the critical factor, since d strains of poliovirus are also suppressed under other <b>solidifying</b> <b>agents</b> (starch gel and methylceIlu-lose) which are free of sulphated polyglucose.

The relaxation times of a very large number of samples were estimated using 1. 5 -T clinical MRI equipment. The developed phantom was found to have a T(1) value of 202 - 1904 ms and a T(2) value of 38 - 423 ms when the GdCl(3) concentration was varied from 0 - 140 mumol/kg and the agarose concentration was varied from 0 - 1. 6 % in a carrageenan concentration that was fixed at 3 %. The range of measured relaxation times covered those of all types of human tissue. Empirical formulas linking the relaxation time with the concentration of the modifier were established to enable the accurate and easy calculation of the modifier concentration needed to achieve the required relaxation times.

Plaques of 3 to 4 mm in diameter were produced in MA- 104 cells after 5 days of incubation at 37 degrees C. Plaque size was even larger (5 to 6 mm) in monolayers of African green monkey kidney cells. Addition of diethyl-aminotheyl-dextran, protamine sulfate, or 5 -bromodeoxyuridine to the trypsin-containing overlay did not improve plaque formation by the virus. Incorporation of beef extract or yeast extract to a final concentration of 0. 5 % in the trypsin-containing overlay inhibited plaque formation. On the other hand, the presence of lactalbumin hydrolysate or peptone at a similar concentration in the overlay did not inhibit plaque formation. When methylcellulose was used instead of the agar as the <b>solidifying</b> <b>agent</b> in the overlay, no plaques were seen.

30|$|According to {{the results}} {{presented}} in this work, the pozzolanic activity of dredged sea soil seems to be strongly related {{to the size of}} the particle, and it should have finer particle size similar to or smaller than that of silt. Heat treatment is definitely necessary for pozzolanic activity of dredged sea soil, but the amount of amorphous phases that can be a crucial part for pozzolanic reaction can vary depending on different sources of location. There should be an optimum method for dredged sea soil to be used as highly effective pozzolanic materials by controlling the particle size of the dredged sea soil and adjusting the temperature and time for heat treatment. It should be also noted that the amount of chloride must be monitored during purification process in order for heat treated dredged sea soil to be used as a pozzolanic material for reinforced concrete structure. At least, it is believed that heat treated dredged sea soil can be used as a <b>solidifying</b> <b>agent</b> in combination with lime because hydration of lime can provide necessary amount of calcium hydroxide for pozzolanic reaction of heat treated dredged sea soil.|$|E

Isolation of cyanobacteria could then be used to target optimal biofilm growth conditions and increase product formation. Cyanobacteria will be grown using standard organic <b>solidifying</b> <b>agents</b> and a method using glass fiber filters to produce isolated colonies.

40|$|Solid-liquid {{composites}} (gels) have {{a combination}} of properties that afford new material applications in which high solute diffusion is desirable. These composites have a soft-solid mechanical integrity and will not flow under gravity, but entrain a liquid matrix (i. e. 60 - 98 mass %) which allows for high diffusion and high reactivity. Room temperature ionic liquid (RTILs) are molten organic salts with a melting point below room temperature and negligible vapor pressure. If the RTILs are used as the liquid component of a gel, then the gel matrix will not evaporate (unlike other organic solvents) and {{may be used for}} long term applications. This thesis research applies RTIL gels for two new applications; carbon dioxide/nitrogen separation and chemical warfare agent (CWA) barrier and decontamination. Separating CO 2 from the flue gas of coal and gas fired power-plants is an increasingly economically and environmentally important gas separation. In this first study, RTIL gels are cast in a supported membrane and gas permeability and ideal selectivity are measured. The RTIL matrix has an inherent affinity for CO 2 and provides a high diffusion, hence high permeability (i. e. 500 - 700 barrer). The solidifying component is a low molecular-weight organic gelator (LMOG) which through physical bonding interactions (i. e. hydrogen bonding, pi-pi stacking and van der Walls forces) forms an entangled network which provides mechanical stability (i. e. increase trans-membrane pressure required to expel selective material from the support). In these studies two LMOGs and five RTILs are used to make supported gel membranes and determine gas permeability and temperature dependent trends. The second application for RTIL gels is a decontaminating barrier for CWAs and toxic industrial compounds (TICs). In these studies a layer of RTIL gel is applied on top of a substrate contaminated with a CWA simulant (i. e. chloroethylethylsulfide, CEES). The gel performs well as a barrier, preventing CEES vapor from penetrating the gel. Simultaneously, the RTIL gel actively decontaminated the substrate by reacting CEES with a sacrificial amine. The RTIL gel barrier was able to decontaminate up to 98 % of the CEES applied to a painted steel substrate. Two gel barriers are tested: 1) RTIL gel with a LMOG <b>solidifying</b> <b>agent,</b> and 2) RTIL gel with a polymeric cross-linked network <b>solidifying</b> <b>agent.</b> The polymer gel provided a more mechanically robust barrier, however, the LMOG gel decontaminated at a faster rate. These new applications are but two of many possible applications for RTIL gels. Their negligible vapor pressure affords long term application in ambient conditions and their unique chemistry allows them to be tailored for specific applications...|$|E

Frankia spores exhibited {{low levels of}} endogenous respiration that were at least ten-fold lower than the endogenous respiration rate of vegetative cells. The macromolecular content of purified spores and vegetative cells differed. One striking difference among the Frankia spores was their total DNA content. From DAPI staining experiments, only 9 % of strain ACN 1 AG spore population contained DNA. With strains DC 12 and EuI 1 c, 92 % and 67 % of their spore population contained DNA. The efficiency of spore germination was correlated to {{the percentage of the}} spore population containing DNA. These results suggest that the majority of strain ACN 1 AG spores were immature or nonviable. The presence of a <b>solidifying</b> <b>agent</b> inhibited the initial stages of spore germination, but had no effect once the process had been initiated. The optimal incubation temperature for spore germination was 25 °C and 30 °C for strains DC 12 and EuI 1 c, respectively.

For this purpose, we tested five induction and maintenance media (M 1 to M 5) based on MS media (macro and oligo-elements) which differed with respect to concentrations of plant hormones (2, 4 -D and BA), vitamins, sucrose, maltose, L-asparagine, and <b>solidifying</b> <b>agents.</b> All tested media induced embryogenic callus for the varieties and regenerate plantlets. However, a significant effect of variety, medium and variety × medium interaction were observed for callus induction and regeneration. Average callus growth as measured by relative fresh weight growth rate (RFWGR) across different media was the highest for ‘Amria’ (7215. 4 %) and the lowest for ‘Tomouh’ (2088. 2 %). M 1 (2 mg/L 2, 4 -D) and M 5 (3 mg/L 2, 4 -D) media gave highest RFWGR(6892. 1 % and 6332 %, respectively) and M 3 (1 mg/L 2, 4 -D) was the lowest (3708. 8 %), across different varieties.

Dredged soils are generally dumped or deposited in open water, upland or hydraulic fills. As dredged soils consist mainly of clay, some sand and other minerals, they generally display high compressibility, low yield stresses and low permeability. In order to improve the material‟s properties for possible reuse as sound geo-materials, the addition of solidifying agents, such as ordinary Portland cement (OPC) and fly ash is necessary. This study was aimed to determine the one-dimensional compressibility the treated soil, with relation to the <b>solidifying</b> <b>agent</b> dosage and curing period. Standard oedometer tests were carried out on the untreated and treated dredged soils for comparison purposes. The dredged soils were collected from Sungai Dinding, Lumut, Perak.

The solutions solidified inside the capsules when cooled to room temperature. Acconon® C- 44 and Gelucire® 44 / 14 had a greater propensity for solidifying the triglyceride of medium chain fatty acids (Captex® 355, ABITEC) rather than the monoglyceride.

One of the most environmentally friendly techniques used during a response operation is the enhancement of the natural biodegradation of oil; such technique is called Bioremediation. Bioremediation uses bacteria capability to biodegrade almost all organic contaminants and many inorganic contaminants (Doerffer, 1992 and NRC, 1993). Although bioremediation is a slow response technique, it could be useful in avoiding secondary environmental impacts. The most used response technique is the mechanical removal of spilled oil. However, using mechanical removal of oil without consideration of environmental risks could create more problems than it could solve because of huge amount of waste generated and the harmful physical impacts on the environment (Ferriere, 1993). Another physical response method is in-situ burning, which eliminates spilled oil quickly. However, some times in-situ burning cannot be applied because of secondary pollution effects that could occur in the vicinity due to air pollution. The applicability of an oil spill response method depends on several factors: type of oil, location of the spill, sensitive areas that could be affected, water temperature, weather conditions, type of shore-line, boat traffic, and so forth. In summary, several methods should be used to respond to a given oil spill to avoid environmental impacts and to ensure the safety and health of the public. After analyzing raster geographic data of John U. Lloyd State Park (JUL), appropriate spill response methods were determined. The ArcView® Image Analysis extension (AlA), an extension to enhance image analysis abilities of Arc View® software, was used. Two tools or functions from AlA were used to gather image features of similar spectral value and create a land cover classification: a generalized unsupervised classification and the seed tool. Valuable information about protection of the environment from the effects of an oil spill is included as new themes and attribute tables. A literature research on oil spill response techniques was stored on an Arc View® Project (APR) ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: In situ {{assembly}} of high thermal conductivity materials in severely confined spaces {{is an important}} problem bringing with it scientific challenges but also significant application relevance. Here we present a simple, affordable, and reproducible methodology for synthesizing such materials, composed of hierarchical diamond micro/nanoparticle scaf-folds and an ethylenediamine coating. An important feature of the assembly process is the utilization of ethylenediamine as an immobilizing agent to secure {{the integrity of the}} microparticle scaffolds during and after each processing step. After other liquid components employed in the scaffolds assembly dry out, the immobilization <b>agent</b> <b>solidifies</b> forming a stable coated particle scaffold structure. Nanoparticles tend to concentrate in the shell and neck regions between adjacent microparticles. The interface between core and shell, along with the concentrated neck regions of nanoparticles, significantly enhance the thermal conductivity, making such materials an excellent candidate as thermal underfills in the electronics industry, where efficient heat removal is a major stumbling block toward increasing packing density. We show that the presented structures exhibit nearly 1 order of magnitude improvement in thermal conductivity, enhanced temperature uniformity, and reduced processing time compared to commercially available products for electronics cooling, which underpins their potential utility...|$|R
40|$|The thesis explores three questions: On what basis were Ontario voters courted {{during the}} 1993 federal {{election}} by the Reform Party of Canada? What are the political, economic, and demographic predictors of Reform support in Ontario? What {{are the implications}} of Reform support in Ontario for the Canadian party system? The thesis proceeds to structure the exploration of these questions within three schools of thought: post-modernism, political party systems theory, and theories regarding the emergence of collective behaviour. The thesis explores these questions using a variety of methodologies, including re-examinations of electoral data in order to control for rural, sub-urban, and urban effects, demographic and economic data gathered from Statistics Canada, and a questionnaire completed by Reform Party candidates in the 1993 federal election. The thesis explores the effect of previous federal, provincial, and referendum voting patterns on Reform Party support. The thesis concludes that: (1) the Reform Party vote in Ontario is the vote of the ideologically-committed right wing, (2) the Party's support is concentrated in mid-sized urban Ontario and defies a rural description, (3) the support is that of the economically secure who are facing declining opportunities, (4) the politicization of citizen alienation through the themes of parliamentary reform and populism has been key in developing activism in Ontario, and fiscal conservatism is a <b>solidifying</b> <b>agent</b> of this conversion. The thesis explores the implications of the Reform Party's success in Ontario, particularly whether the party can escape the inherent difficulties between populism and parliamentary democracy. The thesis concludes with a discussion of whether the party is the harbinger of fundamental change in the Canadian political party system. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|E
40|$|Typescript. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Hawaii at Manoa, 1984. Bibliography: leaves [82]- 88. Photocopy. Microfilm. viii, 88 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmThe {{sexuality}} of Phytophthora capsici was {{studied in}} 30 isolates. with cultures from solanaceous and nonsolanaceous hosts. including Leonian's type culture. Of the 30 isolates. 4 {{belonged to the}} Al compatibility type, 7 were A 2 and 19 were infertile or AO. Fertility varied among the 11 fertile isolates from highly fertile to very low in fertility. Seven of the 11 isolates produced a few oospores in unpaired (solo) cultures. Although P. capsici has been considered a heterothallic species. oospore distribution patterns in pairings between compatible Al and A 2 isolates suggested mutual induction of oospore formation. Oogonia and oospores which formed near the A 2 colony were smaller than those developing near the Al colony suggesting that the smaller bodies were A 2 products and the Jarger bodies were formed by the Al isolate. This was confirmed in pairings physically separated by polycarbonate membranes. Several oosporogenic pathways in P. capsici were distinguished and five categories were suggested for the genus: (1) homothallism sensu stricto. (2) induced homothallism. (3) noninduced homothallism; (4) secondary homothallism and (5) heterothallism. The optimal temperature for oospore formation in darkness was 20 - 24 C. whereas 31 C was distinctly inhibitory to oospore production. Light inhibition of oospore formation {{was found to be}} temperature dependent. Effect of light over the spectrum from 290 to 750 nm was minimal at 16 C, while at 24 C there was pronounced inhibition at 440 - 470 nm with some inhibition between 500 and 700 nm. Indirect effects of light were discovered in comparisons of several culture media used to study oosporogenesis. Clarified vegetable juice agar, oatmeal agar, and a synthetic medium, inhibited oospore formation when these were exposed to light prior to inoculation with the Al and A 2 compatibility types. Rape-malt agar was not affected by light under the present test conditions. Phytophthora capsici produced abundant oospores when Difco Bacto agar was used as the <b>solidifying</b> <b>agent</b> but oospore production was greatly reduced on Seakem HGT(P) agarose, Difco Noble agar or Difco Purified agar. Chlamydospores were found in 20 of 29 isolates of P. capsici using a submerged culture method. Chlamydospores were not produced in the papaya fruit broth method developed for P. palmivora. The ready production of chlamydospores in most of these isolates of P. capsici suggested a need to expand the original description to provide for the presence of chlamydospores in some isolates...|$|E
40|$|Intermediate-level {{waste is}} immobilized in a {{monolithic}} solid of low dispersibility. Portland cement, bitumen, and organic polymers {{are used by}} many waste conditioning plants to achieve that purpose. However, each has some drawbacks that cause concern, and requires improvements or even the switch to a different better <b>solidifying</b> <b>agent.</b> Alkali-activated aluminosilicate binders, known as geopolymers, are investigated in this work for possible application in intermediate-level waste solidification. Samples were preparedfrom commercial geopolymer (TROLIT), loaded with 10 wt. % or 15 wt. %, dry simulated ILW. Quinary brine or water were used as leachants. Samples were soaked {{for more than six}} months and the fraction of Sr, Cs, and Mo leached was measured with time. Some samples were loaded with ILW plus NH$_{ 4 }$TcO$_{ 4 }$, ILW plus UO$_{ 2 }$(NO$_{ 3 }$) $_{ 2 }$, or U$_{ 3 }$O$_{ 8 }$ for comparison. Control samples were made of high alumina cement with sodium-silicate hardener (cementglass). Results show that strontium is reasonably immobilized. Its concentrations in water were below detection limit. In Q-brine, 2 - 7 wt. % was leached in 6 months. Cesium was leached more rapidly than strontium. Leached fractions were 1 - 11 wt. % and 14 - 28 wt. % in water and Q-brine, respectively, depending on the composition. Retention of high valence ions, such as Mo$^{ 6 +}$, Tc$^{ 7 +}$, and U$^{ 6 +}$, was poor. 20 - 40 wt. % of the Mo was leached in water, and 4 - 18 wt. % was leached in Q-brine. Technetium (starting as NH$_{ 4 }$TcO$_{ 4 }$) was almost all in the leachant (water or Q-brine) in about one month. From solidified UO$_{ 2 }$(NO$_{ 3 }$) $_{ 2 }$ plus ILW, 36 wt. % was leached in water. The results for Sr, and Cs are better than those published for ordinarypPortland cement. However, the values obtained for technetium and uranium are unfavorable. Tolerance of solidified matrix to water was quite adequate. Samples maintained their shape, dimensions, and strength {{to the end of the}} experiments. On the contrary, tolerance of most compositions to Q-brine was poor. Samples were sometimes cracked between one and four weeks. Some compositions experienced no changes through the experimental duration. In comparison, cement-glass gave better results under the same conditions. Concentrations of Mo, and Sr were below detection levels in all cases. Cs was also not detectable in Q-brine. Only 4 - 6 wt. % of cesium was leached into water. In addition, tolerance to both water and Q-brine was quite good...|$|E
40|$|Two {{distinctly}} different organelles of locomotion {{are produced by}} Vibrio parahaemolyticus. The polar flagellum is responsible for motility in a liquid environment (swimming), and the lateral flagella enable the bacteria to move over surfaces (swarming). Synthesis of lateral flagella occurs when V. parahaemolyticus is grown on agar media but not when it is grown in liquid media. We used lux (luminescence gene) fusions to conveniently and sensitively analyze the factors which influence transcription of lateral flagella genes (laf). Transposon mini-Mu lux was used to mutagenize V. parahaemolyticus and to generate laf::lux transcriptional fusions. Mutants with insertions of mini-Mu lux in laf genes were defective in the swarming phenotype and produced light when the bacteria were propagated on agar media, but not when cells were grown in liquid media. Thus, surface-dependent expression of lateral flagella synthesis is controlled by regulation of transcription. Such fusion strains were also used to further define the environmental conditions which induce laf gene expression. Cultivation on media <b>solidified</b> by gelling <b>agents</b> other than agar also induced light production in fusion strains, as did growth {{on a variety of}} hydrophilic membrane filters suspended over liquid media. Growth at an air-surface interface was not necessary for expression since embedding the fusion strains in agar was also effective. Furthermore, induction of laf gene transcription could also be accomplished by increasing the viscosity of the liquid medium by the addition of a high-molecular-weight polymer such as polyvinylpyrrolidone. Increase in luminescence of the fusion strains was detected within 30 min of initiation of the inducing circumstance, and reversal of induction, e. g., by dilution of the viscous medium, resulted in a rapid decline in the rate of increase in luminescence. Conditions that induced luminescence in the fusion strains also induced the synthesis of lateral flagella in wild-type V. parahaemolyticus. The growth environment of the genes, and it appears that the signal that triggers laf expression is physical rather than chemical in nature. Possibilities for a sensing mechanism are discussed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe report petrographic, {{major and}} trace element data for xenoliths from the andesitic Avacha volcano (Kamchatka), which host orthopyroxene (opx) -rich veins of mantle origin formed either by rapid {{crystallization}} of intruded melts or by their {{interaction with the}} host harzburgite. Studies of such veins may give better insights into sub-arc mantle processes (in particular on a millimetre to centimetre scale) than those of (1) arc xenoliths that do not preserve <b>solidified</b> initial metasomatizing <b>agents,</b> (2) massif peridotites, probably modified during their emplacement, or (3) arc magmatic rocks, which provide indirect information. We seek to trace the evolution of these agents as they react with the host peridotite and to assess {{their impact on the}} wall-rocks. The veins cross-cut spinel harzburgite and consist mainly of opx with minor olivine, clinopyroxene (cpx) and/or amphibole. We identify 'rapidly crystallized' veins that cut wall-rock olivine without petrographic evidence of reaction, and 'reactive' veins subdivided into 'thick' (0 * 5 - 1 mm) and 'thin' (<€ 0 * 5 mm). Minerals in the rapidly crystallized veins are depleted in rare earth elements (REE) and high field strength elements (HFSE) and enriched in fluid-mobile elements relative to REE. Minerals in the reactive veins have higher Ti, Al, Cr and alkalis than minerals in the rapidly crystallized veins, as well as highly variable trace element abundances, especially in reaction zones, thin veins and related metasomatic pockets in the host peridotite. They commonly show U-shaped REE patterns and positive Zr and Hf spikes in normalized trace element patterns. Our data, supported by recent reports, show that the rapidly crystallized veins formed between 1200 °C and 900 °C from a liquid derived by fluid-fluxed melting of a refractory (harzburgitic) mantle source depleted in heavy REE. The reactive veins formed via 'fractionation-reactive percolation' from fractionated hydrous derivatives of the melts that precipitated the rapidly crystallized veins. These liquids re-equilibrated with the host through diffusion and fluid-assisted dissolution-precipitation reactions, whose end-products are thin reactive veins and metasomatic pockets with distinctive U-shaped REE patterns and Zr-Hf spikes. Some Avacha xenoliths contain veins of Fe-rich amphibole deposited from the host magma that penetrated fractures in the peridotite fragments during their transport to the surface. These products of contamination were mistakenly attributed to mantle metasomatism in previous studies of other suites of Avacha mantle xenoliths. Trace element abundances in such veins are higher than for reactive veins of mantle origin, but both have similar trace element patterns (U-shaped REE patterns and Zr-Hf spikes) suggesting that 'fractionation-reactive percolation' also took place during their formation and is common during interaction of refractory peridotites with percolating melts and fluids. Metasomatic pockets of cpx and amphibole replacing coarse opx and spinel in the host peridotites commonly occur in the vicinity of fractures that lead to reactive opx-rich veins. The cpx and amphiboles in the pockets show progressive depletion in middle REE and HFSE at constant light REE and/or large ion lithophile elements away from the veins towards the host. This indicates that residual hydrous fluids expelled from the source veins enriched the wall-rock peridotites in incompatible elements but were progressively modified by reaction with the host with increasing percolation distance. This process produces disseminated pockets of metasomatic minerals with a broad range of compositions from a single initial liquid and strongly affects the trace element budgets of the harzburgite xenoliths from Avacha. We show that melts and fluids are likely to undergo profound transformation as they travel through and react with the refractory host mantle, even on a millimetre to centimetre scale. The composition of the initial metasomatizing agents can only be inferred from the composition of the metasomatic phases in mantle rocks combined with appropriate partition coefficients if these phases come from well-equilibrated mineral assemblages located close to melt and/or fluid sources...|$|R
