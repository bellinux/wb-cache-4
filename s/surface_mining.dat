5|$|Near its mouth, the {{surficial}} geology in {{the vicinity}} of Nanticoke Creek mainly consists of alluvium (which mainly consists of stratified silt, sand, and gravel, with some boulders), Wisconsinan Outwash (which contains stratified sand and gravel), and urban land (which is highly disrupted by cut and fill). Further upstream, the surficial geology mainly consists of coal dumps and <b>surface</b> <b>mining</b> land (both of which are rich in rick waste), as well as a glacial or resedimented till known as Wisconsinan Till, and bedrock consisting of sandstone and shale. The upper reaches of the creek mainly are around surficial geology consisting of <b>surface</b> <b>mining</b> land, bedrock, and Wisconsinan Till.|$|E
5|$|Oil shale mining {{involves}} {{a number of}} environmental impacts, more pronounced in <b>surface</b> <b>mining</b> than in underground mining.

40|$|The {{employment}} of Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) data for <b>surface</b> coal <b>mine</b> inventory and inspection applications {{has been extensively}} investigated. However, in spite of encouraging research results, MSS data have not gained wide acceptance for <b>surface</b> <b>mine</b> monitoring operations. This situation is partly related to MSS spatial resolution (80 m), which is considered insufficient for detailed <b>surface</b> <b>mine</b> inspection. The Thematic Mapper (TM) employed on the Landsat- 4 and 5 satellites provides an improved resolution (30 m) and other refinements which are expected to enhance the usefulness of TM data relative to MSS data. The present paper reports research which was conducted to assess the usefulness of actual TM data and to quantitatively evaluate the contribution of individual sensor characteristics to data utility for <b>surface</b> <b>mine</b> monitoring. The obtained results demonstrate that the TM spatial resolution can be of immediate benefit for certain applications such as <b>surface</b> <b>mine</b> monitoring...|$|R

5|$|Mining {{oil shale}} {{involves}} {{a number of}} environmental impacts, more pronounced in <b>surface</b> <b>mining</b> than in underground mining. These include acid drainage induced by the sudden rapid exposure and subsequent oxidation of formerly buried materials, the introduction of metals including mercury into surface-water and groundwater, increased erosion, sulfur-gas emissions, and air pollution caused by the production of particulates during processing, transport, and support activities. In 2002, about 97% of air pollution, 86% of total waste and 23% of water pollution in Estonia came from the power industry, which uses oil shale as the main resource for its power production.|$|E
5|$|Most {{exploitation}} of oil shale involves mining followed by shipping elsewhere, after {{which one can}} burn the shale directly to generate electricity, or undertake further processing. The most common methods of <b>surface</b> <b>mining</b> involve open pit mining and strip mining. These procedures remove most of the overlying material to expose the deposits of oil shale, and become practical when the deposits occur near the surface. Underground mining of oil shale, which removes less of the overlying material, employs the room-and-pillar method.|$|E
5|$|MD36 {{passes through}} the Georges Creek Valley, which {{has a long history}} of coal mining. In {{recognition}} of this, the MDSHA has designated MD36 as part of the Coal Heritage Scenic Byway. Coal mining was a major industry in western Maryland in the 19th century, with railroads being the major route connecting the coal mines to markets outside the Georges Creek Valley. Deep mining, which was the primary mining method used in western Maryland, declined in use after World WarII, replaced primarily by <b>surface</b> <b>mining.</b> Although Maryland coal production is now only a small fraction of total U.S. coal production, coal from the Georges Creek Valley is used to power the AES Warrior Run power plant in Cumberland.|$|E

5|$|Mining {{generally}} {{performed well}} {{at the end of}} the medieval period, helped by buoyant demand for manufactured and luxury goods. Cornish tin production plunged during the Black Death itself, leading to a doubling of prices. Tin exports also collapsed catastrophically, but picked up again over the next few years. By the turn of the 16th century, the available alluvial tin deposits in Cornwall and Devon had begun to decline, leading to the commencement of bell and <b>surface</b> <b>mining</b> to support the tin boom that had occurred in the late 15th century. Lead mining increased, and output almost doubled between 1300 and 1500. Wood and charcoal became cheaper once again after the Black Death, and coal production declined as a result, remaining depressed for the rest of the period – nonetheless, some coal production was occurring in all the major English coalfields by the 16th century. Iron production continued to increase; the Weald in the South-East began to make increased use of water-power, and overtook the Forest of Dean in the 15th century as England's main iron-producing region. The first blast furnace in England, a major technical step forward in metal smelting, was created in 1496 in Newbridge in the Weald.|$|E
5|$|Mining in the creek's {{watershed}} {{began in}} 1844. A number of mining villages {{existed in the}} Tangascootack Creek watershed between 1845 and 1870. In the mid-1850s the Farrandsville Iron Company purchased large amounts of land in several places, including along Tangascootack Creek. In 1870 all of the mines in the area closed and lumbering became the area's most significant industry, with millions of board feet being floated downstream. The railroad tracks were removed and the mine buildings were abandoned or burned down. However, deep mining of the Clarion coal formation and the Lower Kittaning coal formation in the Tangascootack Creek watershed began in the 1800s and continued into the early 1900s. Strip mining operations began in the 1950s and 1960s, {{with some of the}} deep mines and surface mines being remined in the 1980s. The Independent Regulatory Review Commission issued a statement in the summer of 1987, saying that part of the North Fork Tangascootack Creek watershed was no longer suitable for <b>surface</b> <b>mining.</b> Treatment of the watershed began as early as 1998. Several projects devoted to improving the water quality of the creek had begun by 2001, by which point several more projects were planned. At least one of these projects involves the use of biosolids to encourage vegetation growth.|$|E
5|$|In June 1916, the Russian {{geologist}} Nikolay Pogrebov oversaw mining of {{the first}} tonnes of oil shale at Pavandu and delivered it to Saint Petersburg (then Petrograd) Polytechnic Institute for large-scale experiments. These events marking {{the beginning of the}} Estonian oil shale industry took place {{more than half a century}} after an oil shale industry had emerged in Scotland, the leading oil shale industry in 1916, and a decade before the industry emerged in China, which, besides Estonia, is today the other leading oil shale-exploiting country. In 1916 a total of 640–690tonnes of oil shale were sent to Saint Petersburg for testing. The tests proved that the oil shale was suitable for combustion as a solid fuel and for extraction of oil shale gas and shale oil. Based on these promising results, a plan for oil shale mining in Estonia was presented to the Emperor Nicholas II on 3 January 1917. On 13 February 1917, the Council of Ministers of Russia allocated 1.2million rubles to purchase land and start mining activities. After the February Revolution, the Russian Provisional Government appointed a special commissioner for oil shale purchasing and stockpiling who began preliminary work for the digging of an oil shale mine at Pavandu, with full-scale construction carried out by about 500workers, including war prisoners, in the summer of 1917. After the October Revolution, financing ceased and construction stopped. Two private Saint Petersburg firms, established specially for oil shale mining, Böckel& Co. and Mutschnik& Co., which in the fall of 1916 had begun <b>surface</b> <b>mining</b> at Kukruse and Järve, respectively, also terminated their mining activities in 1917.|$|E

25|$|<b>Surface</b> <b>mining</b> of coal {{completely}} eliminates existing vegetation, {{destroys the}} genetic soil profile, displaces or destroys wildlife and habitat, degrades air quality, alters current land uses, {{and to some}} extent permanently changes the general topography of the area mined.

Of greater concern, the movement, storage, and redistribution of soil during mining can disrupt the community of soil microorganisms and consequently nutrient cycling processes. Rehabilitation or reclamation mitigates some of these concerns and is required by US Federal Law, specifically the <b>Surface</b> <b>Mining</b> Control and Reclamation Act of 1977.|$|E
