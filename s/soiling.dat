5|$|Archibald {{and colleagues}} {{suggested}} that the behavioural habits for Myrmeciites ants, like that of other extinct Myrmeciinae taxa, may have been similar to its extant relatives. Workers would forage onto trees or vegetation to capture arthropod prey or to feed on nectar, <b>soiling</b> either in the ground or in the trees, making them an arboreal nesting insect. Like other Myrmeciine ants, Myrmeciites most likely did not lay pheromone trails or recruit nestmates to food sources; these ants may have been solitary foragers, relying on their eyes to hunt for prey and for navigational purposes. The nuptial flight of M. (?) tabanifluviensis probably occurred during the late spring or summer, as in extant relatives.|$|E

The courses included sensation, perception, emotion, memory, and applications of psychology to professions such as law, medicine, schooling and clerical work by priests.|$|E

25|$|Scouring, is a {{chemical}} washing process {{carried out on}} cotton fabric to remove natural wax and non-fibrous impurities (e.g. the remains of seed fragments) from the fibres and any added <b>soiling</b> or dirt.
