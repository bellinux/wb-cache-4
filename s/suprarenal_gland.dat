25|$|Dr Oliver, I was told, … had a liking and a ′flair′ for the {{invention}} of simple appliances, with which observations and experiments could {{be made on the}} human subject. Dr Oliver had invented a small instrument with which he claimed to be able to measure, through the unbroken skin, the diameter of a living artery, such as the radial artery at the wrist. He appears to have used his family in his experiments, and a young son {{was the subject of a}} series, in which Dr Oliver measured the diameter of the radial artery, and observed the effect upon it of injecting extracts of various animal glands under the skin. … We may picture, then, Professor Schafer, in the old physiological laboratory at University College, … finishing an experiment of some kind, in which he was recording the arterial blood pressure of an anaesthetised dog. … To him enters Dr Oliver, with the story of the experiments on his boy, and, in particular, with the statement that injection under the skin of a glycerin extract from calf’s <b>suprarenal</b> <b>gland</b> was followed by a definite narrowing of the radial artery. Professor Schafer is said to have been entirely sceptical, and to have attributed the observation to self-delusion. … He can hardly be blamed, I think; knowing even what we now know about the action of this extract, which of us would be prepared to believe that injecting it under a boy’s skin would cause his radial artery to become measurably more slender? Dr Oliver, however, is persistent; he … suggests that, at least, it will do no harm to inject into the circulation, through a vein, a little of the suprarenal extract, which he produces from his pocket. So Professor Schafer makes the injection, expecting a triumphant demonstration of nothing, and finds himself standing ′like some watcher of the skies, when a new planet swims into his ken,′ watching the mercury rise in the manometer with amazing rapidity and to an astounding height.|$|E

The results may be summarized as followings: 1) Ascorbic acid content in the <b>suprarenal</b> <b>gland</b> of guinea-pigs suffering from combustion decreases gradually as time progresses. Its decreasing ratio is greater than the control normal animal and most remarkably contrasted especially in an earlier stage after the combustion. 2) The decrease of ascorbic acid content in the <b>suprarenal</b> <b>gland</b> of guinea-pigs suffering from combustion is greater in amount according as the degree of combustion is serious. 3) It may be pointed out as principal changes of the histological structure due to combustion in the <b>suprarenal</b> <b>gland</b> that the decrease of lipoid substances, atrophy, swelling and necrosis of cell, karyolysis and karyoklasis, vasodilatation, hyperaemia and blood stagnation in cortex; vacuole formation in medulla. 4) These histological changes, though manifold according to the degree of combustion and to the time course after it, are most prominent in reticular and fascicular zones in the <b>suprarenal</b> <b>gland.</b> 5) Lipoid substances in the <b>suprarenal</b> <b>gland</b> after the combustion are almost disappeared in the haemorrhagic and necrotic areas. 6) Although there are parallel relations between the decrease of ascorbic acid content and the change of histological structure in the <b>suprarenal</b> <b>gland</b> after the combustion, occurrence of the former precedes in time than the latter. 7) It is concluded that the decrease of ascorbic acid content and the change of histological structure in the <b>suprarenal</b> <b>gland</b> after the combustion are due to the action of toxin produced by combustion...|$|E
