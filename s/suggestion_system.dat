5000|$|Kaizen {{is a daily}} process, {{the purpose}} of which goes beyond simple {{productivity}} improvement. It is also a process that, when done correctly, humanizes the workplace, eliminates overly hard work (muri), and teaches people how to perform experiments on their work using the scientific method and how to learn to spot and eliminate waste in business processes. In all, the process suggests a humanized approach to workers and to increasing productivity: [...] "The idea is to nurture the company's people {{as much as it}} is to praise and encourage participation in kaizen activities." [...] Successful implementation requires [...] "the participation of workers in the improvement."People at all levels of an organization participate in kaizen, from the CEO down to janitorial staff, as well as external stakeholders when applicable. Kaizen is most commonly associated with manufacturing operations, as at Toyota, but has also been used in non-manufacturing environments. The format for kaizen can be individual, <b>suggestion</b> <b>system,</b> small group, or large group. At Toyota, it is usually a local improvement within a workstation or local area and involves a small group in improving their own work environment and productivity. This group is often guided through the kaizen process by a line supervisor; sometimes this is the line supervisor's key role. Kaizen on a broad, cross-departmental scale in companies, generates total quality management, and frees human efforts through improving productivity using machines and computing power.|$|E

In doing so, {{it could be used}} as a guideline in starting up a <b>suggestion</b> <b>system</b> or to contribute to a more successful existing system. A literature study approach is followed to establish which factors contribute to the success and failure of various suggestion systems. It was found that fourteen factors seem to contribute to the success of any <b>suggestion</b> <b>system.</b> Although all the factors are not equally important, they all contribute to the success of the system. All employees have ideas regardless of whether or not the environment is conducive but the employee will only submits it if the environment is seen as supportive. That means that the organisation that wishes to have a successful <b>suggestion</b> <b>system</b> must be creative and innovative. Practical implications are that a <b>suggestion</b> <b>system</b> can be a very powerful management tool.

The {{purpose of this paper}} is to ask the following research questions: What are the outcomes of individual or group <b>suggestion</b> <b>systems</b> implementation? Which of the two programs, individual or groups, is more profitable for the companies? What problems arise during the use of these programs? Methodology: Case Study, we will analyse the evolution of the formal programs of continuous improvement of a firm in a traditional sector (food) over the course of 5 years. The data for our research were gathered by means of participatory observation over the course of 18 months spent in the firm attending the meetings of the improvement teams. Findings: Both programs (individual and group) have proved to be very profitable for the company. However, we have seen that there is no magic formula for the correct operation of the system of continuous improvement, but that the existing system has to be continually improved, correcting faults and trying always to contribute something new to re-launch the system every so often. Practical implication: This study has also permitted us to highlight the importance of continuous improvement in the firm from both the economic point of view and that of worker development.

In particular, the paper explores the efficacy of methods for mobilizing latent knowledge from decentralized sources such as workers and customers, or “voice”. Plants using voice practices did better than other plants if they had a highly effective suggestion program for workers, or if they adopted at least two voice practices, such as a) suggestions from workers and long-term, informationrich relations with customers, or b) suggestions from workers and efficiency wages for workers. Despite this evidence that certain practices may be complementary in their performance, there was little complementarity in adoption.
