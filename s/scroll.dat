5|$|The Hachisuka <b>scroll</b> {{contains}} paintings {{which are}} not associated with any text sections of the <b>scroll.</b> The fifth painting of the <b>scroll</b> corresponds to a scene described in the second text section of the Hinohara <b>scroll,</b> where Murasaki Shikibu is looking back to her first time at court. The painting shows Murasaki Shikibu inside a room with closed tsumado (hinged plank door) and shitomido (latticed shutters). Next to her is an old-fashioned interior light-fixture consisting of a wooden pole with an oil-filled dish and wick {{on top of it}} (tōdai).|$|E

40|$|<b>Scrolling</b> is an {{integral}} part of our everyday computing experience, and many techniques and devices have been developed to enhance <b>scrolling.</b> We have conducted an 18 participant user study to understand how users' gaze position and <b>scrolling</b> strategies are coordinated. Our data showed that people <b>scrolled</b> within preferred reading regions of the screen. <b>Scrolling</b> patterns were also influenced by document structure, with most <b>scrolling</b> occurring at the intersection between paragraphs, in order to bring new text into the preferred reading region. We conclude with the implications of our findings with a new gaze-enhanced <b>scrolling</b> technique aimed to support behaviors evident in manual <b>scrolling...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Scrolling</b> is an {{essential}} part of our everyday computing experience. Contemporary <b>scrolling</b> techniques rely on the explicit initiation of <b>scrolling</b> by the user. The act of <b>scrolling</b> is tightly coupled with the user’s ability to absorb information via the visual channel. The use of eye gaze information is therefore a natural choice for enhancing <b>scrolling</b> techniques. We present several gaze-enhanced <b>scrolling</b> techniques for manual and automatic <b>scrolling</b> which use gaze information as a primary input or as an augmented input. We also introduce the use off-screen gaze-actuated buttons for document navigation and control...|$|R
5|$|Twilight sadly {{returns to}} the library, {{preparing}} to pack and leave Ponyville, when she finds Spike coughing up <b>scroll</b> after <b>scroll.</b> Twilight is surprised to find these to be the friendship report letters that she had previously sent to Celestia, and the memories of her friendships in Ponyville make her regain her color. Inspired by this, she returns to her other four best friends and uses a memory spell to remind them of their friendship, cancelling Discord's magic and returning them to normal.|$|E
5|$|With {{help from}} the {{treasure}} hunter Jon, Musashi finds the Earth <b>Scroll</b> and defeats its crest guardian. After its defeat, half-vampire and half-zombie creatures known as Vambees appear in the nearby village. While searching {{for a way to}} stop the Vambees, Musashi finds the Water <b>Scroll</b> and defeats its crest guardian in the basement where the Vambees originate. While Musashi searches for the Fire <b>Scroll,</b> Musashi's rival, Kojiro, kidnaps Princess Fillet and uses her as a hostage to force a battle with Musashi. Kojiro is defeated and Fillet is then rescued. Musashi then searches for thieves from the Thirstquencher Empire and makes his way to the next crest guardian. It is then revealed that Princess Fillet is actually one of Thirstquencher's thieves disguised and that the real Fillet is still in their hands. Musashi then continues his journey, finds the Wind <b>Scroll,</b> and defeats its crest guardian in an ants' nest.|$|E

5000|$|When the <b>scrolls</b> {{were first}} {{completed}} and kept at the Kasuga shrine, the <b>scrolls</b> were carefully protected—with no shrine priest or Kōfukuji monk less than 40 {{years of age}} able to view the <b>scrolls.</b> Moreover, if the <b>scrolls</b> were required at Kōfukuji, {{it was only the}} Tōbokuin sanctuary that was permitted to receive the <b>scrolls.</b> However, for a while, during the late 18th Century, the <b>scrolls</b> became less carefully looked after. The <b>scrolls</b> were most likely treated more casually because of the decline suffered by Kasuga and Kōfukuji at the time.|$|R
5000|$|Vertical Fine <b>Scrolling</b> allows single {{scan line}} {{movement}} of the <b>scrolling</b> region for Text and Map modes which are greater than one scan line tall. Vertical Fine <b>Scrolling</b> for Map modes only one scan line tall is logically not practical. The effect of vertical [...] "fine" [...] <b>scrolling</b> for single scan line Map modes can be performed using the easier coarse <b>scrolling</b> method.|$|R

5|$|The Bolton Wanderers club badge {{consists}} of the initials of the club {{in the shape of}} a ball, with a red <b>scroll</b> and Lancashire rose underneath. The current badge is a reimagining of one designed in 1975; this was replaced in 2001 by a badge which retained the recognisable initials but controversially exchanged the <b>scroll</b> and rose for blue and red ribbons. The re-design has been welcomed by fans who saw the ribbons as a poor choice. The original club badge was the town crest of Bolton, a key feature of which was the Elephant and Castle motif with the town motto – Supera Moras. This feature has been reincorporated into more recent club shirts.|$|E

5|$|The player later {{meets with}} members of the Blades, an order of dragon hunters. The player and the Blades travel to Alduin's Wall, a prophetic engravement, to learn that ancient Nords used a special shout against Alduin so they could engage him. To gain more information, the player meets the ancient dragon Paarthurnax, the leader of the Greybeards. Paarthurnax reveals that Alduin was cast into the {{currents}} of time by the use of an Elder <b>Scroll</b> in the hope that he would never reemerge. The player locates the Elder <b>Scroll</b> and uses it to peer through a window in time and learn the shout to combat Alduin. The player battles with Alduin, who then flees to Sovngarde, the Nordic afterlife, to gain strength by devouring the souls of deceased Nords.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{generalized}} definition of <b>scrolling</b> that unifies {{a wide range}} of existing interaction techniques, from con-ventional <b>scrolling</b> through pan and zoom systems and fish-eye views. Furthermore it suggests a useful class of new <b>scrolling</b> techniques in which objects do not move across the display. These “stationary <b>scrolling</b> ” techniques do not exhibit either of two problems that plague spatial <b>scrolling</b> system: discontinuity in salience and the undermining of the user’s spatial memory...|$|R

5|$|The third scene {{held by the}} Gotoh {{museum was}} {{originally}} the fourth segment of the Matsudaira clan <b>scroll.</b> It is therefore preceded by the segment held by the Agency for Cultural Affairs and followed by the 5th segment of the Matsudaira clan <b>scroll</b> which is in possession of the Morikawa family. Like those segments, this scene is dated to {{the evening of the}} Ika-no-iwai celebration of Atsuhira-shinnō. It shows drunk and disordered court nobles amusing themselves with court ladies. This painting is particularly notable for its lifelike depiction of facial expressions and shapes of each figure in the scene.|$|E
5|$|The {{troops for}} the Ranger company {{were to be}} Airborne qualified, so the Ranger Training Center heavily {{recruited}} troops from the 82nd Airborne Division and 11th Airborne Division who had already completed United States Army Airborne School. In spite of this, only one Ranger operation in the conflict ever required an airborne landing. They initially wore a black and gold <b>scroll</b> as a shoulder sleeve insignia, but that insignia was later redesignated the Ranger Tab and the Rangers adopted a black, red and white <b>scroll</b> similar to that unofficially worn by Ranger Battalions in World War II.|$|E
5|$|After {{finding the}} fifth and final <b>Scroll,</b> the Sky <b>Scroll,</b> Musashi discovers Thirstquencher's base, a {{floating}} ship known as the Soda Fountain. Musashi attacks the base and defeats the Sky Guardian. Thirstquencher's leader, Flatski, forces Musashi to give him Lumina {{in exchange for the}} Princess, and frees the Sky Crest. However, this unleashes the Wizard of Darkness, who was sealed within Brave Fencer Musashi's sword Lumina the entire time. It is also revealed by Jon that the original Brave Fencer Musashi sealed The Dark Wizard within the sword. Furthermore, it was Brave Fencer Musashi who entrusted the crests to the crest guardians to prevent The Dark Wizard's seal within Lumina from being broken. In effect, the present Musashi's quest merely aided The Dark Wizard's revival. Musashi recovers Lumina and uses it to defeat The Dark Wizard. After returning the Princess to Allucaneet Kingdom, Musashi takes Lumina to the place where he found it.|$|E

50|$|In the 1970s, most {{vertically}} <b>scrolling</b> games involved driving. The first vertically <b>scrolling</b> {{video game}} was Taito's Speed Race, released in November 1974. Atari's Hi-way was released eleven months later in 1975. Rapidly there were driving games that combined vertical, horizontal, and even diagonal <b>scrolling,</b> making the vertical-only distinction less important. Both Atari's Super Bug (1977) and Fire Truck (1978) feature driving with multidirectional <b>scrolling.</b> Sega's Monaco GP (1979) is a vertical-only <b>scrolling</b> racing game, but in color.|$|R
5|$|Believing {{their first}} {{attempts}} {{to be too}} derivative, the developers held brain storming sessions. During a session, they agreed that one of Asteroidss favorable elements was its wrapping effect. They felt a game that allowed the player to fly off the screen would be exciting, and decided to create a game world larger than the screen displayed. The game's environment was made longer than the screen, with the visible area scrolling horizontally. Expanding on the idea, they envisioned a version of Space Invaders rotated 90degrees. By changing the orientation of Space Invaders design, the ship moved up and down while flying horizontally. Large asteroids, an element from Asteroids, were then added to the game world, but were later removed because the staff felt it lacked enjoyment. Jarvis intended the screen to <b>scroll</b> only from left to right; fellow Williams employee Steve Ritchie, however, convinced him the game {{should be able to}} <b>scroll</b> in either direction.|$|E
5|$|Football (soccer), cricket and archery are {{the most}} popular sports in Gangtok. The Paljor Stadium, which hosts {{football}} matches, is the sole sporting ground in the city. Thangka—a notable handicraft—is an elaborately hand painted religious <b>scroll</b> in brilliant colours drawn on fabric hung in a monastery or a family altar and occasionally carried by monks in ceremonial processions. Chhaams are vividly costumed monastic dances performed on ceremonial and festive occasions, especially in the monasteries during the Tibetan new year.|$|E
