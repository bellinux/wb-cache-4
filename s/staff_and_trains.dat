The study is not a comparative one but aims at establishing the approaches to <b>staff</b> development <b>and</b> <b>training</b> in academic libraries of different sizes and stages of growth. It considers the significance <b>and</b> reasons why <b>staff</b> development <b>and</b> <b>training</b> is a necessity in academic libraries. It also shows how every level of library staff needs training as it does not only include job training, but also development <b>and</b> attitude <b>training.</b> The study also identifies the staff who needs it, the different stages of <b>staff</b> development <b>and</b> <b>training</b> <b>and</b> discusses appropriate and cost effective methods used in these three libraries. It looks at and examines the positive features that contribute to the successful implementation and practice of a <b>staff</b> development <b>and</b> <b>training</b> programme in an academic library, the main and potential problem areas of <b>staff</b> development <b>and</b> <b>training</b> <b>and</b> reveals how these libraries overcome them. The study concludes with recommendations for the improvement <b>and</b> advancement of <b>staff</b> development <b>and</b> <b>training</b> in academic libraries in South Africa which it is hoped will be considered for implementation as appropriate...|$|R
