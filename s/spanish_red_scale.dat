50|$|Some ant {{species can}} {{increase}} infestations of <b>red</b> <b>scale</b> indirectly. By patrolling the branches {{in search of}} honeydew from soft scales, cottony cushion scale, mealybugs and aphids, they deter predators and parasitoids and thus enable <b>red</b> <b>scale</b> to flourish unmolested. The only mobile stage of <b>red</b> <b>scale</b> is the first instar crawler. It can move about a metre but may also be dispersed to other plants by wind, flying insects and birds as well as human activities.|$|R

In the United States it is known as California <b>red</b> <b>scale.</b> It was first found in California between 1868 and 1875, apparently brought there on planting material imported from Australia.|$|R

50|$|Graciano is a <b>Spanish</b> <b>red</b> {{wine grape}} that is grown {{primarily}} in Rioja. The vine produces a low yield that are normally harvested in late October. The wine produced {{is characterized by}} its deep red color, strong aroma and ability to age well. Graciano thrives in warm, arid climates.|$|R
50|$|This deer is {{the same}} as the West European red deer. It is light-colored, with a light-colored rump patch {{bordering}} with black. The smaller <b>Spanish</b> <b>red</b> deer (Cervus elaphus hispanicus) is more gray, while the Norwegian red deer (Cervus elaphus atlanticus) is smaller in size and paler in color.|$|R
50|$|The {{forewings}} {{are black}} and white, with <b>red</b> <b>scaling</b> throughout the wing, particularly in the basal and terminal areas. Adults are on wing from late June to early July.|$|R

50|$|Moristel {{is a minor}} <b>Spanish</b> <b>red</b> grape variety. It {{is mainly}} found in the {{autonomous}} region of Aragon {{and is one of}} the authorized varieties of the Somontano Denominación de Origen (DO). It has medium-sized, compact bunches with medium-sized, cylindrical-shaped berries with a blue hue. Traditionally it has been used for blending with other varieties to add body and colour to the wine.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 18 mm. The forewings are greenish or greyish green with fuscous cross lines, mixed with <b>red</b> <b>scales.</b> The hindwings are pale grey, becoming greenish towards the hindmargin, {{with three or}} four indistinct darker curved fasciae.|$|R

40|$|Organophosphate and {{carbamate}} insecticides {{have been used}} to treat citrus pest problems for more than 40 years. From 1990 to 1998, we documented California <b>red</b> <b>scale</b> and yellow scale resistance to these insecticides. Armored scale resistance is found on an estimated 40 % of 163, 000 acres of citrus in the San Joaquin Valley. Citrus growers have responded by either increasing their use of natural enemies, especially the parasitoid wasp Aphytis melinus, or by applying newly registered insect growth regulator or neonicotinoid insecticides. While the California <b>red</b> <b>scale</b> problem is, for the moment, greatly reduced, outbreaks of cottony cushion scale are occurring because the new insecticides are highly toxic to the predatory vedalia beetle...|$|R
50|$|In California, several predators feed on <b>red</b> <b>scale</b> {{including}} the lady beetles, Rhyzobius lophanthae, Chilocorus orbus and Chiliocorus cacti. The naturally occurring parasitic wasps, Aphytis melinus, Aphytis lingnanensis and Comperiella bifasciata {{also play a}} part in controlling <b>red</b> <b>scale</b> on citrus but their ability to do so depends on the selective use of insecticides for other pests. Careful monitoring of the host plants will indicate whether release of captive-bred Aphytis melinus is necessary and the use of pesticides should be minimized before this is done. Ants, especially the Argentine ant, Linepithema humile, and the native gray ant should also be controlled as they disrupt the relationship between the wasp and the scale insects.|$|R
