Local temperature measurements in combination with video microscopy give insight into the rich variety of factors that control ice lens formation. We observe the initiation of the lenses, their growth morphology and their final thickness and spacing, over a range of conditions, in particular the effect of the particle packing and the cooling rate. We find that increasing the particle density drastically reduces the thickness of lenses, but has little effect on the lens spacing. Therefore, the fraction of <b>segregated</b> <b>ice</b> formed reduces. The effect of the cooling rate, which is the product of the temperature gradient and the pulling speed across the temperature gradient, depends on which parameter is varied. A larger temperature gradient causes ice lenses to be initiated more frequently, while a lower pulling speed allows for more time for ice lenses to grow: both increase the fraction of <b>segregated</b> <b>ice.</b> Surprisingly, we find that the growth rate of a lens does not depend on its undercooling. Finally, we have indications of pore ice in front of the warmest ice lens, which has important consequences for the interpretation of the measured trends.

50|$|A key {{phenomenon}} {{for understanding}} ice segregation in soil or porous rock (also {{referred to as}} an ice lens due to its shape) is premelting, which {{is the development of}} a liquid film on surfaces and interfaces at temperatures significantly below their bulk melting temperature. The term premelting is used to describe the reduction in the melting temperature (below 0 °C) which results from the surface curvature of porous media confining water (the Gibbs-Thomson effect). Premelted water exists as a thin layer on the surface of ice. Under premelting conditions, ice and water can coexist at temperatures below -10 °C in a porous medium. The Gibbs-Thomson effect results in water migrating down a thermal gradient (from higher temperatures to lower temperatures); Dash states, “…material is carried to colder regions…” This can also be viewed energetically as favoring larger ice particles over smaller (Ostwald ripening). As a result, when conditions exist for ice segregation (ice lens formation) water flows toward the <b>segregated</b> <b>ice</b> and freezes on the surface, thickening the <b>segregated</b> <b>ice</b> layer.|$|R
40|$|Herschel Island (69. 583 °N; 139. 083 °W) lies off the Yukon Coastal Plain in the {{southern}} Beaufort Sea as a terminal moraine resulting from the Laurentide Ice Sheet during the Early to Middle Wisconsin and represents the likely easternmost edge of Beringia. Massive ground ice bodies in the island's permanently frozen ground are ubiquitous {{and contribute to the}} shaping of the landscape since deglaciation. Stable water isotopes (&# 948; 18 O, &# 948;D) have been analysed on various ground ice types. Since ground ice is a valuable record of climate information it can be used for palaeoenvironmental interpretation. Ice wedges on Herschel Island have begun to form in outwash and morainic deposits during the late Pleistocene after deglaciation, when dry and harsh climatic conditions promoted frost cracking. These ice wedges are remarkably depleted in their isotopic signature (&# 948; 18 O of around &# 8722; 29) compared to Holocene ice wedges (&# 948; 18 O of around 24 to 21). Within ice-rich permafrost sediments, also massive ice bodies are exposed whose appearance and isotopic composition is completely different from all other sampled ground ice types. Their &# 948; 18 O records are strongly depleted (&# 8722; 33) thus suggesting a late Pleistocene origin. The slope and d-excess lie near the Global Meteoric Water Line (GMWL) indicating that the moisture source is likely of meteoric origin without substantial alterations. Other massive ice of unknown but supposedly glacial origin was encountered adjacent to large, striated boulders. With about &# 8722; 37 for &# 948; 18 O, the ice exhibits extremely low isotopic values. The question arises, whether the ice bodies aggraded before or after deglaciation as massive <b>segregated</b> <b>ice</b> or if the ice was originally basal glacier ice buried by supraglacial till. Stable isotope geochemistry is limited to unravel the nature and origin of recovered ground ice. Therefore, hydrochemistry (pH, electrical conductivity, major ions) is used to differentiate between massive <b>segregated</b> <b>ice,</b> buried glacier ice and buried lake ice. Usually, buried ice types have low conductivity values as they derive from meteoric water. Thus, they are dominated by calcium (Ca 2 +), bicarbonate (HCO 3 -) and sulphate (SO 42 -). In turn, massive <b>segregated</b> <b>ice</b> represents frozen ground water and therefore reflects the sediment ion composition. High electrical conductivity values (> 1000 µS cm- 1) and a broad mixture of significantly occurring ions with peaks in sodium (Na+), strontium (Sr 2 +), and chloride (Cl-) are obvious. Therefore, massive <b>segregated</b> <b>ice</b> hydrochemical data resemble the Herschel Island sediments that derive from near-shore marine deposits upthrusted by the Laurentide Ice. Ongoing processing of stable isotope and hydrochemical data from ground ice will enable us (1) to provide solid evidence of the timing and the spatial extent of late Pleistocene glaciations on the Yukon Coastal Plain, and (2) to precise the age of the deposition and the processes responsible for the formation of Herschel Island...|$|R

Two generations of ground ice are distinguished within a single stratigraphic sequence. Pre-deformation ice has been glacially deformed or eroded beneath the cold-based margin of the Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS) during Marine Isotope Stage 2. Such ice comprises (1) buried basal <b>ice,</b> (2) massive <b>segregated</b> <b>ice</b> and (3) ice clasts subglacially eroded from pre-existing ground ice.

The superimposition of post-deformation intrusive ice and massive segregated-intrusive ice into permafrost containing pre-deformation ground ice indicates that substantial quantities of overpressurized water were injected into ice-marginal permafrost during or after deglaciation. The required external water source for the post-deformation intrusive ice was probably overpressurized subpermafrost groundwater in front of the retreating margin of the LIS. Injection of this water into proglacial permafrost hydraulically fractured the permafrost and formed ice dykes, ice sills and massive segregated-intrusive ice.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the interaction of}} colloidal particles with ice-water interfaces. To this end, the experimental setup we use consists of a directional solidification stage, a light microscope, and thin sample cells, which allows {{for the possibility of}} particles to be viewed at the single particle level, and thermally in two dimensions (2 D). First, the interaction of single particles with a moving ice-water interface is studied. We show that speed, ice growth facets and grain boundaries are important parameters in determining the way in which particles are incorporated into the ice. Secondly, once a particle is trapped, as along as it is not too cold, it is still free to move. This is due to the presence of premelted liquid trapped within the ice, surrounding the particles in a thin layer. Particle movement is measured by use of tracking algorithms, and related to theoretical predictions, which use a balance between a thermomolecular and a viscous force to describe the motion. The extracted premelted layer thickness and its dependence on the undercooling implies that for the particle [...] ice system, non [...] retarded van der Waals interactions dominate. However, we find that the forces in the model should be modified for particles trapped in grain boundaries, and along cellular instabilities, or if impurities are present. Thirdly, the thermomolecular motion is also key to understanding how <b>segregated</b> <b>ice,</b> ice which is devoid of particles, can form in concentrated suspensions of particles, where the pore space between particles can also stay liquid below the bulk melting temperature. We study <b>segregated</b> <b>ice</b> growth both at the macroscopic scale and at the particle level.

40|$|To {{elucidate}} {{the early stages}} of heave, settlement and fracture of intact frost-susceptible rock by temperature cycling above and below 0 °C, two physical modelling experiments were performed on 10 rectangular blocks 450 mm high of fine-grained, soft limestone. One experiment simulated 21 cycles of bidirectional freezing (upward and downward) of an active layer above permafrost, and the other simulated 26 cycles of unidirectional freezing (downward) of a seasonally frozen bedrock in a non-permafrost region. Heave and settlement of the top of the blocks were monitored in relation to rock temperature and unfrozen water content, which ranged from almost dry to almost saturated. In the bidirectional freezing experiment, heave of the wettest block initially occurred abruptly at the onset of freezing periods and gradually during thawing periods (summer heave). After the crossing of a threshold marked by the appearance of a macrocrack in the upper layer of permafrost, summer heave increased by an order of magnitude as <b>segregated</b> <b>ice</b> accumulated incrementally in macrocracks, interrupted episodically by abrupt settlement that coincided with unusually high air temperatures. In the unidirectional freezing experiment, the wet blocks heaved during freezing periods and settled during thawing periods, whereas the driest blocks showed the opposite behaviour. The two wettest blocks settled progressively during the first 15 freeze-thaw cycles, before starting to heave progressively as macrocracks developed. Four processes, operating singly or in combination in the blocks account for their heave and settlement: (1) thermal expansion and contraction caused heave and settlement when little or no water-ice phase change was involved; (2) volumetric expansion of water freezing in situ caused short bursts of heave of the outer millimetres of wet rock; (3) ice segregation deeper in the blocks caused sustained heave during thawing and freezing periods; and (4) freeze-thaw cycling caused consolidation and settlement of wet blocks prior to macrocracking in the unidirectional freezing experiment.

40|$|Permafrost {{regions are}} known to be {{susceptible}} to recent climate warming particularly with regard to positive feedback mechanisms (e. g. by the potential release of stored carbon) from permafrost. However, {{little is known about the}} potential of permafrost ice so called ground ice to store climate and environmental changes. Stable water isotope methods can under certain circumstances reveal climate information from permafrost ice and trace the changes through time. Stable water isotopes (&# 948;D, &# 948; 18 O) are well established as mostly relative paleotemperature proxies for climate studies related to ice caps and glaciers in Greenland, Antarctica and other parts of the world. For permafrost research, the water isotopes have yet been underutilized. Ground ice is defined as all types of ice contained in frozen or freezing ground, including pore <b>ice,</b> <b>segregated</b> <b>ice,</b> as well as ice wedge ice. Ice wedges are most promising as paleoclimate archives. They are distinctive due to their vertically-oriented foliations and air bubbles. Ice wedges form as winter thermal contraction cracks are periodically filled by surface water (mainly from snow melt), which quickly (re) freezes at negative ground temperatures. The seasonality of thermal contraction cracking and of the infill of frost cracks are generally related to winter and spring, respectively. Ice wedges are, thus, assumed to be indicative of winter climate conditions. The processes involved are most likely free of any fractionation during freezing. <b>Segregated</b> <b>ice</b> forms by the process of ice segregation (motion of ground water in the sediment column towards a freezing front). <b>Segregated</b> <b>ice</b> is rather a mixture of winter and summer precipitation, which additionally has undergone fractionation during freezing. One must bear in mind that ground water in permafrost regions is mostly related to the active layer (a sub meter to meter thick layer, which melts in summer and freezes in winter). A third type of ground ice, so called pore ice also known as ice cement, is also intrasedimental ice occurring in the pores of soils, which was formed in situ (without water migration towards a freezing front). This type of ice is typical for relatively coarse-grained sediment. Here, also ground water is the main water source. All these different types of ground ice have a different genetic background, which can be traced by stable isotope methods. This includes the type of water involved (e. g. summer vs. winter precipitation, with relevant isotopic composition) as well as the amount of fractionation occurring during phase transitions in the water cycle. Under favorable conditions (such as minimal fractionation during freezing) the stable isotope composition of these different types of ground ice can be used as paleo archive: (1) for the differentiation of stratigraphical units i. e. Holocene ground ice being generally 3 to 7 heavier in &# 948; 18 O than Pleistocene ground ice, (2) as centennial-scale climate archives for paleotemperature reconstruction as well as indication of (3) changing atmospheric moisture sources from climate-relevant d excess (d excess = &# 948;D- 8 *&# 948; 18 O) records.

For typical colloidal materials such as soils we show that the commonly-employed Clapeyron equation is not valid macroscopically at the interface between the ice lens and the surrounding porous medium owing to the viscous dynamics of flow in premelted films. This gives rise to an ‘interfacial resistance’ to flow towards the growing ice which causes a significant drop in predicted ice-growth (heave) rates and explains why many previous models predict ice-growth rates that are much larger than those seen in experiments. We derive an explicit formula for the ice-growth rate in a given porous medium, and show that this only depends on temperature and on the external pressures imposed on the freezing system. This growth-rate formula contains a material-specific function which can be calculated (with a knowledge of the of the geometry and material of the porous medium), but which is also readily experimentally-measurable. We apply the formula to plate-like particles, and obtain good agreement with previous experimental data.

Further study could prove that the three results are related. The scientific results of the Phoenix mission motivate a return to that site with a mission capable of drilling into the ice-cemented ground. To design a mission we must understand the engineering properties of the soil, salt, ice and rock environment. Hypothesis: It is possible that the presence of perchlorate salt (most likely magnesium perchlorate) at a high concentration caused the soil stickiness.

This phenomenon can be observed from {{the data obtained by}} measuring the temperature in the soil profile. In the present bachelor thesis, here are investigated sites of sorted patterned ground (Hincovo pleso, Lučné sedlo) and earth hummocks (Kopské sedlo) in the High Tatras {{for the purposes of the}} study regelation process. In addition to detailed description of the physical-geomorphological processes associated with phase changes of water in patterned groud, the main aim of the thesis is to set regelation cycles and their characteristics using different methods for determination of regelation on the basis of temperature measurements in patterned groug of the foregoing locations. The results indicate differences in regelation in the individual shapes within the locations, among the sites, but also between different types of patterned groud - [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Predicted {{changes in}} Arctic climate include {{decreased}} sea-ice extent, increased storm frequency, and sea-level rise. The western Canadian Arctic is highly sensitive to sea-level rise {{and climate change}} due to, high ground ice concentrations in unlithified sediments, increased storm effectiveness, decreased sea-ice extent, and high erosion rates. The southwest coast of Banks Island has similar climate conditions, substrates and ground ice contents. Publicized community concern about changing coastal conditions led to Sachs Harbour, NWT being chosen {{as one of the}} first coastal sites for detailed study as part of an ArcticNet project. [...] Sachs Harbour and the southwest coastline of Banks Island is dominated by low unlithified coastal bluffs containing <b>segregated</b> <b>ice</b> lenses and ice-rich silty sand horizons. Initial investigations identified three possible mechanisms for coastal erosion: wave activity and storm events, rising sea level and decreasing sea-ice extent, and increased thermal ablation coupled with regional submergence. [...] Thirty-one coastal surveys, nearshore bathymetric surveys, and sediment samples were used to determine present coastal processes and rates change. Suspended particulate matter before and after a precipitation event were used to determine the effectiveness of runoff. Aerial photographs and satellite images were used to determine historical change along the coastline and within the community. Sea ice and storm records were analysed from the 1950 s to present in order to determine the frequency of events and the associated sea-ice conditions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract We analyse {{the growth}} rate of <b>segregated</b> <b>ice</b> (ice lenses) in {{freezing}} porous media. For typical colloidal materials such as soils we show that the commonly employed Clapeyron equation is not valid macroscopically at the interface between the ice lens and the surrounding porous medium owing to the viscous dynamics of flow in premelted films. The flow in these films gives rise to an 'interfacial resistance' to flow towards the growing ice which causes a significant drop in predicted ice-growth (heave) rates. This explains why many previous models predict ice-growth rates that are much larger than those seen in experiments. We derive an explicit formula for the ice-growth rate in a given porous medium, and show that this only depends on temperature and on the external pressures imposed on the freezing system. This growth-rate formula contains a material-specific function which can be calculated (with knowledge of the geometry and material of the porous medium), but which is also readily experimentally measurable. We apply the formula to plate-like particles, and show that the results can be matched with previous experimental data. Finally we show how the interfacial resistance explains the observation that the maximum heave rate in soils occurs in medium-grained particles such as silts, while heave rates are smaller for fine-and coarse-grained particles. © 2012 Cambridge University Press...|$|R
40|$|Duvanny Yar is a stratigraphic key {{site for}} the late Quaternary in Western Beringia. It is {{characteristic}} for ice-rich permafrost sequences in north-east Siberia, known as of the Yedoma Suite (e. g. KAPLINA et al. 1978; Sher et al. 1979) and is an important reference {{site for the}} late Pleistocene history of Beringia (HOPKINS 1982). The aim of our study was to reconstruct the paleoenvironmental dynamics at the Duvanny Yar site during the late Quaternary using its terrestrial archive. A multidisciplinary approach using geocryological, geo-chronological, sedimentological, hydro-chemical, isotope geochemical, and paleoecological methods was applied to obtain multiproxy records. Sediment samples were analysed for ice contents, grain size parameters, biogeochemistry (total carbon, total organic carbon, total nitrogen, stable carbon isotopes), mineral density, mass specific magnetic susceptibility, and for radiocarbon age. Stable isotopes of water were measured for ground <b>ice</b> (<b>ice</b> wedges, <b>segregated</b> <b>ice,</b> and pore ice), modern surface waters and modern precipitation. Six profiles along the riverbank were sampled in August 2008. They contained Eemian lacustrine deposits, long sequences of Ice Complex deposits of the Late Pleistocene Yedoma, Holocene lacustrine and boggy deposits in thermokarst depressions. All profiles showed very bad sorted sediment of fine to coarse silt. A homogenous and polymodal grain size distribution for the ice rich (~ 30 to 60 wt %) Yedoma Suite revealed a polygenetic origin and disproves the pure arctic loess hypothesis for these deposits. Measurements of bulk density, ice content and total organic carbon content (TOC) enable for a relative TOC content in Ice Complex deposits at Duvanny Yar. The mean value of organic carbon at Duvanny Yar is 16 ± 11 kg/m³. Geochronological results based on 8 new AMS ages revealed that the Yedoma Suite was continuously formed {{from the end of}} the Middle Weichselian (~ 40000 years BP) and at least until the Late Glacial Maximum (~ 20000 years BP). Stable water isotopes measured in <b>ice</b> wedges, <b>segregated</b> <b>ice</b> and ice lenses were used to estimate paleotemperature changes. Isotopic signals revealed cold temperatures for the whole period with relative warm peaks in the Eemian and Holocene times. During Yedoma Suite formation the climate was stable and cold. A better understanding of the paleoenvironmental dynamics at Duvanny Yar may provide a basis for more reliable predictions of future reaction on global warming of organic-bearing ice-rich permafrost in Siberia which is considered as a potential greenhouse gas source permafrost (DUTTA et al. 2006; ZIMOV et al. 2006).

40|$|Massive {{ground ice}} bodies {{are seen in}} the Canadian Arctic. The origins and {{formation}} processes of the ice bodies remain in need of research. So, I am studying a massive ground ice body in Mackenzie Delta, N. W. T., Canada, {{on the basis of}} a hypothesis that it is a relict ice body of the Laurentide ice sheet. If so, a massive ground ice body should provide important information about oxygen isotopic composition of the Laurentide ice sheet. Dating of the ice body must supply an important key in clarifying its origin and formation processes. Radiocarbon dates of the sediments found in the core samples obtained throughout the massive ice body were first determined by accelerator mass spectrometry. The sediments taken from the core at depths around the midpoint and bottom of the ice body were dated at 14270 and 17070 years B. P., respectively. The dates of reworked till overlying the ice body and of twigs found in the till layer were > 23000 and < 10000 years B. P., respectively. Therefore the massive ice is considered to have been formed before 10000 years B. P. and, accordingly, to be not <b>segregated</b> <b>ice</b> origin but buried ice origin. On the other hand, oxygen isotopic composition and pollen content show a decreasing trend from the bottom to top of the ice body. Correlation between these trends and the determined dates indicates that the massive ice body was not formed in Mackenzie Delta but had moved from south of the delta before 10000 years B. P.; namely, it is a relict ice body of the Laurentide ice sheet...|$|R
40|$|Large {{parts of}} (sub-) Arctic Siberia, Alaska and the Yukon Territory {{are covered by}} ice-rich silts that are {{penetrated}} by large ice wedges, resulting from syngenetic sedimentation and freezing. Accompanied by wedge-ice growth, the sedimentation process was driven by cold continental climatic and environmental conditions in unglaciated regions during the late Pleistocene (Schirrmeister et al. 2013) inducing the accumulation of the unique Yedoma deposits up to 50 m thick. Because of fast incorporation of organic material into permafrost during sedimentation, Yedoma deposits are supposed to include low-degraded organic matter. Moreover, ice-rich permafrost deposits like Yedoma are especially prone to degradation triggered by climate changes or human activity. When Yedoma deposits degrade, large amounts of sequestered carbon {{as well as other}} nutrients are released to the geosystem, which is of global significance for the climate system. In particular, several new estimates have emerged for carbon that accumulated in yedoma deposits in Siberia and Alaska. The current estimates range from 83 ± 12 (Strauss et al. 2013) to 129 ± 30 Pg (Walther et al. 2014) for organic carbon in Yedoma deposits. The yedoma region, including degraded Yedoma deposits and Holocene accumulation, is now thought to contain between 213 ± 41 Pg carbon (Strauss et al. 2013) and 456 ± 45 Pg frozen carbon (Walter Anthony et al. 2014), still supporting earlier accounts of several hundred billion tons of carbon stored deep in the permafrost, even when recalculated with new observations. The major uncertainties for estimating the Yedoma carbon stock that remain are (1) Yedoma coverage, (2) Yedoma thickness, and (3) Yedoma ground <b>ice</b> (wedge and <b>segregated</b> <b>ice)</b> content...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{the study}} of rock glaciers has {{increased}} remarkably. Substantive progress has been made, particularly in understanding the formation of rock glaciers that have developed adjacent to existing or former valley or cirque glaciers, However, our understanding of valley-wall rock glaciers that are located {{at the base of}} talus slopes remains scant. Published work exhibits little consensus on the formation of valley-wall rock glaciers and several hypotheses remain under vigorous debate. The major objective of the research reported in this thesis has been to test the generality and feasibility of seven major models of valley-wall rock glacier formation using both empirical and theoretical evidence. The primary conclusion is that only one of these models, the segregation ice model, emerges as a general model of valley-wall rock glacier genesis. The model assumes that a thin layer or several thin layers of <b>segregated</b> <b>ice</b> are overlain by interstitially frozen sediments and an unfrozen mantle of coarse debris. A wide range of empirical and theoretical findings are shown to be consistent with the implications of the segregation ice model. Detailed observations on the morphology, sedimentology and distribution of active, inactive and relict valley-wall rock glaciers studied in Switzerland, northern Norway and Scotland provided a range of findings that support this model. Theoretical evidence was obtained by modelling a number of different density models that reflect different distribution of internal ice by applying a simple laminar flow equation to field measurements. Although only the segregation ice model appears to be valid at a general level, the possibility cannot be excluded of alternative modes of valley-wall rock glacier formation under particular circumstances. Snow avalanching, deformation of snowbank or matrix ice, and basal sliding under conditions of high hydrostatic pressure all constitute possible contributing mechanisms of formation and movement in particular cases...|$|R
40|$|In wide {{areas of}} Northern Siberia, glaciers have been absent since the Late Pleistocene. Therefore, ground ice and {{especially}} ice wedges {{are used as}} archives for paleoclimatic studies. In the present study, carried out on the Bykovsky Peninsula, eastern Lena Delta, {{we were able to}} distinguish ice wedges of different genetic units by means of oxygen and hydrogen isotopes. The results obtained by this study on the Ice Complex, a peculiar periglacial phenomenon, allowed the reconstruction of the climate history with a subdivision of a period of very cold winters (60 - 55 ka), followed by a long stable period of cold winter temperatures (50 - 24 ka), Between 20 ka and 11 ka, climate warming is indicated in stable isotope compositions, most probably after the Late Glacial Maximum. At that time, a change of the marine source of the precipitation from a more humid source to the present North AtIantic source region was assumed. For the Ice Complex, a continuous age-height relationship was established, indicating syngenetic vertical ice wedge growth and sediment accumulation rates of 0. 7 m/ky. During the Holocene optimum, ice wedge growth was probably limited due to the extensive formation of lacustrine environments. Holocene ice wedges in thermokarst depressions (alases) and thermoerosional valleys (logs) were formed after climate deterioration from about 4. 5 ka until the present. Winter temperatures were warmer at this time as compared to the cooler Pleistocene. Migration of bound water between <b>ice</b> wedges and <b>segregated</b> <b>ice</b> may have altered the isotopic composition of old ice wedges. The presence of ice wedges as diagnostic features for permafrost conditions since 60 ka, implies that a large glacier extending over the Laptev Sea shelf did not exist. For the remote non-glaciated areas of Northern Siberia, ice wedges were established as a powerful climate archive...|$|R
