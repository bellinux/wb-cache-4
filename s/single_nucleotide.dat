5|$|During the 1990s, the {{identification}} of newly discovered genes and new techniques for DNA sequencing led to {{the appearance of a}} distinct field of molecular and genomic laboratory medicine; in 1995, the Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP) was formed to give it structure. In 1999, the AMP co-founded The Journal of Medical Diagnostics. Informa Healthcare launched Expert Reviews in Medical Diagnostics in 2001. From 2002 onwards, the HapMap Project aggregated information on the one-letter genetic differences that recur in the human populationthe <b>single</b> <b>nucleotide</b> polymorphismsand their relationship with disease.

40|$|Changes in DNA {{methylation}} {{have been}} found in the large majority of tumors. This phenomenon includes both genome-wide hypomethylation and gene- specific hypermethylation. However, the clinical relevance of either mechanism has remained contentious. In order to determine DNA methylation levels from a large number of clinical samples, we have established a method for accurate high-throughput quantification of 5 -methylcytosine in genomic DNA. Our protocol requires a small amount (< 1 µg) of DNA that is enzymatically hydrolyzed to <b>single</b> <b>nucleotides.</b> <b>Single</b> <b>nucleotides</b> are then derivatized with a fluorescent marker and separated by capillary electrophoresis. After calibration of the method, we have determined cytosine methylation levels from tumor samples of 81 patients that had been diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). These patients showed a high variability in their methylation levels with a general trend towards hypomethylation. Because of its high accuracy and throughput our method will be useful in determining the role of genomic DNA methylation levels in tumorigenesis...|$|R
5|$|Some of a patient's <b>single</b> <b>nucleotide</b> polymorphismsslight {{differences}} in their DNAcan help predict how quickly they will metabolise particular drugs; this is called pharmacogenomics. For example, the enzyme CYP2C19 metabolises several drugs, such as the anti-clotting agent Clopidogrel, into their active forms. Some patients possess polymorphisms in specific places on the 2C19 gene that make poor metabolisers of those drugs; physicians can test for these polymorphisms and {{find out whether the}} drugs will be fully effective for that patient. Advances in molecular biology have helped show that some syndromes that were previously classed as a single disease are actually multiple subtypes with entirely different causes and treatments. Molecular diagnostics can help diagnose the subtypefor example of infections and cancersor the genetic analysis of a disease with an inherited component, such as Silver-Russell syndrome.|$|E

These are computational techniques, and are in contrast to special experimental methods based on known population-wide <b>single</b> <b>nucleotide</b> polymorphisms (see SNP genotyping). Due to the increasing abundance of NGS data, these techniques are becoming increasingly popular for performing SNP genotyping, {{with a wide variety of}} algorithms designed for specific experimental designs and applications. In addition to the usual application domain of SNP genotyping, these techniques have been successfully adapted to identify rare SNPs within a population, as well as detecting somatic SNVs within an individual using multiple tissue samples.|$|E

30|$|To treat more {{complicated}} (general) loop–loop kissing complexes, {{as shown in}} the Fig.  2 of Cao et al. (2014), the stem-loop substructure’s impact on loop entropy is approximated by replacing the terminal base pairs (of the stems) by <b>single</b> <b>nucleotides.</b> Then, the effective loop lengths of l 1, l 2, l 3, and l 4 are equal to the sum of the number of unpaired nucleotides and the number of stem-loop substructures. This approximation ignores the (weak) excluded volume interference between the stem-loop substructure and the loop, thus enabling us to treat general kissing motifs.|$|R
40|$|We {{simulate}} molecular transport in elongated hydrothermal pore systems {{influenced by}} a thermal gradient. We find extreme accumulation of molecules {{in a wide variety}} of plugged pores. The mechanism is able to provide highly concentrated <b>single</b> <b>nucleotides,</b> suitable for operations of an RNA world at the origin of life. It is driven solely by the thermal gradient across a pore. On the one hand, the fluid is shuttled by thermal convection along the pore, whereas on the other hand, the molecules drift across the pore, driven by thermodiffusion. As a result, millimeter-sized pores accumulate even <b>single</b> <b>nucleotides</b> more than 108 -fold into micrometer-sized regions. The enhanced concentration of molecules is found in the bulk water near the closed bottom end of the pore. Because the accumulation depends exponentially on the pore length and temperature difference, it is considerably robust with respect to changes in the cleft geometry and the molecular dimensions. Whereas thin pores can concentrate only long polynucleotides, thicker pores accumulate short and long polynucleotides equally well and allow various molecular compositions. This setting also provides a temperature oscillation, shown previously to exponentially replicate DNA in the protein-assisted PCR. Our results indicate that, for life to evolve, complicated active membrane transport is not required for the initial steps. We find that interlinked mineral pores in a thermal gradient provide a compelling high-concentration starting point for the molecular evolution of life...|$|R

On the other hand, CRISPR relies on ribonucleotide complex formation instead of protein/DNA recognition. gRNAs can target nearly any sequence in the genome and they can be cheaply produced, thus making CRISPR more efficient and less expensive than both TALEN and ZFN. TALEN is ultimately 200 times more expensive than CRISPR and takes several months more to perform.|$|R

25|$|Missense {{mutations}} or nonsynonymous mutations are {{types of}} point mutations where a <b>single</b> <b>nucleotide</b> is changed to cause substitution {{of a different}} amino acid.

50|$|Another group {{suggests}} that primitive cells might have formed inside inorganic clay microcompartments, which {{can provide an}} ideal container for the synthesis and compartmentalization of complex organic molecules. Clay-armored bubbles form naturally when particles of montmorillonite clay collect on the outer surface of air bubbles under water. This creates a semi permeable vesicle from materials that are readily available in the environment. The authors remark that montmorillonite is known {{to serve as a}} chemical catalyst, encouraging lipids to form membranes and <b>single</b> <b>nucleotides</b> to join into strands of RNA. Primitive reproduction can be envisioned when the clay bubbles burst, releasing the lipid membrane-bound product into the surrounding medium.|$|R

25|$|One {{human genome}} was sequenced in full in 2003, and {{currently}} efforts {{are being made}} to achieve {{a sample of the}} genetic diversity of the species (see International HapMap Project). By present estimates, humans have approximately 22,000 genes. The variation in human DNA is very small compared to other species, possibly suggesting a population bottleneck during the Late Pleistocene (around 100,000 years ago), in which the human population was reduced to a small number of breeding pairs. Nucleotide diversity is based on single mutations called <b>single</b> <b>nucleotide</b> polymorphisms (SNPs). The nucleotide diversity between humans is about 0.1%, i.e. 1 difference per 1,000 base pairs. A difference of 1 in 1,000 nucleotides between two humans chosen at random amounts to about 3 million nucleotide differences, since the human genome has about 3 billion nucleotides. Most of these <b>single</b> <b>nucleotide</b> polymorphisms (SNPs) are neutral but some (about 3 to 5%) are functional and influence phenotypic differences between humans through alleles.|$|E

40|$|DNA {{sequencing}} {{using an}} array of nanometer-sized pores (nanopores) offer an exciting option for thirdgeneration sequencing, which will allow faster and cheaper sequencing with minimal sample pre-processing. When a voltage is applied through a nanopore in a conducting fluid, a slight electric current is observed, the strength of which depends {{on the structure of}} the nanopore. When a DNA molecule passed through a nanopore, with an applied voltage, the current detected through the nanopore will differ for each base due to their differential effect on the structure of nanopore.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the effects of {{structure}} on nucleic acid heteroduplex formation by analyzing hybridization of tRNAphe to {{a complete set of}} complementary oligonucleotides, ranging from <b>single</b> <b>nucleotides</b> to dodecanucleotides. The analysis points to features in tRNA that determine heteroduplex yield. All heteroduplexes that give high yield include both double-stranded stems as well as single-stranded regions. Bases in the single-stranded regions are stacked onto the stems, and heteroduplexes terminate at potential interfaces for coaxial stacking. Heteroduplex formation is disfavored by sharp turns or a lack of helical order in single-stranded regions, competition from bases displaced from a stem, and stable tertiary interactions. The study is relevant to duplex formation on oligonucleotide microarrays and to antisense technologies...|$|R
