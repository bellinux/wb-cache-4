25|$|Tropical Discovery {{was opened}} in 1993. The {{building}} explores several tropical environments and displays mammals, reptiles, fish, amphibians and insects from these areas. The trip {{begins with a}} view into a South American river with different species of freshwater stingray then continues to a cave where guests are immersed within the community of several bat species including the vampire bat. A snake exhibit hidden inside a Mayan temple features several venomous species including the king cobra and eyelash viper. Other South American animals here include capybara, black howler monkey, arapaima, piranha and poison dart frog. Further on, visitors are immersed in a coral reef with epaulette sharks, clownfish, yellow tang, lionfish and garden eels. Around the corner, a gallery of North American snakes is located across from alligator snapping turtle and other North American reptiles and fish in a large pool. Further on, <b>Siamese</b> <b>crocodile</b> lurk in their pool amongst other swamp species like mata mata. The Komodo dragon exhibit was the largest of its kind at opening and {{is still one of}} the largest Komodo dragon exhibits in the country.|$|E
25|$|The {{population}} is sporadic in Indonesia the Philippines and Malaysia, with some areas harbouring large populations (Borneo and Sumatra, for example) {{and others with}} very small, at-risk populations (e.g., Peninsular Malaysia). Despite the {{close proximity to the}} crocodile hotbed of northern Australia, crocodiles no longer exist in Bali. This species is also reportedly extinct on Lombok, Komodo, and most of Java. In the southern Malaysian Peninsula as well as Borneo, salwater crocodiles may co-exist with the relatively narrow-snouted false gharial (as well as on Sumatra) and the closely related but usually smaller <b>Siamese</b> <b>crocodile</b> (as well as in Java). A small population may remain within Ujung Kulon National Park in western Java. The saltwater crocodile is also present in very limited parts of the South Pacific, with an average population in the Solomon Islands, a very small and soon-to-be-extinct population in Vanuatu (where the population officially stands at only three) and a decent but at-risk population (which may be rebounding) in Palau. They once ranged as far west as the east coast of Africa to the Seychelles Islands. These crocodiles were once believed to be a population of Nile crocodiles, but they were later proven to be C. porosus.|$|E
500|$|The New Guinea {{crocodile}} {{grows to}} {{a length of}} up to [...] for males and [...] for females, although most specimens are smaller. The body ranges from grey to brown in colour, with darker bandings on the tail and body which become less noticeable as the animal grows. Longitudinal ridges {{in front of the}} eyes and some granular scales {{on the back of the}} neck between four large scales are distinctive features of this species. There are some differences between the northerly and southerly populations in the morphology of the skull and the arrangement of the scales. The snout is pointed and relatively narrow during juvenile stages and becomes wider as the animal matures. The New Guinea crocodile bears a physical similarity to the nearby Philippine crocodile (C. mindorensis) and <b>Siamese</b> <b>crocodile</b> (C. siamensis). The colouring is similar to that of the freshwater crocodile (Crocodylus johnsoni) of northern Australia, but the snout is somewhat shorter and broader.|$|E
50|$|<b>Siamese</b> <b>crocodiles</b> {{occur in}} a wide range of {{freshwater}} habitats, including slow-moving rivers and streams, lakes, seasonal oxbow lakes, marshes and swamplands.|$|R
50|$|In Cambodia Fauna and Flora International and the Government of Cambodia's Forestry Administration have {{established}} the Cambodian Crocodile Conservation Programme {{for the protection}} and recovery of <b>Siamese</b> <b>crocodiles.</b> This programme works with a network of indigenous villages who are helping to protect key sites such as Veal Veng Marsh (Veal Veng District), the Tatai River (Thmar Bang District) and the Araeng River. The latter is considered to have the second largest population of <b>Siamese</b> <b>crocodiles</b> in the world, but is currently threatened by the proposed construction of a massive dam in the river. During the heavy monsoon period of June-November, <b>Siamese</b> <b>crocodiles</b> {{take advantage of the}} increase in water levels {{to move out of the}} river and onto large lakes and other local bodies of water, returning to their original habitat once water levels start receding back to their usual levels.|$|R
50|$|In 1992, it was {{believed}} to be extremely close to or fully extinct in the wild until 2000 when scientists from Fauna and Flora International and the Government of Cambodia's Forestry Administration confirmed the presence of <b>Siamese</b> <b>crocodiles</b> in the Cardamom Mountains in Southwest Cambodia. Since then, surveys have identified around 30 sites in Cambodia that contain wild <b>Siamese</b> <b>crocodiles</b> (conservatively estimated to number between 200 and 400 individuals in total), a tiny population in Thailand (possibly as few as two individuals, discounting recent reintroductions), a small population in Vietnam (possibly fewer than 100 individuals), Cat Tien National Park has about 200, and a more sizeable population in Laos. In March 2005, conservationists found a nest containing juvenile <b>Siamese</b> <b>crocodiles</b> in the southern Lao province of Savannakhet. There are no recent records from Malaysia, Burma or Brunei. A small but important population of the crocodiles is also known to live in East Kalimantan, Indonesia.|$|R

2500|$|Crocodiles are {{protected}} {{in many parts}} of the world, but they also are farmed commercially. Their hides are tanned and used to make leather goods such as shoes and handbags; crocodile meat is also considered a delicacy. The most commonly farmed species are the saltwater and Nile crocodiles, while a hybrid of the saltwater and the rare <b>Siamese</b> <b>crocodile</b> is also bred in Asian farms. Farming has resulted in an increase in the saltwater crocodile population in Australia, as eggs are usually harvested from the wild, so landowners have an incentive to conserve their habitat. Crocodile leather can be made into goods such as wallets, briefcases, purses, handbags, belts, hats, and shoes. Crocodile oil has been used for various purposes. Crocodiles were eaten by Vietnamese while they were taboo and off limits for Chinese. Vietnamese women who married Chinese men adopted the Chinese taboo. Crocodile meat is occasionally eaten as an [...] "exotic" [...] delicacy in the western world.|$|E
2500|$|The bank {{is home to}} 14 {{species of}} the 23 crocodilian species living across the world, {{two of which are}} listed by the IUCN as {{critically}} endangered and three more as threatened. The 14 crocodile species available in the bank are mugger (Crocodylus palustris), salt-water crocodile (Crocodylus porosus), gharial (Gavialis gangeticus), tomistoma (Tomistoma schlegelii), American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), Morelet's crocodile (Crocodylus Moreletii), spectacled caiman (Caiman crocodilus), West African dwarf crocodile (Osteolaemus tetraspis), Australian fresh water crocodile (Crocodylus Johnsoni), African slender-snouted crocodile (Mecistops cataphractus), dwarf caiman (Paleosuchus palpebrosus), yacare caiman (Caiman yacare), Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) and the endangered <b>Siamese</b> <b>crocodile</b> (Crocodylus siamensis). The bank currently houses over 2,400 crocodiles and also many species of turtles, snakes, and lizards which are viewable by the public. The bank houses 12 endangered species of turtles and tortoises and 5 species of snakes, including king cobra (Ophiophagus hannah), Asian water monitors (Varanus salvator salvator), two species of pythons, and albino cobras. Of the 5,000 reptiles bred at the bank, 3,000 represent the native Indian species Crocodylus palustris, known as muggers. One of the biggest attractions of the park is a fierce salt-water crocodile known as Jaws III. This species, believed to be the biggest in southern Asia, is [...] long and weighs over a ton. The bank is also going to get four new species of crocodiles. These are black caimans, smooth-fronted caimans, Cuban crocodiles and broad-snouted caimans. Anacondas will also appear at the bank. Since April, 2016 four Komodo dragons - three male, one female - {{have been added to the}} list of exhibits. The dragons were acquired from Bronx Zoo in New York.|$|E
50|$|Experimental {{inoculation}} of American alligators (Alligator mississippienis), <b>Siamese</b> <b>crocodiles</b> (Crocdylus siamensis), and broad-nosed caimans (Caiman latirostris) with M. alligatoris yielded {{growth of}} the bacteria in all species tested. However, the infected <b>Siamese</b> <b>crocodiles</b> showed no symptoms of disease as seen in alligators and caimans. The commensal relationship observed between M. alligatoris and C. siamensis suggests the crocodilian as a potential natural reservoir for M. alligatoris. The transmission of M. alligatoris is unknown, but due to its presence in captive alligators, researchers warn against returning captive alligators to their natural habitats, fearing these animals may function as a vector for infecting wild populations.|$|R
50|$|Survey and {{protection}} of <b>Siamese</b> <b>crocodiles</b> in Indonesia: Verification {{of the presence of}} C. siamensis in Kalimantan and Java is a first step to developing protection for the species {{within the context of the}} developing crocodile management strategy in Indonesia.|$|R

50|$|The Hippo Building {{was located}} where the Conservation Carousel is today. It {{was built in}} the mid-1970s. The {{building}} was home to one male hippo named Moe. Moe had a 30,000-gallon pool. Moe shared the building with a breeding pair of black-footed penguins. On the outside of the building there were exhibits for the zoo's <b>Siamese</b> <b>crocodiles,</b> Hillary and Bill. The crocodiles were moved to the Small Animal Building in 2003. Moe moved to the Rio Grande Zoo in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The Hippo Building was torn down a couple years later for the construction of the new carousel.|$|R
50|$|The lake {{is home to}} {{at least}} 149 species of fish, eleven {{globally}} threatened species, and six near-threatened species. These threatened and near-threatened species include the spot-billed pelican, greater adjutant, Bengal florican, Oriental darter, grey-headed fish eagle, and the Manchurian reed warbler. Specifically, the large colonies of unique birds constitute the Preak Toal Bird sanctuary. In addition, the Tonlé sap also supports significant reptile populations including nearly extinct <b>Siamese</b> <b>crocodiles</b> {{and a large number}} of freshwater snakes. Although the area around the lake has been modified for settlement and farming, about 200 species of plants have been recorded.|$|R
