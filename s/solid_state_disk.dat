40|$|Abstract. Although {{hard disk}} drives have been popular over several decades, there still exists the {{deficiency}} {{because of their}} slow speeds and high power consumptions. By contrast, flash-based <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>disks</b> exhibit good performance and low power consumption. However, the limited lifetimes become a fatal flaw of <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>disks.</b> In order {{to take full advantage}} of hard <b>disk</b> drives and <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>disks,</b> we design a hybrid storage system to make them work in a complementary manner. Further, we propose a data placement scheme for this system to determine the data placement on the underlying <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>disks</b> or hard disk drives based on the data access statistics. Experiment results show that the lifetime of <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>disks</b> and the response time of the system can be significantly improved compared with the alone storage media. I...|$|R

Checkpointing frequency and restart delay crucially depend on data throughput and access performance of the storage medium. In this paper we discuss the opportunity to achieve subsecond checkpointing frequencies and restart delays by substituting magnetic hard <b>disk</b> storage with <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>disks</b> and adapting the access algorithms and storage patterns to the novel constraints imposed by <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>disks.</b> I...|$|R

50|$|These {{small and}} rugged PC/104 systems often require small non {{volatile}} storage devices. Popular storage devices include Compact Flash {{as well as}} <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>disk</b> (SSD) devices.

40|$|Abstract—Flash <b>Solid</b> <b>State</b> <b>Disks</b> {{induce a}} drastic change in storage {{technology}} that impacts database systems. Flash memories exhibit low latency (especially for small block sizes), very high random read and low random write throughput, and significant asymmetry between the {{read and write}} performance. These properties influence the performance of database join algorithms and ultimately the cost assumptions in the query optimizer. In this paper we examine the performance of different join algorithms available in PostgreSQL on SSD and magnetic drives. We observe that (a) point queries exhibit the best performance improvement of up to fifty times; (b) range queries benefit less from the properties of SSDs; (c) join algorithms behave differently depending on how well they match the properties of <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>disks</b> or magnetic drives...|$|R

30|$|Each “Hard Disk” has the {{following}} different energy-related attributes: rpm indicates the rotation per {{minute of the}} disk, platters denotes the number of platters, whereas AAM presents whether the hard disk is equipped with Automatic Acoustic Adjustment feature. For the “Solid State Disk”, powerByRead and powerByWrite denote respectively the power consumed by read and write operations.

50|$|Compared to {{ordinary}} desktop computers, nettops {{are not only}} smaller and cheaper, but they also consume much less power.

Some {{do not have an}} optical disk drive and use a <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>disk,</b> making them completely silent. The tradeoff is that the hardware specifications and processing power are usually reduced and hence make nettops less appropriate for running complex or resource-intensive applications.|$|E

50|$|Amplidata has {{developed}} a Distributed Storage System (DSS) technology designed to solve the scalability and reliability problems traditional storage systems face, {{by taking advantage of}} the introduction of large capacity SATA drives and <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>disk.</b> By storing data across a selection of disks that are widely distributed across storage nodes, racks and sites, the DSS architecture spreads the risk of hardware failure to ensure that a failure of a component such as a disk, storage node or even a full rack has no impact on data availability and a minimal impact on data redundancy. The entire system is permanently monitored and data integrity is constantly checked. As a result, bit errors on disks are proactively healed before they become an issue to the user.|$|E
40|$|<b>Solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>disks</b> (SSDs) {{provide much}} faster random {{access to data}} {{compared}} to conventional hard disk drives. Therefore, the response time of a database engine could be improved by moving the objects that are frequently accessed in a random fashion to the SSD. Considering the price and limited storage capacity of <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>disks,</b> the database administrator needs to determine which objects (tables, indexes, materialized views, etc.), if placed on the SSD, would most improve {{the performance of the}} system. In this paper we propose a tool called “Object Placement Advisor ” for making a wise decision for the object placement problem. By collecting profile inputs from workload runs, the advisor utility provides a list of objects to be placed on the SSD by applying heuristics like the greedy knapsack technique or dynamic programming. To show that the proposed approach is effective in conventional database management systems, we have conducted experiments on IBM DB 2 with queries and schemas based on the TPC-H and TPC-C benchmarks. The results indicate that using a relatively small amount of SSD storage, the response time of the system can be reduced significantly by considering the recommendation of the advisor. 1...|$|R

40|$|File {{systems for}} flash devices {{have been in}} demand since this storage has become {{attractive}} for general purpose usage. The technology is now widespread. Flash based storage devices exist since the mid 80 ’s [15] and have long been known exclusively for their use in storing small data like PC BIOSes and the firmware of embedded devices. In these cases the flash chip’s content has been memory mapped almost always into a processors adress space and treated as a read-only area during normal usage. Nowadays flash is also used for dedicated read-write operation since the maximum capacity of this technology has seen a huge increase in size and thus opened it {{to be used in}} many different areas like USB drives, a larger read-writeable area for embedded devices and eventually <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>disks</b> (SSDs). However, pure flash storage behaves very different in comparison to normal rotating- disk block devices. Average seek times are several magnitudes better than with common hard disks. There are also a number of drawbacks, for which two approaches to solve them exist: A translation layer to make the memory behave like a normal block device and special file systems. Those file systems and also the changes to traditional file systems for use with flash based <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>disks</b> (SSDs) shall be discussed in this paper. 1...|$|R
5000|$|The biggest knock against NLTSS {{during its}} {{production}} lifetime was performance. The one performance issue that affected users most was file access latency. This generally wasn't {{a significant problem}} for disk I/O, but the systems that NLTSS ran on also supported a significant complement of very low latency solid state disks with access times under 10 microseconds. The initial latencies for file operations under NLTSS were comparable to the latency for <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>disk</b> access and {{significantly higher than the}} LTSS latency for such access. To improve file access latency under NLTSS the implementation was changed significantly to put the most latency sensitive processes (in particular the file server) [...] "in the kernel". This effort wasn't as significant as it might at first sound as all NLTSS servers worked on a multithreading model. What this change really amounted to was to move the threads responsible for file server services from a separate file server process into the kernel [...] "process". Communication to users was unchanged (still through buffer tables, LINCS tokens, etc.), but file operations avoided some significant context changes that were the primary cause of the higher latencies over what the older LTSS and the competing Cray Time Sharing System provided. This change did significantly (~3x) improve the latency of file I/O operations, but it also meant that the file server became a trusted part of the kernel (by implementation, not by design).|$|E
