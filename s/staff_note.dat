40|$|Homelessness is a {{pressing}} social issue, {{and people who}} are homeless, in particular those who sleep rough, often experience a confluence of physical and mental health issues. Health problems experienced by homeless people can be more severe than those experienced by domiciled people. Such problems can contribute to homelessness, and be exacerbated by homelessness. Previous research has found that for various reasons, primary healthcare services can be inaccessible for homeless populations. More recent research explores the growing availability of accessible, non-threatening health services targeting homeless people, with humanistic approaches to care. This thesis draws on a case study of an NGO clinic providing population-based primary healthcare to homeless and low-income people. The case study is informed by the perspectives of two groups of participants; homeless clinic patients and clinic staff. Ten semi-structured interviews were conducted with homeless clients, and six semi-structured interviews were undertaken with clinic personnel. Social representations theory informs the interpretation, analysis and discussion of the participants' conceptualisations of health and wellbeing, illness and disease, homelessness, health services and the NGO clinic. Social representations from both participant groups (micro perspectives) inform shared social representations (macro perspectives) of the NGO clinic. This determines whether participants conceptualise the clinic as an 'ideal' health service for homeless people. NGO clinic staff responses reveal that clinic staff have a personal and professional ethos to work with people in need and those that may have been stigmatised from society. This shared ethos has shaped the development of the NGO clinic, into its current structure of a holistic, population based primary healthcare for homeless people integrated within a wider social service structure. In this setting, relationships are developed between practitioners and homeless clients to ensure homeless patients healthcare needs are met. Also, practical needs are met as the clinic provides low-cost healthcare to homeless people within the context of an umbrella organisation that provides other much-needed social services. Collaboration is an important component to the efficacy of the NGO clinic, and meeting patient needs. However, clinic <b>staff</b> <b>note</b> that there are many dilemmas in providing healthcare to homeless people, and they can struggle to provide the service according to their vision, due to funding constraints. Nonetheless, NGO clinic personnel are committed to working with their patients, and find their jobs rewarding. The responses from homeless clinic patients brought to mind a military metaphor, which was utilised to anchor the experiences of homeless people in a familiar concept - the military. Each homeless client that was interviewed at the NGO clinic is written about {{in the form of a}} health biography, which summarises current health issues, health histories, health related practices and conceptualisations of health. The severity of three major health issues experienced by the participants - addictions, mental health issues and foot problems - are then explored in terms of detailed perspectives from homeless participants, and clinic personnel conceptualisations of those particular health issues. Social networks are discussed as important to homeless people's health and wellbeing, particularly through resource and information sharing. The clinic setting is conceptualised by homeless participants as a caring, welcoming environment; which contrasts with some negative experiences reported by homeless participants in other health service settings. This thesis explores the NGO clinic as a unique model for a health service that meets the various healthcare needs of homeless people. There is a need for more recognition from government organisations and policy makers of the impoverished life situations that many homeless people find themselves in - often without minimum standards of living, which jeopardises their ability to take care of their health. Appropriate health services need to be accessible to homeless people, in order for healthcare needs to be met...|$|E
40|$|The Brimbank Young Men’s Project {{has been}} a two year pilot {{initiative}} of the Centre for Multicultural Youth (CMY), funded by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC). The project has targeted young men of African backgrounds who are: disengaged (or {{at high risk of}} being disengaged) from education, training and employment; have had contact with the police; and are experiencing other difficulties with settlement. Geographical perimeters of the project were defined as Brimbank LGA “and surrounds”. The project has drawn on multiple partnerships within North-western region youth and welfare sectors, notably the Victoria Police Multicultural Liaison Centre.   Findings Interviews with program staff and stakeholders indicate that a number of themes and issues highlighted by the Literature have been replicated in the settlement experiences of the program’s target population. For instance, they cite frustration with the education system as a key determinant of young men from refugee backgrounds becoming disengaged from education, training and employment. Other factors can include (a) a clash between the young person’s aspirations and the reality of life, education and opportunity in Australia; (b) the young person’s level of education prior to arrival; and (c) the refugee community’s tendency to highly value success at school and sometimes assume this guarantees access to university and success in a white collar (higher status) job. In identifying determinants that lead to young men becoming disconnected from family and community, interviewees (a) highlighted instances of familial role-reversal within the target group for whom home and the wider community sometimes seem to exist in separate worlds; (b) recognised that the long-term impact of the refugee experience can adversely affect individuals’ capacity to parent. Youth frustration can be compounded by intergenerational conflicts such as pressure to maintain traditional cultural mores or achieve educationally versus peer pressure to conform to the new environment. Tensions between a young man and family typically reach crisis point at age 16 when Centrelink provides him with Youth Allowance (paid directly to the young person). In terms of education, training and employment, interviewees highlighted challenges faced by young men in regard to contextual factors (specifically, racial, ethnic or religious discrimination), blocked economic opportunities within the labour market, alcohol and substance abuse, lack of an established African community able to supply employment or rehabilitation options in Australia, inadequate or inaccessible information - both before and after arrival, the complexity of the service system, accommodation problems, resistance to counselling, etc, etc. Above all, program staff cites lack of trust/hope as the primary barrier to be surmounted by young men who feel (a) that the system has let them down, (b) that nobody cares; and (c) that there are few positives available to them within either their own or the larger community. As regards barriers to re-engagement with family and community, <b>staff</b> <b>note</b> that some of the young men have been identified by their community as trouble-makers and have been rejected by more than just parents. In some cases, the relationship is so damaged that the young men are unable to contact family members. Even so, a number of young men have expressed a strong desire to reconnect with family/community, and that this desire is reportedly quite common after three or four years away from home. Staff cites personal contact and help with service access as important strategies in reconnecting young men to education or employment while there is general recognition in the literature that the best means of combating barriers to acculturation and/or reconnection come from strong families and supportive co-ethnic communities. In this regard, interviewees cite the strategic value of engaging and talking with community elders and taking advantage of their willingness to attend project meetings...|$|E
