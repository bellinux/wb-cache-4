50|$|The SOS {{response}} is {{the changes in}} gene expression in Escherichia coli and other bacteria in response to extensive DNA damage. The prokaryotic <b>SOS</b> <b>system</b> is regulated by two key proteins: LexA and RecA. The LexA homodimer is a transcriptional repressor that binds to operator sequences {{commonly referred to as}} SOS boxes. In Escherichia coli it is known that LexA regulates transcription of approximately 48 genes including the lexA and recA genes. The SOS {{response is}} known to be widespread in the Bacteria domain, but it is mostly absent in some bacterial phyla, like the Spirochetes.The most common cellular signals activating the SOS response are regions of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), arising from stalled replication forks or double-strand breaks, which are processed by DNA helicase to separate the two DNA strands. In the initiation step, RecA protein binds to ssDNA in an ATP hydrolysis driven reaction creating RecA-ssDNA filaments. RecA-ssDNA filaments activate LexA autoprotease activity, which ultimately leads to cleavage of LexA dimer and subsequent LexA degradation. The loss of LexA repressor induces transcription of the SOS genes and allows for further signal induction, inhibition of cell division and an increase in levels of proteins responsible for damage processing.|$|E

In this approach, the location-based concept is built into the activity log for producing the description logic (DL) rules. The relationship between activities in the same location is investigated for making the result of activity recognition more accurately.

40|$|Genetic and {{biochemical}} {{studies on}} enzymes {{known to be}} involved in regulating DNA supercoiling yield a complex spectrum of effects on the Escherichia coli <b>SOS</b> <b>system.</b> Previous studies indicated that only inhibition of DNA gyrase by antibiotics that act on the DNA gyrase A subunit results in turning on the E. coli <b>SOS</b> <b>system.</b> Here we show that coumermycin, an antibiotic that acts on the DNA gyrase B subunit, can also induce. Like nalidixic acid induction, coumermycin induction is dependent on the recBC DNase. In both cases induction apparently results from a response of the cell to the DNA gyrase-inhibitor complex rather than just the loss of DNA gyrase activity. However, unlike induction by the DNA gyrase A-specific antibiotics, coumermycin induction also requires the recF gene product. This demonstrates a functional relationship between DNA gyrase and the recF gene product...|$|E
