5|$|Curtis Brumfield (Windell Middlebrooks) and Ethan Gross (Geoffrey Arend) {{begin to}} believe that Noah is being held by fresh water, so the search is narrowed. Bud is also cleared of {{voluntary}} manslaughter, and him, Curtis, Megan and Kate Murphy (Jeri Ryan) suspect that the kidnapping may be an inside job, meaning that <b>someone</b> <b>close</b> to Noah kidnapped him. Bud checks his parents, Tom (Stephen Barker Turner) and Jennifer (Keira Naughton) {{but they are not}} the culprits. They then find that Helen's friend, Jason's girlfriend, Rena Talbot (Wrenn Schmidt) looked after Noah whilst Helen was on taking care of her boyfriend Oscar Mendez who had been injured badly in a fight. They find Rena, and result in finding Noah, who is sick but alive, and is reunited with his parents. Whilst Rena is arrested, Derek asks Megan to have a ride on her motorbike, to which she rejects and instead goes to see Joan, having a conversation about her father.|$|E

50|$|An {{accusation}} {{was made}} in late 2015 {{that members of the}} Momentum group were aiming to replace Creasy with <b>someone</b> <b>closer</b> to the Labour Left. A possibility that the seat might be redrawn after boundary changes means potential candidates are jockeying for position in the constituency party. Momentum have denied this claim.

5|$|On 23 October 1862, Otto of Bavaria, King of Greece was deposed in a bloodless coup. The Greeks {{were eager}} to have <b>someone</b> <b>close</b> to Britain and Queen Victoria replace Otto; some desired to allow Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh (her second son) succeed as King of Greece. He was elected with 95% {{of the vote in}} the Greek head of state {{referendum}} of 1862. After his ineligibility was confirmed however, the Greeks began looking for other possible candidates, which included Duke Ernest at the British government's suggestion. To their and Victoria's reasoning, if Ernest were to take the Greek throne, Alfred could immediately take up his inheritance and succeed Ernest as duke (the Prince of Wales having passed his claim to the duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha onto his younger brother). Many were in favor of his nomination, including Prime Minister Lord Palmerston and Ernest's sister-in-law. In a letter written to her uncle Leopold I of Belgium, Victoria stated her support for a new royal branch of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (as Leopold had been chosen as King of the Belgians in 1831) as well as her desire for her second son Alfred to succeed his uncle in the duchy. As negotiations continued however, she began to lose enthusiasm for the idea.|$|E

25|$|The first {{assassination}} plots {{began in}} the late summer of 1960, according to the Church Committee’s documentation. Some of the plots and ideas ranged from “poisoned pills, an exploding seashell, and a planned gift of a diving suit contaminated with toxins”. Other plots involved “high-powered rifles outfitted with telescopic sights”. Among plans to assassinate Fidel Castro, there was another plot to assassinate Rolando Cubela, a Cuban revolutionary hero. The plot for Cubela began as an operation to recruit <b>someone</b> <b>close</b> to Castro for the purposes of launching a coup.|$|E

The other dog is known as Bodu or tchen Bodu (tchen being dog in Dgèrnésiais). His appearance, usually in the Clos du Valle, foretells death of the viewer or <b>someone</b> <b>close</b> to him. There are also numerous other unnamed apparitions, usually associated with placenames derived from bête (beast).|$|E

25|$|This anticlericalism was {{not left}} unanswered. The {{leader of the}} {{conservative}} Calvinists, Gisbertus Voetius, published {{the first volume of}} his Politica Ecclesiastica in 1663, in which he attacked (in Latin) De Witt and the Erastian policies of the regents. Possibly by Voetius also, but in any case by <b>someone</b> <b>close</b> to him, was the Resurrected Barnevelt, in which the anonymous writer, writing in Dutch, attacked the provincial-supremacy doctrine and the prayer formulary as an insidious attempt to make the other six provinces subservient to Holland. To which possibly De Witt himself replied with a scalding pamphlet, entitled Schotschen Duyvel in which he denounced Voetius by name as a master-mutineer.|$|E

25|$|Around {{this time}} <b>someone</b> <b>close</b> to Sverre wrote a speech against the bishops, En tale mot biskopene. In this work, the unknown author {{discussed}} {{the relationship between}} King and Church. By referring to well known theological works such as the Decretum Gratiani and the writings of Augustine of Hippo, the author attempted {{to prove that the}} excommunication of Sverre was unjust and thus not binding. The author also tried to defend the right of Sverre to appoint bishops. To support this view he had to interpret Norwegian law, since the Church had long considered this to be simony. By now Sverre had his hands full with the church-supported Bagler rising, and the direct struggle with the church became a sideshow, at least for him personally.|$|E

500|$|Winsor McCay first {{produced}} Dream of the Rarebit Fiend in 1904, a {{year before}} the dream romps of his Little Nemo and a full generation before the artists of the Surrealist movement unleashed the unconscious on the public. [...] The strip had no recurring characters, but followed a theme: after eating a Welsh rarebit, the day's protagonist would be subject to the darker side of his or her psyche. [...] Typically, the strip would begin with an absurd situation which became more and more absurd until the Fiend—the dreamer—awakened in the final panel. [...] Some situations were merely silly: elephants falling from the ceiling, or two women's mink coats having a fight. [...] Other times, they could be more disturbing: characters finding themselves dismembered, buried alive from a first-person perspective or a child's mother being planted and becoming a tree. [...] In some strips the Fiend was a spectator watching fantastic or horrible things happen to <b>someone</b> <b>close</b> to [...] [...] The protagonists are typically urban bourgeoisie whom McCay subjects to fears of public humiliation or loss of social esteem or respectability.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{method for}} 'metaphor engineering' is {{introduced}} {{in the context of}} participatory multimedia design. Our hypothesis, that adults talk to children more with a metaphorical language than to other adults, was empirically verified. Six male adults (students of physics) explained 12 children (6 girls, 6 boys) and 12 adults (5 female, 7 male) two different domain problems: (1) "Why does the sound of a car change, if the car passes by?" (Doppler effect) and (2) "What happens in a bulb, if <b>someone</b> <b>closes</b> the circuit? " (Light generation.) The results of this validation procedure show, that male domain experts generate significantly more metaphorical descriptions explaining a domain problem to children or female adults than to male adults...|$|R
