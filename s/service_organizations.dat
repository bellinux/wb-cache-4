5|$|African Americans were {{originally}} {{admitted to the}} university in the mid-1950s, but few attended until the 1970s; fraternities at this time were generally racially and religiously segregated.

African-American fraternities and sororities soon established chapters at the university, although they presented themselves as <b>service</b> <b>organizations</b> rather than traditional social organizations. In the mid-1970s, although some black students were {{invited to join the}} heavily white fraternities, many preferred to join their own organizations. By the fall of 1973, four black fraternities and one black sorority had established chapters on grounds.|$|E

40|$|The {{community}} development potential of large health <b>services</b> <b>organizations</b> Beaufort B. Longest, Jr Abstract Large health <b>services</b> <b>organizations</b> routinely support communities through provision of services. However, as these organizations have also become important economic entities, they are increasingly viewed as having significant {{potential to make}} additional contributions to com-munity development {{in a variety of}} ways. The incentives for large health <b>services</b> <b>organizations</b> to play broader {{community development}} roles include the same business advantages that accrue to other organizations that do so. Beyond this, uniquely, health services organ-izations can more fully fulfill their central health-enhancing purposes through their community development efforts because, ultimately, the health of people is affected by the quality of the communities in which they live. From significant service and economic roles to broader community development roles The traditional paradigm of the role of health <b>services</b> <b>organizations</b> in com-munity development has been as providers of vital health services. Through this role, these organizations have made and continue to make important contributions to the quality of communities and to the lives of people who live in them. However, as the economic roles of large health <b>services</b> <b>organizations</b> – especially hospitals and systems of hospitals – have grown, so has their potential to play broader community development roles. The traditional view of the role of health <b>services</b> <b>organizations</b> in community development is too limited. The most readily visible aspect of the economic roles of health <b>services</b> <b>organizations</b> is as employers. For example, Rouen University Hospital is the second largest employer in the Haute-Normandie regio...|$|R
5|$|During {{the first}} days of the shutdown, many {{programs}} requested that their funding continue, especially social <b>service</b> <b>organizations</b> that relied on state funding. To hear their pleas, the courts appointed retired State Supreme Court judge Kathleen Blatz as a special master. Dayton and State Attorney General Lori Swanson also both submitted petitions to the Ramsey County District Court when the shutdown began, asking for the court to clarify whether some programs could continue. Judges Kathleen Gearin and Bruce W. Christopherson issued their rulings on July 7, finding that some programs could start again, including criminal background checks, public schools, and local government aid. Gearin complained that the governor and legislature should have been responsible for making decisions about which services could stay open. Gearin had previously heard a case from the Minnesota Zoo, which asked to remain open despite the shutdown, and another from the Canterbury Park horse racing track in Shakopee. While both pay for themselves at least during the summer, Gearin determined that only the Zoo was allowed to operate without legislative appropriations, so she allowed the Zoo to open on July 2 but ordered Canterbury Park to remain closed the same day.|$|E
