Two years later, in an interview with The Brussels Journal, Bukovsky said he had read confidential documents from secret Soviet files in 1992 which confirmed the existence of a [...] "conspiracy" [...] to turn the European Union into a socialist organisation.

2500|$|Grant and his {{administration}} began to consider alternatives to the failed diplomatic venture. [...] In early November 1875, Major General Philip Sheridan, commander of the Division of the Missouri, and Brigadier General George Crook, commander of the Department of the Platte, were called to Washington, D.C. to meet with Grant and several members of his cabinet to discuss the Black Hills issue. They agreed that the Army should stop evicting trespassers from the reservation, thus opening {{the way for the}} Black Hills Gold Rush. In addition, they discussed initiating military action against the bands of Lakota and Northern Cheyenne who had refused to come to the Indian agencies for council. Indian Inspector Erwin C. Watkins supported this option. [...] "The true policy in my judgement," [...] he wrote, [...] "is to send troops against them in the winter, the <b>sooner</b> <b>the</b> <b>better,</b> and whip them into subjection." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, in 1980, Deng Xiao Ping refocused his {{priorities}} {{back on the}} Chinese bureaucracy after his return to power in 1978. He welcomed Lee Kuan Yew, the then-Prime Minister of Singapore and its leading political figure since independence from Malaysia, in a visit to Beijing. [...] Chin recalled that Deng had not bothered to meet him since then. Finally in 1980, Deng summoned Chin. In the meeting, Deng demanded Chin to immediately close down all the CPM’s radio stations which were broadcasting from China to Malaysia. When Chin asked Deng when he would like him to cease the broadcasting, Deng replied, “The <b>sooner</b> <b>the</b> <b>better...</b> Lee (Lee Kuan Yew) asked me to stop the broadcasts immediately.” [...] Moreover, during his official visit to China, the second Prime Minister of Malaysian government Tun Razak held talks with Chinese communist leader Chairman Mao Zedong and urged him to stop giving aid to the CPM. The fourth Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohammad further succeeded in persuading China to downgrade its ties with the CPM. This was an important factor {{that contributed to the}} CPM’s decision to end its armed struggle.|$|E

2500|$|According to an Ohio State University Extension Fact Sheet: ...After {{returning}} from a chigger-infested area, launder the field clothes in soapy, hot water (125°F.) ....As soon as possible, take a good hot bath or shower and soap repeatedly. The chiggers may be dislodged, but you will still have the stylostomes, causing the severe itch. Scratching deep to remove stylostomes can cause secondary infections. For temporary relief of itching, apply ointments of benzocaine, hydrocortisone, calamine lotion, New Skin, After Bite, or others recommended by your pharmacist or medical doctor. Some use Vaseline, cold cream, baby oil, or fingernail polish. (<b>The</b> <b>sooner</b> <b>the</b> treatment, <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>the</b> results.)....|$|R
