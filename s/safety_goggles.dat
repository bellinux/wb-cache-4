25|$|Some {{chainsaw}} users prefer conventional {{safety glasses}} or goggles. The choice {{may depend on}} the environment. The visor provides better ventilation for hard work in hot weather. Often, both <b>safety</b> <b>goggles</b> and a visor are employed for superior protection.|$|E
25|$|Mask or goggles: Masks are {{safety devices}} players are {{required}} to wear at all times on the field, {{to protect them from}} paintballs. The original equipment used by players were <b>safety</b> <b>goggles</b> of the type used in labs and wood shops; today's goggles are derived from skiing/snowboarding goggles, with an attached shell that completely covers the eyes, mouth, ears and nostrils of the wearer. Masks can also feature throat guards. Modern masks have developed to be less bulky compared with older designs. Some players may remove the mouth and/or ear protection for aesthetic or comfort reasons, but this is neither recommended nor often allowed at commercial venues.|$|E

Also in 1959 Pyrene acquired Roberts McClean who in 1931 introduced self-contained compressed air breathing apparatus to the UK and these two companies merged under the Pyrene Panorama flag. In 1976 Fireward Limited, manufacturers since 1964 of plastic-bodied portable dry-powder fire extinguishers also merged with Pyrene Panorama, to form the new Company, Chubb Panorama. A further addition to the Panorama Group came in 1976 when with the change from Pyrene Panorama to Chubb Panorama, Submarine and Safety Engineering Limited joined the team. Specialists in self-contained under-water breathing apparatus and diving equipment, their [...] "Dominair" [...] range added considerably to the company's comprehensive coverage of safety equipment.|$|R
2500|$|UVGI {{is often}} used to {{disinfect}} equipment such as <b>safety</b> <b>goggles,</b> instruments, pipettors, and other devices.

2500|$|Laser <b>safety</b> <b>goggles.</b> Laboratory-type laser <b>safety</b> <b>goggles</b> are {{not well}} suited for pilot operation. [...] "The 20% {{transmission}} ratio of laboratory laser eyewear would probably have disastrous effects on a cockpit crew who must read instruments while flying at night.... The optical quality of such systems also becomes a factor because slight amounts of distortion or haze which may be of no concern in the laboratory may be a major concern to pilots flying at low altitudes and high speed." [...] Also, {{there may be a}} variety of laser wavelengths/colors that may need to be defended against. If all wavelengths are protected, the goggles essentially are opaque. There are also issues with the discomfort of wearing goggles routinely, given that laser incidents are relatively rare.|$|E
2500|$|Moderate and {{high-power}} lasers {{are potentially}} hazardous {{because they can}} burn the retina of the eye, or even the skin. To control the risk of injury, various specifications, for example 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 1040 in the US and IEC 60825 internationally, define [...] "classes" [...] of laser depending on their power and wavelength. These regulations impose upon manufacturers required safety measures, such as labeling lasers with specific warnings, and wearing laser <b>safety</b> <b>goggles</b> when operating lasers. [...] Consensus standards, such as American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Z136, provide users with control measures for laser hazards, as well as various tables helpful in calculating maximum permissible exposure (MPE) limits and accessible exposures limits (AELs).|$|E

50|$|Administrative {{controls}} include {{procedures to}} limit radiation doses, and contamination control procedures including encouraging good work practices and monitoring for contamination. Personal protective equipment {{is the least}} effective and {{should be used in}} conjunction with other hazard controls. In general, personal protective equipment intended for radioactive materials should be effective with radioactive nanomaterials, including impervious laboratory coats, <b>goggles,</b> <b>safety</b> gloves, and in some cases respirators, although the greater potential penetration through clothing and mobility in air of nanoparticles should be taken into account.|$|R
40|$|Toluene {{should not}} be inhaled due to its health effects. Toluene is a highly {{flammable}} material. Refer to the MSD for toluene at all times. Wear laboratory <b>safety</b> gloves and <b>goggles</b> at all times during the experiment. Carefully control the pressure of nitrogen flowing through the mass flow controllers. Sudden increase in pressure may cause the system to explode. Pre-experiments: Read Sander (1) to {{understand the concept of}} the Henryâ€™s law constants.

50|$|Personal {{protective}} equipment (PPE) must be worn on the worker's {{body and}} is the least desirable option for controlling hazards. It is used when other controls are not effective, have not been evaluated, or while doing maintenance or in emergency situations such as spill response. PPE normally used for typical chemicals are also appropriate for nanomaterials, including wearing long pants, long-sleeve shirts, and closed-toed shoes, {{and the use of}} <b>safety</b> gloves, <b>goggles,</b> and impervious laboratory coats. Nitrile gloves are preferred because latex gloves do not provide protection from most chemical solvents and may present an allergy hazard. Face shields are not an acceptable replacement for goggles because they do not protect against unbound dry materials. Woven cotton lab coats are not recommended for nanomaterials, as they can become contaminated with nanomaterials and release them later. PPE should be donned and removed in a changing room to prevent contamination of outside areas.|$|R
50|$|Whether indoors or outdoors, all {{shooters}} {{are required}} to wear <b>safety</b> glasses or <b>goggles,</b> although some ranges will allow impact-resistant corrective glasses as the only eye protection. Ear protection is mandatory either ear muffs or ear plugs, {{as long as one}} is within the defined boundaries of the range and the range is hot. For indoor ranges, these must be donned before going through the air lock door, and kept on as long as individuals are within the high noise area. Indoor ranges can introduce the risk of lead poisoning if they are not ventilated or cleaned properly. Lead dust in these facilities can be inhaled or can contaminate skin and clothing.|$|R
5000|$|In 1910, Edouard Benedictus, a French chemist, {{obtained}} both French and British patents for {{the manufacturing}} of laminated safety glass. He obtained a US patent in 1914. [...] Benedictus used gelatin and other adhesives instead of Canadian balsam in the laminated glass. During World War I, laminated glass {{was used to}} make small, round lenses in gas masks and for windshields in military motor vehicles and aircraft. (For {{a number of recent}} years, the DuPont chemical company gave a Benedictus Award for the innovative use of laminated glass in architecture.) In the 1940s, manufacturers figured out how to sand and make <b>safety</b> glasses and <b>goggles</b> for welders, construction workers, and the like.|$|R

5000|$|... 32P, a beta-emitter (1.71 MeV) with a {{half-life}} of 14.3 days, is used routinely in life-science laboratories, {{primarily to}} produce radiolabeled DNA and RNA probe, e.g. {{for use in}} Northern blots or Southern blots. Because the high-energy beta particles produced penetrate skin and corneas, and because any 32P ingested, inhaled, or absorbed is readily incorporated into bone and nucleic acids, OSHA requires that a lab coat, disposable gloves, and <b>safety</b> glasses or <b>goggles</b> be worn when working with 32P, and that working directly over an open container be avoided {{in order to protect}} the eyes. ing personal, clothing, and surface contamination is also required. In addition, due to the high energy of the beta particles, shielding this radiation with the normally used dense materials (e.g. lead), gives rise to secondary emission of X-rays via a process known as bremsstrahlung, meaning braking radiation. Therefore, shielding must be accomplished with low-density materials, e.g. Plexiglas, Lucite, plastic, wood, or water.|$|R

40|$|A skilled woodsman quickly reduces a large tree to {{manageable}} pieces. Inexperienced {{chain saw}} operators can gain {{some of these}} skills with training and using safe, efficient cutting practices. Even seasoned woodcutters should revise techniques that are hazardous. One analysis of chain saw accidents revealed that 70 percent of those injured {{had more than one}} yearâ€™s experience. To avoid injuries, possibly even death, practice safe woodcutting while clearing, thinning, cutting firewood or cleaning up trees downed by a storm. A hard hat to protect your head from falling limbs or branches. The best helmets have a face guard. <b>Safety</b> glasses or <b>goggles</b> to prevent injury from flying wood chips. Wear these during wood splitting also, to preserve your eyesight. Ear muffs or ear plugs to protect ears from permanent injury. Noise from some gasolinepowered chain saws can exceed 100 decibels. You should be well prepared before going into the woods. Cutting firewood, thinning timber stands or clearing is worthwhile and rewarding if done properly, but they can also be dangerous. Felling, limbing, bucking and trimming trees are hazardous tasks if not done carefully. This fact sheet gives basic safety precautions for reducing common woodcutting hazards. Each year a number of serious injuries to Arkansans could be prevented by following fairly simple precautions...|$|R
5000|$|Priming {{the case}} is the most {{dangerous}} step of the loading process, since the primers are pressure-sensitive. The use of <b>safety</b> glasses or <b>goggles</b> during priming operations can provide valuable protection in the rare event that an accidental detonation takes place. Seating a Boxer primer not only places the primer in the case, it also seats the anvil of the primer down onto the priming compound, in effect arming the primer. A correctly seated primer will sit slightly {{below the surface of the}} case. A primer that protrudes from the case may cause a number of problems, including what is known as a slam fire, which is the firing of a case before the action is properly locked when chambering a round. This may either damage the gun, and/or injure the shooter. A protruding primer will also tend to hang when feeding, and the anvil will not be seated correctly so the primer may not fire when hit by the firing pin. Primer pockets may need to be cleaned with a primer pocket brush to remove deposits that prevent the primer from being properly seated. Berdan primers must also be seated carefully, and since the anvil is part of the case, the anvil must be inspected before the primer is seated. For reloading cartridges intended for use in military-surplus firearms, rifles especially, [...] "hard" [...] primers are most commonly used instead of commercial [...] "soft" [...] primers. The use of [...] "hard" [...] primers avoids slamfires when loading finished cartridges in the military-surplus firearm. Such primers are available to handloaders commercially.|$|R
