5|$|The Crow Green tannery was {{situated}} at the south-west end {{of the town and}} was already in existence in 1816. It had a water-powered bark mill and 47 tan pits at that date. It was owned by the Selwood family for much of the 19th and 20th centuries, who probably purchased it from James Whitby around 1830, and it was often referred to as Selwood's tannery. It suffered from fires in 1831, 1867 and 1958. In 1881 it employed 48 people and over 100 in 1958 (8% of the local workforce at the time). One of the major products of the factory in the nineteenth century was high-quality <b>sole</b> <b>leather,</b> but during the Second World War, only poor-quality hides, such as buffalo, were allocated to the firm. The business was badly damaged by the invention of rubber stick-on shoe soles which reduced the demand for <b>sole</b> <b>leather</b> from shoe repairers. It finally finished operation in 1967 when the leather side of the business was sold to a Yorkshire firm.|$|E
500|$|Finished <b>sole</b> <b>leather</b> was hauled {{over the}} bridge by horse-drawn wagon south about [...] to Little Bear Creek, where it was {{exchanged}} for [...] "green" [...] hides and other supplies brought north from Montoursville. These were then hauled north across the bridge into Proctor. The hides, which were tanned to make leather, came from the United States, and {{as far away as}} Mexico, Argentina, and China. Hemlock bark, used in the tanning process, was hauled to the tannery from up to [...] away in both summer and winter, using wagons and sleds. The lumber boom on Plunketts Creek ended when the virgin timber ran out. By 1898, the old growth hemlock was exhausted and the Proctor tannery, then owned by the Elk Tanning Company, was closed and dismantled.|$|E
500|$|As the 19thcentury progressed, fewer pines {{were left}} and more hemlocks and {{hardwoods}} were cut and processed locally. By 1810 there were 11sawmills in the Pine Creek watershed, and by 1840 there were 145, despite a flood in 1832 which wiped out {{nearly all the}} mills along the creek. Selective harvesting of pines was replaced by clearcutting of all lumber in a tract. The first lumbering activity to take place close {{to what is now}} Leonard Harrison State Park occurred in 1838 when William Dodge and some partners built a settlement at Big Meadows and formed the Pennsylvania Joint Land and Lumber Company. Dodge's company purchased thousands of acres of land in the area, including what is now Colton Point State Park.

These logs floated to the West Branch Susquehanna River and to sawmills near the Susquehanna Boom at Williamsport. Hemlock wood was not widely used until the advent of wire nails, but the bark was used to tan leather.

2500|$|From 1902 the Universal Military Saddle was {{manufactured}} with a fixed tree, broad {{panels to}} spread the load, and initially a front arch in three sizes. [...] The advantage of this saddle was its lightness, ease of repair and comfort for horse and rider. From 1912 the saddle was built on an adjustable tree and consequently only one size was needed. [...] Its advantage over the fixed tree 1902 pattern was its ability to maintain a better fit on the horse’s back as the horse gained or lost weight. [...] This saddle was made using traditional methods and featured a seat blocked from <b>sole</b> <b>leather,</b> which maintained its shape well.

50|$|Organ {{shoes are}} {{typically}} as narrow as comfortably possible, {{so as to}} prevent accidental playing {{of more than one}} pedal key at a time. They usually have both <b>leather</b> <b>soles</b> and <b>leather</b> heels that are glued into place (rather than stitched), which allow the organist to slide the feet along and across the pedals easily. The soles should be thin enough to feel the pedal key surfaces reasonably easily. Organ shoes typically have a slightly higher heel of about one inch - to ease playing with the heel, and to allow non-adjacent notes to be played at once by one foot.|$|R
