25|$|On September 24, 2013, a <b>session</b> <b>cookie</b> {{persistence}} security flaw {{was reported}} in Ruby on Rails. In a default configuration, the entire session hash is stored within a <b>session</b> <b>cookie</b> known as CookieStore, allowing any authenticated session possessing the <b>session</b> <b>cookie</b> to log in as the target user {{at any time in}} the future. As a workaround, administrators are advised to configure cookies to be stored on the server using mechanisms such as ActiveRecordStore.|$|E

50|$|PHPIDS detects Cross-site {{scripting}} (XSS), SQL injection, header injection, Directory traversal, Remote File Execution, Local File Inclusion, Denial of Service (DoS).

5000|$|Session side jacking, {{where the}} {{attacker}} uses packet sniffing to read network traffic between two parties {{to steal the}} <b>session</b> <b>cookie.</b> Many web sites use SSL encryption for login pages to prevent attackers from seeing the password, but do not use encryption {{for the rest of}} the site once authenticated. This allows attackers that can read the network traffic to intercept all the data that is submitted to the server or web pages viewed by the client. Since this data includes the <b>session</b> <b>cookie,</b> it allows him to impersonate the victim, even if the password itself is not compromised. [...] Unsecured Wi-Fi hotspots are particularly vulnerable, as anyone sharing the network will generally be able to read most of the web traffic between other nodes and the access point.|$|E
5|$|The data {{obtained}} by a Heartbleed attack may include unencrypted exchanges between TLS parties likely to be confidential, including any form post data in users' requests. Moreover, the confidential data exposed could include authentication secrets such as <b>session</b> <b>cookies</b> and passwords, which might allow attackers to impersonate a user of the service.|$|R
5000|$|All current web browsers {{can store}} {{a fairly large}} amount of data (2-32 MB) via JavaScript using the DOM {{property}} [...] This data can be used instead of <b>session</b> <b>cookies</b> and is also cross-domain. The technique can be coupled with JSON/JavaScript objects to store complex sets of session variables on the client side.|$|R
25|$|Besides content filtering, other {{imperfect}} {{methods for}} cross-site scripting mitigation are also commonly used. One {{example is the}} use of additional security controls when handling cookie-based user authentication. Many web applications rely on <b>session</b> <b>cookies</b> for authentication between individual HTTP requests, and because client-side scripts generally have access to these cookies, simple XSS exploits can steal these cookies. To mitigate this particular threat (though not the XSS problem in general), many web applications tie <b>session</b> <b>cookies</b> to the IP address of the user who originally logged in, then only permit that IP to use that cookie. This is effective in most situations (if an attacker is only after the cookie), but obviously breaks down in situations where an attacker is behind the same NATed IP address or web proxy as the victim, or the victim is changing his or her mobile IP.|$|R
50|$|A Lotus Domino server or an IBM WebSphere server that is {{configured}} {{to use the}} LTPA authentication {{will challenge}} the web user for a name and password. When the user has been authenticated, their browser will have received a <b>session</b> <b>cookie</b> - a cookie that is only available for one browsing session. This cookie contains the LTPA token.|$|E
50|$|A <b>session</b> <b>cookie,</b> {{also known}} as an in-memory cookie or {{transient}} cookie, exists only in temporary memory while the user navigates the website.Web browsers normally delete session cookies when the user closes the browser. Unlike other cookies, session cookies {{do not have an}} expiration date assigned to them, which is how the browser knows to treat them as session cookies.|$|E
50|$|Because session cookies only {{contain a}} unique session identifier, {{this makes the}} amount of {{personal}} information that a website can save about each user virtually limitless—the website {{is not limited to}} restrictions concerning how large a cookie can be. Session cookies also help to improve page load times, since the amount of information in a <b>session</b> <b>cookie</b> is small and requires little bandwidth.|$|E
50|$|A JSON Web Token (JWT) is a {{self-contained}} packet {{of information that}} can be used to store user identity and authenticity information. This allows them to be used in place of <b>session</b> <b>cookies.</b> Unlike cookies, which are automatically attached to each HTTP request by the browser, JWTs must be explicitly attached to each HTTP request by the web application.|$|R

50|$|Firesheep is an {{extension}} for the Firefox web browser that uses a packet sniffer to intercept unencrypted session cookies from websites such as Facebook and Twitter. The plugin eavesdrops on Wi-Fi communications, listening for session cookies. When it detects a <b>session</b> <b>cookie,</b> the tool uses this cookie to obtain the identity belonging to that session. The collected identities (victims) are displayed in a side bar in Firefox. By clicking on a victim's name, the victim's session is {{taken over by the}} attacker.|$|E
5000|$|The server's HTTP {{response}} {{contains the}} contents of the website's homepage. But it also instructs the browser to set two cookies. The first, [...] "theme", {{is considered to be a}} <b>session</b> <b>cookie,</b> since it does not have an [...] or [...] attribute. Session cookies are intended to be deleted by the browser when the browser closes. The second, [...] "sessionToken" [...] is considered to be a persistent cookie, since it contains an [...] attribute, which instructs the browser to delete the cookie at a specific date and time.|$|E
50|$|The login server now {{presents}} a login page, allowing {{the user to}} present a username and a password or {{some other kind of}} credentials. The login server forwards the information presented by the user to an authentication server. If the login server receives a response indication success, it sets two cookies (login cookie and granting cookie) and redirects the user back to the web application. The granting cookie is scoped to reach the web application server, whose Pubcookie module uses the contents of the pre-session cookie and the granting cookie to generate the final <b>session</b> <b>cookie.</b>|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of disclosure, some 17% (around half a million) of the Internet's secure web servers {{certified}} by trusted authorities {{were believed to be}} vulnerable to the attack, allowing theft of the servers' private keys and users' <b>session</b> <b>cookies</b> and passwords. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, Ars Technica, and Bruce Schneier all deemed the Heartbleed bug catastrophic. Forbes cybersecurity columnist Joseph Steinberg wrote: ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>Session</b> <b>cookies</b> {{constitute}} one of {{the main}} attack targets against client authentication on the Web. To counter that, modern web browsers implement native cookie protection mechanisms based on the Secure and HttpOnly flags. While there is a general understanding about the effectiveness of these defenses, no formal result has so far been proved about the security guarantees they convey. With the present paper we provide the first such result, with a mechanized proof of noninterfer-ence assessing the robustness of the Secure and HttpOnly cookie flags against both web and network attacks. We then develop CookiExt, a browser extension that provides client-side protection against session hi-jacking based on appropriate flagging of <b>session</b> <b>cookies</b> and automatic redirection over HTTPS for HTTP requests carrying such cookies. Our solution improves over existing client-side defenses by combining protec-tion against both web and network attacks, {{while at the same time}} being designed so as to minimise its effects on the user’s browsing experience. ...|$|R
50|$|Web storage, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} DOM storage (Document Object Model storage), provides web application software {{methods and protocols}} used for storing data in a web browser. Web storage supports persistent data storage, similar to cookies but with a greatly enhanced capacity and no information stored in the HTTP request header. There are two main web storage types: local storage and session storage, behaving similarly to persistent <b>cookies</b> and <b>session</b> <b>cookies</b> respectively.|$|R
50|$|QR codes, {{two-dimensional}} {{bar codes}} that can store an encrypted array of sensitive data, {{are used for}} users to instantly identify the server by using their smartphones. Just as a user log into a web site without needing to type in a user ID and password, the user scans a QR code generated on the PC to verify the server. It is secure and able to effectively protect from hacking threats as it uses a specific time <b>session</b> <b>cookie</b> and a shared secret between the server and the user’s PC. It is device-dependent technology. This service authentication methods needs a set of PC and a smartphone for it to work properly.|$|E
5000|$|The first cookie, , is set {{to expire}} {{sometime}} on 15 January 2013. It will {{be used by the}} client browser until that time. The second cookie, , does not have an expiration date, making it a <b>session</b> <b>cookie.</b> It will be deleted after the user closes their browser. The third cookie, , has its value changed to [...] "deleted", with an expiration time in the past. The browser will delete this cookie right away because its expiration time is in the past. Note that cookie will only be deleted if the domain and path attributes in the [...] field match the values used when the cookie was created.|$|E
5000|$|A8 (CSRF) : A CSRF attack {{forces a}} logged-on victim’s browser {{to send a}} forged HTTP request, {{including}} the victim’s <b>session</b> <b>cookie</b> and any other automatically included authentication information, to a vulnerable web application. This allows the attacker to force the victim’s browser to generate requests the vulnerable application thinks are legitimate requests from the victim. HDIV adds random tokens to each link or form existing within the application. It makes extremely difficult to implement an CSRF attack because the attacker does not know which is the value. In order to offer an extreme security level HDIV does not use a random token per session and creates a new token for each requested page. Even the token used by links and forms within the same page are different avoiding the reuse of link tokens to exploit a web form. One token is created for data retrieval requests (GET, HEAD, TRACE and OPTIONS HTTP methods) and another for data modification (POST, PATCH, PUT and DELETE methods).|$|E
30|$|Cookies may be {{subdivided}} into <b>session</b> <b>cookies,</b> erased when the browser is closed, and persistent cookies, preserved across multiple browser <b>sessions.</b> Persistent <b>cookies</b> are frequently {{used as an}} inexpensive way to store users’ preferences for a Web site. The advantage is that the Web site operator doesn’t need to maintain an account for the user; all pertinent information is stored in the browser, and {{made available to the}} site when the user visits it. Cookies may also be used for tracking purposes: a cookie lets a Web site uniquely identify the user (on a given computer) and link to her all Web pages she visited on that site. Tracking is possible within a single Web site or across a group of cooperating Web sites.|$|R
