5|$|The design's lack of {{structural}} integrity {{is seen as}} another significant weakness of the Quad ESL-63 since its inception, and lived on in its various successors. Other shortcomings include very limited <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> levels, meaning that it won't play loud, and its bass response was lacking. In addition, one reviewer experienced problems with shut-downs playing music with high intensity bass drums.|$|E
5|$|Logarithmic scales reduce wide-ranging {{quantities}} to tiny scopes. For example, the decibel is a unit quantifying signal power log-ratios and amplitude log-ratios (of which <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> is {{a common}} example). In chemistry, pH is a logarithmic measure for the acidity of an aqueous solution. Logarithms are commonplace in scientific formulae, and in measurements {{of the complexity of}} algorithms and of geometric objects called fractals. They describe musical intervals, appear in formulas counting prime numbers, inform some models in psychophysics, and can aid in forensic accounting.|$|E
5|$|The three {{ossicles}} transmit {{sound from}} the outer ear to the inner ear. The malleus receives vibrations from <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> on the eardrum, where it is connected at its longest part (the manubrium or handle) by a ligament. It transmits vibrations to the incus, which in turn transmits the vibrations to the small stapes bone. The wide base of the stapes rests on the oval window. As the stapes vibrates, vibrations are transmitted through the oval window, causing movement of fluid within the cochlea.|$|E

5|$|The Mac Pro's Xeon {{processors}} generated {{much less}} heat {{than the previous}} dual-core G5s, so {{the size of the}} internal cooling devices were reduced significantly. This allowed the interior to be re-arranged, leaving more room {{at the top of the}} case and doubling the number of internal drive bays. This also allowed the elimination of the large clear plastic air deflector used as part of the cooling system in the Power Mac G5. Less heat also meant less air to move out of the case for cooling during normal operations; the Mac Pro was very quiet in normal operation, quieter than the much noisier Power Mac G5, and proved difficult to measure using common <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> level meters.|$|E
5|$|Subwoofers use speaker drivers (woofers) {{typically}} between 8-inch (20cm) and 21-inch (53cm) in diameter. Some uncommon subwoofers use larger drivers, {{and single}} prototype subwoofers {{as large as}} 60-inch (152cm) have been fabricated. On the smaller end of the spectrum, subwoofer drivers as small as 4-inch (10cm) may be used. Small subwoofer drivers in the 4-inch range are typically used in small computer speaker systems and compact home theatre subwoofer cabinets. The size of the driver and number of drivers in a cabinet depends {{on the design of}} the loudspeaker enclosure, the size of the cabinet, the desired <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> level, the lowest frequency targeted and the level of permitted distortion. The most common subwoofer driver sizes used for sound reinforcement in nightclubs, raves and pop/rock concerts are 10-, 12-, 15- and 18-inch models (25cm, 30cm, 38cm, and 45cm respectively). The largest available sound reinforcement subwoofers, 21-inch (53cm) drivers, are less commonly seen.|$|E
25|$|Examples {{of typical}} {{measurements}} are: amplitude and phase characteristics vs. frequency; impulse response under {{one or more}} conditions (e.g., square waves, sine wave bursts, etc.); directivity vs. frequency (e.g., horizontally, vertically, spherically, etc.); harmonic and intermodulation distortion vs. <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> level (SPL) output, using any of several test signals; stored energy (i.e., ringing) at various frequencies; impedance vs. frequency; and small-signal vs. large-signal performance. Most of these measurements require sophisticated and often expensive equipment to perform, and also good judgment by the operator, but the raw <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> level output is rather easier to report and so is often the only specified value—sometimes in misleadingly exact terms. The <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> level (SPL) a loudspeaker produces is measured in decibels (dBspl).|$|E

40|$|High {{pressure}} drops through {{relief valves}} at gas plants can generate <b>sound</b> <b>pressures,</b> which propagate through the downstream pipe, exciting circumferential and dynamic stresses. These stresses can cause acoustically-induced fatigue, leading to {{failure of the}} pipe {{in a matter of}} hours. This project evaluates the feasibility of retrofitting composite wraps onto at risk pipe sections to reduce the severity of vibration. Damping properties of the composite wrap may reduce the <b>sound</b> <b>pressures</b> in the wall of the pipe, reducing the likelihood of fatigue failure. Using finite element analysis, the reduction in stress and acceleration in the pipe wall is examined, and the wrap lay-up and material properties will be optimized to produce the greatest reduction in sound power level...|$|R

25|$|Sensitivity– The <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> level {{produced}} by a loudspeaker in a non-reverberant environment, often specified in dB and measured at 1 meter with an input of 1 watt (2.83 rms volts into 8Ω), typically at one or more specified frequencies. Manufacturers often use this rating in marketing material.|$|E
25|$|The {{compression}} effect: The amplification {{needed to}} make quiet sounds audible, if applied to loud sounds would damage the inner ear (cochlea). Louder sounds are therefore reduced giving a smaller audible volume range and hence inherent distortion. Hearing protection is also provided by an overall cap to the <b>sound</b> <b>pressure.</b> Also of protective value is impulse noise suppression, available in some high-end aids.|$|E

40|$|In a {{previous}} paper (Technical Note No. 605), a theory was developed that required an empirical relation to calculate <b>sound</b> <b>pressures</b> {{for the higher}} harmonics. Further investigation indicated that the modified theory agrees with experiment and that the empirical relation was due to an interference phenomenon peculiar to the test arrangement used. Comparison is made between the test results for a two-blade arrangement and the theory.

25|$|Some {{microphones}} {{are designed}} {{not to have}} their impedance matched by the load they are connected to. Doing so can alter their frequency response and cause distortion, especially at high <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> levels.

25|$|By {{driving a}} current through the voice coil, a {{magnetic}} field is produced. This magnetic field causes the voice coil {{to react to the}} magnetic field from a permanent magnet fixed to the speaker's frame, thereby moving the cone of the speaker.

25|$|Since {{the human}} ear {{does not have}} a flat {{spectral}} response, sound pressures are often frequency weighted so that the measured level matches perceived levels more closely. The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) has defined several weighting schemes. A-weighting attempts to match the response of the human ear to noise and A-weighted <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> levels are labeled dBA. C-weighting is used to measure peak levels.|$|E
