6000|$|A light, girlish laugh followed. He {{sprang to}} his feet. It was Susy {{standing}} beside him--and Susy even as <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> old days! ...|$|E
60|$|The mammas {{looked on}} and helped about supper, and Bess {{sat in the}} tent like an old woman, and told {{pleasant}} fortunes, as <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> palms of the soft little hands the children showed her.|$|E
6000|$|Felix twitched {{the quilt}} rather viciously and grunted. But I {{began to think}} I would like Felicity. It might not be {{altogether}} her fault that she was vain. How could she help it when <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mirror? ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes--she's very vain. 'Tis {{said that}} {{every night at}} going to bed <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> glass to put on her night-cap properly." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{instruction}} manual for Totally Rad {{is filled with}} surfer lingo, in addition to comical picture breaks and comments about the author's [...] "babe" [...] and how attractive <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> picture he put of her <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{instruction manual}}.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No,' he pleaded, 'no!' With {{his thick}} brows knitted, he {{surveyed}} her anxiously. She {{had received a}} great blow in August, and she still was stunned. Her face, white and heavy, was like a mask, almost sullen. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fire, forgetting him.|$|E
60|$|Here <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> glass, and as {{she looked}} the color deepened in her cheek, her eyes shone, and a smile would sit upon her lips, for the {{reflection}} showed her a very winning face under the coquettish hat put on to captivate.|$|E
6000|$|The next day, {{when she}} wanted to pay the greengrocer, <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes. Then she sat down and thought: [...] "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it {{anywhere}} else?" ...|$|E
50|$|What's worse is that Mikan and Yoshioka have {{attended}} the same academies since Elementary School, and people (including her own Mother) persuade her to date Yoshioka. At times, when <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> direction of Iwaki and Yoshioka, Shimi-chan gets {{the wrong idea}} and assumes Mikan is staring at Yoshioka, not Iwaki.|$|R
5000|$|Meanwhile, Wilhelmina pays a {{visit to}} a person whose face is {{partially}} wrapped up and it is discovered that the two are already discussing behind-the-scenes sinister plans to take over Meade Publications. While <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mirror, <b>she</b> also says that they should {{keep a close eye on}} [...] "...that ugly assistant..." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eyes, with dismay in {{her growing}} intelligence.|$|R
6000|$|The {{next few}} days seemed years for length: but she could wait. She was sure of him now. She needed no charms. [...] "Perhaps," [...] thought she, as <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> glass, [...] "I was my own charm." [...] And, indeed, she had every fair right to say so.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Tabitha went up {{and down}} all over the house, mewing for Tom Kitten. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pantry under the staircase, and she searched the best spare bedroom that was all covered up with dust sheets. She went right upstairs and looked into the attics, but she could not find him anywhere.|$|E
60|$|Miss Jelks {{waited for}} his {{appearance}} the following evening in vain. Several evenings passed, but no boatswain, and it became apparent at last that he had realized the perils of his position. Anger at his defection was mingled with admiration for his strength of mind every time <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> glass.|$|E
60|$|She did not flinch {{from before}} him. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face, coldly and without fear.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> me <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face. Her tired {{eyes lit}} with a gleam {{of her former}} humor.|$|R
6000|$|In fact, {{religion}} and morality, as they now stand, compose a practical code of misery and servitude: {{the genius of}} human happiness must tear every leaf from the accursed book of God ere man can read the inscription on his heart. How would morality, dressed up in stiff stays and finery, start from her own disgusting image should <b>she</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mirror of nature!-- ...|$|R
60|$|A thundering rap at {{the front}} door {{interrupted}} the conversation. Mrs. Proudie stood up and shook herself gently, and touched her cap on each side as <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mirror. Each of the girls stood on tiptoe and rearranged the bows on their bosoms, and Mr. Slope rushed upstairs three steps at a time.|$|E
60|$|Her trunks {{had been}} taken down already. She chose the little hat that he liked her best in, and over it {{fastened}} her thickest veil. Then, putting on her travelling coat and gloves, <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> long mirror, and seeing {{that there was nothing}} more to keep her, lifted her dressing bag, and went down.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, now, I don't like to {{tell about}} these 'ere things, and you mustn't never speak about it; but as sure as you live, Polly Kittridge, I see that ar very woman standin' {{at the back of}} the bed, right in the partin' of the curtains, jist as <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pictur'--blue eyes and curly hair and pearls on her neck, and black dress." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{remembered that}} <b>she</b> had <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> glass before <b>she</b> {{had come down}} to him, and bit her lip.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eyes, very sweetly, {{but with}} {{the shadow of a}} great {{disturbance}} in her face.|$|R
500|$|... "Adore {{was like}} an aging Hollywood superstar," [...] Corgan later told Q. [...] "She's 55 years old and she's had three facelifts. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mirror one day and {{suddenly}} realises that she can't sustain the energy anymore. That record was all about dreams dying." [...] In 1999, Ned Raggett ranked the album at number 101 on his list of [...] "The Top 136 Or So Albums Of The Nineties".|$|R
6000|$|The girl, {{sitting there}} {{surrounded}} by scurrying clerks and saleswomen, had {{a return of}} her bewilderment and doubt. [...] "Can it be true that I can buy any of these cloaks and hats?" [...] she asked herself. What was the magic that had made her lightest wish realizable? When a splendid cloak fell round her shoulders, and <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> glass at the tall figure there, she glowed with pride.|$|E
60|$|And then {{across the}} room floated a woman's trilling laugh. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{direction}} of the sound and beheld the gorgeous figure of the King bending--yet haughty and condescending even in adoration--over handsome Madame de Ludres. Pride and ambition rose up in sudden fury to trample on religious feeling. Let Vanens take her to this witch of his, for be the aid what it might, she must have it.|$|E
60|$|Maggie felt an {{unexpected}} pang. She didn't want her hair to look pretty--she only {{wanted people to}} think her a clever little girl, and not to find fault with her untidy head. But now, when Tom began to laugh at her, the affair had quite a new aspect. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> glass, and still Tom laughed and clapped his hands, while Maggie's flushed cheeks began to pale and her lips to tremble a little.|$|E
50|$|A {{variety of}} methods and {{patterns}} are used in breast self-exams. Most methods suggest that <b>the</b> woman stand <b>in</b> {{front of a mirror}} with the torso exposed to view. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mirror for visual signs of dimpling, swelling, or redness on or near the breasts. This is usually repeated in several positions, such as while having hands on the hips, and then again with arms held overhead.|$|R
5000|$|... "Adore {{was like}} an aging Hollywood superstar," [...] Corgan later told Q. [...] "Shes 55 years old and shes had three facelifts. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mirror one day and {{suddenly}} realises that she cant sustain the energy anymore.

60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face, and I {{can still}} see those black eyes of hers {{softening}} before the gaze.|$|R
6000|$|The {{next morning}} the prince went out hunting. Before leaving he told his step-sister that she might go into every {{room in the house}} except into the cave where the dead robbers lay. But as soon as his back was turned she forgot what he had said, and having wandered through all the other rooms she went down to the cellar and opened the door. As soon as <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> robber who had only pretended to be dead sat up and said to her: ...|$|E
60|$|The {{evening was}} so still that Ginger's footsteps, as he pounded {{along the road}} {{on his way back}} from the village, whither he had gone to buy provisions, evening papers, and wool for the sweater which Sally was knitting, were audible long before he turned in at the gate. Sally could not see him, but <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{direction}} of the sound and once again felt that pleasant, cosy thrill of happiness which had come to her every evening for the last year.|$|E
6000|$|She {{put down}} the child and made the change. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> glass and was {{astonished}} at her beauty. She resolved to make her death toilet perfect. She took off her handkerchief turban and dressed her glossy wealth of hair [...] "like white folks"; she added some odds and ends of rather lurid ribbon and a spray of atrocious artificial flowers; finally she threw over her shoulders a fluffy thing called a [...] "cloud" [...] in that day, which was of a blazing red complexion. Then she {{was ready for the}} tomb.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> Brooks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face as {{she held}} his hand, and With a little start he {{realized}} that she knew.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eyes. Against the {{whiteness}} of his skin, the colour {{of her own}} seemed more wonderful than ever.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> me <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face. Her {{cheeks were}} flushed with walking, {{and the wind}} had blown her hair into {{becoming}} confusion.|$|R
