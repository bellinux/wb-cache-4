25|$|A Kiss in the Dreamhouse is a feat of {{imagination}} scarcely ever recorded. It's breathtaking. Somehow, a bold assurance of intention {{has met with}} a hunger for experimenting with sound to expand an already formidable group of songs into pure, open-minded ambiguity. The flesh of the song will balloon out or contort into unimaginable patterns; indecipherable echoes volley between {{the walls of the}} recording; glassy, splintered tones pierce the luxuriant <b>sheen</b> <b>of</b> the mix. Repeated listens trick the sense of balance; tremendous risks are taken.|$|E
25|$|Of all of Pape's works, TtEias (1979) {{is perhaps}} most emblematic of her artistic process. The TtEias was first {{conceived}} in 1979, {{but it was not}} until the 1990s that it was produced in full scale. The artwork consists of nine semi-transparent prisms, which were created using gold thread. A square platform drilled with nails serves as the base of each prism. The gold thread is then wrapped around each protruding nail, from floor to ceiling, to create the prism. Light is shined onto the prisms at various angles, emphasizing the metallic <b>sheen</b> <b>of</b> the thread. The exhibition space is otherwise dark, giving the allusion that the prisms continue infinitely upwards.|$|E

25|$|The Brooklyn Bridegrooms used checked uniforms in 1889, {{and brought}} them back in 1907 (as the Superbas) and 1916–1917 (as the Robins). Satin uniforms were {{developed}} by several teams including the Brooklyn Dodgers for night games, as the <b>sheen</b> <b>of</b> the fabric was more reflective and thus easier to see. Pinstripes were commonly worn on the uniforms of the New York Yankees. Legend had it that the stripes were adopted to make Babe Ruth look slimmer, but since the Yankees had already been wearing pinstripes {{a few years before}} Ruth played for them in 1920, the legend was found to be a myth. The Yankees' pinstripes on their home uniforms soon became a team symbol.|$|E
500|$|With {{the history}} of {{astronomy}} intimately associated with mythology and astrology before the scientific revolution, the red star, like the planet Mars that derives its name from a Roman war god, has been {{closely associated with the}} [...] archetype of conquest for millennia, and by extension, the motif of death and rebirth. Other cultures have produced different myths. Stephen R. Wilk has proposed the constellation of Orion could have represented the Greek mythological figure Pelops, who had an artificial shoulder of ivory made for him, with Betelgeuse as the shoulder, its color reminiscent of the reddish yellow <b>sheen</b> <b>of</b> ivory.|$|E

Sean Axmaker praised the structure and setup of the film, saying, [...] "It's a weird movie with an awkward narrative, which Deodato makes all the more effective with his grimy <b>sheen</b> <b>of</b> documentary realism, while Riz Ortolani's unsettlingly lovely, elegiac score provides a weird undercurrent." [...] Jason Buchanan of Allmovie said, [...] "While it's hard to defend the director {{for some of the}} truly repugnant images with which he has chosen to convey his message, there is indeed an underlying point to the film, if one is able to look beyond the sometimes unwatchable images that assault the viewer." ...|$|E

500|$|The blue {{wildebeest}} {{was first}} described by English naturalist William John Burchell in 1823 {{and he gave}} it the scientific name Connochaetes taurinus. It shares the genus Connochaetes with the black wildebeest (C. gnou), and {{is placed in the}} family Bovidae, ruminant animals with cloven hooves. The generic name Connochaetes derives from the Greek words κόννος, kónnos, [...] "beard", and χαίτη, khaítē, [...] "flowing hair", [...] "mane". The specific name taurinus originates from the Greek word tauros, which means a bull or bullock. The common name [...] "blue wildebeest" [...] refers to the conspicuous, silvery-blue <b>sheen</b> <b>of</b> the coat, while the alternative name [...] "gnu" [...] originates from the name for these animals used by the Khokloi people, a native pastoralist people of southwestern Africa.|$|E
500|$|In 1963 Timmons' playing, with Lewis Powers on {{bass and}} Ron McCurdy on drums, was {{described}} by a Washington Post reviewer as [...] "flexible and adventuresome [...] Glossing over everything is an undeniable <b>sheen</b> <b>of</b> church music and spirituals." [...] In 1965 the same reviewer commented that Timmons was employing musicians who were of much lower ability: [...] "Timmons lacks a certain passion but I wonder {{if this is not}} the fault of his sidemen." [...] Timmons started playing vibes in the mid-1960s. He occasionally played organ, but recorded only one track on that instrument – a 1964 version of [...] "Moanin'" [...] on From the Bottom. Recordings as a leader continued, usually as part of a trio or quartet, but, after joining Milestone Records around 1967, Timmons' album Got to Get It! featured him as part of a nonet, playing arrangements by Tom McIntosh.|$|E
500|$|The {{mirror is}} a {{perfectly}} defined unbroken pale rectangle within a broad black rectangle. A clear geometric shape, like a lit face, draws {{the attention of the}} viewer more than a broken geometric shape such as the door, or a shadowed or oblique face such as that of the dwarf in the foreground or that of the man in the background. The viewer cannot distinguish the features of the king and queen, but in the opalescent <b>sheen</b> <b>of</b> the mirror's surface, the glowing ovals are plainly turned directly to the viewer. Jonathan Miller points out that apart from [...] "adding suggestive gleams at the bevelled edges, the most important way the mirror betrays its identity is by disclosing imagery whose brightness is so inconsistent with the dimness of the surrounding wall that it can only have been borrowed, by reflection, from the strongly illuminated figures of the King and Queen".|$|E

500|$|Measuring [...] in length, {{the western}} jackdaw {{is the second}} {{smallest}} member of the genus Corvus. Most of the plumage is a shiny black, with a purple (in subspecies monedula and spermologus) or blue (in subspecies cirtensis and soemmerringii) sheen on the crown, forehead, and secondaries, and a green-blue sheen on the throat, primaries, and tail. The cheeks, nape and neck are light grey to greyish-silver, and the underparts are slate-grey. The legs are black, as is the short stout bill, the length of which is about 75% {{of the length of}} the rest of the head. There are rictal bristles covering around 40% of the maxilla and 25% of the lower mandible. The irises of adults are greyish or silvery white while those of juveniles are light blue, becoming brownish before whitening at around one year of age. The sexes look alike, though the head and neck plumage of male birds fades more with age and wear, particularly just before moulting. Western jackdaws undergo a complete moult from June to September in the western parts of their range, and a month later in the east. The purplish <b>sheen</b> <b>of</b> the cap is most prominent just after moulting.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{predominant}} synthetic attributes {{and the overall}} electronic aesthetic, the emphasis placed on organic string arrangements that had accentuated Late Registration remained a significant factor on Graduation. Similar to its predecessor, Graduation wasn't restricted to the confines of conventional looping techniques typical of traditional hip-hop production. Instead, West continues to implement sudden musical shifts within the multi-layered song structures and express meticulously composed introductions, bridges, and codas. For his third album, West produced songs that combine hip-hop beats with anthemic refrains and continues to employ his skill in layering keys, strings, and vocals to coax the melodies out of samples. According to Sean Comer of 411Mania, Graduation is an ambitious album that demonstrates West's attentive ear to the blending of structure, melody, timing, evocative arrangement and their potential to rest comfortably alongside effective samples. Through acting as his own producer, West manages to maintain quality control over the album's music to ensure that [...] "his productions build momentum even when they revolve around a handful of repeated samples [...] nearly every song on Graduation is memorable for both its hooks and its overall sound." [...] And as the album progresses, its textures and the glossy <b>sheen</b> <b>of</b> its polished, synthesizer-driven productions become harder and denser with every track. Under the belief that his sophomore effort had been far too indulgent, poorly arranged, and oversaturated with unnecessary sonic accoutrements, West took measures to streamline his third release. West fashioned Graduation to contain less ornate production, made the studio album completely devoid of hip-hop skits, and sequenced the record {{in such a way}} that it produced a tighter, more cohesive package.|$|E
