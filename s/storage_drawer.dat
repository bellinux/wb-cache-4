50|$|There {{are four}} basic parts {{in a space}} toilet: the liquid waste vacuum tube, the vacuum chamber, the waste storage drawers, and the solid waste {{collection}} bags. The liquid waste vacuum tube is a 2 to 3 ft long rubber or plastic hose that {{is attached to the}} vacuum chamber and connected to a fan that provides suction. At the end of the tube there is a detachable urine receptacle, which come in different versions for male and female astronauts. The male urine receptacle is a plastic funnel two to three inches in width and about four inches deep. A male astronaut urinates directly into the funnel from a distance of two or three inches away. The female funnel is oval and is two inches by four inches wide at the rim. Near the funnel's rim are small holes or slits that allow air movement to prevent excessive suction. The vacuum chamber is a cylinder about 1 ft deep and six inches wide with clips on the rim where waste collection bags may be attached and a fan that provides suction. Urine is pumped into and stored in waste storage drawers. Solid waste is stored in a detachable bag made of a special fabric that lets gas (but not liquid or solid) escape, a feature that allows the fan {{at the back of the}} vacuum chamber to pull the waste into the bag. When the astronaut is finished, he or she then twists the bag and places it in a waste <b>storage</b> <b>drawer.</b> Samples of urine and solid waste are frozen and taken to Earth for testing.|$|E

5000|$|Modern {{excavations}} {{suggest that}} the Victory occupied a niche above a theater and also suggest it accompanied an altar that was within view of the ship monument of Demetrius I Poliorcetes (337-283 BC). Rendered in grey and white Thasian and Parian marble, the figure originally formed part of the Samothrace temple complex dedicated to the Great gods, Megaloi Theoi. It stood on a rostral pedestal of gray marble from Lartos representing the prow of a ship (most likely a trihemiolia), and represents the goddess as she descends from the skies to the triumphant fleet. Before she lost her arms, which have never been recovered, Nike's right arm {{is believed to have}} been raised, cupped round her mouth to deliver the shout of Victory. The work is notable for its convincing rendering of a pose where violent motion and sudden stillness meet, for its graceful balance and for the rendering of the figure's draped garments, compellingly depicted as if rippling in a strong sea breeze. Similar traits can be seen in the Laocoön group which is a reworked copy of a lost original that was likely close both in time and place of origin to Nike, but while Laocoon, vastly admired by Renaissance and classicist artists, has come to be seen [...] as a more self-conscious and contrived work, Nike of Samothrace is seen as an iconic depiction of triumphant spirit and of the divine momentarily coming face to face with man. The statue’s outstretched right wing is a symmetric plaster version of the original left one. As with the arms, the figure's head has never been found, but various other fragments have since been found: in 1950, a team led by Karl Lehmann unearthed the missing right hand of the Louvre's Winged Victory. The fingerless hand had slid out of sight under a large rock, near where the statue had originally stood; on the return trip home, Dr Phyllis Williams Lehmann identified the tip of the Goddess's ring finger and her thumb in a <b>storage</b> <b>drawer</b> at the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, where the second Winged Victory is displayed; the fragments have been reunited with the hand, which is now in a glass case in the Louvre next to the podium on which the statue stands.|$|E

40|$|A multi-temperature 4 drawer {{catering}} cabinet {{was designed}} to operate using a low-pressure receiver with capillary expansion to the separate evaporator in each drawer. Low-pressure receivers {{have been shown to}} be an effective way of allowing evaporators to operate in a fully flooded mode thus enabling more efficient use of the evaporator surface for heat transfer. If a low-pressure receiver is used in a refrigeration circuit the control of refrigerant flow into the evaporator is less critical as the expansion device is not responsible for preventing liquid returning to the compressor. Therefore, a capillary expansion device can be used effectively over a range of operating pressures. The system was shown to be effective at maintaining temperatures in the <b>storage</b> <b>drawers</b> during chilled, frozen and mixed storage temperature tests carried out to the EN 441 test standard. The cabinet operated successfully at all conditions except when the heat load in each drawer was excessive (> 400 W above base level heat load).
