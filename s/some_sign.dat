25|$|It is {{not clear}} how many sign {{languages}} there are. A common misconception is that all sign languages are the same worldwide or that sign language is international.

The 2013 edition of Ethnologue lists 137 sign languages. <b>Some</b> <b>sign</b> languages have obtained some form of legal recognition, while others have no status at all.|$|E
500|$|As the day progressed, British {{reinforcements}} {{that were}} originally left {{to guard the}} camp near the Modder River started to arrive—first the Gordon Highlanders and later the 1st and 2nd Coldstream Guards. At the same time, Cronjé launched a fresh attack on the British southern (right) flank {{in an attempt to}} extend a salient to the left and behind the remaining Highlanders, cutting them off from the main British force. Initially the Seaforths attempted to stem this attack and ran into the Scandinavian Corps, which they quickly neutralised. [...] The Seaforths then had to regroup, which prevented them from further action to halt the Boer attempts to encircle the Highland Brigade. The Grenadier Guards, with five companies of the King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry, were moved to counter the attack. [...] The British only showed <b>some</b> <b>sign</b> of success after the freshly arrived battalions of the Coldstream Guards were committed too. [...] But once the Coldstreams were committed, Methuen had engaged all of his reserves.|$|E

2500|$|An {{important}} {{precursor to}} deism {{was the work}} of Edward, Lord Herbert of Cherbury (d. 1648). He has been called the [...] "father of English deism", and his book De Veritate (On Truth, as It Is Distinguished from Revelation, the Probable, the Possible, and the False) (1624) [...] "the first major statement of deism". However, his beliefs in divine intervention, particularly in response to prayer, are at odds with the basic ideas of deism. In Herbert's account of one incident, he prayed [...] "I am not satisfied enough whether I shall publish this Book, De Veritate; if it be for Thy glory, I beseech Thee give me <b>some</b> <b>Sign</b> from Heaven, if not, I shall suppress it" [...] and recounts that the response was [...] "a loud tho' yet gentle Noise came from the Heavens (for it was like nothing on Earth)...

2500|$|Although Fermi's name is most {{commonly}} associated with the paradox, {{he was not the}} first to ask the question. An earlier implicit mention was by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky in an unpublished manuscript from 1933. He noted [...] "people deny the presence of intelligent beings on the planets of the universe" [...] because [...] "(i) if such beings exist they would have visited Earth, and (ii) if such civilizations existed then they would have given us <b>some</b> <b>sign</b> of their existence." [...] This was not a paradox for others, who took this to imply the absence of ETs, but it was for him, since he himself was a strong believer in extraterrestrial life and the possibility of space travel. [...] Therefore, he proposed what is now known as the zoo hypothesis and speculated that mankind is not yet ready for higher beings to contact us. That Tsiolkovsky himself {{may not have been the}} first to discover the paradox is suggested by his above-mentioned reference to other people's reasons for denying the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations.|$|E
