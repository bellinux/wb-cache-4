5|$|In 1946 Secretary of State Dean Acheson {{appointed}} Thomas {{to serve}} on a panel with Robert Oppenheimer, David Lilienthal, Chester I. Barnard and Harry Winne to appraise international atomic inspection, culminating in the Acheson–Lilienthal Report. In 1951 Truman appointed Thomas to the Science Advisory Committee, an eleven-man committee of prominent scientists to advise on defense planning. In 1953 President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed him a scientific consultant to the National <b>Security</b> <b>Council,</b> <b>and</b> he was the U.S. Representative to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission.

It {{is a member of the}} G7, G20, and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Almost all countries have embassies in Washington, D.C., and many have consulates around the country. Likewise, nearly all nations host American diplomatic missions. However, Iran, North Korea, Bhutan, and the Republic of China (Taiwan) do not have formal diplomatic relations with the United States (although the U.S. still maintains relations with Taiwan and supplies it with military equipment).|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} restored {{confidence in}} the British forces operating in Sierra Leone, which had been undermined by the capture of the Royal Irish patrol. After the operation, the British government increased its support of UNAMSIL and its efforts to bring the civil war to an end, both politically, through the United Nations <b>Security</b> <b>Council,</b> <b>and</b> through the provision of staff officers to support UNAMSIL. The successful use of 1 PARA in Operation Barras influenced {{the creation of the}} Special Forces Support Group—a permanent unit, initially built around 1 PARA, whose role is to act as a force multiplier for British special forces on large or complex operations.|$|E
5|$|As the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Belarusian Armed Forces, the President has {{the duty}} to protect the Belarusian {{territory}} from internal and external forces.

5|$|Five ECMM {{observers}} {{were killed in}} the attack, including four Italians and one Frenchman. The victims were Lieutenant Colonel Enzo Venturini, helicopter pilot, Staff Sergeant Marco Matta, co-pilot, Sergeant Major Fiorenzo Ramacci, Sergeant Major Silvano Natale, and Ship-of-the-line Lieutenant Jean-Loup Eychenne. The Italian personnel were drawn from the 5th Army Aviation Regiment Rigel. The second helicopter carried a diplomat and three Italian ECMM observers, none of whom were harmed. The crash site was toured by the police, ECMM staff and journalists, and EC representatives visited Belgrade to receive a report on the incident from Yugoslav authorities. The action of the Yugoslav Air Force was condemned by the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, the United Nations <b>Security</b> <b>Council,</b> <b>and</b> the EC Council of Ministers. The Italian ambassador to Yugoslavia was recalled to Rome for consultations. Subsequently, Italy cancelled an air traffic agreement with Yugoslavia, causing Jat Airways to cancel Belgrade–Rome flights. In addition, ECMM operations were suspended for several days.|$|E
5|$|From 1943 to 1945, he coordinated Manhattan Project work on {{plutonium}} purification and production. He also coordinated {{development of}} techniques to industrially refine polonium {{for use with}} beryllium in the triggers of atomic weapons in the Manhattan Project's Dayton Project, part of which {{was conducted on the}} estate of his wife's family. Shortly before the war ended, he took over the management of the Clinton Laboratories in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Monsanto pulled out of Oak Ridge in December 1947, but became the operator of the Mound Laboratories in 1948. Secretary of State Dean Acheson appointed Thomas to serve on a 1946 panel to appraise international atomic inspection, which culminated in the Acheson–Lilienthal Report. In 1953 he was appointed as a consultant to the National <b>Security</b> <b>Council,</b> <b>and</b> served as U.S. Representative to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission.|$|E
5|$|The 1992 European Community Monitor Mission {{helicopter}} downing was {{an incident}} that occurred on 7 January 1992, during the Croatian War of Independence, in which a European Community Monitor Mission (ECMM) helicopter carrying five European Community (EC) observers was downed by a Yugoslav Air Force Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21, in the air space above the village of Podrute, near Novi Marof, Croatia. An Italian and a French officer and three Italian non-commissioned officers were killed. Another ECMM helicopter flying in formation with the attacked helicopter made an emergency landing. The second helicopter carried a crew and a visiting diplomat, all of whom survived. The incident was condemned by the United Nations <b>Security</b> <b>Council</b> <b>and</b> the EC. As {{a result of the}} incident, the Yugoslav authorities suspended the head of the air force, and the Yugoslav defense minister, General Veljko Kadijević, resigned his post. The events followed {{the end of the first}} stage of the war in Croatia and closely preceded the country's international recognition.|$|E

Under the authority of the Secretary of the Navy, the CMC designates Marine personnel and resources to the commanders of Unified Combatant Commands. The Commandant performs all other functions prescribed in Section 5043 in Title 10 of the United States Code or delegates those duties and responsibilities to other officers in his administration in his name. As with the other joint chiefs, the Commandant is an administrative position and has no operational command authority over United States Marine Corps forces.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} of Kenya and the National Assembly both attempted {{to stop the}} ICC process. The government appealed to both the United Nations <b>Security</b> <b>Council</b> <b>and</b> the Court itself regarding the admissibility of the case. The National Assembly voted in favour of removing Kenya as a state party to the Rome Statute, the international treaty which established the ICC. Despite this opposition, the suspects cooperated with the proceedings and attended preliminary hearings in The Hague in April 2011 and confirmation of charges hearings in September of that year. The Pre-Trial Chamber II confirmed the charges against Kenyatta, Ruto, and Sang and declined to confirm the charges against Ali, Kosgey, and Muthaura. The trial of Ruto and Sang began on 10 September 2013, while that of Kenyatta is supposed to begin on 5 February 2014. However the Chief prosecuter has asked that the case be adjourned citing lack of enough evidence required for trial.|$|E
5|$|The Nizam {{was also}} beset by the Telangana Rebellion, led by communists, {{which started in}} 1946 as a peasant revolt against feudal elements; and one which the Nizam {{was not able to}} subjugate. The {{situation}} deteriorated further in 1948. The Razakars ("volunteers"), a militia affiliated to the Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen and set up under the influence of Muslim radical Qasim Razvi, assumed the role of supporting the Muslim ruling class against upsurges by the Hindu populace, and began intensifying its activities and was accused of attempting to intimidate villages. The Hyderabad State Congress Party, affiliated to the Indian National Congress, launched a political agitation. Matters were made worse by communist groups, which had originally supported the Congress but now switched sides and began attacking Congress groups. Attempts by Mountbatten to find a negotiated solution failed and, in August, the Nizam, claiming that he feared an imminent invasion, attempted to approach the UN <b>Security</b> <b>Council</b> <b>and</b> the International Court of Justice. Patel now insisted that if Hyderabad was allowed to continue its independence, the prestige of the Government would be tarnished and then neither Hindus nor Muslims would feel secure in its realm.|$|E

5|$|There {{were several}} more {{attempts}} to advocate the Z-4 Plan {{as the basis}} of a political settlement of the Croatian War of Independence. After Croatia captured western Slavonia from the RSK in Operation Flash in early May, Owen and Stoltenberg invited Croatian and RSK officials to Geneva in an effort to revive the plan. The initiative was endorsed by the UN <b>Security</b> <b>Council</b> <b>and</b> the G7, which was preparing its summit in Halifax at the time. The meeting was attended by Owen, Stoltenberg, Galbraith, Kerestedjiants, Eide and Ahrens as the international diplomats; the RSK was represented by Martić, Mikelić and Babić, and the Croatian delegation was led by Šarinić. Šarinić accepted the invitation, claiming that the venue was a Croatian concession because Croatian authorities considered the issue an internal matter which should normally be dealt with in Croatia. On the other hand, the RSK delegation insisted on Croatian withdrawal from the territory captured earlier that month before negotiations could proceed. Since no such withdrawal was requested by the UN Security Council, Croatia rejected the demand and the initiative collapsed.|$|E
