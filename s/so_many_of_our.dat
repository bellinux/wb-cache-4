Vanity Fair Brett Berk found [...] "Journey to Regionals" [...] a fulfilling, albeit [...] "pretty mediocre" [...] episode, describing it as having [...] "a sense of narrative cohesion that went beyond the writers’ usual throwing-flatware-down-the-garburator modality". Jean Bentley of MTV found the episode representative of the first season as a whole, explaining: [...] "Much like the entire first year of the show, the uneven episode started out with a promising, action-packed plot, impressed with a couple of flashy musical numbers, then got too cheesy for its own good and petered out with an overly sentimental song." [...] Fellow MTV writer Aly Semigran noted: [...] "I was hoping for a little more excitement from the episode, though it all did feel very full circle for <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> characters we've come to know and love.

Most of the Sovietologists, on the other hand, were left-liberal in their politics, an orientation that undermined their capacity to accept the view that economic statism, planning, socialist incentives, would not work.

As a result of this ubiquity, any film about young love and its challenges will court comparison with Romeo and Juliet, as Roseanna McCoy did in 1949, and two James Dean films – East of Eden and Rebel Without a Cause – did in the 1950s.|$|E

This piece overviews the risks of accelerated living and then provides possible solutions to these problems and suggestions to help us slow down.
