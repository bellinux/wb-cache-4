For, supposing that we {{were for}} a moment to {{consider}} that we built a house merely to be lived in, and that the whole bent of our invention, in raising the edifice, is to be directed to the provision of comfort for the life to be spent therein; supposing that we build it with the most perfect dryness and coolness of cellar, the most luxurious appurtenances of pantry; that we build our walls with the most compacted <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>material,</b> the most studied economy of space; that we leave not a chink in the floor for a breath of wind to pass through, not a hinge in the door, which, by any possible exertion of its irritable muscles, could creak; that we elevate our chambers into exquisite coolness, furnish them with every attention to the maintenance of general health, as well as the prevention of present inconvenience: to do all this, we must be possessed of great knowledge and various skill; let this knowledge and skill be applied with the greatest energy, and what have they done? Exactly as much as brute animals can do by mere instinct; nothing more than bees and beavers, moles and magpies, ants and earwigs, do every day of their lives, without the slightest effort of reason; we have made ourselves superior as architects to the most degraded animation of the universe, only insomuch as we have lavished the highest efforts of intellect, to do what they have done with the most limited sensations that can constitute life.|$|E

40|$|Abstract ⎯This paper {{discusses}} {{development of}} an instrument for assessing undergraduate student understanding <b>of</b> fundamental <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> concepts. The instrument was modeled after the Force Concept Inventory (FCI) by David Hestenes and others. Like the FCI, the <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> concept inventory is brief, requires no computation and should be repeatable across broad student populations. The initial version of the instrument was tested on <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> students at the University of Alabama, Texas A&M University, and other institutions. A Beta version of the instrument {{will be available at}} the conference. Index Terms ⎯Concept inventory, assessment instrument, <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials...</b>|$|R

50|$|Typically, the {{porosity}} {{percent of}} trabecular bone {{is in the}} range 75-95% and the density ranges from 0.2 to 0.8g/cm3. It is noted that the porosity can reduce {{the strength of the}} bone, but also reduce its weight. The porosity and the manner that porosity is structured effect the <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>material.</b> Thus, the micro structure of trabecular bone is typically oriented and grain of porosity is aligned in a direction at which mechanical stiffness and strength are greatest. Because of the microstructual directionality, the mechanical properties of trabecular bone is highly an-isotropic. The range of young's modulus for trabecular bone is 800-14000 Mpa and the strength of failure is 1-100 Mpa.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} {{disadvantages}} to a tall rig. Firstly, {{it makes the}} boat less stable. If the sails are tall, the wind tends to push the boat over (the center of effort of the sail pushes sideways higher on the mast). A boat is also more tippy {{if it has a}} taller mast or heavy spars high up (such as the gaff on a gaff rig). An outrigger, ballast, and/or a long keel is needed to keep the boat upright. Secondly, a taller rig makes it harder to hold the mast onto the boat (with the standing rigging). Generally, taller rigs are more highly stressed structures than shorter rigs. This makes them more expensive and more fragile for a given <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>material.</b> Stronger, cheaper modern materials are one reason why shorter, squarer rigs are becoming rare.|$|E
50|$|From Allmusic.com (April 2009, by Ken Dryden) With {{his debut}} {{recording}} as a leader, trombonist and jazz educator Tom Brantley offers a versatile release, including both established and new compositions and live and studio performances, {{as well as}} a variety of different bands. Highly recommended. From Jazzreview.com (April 2009) Trombones ring loud and clear during this hybrid, live-studio date. Leading a large ensemble, top-flight bone-man Tom Brantley launches a vibrant modern mainstream gala, featuring originals and interesting spins on time-honored standards. Brantley’s corpulent tone and fluid attack combines hefty doses of improvisation with acute reinventions of a given melody line. Brantley executes sublime and mood-eliciting balladry. No doubt about it, Brantley has formulated a divergent set, complete with works that span various cadences and storylines. The <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> and memorable arrangements translate into an endeavor that pronounces intelligence, wit, and plain old savvy, to complement the performers’ zealous soloing jaunts.|$|E

50|$|Nonwoven fabrics are {{broadly defined}} as sheet or web {{structures}} bonded together by entangling fiber or filaments (and by perforating films) mechanically, thermally or chemically. They are flat or tufted porous sheets {{that are made}} directly from separate fibers, molten plastic or plastic film. They are not made by weaving or knitting and do not require converting the fibers to yarn. Typically, {{a certain percentage of}} recycled fabrics and oil-based materials are used in nonwoven fabrics. The percentage of recycled fabrics vary based upon the <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> needed for the specific use. In addition, some nonwoven fabrics can be recycled after use, given the proper treatment and facilities. For this reason, some consider nonwovens a more ecological fabric for certain applications, especially in fields and industries where disposable or single use products are important, such as hospitals, schools, nursing homes and luxury accommodations.|$|E
