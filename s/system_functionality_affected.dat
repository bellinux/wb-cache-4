40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{object-oriented}} {{designs are}} approached from an information theoretic {{point of view}} and entropy is proposed as a design quality metric. One of the primary aims of object-orientation is the flexibility and the ease in extending a <b>system’s</b> <b>functionality,</b> with limited alterations to existing modules. This feature is evaluated defining an appropriate probability space according to the number of unary associations enabling the definition of an entropy metric. The entropy of the next generation of an object-oriented <b>system</b> with enhanced <b>functionality</b> remains close to its previous level in case the added <b>functionality</b> <b>affects</b> a limited number of existing classes; on the other hand, a poorly designed system increases entropy drastically. In this way, not only a given system is evaluated but it is also possible to assess the degradation of a system and its “distance ” from the original design. ...|$|R

These sources are involved in knowledge fusion processes to support the <b>systems</b> <b>functionalities.</b> The core of the methodology is knowledge fusion patterns. They characterize knowledge sources involved in the knowledge fusion processes in terms of preservation/change of the sources' autonomies and structures. In the methodology, the patterns are used to specify the requirements to the knowledge sources from the systems to ensure the full <b>systems</b> <b>functionalities.</b> Matching the <b>system's</b> requirements against the user's requirements to the <b>system</b> <b>functionality</b> and the user's constraints on the sources of information and knowledge enables to offer feasible <b>system</b> <b>functionality</b> to the users. </div...|$|R

We propose a way to perform product ongoing evaluation, thus enabling software teams to perform interface usability evaluation alongside automated <b>system</b> <b>functionality</b> testing. We use formal task models, created in our defined TaMoGolog task modeling language, to conduct product evaluation experiments through TaMUlator.

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} a downlink OFDMA transmission {{system in which}} an infrastructure-based relay node is deployed for extending the coverage of a base station. Focusing on decode-andforward (DF) operation, we study how different relay <b>functionalities</b> <b>affect</b> the <b>system</b> performance. The <b>functionalities</b> include fixed or adaptive subcarrier pairing, information redistribution, buffering, and adjustment of the time shares allocated for the two hops. In particular, it is of great interest for system design {{to be able to}} evaluate the performance gains due to each functionality, because they {{come at the expense of}} increased complexity and cost of the relay architecture. The main contribution of the paper is to analyze the performance of the proposed protocols by deriving new closed-form expressions for the average end-to-end capacity. The calculated expressions facilitate the performance comparison between the different functionalities. I...|$|R

40|$|Research area – {{applying}} formal {{methods in}} describing and modeling {{of the complex}} <b>systems</b> <b>functionalities</b> together with verification and validation of designed specifications. The research {{is based on the}} use of Piece-Linear Aggregates, which allows creating modules for analyses of the <b>system</b> <b>functionality</b> and <b>system</b> correctness. The purpose of this work is transformation of UML activity model into PLA model in order to assess the characteristics of <b>system</b> <b>functionality.</b> These characteristics can show how system is operating and which parts of the system can be improved. PLA – Piece-Linear Aggregates formalism is used for modeling various systems. PLA is universal formal modeling language. In this specification process models are expressed in textual and mathematical expressions. The main idea of this approach - divide the system into piece linear aggregates each of which describe the use of control sequences. Using this method the formalized business processes are displayed as a set of interacting aggregates. The aggregate is an object, defined by a set of states Z, incoming signals X and outgoing signals Y. The final result of the research is the assessment the National Business Registration System in the Vietnam. Assessment allows to evaluate characteristics of the <b>system</b> <b>functionality</b> using PLA modeling method and identify the weakest point in the system in order to propose possible improvement and optimization methods...|$|R
