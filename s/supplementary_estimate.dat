Second, in 1989 the Senate adopted procedures for the systematic referral of bills to committees, increasing the level of legislative scrutiny taking place within parliament. Third, in 1993, the committees adopted a more extensive procedure for consideration of the budget, creating a second opportunity each year for Senators to follow up issues identified during the initial budget estimates hearings.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis {{was to examine the}} geotechnical conditions at the Engeb&# 248;fjell in Naustdal Municipality, Sogn og Fjordane, Norway with regard to a proposed open pit mine there. Another aim was to develop design parameters for the mine, i. e. bench angles, inter-ramp slope angles and overall slope angles. Finally, the economical ramifications of changes in the design parameters were examined. Geotechnical field mapping campaigns were conducted according to described standards and the results were processed by methods such as stereographic analysis in Rocsciences Dips 6. 0. In addition, previously drilled cores were re-examined to extract geotechnical information, such as Rock Quality Designation (RQD). Using gathered data, the pit area was divided into geotechnical domains, and a kinematic analysis was performed for each domain. The analyses were carried out in Dips 6. 0 as well. Empirical methods were applied to find <b>supplementary</b> <b>estimates</b> of overall slope angle and rock mass conditions. Rock Mass Ratings (RMR) were calculated for each of the domains. The Barton-Bandis failure criterion was used in conjunction with tilt tests to estimate the shear strength of the discontinuities in the rock mass. Scale corrections were applied to the Joint Roughness Coefficient (JRC) and the Joint Compressive Strength (JCS). It is concluded that three separate joint sets exist in the rock mass and that their dip-directions are: West (steep), North (steep) and SSW (low incline). The discontinuities have tight apertures with a moderate spacing and are commonly fresh and clean, however some staining was observed. The persistence of the discontinuities was concluded to lie in the interval 3 - 10 m. Results from the rock mass analysis indicated good rock mass quality. The following scale corrected results stem from the field mapping: JRC is approximately 7 and JCS=[56, 115]MPa(depending on lithology). Basic friction angles were found to lie in the region [25 deg, 32 deg], which implicated joint friction angles of [46 deg}, 54 deg}]. Based on the kinematic analysis it is concluded that maximum stable bench face angles can be in the range of [60 deg, 80 deg],while inter-ramp angles are [47 deg, 63 deg]and overall slope angles are [45 deg, 59 deg]. Different stability problems were expected to occur in different regions of the pit: the northern part was exposed to toppling, the south-western to planar failure and the south-eastern to both wedge and planar failure. The large scale stability of the pit has been discussed and it was concluded that large scale structures could affect the stability of the pit, and since these are likely to be parallel to the discontinuity sets further efforts should be directed towards uncovering such features. Drilling cores perpendicular to the expected orientations was recommended. It is noted that, should such features be encountered, the frictional properties of each one of them must be estimated. It has been shown that the benefits of steepening an open pit wall are significant for the project as a whole. Recommendations to couple sensitivity analyses of pit design parameters with the geotechnical investigations were made. In this way, the money that is set aside for geotechnical work will be put to the best possible use. </p...|$|R

As could have been expected, average daily wages are lower – by up to   10   Euros – for individuals receiving a subsidy for hard-to-place workers than for those receiving one for training requirements. While their average employment shares over time are also lower, the difference in employment shares compared to a matched comparison group is higher, which indicates a higher effectiveness of the program for individuals with more severe obstacles to reintegration into the labor market.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we develop {{goodness}} of fit tests of the generalized linear model with non-canonical links for data that are extensive but sparse. We derive approximations to the first three moments of the deviance statistic. A <b>supplementary</b> <b>estimating</b> equation is proposed from which the modified deviance statistic is obtained. Applications of the modified deviance statistic to binomial and Poisson data are shown. A simulation study is conducted to compare the behavior, in terms of size and power, of the modified deviance statistic and the modified Pearson statistic developed earlier by Farrington (1996). Three sets of data with different degrees, of sparseness and different link functions are analyzed. The simulation results and examples indicate that both the modified Pearson statistic and the modified deviance statistic perform well in terms of holding nominal levels. However, the modified deviance statistic shows much better power properties for the range of parameters investigated under the alternative hypothesis. Theses results also answer a question posed by Farrington (1996) and extend results of McCullagh (1986) for Poisson log-linear models. In some instances a score or a C(alpha) statistic performs well. In this thesis we also develop a score test statistic to assess {{goodness of fit}} of the generalized linear model for data that are extensive but sparse. The performance of this statistic is then compared with the modified Pearson statistic. Results of simulation show that both the modified score test statistic developed in our paper and the modified Pearson statistic developed by Farrington (1996) maintain nominal levels. However the modified score test has some edge over the modified Pearson statistic in terms of power. In practice, sometimes, discrete data contain excess zeros {{that can not be}} explained by a simple model. In this thesis we develop score tests for testing zero-inflation in generalized linear models. These score tests are then applied to binomial models and Poisson models and their performances are evaluated. A limited simulation study shows that the score tests reasonably maintain the nominal levels. The power of the tests for detecting zero-inflation increases very slowly for Poisson mean mu or binomial parameter p. For large values of mu and p power increases very fast and approaches 1. 0 even for moderate zero-inflation. A discrete generalized linear model (Poisson or binomial) may fall to fit a set of data having a lot of zeros either because of zero-inflation only, because of over-dispersion only, or because there is zero-inflation as well as over-dispersion in the data. In this thesis we obtain score tests (i) for zero-inflation in presence of over-dispersion, (ii) for over-dispersion in presence of zero-inflation, and (iii) simultaneously for testing for zero-inflation and over-dispersion. For Poisson and binomial data these score tests are compared with those obtained from the zero-inflated negative binomial model and the zero-inflated beta-binomial model. Some simulations are performed for Poisson data to study type I error properties of the tests. In general the score tests developed here hold nominal levels reasonably well. The data sets are analyzed to illustrate model section procedure by the score tests. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) Dept. of Mathematics and Statistics.

DNA extracted from these harvests was subjected to real-time PCR. A critical time point for the harvesting of PLT cells infected with various log 10 dilutions of vaccine virus {{was found to be}} 42 h (highest slope of 3. 335), which was obtained by comparing the slopes of standard curves of different time intervals. The assay was employed to evaluate viable virus content in different batches of orf vaccine. The titres estimated by real-time PCR and conventional TCID 50 were comparable with a correlation of 0. 8169. Thus, the real-time PCR assay could provide an alternative method or <b>supplementary</b> tool to <b>estimate</b> live ORFV particles in attenuated orf vaccine...|$|R
