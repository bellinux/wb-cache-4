40|$|Despite the {{resolving power}} of DNA markers, pelagic and migratory marine fish species {{generally}} show very little geographical population structuring. In mackerel (Scomber scombrus L.) population differentiation has been detected {{only at a}} transatlantic scale. By applying two regions in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) (D-loop and cytochrome b (cytb)) in combination with genealogical and frequency-based statistical approaches, our data suggest population differentiation among eastern Atlantic <b>spawning</b> <b>stocks.</b> In contrast, and indicative of homing behaviour, no genetic structuring was observed among shoals of individuals outside the spawning season. Among <b>spawning</b> <b>stocks,</b> mtDNA D-loop sequences detected differentiation within the eastern Atlantic, while the cytb gene detected transatlantic differentiation. The impact of recurrent events (e. g. gene flow restricted by isolation by distance) and historic events (e. g. population range expansions) among <b>spawning</b> <b>stocks</b> was investigated applying a nested cladistic analysis of geographical distribution of cytb haplotype lineages. In the eastern Atlantic, historical population range expansion, presumably in connection with recolonization of northern areas after the last glaciation, is suggested {{to be the main}} factor determining mtDNA lineage distribution.

2500|$|To {{support this}} hypothesis, Reuben Lasker cited the {{disconnect}} between <b>spawning</b> <b>stock</b> biomass and {{the recruitment of}} numerous fish species. One explanation of this disconnect suggests larval recruitment is influenced by spatial and temporal patterns of their food, like phytoplankton or zooplankton, which can be greatly affected by ocean currents and mixing. In his publication Marine fish larvae: Morphology, ecology, and relation to fisheries (1981), he points out, for example, the Peruvian anchovy fishery collapse that resulted from a dramatic decrease in population size during the early 1970s. [...] Officials and researchers from the Peruvian government and United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization submitted that the causal factors were a combination of strong fishing pressure and weak year classes that resulted in insufficient reproduction and recruitment to support the fishery. This explanation seemed to explain the diminished population trends of similar species from other regions, including the Pacific and Japanese sardines and the Atlanto-Scandian herring.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The use of {{geographic}} information systems (GIS) to support ecosystem management involves the input and participation of groups who {{make use of}} fisheries species. Recent provisions for essential fish habitat (EFH) in the Magnuson-Stevens Conservation and Management Act emphasize the conservation of fisheries habitats. Artificial reefs can now qualify as EFH. Artificial reefs should be managed to conserve and enhance fisheries production. Recent research indicates that artificial reefs primarily provide shelter from predation and that the associated fishes forage over surrounding areas. Hence, the placement of artificial reefs in suitable habitats, determined {{with the aid of}} GIS, is needed to properly manage reef fishes. Research involving the use of artificial reefs tied to zoning strategies is a positive approach to assessing the best means to protect estuarine and marine habitats, to enhance <b>spawning</b> <b>stocks,</b> and to manage reef fisheries. The placement of artificial reefs in Ano-take@ marine reserves and in surrounding fishing zones is being proposed to protect <b>spawning</b> <b>stocks</b> of reef fishes, while providing separate areas for diving and for fishing. The development of regional zoning strategies and community-based participation will be necessary to implement this type of marine ecosystem management...|$|R

40|$|Cephalopods are {{becoming}} increasingly important in global fisheries {{as a result of}} increased landings and are playing an important ecological role in the trophic dynamics of marine ecosystems. Ommastrephes bartramii is a pelagic cephalopod species with two widely distributed <b>spawning</b> <b>stocks</b> in the North Pacific Ocean. It is also a major fishing target for the Chinese squid jigging fleets. Successful separation of these two <b>spawning</b> <b>stocks</b> is critical to fisheries management, but tends to be challenging because of their similar morphology. In this study we attempted to identify the stocks based on discriminant analyses of 9 morphological variables of statolith and 12 variables of beaks measured for O. bartramii samples in the North Pacific. A significant difference was revealed in the standardized beak and statolith variables between sexes in the northeast (NE) stock (P 0. 05), whereas the NW stock showed no significant difference in either sex for the statolith variables (P > 0. 05). The same sex also revealed different patterns with different hard structures between the two stocks. In t-tests females showed significant differences between stocks in statolith morphology (P 0. 05), but showed no difference between cohorts (P > 0. 05) in beak morphometric variables. With the combination of two standardized hard parts, correct classification of stepwise discriminant analysis (SDA) was raised by nearly 20 % compared with using only one structure, although overlaps of the NW stock were still found in the scatter-plots. It is concluded that adding more appropriate hard structure variables will effectively increase the success of separating geographic stocks by the SDA method...|$|R
40|$|Severe climatic {{disturbance}} events {{often have}} major impacts on coral reef communities, generating cycles of decline and recovery, {{and in some}} extreme cases, community-level phase shifts from coral- to algal-dominated states. Benthic habitat changes directly affect reef fish communities, with low coral cover usually associated with low fish diversity and abundance. No-take marine reserves (NTRs) are widely advocated for conserving biodiversity and enhancing the sustainability of exploited fish populations. Numerous studies have documented positive ecological and socio-economic benefits of NTRs; however, the ability of NTRs to ameliorate the effects of acute disturbances on coral reefs has seldom been investigated. Here, we test these factors by tracking the dynamics of benthic and fish communities, including the important fishery species, coral trout (Plectropomus spp.), over 8 years in both NTRs and fished areas in the Keppel Island group, Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Two major disturbances impacted the reefs during the monitoring period, a coral bleaching event in 2006 and a freshwater flood plume in 2011. Both disturbances generated significant declines in coral cover and habitat complexity, with subsequent declines in fish abundance and diversity, and pronounced shifts in fish assemblage structure. Coral trout density also declined {{in response to the}} loss of live coral, however, the approximately 2 : 1 density ratio between NTRs and fished zones was maintained over time. The only post-disturbance refuges for coral trout <b>spawning</b> <b>stocks</b> were within the NTRs that escaped the worst effects of the disturbances. Although NTRs had little discernible effect on the temporal dynamics of benthic or fish communities, it was evident that the post-disturbance refuges for coral trout <b>spawning</b> <b>stocks</b> within some NTRs may be critically important to regional-scale population persistence and recovery...|$|R
40|$|Stocking {{with eggs}} {{has been widely}} used as a {{management}} measure to support degraded salmonid stocks. In Finland, Atlantic salmon and both seamigrating and lake-migrating brown trout are stocked as eggs, alevins, fry, parr, and smolt, whereas trout are also stocked as mature fish. The aim of this stocking is to improve catches and to support collapsed <b>spawning</b> <b>stocks.</b> We assessed the success of stocking with brown trout eggs {{in a study of}} 17 Finnish boreal forest rivers, of which 9 were subject to egg stocking. All rivers contained some naturally spawning trout. In 16 rivers, including non-stocking years and unstocked rivers, egg stocking did not increase the total (wild and stocked) density of 0 -year-old parr. However, those rivers with higher existing trout densities in non-stocking years seemed to benefit most from stocking, suggesting some role of river-specific extrinsic factors affecting egg-to-parr survival. In one river monitored for 14 years, only a weak correlation was found between the total density of 0 -year-old parr and the number of eggs stocked. However, in nine parr samples from five rivers, the mean proportion of parr derived from stocked eggs was 40 %. The mean survival to first autumn parr of egg-stocked and wild individuals was 1. 0 and 3. 3 %, respectively. Probable reasons for the detected low to moderate impact of egg-stocking are (i) large variation in total parr density between years and rivers, (ii) small number of stocked eggs, (iii) placing egg boxes and egg pockets in unsuitable microhabitats, and (iv) unsuitable emergence time of egg-stocked individuals, or other extrinsic factors creating extra mortality. We recommend field and laboratory experiments to improve and standardize stocking methods, and monitoring the connection of wild <b>spawning</b> <b>stocks</b> and parr recruitment.

50|$|Biological {{reference}} points {{are the primary}} output of stock assessments and fishing regulations are set to meet these biological benchmarks. There are several types of benchmarks are used depending on the preference of the regulating agency. The benchmarks are used to control {{different aspects of the}} fishery or population.

Fcurr is the current level of fishing mortality, Fmsy is the fishing mortality that produces the maximum sustainable yield, and Emsy is the expected level of fishing that will produce the maximum sustainable yield. SSBcurr, SSBmsy, and MSST are used in the regulation of biomass levels. SSBcurr stands for the current <b>spawning</b> <b>stock</b> biomass, SSBmsy is the amount of <b>spawning</b> <b>stock</b> biomass needed to produce the maximum sustainable yield, and MSST is the minimum standing stock threshold. The amount that is available to be harvested is controlled by the benchmarks MSY and OY. MSY is the maximum sustainable yield and OY is the optimum yield of a stock.

Average redd length was 1. 71 m, water depth 57 cm, and water current velocity in three cm above bottom surface 27 cm/s. Most common dominant gravel size was 64 − 128 mm in pot and 32 − 64 mm in tail. Both natural and artificial gravel were important as spawning grounds, but gravel carried in with buckets by volunteers produced much more redds per gravel volume than gravel deposited with an excavator. Most often, redds were situated in small pools or holes inside riffle sections, but also in upstream edges of riffles in some larger rapids. About 70 % of redds were situated no more than 50 cm from a shelter, like a stone or a channel bank.
