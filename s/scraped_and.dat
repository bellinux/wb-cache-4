5|$|Yelp began {{a service}} called Yelp Deals in April 2011, but by August it {{cut back on}} Deals due to {{increased}} competition and market saturation. That September, the Federal Trade Commission investigated Yelp's allegations that Google was using Yelp web content without authorization and that Google's search engine algorithms favored Google Places over similar services provided by Yelp. In a January 2014 agreement, Google was not subject to anti-trust litigation from the FTC, but did have to allow services like Yelp the ability {{to opt out of}} having their data <b>scraped</b> <b>and</b> used on Google's websites.|$|E

25|$|Until {{cleaning}} {{of the remaining}} marbles was completed in 2005, black crusts and coatings were present on the marble surface. The laser technique applied on the 14 slabs that Elgin did not remove revealed a surprising array of original details, such as the original chisel marks and the veins on the horses' bellies. Similar features in the British Museum collection have been <b>scraped</b> <b>and</b> scrubbed with chisels to make the marbles look white. Between January 20 {{and the end of}} March 2008, 4200 items (sculptures, inscriptions small terracotta objects), including some 80 artefacts dismantled from the monuments in recent years, were removed from the old museum on the Acropolis to the new Parthenon Museum. Natural disasters have also affected the Parthenon. In 1981, an earthquake caused damage to the east façade.|$|E
25|$|Seamen's pay rates {{had been}} {{established}} in 1658, {{and because of the}} stability of wages and prices, they were still reasonable as recently as the 1756–1763 Seven Years' War; however, high inflation during the last decades of the 18th century had thus severely eroded the real value of the pay. In recent years, pay raises had also been granted to the army, militia, and naval officers. At the same time, the practice of coppering the submerged part of hulls, which had started in 1761, meant that British warships no longer had to return to port frequently to have their hulls <b>scraped,</b> <b>and</b> the additional time at sea significantly altered the rhythm and difficulty of seamen's work. The Royal Navy had not made adjustments for any of these changes, and was slow to understand their effects on its crews. Finally, the new wartime quota system meant that crews had many landsmen from inshore who did not mix well with the career seamen, leading to discontented ships' companies.|$|E
25|$|In {{some places}} in India, the corpse may {{be carried out}} of the house from the side door, rather than the front door so that the {{deceased}} does not find her way back in the house. If a woman dies during childbirth or during her menstrual cycle, her “corpse is anointed with five different products of the cow and special texts are recited.” In the Hilly regions, the place where a pregnant woman died is carefully <b>scraped</b> <b>and</b> the earth removed. The spot is then sown with mustard (sarson), which is also sprinkled along the road traversed by the corpse {{on its way to the}} burial ground. The reason behind this is that the mustard blossoms in the world of the dead, and the sweet smell pleases the spirit and keeps her content, so that she does not long to revisit her earthly home; secondly, the Churel rises from her grave at nightfall and seeks to return to her friends but when she sees the minute grains of the mustard scattered abroad and stoops to pick it up, and while she is engaged, the sun rises and she is unable to visit her home. This story also tells us that the Churel usually only comes out during the night.|$|E

2500|$|Ancestral Puebloans {{are also}} known for their pottery. In general, pottery used for cooking or storage in the region was {{unpainted}} gray, either smooth or textured. Pottery used for more formal purposes was often more richly adorned. In the northern or [...] "Anasazi" [...] portion of the Ancestral Pueblo world, from about 500 to 1300 AD, the most common decorated pottery had black-painted designs on white or light gray backgrounds. Decoration is characterized by fine hatching, and contrasting colors are produced {{by the use of}} mineral-based paint on a chalky background. South of the Anasazi territory, in Mogollon settlements, pottery was more often hand-coiled, <b>scraped,</b> <b>and</b> polished, with red to brown coloring.|$|E

Minor repairs, including repairs to the donkey boiler, guards and rails were also completed by Neafie & Levy. The inner hull was scraped, sealed and coated with red lead during the summer by the Ice Boat Dept. caretakers, who also ground the engine valves, cleaned the boilers and [...] "shedded over" [...] the decks for protection from the summer sun. The Department's end-of-year annual report noted that the decks of all three ice boats required renewal, as they were leaking and had [...] "been patched so often that but little of the original decks remain".|$|E

2500|$|The {{final game}} of the season matched Michigan against Amos Alonzo Stagg's Chicago Maroons. The game was played on Thanksgiving Day in front of more than 6,000 spectators at Marshall Field in Chicago. Due to the inclement weather, the field had to be [...] "carefully <b>scraped</b> <b>and</b> sawdust {{scattered}} over the thin layer of ice" [...] before the game began. Michigan's first scoring drive came in the first half when the right halfback, John Hollister, took the ball on Chicago's 45-yard line and ran around the right end for a 35-yard gain, a play the press called [...] "a prettily-executed criss cross." [...] Later in the drive, Henninger fumbled the ball which rolled beyond the goal line where it was recovered by Richards for the game's first touchdown. The running of Michigan's fullback John Bloomingston, a Chicago native, was reportedly the high point of the game. A Chicago newspaper described one run by Bloomingston as follows:"Chicago could not gain, and Neel was forced to punt again. [...] Bloomingston received the ball, and, dodging the tacklers, who sought to bring him to the ground, ran back {{the entire length of the}} kick. It was a splendid performance, and no small part of the applause the hero received came from Chicago throats." ...|$|E
