30|$|Prior 2007, the {{residence}} regulation in Vietnam requires {{that anyone who}} {{are living in a}} place other than their permanent residence over 30  days have to register their temporary status with the destination police. However, changing residential status was very complicated process because the migrants had to obtain a letter of release from <b>sending</b> <b>authorities</b> where they hold their registration book. It is much more complicated and difficult to get a permanent registration in cities. Since 2007, when the new Law on Residence took effect, many requirements and conditions in obtaining permanent residency are eased. According to the new Law, the number of residence status are just two—temporary and permanent, and the Law also removed any legal conditionality of employment for registration (Marx and Fleischer 2010). To obtain a registration book in Hanoi or HCMC, people must live in the city for at least 2  years (based on temporary residential booklet record) and prove that they have a legal residence place (a house or an apartment). Although transfer of registration books from one province to Hanoi or HCMCs is easier than before, it requires a complicated paperwork procedure (Demombynes and Vu 2016).|$|R

With mere minutes before Krypton is to be destroyed, Jor-El loads Kal-El into the rocketship which had been intended for a single Kryptonian who would restore Krypton's population from the Phantom Zone, and dies with his wife Lara as the planet explodes. Jor-El's legacy on the show is carried on by the constant battles between Superman and Brainiac (he is as much Jor-El's enemy as he is Superman's) and the Phantom Zone criminals Jax-Ur and Mala, who were foiled by Jor-El.|$|R

Mr. Polanski’s team may do so by arguing either that his crime does not qualify for extradition, because he was originally to have been sentenced to less than a year in prison, or that he has already effectively served his sentence, during a 42-day psychiatric evaluation.|$|R

Following the elections, Burnham's faction left the party to establish the Afro-Guyanese-dominated People's National Congress (PNC), establishing an ethnic divide between the two parties, with the PPP left representing Indo-Guyanese. The PPP won the 1961 elections by a 1.6% margin, but received almost double the number of seats compared to the PNC, leading to serious inter-racial violence.|$|R
