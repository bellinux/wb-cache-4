5|$|The {{game has}} been praised for <b>staying</b> <b>true</b> to the comedic {{nature of the}} series, for its {{entertaining}} writing, and for the detail to which the background material is explained. However, some reviewers found the game mechanics to be simplistic and uninspiring compared to other science fiction roleplaying games on the market.|$|E
5|$|For the game's localization, {{the main}} focus {{was to keep the}} {{dialogue}} natural and accessible to Western players, while also <b>staying</b> <b>true</b> to the Japanese version. The Japanese version had several instances of puns or cultural jokes, which would not have worked if they had been translated literally. There were also places in the script where the development team would have liked to insert jokes in the localization, but thought that it may be inappropriate to do so since the joke was not in the Japanese version. The team found difficulties in getting the Western version's tone right, as they wanted to keep the localized text interesting, {{and at the same time}} avoid inconsistencies with the original version's tone.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, {{and from}} 1994 to 1997, the {{competition}} was played in Japan. Colo-Colo of Chile defeated Cruzeiro 5–4 on penalties after a 0–0 tie in the 1992 final. <b>Staying</b> <b>true</b> to the winning ways of the Paulista's golden generation, São Paulo won the 1993 and 1994 finals {{to become the first}} team to retain the title. Due to schedule congestion, the 1993 finals were played as part of the Campeonato Brasileiro and it also became the first Recopa to feature two teams from the same nation. In a second, consecutive all-Brazilian final, São Paulo successfully defended the trophy against Botafogo. Since São Paulo won both the Copa Libertadores and Supercopa Sudamericana, CONMEBOL had Copa CONMEBOL winners Botafogo dispute the Recopa Sudamericana only to lose 3–1 to the defending champions.|$|E

He spent two seasons in Portugal before {{returning}} to England for spells with Aston Villa and Manchester City. It was also Jesper Blomqvist's last competitive appearance for the club. After playing in all four matches of the club's pre-season tour of Australia and China in July 1999, he suffered a succession of knee injuries that ruled him out of competitive action {{for the next two}} seasons. He made two more appearances for the first team during the 2000–01 pre-season campaign, as well as three matches for the reserves in September and October 2001, before a free transfer to Everton in November that year. For Bayern Munich, substitutes Thomas Helmer and Ali Daei left the club in the summer of 1999, with Helmer moving to England to play for Sunderland and Daei remaining in Germany with Hertha BSC.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} at Sacrifice was a Three Way {{match for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship between then-champion Samoa Joe and challengers Kurt Angle and Scott Steiner.

Angle and Joe fought in a rematch for the title on the April24 episode of Impact!; Joe won after Steiner interfered. In response to Steiner's interference, Management Director Jim Cornette scheduled a Three Way match between Angle, Joe, and Steiner for the title at Sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|Creative Assembly's studio director, Tim Heaton, {{explained}} that Halo Wars 2 would not feature gameplay {{similar to their}} Total War series. Instead they wanted to build upon the foundation established with Halo Wars. With Halo Wars 2, the development team hoped to introduce new players to the strategy game genre while appeasing experienced players by including a range of multiplayer modes that {{a wide spectrum of}} players could enjoy. They also wanted to extend the purpose of leader units and their abilities by giving each of them a more defining role in the style of play they represent. Creative Assembly thought that the game needed more units capable of performing long range attacks. They wanted to add more artillery pieces, however they found that there were currently no suitable vehicles in the Halo universe. To remedy this, they created two new vehicles, the Kodiak and the Blisterback, to fit the role. They used reference material supplied by 343 Industries to ensure the new vehicles did not feel out of place. Halo Wars 2s creative director, Alistair Hope, noted that <b>staying</b> <b>true</b> to the source material was important aspect for all of Creative Assembly's games, but stated that the team were given more freedom to explore and expand the Halo universe than they had anticipated. Hope praised the control scheme used in Halo Wars and aimed to enhance the system by ensuring that Halo Wars 2 would be intuitive to play on a console. One common control feature included in many PC RTS games but absent from the original Halo Wars is control groups, which enables sets of units to be manually assigned to a key. As Halo Wars 2 was developed for console and PC, the designers were keen to include the feature for both versions of the game. 343 Industries had initially considered supporting cross-platform play between Windows and Xbox One devices, but the feature was ultimately excluded from the game at launch.|$|E

25|$|Sylvia is {{generally}} considered a classical ballet. It features a nondescript mythical setting and a late nineteenth-century score, both of which give it an old-fashioned feel. In many ways, however, it was quite revolutionary for its time. The score {{was and still is}} recognized for its greatness. Delibes' work is certainly the best appreciated aspect of the ballet for its innovation, creativity, and maturity. Frederick Ashton's choreography complements the music very well in this respect, <b>staying</b> <b>true</b> to the spirit of the original production while incorporating modern techniques and adding his own unique touch.|$|E

25|$|Legally Blonde is {{a musical}} {{with music and}} lyrics by Laurence O'Keefe and Nell Benjamin and book by Heather Hach.

25|$|Since the {{conclusion}} of Calvin and Hobbes, Watterson has taken up painting, at one point drawing landscapes of the woods with his father. He has kept away from the public eye and has given no indication of resuming the strip, creating new works based on the strip's characters, or embarking on new commercial projects, though he has published several Calvin and Hobbes anthologies. He does not sign autographs or license his characters, <b>staying</b> <b>true</b> to his stated principles. In previous years Watterson was known to sneak autographed copies of his books onto the shelves of the Fireside Bookshop, a family-owned bookstore {{in his hometown of}} Chagrin Falls, Ohio.

25|$|Just like Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus {{during the}} ABBA era, Ted usually wrote pidgin English demo lyrics when he {{composed}} his songs {{and it was}} subsequently Kenneth's task to translate them into Swedish while <b>staying</b> <b>true</b> to Ted's original idea for a particular song. Kenneth spent {{a considerable amount of}} time getting the words exactly as Ted wanted them, with the right number of syllables to the bar, rhymes and alliterations emphasising the rhythm of the music, and then also with the specific language of a boy in his teens, occasionally including slang expressions. Just like sound engineer Tretow, Ted was also known for his prankish sense of humour, he was a big fan of Monty Python's Flying Circus and loved practical jokes, which also is reflected in the lyrics in the form of clever puns, word play, and double entendres. Kenneth's skills as a lyricist paradoxically resulted in {{the fact that some of}} Ted's audiences, in the 1970s and even to the present day, were under the impression that he wrote both the music and all lyrics, which Kenneth has since revealed that he only took as recognition that he had done Ted's music justice and it was the best compliment that he could get.|$|E
