50|$|Crotalaria juncea, {{known as}} brown hemp, Indian hemp, Madras hemp, or <b>sunn</b> <b>hemp,</b> is a {{tropical}} Asian plant of the legume family (Fabaceae). It {{is generally considered}} to have originated in India.|$|E
50|$|It is {{now widely}} grown {{throughout}} the tropics and subtropics {{as a source}} of green manure, fodder and lignified fiber obtained from its stem. <b>Sunn</b> <b>hemp</b> is also being looked at as a possible bio-fuel.

5000|$|Some {{plants are}} {{resistant}} to this nematode. In susceptible taxa, chemical control {{is one of the}} most common management practices. Nematicides before and after planting can be effective. Intercropping and crop rotation, especially with resistant or non-host plants, is used as cultural control to improve soil, increase antagonistic microorganisms, and reduce nematode populations. French marigold (Tagetes patula) and <b>sunn</b> <b>hemp</b> (Crotalaria juncea) are recommended for these uses. The fungus [...] Purpureocillium lilacinum has been used as an agent of biological pest control against the nematode in chickpea.|$|E

5000|$|Nematodes {{are spread}} through the soil and through infested banana plantlets. The best option {{is to ensure that}} banana corms are free of any {{nematodes}} prior to planting. Researchers in Hawaii found that a hot-water treatment at 50°C for 10 minutes was enough to kill all nematodes in a corm 2-6 inches thick. Soil solarization, or heating and insulating of the soil, can cause nematode death although heat may not penetrate deep enough to kill all nematodes. Cover crops such as <b>sunn</b> <b>hemp</b> and some species of marigold may reduce the amount of spiral nematodes in the soil prior to banana establishment. [...] Nematicides are also an option.

40|$|Summary – Traditional cover {{cropping}} systems for nematode management seldom consider weed and soil nutrient management concurrently. Integrating cover crops suppressive to plant-parasitic nematodes {{with a cover}} crop mulching system could improve traditional approaches. Two field experiments were conducted in 2003 and 2004 to evaluate ‘Tropic Sun ’ <b>sunn</b> <b>hemp</b> (Crotalaria juncea) and ‘Iron Clay ’ cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) as summer cover crops and as organic mulches. Both experiments were in a 3 × 3 split-plot design in which the main plots were summer planting of <b>sunn</b> <b>hemp,</b> cowpea or fallow, and the subplots were organic mulch of <b>sunn</b> <b>hemp,</b> cowpea or no mulch. The summer cover crop was followed by turnip (Brassica rapa) and lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus) in the autumn. Using <b>sunn</b> <b>hemp</b> as organic mulch suppressed root-knot nematodes more effectively than {{using it as a}} cover crop, but only on a less susceptible host such as turnip, and not on a very susceptible host such as lima bean. While <b>sunn</b> <b>hemp</b> as a cover crop failed to enhance beneficial free-living nematodes, <b>sunn</b> <b>hemp</b> as an organic mulch enhanced bacterial-feeding nematode population densities. <b>Sunn</b> <b>hemp</b> mulch also suppressed broadleaf weeds but not grasses or nutsedges. Although <b>sunn</b> <b>hemp</b> and cowpea cover crops did not increase lima bean N and K content, their mulches increased N and K content. Similar results were observed for turnip and lima bean yields. Population density of root-knot nematodes was positively related to abundance of omnivorous nematode in 2003.

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} in Magé, Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil, to evaluate the performance of taro (Colocasia esculenta) intercropped with <b>sunn</b> <b>hemp</b> (Crotalaria juncea), used as green manure. A randomized blocks design with four replicates was used and the soil of the field plots was classified as Haplic Gleysol. Treatments consisted of taro (1) intercropped with unpruned <b>sunn</b> <b>hemp,</b> (2) intercropped with <b>sunn</b> <b>hemp</b> cut at soil level, (3) intercropped with <b>sunn</b> <b>hemp</b> pruned at its mid-height, and (4) in monoculture. The taro was planted in double rows spaced by 1. 0 m. The planting furrows had a space of 0. 5 m, with rhizomes placed at every 3. 0 m. The experimental plot consisted of four 3. 0 m rows and the useful area corresponded to the five central plants in each of the two central rows. The <b>sunn</b> <b>hemp</b> was sown in parallel lines in the spaces between the taro double rows, 120 days after planting the taro. When the <b>sunn</b> <b>hemp</b> was cut at soil level, an accumulation of 211 kg ha- 1 of N was observed. Besides this, the sunn hemp's biomass promoted the cycling of an average 17 kg ha- 1 of P, 85 kg ha- 1 of K, 151 kg ha- 1 of Ca, and 27 kg ha- 1 of Mg. Worth mentioning, it represented also a deposition of 6. 85 Mg ha- 1 of dry substance. Even when pruned at its mid-height, the <b>sunn</b> <b>hemp</b> still provided 60 % of nutrients relatively to the treatment in which it was cut at soil level. In addition to the nutrient supply, the use of taro intercropped with <b>sunn</b> <b>hemp</b> cut at soil level or pruned at mid-height represented efficient alternatives for controlling the spontaneous vegetation and for reducing taro leaf burning by solar radiation, without compromising the yield of taro.

Abundance of bacterivorous and fungivorous nematodes in litterbags containing <b>sunn</b> <b>hemp</b> residues peaked at 14 days after burial (DAB) followed by increase of omnivorous nematodes at 28 DAB. Another peak of fungivorous nematodes occurred at 56 DAB. A succession of bacterivorous and fungivorous nematodes was observed in the litterbags. Enhancement of predatory nematode abundance by <b>sunn</b> <b>hemp</b> residues was not significant, but abundance of herbivorous nematodes appeared {{to respond to the}} increase in crop biomass over time. Although <b>sunn</b> <b>hemp</b> had great impact on the percentages of nematode trophic groups, several nematode fauna indices had reverted by 70 DAB to values found in untreated soil.

Two experiments were conducted in the field, in late harvest and in harvest periods. The experimental design was a randomized block, with 14 treatments and four replicates. Eight treatments with herbicides bentazon (720 and 960 g a. i. ha- 1), nicosulfuron (16 and 48 g a. i. ha- 1) and bentazon plus nicosulfuron (720 + 16; 720 + 48; 960 + 16; 960 + 48 g a. i. ha- 1) were studied, besides six controls (single crop maize and <b>sunn</b> <b>hemp,</b> with and without weed control, intercropped maize and <b>sunn</b> <b>hemp,</b> with and without weed control). Herbicide bentazon alone, in both dosages evaluated, was selective to C. juncea. Nicosulfuron in the dosage of 48 g a. i. ha- 1, alone or in a mixture with bentazon, promoted the best weed control. Maize interferes in the recoverability of <b>sunn</b> <b>hemp</b> plants treated with herbicides. C. juncea intercropped without herbicides or sprayed with bentazon negatively impacted maize yield in the harvest. The pulverization of bentazon (720 and 960 g a. i. ha- 1) in late harvest and bentazon plus nicosulfuron (720 + 16 and 920 + 16 g a. i. ha- 1) in harvest provided the best results, considering maize yield, development and recovery of <b>sunn</b> <b>hemp</b> and weed management...|$|E
40|$|Diversification {{of crops}} with species that provide {{suitable}} pollen for predators may reduce pest population on crops by enhancing predator effectiveness. In this paper we evaluated {{the suitability of}} leguminous cover crop pollens to the predatory green lacewing Chrysoperla externa (Hagen). The predator is commonly found in coffee agroecosystems and the plant species tested were pigeon pea and <b>sunn</b> <b>hemp,</b> which are used in organic coffee systems. Newly emerged females and males of C. externa were reared on diets containing pollen of pigeon pea, <b>sunn</b> <b>hemp,</b> or castor bean, used as a control. The reproductive success of C. externa was evaluated when females fed the pollen species and when honey {{was added to the}} diets, to verify the predator need for an extra carbohydrate source. Similar intrinsic growth rates were found for females fed on pigeon pea pollen and on <b>sunn</b> <b>hemp</b> pollen but these rates increased significantly when honey was added to the diets. Females fed with pigeon pea pollen plus honey and with <b>sunn</b> <b>hemp</b> pollen plus honey had higher intrinsic growth rates than those fed with castor bean pollen plus honey. Females fed on castor bean pollen only or on honey only, did not oviposit. Leguminous pollen species were equally suitable for C. externa especially when they were complemented with honey. The results suggest that to successfully enhance predator effectiveness, organic coffee plantation should be diversified with plant providing pollen in combination with plant providing nectar...|$|E
40|$|Under {{tropical}} and sub-tropical climates, {{a sustainable}} development of agriculture is challenging {{because of the}} pest pressure with favorable weather conditions. Implementation of appropriate cropping systems including growing cover crops and crop rotation plays a critical role, which can break up the food chain and life cycles of field pests. Some field trials have demonstrated that among all tested summer cover crops, <b>sunn</b> <b>hemp</b> (Crotalaria juncea L. cv. Tropic sun) can grow vigorously during the rainy summer, cover the land quickly and densely, and it can produce a large quantity of biomass {{in two to three}} months. More importantly, <b>sunn</b> <b>hemp</b> can suppress soil root-knot nematodes via releasing some nematicides through its roots and through the decomposition of plant residues. Therefore, growing cover crop â? ? <b>sunn</b> <b>hemp</b> during the crop off season and rotating with valuable vegetable crops in the growing season has become a promising cropping system under the subtropical climate. Such a result may have a potential to be implemented in Caribbean countries to improve the sustainable development of agriculture...|$|E
40|$|In São Paulo State (SPS), {{sweet orange}} (Citrus sinensis) trees with huanglongbing (HLB) {{symptoms}} {{are infected with}} Candidatus (Ca.) Liberibacter (L.) asiaticus (Las) or Ca. L. americanus (Lam). However, in 2007, 3 years after HLB was first reported in SPS, some trees with characteristic HLB symptoms were found free of liberibacters, but infected with a phytoplasma of 16 Sr group IX. This phytoplasma was further characterized by PCR amplification of ribosomal protein genes rpsC-rplV-rpsS and amplicon sequencing. A qPCR test to detect the phytoplasma in plants and insects was also developed {{on the basis of}} the ribosomal protein genes. The phytoplasma was transmitted from citrus-to-citrus by grafting. The 16 Sr group IX phytoplasma associated with HLB symptoms in sweet orange in SPS and characterized by the above techniques was named “HLB-phytoplasma”. Although the HLB-phytoplasma is widely distributed in many municipalities of central, northern, and northwestern SPS, the number of HLB-phytoplasma-infected trees in each municipality is very small. Experiments have been undertaken to identify the origin of the HLB-phytoplasma and the source of inoculum on which a putative insect vector could become infected with the HLB-phytoplasma. In SPS, <b>sunn</b> <b>hemp</b> (Crotalaria juncea L.) is a major, widely distributed cover crop. A 16 Sr group IX phytoplasma was detected in <b>sunn</b> <b>hemp</b> plants with witches’ broom and virescence symptoms, and was shown to have 16 Sr DNA sequences and ribosomal protein gene sequences with 100 % identity to the corresponding sequences of the sweet orange HLB-phytoplasma. Transmission electron microscopy revealed the presence of phytoplasma cells in the phloem sieve tubes of infected C. juncea stalks. These results were taken as evidence that the <b>sunn</b> <b>hemp</b> phytoplasma and the sweet orange HLB-phytoplasma were identical. Scaphytopius marginelineatus, a leafhopper frequently found in sweet orange orchards, was shown to acquire the HLB-phytoplasma efficiently from affected <b>sunn</b> <b>hemp</b> plants, but acquisition from, and transmission rates to, sweet orange were very low. On the whole, these data suggest that (i) <b>sunn</b> <b>hemp</b> is a major source of inoculum of the HLB-phytoplasma, (ii) S. marginelineatus becomes infected on <b>sunn</b> <b>hemp</b> and transmits the phytoplasma to sweet orange, and (iii) transmission from sweet orange to sweet orange occurs only rarely, if at all. 16 Sr group IX phytoplasmas, very closely related to the SPS HLB-phytoplasma, have also been detected in citrus in Minas Gerais and Bahia states (Brazil) and Mexico...|$|E

40|$|This {{work had}} as {{objectives}} {{to use the}} <b>Sunn</b> <b>Hemp</b> (Crotalaria juncea L.) to evaluate the residual effect in the soil of levels of water salinity and nitrogen doses, and the occurrence of spatial dependence within the experimental area. In previous years, the experimental area received six consecutive trials, which tested different levels of nitrogen and water salinity on different crops. The same experimental design was applied to this trial, that is, a randomized block design with split-plots (5 x 3), corresponding to the residual effect of water salinity and nitrogen, and four replications. The variables determined were: the plant height on six dates after the sowing, and the dry mass of the shoot, root and the whole plant. The data were firstly subjected to the variance analysis of the residual effects and {{to the study of}} spatial variability through geostatistics. The variance analysis did not show significant residual effects of the levels of salinity and nitrogen doses in the soil on the height and dry mass of <b>Sunn</b> <b>Hemp.</b> It was observed a spatial dependence, from moderate to high, in all dates, for height and dry mass of <b>Sunn</b> <b>Hemp.</b> ...|$|E
30|$|Generally, {{decorticated}} ramie and <b>sunn</b> <b>hemp</b> fibers possess up to 20 – 35  % of non-cellulosic gummy material comprising pectin and hemicellulose (Kochhar 1981; Bruhlmann et al. 1994).
