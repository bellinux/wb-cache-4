40|$|Conventionally, patellar tendon-bearing (PTB) sockets, {{which need}} high dexterity of prosthetist, are widely used. Lack of char-tered and {{experienced}} prosthetist has often led to painful experience of wearing prosthesis {{and this will}} in turn deter the patients to wear the prosthesis, which will further aggravate stump shrinkage. Thus, the hydrostatic socket which demands relatively lower level of fabricating skill is proposed to replace the PTB socket {{in order to produce}} the equivalent, if not better, quality of support to the amputee patients. Both sockets ’ pressure profiles are studied and compared using finite element analysis (FEA) software. Three-dimensional models of both sockets were developed using MIMICS software. The analysis results showed that hydrostatic socket did exhibit more uniform pressure profiles than that of PTB socket. PTB socket showed pressure concentration near the proximal brim of the socket and also at the distal fibula. It was also found that the pressure mag-nitude in hydrostatic socket is relatively lower than that of PTB <b>socket.</b> <b>Key</b> words: finite element analysis, patellar-tendon-bearing socket, hydrostatic socket, interface pressure 1...|$|E
40|$|For {{understandable}} reasons many television programmes rely on {{visual content}} and composition {{to help to}} tell their story. The provision of additional description of the scene or action can therefore provide a considerable benefit to understanding, especially to the visually impaired. Audio description (AD) is an ancillary component associated with a TV service which delivers a verbal description of the visual scene {{as an aid to}} understanding and enjoyment particularly (but not exclusively) for viewers who have visual impairments. This White Paper describes the user requirements for audio description, how audio description can be implemented for digital television and how it works for digital terrestrial television (DTT). It also describes a particular practical implementation based on a PCMCIA card module which plugs into any DTT receiver which is fitted with an operative "Common Interface" (CI) <b>socket.</b> <b>Key</b> words: Access services, visual impairments, audio description, digital television, digital terrestrial television, DTV, DTT BBC 2002.

50|$|Early {{experimental}} {{incandescent lamps}} had their wire leads connected to screw terminals, {{but this was}} inconvenient for commercial use. The Edison organization used simple wooden receptacles with copper strips inside them, when putting lamps on the commercial steamship Columbia (owned and operated by the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company). These <b>sockets</b> included <b>key</b> switches, but were only useful for upright installations of the bulb. The Edison organization developed a screw-base in 1880, initially also of wood but later made with plaster of Paris. Many competitive designs of lamp sockets flourished in the early era of incandescent lighting, using mutually incompatible electrical contact and mechanical fixing arrangements.|$|R
50|$|The cable {{connectors}} and <b>sockets</b> are <b>keyed</b> and colour-coded, {{according to the}} voltage range and frequency used; common colours for 50-60 Hz AC power are yellow for 100-130 volts, blue for 200-250 volts, and red for 400-480 volts. The blue fittings are often used for providing weather-proofed exterior sockets for outdoor apparatus. In camping situations, the large 32 A blue fittings provide power to static caravans, whilst the smaller blue 16 A version powers touring caravans and tents. The yellow fittings are used to provide transformer isolated 110 V supplies for UK construction sites {{to reduce the risk}} of electric shock, and this use spills over into uses of power tools outside of the construction site environment. The red three-phase versions are used for three-phase portable equipment.|$|R

Essentially, it is {{the practice of}} anticipating all possible ways that an end-user could misuse a device, and designing the device {{so as to make}} such misuse impossible, or to minimize the negative consequences. For example, if it is important that a plug is inserted into a socket in a particular orientation, the socket and plug should be designed so that it is physically impossible to insert the plug incorrectly.

40|$|After tooth extraction, the {{alveolar}} ridge will commonly {{decrease in}} volume and change morphologically. These changes are usually clinically significant {{and can make}} placement of a conventional bridge or an implant-supported crown difficult. If bone resorption is significant enough, then placement of an implant may become extremely challenging. Postextraction maintenance of the alveolar ridge minimizes residual ridge resorption and, thus, allows placement of an implant that satisfies esthetic and functional criteria. Recent advances in bone grafting materials and techniques allow the dentist to place implants in sites that were considered compromised in the past. This article focuses on the healing pattern of sockets, with and {{without the use of}} regenerative materials, and the rationale for preserving the dimensions of the extraction socket. Histologic and clinical evidence is reviewed to provide an in-depth understanding of the logic behind and value of <b>socket</b> preservation.

5000|$|Made {{of solid}} brass, the Svea 123 weighs about 500 grams (19 ounces), {{measures}} 100 mm x 130 mm (3.9” x 5.1”) and will burn {{for over an}} hour on full tank (about 4 ounces) of fuel. Later models (designated the “Svea 123R” and also sold as the Optimus “Climber”) were made with a built-in cleaning needle to keep the burner jet from clogging by pushing soot or other impurities outward; early Sievert models without the self-cleaning needle came with a small wire pricker that is used to clean the burner jet manually by pushing the soot inwards. These older models are distinguishable by their downwardly-angled spindle and control valve, to which the adjusting key is attached. The spindle on a Svea 123R with the self-cleaning needle is at a right angle to the stem. Other differences between older and newer models include the vaporizer on older models, which is smooth, while newer models of both the Svea 123 and the 123R are finned and have a stronger joint configuration at the base. The pressure-relief valve in the filler cap has also been redesigned several times to improve both reliability as well as re-seating of the valve after it has opened. [...] The pentagonal hole in the pressure relief valve is designed as a vent, not a <b>key</b> <b>socket.</b> The valve disassembles easily with a pliers. A brass windscreen attaches directly to the stove, and has built-in pot supports that fold inward for storage. The aluminum lid comes with a detachable handle and can also be used as a small cook-pot.|$|R
5000|$|Soon he {{discovered}} {{that he had to}} design machinery to make its parts. One of the first was a tapping machine, also his patent. Around 1896 with his business in machinery progressing, Hubbell's next patent was a major breakthrough in the fastener industry: the process and machinery for cold rolled screw threads which reduced the rate of material lost in production by more than 50%. He designed and built progressive blanking and forming dies, patented machinery to slot screw heads, a machine to assemble screws and small parts, devised tools to indicate speed, and patented a changeable speed screwdriver. Hubbell's idea was to provide convenience, safety, and control to an electric light with his new [...] "pull socket" [...] which was patented in August 1896. The same familiar device with its on/off pull chain is still in use today. He built three prototypes by hand using metal and insulated wood parts to design a product with individual wires permanently attached in the proper sequence and correct polarity, and one which could be connected or disconnected, easily and safely, to a power supply in the wall. cartridge fuses and fuse block, lamp holders, <b>key</b> <b>sockets</b> - soon followed the same path Later, Hubbell's [...] "separable plug" [...] design took shape on the drawing board back in Bridgeport, and then submitted to the patent office in Washington, D.C. Additional designs based on that basic concept - separable plugs in different configurations, a single flush mounted receptacle - as well as new products for electrical circuits. One of the most successful and the one most familiar today, was the duplex receptacle which is still found everywhere that electrical power is used. In 1901 Hubbell published a 12-page catalogue that listed 63 electrical products of his company's manufacture, and four years later he incorporated his enterprise as Harvey Hubbell, Incorporated , In the same year, the Company registered its trademark of [...] "...a sphere with meridian lines and the name 'Hubbell' centered within." [...] Hubbell's pace of new ideas and product design did not falter. In 1909 the company began constructing a four-floor factory and office building that woul d become the first building in New England made of reinforced concrete.|$|R
