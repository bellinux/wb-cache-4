40|$|A {{connector}} retainer {{and mounting}} {{system has been}} designed to replace <b>screw-mounting</b> of Winchester connectors. Countersunk screws are normally used to secure connectors to structures, and to keep them from coming apart. These screws are normally put into threaded or through-holes in metallic structures. This unique retainer is designed such that integral posts keep the connector halves retained, and a groove permits a cable tie to be fastened around the retainer and composite tube, thus securing the connector to the structure. The system is compatible for use on cryogenic (and conventional) bonded composite tube assemblies. Screws and tapped/through-holes needed to retain and mount Winchester connectors cannot be used on blind-access composite tubes. This system allows for rapid installation, removal, low-molecular-outgassing materials, and particulate-free installation and removal. Installation and/or changes late in the integration, and test flow with limited access in a cleanroom environment are possible. No sanding or bonding is needed...|$|E

50|$|Other SLRs soon followed, {{but because}} of {{limitations}} with their lens mounts, the manufacturers of these cameras had to choose 'aperture-priority' automation, where the camera's metering system selects the correct shutter speed. As one example, Pentax introduced the Electro Spotmatic, which {{was able to use}} the then considerable bulk of 42 mm <b>screw-mount</b> lenses produced by various manufacturers. Yashica, another <b>screw-mount</b> camera manufacturer, soon followed.|$|R
50|$|Pentax {{supplies}} adapters to fit M42 <b>screw-mount</b> lenses, as do several third-party manufacturers. The M42 <b>screw-mount</b> {{system was}} used by Pentax prior {{to the introduction of}} the K-mount. Pentax designed the K-mount wide enough to allow an adapter to fit between the M42 thread and the K bayonet. They also kept the same flange focal distance (also called registration distance or register) as the M42 <b>screw-mount,</b> so that M42 lenses focus correctly using the correct adapter (such as Pentax original or Bower). There are however other third-party adapters that add to the flange focal distance so that one loses the ability to focus to infinity. The loss of infinity-focus may not be significant in macro or close-up photography.|$|R
50|$|In {{countries}} that use 220-240 volts AC domestic power, standard-size E27 and small E14 {{are the most}} common <b>screw-mount</b> sizes and are prevalent throughout continental Europe and China.|$|R
50|$|The Canon {{rangefinders}} of {{the late}} 1940s and early 1950s are Leica-compatible <b>screw-mount</b> cameras. Many {{were brought to the}} U.S. by servicemen who bought them while visiting Japan during the Korean War. Typically they were mounted with a 50mm Serenar (later, Canon) lens.|$|R
5000|$|Pentax resurrected the Takumar {{name in the}} 1980s and 1990s for {{a budget}} line of zoom and prime lenses that lacked the Pentax [...] "Super Multi-Coating" [...] {{anti-reflective}} coating that reduces lens flare. These lenses are marked [...] "Takumar (Bayonet)" [...] or [...] "Takumar-F" [...] to distinguish them from the older <b>screw-mount</b> Takumar lenses.|$|R
5000|$|The Konica Hexar RF accepts lenses {{designed}} for the [...] "Bayonet Konica KM-mount" [...] {{a copy of the}} Leica M-mount. Because of this, the Hexar RF can mount and focus lenses {{designed for}} the Leica and other compatible M-mount cameras or, when used with an adapter, the earlier Leica thread mount lenses (note that due to physical constraints there is no adapter to allow bayonet mount lenses to be fitted to a Leica <b>screw-mount</b> camera).|$|R
5000|$|The Hektor is a {{photographic}} lens design manufactured by Leica Camera. The first [...] "fast" [...] lens {{available for the}} Leica I(A) was the Hektor 50mm f/2,5. Later, the design was adapted {{for use as a}} long portrait lens, available first in a 135mm f/4,5 <b>screw-mount</b> version and later in a 125mm f/2,5 bayonet-mount version. It is reported that Max Berek, who designed the original lens line for Leitz, named the [...] "Hektor" [...] after his dog.|$|R
50|$|The central hood {{is made up}} of two <b>screw-mounted</b> {{side panels}} and a two-piece roof, with hatches for engine access, bolted to the sides. In the space {{just in front of the}} cab is a fan cooling the {{traction}} motors of the rear bogie, the exciter and a belt-driven charging dynamo, and the muffler. The short rear hood contains the electrical panel and batteries. Electrical devices, the battery master switch, circuit breakers and other switches are directly accessible from the driver's cab.|$|R
50|$|Canon, which {{produced}} the FD lens mount (known as the breech-mount; a unique lens mounting system that combines {{the advantages of}} <b>screw-mount</b> and bayonet-mount) introduced their shutter priority 35 mm SLR, the Canon EF in 1976 or so. This camera's build quality was almost the equal of their flagship camera, the Canon F1, and featured a copal-square vertically travelling focal plane shutter that could synchronize electronic flash at shutter speeds {{up to and including}} 1/125 of a second, thus making this a good second-body camera for the professional photographer.|$|R
50|$|The {{pantographs}} are <b>screw-mounted</b> to {{the roof}} at three points. Pantograph 1 is connected directly through the roof to the main control switch in the engine room; pantograph 2 is connected via a cable splice running along the side wall of the engine room to the main switch. The contact shoes are outfitted with a monitoring system in case of contact shoe breakage. Inside of the contact shoe, which is made of graphite, runs an air channel, which is overpressurised. In case of breakage, the air escapes, causing the pantograph to automatically retract, preventing possible damage to the overhead contact wire.|$|R
5000|$|The Leica M3 is a 35 mm {{rangefinder}} camera by Ernst Leitz GmbH (now Leica Camera AG), {{introduced in}} 1954. It {{was a new}} starting point for Leitz, which until then had only produced <b>screw-mount</b> Leica cameras that were incremental improvements to its original Leica (Ur-Leica). The M3 introduced several features to the Leica, among them the combination of viewfinder and rangefinder in one bright window, like on the Contax II, and a bayonet lens mount. It was the most successful model of the M series, with over 220,000 units sold by the time production of the M3 model ended in 1966.|$|R
50|$|As {{with other}} Pentax DSLRs, the *ist DS uses the Pentax KAF bayonet mount and can use older lenses using the KA-mount without limitations. Original K mount lenses and, with adapter also M42 <b>screw-mount</b> lenses, {{can be used}} in manual mode by {{selecting}} a menu option. Centre-weighted metering, aperture priority and focus indication are maintained, even with adapter mounted lenses. When using non-auto aperture lenses, a press of the AE-L button with the camera in manual mode will meter the scene and set the shutter speed. Some non-Pentax K-mount lenses have been reported not to mount on the camera, because a plate protecting the aperture stop-down lever is slightly deeper.|$|R
5000|$|Petri {{produced}} many early bellows, rangefinder and single-lens reflex cameras. Due {{to increased}} electronization, mass production and {{competition from other}} camera vendors, Kuribayashi filed for final bankruptcy in 1977. The labor union, affiliated with Sohyo, continued the company under the name Petri Kōgyō K.K. with employee capital. The last model produced was the MF10, but with its <b>screw-mount</b> lens it could not compete with products having electrical contacts, and disappeared in the autofocus boom of the 1980s. The Petri Camera brand was sold to the Dixons Group in the UK and became an [...] "in-house" [...] brand {{for a short time}} in the early eighties.|$|R
50|$|The Krasnogorsk-3 uses {{standard}} 100 ft load of 16mm film (single or double-perforation). There is {{no provision}} for an external magazine. There are two different lens mounts used on the Krasnogorsk-3. One is the M42×1 lens mount. The other is a Russian bayonet mount. The stock lens is the f/1.9 17-69 mm zoom lens Meteor-5-1 and {{is considered by many}} to be a quality optic. The M42 <b>screw-mount</b> allows for the use of widely available lenses from 35 mm still cameras such as Asahi Pentax Takumar lenses. Cameras which have been modified from the original standard 16mm (double-perforartion) to accept Super 16 (single-perforation) film may experience vignetting at the widest zoom setting with stock Meteor lenses.|$|R
50|$|Mounts {{used for}} Telescopes, microscopes and generic optics. The T-mount was {{initially}} developed by Tamron (1957) {{to allow the}} easy adaption of generic 35 mm SLR optics into multiple mounts. The T-mount is a 42 mm diameter 0.75 mm pitch screw mount with a 55 mm flange focal distance. Later versions (T2, T4, TX) were more advanced and complex. Several other manufacturers besides Tamron have used these mounts. Because the T-mount is still used for many telescopes and microscopes, they are still available new. Note that while both T-mount M42-mount are both 42mm <b>screw-mount</b> screw mount systems, and will mount if they are forced, they are not compatible. The difference in pitch can cause damage to the lens, adapter or camera mount if they are confused.|$|R
40|$|The figure {{presents}} selected {{views of}} a modular rake of 17 pitot probes for measuring both transient and steady-state pressures in a supersonic wind tunnel. In addition to pitot tubes visible in the figure, the probe modules contain (1) high-frequency dynamic-pressure transducers connected through wires to remote monitoring circuitry and (2) flow passages that lead to tubes that, in turn, lead to remote steady-state pressure transducers. Prior pitot-probe rakes were fabricated as unitary structures, into which the individual pitot probes were brazed. Repair or replacement of individual probes was difficult, costly, and time-consuming because (1) {{it was necessary to}} remove entire rakes in order to unbraze individual malfunctioning probes and (2) the heat of unbrazing a failed probe and of brazing a new probe in place could damage adjacent probes. In contrast, the modules in the present probe are designed to be relatively quickly and easily replaceable with no heating and, in many cases, without need for removal of the entire rake from the wind tunnel. To remove a malfunctioning probe, one first removes a <b>screw-mounted</b> V-cross-section cover that holds the probe and adjacent probes in place. Then one removes a <b>screw-mounted</b> cover plate {{to gain access to the}} steady-state pressure tubes and dynamicpressure wires. Next, one disconnects the tube and wires of the affected probe. Finally, one installs a new probe in the reverse of the aforementioned sequence. The wire connections can be made by soldering, but to facilitate removal and installation, they can be made via miniature plugs and sockets. The connections between the probe flow passages and the tubes leading to the remote pressure sensors can be made by use of any of a variety of readily available flexible tubes that can be easily pulled off and slid back on for removal and installation, respectively...|$|R
5000|$|The Pentax LX is a 35 mm Single-lens {{reflex camera}} {{produced}} by Pentax in Japan introduced in 1980 and a production run that spanned until 2001. The LX lens mount {{is known as}} Pentax K mount which is the proprietary bayonet mount. Also available is an adapter that allow the use of almost all Pentax 35 mm format lenses, those made before 1975 using a <b>screw-mount</b> adapter with no direct functionality to the meter index link, instead, metering is accomplished with the [...] "stop-down" [...] method. It is the top-of-the-line [...] "professional" [...] or [...] "system" [...] camera in the Pentax manual focus range. Compared to contemporary professional bodies from most rival manufacturers, like the Canon F-1 or Nikon F3, the LX body is much smaller and lighter, weighing in at 570 grams (20 ounces) with standard FA-1 finder.|$|R
5000|$|The {{valvetrain}} {{was also}} updated, {{although it was}} still based on a single, center-block-located camshaft pushing on hydraulic lifters and pushrods, one for each rocker arm. However, the cast nodular iron camshaft was of the [...] "roller" [...] type, with each lobe acting upon a hydraulic lifter with a roller bearing on the bottom; this made for a quieter, cooler-running valvetrain, but also allowed for a more aggressive valve lift. Each of the lifters acted upon a steel pushrod, which were of the [...] "oil-through" [...] type. This was another change for the Magnum. Because the new pushrods also served to provide oil {{to the top of}} the cylinder head, the rockers were changed to the AMC-style, <b>screw-mounted,</b> bridged half-shaft type. The new rockers also had a higher ratio: 1.6:1 compared to 1.5:1 in the LA engine, which increased leverage on the valves. In addition, the oil boss located at the end of the cylinder head on the LA engine was left undrilled, as it was no longer needed. However, the boss itself was left in place, perhaps to cut down on casting and machining costs, and to allow the use of earlier LA heads.|$|R
50|$|The bayonet {{light bulb}} mount is the {{standard}} fitting in many {{former members of the}} British Empire including the United Kingdom, Australia, India, Ireland, and New Zealand, as well as parts of the Middle East and Africa (although not Canada, which primarily uses Edison screw sockets along with the United States and Mexico). The standard size is B22d-2, often referred to in the context of lighting as simply BC. Older installations in some other countries, including France and Greece use this base. First developed by St. George Lane Fox-Pitt in the UK and improved upon by the Brush Electric Company from the late 1870s onward, standard bulbs have two pins {{on opposite sides of the}} cap; however, some specialized bulbs have three pins (cap designation B22d-3) to prevent use in domestic light fittings. Examples of three-pin bulbs are found in mercury street lamps and fireglow bulbs in some older models of electric radiative heater. Older railway carriages in the UK also made use of a 3 pin bulb base to discourage theft. Bayonet cap bulbs are also very common worldwide in applications where vibration may loosen <b>screw-mount</b> bulbs, such as automotive lighting and other small , and in many flashlights. In many other countries the Edison screw (E) base is used for lighting.|$|R
5000|$|Different {{types of}} {{equipment}} {{are used to}} amplify the electric bass and other bass instruments, depending on the performance setting, style of music, the sound desired by the bassist, {{the size of the}} venue and other factors, such as whether a bassist is an amateur or professional musician. Professional bassists {{are more likely to have}} expensive [...] "boutique" [...] amps and cabinets. All types of bass amps and cabinets are designed to be transportable to shows and recording studios, and as such, most have various features to protect the cabinet (e.g., metal or plastic corner protectors) and speakers (a plastic screen or metal grille) during transportation and move the equipment (a single carry handle is standard for practice amps and combo amps and two handles are sometimes provided for two-handed carrying of large cabinets, and wheels are mounted on some large combo amps and cabinets). Amplifier [...] "heads" [...] may be sold mounted in a wooden cabinet with a carrying handle, or they may be sold as rackmount-able components, which can be <b>screw-mounted</b> in a 19" [...] road case for protection.The speaker enclosures for combo amps and speaker cabinets are typically covered in stiff vinyl, carpet, felt or other sturdy fabric, or painted.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Fretting fatigue {{occurs when}} the contact {{surfaces}} of two components undergo small oscillatorymovementwhile they are subjected to a clamping force. A cyclic external loadgives rise to the early initiation of fatigue cracks, thus reducing their service life. In this paper, the fretting fatigue behaviour of commercially pure titanium flat samples (1. 5 mm thick) is evaluated. A fretting device composed of a frame, load cell, and two <b>screw-mounted</b> cylindrical fretting pads with convex extremities was built and set to a servo-hydraulic testing machine. The fatigue tests were conducted under load control at a frequency of 10 Hz and stress ratio R = 0. 1, with various contact load values applied to the fretting pads. Additional tests under inert environment allowed assessing the role of oxidation on the wear debris formation. The fracture surfaces and fretting scars were analysed via scanning electron microscopy in order to evaluate the surface damage evolutionand {{its effect on the}} fatiguecrack features. Theeffect of the fretting conditionon theS–N curve of the material in the range of 104 – 106 cycles is described. Fatigue crack growth calculations allowed estimating the crack initiation andpropagation lives under fretting conditions. The effect of the fretting condition in fatigue life is stronger for the lower values of cyclic stress and does not seem to depend on the contact loading value...|$|R
40|$|The {{process known}} as {{fretting}} fatigue occurs at the contact surface between two components pressed together by a static load and {{is related to the}} simultaneous occurrence of wear, corrosion and fatigue damage. A small-amplitude oscillatory movement leads to friction stresses and surface wear. The oxidation of small fragments of metal (in normal atmospheric conditions) produces oxide debris. A cyclic external load applied to one or both the components gives rise to the early initiation of fatigue cracks. In this paper, the fretting fatigue behavior of commercially pure titanium flat samples (1. 5 mm thick) is evaluated. In order to carry out the experimental work, a fretting device composed by a frame, load cell and <b>screw-mounted</b> fretting pads was built and mounted in a servo-hydraulic testing machine. The fatigue tests were conducted under load control and stress ratio R = 0. 1 for the following values of initial contact load applied to the fretting pads: 100, 300, 500 and 900 N. Additional test were performed: i) using a Teflon ® fretting pad and ii) in argon atmosphere. The contact load evolution was recorded during the tests. The fretting scars were analyzed via scanning electron microscopy. The fatigue life was modeled by the two-parameter Weibull distribution. The results were evaluated in terms of the influence of the fretting phenomenon on the fatigue life of the material, as well as the effects of fretting conditions on the contact load evolution and wear debris formation...|$|R
