2500|$|In West Germany, Foucault {{completed}} in 1960 his primary thesis (thèse principale) for his <b>State</b> <b>doctorate,</b> entitled [...] (Madness and Insanity: History of Madness in the Classical Age), a philosophical work based upon his studies {{into the history}} of medicine. The book discussed how West European society had dealt with madness, arguing that it was a social construct distinct from mental illness. Foucault traces the evolution of the concept of madness through three phases: the Renaissance, the later 17th and 18th centuries, and the modern experience. The work alludes to the work of French poet and playwright Antonin Artaud, who exerted a strong influence over Foucault's thought at the time.|$|E
2500|$|Histoire de la folie was an {{expansive}} work, consisting of 943 pages of text, followed by appendices and a bibliography. Foucault submitted {{it at the}} University of Paris, although the university's regulations for awarding a <b>State</b> <b>doctorate</b> required the submission of both his main thesis and a shorter complementary thesis. Obtaining a doctorate in France at the period was a multi-step process. The {{first step was to}} obtain a rapporteur, or [...] "sponsor" [...] for the work: Foucault chose Georges Canguilhem. The second was to find a publisher, and as a result Folie et déraison would be published in French in May 1961 by the company Plon, whom Foucault chose over Presses Universitaires de France after being rejected by Gallimard. In 1964, a heavily abridged version was published as a mass market paperback, then translated into English for publication the following year as Madness and Civilization.|$|E
