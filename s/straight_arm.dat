UAE conditions differ significantly from those of Pakistan due to the Gulf's sandy soils. Bowlers with a <b>straight</b> <b>arm</b> action like Johan Botha tend to reap wickets at these pitches. Grounds are not that hard. Dubai Cricket Stadium offers some grass and bounce though dry conditions tend to result in {{the fourth and fifth}} days of a test match being spin friendly. Sheikh Zayed Stadium is batting-friendly, and the cracks come very late into play.|$|E
500|$|In {{one of the}} few {{contemporaneous}} accounts, the Toledo Blade {{wrote that}} the Penn players, knowing that Schulz was [...] "the power in the Michigan game", focused their energy on wearing him down. [...] There were two Penn players who [...] "did nothing but look after Schultz". [...] And they did more than look: [...] "In every scrimmage, he was bumped as hard as the rules allowed, and maybe a little harder, when nobody was looking.... Every time Schultz started anywhere he would find a couple of Penn men digging headfirst into his stomach. [...] They would elbow him, jam him with the <b>straight</b> <b>arm,</b> and if he went to the ground in a scrimmage there generally would be a knee grinding him in the wind. [...] Pretty soon Schultz began to show it.... He limped along pitifully. [...] He couldn't run. [...] His strength was almost gone. [...] When he did tackle, his groan of pain could almost be heard in the stands". [...] But the fans continued to urge Schulz with yells of [...] "G-r-r-r-r-rah, Schultz!" [...] Schulz buckled down and continued to play, and the pummeling continued.|$|E
500|$|Opinion {{was divided}} over the {{legality}} of Mold's bowling action. After no-balling Mold for the second time, Phillips wrote that he had long suspected Mold of throwing. Even though he believed Mold was trying to bowl with a <b>straight</b> <b>arm</b> in the Somerset match, Phillips considered many more deliveries to be throws than merely those he called. In his own defence, Mold queried why Phillips never acted on his prior suspicions, and suggested that the umpire {{did not make it}} clear which part of Mold's bowling action was unfair. The Manchester Guardian, reporting on the Somerset match in 1901, noted that many umpires had apparently viewed Mold's action as fair earlier in the season, even after the instruction from the MCC to pay careful attention to him. It stated that [...] "the general opinion was that if one ball was to be called a throw then every ball he sent down was of the same order." [...] However, some critics noted that when bowling an occasional faster ball, Mold's action changed slightly; this was the delivery to which Phillips objected. His obituary in the Manchester Guardian stated that the lack of action by umpires other than Phillips in 1901, and throughout Mold's career, meant that the [...] "charge against Mold, then, can hardly be said to have been 'proven.|$|E

2500|$|The missing {{right arm}} of the mummy {{was the cause of}} a minor {{controversy}} between researchers. Two severed arms had been located within KV35, and either one was thought likely to belong to the Younger Lady. One was a bent arm with a clenched fist, while the other was a <b>straight</b> <b>arm.</b> It was typical for female Egyptian mummies to be positioned with one of their arms bent and the other one in a straight position. The hand more likely to be positioned as bent was the left hand. The Egyptian Mummy Project of Ashraf Selim examined both arms to resolve the controversy. The bent arm was compared to the Younger Lady's attached left hand, and was found to be too long to belong to the same woman. The bones of the two compared arms were also found [...] "different in consistency". The <b>straight</b> <b>arm</b> was then compared to the Young Lady's left arm. It was found to be of similar length and similar bone density, so the Project concluded that the <b>straight</b> <b>arm</b> most likely did belong to the Younger Lady. The identified right {{arm of the}} Younger Lady has two breaks, [...] "one in the upper arm and one at the wrist". The hand has been severed {{from the rest of the}} limb.|$|E
2500|$|The 1958 New Zealanders were {{dispatched}} 4 – 0 but Australia finally {{regained the}} Ashes with a crushing 4 – 0 victory on England's ill starred 1958–1959 Ashes tour. [...] The team had been {{hailed as the}} strongest ever to leave on an Ashes tour but Richie Benaud's revitalised Australians were too strong. [...] Laker took 15 wickets at 21.2 but Trueman managed 9 in his three appearances and Tony Lock a mere 5 at 75 while the Australians 'bowlers' Meckiff, Rorke, Slater and Burke escaped penalty, if not scrutiny, for their questionable actions. [...] Lindwall, 'last of the <b>straight</b> <b>arm</b> bowlers' passed Grimmet's 216 wickets in his 57th test. [...] A 1 – 0 in New Zealand was scant consolation.|$|E

[...] He was known as [...] "a clever dodger in the open" [...] who [...] "used his hands with telling effect in warding off tacklers." [...] In 1929, a newspaper reporter recalled Heston's running style as follows:"A strong arm helped Willie, Sr., to move 'em. After cracking through that line the old arm would go out. [...] You can still pick out men who used to play football against Michigan in '02 and '03, they say, because their faces seem just a little out of kilter.

2500|$|In cricket {{to throw}} the ball when bowling is illegal and results in a no ball, but until 1960 it was {{undefined}} and it took a strong minded umpire confident of the backing of the authorities to call a bowler for this offence. To accuse a bowler of throwing was to call in question his sportsmanship, in effect to call him a cheat, and could result in libel charges by the offended bowler. A bowler who threw the ball [...] increased his pace, from slow to medium or medium to fast, and the whip of the wrist altered the line of the ball, variations that could easily dismiss a batsman. When applied to short-pitched deliveries the speed and inconsistent bounce of a [...] "chucker" [...] could be very dangerous, as demonstrated by the feared West Indian fast bowler Charlie Griffith. Another difficulty for the umpires was that although the upright <b>straight</b> <b>arm</b> was the ideal many bowlers had a slightly bent bowling arm without throwing the ball, and of course leg spinners used a strong wrist action, so it was not easy to sort out the innocent from the guilty. Sir Donald Bradman said [...] "It is the most complex question I have known in cricket, because it {{is not a matter of}} fact, but a matter of opinion and interpretation. It is so involved that two men of equal good will and sincerity could take opposite views".|$|E
2500|$|Strange as it {{may seem}} England had few qualms about the Australian bowling {{at the start of the}} series. Dennis Lillee and Bob Massie had been overbowled in 1972 and 1973 and had both broken down with {{crippling}} injuries, while Jeff Thomson – if they had heard of him – had taken 0/110 in his only Test. However, Lillee returned to Test cricket after considerable determination to overcome his injuries and though he lost a yard or two of pace he had lost none of his old venom and [...] "bowled with a hostility that bordered on savagery". His new bowling action was a text-book model and his <b>straight</b> <b>arm</b> gave him movement through the air and off the pitch that made him more dangerous than ever. But the real revelation was Thomson, whose javelin throw action gave him enormous pace and [...] "slung the ball down at sizzling pace, getting dangerous lift off a length, and not worrying overmuch where the ball landed" [...] In 1975–76 his bowling was clocked at 99.6mph compared to Lillee's 86.4 and his very inaccuracy made him dangerous, the batsmen never knew where the ball was going to land next. They were given wholehearted support by Max Walker, as fast-medium bowler whose awkward whirlwind bowling action gave him the nickname of Tangles. 6'4" [...] tall and as strong as a bull Walker was an accurate swing bowler and took 8/143 in the last Test when Lillee and Thomson were injured. Geoff Dymock was a left-arm swing bowler who struggled to keep his pace in a strong Australian team, but became the first Australian to dismiss all 11 opposition batsmen in a Test when he took 12/166 at Kanpur in 1979–80. Doug Walters was a part-time bowler, but his medium-paced [...] "Golden Arm" [...] was capable of breaking any partnership and he deserved to be regarded an all-rounder. Greg Chappell was also seen as an all-rounder in his youth, and continued to bowl throughout his Test career, but mainly to tie up one end while the other bowlers rested. The orthodox off-spinner Ashley Mallett could turn the ball very sharply. Tom Graveney thought he was the finest Australian off-spinner since the war and came second in the averages after Thomson. Historically Australian selectors preferred a leg-spinner, but Terry Jenner failed to hold his place and as fast-bowling rose in prominence the Australian 'leggie' became almost extinct.|$|E

50|$|The stiff-arm fend is {{particularly}} effective because its {{force is applied}} {{down the length of}} a <b>straight</b> <b>arm,</b> directly into the shoulder.

As such, the force that can be applied by a stiff-arm fend can easily repel or topple an oncoming defender. The same techniques are practised by some schools of martial artists when striking or punching; by ensuring that the direction of the force is directly down a locked, <b>straight</b> <b>arm,</b> martial artists can punch through bricks and tiles without damaging their arms.|$|E
