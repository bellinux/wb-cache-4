40|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} {{are considered the}} sensing technology of the future. Large numbers of untethered sensor nodes {{can be used for}} tracking small animals and targets, environmental monitoring, enforcing security perimeters, etc. A major problem for many sensor network applications is determining the most efficient way of conserving the energy of the power source. Some networks use batteries, while others suggest different methods of gathering energy (e. g., solar cells). Regardless of the powering method, energy conservation is of prime importance for sensor networks. The best way to conserve energy is to turn the sensor nodes off; however, since an inactive sensor node is no longer part of the network, the network can become disconnected. This creates a fundamental trade-off. In this paper, we propose a deterministic, schedulebased energy conservation scheme. In the proposed approach, time-synchronized sensors form on-off schedules that enable the sensors to be awake only when necessary. The <b>schedule</b> <b>establishment</b> is fully distributed and thus appropriate for large sensor networks. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated through the use of simulations...|$|R

40|$|Current {{wireless}} {{standards and}} protocols for industrial {{applications such as}} WirelessHART and ISA 100. 11 a typically use centralized network management techniques for communication <b>scheduling</b> and route <b>establishment.</b> However, large-scale centralized systems can have several drawbacks.

Large-scale centralized systems can also have highly variable latencies thus making them unsuitable for closed-loop control applications. To address these problems, this paper describes D-SAR, a distributed resource reservation algorithm which would allow source nodes to meet the Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements of the application in real-time, when carrying out peer-to-peer communication.

This paper explores the current practice in project scheduling in the Malaysian construction industry and proposes guidelines that will alleviate the current problems in project scheduling. The methodology adopted was through interviews and questionnaire survey. The findings of the survey form a basis for the formulation of the guidelines. It consists of four main aspects of project scheduling which are process of acceptance of work schedule, responsibilities of the contracting parties, application of work schedule, and implications of work <b>schedule.</b> With the <b>establishment</b> of these guidelines a standardised approach for the preparation and submission of work schedule can be achieved thus will be able to minimise {{some of the problems that}} are currently hinder the full application of project scheduling in various construction projects.

40|$|OBJECT: Improved {{precision}} fertilization {{by introducing}} sensors and remote control to secure fruit yield and reduce nutrient leaching in soil culture. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We broadcasted before bedding and mulching 50  g m– 2 of a multi-mineral fertilizer. Beds had two plant rows 20  cm apart, with plant distance of 25  cm. Experimental design was split plot with three replications and three treatments. Treatments: fertigation in large plots, cultivar in small plots and year. RESULTS: Plant {{development in the}} establishing year had no benefit of fertigation in addition to fertilizer given before bedding. When the yield is 3  kg m– 2 a nutrient solution of 6  g N m– 2 gave highest yield, using 4  g m– 2 from two weeks before harvest and during harvest. ‘Florence’ and ‘Sonata’ developed well; however, ‘Florence’ had mildew on fruits in the last cropping year. ‘Korona’ presented well the first cropping year, but grew small fruits heavily infested by mildew in the last cropping year. CONCLUSION: Fertilization had effect on fruit yield. It is discussed how a fertilization <b>schedule</b> for the <b>establishment</b> year and cropping years {{can be adapted to}} plant development stages. Mildew infestation on fruits was dependent of cultivar and fertilization. Introducing sensors for recording of growth factors and in situ ion-levels of soil water nutrients, proved valuable...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSince mid- 2006, RWE Power {{has been}} {{planning}} {{the construction of}} a coal-based demonstration power plant with carbon capture, transport and storage. A combined-cycle gas turbine plant with integrated coal gasification (IGCC) was chosen as the power plant technology to be used. The use of a modern gas turbine of the F class enables the plant to achieve a gross electric capacity of approx. 450 MW. The separated CO 2 is to be stored safely over the long term in deep saline aquifers. The first grid connection is due to take place at the end of 2014 /start of 2015. As regards the power plant, a feasibility study was conducted to analyze and evaluate the technologies available in the process chain, decide on a technical concept, and establish the technical and economic parameters of the process. As far as CO 2 transport & storage is concerned, regional screening is about to be completed and the potential storage sites are being evaluated in-depth with respect to seismic data interpretation, lithology, and structure. This presentation will outline key findings and results of this phase for both the power plant and transport & storage and present the next steps to be taken in the execution of the project. In light of a market situation characterized by high capacity utilization of potential contractors and an extraordinary rise in investment costs this aspect is currently very important. Another basic prerequisite needed for the project to proceed according to <b>schedule</b> is the <b>establishment</b> of a European and national regulatory framework for carbon transport and storage by mid- 2009...|$|R

Our ability to accurately identify and classify these sequences is critical to understanding their impact on host genomes. At the same time, as we demonstrate in this report, problems with existing classification schemes have led to significant misunderstandings of the evolution of both TE sequences and their host genomes. In a pioneering publication Finnegan (1989) proposed classifying all TE sequences into two classes based on transposition mechanisms and structural features: the retrotransposons (class I) and the DNA transposons (class II). We have retraced how ideas regarding TE classification and annotation in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic scientific communities have changed over time.

40|$|Scheduling {{involves}} {{the allocation of}} limited resources to tasks over time. Due to the high complexity of scheduling problems, most scheduling algorithms and procedures are only suitable for specific cases and most scheduling systems are very application-oriented. Until now, no single scheduling system can handle all types of scheduling problems. With the recent development of client/server architecture and Internet technology, distributed problem solving {{by a group of}} systems become feasible where systems can exchange information, share resources and cooperate to solve large and complicated problems. Moreover, recent intensive research in intelligent software agents and agent technology has offered new tools of solving problems and coordination between systems. These tools allow systems to be represented as agents and coordinate their activities through message passing. However, most of the concepts and approaches have been applied to general applications and very little research has been studied the distributed approach to scheduling systems development. In this research, the framework of agent-based distributed scheduling is presented. The research is divided into three parts: the Internet <b>scheduling</b> systems, the <b>establishment</b> of communication infrastructure and the distributed problem solving policy. We begin by introducing the development of Internet scheduling systems, which is the basic component of the agent-based distributed scheduling systems. Next, we describe the communication infrastructure for the connection between scheduling systems. The communication infrastructure provides systems to exchange information and for the synchronization and collaboration between scheduling systems. And the communication language, syntax and semantics on the scheduling and system information are presented.

40|$|The Land Reform Programme in South Africa {{has fallen}} behind <b>schedule</b> since its <b>establishment</b> in 1994 {{due to a}} number of trials and challenges. By 2006, twelve years after its inception, the Department of Land Affairs had managed to {{transfer}} only 4. 1 % of the land to black people. The Department is also only now approaching the conclusion of claims lodged by the 1998 deadline. Of the 4. 1 % (5. 9 million ha) of land transferred, only a small percentage was productive {{due to a lack of}} financial and business management skills and institutional support from the government. In an effort to accelerate progress and ensure the productivity of transferred land, the Limpopo Provincial Department of Agriculture identified potential farm business management models to enable beneficiaries to secure capital and managerial skills. These management models include individual production, group access to land, and joint ventures with external parties through contractual arrangements. This study aimed to determine the effect of two management models (strategic partnership model and appointed manager model) on the financial position of land reform projects. Two projects were selected from the Sustainable Restitution Support of South Africa (SRS-SA) Programme, where an operational strategy for land restitution was developed for the Land Claims Commission. The farms are located in KwaZulu-Natal (Tala Valley Citrus) and Limpopo Province (Mogotle Citrus). Tala Valley Citrus entered into an agreement with a strategic partner, while Mogotle Citrus employed a manager. Qualitative and quantitative research methods were used for data collection, while a semi-structured questionnaire was used to obtain qualitative data from the CPA and Trust members, the manager, strategic partner, co-ordinator and facilitator. The study also made use of a financial model developed by ABSA to construct financial statements for both farms to determine their financial status. These financial statements of both farms were analysed and compared. The findings of the study reveal that at project or farm level, more focused interventions by key specialists are important for the execution of a project. Capacity-building of the CPA and Trust members and the community is essential in respect of the specific needs identified. Land use planning, especially during the pre-settlement phase, should be discussed with the relevant community and should, as far as possible, include the needs of the claiming community. The possibility of maintaining the current farming business concern must be addressed during the pre-settlement phase, and everybody involved in the settlement process should be informed. The specific training of beneficiaries in enterprise management (citrus) and business planning is essential for sustainable project implementation. The maintenance of claimed land during the transfer phase is essential and should receive the necessary attention by the key role players involved. The drafting of an interim business plan is crucial for beneficiaries to access funds, while the training of beneficiaries in this regard is important. Over the short term, the net profit, bank balance and return on equity (ROE) of Mogotle Citrus were found to be higher than that of Tala Valley Citrus due to the fact that Tala Valley Citrus made huge capital investments by acquiring new farming equipment, while Mogotle Citrus did not invest in new farming equipment. From the financial analysis of the two business management models, it is evident that Tala Valley Citrus was performing better than Mogotle Citrus due to the management model adopted.
