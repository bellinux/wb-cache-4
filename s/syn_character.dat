50|$|IBM Input/output devices {{utilizing}} the Bisync link protocol use the <b>SYN</b> <b>character</b> code {{to signal the}} beginning of each data frame transmitted.|$|E
50|$|The <b>SYN</b> <b>character</b> has the {{bit pattern}} 00010110 (EBCDIC 00110010), {{which has the}} {{property}} that it is distinct from any bit-wise rotation of itself. This helps bit-alignment of sequences of synchronous idles.|$|E
5000|$|In computing, Control-V is {{a control}} {{character}} in ASCII code, {{also known as}} the synchronous idle (<b>SYN)</b> <b>character.</b> It is generated by pressing the [...] key while holding down the [...] key on a computer keyboard.|$|E
50|$|Normal data frames do {{not allow}} certain {{characters}} {{to appear in the}} data. These are the block ending characters: ETB, ETX and ENQ and the ITB and <b>SYN</b> <b>characters.</b> The number of unique characters that can be transmitted is therefore limited to 59 for Transcode, 123 for USASCII, or 251 for EBCDIC.|$|R
40|$|Eighteen {{species of}} long-legged flies (Dolichopodidae) are {{reported}} as new to Finland. A further species, Microphorella praecox (Loew), is confirmed as a Finnish species. The status of Hydrophorus callosoma Frey, 1915 is re-evaluated and a lectotype is designated for the species. H. albosignatus Ringdahl, 1919 {{is found to}} be a junior synonym of H. callosoma (<b>syn.</b> n.). <b>Characters</b> for identifying both sexes of H. callosoma and H. altivagus Aldrich are presented and illustrated with high-quality photographs.

40|$|Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), as {{many other}} groups of animals and plants, {{simultaneously}} rep-resent preservation of ancestral karyotype {{in the majority of}} families {{with a high degree of}} chromosome number instability in numerous independently evolved phylogenetic lineages. However, the pattern and trends of karyotype evolution in some Lepidoptera families are poorly studied. Here I provide a survey of chromosome numbers in skippers (family Hesperiidae) based on intensive search and analysis of pub-lished data. I demonstrate that the majority of skippers preserve the haploid chromosome number n= 31 that seems to be an ancestral number for the Hesperiidae and the order Lepidoptera at whole. However, in the tribe Baorini the derived number n= 16 is the most typical state which can be used as a (<b>syn)</b> apo-morphic <b>character</b> in further phylogenetic investigations. Several groups of skippers display extreme chro-mosome number variations on within-species (e. g. the representatives of the genus Carcharodus HÃ¼bner, [1819]) and between-species (e. g. the genus Agathymus Freeman, 1959) levels. Thus, these groups can be used as model systems for future analysis of the phenomenon of chromosome instability. Interspecific chromosomal differences are also shown to be useful for discovering and describing new cryptic species of Hesperiidae representing in such a way a powerful tool in biodiversity research. Generally, the skippe...|$|R
5000|$|A later {{addition}} was [...] "RESYNC", {{allowing for}} file transfers to be restarted {{from where they}} left off. RESYNC added another indicator in the zero packet, byte 42, {{to indicate that the}} sender supports the feature. In this case, the receiver always checks to see if an identical filename exists locally, and if so, sends a <b>SYN</b> <b>character</b> instead of the normal ACK or NAK. The SYN is followed by the packet number at which to restart.|$|E
5000|$|All frame formats {{begin with}} at least two SYN bytes. The binary form of the SYN byte has the {{property}} that no rotation of the byte is equal to the original.This allows the receiver to find the beginning of a frame by searching the received bit stream for the SYN pattern. When this is found, tentative byte synchronization has been achieved. If the next character is also a <b>SYN,</b> <b>character</b> synchronization has been achieved. The receiver then searches for a character that can start a frame. Characters outside of this set are described as [...] "leading graphics". They are sometimes used to identify the sender of a frame. Long messages have SYN bytes inserted approximately every second to maintain synchronization. These are ignored by the receiver.|$|E
50|$|In film, Thorndike's {{appearances}} were infrequent. He played Macbeth (1922) in {{a silent}} version of the play opposite Sybil's Lady and also played leads in silent versions of other classic plays, including Scrooge (1923) as Old Ebenezer, and The School for Scandal (1923) as Sir Peter Teazle. He ended his film career in minor priest roles for Laurence Olivier in Hamlet (1948) and Richard III (1955). Although Thorndike appeared on the stage over four decades (including playing his own Dr. <b>Syn</b> <b>character</b> and entertaining audiences as Smee in ten revivals of Peter Pan, including the famous Scala Theatre version where Donald Sinden doubled the roles of Mr Darling and Captain Hook), he felt a deeper fulfilment in writing, which would include the later work The House of Jeffreys.|$|E
40|$|During a DNA barcoding {{campaign}} of leaf-mining insects from Siberia, a genetically divergent lineage of a gracillariid {{belonging to the}} genus Micrurapteryx was discovered, whose larvae developed on Caragana Fabr. and Medicago L. (Fabaceae). Specimens from Siberia showed similar external morphology to the Palearctic Micrurapteryx gradatella and the Nearctic Parectopa occulta but differed in male genitalia, DNA barcodes, and nuclear genes histone H 3 and 28 S. Members of this lineage are re-described here as Micrurapteryx caraganella (Hering, 1957), comb. n., an available name published with only {{a brief description of}} its larva and leaf mine. Micrurapteryx caraganella is widely distributed throughout Siberia, from Tyumen oblast in the West to Transbaikalia in the East. Occasionally it may severely affect its main host, Caragana arborescens Lam. This species has been confused in the past with Micrurapreryx gradatella in Siberia, but field observations confirm that M. gradatella exists in Siberia and is sympatric with M. caraganella, at least in the Krasnoyarsk region, where it feeds on different host plants (Vicia amoena Fisch. and Vicia sp.). In addition, based on both morphological and molecular evidence as well as examination of type specimens, the North American Parectopa occulta Braun, 1922 and Parectopa albicostella Braun, 1925 are transferred to Micrurapteryx as M. occulta (Braun, 1922), comb. n. with albicostella as its junior synonym (<b>syn.</b> n.). <b>Characters</b> used to distinguish Micrurapteryx from Parectopa are presented and illustrated. These findings provide another example of the potential of DNA barcoding to reveal overlooked species and illuminate nomenclatural problems...|$|R
