50|$|Various ship {{recognition}} manuals (defining {{things like}} weaponry, defenses and engine power) and a construction manual were released in 1985 as second edition volumes without the STIII branding. They included combat efficiency and weapon damage factor statistics (useful for comparing strength but having no gameplay effect) {{not included in}} the STIII rules. The final instalment was again titled Star Trek: Starship Tactical Combat Simulator (1986) and was all but identical to its predecessor, differing mostly in being published as a single book. It could be purchased as part of a boxed set with the second edition of the role playing game or as a standalone book which excluded necessities such as maps, <b>ship</b> <b>counters</b> and record sheets.|$|R
50|$|The game {{includes}} {{a variety of}} ship types, {{ranging in size from}} the small scouts and fighters to the mighty battleships. The <b>ship</b> <b>counters</b> are blue for the Terrans and red for the Imperium. Each counter {{includes a}} set of ratings, the ship type, and a silhouette. The combat ratings give the Beam weapon combat factor, the Missile factor, and the Screen factor. Beam weapons are for close range combat, while missiles are best fired at long range. Typically a beam weapon is slightly more effective than missiles, and Terrans have better beam weapon ratings while the Imperium favors missiles. Ships with a black silhouette can perform a jump between stars, while a white silhouette can only remain in orbit.|$|R
60|$|The chain sheets held on near a month, {{and then}} gave way. On examination, {{it was found that}} the {{parcelling}} had gone under the <b>ship's</b> <b>counter,</b> and that the copper had nearly destroyed the iron. After this, we mustered all the chains of the ship, of proper size, parcelled them very thoroughly, got another clove hitch around the rudder as before, and brought the ends to the hawse-holes, letting the bights fall, one on each side of the ship's keel. The ends were next brought to the windlass and hove taut. This answered pretty well, and stood until we got the ship into New York. Our whole passage was stormy, and lasted seventy days, as near as I can recollect. The ship was almost given up when we got in, and great was the joy at our arrival.|$|R
50|$|In April 1988, Lynde McCormick {{was one of}} many {{ships of}} the U.S. fifth fleet engaged in {{operations}} against the Iranian Navy.

50|$|The game {{is unusual}} for an Avalon Hill game {{in that there}} is no mapboard. Instead, the game {{operates}} on two levels: a higher level in which the two players use pencil marks on pre-printed paper maps of the North Sea to plot movements of their fleets, and, once fleets come into contact, a lower level in which the players deploy cardboard pieces each representing a single capital ship or a flotilla of light cruisers or destroyers on any convenient flat (and large) surface. Game play at the lower level is more like miniature play than like Avalon Hill's traditional hexgrid mapboard game. The game provided custom rulers for determining movement. The rulers had a rounded end for changing the direction of a line of ships. The game's instructions noted that the <b>ship</b> <b>counters</b> were not to scale in relation to movement rulers. Instructions were included for the gamer to make scale movement rulers. A large room was required to play at this scale.|$|R
50|$|Carrión {{took the}} {{initiative}} by utilizing the technological superiority of Western ships, and shelled a Wokou ship in the South China Sea, removing it from action. A retaliation came from the pirate leader Tay Fusa, who sailed toward the Philippine archipelago with 10 <b>ships.</b> To <b>counter</b> this, captain Carrión gathered forty soldiers and seven boats: five small support vessels, a light ship (San Yusepe) and a galley (La Capitana).|$|R
5000|$|The {{main focus}} {{of the game is}} the General War, an 18-year-long {{conflict}} set in the Star Fleet Universe that involves all the major powers of the Alpha Octant. The scale is extremely large compared to board games in a terrestrial setting, with each hex on the map representing 500 parsecs. As the rules point out, this reduces the Milky Way Galaxy as shown on the map to a two dimensional object, because only the core would have a cross-section greater than one hex and the core is not rendered on the map. Units are typically individual ships, each with its own combat rating. Each of the interstellar governments or [...] "empires" [...] can have dozens, perhaps hundreds, of ships, leading to a game with a potentially very high number of counters used, on a map that is only as large as a [...] "small" [...] strategy game. However, significantly larger maps are available for purchase directly from ADB that greatly reduce this problem. Player aids also permit individual counters to represent large fleets, with the constituent <b>ship</b> <b>counters</b> being kept off map.|$|R

50|$|At 6am on the 23, {{the ships}} of the inshore {{squadron}} {{were ordered to}} attack the ships on the north beach. After a preliminary bombardment the boats were despatched, and about 8.30 {{am one of the}} fireships grappled the Terrible, which was in a more exposed position. Finding her deserted the fireship captain refrained from igniting his ship, but boarded Terrible and started fires with what material was to hand; for this he was much commended in saving his charge for a better occasion. Meanwhile, the boats closed with the other ships. They were accompanied by another fireship, which drew the fire from the French batteries; the supporting <b>ships</b> <b>countered,</b> sweeping the French gun platforms, which were too exposed to continue. One boat, from the Eagle, grounded on the shore, and was attacked by French cavalry; in a highly unusual encounter, one of the troopers was pulled down by a sailor using a boathook, before the boat was re-floated. Resistance melted away as the attack was pressed, and the English sailors were able to board and fire the five remaining great ships along the north beach.|$|R

50|$|According to Carol Rosenberg, {{writing in}} the Miami Herald, the vessel was {{scheduled}} to be place out of service in 2014.

The Coast Guard would use the <b>ship</b> to <b>counter</b> smugglers in the Caribbean Sea, where she would be stationed as a permanent helicopter station. Coast Guard sharpshooters could be quickly dispatched to intercept and apprehend smugglers. Retrofitting the ship with facilities to operate and maintain a helicopter would cost $10 million.|$|R

50|$|The {{program was}} started by Admiral Arleigh Burke as a {{response}} to estimates that the Soviets would have a force of about 300 modern fast-attack submarines by 1957. The US Navy was unable to produce enough destroyer escorts (frigates after 1975) and other anti-submarine warfare-capable <b>ships</b> to <b>counter</b> this threat, given other priorities such as new anti-aircraft warfare-capable frigates (cruisers after 1975) and aircraft carriers, so Burke instead looked for ways to modify the existing World War II-era destroyer fleet, which was rapidly becoming outdated anyway.|$|R
50|$|Some {{ships are}} built with {{magnetic}} inductors, large coils placed along the <b>ship</b> to <b>counter</b> the <b>ship's</b> magnetic field. Using magnetic probes in strategic {{parts of the}} ship, {{the strength of the}} current in the coils can be adjusted to minimize the total magnetic field. This is a heavy and clumsy solution, suited only to small-to-medium-sized ships. Boats typically lack the generators and space for the solution, while the amount of power needed to overcome the magnetic field of a large ship is impractical.|$|R
2500|$|The {{introduction}} of fast torpedo {{boats in the}} late 19th century was a serious concern to the era's naval strategists. In response, navies operating large ships introduced smaller <b>ships</b> to <b>counter</b> torpedo boats, mounting light quick-firing guns. These ships, which {{came to be called}} [...] "torpedo boat destroyers" [...] and later simply [...] "destroyers", became larger and took on more roles, making torpedo attacks as well as defending against them, and eventually defending against submarines and aircraft. The destroyer eventually became the predominant type of surface warship in the guided missile age.|$|R
50|$|After the {{publication}} of Walter Lords book A Night to Remember in 1955, Captain Stanley Lord sought a re-hearing of the Inquiry relating to his <b>ship,</b> to <b>counter</b> the allegations made in the book.

However, {{as a result of}} Ballards expedition showing that Titanic was not in the position determined in the original investigation, the Board of Trade ordered a re-examination.|$|R
