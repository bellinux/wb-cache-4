50|$|During World War II, {{as part of}} the Barron Plan (Plano Barron), {{the range}} was mainly used for storing {{anti-aircraft}} ammunition and artillery to aid in the aerial defense of the capital (Lisbon) and nearby military installations. This led to the range being transferred to the command of the Artillery Arm Directorate, integrated in the 1st Air Defense Group of Lisbon, and most of the <b>complex's</b> <b>installations</b> being abandoned {{after the end of the}} war.|$|R
50|$|In 1998, Glass Horizon, an {{installation}} comprising {{a projection of}} a pair of eyes onto the facade of the Vienna Secession building after it had closed for the night, showcased an interest in architectural structures and in art that interacts with urban environments.

5000|$|Diversity techniques: To {{improve the}} quality of the {{received}} signal, often two receiving antennas are used, placed at a distance equal to an odd multiple of a quarter of the corresponding wavelength. For 900 MHz, this wavelength is 30 cm. This technique, known as antenna diversity or space diversity, avoids interruption caused by path fading. The antennas can be spaced horizontally or vertically. Horizontal spacing requires more <b>complex</b> <b>installation,</b> but brings better performance.|$|R

30|$|In the {{relevant}} social-science literature it is unanimously assumed {{that only a}} complementary system interpretation is sufficient for the optimal exploitation of the technological and economic potential of smart production systems, for it doesn’t relegate human intervention in work systems to only a few fragmentary functional remains, as does the technology-centered automation concept. Instead, the complementary conception opens design possibilities for work that minimizes e.g. awareness and feedback problems of acting on <b>complex</b> <b>installations,</b> make possible informal and manipulative action and ongoing learning processes, and thereby permit a sufficient regulative capacity of the total system.|$|R

From Complex Adaptive Systems {{to the world of}} order of Michel Foucault to the reexamination of the Modernist movement by Yve Alain Bois and Rosalind Krauss, a rhizomatic path of connections and lines form and cross over, weaving together into a swarming mayhem of over population. Out of this chaos and order grow <b>complex</b> <b>installations</b> and constructions that are inherently bound by the system of their making, yet attempt at every turn to escape conformity...|$|R
40|$|Conducted {{spurious}} phenomena cause {{interference in}} the power supply network of <b>complex</b> <b>installations.</b> The time dependent behaviour of these phenomena calls for dedicated measurement techniques in time domain. Quantities to measure are defined for DM as well as CM. Various measurement sensors are designed, implemented, characterised and tested. Frequency domain measurement equipment is not suitable for these time variant disturbances. Signal processing on the time domain data provides the necessary characteristics of the system. The proposed measurement methods {{provide a basis for}} the analysis of conducted behaviour of equipment as well as fixed installations...|$|R
40|$|This article {{describes}} the approach developed to model the topology of a complex harness. The modeling {{is based on the}} multi-conductor transmission line network theory. The topological model of the complex harness was validated using S-parameter simulations compared with measurements. The low-frequency results demonstrate the capability to correctly describe the topology of this type of wiring structure, including realistic and <b>complex</b> <b>installation</b> configurations. The results also show the importance of taking into account losses much larger than the usual skin effect wire loss models in order to reach good agreement with measurement...|$|R
50|$|VistA was {{developed}} using the M or MUMPS language/database. The VA currently runs {{a majority of}} VistA systems on the proprietary InterSystems Caché version of MUMPS, but an open source MUMPS database engine, called GT.M, for Linux and Unix computers has also been developed. Although initially separate releases, publicly available VistA distributions are now often bundled with the GT.M database in an integrated package. This has considerably eased installation. The free, open source nature of GT.M allows redundant and cost-effective failsafe database implementations, increasing reliability for <b>complex</b> <b>installations</b> of VistA.|$|R

The artist's work spans a range of media, {{including}} drawing, sculpture, video, performance, and the internet. Originally working under the alias asianpunkboy, Koh designed zines and custom-made books. His recent work has expanded to include durational performances, <b>complex</b> <b>installations,</b> and the exploration of natural ecosystems.

50|$|Epoxy/Urethane Systems: Epoxy/urethane {{systems are}} also topical film membranes. They share {{many of the}} same {{characteristics}} as acrylics, but the performance levels and life span are superior and commensurately more costly with more <b>complex</b> <b>installation</b> requirements. Novolac epoxies are particularly noted for chemical resistance and acid resistance. High-end urethanes are known to be extremely abrasion resistant. Epoxy/urethane systems are frequently used in demanding applications such as factory floors, garage floors, and restaurants, and water-based versions are often used to seal concrete countertops. Epoxy/urethane systems are generally applied only to fully cured existing concrete, although certain epoxy products can comply with ASTM C309.|$|R
50|$|Craig-Martin {{has lived}} and worked in London since 1966. From his early box-like constructions of the late 1960s he moved {{increasingly}} to the use of ordinary household objects. In the late 1970s he began to make line drawings of ordinary objects, creating over the years an ever-expanding vocabulary of images which form the foundation of his work to this day. During the 1990s the focus of his work shifted decisively to painting, with the same range of boldly outlined motifs and vivid color schemes applied both to works on canvas, and to increasingly <b>complex</b> <b>installations</b> of wall paintings.|$|R
40|$|JavaScript {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular {{programming}} languages on the web. Despite the language popularity and the increasing size of JavaScript systems, there is a limited number of visualization tools that can be used by developers to comprehend, maintain, and evolve JavaScript software. In this paper, we introduce JSCity, an implementation in JavaScript of the well-known Code City software visualization metaphor. JSCity relies on JavaScript features and libraries to show "software cities" in standard web browsers, without requiring <b>complex</b> <b>installation</b> procedures. We also report our experience on producing visualizations for 40 popular JavaScript systems using JScity...|$|R
