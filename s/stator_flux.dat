The squirrel-cage of these generators must be modeled with a double-cage for accuracy purposes. These proposed reduced-order models are valid for unbalanced grid conditions (unsymmetrical faults), which require flux and current decomposition into positive- and negative-sequences. Three reduced-order models are obtained: R 2 model, where the derivative of the positive- and negativesequences of the <b>stator</b> <b>fluxes</b> are neglected (the usual approach in the literature); R 1 model, where the derivative of the negativesequence of the rotor fluxes are also neglected (proposed model); and R 0 model, where all the <b>stator</b> and rotor <b>fluxes</b> are neglected (steady-state electrical model). The analytical models are validated with simulations carried out in MATLABTM and with experimental tests. The results show that R 1 model (proposed model) shows a good performance (similar to the full-order model) under unbalanced conditions.

40|$|Abstract—The {{interior}} permanent-magnet (IPM) {{synchronous motor}} {{is characterized by}} a high rotor anisotropy. Such an anisotropy is the cause of a high harmonic content of the air-gap ﬂux density distribution, almost independent of the main ﬂux.

This aspect is prominently evident during ﬂux-weakening operations, when the armature current weakens the permanent magnet ﬂux and the motor runs above the base speed. This paper presents a complete study of such a phenomenon, including an analytical model and a ﬁnite element validation, as well as an experimental conﬁrmation of the predicted <b>stator</b> tooth <b>ﬂux</b> waveforms.
