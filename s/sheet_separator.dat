40|$|A sealed, low {{maintenance}} battery (10, 100) is formed of a casing (14, 102) having a sealed lid (12, 104) enclosing cell compartments (22, 110) formed by walls (24, 132). The cells comprise a stack (26) of horizontally disposed negative active plates (30) and positive active plates (28) interspersed with porous, resilient <b>separator</b> <b>sheets</b> (30). Each plate has {{a set of}} evenly spaced tigs (40, 41) disposed on one side thereof; like polarity tigs being disposed {{on one side and}} opposite polarity tigs on the other. Columns of tigs are electrically and mechanically joined by vertical bus bars (46). The bus bars contain outwardly projecting arms (56) of opposite polarity which are electrically joined at each partition wall (24) to electrically connect the cells in series. The stack is compressed by biasing means such as resilient pad (58) attached to the lid or by joining the tigs (52) to the post (48) at a distance less than the thickness of the mat (124). The end bus bars (46) are joined to straps (60, 62) which connect to the terminals (16, 18). The negative plates contain more capacity than the positive plates and the starved electrolyte imbibed in the <b>separator</b> <b>sheets</b> permits pressurized operation during which oxygen diffuses through the <b>separator</b> <b>sheet</b> to the negative plate where it recombines. Excess pressure is relieved through the vent and pressure relief valve (20) ...|$|R
50|$|To allow {{efficient}} stacking {{of product}} in the furnace during sintering and prevent parts sticking together, many manufacturers separate ware using ceramic powder <b>separator</b> <b>sheets.</b> These sheets are available in various materials such as alumina, zirconia and magnesia. They are additionally categorized by fine, medium and coarse particle sizes. By matching the material and particle size to the ware being sintered, surface damage and contamination can be reduced while maximizing furnace loading.|$|R
40|$|Apparatus for {{detecting}} loads {{applied to a}} surface, including a platen providing a continuous surface which is stiff relative to the loads being detected, a load receiving sheet extending over the platen surface and having an outer surface exposed to the loads, and, preferably, a layer of deformable material underlying the sheet and which is deformed when loads are applied to the <b>sheet.</b> A <b>separator</b> having regularly spaced apertures or gaps lies between the deformable layer and the platen surface, this being thin enough that loads to be measured applied to the outer surface of the sheet cause parts of the deformable layer to be pushed through the apertures or gaps {{into contact with the}} platen surface. The platen is preferably transparent, and a video camera is provided for viewing the platen surface and detecting areas where the deformable layer contacts the platen surface.

50|$|Print spoolers {{can often}} be {{configured}} to add a banner page (also called a burst page, job <b>sheet,</b> or printer <b>separator)</b> {{to the front of}} each document. These separate documents from each other, identify each document (e.g. with its title) and often also state who printed it (e.g. by username or job name). Banner pages are valuable in office environments where many people share a small number of printers. Depending on the configuration, banner pages might be generated on each client computer, or on a centralized print server, or by the printer itself.|$|R
30|$|Electrode {{material}} for supercapacitor fabrication was prepared using activated carbon (AC) derived from areca fibres [34] using polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder dissolved in N-methylpyrrolidone (3 : 1 ratio). PVDF binder solution was mixed with AC in 0.3 : 1 weight ratio and grinded {{by means of}} pestle and mortar to form slurry. The obtained slurry was screen printed (200  µm mesh size) on two stainless steel electrodes. The thicknesses of the coated AC layer on electrodes were around 30  µm having weight of ~ 2 to 3  mg each. The supercapacitor cell was constructed using SPE sandwiched between two prepared AC-coated electrodes. The unit cell was sealed in a plastic-coated aluminium pouch keeping the two wires outside. We also fabricated a cell with 2  mol dm− 3 H 2 SO 4 solution without SPE using polypropylene <b>sheet</b> as <b>separator.</b> Electrochemical characterization {{was carried out by}} CV, AC impedance and GCD studies. All the electrochemical studies were carried out using a BioLogic SP- 150 instrument.|$|R

40|$|Results of a {{test program}} {{designed}} {{to determine the effects}} of 100 temperature and compressive loading cycles on several multilayer insulation materials and composites. A total of four reflector materials, four separator materials, eight face-sheet systems, and one fastener material were subjected to 100 temperature cycles from - 320 to 400 or 650 F. Generic types of materials studied included Mylar, Kapton, Dacron, Nomex, and Beta Glass. The temperature cycling was followed by visual inspection, metal adhesion tests on the reflectors, and tensile tests of the face <b>sheets,</b> fastener, and <b>separators.</b> A total of six composites were subjected to compressive cycles between zero and 0. 15 psi, and density changes were measured. Application of the experimental results to the shuttle orbiter is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Aiming at {{both high}} energy and power density, {{asymmetric}} supercapacitors with screen printed lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO 2) and graphene oxide GO as electrode materials were assembled. LiCoO 2 was synthesized by a facile and inexpensive hydrothermal method, whereas GO was synthesized {{according to a}} modified Hummer's method. Both powders were coated on flexible stainless steel substrates using screen printing technology. Finally, asymmetric supercapacitors were assembled using LiCoO 2 as positive and GO as negative electrode with a porous polypropylene <b>sheet</b> as <b>separator</b> and an aqueous electrolyte solution of LiClO 4. The electrochemical properties of this asymmetric cell were investigated by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge experiments. The asymmetric supercapacitor LiCoO 2 //GO could be cycled reversibly in the wide voltage region 0 – 1. 5 V; it shows an impressive performance with an energy density of 19. 2 Whkg– 1 (based on the total mass of the active materials of the two electrodes). Importantly, this device exhibits an excellent long cycling life with 85 [*]% specific capacitance retained after 1500 cycles. A demonstration cell could effectively light up an LED.

40|$|AbstractSupercapacitor {{consists}} of two carbon electrodes and wooden <b>sheet</b> as a <b>separator.</b> Three types of carbon electrodes were prepared; carbon black (CB), multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) and composites of MWNTs and CB (MWNTs-CB). Electrode pastes were coated {{on both sides of}} wooden sheet. The thickness of wooden sheet was varies from 1 mm to 5 mm. The morphology of CB, MWNTs and MWNTs-CB were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The supercapacitor performance was characterized by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge techniques. Among carbon electrode materials, MWNTs-CB shows the highest specific capacitance. The high specific capacitance of MWNTs-CB {{may be due to the}} high surface area of MWNTs incorporated with CB acting as spacer for MWNTs agglomeration protection and electrolyte- electrode accessibility improvement. Moreover, wooden sheet with a thickness of 2 mm shows the highest specific capacitance...|$|R
40|$|This {{project was}} {{initiated}} to develop alternative separator materials to the previously used asbestos matrices which {{were removed from}} the market for health and environmental reasons. The objective of the research was to find a material or combination of materials that had the following characteristics: (1) resistant to the severe conditions encountered in Ni-H 2 cells; (2) satisfactory electrical, electrolyte management, and thermal management properties to function properly; (3) environmentally benign; and (4) capable of being manufactured into a separator matrix. During the course of the research it was discovered that separators prepared from wettable polyethylene fibers along and in combination with potassium titanate pigment performed satisfactory in preliminary characterization tests. Further studies lead to the optimization of the separator composition and manufacturing process. Single ply <b>separator</b> <b>sheets</b> were manufactured with 100 percent polyethylene fibers and also with a combination of polyethylene fibers and potassium titanate pigment (PKT) in the ratio of 60 percent PKT and 40 percent fibers. A pilot paper machine was used to produce the experimental separator material by a continuous, wet laid process. Both types of matrices were produced at several different area densities (grams/sq m) ...|$|R
