40|$|Road {{selection}} {{is a critical}} component of road network generalization that directly affects its accuracy. However, most conventional selection methods are based solely on either a linear or an areal representation mode, often resulting in low selection accuracy and biased structural selection. In this paper we propose an improved hybrid method combining the linear and areal representation modes to increase the accuracy of road selection. The proposed method offers two primary advantages. First, it improves the <b>stroke</b> <b>generation</b> algorithm in a linear representation mode by using an ordinary least square (OLS) model to consider overall information for the roads to be connected. Second, by taking advantage of the areal representation mode, the proposed method partitions road networks and calculates road density based on weighted Voronoi diagrams. Roads were selected using stroke importance and a density threshold. Finally, experiments were conducted comparing the proposed technique with conventional single representation methods. Results demonstrate the increased <b>stroke</b> <b>generation</b> accuracy and improved road selection achieved by this method...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis poster {{presents}} {{research in}} progress towards the simulation of handmade painterly animation. As researches on painterly animation mostly focus on temporal coherence, {{the generation of}} an animation {{that could have been}} done by hand remains an open challenging problem. To produce an hand made painterly animation, the artist paints on a retro-lighted glass canvas. He creates successive frames one over the other. The artist erase, smears and adds paint to produce each frame. We propose to render painterly animations with a visual aspect tending towards hand made results. To this end, we combines two techniques: an automatic strokes generator and a paint simulator. We observe that previous approaches could not adapt as-is to our goals for the two following reasons:Paint appearance in painterly animation is back lighted, most of paint contrast comes from paint thickness which is usually not compute by paint simulation approaches. Automatic <b>strokes</b> <b>generation</b> make the assumption that a stroke covers underlying strokes without having thickness accumulation, in our case paint thickness quickly increase if we do not apply special treatment. We also investigate new kind of strokes that are only possible with a paint simulation approach as smear and erase strokes...|$|R

This paper proposes an stroke direction modulation technique for watermarking in Chinese text images. The watermark produced by the idea offers robustness to print-photocopy-scan, yet provides relatively high embedding capacity without losing the transparency. During the embedding phase, the angle of rotatable strokes are quantized to embed the bits. This requires several stages of preprocessing, including <b>stroke</b> <b>generation,</b> junction searching, rotatable stroke decision and character partition. Moreover, shuffling is applied to equalize the uneven embedding capacity. For the data detection, denoising and deskewing mechanisms are used {{to compensate for the}} distortions induced by hardcopy.

40|$|In the {{development}} of computer graphics, non-photorealistic rendering (NPR) technology has been a focus of research in recent years. In comparison with photo-realistic rendering which simulates realistic natural images, NPR provides more concise and humanistic expressiveness in images. Among the many types of workflow in NPR technology, the procedural type provides the user an easier and simplified workflow. However, procedural NPR algorithms usually produce uniform and non-humanistic images {{due to a lack}} of interaction with the user. Since silhouettes are an important feature of edges for expressing the shape of an object, our work takes silhouettes as examples to propose a stroke construction workflow based on edge topology wherein users can combine pure stroke elements according to user-defined rules for their formation. Thus, more humanistic expressions can be added to the resulting silhouettes. First, the procedural NPR framework for <b>stroke</b> <b>generation</b> is outlined. Then, the mainstream NPR techniques and their respective theorems are discussed, followed by an introduction to the framework and algorithm of the proposed system and a discussion thereof.

We attempted to quantify the torque generation in the lower limb, selectively and as an abnormal synergy, and its relation with gait.

Recent studies also confirmed that NOX inhibitors ameliorate brain injury and improve neurological outcome after stroke. However, the physiological and pathophysiological roles of NOX enzymes in the central nervous system (CNS) are not known well.

40|$|Background and Purpose—The {{neurotoxic}} and neuroprotective role of {{nitric oxide}} (NO) in experimental cerebral ischemia has generated considerable debate. The {{aim of this}} study was to analyze the relationship between NO metabolite (NO-m) concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and clinical and neuroimaging parameters of brain injury in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Methods—We studied 102 patients and 24 control subjects who were included in a larger previous study conducted to analyze risk factors of progressing <b>stroke.</b> NO <b>generation</b> was calculated by quantifying nitrates and nitrites with a colorimetric assay in CSF samples obtained within the first 24 hours from symptoms onset. Early neurological deterioration was defined as a fall of 1 or more points in Canadian Stroke Scale score between admission and 48 hours after inclusion. Infarct volume was measured on days 4 to 7 by cranial CT. Results—Median NO-m concentrations [quartiles] were 2. 1 [1. 0, 4. 5] mmol/mL in patients and 1. 0 [1. 0, 1. 0] mmol/mL in control subjects (P, 0. 0001). In 45 patients with subsequent early neurological deterioration, NO-m levels in CSF were significantly higher than in those with stable stroke (4. 0 [1. 7, 7. 8] versus in 1. 6 [1. 0, 2. 5] mmol/mL, P, 0. 0001). There was a moderate correlation between NO-m and infarct volume (coefficient 0. 39, P, 0. 001). NO-m concentrations. 5. 0 mmol/mL were significantly associated with early neurological worsening (OR 5. 7, 95 % CI 1. 2 to 27. 4; P 50. 030) independent of other important factors related to progressing stroke, such as CSF glutamate levels...|$|R

40|$|Objective—A high {{thrombin}} generation {{level has}} been associated with the risk of venous thrombosis. Whether changes in this biomarker are relevant to arterial disease remains unknown. We investigated the association of thrombin generation with coronary heart disease (CHD) and acute ischemic stroke (AIS) in the elderly. Methods and Results—We used data from the Three-City study, a prospective cohort including 9294 subjects aged 65 years. After 4 years of follow-up, a case-cohort study was established. Using the calibrated automated thrombography method, endogenous thrombin potential and peak height were measured in plasma samples of all CHD and AIS cases and a random sample of 1177 controls. We did not find any significant association between thrombin generation and CHD. In multivariate analyses, high levels of endogenous thrombin potential and peak height were associated with an increased risk of AIS (hazard ratio 1. 16 [95 % CI, 0. 90 to 1. 50] and 1. 31 [95 % CI, 1. 01 to 1. 69] for a 1 SD increase, respectively). Data also suggested that these associations might be more important in women (hazard ratio 1. 55 [95 % CI, 1. 05 to 2. 33] and 1. 71 [95 % CI, 1. 11 to 2. 63], respectively) than in men (P for interaction 0. 04 and 0. 08, respectively). Conclusion—Thrombin generation emerges as an independent predictor of AIS, particularly in women. Hypercoagulability may have {{an important role in the}} pathogenesis of AIS.

In the present study, we evaluated the versatility of a virtual tilt pad presentation that is a progression from our previous study. In the tilt pad presentation, the rotations around the x-axis and y-axis are managed by the centroid position of the operator's fingers. In the evaluation, the subjects tried to compare the size of two virtual spheres to evaluate the 3 D-shape presentation capability of the display. Since the sensation thresholds for each subject were low enough, we proved that operators could appreciate a fine distinction of sphere radii generated by the proposed display. In {{the case of a}} relatively large sphere, which is the most difficult case because it has the smallest curvature, the discrimination tasks improved with slight tapping as compared to pressing and rubbing with the fingers.

Our data in fact revealed that MF activates counteractive mechanisms primarily associated with the Nrf 2 pathway which drastically reduce CS toxicity at the cerebrovascular level. These include the suppression of tight junction (TJ) protein downregulation and loss of BBB integrity induced by CS, reduction of inflammation and oxidative stress, renormalization of the expression levels of the major BBB glucose transporter Glut- 1 and that of the anticoagulant factor thrombomodulin.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to enable {{seamless}} transformation of product concepts to CAD models. This necessitates availability of 3 D product sketches. The present work concerns intuitive generation of 3 D strokes and intrinsic support for space sharing and articulation for {{the components of the}} product being sketched. Direct creation of 3 D strokes in air lacks in precision, stability and control. The inadequacy of proprioceptive feedback for the task is complimented in this work with stereo vision and haptics. Three novel methods based on pencil-paper interaction analogy for haptic rendering of strokes have been investigated. The pen-tilt based rendering is simpler and found to be more effective. For the spatial conformity, two modes of constraints for the stylus movements, corresponding to the motions on a control surface and in a control volume have been studied using novel reactive and field based haptic rendering schemes. The field based haptics, which in effect creates an attractive force field near a surface, though non-realistic, provided highly effective support for the control-surface constraints. The efficacy of the reactive haptic rendering scheme for the constrained environments has been demonstrated using scribble strokes. This can enable distributed collaborative 3 D concept development. The notion of motion constraints, defined through sketch <b>strokes</b> enables intuitive <b>generation</b> of articulated 3 D sketches and direct exploration of motion annotations found in most product concepts.

Study population included 120 consecutive AIS patients, all within 4. 5 hours of their symptom onset, who underwent thrombolysis by rt-PA. Blood samples were collected from all patients upon admission and TGT was performed using platelet poor plasma. Clinical data of patients including the NIHSS were registered at admission, day 1 and 7 after therapy. The ASPECT score was assessed using CT images taken before and 24 hours after thrombolysis. Long-term functional outcome was defined 3 months after the event by the modified Rankin Scale. Endogenous Thrombin Potential (ETP) and Peak Thrombin were significantly lower in patients with cardioembolic IS. Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (SICH) was found in 6 patients and was significantly associated with low ETP and Peak Thrombin levels. A multiple logistic regression model revealed that an ETP result in the lower quartile is an independent predictor of mortality within the first two weeks (OR: 6. 03; 95 %CI: 1. 2 - 30. 16, p< 0. 05) and three months after the event (OR: 5. 28; 95 %CI: 1. 27 - 21. 86, p< 0. 05).

Two-point thrombin generation assays showed prolonged lag time and time to peak at baseline (3. 3 (2. 9, 4. 0) versus 3. 6 (3. 2, 4. 7); p= 0. 005) and (3. 3 (2. 9, 4. 0) versus 3. 6 (3. 2, 4. 7); p= 0. 002), respectively, and at time 2 (3. 5 (2. 9, 4. 2) versus 4. 0 (3. 1, 4. 9); p= 0. 004) and (5. 9 (5. 3, 6. 6) versus 6. 8 (5. 8, 7. 7) p= 0. 05), respectively, in cardioembolic stroke (n= 39), when compared to noncardioembolic stroke (n= 117). The result was reproduced in multiple comparisons between acute ischaemic stroke subgroups and normal healthy volunteers. Endogenous thrombin potential and peak thrombin did not indicate hypercoagulability after acute ischaemic stroke, and thrombolytic therapy did not affect thrombin generation assays. Conclusion. Our findings suggest that thrombin generation in platelet poor plasma is not useful in defining hypercoagulability in acute ischaemic stroke. This is similar to observed trend in coronary artery disease and contrary to other hypercoagulable states...|$|R
