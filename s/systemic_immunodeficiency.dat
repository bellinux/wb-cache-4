50|$|The {{most common}} organ {{affected}} by aspergilloma is the lung. Aspergilloma mainly affects people with underlying cavitary lung disease such as tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis and <b>systemic</b> <b>immunodeficiency.</b> Aspergillus fumigatus, {{the most common}} causative species, is typically inhaled as small (2 to 3 micron) spores. The fungus settles in a cavity {{and is able to}} grow free from interference because critical elements of the immune system are unable to penetrate into the cavity. As the fungus multiplies, it forms a ball, which incorporates dead tissue from the surrounding lung, mucus, and other debris.|$|E
40|$|Polymerase chain {{reaction}} assays are {{a powerful tool}} for detecting the presence of infectious genomes in the cerebrospinal fluid. Positive results always mean a current or pending infection of the central nervous system. Subacute (> 7 days) or chronic infections induce an intrathecal humoral immune response and the appearance of oligoclonal IgG antibodies directed against the causal infectious agent. This local synthesis may be observed even in cases of severe <b>systemic</b> <b>immunodeficiency.</b> The use of polymerase {{chain reaction}}s in combination with the detection of a specific intrathecal immune response should represent the most reliable strategy for the diagnosis of viral and chronic infections of the central nervous system. The authors describe their experience, using this approach, in herpetic encephalitis, acute and recurrent herpetic meningitis, varicella zoster-induced neurological diseases, cytomegalovirus encephalitis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalitis and tuberculous meningitis...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Scabies, {{infection}} with Sarcoptes scabiei, {{is known to}} be predisposed to by poor body hygiene, environmental exposure, and <b>systemic</b> <b>immunodeficiency.</b> We report the case of an 83 -year-old man with Sezary’s syndrome who developed scabies limited to the skin of the upper chest, the same location where he had previously received electron beam radiation treatments for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Histologic and immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that sections of the previously irradiated right and left chest skin, compared to non-irradiated chest, abdominal, and leg skin, had infestation by scabies, diminished involvement by T-cell lymphoma, and notably reduced numbers of Langerhans cells. These findings suggest that the development of scabies may be predisposed to by local cutaneous radiation therapy, and that it may be mediated by local cutaneous immunodeficiency secondary to reduced numbers of Langerhans cells.

40|$|Although ageing is {{accompanied}} by <b>systemic</b> <b>immunodeficiencies,</b> {{the status of the}} mucosal immune system in the elderly remains unresolved. The gastrointestinal mucosal immune response was evaluated in young, mature and old male rats subjected to intra-intestinal immunization with cholera toxin (CTx). Five days following secondary immunization, the alpha-CTx-IgA titre in the bile of immunized rats was markedly reduced, i. e. the values measured in young rats were approximately five-fold higher than those of old animals. alpha-CTx-IgA levels in non-immunized rats were negligible and age-related shifts in other antibody titres (alpha-CTx IgG and IgM) were not significant. The antibody response to CTx was not reflected in the total IgA content of the samples. The number of alpha-CTx antibody-containing cells (ACCs) in the small intestinal lamina propria was significantly reduced in old immunized rats in comparison with the young or mature animals. These data suggest that ageing compromises both non-immune cell (antibody transport by hepatocytes) and immune cell (number of ACCs in the gut wall) functions in response to cholera toxin immunization in this animal model...|$|R
40|$|A 69 -year-old {{man with}} chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia was {{initially}} treated with 100 mg dasatinib once a day. Despite a major molecular response within 9 months, he developed hemorrhagic colitis 32 months after starting dasatinib. Colonoscopy identified multiple hemorrhagic ulcers in the transverse colon. The pathological findings indicated cytomegalovirus infection. Dasatinib was stopped {{and he was}} started on ganciclovir. Three months later, colonoscopy confirmed {{the disappearance of the}} hemorrhagic ulcers. Dasatinib is a second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor used to treat chronic myeloid leukemia. As a multi-kinase inhibitor that acts on SRC-family kinases, its broader off-target kinase-inhibitory activity may account for the adverse events of dasatinib. Although gastrointestinal bleeding is common in patients taking dasatinib, the combination of cytomegalovirus infection and hemorrhagic colitis in the absence of <b>systemic</b> <b>immunodeficiency</b> is rare. Based on this case of dasatinibinduced hemorrhagic colitis with cytomegalovirus infection, we describe a possible mechanism and effective treatment...|$|E
40|$|Malignant lymphomas {{frequently}} {{develop in}} the pleural cavity of patients with long-standing pyothorax. Thus, the term pyothorax-associated lymphoma (PAL) has been proposed {{for this type of}} tumor. Most PALs are diffuse lymphomas of B cell type and contain Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA. We have established two lymphoma cell lines from the biopsy specimens of PAL cases, OPL- 1 and OPL- 2. Both cell lines contain EBV DNA, but only OPL- 1 expresses EBV nuclear antigen 2, which works as a target molecule for the cell-mediated immune response. As <b>systemic</b> <b>immunodeficiency</b> is unlikely to be present in PAL patients, PAL from which OPL- 1 derived was not expected to be fully developed. In this study, we examined the expression of immunosuppressive factors in OPLs. Only OPL- 1, not OPL- 2, expressed interleukin- 10 (IL- 10) mRNA and secreted IL- 10 into culture supernatant. Both OPL- 1 and OPL- 2 expressed transforming growth factor (TGF) -beta 1 mRNA; however, neither expressed latent TGF-beta-binding protein mRNA at a detectable level by Northern blot analysis. Because TGF-beta expresses its functions in cooperation with latent TGF-beta-binding protein, the biological functions of TGF-beta 1 could be negligible. Neither cell line expressed at a detectable level EBV BCRF- 1 mRNA, a viral gene product that is partly homologous to human IL- 10 and shares biological activities of IL- 10. Although IL- 10 is reported to promote the growth of activated or neoplastic B cells, OPL- 1 did not respond to human recombinant IL- 10 by growing faster. As OPL- 1 expresses a target antigen for the host cytotoxic T-cell response, the production of an immuno-suppressive cytokine, IL- 10, might {{contribute to the development of}} overt lymphoma by inducing locally immunosuppressive circumstances. The present study suggests that an immunosuppressive cytokine plays a role in lymphomagenesis of immunocompetent patients...|$|E

40|$|Reactive hemophagocytic {{syndrome}} is clinically characterized by fever, hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, and coagulopathy, and is histologically characterized by excessive proliferation and activation of histiocytes or macrophages. It can occur with <b>systemic</b> infections, <b>immunodeficiency,</b> or underlying malignancy. Brucellosis {{is one of}} the rare causes of hemophagocytosis. Herein we report an 11 -year-old male with pancytopenia due to hemophagocytosis during the course of brucellosis that responded favorably to therapy. Although rare, hemophagocytosis should be considered as a possible cause of pancytopenia in patients with brucellosis, especially in regions where brucellosis is frequently encountered...|$|R

Inappropriate activation of macrophages by cytokines is the major mechanism of the disease. We report a case of an adult patient with HPS. After thorough clinical investigation, {{we have not been}} able to establish the underlying disease, and corticosteroids therapy was initiated empirically.

40|$|A case of Kartagener's {{syndrome}} in a 21 -year-old female was reported. Her {{complaints were}} persistent massive sputum and nasal obstruction. The plain and contrast radiographies and electrocardiogram revealed bronchiectasis and situs inversus. The diagnosis for chronic sinusitis {{was made on}} rhinoscopy and radiology. The patient underwent Denker's operation for chronic sinusitis and left middle lobectomy for bronchiectasis. Using 99 mTc-labelled resin particle method, the mucociliary transportation of the nasal septal mucosa was examined and {{found that there was}} no particle movement. Since the patient had persistent respiratory infection and showed extensive positive skin reactions for numerous antigens, immunoglobulins in serum, nasal secretion and parotid saliva were determined, and there were no evidence of suggesting <b>systemic</b> and local <b>immunodeficiency.</b> The IgA/IgG ratio of the nasal secretion was more than one. Sephadex G- 200 gel filtration pattern of the nasal secretion indicated that 11 S IgA was locally synthesized in this patient.
