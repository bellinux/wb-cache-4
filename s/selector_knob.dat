25|$|The {{vertical}} section controls the amplitude of the displayed signal. This section carries a Volts-per-Division (Volts/Div) <b>selector</b> <b>knob,</b> an AC/DC/Ground selector switch and the vertical (primary) input for the instrument. Additionally, this section is typically {{equipped with the}} vertical beam position knob.|$|E
2500|$|The NES Test Station's front {{features}} a Game Pak slot and connectors for testing various components (AC adapter, RF switch, Audio/Video cable, NES Control Deck, accessories and games), with a centrally-located <b>selector</b> <b>knob</b> {{to choose which}} component to test. The unit itself weighs approximately 11.7 pounds without a TV. It connects to a television via a combined A/V and RF Switch cable. By actuating the green button, a user can toggle between an A/V Cable or RF Switch connection. The television it is connected to (typically 11" [...] to 14") {{is meant to be}} placed atop it.|$|E
2500|$|These {{select the}} {{horizontal}} {{speed of the}} CRT's spot as it creates the trace; this process is {{commonly referred to as}} the sweep. In all but the least-costly modern oscilloscopes, the sweep speed is selectable and calibrated in units of time per major graticule division. Quite a wide range of sweep speeds is generally provided, from seconds to as fast as picoseconds (in the fastest) per division. Usually, a continuously-variable control (often a knob in front of the calibrated <b>selector</b> <b>knob)</b> offers uncalibrated speeds, typically slower than calibrated. This control provides a range somewhat greater than that of consecutive calibrated steps, making any speed available between the extremes.|$|E
50|$|On guitars {{that have}} them, these {{components}} and the wires that connect them allow the player to control {{some aspects of}} the sound like volume or tone using knobs, switches, or buttons. The most basic electronic control is a volume knob. Some guitars also have a tone-control knob, and some guitars with multiple pickups have pickup <b>selector</b> switches or <b>knobs</b> to determine which pickup(s) are activated. These at their simplest consist of passive components such as potentiometers and capacitors, but may also include specialized integrated circuits or other active components requiring batteries for power, for preamplification and signal processing, or even for electronic tuning. In many cases the electronics have some sort of shielding to prevent pickup of external interference and noise.|$|R

50|$|The Nikon F-301 {{is notable}} {{for being the}} first Nikon SLR sold that lacked a film advance lever. As a result the <b>selector</b> <b>knob,</b> also used to lock the shutter button, has a {{continuous}} option {{in addition to the}} single shot. It was also the first Nikon SLR to feature DX film decoding.|$|E
50|$|In {{the simple}} {{case of the}} taxi company, each radio had a {{manually}} operated channel <b>selector</b> <b>knob</b> to tune to different frequencies. As the drivers moved around, they would change from channel to channel. The drivers knew which frequency covered approximately what area. When they did not receive a signal from the transmitter, they would try other channels until they found one that worked. The taxi drivers would only speak one at a time, when invited by the base station operator. This is, in a sense, time division multiple access (TDMA).|$|E
50|$|The {{left side}} of the front panel has a volume knob and next to that are 8 knobs for {{controlling}} the sound parameters. There are 3 knobs for controlling the envelope settings and 3 for high and low cutoff and resonance filter settings. Also there are 2 assignable knobs.In the middle there is a numeric keypad to select a specific voice program number.On the right side there is a comprehensive edit matrix visible to control more synthesizer parameters. Turn the <b>selector</b> <b>knob</b> to select the row and adjust the corresponding parameter with the up/down buttons.|$|E
5000|$|A {{driving mode}} <b>selector</b> <b>knob</b> has been {{installed}} as standard equipment on all models, situated below the transmission gear lever {{and between the}} heated and ventilated front seat controls, providing four selections labeled [...] "Standard", [...] "Sport", [...] "Eco", and [...] "Snow", allowing the 7-speed transmission, engine and various systems to optimize driving based on varying conditions. To minimize exhaust noise intrusion into the passenger compartment from the engine at low rpms, [...] "Active Noise Control" [...] has been installed. Double-piston shock absorbers, developed by Kayaba Industry Company, have replaced the ones previously supplied by Hitachi.|$|E

5000|$|Additional {{features}} {{being the}} ability to be re-configured in the field with 16 channels available on the <b>selector</b> <b>knob</b> and fifteen other groups of sixteen available with a simple tool. The radio operates on spread spectrum and has a good level of security being designed with LPI (low probability of interception). An inbuilt receiver enables the radio to be keyed remotely via a short range encoded Press To Talk switch fob, the switch being mounted on a weapon or hand grip of a military vehicle. The switch code can be changed in the field and the radio configured to work with up to 4 different switches (useful for soldiers sharing transport such as motor cycles where the PTT switch can be handlebar mounted). The side mounted switch- pack is supplied with a single Transmit switch for general use and a double switch pack and auxiliary lead and connector to operate a second [...] "Bowman" [...] radio from the same users headset. Multiple security switches and block outs are fitted to prevent re transmission of secure Bowman signals over the personal network.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the basic fundamental of value engineering {{that can be}} implemented in any product to optimize its value. A case study of a Universal Testing Machine (UTM) is discussed in which the material, design of components is changed according to the value engineering methodology. In the present case study, {{it is observed that}} the unnecessary increase in cost is due to the use of expensive material, increase in variety of hardware items and thereby increasing the inventory and so on. Therefore we have selected some components from UTM i. e Hand Wheel, Range <b>Selector</b> <b>Knob,</b> Top Bearing Bracket Assembly, Dial Bracket, Recorder Gear etc. and we have applied value engineering technique for the cost reduction of these components of UTM...|$|E
40|$|A {{portable}} tester is provided for reading and displaying {{the pressure of}} a gas released from a rock core sample stored within a sealed container and for taking {{a sample of the}} released pressurized gas for chemical analysis thereof for subsequent use in a modified direct method test which determines the volume of gas and specific type of gas contained within the core sample. The {{portable tester}} includes a pair of low and high range electrical pressure transducers for detecting a gas pressure within a first pressure range of 0 [...] 25 psia or a second pressure range of 0 [...] 200 psig and for producing an electrical signal related to the detected pressure, a pair of low and high range display units electrically connected to the respective low and high range electrical pressure transducers for receiving the electrical signal produced therefrom and visually displaying the pressure of detected gas in a digital numeric readout, selector valve means in flow communication with the low and high range pressure transducers and having separate flow paths to each of the low and high range pressure transducers and a <b>selector</b> <b>knob</b> for selecting gas flow to one of the flow paths, and control valve means having an inlet port for flow communication to the sealed container, a first outlet port for flow communication to a sample gas canister, a second outlet port in flow communication with the selector valve means for reading the pressure of the flow of gas from the sealed container to either the low range or high range pressure transducers, a third outlet port for venting to the atmosphere gas contained within the sealed container, and a control knob for selecting the flow and non-flow of gas from the inlet port to one of the first, second or third outlet ports...|$|E
