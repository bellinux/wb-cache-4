5|$|Tropical Cyclone Trina (Fiji Meteorological Service designation: 01F, Joint Typhoon Warning Center designation: 06P) was a weak but {{destructive}} {{tropical cyclone}} in late 2001 which caused <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> flooding in the South Pacific island of Mangaia, Cook Islands, in nearly 50years.

Due to unfavorable conditions for tropical cyclogenesis, the storm struggled to develop significant convection, preventing it from intensifying beyond 65km/h (40mph). After finally succumbing to wind shear on December2, the system weakened to a tropical depression near Mangaia and dissipated several days later.|$|E
