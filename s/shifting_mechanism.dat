40|$|A {{learning}} {{neural network}} (30) implements a random weight change learning algorithm within a weight adjustment mechanism (28) for manipulating the weights applied to inputs {{of the network}} (30) {{in order to achieve}} a desired functionality for the network (30). Weights are changed randomly from an initial state with a small incremental weight change of either +? or -?. If the overall network output decreases by the weight change, the same weight change is iterated until the error increases. If, however, the overall network error increases, the weights are changed randomly again. After iterating the foregoing methodology, the network error gradually decreases and finally reaches approximately zero. Furthermore, a <b>shift</b> <b>mechanism</b> (36) and a multiplier (38) are employed as a weight application <b>mechanism</b> (16). The <b>shift</b> <b>mechanisms</b> (36) are connected in series with a random line (35) and are connected in parallel with a shift line (44). A random direction is successively channelled through the <b>shift</b> <b>mechanisms</b> (36) via the random line (35) {{under the control of the}} shift line (44) so that only a single random number need be generated for all of the <b>shift</b> <b>mechanisms</b> (36) within the neural network (30).

A <b>shifting</b> <b>mechanism</b> allows selection of the appropriate gear ratio for efficiency or comfort under the prevailing circumstances: for example, it may be comfortable to use a high gear when cycling downhill, a medium gear when cycling on a flat road, and a low gear when cycling uphill.

50|$|Unlike most view cameras, the <b>shift</b> <b>{{mechanism}}</b> allows <b>shifts</b> along {{only one}} axis, and the tilt mechanism allows tilts about only one axis; however, {{the rotation of}} the mechanisms allows the orientations of the axes to be changed, providing, in effect, combined tilt and swing, and combined rise/fall and lateral shift. The TS-E 17 mm 4L uses the same barrel design as the TS-E 24 mm f/3.5L II, which allows the tilt and the <b>shift</b> <b>mechanisms</b> to be rotated independently of each other.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presented}} {{an analysis of}} the gear shifting performances of a multipurpose vehicle transmission in driving condition by Ricardo's Gear Shift Quality Assessment (GSQA) system. The performances of the transmission included the travel and effort of the gear shift lever and synchronizing time. The mathematic models of the transmission including the gear <b>shift</b> <b>mechanism</b> and synchronizer were developed in MATLAB. The model of the gear <b>shift</b> <b>mechanism</b> was developed to analyze the travel map of the gear shift lever and the model of the synchronizer was developed to obtain the force-time curve of the synchronizer during the slipping time. The model of the synchronizer was used to investigate the relationship between the performances of the transmission and the variation of parameters during gear shifting. The mathematic models of the gear <b>shift</b> <b>mechanism</b> and the synchronizer provided a rapid design and verification method for the transmission with ring spring...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} problem {{where a group}} of agents need to choose from a finite set of social outcomes. We assume ev-ery agent’s {{valuation}} for every outcome is bounded and the bounds are public information. For our model, no mecha-nism simultaneously satisfies strategy-proofness, individual rationality, non-deficit, and efficiency. In light of this, we aim to design mechanisms that are strategy-proof, individ-ually rational, non-deficit, and minimize the worst-case effi-ciency loss. We propose a family of <b>mechanisms</b> called the <b>shifted</b> Groves <b>mechanisms,</b> which are generalizations of the Groves mechanisms. We first show that if there exist mechanisms that are strategy-proof, individually rational, and non-deficit, then there exist <b>shifted</b> Groves <b>mechanisms</b> with these prop-erties. Our main result is an Automated Mechanism De-sign (AMD) approach for identifying the (unique) optimal <b>shifted</b> Groves <b>mechanism,</b> which minimizes the worst-case efficiency loss among all <b>shifted</b> Groves <b>mechanisms.</b> Fi-nally, we prove that the optimal <b>shifted</b> Groves <b>mechanism</b> is globally optimal among all deterministic mechanisms that are strategy-proof, individually rational, and non-deficit...|$|R

50|$|The <b>shifting</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{was chosen}} with the {{additional}} input of Richard Ansdale. Space requirements, {{and the length of}} the gear cluster, meant that the selection mechanism would have to be mounted inside the gear cluster, rather than the usual motorcycle arrangement of dog clutches between the gears, an external drum to control their engagement and forks to connect the two. The mechanism needed to lock the selected gear onto the shaft, never engage more than one at a time, and all had to work at racing speeds.|$|E

It {{was an attempt to}} compete against rivals' automatic transmissions, though it still had a clutch, primarily to change range. In normal driving, the clutch is not used. The transmission itself was a fully synchronised manual type, with four forward gears, one reverse; where the shifting was done 'automatically' by either vacuum cylinders (early, M4), or hydraulic cylinders (late, M6, Presto-Matic). The main difference was the addition of a fluid coupling between engine and clutch, and the <b>shifting</b> <b>mechanism.</b>|$|E
50|$|In linguistics, {{shifting}} {{occurs when}} {{two or more}} constituents appearing {{on the same side}} of their common head exchange positions in a sense to obtain non-canonical order. The most widely acknowledged type of shifting is heavy NP shift, but shifting involving a heavy NP is just one manifestation of the <b>shifting</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Shifting occurs in most if not all European languages, and it may in fact be possible in all natural languages. Shifting is not inversion, and inversion is not shifting, but the two mechanisms are similar insofar as they are both present in languages like English that have relatively strict word order. The theoretical analysis of shifting varies in part depending on the theory of sentence structure that one adopts. If one assumes relatively flat structures, shifting does not result in a discontinuity. Shifting is often motivated by the relative weight of the constituents involved. The weight of a constituent is determined by a number of factors: number of words, contrastive focus, semantic content, etc.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to explore the}} hypothesis that shifts of body fluids from the legs and torso toward the head contribute to the motion sickness experienced by astronauts and cosmonauts. The shifts in body fluids observed during zero-G exposure were simulated by elevating guinea pigs' and monkeys' torsos and hindquarters. Cerebral-spinal fluid pressure was recorded from a transducer located in a brain ventricle; labyrinth fluid pressure was recorded from a pipette cemented in a hole in a semicircular canal. An anticipated divergence in cerebral-spinal fluid pressure and labyrinth fluid pressure during torso elevation was not observed.
