This green coconut-rice flour ingredients with palm sugar filling is filled into bamboo tube container. Subsequently, the filled bamboo tubes are steamed upon a <b>steam</b> <b>cooker</b> with small holes opening {{to blow the}} hot steam. The cooked tubular cakes then pushed out from the bamboo tube container, and served with grated coconut.|$|E

50|$|Equipment used in grain {{harvesting}} including combines, tractors, grain carts and threshers employ rotary unions. Once harvested, many crops will be processed with equipment that uses rotary unions. Food processing equipment that use rotary unions include cooling conveyors, flaking mills, shredders, <b>steam</b> <b>cookers,</b> starch dryers, rotary cutters and roll-forming.|$|R
50|$|Most <b>steam</b> <b>cookers</b> also {{feature a}} juice {{catchment}} which allows all nutrients (otherwise lost as steam) to be consumed. When other cooking techniques are used (e.g., frying with butter or oil), these nutrients are generally lost, as most are discarded after cooking Due {{to their health}} aspect (cooking without any oil), food steamers are used extensively in health oriented diets such as Cuisine minceur, some raw food diets, the Okinawa diet, a macrobiotic diet, or the CRON-diet.|$|R
50|$|In 1910, Indumadhab {{invented the}} <b>steam</b> <b>cooker</b> which became popular as ICMIC cooker. It {{was a special}} kind of cooking {{equipment}} where rice, pulses and vegetables could be cooked in steam, very fast. The compact arrangement and portability made it popular among bachelors and during trips where kitchen was not available. and According to Narayan Sen, the idea of ICMIC cooker may have come to Indumadhab from his observation of street food vendors in China.|$|E
5000|$|The same {{proprietor}} ran the Pitman Health Food Co. (also called Pitman Reform Food Stores) at Aston Brook Street, Birmingham, {{advertising in}} 1909 as [...] "The Largest Health Food Dealers in the World". Selling direct and by mail order, it manufactured meat-free products including Pitman Sea-Side Paste, Pitman Savoury Nut Meat, Nuto Cream, Brazose Meat, Vigar Extract, Vegsal Soups and Fruitarian Cakes and wafers. It also sold cooking utensils {{such as the}} Pitman <b>Steam</b> <b>Cooker,</b> a multilevel boiler and steamer.|$|E
5000|$|Through Hick's {{influence}} barracks kitchens were upgraded with a {{new type}} of cooker the static Wiles <b>steam</b> <b>cooker</b> being introduced into the service. After a lot of submissions he and the Wiles family were finally able to persuade the Australian Army to use the Australian designed and built Wiles Mobile Steam Kitchen too. [...] Training was improved and instead of soldiers traveling to Cookery schools mobile training was commenced with cookery instructors going to the units. Ration scales were improved through the introduction of additional commodities selected for their nutritional value.|$|E
40|$|A {{method and}} {{apparatus}} are disclosed for liquefaction of starch derived from cereal grain. A single-screw extruder is utilized to gelatinize a starch substrate providing significant advantage over prior art jet <b>steam</b> <b>cookers.</b> Liquefaction of the gelatinized starch substrate is completed by postextrusion bioreaction of the starch with a static-mixer reactor. An alpha-amylase enzyme is utilized {{to facilitate the}} liquefaction process. The Liquefacted starch substrate is heated after bioreaction to achieve complete digestion of remaining starch inclusions. Liquefacted starch substrates utilizing the disclosed process significantly {{reduce the amount of}} energy required in the conversion of starch to fermentable sugars in the production of ethanol...|$|R
50|$|At first, factory ships, {{simply more}} modern {{versions}} of earlier American whaleships, could only anchor in a bay to process whales. They used {{virtually the same}} techniques as open-boat whalemen, bringing the carcass alongside the ship, cutting the blubber into long strips, which were cut into smaller pieces to be boiled in large <b>steam</b> <b>cookers.</b> In the southern summer of 1912-13 the first successful attempt was made by a Norwegian factory ship at catching and flensing whales in the pack ice off South Orkney. A further breakthrough occurred in the 1923-24 season when the Norwegian factory ship Sir James Clark Ross spent an entire season in the Ross Sea flensing whales alongside the ship while anchored in Discovery Inlet off the Ross Ice Shelf. With {{the introduction of the}} stern slipway in the Lancing in 1925 flensing could be performed entirely on the open sea.|$|R
50|$|It {{was during}} this era that Australians became more food conscious, no doubt {{influenced}} by the influx of migrants and tourists. TV was now in Australian homes, Graham Kerr the super chef was the in show and suddenly the cook had an elevation in status. Soldiers enlisting now wanted to be cooks, they were better educated and most importantly they were motivated. In the early 1960s the AACC were issued with the new US patent M37 Range Fuel Cooking Outfits and the Range Outfit Field Gasoline and the Immersion Heaters. Compared with the Hydra-burners, the Wiles <b>Steam</b> <b>Cookers,</b> Soya stoves and the Flower stoves this equipment was {{the state of the}} art. Interesting to note though that this was the very same equipment that cooks borrowed or stole from the Americans in Korea back in the early 1950s. At about this time the famous Wiles Steam Kitchens were retired from Service.|$|R

In the recipe for kesa or kesuvina palya, which is native to Malenadu, the kesuvina (Colocasia) leaves are finely chopped and washed with water. Then the chopped Colocasia leaves are cooked in a pressure cooker by adding just a little water, not more than 5% of the quantity of Colocasia leaves. The leaves are cooked for almost 10 minutes or until the <b>steam</b> <b>cooker</b> attains 4-5 pressure whistles. The cooked leaves are then boiled in low flame. Meanwhile, spicy chillies, preferably jeerige menasinakayi (native to the Malenadu) and garlic are ground into a paste and added to the cooked Colocasia leaves and stirred. To this mixture, lemon extract is added, preferably 2-3 lemon extracts and cooked for 3-4 minutes. It is recommended to eat this with Akki rotti or rice with ghee.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{compared}} two heating methods currently used for antigen retrieval (AR) immunostaining: the microwave oven and the <b>steam</b> <b>cooker.</b> Myosin-V, a molecular motor involved in vesicle transport, {{was used as}} a neuronal marker in honeybee Apis mellifera brains fixed in formalin. Overall, the <b>steam</b> <b>cooker</b> showed the most satisfactory AR results. At 100 degrees C, tissue morphology was maintained and revealed epitope recovery, while evaporation of the AR solution was markedly reduced; this is important for stabilizing the sodium citrate molarity of the AR buffer and reducing background effects. Standardization of heat-mediated AR of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue sections results in more reliable immunostaining of the honeybee brain. FAPEMIGCNPqCAPE...|$|E

5000|$|Some of the {{earliest}} examples of steam cooking {{have been found in}} Cochise County, Arizona, where steam pits were used for cooking about 10,000 years ago. [...] In China's Yellow River Valley, early <b>steam</b> <b>cookers</b> made of stoneware have been found dating back as far as 5000 BCE. From the eighth century CE, thin cypress strips were used to make steamers; today they are constructed from bamboo with slatted bases. The classic steamer has a chimney in the center, which distributes the steam among the tiers.In Western cooking, steaming is most often used to cook vegetablesit is rarely used to cook meats. However, steamed clams are prepared by steaming. With Chinese cuisine, vegetables are usually stir fried or blanched and seldom steamed. Seafood and meat dishes are steamed. For example: steamed whole fish, steamed crab, steamed pork spare ribs, steamed ground pork or beef, steamed chicken and steamed goose. Rice can be steamed too, although in Chinese cooking this is simply referred to as [...] "cooking" [...] rather than [...] "steaming". In Thailand steaming is the definition of minimalist cooking. Steaming fish in Thai-style gently cooks the fish until just tender. Wheat foods are steamed as well. Examples include buns and Chinese steamed cakes.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, steamed minced pork {{is cooked}} by {{steaming}}. It {{is put on}} top of the steaming stand over a pot of boiling water. However, in Guangdong area, it is also <b>steamed</b> in rice <b>cookers</b> during rice cooking process. The cooking time usually last for 10 to 30 minutes until it is fully cooked.|$|R
5000|$|Restaurants (and {{fast food}} places) {{account for about}} 3 percent of total CII use in Austin, Texas and 5 percent in Oakland, California (EBMUD) and up to 8 percent in the State of Florida. The largest uses of water in {{restaurants}} result from kitchen activities such as washing dishes, making ice, and preparing food. A significant amount of water is also used for restrooms.The proxy metrics data show WUIs in restaurants ranging from 474 to 578 g/ksf/d in selected Colorado utilities, an average of 589 g/ksf/d in Austin, Texas, and 670 g/ksf/d in Florida. Somewhat wider range of 356 to 907 g/ksf/d was reported in an earlier study. Data on functional metrics suggests that restaurants would use around 6 to 9 gallons of water per meal served, 20 to 31 gallons per seat per day, and 86 to 122 gallons per employee per day. [...] Other studies reported 17 gallons/seat/day in Santa Fe, New Mexico [...] and 29 gallons/seat per day in Colorado utilities. [...] Given the total floor space of 380 thousand food service buildings of 1,819 million square feet and assuming average use of 521 g/ksf/d, the total U.S.-wide use in restaurants would be 950 mgd or close to 8 percent of CII use. Restaurants can save significant amounts of water by maximizing the efficiency of pre-rinse spray valves, food disposal systems and upgrading dishwashers, ice machines, and <b>steam</b> <b>cookers</b> to Energy StarÂ® qualified models that use less water.|$|R
40|$|In the {{pressure}} cooker, high temperature is obtained by using steam under pressure. Since {{the pressure}} gauge {{is used as}} the indicator of temperature {{it is essential that}} the gauge register the correct pressure. Hence, this paper deals mainly with a study of the accuracy of both new and old pressure gauges used on <b>steam</b> pressure <b>cookers.</b> At the same time, four other phases were investigated: (1) the proper functioning of safety valves, (2) the various methods of sealing the lid to the cooker, (3) the proper evacuation of air from the cooker, and (4) the use of a thermometer as a temperature indicator...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSteam jet cooking {{has been}} used for years to prepare aqueous starch dispersions for food application. The steam jet cooking generates high shear stress to starch. The {{objective}} of this research is to study the effect of shear stress on structure of corn starch granules by steam jet cooking. A laboratory scale <b>steam</b> jet <b>cooker</b> has been established with flow rate about 1 L/min. Three kinds of corn starch, waxy, regular, and high amylose were used. Starch slurries (5 % w/w) were cooked by <b>steam</b> jet <b>cooker</b> at temperature 100 Â°C (SJ 100), 120 Â°C (SJ 120) and 135 Â°C (SJ 135) compared with hot water boiling at 90 Â°C 30 min (HB). The insoluble particles of cooked starches were investigated by particle size analyzer, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and damage starch assay kit. There was a significant decrease in percent yield of insoluble particles of cooked dispersions for all starches in the order HB > SJ 100 > SJ 120 > SJ 135. The data also showed that SJ 100 has higher destruction than HB, although the temperature of heat treatment was similar. The particle size of cooked starches was much larger than uncooked starches, and the particle size of HB was larger than SJ 100 for all starches. This {{may be due to the}} time of cooking, 30 min for HB vs. a few sec for SJ 100. Percentage damaged starch of cooked dispersions for all starches became higher with increasing of cooking temperature. Although, the time of heat treatment was much shorter for SJ 100 than HB, the damaged starch was higher as well. Those date all revealed the effect of shear stress from steam cooking. On SEM observation, the damaged granules showed sponge like structure for the starch dispersions cooked by HB. The starches heated by steam jet cooking were fractured into small fragments...|$|R
40|$|Conventional (un{{shredded}}) {{and shredded}} alfalfa hays were heated {{in either a}} forced-air oven or a <b>steam</b> pressure <b>cooker</b> at different times and temperatures {{to determine the effect}} of heat treatment on chemical composition and ruminal protein degradability. Rates of protein degradation and extents of protein escape were estimated using a ruminal inhibitor in vitro system. Both rates and extents were corrected for the proportion of total N in ADIN. Estimated net protein escape (total escape minus ADIN-bound CP) of unshredded and shredded hays was increased by oven or steam heating. Optimal oven treatments, as indicated by the greatest increase in net protein escape, were 120 min at 150 Â°C and 60 min at 160 'C. Net protein escapes of shredded hay were greater than unshredded hay when neither was heated and when hays were heated to the same extent. Equivalent protein protection was obtained by oven heating for 120 min at 140 'C, 60 rnin at 150 "C, and 30 rnin at lWC, which gave net protein escapes of 55, 54, and 54 % for shredded hay and 44, 45, and 43 % for unshredded hay, respectively.

40|$|The thermal {{properties}} of soft and hard wheat grains, cooked in a <b>steam</b> pressure <b>cooker,</b> {{as a function}} of cooking temperature and time were investigated by modulated temperature differential scanning calorimetry (MTDSC). Four cooking temperatures (110, 120, 130 and 140 Â°C) and six cooking times (20, 40, 60, 80, 100 and 120 min) for each temperature were studied. It was found that typical non-reversible heat flow thermograms of cooked and uncooked wheat grains consisted of two endothermic baseline shifts localised around 40 â 50 Â°C and then 60 â 70 Â°C. The second peaks of non-reversible heat flow thermograms (60 â 70 Â°C) were associated with starch gelatinisation. The degree of gelatinisation was quantified based on these peaks. In this study, starch was completely gelatinised within 60 â 80 min for cooking temperatures at 110 â 120 Â°C and within 20 min for cooking temperatures at 130 â 140 Â°C. MTDSC detected reversible endothermic baseline shifts in most samples, localised broadly around 48 â 67 Â°C with changes in heat capacity ranging from 0. 02 to 0. 06 J/g per Â°C. These reversible endothermic baseline shifts are related to the glass transition, which occurs during starch gelatinisation. Data on the specific heat capacity of the cooked wheat samples are provided...|$|R
40|$|A {{field study}} was {{conducted}} through interviews on offshore islands in Taiwan to investigate the energy usage of local residents. A comparison of household appliance usage in mainland Taiwan with that on the offshore islands revealed that, overall, {{the most commonly used}} household appliances are <b>steam</b> cookers/rice <b>cookers,</b> water dispensers, and washing machines. For other household appliances, Levels 2 and 3 offshore isles have lower use penetration rates compared with those in mainland Taiwan and on Level 1 offshore isles, particularly for the use of computers. By contrast, the use penetration rate for chest freezers on Levels 2 and 3 offshore isles is high, and each household has one or more freezers on average. This appliance is not a commonly observed household product in mainland Taiwan or on Level 1 offshore isles. Furthermore, because of the government policy, every household on parts of Level 2 offshore isles and on all Level 3 offshore isles has a fixed monthly charge of electricity. The transportation of liquefied petroleum gas is also inconvenient, and the gas price is slightly higher, leading to the tendency of residents to consume excessive amounts of electrical energy, which does not correspond with the aim of the government to conserve energy and reduce carbon emissions; thus, the relevant authoritiesâ review and improvement on energy consumption on Levels 2 and 3 offshore isles are required...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTo {{analyze the}} effect of {{different}} lowland rice varieties and different cooking methods on physical and chemical characteristics of cooked rice. A factorial randomized block design with two factors was used and each combination of the factors was repeated three times. The first factor was rice variety (Ciherang and Ciliwung) and the second factor was the cooking method (stovetop, boiling and <b>steaming,</b> and rice <b>cooker).</b> Results showed that Ciherang and Ciliwung varieties were classified into slender grain rice type with yellow-red color. The amylose content of Ciherang was classified as moderate, while the amylose content of Ciliwung classified as low. The most abundant amino acid contained in Ciherang and Ciliwung varieties was glutamic acid. Statistical analysis showed that cooking method had significant effects on texture, lightness, chroma, hue and moisture content of cooked rice. Rice cooked with liwet method had the lowest texture value, lowest lightness value, highest chroma value, and highest moisture content...|$|R
40|$|The investigational {{work was}} divided into two parts. In the first part, {{information}} was obtained as {{to the nature of}} the reactions of the individual constituents of high pentosanocellulosic materials with phenol or the cresols in the presence of a catalyst;Cellulose was found to act in two ways; it would either dissolve in phenol and zinc chloride, the zinc chloride acting as a solvent instead of catalyst, or it would undergo decomposition and condense with phenol to form a black, resinous material. Sulfuric acid served also as catalyst in the condensation, while sodium hydroxide did not. The presence of the condensation products of cellulose and cresol was found to exert a retarding action on the condensation and polymerization of a cresol-furfural mixture;The pentosans were found to be soluble in phenol and cresol without reaction or, at an elevated temperature and in the presence of sulfuric acid, they would condense similarly to cellulose to give a resinous material;Xylose would also condense with phenol like the pentosans, but at a somewhat lower temperature;Lignins were not directly soluble in phenol but would dissolve with condensation to give a tarry liquid which remained fluid after considerable heating;In the second part of the experimental work, a <b>steam</b> pressure <b>cooker</b> and an electrically-heated reaction vessel were adapted for carrying out the reaction between corncobs or oathulls and cresol;A standard process was developed for carrying out the reaction, and for preparing a molding compound from the plastic material. This process consisted of the following: (1) Five parts by weight of H 2 SO 4 were dissolved in an equal weight of water and then combined with 100 parts of cresol. (2) The solution was heated to boiling in an autoclave and 30 parts of ground corncobs introduced gradually. (3) The autoclave was closed and the temperature kept at 140 deg. C for 3 hours. (4) The pressure was then released and a vacuum distillation carried out to remove excess cresol and other volatile materials. (5) When the distillation temperature had reached 250 [...] 300 deg. C, the residual liquid was run into flat pans and cooled until solid. (6) The solid resin was ground to pass a sixty mesh sieve and then incorporated with 55 percent wood flour filler to produce the molding compound;The properties of the molding compound were improved by a study of the effect of the molding temperature; by experiments with the use of plasticizers; by an investigation of various fillers, and through experiments on the effect of paraformaldehyde and hexamine as hardening agents...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to detect the {{bacterial}} load and types of bacteria in rendered slaughter by-products used as poultry feed. Two by-products processors using two types of raw materials (poultry and ruminants slaughter by-products) and different levels of sanitation were included in this study. Both processors employed the dry-rendering system for treatment using horizontal <b>steam</b> jacketed apparatuses (<b>cookers).</b> Fifty four samples were taken {{at different stages of}} processing, before cooking (Ground), after cooking (Cooked) and after milling and packing (Packed meals) and used to : 1 -Determine the load and type of bacteria in unprocessed slaughter by-prod ucts. 2 -Determine the load and type of bacteria in slaughter by-products at various stages of processing. 3 -Determine the efficiency of treatment procedures in reducing the bacterial load and recommend the best methods to guarantee the microbiological safety of processed slaughter by-products. An average aerobic plate count of 11 x 107 CFU/gm. was obtained for ground poultry by-products whereas the average coliform count was 1. 9 x 106 CFU/ gm. After treatment at 116 C for 3 hrs the aerobic plate count and coliform count declined to Zero in cooked samples, but recontamination occurred after milling and packing to increase the count to 7. 4 x 106 CFU/ gm [...] xviii An average aerobic plate count of 5. 0 x 107 CFU/gm. was obtained for ground ruminants by-products before treatment and an average coliform count of 3. 4 x 106 CFU/gm.. After treatment at 230 C for 4 hrs the count was reduced to 1. 4 x 103 CFU/gm. and coliform count declined to Zero, but after packing the average count increased to 5. 5 x 105 CFU/gm and the coliform count was 1. 6 x 106 CFU/gm. This increase in bacterial viable count in packed meal is unacceptable in poultry additives. A total of 196 bacterial isolates were obtained and which were characteri-zed according to their morphology, Gram stain reaction, and biochemical reaction. Isolates included Escherichia coli, Sallmonella spp., Klebsiella spp, Proteus spp., Yersinina spp., Listeria spp., Pseudomonas spp., Staphyloco- ccus spp.,Streptococcus spp.,Bacillus spp., Corynebacterium spp. and aerotolerant Clostridium. The high contamination rate and presence of potential pathogens in unprocessed samples constituted high risks for humans and the environment. The efficiency of the cookers was measured by examining the cooked sam-ples. The detection of aero-tolerant Clostridium tertium and Bacillus mace-rans in cooked ruminants by-products indicated the inefficiency of the procedure employed. Collection of by-products from clean sources and increasing the holding time or repeat cooking will improve the bacterial quality of ruminants slaughter by-products meals. Packed ruminants meal showed contamination by organisms usually found in raw materials such as E. coli, Klebsiella spp., Streptococcus spp. Cory-nebacterium spp. and Bacillus spp., and xix this suggests possible recontamin-tion from raw material during air drying either by direct contact or indirectly by insects and rodents. Poultry feed additives are usually stored for a considerable time in the factory or poultry farms and this permits the multiplication of contaminating bacteria. Therefore re-sterilization of these additives is recommended before they are mixed in poultry feed...|$|R
