He then moved to the United States and graduated with a bachelor's degree in Business Management from Purdue University. After graduation, {{he worked in the}} U.S. and later did an I.T. related business in Dubai. He decided later to pursue a career in acting and attended a three-month course at the Barry John Acting Studio in Mumbai. He stated in a 2012 interview that he chose acting because [...] " ... <b>somewhere</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> lane my life became monotonous and routine".|$|E
500|$|The main {{criticism}} of the game among reviewers is {{the length of the}} game. Eurogamer says that [...] "It's too short", while RPGamer state that [...] "The typical player can fly through the game's six relatively short dungeons in about ten hours". There are also various other complaints from reviewers: IGN claims that the kinstone system is overly repetitive; Nintendo World Report criticises the game's visuals on a Game Boy Player, and RPGamer details the game's low difficulty level as a disadvantage. Despite this, IGN's Craig Harris liked the way that the ability to become tiny had been incorporated to create fresh puzzles in the Zelda series. He continued to comment that [...] "It's an idea that's so well-conceived that I'd love to see worked in the series' 3D designs <b>somewhere</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> line".|$|E
500|$|On {{a special}} episode of Raw dubbed Thursday Raw Thursday, Michaels vacated the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. He {{explained}} to fans {{that he was}} informed by doctors that he had conjured a knee injury {{and that he had}} to retire. His speech was regarded as controversial, as Michaels was allegedly unwilling to lose to Bret Hart at WrestleMania 13 (since it was noted {{that he was going to}} have a rematch with Hart at WrestleMania). Michaels contemplated thoughts of retirement and stated that he [...] "had to find his smile again", which he had [...] "lost" [...] <b>somewhere</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> line. After knee surgery by Dr. James Andrews, Michaels returned a few months later, briefly teaming with Stone Cold Steve Austin to win the WWF Tag Team Championship. In his autobiography, Michaels reveals about his real-life feud with Bret Hart, claiming that Hart did interviews on live television claiming that he [...] was faking his whole injury.|$|E

60|$|There {{was a short}} silence. The woman {{found it}} hard to know what to say. <b>Somewhere</b> <b>down</b> along <b>the</b> white, dusty road a man was {{grinding}} the music of a threadbare waltz from an ancient barrel-organ. The girl closed her eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I'll wager {{it was the}} {{suitcase}} and he left it <b>somewhere</b> <b>down</b> on <b>the</b> farm!" [...] cried Randy. [...] "Let us go and take a look. We are permitted {{to go out in}} the farm fields, aren't we?" [...] he asked of Walt.|$|R
2500|$|... "I took {{a pass at}} Get Smart 2, wrote a {{completely}} new story and we'll see what happens with that <b>somewhere</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> line perhaps... Anne Hathaway is definitely in and Alan Arkin, so at some point... we don't have any projected date and the script still needs some tweaking and some rewriting." ...|$|E
2500|$|During 2010, McTell {{recorded}} {{an album}} of new songs, his first for ten years, and released in October as <b>Somewhere</b> <b>Down</b> <b>the</b> Road. [...] He kept an on-line diary of the album’s progress which described assembling the material, the recording sessions and preparing for release. McTell’s UK autumn tour was branded with the same title.|$|E
2500|$|During {{press for}} Clerks II, Smith briefly {{discussed}} {{the possibility of}} a Clerks III. Stating that [...] "if there's ever gonna be a Clerks III, it would be <b>somewhere</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> road in my 40s or 50s, when it might be interesting to check back in on Dante and Randal. But I don't know about Jay and Bob so much, 'cause at 45, leaning on a wall in front of a convenience store might be a little sad." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By the bye, I'm sure I {{once heard}} a voice, <b>somewhere</b> <b>down</b> by <b>the</b> sea, {{that would be}} perfect," [...] exclaimed Lance. [...] "Sweet and powerful, fresh and young, just what is essential. I heard it when I was in quest of crabs with my boy." ...|$|R
60|$|The great {{silence of}} the forest flowed in over us, as it were; {{for quite a while}} no one did or said anything. Then from <b>somewhere</b> <b>down</b> amidst <b>the</b> mosses I heard a thin voice, the sound of which {{reminded}} me of air being squeezed out of an indiarubber cushion.|$|R
6000|$|... "And why do {{you think}} that he has any feeling at all? I have heard Spike say he left <b>the</b> fellow ashore, <b>somewhere</b> <b>down</b> on <b>the</b> Spanish Main, or in the Islands, quite twenty years since; but a sailor would scarce carry a grudge so long a time, for such a thing as that." ...|$|R
2500|$|In November 2014, {{during an}} {{interview}} on radio 95.5 KLOS, Cantrell {{was asked if he}} had any plans on doing more solo work, to which he replied: [...] "I don't know. Maybe <b>somewhere</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> road. The only reason I ever did anything by my own was because my band wasn't really doing anything. My band has been doing things lately, so I don't really have time to do anything. I kinda focus my energy there [...] Of course, you know, possibilities..." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2010, Grant {{released}} <b>Somewhere</b> <b>Down</b> <b>the</b> Road, {{featuring the}} hit single [...] "Better Than a Hallelujah", which peaked at No. 8 on Billboard Top Christian Songs chart. When {{asked about the}} new album during an interview with CBN.com, Grant says, [...] "... my hope is just for those songs to provide companionship, remind myself and whoever else is listening what's important. I feel like songs {{have the ability to}} connect us to ourselves and to each other, and to our faith, to the love of Jesus, in a way that conversation doesn't do. Songs kind of slip in and move you before you realize it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{of these}} surviving versions in Middle English is Ipomadon and {{occurs in the}} manuscript Chetham 8009 (Manchester), which contains a unique copy of an 8,891-line tail-rhyme romance, dating in composition to [...] "anywhere between {{the last decade of}} the fourteenth century and the middle of the fifteenth century" [...] This version of the tale follows Hue de Rotelande's story quite closely, although abridging it somewhat by cutting battle details and most of Hue's rather coarse or prosaic narrative intrusions. Composed in a dialect that suggests that it was originally written by a West Yorkshireman in his native West Yorkshire, in the north of England, the manuscript copy itself dates to the late-fifteenth century, is from a London Scriptorium and contains clues that the work from which this copy was taken had itself been re-copied, <b>somewhere</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> line, in the southwest of England.|$|E
6000|$|... "Blood {{is thicker}} than water; isn't it? I often say that. I heard {{of one of}} your girls only yesterday. She is staying <b>somewhere</b> <b>down</b> in <b>the</b> country, {{not far from where}} my sister lives--Mrs. Eames, the widow of poor John Eames, who never did any good in this world. I daresay you've heard of her?" ...|$|R
60|$|Bland {{ordered it}} and they sat down to a neatly-served meal. The evening was warm and very still and clear. A rattle of wheels reached them from <b>somewhere</b> far <b>down</b> <b>the</b> road and {{they could hear the}} faint splash of water {{in the depths of the}} ravine.|$|R
50|$|The {{divide between}} Kendra and Betty mimics the very world that devours them: {{a vast and}} {{polarizing}} abyss. On a quiet summer evening, <b>somewhere</b> <b>down</b> in <b>the</b> Alabama Delta, Kendra and Betty troll the flats looking for red fish. After Betty begins diagnosing Kendra’s dead-end life with career picks from What Color is Your Parachute, their routine fishing excursion takes a violent turn.|$|R
2500|$|When {{asked about}} the {{inspiration}} for album's single [...] "Somewhere Down the Crazy River", Lanois commented, [...] "Robbie Robertson was describing {{what it was like}} to hang out in Arkansas with Levon Helm in his old neighbourhood. He was telling me about the hot nights and fishing with dynamite, and was asking someone for directions for someplace <b>somewhere</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> crazy river. ... I had presented him with this instrument that [...] Eno introduced me to called the Suzuki Omnichord, like an electric autoharp. He found a little chord sequence with it that was sweet and wonderful. As he was developing his chord sequence I recorded him and superimposed his storytelling, which I was secretly recording, on top. That was the birth of [...] 'Somewhere Down The Crazy River.' It's kind of like a guy with a deep voice telling you about steaming nights in Arkansas." [...] This song is notable as Robertson's only solo hit in the UK, reaching number 15 on the UK singles chart. His follow-up single there, [...] "Fallen Angel" [...] (also from the album), reached number 95.|$|E
2500|$|The main feud {{heading into}} In Your House 13 was between Bret Hart, Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Undertaker, and Vader over the finish of the Royal Rumble. As per stipulation, {{the winner of}} the Rumble match would face the WWF Champion for his title at WrestleMania 13. At the Royal Rumble event, Shawn Michaels won the title from Sycho Sid in the main event {{following}} the Rumble match and avenged the loss he suffered at the hands of Sid at Survivor Series the previous November. According to Bret Hart, Michaels was scheduled to drop the title to him at WrestleMania in return for Hart having dropped the title to Michaels at the same event one year earlier. Michaels later suffered a legitimate knee injury during a three-way match with Sid and Bret Hart two weeks after the Royal Rumble, and on the February 13, 1997 edition of Raw, known as Thursday Raw Thursday, Michaels vacated the title by speaking to the fans, telling them that he was told by doctors that he suffered a very bad knee injury and that he should at least consider retirement. He stated that he [...] "had to find his smile again", which he had [...] "lost" [...] <b>somewhere</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> line. Michaels spent time rehabbing his knee at the same time Steve Austin was rehabbing his knee injury at HealthSouth in San Antonio. This did not sit well with Hart, who had legitimate backstage problems with Michaels at this time and who also thought Michaels' injury was not as severe as he was claiming it to be.|$|E

60|$|Mowgli {{sat with}} his elbows on his knees, looking out across the valley at <b>the</b> daylight. <b>Somewhere</b> <b>down</b> in <b>the</b> woods below a bird was trying over in a husky, reedy voice the first few notes of his spring song. It {{was no more than}} a shadow of the liquid, {{tumbling}} call he would be pouring later, but Bagheera heard it.|$|R
60|$|<b>Down</b> from <b>the</b> top of {{the ridge}} back of the pond of Paddy the Beaver plunged Lightfoot the Deer, his eyes blazing with rage. He had {{understood}} the screaming of Sammy Jay. He knew that <b>somewhere</b> <b>down</b> there was <b>the</b> big stranger he had been looking for.|$|R
60|$|He thrilled {{from head}} to foot. This time {{there could be no}} mistake. It was the voice he knew so well, his wife's voice, and it had come from <b>somewhere</b> <b>down</b> near <b>the</b> garden-gate. It is {{difficult}} to judge distance where sounds are concerned, but Mortimer estimated that the voice had spoken about a short mashie-niblick and an easy putt from where he stood.|$|R
60|$|The noise grew, {{filling the}} still air. From <b>somewhere</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> road sounded {{the ring of}} running feet.|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah, but the white-faces are there--the English, {{and they}} bring dogs from <b>somewhere</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> river in boats--big fat dogs--to keep those same jackals lean," [...] said the Adjutant.|$|E
60|$|My desk is cooling {{itself in}} a mail-coach, <b>somewhere</b> <b>down</b> at <b>the</b> back of the cathedral, and the pens and ink in this house are so detestable, that I have no hope of your ever getting to this portion of my letter.

6000|$|... "Halloo, Kantwise!" [...] said Mr. Moulder, not {{rising from}} his chair, or giving any very decided tokens of welcome. [...] "I {{thought you were}} <b>down</b> <b>somewhere</b> among <b>the</b> iron foundries?" ...|$|R

60|$|By {{this time}} I {{had succeeded in}} raising myself on my elbow, and, by {{the dim light of}} a hanging lamp <b>somewhere</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> passage, I was pretty well able to take stock of my surroundings.|$|E
60|$|And as Graham listened, Paula's singing {{came through}} the open window from <b>somewhere</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> long arcades, and there was that ever-haunting thrill in her voice that he could not escape remembering afterward. She burst into laughter, and Mrs. Tully beamed to him and nodded at the sound.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you mean}} that I am finding it a relief to talk nonsense, you are right," [...] Philippa assented. [...] "As a matter of fact, I am feeling most depressed.

They must have landed <b>somewhere</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> coast." ...|$|E
60|$|Cape after cape {{jutted out}} over the abyss. Some were very sharp and bare, others covered with cedar; some tottering crags with a {{crumbling}} bridge leading to their rims; and some ran down like giant steps. From one of these I watched below. The slope here under the wall was like {{the side of a}} rugged mountain. <b>Somewhere</b> <b>down</b> among <b>the</b> dark patches of cedar and the great blocks of stone the hounds were hunting the lion, but I could not see one of them.|$|R

"I {{think the}} bottom line for China (and India) is growth, and given that this growth is mainly based on coal, there {{is going to have to}} be much more {{pressure}} on China if global emissions are to peak within any reasonable time frame. In Beijing the interests of the Party come first, second and third, and global warming is <b>somewhere</b> further <b>down</b> <b>the</b> list. Growth delivers stability and prosperity, and keeps the party in power." ...|$|R
