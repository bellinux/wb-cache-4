[...] Although single-panel cartoons were an established part of the magazine, a comic strip was unprecedented {{and had to be}} justified. Kurtzman submitted some Goodman Beaver strips and was surprised to receive a favorable response from Hefner, who liked the [...] "fresh and eager" [...] character. He especially enjoyed [...] "Goodman Goes Playboy", which featured a boisterous romp in Hefner's mansion. Hefner nevertheless insisted that the material was not right for his magazine, but requested an explanation of the character with a suggestion: [...] "Maybe there is a way of launching a similar series... that can somehow be related to Playboy". Kurtzman replied that Goodman Beaver [...] "could be foolish {{and at the same time}} wise," [...] and that he [...] "innocently partakes of the bad while espousing the good." [...] He further stated that Beaver's innocent, restive, and charming nature allotted him especial creative freedom. A week later, Kurtzman wrote to Hefner, [...] "What would you think of a girl character... whom I could apply to my kind of situations?" [...] Six weeks later Hefner replied, [...] "I think your notion of doing a Goodman Beaver strip of two, three, or four pages, but using a <b>sexy</b> <b>girl...</b> is a bull's eye. We can run it every issue." ...|$|E
