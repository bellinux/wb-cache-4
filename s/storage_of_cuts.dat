40|$|Bark beetle infestations {{are often}} {{scattered}} throughout the forest landscape and therefore difficult to accurately and rapidly assess. We tested a roadside sampling technique in a pure maritime pine forest (Pinus pinaster) of ca. 1300 ha where bark beetle outbreak foci were observed following a windstorm. The sampling method relied on the count along stand edges of all dying or dead trees sighted within a fixed distance from the road. About 2300 trees attacked by Ips sexdentatus were recorded and located using colour-infrared aerial photography. Accuracy of the infestation map was verified by ground sampling. Piles <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> logs stored along the edge significantly increased the percentage of attacked trees in the neighbouring stand. However, the percentage of attacked trees within the stand edges did not differ with the percentagewithin the stand interior. It allowed us to use stand edges as sampling units to estimate the mean percentage of attacked trees per stand. At the stand scale, {{the use of a}} fixed 10 m wide strip along stand edges maximized the detection of attacked trees and minimized the bias of estimated percent of attacked trees. Based on GIS data, various stratified roadside sampling plans with increasing numbers of edges per stand and increasing numbers of stands per forest were simulated by bootstrap resampling.

40|$|AIMS: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} tissue preparation on immunostaining and to establish {{whether there is a}} standard tissue preparation schedule that allows optimal demonstration of all antigens. METHODS: Blocks of tonsil were subjected to variations to a standard fixation, processing, and section preparation schedule. The sections were stained with five antibodies-L 26 (CD 20), UCHL 1 (CD 45 RO), CD 3, vimentin, and anti-kappa light chain [...] using the streptavidinbiotin immunostaining technique. When further investigation was necessary, other tissues and antibodies were used and where weak immunostaining was obtained the use of microwave pretreatment to improve staining was tested. RESULTS: Several factors involved in fixation were found to affect immunoreactivity. These included the duration, pH, and type of fixative used. In tissue processing only temperature and the duration of the dehydration and wax infiltration steps affected immunoreactivity. Of all the factors investigated, the temperature and duration of the section drying had the greatest effect. In contrast, long term <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> sections before immunostaining had no effect on the reactivity of the antibodies tested. Antibodies were found to be affected by alterations to tissue preparation by varying degrees, UCHL 1 and vimentin being the most susceptible to changes in fixation and L 26 to changes in processing. Where weak staining occurred, microwave pretreatment was generally found to eliminate the problem. CONCLUSIONS: There is no standard tissue preparation schedule for the optimal demonstration of all antigens. Factors involved in all aspects of tissue preparation can affect immunoreactivity, so it is important that precise details of the preparation schedule are given when reporting immunocytochemical studies, rather than using the general term "routinely fixed and processed"...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{microbial}} populations causing the spoilage of chilled beef during storage and to evaluate the effect of the use of an antimicrobial packaging for the meat storage. A nisin activated antimicrobial packaging was developed by using a nisin, HCL and EDTA solution and used for the <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> beef <b>cuts</b> at 1 °C. The common spoilage related microbial groups were monitored during the <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> beef in activated and non activated plastic bags by using selective media. The use of the antimicrobial packaging caused an overall significant reduction of viable counts of Gram positive bacteria such as carnobacteria, lactic acid bacteria and Brochotrix thermosphacta whose development was inhibited for at least 11 days <b>of</b> <b>storage</b> compared to the control. Moreover, a 1 - 3 log cycles reduction of enterobacteria was also registered between 22 and 32 days <b>of</b> <b>storage.</b> The microbiota was assessed at species level by using Polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) analysis of 16 S rRNA gene of DNA extracted directly from meat and from bulk cells from selective media plates and showed that the species occurring within the targeted microbial groups did not change according to storage conditions. In conclusion, the use of the nisin activated packaging reduced the number of spoilage populations but did not affect the species diversity. Improved antimicrobial packaging is needed, possibly coupled with vacuum storage, to possibly achieve a simultaneous inhibition of more spoilage microbial groups and to preserve the microbiological quality of beef during chilled storage...|$|R

Growth <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> leek inner leaves was significantly reduced to 4 mm at the end <b>of</b> 0 ◦C <b>storage</b> in all three types <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> stalks. Inner leaf growth was maximized during storage at 10 and 20 ◦C in 0 – 11 cm stalks, medium in 0 – 22 cm stalks and minimal in 11 – 22 cm stalks. Fresh weight loss of 0 – 11 cm size was significantly higher than that of 0 – 22 cm size at both 0 and 10 ◦C, whereas there was no difference between 0 – 11 and 11 – 22 cm sizes. At 10 and 20 ◦C the 0 – 11 cm size lost more weight than the 11 – 22 and 0 – 22 cm ones. Differences in color attributes were observed in most cases between stalk sizes, due to different coloration of intact leeks. Discoloration was observed particularly at the stalk base at 20 ◦C.

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{exploring}} data analysis techniques for generating accurate estimates of the loss in quality of fresh fruits, vegetables and cut flowers in chilled supply chains {{based on data from}} advanced sensors. It was motivated by the recent interest in the application of advanced sensors, by emerging concepts in quality controlled logistics, and by the desire to minimise quality losses during transport and <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> the produce. <b>Cut</b> roses were used in this work although the findings will also be applicable to other produce. The literature has reported that whilst temperature was considered to be the most critical post-harvest factor, others such as growing conditions could also be important in the senescence <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> roses. Kinetic modelling was the most commonly used modelling approach for shelf life predictions of foods and perishable produce, but not for estimating vase life (VL) <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> flowers, and so this was explored in this work along with multiple linear regression (MLR) and partial least squares (PLS). As the senescence <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> roses is not fully understood, kinetic modelling could not be implemented directly. Consequently, a novel technique, called Kinetic Linear System (KLS), was developed based on kinetic modelling principles. Simulation studies of shelf life predictions for tomatoes, mushrooms, seasoned soybean sprouts, cooked shrimps and other seafood products showed that the KLS models could effectively replace the kinetic ones. With respect to VL predictions KLS, PLS and MLR were investigated for data analysis from an in-house experiment with cut roses from Cookes Rose Farm (Jersey). The analysis concluded that when the initial and final VLs were available for model calibration, effective estimates of the post-harvest loss in VL <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> roses could be obtained using the post-harvest temperature. Otherwise, when the initial VLs were not available, such effective estimates could not be obtained. Moreover, pre-harvest conditions were shown to correlate with the VL loss but the correlation was too weak to produce or improve an effective estimate of the loss. The results showed that KLS performance was the best while PLS one could be acceptable; but MLR performance was not adequate. In another experiment, boxes <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> roses were transported from a Kenyan farm to a UK distribution centre. Using KLS and PLS techniques, the analysis showed that the growing temperature could be used to obtain effective estimates of the VLs at the farm, at the distribution centre and also the in-transit loss. Further, using post-harvest temperature would lead to a smaller error for the VL at the distribution centre and the VL loss. Nevertheless, the estimates of the VL loss may not be useful practically due to the excessive relative prediction error. Overall, although PLS had a slightly smaller prediction error, KLS worked effectively in many cases where PLS failed, it could handle constraints while PLS could not. In conclusion, KLS and PLS can be used to generate effective estimates of the post-harvest VL loss <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> roses based on post-harvest temperature stresses recorded by advanced sensors. However, the estimates may not be useful practically due to significant relative errors. Alternatively, pre-harvest temperature could be used although it may lead to slightly higher errors. Although PLS had slightly smaller errors KLS was more robust and flexible. Further work is recommended in the objective evaluations of product quality, alternative non-linear techniques and dynamic decision support system.

It was observed that the average tangential and normal components of the cutting forces increase with increase in depth <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> and they reduced in consecutive cutting passes for each depth <b>of</b> <b>cut.</b> Also, {{the ratio of the}} tangential to normal force components decreases as the depth <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> increases, but remains fairly constant after 1. 5 nm depth <b>of</b> <b>cut.</b> The ratio <b>of</b> the cutting force to area decreases with increase in the depth <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> and remains constant after 2. 5 nm depth <b>of</b> <b>cut...</b>|$|R

The {{purpose is}} the {{improvement}} of the method of choosing the retarding regimes <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> rolling within the particular group in order to increase the quality of interval speed control <b>of</b> <b>cuts</b> at the automated hump. Methodology. Simulation method was used for research the trains’ breaking up process at the hump. Findings. The separation conditions <b>of</b> <b>cuts</b> within the particular group and their relation between the retarding regimes <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> control based on a system approach were studied. Interval between cuts within the particular group at the switches and retarders were considered simultaneously. The features of interval controlling at the classification humps with different mutual alignment of the first switch and master retarder were stressed. Originality. The researches found out that during optimization of the retarding regimes <b>of</b> <b>cuts</b> within the particular group one should provide the best conditions <b>of</b> <b>cuts</b> separation at the switches and retarders. Practical value. The problem of choosing the retarding regimes <b>of</b> <b>cuts</b> within the particular group is optimized formally. This retarding regime allows maximizing the minimum value <b>of</b> interval between <b>cuts</b> within the group...|$|R
