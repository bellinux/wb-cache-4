40|$|MBA Professional ReportThe {{purpose of}} this MBA project is to carry out an {{exploratory}} study and conduct an analysis {{to determine if there}} are any correlations between shipboard supply management practices/priorities and SIM Issue Effectiveness rates. Shipboard SIM inventories range from approximately 300 to 350 line items on average per ship. While SIM items constitute {{only a small portion of}} the ship's entire COSAL spare parts inventory, they are critical to the ship's material condition and to its preventive and corrective maintenance programs. Consequently, effective and efficient SIM inventory control is crucial and has a significant impact on the ship's mission readiness. However, surface ships reporting their monthly inventory and performance data to the Type Commander indicate some of the ships are not meeting their SIM Issue Effectiveness goals. The project investigated the variances to determine if they can be explained using correlations with other variables. In addition, the authors analyzed SIM inventory to determine if a Business Processing Reengineering (BPR) through virtual <b>stock</b> <b>consolidation</b> with a shift in emphasis from individual shipboard support to a more global level can result in risk mitigation of SIM stock outs.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of four self-contained papers related to the change of market structure {{and the quality of}} equity market. In Paper [I] we found, by using of a Flexible Dynamic Component Correlations (FDCC) model, that the creation of a common cross-border stock trading platform has increased the long-run trends in conditional correlations between foreign and domestic stock market returns. In Paper [II] we study whether the creation of a uniform Nordic and Baltic stock trading platform has affected weak-form information efficiency. The results indicate that the <b>stock</b> market <b>consolidations</b> have had a positive effect on the information efficiency and turnover for an average firm. The merger effects are, however, asymmetrically distributed in the sense that relatively large (small) firms located on relatively large (small) markets experience an improved (reduced) information efficiency and turnover. Although the results indicate that changes in the level of investor attention (measured by turnover) may explain part of the changes in information efficiency, they also lend support to the hypothesis that merger effects may partially be driven by changes in the composition of informed versus uninformed investors following a stock. Paper [III] analyzes whether the measured level of trust in different countries can explain bilateral stock market correlations. One finding is that generalized trust among nations is a robust predictor for stock market correlations. Another is that the trust effect is larger for countries which are close to each other. This indicates that distance mitigates the trust effect. Finally, we confirm the effect of trust upon stock market correlations, by using particular trust data (bilateral trust between country A and country B) as an alternative measurement of trust. In Paper [IV] we present the impact of the stock market mergers {{that took place in the}} Nordic countries during 2000 – 2007 on the probabilities for stock price jumps, i. e. for relatively extreme price movements.

Specifically, it examines how exchange <b>consolidation</b> has affected <b>stock</b> liquidity and how the effect varies with firm type, i. e. what types of firms benefit the most in terms of stock liquidity. Answering how liquidity has changed – and for which firms – is a valuable contribution to evaluating possible motives for stock exchange merger and whether a cross-border merger is advisable. The results show asymmetric liquidity gains from the Euronext merger, where the positive effects are concentrated among big firms and firms with foreign sales. There is not a significant increase in stock liquidity of small or medium sized firms, nor of firms that only operate domestically.

40|$|The Spanish public {{pension system}} is {{currently}} {{based on the}} pay as you go (PA YOO) principle. This thesis examines the current structure of this public system and its financial viability {{in the face of}} expected demographic changes. First, demographic and macroeconomic models were created extending out to 2050 and, based on them, the finances of the system were estimated assuming that the current regulations would remain largely unchanged. The simulations indicate that the system will show small surpluses for the next years followed by an alarming deterioration beyond 2020, mainly driven by demographic factors such as increasing life expectancy and the reduction in fertility rate observed in the last two decades. The baseline demographic and macroeconomic scenario results in a projected deficit of about 7 % of GDP by 2045. This outlook includes a reduction of unemployment and an increase in labor force participation within reasonable limits. It is also shown that high immigration, fertility and productivity growth, again, within reasonable limits, while improving the financial outlook, do not resolve the issue. Without significant reforms, the system will be faced with a reduction in benefits and/or an increase in the payroll-tax by the second quarter of this century. The model is further used to test the effectiveness of potential reforms. We conclude that a permanent solution could be supported on three pillars: 1. The creation of a Pension Fund with the surpluses of the PAYOO system and a creative investment policy such as that recommended by Modigliani et al. 2. The contribution of the prospective surpluses from the unemployment system (INEM) to the fund during a transitory period. 3. Reforms in the pension calculating procedures that will foster participation in the labor force and eliminate some of the distortions introduced by the current system. These reforms would maintain financial viability without having to raise the payroll-tax. Furthermore, the tax could be reduced gradually beyond 2045. Additionally, this reform would combine advantages from funded pension systems, such as deepening of the capital <b>stock</b> and <b>consolidation</b> of the financial markets, with those of PAYOO schemes, such as their redistributive aspects and "defined benefit" character. by Pedro Sainz de Baranda.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} fiscal policy {{framework}} we call Public Debt Targeting. The framework seeks to smooth primary spending over {{the business cycle}} while remaining consistent with public debt sustainability. Under the proposed framework, a government announces a commitment to a public debt band trajectory over the medium term, while sequentially announcing primary expenditures for the next budget cycle, which are determined recursively based {{on the history of}} shocks. Public debt targeting differs from a structural balance rule in that it internalizes the effect of the deterioration in creditworthiness from fiscal deficits and public debt accumulation, which tend to affect sovereign spreads, interest rates, exchange rates, and economic activity. The proposed framework is applied to Caribbean economies, which in general show high levels of public debt and procyclical primary expenditure.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the remaining barriers for regulatory and market integration {{through the lens}} of two alternative approaches: the Public Interest and the Public Choice approach. The first chapter explains the problematique of this thesis, defines the core questions and sets out the related questions. It also provides background information on the internationalisation of the financial sector and discusses the latest regulatory developments occurring in Europe focusing on the Lamfalussy Process that governs the capital market and particularly the securities markets. It goes on to define the aim of this research and its objectives and to present the outline of the thesis and the conceptual framework employed to approach the subject. Finally, this chapter reviews the literature on the subject and clarifies the contribution of this thesis to existing knowledge. The second chapter refers to the conceptual framework used in this thesis to analyse the regulatory changes and their impact on capital market. This framework builds around the comparison of public interest and public choice models and provides a considerable body of theoretical evidence that identifies and associates rationality with both public and self-interests according to which the two models are not mutually exclusive, can co-exist and even work together. Since RCT applies to both non market and market decisions, the two models, welfare and strategic, develop on two levels: the regulatory and institutional rationality level which covers legal and regulatory decisions (in this thesis EU directives) and the market rationality level, which covers market decisions (in this thesis <b>stock</b> exchanges' <b>consolidation).</b> The third chapter constitutes the primary research and empirical work, making up the first original contribution of this thesis. This chapter is based on textual analysis of the most important directives in the area (Prospectus, Market Abuse and Investment Services), including use of press clippings, published sources, classified archives and qualitative interviews. The latter are conducted with Baron Lamfalussy and with officials of the European Commission. This chapter consists of three parts. The first part refers to the directives included in the FSAP that replaced earlier directives according to the Lamfalussy Process. The second part refers to the Takeover Directive, which, while not included in the Lamfalussy Process is included in this discussion because the market for corporate control is connected with capital market since it depends on the latter's depth and liquidity, and also because it provides evidence of the involvement of domestic interest groups and the sponsoring states in the regulatory reform. The third part compares and contrasts the evidence from the. two previous different but interdependent parts and draws some preliminary concluding remarks. The fourth chapter refers to the analysis of interview material on opinions and perceptions of market and institutional actors on the issues traced in the third chapter. These interviews are conducted with senior executives of European Associations and Federations Eu, ropean regulators, and academics. The views of Baron Lamfalussy and EC officials, collected thr ough the respective interviews, are also presented in this chapter. The fifth chapter, which constitutes the market rationality level, refers to the consolidation of European exchanges, which, as seen in the third chapter, are highly affected by the new directives since the latter intensify the competition not only b~tween exchanges but also between exchanges and alternative trading systems. This chapter makes up the second original contribution of this thesis since it investigates how far the actions of the newly commercialised exchanges comply with changes in regulation and interact with integration. The sixth chapter compares and contrasts the experience from the capital market industry with the experience from banking and civil aviation industries and shows that the chosen conceptual framework can be applied to various sectors and that the cross-sectoral comparisons of regulatory and market developments add evidence to the coexistence of public interest and public choice models. The seventh chapter draws conclusions on the regulatory and market developments expected to lead to capital market integration and reviews the remaining barriers. It also discusses the impact of these developments along with those in banking and civil aviation on the whole European integration project.

40|$|In {{recent years}} the European {{financial}} system has been characterized by large scale, deep, irreversible changes in its structure, due to deregulation and concentration processes. The growing competitive pressures have forced financial intermediaries to rethink strategic and organizational choices {{in order to achieve}} better performance. Globalization and the financial crisis emphasize the problems caused by worldwide banking structures and require a reassessment of groups’ development strategies. Given the importance and centrality of the consolidation processes for the European financial industry, the goals of this book are:- to analyze the concentration process in the European financial system and its implications for the strategic evolution of the banking industry, the corporate governance of intermediaries and regulation and financial supervision;- to investigate the consolidation processes both in the banking industry and in the financial markets (Stock Exchange industry);- to focus on cross-border concentration processes in the European context. This book is the outcome of research undertaken by three groups of academics, from the Universities of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Udine and Verona, as part of a National Research Project (PRIN) financed by the Universities themselves and the Italian Ministry of Education, entitled ‘Financial intermediaries cross-border and cross-sector concentration processes in Europe: regulatory, strategic and management issues and value creation’. The central theme is the general process of consolidation, and the M&A operations in particular, widespread in the financial sector since the early Nineties of the last century, and responsible for a radical transformation of the structural characteristics of the banking and financial systems in both Europe and the United States. The main drivers of this process have been the liberalisation and integration of the European market and, in more general terms, the IT revolution and the globalisation of financial markets worldwide. The subject of consolidation in the financial sector, focus of attention for large numbers of academics and operators in many countries over a considerable time, has recently acquired even greater significance {{in the aftermath of the}} financial crisis. For a long time, favourable macroeconomic conditions meant that the positive aspects of these processes were most in evidence, especially the new availability of financial services to the mass market, the expansion of the range of services benefiting more or less all categories of clientele and, probably, a tendency to an increase in the efficiency of both markets and systems. However, the resulting formation of very large banking and financial groups, operating at the cross-border level and subject only to constraints and controls which all proved to be more or less ineffectual and inefficient, generated huge concentrations of risks and levels of correlation responsible for the spread of the recent financial crisis across almost the entire globe. On the one hand, the crisis revealed the obstacles to the success of banks’ M&A-based growth strategies, while on the other it highlighted the pitfalls of the creation of very large, complex groups, certainly capable of achieving synergies and competitive advantages, but also generating negative effects with regard to operating efficiency, groups’ governance and control, and the rationality of the structures themselves. Banking consolidation processes, and the body of M&A operations through which they have taken place, are thus being reviewed today in the light of utterly new facts and processes, which on the operational level have led to the largest mobilisation of public resources ever seen, and on the intellectual scene are catalysing the attention of vast numbers of analysts and academics all over the world. This book focuses on the consolidation process that has taken place within the financial system of the European Union. One distinctive feature of this process in the case of Europe is the growing number of cross-border and cross-sector M&As, a key factor in the integration of the credit and financial markets. Unfortunately, this process has not been accompanied by the introduction of effective regulation and supervision for the groups formed, an asymmetry made all too clear at the peak of the financial crisis, by the implosion of two of Europe's largest cross-border, cross-sector groups, Fortis and Dexia, and the subsequent rescue operations. The book consists of 12 chapters, which together cover the subject of consolidation in the banking, insurance and stock exchange sectors, with some specific discussions of topics relating to regulation and supervision. The strong focus on the banking sector reflects its central role in all Europe’s financial systems. The first two chapters provide a general description of the phenomenon. Chapter 1 sets out to provide a general definition of the consolidation process in the banking-financial industry by outlining the course of events in both the European Union and the USA. It defines the types of operations carried out (cross-border and cross-sector) and then discusses their aims, motivations and drivers. This is followed by a survey of the main negative consequences of the banking consolidation process, and the body of M&A operations through which it has taken place, overlooked in the literature but made starkly obvious by the crisis. It is thus clear that the subject of consolidation is destined to remain at the centre of the debate on banking and finance for a long time to come. Chapter 2 offers a broad survey of the vast literature of theoretical and empirical studies on financial sector consolidation that has appeared since the mid Nineties, discussing findings for the USA, European and international markets. The two chapters which follow analyse the implications and consequences of financial sector M&As. Chapter 3 considers the measurement of a number of effects of consolidation operations in the financial industry, concentrating in particular on the degrees of internationalisation of systems and strategic diversification, and the measurement of value creation. Chapter 4 is an empirical analysis of the effects of banking consolidation operations in terms of shareholder value and risk, with in-depth discussion of the role of the phenomenon’s cross-border and cross-sector dimensions. The survey is conducted on a large, comprehensive and original list of M&A operations concluded from 1997 to 2007 by banks and insurance companies from EMU countries, with a focus on a sample of listed firms from this group. The three chapters which follow basically cover consolidation amongst the large groups which form the top tier of banking systems. Chapter 5 reports on the dynamics of the consolidation of major European banking groups during the period 2000 - 8, and provides an overview of the expansion policies pursued by these groups in recent years. It also considers the impact of the sub-prime mortgage crisis. The study includes the top fifteen European banking groups by stock market capitalisation and total assets, with two Spanish, three French, three British, two Swiss, one Dutch, two Italian and two German banks. Chapter 6 studies a fairly recent aspect which is however of major of importance for the future evolution of the largest banking and financial groups in both European and North America, partly in the light of the crisis: the changes in their ownership structure, concentrating in particular in the role of the Sovereign Wealth Funds, most of them from non-European states. This is done by analyzing the 44 most important global banking groups in terms of capitalization and total assets. Twenty-three groups are based in Europe, 18 in the United States and Canada, and three in Japan. One smaller bank, Standard Chartered, is also included following the massive recapitalization of the group by SWFs. Chapter 7 focuses on an equally specific topic which is also extremely important, especially for large banking groups: the possible links between growth, bank size and operational risk. The aim is to examine the dynamics of operational risk during consolidation by seeking to identify changes in the quality and quantity of operational risk in the newly merged group compared to the pre-merger situation. A case study is presented, dealing with the two largest Italian banking groups: Unicredit Group and Intesa SanPaolo. The next two chapters are on the subject of regulation and supervision, an urgent priority given the events of the financial crisis. Chapter 8 considers the insurance sector, and especially the outcomes of the geographical diversification of insurance companies and the implications of the capital regime to be introduced by the Solvency 2 framework, now being asked to bridge the gap between regulation and business operations. Europe’s legislators are currently hard at work on this framework, which although scheduled for implementation in 2012 is still struggling to achieve a standard approach for the financial requirements, supervisory review process and market conduct of European insurers and reinsurers. Chapter 9 discusses the regulation and supervision of cross-border groups operating in the EU in the light of the crisis. It outlines the existing regulatory and supervisory framework and highlights the imbalance between it and the development of cross-border groups and the inadequacies that have come to light, before discussing the cases of Dexia and Fortis, the two most dramatic European banking group collapses. It then moves on to a critical examination of the main reforms on the drawing board, especially those put forward by the de Larosière Report, with its proposals for the establishment of two pillars: micro-prudential supervision and macro-prudential supervision. The two chapters which follow cover <b>consolidation</b> in the <b>stock</b> exchange sector. Chapter 10 studies the ongoing moves to merge the main markets, investigating their drivers and implications. The focus is on the European <b>stock</b> exchange <b>consolidation</b> process fostered by the new regulatory framework introduced by the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID). The evidence is twofold: even though there is a continuous process of <b>consolidation</b> in the <b>stock</b> exchange industry, barriers to entry continue to fall and new competitors obtain authorization to operate as Multilateral Trading Facilities (MTFs). However the crisis has hit banks, the main shareholders of MTFs, hard, thus slowing down the rate of start-ups. Chapter 11 concentrates on the effects on the market consolidation process in terms of the governance and value both of the markets themselves and of the companies which operate them. An empirical analysis is carried out on the valuation criteria adopted in the most recent stock exchange mergers (mainly NYSE Group and Euronext; London Stock Exchange and Borsa Italiana). Value drivers are examined, in particular the relationship between operational exchange volumes and economic-financial dynamics. Moreover, stock exchange pricing is related to the specific governance structure resulting from exchange mergers. Chapter 12 discusses the integration of systems and markets, with particular attention to the problems arising from the widespread obstacles to the regulation of international operations, and the possible solutions. The analysis reveals that the existing regulatory framework on matters affecting the regulation of cross-border transactions appears to be not only incomplete, but also incapable of provide a satisfactory level of certainty. At the European level, the problems posed by the crises hitting intermediaries working in a multiplicity of legal contexts require the adoption of the necessary reforms by member states, thus opening the way to truly international standards, complete solutions for the regulation of cross-border settlements. The research findings were presented at a workshop at the University of Verona. The comments received and the subsequent discussions provided useful input for the final drafting of the various articles. Thanks in particular to Roberto Tedeschi and Prof. Francesco Vella...|$|R
