40|$|This study {{focuses on}} {{technology}} integration within the <b>secondary</b> <b>art</b> <b>education</b> classroom and its affects on practices and paradigms. Its {{purpose is to}} find out what secondary art educators believe to be the role and function of technology within art education. This study is exploratory in nature, using qualitative research methods with quantitative support. Ideas from current literature were used to develop a questionnaire, which was sent to 300 secondary art educators and then followed by six case studies. The data collected from the questionnaire and the case studies was analyzed for common themes and issues. Five main themes emerged from this study. First, teachers believe that the role and function of technology in the classroom is limited by, encouraged by or shaped by the attitudes and understandings of administrators. Second, teachers believe there are benefits and drawbacks to technology integration, which creates a friend/foe relationship between technology and teachers. Third, teachers believe that technology skills are necessary for those <b>secondary</b> <b>art</b> <b>education</b> students who wish to pursue a career in the arts. Fourth, technology integration in art education is creating new roles, definitions and practices among art educators. Fifth, teachers believe the role and function of technology in the <b>secondary</b> <b>art</b> <b>education</b> classroom is that of a tool for teaching, research and final production, as well as being a new medium. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{doctoral}} investigation examines educational {{relationships between}} museums and schools, {{and more specifically}} between art museums and <b>secondary</b> <b>art</b> <b>education.</b> The author's analysis of literature pertaining to museum/school relationships and previous research conducted within Honours research establishes systematic contradictions as permeating the public role of museums and educational engagements with museums. In seeking explanation, a theoretical framework, derived from the social theories of Pierre Bourdieu is developed. The framework is used to interrogate the practices of school-based art education and art museums, and the agents involved, to examine how social relations operate to enable and constrain the representation and engagement of secondary school-based perspectives in the museum setting. Aspects that have previously remained unacknowledged are examined to reveal the interplay of factors that influence educational experiences in the art museum setting. Using {{the findings from the}} first stage of the analysis, in concert with the Bourdieuan framework, the author develops a model for learning in art museums that explores and articulates a new pedagogical terrain in the art educational use of art museums. A socio-cognitive framework is developed to reflect the strategic incorporation of museological knowledge, contemporary art education philosophies and practices and sociological theory. The aims of the model are to engage <b>secondary</b> <b>art</b> <b>education</b> and art museums using a sociological perspective, provide the tools for secondary art educators to be autonomous in the art museum setting, recognize that individuals relate to cultural materials and experiences in varying and multiple ways and develop educational encounters that predispose learners to engage in the cultural practice of art museum visiting. In intrinsically valuing art museum experiences as distinctive learning opportunities, the model provides teaching and learning strategies that allow for a multi-faceted, developmentally appropriate and cognitively based educational involvement. As the ultimate outcome of the research the model has significance for secondary art students, secondary art educators, teacher educators and art museum educators. It is unique in providing a secondary school-based art educational perspective on learning in art museums that is designed to establish a foundation for cultural practice, within and beyond the school years...|$|E

The paper argues that current practice confuses procedural knowledge with declarative knowledge. A corollary is that assessment evidence for 'knowing how', which is shown or demonstrated, is confused with assessment evidence for 'knowing that', which requires spoken or written forms of reporting. The confusion is replicated in the national examination, the General Certificate of Secondary Education, taken by students at the age of 16. The article traces this confusion to three dualisms: the Cartesian dualisms of mind and body, an individual mind and the distributed mind of culture, and the more recent mind-in-brain hemisphere dualism. The article advocates a Wittgensteinian embodied, socio-cultural view of mind as a way of solving the current conceptual confusion that prevails in art education in the UK...|$|E

40|$|High {{levels of}} {{engagement}} with technology {{are characteristic of}} young people in the 21 st century. Teachers and curriculum designers can utilize students' comfort with technology to enhance learning. Easy access to information on the Internet is also significant because the former role of teachers as a primary source of information is no longer central to students' learning; effective teaching may need to be rethought to acknowledge the informal learning that pervades our students' lives. This article examines an undergraduate degree program in popular music that has embraced a wide range of music-making technologies as pedagogical aids and uses rich assessment tasks including both technological and musical aspects.

40|$|A Thesis Submitted In Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements For the Degree of Master of Science-Educational LeadershipThe {{impact of}} modernism and postmodernism on {{contemporary}} pedagogy is broad and deep. Kant's philosophy provides {{the framework for}} a reality based on rationalization of facts and emotions while Nietzsche's influence reduces human behavior {{to the search for}} authenticity and power. Contemporary art inspired by these thinkers has influenced the secondary art classroom by providing a historical foundation built on aesthetic, emotional expression, fact-based scientistic reasoning, personal identity, and cultural provocation. Unfortunately, the promise to increase the development of critical thinking and creativity has gone largely unkept, hindered by the inherent theoretical implications associated with the pursuit of facts, feelings, power, and empathy. At best, modernism and postmodernism promote the exploration of individually-created realities which renders morality and thought relative and thus empty. At worst, it justifies arrogant sociocultural themes via a provocative pursuit of identity based on assertions of authenticity and power. ! Proposed is a reimagining of modern pedagogy in the <b>secondary</b> <b>art</b> <b>education</b> classroom. Central to that task is the work of Ananda K. Coomaraswamy, curator of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, whose work remains vitally important to the field of art and art history. Coomaraswamy's scholarship advocates that for art to be educational, study must include an exploration of the theories behind the artist's work "in order to understand the things they made by art. " Additionally, students must be free to critically analyze those theories to determine their validity, a necessary component of Coomaraswamy's overarching theory that the education of art must challenge a student's worldview in order to determine whether different views of reality may be, in fact, truer than their own. !!!!...|$|E
