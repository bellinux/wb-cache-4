2500|$|The 167th Brigade {{also had}} a fast start but when it reached {{the north end of}} Nonne Bosschen, found mud [...] deep. The brigade went round to the left which caused a gap between the 167th and 169th brigades. The quick start had been partly due to the rear waves pushing up to avoid German {{shelling}} on the left of the brigade. The supporting infantry mingled with the foremost troops and failed to mop up the captured ground or German troops who had been overrun, who began sniping at both brigades from behind them. Part of a company reached the area north of Polygon Wood, {{at about the same time}} as small numbers of troops from the 8th Division attacking to the north. The ground conditions in the 56th Division area were so bad, that none of the tanks in support got into action. A protective barrage fired in front of the intermediate objective failed to prevent troops from Infantry Regiment 145 penetrating gaps and surrounding the four battalions of the 56th Division by [...] A German creeping barrage followed by infantry began and overran the surrounded battalions, whose survivors collected behind the <b>sunken</b> <b>track</b> in Glencorse Wood and the west side of Nonne Bosschen. Machine-gunners of the 9th London Battalion managed to stop the German advance and when news of the German attack reached the 167th Brigade HQ the plan to form the southern defensive flank was cancelled.|$|E

40|$|Photograph of {{a view of}} Fifth Street looking {{east from}} Spring Street in Los Angeles, ca. 1918. Fifth Street is at center and heads away from the viewer. It is lined with {{sidewalks}} and tall buildings. Several early-model automobiles are parked {{along the edge of}} the street, and a streetcar is navigating its way down the middle of the road on <b>sunken</b> <b>tracks.</b> The sidewalks are crowded with pedestrians. Several of the shops at left have awnings projecting out over the sidewalk, while the large office buildings at right have banks of identical rectangular windows. A maze of utility wires hangs over the street in the distance at center. The Alexandria Hotel is at right. Legible signs include, from left to right, "Phone T 5435 Signs", "Painless [?] 25 ", "Dr. Hammond Dentist", "The Express", "Rimpau Ave", "Washington St. ", and "New York Outfit [?] Cloaks, Suits"...|$|R
2500|$|Following the Normandy {{landings}} of June 1944, [...] as Allied forces pushed inland {{from the}} French coast, {{they found themselves}} operating within an area of Normandy's countryside known as the bocage. The actual bocage landscape extends further than the limited definition of bocage normand, that is to say, from the area directly west of Arromanches-les-Bains, including the entire Cotentin Peninsula, {{to the south of}} Brittany, Maine, and Vendée. In some areas, this terrain stretches for [...] This landscape contained large earth dikes averaging [...] high that were covered with tangled hedges, bushes, and trees that surrounded small raised irregular-sized fields, which were generally no more than [...] across. The nature of the hedgerows—"sturdy embankments, half earth, half hedge" [...] up to [...] high with interlocking root systems—made excavating them extremely difficult, even with machinery. Narrow <b>sunken</b> <b>tracks</b> were the only pathways between these banks. Tank movement was severely restricted, preventing the Allied forces from bringing their vehicle superiority to bear. The rolling landscape was also dotted with small rivers, woods, and fruit trees, along with scattered stone farmhouses and their outbuildings.|$|R
5000|$|NJ Transit's Morristown Line and Gladstone Branch merge at Summit station, {{providing}} frequent passenger {{service to}} Hoboken Terminal or New York's Penn Station. The train ride from Summit to New York is about 50 minutes (local) or 35 minutes (express). One reporter wrote: [...] "The train line dominates Summit, bisecting its handsome commercial district {{from the town}} green on a <b>sunken</b> <b>track,</b> like a Dutch canal." ...|$|E
50|$|To {{the north}} of the village lies Hartburn Glebe, an area of {{woodland}} alongside the river Hart Burn currently in the care of the Woodland Trust http://www.wt-woods.org.uk/HartburnGlebe. A grotto, also known as Hartburn Glebe, was constructed by an 18th-century Vicar of Hartburn (Dr John Sharpe) as a changing area for ladies wishing to bathe in the river. Near the grotto there are postholes carved in the stone of the river-bed, which show where the Roman bridge crossed the river. Leading down to them is a <b>sunken</b> <b>track</b> called The Cut, which has been claimed to be the true line of the Devil's Causeway - its actual route through Hartburn is disputed. Possibly there were two routes through the woods, both now marked by sunken lanes, the western one pre-dating the building of the bridge, and the eastern one post-dating it.|$|E

At 4:00 p.m. the Germans counter-attacked from Polygon Wood and forced back the remnants of the 169th Brigade at the <b>sunken</b> <b>track</b> to the start-line at the west end of the wood. The 167th Brigade fell back as its southern flank was exposed and about 1,000 German infantry tried to exploit their success but British SOS flares were seen by the artillery, which inflicted many losses and defeated the attack. By evening, the effect of German enfilade-fire led to the 8th Division brigades being ordered back, close to their start-line. In a diary entry, Rupprecht wrote that the casualties in Army Group Prince Rupprecht from 1 June to 10 August, were 87,528 men and that it was impossible for the 4th Army to conduct more than small attacks to improve their positions, Langemarck could not be recaptured.|$|E
50|$|Grant Park, with 319 acre {{between the}} {{downtown}} Chicago Loop and Lake Michigan, offers many different attractions in its large open space. The park is generally flat. It is also crossed by large boulevards {{and even a}} bed of <b>sunken</b> railroad <b>tracks.</b> While bridges are used to span the tracks, and also used to connect with Millennium Park, {{the rest of the}} park must be reached by pedestrians at traffic crossings, except for a spacious underpass connection to the Museum Campus. There are also several parking garages under the park, along Michigan Avenue and east of Columbus Drive.|$|R
50|$|Vester, Nørre and Øster Farimagsgade (lit. West, North and East Farimagsgade) is a {{succession}} of streets which together connect the south-western Vesterbro to the northern Østerbro along {{the periphery of the}} city centre in Copenhagen, Denmark. A continuation of Reventlowsgade, Vester Farimagsgade extends from Vesterbrogade at Vesterport Station and, initially, runs along the <b>sunken</b> railway <b>tracks</b> on the left before soon reaching H. C. Andersens Boulevard. It then turns into Nørre Farimagsgade and continues behind Ørsted Park to Gothersgade where it becomes Øster Farimagsgade and proceeds along another greenspace, the Copenhagen Botanical Garden, passes Sølvtorvet and the neighbourhood of terraced houses known as Kartoffelrækkerne before terminating at Lille Triangel where Østerbrogade begins.|$|R
40|$|Over time, the water-ways {{that lead}} from Naples to Miseno have mapped out {{the area and}} changed the lines of its appearance. They have shaped the {{landscape}} and developed intertwining networks across it, both above and below ground. At times these are visible, at times submerged. Here they are natural; there they {{are the result of}} human intervention. They are the signs of long-term phenomena, of large environmental and territorial transformations which have characterised the different interaction between man and landscape. In this perspective it is evident that integration of knowledge and an interdisciplinary approach to actions is all the more necessary. Analysis and reconstruction of the water-ways that lead from Naples to Miseno, a special section of our urban landscape, are the subject of research work that aims to identify and develop the qualitative relationship with the places where we live, woven into history and technique and unavoidably linked to the sea. The investigation route follows the traces of these ways from the city to the surrounding areas, filling in gaps and making hypotheses where traces have been lost. It focuses on defined architectural and archaeological points (such as springs and reservoirs), on the network elements, the aqueducts, and goes up the coast to the ports of Baia and Miseno, and the seabed. At the same time, analysis conducted on representative artifacts of archaeological sites in the Phlegraean area and on <b>sunken</b> <b>tracks</b> (both underground and under the sea) can be identified as parametric and, as a result of media mapping and thematic and dynamic support, representations of the region’s archaeological potential take shape that allow us to understand and plan for intervention work and land transformation...|$|R

5000|$|The tunnel is {{designed}} {{with a single}} highway lane. The floor of the tunnel is constructed of 1,800 texturized concrete panels (each 7.5 ft by 8 ft) with the railroad <b>tracks</b> <b>sunken</b> slightly below the road surface. The interior is exposed rock, and contains several [...] "safe-houses", which are small buildings {{that are used in}} case of severe earthquakes, vehicle fires, or other emergencies. The tunnel also contains several pull-outs, which are reserved for disabled vehicles. The tunnel uses a combination of portal fans and reversible jet engines to ensure proper air flow and air quality throughout the tunnel. There are two backup generators to ensure that the computerized traffic controls and safe-house ventilation systems in the tunnel continue to function {{in the event of a}} power failure. Because eastbound traffic, westbound traffic, and the Alaska Railroad must share the tunnel, rail and road traffic are coordinated by two sophisticated computer-based systems: the Tunnel Control System and the Train Signal System. These systems control the timing of vehicles entering the tunnel, spacing them for safety, and lower railroad gates when a train is approaching. The tunnel's entrance portals are designed in an A-shape, with a large, train-sized [...] "garage door", which allows traffic in and out of the tunnel. The entrance portals are designed to withstand the force of an avalanche. The tunnel's eastern terminus is in Whittier. The staging areas on either side of the tunnel can accommodate as many as 450 vehicles waiting to pass through.|$|R
