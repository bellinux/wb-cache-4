50|$|Draco Dwarf {{contains}} many red giant branch (RGB) stars; five carbon <b>stars</b> <b>have</b> {{been identified in}} Draco Dwarf and four likely asymptotic giant branch (AGB) <b>stars</b> <b>have</b> been detected.|$|R
50|$|An NYPD {{spokesperson}} initially {{reported that}} <b>Star</b> <b>had</b> died. However, the next day, {{a spokesperson for}} the New York City Animal Care and Control facility reported that <b>Star</b> <b>had</b> survived the shooting, but that according to the NYPD, her chances of survival were poor.|$|R
25|$|Class-S stars form a {{continuum}} between class-M stars and carbon stars. Those most similar to class-M <b>stars</b> <b>have</b> strong ZrO absorption bands {{analogous to the}} TiO bands of class-M stars, whereas those most similar to carbon <b>stars</b> <b>have</b> strong sodium D lines and weak C2 bands. Class-S <b>stars</b> <b>have</b> excess amounts of zirconium and other elements produced by the s-process, and have more similar carbon and oxygen abundances than class-M or carbon stars. Like carbon stars, nearly all known class-S stars are asymptotic-giant-branch stars.|$|R
5|$|WASP-43 has one {{detected}} {{planet in}} its orbit, WASP-43b. The <b>star</b> <b>has</b> an apparent magnitude of 12.4, {{and thus is}} too faint {{to be seen with}} the unaided eye from Earth.|$|E
5|$|After a <b>star</b> <b>has</b> {{finished}} generating energy through thermonuclear fusion, it {{evolves into}} a more compact, degenerate state. During this process {{the dimensions of the}} star are significantly reduced, which can result in a corresponding increase in angular velocity.|$|E
5|$|After the <b>star</b> <b>has</b> fused the helium of its core, {{the carbon}} product fuses {{producing}} a hot core with an outer shell of fusing helium. The star then follows an evolutionary path called the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) that parallels the other described red giant phase, {{but with a}} higher luminosity. The more massive AGB stars may undergo {{a brief period of}} carbon fusion before the core becomes degenerate.|$|E

5|$|When both {{rates of}} {{movement}} are known, the space {{velocity of the}} star relative to the Sun or the galaxy can be computed. Among nearby <b>stars,</b> it <b>has</b> been found that younger population I <b>stars</b> <b>have</b> generally lower velocities than older, population II <b>stars.</b> The latter <b>have</b> elliptical orbits that are inclined to {{the plane of the}} galaxy. A comparison of the kinematics of nearby <b>stars</b> <b>has</b> allowed astronomers to trace their origin to common points in giant molecular clouds, and are referred to as stellar associations.|$|R
5000|$|Castor was {{recorded}} as a double star in 1718 by James Pound. It {{may have been}} resolved in 1678 by Cassini. The separation of the two <b>stars</b> <b>has</b> increased from 2" [...] in 1970 to about 6" [...] in 2017. [...] The two <b>stars</b> <b>have</b> magnitudes of 1.9 and 3.0.|$|R
5|$|As a red dwarf, Gliese 876 is {{much less}} massive than the Sun: {{estimates}} suggest it has only 32% {{of the mass of}} the Sun. The surface temperature of Gliese 876 is cooler than the Sun and the <b>star</b> <b>has</b> a smaller radius. These factors combine to make the star only 1.24% as luminous as the Sun, and most of this is at infrared wavelengths.|$|E
5|$|The bright primary <b>star</b> <b>has</b> the {{multiple}} star designation WDS19508+0852A and has three faint visual companion stars, WDS19508+0852B, C, and D. Component B is not physically close to A but merely appears {{close to it}} in the sky.|$|E
5|$|The ratio between planet MOA-2009-BLG-387Lb's mass {{to that of}} {{its host}} <b>star</b> <b>has</b> been found with accuracy. However, because the host star's {{characteristics}} are not as well-constrained, the planet's characteristics are not well-constrained either. The inability to constrain many of MOA-2009-BLG-387L's characteristics {{is a consequence of}} the fact that the star acted as the lens in the microlensing event, which compromised the ability to collect most of the star's stellar parameters.|$|E

5|$|An {{extreme example}} of an {{equatorial}} bulge is found on the star Regulus A (α Leonis A). The equator of this <b>star</b> <b>has</b> a measured rotational velocity of 317±3km/s. This corresponds to a rotation period of 15.9 hours, which is 86% of the velocity at which the star would break apart. The equatorial radius of this star is 32% larger than polar radius. Other rapidly rotating stars include Alpha Arae, Pleione, Vega and Achernar.|$|E
5|$|Beta Pictoris {{is a star}} in the {{southern}} constellation of Pictor, the Easel, and is located {{to the west of the}} bright star Canopus. It traditionally marked the sounding line of the ship Argo Navis, before the constellation was split. The <b>star</b> <b>has</b> an apparent visual magnitude of 3.861, so is visible to the naked eye under good conditions, though light pollution may result in stars dimmer than magnitude 3 being too dim to see. It is the second brightest in its constellation, exceeded only by Alpha Pictoris, which has an apparent magnitude of 3.30.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} for Outlaw <b>Star</b> <b>has</b> been mostly positive. Many reviewers praised the anime series, particularly its animation style and its balance of dramatic and comedic elements. However, some found fault with the show's pacing, {{believing that the}} storyline quality begins to wane {{after the first few}} episodes. Sunrise produced a spin-off television series titled , which aired in Japan in 1999. Preliminary plans were made to create a direct sequel {{in the form of a}} single-episode (OVA) called Sword of Wind, but production never began.|$|E

50|$|At present Blue <b>Stars</b> <b>has</b> no more {{teams at}} the highest level. In 2007, they had only 27 members and stood Blue Stars for {{choosing}} {{whether or not to}} proceed with the association. Blue <b>Stars</b> <b>has</b> then taken by a number of enthusiasts, the decision to go ahead and blow new life into the club. From that moment on Blue Stars started again with a youth section. Blue Stars Men 1 and 2 are in the Rayon. Other teams from the region classes of Amsterdam region. Blue <b>Stars</b> <b>has</b> in the 2013-2014 season more than 130 members.|$|R

5|$|Globular {{clusters}} have a {{very high}} star density, and therefore close interactions and near-collisions of stars occur relatively often. Due to these chance encounters, some exotic classes of stars, such as blue stragglers, millisecond pulsars and low-mass X-ray binaries, are much more common in globular clusters. A blue straggler is formed from the merger of two stars, possibly {{as a result of an}} encounter with a binary system. The resulting <b>star</b> <b>has</b> a higher temperature than comparable stars in the cluster with the same luminosity, and thus differs from the main sequence stars formed at the beginning of the cluster.|$|E
5|$|In Mission Mode, {{the player}} must {{complete}} missions, each with objectives {{that range from}} collecting coins to attacking enemies. In each mission, the player controls a pre-specified character. There are seven levels with eight missions in each. After completing each mission, the player's performance is given a grade of stars (three, two, or one) or letters (A, B, C, D, or E). After all eight missions in a level are complete, the player must complete a boss mission {{to advance to the}} next level. Once the first six levels are complete, and the rank of at least one <b>star</b> <b>has</b> been obtained on every mission, the seventh level is unlocked.|$|E
5|$|Mu Arae (μ Arae, {{abbreviated}} Mu Ara, μ Ara), often designated HD 160691, {{also named}} Cervantes, is a main sequence G-type star approximately 50 light-years {{away from the}} Sun in the constellation of Ara. The <b>star</b> <b>has</b> a planetary system with four known extrasolar planets (designated Mu Arae b, c, d and e; later named Quijote, Dulcinea, Rocinante and Sancho, respectively), three of them with masses {{comparable to that of}} Jupiter. The system's innermost planet was the first 'hot Neptune' or 'super-Earth' to be discovered.|$|E

5|$|Serpens Caput {{contains}} many RR Lyrae variables, although most are too faint {{to be seen}} without professional photography. The brightest is VY Serpentis, only of 10th magnitude. This star's period has been increasing by approximately 1.2 seconds per century. A variable star {{of a different kind}} is Tau4 Serpentis, a cool red giant that pulsates between magnitudes 5.89 and 7.07 in 87 days. This <b>star</b> <b>has</b> been found to display an inverse P Cygni profile, where cold infalling gas on to the star creates redshifted hydrogen absorption lines next to the normal emission lines.|$|E
5|$|The Kepler {{team has}} said that Kepler-11b and Kepler-11c are {{probably}} composed mostly of water with a thin hydrogen and helium atmosphere. In comparison to the outer planets of the system, which probably have large hydrogen and helium atmospheres, Kepler-11c's proximity to its <b>star</b> <b>has</b> blown off most of its atmosphere. Kepler-11 and its six-planet system form what NASA considers {{to be the most}} compact and flattest planetary system yet discovered. Kepler-11b and Kepler-11c orbit Kepler-11 with a phenomenon called orbital resonance, a gravitational tugging that keeps their orbit stable at a 5.4 ratio.|$|E
5|$|The Shooting Star was a {{commercial}} success and {{was published in}} book form by Casterman shortly after its conclusion; the first Tintin volume to be originally published in the 62-page full-colour format. Hergé continued The Adventures of Tintin with The Secret of the Unicorn, while the series itself became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. The Shooting <b>Star</b> <b>has</b> received a mixed critical reception and {{has been one of}} the most controversial instalments in the series due to the anti-Semitic portrayal of its villain. The story was adapted for both the 1957 Belvision animated series, Hergé's Adventures of Tintin, and for the 1991 animated series The Adventures of Tintin by Ellipse and Nelvana.|$|E
