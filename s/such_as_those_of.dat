5|$|For example, the Christian Church uses musical {{instruments}} in worship (known as the Christian Church), whereas the Churches of Christ believe acappella singing to be proper. In addition, {{there was also}} disagreement over the appropriateness of organizational structures above the congregational level, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> missionary societies and funding orphanages.|$|E

5|$|In A Theory of Content and Other Essays (1990), Fodor {{takes up}} {{another of his}} central notions: the {{question}} of the reality of mental representations. Fodor needs to justify representational realism to justify the idea that the contents of mental states are expressed in symbolic structures <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> the LOT.|$|E
5|$|Jesus for President: Politics for Ordinary Radicals is a 2008 book co-written by Evangelical authors Shane Claiborne and Chris Haw, two {{important}} figures in New Monasticism. The book {{asserts that the}} countercultural themes in the ministry of Jesus, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> self-denial, are ignored by American Christians because they have become accustomed to exercising Christian privilege and are unwilling to give it up.|$|E
5|$|Social satire and {{the theme}} of {{consumerism}} are frequent sources of humor in the plot of Crash: Mind over Mutant, with the game featuring jokes about SUVs and the skyrocketing prices of gas at the time.

60|$|Godwin stood {{wringing}} {{his hands}} while the bishop strove to comfort him, {{saying that he}} should not grieve, since <b>such</b> deaths <b>as</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> Rosamund and Wulf were most glorious, and more to be desired than a hundred lives.|$|R
50|$|The {{mangrove}} {{branches and}} trunks support various epiphytes, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> bromeliads. <b>Those</b> <b>of</b> the genus Tillandsia found in them include Spanish moss, and reindeer lichen. Below the water, spaces protected by splayed mangrove roots can shelter seagrasses.|$|R
50|$|Panama hats are light-colored, lightweight, and breathable, {{and often}} worn as {{accessories}} to summer-weight suits, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>those</b> made <b>of</b> linen or silk.

5|$|The adult russet sparrow {{is mostly}} a seed-eater, eating the seeds of herbs and weeds as well as rice, barley, and other grains. Berries, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> the kingore (certain Berberis spp.), are also eaten when available. Nestlings are fed mostly on insects, {{especially}} caterpillars and larval beetles obtained on trees and flying insects caught by aerial pursuit. During the breeding season adults also consume insects.|$|E
5|$|The {{narrative}} {{draws on}} various Romantic literary traditions, {{such as the}} comedy of manners, the Gothic tale, and the Byronic hero. The novel's language is a pastiche of 19th-century writing styles, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> Jane Austen and Charles Dickens. Clarke describes the supernatural with careful detail. She supplements the text with almost 200 footnotes, outlining the backstory and an entire fictional corpus of magical scholarship.|$|E
5|$|The {{scaly-breasted munia}} feeds mainly on seeds but also eats small berries <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> Lantana. Although {{the bill is}} suited for {{crushing}} small grains, they do not show lateral movements of the lower mandible which help European greenfinches in dehusking seeds. Like some other munias, they may also feed on algae, a rich protein source, prior to the breeding season.|$|E
50|$|Extensive {{upwelling}} of nutrient-rich water {{makes the}} GSACUS an important marine hot spot on Australia's southern shelves. During upwelling events, {{the abundance of}} the GSACUS ecosystem can approach that {{of some of the}} world’s most productive upwelling centers, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>those</b> offshore <b>of</b> Peru, California, and Namibia.|$|R
25|$|The {{evolutionary}} biologist Richard Dawkins {{argued in}} a 1989 book that organisms have an extended phenotype that consists {{not only of}} the expression of their own genes, but, among other things (<b>such</b> <b>as</b> artefacts), <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> their parasites. This, he suggested, could apply not only to endoparasites but to <b>those</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> cuckoos that only briefly come into contact with their hosts.|$|R
25|$|With {{the loss}} of the study of ancient Greek in the early medieval Latin West, Aristotle was {{practically}} unknown there from c. AD 600 to c. 1100 except through the Latin translation of the Organon made by Boethius. In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, interest in Aristotle revived and Latin Christians had translations made, both from Arabic translations, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>those</b> by Gerard <b>of</b> Cremona, and from the original Greek, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>those</b> by James <b>of</b> Venice and William of Moerbeke.|$|R
5|$|They {{are likely}} to be found in valley regions that exhibit diurnal {{mountain}} wind systems, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> the dry mountain ranges of the US. Deep valleys that terminate abruptly at a plain are more impacted by these factors than are those that gradually become shallower as downvalley distance increases.|$|E
5|$|A {{mitochondrion}} contains DNA, {{which is}} organized as several {{copies of a}} single, usually circular, chromosome. This mitochondrial chromosome contains genes for redox proteins, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> the respiratory chain. The CoRR hypothesis proposes that this co-location is required for redox regulation. The mitochondrial genome codes for some RNAs of ribosomes, and the 22 tRNAs necessary for the translation of messenger RNAs into protein. The circular structure {{is also found in}} prokaryotes. The proto-mitochondrion was probably closely related to the Rickettsia. However, the exact relationship of the ancestor of mitochondria to the alphaproteobacteria and whether the mitochondrion was formed at the same time or after the nucleus, remains controversial.|$|E
5|$|According to van der Waerden's {{obituary}} of Emmy Noether, she did {{not follow}} a lesson plan for her lectures, which frustrated some students. Instead, she used her lectures as a spontaneous discussion time with her students, to think through and clarify important cutting-edge problems in mathematics. Some of her most important results were developed in these lectures, and the lecture notes of her students {{formed the basis for}} several important textbooks, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> van der Waerden and Deuring.|$|E

50|$|In Canada and the United States, {{since the}} 1930s, {{children}} have left cookies and milk {{on a table}} for Santa Claus on Christmas Eve, though many people simply consume the cookies themselves. The cookies are often cut into <b>such</b> shapes <b>as</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> candy canes, reindeer, and holly leaves.|$|R
50|$|There is a crafts center {{called the}} Casa de las artesanías. It {{exhibits}} and sells various crafts from Jalpan and surrounding municipalities <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>those</b> made <b>of</b> palm fronds, ceramics, pine needles and wood. It also includes food items <b>such</b> <b>as</b> fruit preserves, guava candies, fruit liquors, honey and regionally produced coffee.|$|R
5|$|Alpine areas, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> Kosciuszko National Park, are at {{particular}} risk; low-growing alpine flora is highly vulnerable to trampling, {{and the short}} summers mean little time for plants to grow and recover from damage. The biodiversity there is high, with 853 species of plant, 21 of which are found nowhere else. Erosion in the limestone karst areas leads to runoff and silting. Sphagnum moss {{is an important component}} of highland bogs, and is trampled by horses seeking water.|$|E
5|$|Although {{certain forms}} of dance were disapproved of at times as non-Roman or unmanly, dancing was {{embedded}} in religious rituals of archaic Rome, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> the dancing armed Salian priests and of the Arval Brothers, priesthoods which underwent a revival during the Principate. Ecstatic dancing was {{a feature of the}} international mystery religions, particularly the cult of Cybele as practised by her eunuch priests the Galli and of Isis. In the secular realm, dancing girls from Syria and Cadiz were extremely popular.|$|E
5|$|Aqueous {{solutions}} {{with normal}} water {{cannot be used}} for 1H NMR measurements but heavy water, D2O, must be used instead. 13C NMR data, however, {{can be used with}} normal water and 1H NMR spectra can be used with non-aqueous media. The quantities measured with NMR are time-averaged chemical shifts, as proton exchange is fast on the NMR time-scale. Other chemical shifts, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> 31P can be measured.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Sheridan then rose, {{and made}} a lively and eloquent speech against Mr. Burke; in which, among other things, he said that Mr. Burke had libelled the National Assembly of France, and had cast out {{reflections}} on <b>such</b> characters <b>as</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> the Marquis de La Fayette and Mr. Bailly.|$|R

60|$|It {{is a great}} {{mistake to}} think that fairies, witches, magicians, and such people lived only in Eastern {{countries}} and in <b>such</b> times <b>as</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> the Caliph Haroun Al-Raschid. Fairies and their like belong to every country and every age, and no doubt we should see plenty of them now--if we only knew how.|$|R
5|$|Black {{honeyeaters}} feed on nectar, {{and have}} a long curved bill to reach the base of tubular flowers <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> the emu bush. They also take insects on the wing, and regularly eat charcoal left behind at campfires. The male engages in a soaring song flight in the mating season, but contributes little to nest building and incubation. Both sexes feed {{and care for the}} young. While the population appears to be decreasing, the black honeyeater is sufficiently numerous and widespread to be considered least concern on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)'s Red List of Endangered species.|$|E
5|$|Demand for {{electricity}} grows with great rapidity {{as a nation}} modernises and its economy develops. The United States showed a 12% increase in demand during each year {{of the first three}} decades of the twentieth century, a rate of growth that is now being experienced by emerging economies <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> India or China. Historically, the growth rate {{for electricity}} demand has outstripped that for other forms of energy.|$|E
5|$|Enlightenment {{philosophy}} {{had developed}} Western Europeans’ interest in Greece, or rather in an idealised Ancient Greece, {{the linchpin of}} Antiquity, as it was perceived and taught. The Enlightenment philosophers, for whom the notions of Nature and Reason were so important, believed that these had been the fundamental values of Classical Athens. The Ancient Greek democracies, and above all Athens, became models to emulate. There they searched for answers to the political and philosophical problems of their time. Works <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> Abbé Barthélemy, Voyage du Jeune Anacharsis (1788), served to fix definitively the image that Europe had of the Aegean.|$|E
60|$|It was <b>such</b> legends <b>as</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> OEdipus and Adrastus, exemplifying {{the struggles}} of {{individual}} humanity against the overpowering force of circumstances and necessity, which gave to the early Greeks those same lessons which we of modern days draw, in somewhat less artistic fashion, {{from the study of}} statistics and the laws of physiology.|$|R
50|$|Another {{research}} theme {{explored by}} Taube {{is that of}} inter- and intra-regional exchanges and contacts for Mesoamerica, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> with <b>those</b> <b>of</b> Aridoamerica and the American Southwest.
