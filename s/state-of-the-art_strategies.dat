40|$|BACKGROUND: Improving hand hygiene {{compliance}} {{is still}} a major challenge for most hospitals. Innovative approaches are needed. OBJECTIVE: We tested whether an innovative, theory based, team and leaders-directed strategy {{would be more effective}} in increasing hand hygiene compliance rates in nurses than a literature based <b>state-of-the-art</b> <b>strategy.</b> DESIGN AND SETTING: A cluster randomised controlled trial called HELPING HANDS was conducted in 67 nursing wards of three hospitals in the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: All affiliated nurses of the nursing wards. Wards were randomly assigned to either the team and leaders-directed strategy (30 wards) or the <b>state-of-the-art</b> <b>strategy</b> (37 wards). METHODS: The control arm received a <b>state-of-the-art</b> <b>strategy</b> including education, reminders, feedback and targeting adequate products and facilities. The experimental group received all elements of the <b>state-of-the-art</b> <b>strategy</b> supplemented with interventions based on social influence and leadership, comprising specific team and leaders-directed activities. Strategies were delivered during a period of six months. We monitored nurses' HH compliance during routine patient care before and directly after strategy delivery, as well as six months later. Secondary outcomes were compliance with each type of hand hygiene opportunity, the presence of jewellery and whether the nurses wore long-sleeved clothes. The effects were evaluated on an intention-to-treat basis by comparing the post-strategy hand hygiene compliance rates with the baseline rates. Multilevel analysis was applied to compensate for the clustered nature of the data using mixed linear modelling techniques. RESULTS: During the study, we observed 10, 785 opportunities for appropriate hand hygiene in 2733 nurses. The compliance in the state-of-the-art group increased from 23 % to 42 % in the short term and to 46 % in the long run. The hand hygiene compliance in the team and leaders-directed group improved from 20 % to 53 % in the short term and remained 53 % in the long run. The difference between both strategies showed an Odds Ratio of 1. 64 (95 % CI 1. 33 - 2. 02) in favour of the team and leaders-directed strategy. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the added value of social influence and enhanced leadership in hand hygiene improvement strategies.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Many {{strategies}} {{have been designed}} and evaluated to address poor hand hygiene compliance. Unfortunately, well-designed economic evaluations of hand hygiene improvement strategies are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of two successful implementation strategies for improving nurses' hand hygiene compliance and reducing hospital acquired infections (HAI's). DESIGN AND SETTING: A cost-effectiveness analysis alongside a cluster randomised controlled trial was conducted in 67 nursing wards of three hospitals in the Netherlands. The evaluation used a hospital perspective. PARTICIPANTS: All affiliated nurses of the nursing wards. Wards {{were randomly assigned to}} either the control group (n= 30) or the experimental group (n= 37). METHODS: The control group received a <b>state-of-the-art</b> <b>strategy</b> including education, reminders feedback and optimising materials and facilities. The experimental group received a team and leaders-directed strategy which included all elements of the <b>state-of-the-art</b> <b>strategy</b> supplemented with interventions aimed at the social context of teams and enhancing leadership. The most efficient implementation strategy was determined by the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per extra percentage of hand hygiene compliance gained and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per additional percentage reduction in the HAI rate. Bootstrap methods were used to determine confidence intervals for these incremental cost-effectiveness ratio's. Two scenarios of 15 and 30 % were used to express the association between increased hand hygiene compliance and the reduction in HAIs. RESULTS: The team and leaders-directed strategy was significantly more effective in improving hand hygiene compliance. The mean difference effect was 8. 91 % (95 % CI, 0. 75 - 17. 06). This extra increase was achieved at an average cost of euro 5497 per ward. The incremental cost per extra percentage of hand hygiene gained on ward level was euro 622. The incremental cost per additional percentage reduction in the HAI rate on ward level was euro 2074 (30 % scenario) and euro 4125 (15 % scenario). Within the 30 % scenario, there is a probability of 90 % that the team and leaders-directed strategy is cost-effective and within the 15 % scenario, there is a probability of 70 % that the team and leaders-directed strategy is cost-effective.

40|$|Abstract Background Hand hygiene {{prescriptions}} are {{the most}} important measure in the prevention of hospital-acquired infections. Yet, compliance rates are generally below 50 % of all opportunities for hand hygiene. This study aims at evaluating the short- and long-term effects of two different strategies for promoting hand hygiene in hospital nurses. Methods/design This study is a cluster randomised controlled trial with inpatient wards as the unit of randomisation. Guidelines for hand hygiene will be implemented in this study. Two strategies will be used to improve the adherence to guidelines for hand hygiene. The <b>state-of-the-art</b> <b>strategy</b> is derived from the literature and includes education, reminders, feedback, and targeting adequate products and facilities. The extended strategy also contains activities aimed at influencing social influence in groups and enhancing leadership. The unique contribution of the extended strategy is built upon relevant behavioural science theories. The extended strategy includes all elements of the <b>state-of-the-art</b> <b>strategy</b> supplemented with gaining active commitment and initiative of ward management, modelling by informal leaders at the ward, and setting norms and targets within the team. Data will be collected at four points in time, with six-month intervals. An average of 3, 000 opportunities for hand hygiene in approximately 900 nurses will be observed at each time point. Discussion Performing and evaluating an implementation strategy that also targets the social context of teams may considerably add to the general body of knowledge in this field. Results from our study will allow us to draw conclusions on the effects of different strategies for the implementation of hand hygiene guidelines, and based on these results {{we will be able to}} define a preferred implementation strategy for hospital based nursing.

It is therefore {{important to look}} inside the 'black box' of such strategies, to ascertain which components of a strategy work well or less well. This study examined which components of two hand hygiene improvement strategies were associated with increased nurses' hand hygiene compliance. A process evaluation of a cluster randomised controlled trial was conducted in which part of the nursing wards of three hospitals in the Netherlands received a <b>state-of-the-art</b> <b>strategy,</b> including education, reminders, feedback, and optimising materials and facilities; another part received a team and leaders-directed strategy that included all elements of the <b>state-of-the-art</b> <b>strategy,</b> supplemented with activities aimed at the social and enhancing leadership. This process evaluation used four sets of measures: effects on nurses' hand hygiene compliance, adherence to the improvement strategies, contextual factors, and nurses' experiences with strategy components. Analyses of variance and multiple regression analyses were used to explore changes in nurses' hand hygiene compliance and thereby better understand trial effects. Both strategies were performed with good adherence to protocol. Two contextual factors were associated with changes in hand hygiene compliance: a hospital effect in long term (p < 0. 05), and high hand hygiene baseline scores were associated with smaller effects (p < 0. 01). In short term, changes in nurses' hand hygiene compliance were positively correlated with experienced feedback about their hand hygiene performance (p < 0. 05). In the long run, several items of the components 'social influence' (i. e., addressing each other on undesirable hand hygiene behaviour p < 0. 01), and 'leadership' (i. e., ward manager holds team members accountable for hand hygiene performance p < 0. 01) correlated positively with changes in nurses' hand hygiene compliance.
