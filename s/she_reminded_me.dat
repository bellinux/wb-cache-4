6000|$|... "Very kind of you," [...] I answered, hesitatingly. Miss Moyat was good-hearted, but {{a little}} overpowering--and in certain moods <b>she</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> of her father.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now you {{are asking}} questions," [...] <b>she</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "Believe me, you are safer, very much safer knowing nothing. If I were your friend--" ...|$|E
60|$|We {{handed it}} to her. She took two plantains, peeled and ate them with {{extraordinary}} grace. Indeed <b>she</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me,</b> I do not know why, of some lovely butterfly drawing its food from a flower.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why does <b>she</b> come? <b>She</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of the lost; <b>She</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of the dead: In her form {{like the}} other, In her walk like the other: Why does she come? ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>She</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of Paul Revere's ride. A {{little light}} in the belfry.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Cheerful, Mrs Todgers! cheerful!' {{cried the}} {{youngest}} gentleman; 'when <b>she</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of days for ever fled, Mrs Todgers!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now it's a queer thing," [...] Mr. Weatherley continued, [...] "but only yesterday--or {{was it the}} day before--I {{was trying}} to think whom <b>she</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> of. It couldn't have been my brother-in-law, could it, Chetwode. Did you ever fancy that she was like Sabatini?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Miss Jillgall looked {{shocked at}} my stupidity. <b>She</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> {{that there was}} a mystery in Mrs. Tenbruggen's letter and a mystery in papa's strange conduct toward Philip. [...] "Put two and two together, darling," [...] she said; [...] "and, one of these days, they may make four." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{kept away}} from the studio for some time after that, because it didn't seem right to me to intrude on the poor chappie's sorrow. Besides, I'm bound to say that nurse intimidated me. <b>She</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> so infernally of Aunt Agatha. She was the same gimlet-eyed type.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Very--very like her, {{a little}} darker certainly,' said Sir Edward, 'but <b>she</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of her constantly--there--that smile is my sister's exactly.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She's {{the best}} {{girl in the}} world. You can't think how good, and kind, and simple <b>she</b> is; <b>she</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> always of an English breeze." ...|$|R
5000|$|Maria is {{referenced}} in {{the chorus}} of the song [...] "Maria Maria" [...] by the band Santana:“Oh Maria, Maria / <b>She</b> <b>remind</b> <b>me</b> of a West Side story.” ...|$|R
60|$|As {{a matter}} of fact, I {{knew that he had}} had in mind the safety of her crew under javelin-fire--the lofty sides made an admirable shelter. Inside <b>she</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> of {{nothing so much as a}} {{floating}} trench. There was also some slight analogy to a huge coffin.|$|E
6000|$|... "Faith, I don't {{know why}} she was not," [...] he said. [...] "She has done enough to tire out an army. But she seems well and fairly happy. She had her joke at my expense as she went through the court-yard, and <b>she</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> that we were to send a report by Andre every day." ...|$|E
60|$|But companionable Selina {{would not}} hear of a separation. She asked, {{in her most}} irresistible manner, if I objected to driving instead of walking. Her heart's dearest wish, she said, was to make her bosom friend and myself better acquainted with each other. To conclude, <b>she</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> {{that there was a}} cab-stand in the next street.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs. Keith?" [...] he said sharply. [...] "The lady I {{saw at the}} Frontenac, {{with the}} autocratic manners? It's curious, but <b>she</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of {{somebody}} I knew, and the name's the same. I wonder----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And Nan,--I adore Nan, {{everybody}} adores Nan. <b>She</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of one {{of those}} exquisite, blue-eyed dolls her father imports. Now if I were a bachelor, Mr. Hodder--!" [...] Mrs. Constable left the rest to his imagination.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mrs. Keith?" [...] he said sharply. [...] "The lady I {{saw at the}} Frontenac {{with the}} autocratic manners and a Roman nose? It's curious, but <b>she</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of {{somebody}} I knew and the name's the same. I wonder----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your stepmother," [...] he said, [...] "was {{perfectly}} reasonable and very candid. <b>She</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> {{that you were}} a great heiress, and that as yet you had seen nothing of the world. I do not know why she thought it necessary to point this out to me, except that perhaps she thought that in some mad moment I might have conceived the idea that you--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{more than}} half asleep," [...] he laughed. [...] "I was trying to {{remember}} A Dream of Fair Women. It's a suitable occupation for a drowsy summer afternoon {{in a place like}} this, but I must confess that it was Miss Vane who put it into my head. <b>She</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> of {{one or two of the}} heroines when she was championing the cause of the suffragist." ...|$|E
6000|$|The weeks {{went by and}} {{the days}} began to lengthen. Pretty yellow flowers that I had not seen before {{appeared}} in the woods, and I ate plenty of them; they have a nice flavour. Then I met another hare and loved her, because <b>she</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> of my sister. We used to play about together and were very happy. [...] "I wonder what she will do now that I am gone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{at first}} {{refused to be}} present. To my amazement, however, Mercy sides with my aunt. <b>She</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of all that we both owe to Lady Janet; and she has persuaded me to alter my mind. We are {{to go to the}} ball--at my wife express request! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Coming in drolly {{with her}} prim dress and bearing. Though she was dreadfully frightened," [...] said Lance. [...] "Being half-foreign {{accounts}} for something, I suppose, {{but it is}} odd how <b>she</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of some one. No doubt it is of some singer at a concert. What did they say was her name?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never! It sets {{my teeth}} on edge {{to look at}} her tonight. I suppose that dress is 'a sweet thing just out,' but upon my word <b>she</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of nothing but a Harlequin ice," [...] and Mac turned his back on her with a shudder, for he was {{sensitive}} to discords of all kinds.|$|R
6000|$|That night Frances said to {{her mother}} and sister, [...] "You never saw such a transfigured face as Miss Price's when I asked her up. She looked {{positively}} pretty--such a lovely pink came out on her cheeks and her eyes shone like stars. <b>She</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> so much of somebody I've seen, but I can't think who it is. I'm so glad we've asked her here for Thanksgiving!" ...|$|E
60|$|Perhaps it was {{pleasure}} at being spoken to kindly {{at all in}} this land of strangers; perhaps it was revulsion from the agony of shame and modesty I had endured at Quebec; but, at any rate, I felt drawn at first sight to my sweet-voiced fellow-traveller. Besides, <b>she</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> somewhat of Minnie Moore, and that resemblance alone was enough to attract me. I {{looked up at her}} gratefully.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{has a nice}} face," [...] he remarked, [...] "and I should imagine {{excellent}} perceptions. Curiously enough, too, <b>she</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> of {{some one}} who has every reason to hate me. But {{to the best of}} my belief I never saw her before in my life. Lady Caroom, that weird-looking object in front of you is a teapot--and those are teacups. May I suggest a use for them?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Teena Marie also {{expressed}} her appreciation for Faith Evans, saying, [...] "I've always loved Faith and her vocal style. <b>She</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of me. Her correlation with Biggie—having a career {{with him and}} without him—reminds me of me and Rick James. I feel like she's a younger me. Of the younger ladies, she's the one I love most." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'She can't help that, poor thing,' said John: 'she is {{an admirable}} creature; indeed, <b>she</b> {{sometimes}} <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of your sister.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will explain}} the passage to Mistress Alice," [...] said the Doctor, [...] "when <b>she</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of it--or rather," [...] (he added, recollecting that his {{ordinary}} dilatory answer on such occasions {{ought not to}} be returned when the order for exposition emanated from his Sovereign,) [...] "I will repeat a poor couplet from my own translation of the poem-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{more than}} half asleep," [...] Carroll protested. [...] "I was trying to {{remember}} 'A Dream of Fair Women.' It {{struck me as a}} suitable occupation for a drowsy summer afternoon in a place like this, but I must confess that it was Miss Vane who put it into my head. <b>She</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> of {{one or two of the}} heroines not long ago, when she was championing the cause of the suffragist." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I only teased Fan a little; I {{did like}} Maria, for <b>she</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> of you sometimes, and {{was such a}} kind, cosy little woman I could n't help enjoying her society after a hard day's work. But Ned got jealous, and then I {{knew that he was}} in earnest, so I left him a clear field, and promised not to breathe a word to any one till he had got a Yes or No from his Maria." ...|$|E
60|$|Conference {{took place}} between the Magistrate and clerk {{respecting}} the charge. During conference I was evidently regarded as a much more objectionable person than the prisoner;--one giving trouble by coming there voluntarily, which the prisoner could not be accused of doing. The prisoner had been got up, since I last {{had the pleasure of}} seeing her, with a great effect of white apron and straw bonnet. <b>She</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> of an elder sister of Red Riding Hood, and I seemed to remind the sympathising Chimney Sweep by whom she was attended, of the Wolf.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{he is in}} {{love with}} her; or if he is not, he ought to be. She is such a perfect little woman of her kind. <b>She</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of a pair of old-fashioned silver sugar-tongs; you know I am very fond of sugar. And she is very nice with Mr. Brand; I have noticed that; very gentle and gracious." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Douglas," [...] she said, [...] "you don't {{understand}} Joan. I am {{not sure}} that even I, who live with her, do. <b>She</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> sometimes of those women of the French revolution. There is a light in her eyes when she speaks of you, which makes me shiver. Stay in London if you must, but pray always that chance may not bring you two together." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Our worthy hostess did not misreport me. Miss Doland {{has great}} possibilities. <b>She</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> {{somewhat}} of Matilda Devine, under whose banner I played a {{season at the}} Old Royalty in London many years ago. She has the seeds of greatness in her, but she is wasted {{in the present case}} on an insignificant part. There is only one part in the play. I allude to the one murdered by Miss Mabel Hobson." ...|$|R
