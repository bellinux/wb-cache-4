40|$|AbstractThis paper {{focuses on}} a {{technique}} for predicting <b>surface</b> <b>cracks</b> in hot free forging. These <b>surface</b> <b>cracks</b> occur at the side on which strains concentrate when a round bar is compressed by hot free forging. A final product has hardly any <b>surface</b> <b>cracks</b> because they are removed by gas scarfing. These conventional manufacturing processes have an industrial problem of low productivity with a waste of time. The suppression of the <b>surface</b> <b>cracks</b> is required. The mechanism and criteria for the <b>surface</b> <b>cracks</b> are not clear. In this paper, the mechanism of <b>surface</b> <b>cracking</b> was estimated, compared with the actual forging process. The mechanical property was evaluated by a high temperature tensile test. Various numerical simulations which changed the damage parameter (C value) were carried out. The critical value (C 1) is calculated by shape comparison between the tensile test and the numerical simulation. It is possible to predict the <b>surface</b> <b>cracking</b> in the hot forging process by using this parameter...|$|R

50|$|Horgan and Young (2000) {{produced}} {{a computer model}} to create a two-dimensional prediction of <b>surface</b> <b>crack</b> formation. It used the fact that once cracks come within a certain distance of one another {{they tend to be}} attracted to each other. Cracks also tend to turn within a particular range of angles and at some stage a surface aggregate gets to a size that no more cracking will occur. These are often characteristic of a soil and can therefore be measured in the field and used in the model. However it was not able to predict the points at which cracking starts and although random in the formation of crack pattern, in many ways, cracking of soil is often not random, but follows lines of weaknesses.|$|E

40|$|<b>Surface</b> <b>cracks</b> with {{aspect ratio}} a/ c> 1. 0 {{can occur in}} pipes {{subjected}} to corrosion attacks. There are few studies on stress intensity factors for semi-elliptical <b>surface</b> <b>cracks</b> with such high aspect ratio. With the failure rate for cast iron pipes unacceptably high {{there is a need}} to examine the accuracy of the prediction of stress intensity factors for pipes with high aspect ratio. However, little research has been undertaken on stress intensity factors with high aspect ratio. This paper attempts to develop a method to determine the stress intensity factors for pipes with high aspect ratio semi-elliptical internal <b>surface</b> <b>cracks</b> and subjected to any service load. Two analytical models are presented to determine the stress intensity factors in terms of influence coefficients. A three-dimensional finite element model is employed to derive a solution to analytical models. Based on numerical results it is found in the paper that the maximum stress intensity factor for <b>surface</b> <b>cracks</b> with high aspect ratio occurs at different point to that with low aspect ratio and hence may lead to different modes of failure. The paper concludes that the method presented in the paper can be used to determine the stress intensity factors for pipes with <b>surface</b> <b>cracks</b> of a large range of aspect ratios. This will enable more accurate prediction of the strength of pipes with various longitudinal semi-elliptical <b>surface</b> <b>cracks...</b>|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This article {{reports the}} recent {{development}} of a surface fatigue crack detection technique based {{on the use of}} surface-mount piezoelectric paint sensor. Polymer-based piezoelectric paints that can be directly deposited onto the surface of host structures are being utilized to make the sensor for <b>surface</b> <b>crack</b> detection. Because of its electromechanical coupling properties, voltage signals can be generated by the piezoelectric paint sensor when subjected to mechanical strain in its film plane. Results from recent development of the piezoelectric paint-based <b>surface</b> <b>crack</b> detection technique indicate that piezoelectric paint sensors with a special electrode design can potentially provide an effective method to detect fatigue cracks occurring in structural surfaces. A simple damage index is defined to determine the occurrence of surface cracks in a pre-specified region. However, complex sensor electrode patterns may be necessary in some cases to improve the spatial resolution of <b>surface</b> <b>crack</b> detection.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{demonstrate}} the accuracy of the sampling method in probabilistic fatigue <b>surface</b> <b>crack</b> growth analysis. A finite thickness plate with <b>surface</b> <b>crack</b> subjected to a fatigue load is considered for fracture analysis using the newly developed Probabilistic S-version Finite Element Model (ProbS-FEM).

The distribution of the initial <b>surface</b> <b>crack</b> length and depth are extracted from the fatigue tests. The accuracy and consistency between the two sampling methods are evaluated.
