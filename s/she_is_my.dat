25|$|Though the {{continuum}} of dialects varies, typical features of AAVE grammar include an implicit copula (e.g., She my sister instead of <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> sister), simplification of the possessive form (e.g., my momma sister instead of my mother's sister), and complexification of verb aspects and tenses beyond those of other English dialects (e.g., constructions like I'm a-run, I be running, etc.). Common features of the phonology include non-rhoticity (dropping the r sound {{at the end of}} syllables), metathesis (e.g., aks instead of ask), and simplification of diphthongs (e.g., eye typically sounds like ah).|$|E

In her early appearances, she maintained {{a friendship with}} George O'Malley, until developing romantic feelings towards him. Rhimes offered the insight: [...] "I love them as friends. They make good friends. We all have that friend we met in school or the gym or somewhere – we just hit it off right away. And right away there was no pretense or airs. Just pure honesty. That's Lexie and George. They’re really good friends and I can see the friendship evolving into something even greater. At least, that's what Lexie is hoping. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> kind of girl. The girl who likes the guy {{because he is a}} GOOD guy and that's what George is. He is a good guy and that's something that Lexie could use now. She's going through her own challenges what with Meredith and losing her own mother and trying to keep things afloat. I’m rooting for Lexie. She's my kind of girl and I hope that she gets what she deserves: love. And more kisses. There should always be that." [...] Lexie's most significant relationship was with Mark Sloan. Following her death, Rhimes said: ...|$|E

In her first event, the 100m Butterfly S9, she {{finished}} fourth, while South Africa's Natalie du Toit finished first. However, the following night, Cole won the 100m Backstroke S9, winning her first gold medal {{of the games}} in Australian record time. She told the press that it had [...] "been a goal of mine ever since I was 12 years old to beat Natalie du Toit" [...] who was [...] "kind of like the Michael Phelps of swimming for me, {{she has been a}} great mentor and relaxes me in the marshalling room. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> biggest hero." [...] Cole won a second gold medal in the 4 x 100m freestyle relay 34 pts, this time in World Record time. In the 400m Freestyle S9, she was again beaten by du Toit, who finished first, while Cole took bronze. Cole won a second bronze in the 50m Freestyle S9, in which du Toit finished seventh, and then gold in the 100m Freestyle S9, in which du Toit finished third. Cole capped off the games, surprising even herself with a fourth gold medal, in the 4 x 100m freestyle relay 34 pts, again in Australian record time.|$|E

2500|$|In {{a recent}} {{interview}} (ca. 2015), in Yedioth Ahronoth, Raichel was asked about this and said: [...] "If you have a daughter and someone kidnapped her, you investigate that someone and your child's life is at risk.

2500|$|Cody {{filed for}} divorce in 1904, after 38 years of marriage. This {{decision}} was made after years of jealous arguments, bad blood between {{his wife and his}} sisters, and friction between the children and their father. By 1891, Cody had instructed his brother-in-law to handle Frederici's affairs and property, stating [...] "I often feel sorry for her. She is a strange woman but I don't mind her—remember <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> wife—and let it go at that. If she gets cranky, just laugh at it, she can't help it." [...] Cody hoped to keep the divorce quiet, so as to not disrupt his show or his stage persona, but Frederici had other ideas.|$|E

2500|$|A second {{strategy}} is the correlative-clause strategy used by Hindi and other Indo-Aryan languages, {{as well as}} Bambara. This {{strategy is}} equivalent to saying [...] "Which girl you see over there, <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> daughter" [...] or [...] "Which knife I killed my friend with, the police found that knife". It is [...] "correlative" [...] because of the corresponding [...] "which ... that ..." [...] demonstratives or [...] "which ... she/he/it ..." [...] pronouns, which indicate the respective nouns being equated. Note that the shared noun can either be repeated entirely in the main clause or reduced to a pronoun. Note also {{that there is no}} need to front the shared noun in such a sentence. For example, in the second example above, Hindi would actually say something equivalent to [...] "I killed my friend with which knife, the police found that knife".|$|E

2500|$|Early next morning, Abimelech {{informed}} his {{servants of}} his dream and approached Abraham inquiring {{as to why}} he had brought such great guilt upon his kingdom. Abraham replied that he thought there was no fear of God in that place, and that they might kill him for his wife. Then Abraham defended what he had said as not being a lie at all: [...] "And yet indeed <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife." [...] Abimelech returned Sarah to Abraham, and gave him gifts of sheep, oxen, and servants; and invited him to settle wherever he pleased in Abimelech's lands. Further, Abimelech gave Abraham a thousand pieces of silver to serve as Sarah's vindication before all. Abraham then prayed for Abimelech and his household, since God had stricken the women with infertility because of the taking of Sarah.|$|E

2500|$|Having {{promised to}} return to England by the summer, Isabella reached Paris in March 1325, and rapidly agreed a truce in Gascony, under which Prince Edward, then {{thirteen}} years old, would come to France to give homage on his father's behalf. Prince Edward arrived in France, and gave homage in September. At this point, however, rather than returning, Isabella remained firmly in France with her son. Edward began to send urgent messages to the Pope and to Charles IV, expressing his concern about his wife's absence, but to no avail. For his part, Charles replied that the, [...] "queen has come of her own will and may freely return if she wishes. But if she prefers to remain here, <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> sister and I refuse to expel her." [...] Charles went on to refuse to return the lands in Aquitaine to Edward, resulting in a provisional agreement under which Edward resumed administration of the remaining English territories in early 1326 whilst France continued to occupy the rest.|$|E

6000|$|All folk {{literature}} has indeed a passion whose like {{is not in}} modern literature and music and art, except where it has come by some straight or crooked way out of ancient times. Love was held to be a fatal sickness in ancient Ireland, {{and there is a}} love-poem in The Songs of Connacht that is like a death cry: 'My love, O <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> love, the woman who is most for destroying me, dearer is she for making me ill than the woman who would be for making me well. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> treasure, O <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> treasure, the woman of the grey eyes ... a woman who would not lay a hand under my head.... <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> love, O <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> love, the woman who left no strength in me; a woman who would not breathe a sigh after me, a woman who would not raise a stone at my tomb.... <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> secret love, O <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> secret love. A woman who tells me nothing,... a woman who does not remember me to be out.... <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> choice, O <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> choice, the woman who would not look back at me, the woman who would not make peace with me.... <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> desire, O <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> desire: a woman dearest to me under the sun, a woman who would not pay me heed, if I were to sit by her side. It is she ruined my heart and left a sigh for ever in me.' There is another song that ends, 'The Erne shall be in strong flood, the hills shall be torn down, and the sea shall have red waves, and blood shall be spilled, and every mountain valley and every moor shall be on high, before you shall perish, my little black rose.' Nor do the old Irish weigh and measure their hatred. The nurse of O'Sullivan Bere in the folk song prays that the bed of his betrayer may be the red hearth-stone of hell for ever. And an Elizabethan Irish poet cries: 'Three things are waiting for my death. The devil, who is waiting for my soul and cares nothing for my body or my wealth; the worms, who are waiting for my body but care nothing for my soul or my wealth; my children, who are waiting for my wealth and care nothing for my body or my soul. O Christ, hang all three in the one noose.' Such love and hatred seek no mortal thing but their own infinity, and such love and hatred soon become love and hatred of the idea. The lover who loves so passionately can soon sing to his beloved like the lover in the poem by 'A. E.,' 'A vast desire awakes and grows into forgetfulness of thee.' ...|$|E
