25|$|In a {{study by}} Kliegel et al. (2008), it was shown that motivational <b>state</b> <b>affected</b> {{performance}} in two age groups (three-year-olds and five-year-olds) completing the same prospective memory task. There was no difference for the two age groups when motivation was high but performance of the three years old was reduced when motivation was low. If a person considers a task to be unimportant or is affected by fatigue, {{they will not be}} motivated to remember the intention. Less attention will be given to relevant cues and the memory {{is more likely to be}} forgotten. Therefore, prospective memory can be enhanced by avoiding low motivational states.|$|E
2500|$|While {{he wrote}} [...] "Eureka", Yamaguchi became sick both {{physically}} and mentally, developing hives and becoming disillusioned {{with the idea of}} writing music for other entities. The song was inspired by Yamaguchi's feelings of becoming too accustomed to making songs for others. Yamaguchi's poor mental <b>state</b> <b>affected</b> the song while he was writing it. He wrote the song's lyrics over the course of one night in Adobe Illustrator, while he sat with the curtains shut in front of his computer in his apartment, but spent much of the time revising the song. The lyrics mention , a tea meant to detoxify the body according to Japanese folk medicine, because that was what he had been drinking during that night to aid himself.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Facial mimicry is an {{automatic}} process {{that may occur}} as we see facial expression and respond congruently with a similar expression (van Baaren, Fockenberg, Holland, Janssen, & van Knippenberg, 2006). Empathy is the capacity to take on and understand another’s emotions (Hojat et al., 2002). While positive relationships between mimicry and empathy have been previously established, less is known regarding the interrelations among <b>state</b> <b>affect,</b> empathy, and facial mimicry. The present study examined these relationships in a single sample. While positive relationships were found between empathy and <b>state</b> <b>affect,</b> empathy and <b>state</b> <b>affect</b> {{did not have an}} effect on facial mimicry...|$|R

30|$|Affect {{is used as}} an {{umbrella}} term for emotions, moods, and traits (Barsade and Gibson 2007). Researchers recognize two categories of affect: trait <b>affect</b> and <b>state</b> <b>affect.</b> Trait affect reflects an individual’s tendency to produce a specific emotion across different situations, whereas <b>state</b> <b>affect</b> refers to an individual’s affect at a given point in time (Watson et al. 1988). Some scholars have argued that <b>state</b> <b>affect</b> has a more direct impact on human behavior than trait affect (Elfenbein 2007). In addition, a previous study found that positive affect was positively associated with positive behaviors, such as organizational citizenship (Shockley et al. 2012). Therefore, in this study, {{we focus on the}} positive affect and assume that it plays a critical role in linking transformational leadership to voice.|$|R

(1) No Wisconsin {{resident}} having minor issue {{not in his}} {{custody and}} which he is under obligation to support by any court order or judgment, may marry in this state or elsewhere, without the order of either the court of this state which granted such judgment or support order, or the court having divorce jurisdiction in the county of this state where such minor issue resides or where the marriage license application is made. No marriage license shall be issued to any such person except upon court order. The court, within 5 days after such permission is sought by verified petition in a special proceeding, shall direct a court hearing {{to be held in}} the matter to allow said person to submit proof of his compliance with such prior court obligation. No such order shall be granted, or hearing held, unless both parties to the intended marriage appear, and unless the person, agency, institution, welfare department or other entity having the legal or actual custody of such minor issue is given notice of such proceeding by personal service of a copy of the petition at least 5 days prior to the hearing, except that such appearance or notice may be waived by the court upon good cause shown, and, if the minor issue were of a prior marriage, unless a 5-day notice thereof is given to the family court commissioner of the county where such permission is sought, who shall attend such hearing, and to the family court commissioner of the court which granted such divorce judgment. If the divorce judgment was granted in a foreign court, service shall be made on the clerk of that court. Upon the hearing, if said person submits such proof and makes a showing that such children are not then and are not likely thereafter to become public charges, the court shall grant such order, a copy of which shall be filed in any prior proceeding under s. 52.37 or divorce action of such person in this <b>state</b> <b>affected</b> thereby; otherwise permission for a license shall be withheld until such proof is submitted and such showing is made, but any court order withholding such permission is an appealable order. Any hearing under this section may be waived by the court if the court is satisfied from an examination of the court records in the case and the family support records {{in the office of the}} clerk of court as well as from disclosure by said person of his financial resources that the latter has complied with prior court orders or judgments affecting his minor children, and also has shown that such children are not then and are not likely thereafter to become public charges. No county clerk in this state shall issue such license to any person required to comply with this section unless a certified copy of a court order permitting such marriage is filed with said county clerk.|$|E

6000|$|If I {{am right}} in these remarks, it will follow, that Dryden never {{could be a}} firm or steady believer in the Church of England's doctrines. The arguments, by which he proved them, carried him too far; and when he {{commenced}} a teacher of faith, or when, as he expresses it, [...] "his pride struck out new sparkles of its own," [...] at that very time, while in words he maintained the doctrines of his mother-church, his conviction really hovered between natural religion and the faith of Rome. It is remarkable that his friends {{do not seem to}} have considered the [...] "Religio Laici" [...] as expressive of his decided sentiments; for Charles Blount, a noted free-thinker, in consequence of that very work, wrote a deistical treatise in prose, bearing the same title, and ascribed it with great testimony of respect to [...] "his much-honoured friend, John Dryden, Esquire."[3] Mr. Blount, living in close habits with Dryden, must have known perfectly well how to understand his polemical poem; and, had he supposed it was written under a deep belief of the truth of the English creed, can it be thought he would have inscribed to the author a tract against all revelation?[4] The inference is, therefore, sufficiently plain, that the dedicator knew that Dryden was sceptical on the subject, on which he had, out of compliment to Church and <b>State,</b> <b>affected</b> a conviction; and that his [...] "Religio Laici" [...] no more inferred a belief in the doctrines of Christianity, than the sacrifice of a cock to Esculapius proved the heathen philosopher's faith in the existence of that divine leech. Thus far Dryden had certainly proceeded. His disposition to believe in Christianity was obvious, but he was bewildered in the maze of doubt in which he was involved; and it was already plain, that the Church, whose promises to illuminate him were most confident, was likely to have the honour of this distinguished proselyte. Dryden did not, therefore, except in outward profession, abandon the Church of England for that of Rome, but was converted to the Catholic faith from a state of infidelity, or rather of Pyrrhonism. This is made more clear by the words of Dryden, from which it appears that, having once admitted the mysterious doctrines of the Trinity and of redemption, so incomprehensible to human reason, he felt no right to make any further appeal to that fallible guide: ...|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} {{designed}} to examine the impact of <b>affect</b> as a <b>state</b> (positive <b>affect</b> <b>state</b> and negative <b>affect</b> <b>state)</b> and <b>affect</b> as a trait (positive affect trait and negative affect trait) on organizational citizenship behavior intentions. It was hypothesized that positive <b>affect</b> <b>state</b> and negative <b>affect</b> <b>state</b> would be significant predictors of OCB intentions after controlling for positive and negative affect trait respectively. It was also hypothesized that positive and negative affect trait would be significantly correlated with positive and negative <b>affect</b> <b>state</b> respectively and would thus be related to OCB intentions. 100 respondents employed in various organizations in the United States participated in a web-based survey as part of the study. The results showed that positive <b>affect</b> <b>state</b> accounted for significant variance in OCB intentions after controlling for positive trait and that positive and negative affect trait were significantly correlated with positive and negative <b>affect</b> <b>state</b> respectively. However, negative <b>affect</b> <b>state</b> did not account for significant variance in OCB intentions after controlling for negative affect trait...|$|R
