5|$|Double hulls {{have become}} {{popular in the}} past ten years. Designing a vessel with double <b>sides</b> adds {{primarily}} to its breadth, since bulkers are already required to have double bottoms. One of the advantages of the double hull is to make room to place all the structural elements in the <b>sides,</b> removing them from the holds. This increases the volume of the holds, and simplifies their structure which helps in loading, unloading, and cleaning. Double <b>sides</b> also improve a ship's capacity for ballasting, which is useful when carrying light goods: the ship may have to increase its draft for stability or seakeeping reasons, which is done by adding ballast water.|$|E

5|$|For {{internal}} broaching the <b>sides</b> of the broach are drafted inward so it becomes thinner; for external broaching the <b>sides</b> are drafted outward, {{to make the}} pocket bigger. This draft keeps the broach from jamming; the draft must be larger than the angle of misalignment. If the work piece rotates, the broach is pressed against it, is driven by it, and rotates synchronously with it.

5|$|Hot Jupiters, due {{to their}} extreme proximities to their host stars, {{have been shown to}} be losing their atmospheres into space due to stellar radiation, much like the tails of comets.

Between 10 and 20µm wide, these grooves indicate that hair moved repeatedly across the teeth.
