Impact on the exports of textile (the top exports of Pakistan to the CPTPP region) is also positive and modest (33 %).

On the other hand, the exports of ‘meat and livestock’ and grain crops show decrease due to the extended CPTPP.

The elasticities are always significantly different from conventional macroeconomic estimates. Across 29 countries, they range from - 2. 1 to - 6. 6, with lowest values in China and India.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{more carefully}} {{the evidence from}} traded prices (as proxied by unit values) concerning the transmission {{of the effects of}} globalisation to domestic labour markets. Using standard index number techniques we decompose changes in <b>sectoral</b> <b>import</b> and export unit values into movements due to changes in pure prices of the initial bundle of goods and changes due to upgrading of the bundle imported. Looking at the imports of selected European countries of textiles, clothing and footwear relative to engineering products we find evidence of strongly falling pure prices of the unskilled intensive products relative to the skilled products in the 1980 s. This reinforces the view that import prices capture the impact of globalisation in terms of adverse relative price movements for products produced with the intensive use of unskilled labour. However, the trends are not common across all the unskilled sectors; footwear is clearly an exception. In the absence of detailed domestic data, we look for reactions b...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims to {{investigate}} the relationship between trade flows and transport costs. In previous studies the cost of transport was considered as an exogenous variable. However, an expanding volume of trade also reduces the unit cost of transport and, therefore, the causal relationship between trade and transport costs may be operating in both directions. A transport-costs equation is estimated using data on transportation costs from the International Transport Data Base (BTI). The relationship between transport costs and trade is then analysed by applying a gravity model for <b>sectoral</b> <b>imports</b> for five Latin American Countries from the European Union. We investigate the endogeneity of the transport cost and trade variables by estimating simultaneously both equations. Our results show that, while higher distance and poor importer's infrastructure notably increase transport costs, a higher volume of trade has the opposite effect. Moreover, trade is significantly deterred by higher transport costs and fostered by cultural similarities. Transport costs, trade, infrastructure, imports sectors,...|$|R

40|$|With large {{shares in}} global trade and carbon emissions, China's {{international}} trade {{is supposed to}} be significantly affected by the proposed carbon-based border tax adjustments (BTAs). This paper examines the impacts of BTAs imposed by the USA and EU on China's international trade, based on a multi-sector dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. The simulation results suggest that BTAs would {{have a negative impact on}} China's international trade in terms of large losses in both exports and imports. As an additional border tariff, BTAs will directly affect China's exports by cutting down exports price level, whereas Chinese exporting enterprises will accordingly modify their strategies, significantly shifting from exports to domestic markets and from regions with BTAs policies towards other regions without them. Moreover, BTAs will affect China's total <b>imports</b> and <b>sectoral</b> <b>import</b> through influencing the whole economy in an indirect but more intricate way. Furthermore, the simulation results for coping policies indicate that enhancing China's power in world price determination and improving energy technology efficiency will effectively help mitigate the damages caused by BTAs...|$|R
40|$|We {{estimate}} {{the effect of}} exchange rate movements on firm-level wages, using a representative panel of Italian manufacturing firms. We show that the direction and size of wage adjustment is shaped by the international exposure of each firm on both the sale and cost side of the balance sheet, similar to the response of employment documented in (Nucci and Pozzolo, Journal of International Economics 2010; 82 : 112.). Through the revenue side, wages tend to rise after a currency depreciation and the effect is more pronounced the higher is the firm's exposure to sales from exports. Through the expenditure side, a depreciation induces {{a cut in the}} firm's wages, and the effect is larger the higher is the incidence of imported inputs in total production costs. For a given degree of external orientation, both these effects are larger for firms with a lower market power.
