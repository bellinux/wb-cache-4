40|$|Research takes a {{title of}} “Evaluation of Quality Cost To Assess The Performance of Production Division at CV. SSA Malang” The {{objective}} of research seems {{to acknowledge the}} quality costs including prevention cost, detection/appraisal cost, internal failure cost, and external failure cost, which all become important to identify the opportunity of profit achievement and cost thrift. Research also attempts to understand the performance of production division as the yardstick of success rate of CV. SSA Plastik Malang, to motivate employee in pursuing for organization objective and to meet behavior standards such as management policy or formal plan <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> to give favorably expected conduct and result. In this research, the author proposes two hypotheses. It may {{be said that the}} application of quality cost in the production division will effectively reduce the production quality failure and improve the company profit. The analysis tool used to observe whether the application of quality cost in the production division effectively reduces the production quality failure and influences management performance supposes to be Quality Cost Percentage based on qualitative data. Research benefits can especially be used by the company through quality costing to improve managerial planning, monitoring, and decision making for the next future. Taking account this discussion, it may be elaborated that the company may increase its market share through quality satisfaction. It builds up the superiority of price and customer value. The greater quality warranted by large market share means the certainty of profit. The information of quality cost ascertains the profit opportunity. Work achievement will be considered as favorable when the production cost budget must be equal to its realization. The last step possibly taken should be to evaluate the Quality Cost Percentage method: by comparing the obtained actual thrift with the early stated objective; and by repressing the wasteful raw material, raw material stock, packing process, work movement, and transportation. The measurement of financial-based quality cost represents a method with smaller step to increase its capability of application at every business unit. Results of evaluation indicate that CV. SSA Plastik Malang successfully reduces the cost and improves the company efficiency...|$|E
40|$|The Victorian premier’s {{performance}} on {{education is not}} bad. It’s just not top class, either, according to David Hayward I KNOW Steve Bracks well enough to realise that he’s got to be severely provoked before he loses his cool. His terse rejoinder to the Age’sKenneth Davidson (‘How my government has rebuilt state education’, 19 September) {{tells me that he}} has been wronged. But what if Davidson is not to blame? Davidson argued (‘Bracks has pulled a swifty over education funding’) that education dollars have been falling in real terms in recent times, but the budget papers are so crook these days you would need a degree to work it out. Bracks reckons that Davidson got his numbers wrong ‘again’ because ideology has blinded him to the facts. Labor has invested an ‘additional 3. 7 billion’ in education and there are 4000 extra staff to prove it, not to mention falling student-teacher ratios, and lots of new schools as well as refurbished ones in which our kids are now taught. All this sounds compelling, but maybe things are more complex than the premier would allow? There’s certainly something fishy going on, for Bracks’s numbers don’t add up. At November’s state election, Labor claimed it had put ‘more than 2. 75 billion back into Victoria’s education system’. Yet the budget papers show that education expenses climbed by only 1. 2 billion (budget paper No. 2, page 297) during Labor’s first term, or a little over half that if we adjust for inflation. Bracks now reckons his government is spending 3. 7 billion more. In the one budget since the election, Labor announced new output and investment initiatives worth only 189 million for the next financial year. So where is the missing 800 million? Maybe it’s money that has not been spent yet. The budget these days shows the cost of new initiatives {{over the next four years}} and it’s the total cost the government quotes when it informs us of its generosity. Thus the latest budget injects 2. 4 million into principals’ professional development, but in reality this is an annual 600, 000 that has been multiplied by four. And while some initiatives take full effect immediately, others don’t kick in for some time down the track. Thus, while 82 million is to be spent on 450 new secondary teachers, only 4. 5 million is earmarked for the present financial year, and the big dollars won’t flow till 2005. What all this means is that Bracks’s 3. 7 billion as well as the 2. 75 billion touted at the last election perhaps owe more to double counting than they do to reality. In addition, they include depreciation and a fictional ‘capital asset charge’, in which Treasury gives each department an amount of money equivalent to its annual cost of capital, which is then promptly returned to Treasury in full. To these ‘fictional’ sums must be added superannuation expenses, which have no bearing on day-to-day running costs of schools. For those interested in cash flows over time, or real spending trends by function, the budget papers these days are of no use. These crucial figures have not been published since the 1990 s, when Alan Stockdale decided Victorians should no longer be troubled with this sort of basic information. The only way to solve this problem is to focus on cash spent on salaries and supplies, which are <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> papers, but only for the past two years. This is what Davidson did - and they show that real education spending is declining. But one need not go to these lengths to show that education has not fared all that well. However they are measured, education expenses this year will account for a smaller share of Victoria’s economy than they did in Jeff Kennett 2 ̆ 7 s last year, and all the other states will spend more of their income on education than we will, except probably NSW. While Bracks is right to say that ‘Victoria 2 ̆ 7 s proportion of recurrent expenditure devoted to employing teachers is significantly above the national average’, that’s not something that Labor should necessarily treat with pride. It means we underspend on curriculum development and renewal, to the long-term detriment of our education system. This is about to worsen, for 300 poor souls in head office are about to be made redundant courtesy of budget cuts announced last May, taking staff numbers there back to levels not seen since 1999. What about teacher numbers? While 3000 more teachers have been employed, there are still almost 3000 fewer than there were when Kennett started sacking them way back in 1993. This is not to say that Labor’s education record is bad. It’s just not a top-class effort, which is what Bracks would seem to believe. But premiers are busy people and they depend on others for advice. Our normally good-natured premier might do well to have a word with those whose rubbery numbers got him fired up enough to have an unnecessary scrap with the bearer of some uncomfortable news.

As <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rural northern communities, the forests are available for Combined Heat and Power (CHP) projects. The CHP technology is well established in Europe, {{and it would be}} beneficial for Canada to become business partners with the CHP manufacturers to ensure the knowledge and expertise is established in British Columbia (BC). Based on this project, the CHP system is most appropriate when the unit is producing enough heat and power for the facility rather than to establish a large CHP for selling the surplus power to BC Hydro. The BC Hydro bioenergy rates are not high enough for building a strong business case for CHP at a smaller scale. The rates for BC Hydro are a driver for CHP, if the project is built based on present energy prices the renewable energy based projects are more costly than fossil fuel burning energy systems. As <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> capital <b>budgeting</b> calculations, <b>the</b> smaller BG 25 has a greater chance of success due to the lower costs for the initial investment and the lower operating costs.

30|$|A further {{weakness}} of applying traditional greedy seeding based on G' is exposed in Fig.  5. Figure 5 replicates our OAS_mg larger-communities experiment from Fig.  4 but with OAS_tg. Our experimental budget-selection criteria until {{now is that}} b should allow the planner to achieve a full cascade in G' for 98 %+ of samples for G'. Because traditional greedy is so inefficient in seeding highly clustered networks with high thresholds, as <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> Fig.  5 <b>the</b> <b>budgets</b> chosen for larger fractional thresholds are much larger than under modified greedy seeding (see contrast with Fig.  4 for the same small-world network).

40|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> past decade, parliaments have <b>shown</b> {{increasing}} activism <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> {{process by}} demanding {{more information about}} <b>the</b> government's performance <b>in</b> managing public resources. Nevertheless, in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), parliaments face important challenges, taking an effective part <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> process and <b>in</b> fiscal policy management. Their capacity to influence budgetary matters and more generally fiscal policy and public financial management is hindered {{not only by the}} centralized nature of <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> process, but also by the lack of technical and institutional capacity of parliaments themselves to exercise their budgetary powers. This policy brief argues that the creation of parliamentary budget offices (PBOs) can help strengthen their effectiveness and accountability in budget processes. Several countries <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region have created or are considering creating this type of mechanism. These offices can help strengthen the parliament as a competent and constructive partner with the finance ministries and compensate for the legislature's limited technical capacity and credibility in budget matters through a series of effects, including reducing asymmetries in fiscal information; simplifying fiscal information and improving <b>the</b> quality of <b>budget</b> analysis; enabling a more constructive budget debate, and improving the alignment of incentives among government branches. This paper analyzes the conditions for creating and maintaining these offices, evaluates the effectiveness of such institutional changes, and weighs the lessons learned from recent experiences in various countries of the region. The conclusion is that parliaments can strengthen their impact on <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> process not necessarily by increasing their budgetary powers, but by improving their institutional capacity to exercise those powers more effectively and responsibly. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{afforestation}} of upland areas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UK {{has been}} the largest rural land use change this century. As a consequence of afforestation the bed load yields of upland catchments {{have been shown to}} increase substantially. The upland catchment bed load is transported downstream, through the transfer zone to the lowland reaches where it may enter storage in barforms, cause flow diversion and cause channel instability. This study investigates the Afon Trannon, a river in mid-Wales whose upland catchment was afforested between 1948 and 1978 and whose lowland channel is currently unstable. Historical rates of channel change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lowland channel have been quantified using aerial photogrammetry in ERDAS Imagine GIS. Channel instability is shown to increase significantly between 1963 and 1976, some 15 years after upland catchment afforestation. However, upland catchment bed load yields are shown to be of low magnitude (up to an estimated maximum of 6. 35 t km- 2 yr") and incapable of producing the high medium-term lowland channel change rates observed (up to 1. 88 m yr" between 1963 and 1976). Contemporary channel DTMs constructed from field survey data have allowed the construction of a contemporary lowland channel sediment budget. Local inputs of bed load from composite bank erosion are <b>shown</b> to dominate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> and reaches of maximum instability are shown to correspond with the location of these composite banks. Additionally. flood magnitude and frequency are shown to have increased since 1988 from a maximum stage of 1. 50 m between 1969 and 1988 to a maximum stage of 2. 23 m between 1989 and 2000. A conceptual model is presented <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> medium-term instability of the lowland Afon Trannon is suggested to be triggered by local lowland bed aggradation as a result of elevated upland catchment bed load yields and a risk assessment diagram provides advice to river engineers and fluvial geomorphologists interested <b>in</b> assessing <b>the</b> potential stability of lowland rivers whose upland catchments have been afforested...|$|R
