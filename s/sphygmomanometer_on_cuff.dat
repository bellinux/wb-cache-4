5000|$|The {{main goal}} is to produce a more gradual and gentler stall onset, without any spin {{departure}} tendency, particularly where the original wing has a sharp/asymmetric stall behaviour [...] with a passive, non-moving, low-cost device {{that would have a}} minimal impact on performance.

40|$|Context: Closed kinetic chain {{exercises}} {{are reported to}} provide a more functional rehabilitation outcome. Objective: To determine the amount of muscle activity in 4 shoulder muscles during exercise <b>on</b> the <b>Cuff</b> Link. Design: Repeated measures. Setting: Laboratory. Subjects: 10 men and 10 women, age 18 - 50. Intervention: Subjects performed 3 sets of 5 revolutions <b>on</b> the <b>Cuff</b> Link in non-weight-bearing, partial-weight-bearing, and full-weight-bearing positions. Main Outcome Measures: Electromyography data were collected from the upper trapezius, anterior deltoid, serratus anterior, and pectoralis major and were expressed as percentage of maximal isometric contractions. Results: Significant differences were found across the weight-bearing conditions for all 4 muscles. Exercise <b>on</b> the <b>Cuff</b> Link required minimal to significant amounts of muscle recruitment. Conclusions: Muscle recruitment increases as weight bearing increases during use of the Cuff Link, suggesting an increase in dynamic stabilization of the glenohumeral joint...|$|R

50|$|The designs {{continued}} the tradition established at Jane & Jane. Muir used the best quality fabrics, working in silk, cashmere, jersey and crepe, {{with a focus}} on form and fluidity. She made coats and jackets from soft leather and supple suede. Muir rarely used printed textiles, and avoided unnecessary decoration. Where she used decoration, it was integral to the garment, such as pintucking, decorative but functional buttons or rows of parallel topstitching <b>on</b> <b>cuffs</b> or collars for reinforcement. During the 1980s, Muir sometimes decorated clothing with sequins.|$|R
40|$|Self-monitoring {{of blood}} {{pressure}} may give a truer estimate of usual blood pressure than readings {{by a doctor}} in the surgery, and may save time for health professionals. This study aimed to determine the accuracy of self-monitoring in the surgery using a wrist oscillometric sphygmomanometer (Omron RX). One hundred and seventy-three patients were taught to record their own blood pressure with the Omron RX. One hundred and nineteen patients recorded three self-measurements at monthly intervals, and their readings were {{compared with those of}} an experienced nurse using the Omron RX and a mercury <b>sphygmomanometer.</b> <b>On</b> average, patients' readings were higher than the nurse's readings (mean difference in phase 1 = systolic pressure 4. 7 +/- 13. 1 mmHg, diastolic pressure 2. 7 +/- 9. 3 mmHg [both P < 0. 001]). Only half of the patients' readings were within 10 mmHg systolic and 5 mmHg diastolic of the nurse's readings. The readings by the nurse using both devices did not differ...|$|R
