40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} whether greater social <b>support</b> and <b>support</b> <b>network</b> are cross-sectionally associated with less functional limitations and psychological distress {{in patients with}} early rheumatoid arthritis (RA); whether this association is constant over time; and whether increases in social <b>support</b> or <b>support</b> <b>network</b> are associated with less functional limitations and psychological distress. METHODS: Subjects were from the European Research on Incapacitating Diseases and Social Support cohort and had early RA. Social <b>support,</b> <b>support</b> <b>network,</b> functional limitations (Health Assessment Questionnaire), and psychological distress (General Health Questionnaire) were assessed annually. Variance and covariance analyses with repeated measures were performed. RESULTS: A total of 542 subjects were assessed for 3 years. On average, patients with a greater amount of specific social support or a stronger specific <b>support</b> <b>network</b> experienced less functional limitation and less psychological distress. Changes in a given subject's functional limitations and psychological distress did not depend {{on his or her}} baseline social <b>support</b> or <b>support</b> <b>network.</b> Neither social <b>support</b> nor <b>support</b> <b>network</b> change over time. CONCLUSION: There may be a cross-sectional link between specific social <b>support</b> or <b>support</b> <b>network</b> and functional limitations and psychological distress, but no longitudinal association could be evidence...|$|R

The couple established the foundation's first single-teacher school in Gumla in Jharkhand (then a part of Bihar). The movement was successful within two years and, in 1989, 60 single-teacher schools were started simultaneously in Dhanbad. By 1995–1996, the foundation was running 1,200 schools in Jharkhand.

25|$|A common {{aspect of}} {{recovery}} {{is said to}} be the presence of others who believe in the person's potential to recover, and who stand by them. While mental health professionals can offer a particular limited kind of relationship and help foster hope, relationships with friends, family and the community are said to often be of wider and longer-term importance. Others who have experienced similar difficulties, who may be on a journey of recovery, can be of particular importance. Those who share the same values and outlooks more generally (not just in the area of mental health) may also be particularly important. It is said that one-way relationships based on being helped can actually be devaluing, and that reciprocal relationships and mutual <b>support</b> <b>networks</b> can be of more value to self-esteem and recovery.|$|E
25|$|Humanitarian {{support and}} welfare were {{provided}} by various agencies, in particular the New Zealand Red Cross and the Salvation Army. Welfare Centres and <b>support</b> <b>networks</b> were established throughout the city. Government Departments, such as WINZ and Housing New Zealand established contact with {{as many people as}} possible and provided grants and assistance. Many church and community-led projects also became established. The scale of the disaster meant many people went some days without official contact, so neighbourhoods and streets were encouraged to attend to those around them. Official visitation teams were organised by Civil Defence, with aim of visiting every household; the teams, which assessed homes and welfare needs, and passed on official information, included structural engineers or assessors from EQC. The primarily wilderness all-volunteer search and rescue organisation, LandSAR, deployed 530 people to the city to perform welfare checks. Over the course of a week, LandSAR teams visited 67,000 premises.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between parental attitudes and a child’s self-concept is crucial during the preschool years. It {{has been reported}} that elevated stress levels in mothers correlated with reduced social skills in their children. Strong parent <b>support</b> <b>networks</b> may help to prevent the development of negative self-concept in children with cleft palate. In the later preschool and early elementary years, the development of social skills is no longer only impacted by parental attitudes but is beginning to be shaped by their peers. A cleft lip or cleft palate may affect the behavior of preschoolers. Experts suggest that parents discuss with their children ways to handle negative social situations related to their cleft lip or cleft palate. A child who is entering school should learn the proper (and age-appropriate) terms related to the cleft. The ability to confidently explain the condition to others may limit feelings of awkwardness and embarrassment and reduce negative social experiences.|$|E

25|$|In October 1987 the Guildford branch {{circulated}} {{an internal}} discussion document {{arguing that the}} growing socialist movement would have a profound economic impact on the operation of capitalism before {{the overthrow of the}} capitalist class and the formal establishment of socialism. They claimed that socialists would use their influence politically (through the legislature and local councils) to adjust patterns of state income and expenditure in ‘socialistic’ directions, including the provision of free services. Drawing inspiration from writers like André Gorz, they also claimed that socialists would be encouraging the growth of the non-monetary, voluntary sector of the economy and should be instrumental in developing <b>support</b> <b>networks</b> for co-operatives and LETS schemes. This critique of the Party's revolutionary strategy was vigorously rebutted in other circulars from branches and members and at Party conference. A small number of proponents of the Guildford perspective resigned. They went on to publish the journal Spanner, so-called because it aimed to ‘span’ opinion across the non-market socialist sector of political thought, and in recent years some have been instrumental in founding the small World In Common group.|$|E

Although other abolitionists like Frederick Douglass and William Lloyd Garrison did not endorse his tactics, Brown dreamed of fighting {{to create a new}} state for freed slaves, and made preparations for military action. After he began the first battle, he believed, slaves would rise up and carry out a rebellion across the south. He asked Tubman to gather former slaves then living in present-day Southern Ontario who might be willing to join his fighting force, which she did.|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the association between}} the number of personal ties (or the size of the social <b>support</b> <b>network)</b> and the incidence of osteoporosis among older women in Korea. Data from the Korean Urban Rural Elderly Study were used. Bone density was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at the lumbar spine (L 1 -L 4) and femur neck. T-score, the standardized bone density compared with what is normally expected in a healthy young adult, was measured and the presence of osteoporosis was determined, if the T-score was < - 2. 5. The social <b>support</b> <b>network</b> size was measured by self-responses (number of confidants and spouse). Of the 1, 846 participants, 44. 9 % were diagnosed with osteoporosis. The association between the social <b>support</b> <b>network</b> size and the incidence of osteoporosis was curvilinear in both bivariate and multivariate analyses. Having more people in one's social <b>support</b> <b>network</b> size was associated with lower risk of osteoporosis until it reached around four. Increasing the social <b>support</b> <b>network</b> size beyond four, in contrast, was associated with a higher risk of osteoporosis. This association was contingent on the average intimacy level of the social network. At the highest average intimacy level ("extremely close"), increasing the number of social <b>support</b> <b>network</b> members from one to six was associated with linear decrease in the predicted probability of osteoporosis from 45 % to 30 %. However, at the lowest average intimacy level ("not very close"), the predicted probability of osteoporosis dramatically increased from 48 % to 80 % as the size of the social network increased from one to six. Our results show that maintaining a large and intimate social <b>support</b> <b>network</b> is associated with a lower risk of osteoporosis among elderly Korean women, while a large but less-intimate social relationship is associated with a higher risk...|$|R
