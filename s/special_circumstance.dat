25|$|On July 7, 2010, Lonnie David Franklin Jr., 57, was arrested. The Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office {{charged him}} with ten counts of murder, one count of {{attempted}} murder, and <b>special</b> <b>circumstance</b> allegations of multiple murders in the case. Franklin has been in jail since his arrest awaiting trial; the large volume of evidence in this case, some dating back thirty years, had caused a lengthy pretrial discovery.|$|E
25|$|His {{role in the}} Romanian context was {{likened to}} those of Honoré de Balzac in France, Charles Dickens in the United Kingdom, and Nikolai Gogol in the Russian Empire. Literary critic Pompiliu Constantinescu {{credited}} Caragiale's sense of irony with having corrected the tendencies of his day, and, through this, with helping create an urban literature. Caragiale's interest in Realism was however denied by some of his Junimist advocates, who attempted to link his entire work with Maiorescu's guidelines: {{on the basis of}} Schopenhauerian aesthetics, critic Mihail Dragomirescu postulated that his humor was pure, and did not draw on any <b>special</b> <b>circumstance</b> or context.|$|E

2500|$|The {{antitrust}} claims {{led to a}} lengthier discussion.

2500|$|Historically, {{insanity}} {{was seen}} as grounds for leniency. In pre-Norman times in England there was no distinct criminal code– a murderer could pay compensation to the victim's family under the principle of [...] "buy off the spear or bear it". The insane person's family were expected to pay any compensation and look after. In Norman times insanity was not seen as a defence in itself but a <b>special</b> <b>circumstance</b> in which the jury would deliver a guilty verdict and refer the defendant to the King for a pardon ...|$|E

2500|$|On 29 January 2001 the California Court of Appeal {{ruled that}} [...] "In order to warrant reversal, {{it must be}} {{determined}} that the alleged misconduct has prejudiced appellants’ right to a fair trial. In this case, the evidence against appellants was overwhelming." [...] The Court affirmed the convictions and sentencing of Jason Holland, Brandon Hein and Micah Holland. [...] The <b>special</b> <b>circumstance</b> finding against Anthony Miliotti, who stood and watched, was struck from the record and his crime reduced to second-degree murder, and his case {{sent back to the}} trial court for resentencing, resulting in a new sentence of nineteen years to life.|$|E

2500|$|Even absent {{that recent}} reaffirmance, Wilko {{would have made}} the same point on its own. [...] "The Court's misreading is {{possible}} because, while extolling the policies of the Arbitration Act, it is insensitive to, and disregards the policies of, the Securities Act." [...] Blackmun reminded his colleagues that it was passed eight years after the FAA specifically meant to protect investors in the wake of abuses uncovered after the 1929 stock market crash that, many believed at the time, had brought on the Great Depression. Its primary policy goal had been investor protection. [...] "Accordingly, the Court seriously errs when it states that the result in Wilko turned only on the perceived inadequacy of arbitration for the enforcement of [...] claims" [...] since that had been preceded by a lengthy reiteration of the purposes of the statute, which then led to whether mandatory arbitration served those purposes. Nor had Scherk led to a re-examination of the question as the majority had suggested, since the case was distinguished from Wilko by its international nature, a <b>special</b> <b>circumstance.</b>|$|E
