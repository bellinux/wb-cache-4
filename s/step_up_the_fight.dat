50|$|Though the Cayman Islands are {{involved}} in no major international disputes, they have come under some criticism due {{to the use of}} their territory for narcotics trafficking and money laundering. In an attempt to address this, the Government entered into the Narcotics Agreement of 1984 and the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty of 1986 with the United States, {{in order to reduce the}} use of their facilities associated with these activities. In more recent years, they have <b>stepped</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>fight</b> against money laundering, by limiting banking secrecy, introducing requirements for customer identification and record keeping, and requiring banks to cooperate with foreign investigators.|$|R

5000|$|On February 12, 2012, Comrade Artemio {{was found}} badly wounded after a clash with troops {{in a remote}} jungle region of Peru.

President Humala has stated that he would now <b>step</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>fight</b> against the {{remaining}} bands of Shining Path rebels in the Ene-Apurímac valley. On March 3, Walter Diaz, the lead candidate to succeed Artemio, was captured, further ensuring the disintegration of the Alto Huallaga valley faction.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, policy makers, {{academics}} and activists have looked into solutions {{within the realm}} of technology as a means of <b>stepping</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>fight</b> against human trafficking while ensuring a high level of protection of the victims. Even though different types of technology might be effective in the context of crime prevention, investigation or prosecution (whether national or transnational) and victim protection, such processes inevitably raise significant concerns particularly in relation to privacy and data protection. This article aims to offer an introduction to these challenges in order to trigger a much-needed dialogue in this regard. After outlining key terms and main provisions concerning privacy and data protection, the present article then explores three ways in which technological developments can contribute to combatting human trafficking – location tracking, data collection and drones –, through these it highlights the respective privacy and data protection concerns and attempts to offer ways forward...|$|R

50|$|Jordan Anti-Corruption Commission (JACC) was {{established}} {{as an independent}} commission when His Majesty King Abdullah II <b>stepped</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>fight</b> against corruption and directed the government to establish an independent body to coordinate with concerned authorities in the drafting and implementation of a general strategy to fight and prevent corruption, also {{in compliance with the}} requirements of the United Nations Convention against corruption, which was signed by Jordan on October 31st, 2003, approved by Law No. (28) for the year 2004 and published in the official gazette no. 4669; the ratification notification was deposited thereof to the Secretary-General of the United Nations. As a result, the Anti-Corruption Commission Law No. (62) for the year 2006 was issued and defined its objectives, tasks and authorities, and corruption acts; the law was amended by Law No. (10) for the year 2012 and was published in the official gazette no. 5151. The new amendments contained many legal articles about the protection of witnesses and experts and whistleblowers in corruption cases, in addition to granting JACC the authority to ask for annulation or rescindment of any contract or agreement or privilege obtained as a result of corruption offences, as well as cooperating in providing and requesting international legal assistance; the amendments excluded the public right of litigation and punishment and the recovery of proceeds of corruption from the statute of limitations. Later in 2014, the law was again amended by law No. (16) for the year 2014 and was published in the official gazette no. 5278. The amendments added three more crimes to those deemed as corruption in the JACC law which included money laundering, illicit enrichment, not declaring or not disclosing of investments or properties or benefits that may lead to conflict of interest if laws and regulations require that, of which personal benefits can be directly or indirectly gained for those who refrained from declaring or disclosing.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, the European Union {{has come}} to view cyber security, and in particular, cyber crime {{as one of the}} most {{relevant}} challenges to the completion of its Area of Freedom, Security and Justice. Given European societies’ increased reliance on borderless and decentralized information technologies, this sector of activity has been identified as an easy target for actors such as organised criminals, hacktivists or terrorist networks. Such analysis has been accompanied by EU calls to <b>step</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>fight</b> against unlawful online activities, namely through increased cooperation among law enforcement authorities (both national and extra- communitarian), the approximation of legislations, and public- private partnerships. Although EU initiatives in this field have, so far, been characterized by a lack of interconnection and an integrated strategy, there has been, since the mid- 2000 s, an attempt to develop a more cohesive and coordinated policy. An important part of this policy is connected to the activities of Europol, which have come to assume a central role in the coordination of intelligence gathering and analysis of cyber crime. The European Cybercrime Center (EC 3), which will become operational within Europol in January 2013, is regarded, in particular, as a focal point of the EU’s fight against this phenomenon. Bearing this background in mind, the present article wishes to understand the role of Europol in the development of a European policy to counter the illegal use of the internet. The article proposes to reach this objective by analyzing, through the theoretical lenses of experimental governance, the evolution of this agency’s activities in the area of cyber crime and cyber security, its positioning as an expert in the field, and the consequences for the way this policy is currently developing and is expected to develop in the near future...|$|E

40|$|Metabolic {{regulation}} by nucleotides {{has been}} examined in several bacteria {{within the context}} of the adenylate energy charge (EC) concept. The ECs of bacteria capable of only fermentative metabolism (Streptococcus lactis and the ATPase-less mutant Escherichia coli AN 718) fell to less than 0. 2 under carbon-limiting conditions, but the bacteria were able to <b>step</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> EC to greater than 0. 8 upon exposure to nutrient sugars. Similarly, nongrowing E. coli 25922, whose EC had been artificially lowered to less than 0. 1 by the addition of the protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), was able to immediately <b>step</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> EC to 0. 8 to 0. 9 upon the addition of glucose but was unable to respond to respiratory substrates. The EC of respiring bacteria (E. coli 25922 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 27853) fell to 0. 3 to 0. 4 under certain limiting growth conditions, but the bacteria also responded immediately when challenged with succinate to give EC values greater than 0. 8. These bacteria could not <b>step</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> EC with respiratory substrates in the presence of CCCP. For all bacteria, the loss of <b>the</b> ability to <b>step</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> EC was attributable to the loss of nutrient transport function. Mixtures of viable and HOCl-killed E. coli 25922 were able to <b>step</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> EC in proportion to the fraction of surviving cells. The data indicate that nucleotide phosphorylation levels are not regulatory in nongrowing bacteria but that the EC step-up achievable upon nutrient addition may be an accurate index of viability...|$|R
