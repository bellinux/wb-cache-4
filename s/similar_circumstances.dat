40|$|Extracted adenovirus-associated virus DNA {{is known}} to be double-stranded, and, therefore, it has been assumed that these virus {{particles}} contain a double-stranded genome. Recent findings, however, have suggested that the DNA in virus particles is equivalent to only half the molecular weight of extracted molecules. A density analysis of DNA extracted from a mixture of virus particles containing either bromodeoxyuridine-substituted or unsubstituted DNA shows that virions contain single-stranded DNA which, when released, forms duplex structures.

5|$|Afroyim v. Rusk, , {{is a major}} United States Supreme Court case {{in which}} the Court ruled that {{citizens}} of the United States may not be deprived of their citizenship involuntarily. The U.S. government had attempted to revoke the citizenship of Beys Afroyim, a man born in Poland, because he had cast a vote in an Israeli election after becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen. The Supreme Court decided that Afroyim's right to retain his citizenship was guaranteed by the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. In so doing, the Court struck down a federal law mandating loss of U.S. citizenship for voting in a foreign election—thereby overruling one of its own precedents, Perez v. Brownell (1958), in which it had upheld loss of citizenship under <b>similar</b> <b>circumstances</b> less than a decade earlier.|$|E
