40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Safety and Health Information Bulletin is: 1. To {{describe}} the hazard of sharp-tip <b>suture</b> <b>needles</b> {{as a source of}} percutaneous injuries to surgical personnel; 2. To present evidence of the effectiveness of blunt-tip <b>suture</b> <b>needles</b> in decreasing percutaneous injuries to surgical personnel, particularly when used to suture muscle and fascia; and 3. To emphasize OSHA's requirement to use safer medical devices - in this case, blunt-tip <b>suture</b> <b>needles</b> - where clinically appropriate. Conclusion: OSHA and NIOSH strongly encourage the use of blunt-tip <b>suture</b> <b>needles,</b> whenever feasible and appropriate, to decrease percutaneous injuries to surgical personnel. Clinical use and scientific studies have established the effectiveness of blunt tip <b>suture</b> <b>needles</b> in decreasing the risk of percutaneous injuries. Employers in workplaces that use <b>suture</b> <b>needles</b> have the responsibility under the Bloodborne Pathogens standard to evaluate the use of blunt-tip <b>suture</b> <b>needles</b> as well as other appropriate safer medical devices. After this evaluation, which must include input from nonmanagerial employees responsible for direct patient care [29 CFR 1910. 1030 (c) (1) (v) ] - e. g., in this case surgical personnel - employers must use safer devices to replace corresponding conventional sharp-tip <b>suture</b> <b>needles</b> in their workplaces when clinically appropriate. The introduction of any device must include training of staff in its proper use and follow-up to ensure a successful transition from conventional to safer devices. Where an employer has determined that the use of available safer devices is not feasible, the clinical justification for this determination must be documented in the facility's Exposure Control Plan and the employer must implement alternative means of protecting surgical personnel from percutaneous injuries.

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} improve the {{automation}} of end-hole drilling process {{in the production of}} <b>suture</b> <b>needles</b> with thread, a high-precision subpixel-based drilling method is proposed. According to the edge detection principle in mathematical morphology, combined with the characteristics of the magnified images of the ends of <b>suture</b> <b>needles</b> to be drilled, the morphological edge detection operators with variable structural elements are constructed to achieve noise suppression and fully extract the detailed information of edges of images of needle end holes to be drilled. Then, the subdivision method of spatial moments is adopted to realize the subpixel positioning of pixel-level edges. Finally, least squares fitting method is used to achieve the high-precision positioning of center of needle end hole to be drilled. The experimental results of the 0. 5 mm needle samples show that, the drilling method proposed in this study has a concentricity error no more than ± 0. 2 µm and an average drilling time of 0. 65 S, boasting good real-time performance and stability and meeting the automated production needs of drilling process of <b>suture</b> <b>needles</b> with thread...|$|R

The puncture force and time for the first puncture significantly decreased with the increasing insertion velocity. The needle with triangle cross-section tip and larger size showed higher puncture force than that with round cross-section and smaller one. The penetration force reduced evidently with the advancing insertion angle, and it reached the lowest value when the angle is 90 °. Moreover, an empirical single-parameter model of third-degree polynomial could predict the stiffness when a <b>suture</b> <b>needle</b> inserted into a complex soft tissue and showed a good fit to the experiment data.

5000|$|Some {{studies have}} found that safer needles reduce injuries, but others have shown mixed results or no benefit. The {{adherence}} to [...] "no-touch" [...] protocols that eliminate direct contact with needles during use and disposal greatly reduces the risk of needlestick injuries. In the surgical setting, especially in abdominal operations, blunt-tip <b>suture</b> <b>needles</b> were found to reduce needle stick injuries by 69%. Blunt-tip or tapered-tip <b>suture</b> <b>needles</b> can be used to sew muscle and fascia. Though they are more expensive than sharp-tipped needles, this cost is balanced by the reduction in injuries, which are expensive to treat. Sharp-tipped needles cause 51-77% of surgical needlestick injuries. The American College of Surgeons (ACS) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have endorsed the adoption of blunt-tip <b>suture</b> <b>needles</b> for <b>suturing</b> fascia and muscle. Hollow-bore needles pose a greater risk of injury than solid needles, but hollow-bore needle injuries are highly preventable: 25% of hollow-bore needle injuries to healthcare professionals can be prevented by using safer needles. Gloves can also provide better protection against injuries from tapered-tip as opposed to sharp-tipped needles. In addition, the use of two pairs of gloves (double gloving) can halve the risk of needle stick injury in surgical staff. Triple gloving may be more effective than double gloving, but using thicker gloves does not make a difference. However, the evidence is of low quality. A 2014 Cochrane review found low quality evidence showing that safety devices on IV start kits and venipuncture equipment reduce the frequency of needlestick injuries. However, these safety systems can increase the risk of exposure to splashed blood. Education with training for at-risk healthcare workers can reduce their risk of needlestick injuries.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} needle tissue interaction forces that a rigid <b>suture</b> <b>needle</b> experiences during surgical suturing. The needle-tissue interaction forces are mod-eled as the sum of lumped parameters. The model has three main components; friction, tissue compression, and cutting forces. The tissue compression force uses the area that the needle sweeps out during a suture to estimate both the force magnitude and force direction. The area that the needle sweeps out {{is a direct result}} of driving the needle in a way that does not follow the natural curve of the needle. The friction force is approximated as a static friction force along the shaft of the needle. The cutting force acts only on the needle tip. The resulting force and torque model is experimentally validated using a tissue phantom. These results indicate that the proposed lumped parameter model is capable of accurately modeling the forces experienced during a suture. I...|$|E

30|$|Ten {{preparations}} {{were randomly}} assigned to each of two different groups: group A (10 specimens) sutured with IHM technique, and group B (10 specimens) sutured with Kakiuchi technique. Kakiuchi technique is performed by passing transversely through the intact tendon a long straight needle threaded with an absorbable suture, with the same procedure being performed at two different levels on both the proximal and distal stumps of the tendon. Proximally, the suture wire is passed at 0.5 and 1  cm from the cut tendon edge; distally, the suture wire is passed at 0.5 and 1  cm from the rupture site (Fig.  1). In vivo the ankle is held at 30 ° plantar flexion and the knee flexed to 90 ° while the sutures are tied. Direct observation confirms that the space between the two stumps is eliminated [9]. The IHM repair technique is performed by running an interlocking horizontal mattress suture, starting at the far end. The <b>suture</b> <b>needle</b> passes underneath the prior crossing suture to lock each throw. When the suture is finished, it is tied at the near end as shown in Fig.  2.

PARTICIPANTS All surgical procedures (n= 333, 073) performed in 2001 - 2010 as well as 2, 113 reported BBF exposures were analyzed. METHODS Crude exposure rates were calculated; Poisson regression was used to analyze risk factors and account for procedure duration. BBF exposures involving <b>suture</b> <b>needles</b> were examined separately from those involving other device types to examine possible differences in risk factors. RESULTS The overall rate of reported BBF exposures was 6. 3 per 1, 000 surgical procedures (2. 9 per 1, 000 surgical hours). BBF exposure rates increased with estimated patient blood loss (17. 7 exposures per 1, 000 procedures with 501 - 1, 000 cc blood loss and 26. 4 exposures per 1, 000 procedures with > 1, 000 cc blood loss), number of personnel working in the surgical field during the procedure (34. 4 exposures per 1, 000 procedures having ≥ 15 personnel ever in the field), and procedure duration (14. 3 exposures per 1, 000 procedures lasting 4 to < 6 hours, 27. 1 exposures per 1, 000 procedures lasting ≥ 6 hours).

The ligation over needle method involved placing a <b>suture</b> <b>needle</b> over the femoral artery, ligating over it and then removing the needle. The transfixation method involved transfixing the approximate center of the femoral artery and then tying the suture.

40|$|This study {{examined}} whether {{the number and}} type of sutures used in oral surgery influence two ad hoc variables (incision plane and displaced area), which are two variables related to whether the <b>suture</b> <b>needle</b> is suitable for the task. Seventy-five TB- 15 needles were studied, which were used to suture between zero and three mucosa and/subperiosteal sutures, producing 15 groups with 5 needles in each one. The incision plane and displaced area were measured for each group, which are two variables related to how the needle has worn and altered. Statistical treatment was conducted using the Kruskal-Wallis H test to compare multiple values and the Mann-Whitney U test to compare pairs. A multi-stage regression model was applied {{with the aim of}} predicting the changes in the dependent variables based on the number and type of sutures performed. The incision plane ranged from 126. 67 to 346. 24 ?m among the different groups. The displaced area was measured as being between 14 524. 83 ?m 2 and 128 311. 91 ?m 2. The best predictive model for the incision plane obtained a coefficient of determination (R 2) of 0. 149, while it reached 0. 249 for the displaced area. Subperiosteal sutures held more weighting among the variables studied. Mucosal sutures did not seem to greatly affect needle wear. Observations reported in this paper indicate that the needle should be changed after having performed two subperiosteal sutures, given the wear and change to the incision plane that is produced, which causes the needle's cutting ability to reduce. © Medicina Oral S.

40|$|Background: The American College of Surgeons {{guidelines}} {{suggest the}} use of intact gloves, double gloving, hands-free zone technique to pass sharp instruments, and blunt tip suture needles to protect patients, {{as well as the}} surgical team. This study estimates {{the extent to which these}} guidelines are followed in a large academic health system. Methods: Over a two-month period in the spring of 2010, 320 general surgical attendings, subspecialty surgical attendings, and surgical resident physicians practicing at a large academic health system, were approached during or after surgical conferences to participate in a cross-sectional study. Nearly 1 / 3 rd completed an anonymous and voluntary self-administered survey. The survey included questions regarding knowledge of each technique, beliefs about effectiveness of each technique, and adherence to the guidelines. Responses were compared by surgeon rank. Results: Awareness of ACS recommendation guidelines was high among surgical attendings (68 %) and residents (60 %). While 60 % of residents adhered to these recommendations, only 43 % of attendings adhered. Both attendings (65 %) and residents (64 %) had similar negative perception toward double gloving in terms of tactile sensation and hand free zone hindrance during procedural operations during cases. Forty percent of residents and attendings agreed on unhindered concentration to hand free zone technique. Blunt tip <b>suture</b> <b>needle</b> use had low awareness and usage regardless of surgeon rank (~ 40 %). Conclusion: Increased promotion of the ACS guidelines is warranted.

MethodsPI surveillance is a routine activity in King Abdulaziz Medical City (a 900 -bed teaching tertiary health care hospital) in Riyadh using the Exposure Prevention Information Network (EPINet) data collection tool. From 2001 through 2003, educational activities were conducted for health care workers (HCWs) to prevent PIs. The education included lectures on the risk of unsafe practices {{that may lead to}} PIs and how to avoid them. Data from before (1997 – 2000) and after (2004 – 2008) the intervention were imported from our surveillance system and statistically analyzed. ResultsThe total overall rate of PIs per 1000 HCWs was significantly lower in the post-intervention period than in the pre-intervention period (14 vs. 32. 8 / 1000 HCWs, respectively). The rates of PIs among nurses and housekeepers showed a significant decrease (15 vs. 37. 6 / 1000 HCWs and 10 vs. 34. 5 / 1000 HCWs, respectively). The frequency of PIs in the emergency department (ED) and intensive care units (ICUs) showed a significant decrease (3. 4 % for both vs. 12. 4 % and 13. 7 %, respectively). PIs associated with devices, such as needles on IV lines, IV catheters, lancets and <b>suture</b> <b>needles,</b> showed a significant decrease. PIs occurring during device disassembly and from inappropriately discarded devices also decreased significantly. ConclusionThe educational program reduced some categories of PIs, including the overall rate, the rate among nurses and housekeepers, the frequency in the ED and ICUs and the frequency among needles on IV lines, IV catheters, lancets and <b>suture</b> <b>needles.</b> Other PI categories did not change significantly...|$|R
