This species is the only known member of the genus Cheimerius. Unlike other members of the sparid family, C. nufar is gonochoric (does not change sex after birth).|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{focuses on}} the biology and fishery {{assessment}} of <b>Santer</b> <b>Seabream,</b> Cheimerius nufar(Valenciennes, 1830) in relation to certain environmental parameters influence in the Arabian Sea off Oman between April 2005 -March 2007 and Sept 2007 Sept 2008. The fish occurred at temperatures between 20 ºC and 24 ºC and appeared to adapt to low oxygen level during different periods. The female and male mature at 31. 9 cm and 33. 7 cm TL respectively. The fish Spawn during May October. The estimated age based on length frequency and otolith is 11 years and 13 years respectively. The calculated length at capture was 31. 4 cm and about 67. 4 % of {{the fish in the}} commercial catches measured < 34 cm. The estimated total mortality, natural mortalityand fishing mortalitywere 1. 3, 0. 62 and 0. 68 respectively. The C. nufar stock is marginally overexploited. The average fish size to be caught may be restricted to 36 cm TL. A reduction of 17 % of effort from the present level is recommended...|$|E
