40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} a nearest-neighbor four state hard-core (HC) model on the homogeneous Cayley tree of order k. The Hamiltonian {{of the model}} is considered {{on a set of}} “admissible ” configurations. Admissibility is specified through a graph with four vertices. We first exhibit conditions (on the graph and on the parameters) under which the model has a unique Gibbs measure. Next we turn on some specific cases. Namely, first we study, in case of particular graph (diamond), translation-invariant and periodic Gibbs measures. We provide in both cases the equations of the transition lines separating uniqueness from non–uniqueness regimes. Finally the same is done for “fertile ” graphs, the so–called <b>stick,</b> <b>gun,</b> and key (here only translation invariant states are taken into account).

50|$|Canada Olympic Park relies almost {{exclusively}} on man made snow to create skiable terrain. Snowmaking usually begins in early December and depending on weather conditions usually ends in early February. The hill has an arsenal of snowmaking equipment including automated SMI PoleCat fan <b>guns,</b> 'Mckinney' <b>stick</b> <b>guns,</b> {{and a handful of}} aging SMI Highland fan guns. An onsight pump station provides high pressure water and air to hydrants located around the hill. When pumping at capacity the park consumes roughly 850,000 L/hr of water.|$|R

50|$|In Darra, almost {{three-fourths of}} the people are in the gun trade. Pen pistols and walking <b>stick</b> <b>guns</b> are popular here. Around 400-700 guns are made in Darra each day and the number is rising with the {{adoption}} of more tools. These guns are more than enough for the Pashtuns themselves. Many guns find their way to and from Afghanistan. In the 1980s, heroin was shut down in the markets after consultation with the tribal elders due to foreign pressure, but guns, known as the ornaments of a Pashtun, could not be eliminated. Manufacturing of heavy ammunition, however, has been closed down.|$|R
50|$|Rubber band guns can be {{made from}} ice-cream sticks. The {{individual}} sticks are held together by either rubber bands, tape or glue. They can also be cut or carved to the required shape. It is generally limited to pistols and sniper rifles, as only one or two shots can be loaded on most guns, but semi-automatic ice-cream <b>stick</b> <b>guns</b> have been made by determined amateurs. They can also be adapted to fire arrows or other small objects with the rubber bands. In some guns, the handle doubles as a trigger, but using triggers provide much better accuracy.|$|R
