Bruce Bochy stated that after the All Star break, Cain would move from the {{second place in the}} Giants starting rotation to fifth. Bochy added that Cain falling in the order {{had more to do with}} everyone else's successes than any <b>shortcomings</b> <b>of</b> Cain.|$|E
5|$|King was {{sponsored}} by the Daily Express and Sunday Express newspapers. One of the <b>shortcomings</b> <b>of</b> the boat was that it had neither guard rails or shrouds to hold on to. King solved this problem with a steel wire that stretched from bow to stern, to which he clipped a harness. His method was then copied by fellow racers Loïck Fougeron and Bernard Moitessier.|$|E

5|$|Second, Asch {{emphasized}} that independent thought and disagreement among group members is {{a cornerstone of}} group functioning. He believed that only by settling our differences with other group members can we actually understand the <b>shortcomings</b> <b>of</b> our own beliefs (Levine, 1999). This notion has been embraced by social scientists like Moscovici, who has pursued this rationale {{as the basis for}} his theory of minority influence in group situations, and has also been incorporated into sociocognitive conflict theory.|$|E
5|$|Shed Light’s Second phase {{eventually}} {{turned out}} {{to be based on the}} B-57. B-57 aircraft had already been deployed to southeast Asia and had been the subject of initial sensor evaluations under Tropic Moon II. Tropic Moon III was envisioned as an SCNA that made up for the gross <b>shortcomings</b> <b>of</b> Tropic Moon I and II.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} war, many Israelis demanded an {{impartial}} inquiry to investigate {{what became known}} as the machdal (the blunder), with a focus on the <b>shortcomings</b> <b>of</b> the government and the army, particularly their lack of preparedness for the attack and its ramifications. Golda Meir finally agreed to the formation of the Agranat Commission towards the end of November 1973. War veterans and members of the public attacked Meir and Moshe Dayan, while Israeli generals criticised one another's performance.|$|E

5|$|The chanté mas (masquerade song) {{tradition}} is based around pre-calypso Carnival music {{performed in a}} responsorial style by partygoers. The Dominican Carnival masquerade lasted for two days of parading through the streets, with a singer dancing backwards {{in front of the}} drummer on a tanbou lélé. Chanté mas lyrics are traditionally based on gossip and scandal, and addressed the personal <b>shortcomings</b> <b>of</b> others.|$|E
5|$|The {{perceived}} <b>shortcomings</b> <b>of</b> {{the mass}} housing movement led to {{efforts to create}} cost-effective housing solutions that were more varied, more integrated with natural surroundings, and above all more customized to families' needs. In 1973, the Parliament of Norway recommended a shift toward small residential houses rather than large apartment buildings. The Norwegian State Housing Bank (Husbanken) provided citizens {{with the ability to}} fund construction of their homes, and an entire construction industry formed to build these needs.|$|E
5|$|Another {{criticism}} from locomotive crews concerned the exposed cab in bad weather, which necessitated {{the installation of}} a tarpaulin sheet over {{the rear of the}} cab and the front of the tender, restricting rearward vision. The 1921 Coal Miners’ strike meant that two class members (Nos.737 and 739) were converted to oil-burning. One of the modified locomotives subsequently caught fire at Salisbury shed, and both were reverted to coal firing {{by the end of the}} year. When the LSWR was amalgamated into the Southern Railway in 1923, Urie had done little to remedy the <b>shortcomings</b> <b>of</b> the N15s, and it fell to his successor to improve the class.|$|E

5|$|Due {{partly to}} the limited success of his latest book outside Indiana, Riley was persuaded to begin working with other midwestern writers to attempt to form an {{association}} to promote their work. Popular Indiana writer Lew Wallace, author of , was a major promoter of the effort. During 1885, {{more than one hundred}} writers joined the group. They held their first meeting in July, naming themselves the Western Association of Writers. At the meeting Maurice Thompson was named president, and Riley vice president. The association never succeeded in its goals of creating a powerful advertising force, but became a social club and a rival literary community to the eastern writing establishment. Riley was disappointed with the <b>shortcomings</b> <b>of</b> the group, but came to depend on its regular meetings as a escape from his normally hectic schedule.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these preventable issues, GWA studies have attracted more fundamental criticism, mainly because of their assumption that common genetic variation plays {{a large role in}} explaining the heritable variation of common disease. This aspect of GWA studies has attracted the criticism that, although it could not have been known prospectively, GWA studies were ultimately not worth the expenditure. Alternative strategies suggested involve linkage analysis. More recently, the rapidly decreasing price of complete genome sequencing have also provided a realistic alternative to genotyping array-based GWA studies. It can be discussed if the use of this new technique is still referred to as a GWA study, but high-throughput sequencing does have potential to side-step some of the <b>shortcomings</b> <b>of</b> non-sequencing GWA.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} address the <b>shortcomings</b> <b>of</b> the RNZAF's Skyhawk fleet, the New Zealand Government {{approved}} the Project Kahu program in May 1985. This project had a total cost of NZ$140 million, and primarily involved upgrading the A-4G and A-4Ks' avionics to almost the standard of those fitted to the modern General Dynamics F-16C Fighting Falcon. The Skyhawks also received new wings drawn from the stock of spare parts purchased from the RAN in 1984. Work began on the first aircraft in 1986, and the program was completed in 1991. After receiving the Kahu upgrade package the A-4Gs were re-designated A-4Ks.|$|E

5|$|On April 20, 2011, it was {{reported}} that customers had launched a protest against perceived <b>shortcomings</b> <b>of</b> Portal 2. Users complained that the game was too shortsome saying that it is only four hours long, about the existence of paid, downloadable content for some versions at launch, and that the Windows and OS X versions were ports of the console version. Other journalists countered that the quality of the graphics on the Windows and Mac versions did not suggest a simple console port. Stephen Totilo of Kotaku wrote that the game lasted nine hours and that the downloadable content consisted purely of cosmetic add-ons. Some journalists said that the minimal impact of The Potato Sack alternative reality game on the early release of Portal 2 may be influencing the user scores.|$|E
5|$|Recognising the {{increasing}} congestion in the City and its rapidly growing suburbs, Pearson published a pamphlet in 1845 {{calling for the}} construction of an underground railway through the Fleet valley to Farringdon. The proposed railway would have been an atmospheric railway with trains pushed through tunnels by compressed air. Although the proposal was ridiculed and came to nothing (and would almost certainly have failed if it had been built, due to the <b>shortcomings</b> <b>of</b> the technology proposed), Pearson continued to lobby for a variety of railway schemes throughout the 1840s and 1850s.|$|E
5|$|The {{major part}} of the {{subsequent}} attenuated expedition was a three-month cruise to the eastern Antarctic, under the leadership of the party's second-in-command, Frank Wild. The <b>shortcomings</b> <b>of</b> Quest were soon in evidence: slow speed, heavy fuel consumption, a tendency to roll in heavy seas, and a steady leak. The ship was unable to proceed further than longitude 20°E, well short of its easterly target, and its engine's low power coupled with its unsuitable bows was insufficient for it to penetrate southward through the pack ice. Following several fruitless attempts, Wild returned the ship to South Georgia, on the way visiting Elephant Island where he and 21 others had been stranded after the sinking of the ship Endurance, during Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition six years earlier.|$|E

5|$|The <b>shortcomings</b> <b>of</b> Aristotelian physics {{would not}} be fully {{corrected}} until the 17th century work of Galileo Galilei, who {{was influenced by the}} late medieval idea that objects in forced motion carried an innate force of impetus. Galileo constructed an experiment in which stones and cannonballs were both rolled down an incline to disprove the Aristotelian theory of motion. He showed that the bodies were accelerated by gravity to an extent that was independent of their mass and argued that objects retain their velocity unless acted on by a force, for example friction.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{accident}} {{did not result}} in a large number of deaths, it exposed major stewardship <b>shortcomings</b> <b>of</b> the privatised national railway infrastructure company Railtrack. Reports found {{there was a lack of}} communication and some staff were not aware of maintenance procedures. Railtrack subsequently went into administration and was replaced by Network Rail. The aftermath of {{the accident}} saw widespread speed limit reductions throughout the rail network and a tightening of health and safety procedures, the repercussions of which were still felt up to 15 years later. In 2005, both Network Rail and the contractor Balfour Beatty were found guilty of breaching health and safety laws.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its strong}} sales, Final Fantasy XIII had been criticized on several fronts. Complaints {{included}} {{that the game}} had been too linear, had not allowed enough interaction with non-player characters, and had not featured enough minigames and puzzles. The developers intended to address these criticisms with the sequel by adding the Historia Crux system, numerous sidequests from non-player characters, and the casino minigame area. Environments were made more explorable and the artists were given more freedom to include their own ideas in the game's locations, in order to rectify the <b>shortcomings</b> <b>of</b> the more artificial seeming settings in Final Fantasy XIII. Although the developers were explicitly responding to the criticism, they saw the changes and additions as making the sequel {{in line with what}} players had hoped Final Fantasy XIII would be, rather than backing away from the changes that game had brought to the series. For the structure of side quests and some other aspects such as the abundance of chocobos and the more open environment, the team drew inspiration from Rockstar San Diego's Red Dead Redemption. The game also included multiple endings, which Toriyama referred to as a first for the series.|$|E
