25|$|Search folders, {{which are}} <b>saved</b> <b>searches,</b> have been updated to include RSS feeds as well. Search folders {{can be created}} with a {{specific}} search criteria, specifying the subject, type and other attributes of the information being searched. When a search folder is opened, all matching items for the search are automatically retrieved and grouped up.|$|E
2500|$|In Windows Search, {{which is}} part of Windows Vista, it is also {{possible}} to save a search query as a Virtual Folder, called a Saved Search or Search Folder which, when accessed, runs the search with the saved query and returns the results as a folder listing. Physically, a search folder is just an XML file (with a [...]search-ms extension) which stores the search query (in either AQS or NQS), including the search operators as well. Windows Vista also supports query composition, where a saved search (called a scope) can be nested within the query string of another search. Search Folders are also distributable via RSS. By default, Windows references the profile of the user who originally created a Search Folder as part of the query's scope. This design choice does not prevent <b>saved</b> <b>searches</b> from being shared with other users, but it prevents them from operating on different user profiles. While users can manually modify the contents of a saved search so that the scope references the %USERPROFILE% environment variable, which will enable it to operate on other machines or profiles regardless of the original author, Microsoft has released a SearchMelt Creator utility that automates this process for the user.|$|E

50|$|It only runs on Linux and {{is written}} in Python using PyGTK. It ships with Ubuntu 10.04 and above. Gwibber {{supports}} multiple social networking sites in a combined social stream with URL shortening, <b>saved</b> <b>searches,</b> and a multicolumn UI.|$|E
50|$|For many systems, {{architectural}} {{default parameters}} are available; these are essentially <b>saved</b> <b>searches</b> plus {{the results of}} hand tuning. If the arch defaults work they will likely get 10-15% better performance than the install search. On such systems the installation process is greatly simplified.|$|E
50|$|Other {{functions}} {{include a}} bookmarklet for capturing web references, WYSIWYG formatted text and threaded discussions within records, user and workgroup tags, personal and shared <b>saved</b> <b>searches,</b> search expansion rules {{to pull in}} related records, workgroup ownership of records, group notifications, and blogging. There is a Zotero bibliography synchronisation function.|$|E
25|$|There is {{also the}} ability to <b>save</b> <b>searches</b> as a Search Folder where opening the folder will execute a {{specific}} search automatically and display the results as a normal folder. A search folder is just an XML file which stores the search query, including the search operators as well. When these files are accessed, the search is run with the saved query string and the results presented as a virtual folder. Windows Vista also supports query composition, where a <b>saved</b> <b>search</b> (called a scope) can be nested within the query string of another search.|$|R
50|$|Children {{can search}} for books by country, language, length, {{intended}} age group, content type, and emotional quality, among other qualifiers. An advanced search option is also provided for more experienced or older users, and all users can register to <b>save</b> <b>search</b> preferences and favorite books.|$|R
50|$|In GNOME 2.14, a <b>saved</b> <b>search</b> is {{a virtual}} folder whose {{contents}} {{are the result of}} a Nautilus search, which has multiple backends. The contents of these folders are determined dynamically when the folder is opened, and updated automatically when files are created or modified.|$|R
5000|$|Search folders, {{which are}} <b>saved</b> <b>searches,</b> have been updated to include RSS feeds as well.

50|$|A {{particular}} {{focus is}} on the improvement of collaboration between users when assembling resources together for a project. Users can create custom 'collections' which include resources and <b>saved</b> <b>searches,</b> which can be shared with other users. Collections work like a shopping cart on an e-commerce site, and are always visible in a strip {{at the bottom of the}} screen.|$|E
50|$|The website is {{hosted by}} online journal {{provider}} MPS Technologies’ JournalStore platform. Among the features {{included on the}} site are full-text indexing, RSS feeds, bookmarks, <b>saved</b> <b>searches,</b> comments sections for each protocol, and upload a protocol. The site also features video protocols, produced {{in conjunction with the}} Journal of Visualized Experiments, a web-based, video journal for biological research.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to their search engine, you may <b>save</b> your <b>searches</b> and have jobs delivered to you by email alert, iGoogle, or other RSS feed readers. With an iGoogle account, for example, you may <b>save</b> your WiZeefa <b>search</b> with a click.|$|R
50|$|The general {{benefit of}} a {{collaborative}} search engine is that collaborators can <b>search</b> together, <b>save</b> <b>search</b> results, share and discuss them in one place. This could save time, avoid repeated work, and leverage group knowledge when working with colleagues on a business project, collaborating on a school group project, or sharing interesting things with friends and family.|$|R
5000|$|In November 2006, Microsoft {{released}} Windows Vista {{which allows}} users to <b>save</b> any <b>search</b> query as a Search Folder, a type of virtual folder. Search Folders are designed so that users {{are not required to}} remember where their files are stored. A Search Folder is not a physical folder, but is essentially an XML file that stores a defined query in a form that can be used by the Windows Search subsystem. Because of this, a Search Folder can be created anywhere that a normal folder can be created. A similar approach exists in Windows XP when the Windows Indexing Service is enabled, as a <b>search</b> can be <b>saved</b> as a [...]fnd file. However, a <b>saved</b> <b>search</b> query in Windows XP only <b>saves</b> a user's <b>search</b> criteria; users must still specify the location and perform the search again as results are not dynamic.|$|R
5000|$|In Windows 7, {{the concept}} of virtual folders has been {{significantly}} realized {{with the introduction of}} the Libraries feature. Similar to <b>Saved</b> <b>Searches,</b> a Library is simply an XML file but with the [...] extension and is essentially a collection of files with specified attributes presented in a familiar folder-style visual interface. Libraries have a shell namespace extension in Explorer and their XML files can be reused across Windows installations or the network.|$|E
5000|$|ACAP grew to {{encompass}} several other areas, including bookmark management for web browsers—it's effectively a roaming protocol for Internet applications. ACAP is in use {{by at least}} four clients and three servers to varying degrees, but it has never achieved the popularity of Lightweight Directory Access Protocol or SyncML. It is a deceptively simple protocol, but the combination of three key features, hierarchical data, fine-grained access control, and [...] "contexts" [...] or <b>saved</b> <b>searches</b> with notification, has caused serious problems for server implementors.|$|E
50|$|Social selling {{can be used}} in this scenario. A {{salesman}} can use <b>saved</b> <b>searches</b> to {{look for}} trigger phrases in social media, such as Twitter. He can also comment on industry blogs, and keep an eye on LinkedIn for new job openings and breaking news. This information collectively helps the salesman understand when a sales opportunity is available. This could be seen as an initial step before selling takes place, as the salesman will already be involved in the conversation, ensuring the lead isn't cold.|$|E

50|$|Robert Weber (1926-2008) was an American {{astronomer}} and discoverer {{of minor}} planets {{who ran the}} precursor to the LINEAR project shortly before his retirement in 1996. Data were collected by manually entering telescope pointing positions and requesting an image <b>save.</b> <b>Searching</b> twenty fields was a taxing experience. They did have automatic object detection working, but no starfield matching at that time.|$|R
5000|$|Thunderbird {{can manage}} {{multiple}} email, newsgroup, and news feed accounts and supports multiple identities within accounts. Features such as quick <b>search,</b> <b>saved</b> <b>search</b> folders ("virtual folders"), advanced message filtering, message grouping, and labels help manage and find messages. On Linux-based systems, system mail (movemail) accounts are supported. Thunderbird provides basic support for system-specific new email notifications {{and can be}} extended with advanced notification support using an add-on.|$|R
50|$|Humbul {{also offered}} a {{personalisation}} service that included email alerting (based on <b>saved</b> <b>searches</b> or saved subject areas) and the My Humbul Include function which enabled the re-presentation of catalogue records within a personal website (using javascript technology). For each subject covered {{there was also}} a freely available RSS newsfeed which contains news of the latest websites reviewed by Humbul. It was also possible to search Humbul via Z39.50-conformant clients, such as the Endnote personal bibliographic database application. All these functions have been transferred to the new Intute system.|$|E
50|$|AlphaSense is a specialized, web-based {{financial}} and company search engine providing users {{with the ability}} to search, navigate, annotate and analyze corporate filings and other research documents. Users can set alerts on <b>saved</b> <b>searches</b> and receive instant notification when research, news, press announcements or new data points are available on companies, industries or any keywords of interest. The product uses a blend of proprietary linguistic search and natural language processing algorithms to index every word and passage of text, as well as Machine Learning to expand searches to include relevant synonyms.|$|E
5000|$|The Live.com domain was {{previously}} owned by Live Networks Inc., {{a producer of}} streaming network software. Microsoft's Live.com launched on November 1, 2005 with the Windows Live brand and various improvements[...] By November 8 they had added Firefox support. On November 23 themes were added. On December 15, support for Opera 9, new gadgets, and other improvements went live. On December 20, the search engine was improved. January 27, 2006 saw support for images in RSS feeds. On February 28, the search box was updated. On March 7, Live.com was updated with a new look, more gadgets, and an improved interface. It also featured, for the first time, the new Windows Live Search (now Bing). Features included intelligent scrolling, dynamic image search, and <b>saved</b> <b>searches.</b> On March 30, other improvements were made, especially regarding the first run experience and persistence of search-only mode.|$|E

5000|$|A feature {{introduced}} in November 2013 allows logged-in users to <b>save</b> <b>search</b> results into the [...] "Google Scholar library", a personal collection which the user can search separately and organize by tags. A metrics feature now supports viewing {{the impact of}} academic journals, and whole fields of science, via the [...] "metrics" [...] button. This reveals the top journals {{in a field of}} interest, and the articles generating these journal's impact can also be accessed.|$|R
50|$|In computing, {{a virtual}} folder {{generally}} denotes an organizing principle for files {{that is not}} dependent on location in a hierarchical directory tree. Instead, it consists of software that coalesces results from a data store, which may be a database or a custom index, and presents them visually in the format in which folder views are presented. A virtual folder {{can be thought of}} as a view that lists all files tagged with a certain tag, and thus a simulation of a folder whose dynamic contents can be assembled on the fly, when requested. It is related in concept to several other topics in computer science, with names including <b>saved</b> <b>search,</b> <b>saved</b> query, and filtering.|$|R
