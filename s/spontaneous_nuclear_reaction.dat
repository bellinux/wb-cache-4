5000|$|... 6 November 2006: A {{fault in}} the {{equipment}} used to weigh MOX {{led to a}} grinder being loaded with more than the authorized amount 8 kg of fissile material, presenting the possible threat of a <b>spontaneous</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>reaction.</b> Initially classified as a low-priority Class-1 level incident, it was subsequently revised to Class 2 by the ASN.|$|E
2500|$|Violet Club (and to {{a lesser}} degree Yellow Sun Mk.1) was not {{considered}} a satisfactory design and suffered from numerous design defects. [...] An implosion design, the fissile core of the weapon was a hollow sphere of highly enriched uranium (HEU) which was surrounded by a High Explosive supercharge and 72-lens implosion system. [...] The HEU core was greater than one uncompressed critical mass and to maintain it in a sub-critical condition AWRE fashioned it into a hollow thin-walled sphere. [...] The HEU sphere was collapsed inwards by the supercharge and 72 explosive lenses. [...] However, a fire in the bomb store or a traffic collision on the airfield could easily lead to a partial crushing or collapse of the unremovable uranium shell, and in turn a <b>spontaneous</b> <b>nuclear</b> chain <b>reaction.</b> [...] AWRE responded by inserting (though a hole in the shell) a rubber bag, rather akin to an outsize female condom, and filled this with 20,000 steel ball bearings of , weighing around [...] [...] Subsequently, the number of these steel balls was increased to 133,000, with a reduction in size to approx [...] diameter. [...] The balls were retained in the device by sealing the hole with a plastic bung.|$|R
50|$|A <b>nuclear</b> chain <b>reaction</b> {{occurs when}} one single <b>nuclear</b> <b>reaction</b> causes {{an average of}} one or more {{subsequent}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactions,</b> thus leading to the possibility of a self-propagating series of these <b>reactions.</b> The specific <b>nuclear</b> <b>reaction</b> may be the fission of heavy isotopes (e.g., uranium-235, 235U).

40|$|Abstract. TALYS is a <b>nuclear</b> <b>reaction</b> {{program which}} simulates <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactions</b> that involve neutrons, gamma-rays, protons, deuterons, tritons, helions and alpha-particles, in the 1 keV- 200 MeV energy range. A suite of <b>nuclear</b> <b>reaction</b> models has been {{implemented}} {{into a single}} code system, enabling us to evaluate basically all <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactions</b> beyond the resonance range. An overview is given of the main nuclear models used, such as newly developed optical models, various compound nucleus, fission, gamma-ray strength, level density and pre-equilibrium models, all driven by a comprehensive database of nuclear structure parameters. The predictive power of the code is demonstrated by comparing calculated results with a very diverse set of experimental observables. Our aim {{is to show that}} TALYS represents a robust computational approach that covers the whole path from fundamental <b>nuclear</b> <b>reaction</b> models to the creation of complete data libraries for nuclear applications...|$|R
