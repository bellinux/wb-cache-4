500|$|Critics {{raved about}} Carey {{performance}} following {{the completion of}} the ceremony, with Jon Pareles from The New York Times saying [...] "once she was worked up, <b>she</b> <b>moaned,</b> growled and swooped to the high and low extremes of her voice in [...] "Fly Like a Bird". A writer from USA Today complimented her recital of both songs, writing [...] "Carey certainly earned the right to savor the spotlight this year. But the diva made room for Walker's booming baritone in 'Bird', her fluttering homage to Minnie Ripperton." [...] Gary Susman from Entertainment Weekly called Carey the [...] "comeback queen" [...] and wrote [...] "Its what her voice did, soaring into the rafters like only Carey's can." [...] Roger Friedman from Fox News outed the performance as [...] "the number that sent the audience into a frenzy". On April9,2008, reality competition American Idol aired its second annual charity event, titled Idol Gives Back. Backed up by Randy Jackson on the bass, Carey appeared on stage as the last head-lining performer of the evening. Midway through the performance, a large church choir walked on stage in blue garbs, and provided the gospel climax for the song. Ann Powers from the Los Angeles Times called the song an [...] "inspirational show-stopper" [...] and felt Carey's vocal's were [...] "patented impossible notes". In regards to the performance, Katie Byrne from MTV News wrote [...] "Carey was at her over-the-top best, with a full gospel choir and the high notes that made her famous." [...] Aside from several televised performances, Carey included [...] "Fly Like a Bird" [...] on the set-lists of all her tours following its release. During Carey's The Adventures of Mimi Tour (2006) stop at Madison Square Garden, the song was dedicated to Ol' Dirty Bastard, who died in 2004 from an accidental drug overdose. The performance had to be re-done, as Carey's pastor, Clarence Keaton, missed his cue for the Biblical verses, and was forced to be found backstage and ushered to the spotlight. Four years later, Carey performed the song throughout her Angels Advocate Tour, only dedicating it to Keaton, who died on July3,2009. Editor and journalist Thomas Kintner from the Hartford Courant felt that during her live recital of [...] "Fly Like a Bird", Carey [...] "displayed power and sky-scraping pitch".|$|E
60|$|The White Queen gave a deep sigh, {{and laid}} {{her head on}} Alice's shoulder. 'I AM so sleepy?' <b>she</b> <b>moaned.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... "'Oh, poor Jack!' <b>she</b> <b>moaned,</b> as her little, wasted fingers {{opened and}} closed upon the counterpane. 'Poor Jack, it will break his heart.' ...|$|E
6000|$|CAESAR. Be {{afraid if}} you dare. (The {{note of the}} bucina resounds again in the distance. <b>She</b> <b>moans</b> with fear. Caesar exalts in it, exclaiming) Aha! Caesar {{approaches}} the throne of Cleopatra. Come: take your place. (He takes her hand and leads her to the throne. She is too downcast to speak.) Ho, there, Teetatota. How do you call your slaves? ...|$|R
60|$|CAESAR. Whatever dread {{may be in}} your soul--however terrible Caesar may be to you--you {{must confront}} him as a brave woman and a great queen; and you must feel no fear. If your hand shakes: if your voice quavers; then--night and death! (<b>She</b> <b>moans.)</b> But if he thinks you worthy to rule, he will set you on the throne by his side and make you the real ruler of Egypt.|$|R
2500|$|Hyperion senses her {{attention}} and gazes back, and, although a non-physical entity, also begins to desire her company. Sliding through her window {{when she is}} asleep, he caresses Cătălina as she dreams of him. In one such a moment, <b>she</b> <b>moans</b> for him to [...] "glide down upon a ray" [...] and become her betrothed. Urged on by this command, the Morning Star hurls himself into the sea, reemerging as a [...] "fair youth", or [...] "handsome corpse with living eyes".|$|R

6000|$|With {{one black}} shadow at its feet, [...] The house thro' all the level shines, [...] Close-latticed to the {{brooding}} heat, [...] And silent in its dusty vines: [...] A faint-blue ridge upon the right, [...] An empty river-bed before, [...] And shallows on a distant shore, [...] In glaring sand and inlets bright. [...] But [...] "Ave Mary," [...] made <b>she</b> <b>moan,</b> [...] And [...] "Ave Mary," [...] night and morn, [...] And [...] "Ah," [...] she sang, [...] "to be all alone, [...] To live forgotten, and love forlorn".|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> was <b>moaning</b> and lamenting {{even as she}} ran in, and now {{she threw}} her apron over her face and sank into a chair, {{continuing}} her moaning and her lamentations.|$|R
50|$|A beautiful, seductive {{woman who}} derives sexual {{satisfaction}} from killing, {{she is a}} classic and quite literal femme fatale. In one scene, she lures a Canadian admiral, Chuck Farrell (Billy J. Mitchell), onto a yacht moored off Monte Carlo and, engaging in violent sexual intercourse, suffocates him to death by squeezing her thighs around his rib cage incredibly hard; <b>she</b> <b>moans</b> in pleasure as he moans in pain, and reaches orgasm as he dies. Meanwhile, fellow operative General Arkady Grigorovich Ourumov (Gottfried John) steals his NATO ID, granting them access to a Eurocopter Tiger aboard a French warship anchored off Monte Carlo.|$|R

5000|$|Anya and Xander {{are talking}} about their {{upcoming}} wedding at the Magic Box. The door opens but no-one enters. Buffy's voice comes out of nowhere, along with picking up two magical circular items and making them look like eyes. Upon discovering this, Xander immediately believes that Willow may have suffered a relapse and confronts her, but Willow is offended and insists {{that she is not}} responsible. Buffy continues her invisible adventures in Sunnydale. [...] "I'm the ghost of fashion victims past," [...] <b>she</b> <b>moans</b> to a civilian, who is wearing a studded cap. She then drives off with a parking inspector's cart.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, your mother--that is true. I {{never saw}} such a woman. She worries, and worries, and worries; and wakes nights, and lies so, thinking--that is, {{worrying}}; worrying about you. And when the night storms go raging along, <b>she</b> <b>moans</b> and says, 'Ah, God pity her, she {{is out in}} this with her poor wet soldiers.' And when the lightning glares and the thunder crashes she wrings her hands and trembles, saying, 'It is like the awful cannon and the flash, and yonder somewhere she is riding down upon the spouting guns and I not there to protect her." ...|$|R
60|$|There was another, {{but it has}} ceased. That wretched {{woman with}} the infant in her arms, round whose meagre form the remnant of her own scanty shawl is {{carefully}} wrapped, has been attempting to sing some popular ballad, {{in the hope of}} wringing a few pence from the compassionate passer-by. A brutal laugh at her weak voice is all she has gained. The tears fall thick and fast down her own pale face; the child is cold and hungry, and its low half-stifled wailing adds to the misery of its wretched mother, as <b>she</b> <b>moans</b> aloud, and sinks despairingly down, on a cold damp door-step.|$|R
6000|$|... "Have I not {{walked the}} streets," [...] <b>she</b> <b>moaned,</b> [...] "till my feet have been sore with {{blisters}} {{and my head}} dizzy! Yet I have never met him." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't believe it," [...] <b>she</b> <b>moaned.</b> [...] "It's poison--I know it's poison. Oh, don't make me drink it"--her {{voice rose}} to a shriek--"don't make me drink it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'O, mercy!' <b>she</b> almost <b>moaned.</b> 'Four great {{girls to}} teach the rudiments to, and have always {{in the house with}} me {{spelling}} over their books; and I hate teaching, it kills me. I am bitterly punished--I am, I am!' ...|$|R
500|$|Smith's 11th studio album, Banga, was {{released}} in [...] June 2012. Music Journalist Hal Horowitz wrote : [...] "These songs aren't as loud or frantic as those of her late 70s heyday, but they resonate just as boldly as <b>she</b> <b>moans,</b> chants, speaks and spits out lyrics with the grace and determination of Mohammad Ali in his prime. It's not an easy listen—the vast majority of her music never has been—but if you're a fan and/or prepared for the challenge, this is as potent, heady and uncompromising as she has ever gotten, and with Smith's storied history as a musical maverick, that's saying plenty." [...] The critical aggregator website Metacritic awarded the album a score of 81, indicating [...] "universal acclaim".|$|R
5000|$|Hiroshi Hada, a Japanese {{businessman}} in a troubled marriage, sees a woman being groped {{in a crowded}} Tokyo subway. He is fascinated {{by the fact that}} <b>she</b> <b>moans</b> silently, involuntarily orgasms, but does not cry out or let people know she is being sexually molested. When Hada is transferred to Los Angeles, he has too much to drink at a business party and tries to imitate what he saw by groping a Caucasian school girl while riding a crowded bus. But unlike the Japanese woman that Hada saw in Japan, the American girl screams. Hada runs away, but is robbed and beaten by a mugger. Meanwhile, several innocent Asian men are beaten by bystanders who suspect that {{one of them is the}} man who groped the girl.|$|R
