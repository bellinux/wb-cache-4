5|$|Bill C-10 (previously Bill C-33), among a {{long list}} of minor changes to tax law {{contained}} a controversial clause that would give the government power to deny taxation benefits for films made in Canada if the government deems the content to be objectionable. David Cronenberg and Sarah Polley argued it is equivalent to censorship because most Canadian films cannot afford to be produced without government assistance. The Bill was passed in the House October 29, 2007, but opposition parties later <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> did not notice the controversial part and several Senators have <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> intend to send the Bill back to the House.|$|E

5|$|Corythosaurus is {{currently}} {{classified as a}} hadrosaurid, in the subfamily Lambeosaurinae. It is related to other hadrosaurs such as Hypacrosaurus, Lambeosaurus and Olorotitan, {{with the exception of}} Olorotitan they all share similar looking skulls and crests. However, research published in 2003 has suggested that even though it possesses a unique crest, Olorotitan is Corythosaurus closest known relative. Benson et al. (2012) found that Corythosaurus was closely related to Velafrons, Nipponosaurus, and Hypacrosaurus, and <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> formed a group of fan-crested lambeosaurines.|$|E
