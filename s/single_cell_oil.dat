New strategies to valorize these wastes are attracting a great scientific interest due to the important advantages offered from an economic and environmental point of view. A microbial platform can be established to convert low-value hydrophobic substrates, such as waste cooking oils, to microbial lipids (<b>single</b> <b>cell</b> <b>oil,</b> SCO) and other value-added bioproducts, such as lipase.

30|$|Lipids are {{produced}} by all microorganisms (MOs) usually {{in the range of}} 6 to 8 % per dry biomass principally as components for the cell membrane. However, oleaginous microorganisms, including yeasts, bacteria, filamentous fungi and microalgae, convert a carbon source when it is available in excess into intracellular triacylglycerols (TAG) as soon as a nitrogen limitation occurs (Ratledge [2002]). These lipids are also called <b>single</b> <b>cell</b> <b>oils</b> (SCO) and are stored as lipid droplets within cells.|$|R
40|$|A brief {{overview}} is provided of the microbial <b>oils</b> (<b>single</b> <b>cell</b> <b>oils</b> - SCOs) that have been, or are still being, produced commercially. Oils rich in gamma-linolenic acid (18 : 3 n- 6), arachidonic acid (20 : 4 n- 6), eicosapentaenoic acid (20 : 5 n- 3) and docosahexaenoic acid (22 : 6 n- 3) are covered.

40|$|Algal {{oils and}} oils rich in alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), and gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) {{have been used}} for the {{treatment}} {{of a wide range of}} nutritional and clinical disorders. The algal oils of interest were arachidonic acid <b>single</b> <b>cell</b> <b>oil</b> (ARASCO), docosahexaenoic acid <b>single</b> <b>cell</b> <b>oil</b> (DRASCO), and a <b>single</b> <b>cell</b> <b>oil</b> rich in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and docosapentaenoic acid (n- 6 DPA) (OMEGA-GOLD oil). Flax oil contains ALA, and hemp oil is rich in both ALA and GLA. Little information is available about the oxidative stability of these nutritional oils and their bioactive minor constituents. Therefore, this research was initiated to evaluate the oxidative stability of flax, hemp, ARASCO, DRASCO, and OMEGA-GOLD oil, as well as their minor component-stripped counterparts, in the dark at 60 °C and under fluorescent light at 2 rc. Several analytical methods were used to assess the oxidative stability of these oils. Oil extracts were also investigated for their radical scavenging activity towards the stable 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical by a spectrophotometric method and measuring their total phenolic contents. [...] The results indicate that bioactive constituents of these nutritional oils play a major role in their oxidative stability in the dark as well as in the light. However, the fatty acid composition of the oil and the total tocopherols as well as the type of pigments present contribute to their stability. It was found that non-stripped flax and hemp were more stable than their corresponding stripped counterparts. However, non-stripped hemp oil had a higher oxidative stability than non-stripped flax oil as indicated in radical scavenging activity towards DPPH radical and total phenolic contents. On the other hand, DHASCO contains a significant level of natural radical scavengers and phenolic compounds that contribute to its higher stability compared to ARASCO and the OMEGA-GOLD oil. The results demonstrate the importance of minor oil components on their oxidative stability, which will reflect on their food and supplement value as well as shelf life...|$|E

40|$|In {{the search}} for {{biofuels}} which are not competing with food, oleaginous micro-organisms gain increased interest. Specific strains of yeast, algae, fungi and bacteria can produce intracellular <b>oil</b> (<b>single</b> <b>cell</b> <b>oils)</b> under specific growth conditions. Besides {{the selection of the}} micro-organisms, the optimization of the growth conditions and downstream processing, new analytical methods have to be developed to monitor the whole process and to evaluate the final products. In order to analyze the <b>single</b> <b>cell</b> <b>oils,</b> different objectives can be set: (1) total lipid content, (2) fatty acid profile and (3) lipid classes. Each of these objectives need a different approach and will give information about the capacity to optimize the process and about the valorization potential of the final products. This research is focused on the development of methods that are robust, sensitive, labour and cost effective and that give a maximum of information. Most lipid analysis methods and techniques nowadays include two steps: (1) extraction of the lipids, followed by (2) a transesterification reaction. The new method that will be presented combines both steps into one single step and allows determination of the total lipid content and fatty acid profile in an easy way. The method will be compared with a classical method and an enhanced classical method using microwave assisted extraction, followed by a transesterification reaction. Information with respect to the fatty acid profile in function of the growth conditions can be obtained.

40|$|Polyunsaturated {{fatty acids}} (PUFAs) of the - 3 and - 6 class (e. g. -linolenic acid, {{linoleic}} acid) {{are essential for}} maintaining biofunctions in mammalians like humans. Due {{to the fact that}} humans cannot synthesize these essential fatty acids, they must be taken up from different food sources. Classical sources for these fatty acids are porcine liver and fish oil. However, microbial lipids or <b>single</b> <b>cell</b> <b>oils,</b> produced by oleaginous microorganisms such as algae, fungi and bacteria, are a promising source as well. These <b>single</b> <b>cell</b> <b>oils</b> can be used for many valuable chemicals with applications not only for nutrition but also for fuels and are therefore an ideal basis for a bio-based economy. A crucial point for the establishment of microbial lipids utilization is the cost-effective production and purification of fuels or products of higher value. The fermentative production can be realized by submerged (SmF) or solid state fermentation (SSF). The yield and the composition of the obtained microbial lipids depend on the type of fermentation and the particular conditions (e. g. medium, pH-value, temperature, aeration, nitrogen source). From an economical point of view, waste or by-product streams can be used as cheap and renewable carbon and nitrogen sources. In general, downstream processing costs are one of the major obstacles to be solved for full economic efficiency of microbial lipids. For the extraction of lipids from microbial biomass cell disruption is most important, because efficiency of cell disruption directly influences subsequent downstream operations and overall extraction efficiencies. A multitude of cell disruption and lipid extraction methods are available, conventional as well as newly emerging methods, which will be described and discussed in terms of large scale applicability, their potential in a modern biorefinery and their influence on product quality. Furthermore, an overview is given about applications of microbial lipids or derived fatty acids with emphasis on food applications...|$|R
30|$|The {{accumulated}} oil (stored TAGs) in {{the cells}} of oleaginous microorganisms act as a carbon store to maintain essential metabolic processes {{in the event of}} subsequent carbon starvation (Anderson and Wynn 2001). It is also suggested that in case of marine microorganisms the accumulation of large lipid droplets in the cytosol acts as an aid to buoyancy (Anderson and Wynn 2001). The oil produced can be investigated and exploited as alternative sources of oils and fats for human consumption (Ratledge 2005) and can also be used as feedstocks for biodiesel production (Li et al. 2008).The objective {{of this study was to}} characterize and identify oleaginous yeasts from natural sources in Ethiopia and produce <b>single</b> <b>cell</b> <b>oil</b> as a feedstock for biodiesel production in the future.|$|E
30|$|The {{results in}} this {{research}} work suggest that much more oleaginous yeasts can be isolated from Ethiopian environment.

Traditional identification methods (morphological and physiological) must be complemented with molecular method of identification especially the use of ITS and D 1 /D 2 domains of the 26 S rRNA gene sequencing. To improve the production of lipid from oleaginous yeasts, cultivation conditions for lipid production by oleaginous yeasts should be optimized, oleaginous yeasts should be subjected to mutagenesis or genetically engineered to select the best strains with the highest lipid production capacity, and cheap substrates like lignocellulosic wastes and sugar factory by-products have to be used for cultivation purpose to minimize cost of production.|$|E
40|$|Yarrowia lipolytica is a {{promising}} platform for <b>single</b> <b>cell</b> <b>oil</b> production. It is well-known for its metabolism oriented toward utilization of hydrophobic substrates and accumulation of storage lipids. Multiple copies of DGA 2 under constitutive promoter were {{introduced into the}} Q 4 strain, a quadruple mutant deleted for the four acyltransferases (Delta dga 1, Delta dga 2, Delta lro 1, and Delta are 1) to improve lipid accumulation. The Q 4 -DGA 2 x 3 strain contains three copies of DGA 2. Further increase in accumulation was accomplished by blocking the beta-oxidation pathway through MFE 1 gene deletion yielding Q 4 -Delta mfe DGA 2 x 3. In order to use molasses as a substrate for <b>single</b> <b>cell</b> <b>oil</b> production, sucrose utilization was established by expressing the Saccharomyces cerevisiae SUC 2 gene yielding Q 4 -SUC 2 DGA 2 x 3 and Q 4 -Delta mfe SUC 2 DGA 2 x 3. During cultivation on sucrose medium with a carbon to nitrogen ratio of 80, both strains accumulated more than 40 % of lipids, which was a 2 -fold increase in lipid storage. Q 4 -Delta mfe SUC 2 DGA 2 x 3 accumulated more lipids than Q 4 -SUC 2 DGA 2 x 3 (49 vs. 43 %) but yielded less biomass (13. 7 vs. 15 g/L). When grown on 8 % (v/v) molasses, both strains accumulated more than 30 % of lipids after 3 days, while biomass yield was higher in Q 4 -SUC 2 DGA 2 x 3 (16. 4 vs. 14. 4 g/L). Further addition of molasses at 72 h resulted in higher biomass yield, 26. 6 g/L for Q 4 -SUC 2 DGA 2 x 3, without modification of lipid content.

40|$|Currently, <b>single</b> <b>cell</b> <b>oils</b> (SCO) attract much {{attention}} {{because of their}} bi-function as a supplier of functional oils and feedstock for biodiesel production. However, high fermentation costs prevent their further application, and the possibility and potential of their industrialization is suspected. Therefore, various low-cost, hydrophilic and hydrophobic substrates were utilized for SCO production. Of these substrates, lignocellulosic biomass, {{which is the most}} available and renewable source in nature, might be an ideal raw material for SCO production. Although many reviews on SCO have been published, few have focused on SCO production from low-cost substrates or evaluated the possibility and potential of its industrialization. Therefore, this review mainly presents information on SCO and its production using low-cost substrates and mostly focuses on lignocellulosic biomass. Finally, the possibility and potential of SCO industrialization is evaluated. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

Free fatty acids in bacteria are normally either metabolized or employed as a building part of the plasma membrane. However, they can be accumulated as part of TAGs in organisms capable of storing these neutral lipids. This accumulation also facilitates its extraction. The TAGs produced in any cell are constituted by the fatty acids occurring in its cytoplasm. Therefore, a change in the fatty acid pool in a WS/DGAT –encoding bacteria lead to the production of modified TAGs. Our objective is obtaining bacteria capable of producing and accumulating highly value-added TAGs by enriching its fatty acid pool in PUFA. Máster en Biología Molecular y Biomedicin...|$|E

Five commercially available lipase preparations from Candida antarctica, Mucor miehei, Pseudomonas sp., Aspergillus niger and Candida rugosa were initially used as biocatalysts for {{the incorporation of}} capric acid (CA) into selected algal oils. The algal oils of interest were arachidoinc acid <b>single</b> <b>cell</b> <b>oil</b> (ARASCO), docosahexaenoic acid <b>single</b> <b>cell</b> <b>oil</b> (DHASCO) and <b>single</b> <b>cell</b> <b>oil</b> rich in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and docosapentaenoic acid (DP A) (OMEGA-GOLD). Among the lipases examined, Pseudomonas sp. was the most efficient. [...] Effects of various reaction variables, namely the mole ratio of substrates, enzyme amount, time course, temperature {{and the amount of}} added water were examined for Pseudomonas sp. Response surface methodology was used to obtain a maximum incorporation of CA into algal oils. The process variables studied were the amount of enzyme (2 - 12 %), reaction temperature (25 - 55 °C) and incubation time (12 - 48 h). All experiments were conducted according to a face-centred cube design. Under optimum conditions (12. 3 % of enzyme; 45 °C; 29. 4 h), the incorporation of CA was 20. 0 % into ARASCO. Optimization of acidolysis of DHASCO with CA gave rise to a maximum of 22. 6 % at 4. 2 % enzyme amount, and a reaction temperature of 43. 3 °C and reaction time of 27. 1 h. Similarly, the maximum incorporation of CA into the OMEGA-GOLD oil was obtained when enzyme amounts, reaction temperature and time were 2. 5 %, 46. 6 °C and 25. 2 h, respectively. [...] Stereospecific analysis was performed to establish positional distribution of fatty acids on the glycerol backbone of modified ARASCO, DHASCO and the OMEGA-GOLD oil. In all oils examined CA was mainly located at the sn- 1 and sn- 3 positions of the triacylglycerol (TAG) molecules. In ARASCO-based SL, arachidonic acid (ARA) was mostly esterified at the sn- 2 position of the glycerol backbone. In DHASCO-based SL, DHA was concentrated in the sn- 2 position, but also present in the sn- 1, 3 positions. DHA or DP A were preferentially esterified at the sn- 2 position of the modified OMEGA-GOLD oil. [...] The oxidative stabilities of enzymatically modified oils as well as their unmodified counterparts were assessed under Schaal oven conditions at 60 °C over a 72 h storage period. Conjugated dienes (CD), and 2 -thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were used to follow the primary and secondary products of oxidation, respectively. Among the oils tested, the structured lipids (SL) of ARASCO, DHASCO, and the OMEGA-GOLD oil had higher conjugated dienes than those of their unmodified counterparts. TBARS values of modified DHASCO were significantly higher than their origin oil at all times. TBARS values of both modified and unmodified ARASCO increased gradually over the entire storage period. TBARS values of the OMEGA-GOLD-based SL increased steadily with increasing storage time. The results presented in this study suggest that enzymatically modified oils are more susceptible to oxidation than their unmodified counterparts. However, when the three oils (ARASCO, DHASCO and the OMEGA-GOLD) were subjected to the same procedure steps, the stabilities of the oils were adversely affected to a large extent.

Interestingly, the Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway was upregulated in detriment of the glycolysis or pentose phosphate pathways. ED induction was independent of the carbon source (either gluconate or glucose). Some of the diacylglycerol acyltransferase genes involved in the last step of the Kennedy pathway were also upregulated. A common feature of the promoter region of most upregulated genes was the presence of a consensus binding sequence for the cAMPdependent CRP regulator. Conclusion: This is the first experimental observation of an ED shift under nutrient starvation conditions. Knowledge of this switch could help in the design of metabolomic approaches to optimize carbon derivation for <b>single</b> <b>cell</b> <b>oil</b> production...|$|E

In this study, infants received study formula (17 mg DHA/ 100 kcal) with a commercially-available (Control: n= 140; DHASCO®) or alternative (DHASCO®-B: n= 127) DHA <b>single</b> <b>cell</b> <b>oil</b> from 14 to 120 days of age. No significant group differences were detected for growth rates by gender through 120 days of age. Blood fatty acids at 120 days of age were assessed by capillary column gas chromatography in a participant subset (Control: n= 34; DHASCO-B: n= 27). The 90 % confidence interval (91 – 104 %) for the group mean (geometric) total RBC DHA (µg/mL) ratio fell within the pre-specified equivalence limit (80 – 125 %), establishing study formula equivalence with respect to DHA. This study demonstrated infant formula with DHASCO-B was safe, well-tolerated, and associated with normal growth. Furthermore, DHASCO and DHASCO-B represented equivalent sources of DHA as measured by circulating RBC DHA...|$|E
40|$|<b>Single</b> <b>cell</b> <b>oil</b> (SCO) is an {{attractive}} energy source due to scalability, utilization of low-cost renewable feedstocks, and type of product(s) made. Engineering strains capable of producing high lipid titers and yields {{is crucial to the}} economic viability of these processes. However, lipid synthesis in cells is a complex phenomenon subject to multiple layers of regulation, making gene target identification a challenging task. In this study, we aimed to identify genes in the oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica whose overexpression enhances lipid production by this organism. To this end, we examined the effect of the overexpression of a set of 44 native genes on lipid production in Y. lipolytica, including those involved in glycerolipid synthesis, fatty acid synthesis, central carbon metabolism, NADPH generation, regulation, and metabolite transport and characterized each resulting strain’s ability to produce lipids growing on both glucose and acetate as a sole carbon source. Our results suggest that a diverse subset of genes was effective at individually influencing lipid production in Y. lipolytica, sometimes in a substrate-dependent manner. The most productive strain on glucose overexpressed the diacylglycerol acyltransferase DGA 2 gene, increasing lipid titer, cellular content, and yield by 236, 165, and 246 %, respectively, over our control strain. On acetate, our most productive strain overexpressed the acylglycerol-phosphate acyltransferase SLC 1 gene, with a lipid titer, cellular content, and yield increase of 99, 91, and 151 %, respectively, over the control strain. Aside from genes encoding enzymes that directly catalyze the reactions of lipid synthesis, other ways by which lipogenesis was increased in these cells include overexpressing the glycerol- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD 1) gene to increase production of glycerol head groups and overexpressing the 6 -phosphogluconolactonase (SOL 3) gene from the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway to increase NADPH availability for fatty acid synthesis. Taken together, our study demonstrates that the overall kinetics of microbial lipid synthesis is sensitive {{to a wide variety of}} factors. Fully optimizing a strain for <b>single</b> <b>cell</b> <b>oil</b> processes could involve manipulating and balancing many of these factors, and, due to mechanistic differences by which each gene product investigated here impacts lipid synthesis, there is a high likelihood that many of these genes will work synergistically to further increase lipid production when simultaneously overexpressed.

40|$|Microorganisms {{have been}} {{receiving}} increased attention {{as sources of}} novel lipids. Those that accumulate more than 20 - 25 % of their biomass as oil may be termed oleaginous and their <b>oils</b> <b>single</b> <b>cell</b> <b>oils</b> (SCOs), unicellular oils or microbial oils. For the lipid accumulation in yeasts, moulds and eukaryotic algae, but not in bacteria, the presence of enzyme ATP-cytrate lyase is of vital importance. This enzyme serves to produce acetyl-CoA, which is the substrate for fatty acid biosynthesis. Nitrogen limitation is {{the most frequently used}} condition to favour lipid accumulation. Oleaginous organisms differ from nonoleaginous ones in being able to convert carbon from the growth medium into the intracellular lipid, after the nitrogen has been depleted from the medium, provided that the supply of carbon stays plentiful. Biosynthetic pathways of n- 6 and n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids from the saturated and monounsaturated precursors with the chain elongations and desaturations are presented. The suitability of an microalgal triglyceride-SCO highly enriched in docosahexaenoic acid (DHASCO ®) as a source for nutritional supplementation for formula milk is compared to fish oil.

In this context, with the aim of increasing the sustainability of biodiesel production through the utilization of its main by product, we are investigating the possibility of utilizing raw glycerol for the industrial production of microbial biomass and secondary metabolites of interest in feed, food and pharmaceutical industries. To do that we are carrying out yeast batch fermentation trials on glycerol containing media under full aerobic condition and evaluating both biomass and secondary metabolites production. The results of the selection of yeast cultures able to efficiently utilize raw glycerol, in terms of biomass and secondary metabolites yields per time unit and per gram of glycerol utilized, and the individuation of the chemical-physical parameters able to enhance microbial growth in view of the maximization of the production will be presented.
