In the Swedish folktale Little Rosa and Long Leda, an elvish woman (älvakvinna) {{arrives in the}} end and saves the heroine, Little Rose, on condition that the king's cattle no longer graze on her hill. She {{is described as a}} beautiful old woman and by her aspect people <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> belonged to the subterraneans.|$|E
5|$|While {{searching for}} her father, Binder's long-estranged {{daughter}} Natasha (Yancy Butler) is attacked {{by a group of}} muggers who <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had a lot of cash earlier. She is saved by a homeless man with exceptional martial-arts skills named Chance Boudreaux (Jean-Claude Van Damme), a former Marine Force Recon. Chance is initially hesitant to involve himself with her mission, but as his merchant seaman union dues are in arrears he reluctantly allows Natasha to hire him as her guide and bodyguard during her search. Meanwhile, Chance's homeless friend Elijah Roper (Willie C. Carpenter) is the next to participate in Fouchon's hunt, and is also killed.|$|E
25|$|According to Polyaenus, when Artemisia <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{was near}} to {{falling into the}} hands of the Greeks, she ordered the Persian colours to be taken down, and the master of the ship to bear down upon and attack a Persian vessel of the Calyndian allies, which was {{commanded}} by Damasithymus, that was passing by her.|$|E

500|$|On April 11, 2011, it was {{reported}} by MTV News that [...] "Whiplash" [...] would be recorded by Selena Gomez & the Scene for their third studio album When the Sun Goes Down. Lead singer Selena Gomez is a Spears fan, and after Kurstin played her the track for the first time, she [...] "fell in love with it", unaware of Spears's contribution to the song. Gomez explained, [...] "I came and sang and <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had co-written it, so I was very excited. [...] It was an honor and I'm completely stoked." [...] The song leaked online in early June 2011, several weeks prior to the album's release.|$|E
500|$|Frank {{frequently}} {{wrote of}} her difficult {{relationship with her}} mother, and of her ambivalence towards her. On 7 November 1942 she described her [...] "contempt" [...] for {{her mother and her}} inability to [...] "confront her with her carelessness, her sarcasm and her hard-heartedness," [...] before concluding, [...] "She's not a mother to me." [...] Later, as she revised her diary, Frank felt ashamed of her harsh attitude, writing: [...] "Anne, is it really you who mentioned hate, oh Anne, how could you?" [...] She came to understand that their differences resulted from misunderstandings that were as much her fault as her mother's, and <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had added unnecessarily to her mother's suffering. With this realization, Frank began to treat her mother with a degree of tolerance and respect.|$|E
500|$|Froissart {{writes of}} the meeting in his Chronicles, saying that Isabeau stood {{motionless}} while being inspected, exhibiting perfect behavior {{by the standards of}} her time. Arrangements were made for the two to be married in Arras, but on the first meeting Charles felt [...] "happiness and love enter his heart, for he <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was beautiful and young, and thus he greatly desired to gaze at her and possess her". She did not yet speak French and may not have reflected the idealized beauty of the period, perhaps inheriting her mother's dark Italian features, then unfashionable, but Charles most certainly approved of her because the couple were married three days later. Froissart documented the royal wedding, joking about the lascivious guests at the feast and the [...] "hot young couple".|$|E

500|$|The {{final scene}} of the episode ended with a tape of a young Olivia in a fire-damaged room, leading to rumors her {{character}} was a fire starter. Torv however discounted this soon after, explaining [...] "I think it's more than that... I think what they got given or what they got taught is much bigger than just starting fire". Jeff Pinkner agreed and elaborated further, [...] "We saw the consequence. We <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> started a fire {{at the end of}} the last episode, but I think it's a mistake to assume that that's her power. I think the truth is, it's probably a consequence of her ability". This particular scene, as well as the episode's reference to experiments Walter performed on children, comprise the main plot of the season three episode [...] "Subject 13".|$|E
500|$|The only {{artillery}} {{support for}} the troops making these tentative advances was from the navy. Finding targets difficult to spot, and in fear of hitting their own troops, the big guns of the battleships and cruisers concentrated fire on the flanks of the beaches. The destroyers {{were able to get}} in closer, and from 08:00 began engaging their own targets. At 09:50, two minutes after the [...] destroyed a 75mm gun position in WN-74, the destroyers were ordered to get as close in as possible. Some approached within 1,000 yards (900m) several times, scraping bottom and risking running aground. An engineer who had landed in the first wave at Fox Red, watching the Frankford steaming in towards shore, thought she had been badly hit and was being beached. Instead, she turned parallel to the beach and cruised westwards, guns blazing at targets of opportunity. Thinking she would turn back out to sea, the engineer soon <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had instead begun backing up, guns still firing. At one point, gunners aboard the Frankford saw an immobilized tank at the water's edge, still firing. Watching the fall of its shot, they followed up with a salvo of their own. In this manner, the tank acted as the ship's fire control party for several minutes.|$|E
2500|$|In 1983, Rebecca Welles {{arranged}} {{to see her}} mother {{for the first time}} in seven years. Speaking to his lifelong friend Roger Hill, Orson Welles expressed his concern about the visit's effect on his daughter. [...] "Rita barely knows me now," [...] Welles said. He recalled seeing Hayworth three years before at an event which the Reagans held for Frank Sinatra. [...] "When it was over, I came over to her table and I <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was very beautiful, very reposed looking, and didn't know me at first. After about four minutes of speaking, I could see that she realized who I was, and she began to cry quietly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall know," [...] he said; but he <b>saw</b> clearly <b>that</b> <b>she</b> did not {{understand}} him. Her face had a strange, brooding, shut-away look, {{as though he had}} frightened her. And the thought <b>that</b> <b>she</b> could {{not understand}}, angered him.|$|R

2500|$|When Stirling {{first saw}} Congress he sailed towards her, {{in the hope}} that she was a {{privateer}} of twenty 9-pounder guns that had been raiding in the area. However, when he got closer and <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was significantly stronger even than the privateer he thought she might be, Stirling attempted an escape. However, by 10:30 am the Americans came within range and opened fire with their bow chasers. By 11:00 Congress had closed the distance and her crew engaged with muskets and pistols, to which the British replied with [...] "energy". At this point Captain Geddes observed that his ship was faster than that of the enemy so he maneuvered ahead of Savage until almost abreast, in preparation for a broadside.|$|E
2500|$|... 28th May, 1719. I {{went to see}} {{her last}} Sunday, the 23rd May, and found her in a sad state, {{suffering}} from pains in her toes and the soles of her feet until the tears came into her eyes. I went away because I <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> refrained from crying out on my account. I thought {{she was in a}} bad way. A consultation was held by her three physicians, the result of which was that they determined to bleed her in the feet. They had some difficulty in persuading her to submit to it, because the pain in her feet was so great that she uttered the most piercing screams if the bedclothes only rubbed against them. The bleeding, however, succeeded, and she was in some degree relieved. It was the gout in both feet ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{the reading}} {{continues}} in chapter [...] having borne no children after 10 years in Canaan, Sarai bade Abram to consort with her Egyptian maidservant Hagar, so that Sarai {{might have a}} son through her, and Abram did as Sarai requested. When Hagar <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had conceived, Sarai was lowered in her esteem, and Sarai complained to Abram. Abram told Sarai that her maid was in her hands, and Sarai treated her harshly, so Hagar ran away. An angel of God found Hagar by a spring {{of water in the}} wilderness, and asked her where she came from and where she was going, and she replied that she was running away from her mistress. The angel told her to go back to her mistress and submit to her harsh treatment, for God would make Hagar's offspring too numerous to count; she would bear a son whom she should name Ishmael, for God had paid heed to her suffering. Ishmael would be a wild donkey of a man, with his hand against everyone, and everyone's hand against him, but he would dwell alongside his kinsmen. Hagar called God [...] "El-roi," [...] meaning that she had gone on seeing after God saw her, and the well was called Beer-lahai-roi. And when Abram was 86 years old, Hagar bore him a son, and Abram gave him the name Ishmael. A closed portion ( [...] , setumah) ends here with the end of chapter ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the third}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), Jacob loved Rachel, {{and offered to}} serve Laban seven years for Rachel's hand, and Laban agreed. Jacob served the years, but his love for Rachel made them seem like just a few days. Jacob asked Laban for his wife, and Laban made a feast and invited all {{the men of the}} place. In the evening, Laban brought Leah to Jacob, and Jacob slept with her. Laban gave Leah Zilpah to be her handmaid. In the morning, Jacob {{discovered}} that it was Leah, and he complained to Laban that he had served for Rachel. Laban replied that in that place, they did not give the younger before the firstborn, but if Jacob fulfilled Leah's week, he would give Jacob both daughters in exchange for another seven years of service. Jacob did so, and Laban gave him Rachel to wife, and gave Rachel Bilhah to be her handmaid. Jacob loved Rachel more than Leah, so God allowed Leah to conceive, but Rachel was barren. Leah bore a son, and called him Reuben, saying that God had looked upon her affliction. She bore a second son, and called him Simeon, saying that God had heard that she was hated. She bore a third son, and called him Levi, saying that this time her husband would be joined to her. She bore a fourth son, and called him Judah, saying that this time, she would praise God. Rachel envied her sister, and demanded that Jacob give her children, but Jacob grew angry and asked her whether he was in God's stead, who had withheld children from her. Rachel told Jacob to sleep with her maid Bilhah, so that Bilhah might bear children upon Rachel's knees who might be credited to Rachel, and he did. Bilhah bore Jacob a son, and Rachel called him Dan, saying that God had judged her and also heard her voice. And Bilhah bore Jacob a second son, and Rachel called him Naphtali, saying that she had wrestled with her sister and prevailed. When Leah <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had stopped bearing, she gave Jacob her maid Zilpah to wife. Zilpah bore Jacob a son, and Leah called him Gad, saying that fortune had come. And Zilpah bore Jacob a second son, and Leah called him Asher, saying that she was happy, for the daughters would call her happy. The third reading ( [...] , aliyah) ends here.|$|E
