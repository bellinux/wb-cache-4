50|$|When Class 12A {{locomotives}} numbers 1540 and 2135 {{became the}} first to be reboilered in 1943, however, none of the Watson <b>Standard</b> <b>boilers</b> were deemed suitable since the Watson Standard no. 2 series were too small, while the no. 3 series were too large. A special boiler was therefore designed for them by Dr. M.M. Loubser, the CME at the time. These boilers did not conform to any of the Watson <b>Standard</b> <b>boilers</b> and were a totally new type of rather massive proportions which, on a locomotive with relatively small coupled wheels, created an impression of great power. Certain features common to the Watson <b>Standard</b> <b>boilers</b> were incorporated in the design, however, since it was deemed necessary to have the greatest possible degree of interchangeability of parts with those of the Watson <b>Standard</b> <b>boilers.</b> The boiler size was between that of the Watson Standard numbers 2 and 3 boilers.|$|R

50|$|During 1939, while W.A.J. Day was the CME of the SAR, the Classes MJ and MJ1 were {{modified}} {{slightly to}} be reboilered {{with the same}} <b>standard</b> <b>boiler,</b> once again with Belpaire fireboxes.|$|E
50|$|The rest of {{the fleet}} {{remained}} unmodified and, unlike their Classes 10A, 10B and 10C successors, were never reboilered with Watson <b>Standard</b> <b>boilers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Since {{the only}} {{difference}} between the as-delivered Class 15 and Class 15A lay in the length of their boilers and whether they were built with or without combustion chambers, both models were reclassified to Class 15AR when they were reboilered with Watson <b>Standard</b> <b>boilers.</b> In the case of the Class 15A engines, reboilering replaced their combustion-chambered Belpaire boilers with less efficient Watson <b>Standard</b> <b>boilers</b> without combustion chambers and {{it was found that the}} rebuilds were inferior steamers compared with their non-rebuilt sister engines.|$|R
5000|$|Soon after A.G. Watson was {{appointment}} as Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) of the South African Railways (SAR) in 1929, {{he set out}} on a program of standardisation of locomotive boilers and engine parts, which ultimately led to a considerable reduction in the time taken for locomotive repairs. To cut down on maintenance costs, he abandoned the Belpaire firebox altogether and reverted to the round-top type. He was also opposed to the use of combustion chambers. At the time, 88 different types of locomotive were in service, for which some fifty types of replacement boiler were still being ordered prior to 1929. Watson introduced seven <b>standard</b> <b>boilers,</b> later to become known as the Watson <b>Standard</b> <b>boilers.</b> Locomotives which were reboilered with Watson <b>Standard</b> <b>boilers</b> were reclassified with an additional [...] "R" [...] suffix (for reboilered) to their Class numbers.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1930s, many serving {{locomotives}} were reboilered with a <b>standard</b> <b>boiler</b> type, {{designed by}} Watson {{as part of}} his standardisation policy.

50|$|In 1925 {{two were}} rebuilt with the then newly {{developed}} number 10 <b>standard</b> <b>boiler</b> and high domed cab by the GWR. In this form they were visually {{akin to a}} smaller version of the GWR 5600 Class introduced in 1924.|$|E

50|$|Five Class 19A locomotives, numbers 678, 693, 696, 700 and 706, were reboilered with Watson <b>Standard</b> no. 1A <b>boilers</b> and {{designated}} Class 19AR. In the reboilering process, {{at least}} two of the Class 19AR locomotives, numbers 693 and 696, received domeless boilers from the first batch of Class 19D locomotives which were delivered new with domeless Watson <b>Standard</b> <b>boilers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Only {{one of the}} Class 5B locomotives, no. 725, was {{eventually}} reboilered with a Watson Standard no. 1 boiler and reclassified to Class 5BR. While the original boiler was fitted with Ramsbottom safety valves, the Watson <b>Standard</b> <b>boiler</b> was fitted with Pop safety valves.|$|E

50|$|Drummond's T7 and E10 {{worked with}} simple {{expansion}} {{so that the}} principle benefit sought would be the increased grate area. Compared with Drummond's <b>standard</b> <b>boilers,</b> the T7's barrel length was increased from 10 feet 6 inches to 12 feet.|$|R
50|$|The 1930s Chief Mechanical Engineer of the South African Railways, A.G. Watson, {{adopted a}} {{somewhat}} similar method for his largest Watson <b>Standard</b> <b>boilers,</b> which came {{so close to}} the upper limits of the loading gauge that there was insufficient space for a steam dome.|$|R
50|$|The reboilered Class 19AR {{locomotives}} gained {{less than}} a ton in weight during the modification process. While most locomotive classes which were reboilered with Watson <b>Standard</b> <b>boilers</b> were simultaneously equipped with Watson cabs with slanted fronts, some of the Class 19AR locomotives retained their original cabs with vertical fronts.|$|R
50|$|In 1935, the South African Railways placed fifty Class 19C steam {{locomotives}} with a 4-8-2 Mountain {{type wheel}} arrangement in service. It {{was the first}} South African locomotive class to use rotary cam poppet valve gear and also {{the first to be}} built new with a Watson <b>Standard</b> <b>boiler.</b>|$|E
50|$|Their {{original}} boilers were {{fitted with}} Ramsbottom safety valves, while the Watson <b>Standard</b> <b>boiler</b> was fitted with Pop safety valves. Even though the boiler pressure {{setting of the}} reboilered engine was lowered from , the tractive effort increased from 24860 to 25750 lbf kN at 75% of boiler pressure.|$|E
5000|$|During the 1930s, many serving {{locomotives}} were reboilered with a <b>standard</b> <b>boiler</b> type {{designed by}} A.G.

50|$|The Watson <b>Standard</b> <b>boilers</b> are {{interchangeable}} between locomotives. In {{the process}} of locomotives undergoing major overhauls, these twenty Krupp-built domeless boilers migrated between engines during subsequent years. As a result, locomotives from the other builders and even some Classes 19A and 19C locomotives eventually ended up {{with some of these}} domeless boilers.|$|R
50|$|While {{most other}} SAR {{locomotives}} with Belpaire fireboxes were later reboilered with the Watson <b>Standard</b> <b>boilers</b> which {{were introduced in}} the 1930s, no Class 11 locomotive ever underwent this modification. They served in the SAR for seventy years plus several more years in industrial service while retaining the distinctive appearance which comes with a Belpaire firebox.|$|R
50|$|Between August 1895 and August 1900, the {{locomotives}} {{had their}} original <b>boilers</b> replaced by <b>standard</b> <b>boilers</b> of Worsdell design, {{of a type}} also used on several other NER locomotives, such as the '901' and '1440' classes, Class L, Class O and Class P. The new boilers had slightly smaller fireboxes, but had increased heating surface and water circulation space compared to the originals.|$|R
50|$|Although the Lancashire boiler is {{considered}} to be an antiquated design, provided that the flue is long enough it can be reasonably efficient. This does lead to a bulky boiler though, particularly for its length, and this has always limited its use to stationary installations. It was the <b>standard</b> <b>boiler</b> in Greater Manchester and Lancashire cotton mills.|$|E
50|$|Their {{original}} Belpaire boilers were {{fitted with}} Ramsbottom safety valves, while the Watson <b>Standard</b> <b>boiler</b> was fitted with Pop safety valves. The reboilered engines were also equipped with Watson cabs with their distinctive slanted fronts, {{compared to the}} conventional vertical fronts of their original cabs. Early conversions were equipped with copper and later conversions with steel fireboxes.|$|E
50|$|Much of {{its initial}} work was in {{refurbishing}} older locomotives with new boilers and covered cabs. In 1906, C.H. Riches {{who had been}} at Gorton locomotive works became Locomotive Superintendent and appointed J.H. Sellars as Works Foreman. Their policy was to modernise and standardise the locomotive stock, and Riches designed a <b>standard</b> <b>boiler</b> and cylinders for all the railway's tank engines.|$|E
50|$|By 1952, {{the need}} arose for {{shunting}} locomotives {{with a light}} axle load for harbour work, {{where most of the}} trackwork was laid with light rail. Under the direction of L.C. Grubb, Chief Mechanical Engineer of the South African Railways (SAR) from 1949 to 1954, specifications were prepared for a light locomotive with the 0-8-0 wheel arrangement which had already been proven successful with the Classes S and S1 shunting engines. To keep the total weight of the engine and tender down to approximately 100 lt t, it was to be equipped with the Watson <b>Standard</b> no. 1 <b>boiler,</b> the smallest of the <b>standard</b> <b>boilers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{first five}} Watson <b>Standard</b> <b>boilers</b> to be {{designed}} were the numbers 1, 1A, 2, 2A and 2B. The no. 1 boiler was suitable for the Classes 5, 5B, 10A, 10B and 10C. The no. 1A boiler {{was similar to the}} no. 1, but with the boiler barrel lengthened by 2 ft, and was suitable for the Classes 19, 19A and 19B. The Classes 19C and 19D were built new with no. 1A boilers.|$|R
