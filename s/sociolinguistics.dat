5|$|The {{academic}} {{study of}} language is conducted within many different disciplinary areas and from different theoretical angles, {{all of which}} inform modern approaches to linguistics. For example, descriptive linguistics examines the grammar of single languages, theoretical linguistics develops theories {{on how best to}} conceptualize and define the nature of language based on data from the various extant human languages, <b>sociolinguistics</b> studies how languages are used for social purposes informing in turn the study of the social functions of language and grammatical description, neurolinguistics studies how language is processed in the human brain and allows the experimental testing of theories, computational linguistics builds on theoretical and descriptive linguistics to construct computational models of language often aimed at processing natural language or at testing linguistic hypotheses, and historical linguistics relies on grammatical and lexical descriptions of languages to trace their individual histories and reconstruct trees of language families by using the comparative method.|$|E
5|$|This view of {{language}} {{is associated with}} the study {{of language}} in pragmatic, cognitive, and interactive frameworks, as well as in <b>sociolinguistics</b> and linguistic anthropology. Functionalist theories tend to study grammar as dynamic phenomena, as structures that are always in the process of changing as they are employed by their speakers. This view places importance on the study of linguistic typology, or the classification of languages according to structural features, as it can be shown that processes of grammaticalization tend to follow trajectories that are partly dependent on typology. In the philosophy of language, the view of pragmatics as being central to language and meaning is often associated with Wittgenstein's later works and with ordinary language philosophers such as J. L. Austin, Paul Grice, John Searle, and W. O. Quine.|$|E

25|$|Catalan <b>sociolinguistics</b> {{studies the}} {{situation}} of Catalan {{in the world and}} the different varieties that this language presents.

25|$|The {{study of}} parole (which manifests through {{cultural}} discourses and dialects) is {{the domain of}} <b>sociolinguistics,</b> the sub-discipline that comprises the study of a complex system of linguistic facets within a certain speech community (governed by {{its own set of}} grammatical rules and laws). Discourse analysis further examines the structure of texts and conversations emerging out of a speech community's usage of language. This is done through the collection of linguistic data, or through the formal discipline of corpus linguistics, which takes naturally occurring texts and studies the variation of grammatical and other features based on such corpora (or corpus data).|$|E
25|$|<b>Sociolinguistics</b> is {{the study}} of how {{language}} is shaped by social factors. This sub-discipline focuses on the synchronic approach of linguistics, and looks at how a language in general, or a set of languages, display variation and varieties at a given point in time. The study of language variation and the different varieties of language through dialects, registers, and ideolects can be tackled through a study of style, as well as through analysis of discourse. Sociolinguists research on both style and discourse in language, and also study the theoretical factors that are at play between language and society.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{inception}} of the discipline of linguistics, linguists have been concerned with describing and analysing previously undocumented languages. Starting with Franz Boas in the early 1900s, this became the main focus of American linguistics until the rise of formal structural linguistics in the mid-20th century. This focus on language documentation was partly motivated by a concern to document the rapidly disappearing languages of indigenous peoples. The ethnographic dimension of the Boasian approach to language description {{played a role in the}} development of disciplines such as <b>sociolinguistics,</b> anthropological linguistics, and linguistic anthropology, which investigate the relations between language, culture, and society.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to being entertaining stories or important myths {{about the nature of}} the world, narratives also convey the importance of aboriginal environmental management knowledge such as fish spawning cycles in local rivers or the disappearance of grizzly bears from Oregon. Hymes believes that all narratives in the world are organized around implicit principles of form which convey important knowledge and ways of thinking and of viewing the world. He argues that understanding narratives will lead to a fuller understanding of the language itself and those fields informed by storytelling, in which he includes ethnopoetics, <b>sociolinguistics,</b> psycholinguistics, rhetoric, semiotics, pragmatics, narrative inquiry and literary criticism.|$|E
25|$|The {{study of}} Internet {{linguistics}} can be effectively done through four main perspectives: <b>sociolinguistics,</b> education, stylistics and applied. Further dimensions have {{developed as a}} result of further technological advancements which include the development of the Web as Corpus and the spread and influence of the stylistic variations brought forth by the spread of the Internet, through the Mass Media and Literary Works. In view of the increasing number of users connected to the Internet, the linguistics future of the Internet remains to be determined as new computer-mediated technologies continue to emerge and people adapt their languages to suit these new media. The Internet continues to {{play a significant role in}} both encouraging as well as diverting attention away from the usage of languages.|$|E
25|$|Historical {{linguistics}} {{emerged as}} an independent field of study {{at the end of}} the 18th century. Sir William Jones proposed that Sanskrit, Persian, Greek, Latin, Gothic, and Celtic languages all shared a common base. After Jones, an effort to catalog all languages of the world was made throughout the 19th century and into the 20th century. Publication of Ferdinand de Saussure's Cours de linguistique générale created the development of descriptive linguistics. Descriptive linguistics, and the related structuralism movement caused linguistics to focus on how language changes over time, instead of just describing the differences between languages. Noam Chomsky further diversified linguistics with the development of generative linguistics in the 1950s. His effort is based upon a mathematical model of language that allows for the description and prediction of valid syntax. Additional specialties such as <b>sociolinguistics,</b> cognitive linguistics, and computational linguistics have emerged from collaboration between linguistics and other disciplines.|$|E
25|$|James Paul Gee {{was born}} in San José, California. He {{received}} his B.A. in philosophy from the University of California at Santa Barbara and both his M.A. and Ph.D in linguistics from Stanford University. He started his career in theoretical linguistics, working in syntactic and semantic theory, and taught initially at Stanford University {{and later in the}} School of Language and Communication at Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts. After doing some research in psycholinguistics at Northeastern University in Boston and at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in the Netherlands, Prof. Gee's research focus switched to studies on discourse analysis, <b>sociolinguistics,</b> and applications of linguistics to literacy and education. He went on to teach in the School of Education at Boston University, where he was the chair of the Department of Developmental Studies and Counseling, and later in the Linguistics Department at the University of Southern California. At Boston University he established new graduate programs centered around an integrated approach to language and literacy, combining programs in reading, writing, bilingual education, ESL, and applied linguistics. From 1993 to 1997 he held the Jacob Hiatt Chair in Education in the Hiatt Center for Urban Education at Clark University in Massachusetts. From 1997 until 2007, he held the Tashia Morgridge Professor of Reading at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.|$|E
500|$|In 1996 Penny Lee's reappraisal of Whorf's {{writings}} was published, reinstating Whorf as {{a serious}} and capable thinker. Lee argued that previous explorations of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis had largely ignored Whorf's actual writings, and consequently asked questions very unlike those Whorf had asked. Also in that year a volume, [...] "Rethinking Linguistic Relativity" [...] edited by John J. Gumperz and Stephen C. Levinson gathered a range of researchers working in psycholinguistics, <b>sociolinguistics</b> and linguistic anthropology to bring renewed attention {{to the issue of}} how Whorf's theories could be updated, and a subsequent review of the new direction of the linguistic relativity paradigm cemented the development. Since then considerable empirical research into linguistic relativity has been carried out, especially at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics with scholarship motivating two edited volumes of linguistic relativity studies, and in American Institutions by scholars such as Lera Boroditsky and Dedre Gentner.|$|E
500|$|The {{linguistic}} variable, {{a similar}} concept presented by William Labov, refers to features with variations that are referentially identical but carry social and stylistic meaning. [...] This could include phonological, {{as well as}} morphological and syntactic phenomena. Labov also developed variable rules analysis, with variable rules being those that all members of a speech community (presumably) possess but vary {{in the frequency of}} use. The latter concept met resistance from scholars {{for a number of reasons}} including the argument from critics that knowledge of rule probabilities was too far from speakers' competence. [...] Because of these problems, use of variable rules analysis died down by the end of the 1980s. Nevertheless, the linguistic variable is still used in <b>sociolinguistics.</b> For Labov, grouping variants together was justified by their tendency to fluctuate between each other within the same set of words. [...] For example, Labov presented the variants (among New York speakers) of the vowel of bad or dance: ...|$|E
500|$|The LSA holds a four-week {{biennial}} Linguistic Institute in {{the summer}} which includes talks and coursework on various aspects of linguistics. Considered by the membership {{to be one of}} the most important services of the LSA, the Institute has helped influence the development of the field through promotion of new directions such as psycholinguistics and <b>sociolinguistics.</b> Each Institute features a number of endowed Chairs named after prominent linguists: [...] the Sapir chair in general linguistics, [...] the Collitz Chair in historical linguistics, and since 2005, the Ken Hale chair in linguistic fieldwork and the preservation of endangered languages. The newest endowed professorship is named after the late LSA President Charles Fillmore. The LSA also endows a series of student fellowships, named after prominent linguists and family members. These include fellowships named for Ken Hale, James McCawley, Ivan Sag, and Julia Bloch. The Bloch fellow also serves a simultaneous appointment to the LSA's Executive Committee and as the Chair of its Student Committee. As of 2017, the LSA is planning for two additional fellowships, the first named after Charles Fillmore, and the second named after Yuki Koroda.|$|E

2500|$|As {{the status}} of Egyptian Arabic vis-à-vis Classical Arabic can have such {{political}} and religious implications in Egypt, {{the question of whether}} Egyptian Arabic should be considered a [...] "dialect" [...] or [...] "language" [...] can be a source of debate.

2500|$|Another {{factor that}} {{may have contributed to}} the {{relative}} neglect of creole languages in linguistics is that they do not fit the 19th-century neogrammarian [...] "tree model" [...] for the evolution of languages, and its postulated regularity of sound changes (these critics including the earliest advocates of the wave model, Johannes Schmidt and Hugo Schuchardt, the forerunners of modern <b>sociolinguistics).</b> This controversy of the late 19th century profoundly shaped modern approaches to the comparative method in historical linguistics and in creolistics.|$|E

2500|$|Charleston {{is part of}} Kanawha County.
