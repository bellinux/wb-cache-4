The production was cancelled and Boddington was killed the following year in an air crash during filming of the movie Von Richthofen & Brown.

25|$|With {{triggered}} <b>sweeps,</b> <b>the</b> scope will blank {{the beam}} {{and start to}} reset the sweep circuit each time the beam reaches the extreme {{right side of the}} screen. For a period of time, called holdoff, (extendable by a front-panel control on some better oscilloscopes), the sweep circuit resets completely and ignores triggers. Once holdoff expires, the next trigger starts a sweep. The trigger event is usually the input waveform reaching some user-specified threshold voltage (trigger level) in the specified direction (going positive or going negative—trigger polarity).|$|E

25|$|A replica Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2c {{was used}} in the {{production}} of the BBC Great War drama series Wings which aired in 1977–1978. The replica was originally commissioned in 1969 by Universal Studios for a proposed big-budget film Biggles <b>Sweeps</b> <b>the</b> Skies but the project was cancelled after the aircraft was built. The replica was constructed by engineer and pilot Charles Boddington who was later killed during the making of the 1971 film Von Richthofen & Brown. His son Matthew recently rebuilt the aircraft (after it was badly damaged in an accidental crash in the United States) and it flew again at Sywell aerodrome, UK, in 2011.|$|E

25|$|The sweep {{method is}} quick {{and works in}} most cases, as the DV usually just drops down on the diver's right side. In this method the diver is usually face down to upright, and <b>sweeps</b> <b>the</b> right hand across the waist from left to right, around to the back, {{in contact with the}} body or scuba set, and round as far back as {{possible}} against the cylinder, the straightens the arm backwards and swings it around outwards and forwards in an arc until it is pointing forwards. This will normally capture the hose {{to the front of the}} arm, where the left hand can find it by sweeping along the arm from the right hand to the neck. This method will fail if the DV has been swept over to the left side of the cylinder.|$|E

25|$|On 22 June 1810 Ortenzia was off {{the coast}} of Calabria. When , Commander John Toup Nicholas, arrived, Blaquiere {{informed}} Toup that a French convoy of 51 vessels were anchored off Cirella, a small town some 30 miles south of the Gulf of Policastro. The next day Pilot and Ortenzia came up under <b>sweeps,</b> <b>the</b> wind being calm, and observed that the convoy was under the escort of five settees and eight gunboats. Ortensia, assisted by boats from Pilot chased the convoy, firing on it. The British succeeded in causing five of the largest merchant vessels to run ashore north of the town and some of the others to seek refuge under a battery. However, the arrival of more escorts and the tiredness of the British sailors, who had been at the sweeps for nine hours, led Toup to call off the attack. In the evening Pilots boats tried to destroy the vessels on the beach, but heavy small arms fire drove them off. Pilot and Ortenzia then destroyed the vessels with gunfire. British casualties included three men killed.|$|E
