The <b>Secure</b> <b>Shell</b> client is configured to redirect data from a specified local port through the secure tunnel to a specified destination host and port. This port is on the same computer as the <b>Secure</b> <b>Shell</b> client.

Each layer can focus on a smaller set of functionality, thus reducing the effort required for the development as well as the testing and maintenance of each component. The proposed architecture, along with a set of pilot applications such as <b>secure</b> remote <b>shell,</b> <b>secure</b> web services, local login and digital signature, has been developed and tested on various platforms, including Open BSD, Linux, Solaris and Mac OS X, proving effectiveness of the new approach. ...|$|R

New hash algorithm RNA-FINNT is generated in this research paper for converting minutiae points into hashed code. Value of hashed code would be stored at the Database in the Multi Server environment of an organization.

Every year, researches, both private and public, are adding {{to the number of}} possible threats to the security of web servers, and coming up with possible solutions to them. A number of these solutions are considered to be expensive, complex, and incredibly time-consuming, while not able to create the perfect web to challenge any breach to the server security. In the study that follows, an attempt will be made to check whether a particular firewall can ensure a strong security measure and deal with some security breaches or severe threat to an existing web server. The research conducted has been done with the CSF Firewall, which provides a suit of scripts that ensure a portal’s security through a number of channels. The experiments conducted under the research provided extremely valuable insights about the application in hand, and the number of ways the CSF Firewall can help in safety of a portal against <b>Secured</b> <b>Shell</b> (SSH) attacks, dedicated to break the security of it, in its initial stages. It further goes to show how simple it is to actually detect the prospective attacks, and subsequently stop the Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, as well as the port scans made to the server, with the intent of breaching the security, by finding out an open port. By blocking the IP Addresses of the attackers dedicated to such an act, preventing them from creating nuisance, the CSF Firewall has been able to keep alien intrusions away from the server. It also aids in creating a secure zone for the server, to continue smoothly, while alerting the server administrators of the same, and gives them an opportunity to check those threatening IPs, and the time of attack, makes sure that the server administrators stay alert in the future, and is able {{to keep an eye on}} such attacks.

This structure utilizes the benefits of carbon fiber, honeycomb sub structure and a spring damper mounting system to lower impact force. This structure is tested and refined using a composite solver package called Ansys pre-post. Results from this study conclude that the structure is capable of providing safety for the rider in sudden impacts up to 25 mph both by limiting maximum deceleration and by maintaining structural integrity.

60|$|I rode into Vicksburg {{with the}} troops, {{and went to}} the river to {{exchange}} congratulations with the navy upon our joint victory. At that time I found that many of the citizens had been living under ground. The ridges upon which Vicksburg is built, and those back to the Big Black, are composed of a deep yellow clay of great tenacity. Where roads and streets are cut through, perpendicular banks are left and stand as well as if composed of stone. The magazines of the enemy were made by running passage-ways into this clay at places where there were deep cuts. Many citizens secured places of safety for their families by carving out rooms in these embankments. A door-way in these cases would be cut in a high bank, starting from the level of the road or street, and after running in a few feet a room of the size required was carved out of the clay, the dirt being removed by the door-way. In some instances I saw where two rooms were cut out, for a single family, with a door-way in the clay wall separating them. Some of these were carpeted and furnished with considerable elaboration.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the syntheses, characterizations, and applications of novel type-II quantum dots and versatile oligomeric phosphine ligands. Type-II band engineered quantum dots (CdTe/CdSe(core/shell) and CdSe/ZnTe(core/shell) heterostructures) are synthesized by chemical means. The optical properties of these type-II quantum dots are studied {{in parallel with}} their type-I counterparts. The spatial distributions of carriers are controlled within the type-II quantum dots, which make their properties strongly governed by the band offset of the comprising materials. This allows access to optical transition energies that are not restricted to bandgap energies. The type-II quantum dots can emit at lower energies than the bandgaps of comprising materials. The type-II emission can be tailored by the shell thickness {{as well as the}} core size. The enhanced control over the carrier distributions afforded by these type-II materials is useful for many applications such as photovoltaics, and photoconduction devices. A new family of oligomeric alkyl phosphine ligands is synthesized for quantum dots. These oligomeric phosphines show effective binding affinity to quantum dot surfaces. They form thin and <b>secure</b> organic <b>shells</b> that stabilize quantum dots in diverse environments. They maintain high photoluminescence quantum yield of the quantum dots, and enable homogeneous incorporation into various matrices. They present a chemically flexible structure {{that can be used for}} further chemistry, such as crosslinking, co-polymerization, and conjugation to biomolecules. Selection of optimal quantum dot wavelengths for biomedical assays and imaging is studied by simple mathematical modeling. (cont.) Exploiting the design flexibilities of type-II quantum dots and the superior stabilities from oligomeric phosphine ligands, aqueous soluble near-infrared quantum dots for biomedical imaging are obtained. They are optimized for the emission wavelength, absorption cross-section, hydrodynamic size, and photoluminescence quantum yield. Using these quantum dots in small and large animal model systems, sentinel lymph node mapping, a major cancer staging procedure, is successfully performed in real-time using near-infrared light. Oliogomeric phosphine ligands with polymerizable moieties are used to incorporate quantum dots into polymer microspheres. The ligands enable co-polymerization of quantum dots with heterogeneous polymer matrices without phase separations or aggregations. Their potential applications for full color, particle-based displays, and information storage are demonstrated. by Sungjee Kim. Thesis (Ph. D.)
