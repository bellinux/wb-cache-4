5000|$|For {{this second}} step, the Basic Method adopted the {{traditional}} liability coverage test {{that had long}} been imposed by the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") and other [...] "self regulatory" [...] exchanges on their members and by the SEC on broker-dealers that were not members of such an exchange. Using that approach, the SEC required that a broker-dealer subject to the Basic Method maintain [...] "net capital" [...] equal to at least 6-2/3% of its [...] "aggregate indebtedness." [...] This is {{commonly referred to as}} a 15 to 1 leverage limit, because it meant [...] "aggregate indebtedness" [...] could not be more than 15 times the amount of [...] "net capital." [...] "Aggregate indebtedness", however, excluded [...] "adequately secured debt", subordinated debt and other <b>specified</b> <b>liabilities,</b> so that even the Basic Method did not limit to 15 to 1 a broker-dealer's overall leverage computed from a GAAP financial statement.|$|E

[...] Each Seattle PDA is governed by a volunteer council that oversees PDA activities and staff.|$|R
50|$|The United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia ruled Norfolk Southern could {{limit its}} {{liability}} to Kirby {{on the basis}} of the Himalaya clause in the Hamburg Süd contract. As the Himalaya clause in the Hamburg Süd bill incorporated COGSA, which <b>specified</b> that <b>liability</b> was limited to $500 per package, and the shipment was packed in ten containers, Norfolk Southern's total liability was therefore $5000. On the joint motion of the parties, the district court certified its order for interlocutory appeal.|$|R
40|$|Antitrust law {{is moving}} away from rules (ex ante, limited factor {{liability}} determinants) and toward standards (ex post, multi-factor liability determinants). This movement has important consequences for the structure of antitrust adjudication, including shifting ultimate decision-making down the legal hierarchy (in the direction of juries, trial courts sitting as fact-finders, and administrative agencies) and increasing the importance of economic experts. The efficiency consequences of this trend are often negative. <b>Specifying</b> <b>liability</b> determinants as open-ended, unpredictable standards increases litigation costs, chills socially beneficial industrial practices, allocates decision-making on microeconomic policy to unqualified juries, and facilitates strategic misuse of antitrust litigation by rent-seeking competitors. Instead of following a generalized preference for standards, courts should consider five factors in choosing the ex ante precision of liability determinants: (1) whether the lawsuit was brought by the government or a private party; (2) whether the legal determinant would create liability or immunize against it; (3) whether the remedy sought is prospective (i. e., injunctive) or retrospective (i. e., damages); (4) whether the conduct is idiosyncratic or paradigmatic; and (5) whether the misconduct alleged is collusion or exclusion. A standard-based approach is most appropriate to create liability in public litigation seeking injunctive relief against idiosyncratic practices. A rule-based approach is most appropriate when used to immunize archetypal forms of industrial behavior from private actions for damages...|$|R
50|$|In law, strict {{liability}} {{is a standard}} for liability which may exist in either a criminal or civil context. A rule <b>specifying</b> strict <b>liability</b> makes a person legally responsible for the damage and loss caused by his/her acts and omissions regardless of culpability (including fault in criminal law terms, typically the presence of mens rea). Under {{strict liability}}, there is no requirement to prove fault, negligence or intention. Strict liability is prominent in tort law (especially product liability), corporations law, and criminal law. For analysis of {{the pros and cons}} of strict liability as applied to product liability, the most important strict liability regime, see product liability.|$|R
40|$|This {{rigorous}} thesis {{deals with}} delictual lialibility of individuals undertaking business and legal entities within environmental protection. Under delictual liability we mean certain secondary liability {{to suffer the}} consequences of one's actions which arises {{in case of a}} violation of certain primary liability, usually set by a legal norm. Within the protection of environment, we encounter the term ecological-legal liability. Delictual <b>liability</b> can be <b>specified</b> as <b>liability</b> within administrative and criminal law, accompanied by environmental liability. There is no unified amendment for the first one within environmental protection and particular actus reus of regulatory offence can be therefore found in particular component laws. Administrative delicts of legal entities and individuals undertaking business then form an independent part of law and they are punished more severly than deliquencies of individuals. As far as criminal liability is concerned, its amendement is incorporated into the criminal code. Also, the criminal liability law for legal entities came into effect in 2012. The thesis also comprises the comparison with the Slovak legislation...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} of the National Risk Assessment Partnership (NRAP) program {{is to develop a}} defensible, generalized, and science-based methodology and platform for quantifying risk profiles at CO 2 injection and storage sites. The methodology must incorporate and define the scientific basis for assessing residual risks associated with long-term stewardship and help guide site operational decision-making and risk management. Development of an integrated and risk-based protocol will help minimize uncertainty in the predicted long-term behavior of the CO 2 storage site and thereby increase confidence in storage integrity. The risk profile concept has proven useful in conveying the qualitative evolution of risks for CO 2 injection and storage site. However, qualitative risk profiles are not sufficient for <b>specifying</b> long-term <b>liability</b> for CO 2 storage sites. Because there has been no science-based defensible and robust methodology developed for quantification of risk profiles for CO 2 injection and storage, NRAP has been focused on developing a science-based methodology for quantifying risk profiles for various risk proxies...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} thesis is to {{independently}} describe and analyze various assumptions upon which arises the liability to damages according to regulation in OZ. The emphasis is being placed particularly on damage {{to health and}} associated claims, i. e. compensation for pain and social impairment. A substantial part {{is devoted to the}} method and amount of compensation, particularly with regard to the adoption of a new concept, which is to be indemnified loss in full accordance to the principles of decency, if case it cannot be determined otherwise. In addition, it was necessary to deal with other non-pecuniary injuries which include injuries caused by mental distress. The thesis is, besides introduction and conclusion (the first and fifth chapter), composed of three main chapters. The second chapter is devoted to the relationship between two seemingly independently existing phenomena of recent time, and those are law and sport. First, it defines the concept of sport through its characteristics, which is followed by the actual relationship between law and sport. Further, the thesis describes a problematic existence of the branch of Sports law. The third chapter reports on the institute of legal liability under the laws of the Czech Republic, first in general, then <b>specifying</b> the <b>liability</b> arising from [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Telemedicine has proliferated {{throughout}} much of the industrialized world. Initially, telemedicine was considered simply as an enabling technique for increasing access to health-care in remote or isolated regions and as a valuable tool for health-care emergencies. Nowadays, telemedicine is maturing, moving beyond the proof-ofconcept stage towards use as a tool for routine health-care delivery. Increasing access to and quality of care seemto be the main objectives in deploying telemedicine in Europe, as elsewhere. Moreover, telemedicine is moving towards home-care applications, especially for elderly and chronic patients (‘dehospitalization’). However, there are problems connected with the use of telemedicine. Besides the technical barriers, such as different telecommunication infrastructures and standards, there is still a paucity of assessments of telemedicine applications. Telemedicine activity in existing projects is low, reliable cost-effectiveness analyses are difficult, and its financial and economic consequences are still unclear. In addition, the medical profession is often resistant to the changes produced by telemedicine, and organizational and management changes are needed (e. g. financial reimbursement and the surmounting of medicolegal issues 4). At present there are no clear laws that govern telemedicine activity or <b>specify</b> professional <b>liability,</b> or that ensure the privacy, security and confidentiality of medical data. Another theme of major importance concerns the education and training needed to overcome barriers generated by inexperience and cultural resistance to change. The TELEPLANS Project was a ‘Concerted Action’ funded by the European Commission DGXIII. Its objectives were to describe the European scenario for telemedicine and to establish a forum to bring together national health-care authorities, key decision makers and users of telemedical applications...|$|R

3000|$|The State Council {{released}} its “Circular of Opinions on Accelerating Mergers and Restructuring of Coal Mines” 12 in 2010, requesting nationwide rectification {{of the coal}} mining industry. The guiding principle of rectification as provided in this document is to “make full use of the market mechanism and facilitate it with state policies … combine enforcement in accordance with laws and regulations with institutional and mechanism innovations, {{reduce the number of}} coal mines while protecting the lawful rights of workers and investors.” The central objectives are to combine the market mechanism and state intervention to eliminate inefficient coal mines through selection or competition, upgrade the industrial structure, and protect the rights of investors and workers. S Province did not take the implementation of this state policy very seriously and only created its rules of implementation in early 2013. The provincial rules abide by the guiding principle of the State Council by stating that it is to “make full use of the market mechanism and facilitate it with state policies, combine centralized planning with adaption to local conditions and classified management, combine enforcement in accordance with laws and regulations with institutional and mechanism innovations, reduce the number of coal mines while protecting the lawful rights of workers and investors,” 13 and specify that coal mines that do not have legal mining licenses and do not meet safety-in-production criteria, coal resources-exhausted mines, and mines of which the annual production output is below 30, 000  t have to be shut down and rectified. This document also required counties specializing in the coal mining industry to create their work plans before June 2013, make initial efforts to shut down coal mines that did not have legal mining licenses and did not meet safety-in-production criteria, and complete the merger and restructuring of all coal mines by June 2015. It was repeated again and again that the interests of various stakeholders should be protected: “all localities and all departments should attach great importance to the employment of workers, carefully handle the transfers and changes of labor relations of workers … carefully solve the problems of continuing workers’ labor relations and social insurance and unpaid wages and social insurance premiums in order to protect workers’ lawful rights … and cope with problems in debts and <b>liabilities,</b> <b>specify</b> the duties of repayment of debts, and protect the lawful rights of creditors and investors.” [...]...|$|R
