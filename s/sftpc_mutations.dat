40|$|ABSTRACT: Interstitial pneumonias have {{recently}} been associated with mutations in the gene encoding surfactant protein C (SFTPC). In particular, <b>SFTPC</b> <b>mutations</b> {{have been reported in}} a number of familial forms of pulmonary fibrosis and in infants with interstitial lung diseases. The present study searched for <b>SFTPC</b> <b>mutations</b> in adult patients with sporadic idiopathic interstitial pneumonia. In total, 35 adult patients with sporadic idiopathic interstitial pneumonia and 50 healthy subjects were investigated for <b>SFTPC</b> <b>mutations</b> by direct DNA sequencing. Of the patients with sporadic idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, 25 suffered from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and 10 patients from nonspecific interstitial pneumonia. Only two frequent nonsynonymous variants, T 138 N and S 186 N, were detected. Allele frequencies of both variations as well as of other identified noncoding alterations did not differ significantly between the diverse patient groups and control subjects. In conclusion, mutations in the gene encoding surfactant protein C are not common in sporadic cases of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, suggesting that the mutated gene does not {{play an important role in}} the pathogenesis of these forms of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAim of {{the study}} Determine {{high-resolution}} tomography (HRCT) scan characteristics in children with SFTPC mutation and correlate them to histological findings. Patients and Methods This retrospective multicenter study included 15 children (7 females and 8 males) with <b>SFTPC</b> <b>mutations.</b> HRCT scans have been performed in all the children and lung biopsies in 8 children. Results From all signs assessed on initial HRCT scans, ground-glass opacities (n= 14, 93 %) and lung cysts (n= 6, 40 %) were predominant. Interlobular septal thickening (n= 1, 7 %), air space consolidation (n= 1, 7 %), paraseptal emphysema (n= 2, 13 %), and pulmonary nodules (n= 1, 7 %) were also found. Histological analysis revealed accumulation of macrophages in the alveolar lumen, type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, and alveolar septal thickening. Dilatation of the respiratory bronchiole and alveolar duct associated with muscular hyperplasia were also described. Interestingly, lung cysts on HRCT scans were associated with dilatation of terminal bronchioli and alveolar duct in lung biopsies. Conclusion In children with <b>SFTPC</b> <b>mutations,</b> HRCT scan finding were highly correlated to the histological findings and, as such, represent a useful tool to identify patients that may require SFTPC gene sequencing...|$|E
40|$|Patients with {{interstitial}} {{lung disease}} due to surfactant protein C (<b>SFTPC)</b> <b>mutations</b> are rare and not well characterised. We report on all subjects collected over a 15 -year period in the kids-lung register with {{interstitial lung disease}} and a proven SFTPC mutation. We analysed clinical courses, interventions and outcomes, as well as histopathological and radiological interrelations. 17 patients (seven male) were followed over a median of 3  years (range 0. 3 - 19). All patients were heterozygous carriers of autosomal dominant <b>SFTPC</b> <b>mutations.</b> Three mutations (p. L 101 P, p. E 191  K and p. E 191 *) have not been described before {{in the context of}} surfactant protein C deficiency. Patients with alterations in the BRICHOS domain of the protein (amino acids 94 - 197) presented earlier. At follow-up, one patient was healthy (2  years), six patients were "sick-better" (2. 8  years, range 0. 8 - 19), seven patients were "sick-same" (6. 5  years, 1. 3 - 15. 8) and three patients were "sick-worse" (0. 3  years, 0. 3 - 16. 9). Radiological findings changed from ground-glass to increasing signs of fibrosis and cyst formation with increasing age. Empiric treatments had variable effects, also in patients with the same genotype. Prospective studies with randomised interventions are urgently needed and can best be performed in the framework of international registers. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|A {{man with}} usual {{interstitial}} pneumonia (age of onset 58 years) was previously {{found to have}} an Ile 73 Thr (I 73 T) surfactant protein C (<b>SFTPC)</b> <b>mutation.</b> Genomic DNA from the individual and two daughters (aged 39 and 43 years) was sequenced for the I 73 T mutation and variations in ATP-binding cassette A 3 (ABCA 3). All three had the I 73 T <b>SFTPC</b> <b>mutation.</b> The father and one daughter (aged 39 years) also had a transversion encoding an Asp 123 Asn (D 123 N) substitution in ABCA 3. The daughters were evaluated by pulmonary function testing and high-resolution CT (HRCT). Neither daughter had evidence of disease, except for focal subpleural septal thickening on HRCT scan in one daughter (aged 39 years). This daughter underwent bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsies revealing interstitial fibrotic remodeling. These findings demonstrate that subclinical fibrotic changes may be present in family members of patients with SFTPC mutation-associated interstitial lung disease and suggest that ABCA 3 variants could affect disease pathogenesis...|$|R

40|$|Background: While {{idiopathic}} {{pulmonary fibrosis}} (IPF) {{is one of the}} most common forms of interstitial lung disease, the aetiology of IPF is poorly understood. Familial cases of pulmonary fibrosis suggest a genetic basis for some forms of the disease. Recent reports have linked genetic mutations in surfactant protein C (SFTPC) with familial forms of pulmonary fibrosis, including one large family in which a number of family members were diagnosed with usual interstitial pneumonitis (UIP), the pathological correlate to IPF. Because of this finding in familial cases of pulmonary fibrosis, we searched for <b>SFTPC</b> <b>mutations</b> in a cohort of sporadic cases of UIP and non-specific interstitial pneumonitis (NSIP) ...|$|E
40|$|SummaryDominant {{mutations}} in the surfactant protein-C(SFTPC) gene {{have been linked}} with interstitial lung disease. The frequency of lung disease due to <b>SFTPC</b> <b>mutations</b> {{in the general population}} is unknown. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify novel <b>SFTPC</b> <b>mutations</b> that are associated with lung function or disease in the general population. We resequenced the SFTPC gene in 760 individuals and identified 18 genetic variants, of which 5 were novel. Of the five novel mutations, two were situated in highly conserved areas of the SFTPC gene: A 53 T and Y 106 X. We genotyped the Copenhagen City Heart Study(n= 10, 604) and the Copenhagen General Population Study(n= 37, 337) to assess the clinical relevance of these mutations. Genotyping identified 36 individuals heterozygous for A 53 T and 3 individuals heterozygous for Y 106 X. A 53 T heterozygotes and Y 106 X heterozygotes did not differ from non-carriers in FEV 1 % predicted, FVC% predicted or FEV 1 /FVC. A 53 T heterozygotes had a two-fold increased risk for asthma in the Copenhagen City Heart Study and Copenhagen General Population Study combined (adjusted odds ratio 2. 2 (1. 0 – 4. 9)). A 53 T heterozygotes did not differ consistently from non-carriers in risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or interstitial lung disease. No Y 106 X heterozygotes suffered from asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or interstitial lung disease. We identified two novel {{mutations in}} highly conserved areas of the SFTPC gene, and show that heterozygotes for the mutations have normal lung function and are unaffected by COPD and interstitial lung disease. A 53 T heterozygotes had increased asthma risk, but further research is required to conclusively determine whether this mutation is associated with asthma...|$|E
40|$|Mutations in {{the gene}} {{encoding}} SP-C (surfactant protein C; SFTPC) {{have been linked}} to interstitial lung disease (ILD) in children and adults. Expression of the index mutation, SP-CΔexon 4, in transiently transfected cells and type II cells of transgenic mice resulted in misfolding of the proprotein, activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathways, and cytotoxicity. In this study, we show that stably transfected cells adapted to chronic ER stress imposed by the constitutive expression of SP-CΔexon 4 via an NF-κB–dependent pathway. However, the infection of cells expressing SP-CΔexon 4 with respiratory syncytial virus resulted in significantly enhanced cytotoxicity associated with accumulation of the mutant proprotein, pronounced activation of the unfolded protein response, and cell death. Adaptation to chronic ER stress imposed by misfolded SP-C was associated with increased susceptibility to viral-induced cell death. The wide variability in the age of onset of ILD in patients with <b>SFTPC</b> <b>mutations</b> may be related to environmental insults that ultimately overwhelm the homeostatic cytoprotective response...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Heterozygous <b>mutations</b> of <b>SFTPC,</b> {{the gene}} {{encoding}} surfactant protein C (SP-C), cause sporadic and familial {{interstitial lung disease}} (ILD) in children and adults. The most frequent <b>SFTPC</b> <b>mutation</b> in ILD patients leads to a threonine for isoleucine substitution at position 73 (I 73 T) of the SP-C preprotein (proSP-C), however {{little is known about}} the cellular consequences of SP-C I 73 T expression. Results To address this, we stably expressed SP-C I 73 T in cultured MLE- 12 alveolar epithelial cells. This resulted in increased intracellular accumulation of proSP-C processing intermediates, which matched proSP-C species recovered in bronchial lavage fluid from patients with this mutation. Exposure of SP-C I 73 T cells to drugs currently used empirically in ILD therapy, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, hydroxychloroquine or methylprednisolone, enhanced expression of the chaperones HSP 90, HSP 70, calreticulin and calnexin. SP-C I 73 T mutants had decreased intracellular phosphatidylcholine level (PC) and increased lyso-PC level without appreciable changes of other phospholipids. Treatment with methylprednisolone or hydroxychloroquine partially restored these lipid alterations. Furthermore, SP-C I 73 T cells secreted into the medium soluble factors that modulated surface expression of CCR 2 or CXCR 1 receptors on CD 4 + lymphocytes and neutrophils, suggesting a direct paracrine influence of SP-C I 73 T on neighboring cells in the alveolar space. Conclusion We show that I 73 T mutation leads to impaired processing of proSP-C in alveolar type II cells, alters their stress tolerance and surfactant lipid composition, and activates cells of the immune system. In addition, we show that some of the mentioned cellular aspects behind the disease can be modulated by application of pharmaceutical drugs commonly applied in the ILD therapy. </p...|$|R
40|$|Familial {{interstitial}} {{lung disease}} (ILD) is defined as presence of ILD in 2 or more family members. Surfactant protein C (SFTPC) gene mutations are rare, but well-known cause of familial ILD. We reported a 20 -year-old male, who was referred for lung transplantation. He was symptomatic at age 3 and underwent surgical lung biopsy at age 6, which revealed a nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) pattern. Genetic workup revealed a novel SFTPC mutation in the first intron with a C to A transversion. At age 21, he underwent bilateral lung transplantation. Explanted lung histology suggested NSIP. In addition there was pulmonary neuroendocrine cell (PNEC) hyperplasia and carcinoid tumorlets. His mother had undergone lung transplantation several years earlier, and her explanted lung showed similar pathology. <b>SFTPC</b> <b>mutations</b> are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Various types of ILD {{have been associated with}} SFTPC mutation including NSIP, usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), and desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP). PNEC hyperplasia has been described to occur in association with lung inflammation but has not been previously described with familial ILD associated with SFTPC mutation...|$|E

Given that familial pulmonary fibrosis (FPF) and RA-ILD frequently share the usual pattern of interstitial pneumonia and common environmental risk factors, we hypothesised that the two diseases might share additional risk factors, including FPF-linked genes. Our aim was to identify coding mutations of FPF-risk genes associated with RA-ILD. We used whole exome sequencing (WES), followed by restricted analysis of a discrete number of FPF-linked genes and performed a burden test to assess the excess number of mutations in RA-ILD patients compared to controls. Among the 101 RA-ILD patients included, 12 (11. 9 %) had 13 WES-identified heterozygous mutations in the TERT, RTEL 1, PARN or SFTPC coding regions. The burden test, based on 81 RA-ILD patients and 1010 controls of European ancestry, revealed an excess of TERT, RTEL 1, PARN or <b>SFTPC</b> <b>mutations</b> in RA-ILD patients (OR 3. 17, 95 % CI 1. 53 - 6. 12; p= 9. 45 x 10 - 4).

40|$|Background: Interstitial {{lung disease}} (ILD) is a {{heterogeneous}} group of rare diseases that primarily affect the pulmonary interstitium. Studies have implicated {{a role for}} telomere length (TL) maintenance in ILD, particularly in idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP). Here, we measure TL in {{a wide spectrum of}} sporadic and familial cohorts of ILD and compare TL between patient cohorts and control subjects. Methods: A multiplex quantitative polymerase chain reaction method was used to measure TL in 173 healthy subjects and 359 patients with various ILDs, including familial interstitial pneumonia (FIP). The FIP cohort was divided into patients carrying TERT mutations, patients carrying SFTPA 2 or <b>SFTPC</b> <b>mutations,</b> and patients without a proven mutation (FIP-no mutation). Results: TL in all cases of ILD was significantly shorter compared with those of control subjects (P range:. 038 to <. 0001). Furthermore, TL in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) was significantly shorter than in patients with other IIPs (P =. 002) and in patients with sarcoidosis (P <. 0001). Within the FIP cohort, patients in the FIP-telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) group had the shortest telomeres (P <. 0001), and those in the FIP-no mutation group had TL comparable to that of patients with IPF (P =. 049). Remarkably, TL of patients with FIP-surfactant protein (SFTP) was significantly longer than in patients with IPF, but similar to that observed in patients with other sporadic IIPs. Conclusions: The results show telomere shortening across all ILD diagnoses. The difference in TL between the FIP-TERT and FIP-SFTP groups indicates the distinction between acquired and innate telomere shortening. Short TL in the IPF and FIP-no mutation groups is indicative of an innate telomere-biology defect, while a stress-induced, acquired telomere shortening might be the underlying process for the other ILD diagnoses...|$|E
