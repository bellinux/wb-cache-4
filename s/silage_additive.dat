40|$|Potassium sorbate is {{intended}} {{to be used as a}} technological additive to improve the ensiling process in the range of 90 to 300  mg/kg fresh material. The application of potassium sorbate in the preparation of silage up to the maximum proposed dose of 300  mg/kg forage is safe for the target animals. The additive, when used in silage, is not expected to increase substantially consumer exposure to potassium sorbate. Therefore, the FEEDAP Panel concludes that potassium sorbate, when used as a <b>silage</b> <b>additive,</b> is safe for consumers of food products from animals fed treated silage. Potassium sorbate is a skin and eye irritant and a potential irritant to the respiratory tract. Potassium sorbate is not regarded as a skin sensitiser. The dusting potential of the preparation tested indicates that exposure of users via inhalation is possible. In view of the irritancy of potassium sorbate and the absence of information on its inhalation toxicity, exposure to such dust is considered hazardous. There are no safety concerns for the environment resulting from the use of potassium sorbate as a <b>silage</b> <b>additive.</b> Seven laboratory-scale ensiling studies were reported, each lasting at least 90 days and using forages of different origins.

Since <b>silage</b> <b>additive</b> addition affects the fermentation pattern, the aim {{of the study was to}} monitor the formation of various gasses from silages treated with different silage additives. A grass ley (70 % timothy) was harvested on August 24 th 2013, nearby Helsingborg. Bacterial inoculant (E. faecium, L. plantarum, L. buchneri) at the rate of 250000 cfu/g FF, and <b>silage</b> <b>additive</b> Safesil at the rate of 3 L/ton FF were compared with untreated control.

Standard analyses to determine silage quality were performed after ensiling period. Silages treated with bacterial inoculant had significantly higher pH, propionic acid, acetic acid, and ethanol contents but lower concentration of lactic acid than other silage treatments.

Silage inoculants, while {{the most common type of}} <b>silage</b> <b>additive,</b> have not been effective at improving aerobic stability.

These approaches were compared with untreated as well as four standard homofermentative lactic acid bacterial inoculants. The standard inoculants on average reduced aerobic stability 17 h relative to untreated silage. The best enhanced inoculant increased stability one year in three. The standard inoculant plus sodium benzoate increased stability but was only tested in one year.

40|$|Numerous {{commercial}} <b>silage</b> <b>additives,</b> {{manufacturers of}} which make various claims for their improving silage quality, {{are available to}} Kansas farmers and ranchers. In 2 previous years (1980 and 1981), we reported on nine trials involving six additives (Progress Reports 377 and 394). Each <b>additive</b> improved the <b>silage</b> {{in at least one}} of the four criteria we evaluated: 1) ensiling temperature, 2) dry matter recovery, 3) feeding value, and 4) aerobic stability. Two more trials with additives are reported on in this Progress Report (pages 6 and 11) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{main goal}} of this thesis was to {{evaluate}} the influence of additives on the qualitative indicators of grass silage. The evaluation concentrated in particular on lactic acid, pH {{and the degree of}} proteolysis. The selected qualitative indicators were monitored in 36 samples of grass silage from the region of South Bohemia. Silage samples were divided into three groups. The first group was a guide sample without any additives. The second group was treated with bacterial additives and the third group with bacteria-enzyme <b>additives.</b> Classification of <b>silage</b> samples was done according to "Norma 2004 ". Each sample was evaluated in terms of quality of fermentation and the content of nutrients. Statistically significant differences (p < 0. 05) were found in the content of lactic acid, pH and the degree of proteolysis between the group of <b>silages</b> without <b>additives</b> and the group treated with <b>silage</b> <b>additives...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to find influence of different <b>silage</b> <b>additives</b> on <b>silages</b> fermentation and nutritional value made from high moisture crimped corn, which were conserved in semi experimental conditions. Three variants were examined, untreated control (C), and two experimental variants conserved by biological (variant A) and chemical (variant B) additives. The maize crimped corn was hermetically filled into plastic bins with the capacity 50 dm 3. In <b>silage</b> conserved by <b>additives</b> was lower content of crude fibre (significantly in both experimental variants) and higher content of nitrogen free extract, starch and total sugars (significantly in variant A) established. In silages form both experimental variants we found significantly lower content of lactic acid. The highest concent we detected in <b>silage</b> conserved without <b>additives.</b> In <b>silage</b> conserved by biological inoculant we found lower content of acetic acid and higher content of butyric acid, but their content was generally very low. Additives used in the experiment decreased content of amonia (0. 074 g. kg- 1 in variant A and 0. 095 g. kg- 1 of dry matter in variant B) and alcohols too...|$|R
