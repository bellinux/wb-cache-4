However, he abandoned the project because the story was considered too [...] "small." [...] When they were approached to direct Tangled in 2008, directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard decided {{that it would be}} best to update the story [...] "for a modern audience", soon discovering [...] "that the problem with having a prison character ... is that they don't have anyone to talk to." [...] Howard explained that because Rapunzel is incapable of having a decent conversation with Mother Gothel, the isolated, incarcerated heroine [...] "needed someone to relate to." [...] Unwilling to default to using the traditional [...] "boring, ordinary side-kick," [...] Greno and Howard created Pascal, conceiving the character as a chameleon because Rapunzel is, according to Greno, [...] "a rough-and-tumble girl." [...] Howard explained that [...] "we wanted to do ... something fresh, something different. This girl, she's not a dainty, precious girl ... <b>So</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> she have? ... She's going to have a lizard." [...] Additionally, Howard believed that a reptile would compliment Rapunzel's personality best, describing the character as [...] "a quirky pet for a quirky young woman." ...|$|E

How little and how narrow seemed the outlook of her life--with the world waiting for her, the world of beauty, effort, self-sacrifice, fidelity! It was as though a flash of that summer {{lightning}} had fled by, singeing her, taking from her all powers of flight, burning off her wings, as off one of those pale hovering moths. Tears started up, and trickled down her face. 'Blind!' she thought; 'how could I have been so blind?' ...|$|E

6000|$|The {{consequence}} {{of all this}} was that my fever got very much worse and your letter has not been hitherto written. But, my dear fellow, do compare these little larky fevers with the fine, healthy, prostrating colds of the dear old dead days at home.

60|$|Flora {{hardly knew}} when they ceased to talk. She had musings equally engrossing of her own. She saw she {{was likely to}} be very {{intimate}} with Meta Rivers, and she was roaming away into schemes for not letting the intercourse drop, and hopes of being admitted to many a pleasure as yet little within her reach--parties, balls, London, itself, and, above all, the satisfaction of being admired. The certainty that Mr. Rivers thought her pretty and agreeable had gratified her all the evening, and if he, with his refined taste, thought <b>so,</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> others think? Her only fear was, that Ethel's awkwardness might make an unfavourable impression, but, at least, she said to herself, it was anything but vulgar awkwardness.|$|E
6000|$|I {{laughed at}} her {{whimsical}} way of putting it; but {{at the back of}} my brain was a troubled idea that perhaps she was revealing to me the truth. And if <b>so,</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> [...] "waking up," [...] as she termed it, be like? A flash of memory recalled to me that summer evening upon Barking Bridge, when, as it had seemed to me, the little childish Paul had slipped away from me, leaving me lonely and bewildered to find another Self. Was my boyhood in like manner now falling from me? I found myself clinging to it with vague terror. Its thoughts, its feelings--dreams: they had grown sweet to me; must I lose them? This cold, unknown, new Self, waiting to receive me: I shrank away from it with fear.|$|E
6000|$|It is {{very easy}} to {{demonstrate}} that there are more men than there is work for men to do. For instance, what would happen tomorrow if one hundred thousand tramps should become suddenly inspired with an overmastering desire for work? It is a fair question. [...] "Go to work" [...] is preached to the tramp every day of his life. The judge on the bench, the pedestrian in the street, the housewife at the kitchen door, all unite in advising him to go to work. <b>So</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> happen tomorrow if one hundred thousand tramps acted upon this advice and strenuously and indomitably sought work?

Would not many an old Roman have said as much for some favourite Greek slave,--for some freedman whom he would admit to his very heart? But what old Roman ever dreamed of giving his daughter to the son of a Greek bondsman! Had he done <b>so,</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> have become of the name of a Roman citizen?

6000|$|Like his son, Adrian, Ramiro was superstitious; more, his intellect, his reading, {{which in}} youth had been considerable, his {{observation}} {{of men and}} women, all {{led him to the}} conclusion that death is a wall with many doors in it; that {{on this side of the}} wall we may not linger or sleep, but must pass each of us through his appointed portal straight to the domain prepared for us.

Oh! terrors may attend the wicked after death, but in the case of some they do not tarry until death; they leap forward to him whom it is decreed must die, forcing attention with their eager, craving hands, with their obscure and ominous voices.

6000|$|MY DEAR COLVIN, - This is {{very late}} {{to begin the}} monthly budget, but I have a good excuse this time, for I {{have had a very}} {{annoying}} fever with symptoms of sore arm, {{and in the midst of}} it a very annoying piece of business which suffered no delay or idleness.

But granting that they might do <b>so,</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> be the result? I should see my country shaken to the centre, the capital in the hands of strangers, and to what end? Simply that I, an old and worn-out man should, for a very few years, remain in power here.

Nothing, therefore, would persuade me to seek English aid to retain me in power." ...|$|E

Why should not he have been mistaken as well as others? And he had an idea that if he could get her into his own hands he might still bring her through triumphantly,--with assistance from Solomon Aram and Chaffanbrass. He was strongly convinced of her guilt, but by no means strongly convinced that her guilt could be proved. But then he had no house at the present moment that he could call his own. His Kitty, the Kitty of whom he still sometimes thought with affection,--that Kitty whose soft motherly heart would have melted at such a story of a woman's sorrows, if only it had been rightly approached,--that Kitty was now vehemently hostile, hostile both to him and to this very woman for whom he would have asked her care.|$|E
