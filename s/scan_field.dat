40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) In this thesis, a novel optical {{design for}} an afocal scan engine {{based on two}} 90 ° {{off-axis}} parabolic optical elements acting as reflective relay optics between two deflecting mirrors is proposed. The characteristics of this scan engine such as linearity of scan lines, spot sizes, spot intensity profiles, field curvature, and temporal distortion across the <b>scan</b> <b>field</b> have been investigated. The new scan engine was also evaluated as an afocal relay, with scan optics and for optical zoom performance. The engine was modelled and investigated using OSLO, commercial optical software. Its performance was evaluated and compared to known scan engines with results showing superior linearity of scan lines and intensity distribution across the <b>scan</b> <b>field.</b> The advantage of using it with a fast resonant scan mirror is highlighted. The new scan engine prototype and known scan engines were assembled in the laboratory and their performance was evaluated and compared in order to verify the OSLO prediction. The experimentally measured results {{were found to be}} in agreement with the OSLO predicted results. A physical explanation for the difference in results has been provided. Using OSLO optical software, a study of temporal distortion across the <b>scan</b> <b>field</b> was then conducted. The calculated results predict that the use of the new scan engine in two-photon microscopy may result in improved contrast in two-photon images across the <b>scan</b> <b>field.</b> The new two-photon excitation correction factor for reflective scan engines was introduced and its evaluation confirmed that the new engine is the best choice for fast scanning two-photon microscopy (TPM) ...|$|E

Optical aberrations in scanning systems increase the microscope objective focal spot area and introduce pulse time broadening in the deflected beam, resulting in degradation of two-photon-induced fluorescence across the <b>scan</b> <b>field.</b> The geometrical pulse broadening is investigated for what {{is believed to be the}} first time and then combined with a focused spot area to provide a normalized two-photon fluorescence intensity correction factor. This factor, calculated using OSLO optical software, is compared for four reflective scan engines and allows compensation of the detected signal with position across the <b>scan</b> <b>field.</b> This new metric highlights that a parabolic mirror afocal relay exhibits superior performance as a reflective scan engine for two-photon scanning microscopy...|$|E

In {{this study}} a {{comparison}} of <b>scanning</b> near <b>field</b> optical microscopy with a traditional, well known microscopic technique like transmission electron microscopy is discussed.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new reconstruction algorithm for both single- and dual-energy computed tomography (CT) imaging. By incorporating the polychromatic {{characteristics of the}} X-ray beam into the reconstruction process, the algorithm is capable of eliminating beam hardening artifacts. The single energy version of the algorithm assumes that each voxel in the <b>scan</b> <b>field</b> can be expressed as a mixture of two known substances, for example, a mixture of trabecular bone and marrow, or a mixture of fat and flesh. These assumptions are easily satisfied in a quantitative computed tomography (QCT) setting. We have compared our algorithm to three commonly used single-energy correction techniques. Experimental results show that our algorithm is much more robust and accurate. We have also shown that QCT measurements obtained using our algorithm are five times more accurate than that from current QCT systems (using calibration). The dual-energy mode does not require any prior knowledge of the object in the <b>scan</b> <b>field,</b> {{and can be used}} to estimate the attenuation coefficient function of unknown materials.

40|$|AbstractThe {{selective}} laser melting process features a nearly incomparable freedom of design.

While there is some progress in process control and multiple parallel <b>scan</b> <b>fields</b> to tackle these issues, the potential of synchronized multibeam strategies {{has not yet been}} investigated. The presented synchronized multibeam approach is characterized by two widely overlapping <b>scan</b> <b>fields</b> fed by two independent laser sources that can be controlled to work in a synchronized manner with or without a defined offset. This allows a selective manipulation of the local temperature field and thus of melt pool dynamics, the temperature gradients and cooling rates, which are all influencing the processes’ porosity, cracking and distortion behavior. Therefore the influences of these strategies on the melt pool dimensions and dynamics as well as the temperature gradients are investigated in this work...|$|R

40|$|Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a {{high-resolution}} non-invasive and non-contact imaging technology. Traditionally, multi-axis spot-focused scanning is {{used for}} transverse scanning to obtain a two or three-dimensional OCT image. This increases the time to acquire an image and imaging performance is affected by motion artifacts. Moreover, lenses {{are used in the}} state-of-the-art OCT systems that reduce the axial resolution due to chromatic aberration, and affect the imaging quality due to distorted <b>scan</b> <b>field.</b> In order to avoid the problems mentioned above, the objective of the present thesis is to develop a reflective optics-based line-scan spectral domain OCT system for high-quality three-dimensional imaging. Cylindrical mirror used in this thesis for focusing eliminates chromatic aberration and provides a flat <b>scan</b> <b>field.</b> Line scanning reduces the requirement of scanning to one axis and thereby making the image acquisition faster. A novel reflective optics based line-scanning system with a spectrometer has been designed, and also the scanning system has been verified experimentally. The design of the scanner includes analytical and optical modeling of the proposed scanning configuration, along with the development of experimental setup and validation. Scanning system parameters that affect the imaging quality were studied and selected in the design. In addition, optical modeling of a reflective optics spectrometer was carried out, and an analytical model was developed for spectral domain OCT signal processing. Marechal criterion of Strehl Ratio above 0. 8 was used as a benchmark to evaluate the imaging quality of the proposed system. To validate the line scanning model, an experimental setup consisting of a 53 nm spectral bandwidth light source with cylindrical mirrors of 25. 85 mm and 51. 7 mm focal lengths was developed. Scanning was performed in both tangential and sagittal directions. The improvement in imaging performance by using sagittal scanning was demonstrated. It was also proved experimentally that the mirror focusing is insensitive variations in beam positions. ...|$|E

For finer alignment of the tip over a desired location, an optical calibration has to be carried out before-hand in order to avoid possible optical aberrations from optical elements like scan lens and tube lens in the microscope beam scanning path. This calibration follows a standard routine in the AFM software (DirectOverlay™, JPK Instruments AG, Germany) and has to be done once for any given <b>scan</b> <b>field.</b> Later on, the AFM software will be able to process and merge the optical image to AFM scans at any position, orientation and scan direction of the tip in that <b>scan</b> <b>field</b> (see Additional file 1). A 3 D scheme of the above mentioned setup is shown in Figure 1 c. Both these techniques can run independently of each other and also simultaneously.

40|$|Abstract — State-of-the-art {{filtered}} backprojection (FBP) algorithms often {{define the}} filtering operation {{to be performed}} along non-horizontal filter lines in the detector. For non-horizontal filter lines, a limited <b>scan</b> <b>field</b> of view leads to axially as well as trans-axially truncated projections. In this work, we investigate the influence of axial and trans-axial data truncation on the reconstruction result and present two novel truncation correction methods which effectively handle both types of data truncation. Method 1 is a one-step approach which performs extrapolation along the filter lines to account for axial and trans-axial data truncation simultaneously. Method 2 consists of two steps: the first step handles trans-axial data truncation while axial data truncation is corrected during a modified forward rebinning step. Experiments are presented from simulated data of the FORBILD head phantom. The accurate M-line algorithm is used for reconstruction.
