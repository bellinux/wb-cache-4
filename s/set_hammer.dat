40|$|The {{application}} of {{artificial neural network}} (ANN) in predicting pile bearing capacity is underlined in several studies. However, ANN deficiencies in finding global minima {{as well as its}} slow rate of convergence are the major drawbacks of implementing this technique. The current study aimed at developing an ANN-based predictive model enhanced with genetic algorithm (GA) optimization technique to predict the bearing capacity of piles. To provide necessary dataset required for establishing the model, 50 dynamic load tests were conducted on precast concrete piles in Pekanbaru, Indonesia. The pile geometrical properties, pile <b>set,</b> <b>hammer</b> weight and drop height were set to be the network inputs and the pile ultimate bearing capacity was set to be the output of the GA-based ANN model. The best predictive model was selected after conducting a sensitivity analysis for determining the optimum GA parameters coupled with a trial-and-error method for finding the optimum network architecture i. e. number of hidden nodes. Results indicate that the pile bearing capacities predicted by GA-based ANN are in close agreement with measured bearing capacities. Coefficient of determination as well as mean square error equal to 0. 990 and 0. 002 for testing datasets respectively, suggest that implementation of GA-based ANN models as a highly-reliable, efficient and practical tool in predicting the pile bearing capacity is of advantage...|$|E

60|$|One more {{illustration}} {{of the way in}} which the thematic system is worked. There are two themes connected with Loki. One is a rapid, sinuous, twisting, shifty semiquaver figure suggested by the unsubstantial, elusive logic-spinning of the clever one's braincraft. The other is the fire theme. In the first act of Siegfried, Mimmy makes his unavailing attempt to explain fear to Siegfried. With the horror fresh upon him of the sort of nightmare into which he has fallen after the departure of the Wanderer, and which has taken the form, at once fanciful and symbolic, of a delirious dread of light, he asks Siegfried whether he has never, whilst wandering in the forest, had his heart <b>set</b> <b>hammering</b> in frantic dread by the mysterious lights of the gloaming. To this, Siegfried, greatly astonished, replies that on such occasions his heart is altogether healthy and his sensations perfectly normal. Here Mimmy's question is accompanied by the tremulous sounding of the fire theme with its harmonies most oppressively disturbed and troubled; whereas with Siegfried's reply they become quite clear and straightforward, making the theme sound bold, brilliant, and serene. This is a typical instance {{of the way in which}} the themes are used.|$|R

The closing Dona Nobis Pacem builds to fortissimo; it is <b>set</b> with <b>hammered</b> repeated notes and overlapping intervals of a second between the voices. The organ ostinato finally breaks its pattern {{for the last two}} bars and the chorus closes with a pianississimo D minor triad.|$|R

50|$|A hammer mill, hammer forge or hammer works was a {{workshop}} in the pre-industrial era that was typically used to manufacture semi-finished, wrought iron products or, sometimes, finished agricultural or mining tools, or military weapons.
