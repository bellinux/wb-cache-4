25|$|Mrs. Connally {{testified that}} just after hearing a loud, {{frightening}} noise {{that came from}} <b>somewhere</b> <b>behind</b> her and to her right, she turned toward President Kennedy and saw him raise his arms and elbows, {{with his hands in}} front of his face and throat. She then heard another gunshot and then Governor Connally yelling. Mrs. Connally then turned away from Kennedy toward her husband, at which point another gunshot sounded and she and the limousine's rear interior were covered with fragments of skull, blood, and brain.|$|E
25|$|Instead {{of a pair}} of {{horizontal}} bolts that allow the caliper to move straight in and out respective to the car body, a swinging caliper utilizes a single, vertical pivot bolt located <b>somewhere</b> <b>behind</b> the axle centerline. When the driver presses the brakes, the brake piston pushes on the inside piston and rotates the whole caliper inward, when viewed from the top. Because the swinging caliper's piston angle changes relative to the disc, this design uses wedge-shaped pads that are narrower in the rear on the outside and narrower on the front on the inside.|$|E
500|$|The next morning, {{when the}} NZMRB {{had crossed the}} river, McCarroll was given command of the vanguard, {{comprising}} the regiment, a squadron from the Canterbury Mounted Rifles and the Hong Kong and Singapore Mountain Artillery Battery. Progress was slow along the steep tracks {{and they had to}} camp in the hills that night at an altitude between [...] During the night it started to rain, making travelling along the small tracks even harder at daylight. Because the rest of the division was having even worse problems than the brigade, they stopped at the village of Ain es Sir. During the day, they captured seven Germans and eighty-eight Turkish troops. Another problem for the regiment was the lack of supplies; their rations were stuck <b>somewhere</b> <b>behind</b> them on the track. The remainder of the division arrived during the day and the raid on Amman was planned for the next day, 27 March.|$|E

50|$|Such {{tropical}} {{elements were}} thus in place {{from the earliest}} beginnings of Egyptian civilization, not isolated <b>somewhere</b> South <b>behind</b> the Saharan barrier.

Created by purely visual epiphany {{in a kind}} of unpedagogic, virgin birth?I am very very far from being in love with normative, {{gatekeeping}} academic criticism; but pedagogy, repetition and circulation are very widespread structuring conditions against which to act—both as writer and as imaginer of receivers.

60|$|I {{went away}} in a {{thoughtful}} frame of mind. I began to see why a courier could afford to work for fifty-five dollars a month and his fares. A month or two later I was able to understand why a courier {{did not have to}} pay any board and lodging, and why my hotel bills were always larger when I had him with me than when I left him <b>behind,</b> <b>somewhere,</b> for a few days.|$|R
6000|$|He began {{describing}} {{the kid who}} was still asleep in the cab. I did some quick thinking. Evidently the family was {{on the trail of}} the kid, and the sheriff had received telegraphed instructions from Oregon. Yes, I had seen the kid. I had met him first in Ogden. The date tallied with the sheriff's information. But the kid was still <b>behind</b> <b>somewhere,</b> I explained, for he had been ditched from that very overland that night when it pulled out of Rock Springs. And all the time I was praying that the kid wouldn't wake up, come down out of the cab, and put the [...] "kibosh" [...] on me.|$|R

For when we were shut in by the wooden apron, the man drove so fast that Flo was frightened, and told me to stop him, but he was up outside <b>behind</b> <b>somewhere,</b> and I couldn't get at him. He didn't hear me call, nor see me flap my parasol in front, and there we were, quite helpless, rattling away, and whirling around corners at a breakneck pace.

40|$|The future began <b>somewhere.</b> The impulse <b>behind</b> {{this issue}} of The Fibreculture Journal was a crisis of {{imagination}} with regards to how the future might look and behave. Our starting point was the notion of post-millennial tension – the idea that in the decades following the year 2000 we find ourselves living in an era {{that was meant to}} be the future, but where many of our futuristic hopes and fantasies remain unfulfilled. Worse, our historical visions of hyper-technological futures seem to have propelled us into a perilous position where humankind may not have any kind of future at all. In the space between ever-hopeful techno-futurism and the realities of a world forever changed by the pursuit of the resources required to fuel it, we asked if the age-old concept of utopia still has the strength to generate galvanising visions of the future...|$|R
60|$|One conceives them at first, each little {{hole with}} its watchful, well-equipped couple of assassins, turning up their eyes in expectation. The wind is with our enemy, and his captive {{balloons}} have been disagreeably overhead {{all through the}} hot morning. His big guns have suddenly become nervously active. Then, a little murmur along the pits and trenches, and from <b>somewhere</b> over <b>behind</b> us, this air-shark drives up the sky. The enemy's balloons splutter a little, retract, and go rushing down, and we send a spray of bullets as they drop. Then against our aerostat, and with the wind driving them clean overhead of us, come the antagonistic flying-machines. I incline to imagine {{there will be a}} steel prow with a cutting edge {{at either end of the}} sort of aerostat I foresee, and conceivably this aerial ram will be the most important weapon of the affair. When operating against balloons, such a fighting-machine will rush up the air as swiftly as possible, and then, with a rapid contraction of its bladders, fling itself like a knife at the sinking war-balloon of the foe. Down, down, down, through a vast alert tension of flight, down it will swoop, and, if its stoop is successful, slash explosively at last through a suffocating moment. Rifles will crack, ropes tear and snap; there will be a rending and shouting, a great thud of liberated gas, and perhaps a flare. Quite certainly those flying machines will carry folded parachutes, and the last phase of many a struggle will be the desperate leap of the aeronauts with these in hand, to snatch one last chance of life out of a mass of crumpling, fallen wreckage.|$|R

6000|$|I {{have had}} my usual left boot on this morning, {{and have had}} an hour's walk. It was in a gale of wind and a simoom of dust, but I greatly enjoyed it. Immense enthusiasm at Wolverhampton last night over [...] "Marigold." [...] Scott made a most amazing ass of himself yesterday. He {{reported}} that he had left <b>behind</b> <b>somewhere</b> three books--"Boots," [...] "Murder," [...] and [...] "Gamp." [...] We immediately telegraphed to the office. Answer, no books there. As my impression was that he must have left them at St. James's Hall, we then arranged to send him up to London at seven this morning. Meanwhile (though not reproached), he wept copiously and audibly. I had asked him over and over again, was he sure he had not put them in my large black trunk? Too sure, too sure. Hadn't opened that trunk after Tuesday night's reading. He opened it to get some clothes out when I went to bed, and there the books were! He produced them with an air of injured surprise, as if we had put them there.|$|R
50|$|A {{reckless}} act by Mitch {{causes a}} stampede {{in which the}} map and almost all their supplies are lost. Thanks to Glen's memory, {{they are able to}} press on and find the location of the cave where the gold is hidden. They eventually find it, but are confronted by two armed cowboys also seeking it. In the ensuing fight, Glen is shot and apparently killed, but Duke discovers the bullets to be blanks with red paint. At that moment, Clay Stone (Noble Willingham), the organizer of the cattle drive, appears along with some of their old friends, such as Ira and Barry Shalowitz. Clay explains that the cowboys are his sons and he has been looking for Duke for some time. Having left the cattle business, he is now making a living taking men on a trip to find the gold, which is revealed to be lead painted with that color. Though Mitch, Phil, and Glen feel lost, Duke remains convinced that the gold is out there <b>somewhere,</b> and stays <b>behind</b> as the others return to Las Vegas.|$|R
40|$|Individual {{external}} {{doses of}} inhabitants {{were examined in}} high levels of natural radiation areas (HLNRAs) in Ramsar. Each of 15 inhabitants in HLNRAs and 10 inhabitants in a control area carried an electronic personal dosimeter (EPD) for one day in April and in December 2005. In addition, their individual doses were estimated from indoor and outdoor radiation dose rates determined with a NaI (Tl) survey meter. A good correlation existed between the dose rate values obtained through estimation and personal measurement, and estimated annual doses ranged from 0. 5 to 32 mGy/y. Each of the dosimetric subjects carried also an optically stimulated luminescence dosimeter (OSLD) for about one month in September 2005, but a few values obtained by these measurements deviated widely from those obtained by one-day measurements with EPDs and those estimated by environmental dosimetry. This deviation might {{have been due to}} the fact that these OSLDs were left <b>behind</b> <b>somewhere</b> in houses. Hence, the observed dose values depended heavily on the place where dosimeters had been left, because of the non-uniform distribution of Ra- 226 contained in building materials as well as the structure of the house and the existence of shields...|$|R
