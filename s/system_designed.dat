40|$|Manufacturing {{companies}} are increasingly required {{to deal with}} and introduce significant changes in their production systems to gain a competitive advantage. The production <b>system</b> <b>design</b> process is widely considered a means of introducing such changes, and decisions made during design are viewed as critical to its characterization and performance. However, this presents a problem because committing to decisions that involve significant changes implies not only dealing with requirements, products, challenges, or expectations that are different from what currently exists, but also addressing uncertainties regarding both the information necessary for committing to a production <b>system</b> <b>design</b> decision and the actual benefits {{that can be achieved}} {{as a result of these}} changes. One way to support the production <b>system</b> <b>design</b> decisions in this context is through the use of Discrete Event Simulation (DES). However, understanding of DES use when supporting production <b>system</b> <b>design</b> decisions in this domain remains limited.      Therefore, the objective of this thesis is to explore the use of DES in support of production <b>system</b> <b>design</b> decisions when significant changes are introduced. Data are collected through a multiple case study method and DES from three real-time production <b>system</b> <b>design</b> projects at one manufacturing company. All production <b>system</b> <b>design</b> projects studied involved the introduction of significant production system changes for which limited experience existed. The cases and results are presented in three appended publications. The findings establish the purpose of DES use when supporting production <b>system</b> <b>design</b> decisions in this context. To this end three groups of DES model objectives are identified: communicating decisions and visualizing results, evaluating a production <b>system</b> <b>design</b> concept focused on operational performance, and experimenting with what-if scenarios while predicting production system outputs. The points of DES use when supporting production <b>system</b> <b>design</b> decisions are specified in relation to current theoretical understanding of a production <b>system</b> <b>design</b> process. Then, challenges and contributions of DES use supporting production <b>system</b> <b>design</b> decisions are identified. A framework is presented to facilitate the use of DES supporting production <b>system</b> <b>design</b> decisions when significant changes are introduced. The framework is based on the identification of high-level strategic objectives and relates these to production <b>system</b> <b>design</b> decisions. It defines DES use in support of these decisions and establishes milestones for DES use during production <b>system</b> <b>design.</b> Based on an analysis of the challenges and contributions of DES use, the framework helps formulate the purpose of DES use to achieve production <b>system</b> <b>design</b> decision support. ...|$|R

40|$|Social <b>systems</b> <b>design</b> is {{employed}} {{to plan a}} better society. This paper discusses some theoretical issues of practical social <b>systems</b> <b>design</b> {{from the perspective of}} classical structural-functional theory. Social <b>systems</b> <b>design</b> refers to three aspects: design of function, design of structure, and the design of change process. One should not concentrate on the design of structure, for example, but instead on all three simultaneously. The four types of strategy for social <b>systems</b> <b>design</b> are isomorphism, transplantation, adaptation, and innovation. How to design differs according to these strategies. Most social <b>systems</b> <b>designs</b> encounter some dilemma that is resolved not a priori but by the careful consideration of information based on actual situations. More research on integration for resolving social <b>systems</b> <b>design</b> dilemmas is required. よりよい社会を設計するという意味での社会システムデザインについて、古典的な構造＝機能主義の枠組みを出発点にして、実際にデザインを行うために必要な理論上の問題を検討する。 社会システムデザインにおいてデザインされる対象は「機能」「構造」「変動過程」の 3 つであり、「構造」だけでなく、 3 つの対象間の関連を考慮してデザインを進めるべきである。また、社会システムデザインの戦略には「同型化」「移植」「適応」「革新」の 4 つがあり、戦略ごとにデザインの方法が異なる。そして社会システムデザインにおいてさまざまなジレンマが発生するが、そのジレンマの解決は、先験的には不可能であり「現場」の情報の個別的な組み込みによってなされる。社会システムデザインにおけるジレンマの解消過程、合意形成過程についてさらに議論を深めることが残された課題である...|$|R

40|$|The {{definition}} of system metrics {{is crucial to}} determine if a manufacturing <b>system</b> <b>design</b> is truly effective because inappropriate metrics can lead to ineffective or improperly-focused system improvements. This research highlights the importance of measuring the <b>system</b> <b>design</b> that contributes to system effectiveness. The authors propose the use of a Manufacturing <b>System</b> <b>Design</b> Evaluation Tool to assess the effectiveness of the <b>design</b> of manufacturing <b>systems</b> as a whole. The tool was developed based on the Manufacturing <b>System</b> <b>Design</b> Decomposition. The Manufacturing <b>System</b> <b>Design</b> Evaluation Tool measures how well a <b>system</b> is <b>designed</b> based on the requirements outlined in the Manufacturing <b>System</b> <b>Design</b> Decomposition. <b>System</b> effectiveness is evaluated based on six physical manufacturing system configurations: the Departmental or Job Shop Layout, Departments Arranged by Product Flow (sometimes called a Flow Shop), Assembly or Transfer Line, Pseudo-Cell (a cell that is called a cell but does not meet all of the requirements of a cell), individual Assembly or Machining Cells (but not yet integrated as a system), and a Linked-Cell Manufacturing System for all aspects of a production value stream. The Linked-Cell Manufacturing System is considered to be the physical configuration that represents the highest level of manufacturing <b>system</b> <b>design</b> requirements achievement. In addition, the siginificance of implementing one physical element relative to achieving the requirements of the overall manufacturing <b>system</b> <b>design</b> may be evaluated. With this feedback, management is able to identify elements of the <b>system</b> <b>design</b> that need improvement and additional resources.

Due to the remote nature of many communities, school locations meant that for some families residential schools were the only way to comply. The schools were intentionally located at substantial distances from Indigenous communities to minimize contact between families and their children. Indian Commissioner Hayter Reed argued for schools at greater distances to reduce family visits, which he thought counteracted efforts to civilize Indigenous children.
