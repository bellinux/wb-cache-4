The {{results of the study}} showed that average dry matter yield of the summer meadows is low (about 0. 6 ± 0. 14 t ha- 1) ranging from 0. 33 ± 0. 07 t ha- 1 to 0. 53 ± 0. 10 t ha- 1 at poor meadows (Progonat, Cajup Lenie) and from 0. 9 ± 0. 17 t ha- 1 to 0. 95 ± 0. 18 t ha- 1 at rich meadows (Gramoz Shistavec). Dry matter yield of the winter meadows ranged from 0. 45 ± 0. 17 t ha- 1 (Dukaj) to 0. 57 ± 0. 13 t ha- 1 (Heremec-Delvine). Regarding the rate of herbaceous biomass utilization in general, the plots closer to the villages were overstocked, which put high pressure on meadows resulting in their degradation. The coefficient of herbaceous phytomass utilization was about 94 - 95 % at Lenia's meadows and a few other meadows close to villages. At a few plots of meadows (Lenia, Gramoz, Shishtavec) situated away from villages and at high sea level, the coefficient of meadow utilization reached 50 - 60 %. Energetic value expressed by <b>starch</b> <b>unit</b> (SU) depends on the flora and environmental conditions. According to laboratory analyses, the meadows of Dukaj had the highest energetic values (about 1. 16 ± 0. 22 SU kg- 1 dry matter) while Lenia' meadows had the lowest energetic values (about 0. 84 ± 0. 16 SU kg- 1 dry matter) ...|$|E

40|$|Two {{software}} {{systems were}} developed to simplify acquisition and analysis of data describing creep behavior of viscoelastic solid foods and to determine the magnitude of instantaneous elastic compliance, viscoelastic compliances and viscosity associated with Newtonian flow. The first of these systems was used to store information on the experiment, to collect the data generated during the experiment, to present these in real time and to create files containing the experimental data for subsequent analysis. The second system was used to fit data to discrete Kelvin-Voigt models with four, six or eight constants. The systems were tested in the calculation of rheological properties of fresh and cooked potato tissues. A six-element Burgers model containing two discrete Voigt units proved the most suitable for defining tissue creep behavior, suggesting that different structural components {{could be related to}} each unit.

In brief, FDP concentration was measured by an enzymatic procedure of Racker (Bergmeyer 2012) using a commercial JSAY 139 FDP kit (Jie Shi Kang Biotech Co., Ltd. China). LDH was detected by a method similar to De Vries et al. (1970) using a commercial kit (PN. A 020, Jiancheng Biotech Co., Ltd.

Plant fiber is dissolved in alkali and carbon disulfide to create viscose, which is then reconverted to cellulose in cellophane form following a sulfuric acid and sodium sulfate bath. There are currently two processes used to separate cellulose from the other wood constituents (Yan et al. 2009). These methods, sulfite and pre-hydrolysis kraft pulping, use high pressure and chemicals to separate cellulose from lignin and hemicellulose, attaining greater than 97 % cellulose purity. The main derivatives of cellulose for industrial purposes are cellulose acetate, cellulose esters (molding, extrusion, and films), and regenerated cellulose for fibers.|$|R

Structural failure of fresh tissue under compression always occurred along a single plane of maximum shear stress, while fresh tensile specimens failed under tension. Tensile tests proved better methods by which to determine the failure parameters of cooked specimens since {{it was possible to}} observe two differents modes of failure with this technique.

All technologies increased digestion of DM (13 to 43 % <b>units)</b> and <b>starch</b> (22 to 51 % units) during Boisen incubation, compared with the unprocessed control (P < 0. 01). Wet-milling, extrusion, and acid-autoclaving increased CP digestion by 29 to 33 % units (P < 0. 01). Xylanase and ß-glucanase addition increased digestion of DM (~ 20 % <b>units),</b> <b>starch</b> (~ 20 % units), and CP (~ 10 % units) in unprocessed and autoclaved barley (P < 0. 01).

Among different genotypes, two different patterns of B fp (fingerprint B-chains, DP 3 - 7) were observed for φ,β-limit dextrins, whereas A fp (fingerprint A-chains, DP 6 - 8) for whole amylopectins were consistent. Reconstruction of amylopectins from their φ,β-limit dextrins revealed that B-chains with internal DP > 20 possessed an external chain length corresponding to the average value DP 12. 8. Wide genetic variations were recorded among structural parameters, of which several concerning the amylopectin internal part were highly correlated to the thermal and pasting parameters of sweetpotato starches, and suggested that the internal part of amylopectin is critical to the physical behavior of granular starch. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Plants grown in the smaller containers exhibited less leaf expansion, lower root and shoot weight, and fewer lateral stems than plants grown in the 5. 9 liter containers. Shoot/root ratio was not altered by the container volume, suggesting coordination of root and shoot growth due to rooting volume.

30|$|Sweet potato (Ipomea batatas) {{has been}} {{considered}} a promising substrate for alcohol fermentation since it has a higher <b>starch</b> yield per <b>unit</b> land cultivated than grains (Duvernay et al. 2013; Lee et al. 2012; Srichuwong et al. 2009; Ziska et al. 2009). Industrial sweet potatoes are not intended {{for use as a}} food crop. They are bred to increase its starch content, significantly reducing its attractiveness as a food crop when compared to other conventional food cultivars (visual aspect, color, taste). Therefore, they offer potentially greater fermentable sugar yields from a sweet potato crop for industrial conversion processes and the opportunity to increase planted acreage (even on marginal lands) beyond what is in place for food. It has been reported that some industrial sweet potatoes breeding lines developed could produce ethanol yields of 4500 – 6500  L/ha compared to 2800 – 3800  L/ha for corn (Duvernay et al. 2013; Ziska et al. 2009). Sweet potato has several agronomic characteristics that determine its wide adaptation to marginal lands such as drought resistant, high multiplication rate and low degeneration of the propagation material, short grow cycle, low illness incidence and plagues, cover rapidly the soil and therefore protect it from the erosive rains and controlling the weed problem (Cao et al. 2011; Duvernay et al. 2013; Vilaró et al. 2009). Previous transformation of the raw material into chips or flour (powder) can be done in order to facilitate its transport and/or plant conservation.|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} 10 years, 90 % of cassava starch {{factories}} in Thailand have switched from fuel oil to renewable biogas, to cover {{part of their}} energy needs. The environmental benefits of switching to biogas have not been assessed quantitatively. To alleviate this, this study assessed 100 -year greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, or carbon footprint (CF), of cassava starch production for four factories in Thailand. Key results demonstrate that biogas reduces the carbon footprint of the Thai cassava starch {{industry as a whole}} by 0. 9 – 1. 0 million tons CO 2 eq/year, and highlight methodological precautions to collect LCI data and allocate GHG emissions between co-products with high moisture contents. The system boundaries included farm stage (production of cassava roots), transportation to factory and processing into native <b>starch.</b> The functional <b>unit</b> (FU) was one ton of native cassava starch at 13 % water content. Biogas produced from the factory wastewater (95 – 200  m 3 /FU) was the main source of thermal energy for starch drying, and for on-site electricity production when excess biogas was available. The total CF of cassava starch was in the range 609 – 966  kg CO 2 eq/FU. Agricultural production contributed 60 % of the carbon footprint, mainly from the use of nitrogen fertilizers. GHG emissions of root production varied widely due to (1) the diversity of farming practices even within a small radius (50  km), and (2) different agricultural yields in different regions. The contribution of the factory stage to the carbon footprint depended on the use of electricity, biogas and other fuels, ranging from 217 to 342  kg CO 2 eq/FU. Allocation rules such as wet weight or dry weight basis allocations affected the results markedly. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

We present thedevelopment and characterization of two phase blends of plasticized starch (PLS) andpolypropylene (PP) compatibilized via an interfacial chemical reaction. Starch is an abundant, naturally occurring polysaccharide that is obtained from variousplant sources. Having three hydroxyl groups per glucose monomer <b>unit,</b> <b>starch</b> is an inherentlymultifunctional polymer. When starch is blended with another polymer, such functionally can beused to reactively compatibilize the two phase system. We first {{examine the effects}} ofmultifunctional reactive compatibilization in model immiscible polymer blends and comparethem to compatibilization using diblock copolymers. We study the rheological andmorphological effects of the crosslinked interface and investigate the effects of varying thereactive compatibilizer concentration and the homopolymer loading. We next develop a processing methodology and conduct a systematic characterizationstudy of PLS and PP blends. Based on the result of our model blend study, multifunctionalreactive blending was employed using maleated polypropylene (MAPP). The maleic anhydridefunctional groups are able to react with hydroxyl functional starch, creating a compatibilizedsystem. The addition of layered silicate to the PLS/PP blends was employed to mitigate thedecline in mechanical properties as starch content increased. At sufficiently high plasticized starch loadings, the maleated polypropylene domainsacted as physical crosslinking sites. The processing, blending, compatibilization andcharacterization of plasticized starch resulted in a material with properties apt for severalelastomeric applications, such as rubber feet for electronic devices. The challenges of usingplasticized starch as an elastomer are also discussed. Lastly, we present a comparative life cycle assessment of plasticized starch andpolypropylene. The system boundary of this assessment is defined to be "cradle to gate" inwhich we analyze the system from raw material extraction to the final production of a polymerpellet...|$|R
40|$|Ethanol for {{automotive}} purposes is {{an issue}} much debated and researchers disagree {{about the benefits of}} bioethanol. Converting energy-rich crops into ethanol suitable as motor fuel is a complex process and continuous development and improvements of processes and material used are important steps in the work of developing environmental friendly fuels. Grain is usually preserved by drying which consumes a lot of energy. Alternative storage of high-moisture grain in airtight storage systems reduce the energy required to produce bioethanol and studies have also shown that ethanol yields are increased more than 10 % in ethanol fermentations of moist grain compared to dry. Airtight storage is often not perfectly airtight so biocontrol agents are necessary in order to preserve the grain. The yeast Pichia anomala has anti-microbial activity and inhibits mould growth in airtight stored moist grain with some air leakage and is therefore an attractive alternative for biocontrol. Starch has to be degraded by enzymes into fermentable sugars before it can be fermented into ethanol. Storing high-moisture grain improves enzymatic degradation which results in higher ethanol yields and the aim {{of this study was to}} investigate if ethanol yields could be increased further by pre-treating the grain with amylase producing Lactobacillus plantarum strains in combination with P. anomala J 121. Amylase is an enzyme that degrades <b>starch</b> into sugar <b>units</b> and pre-treating grain with bacteria that has amylase activity might have a positive effect on glucose concentrations in grain before and after starch is enzymatically degraded and ultimately result in increased ethanol yields. Also, lactic acid bacteria have been observed to have antifungal activity. Amylase producing L. plantarum strains Amy 1 to 7 were screened for their ability to degrade starch and for possible antifungal activity. No inhibiting activity against P. anomala J 121 or Penicillium roqueforti J 9 was detected. L. plantarum Amy 1 to 7 did inhibit growth of Fusarium culmorium J 617. L. plantarum Amy 1, was used in a two months storage study to investigate how ethanol yields are affected by microbial pretreatment during storage. Grain was inoculated with L. plantarum Amy 1 or P. anomala J 121 alone or a combination of the two and fermentations were performed on the grain after one month and two months of storage. Inoculation with L. plantarum Amy 1 did not increase ethanol yields, but slightly higher yields were observed in grain pretreated with P. anomala J 121. Two different moisture contents of the grain were used in the study; 25 % and 40 %. Increased ethanol production rates were observed in the wetter grain but final ethanol yields were similar in both moisture contents. Earlier findings that ethanol yields are increased in fermentations of grain stored moist was confirmed. To study if pretreatment with L. plantarum Amy 1 can increase storage stability of moist grain a storage study with P. roqueforti J 9 was performed and also to ensure that any glucose released during pretreatment does not increase mould growth. Increased storage stability by inoculating grain with L. plantarum Amy 1 could not be concluded from this study. However, no increased mould growth was observed in grain treated with L. plantarum Amy 1...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} isolate and partially characterize enzymes amylase and protease of clones isolated from a selection of functional metagenomic library of TPI in the Amazon region. In this study were isolated 1. 344 clones, only 4 producing halo of starch hydrolysis and 3 proteolytic clones belonging to metagenomic library constructed with total DNA extracted from microorganisms present in soil samples of the TPI, were partially characterized the enzymes produced by 4 clones amilolytic and 1 proteolytic clone. After isolation, the clones were inoculated in culture medium Luria Bertani (LB) at 37 ?C under agitation of 150 rpm and subjected to assays at pHs of 3 to 10 and temperatures ranging from 25 to 100 ?C for up to 90 of incubation. Amylases had its highest production in 24 h (4. 3 U/mL) and its activity was optimal at neutral pH to slightly alkaline, the clone P 1 C 4 showed the highest production at 70 ?C (6. 93 U/mL), since the clones P 5 C 4 and P 6 C 12 reported higher thermostability at 80 ?C, these results indicate that the gene for alpha-amylase to be cloned encoding a thermostable enzyme, such as the enzyme produced by Bacillus liqueniformis. Since the clone P 3 A 3 produced 26. 3 U/mL protease in 10 hours of production, its activity was optimal at neutral pH, and its optimum temperature at 30 ?C (56. 0 U/mL) and its thermostability was demonstrated in 50 ?C (22, 0 U/mL). These features contribute to the implementation of these enzymes in industrial sectors as in food production, chemical industry and production of detergents. The enzymes isolated in this study demonstrated new features and performance when compared to enzymes described today, which proves the efficiency of the construction of metagenomic libraries for isolation of new bioproducts...|$|R
