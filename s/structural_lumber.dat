30|$|This {{study focused}} on the {{relationship}} between stress level and the fire resistance of <b>structural</b> <b>lumber.</b> The 210 samples were prepared from 15 -year-old trees of Acacia mangium from the Forest Estate Plantation, Indonesia. Specimens were 20 ® × 20 (T) × 500 [*]mm (L) and were air-dried. Sixty samples were tested under four-point bending stress to obtain the modulus of elasticity (MOE) and the modulus of rupture (MOR) for classifying the stress grades of the remaining 150 samples. The tests were performed using a four-point load bending position at various stress level while the specimens were exposed to fire along the shear-free region. Time to failure was affected by the stress levels in an exponential trend. Despite changes in stress level, charring rate, and time to failure, the critical stress of a member from the same species was similar. The fire performance under applied load could be predicted by using simplified fire-testing methods. The developed testing apparatus is valid for evaluating the small-scale fire resistant behavior of <b>structural</b> <b>lumber</b> in bending.|$|E
