5|$|Ringed seals {{were once}} the main food staple for the Inuit. They are still an {{important}} food {{source for the}} people of Nunavut and are also hunted and eaten in Alaska. <b>Seal</b> <b>meat</b> is an important source of food for residents of small coastal communities. The seal blubber is used to make seal oil, which is marketed as a fish oil supplement. In 2001, two percent of Canada's raw seal oil was processed and sold in Canadian health stores.|$|E
5|$|There {{were also}} discoveries of major {{scientific}} importance. These included the snow-free Dry Valleys {{in the western}} mountains, the emperor penguin colony at Cape Crozier, scientific evidence that the Ice Barrier was a floating ice shelf, and a leaf fossil discovered by Ferrar which helped to establish Antarctica's relation to the Gondwana super-continent. Thousands of geological and biological specimens had been collected and new marine species identified. The location of the South Magnetic Pole had been calculated with reasonable accuracy. On the medical side, Wilson discovered the anti-scorbutic effects of fresh <b>seal</b> <b>meat,</b> which resolved the lethal threat of scurvy to this and subsequent expeditions.|$|E
50|$|High {{levels of}} trace {{elements}} were found. In particular, hooded <b>seal</b> muscle <b>meat</b> contained 379 μg/g {{of iron and}} harp <b>seal</b> muscle <b>meat</b> contained 30 μg/g of zinc.|$|R
25|$|From {{the early}} 18th century English hunters began to range further afield - 1723 {{marked the first}} time that hunters armed with {{firearms}} ventured forth in boats to increase their haul. This soon became a sophisticated commercial operation; the seals were transported back to England, where the <b>seal's</b> <b>meat,</b> fur and oil were sold separately. From 1749, the import of seal oil to England was being recorded annually, and was used as a lighting oil, for cooking, in the manufacture of soap and for the treating of leather.|$|R
50|$|In 1956, Perlman and {{his brother}} Stuart founded the first store of fast food chain LUMS Inc. in Miami Beach, Florida. Lum's was founded for $12,000. With Clifford {{commanding}} and Stuart executing, they had {{within a couple of}} years established a 389-unit franchise chain that spanned Canada, Puerto Rico, and 29 American states. Perlman {{and his brother}} also owned Dirr's Gold <b>Seal</b> <b>Meats,</b> a business large enough to supply the Lum's chain with 25 percent of its packed meat products while keeping other eateries stocked as well. Their third subsidiary, Dade Wholesale Products, was their only concern outside the food industry. Dade owned an 86-unit string of Eagle Army-Navy Discount Stores, which grew to 111 stores under Perlman stewardship.|$|R
25|$|Borré {{tells of}} a time when she saw an Inuit woman fall ill who blamed her {{sickness}} on the lack of seal in her diet. Once receiving <b>seal</b> <b>meat,</b> the woman felt better within hours and said that her quick recovery was due to the consumption of <b>seal</b> <b>meat</b> and blood. Borré experienced this many times among many different members of the group and they all attributed their sickness to the lack of Inuit food.|$|E
25|$|<b>Seal</b> <b>meat</b> is an {{important}} source of food for residents of small coastal communities. Meat is sold to the Asian pet food market; in 2004, only Taiwan and South Korea purchased <b>seal</b> <b>meat</b> from Canada. The seal blubber is used to make seal oil, which is marketed as a fish oil supplement. In 2001, two percent of Canada's raw seal oil was processed and sold in Canadian health stores. There has been virtually no market for seal organs since 1998.|$|E

For Yup'ik hunters, bearded seals were the seal of choice. Bearded seals were widely considered the best <b>seal</b> for <b>meat.</b> The blubber was rendered into oil.|$|R
25|$|The {{belief that}} scurvy was {{fundamentally}} a nutritional deficiency, best treated by consumption of fresh food, particularly fresh citrus or fresh meat, was not universal in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and thus sailors and explorers continued {{to suffer from}} scurvy into the 20th century. For example, the Belgian Antarctic Expedition of 1897–1899 became seriously affected by scurvy when its leader, Adrien de Gerlache, initially discouraged his men from eating penguin and <b>seal</b> <b>meat.</b>|$|E
25|$|Newfoundland and Labrador and the Gulf of St. Lawrence {{were the}} first regions to {{experience}} large scale sealing. Migratory fishermen began the hunting from {{as early as the}} 1500s. Large-scale commercial seal hunting became an annual event starting in 1723 and expanded rapidly near the turn of the 18th century. Initially, the method used was to ensnare the migrating seals in nets anchored to shore installations, known as the 'landsman seal fishery'. The hunt was mainly for the procurement of <b>seal</b> <b>meat</b> as a form of sustenance for the settlements in the area, rather than for commercial gain.|$|E
25|$|Professor of {{anthropology}} at Trent University Ontario, Canada, Joseph K. So (1980) cited a study by J. T. Steegman (1965) that the so-called cold-adapted Mongoloid face {{has been shown in}} an experiment, using Japanese and European subjects, to not offer greater protection to frostbite. In explaining Mongoloid cold-adaptiveness, So cites the work of W. L. Hylander (1977) where Hylander said that in the Eskimo (Inuit), for example, the reduction of the brow ridge and flatness of the face is due to internal structural configurations that are cold adapted {{in the sense that they}} produce a large vertical bite force necessary to chew frozen <b>seal</b> <b>meat.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In his patent, Durand clearly {{mentions}} {{that the idea}} of the invention was communicated to him {{more than a year ago}} by a friend abroad. The patent itself consists of two distinct parts: first, the description of the original idea, and second, observations by Durand himself. Durand was clearly suspicious of the invention. However, having a curious mind, he performed a thorough test of it by himself, <b>sealing</b> <b>meat,</b> soups and milk, and boiling them as described. The original inventor had only experimented with small food volumes, whereas Durand envisioned future large scale production and therefore preserved up to 30 pounds (13.6 kg) of meat in one can. For unknown reasons, Durand used only tin cans rather than glass vessels. He arranged for the cans to sail with the Royal Navy for a period of four to six months. Several members of the Royal Society and the Royal Institution examined the food upon its arrival, and found that it was perfectly preserved.|$|R

50|$|Cuisine of Commander Islands (Russian: Командорская кухня) is {{a mixture}} of {{traditional}} Russian cuisine and cuisine of Aleut people, who inhabit the Commander Islands. Commander cuisine is largely based on fish meat, seafood, mushrooms, meat of sea mammals (<b>seals,</b> whales), game <b>meat</b> and vegetable (potato, onion, garlic, carrot) which was brought to the Commander island by Russians.|$|R
25|$|Sailor Carl Wiencke {{was lost}} {{overboard}} {{en route to}} Antarctica, Wiencke Island being named in his honour. Belgica crossed the Antarctic Circle on 15 February 1898. On 3 March, Belgica became wedged in the pack ice. The crew had not prepared for overwintering in Antarctica well. De Gerlache forbade the crew to eat the penguin and <b>seal</b> <b>meat</b> that had been stockpiled because he hated eating it. As a result, scurvy became a problem on board Belgica. Following the death of magnetician Emile Danco on 5 June 1898, the situation worsened. Morale worsened {{after the death of}} Nansen, the ship's cat, on 22 June.|$|E
25|$|Amundsen {{had used}} the {{opportunity}} of learning from the Inuit while on his Gjøa North West passage expedition of 1905. He recruited experienced dog drivers. To {{make the most of}} the dogs he paced them and deliberately kept daily mileages shorter than he need have for 75 percent of the journey, and his team spent up to 16 hours a day resting. His dogs could eat seals and penguins hunted in the Antarctic while Scott's pony fodder had to be brought all the way from England in their ship. It has been later shown that <b>seal</b> <b>meat</b> with the blubber attached is the ideal food for a sledge dog. Amundsen went with 52 dogs, and came back with 11.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason for}} the lack on news was that on 22 July the weather was foggy and Blenden Hall had drifted on to the rocks at Inaccessible Island. Two seamen drowned trying to swim to shore. However {{all the rest of}} the crew and {{passengers}} on Blenden Hall made it to shore safely. Once there, they were marooned for four months. They subsisted on birds, birds' eggs, and <b>seal</b> <b>meat.</b> On 19 October six men sailed for Tristan da Cunha on a boat or raft that the survivors had constructed; this party was never heard from again. The survivors constructed a second boat that with three men aboard reached Tristan da Cunha on 8 November. Two boats set out from the island and rescued the remainder of the survivors.|$|E
50|$|<b>Seal</b> blubber and <b>meat</b> was {{studied to}} help {{understand}} the nutritional composition. Two species {{were evaluated by}} the Department of Biology of the University of Bergen and the National Institute of Nutrition and Seafood Research. The species were the hooded seal (Cystophora cristata) and harp seal (Phagophilus groenlandicus). The specimens {{used in the study}} were taken from Greenland's West Ice.|$|R
5|$|Wild {{initially}} {{estimated that}} they would have to wait one month for rescue, and refused to allow long-term stockpiling of <b>seal</b> and penguin <b>meat</b> because this, in his view, was defeatist. This policy led to sharp disagreements with Thomas Orde-Lees. Orde-Lees was not a popular man, and his presence apparently did little to improve the morale of his companions, unless it was by way of being the butt of their jokes.|$|R
5000|$|Liebig was {{acclaimed}} in The Lancet for revealing [...] "the true {{principles of}} cookery", and physicians promoted [...] "rational diets" [...] {{based on his}} ideas. Well-known British cookery writer Eliza Acton responded to Liebig by modifying the cookery techniques in the third edition of her Modern Cookery for Private Families, and subtitling the edition accordingly. Liebig's idea that [...] "searing <b>meat</b> <b>seals</b> in the juices", though still widely believed, is not true.|$|R
500|$|The {{expedition}} {{succeeded in}} combating incipient scurvy through a fresh <b>seal</b> <b>meat</b> diet, and Scott recommended it for future polar expeditions. This was despite {{the medical profession}} being ignorant {{of the causes of}} the disease. At that time it was known that a fresh meat diet could provide a cure, but not that lack of fresh meat or other fresh food containing the as yet undiscovered vitamin C was a cause. Thus, fresh <b>seal</b> <b>meat</b> was taken on the southern journey [...] "in case we find ourselves attacked by scurvy", On his 1907–09 Nimrod expedition Shackleton also avoided the disease through careful dietary provision, including extra penguin and <b>seal</b> <b>meat.</b> However, Lieutenant Edward Evans almost died of presumably self-inflicted scurvy during the 1910–13 Terra Nova expedition, and scurvy was particularly devastating to Shackleton's marooned Ross Sea party during 1915–16. It remained a danger until its causes were finally established, some 25years after the Discovery expedition.|$|E
500|$|All {{five men}} were showing {{symptoms}} of scurvy with varying severity. [...] However, {{a diet of}} fresh <b>seal</b> <b>meat,</b> rich in [...] Vitamin C, enabled them to recover slowly. [...] By mid-April {{they were ready to}} consider travelling the final [...] across the frozen sea to the base at Cape Evans.|$|E
500|$|They {{were faced}} with two {{possible}} routes back to Cape Denison. The first option was to make for the coast, where they could supplement their meagre supplies with <b>seal</b> <b>meat,</b> and hope to meet with Madigan's party; that would considerably lengthen the journey, and the sea ice in summer could not be relied on. Or, pushing slightly {{to the south of}} their outward route, they could hope to avoid the worst of the crevasses and aim for speed. Mawson chose the inland route, which meant that in the absence of fresh <b>seal</b> <b>meat</b> they would have to resort to eating their remaining dogs. The first dog—George—was killed the following morning, and of his meat some was fried for the men and the rest fed to the now starving dogs. [...] "On the whole it was voted good" [...] wrote Mawson of the meat, [...] "though it had a strong, musty taste and was so stringy that it could not be properly chewed".|$|E
50|$|Suet is {{essential}} in several traditional British dishes. Suet pastry is soft {{in contrast to the}} crispness of shortcrust pastry, which makes it ideal for certain sweet and savoury dishes. Suet is most widely used in sweet puddings, such as jam roly-poly and spotted dick. Savoury dishes include dumplings, which are made using a mixture of suet, flour and water rolled into balls that are added to stews during the final twenty minutes or so of cooking. In the savoury dish steak and kidney pudding, a bowl is lined with suet pastry, the meat is placed inside and a lid of suet pastry tightly <b>seals</b> the <b>meat.</b> The pudding is then steamed for approximately four hours before serving. Suet is also an ingredient of traditional fruit mince (known as 'mincement' in the UK). In recipes calling for suet, substitute (e.g. vegetable) fats usually do not work as well.|$|R
5000|$|Pourgouri, the Cypriot {{name for}} bulgur, is the {{traditional}} carbohydrate other than bread. It is steamed with tomato and onion; a few strands of vermicelli pasta are often added to provide a texture contrast. Along with pourgouri, natural yogurt is a staple. Wheat and yogurt come together in the traditional peasant meal of tarhana/trahanas, a way of preserving milk in which the cracked wheat is steamed, mixed with sour milk, dried, and stored. Small amounts reheated in water or broth provide a nourishing and tasty meal, especially with added cubes of aged halloumi. Pourgouri {{is also used to}} make koupes, the Cypriot form of kibbeh, where the pourgouri is mixed with flour and water to form a dough, which is formed into a cigar shape. A hollow is made through the cigar and a mixture of minced meat, onions, parsley and cinnamon is packed. After <b>sealing</b> the <b>meat</b> mixture inside the cigar they are deep-fried before serving with lemon juice.|$|R
2500|$|The loss of ponies, {{several of}} which had drowned on {{disintegrating}} sea-ice, limited the supplies that could be hauled to the depots. Of 19 ponies brought south to aid in laying depots on the Ross Ice Shelf (traversed during the first and final quarters of the trek) nine were lost before the journey began. Further, unlike dogs which could eat the abundant <b>seal</b> and penguin <b>meat</b> found in Antarctica, the ponies' food had to be carried forward from the ship, vastly increasing the stores {{that had to be}} transported as Scott's expedition moved towards the pole.|$|R
500|$|Supplies {{were now}} running low. Hurley and Macklin were {{sent back to}} Ocean Camp to recover food {{that had been left}} there to lighten the {{sledging}} teams’ burden. On 2 February 1916 Shackleton sent a larger party back, to recover the third lifeboat. Food shortages became acute as the weeks passed, and <b>seal</b> <b>meat,</b> which had added variety to their diet, now became a staple as Shackleton attempted to conserve the remaining packaged rations. In January, all but two teams of the dogs (whose overall numbers had been depleted by mishaps and illness in the preceding months) were shot on Shackleton’s orders, because the dogs' requirements for <b>seal</b> <b>meat</b> were excessive. The final two teams were shot on 2 April, by which time their meat was a welcome addition to the rations. Meanwhile, the rate of drift became erratic; after being held at around 67° for several weeks, at the end of January there was a series of rapid north-eastward movements which, by 17 March, brought Patience Camp to the latitude of Paulet Island, but [...] to its east. [...] "It might have been six hundred for all the chance we had of reaching it across the broken sea-ice", Shackleton recorded.|$|E
500|$|Overall, the depot-laying {{journeys}} established three depots containing [...] of supplies, {{which included}} [...] of <b>seal</b> <b>meat</b> and [...] of paraffin oil. Amundsen learned {{much from the}} journeys, especially on the second, when the dogs struggled with sledges that were too heavy. He decided {{to increase the number}} of dogs for the polar journey, if necessary at the expense of the number of men. The journeys revealed some disunity among the men, particularly between Johansen and Amundsen. During the second depot journey, Johansen openly complained about the unsatisfactory nature of the equipment; Amundsen believed that his authority had been challenged.|$|E
500|$|With {{the help}} of fresh <b>seal</b> <b>meat</b> which halted the ravages of scurvy, the {{survivors}} slowly recovered at Hut Point. The unstable condition of the sea ice in McMurdo Sound prevented them from completing the journey to the Cape Evans base. Conditions at Hut Point were gloomy and depressing, with an unrelieved diet and no normal comforts; Mackintosh in particular found the squalor of the hut intolerable, and dreaded the possibility that, caught at Hut Point, they might miss {{the return of the}} ship. On 8 May 1916, after carrying out reconnaissance {{on the state of the}} sea ice, Mackintosh announced that he and Hayward were prepared to risk the walk to Cape Evans. Against the urgent advice of their comrades, they set off, carrying only light supplies.|$|E
2500|$|One {{example is}} the {{drinking}} of seal blood. When interviewing an Inuit elder, Searles was told that [...] "Inuit food generates a strong flow of blood, a condition considered to be healthy and indicative of a strong body." [...] After the consumption of <b>seal</b> blood and <b>meat,</b> one could look at their veins in the wrist for proof of the strength that Inuit food provides.
