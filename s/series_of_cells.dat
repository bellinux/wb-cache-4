2500|$|The {{nominal voltage}} of a fresh {{alkaline}} cell as established by manufacturer standards is 1.5 V. [...] The effective zero-load voltage of a non discharged alkaline battery, however, varies from 1.50 to 1.65 V, {{depending on the}} purity of the manganese dioxide used and the contents of zinc oxide in the electrolyte. The average voltage under load depends on level of discharge and the amount of current being drawn, varying from 1.1 to 1.3 V. The fully discharged cell will still have a remaining voltage in the range of 0.8 to 1.0 V. [...] Multiple voltages may be achieved with <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> (three new alkaline batteries in series will be able to generate between 4.5 and 5.0 V).|$|E
2500|$|On 19 July 1940 the Special Operations Executive (SOE) {{was founded}} in Britain with orders from Churchill to [...] "set Europe ablaze". The F Section of the SOE was headed by Maurice Buckmaster and {{provided}} invaluable support for the resistance. From May 1941, Freney founded Combat, {{one of the first}} Resistance groups. Frenay recruited for Combat by asking people such questions like if they believed that Britain would not be defeated and if they thought a German victory was worth stopping, and based on the answers he received would ask those whom he thought were inclined to resistance: [...] "Men are already gathering in the shadows. Will you join them?". Frenay, who was to emerge as one of the leading resistance chefs, later wrote: [...] "I myself never attacked a den of collaborators or derailed trains. I never killed a German or a Gestapo agent with my own hand". For security reasons, Combat was divided into a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> that were unaware of each other. Another early resistance groups founded in the summer of 1940 was the ill-fated Interallié group led by a Polish émigré Roman Czerniawski and a Frenchwoman Mathilde Carré codenamed La Chatte (the cat) that passed on intelligence from contacts in the Deuxième Bureau to Britain via couriers from Marseilles.|$|E
