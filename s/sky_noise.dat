40|$|Abstract We {{examined}} the <b>sky</b> confusion <b>noise</b> in 40 <b>sky</b> regions by analysing 175 far-infrared (90 – 200 µm) maps obtained with ISOPHOT, the photometer on-board the Infrared Space Observatory. For cirrus fields with 〈B 〉> 5 MJysr − 1 the formula based on IRAS data (Helou & Beichman, (1990)) predicts confusion noise values within {{a factor of}} 2 to our measurements. The dependence of the <b>sky</b> confusion <b>noise</b> on the surface brightness was determined for the wavelength range 90 ≤ λ ≤ 200 µm. We verified that the confusion noise scales as N ∝ 〈B 〉 1. 5, independent of the wavelength and confirmed N ∝ λ 2. 5 for λ ≥ 100 µm. The scaling of the noise value at different separations between target and reference positions was investigated for the first time, providing a practical formula.

40|$|Fluctuations in the {{brightness}} of the background radiation can lead to confusion with real point sources. Such background emission confusion will be important for infrared observations with relatively large beam sizes since the amount of fluctuation tends to increase with angular scale. In order to quantitively assess the effect of the background emission on the detection of point sources for current and future far-infrared observations by space-borne missions such as Spitzer, ASTRO-F, Herschel and SPICA, we have extended the Galactic emission map to higher angular resolution than the currently available data. Using this high resolution map, we estimate the <b>sky</b> confusion <b>noise</b> due to the emission from interstellar dust clouds or cirrus, based on fluctuation analysis and detailed photometry over realistically simulated images. We find that the confusion noise derived by simple fluctuation analysis agrees well with the result from realistic simulations. Although the <b>sky</b> confusion <b>noise</b> becomes dominant in long wavelength bands (> 100 µm) with 60 – 90 cm aperture missions, it is expected to be two order of magnitude smaller for the next generation space missions with larger aperture sizes such as Herschel and SPICA...|$|R

50|$|Throughout {{their musical}} career, but {{particularly}} {{with respect to}} their first album Juturna, the 2004 film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind has been a large influence on Circa Survive. The album's hidden track is based on the Mark Z. Danielewski novel House of Leaves, lending it an unofficial title. Lyrically, their third album Blue <b>Sky</b> <b>Noise</b> is based on Green's struggles with mental illness, with many of the lyrics written during his voluntary three-week stay in a mental health facility.|$|E
50|$|Circa Survive quickly made a {{name for}} {{themselves}} in the indie music scene in little over two years with their 2005 debut album, Juturna, and second album, On Letting Go, released in 2007. Both albums were released on Equal Vision Records. Their third album, Blue <b>Sky</b> <b>Noise,</b> was released via Atlantic Records in 2010, to critical acclaim. After parting ways with Atlantic Records, the band's fourth album, Violent Waves, was released independently in 2012. Their fifth album, Descensus, was released by Sumerian Records in 2014.|$|E

50|$|In 2010, after mixing for Blue <b>Sky</b> <b>Noise</b> was {{completed}} in February, Circa Survive began performing shows in the midwest United States in March, often accompanied by Good Old War and The Christmas Lights. The band performed at the annual SXSW festival in Austin, Texas, from March 18 to 24. They also performed in Anaheim at the Hoodwink Festival on March 26 and at The Bamboozle on March 27. One month later, following the release of Blue <b>Sky</b> <b>Noise</b> on April 20, Circa Survive embarked on an extended tour with Coheed and Cambria and Torche, beginning in Charlotte, North Carolina, on April 22 and ending on May 29 in Atlantic City. On June 19, 2010, Circa Survive performed at Santa Monica Beach at the Pac Sun Beach Ballyhoo event, which was shut down early due to overcrowding before the band could perform their last two songs. After an eleven-day U.S. west coast tour in late July, Circa Survive embarked on a September European tour with Middle Class Rut, beginning in Hamburg, Germany, on September 6 and ending in Nottingham, England, on September 18. Their show in London on September 15 was streamed live over the Internet and attracted more than 43,000 viewers online.|$|E
50|$|They {{then went}} on their U.S. Blue <b>Sky</b> <b>Noise</b> tour with Animals as Leaders, Dredg and Codeseven. The tour began on October 15, 2010 in Hartford, Connecticut, and {{concluded}} on December 13 in Bakersfield, California. They begin touring with Anberlin and Foxy Shazam in January 2011. On February 17, 2011, Circa Survive performed with Timeout Jimmy at the Rutgers Student Center at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey. They also opened for Linkin Park during the A Thousand Suns Tour for their shows in Dallas and Houston, Texas.|$|E

40|$|The Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) {{mission was}} {{selected}} in May 1999 by the European Space Agency to provide global and frequent soil moisture and sea surface salinity maps. SMOS' single payload is Microwave Imaging Radiometer by Aperture Synthesis (MIRAS), an L band two-dimensional aperture synthesis interferometric radiometer with multiangular observation capabilities. Most geophysical parameter retrieval errors studies have assumed {{the independence of}} measurements both {{in time and space}} so that the standard deviation of the retrieval errors decreases with the inverse of square root of the number of measurements being averaged. This assumption is especially critical in the case of sea surface salinity (SSS), where spatiotemporal averaging is required to achieve the ultimate goal of 0. 1 psu error. This work presents a detailed study of the SSS error reduction by spatiotemporal averaging, using the SMOS end-to-end performance simulator (SEPS), including thermal noise, all instrumental error sources, current error correction and image reconstruction algorithms, and correction of atmospheric and <b>sky</b> <b>noises.</b> The most important error sources are the biases that appear in the brightness temperature images. Three different sources of biases have been identified: errors in the noise injection radiometers, Sun contributions to the antenna temperature, and imaging under aliasing conditions. A calibration technique has been devised to correct these biases prior to the SSS retrieval at each satellite overpass. Simulation results show a retrieved salinity error of 0. 2 psu in warm open ocean, and up to 0. 7 psu at high latitudes and near the coast, where the external calibration method presents more difficulties.

40|$|Abstract. We {{examined}} the <b>sky</b> confusion <b>noise</b> in 40 <b>sky</b> regions by analysing 175 far-infrared (90 { 200 m) maps obtained with ISOPHOT, the photometer on-board the Infrared Space Observatory. For cirrus elds with hBi> 5 MJy sr− 1 the formula based on IRAS data (Helou & Beichman 1990) predicts confusion noise values within {{a factor of}} 2 of our measurements. The dependence of the <b>sky</b> confusion <b>noise</b> on the surface brightness was determined for the wavelength range 90 200 m. We veried that the confusion noise scales as N / hBi 1 : 5, independent of the wavelength and conrmed N / 2 : 5 for 100 m. The scaling of the noise value at dierent separations between target and reference positions was investigated for the rst time, providing a practical formula. Since our results conrm {{the applicability of the}} Helou & Beichman (1990) formula, the cirrus confusion noise predictions made for future space missions with telescopes of a similar size can be trusted. At 90 and 170 m a noise term with a Poissonian spatial distribution was detected in the faintest elds (hBi 3 − 5 MJy sr− 1), which we interpret as fluctuations in the Cosmic Far-Infrared Background (CFIRB). Applying ratios of the fluctuation amplitude to the absolute level of 10 % and 7 % at 90 and 170 m, respectively, as supported by model calculations, we achieved a new simultaneous determination of the fluctuation amplitudes and the surface brightness of the CFIRB. The fluctuation amplitudes are 7 2 mJy and 15 4 mJy at 90 and 170 m, respectively. We obtained a CFIRB surface brightness of B 0 = 0 : 8 0 : 2 MJy sr− 1 (I = 14 3 nW m− 2 sr− 1) at 170 m and an upper limit of 1. 1 MJy sr− 1 (I = 37 nW m− 2 sr− 1) at 90 m...|$|R
5000|$|After {{supporting}} Thrice and Pelican {{for their}} spring 2008 tour, Circa Survive returned to Philadelphia {{to write for}} the then-untitled third album.

50|$|The LO {{signal is}} {{generated}} by a Gunn diode oscillator whose frequency is controlled via a phase-lock loop system by a computer-controlled frequency synthesizer. The SIS mixer and the FET first stage amplifier are on the liquid helium-cooled cold stage of a vacuum dewar; {{the rest of the}} electronics are room temperature. Typical receiver noise temperatures at 115.3 GHz are 65-70 K single sideband (SSB). Although the performance improves somewhat to 55 K SSB if the helium dewar is pumped to 2.7 K, it is not standard observing procedure, because the <b>sky</b> <b>noise</b> at 115 GHz dominates at this level of receiver performance.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} tests of nonGaussianity in CMB maps using {{morphological}} statistics known as Minkowski functionals.

We also introduce a new parameterization of the morphological functions M_i(A) in terms of the total area A of the excursion set. We show that the latter considerably decorrelates the morphological statistics and makes them more robust because they are less sensitive to the measurements at extreme levels. We compare these results with those from 1000 Gaussian Monte Carlo maps with the same <b>sky</b> coverage, <b>noise</b> properties and power spectrum, and conclude that the map is neither a very typical nor a very exceptional realization of a Gaussian field.

5000|$|Green {{announced}} {{the title of}} his second solo album as Beautiful Things in September 2009 while he and the rest of Circa Survive were in Toronto, Canada recording Blue <b>Sky</b> <b>Noise.</b> The album was mainly recorded in early January 2011 at The Big House in Avalon, New Jersey by producer Jason Cupp. Once again the members of Good Old War served as his backup band and helped shape the feel of the songs much more than for Avalon. The album title comes from the lyrics of a Good Old War song entitled [...] "Lullaby" [...] that Green adopted as his own. Anthony's version of [...] "Lullaby" [...] became the closing track of the album. The album was mixed at least seven times over the course of 2011. Green {{announced the}} release date on November 15, 2011. Beautiful Things was released on January 17, 2012, peaking at #27 on the Billboard 200 charts in the United States. A music video for the song [...] "Get Yours While You Can" [...] was shot in late November 2011 and released on January 31, 2012. This album also included many of his friends and idols such as Dave Davison of Maps and Atlases, Nate Ruess of Fun, Chino Moreno of Deftones, and Ida Maria to add some variety to his music.

5000|$|After the {{disbanding}} of This Day Forward, Frangicetto {{met up with}} {{friend and}} vocalist Anthony Green, then lead singer of the California rock band Saosin who, on the surface seemed on track to success. Green had {{decided to take a}} short amount of time off to return to Philadelphia and [...] "hang out for a little bit" [...] when he met with Colin and they began [...] "jamming and writing every day". With the support of Equal Vision Records, who backed them with enough to get things moving after hearing the rough demos, things began to fall into place. Guitarist Brendan Ekstrom, who had previously worked with Colin in This Day Forward, was the first addition to the band. Colin has expressed a sincere admiration for Ekstrom's work in This Day Forward stating [...] "I had always known that if I were to ever start another band I would need and want him with me." [...] Colin, Anthony and Brendan then found drummer Steve Clifford and bassist Nick Beard of Taken to complete the lineup. The group then went on to rent a house near Philadelphia where they found the inspiration for their first EP The Inuit Sessions and eventually their first full-length album Juturna(2005), released April 29, 2005. Juturna was produced by Brian McTernan and went on to peak at #183 on Billboard 200. [...] After the initial success of Juturna, Circa stayed on with Equal Vision Records to release their second full-length album On Letting Go in 2007. The album entered the US billboard at #24 on Billboard 200 selling 24,000 copies in the first week. In 2008, Circa Survive returned from their tour with Thrice and Pelican began working on their third full-length album. On April 20, 2010 they released Blue <b>Sky</b> <b>Noise</b> on Atlantic Records and entered the Us Billboard at #11.|$|E

40|$|The {{impact and}} {{potential}} of a polarization selection technique to reduce sky background signal for linearly polarized monostatic elastic backscatter lidar measurements are examined. Taking advantage of naturally occurring polarization properties in scattered sky light, we devised a polarization discrimination technique in which both the lidar transmitter and receiver track and minimize detected <b>sky</b> background <b>noise</b> while maintaining maximum lidar signal throughput. Lidar elastic backscatter measurements, carried out continuously during daylight hours at 532 nm show {{as much as a}} factor of 10 improvement in signal-to-noise ratio over conventional un-polarized schemes. For vertically pointing lidars, the largest improvements, are limited to the early morning and late afternoon hours, while for non-vertical scanning lidars, significant improvements are achievable over more extended time periods with the specific times and improvement factors depending on the specific angle between the lidar and solar axes. The resulting diurnal variations in SNR improvement sometimes show asymmetry with solar angle, 2 which analysis indicates can be attributed to changes in observed relative humidity that modifies the underlying aerosol microphysics and observed optical depth.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{framework}} for compressive sensing of images with local geometric features. Specifically, let x ∈ R N be an N-pixel image, where each pixel p has value xp. The image is acquired by computing the measurement vector Ax, where A is an m × N measurement matrix for some m ≪ N. The goal is then to design the matrix A and recovery algorithm which, given Ax, returns an approximation to x. In this paper we investigate this problem for the case where x consists of a small number (k) of “local geometric objects ” (e. g., stars in {{an image of a}} <b>sky),</b> plus <b>noise.</b> We construct a matrix A and recovery algorithm with the following features: (i) the number of measurements m is O(k log k N), which undercuts currently known schemes that achieve m = O(k log(N/k)) (ii) the matrix A is ultra-sparse, which is important for hardware considerations (iii) the recovery algorithm is fast and runs in time sub-linear in N.
