5000|$|A typical FM {{two-way radio}} carrier squelch circuit is noise operated. It {{takes out the}} voice {{components}} of the receive audio by passing the detected audio through a high-pass filter. A typical filter might pass frequencies over 4,000 Hz (4 kHz). The <b>squelch</b> <b>control</b> adjusts the gain of an amplifier which varies the level of noise {{coming out of the}} filter. The audio output of the filter and amplifier is rectified and produces a DC voltage when noise is present. The presence of continuous noise on an idle channel creates a DC voltage which turns the receiver audio off. When a signal with little or no noise is received, the noise-derived voltage goes away and the receiver audio is unmuted. Some applications have the receiver tied to other equipment that uses the audio muting control voltage as a [...] "signal present" [...] indication, for example in a repeater the act of the receiver unmuting will switch on the transmitter.|$|E
50|$|Audio {{equipment}} {{associated with}} radio transmitters, particularly transceivers in two way radios, such as Citizens band, FRS, which have automatic gain <b>control</b> (AGC) or <b>squelch</b> noise <b>control.</b> Malfunctions in the AGC or squelch circuits, which have long time constants, can cause low frequency oscillation. Another possible cause, sometimes {{in combination with}} the first, is leakage of the strong radio frequency (RF) signal from the transmitter into the receiver audio sections, which can cause quenching oscillations. This is a RFI problem, caused by inadequate shielding or filtering to keep the RF out.|$|R
