25|$|Australian Motors Mazda {{released}} a limited run of 250 'Sports' model Series 4 RX-7's; each with no power <b>steering,</b> <b>power</b> windows or rear wiper {{as an attempt}} to reduce the weight of the car.|$|E
25|$|In July 2004, on the Crown Majesta, Toyota {{offered a}} Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management (VDIM) system that {{incorporated}} formerly independent systems, including ESC. This worked not {{only after the}} skid was detected but also to prevent the skid from occurring in the first place. Using electric variable gear ratio <b>steering</b> <b>power</b> steering, this more advanced system could also alter steering gear ratios and steering torque levels to assist the driver in evasive manoeuvres.|$|E
25|$|In 1970, the 98s {{were the}} largest Oldsmobiles. They still shared the luxury side of Oldsmobile {{business}} with the Toronado. Standard equipment included: Turbo-Hydramatic 400 transmission, power <b>steering,</b> <b>power</b> brakes with front discs, power windows, power seats, Deluxe steering wheel, electric clock and full wheel discs. Standard tire size was J78-15. Interiors were vinyl, cloth or leather. All 98s were made in Lansing indicated by the codel letter M in the Vehicle Identification Number. The length grew to 225.2inches.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Steering</b> Type: Electrohydraulic <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> with fluid {{reservoir}} in motor compartment. <b>Steering</b> rack with <b>power</b> <b>steering.</b> Turning diameter: 29.5 ft.|$|R
50|$|<b>Power</b> <b>steering</b> helps drivers steer by augmenting the driver's <b>steering</b> effort. <b>Power</b> <b>steering</b> {{has used}} {{hydraulics}} to reduce a driver's steering effort. However, hydraulic steering is {{being replaced by}} electric <b>power</b> <b>steering,</b> because it eliminates the hydraulic pump, and increases fuel efficiency.|$|R
25|$|As {{befitting}} {{a luxury}} car, Toronados featured {{a long list}} of standard equipment that included Turbo Hydra-Matic transmission, variable-ratio power <b>steering,</b> <b>power</b> front disc brakes along with an electric clock, carpeting and deluxe wheel covers. Virtually all Toronados were sold loaded with extra-cost options including air conditioning, AM/FM stereo with 8-track tape player, power trunk release, vinyl roof, tilt and telescopic steering wheel, cruise control, power windows, power door locks and six-way power seats. Power windows became standard equipment in 1975. A new feature in 1974 was a gauge that monitored if the driver was driving economically or not.|$|E
25|$|In 1976 the Luxury and Regency {{editions of}} the {{full-size}} 98s were offered, in 2-door coupes or 4-door hardtops. 4-doors had an extra window (like an opera window) in the C-pillar. A landau roof option for the coupe gave it a huge-looking opera window. Like the Custom Cruiser, 98s had a dual section eggcrate-design grille, with new front end panel, front bumper, and wraparound horizontal parking lamps. Amber marker lenses aligned with the headlamps wrapped around the fender sides. Separate clear cornering lamps had horizontal ribs. Vertical tailamps were decorated with a small emblem in each lens. Tiny back-up lamps stood alongside the license plate, on a panel that also contained small red lenses next to the tailamps. Standard 98 equipment included a 455 CID Rocket V8 with 4-barrel carburetor, Turbo-Hydramatic, vari-ratio power <b>steering,</b> <b>power</b> brakes, power driver's seat, driver's door armrest control console, electronic message center, electric clock, fold-down center armrests, front ashtray, and JR78 x 15 blackwall steel-belted radials. Rear fender skirts and bumper impact strips were also standard. A new 2.41:1 axle ratio became standard to improve fuel economy.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} {{innovations}} were either invented or improved sufficiently {{to allow for}} mass production during the decade: air conditioning, automatic transmission, power <b>steering,</b> <b>power</b> brakes, seat belts and arguably the most influential change in automotive history, the overhead-valve V8 engine. [...] The horsepower race had begun, laying {{the foundation for the}} muscle car era.|$|E
50|$|This {{is not to}} be {{confused}} with Electric <b>Power</b> <b>Steering.</b> Electric <b>Power</b> <b>Steering</b> can be considered as a stage of evolution from mechanical steering to steer by wire systems.|$|R
50|$|All 1974 Furys came {{standard}} with TorqueFlite automatic transmission, <b>power</b> <b>steering,</b> and <b>power</b> front disc brakes.|$|R
50|$|According to the May 1984 brochure, the coupe added: alloy wheels, mudflaps, {{electric}} windows/mirrors/antenna, a six speaker {{sound system}} (over four), time delay interior lighting, variable intermittent wipers, an armrest, carpet kickpads, and cloth headlining/sunvisors/door trims (over vinyl). An option pack for the coupe added air conditioning, <b>power</b> <b>steering,</b> and <b>power</b> sunroof. The hatchback's option pack added air conditioning, <b>power</b> <b>steering,</b> and <b>power</b> sunroof.|$|R
500|$|Regardless {{how it is}} credited, the {{horsepower}} race {{centered around}} the V8 engine and the muscle-car era lasted until new smog regulations forced dramatic changes in OEM engine design in the early 1970s. This in turn opened up new opportunities for aftermarket manufacturers like Edelbrock. Each year brought larger engines and/or increases in horsepower, providing a catalyst for customers to upgrade to newer models. Automobile executives also deliberately updated the body designs yearly, {{in the name of}} [...] "planned obsolescence" [...] and added newly developed or improved features such as automatic transmissions, power <b>steering,</b> <b>power</b> brakes and cruise control, {{in an effort to make}} the previous models seem outdated and facilitate the long drive from the suburbs. Record sales made the decade arguably the [...] "golden era" [...] of automobile manufacturing.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Power</b> <b>steering.</b> Older {{hydraulic}} <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> {{systems are}} <b>powered</b> by a hydraulic pump constantly engaged to the engine. Power assistance required for steering is {{inversely proportional to}} the vehicle speed so the constant load on the engine from a hydraulic pump reduces fuel efficiency. More modern designs improve fuel efficiency by only activating the power assistance when needed; this is done by using either direct electrical <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> assistance or an electrically powered hydraulic pump.|$|R

2500|$|The Mark II was {{an attempt}} by the newly created Continental {{division}} of Ford Motor Company to offer a car not only to rival the greatest American and European automobiles of the pre-War era but anything built after. [...] It came equipped with nearly every conceiveable luxury as standard equipment [...] power <b>steering,</b> <b>power</b> brakes, power windows, power seats, power vent windows, leather interior, and a tachometer [...] it had only one option: air conditioning for $595.|$|E
2500|$|Starting in 1971, the AMI-built Matador was {{available}} in sedan and wagon body styles. Standard equipment included automatic transmission, power <b>steering,</b> <b>power</b> windows, air conditioning, and an AM radio. The engine was AMC's [...] V8, following its introduction in the 1970 Rebel. Among the options were an exterior mounted sun visor, vinyl roof cover, tow hitch, and mud flaps. The cars were targeted at the top market segment and advertised as [...] "the American luxury limousine made for Australians" [...] and built for Australian conditions.|$|E
2500|$|In 1960, {{once again}} {{the top of the}} line Oldsmobile series was the 98. Standard {{equipment}} included Safety-vee steering wheel, turn signals, air scoop brakes, electric windshield wipers, safety-spectrum speedometer, carpets with rubber inserts, padded dash, courtesy lamps, wheel trim rings, Star-lite headliner, two-speed windshield wipers, chrome roof side moldings, Jetaway Hydramatic transmission, power <b>steering,</b> <b>power</b> brakes, windshield washers, electric clock, and deep twist carpeting. Upholstery was fabric, leather, or Morocceen in a variety of colors. Tire size was [...] by [...] An anti-spin rear axle was optional.|$|E
50|$|In mid-1971, a Turbo-Hydramatic transmission, <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> and <b>power</b> front-disc brakes became {{standard}} equipment on Bonneville and other full-sized Pontiacs (as {{well as other}} full-sized GM cars).|$|R
50|$|Improvements to cooling {{in exhaust}} side at {{cylinder}} heads, <b>steering</b> rack, <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> pump, soundproofing, front cooling flaps deleted, new style shift knob with integrated leather booth in manual gearbox cars, etc.|$|R
5000|$|Level 2: <b>Power</b> <b>steering,</b> front <b>power</b> windows, 2-speaker stereo, side body cladding, and rear-window wiper standard. 2 x 6 W {{sound system}} with steering-wheel-mounted {{controls}} (especially designed by Philips for this model) optional.|$|R
2500|$|The Series 1 was {{produced}} in both supercharged and normally aspirated versions. Supercharged cars were also outfitted by the factory with larger brakes and a heavy duty clutch. Performance is near [...] "supercar" [...] category with a 0 to 60 mph time at 4.1 seconds for the supercharged version. [...] Nicely optioned, Series 1 had power <b>steering,</b> <b>power</b> disc brakes, factory air conditioning, power windows, and an AM/FM/CD audio system. The convertible top folded away {{out of sight in}} a compartment located behind the cockpit. Some component cars were sold as roadsters, with no convertible top.|$|E
2500|$|... 1974 {{introduced}} the Valiant Brougham and its twin, the Dodge Dart Special Edition. Available in two- or four-door models, {{they were a}} compact luxury car meant as an attractive alternative to larger luxury cars following the 1973 oil crisis. The Brougham had generous chrome trim, a vinyl top, deep cut-pile carpeting, velour cloth upholstery, interior door padding, color-keyed or simulated wire wheel covers, and a special selection of paint and trim combinations. Much of the optional equipment on a regular Valiant became standard equipment on Brougham models such as power <b>steering,</b> <b>power</b> disc brakes, air conditioning, cruise control, electric rear window defroster and an AM/FM radio.|$|E
2500|$|The largest 1962 Oldsmobiles {{were again}} the 98s. Five body styles were offered {{including}} three 4-doors plus {{an open and}} a closed 2-door. The Holiday Coupe was renamed the Holiday Sport Coupe, and the Sport Sedan was renamed the Holiday Sport Sedan, so once again, at least temporarily, all hardtops were called Holidays. [...] Ninety-Eights were well appointed with standard equipment including padded dash, guard beam frame, live rubber body cushions, coil springs, foam rubber seats, two-speed windshield wipers, parking brake lights, courtesy lamp package, special moldings, Roto Hydramatic, power brakes, power <b>steering,</b> <b>power</b> windows and power seat. Interiors were leather, vinyl or cloth. Standard tire size was 8.50 x 14inches.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} <b>power</b> <b>{{steering}}</b> {{is to reduce}} the driver’s effort at the steering wheel. Steering wheel that the spooked hand wheel {{at the top of the}} steering column of an automobile which actuates the steering gear. Such a system is used in heavy commercial vehicle and therefore, application of <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> in car, is the biggest question today is. Because as per norms of <b>power</b> <b>steering,</b> whose vehicle unladen weight is more than 1500 kgs, may affect as the proper norms. However, introducing of <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> in car, in terms of prefect steering is to a problem by means of dragging, while sudden applied of brake. <b>Power</b> <b>steering</b> mechanism employs Electrical Devices, Compressed Air and Hydraulic pressure. There are two types of <b>power</b> <b>steering,</b> i. e. integral and linkage. The integral type, the <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> systems forms part of the steering gear, where as linkage type, it forms part of the steering linkage...|$|R
50|$|In March 1971, the three-speed Turbo Hydra-matic {{transmission}} became {{standard on}} all Centurions {{as well as}} the lower-priced LeSabres. Variable-ratio <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> and <b>power</b> front disc brakes were standard equipment during the entire model year.|$|R
50|$|The {{integral}} hydraulic <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> is <b>powered</b> by a gear-driven pump working directly off the engine. This {{approach has}} eliminated {{the requirement for}} belt drives which slip or break and steering cylinders that require maintenance.|$|R
2500|$|The Oldsmobile line {{underwent}} a sweeping reengineering in 1957, with a 3-piece rear window making a reappearance on some models. [...] Once again the 4-door 98's {{were at the}} top, this year officially titled Starfire 98. Standard equipment included armrests, turn signals, rubber floor mats, sun visors, front fender chrome script, exposed chrome roof bows, side interior courtesy lights, electric windows, special emblems, power <b>steering,</b> <b>power</b> brakes, and Jetaway Hydramatic. Upholstery choices included a variety of cloth, Morocceen (vinyl), and leather. Standard tire size was [...] by [...] The standard engine was now the [...] Rocket V8. A safety recessed steering wheel was added. Front leg room was [...]|$|E
2500|$|Along {{with the}} new engines, the Rambler American Hardtop model was reintroduced. It {{featured}} luxury and sporty touches of the original model and was once again a low-volume limited edition. The cars came standard with the two-barrel [...] version of the 232 engine coupled to a Borg-Warner [...] "Flash-o-Matic" [...] three-speed automatic transmission with floor shift. Other standards included luxury steering wheel, individually adjustable and reclining front seats, high-trim upholstery, center console with locking compartment, custom wheel covers, full bright molding package and underdash tissue holder. Despite incorporating {{the top of the}} line engine plus the sportier and more luxurious focus of this version compared to its 1963 counterpart, several performance-minded and luxury items were still optional such as seat belts, power <b>steering,</b> <b>power</b> brakes and a heater.|$|E
2500|$|For 1959, the Oldsmobile line-up was {{completely}} redesigned. However, unlike other GM makes (such as Chevrolet and Cadillac) Oldsmobile {{continued to use}} a full perimeter frame, instead of the GM X-frame. The 98 shared its appearance with the Oldsmobile 88. Oldsmobile stayed with its top series format by offering four body styles on an exclusive [...] wheelbase. Standard equipment included oil filter, turn signals, air scoop brakes, Safety spectrum speedometer, rocker panel moldings, special emblems, parking brake light, sponge vinyl headliner, deep twist carpeting, electric clock, wheel trim moldings, power <b>steering,</b> <b>power</b> brakes, and Jetaway Hydramatic Drive. Interiors were selected from leather, Moroccean, or cloth in different colors. Standard tire size was [...] by [...] The , the largest first generation Rocket V8, was used from 1959 until 1964.|$|E
5000|$|Non-assisted {{rack and}} pinion <b>steering</b> system (<b>power</b> {{assistance}} is allowed) ...|$|R
50|$|A {{hydraulic}} <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> (HPS) uses {{hydraulic pressure}} supplied by an engine-driven pump {{to assist the}} motion of turning the <b>steering</b> wheel. Electric <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> (EPS) is more efficient than hydraulic <b>power</b> <b>steering,</b> since the electric <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> motor only needs to provide assistance when the steering wheel is turned, whereas the hydraulic pump must run constantly. In EPS, the amount of assistance is easily tunable to the vehicle type, road speed, and even driver preference. An added benefit is the elimination of environmental hazard posed by leakage and disposal of hydraulic <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> fluid. In addition, electrical assistance is not lost when the engine fails or stalls, whereas hydraulic assistance stops working if the engine stops, making the steering doubly heavy as the driver must now turn not only the very heavy steering—without any help—but also the power-assistance system itself.|$|R
25|$|At {{the start}} of the model year, variable-ratio <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> and <b>power</b> drum brakes were {{optional}} equipment. Those items were made standard equipment on all LeSabres (and Wildcats) effective January 1, 1970. Power front disc brakes remained an extra-cost option.|$|R
