50|$|The {{feathers}} are brittle; <b>shuttlecocks</b> break {{easily and}} often {{need to be}} replaced several times during a game. For this reason, synthetic <b>shuttlecocks</b> have been developed that replace the feathers with a plastic skirt. Players often refer to synthetic <b>shuttlecocks</b> as plastics and feathered <b>shuttlecocks</b> as feathers.|$|R

25|$|Typically {{the sweep}} takes the simple {{form of an}} {{advancement}} of the surface, such that the surface is expanded in a symmetric manner about its advancement axis, with the advancement rate set by a volume attributed to each ion detected and identified. This causes the final reconstructed volume to assume a rounded-conical shape, similar to a badminton <b>shuttlecock.</b> The detected events thus become a point cloud data with attributed experimentally measured values, such as ion time of flight or experimentally derived quantities, e.g. time of flight or detector data.|$|E

They travelled 1500 miles southeast across India, still disguised as British soldiers, to the Japanese lines in Burma. Along the way, in an effort to maintain their disguise, they shared railway compartments and restaurant tables with actual British officers. On several occasions they were almost caught by military police.|$|E
500|$|On 30 September {{the ship}} {{sustained}} what Shackleton described as [...] "the worst squeeze we had experienced". Worsley described the pressure as like being [...] "thrown {{to and fro}} like a <b>shuttlecock</b> a dozen times". On 24 October, the starboard side was forced against a large floe, increasing the pressure until the hull began to bend and splinter, so that water from below the ice began to pour into the ship. When the timbers broke they made noises which sailors later described as being similar {{to the sound of}} [...] "heavy fireworks and the blasting of guns". The supplies and three lifeboats were transferred to the ice, while the crew attempted to shore up the boat's hull and pump out the incoming sea, but after a few days, on 27 October 1915, and in freezing temperatures below −15°F (−25°C), Shackleton gave the order to abandon ship. The position at abandonment was [...] 69°05′S, 51°30′W. [...] The wreckage remained afloat, and over the following weeks the crew salvaged further supplies and materials, including Hurley's photographs and cameras that had initially been left behind. From around 550plates Hurley chose the best 150, the maximum that could be carried, and smashed the rest.|$|E
40|$|AbstractFeather <b>shuttlecocks</b> are chiral bodies whose {{rotation}} properties, such as trajectory and velocity, {{affect their}} motion states. This study proposes an experimental method {{to simulate the}} rotation properties of <b>shuttlecocks.</b> The effect of wind velocity on the angular velocity of refitting <b>shuttlecocks</b> is tested in a wind tunnel. The refitting parts lie on the cork of the <b>shuttlecocks</b> to avoid affecting {{the shape of the}} feather and the friction between air and the feather. Two types of moments are assumed to act on the shuttlecocks: driving and resistance. The driving moment is dependent on relative airflow velocity, whereas the resistance moment is related to rotation speed. Basing on wind tunnel experimental data, we illustrate the curves of the resistance and driving moments. Results provide theoretical guidance in the design of synthetic <b>shuttlecocks</b> and analysis of badminton techniques...|$|R

500|$|The {{major part}} of the north wing is {{occupied}} by the medieval Great Hall. [...] This has a hammer-beam roof, with carvings of angels that were added at a later date. [...] The roof is plastered, but has been painted {{in such a way that}} it appears to be panelled. [...] At the end that would have originally been occupied by the high table is [...] "the finest canopy in the county", according to the authors of the Buildings of England series. [...] This is [...] "a rare wooden version of the cloths of estate hung over the high table in the Middle Ages to give splendour to the appearance of the Lord of the Manor". [...] It consists of five tiers of panels, divided by oak ribs into 60compartments, each of which is painted with the arms of Cheshire families. [...] At the intersections of the ribs, instead of bosses, there are carved letters spelling out an inscription including the date 1505. [...] At one time the scheme may have been greater, as an account dated 1611 records a display of over 180 coats of arms. [...] Under the canopy is a mural of Hector and Andromache. [...] The side walls contain murals depicting the history of Troy. [...] The latter had been painted over until they were revealed in 1859, when the family were playing with a <b>shuttlecock</b> and damaged the overlying plaster. [...] The other end of the hall is supported by a spere truss formed by two giant oak trunks, carved into an octagonal shape and covered in panels. [...] Within the spere truss is an organ (see below). [...] To the sides of the organ are murals depicting, on one side Arabella Hunt, and on the other Saint Cecilia playing a harp. [...] Below the murals were the doors to the buttery and pantry. [...] Both doors are now blocked, replaced by panels carved with animals and foliage. [...] Also in the Great Hall is a fireplace decorated with the head of Apollo.|$|E
2500|$|The {{history of}} sports in India {{dates back to}} the Vedic era. Physical culture in ancient India was fuelled by {{religious}} rights. The mantra in the Atharvaveda, says, [...] "Duty is in my right hand and the fruits of victory in my left." [...] In terms of an ideal, these words hold the same sentiments as the traditional Olympic Oath: [...] "For the Honour of my Country and the Glory of Sport." [...] Badminton probably originated in India as a grownup's version of a very old children's game known in England as battledore and <b>shuttlecock,</b> the battledore being a paddle and the <b>shuttlecock</b> a small feathered cork, now usually called a [...] "bird." [...] Games like chess (chaturanga), snakes and ladders, playing cards, originated in India, and it was from here that these games were transmitted to foreign countries, where they were further modernised.|$|E
2500|$|The probe-and-drogue {{refueling}} method {{employs a}} flexible hose that trails from the tanker aircraft. [...] The drogue (or para-drogue), sometimes called a basket, is a fitting resembling a <b>shuttlecock,</b> attached at its narrow end (like the [...] "cork" [...] nose of a <b>shuttlecock)</b> with a valve to a flexible hose. [...] The drogue stabilizes the hose in flight {{and provides a}} funnel to aid insertion of the receiver aircraft probe into the hose. [...] The hose connects to a Hose Drum Unit (HDU). [...] When not in use, the hose/drogue is reeled completely into the HDU. The receiver has a probe, which is a rigid, protruding or pivoted retractable arm placed on the aircraft's nose or fuselage to make the connection. [...] Most modern versions of the probe are usually designed to be retractable, and are retracted when not in use, particularly on high speed aircraft.|$|E
