40|$|Aqueous {{solubility}} is {{an essential}} characteristic assessed during drug development to determine a compound’s drug-likeness since solubility plays an important pharmaceutical role. However, {{nearly half of the}} drug candidates discovered today display poor water solubility; therefore methods have to be applied to increase solubility. Solubility determination using the CheqSol method is a novel rapid solubility screening technique for ionisable compounds. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine if the CheqSol method can be employed to determine solubility increases of four test drugs (ibuprofen, gliclazide, atenolol and propranolol) induced by non-ionising excipients such as hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin and poloxamers 407 and 188.

The measured intrinsic solubility of all four drugs increased with all the excipients tested in an excipient concentration dependent manner providing results consistent with previous literature. The results demonstrate that it may be possible to use this method to determine the solubility increases induced by non-ionic solubilising excipients with results that are comparable to standard equilibrium based solubility techniques.

The permeability of TCS from gel, rehydrated gel and lyophilized gel (LG) through semipermeable cellophane membrane was studied by using Franz diffusion cells. The flux was lowest from the rehydrated gel and highest from the gel.

40|$|The {{formulation}} of drug compounds into medicines will increasingly {{rely on the}} use of specially tailored molecules, which fundamentally alter the drug's pharmacokinetics to enable its therapeutic activity. This is particularly true of the more challenging hydrophobic drugs or therapeutic biological molecules. The demand for such enabled medicines will translate into a demand for advanced highly functionalised drug delivery materials. Polymers have been used to formulate medicines for many decades and this is unlikely to change soon. Amphiphilic polymers based on amino acids are the subject of this review. These molecules, which present as either poly(L-amino acid) block copolymers or poly(L-amino acid) backbones with hydrophobic substituents, self assemble into micelles, vesicles, nanofibres and solid nanoparticles and such self assemblies, have drug delivery capabilities. The nature of the self-assembly depends on the chemistry of the constituent molecules, with the more hydrophilic molecules forming nanosized micellar aggregates including peptide nanofibres, molecules of intermediate hydrophobicity forming polymeric vesicles and the more hydrophobic variants forming amorphous polymeric nanoparticles of 100 - 1000 nm in diameter. The self-assemblies may be loaded with drugs or may present as micelle forming polymer-drug conjugates and the supramolecular aggregates have been employed as drug <b>solubilisers,</b> tumour targeting agents, gene delivery vectors and facilitators of intracellular drug uptake, with a more promising polymer-drug conjugate progressing to clinical testing.

This study aims to investigate these relationships which will include a survey of the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal populations associated with Spekboom, determination of the causal agent of Spekboom decline, isolation and identification of the associated rhizobacteria and investigation of their plant growth promotion properties and assessing the ability of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and selected rhizobacteria to enhance establishment and growth of Spekboom. Soil and root samples from selected trial sites were used to assess AM fungal spore abundance and colonisation; isolation, characterization, and identification of rhizobacteria and determine the interaction of the microbes on Spekboom growth and tolerance to Fusarium. AM spore abundance and percentage root colonisation did not differ between the three Spekboom plots. Molecular analyses of the SSU region from the plots showed 4 families of AM fungi and were identified as Ambisporaceae, Glomeraceae, Claroideoglomeraceae and Paraglomeraceae. A suspected Fusarium pathogen was isolated and molecularly identified. Pathogenicity tests indicated reduced Spekboom growth with poor root development.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, {{concepts}} for the continuous synthesis of enantiopure, long-chain, aliphatic (R) - 2 -alcohols ((R) - 2 -octanol to (R) - 2 -decanol) {{starting from the}} corresponding 2 -ketones were elaborated. The alcohol dehydrogenase from Lactobacillus brevis (LbADH) is the catalyst of choice with so far unmatched enantioselectivity. For reaction engineering the main challenge is the low solubility of substrates and products in aqueous solutions which is mandatory for activity and stability of LbADH. Strategies to overcome this challenge for synthesis were elaborated based on previous work. Later, these strategies were applied in continuous experiments. The most interesting systems are a monophasic approach using an ionic liquid (IL, TEGO IL K 5) as <b>solubiliser</b> {{as well as a}} biphasic approach with an organic solvent (methyl-tert-butylether, (MTBE) as substrate and product reservoir. For LbADH catalysed reduction the reduced nicotinamide cofactor NADPH is compulsory as hydride source. NADPH cannot be used in stoichiometric amounts for economic reasons. Therefore, the cofactor is regenerated in situ. The applicable cofactor regeneration systems were chosen for the actual synthesis mode. In the biphasic synthesis, a substrate-coupled cofactor regeneration using 2 -propanol was used. In miniaturised continuous experiments with a continuous exchange of the organic phase, a total runtime of 320 h with turnover numbers (TON) of TON(LbADH) = 186 · 103 and TON(NADP) = 26 · 103 were achieved. With this setup a conversion of only 31 % were achieved. In consequence, the main focus was shifted to the monophasic approach. In the monophasic synthesis mode, the cofactor regeneration was carried out enzyme coupled with a glucose dehydrogenase from Bacillus spec. (GDH) and glucose as hydride donor. Enzymes were retained by ultrafiltration in an enzyme membrane reactor (EMR). With this setup a remarkably long total runtime of up to 1150 h with turnover numbers of TON(LbADH) = 46 · 106 and TON(NADP) = 26 · 103 were achieved. The key values for the monophasic approach were much better compared to the ones obtained in the biphasic approach. For this reason, the monophasich approach was chosen for a computer-aided optimisation using a process model based on initial rates and cofactor stabilities In total, the costs could be reduced from 150 Euro/kg(product) to 52 Euro/kg(product) and the enviromental impact was decreased with the E-Factor (kg(waste) /kg(product)) from 130 to 30. The monophasic reduction of 2 -ketones in an enzyme-membrane reactor is therefore a good possibility to produce enantiopure alcohols. The low solubility of the substrates and products can be overcome using the IL TEGO IL K 5. Costs as well as envormental impact render the results attractive for the production of fine chemicals such as the sparingly soluble long-chain enantiopure aliphatic alcohols...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND—Cholesterol gall {{stones are}} a {{frequent}} disease for which at present surgery {{is the usual}} therapy. Despite the importance of bile acids it has become evident that phospholipids are the main cholesterol <b>solubilisers</b> in bile. Even phospholipid components, such as fatty acids, have anticrystallising activity.  AIM—To synthesise fatty acid bile acid conjugates (FABACs) and study their effects on cholesterol crystallisation in bile in vitro and in vivo.  METHODS—FABACs were prepared by conjugation of cholic acid at position 3  with saturated fatty acids of variable chain length using an amide bond. Cholesterol crystallisation and its kinetics (crystal observation time, crystal mass) were studied in model bile, pooled enriched human bile, and fresh human bile using FABACs with saturated fatty acids of varying chain length (C- 6 to C- 22). Absorption of FABACs into blood and bile was tested in hamsters. Prevention of biliary cholesterol crystallisation in vivo was tested in hamsters and inbred mice.  RESULTS—FABACs strongly inhibited cholesterol crystallisation in model as well as native bile. The FABACs with longer acyl chains (C- 16 to C- 22) were more effective. At a concentration of 5  mM, FABACs almost completely inhibited cholesterol crystallisation in fresh human bile for 21  days. FABACs were absorbed and found in both portal and heart blood of hamsters. Levels in bile were 2 - 3 times higher than in blood, indicating active secretion. Appreciable levels {{were found in the}} systemic circulation 24 - 48 hours after a single administration. Ingested FABACs completely prevented the formation of cholesterol crystals in the gall bladders of hamsters and mice fed a lithogenic diet.  CONCLUSIONS—FABACs are potent inhibitors of cholesterol crystallisation in bile. They are absorbed and secreted into bile and prevent the earliest step of cholesterol gall stone formation in animals. These compounds may be of potential use in cholesterol gall stone disease in humans.    Keywords: gall stones; bile; phospholipids; cholesterol crystallisation; fatty acid bile acid conjugate...|$|R

This work contributes to the limited information available on the release of poorly soluble drugs from medicated chewing gum formulations. Lansoprazole was chosen as a model drug due to its poor solubility and instability (under acidic conditions), thus a chewing gum formulation would be of particular benefit avoiding gastrointestinal degradation. The solubility and stability of lansoprazole in artificial saliva {{was found to be}} dependent on the pH of the solution. An increase in pH caused an increase in solubility with a significant increase between pH 9 and pH 10. At pH 6, concentrations decreased over time confirming the acid instability of lansoprazole. The use of cyclodextrins as <b>solubilisers</b> and stabilisers for lansoprazole were investigated; complexed lansoprazole (with Mβ-CD, 1 : 1) resulted in a 9 fold increase in solubility compared to free lansoprazole and remained stable at pH 6. Chewing gum formulations incorporating lansoprazole were prepared and the following excipients were investigated: Revolymer‟s® hydrophilic polymer Rev 7, buffering excipients and complexed lansoprazole (with Mβ-CD, 1 : 1). Drug diffusion from gum surfaces was found to be limited, highlighting the need for effective mastication to ensure the timely release of the drug. In vitro release was evaluated using the EP approved masticator. Various parameters were investigated including: the type of dissolution medium, pH, chew rate and sampling and replacement volumes. Significant differences in release after 30 minutes mastication were found for gums containing Rev 7 and potassium carbonate (both of which contributed to increasing the hydrophilic capacity of the gum). These gums were also softer than other formulations due to a plasticising effect on the gum base elastomer resulting in softer, less cohesive gums. Complexation was not found {{to have an impact on}} in vitro drug release from gums. The study also assessed the buccal absorption of free lansoprazole and complexed lansoprazole (with Mβ-CD, 1 : 1) using porcine buccal mucosae. The highest partitioning coefficient was observed for free lansoprazole at pH 6. 8 due to a lower ionised fraction in combination with a lower molecular weight. Complexed lansoprazole had the highest drug flux but also had the paradoxical effect of decreasing the permeability coefficient. Overall the study contributed to increasing the understanding of factors governing the release of a poorly soluble and unstable API, lansoprazole, from a medicated chewing gum formulation.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the rehabilitation potential of AM fungi with organic and inorganic fertilisers under pot and field trial conditions {{as well as their}} interaction with rhizospheric organisms and specific functional groups. In addition, the study highlighted the effects of land-use management on AM fungal populations in soil and the mycorrhizal status of some selected plants from one of the study sites. The study focussed on two sites that differ in operational activities and these included a mined area that was to be rehabilitated and a commercial farming site. A pot trial was conducted using an overburdened soil resulting from kaolin clay mining. Pots were seeded with Cynodon dactylon and treated with either Organic Tea or NPK (3 : 1 : 5) fertiliser, with or without AM fungal inoculum. The compatibility of these fertilisers with AM fungi was assessed by plant growth and percentage root colonisation. Maximum shoot height and plant biomass were observed at the 28 th week with NPK (3 : 1 : 5) fertiliser supporting mycorrhizal colonisation by 80 %. The result indicated the potential of AM fungi to be used in rehabilitation with minimal phosphate fertiliser. Similarly, a field trial was set-up using 17 x 17 m[superscript 2] plots in the mining site that were treated with the same organic and inorganic fertilisers as well as with AM fungal inoculum in different combinations. The interaction between AM fungi and soil microbial population was determined using culture dependent and culture independent techniques. The culture dependent technique involved the use of soil dilution and plating on general purpose and selective media. The result showed that there was no change in the total culturable bacterial number in the untreated and AM fungal treated plots, while a change in species composition was observed in the functional groups. Different functional groups identified included nitrogen fixing bacteria, pseudomonads, actinomycetes, phosphate <b>solubilisers</b> and the fungal counterparts. Gram-positive bacteria were observed as the predominant phenotypic type, while nitrogen fixers and actinomycetes were the predominant functional groups. Species identified from each functional group were Pseudomonas fulva, Bacillus megaterium, Streptomyces and actinomycetales bacteria. Meanwhile, fungi such as Ampelomyces, Fusarium, Penicillium, Aspergillus, Cephalosporium and Exserohilium were identified morphologically and molecularly. Furthermore, the mining site had a significantly higher bacterial number than the farming site thereby indicating the effects of land-use management on culturable bacterial numbers. The culture independent technique was carried out by cloning of the bacterial 16 S rDNA and sequencing. Identified clones were Bradyrhizobium, Propionibacterium and Sporichthya. A cladogram constructed with the nucleotides sequences of identified functional species, clones and closely related nucleotide sequences from the Genbank indicated that nucleotide sequences differed in terms of the method used. The activity and establishment of the introduced AM fungal population was determined by spore enumeration, infectivity assay, percentage root colonisation and assessment of glomalin concentrations. The results indicated that the two land use types affected AM fungal populations. However, the establishment of AM fungi in the farming site was more successful than in the mining site as indicated by the higher infectivity pontential. Selected host plants, which were collected around the mine area, were observed to be mainly colonised by AM fungi and these were identified as Pentzia incana, Elytropappus rhinocerotis, Euphorbia meloformis, Selago corymbosa, Albuca canadensis and Helichrysum rosum. These plant species were able to thrive under harsh environmental conditions, thereby indicating their potential use as rehabilitation host plants. Generally, {{the findings of this study}} has provided an insight into the interaction between arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and other soil microorganisms in two fields with differing land use management practices...|$|R
40|$|High {{levels of}} {{elements}} such as sodium (Na), potassium (K) and phosphorus (P) in iron ore minerals are known to reduce the quality and price of these minerals. South Africa, {{as one of the}} world largest exporter of iron ore, is affected by this problem. Both potassium (K) and phosphorus (P) are peculiar to South African iron ore. The present study has therefore focussed on developing an environmentally friendly biological method for lowering the levels of K and P in iron ore minerals. Short and long term experiments were set up to isolate, identify, screen and test potential bioleaching bacteria and fungi from different environmental samples. The study started by investigating the possible relationship that exists between weathering and bioleaching processes. The investigation was intended to provide relevant information on the natural role of microorganisms such as ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi in the mining environment. The experiments involved the use of both mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal Pinus patula seedlings for the weathering of iron ore minerals. Four types of ECM fungi were used, namely Pisolithus tinctorius (PT), Paxillus involutus (PI), Laccaria bicolor (LB) and Suillus tomentosus, (ST). From the results, ectomycorrhizal weathering can be said to be species-specific and significantly influenced by fungal type and particle size. In addition, it was also discovered that both mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal roots can participate in weathering processes. Further investigations of ECM fungi when not in symbiosis, were carried out to know how or if they can be potential candidates to mobilise K and P from iron ore minerals. The experimental set up involved in vitro pure cultures of four different ECM fungi, namely Pisolithus tinctorius (PT), Paxillus involutus (PI), Phialocephala fortini (PFR), and Suillus tomentosus (ST). In addition, the treatments involved the use of five different particle sizes of each ore type. The results obtained indicated the potential of the ECM fungi to mobilise P and K from the two iron ore types though at different levels. Factors such as ore type, particle size, organic acid production and attachment of the fungi to the iron ore were all found to influence the mobilisation of nutrients from these ores. Another experiment that addressed some of the limitations encountered with the use of pure cultures of ECM fungi was conducted. Isolated indigenous fungal pure cultures from the surfaces of iron ore minerals were screened for their abilities to solubilise minerals by lowering the levels of K and P. These isolates were identified molecularly as close relatives of three genera that included Penicillium, Alternaria (2 isolates) and Epicoccum for isolates FO, SFC 2 /KFC 1 and SFC 2 B respectively. The identified Penicillium sp. turned out to be the only phosphate <b>solubiliser</b> among these isolates. Direct bioleaching capability of the fungus was compared to that of its metabolite. At the end, the metabolite showed better K removal than the direct use of the fungi. Interpretation of these results indicates possible relationship between K and P removal, and the organic acids production by this fungus. Other factors such as particle size and mineral type were also found to significantly influence the leaching process. Additional experiment was conducted to investigate the indigeous bacteria and their potentials in reducing the K and P contents of iron ore minerals. A total of 23 bacterial strains that belong to Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Actinobateria were isolated from the iron ore minerals and identified with molecular methods. All the bacterial isolates were screened for their potential as mineral solubilisers. Only eight of the isolates were selected and used in shake flask experiments that contained both KGT and SK mineral types as their sources of K and P. The experiment showed that all the eight isolates have potentials to produce organic acids especially high levels of gluconic acid but lower quantities of acetic, citric and propanoic acid. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and fourier transform infrared (FITR) analyses also helped to uncover the role that biofilm and extracellular polymeric substances could play in mineral solubilisation. Finally, an investigation of a new method for reduction of K and P levels of iron ore minerals was carried out, focussing on the use of cheap resources as well as septic conditions. The study involved the use of fermented spoilt grape fruits (Vitis sp.) and the solution from the product utilised in shake-flask experiments. Treatments involved two types of iron ore minerals (KGT and SK) and two different particle sizes. The result suggests the significant effect of particle size, time and organic acids on the reduction of K and P from the iron ore minerals. The important part of this finding is the discovery of a cheap microbial energy source (spoilt grape) that can be further exploited for full biobeneficiation of iron ore minerals. Another advantage of this method is the fact that the experiment can be conducted under non–sterile conditions, making it a system that can be operated outdoor.
