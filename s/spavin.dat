25|$|Bone <b>spavin</b> is osteoarthritis, or {{the final}} phase of {{degenerative}} joint disease (DJD), in the lower three hock joints. It usually affects the two lowest joints of the hock (the tarsometatarsal and the distal intertarsal joints), with the third joint, the proximal intertarsal, being the least likely to develop bone <b>spavin.</b> This condition has various types: jack <b>spavin</b> when lesion on the tarsal and carpal bones is large, and high <b>spavin</b> when the pathology occurs higher in the joint than is typical. Conversely, occult <b>spavin</b> does not produce any significant exostoses on the small tarsals, whilst bog <b>spavin</b> and blood <b>spavin</b> do not involve bony changes.|$|E
25|$|Other joint medications, like {{hyaluronic acid}} and Adequan, may help {{alleviate}} the pain if the horse has mild bone <b>spavin.</b> However, {{they are less}} useful for treating moderate of severe cases. MSM may also help horses with moderate bone <b>spavin.</b>|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{conformational}} defects {{that contribute to}} bone <b>spavin.</b> Those that cause uneven loading of the hocks, such as sickle hocks and cow hocks, are especially noteworthy. Poor trimming or shoeing can also contribute to bone <b>spavin</b> in any horse, {{no matter what their}} conformation.|$|E

6000|$|Generally the almanac which {{presented}} {{the claims of}} a [...] "pectoral" [...] also had a [...] "salve" [...] that was [...] "sovereign for burns" [...] {{and some of them}} humanely took into account the ills of farm animals and presented a cure for bots or a liniment for <b>spavins.</b> I {{spent a great deal of}} time with these publications and to them a large part of my education is due.|$|R
5000|$|Horses with sickle-hocks {{are at an}} {{increased}} risk of developing thoroughpin, curb and bog or bone <b>spavins.</b> Very severe cases of sickle-hocks can result in permanent lameness and may require euthanization to prevent further pain. However, many horses with sickle-hock are not affected to this degree, and may live a life with uneven wearing hooves. Corrective shoeing can help the horse's balance and strength. Horses with sickle-hocks should be monitored closely for signs of lameness, and if possible a veterinarian should be consulted before extensive exercise.http://www.horsekeeping.com/horse_conformation/sickle_hock.htm ...|$|R
25|$|Proper shoeing is {{critical}} {{in the management of}} a horse with bone <b>spavin.</b> Shoes most helpful for these horses include shoes that assist in breakover (like a square or rolled toe, or shoes with wedge pads). Shoes with heel support may also help horses with bone <b>spavin,</b> such as egg bar shoes.|$|E
25|$|Scintigraphy (bone scan) {{can help}} to {{differentiate}} between suspensory origin desmitis and bone <b>spavin.</b>|$|E

6000|$|It is notorious that short-sight is inherited; and we {{have seen}} in the twelfth chapter from the {{statistical}} researches of M. Giraud-Teulon, that the habit of viewing near objects gives a tendency to short-sight. Veterinarians are unanimous that horses are affected with <b>spavins,</b> splints, ringbones, etc., from being shod and from travelling on hard roads, and they are almost equally unanimous that a tendency to these malformations is transmitted. Formerly horses were not shod in North Carolina, and it has been asserted that they did not then suffer from these diseases of the legs and feet. (24/27. Brickell 'Nat. Hist. of North Carolina' 1739 page 53.)] ...|$|R
60|$|I pitied {{the poor}} old fellow, who, {{if he had}} been a horse, would have been no more than {{fourteen}} hands high, and as he went puffing along, tugging and grunting as if I was a load of coal, I felt as if I couldn't stand it another minute, and I called out to him to stop. It did seem as if he would drop before he got me back to the hotel, and I bounced out in no time, and then I walked {{in front of him and}} turned around and looked at him. If it is possible for a human hack-horse to have <b>spavins</b> in two joints in each leg, that man had them; and he looked as if he couldn't remember what it was to have a good feed.|$|R

"'Let all {{men that}} be troubled of aches, <b>spavins,</b> rheums, boils, {{maladies}} of the spleen or humours of the blood, come forthwith to {{the sign of}} the Red Lantern in East Cheap. There shall they find one that hath a marvelous remedy for all such ailments, brought with great dangers and perils of the journey from a far distant land. This wonderous balm shall straightway make the sick to be well and the lame to walk. Rubbed on the eye it restoreth sight and applied to the ear it reviveth the hearing. 'Tis the sole invention of Doctor Gustavus Friedman, sometime of Gottingen and brought by him hitherwards out of the sheer pity of his heart for them that be afflicted, nor shall any other fee be asked for it save only such a light and tender charge as shall defray the cost of Doctor Friedman his coming and going.'" ...|$|R
25|$|It {{is best to}} {{decrease}} {{the intensity of the}} workload for a horse with bone <b>spavin.</b> However, even with careful management, bone <b>spavin</b> will progressively get worse, and the animal {{may not be able to}} continue at the level of competition it was first used for once the lameness is consistent. Many horses can still be successful in a less-strenuous career. Light exercise is better than no exercise at all, and a change of career may prolong the horse's useful life.|$|E
25|$|Initially, {{signs of}} bone <b>spavin</b> may include {{sporadic}} and vague hindlimb lameness. Some horses may become uncomfortable in one lead, or may demonstrate stiffness walking downhill.|$|E
25|$|Each case of bone <b>spavin</b> {{should be}} shod {{independently}} {{depending on the}} severity of the case and the horses needs, there is not a specific shoe to be applied.|$|E
6000|$|John Worlington Dodds {{had many}} of the gifts which lead a {{speculator}} to success. He was quick in observing, just in estimating, prompt and fearless in acting. But in finance {{there is always the}} element of luck, which, however one may eliminate it, still remains, like the blank at roulette, a constantly present handicap upon the operator. And so it was that Worlington Dodds had come to grief. On the best advices he had dabbled in the funds of a South American Republic in the days before South American Republics had been found out. The Republic defaulted, and Dodds lost his money. He had bulled the shares of a Scotch railway, and a four months' strike had hit him hard. He had helped to underwrite a coffee company {{in the hope that the}} public would come along upon the feed and gradually nibble away some of his holding, but the political sky had been clouded and the public had refused to invest. Everything which he had touched had gone wrong, and now, on the eve of his marriage, young, clear-headed, and energetic, he was actually a bankrupt had his creditors chosen to make him one. But the Stock Exchange is an indulgent body. [...] What is the case of one to-day may be that of another to-morrow, and everyone is interested in seeing that the stricken man is given time to rise again. So the burden of Worlington Dodds was lightened for him; many shoulders helped to bear it, and he was able to go for a little summer tour into Ireland, for the doctors had ordered him rest and change of air to restore his shaken nervous system. Thus it was that upon the 15th of July, 1870, he found himself at his breakfast in the fly-blown coffee-room of the [...] "George Hotel" [...] in the market square of Dunsloe. It is a dull and depressing coffee-room, and one which is usually empty, but on this particular day it was as crowded and noisy as that of any London hotel. Every table was occupied, and a thick smell of fried bacon and of fish hung in the air. Heavily booted men clattered in and out, spurs jingled, riding-crops were stacked in corners, and there was a general atmosphere of horse. The conversation, too, was of nothing else. From every side Worlington Dodds heard of yearlings, of windgalls, of roarers, of <b>spavins,</b> of cribsuckers, of a hundred other terms which were as unintelligible to him as his own Stock Exchange jargon would have been to the company. He asked the waiter for the reason of it all, and the waiter was an astonished man that there should be any man in this world who did not know it.|$|R
25|$|Tiludronic acid, a bisphosphonate, tradenames Tildren and Equidronate (UK) has {{demonstrated}} {{to be beneficial}} {{in the treatment of}} bone <b>spavin.</b> It is administered by slow infusion (30 mn) mixed with saline.|$|E
25|$|Bone <b>spavin</b> is a bony growth {{within the}} lower hock joint of horse or cattle. It {{is caused by}} osteoarthritis, {{and the degree of}} {{lameness}} that results can be serious enough to end a horse's competitive career.|$|E
25|$|Bony {{changes of}} the lower hock joint are irreversible. It is possible, however, to manage the problem and thereby slow the {{progression}} of the bone <b>spavin,</b> ease the pain, and control the lameness. Surgery is an option for horses that {{do not respond to}} conventional treatments.|$|E
25|$|It is {{best for}} a horse with bone <b>spavin</b> to be {{exercised}} daily. Preferably, this should be ridden or driven work, as round pen or longeing exercise places uneven stress on the joint. Pasture turnout may not be beneficial if the horse does not move much.|$|E
25|$|A flexion test of an {{affected}} limb often {{produces a}} temporary worsening of the lameness. Such {{a response to}} a flexion test would support the diagnosis of bone <b>spavin.</b> A flexion test involves holding the hock in forced flexion {{for a period of time}} before trotting the horse away immediately.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{types of}} {{activities}} may also contribute to uneven or repeated loading of the lower hock joints, and thus bone <b>spavin.</b> These include sports that require {{a great deal of}} hock flexion (dressage), stress (jumping), sudden stops or turns (western events, such as reining), or a great deal of concussion (Standardbred racing).|$|E

25|$|The {{principal}} item {{of equipment}} for a cavalryman was the horse {{and one of the}} reasons both North and South initially hesitated in forming mounted units was because of financial considerations; each cavalry regiment cost $300,000 for initial organization with annual upkeep expenses tallying over $100,000. Both cavalries originally required recruits or local communities to provide horses, a policy that lasted briefly in the North, while the South maintained it throughout the war even though Richmond leaders recognized its serious drawbacks. While Confederate troopers bore the monetary cost of keeping themselves mounted, Union cavalrymen rode quartermaster issued animals obtained though public contracts (although officers had to reimburse the cost of their mounts to the government). While open to fraud early in the war, once tightened regulations and stringent inspections were enforced, the contract system yielded an estimated 650,000 horses for Union armies during the war exclusive of an additional 75,000 confiscated in Confederate territory. Union army guidelines for cavalry horse selection mandated animals be at least 15 hands high, weighing minimally 950 pounds and aged between 4 and 10 years old, and be well-broken to bridle and saddle. Animals were to be dark colors and free from defects such as shallow breathing, deformed hooves, <b>spavin</b> or ringbone. Geldings were preferred for cavalry horses with the purchase of mares strictly prohibited outside absolute military emergency and stallions' volatility and aggressiveness made them generally unsuitable for service. In the Confederacy, limited horse numbers did not permit such selectivity in trying to keep their armies horsed. Cavalry horse prices varied throughout the war; in 1861 the maximum government price for cavalry horses was $119. However, relentless military demand caused prices to continually increase and by 1865 prices hovered near $190 per head. In the Confederacy horse prices rapidly spiraled upward due to animal scarcity and inflation costing over $3,000 by war's end. The daily feed ration for Union cavalry horses was ten pounds of hay and fourteen pounds of grain which were ample and fulfilled the animals' nutritional needs if of good quality, however, the vagaries of the army supply system did not always insure prescribed forage amounts were delivered where most needed. On both sides volunteer officers often proved notably lax in promoting strict animal welfare, a shortcoming exacerbated by the absence of a trained and organized veterinary corps which allowed serious maladies like strangles, grease heel, farcy, and glanders to spread among army stock. The U.S. Congress finally created the rank of veterinary sergeant in March 1863, but the meager pay and rank held no inducement for qualified candidates to join the army. Repeated calls to establish a professional military veterinary service failed, and widespread waste, suffering, and destruction among army horses resulted; not until 1916 was an official U.S. army veterinary corps founded.|$|E
2500|$|The {{prognosis}} for bone <b>spavin</b> varies, depending on several factors including: ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Juvenile spavin" [...] is the {{occurrence}} of bone <b>spavin</b> in horses less than 3 years old. It usually occurs before the animal has done much work. While osteochondrosis lesions are the likely cause in some cases, this condition can also occur secondary to the distortion of the cuboidal bones which can occur in premature or dysmature foals.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wo!" [...] roared Mr. <b>Spavin</b> to the postboy, and {{the horses}} stopped in their mad career, and the {{carriage}} pulled up some fifty yards before Pen. He presently heard his own name shouted, and beheld {{the upper half of}} the body of Mr. <b>Spavin</b> thrust out of the side-window of the vehicle, and beckoning Pen vehemently towards it.|$|E
60|$|This conduct I can understand, but I cannot excuse--Mr. <b>Spavin</b> may; and I {{leave the}} matter to be settled betwixt himself and Mr. Green.|$|E
60|$|Foker had {{not come}} home at all. Here was a disappointment!--Mr. <b>Spavin</b> could not say when his friend would return. Sometimes he stopped a day, {{sometimes}} a week. Of what college was Pen? Would he have anything? There was a very fair tap of ale. Mr. <b>Spavin</b> was enabled to know Pendennis's name, on the card which the latter took out and laid down (perhaps Pen in these days was rather proud of having a card)--and so the young men took leave.|$|E
60|$|I think I like to {{speculate}} on the young men best. Their play is opener. You know the cards in their hand, as it were. Take, for example, Messrs. <b>Spavin</b> and Cockspur.|$|E
60|$|In a turf transaction, either <b>Spavin</b> or Cockspur {{would try}} to get the better of his father, and, to gain a point in the odds, victimise his best friends. One day we shall hear of one or other levanting; an event at which, not being {{sporting}} men, we shall not break our hearts. See--Mr. <b>Spavin</b> is settling his toilette previous to departure; giving a curl in the glass to his side-wisps of hair. Look at him! It is only at the hulks, or among turf-men, that you ever see a face so mean, so knowing, and so gloomy.|$|E
6000|$|Must. He is {{the best}} piece of man's flesh in the market, not an eye-sore in his whole body. Feel his legs, master; neither splint, <b>spavin,</b> nor wind-gall. [...] [Claps him on the Shoulder.|$|E
6000|$|... "This ain't the way," [...] said Mr. <b>Spavin,</b> smiling. [...] "This is the Fenbury road. I say, Pen, don't take {{on because}} you are plucked. It's nothing when you are used to it. I've been plucked three times, old boy--and after the first time I didn't care. Glad it's over, though. You'll have better luck next time." ...|$|E
6000|$|In sooth, a half-bred Pegasus, and {{far gone}} [...] In <b>spavin,</b> curb, {{and half a}} hundred woes. And Byron's style is 'jolter-headed jargon;' [...] His verse is 'only bearable in prose.' So living poets write of those that are gone, [...] And o'er the Eagle thus the Bantam crows; And Swinburne ends where Verisopht began, By owning you 'a very clever man.' ...|$|E
60|$|Along this {{particular}} stretch of line no express had ever passed. All the trains--the few that there were--stopped {{at all the}} stations. Denis knew {{the names of those}} stations by heart. Bole, Tritton, <b>Spavin</b> Delawarr, Knipswich for Timpany, West Bowlby, and, finally, Camlet-on-the-Water. Camlet was where he always got out, leaving the train to creep indolently onward, goodness only knew whither, into the green heart of England.|$|E
6000|$|Pen stopped, hesitated--nodded {{his head}} fiercely, and pointed onwards, as if desirous that the postillion should proceed. He did not speak: but his countenance {{must have looked}} very desperate, for young <b>Spavin,</b> having stared at him with an {{expression}} of blank alarm, jumped out of the carriage presently, ran towards Pen holding out his hand, and grasping Pen's, said, [...] "I say--hullo, old boy, where are you going, and what's the row now?" ...|$|E
