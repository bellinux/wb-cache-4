50|$|Since all pumps require {{well-developed}} {{inlet flow}} {{to meet their}} potential, a pump may not perform or be as reliable as expected due to a faulty <b>suction</b> <b>piping</b> layout such as a close-coupled elbow on the inlet flange. When poorly developed flow enters the pump impeller, it strikes the vanes and is unable to follow the impeller passage. The liquid then separates from the vanes causing mechanical problems due to cavitation, vibration and performance problems due to turbulence and poor filling of the impeller. This results in premature seal, bearing and impeller failure, high maintenance costs, high power consumption, and less-than-specified head and/or flow.|$|E

40|$|Nuclear {{power plants}} {{rely on the}} Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) to cool down the reactor core {{in case of an}} accident. Occasionally, air is entrained into the <b>suction</b> <b>piping</b> of ECCS causing voids that {{decrease}} pumping efficiency, and consequently damage the pumps. In an attempt to minimize the amount of voids entering the suction side of the pump in ECCS, a Void Recirculation System (VRS) experiment was conducted for a proof of concept purpose. While many studies have been oriented in studying two-component flow behavior in ECCS, none of them propose a solution to minimize air entrainment. As a consequence, there are no simulation models that use computational fluid dynamics to address gas entrainment solutions in ECCS. The objectives of this thesis are to (1) simulate and investigate two-component air-water flow in a VRS that minimizes the amount of air in piping systems, using RELAP 5 /MOD 3 as the computational tool, and (2) to validate the numerical results with respect to experimental results and observations. A one-dimensional model of the VRS was built in RELAP 5, in which eight different scenarios (replicating those from the VRS experiment) were simulated for a period of 150 seconds. Four Froude numbers of 0. 8, 1. 0, 1. 3 and 1. 6 were evaluated in two different pipe configurations, and the experimental data obtained from the VRS experiment was used to validate the numerical results obtained from these simulations. It was concluded that air recirculation occurs indefinitely throughout the entire 150 seconds of the simulation for Froude numbers up to 1. 3; while for a Froude number of 1. 6, air recirculation occurs for approximately 100 seconds and ceases after 125 seconds of the simulation. An average air reduction effectiveness of 90 % was found for all simulation scenarios.

Troubleshooting: Whole entire factors were investigated from process condition change, piping layout, separating drum size and valve design. Very viscous and sticky heavy hydrocarbon called `Green Oil? was found at the valves & cylinder could cause valve late closing and consequential excessive impact stress during valve closing. Increased colder spill-back by-pass flow could cool down gas after separator drum made easy formation of heavy hydrocarbon condensate. Moreover liquid condensate could exist as slug at low point of <b>suction</b> manifold <b>piping</b> directly connected to compressor suction. Valve dynamics and pulsation after revamp was acceptable but plate type valve seemed to be not good choice under service including sticky liquid showing bouncing at edge of plate during late closing. Solution implementation and Result: Low point drain of compressor <b>suction</b> manifold <b>piping</b> was added for liquid removal and spill-back flow was reduced by running compressors at partial load to reduce condensation by colder by-pass flow. Valve type was changed to poppet type which is known as relatively better for very viscous and sticky liquid service. Detail study and investigation on suction separator showed nothing bad. After all improvement implementation valve life increased to over 1 year.

Indeed, the upward pore water flow {{on the inner side}} of the caisson wall causes a release of a fraction of soil resistance due to the reduction of the lateral effective stress. A safe caisson installation requires a reliable prediction of soil conditions, especially soil resistance and critical <b>suction</b> for <b>piping.</b> These soil conditions must be predicted for the whole installation process. In this paper, we examine the effect on such prediction of the assumed permeability profile, which is described as a function of depth below the mudline. This study is motivated by the fact that marine sediments generally exhibit a permeability that decreases with depth because of consolidation under gravity. Hence, the question is whether conventional theories based on a constant permeability lead to a conservative prediction of soil conditions or not. Our conclusion is affirmative only regarding piping condition. As for soil resistance, a prediction based on the assumption of a constant permeability is non-conservative. This is due to an overestimated reduction in effective stresses under suction-induced seepage...|$|R

40|$|The {{possible}} {{failure of}} an Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) train {{due to a}} large amount of entrained gas in the ECCS pump <b>suction</b> <b>piping</b> in a Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA) is one of the potential engineering problems faced in a Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) power plant. To analyze potential gas intrusion into the ECCS pump <b>suction</b> <b>piping,</b> the study of void behavior in the Suppression Pool (SP) during the LOCA is necessary. The void fraction distribution and void penetration are considered as the key parameters in the problem analysis. Two sets of experiments, namely, steady-state tests and transient tests were conducted using the Purdue University Multi-Dimensional Integral Test Assembly for ESBWR application (PUMA-E) to study void behavior in the SP during the blowdown. The design of the test apparatus used is based on the scaling analysis from a prototypical BWR containment (MARK-I) with consideration of the downcomer size, the SP water level, and the downcomer water submergence depth. Several instruments were installed to obtain the required experimental data, such as inlet gas volumetric flow, void fraction, pressure, and temperature. ^ For the steady-state tests, the air was injected through a downcomer pipe in the SP in order to simulate the physical phenomena in the SP during the initial blowdown of LOCA. Thirty tests were performed with two different downcomer sizes (0. 076 and 0. 102 m), various air volumetric flow rates or flux (0. 003 to 0. 153 m 3 /s or 0. 5 to 24. 7 m/s), initial downcomer void conditions (fully filled with water, partially void, and completely void) and air velocity ramp rates (one to two seconds). Two phases of the experiment were observed, namely, the initial phase and the quasi-steady phase. The initial phase produced the maximum void penetration depth; and the quasi-steady phase showed less void penetration with oscillation in the void penetration. The air volumetric flow rate was found to have a minor effect on the void fraction distribution and void penetration during the initial phase, which was in the range of high air volumetric flow rate conditions; however, it strongly impacted the void fraction distribution and void penetration during the quasi-steady phase for the entire ranges of air volumetric flow rate conditions. The initial downcomer void conditions were found to strongly affect the void fraction distribution and void penetration during the initial phase. The air velocity ramp rates were found to have a minor impact on void distribution and penetration in both phases. The downcomer cross-sectional areas did not significantly impact the average void penetration (both axial and radial) for those tests having comparable initial air volumetric flux. ^ For the transient tests, sequential flows of air, steam-air mixtures, and pure steam, with the various flow rate conditions, were injected from the Drywell (DW) through a downcomer pipe in the SP. Eight tests were conducted with two different downcomer sizes (0. 076 and 0. 102 m), various gas volumetric flux levels (17 to 84 m/s) at the downcomer, and two different initial air concentration conditions in the DW (80 % and 100 % of air concentration). Three phases of experiments, (i. e., initial phase, quasi-steady phase, and chugging phase) were observed. The void penetration depth was at the maximum level in the initial phase and at a reduced level in the quasi-steady phase. The chugging that occurred {{at the tail end of}} the experiment provided renewed void penetrations that were comparable to those in the initial phase. It was determined that the void fraction distribution and the void penetration in the SP were governed by the gas volumetric flux at the downcomer and by the air concentration in the downcomer. The downcomer cross-sectional areas did not significantly impact the average void penetration (both axial and radial) for those tests having comparable initial gas volumetric flux. ...|$|E

Among the 22 initiating events that were surveyed in this study, four direct initiators have been selected and analyzed briefly. Those selected were a pump <b>suction</b> <b>piping</b> break, an isolation valve piping break, a bleed valve failure, and a fueling machine interface failure. These were selected as examples of failures that could {{take place in the}} inlet side, outlet side, or PHTS (Primary Heat Transport System) interfaces. The Pickering NGS (Unit-A) was used for this case study;A postulated mechanical failure of the fueling machine during the fueling process was studied in detail, considering the effect of the location of the pressure tube under fueling. At certain levels of a small-size LOCA that may be caused by failure of the fueling machine, the ECCS (Emergency Core Cooling System) injection may be needed to cool down the core. The availability of the ECCS as a long term safety backup system following the LOCA occurrence, was analyzed;Fault Tree Analysis methodology was used to assess the occurrence probability of the fueling machine failure, and also the unavailability of the ECCS. The PREP and KITT computer codes were used to estimate the failure probabilities. From these computations, the failure probability of the fueling machine interface is estimated as 1. 08 x 10 (2 ̆ 7 - 5), and the unavailability of the ECCS is 3. 63 x 10 (2 ̆ 7 - 3);The entire system interaction following the fueling machine failure was examined.

40|$|Suction {{installation}} of caisson foundations is widely {{adopted in the}} oil offshore industry. When such foundations are installed in sand, seepage conditions are known to play {{a pivotal role in}} the installation process. Pressure gradients generated by the imposed suction inside the caisson cavity cause an overall reduction in the lateral soil pressure acting on the caisson wall {{as well as in the}} tip resistance. This transient loosening of soil around the caisson wall facilitates caisson penetration into the seabed. However, these effects must be controlled to avoid soil failure due to critical conditions such as piping or loss of soil shear strength, which may cause the installation procedure to fail due to instability of the soil plug trapped inside the caisson cavity. In this paper, we endeavour to study these effects based on the analysis of the normalised seepage problem, assuming the installation process to take place in homogeneous sand. We first investigate the effects of seepage conditions on soil resistance to caisson penetration with a particular focus on how frictional resistance and tip resistance are differently affected. We then consider modes of failure due to soil piping inside the caisson cavity and sliding of soil mass in a failure mechanism where the soil plug inside the caisson cavity is pushed upward. Based on this study, some insight is gained into the critical conditions for piping. These conditions evolve during the installation process as the penetration depth increases under an increasing suction. Upper and lower bounds are also estimated for the critical suction based on an assumed mode of failure using a simple mechanism of rigid blocks. By comparing these modes of failure we conclude that piping is not always the most critical condition. The critical mode of failure for a given soil may change during the installation process and this is highlighted by comparing the critical <b>suction</b> for <b>piping</b> to the <b>suction</b> upper and lower bounds related to shear failure...|$|R

A new slurry product initially developed at lab scale was introduced into the production plant for an initial trial run. Problems began to surface immediately on three out of five batch process pumping systems when the slurry could not be pumped through the plant at contract rate. Additionally, significant "heels" (unwanted fluid levels) were left {{in some of the}} suction vessels that were unable to be pumped out, resulting in considerable yield losses. This manufacturing problem had not been anticipated by the team, and without quick resolution, a loss of customer confidence and a significant delay in the new product would have resulted. Investigation and analysis of the system revealed two major problem areas in pumping non-settling slurries in laminar regimes: 1. Initial prediction of head losses through <b>suction</b> <b>piping</b> fittings was flawed using traditional hydraulic loss methods. The original calculations for NPSHA values for the pumps predicted adequate NPSH margin. The fluid was non-Newtonian and was operating in the laminar regime. Upon further investigation, a weakness was revealed in predictions of fitting losses for laminar flow through the pipe fittings. An improved model for predicting losses through pipe fittings was identified and implemented. The improved model matched operational data much better and provided the critical insight needed to resolve the operational problems and get the facility operating. 2. Piping arrangements that allow for features such as clean-out ports (e. g., branch flow tees) can be counterproductive to unrestricted flow of the process liquid in systems with non-settling slurries operating in laminar regimes. Tees, elbows, diameter changes, and other fittings can introduce significant head losses in the pumping system. The authors present an improved method for analyzing fitting losses in pumping systems when dealing with nonsettling slurries operating in the laminar regime. In addition, design considerations are presented to minimize the impact that piping has on the pumping system when handling non-settling slurries operating in the laminar regime...|$|E

Hydraulic institute, among others, specifies a measurement of procedure for NPSHR, which is at the point that a reciprocating pump loses 3. 0 percent in volumetric efficiency relative to a stable efficiency at a high suction head. Although noise, vibration, or any sign of mechanical damage would be an indication of reaching the NPSHR limit on test, they may not be easily observed during a short term factory performance test. Also, the difference in the test system and the field installation can result in an improper correlation with the current methods for predicting suction performance. In order to better predict successful field operation, a number of additional factors need to be considered, such as: *The influence of piping system attached to the pump. *The need to avoid cavitation damage inside the pump. *The need to operate reliably, with attention to proper valve dynamics. *Changes in fluid properties between test and the installation. *An additional term is defined (NPSHF), which is intended to better predict suction performance in the field.

During testing, a surge phenomenon was observed at a flow rate 15 % higher than the predicted surge flow. From the FFT results of the shaft vibration and the pressure pulsation at the discharge of the compressor, the peaks of sub-synchronous components were observed at two frequencies of 2 Hz and 30 Hz near surge flow. The sub-synchronous vibration at 30 Hz {{was considered to be}} caused by rotating stall, but the 2 Hz was too low to be attributable to rotating stall. As an assumption of the root cause, the acoustic characteristics of shop test loop were checked. The calculated and measured Helmholtz resonance frequency of the shop test loop was in agreement with the sub-synchronous frequency of 2 Hz. For further investigation, additional tests were carried out with a fully instrumented test loop.

In case the compressor discharge is the node of pressure pulsation, it becomes the anti-node of flow fluctuation.

The pump <b>suction</b> and discharge <b>piping</b> system {{is a part of}} chemical plant for processing hydrocarbon mixture at 270 ° C. Elevated temperature is one of static loads that influences the boundary conditions of the piping structure thus generating pump nozzle loadings leading to possible pump body deflection. Deflected shape of the pump body results in generation of flow fluctuation, visible and measurable as a pressure pulsation. This kind of fluctutation has been assumed further {{to be one of the}} dynamic loading on piping system structure. The dynamic analysis was performed to quantify the loading effect of pressure pulsation excited in the pump discharge nozzles on the structure of pipelines and the connected pump nozzles.

In the simulation elastic features of the piping structure as well as the fluid, and pressure loses in pipes, taken into account.

40|$|TutorialTutorial 10 A: Centrifugal {{compressors}} {{are subject}} to transient events, such as emergency shutdowns, which can cause energetic surge events during rapid shutdown transients. Many modeling tools are used to predict the behavior of compressor systems during fast transient events. Even more, centrifugal compressor dynamic modeling is a valuable assessment tool that can help improve {{the design of the}} compressor anti-surge system to prevent harsh conditions while the unit is coasting down. Modeling of centrifugal compressor transient events requires a detailed evaluation of many system variables to obtain accurate results. Additionally, many parameters should be included and analyzed to adjust the model and obtain acceptable predictions. Those parameters can include recycle valve characteristics, the controller and actuator, <b>suction</b> and discharge <b>piping</b> volumes, aftercoolers, and operating conditions. Other parameters, such as machine coast down speed and inertia and different control response times will determine if the compressor will reach its surge limit at a detrimental high head condition, avoid it or go through it at low acceptable energy conditions. Many designs use general guidelines to select and plan the compressor anti-surge system and its main components. For example, the recycle valve type, size and actuation time are key parameters during the shutdown of the compressor unit since they directly affect the amount of flow through the compressor and its reaction time. Other factors are also relevant and should be assessed in detail to assure a proper design to avoid such transient events as a sudden shutdown of a compressor from a full load or high head operating conditions resulting in damaging surge events. In order to refine the simulation approach of the transients in centrifugal compressors, an extensive assessment has been conducted of the main parameters that will affect the modeling predictions. Parameters such as recycle valve size, type, actuation time, after-cooler volume, friction factors, unit speed coast down predictions, compressor map, isolation valve control, acting time, as well as placement of the discharge check valve influence the modeling predictions considerably. Therefore, parametric studies of some of those variables have helped to refine and adjust the modeling technique while improving the accuracy of the results. Moreover, computational predictions have been compared against high fidelity ? high accuracy data collected in a full scale compressor system. Initial comparisons indicated reasonable results while adjustments in the technique and main assumptions improved the modeling predictions considerably. A generic methodology to improve modeling predictions and main considerations are part of the analysis. In addition, a comparison of the modeling results and experimental data are presented and complemented with parametric studies of different variables. In general, this work should provide guidelines for advancing the modeling of centrifugal compressor transients as well as showing the application of a valuable tool for designing surge control systems for centrifugal compressors...|$|R
