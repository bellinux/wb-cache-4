"Shaft smoothers" [...] {{were shaped}} stones {{which could be}} {{distinguished}} by abraded grooves occurring on one or more surfaces. 2 complete specimens were analyzed, both made of a pumice material, one was rectangular while the other was subrectangular with rounded edges. On the broadest edge of the second stone, there was a main groove that ran {{the full length of}} the edge. 5 specimens classified as [...] "grooved stone" [...] were found, one complete specimen and four fragments. The complete stone had an irregular shape of a pumice material with three shallow grooves. 8 nearly complete specimens and 262 fragments were classified as [...] "milling stones". These specimens were further divided into two categories: block and <b>slab</b> <b>milling</b> stones. One of the two nearly complete block milling stones, made of a quartzite material, was oval in shape with a circular depression, while the other block milling stone had no depression and had a rectangular shape. The six nearly complete <b>slab</b> <b>milling</b> stones were made of mainly mica schist, schist, conglomerate, gneiss, and sandstone. Traces of red and black pigments could be found on the sides and center of two nearly complete sab milling stones respectively.|$|E

The critical frequencies in relation to influence on surface generation and surface roughness can be determined. In this way a defined procedure is made available for a direct analysis of the mechanisms of surface generation in specific applications. This provides a basis for machine tool optimisation. The above results have already been confirmed. One further objective could be to extend these results to models for other machining processes...|$|E
40|$|In {{addition}} {{to the prediction of}} whether a milling process is free of chatter or not, the resulting surface quality is of importance. This paper presents geometric models of the machined workpiece in order to predict the surface microstructures of the peripherally milled flank structures as well as the surface resulting from the <b>slab</b> <b>milling</b> process with end-mills. After a brief explanation of the time domain simulation system used to calculate the tool vibration patterns, a surface model is presented which is able to predict the roughness depending on the spindle speed. Results show that the best surface quality is achieved by milling with spindle speeds which are slightly lower than at the stability maxima.

25|$|A slab is {{a length}} of metal that is {{rectangular}} in cross-section. It is created directly by continuous casting or indirectly by rolling an ingot on a <b>slabbing</b> <b>mill.</b> <b>Slabs</b> are usually further processed via flat rolling, skelping, and pipe rolling. Common final products include sheet metal, plates, strip metal, pipes, and tubes.|$|R

5000|$|VÖEST assets {{became the}} {{principal}} Austrian {{recipient of the}} Marshall Plan aid but access to American cash came only after a protracted political battle within Austrian establishment. Geoffrey Keyes had to recruit steel expert William E. Brewster to sort through the Austrian proposals. Brewster supported the Austrian four-year plan but its key opponent Franz Nemchak called it [...] "a colossal stupidity" [...] and demanded a halt on VÖEST program. The controversy spilled into the U. S. Senate, causing delays in Marshall Plan financing for VÖEST. VÖEST received its new <b>slabbing</b> <b>mill</b> but the new hot strip mill was delayed by the opposition of the Pentagon, which feared that VÖEST product would be sold to the Soviet bloc. The Pentagon removed their objections in January 1952, conforming to the consensus of other U. S. agencies. The hot and cold strip mills were, at last, put into operation in 1953. By the end of 1953 {{the first phase of}} reconstruction was complete.|$|R
5000|$|The home plant of YS&T {{was known}} as the Campbell Works located in Campbell and Struthers, Ohio. This plant {{contained}} four blast furnaces, twelve open hearth furnaces, several blooming mills, two Bessemer converters, a <b>slabbing</b> <b>mill,</b> a butt-weld tube mill, a 79" [...] hot strip mill, seamless tube mills, and 9" [...] and 12" [...] bar mills at the Struthers Works. The Brier Hill Works consisted of two blast furnaces named Grace and Jeannette, twelve open hearth furnaces, a 40" [...] blooming mill, a 35" [...] intermediate blooming mill, a 24" [...] round mill, 84" [...] and 132" [...] plate mills, and an electric-weld tube mill. During much of the Depression, the Brier Hill works was shut down, but it reopened in 1937. Much of the reopened plant's production comprised tube rounds for the Campbell seamless tube mills. Due to the imbalance of ironmaking and steelmaking facilities at the two plants, rail shipments of molten iron [...] "hot metal" [...] were made from Campbell to Brier Hill from 1937 until 1979.|$|R

Changes and modernisation at Scunthorpe were planned under several phases for Scunthorpe, under a scheme known as the [...] "Anchor Project", which had its basis in an £80 million proposal made by the Appleby-Frodingham company in 1966 to the regulating Iron and Steel Board for LD converter conversion with a capacity of around 2 million tons pa, plus a 2 million ton pa <b>slab</b> <b>mill</b> and investment increasing light plate production to 1 million tons pa; foreign ore would {{also be used to}} increase productivity. When accepted by BSC in 1969 the expanded project had a cost of £130 million (rising to £230 million by 1971), and included three 300 ton LD converters, as well as a continuous plate mill later rejected, and other improvements. During the formulation of the plan the option of relocating the Scunthorpe-based steel production to a coastal site (i.e. Port of Immingham) had been considered but rejected. Work on the 1000 acre former ore field site south and east of the older works began in early 1970. The new Anchor works including steelmaking, continuous casting and rolling mills was officially opened in 1974 by Queen Elizabeth II.|$|R

40|$|The Steel <b>Mill</b> <b>Slab</b> Problem is an {{optimization}} benchmark {{that has}} been studied {{for a long time}} in the constraint-programming community but was only solved eciently in the two last years. Gargani and Refalo solved the problem using Large Neighborhood Search and Van Hentenryck and Michel made use of constraint programming with an improved symmetry breaking scheme. In the rst part of this paper, we build on those approaches, present improvements of those two techniques, and study how the problem can be tackled by Constraint-Based Local Search. As a result, the classical instances of CSPLib can now be solved in less than 50 ms. To improve our understanding of this problem, we also introduce a new set of harder instances, which highlight the strengths and the weaknesses of the various approaches. In a second part of the paper, we present a variation of the Steel <b>Mill</b> <b>Slab</b> Problem whose aim is to minimize the number of slabs. We show how this problem can be tackled with slight modications of our proposed algorithms.

Contrary to earlier approaches, their model does not use 0 / 1 variables but exploits the traditional expressiveness of constraint programming. G&R indicated that static symmetry-breaking constraints proposed earlier are not effective on this model, as these interact with their heuristic. Instead they use large neighborhood search to obtain solutions quickly. This paper shows that a simple search procedure breaking symmetries dynamically leads to a constraint program solving the problem in a few seconds, while maintaining the completeness of the approach and removing the need for large neighborhood search. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} an industrial steel <b>mill</b> <b>slab</b> design problem. This problem is {{an instance of}} a class of difficult problems where the problem structure (in this case, the number and size of slabs) is not fixed initially, but determined {{as part of the}} solution process. Since a natural CSP encoding does not immediately suggest itself, the choice of model for this type of problem may be crucial in successfully solving it. This paper develops three different models to tackle the slab design problem. Model A uses a conservatively large number of variables to represent the slabs, some of which will typically be redundant in an optimal solution. Model B operates in two phases, first solving an abstraction of the original problem before solving further sub-problems to provide a solution to the original problem. The third model is a dual model combining models A and B, allowing search and propagation on both sets of variables...|$|R
