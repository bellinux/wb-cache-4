The IMF sometimes advocates [...] "austerity programmes", cutting public spending and increasing taxes even when the economy is weak, to bring budgets closer to a balance, thus reducing budget deficits. Countries are often advised to lower their corporate tax rate. In Globalization and Its Discontents, Joseph E. Stiglitz, former chief economist and senior vice-president at the World Bank, criticises these policies. He argues that by converting to a more monetarist approach, the purpose of the fund is no longer valid, as it was designed to provide funds for countries to carry out Keynesian reflations, and that the IMF [...] "was not participating in a conspiracy, but it was reflecting the interests and ideology of the Western financial community".|$|E

40|$|Nigeria {{adopted and}} {{implemented}} four fixed medium-term national development plans between 1960 and 1985 {{with a view}} to ultimately achieving optimum societal wellbeing. However, due to the economic problems of the 1980 s, an extensive <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>program</b> (SAP) was put in place in 1986. Among other things, SAP was meant to restructure and diversify the Nigerian economy. This paper empirically analyzes the impact of the four plans and the <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>program</b> on aggregate economic activity in Nigeria. The study employs a growth equation that contains major macroeconomic variables such as credit to private sector, foreign direct investment and foreign trade as well as dummy variables that capture eras of the four fixed medium-term national development plans and the <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>program.</b> Contemporary econometric techniques of co integration and autoregressive modeling form part of the methodology for this study. The study is based on annual time series data from 1960 to 2009 obtained from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). The estimates of the study, among other things, reveal that the fixed medium-term national development plans in general had no significant impact on aggregate economic activity in Nigeria whereas the <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>program</b> had some significant positive impact on aggregate economic activity in the country. Thus there is need for optimum state planning in the country, especially if the planning is for fixed medium-term. In general, there is need for optimal management of the country’s economy...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} {{interactions}} between foreign development aid, economic reform, and public sector fiscal behavior. It proposes {{a model of}} the public sector fiscal response to aid inflows, which allows for changes in structural relationships due to an exogenously imposed program of economic reform. This model is applied to 1960 - 99 time series data for the Philippines, which embarked on an IMF- and World Bank-funded <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>program</b> in 1980. Estimates of structural and reduced-form equations paint a dismal picture of the effectiveness of foreign aid to, and the <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>program</b> in, the Philippines so far as fiscal impacts are concerned. Both bilateral and multilateral aid inflows, and the presence of an economic reform program, are associated with decreases in public fixed capital expenditure, decreases in taxation and other recurrent revenue, and decreases in public sector saving. Multilateral aid also appears to be highly fungible. Copyright 2009 UNU-WIDER. Journal compilation 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. ...|$|R

This {{study is}} a litmus test to the present Nigerian Government <b>Structural</b> <b>Adjustment</b> <b>Program</b> of 1986 - 88 {SAP} which lays much emphasis on the non-oil sector of the economy.

Thereby encouraging the production and the welfare of the rural populace. Despite the fact that one of the objectives of the <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>program</b> was to encourage farming and marketing by providing necessary incentives to the farmers. It is surprising that rural, small-landholding have scant or no contact with mainstream rural development finance. However, large sums of money at low rates of interest have flowed to some rural elites. This includes some medium and large farmers under various agricultural development projects. But very little or nothing has gone to the small farmers. Thus, the ultimate objective which a <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>program</b> sought, is creating a new economic order to ensure a better future for all Nigerians. The fact is that the past and present administration in Nigeria has been running an interdependent economic structure based on oil {monoproduct}, greed, and unregulated market forces and failure. The circulation of the national resources has been interrupted by short-term national and group selfishness. As such we cannot continue to survive if {{the vast majority of the}} masses are denied a fair share in the marketing of their product. " This is our crisis and our opportunity.
