5|$|The Court of Appeal {{held that}} the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> review of the {{discretion}} conferred by sections 8 and 10 of the ISA {{is limited to the}} traditional administrative law grounds of illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety as established in the House of Lords decision Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service (1984), also known as the GCHQ case. The Court noted that the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> judicial review depends on whether a jurisdictional or precedent fact is involved. Where no jurisdictional fact is involved, the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> review is limited to the GCHQ grounds. Where a jurisdictional fact issue arises, the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> review extends to deciding whether the precedent fact has been established. Whether a particular discretionary power is subject to any jurisdictional fact depends on the construction of the legislation which creates that power.|$|E

5|$|In {{the case}} of Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988), the Court of Appeal {{expanded}} the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> judicial review by adopting an objective test when reviewing the exercise of executive discretion. In contrast to the subjective test, the objective test permits the court to examine whether the decision-maker's satisfaction was based on objective facts which fell within the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> the purposes specified by the ISA. The subjective satisfaction or mere ipse dixit of the executive body is insufficient. However, the adoption of this objective test {{was only part of}} the obiter dicta of the case. The ratio decidendi of the case was based on narrower technical grounds.|$|E
