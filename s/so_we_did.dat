500|$|In {{spite of}} this, {{there are no}} CG cars {{incorporated}} in the actual film.

Lifecasts of the actors were also used for all of the death scenes, including the highway setting. Landes experienced claustrophobia during the procedure. Fake blood was also used, but CG blood was also shown.|$|E

We wanted to find a solution to a plot problem. And we still had Leonard Nimoy’s presence there, even though he [...] was dead. So they came up with the bizarre idea of putting his presence into Anna Torv, which is outrageous. Outrageous, and yet we did it, and {{had a lot of fun}} doing it. Then we had to get him out of it.

500|$|Manson {{stated that}} {{eliminating}} the corporate pressure and indifference, {{as well as}} the band having a relaxed approach to the making of the record was pivotal for a healthy regroup, writing and recording process. [...] "We didn't put any pressure on ourselves to finish an album... We just took our time and got together in two-week blocks of time - any longer than that I'm sure we would have started getting on each others' nerves. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> two weeks and then we'd take some time off and then when everybody felt ready we'd get back in [...] again. As a result, I think everybody really enjoyed our time together and really plugged in", she remarked. Never much enjoying being in a studio, Manson relished the record-making process this time around.|$|E
500|$|Although Beck {{had been}} {{impressed}} with the Chess studio's history and sound, he {{had been unable to}} complete a guitar solo to his satisfaction. [...] "I kept changing guitar sounds all the way through. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> two or three takes of my guitars and blended them all together. But the solo on [...] "Shapes of Things" [...] was pretty honest up until that feedback note that comes in over it", he recalled. [...] During the recording, [...] "there was mass hysteria in the studio when I did that solo. [...] They weren't expecting it and it was just some weird mist coming from the East out of an amp. [...] Giorgio was freaking out and dancing about like some tribal witch doctor". [...] Beck played the solo on one string(G), using a 1954 Fender Esquire guitar he had purchased before the tour. Relf also benefitted from multi-tracking—two vocal tracks were recorded, allowing him to harmonise the vocal line.|$|E

500|$|The new {{script was}} then pitched to the BBC. The pitch tape they made {{was based on}} the same pitch used by The Muppet Show. This was done as a tribute to it, with Miller arguing that when The Muppet Show did it, [...] "it just must have just knocked the socks off the people who saw it, because it's like nothing you've ever seen before, and we thought: 'Why fix what ain't broke, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> our own very British version of that." [...] The {{producers}} liked it but did not fully understand what the show was about. Miller, Brown and a third writer, Daniel Peak began to write scripts over a period of four years. A pilot was eventually filmed and the BBC commissioned a full series, targeted at adults. Despite the adult nature, Miller did not want to make the show too crude. Eight episodes were filmed so as to spread the cost of making the series over each episode.|$|E
500|$|The {{songs of}} the album are noted for their {{changing}} dynamics – with [...] "middle sections [...] turn into this mass orchestrated swarm and ridiculous time signatures" [...] which include musical references to 1970s soft rock bands such as Wings, Eagles and Bread - summed by Hawkins by saying the band [...] "wanted {{to make sure that}} everything 'built' on this record, that each instrument started somewhere and went somewhere else {{in the course of a}} song". The drummer attributed this to the acoustic tour leading the band to [...] "shed some of the fear of incorporating mellower stuff with the heavy stuff", and Grohl added that [...] "we wanted the stops to be pin-drop silent before exploding. If we had a beautiful melody, we'd throw a fucking string quartet in there. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> everything we could to really magnify all those elements and that was fun.

[...] "We were interested in making music that would be more integral in the movie, just as a mental exercise," [...] Butler, who co-wrote the song with Chassagne, explained. [...] "And there’s an anthem that runs throughout the books, the national anthem of the fascist Capitol. So as a thought experiment, we tried to write what that might sound like. It’s like the Capitol’s idea of itself, basically." [...] He further added that [...] "it's not a pop song or anything. More of an anthem that could be playing at a big sporting event like the [...] Games. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> a structure for that, and then James Newton Howard made a movie-score version of it that happens in several places in the film." [...] Arcade Fire's Panem national anthem has received strong reviews. According to Spin Mobile, [...] "'Horn of Plenty' sounds both exactly like Arcade Fire and exactly like a futuristic anthem." ...|$|E

He elaborated, [...] "But here we are actually burying the man ... just pushing something as far as you possibly can because the audience can't quite believe you're doing it." [...] The funeral was expensive to film; several actors, such as Sheila Larken, who played Scully's mother, needed to be flown in specifically for the scene. Spotnitz later said, [...] "It's a lot of money to spend but, you know, you just couldn't really do Mulder's funeral without having them there, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> all that." [...] Despite the fact that the show was filmed in California and under [...] "huge financial pressure", real snow was used for foreground shots and the background was painted white in post-production. Spotnitz later called the sequence [...] "a fun scene to write and stage" [...] and [...] "a great tease".|$|E

She told him the basic story she had planned, which he described as a [...] "fairy-tale, sweet, knight-in-shining-armor feel to it. I said let's take that and make the fairy tale badass." [...] Spears also wanted her real-life boyfriend Jason Trawick to play the criminal. Marrs Piliero was initially hesitant to cast Trawick feeling that a professional actor would do a better job, but did not talk to Spears about it. He told USA Today, [...] "When you're doing nudity, I don't think {{it was at the}} top of Britney's list to bring in some random guy while her boyfriend watches. [...] We definitely wanted to make some passionate, steamy scenes, but we also wanted it to be intensely beautiful. We didn't want to go for raunchy. We wanted it to be sensual and steamy." [...] On September 6, 2011, Spears announced through her Twitter account {{that she had}} decided to shoot the video [...] "in the streets of merry old England when I get there." [...] In an interview with AOL, she explained, [...] "I've never shot on location out of the country of America for a video. So, it should be very interesting.

[...] Following the home video, Draper had the idea of making a mockumentary film about the band; she decided to introduce them as music icons like The Beatles. Filmed in mid-2004, the movie was originally independent, and Draper's brother, Tim, a venture capitalist, provided financial incentives for the shoot. In addition, Draper and Wolff's famous celebrity friendssuch as Uma Thurman, Julianne Moore, Cyndi Lauper, Tony Shalhoub, Arsenio Hall, and the ensemble cast from the ABC television drama Thirtysomething (the latter including Draper herself)are featured making cameo appearances.|$|E

And I just remember thinking, 'Oh, it'd be great to do one. Pity they've done it. Must be great – really screaming record.' And then I heard their record and it was quite straight, and it was very sort of sophisticated. It wasn't rough and screaming and tape echo at all. So I thought, 'Oh well, we'll do one like that, then.' And I had this song called 'Helter Skelter,' which is just a ridiculous song. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> it like that, 'cuz I like noise." ...|$|E

[...] Simulating the CG liquid, which was meant to be an ambiguous reference to poison and blood that behaved like [...] "something in between liquid chocolate and tar", was difficult, with Clair saying [...] "It's hard to make an algorithm act [...] "insidious"". CG Lead Andrew Romatz elaborated that [...] "Developing the right consistency and behavior of the fluids was definitely a tricky process. Getting the scale to feel right was something that we had to play with quite a bit in simulation and also in lighting and texturing. Patrick wanted the sculptures we were forming to feel like miniatures, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> a lot of experimenting with scene scale and with camera settings, simulating depth of field to achieve that look." [...] Fluids Lead Miguel A. Salek stated that [...] "Each shot required custom flow maps to be painted on the sculptures, along with small attraction fields and thousands of tiny adjustments to achieve the shapes and behavior Patrick was looking for. In the end I simulated hundreds of tests and thousands of frames of fluids to achieve just the right balance for each shot." [...] Due to time constraints, references to Murdock's boxing history such as a punching bag and boxing ring were cut from the final sequence. The final sequence was animated to a temp track—"an old piece of 90s trip hop"—before John Paesano's music for the sequence was completed.|$|E
