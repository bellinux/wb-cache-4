5|$|A few {{accounts}} {{exist that}} describe females defending their newborn litters. Wharten (1960, 1966) reported several cases where females found near their young stood their ground and considered these to be examples of guarding behavior. Another case {{was described by}} Walters and Card (1996) in which a female was found {{at the entrance of}} a chamber with seven neonates crawling on or around her. When one of the young was moved a short distance from the chamber, <b>she</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> agitated and faced the intruder. Eventually, all of her offspring retreated into the chamber, but the female remained at the entrance, ready to strike.|$|E
25|$|Queen Mary {{design was}} criticised {{for being too}} traditional, {{especially}} when Normandie hull was revolutionary with a clipper-shaped, streamlined bow. Except for her cruiser stern, <b>she</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an enlarged version of her Cunard predecessors from the pre–First World War era. Her interior design, while mostly Art Deco, seemed restrained and conservative {{when compared to the}} ultramodern French liner. Queen Mary proved to be the more popular vessel than her larger rival, in terms of passengers carried.|$|E
25|$|Fields' health {{declined}} in July 1979, when she contracted pneumonia after performing an open-air concert on the Royal Yacht which was docked in Capri's harbour. After a spell in hospital, <b>she</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> recovering, but died on 27 September 1979. The press reported she died holding her husband's hand, {{but in reality}} he was at their Anacapri home at the time, while Gracie was home with the housekeeper, Irena. She is buried in Capri's Protestant Cemetery in a white marble tomb. Her coffin was carried by staff from her restaurant. Her husband Boris died on 3 July 1983.|$|E

25|$|The maltreatment {{of cattle}} at the Smithfield Market {{prompted}} Elizabeth Heyrick in 1823 to publish anonymously a stinging rebuke to those acting cruelly {{as well as}} to what she perceived was an apparent lack of punitive action taken against the perpetrators. Heyrick's short work began with strong words directed at the supporters of Martin's Act for not prosecuting those who abused animals. However <b>she</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> unaware that Broome had in 1822 already personally brought to court some individuals against whom charges of cruelty were heard. He also from his own pocket paid the salary for an inspector to monitor the abuse of animals at the Smithfield Market.|$|E
25|$|After the war, {{although}} Cliff was occasionally {{nostalgic for}} the 'Bizarre' years, as witnessed in personal letters to friends, <b>she</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> realistic {{and accepted the}} commercial taste was for conservative ware. Clarice seemed to enjoy playing a lesser role at the factory, knowing {{that she could not}} recapture those crazy days of the thirties. Much of the post-war production went to Australia, New Zealand or North America, where the taste was for formal ware in traditional English designs such as Tonquin rather than the striking patterns and shapes that had established Cliff's reputation; thus she was never to return to creative work. The post-war ware has little value at auction.|$|E
25|$|As Genie {{learned more}} {{language}} she gradually included more grammatical complexity in her speech during everyday interactions, {{and began to}} apply her language to more everyday situations. In late 1973 she startled linguists when she gave a monologue consisting {{of a series of}} short utterances to a small group of familiar adults, which was much longer than any of her previously recorded speech; while she only used grammar she had fully mastered <b>she</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> using different words to try to express herself, which Curtiss thought was a sort of free association, making it the closest she came to attempting any language experimentation. Genie subsequently spoke at this length on a few more occasions, always in the same manner and on similar topics. She also began to use language to describe fictional events, describing some of fantasies in language as early as January 1973 and attempting on at least two occasions in 1974 and 1975 to lie.|$|E

500|$|In March 2012, {{eleventh}} season contestant of American Idol, Hollie Cavanagh, {{covered the}} song. Her performance received mixed reviews from the judges of the show, {{who said that}} she was [...] "a little pitchy" [...] and added that <b>she</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> [...] "overthinking" [...] the song. Amy Reiter of Los Angeles Times noted that [...] "her clear, crisp tone, crashed and burned on 'Honesty,' missing notes and losing her way". Laura Prudom of The Huffington Post was mixed about her performance writing, [...] "She was occasionally pitchy on this song, and seemed to be overthinking it in parts and allowing the song to overwhelm her... Unusually, she seemed both nasal and pitchy in the early parts of the performance... her choice of a pantsuit was completely baffling, since it made her look nearer 40 than 20." [...] Later, during an interview, Cavanagh revealed that she had difficulties singing the song because she had never heard it before.|$|E

James Poniewozik for Time was not a fan of Salma Hayek's character, as she was not [...] "adding much to the show." [...] Poniewozik wrote that her character in this episode was the first time <b>she</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a [...] "fully contributing part of the ensemble." [...] Jack's scene in the church, along with him once claiming he was God in a deposition—a reference to Alec Baldwin's role in the film Malice (1993)—was well received, with Canning concluding that these traits make for [...] "an instant classic Jack Donaghy moment." ...|$|E

2500|$|Clinton {{was criticized}} for those remarks in the London press and by the {{newspaper}} Oxford Student, which angered the university by directly attacking her in an editorial. However, people who met Clinton at that time described her as charming, poised and unaffected, and <b>she</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> adjusting successfully to life abroad. During her time at Oxford, Chelsea adopted a more sophisticated look, reportedly assisted by a family friend, Donatella Versace, whose couture shows she attended in early 2002. Geordie Greig, the editor of Tatler, ranked her number five on the magazine's 2002 [...] "Top10 Girls" [...] list.|$|E

[...] She competed at the collegiate level in shot put and discus from 1999 to 2003, but missed 2000, while recovering from the knee injury. [...] Brown-Trafton was named as an NCAA All-American 6 times in her college career, two times during the indoor season as a shot putter and {{four times in the}} outdoor season for discus and shot put.

2500|$|Things did {{not improve}} for Bentley in 1945. She began {{an affair with a}} man whom she came to suspect was either an FBI or a Soviet agent sent to spy on her, and her Soviet contact {{suggested}} that she should emigrate to the Soviet Union—a move Bentley feared would end with her execution. In August 1945, Bentley went to the FBI office in New Haven, Connecticut and met with the agent in charge. She did not immediately defect, however. Instead <b>she</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> [...] "feeling out" [...] the FBI, and it would not be until November that she began to tell her full story to the FBI. In the meantime, her situation continued to worsen. In September she met with Anatoly Gorsky, her latest NKGB controller, and arrived at the meeting drunk. [...] She became angry with Gorsky, called him and his fellow Russian agents [...] "gangsters", and obliquely threatened to become an informer. She soon realized that her tirade could have put her life in danger, and in fact when Gorsky reported to Moscow his recommendation was to [...] "get rid of her".|$|E

The song was later included on the set list of the band's The Open Door Tour (2006–07) in support of their second studio album. According to Donnie Moorhouse of The Republican, it receives a [...] "full band treatment" [...] during the performances. While reviewing a concert by the band, Milwaukee Journal Sentinels Jon M. Gilbertson said that the title [...] "pushes away from rock's party mood". However, he praised Lee's live performance of the song saying that she [...] "projected so loudly and clearly that <b>she</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> trying to reach well {{beyond the confines of}} the Eagles Ballroom, and she hit the notes throughout the set. No screaming or growling, in other words." [...] Chris Harris of Rolling Stone described her performance of the song having [...] "everyone in the place headbanging along with Lee, whose hair whipped in circles wildly as she belted out the chorus". The Guardians Caroline Sullivan noted that for the [...] "doomy writhing and the darkness" [...] of the song, Lee [...] "cuts a triumphant figure".|$|E
