40|$|In this paper, a novel {{approach}} for cutting simulation of skive hobbing is presented. Skive hobbing is a process applied for finishing of already hardened gears. The process is characterized by varying tool engagements and very small chip thicknesses. The paper describes the process-modeling and {{the analysis of the}} workpiece-tool contact. For efficient modeling, a novel dexel-based method is presented for the description of a gear segment with discretized <b>stock</b> <b>allowance.</b> Characteristic of the method is an analytical description of the target workpiece contour which allows to describe points of the surface by Cartesian coordinates on the winding off. Dexel are oriented orthogonal {{to the surface of the}} final workpiece contour. The initial lengths of the dexel describe the <b>stock</b> <b>allowance.</b> By cutting these dexel with a tool, a time- and position-dependent prediction of material removal values, e. g. width of undeformed chip or undeformed chip thickness, is possible. Selected results are presented and interpreted. DFG/BO 3523 / 2 -...|$|E

40|$|Intensive {{appeal for}} energy saving has driven the {{production}} industry towards more environmentally benign manufacturing. Diverse process settings in manufacturing {{can result in}} a high variance of energy consumption. Regarding process chains, the allocation of machining stock to each process is very crucial in terms of energy use. Optimization of material <b>stock</b> <b>allowance</b> and process parameters can effectively reduce the production energy. In this study, two cylindrical machining processes – turning and grinding are compared at machine level with respect to energy intensity and surface roughness. A systematic energy-efficient approach, based on minimizing the production energy while complying with the required surface roughness, has been developed and validated to optimize the grinding stock for the turning-grinding process sequence. Compared to conventional stock allocation method, the developed approach results in 16. 6 % of energy reduction for the turning-grinding process. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCurrently {{composite}} manufacturing process, such as linear {{friction welding}} plus NC machining, {{is the main}} method for the manufacturing and repairing of complex parts with integrated structure. Due to different datum position and inevitable distortion from different processes, {{it is important to}} ensure sufficient machining allowance for complex parts during the NC machining process. In this paper, a workpiece localization approach for machining allowance optimization of complex parts based on CMM inspection is developed. This technique concerns an alignment process to ensure sufficient <b>stock</b> <b>allowance</b> for the single parts as well as the whole integrated parts. The mathematical model of the constrained alignment is firstly established, and then the symmetric block solution strategy is proposed to solve the optimization model. Experiment result shows that the approach is appropriate and feasible to distribute the machining allowance for the single and whole parts for adaptive machining of complex parts...|$|E
40|$|Part with {{sculptured}} surfaces {{is obtained}} in three stages: roughing, semi-finishing and finishing. The roughing operation consists in using flat end tools or fillet end tools on sequential horizontal cutting planes {{to remove the}} most material from the raw part {{as rapidly as possible}} using “Parallel Planes” or “Offset Contours ” machining strategy. When roughing deep parts, radial cutting forces, vibrations and tool bending are important. To avoid these disadvantages, the “Plunge Milling ” strategy is developed. The complex geometry of sculptured surfaces makes the tool path generation without interferences and collisions a very difficult task. In this paper, an automated methodology is proposed for roughing any part with sculptured surfaces from its STL model using “Plunge Milling ” strategy on 3 -axis CNC milling machines. After the specification of the principal parameters (<b>stock</b> <b>allowance,</b> radial cutting depth, radial step, tool diameter and sweeping mode), the methodology determines: 1) intersection contours, 2) machined segments, 3) plunging positions without interferences, 4) plunge depth for each valid plunging position, 5) minimum tool length avoiding collision and finally tool path in « One-Way » or « Zig-Zag » mode...|$|E

40|$|A {{turbulent}} {{manufacturing environment}} where uncertainty is inevitable {{does not allow}} for the availability of the required materials and resources when they are needed. This paper studies the implications of demand surges, lead-time variations and resources breakdown on the ability of a manufacturing system to achieve its delivery target. Simulation modelling was used to represent a stochastic manufacturing system, which is disturbed by these uncertainties. Manufacturing systems each with and without intelligent feedback were modelled. An intelligent feedback is represented via a set of algorithm, which reanalyse and self-organise the new status of the order {{in the presence of the}} uncertainties and update the relevant attributes before the order is released. Four types of intelligence were examined: (1) lead-time allowance, (2) capacity allowance, (3) safety <b>stock</b> <b>allowance</b> and (4) batching flexibility. Experiments results from each system were compared. It was found that the manufacturing system with intelligent feedback has a higher ability to achieve its delivery target by proactively tackling the variations caused by uncertainties. This study also found that the reliability of a work order in the presence of uncertainty could be improved by using an appropriate type of intelligence. which is dependent upon how and when the order was released. It was concluded from this research that intelligent feedback could help manufacturing enterprises proactively readjust the release of work orders that will be affected by uncertainties in order to improve the reliability and delivery of work orders.

30|$|From a macroperspective, {{some studies}} have {{analyzed}} how economic activities affected carbon emission trading. Chen et al. (2016) analyzed the effect of industrial economic activities on carbon price in China and finds {{a significant relationship between}} industrial economic activities and carbon price. Wang and Lu (2015) focused on the differences in the 6 pilot regions and found that the macroperspective has a positive effect on carbon price. Chevallier (2009) identified several macroeconomic drivers of European Union Allowances (EUA) prices. Economic activity and financial market shocks have been revealed to be among the fundamental drivers of carbon prices (Segnon et al. 2017). Bredin and Muckley (2011) reported a significant correlation between carbon prices and stock prices and an index of industrial production. It appears from these and related studies that the influence of compliance and the large list of potential fundamentals makes the carbon market more complex than other commodity markets and explains the significant attention that is paid to this market (Ellerman and Buchner 2007; Convery and Redmond 2007; Chevallier 2013; Zhang and Wei 2010), especially for an accurate review on the carbon price development in the EU ETS and its operating mechanism and economic effect. Alberola et al. (2008 a, b, c), Chevallier (2009) and Alberola and Chevallier (2009) had analyzed in detail the effects of institutional decisions (the emissions shortfall factor and banking restrictions) on the price path of carbon. Chevallier (2012) studied how banking instruments can be used to manage the <b>stock</b> of <b>allowances</b> in the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a one-dimensional cutting stock procedure which will minimize material wastage when {{a batch of}} small pieces are cut from several long pieces. The problem differs from the classical one-dimensional cutting stock problem in that {{the dimensions of the}} material to be cut are random variables due to fringe defects caused by the production process. Examples of such processes include the production of flat glass, laminated board, corrugated board, adhesive tape, carpeting, and insulating tape. The cutting procedure inevitably generates some material wastage and process delays caused by the need to set cutting knives in required positions. The approach followed in this paper is to minimize material wastage when cutting a batch of identical rolls of insulating tape from several long rolls with stationary cutting knives. An exact solution is presented for the case in which the variability of defects at both ends is independently distributed and the two distributions differ by a location parameter only. An approximate solution is also presented when the two end defect distributions differ by both scale and location parameters. The wastage resulting from the use of these procedures is then compared with the wastage generated when the positioning of the knives is altered every time an original piece is cut. This comparison enables management to decide when the positioning of the cutting knives should be fixed. production/scheduling: cutting <b>stock,</b> inventory/production: reject <b>allowances,</b> probability: stochastic model applications...|$|R
40|$|The {{amount of}} space {{provided}} to animals governs important elements of their behaviour and, hence, is critical for their health and welfare. We review the use of allometric principles and equations to estimate the static space requirements of animals when standing and lying, and the space required for animals to feed, drink, stand-up and lie-down. We use the research literature relating to transportation and intensive housing of sheep and cattle to assess the validity of allometric equations for estimating space allowances. We investigated these areas because transportation and intensive housing provide points along a continuum {{in terms of the}} duration of confinement, (from hours to months) and spatial requirements are likely to increase with increasing duration of confinement, as animals will need to perform a greater behavioural repertoire for long-term survival, health and welfare. We find that, although there are theoretical reasons why allometric relationships to space allowances may vary slightly for different classes of <b>stock,</b> space <b>allowances</b> that have been demonstrated to have adverse effects on animal welfare during transportation correlated well with an inability to accommodate standing animals, as estimated from allometry. For intensive housing, we were able to detect a space allowance below which there were adverse effects on welfare. For short duration transportation during which animals remain standing, a space allowance per animal described by the allometric equation: area (m) = 0. 020 W, where W = liveweight (kg), would appear to be appropriate. Where it is desirable for all animals to lie simultaneously, then a minimum space allowance per animal described by the allometric equation: area (m) = 0. 027 W appears to permit this, given that animals in a group time-share space. However, there are insufficient data to determine whether this allowance onboard a vehicle/vessel would enable animals to move and access food and water with ease. In intensive housing systems, a minimum space allowance per animal described by the allometric equation: area (m) = 0. 033 W appears to be the threshold below which there are adverse effects on welfare. These suggested space allowances require verification with a range of species under different thermal conditions and, for transportation, under different conditions of vehicular/vessel stability. The minimum length of trough per animal (L in m) required for feeding and drinking can be determined from L = 0. 064 W, with the number of animals required to feed/drink simultaneously taken into account, together with any requirement to minimise competition. This also requires verification with a range of species. We conclude that allometric relationships are an appropriate basis for the formulation of space allowances for livestock.

40|$|Animal Welfare {{has been}} a {{significantly}} important issue in the EU and receives more governmental attention than other countries. The idea of animal welfare for the public is usually from the animal epidemic news or food scandals, {{and it has not}} taken as an urgent issue to be solved in Taiwan. Intensive farming has been considered as a sufficient way to operate in agriculture in Taiwan because of limited space. While Council of Agriculture (COA) has been doing research projects of farm animal welfare and encourage students to conduct more researches in this area. People in Sweden consider that animal welfare is well organized in their country and has been taken care of by government and the responsible industries. Within the EU, there is a widespread agreement that Sweden is leading beyond. Since Sweden is the most advanced country in the field of farm animal welfare. Thus, the aim {{of this study is to}} improve the animal welfare and solve the main welfare problem in Taiwan by the example from Swedish approach. In this study, farming practice and animal welfare problem of pig and chicken in both countries are presented and discussed. There are many serious welfare problems in farm animal in Taiwan such as beak trimming, battery cages for laying hens; sow stalls, farrowing crates, teeth-clipping, environment temperature, tail docking, castration, <b>stocking</b> density, space <b>allowance,</b> heat stress and castration for pigs which are banned in the EU. Besides, contact dermatitis, low survival rate, inappropriate lighting, lacking record, cannibalism, and treatment of sick and weak chickens are the welfare problems of Taiwan country chicken which are unique problems in Taiwan, and they are important issues that need to be solved. How could we supervise and modify them and take the example from Sweden to improve the welfare of farm animals in Taiwan still needs more investigation and improvement. 動物福祉在歐盟已經是一個非常重要的議題並且比其他國家獲得更多的政府的關注。在台灣，一般人對動物福祉的概念通常是來自於動物疫病或食品問題的負面新聞，並非作為一個需要迫切解決的問題。台灣因為空間有限，密集式飼養 一直被視為最有效率的方式。農委會（COA）已經開始進行了一連串農場動物福祉的研究，並鼓勵學生從事這方面的研究。 在瑞典的民眾一般認為動物福祉在他們國家有著很好的政府規劃。在歐盟國中廣泛認為瑞典的動物福祉是領先其他盟國的。因此，由於瑞典是在農場動物福利領域最先進的國家，本研究的目的是藉由瑞典來改善動物福利和解決在台灣的主要福利問題，並介紹和討論這兩個國家兩種主要農場動物-豬和雞的飼養狀況與福祉問題。 在台灣有許多嚴重的農場動物的福利問題，如在歐盟被禁止的雞隻的修喙與巴達利蛋雞籠的使用；懷孕母豬夾欄、母豬分娩欄、剪齒、環境溫度、剪尾、飼養密度、飼養空間、熱緊迫、和豬的去勢。此外，在台灣土雞存在著許多獨有的福祉問題如：接觸性皮膚炎、低存活率、光照時間、飼養記錄不完整、同類相殘、病弱雞的處理等，都是我們必須想辦法解決的問題。該如何以瑞典經驗為範例來監督與修正以提高台灣農場動物的福利，仍需要更多的調查和改進。Contents Chapter 1 Introduction [...] 1 1. 1 Concept of animal welfare [...] . 1 1. 2 Farm Animal Welfare in Europe [...] 1 1. 3 Farm animal welfare in Taiwan [...] . 1 Chapter 2 The farm animal welfare in Sweden [...] 3 2. 1 Status [...] [...] 3 2. 1. 1 History of farm animal welfare in Sweden [...] 3 2. 1. 2 The Swedish approach [...] . 4 2. 1. 3 Consumers’ attitude to animal welfare in Europe and Sweden [...] . 9 2. 2 Production systems in Europe and Sweden [...] 10 2. 2. 1 Chickens in Sweden [...] 10 2. 2. 2 Pigs in Sweden [...] . 1 5 2. 3 Legislation in the EU and Sweden [...] . 17 2. 3. 1 Chickens in the EU and Sweden [...] 17 2. 3. 2 Pigs in the EU and Sweden [...] 20 2. 3. 3 European Legislation [...] . 22 2. 3. 4 National Animal Welfare Legislation [...] 22 2. 3. 5 Legislation in Sweden [...] . 22 Chapter 3 The farm animal welfare in Taiwan [...] . 24 3. 1 Chicken [...] .
