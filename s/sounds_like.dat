5|$|We were in {{a studio}} in New York, this place called the Magic Shop, and it had this thing called a tack piano there, which <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> an old honky-tonk piano, where you put little tacks in the hammers, so it <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> more of a {{harpsichord}} almost. And {{so we wanted to}} use that kind of sound, but we didn't have a tack piano, so rather than sample it, we went and bought an old piano from the shop up the road from our studio, and we bought a load of tacks, and me and Guy and Jon spent a couple of hours pushing tacks into the piano hammers.|$|E
5|$|Right before Van Halen's guitar solo begins, a {{noise is}} heard that <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> {{somebody}} knocking at a door. It is {{reported that the}} knock was a person walking into Eddie's recording studio. Another story has claimed that the sound was simply the musician knocking on his own guitar.|$|E
5|$|The usual {{call of the}} nelicourvi weaver is a high-pitched, very {{distinct}} chizz-chizz-chizz, {{which is}} more metallical and rasping when the birds are in feeding groups. Other calls that can be heard when the birds are at the nest include tsrrreee, tiang-tiang, and chet. The song, which is produced while being at the nest <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> chiz-chizz-chswriissssiszz.|$|E

40|$|Words {{which are}} palindromes may, or may not, <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> palindromes. NOON, PEEP, and KINNIKINNIK <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> palindromes. However, most palindromes {{with more than}} 4 letters do not <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> palindromes, an {{exception}} being the 5 letter MINIM. The palindromically-inconsistent sounds, sometimes subtle, are, nevertheless, real: MADAM, LEVEL, TENET, CIVIC, SOLOS, DEIFIED, and ROTATOR. On the other hand, there exist words which are not palindromes but which <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> palindromes. These are phonetic palindromes. MAIM is a phonetic palindrome...|$|R
5000|$|The songs fall mostly {{into two}} very {{different}} styles. Half <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> songs of the 1920s, the other half <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> late 1960s laid-back rock. [...] "Dismal Swamp" [...] is bluegrass.|$|R
5|$|Bee-eater nests may be raided by {{rats and}} snakes, and the adults are hunted by {{birds of prey}} such as the Levant sparrowhawk. The little {{bee-eater}} and red-throated bee-eaters are hosts of the greater honeyguide and the lesser honeyguide, both brood parasites. The young honeyguides kill the bee-eater's chicks and destroy any eggs. The begging call of the honeyguide <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> two bee-eater chicks, ensuring a good supply of food from the adult bee-eaters.|$|E
5|$|Radical Dreamers {{features}} minimal {{graphics and}} animation; most areas are rendered with dim, static backgrounds. The game also uses atmospheric music and <b>sounds.</b> <b>Like</b> other Chrono games, Radical Dreamers contains {{a variant of}} New Game + mode. Only one scenario {{is available on the}} first play-through; after finishing it and obtaining one of three possible endings, players can explore six others. These later stories often feature comical situations or allusions to Chrono Trigger.|$|E
5|$|The god Bragi asks where a thundering {{sound is}} coming from, {{and says that}} the benches of Valhalla are creaking—as if the god Baldr had {{returned}} to Valhalla—and that it <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> the movement of a thousand. Odin responds that Bragi knows well that the sounds are for Eric Bloodaxe, who will soon arrive in Valhalla. Odin tells the heroes Sigmund and Sinfjötli to rise to greet Eric and invite him into the hall, if it is indeed he.|$|E
5000|$|Studdert's inspirations {{included}} [...] "Tom Verlaine (Television's vocalist and songwriter), {{as well as}} Arthur Lee (of Love), Dylan, Neil Young and {{the poet}} Rimbaud", which were [...] "strong initial influence on his own songwriting style." [...] He told The Canberra Times Marie Ryan that [...] "What I'm really aiming for with this band is our own identifiable sound. I want Tactics to <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> themselves {{in the way that}} Talking Heads <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> themselves, Love <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> themselves and Television <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> themselves." [...] The band's [...] "quirky, embryonic sound met with virtual indifference in Canberra." ...|$|R
5000|$|Bel: [...] "this Emperor's Voice thing <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> {{something}} out of a fairy tale, to me. Until I got to the fine print. Then it <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> {{something out}} of a really gruesome fairy tale." ...|$|R
50|$|Boozer came up {{with this}} sciurine {{language}} by speculating what sapients without vocal cords would <b>sound</b> <b>like,</b> and decided they would <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> chipmunks then explored whether one could make a language composed entirely of unvoiced sounds.|$|R
5|$|A noisy species, {{the female}} has the deep quack stereotypically {{associated}} with ducks. Male mallards {{make a sound}} phonetically {{similar to that of}} the female, a typical quack, but it is a deep and raspy and can also sound like breeeeze. When incubating a nest, or when offspring are present, females vocalise differently, making a call that <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> a truncated version of the usual quack. They hiss if the nest or offspring are threatened or interfered with. When taking off, the wings of a mallard produce a characteristic faint whistling noise.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} {{argument in}} favor of dualism is that the mental and the physical seem to have quite different, and perhaps irreconcilable, properties. Mental events have a subjective quality, whereas physical events do not. So, for example, one can reasonably ask what a burnt finger feels like, or what a blue sky looks like, or what nice music <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> to a person. But it is meaningless, or at least odd, to ask what a surge in the uptake of glutamate in the dorsolateral portion of the hippocampus feels like.|$|E
5|$|Bears, crocodiles, golden jackals, leopards {{and snakes}} {{are the main}} predators of the jungle cat. The golden jackal, particularly, can be a major {{competitor}} to the cat. When it encounters a threat, the jungle cat will vocalise before engaging in attack, producing <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> small roars – a behavior uncommon for {{the other members of}} Felis. The meow of the jungle cat is also somewhat lower than that of a typical domestic cat. The jungle cat can host parasites such as Haemaphysalis and Heterophyes species.|$|E

Also, odd-numbered vowels followed by [...] are devoiced, while even-numbered vowels followed by [...] are not.|$|R
5000|$|Speaking to Billboard back in May 2016, drummer Adrian Young said of Dreamcar, [...] "It doesn’t <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> anything, it {{actually}} doesn’t <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> AFI or No Doubt. And sometimes I'm not objective enough {{to really understand}} it. And I ask my wife or friends, I play them a snippet and I go, 'Does this <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> either one of these bands?' And they’re like, 'No.' And I think that's a good thing." ...|$|R
5000|$|AllMusic critic William Ruhlmann {{said that}} [...] "on 'Because I Love You,' they <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> the Raspberries trying to <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> the Beatles." [...] Despite this comment, he still cited the song as a {{highlight}} from the Say No More album.|$|R
5|$|In a B plot, Andy (Chris Pratt) {{is doing}} well in his new job as the Pawnee shoeshiner, and Ron pays for a shine. Ron is {{impressed}} when Andy actually eases the pain from his bunion, and he later purposely scuffs his shoe {{so he can get}} a second shine. Andy is initially flattered, but starts to grow uncomfortable when Ron returns for a third shoeshine. This time, Ron makes an involuntary noise that <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> a sexual moan, seriously embarrassing both men. After a day of avoiding each other, Ron and Andy discuss the noise and decide {{it would be best to}} simply pretend it never happened.|$|E
5|$|Sound {{technicians}} {{spent the}} early part of the year trying to find the right sounds. Some, such as animal <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> those of tigers and walruses, were bought. Human voices were also used. Fran Walsh contributed to the Nazgûl scream and David Farmer the Warg howls. Other sounds were unexpected: the fell beast's screech is taken from that of a donkey, and the mûmakils bellow comes from the beginning and end of a lion's roar. In addition, ADR was used for most of the dialogue.|$|E
5|$|The {{black stork}} has {{a wider range}} of calls than the white stork, its main call being a chee leee, which <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> a loud inhalation. It makes a hissing call as a warning or threat. Displaying males produce a long series of wheezy raptor-like {{squealing}} calls rising in volume and then falling. It rarely indulges in mutual bill-clattering when adults meet at the nest. Adults will do so as part of their mating ritual or when angered. The young clatter their bills when aroused.|$|E
5000|$|... {{merges with}} [...] so sheep and cheap are {{pronounced}} alike. The {{outcome of the}} merger varies and can be either a fricative [...] (both cheap and sheep <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> sheep) or an affricate [...] (both cheap and sheep <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> cheap).|$|R
5000|$|When one {{speaks with}} a cold, the nasal {{passages}} still function as a resonant cavity so a denasalized nasal [...] does not <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> a voiced oral stop , and a denasalized vowel [...] does not <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> an oral vowel [...]|$|R
5000|$|An {{intrusive}} [...] may {{be inserted}} before a vowel in words {{that do not}} have [...] in the spelling. For example, drawing will <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> draw-ring, saw it will <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> sore it, the tuner is and the tuna is will both be [...]|$|R
5|$|Modern {{birds are}} known to {{communicate}} using visual and auditory signals, and the wide diversity of visual display structures among fossil dinosaur groups, such as horns, frills, crests, sails and feathers, suggests that visual communication has always been important in dinosaur biology. Reconstruction of the plumage color of Anchiornis huxleyi, suggest the importance of color in visual communication in non-avian dinosaurs. The evolution of dinosaur vocalization is less certain. Paleontologist Phil Senter suggests that non-avian dinosaurs relied mostly on visual displays and possibly non-vocal acoustic <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> hissing, jaw grinding or clapping, splashing and wing beating (possible in winged maniraptoran dinosaurs). He states they were unlikely to have been capable of vocalizing since their closest relatives, crocodilians and birds, use different means to vocalize, the former via the larynx and the latter through the unique syrinx, suggesting they evolved independently and their common ancestor was mute.|$|E
5|$|Soule was {{promptly}} given the task by Square to score Secret of Evermore. The finished game features an untraditional score incorporating ambient background <b>sounds</b> (<b>like</b> wind blowing and ocean waves) {{into the music}} and utilizing a more mellow orchestral sound. Part {{of the reason for}} this was that the sound program used in Evermore was not up to the technical challenge of what Soule wanted to do with it, forcing him to work creatively within his limitations. When Ron Gilbert of LucasArts left to form his own company, Humongous Entertainment, and Square moved from Seattle to Los Angeles, Soule quit Square to score Gilbert's children's adventure game series, Putt-Putt; he was the company's third employee. Soule composed the soundtracks to 11 children's games over the next three years, with multiple titles in the Putt-Putt, Pajama Sam, Freddi Fish and Spy Fox series.|$|E
5|$|Stewie is {{in terrible}} pain from {{teething}} and cannot find comfort anywhere. When his mother Lois {{tells him that}} his pain will ultimately pass, it gives him the idea to build a machine that will move time forward {{to the point where}} his teething will have already stopped. Meanwhile, Lois tells Peter to drive their other son Chris to his soccer match, then come right back to look after Stewie. However, Peter's friend Quagmire is there, and has brought beer, so Peter decides to ignore Lois and stay at the game. While there, another member of the crowd insults Chris. Enraged, Peter punches this person in the face, only to discover that it is a pregnant woman who looks and <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> a man.|$|E
5000|$|Steinman {{recruited}} {{a number}} of other songwriters for the album, including Desmond Child. Steinman told Child that he wanted a song about androgyny. [...] "I want a special song. The verses have to <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> Tina Turner, the B Section has to <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> The Police, U2, or Hall & Oates, and the chorus has to <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> Bruce Springsteen," [...] he continued. Child used the verbal guide to write [...] "If You Were a Woman (and I Was a Man)". He also wrote [...] "Lovers Again".|$|R
5000|$|Prefix Magazine critic Daba said, [...] "Where {{they used}} to <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> the {{crackling}} of a subway car rounding a bend or the seediest alleys of New York in the pre-dawn hours, here they <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> alt-rock renderings of what moody post-punk is supposed to sound like".|$|R
50|$|The band were {{managed by}} former Buzzcocks manager Richard Boon. Boon claimed in an {{interview}} at the time that Motivation <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> 1976 bands, which indicated the group <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> pre-punk formations or the first punk bands. Andy Hieke and Colin Robinson from Night Visitors were their sound engineers.|$|R
5|$|Tadpoles {{retain the}} lateral line system of their ancestral fishes, {{but this is}} lost in {{terrestrial}} adult amphibians. Some caecilians possess electroreceptors {{that allow them to}} locate objects around them when submerged in water. The ears are well developed in frogs. There is no external ear, but the large circular eardrum lies {{on the surface of the}} head just behind the eye. This vibrates and sound is transmitted through a single bone, the stapes, to the inner ear. Only high-frequency <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> mating calls are heard in this way, but low-frequency noises can be detected through another mechanism. There is a patch of specialized haircells, called papilla amphibiorum, in the inner ear capable of detecting deeper sounds. Another feature, unique to frogs and salamanders, is the columella-operculum complex adjoining the auditory capsule which is involved in the transmission of both airborne and seismic signals. The ears of salamanders and caecilians are less highly developed than those of frogs as they do not normally communicate with each other through the medium of sound.|$|E
5|$|The {{music and}} {{instruments}} in each level {{were chosen to}} correspond to the game world and the level's placement in the overall emotional arc. The music is composed of multiple layers of acoustic instrument tracks that rise and fall in correlation with the player's actions. The instruments used include pianos, string instruments such as classical guitars, and woodwinds such as bass flutes and bassoons. The number of instruments playing increases in correlation {{with the amount of}} petals that the player gathers. The music is meant to suggest natural <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> wind. The instrument tracks were intended to be able to stand on their own, even when used in a large orchestrated group as in levels three and six. Several times in the development process, Diamante became so attached to a piece of music that needed alteration that he composed a new piece to replace it. Diamante was long in talks with Sony to produce an album of music from the game. On April 8, 2010 a soundtrack album was released by Sony for purchase on the PlayStation Network. The album, titled Flower: Original Soundtrack from the Video Game, contains 8 tracks with a total duration of 1:04:37.|$|E
5|$|Back at the TARDIS, Jack begins {{integrating}} the extrapolator into the TARDIS {{to speed up}} the engine recharge. Rose and Mickey hang out together, and he admits to her that he is dating someone else because she is not there for him, and he begs her to promise him that she eventually will come back to him in the end, but before she can answer him, loud <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> thunder start to reverberate through the area. Cardiff is soon struck by a large earthquake that seems to be coming from the Rift. The Doctor, Margaret, Rose and Jack regroup and find that the extrapolator was a trap meant to redirect the energy from the TARDIS into the Rift, rupturing it. Jack and the Doctor are unable to stop the energy transfer, and Margaret takes Rose hostage and demands the extrapolator. The heart of the TARDIS opens on the console, bathing Margaret in light. While she is captivated by the light, Jack and the Doctor close the rift and disable the extrapolator. As the console closes, they find that Margaret's human suit is empty except for a Slitheen egg. The Doctor surmises that the TARDIS sensed that Margaret wanted a second chance at life and gave it to her. The TARDIS crew decides to return the egg to Raxacoricofallapatorius so Margaret can be raised in a different family. Rose realises Mickey has left without saying goodbye, and runs out to look for him in the nearby area, but he is gone. Rose returns to the TARDIS, clearly distraught, and the Doctor offers to wait a little longer so she can search for Mickey, but she declines, saying that he deserves better.|$|E

5000|$|The {{signal from}} the spark gap {{transmitter}} consisted of damped waves repeated at an audio frequency rate, from 120 to perhaps 4000 per second, so in the earphone the signal <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> a musical tone or buzz, and the Morse code [...] "dots" [...] and [...] "dashes" [...] <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> beeps.|$|R
