40|$|A three-pronged {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the possible link between timber harvest-related temperature elevations and <b>spring</b> chinook <b>salmon</b> (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) reproductive success. The study had three objectives: a) to determine if temperature experienced by adult <b>spring</b> chinook <b>salmon</b> prior to spawning influenced reproductive success, b) to determine if adult <b>spring</b> chinook <b>salmon</b> behaviorally regulate internal temperature through selection of cold-water refuges, and c) to characterize the thermal regimes historically tolerated by <b>spring</b> chinook <b>salmon</b> and to model the likely effects of forest practices on their success. To synthesize experimental results, TEMPEST, a stream reach temperature model, and stream temperature records were used to characterize the thermal regimes historically tolerated by <b>spring</b> chinook <b>salmon</b> and to predict the likely effects of forest practices on their success. Input parameters (view factor, mean annual air temperature, groundwater temperature, and stream depth) were selected based on historical distribution of <b>spring</b> chinook <b>salmon</b> and on heat transfer processes. Although <b>spring</b> chinook <b>salmon</b> residing within cool-water refuges may be capable of mitigating sub-lethal temperature effects, thermal refuge areas need to be abundant and available to the fish. Subsurface seepage may play a large role in stream temperature modification and thermal refuge formation. However, previous studies indicated that subsurface water temperatures may become elevated due to land use alterations. The availability of suitable thermal refuges and appropriate holding habitat within mainstem rivers may determine long-term population survival.

40|$|Historically, the Grande Ronde River {{produced}} {{an abundance of}} salmonids including stocks of spring, summer and fall chinook salmon, sockeye salmon, coho salmon, and summer steelhead. During the past century, numerous factors have caused the reduction of salmon stocks such that only sustainable stocks of <b>spring</b> chinook <b>salmon</b> and summer steelhead remain. The sizes of <b>spring</b> chinook <b>salmon</b> populations in the Grande Ronde River basin also have been declining steadily and are substantially depressed from estimates of historic levels. In addition {{to a decline in}} population abundance, a reduction of <b>spring</b> chinook <b>salmon</b> spawning distribution is evident in the Grande Ronde River basin. Numerous factors are thought to contribute to the decline of <b>spring</b> chinook <b>salmon</b> in the Snake River and its tributaries. These factors include passage problems and increased mortality of juvenile and adult migrants at mainstem Columbia and Snake river dams, overharvest, and habitat degradation associated with timber, agricultural, and land development practices. This study was designed to describe aspects of the life history strategies exhibited by <b>spring</b> chinook <b>salmon</b> in the Grande Ronde River basin. During the past year the focus was on rearing and migration patterns of juveniles in the upper Grande Ronde River and Catherine Creek. The study design included three objectives: (1) document the annual in-basin migration patterns for <b>spring</b> chinook <b>salmon</b> juveniles in the upper Grande Ronde River and Catherine Creek, including the abundance of migrants, migration timing and duration; (2) estimate and compare smolt survival indices to mainstem Columbia and Snake river dams for fall and spring migrating spring chinook salmon; and (3) determine summer and winter habitat utilization and preference of juvenile <b>spring</b> chinook <b>salmon</b> in the upper Grande Ronde River and Catherine Creek...|$|R

40|$|The Grande Ronde River {{originates}} in the Blue Mountains in northeast Oregon and flows 334 kilometers to its confluence with the Snake River near Rogersburg, Washington. Historically, the Grande Ronde River produced {{an abundance of}} salmonids including stocks of spring, summer and fall chinook salmon, sockeye salmon, coho salmon, and summer steelhead. During the past century, numerous factors have caused the reduction of salmon stocks such that only stocks of <b>spring</b> chinook <b>salmon</b> and summer steelhead remain. The sizes of <b>spring</b> chinook <b>salmon</b> populations in the Grande Ronde basin also have been declining steadily and are substantially depressed from estimates of historic levels. It is estimated that prior {{to the construction of}} the Columbia and Snake River dams, more than 20, 000 adult <b>spring</b> chinook <b>salmon</b> returned to spawn in the Grande Ronde River basin. A spawning escapement of 12, 200 adults was estimated for the Grande Ronde River basin in 1957. Recent population estimates have been variable year to year, yet remain a degree of magnitude lower than historic estimates. In 1992, the escapement estimate for the basin was 1, 022 adults (2. 4 {times} number of redds observed). In addition to a decline in population abundance, a constriction of <b>spring</b> chinook <b>salmon</b> spawning distribution is evident in the Grande Ronde basin. Historically, 21 streams supported spawning chinook salmon, yet today the majority of production is limited to eight tributary streams and the mainstem upper Grande Ronde River. Numerous factors are thought to contribute to the decline of <b>spring</b> chinook <b>salmon</b> in the Snake River and its tributaries. These factors include passage problems and increased mortality of juvenile and adult migrants at mainstem Columbia and Snake river dams, overharvest, and habitat degradation associated with timber, agricultural, and land development practices.

40|$|The study {{described}} in this report evaluated spawning distribution, overlap with naturally-arriving spawners, and pre-spawning mortality of <b>spring</b> chinook <b>salmon,</b> Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, outplanted as adults in the Clearwater River Subbasin in 2001. Returns of <b>spring</b> chinook <b>salmon</b> to Snake River Basin hatcheries and acclimation facilities in 2001 exceeded needs for hatchery production goals in Idaho. Consequently, management agencies including the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), Idaho Department of Fish and Game (IDFG) and Nez Perce Tribe (NPT) agreed to outplant chinook salmon adults as an adaptive management strategy for using hatchery adults. Adult outplants were made in streams or stream sections that have been typically underseeded with spawners. This strategy anticipated that outplanted hatchery chinook salmon would spawn successfully near the areas where they were planted, and would increase natural production. Outplanting of adult <b>spring</b> chinook <b>salmon</b> from hatcheries {{is likely to be}} proposed in years when run sizes {{are similar to those of}} the 2001 run. Careful monitoring of results from this year's outplanting can be used to guide decisions and methods for future adult outplanting. Numbers of <b>spring</b> chinook <b>salmon</b> outplanted was based on hatchery run size, hatchery needs, and available spawning habitat. Hatcheries involved in outplanting in the Clearwater Basin included Dworshak National Fish Hatchery, Kooskia National Fish Hatchery, Clearwater Anadromous Fish Hatchery, and Rapid River Fish Hatchery. The NPT, IDFG, FWS, and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) agreed upon outplant locations and a range of numbers of <b>spring</b> chinook <b>salmon</b> to be outplanted (Table 1). Outplanting occurred mainly in the Selway River Subbasin, but additional outplants were made in tributaries to the South Fork Clearwater River and the Lochsa River (Table 1). Actual outplanting activities were carried out primarily by the NPT with supplemental outplanting done in the Lochsa basin by IDFG. Fish were trucked from the hatcheries to outplant sites...|$|R
