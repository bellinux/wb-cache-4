40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the roles of}} health <b>goods</b> and <b>services</b> markets within the regional integration process.

The paper discusses {{the nature of the}} health sector and its global dimension, showing the peculiar features of health <b>goods</b> and <b>services</b> marked by economic complexity and (according to Arrow) information asymmetry. Despite that, the paper emphasizes old and new reasons that place health as a prerequisite to commercial integration. It approaches the role played by the State in health financing, provision and regulation and the commercial integration process. ...|$|R
