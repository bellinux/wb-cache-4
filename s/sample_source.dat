40|$|We examine {{technical}} aspects of surveying nonprofits to determine whether inferences about characteristics of the sector depend on how samples are drawn. We use a stratified sampling design drawn from a comprehensive database of Indiana nonprofits to address two key methodological questions faced by nonprofit researchers: (1) how do major nonprofit <b>sampling</b> <b>sources</b> compare in terms of survey efficiency, and (2) how do major profile features of the nonprofit sector (e. g., service field, revenue, funding mix, age) vary by <b>sampling</b> <b>source</b> and by how broadly researchers define the sector.

5000|$|The [...] "Dancing Baby" [...] {{phenomenon}} {{refers to}} a rendered animation of a baby performing a cha-cha type dance.

The original <b>sample</b> <b>source</b> file was produced and prepared by the original Character Studio development team (Michael Girard, Susan Amkraut, John Chadwick, Paul Bloemink, John Hutchinson, Adam Felt) at Unreal Pictures and Kinetix/Autodesk, amongst several other sample files. The cha-cha animation was created using the [...] "Biped" [...] animation system of Character Studio by Robert Lurye and Michael Girard. The 3D model of a human baby was added later by the development team as one of the character [...] "skins" [...] for the rendered animation. The original [...] "Toddler with Diaper" [...] model #VP5653 was built by, and courtesy of, Viewpoint Datalabs, with the bulk of the skinning and rigging performed by John Chadwick using the [...] "Physique" [...] skin/deformation system in Character Studio, and final edits by John and members of the Autodesk development team. After the first pre-release application of the 3D baby model to the cha-cha animation (and from pre-release showings), Kinetix/Autodesk employees realized it was amusing to see a baby dance a cha-cha rather than just walk; this helped ensure the selection of the 'dancing baby' as a sample file for debut release of Character Studio and for demonstration videos in product promotion.|$|E
5000|$|Daniel Lopatin {{conceived}} Replica as [...] "an electronic song cycle" [...] and, {{despite the}} lack of conventional singing on the album, aimed for the album's tracks [...] "to feel like vignettes that are recognizable and hummable, instead of just letting things glide ambiently." [...] Replica is more substantially sample-based than Lopatin's previous work, described by Miles Bowe of Stereogum as [...] "chopped and screwed plunderphonics" [...] and Exclaim!s Mark E. Rich as [...] "a sharp left turn that has him indebted to early 2000s electronic visionaries like Matmos, Akufen and Matthew Herbert, utilizing a specific <b>sample</b> <b>source</b> across the record." [...] The presence of rhythmic structures is more apparent in the album's songs, albeit through the use of sampled loops as opposed to conventional drum tracks and beats. In addition to the Roland Juno-60 synthesizer, prominently used in preceding Oneohtrix Point Never albums, Lopatin and collaborators Al Carlson and Joel Ford utilized other digital instruments, including samplers such as the Roland SP-555 and Akai MPC and synthesizers such as the Spectrasonics Omnisphere, Roland D-50, and Yamaha CS-01. Replica was Lopatin's first album to be completed in a formal studio setting, with recording sessions taking place using the complex owned by his label Mexican Summer.|$|E

Of the multiple variables inherent in any such process, none {{is more important to}} outcome than the appropriateness of the <b>sample</b> <b>source.</b> To address this question, we investigated CTCs in paired peripheral venous and arterial blood specimens obtained from stage IV uveal melanoma patients. MethodsBlood specimens were obtained from both common femoral arteries and antecubital veins in 17 uveal melanoma patients with multiple hepatic metastases for CTC measurements. FindingCTCs were detectable with greater frequency (100 %) and in larger numbers (median 5, range 1 to 168) in all arterial blood specimens than in venous samples (52. 9 %; median 1, range 0 to 8). Patients with hepatic as well as extra-hepatic metastasis showed higher number of arterial CTCs, compared to patients with liver-only metastasis (p= 0. 003). There was no significant association between the number of arterial CTCs and the tumor burden within the liver in patients who had liver-only metastases. InterpretationOur data indicate that arterial blood specimens might be a better source of circulating uveal melanoma cells.

40|$|The Differential Staining Cytotoxicity (DiSC) assay {{has been}} used to study the effects of <b>sample</b> <b>source</b> and cell {{concentration}} on the in vitro chemosensitivity of haematological malignancies. The chemosensitivity of blood and bone marrow samples was significantly associated (P less than 0. 001) in 12 cases where both were tested simultaneously. In 8 of the cases, where the in vitro result could be compared with clinical response, the in vitro and in vivo chemosensitivity was in agreement in 7, for both blood and bone marrow samples. The in vitro chemosensitivity of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia blood lymphocytes was dependent on the cell concentration for 4 out of 5 drugs tested. A five fold reduction in cell number resulted in a significantly greater cell kill with 4 -hydroperoxycyclophosphamide, a greater cell kill (not significant) with chlorambucil and adriamycin, and a significantly lower cell kill with prednisolone. The cell concentration did not affect vincristine cytotoxicity.
