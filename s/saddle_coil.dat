50|$|The <b>saddle</b> <b>coil</b> {{shows the}} most complex {{geometry}} of these three coil types.The B1 field is generated primarily by the four vertical wire segments. Because of this coil geometry, the B1 field of a <b>saddle</b> <b>coil</b> is more homogeneous in z direction {{than that of a}} planar coil. The <b>saddle</b> <b>coil</b> can be formed from wire, but it is also often etched from thin copper foil, which is then adhered to glass or PTFE tubing. The latter procedure leads to a high geometric precision, resulting in better B1 homogeneity. The <b>saddle</b> <b>coil</b> is easily accessible and provides a good ‘filling factor’ of the usable area in the magnet bore. For these reasons it is widely used in NMR microscopy. However, these advantages are achieved at the price of decreased sensitivity. Compared to a <b>saddle</b> <b>coil,</b> the sensitivity performance of a solenoidal coil of the same dimensions is approximately three times better.|$|E
40|$|The <b>saddle</b> <b>coil</b> {{is used in}} MRI/MRS (magnetoresonance imagging/scanning) {{applications}} {{in the position of}} gradient coils or RF probes. Gradient coils produce a linearly growing magnetic field along one axis and a homogenous magnetic field in the remaining ones, which gives us something like a coordinate system used for evaluating the measured data. RF Saddle coils should have a constant magnetic field in its entire area and serve as both the transmitter and the receiver for experiments. Those coils are tuned to the specified frequencies and obtain spectral ranges we want to process. The major emphasis is put on the good matching of the coil to the system instead on achieving a good homogenity of the magnetic field. Also a high Q factor of the coil is preferred. The methods of the RF <b>Saddle</b> <b>coil</b> design are based on thr inductance calculation and evaluation of the incident resonant frequency. In this article a method of <b>Saddle</b> <b>coil</b> design for large objects is described, resonant frequency calculations are proposed and in the conclusion the two coils are compared...|$|E

The parallel-plate coil has a satisfactory homogeneity of B 1 field over the whole internal space. The signal-to-noise ratio measured for all three coils is roughly the same and is given by the magnitude of RF pre-amplifier noise. As the slotted-tube and parallel-plate coils have a lower inductance compared with the <b>saddle</b> <b>coil,</b> they can be tuned to resonance on the 200 MHz frequency even at larger dimensions. The results show that the parallel-plate coil has very good properties for the measurement of small animals...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the initial electrical and mechanical design of two phase-locked 30 Megawatt RMS, 150 kHz oscillator systems used for current drive and plasma sustainment of the ''Translation, Confinement, and Sustainment'' (TCS) field reversed configuration (FRC) plasma. By {{the application of}} orthogonally-placed saddle coils {{on the surface of}} the glass vacuum vessel, the phase-controlled rotating magnetic field perturbation will induce an electric field in the plasma which should counter the intrinsic ohmic decay of the plasma, and maintain the FRC. Each system utilizes a bank of 6 parallel magnetically beamed ML 8618 triodes. These devices are rated at 250 Amperes cathode current and a 45 kV plate voltage. An advantage of the magnetically beamed triode is their extreme efficiency, requiring only 2. 5 kW of filament and a few amps and a few kV of grid drive. Each 3. 5 uH <b>saddle</b> <b>coil</b> is configured with an adjustable tank circuit (for tuning). Assuming no losses and a nominal 18 kV plate voltage, the tubes can circulate about 30 kV and 9 kA (pk to pk) in the <b>saddle</b> <b>coil</b> antenna, a circulating power of over 33 megawatts RMS. On each cycle the tubes can kick in up to 1500 Amperes, providing a robust phase control. DC high-voltage from the tubes is isolated from the <b>saddle</b> <b>coil</b> antennas and tank circuits by a 1 : 1 coaxial air-core balun transformer. To control the ML 8618 's phase and amplitude, fast 150 Ampere ''totem-pole'' grid drivers, an ''on'' hot-deck and an ''off'' hot-deck are utilized. The hot-decks use up to 6 each 3 CPX 1500 A 7 slotted radial beam triodes. By adjusting the conduction angle, amplitude may be regulated, with inter-pulse timing, phase angle can be controlled. A central feedback timing chassis monitors each systems' <b>saddle</b> <b>coil</b> antenna and appropriately derives each systems timing signals. Fiber-optic cables are used to isolate between the control room timing chassis and the remote power oscillator system.

We can change the sensitivity of the micro coil by deforming the shape of the coil from a saddle-shaped mode to a planar-shaped mode. The inductance, the resistance, and the Q-factor of the coil in the saddle-shaped mode were 2. 45 μH, 3. 31 Ω, and 39. 9, respectively. Those of the planar-shaped mode were 3. 07 μH, 3. 92 Ω, and 42. 9, respectively. In MRI acquired in saddle-shaped mode, a large visible area existed around the coil. Although the sensitive area was considerably reduced in the planar-shaped mode, clear MRI images were obtained.

40|$|Abstract. We {{investigated}} {{the magnetic field}} resulting from a set of “saddle coils” on the COMPASS tokamak, which is now being transferred from UKAEA Culham to IPP Prague. The purpose of the <b>saddle</b> <b>coils</b> is to create resonant magnetic perturbations (RMPs), either to simulate effects of RMPs that inevitably occur because of error fields or to exploit the impact of RMPs on the plasma, for example their ability to control the edge localized modes (ELMs). We have thus focused on examining the perturbation Fourier spectra and their resonances with the unperturbed safety factor profile. Those resonances result in creation of magnetic islands on the resonant magnetic surfaces and possibly of an ergodic region which leads {{to an increase in}} radial transport. Knowledge of the Fourier spectrum enables us to estimate the sizes and positions of the islands and location of the ergodic region. The computed perturbation field is also used to obtain Poincaré plots of intersections of field lines with a poloidal plane, which give a more precise image of the ergodic region.
