40|$|Abstract. In this study, <b>sulphur</b> <b>dye</b> {{was used}} for dyeing 100 % cotton knitted fabric {{and the effect of}} dye {{concentration}} and colour shade on ultraviolet protection factor (UPF) was discussed. The results indicated that the UVR absorbency of <b>sulphur</b> <b>dye</b> was not satisfactory. Generally speaking, the higher the dye concentration, the darker the shade of fabric. Nevertheless, it did not affect the UPF of fabric if the absorbency of the selected dye was ineffective...|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} {{problem with}} sulphur dyes application concerns his quantitative determination during dyeing process.

40|$|Performance of {{the colored}} cotton fabrics <b>dyed</b> with <b>sulphur,</b> vat, direct and {{reactive}} dyes was investigated by using two crosslinkers. DMDHEU {{was used as}} formaldehyde based crosslinker and BTCA was assessed as a zero formaldehyde alternative. Shade change of the fabrics treated with both crosslinkers was comparable and in acceptable range apart from all <b>sulphur</b> <b>dyes</b> and two reactive dyes. However, shade change of the <b>sulphur</b> <b>dyed</b> fabrics was significantly improved when typical sodium hypophosphite based catalyst for BTCA was replaced with sodium phosphate. In addition, tensile strength and easy care performance of the crosslinker treated dyed fabric was also assessed...|$|R
30|$|Moreover, {{the figures}} show that in the warp wise {{direction}} reduction in stiffness is higher as compared to weft direction. This {{could be attributed to}} the construction of fabrics which were 2 ends up warp face twill weave. As a result warp yarns face higher amount of friction than weft yarns. The figures also shows that trend of reduction in stiffness in both warp and weft way direction treated with both the enzymes are similar for indigo and <b>sulphur</b> <b>dyed</b> denims. This may be because the effect of enzymes on stiffness is independent of the dye applied to the fabric.|$|R
30|$|The {{treatment}} of denim fabrics with cellulase enzymes gave effective results {{in terms of}} colour fading. The fading effect achieved was shown by the change in colour strength while the removal of surface fibres {{was clear from the}} loss in weight of the denim qualities. The effect was more in case of acid cellulase due to their stronger action than neutral cellulose. However, in <b>sulphur</b> <b>dyed</b> fabric, the back staining was significant in case of acid enzyme, because of high colour removal and subsequently its redeposition. The application of anti-back staining agent was found to be quite useful in this case. Good softness was achieved in both the fabric qualities, shown in terms of decrease in bending length.|$|R

30|$|During enzyme washing, {{cellulose}} is degraded and <b>sulphur</b> <b>dye</b> is released. The cellulase enzymes are temporarily {{bound to}} the cellulose {{by means of an}} anchor. The surface fibre possibly gets split in terms of 1, 4 -β glycoside composition (Kumar et al. 1997). After this process it is made available for further hydrolysis reaction. The cellulose is degraded hydrolytically by cellulases partially until it becomes glucose. The glucose to some extent is likely to reduce the <b>sulphur</b> <b>dye,</b> both on the fibre and in the treatment liquor (Akram 2010). This reduced form has limited affinity to cellulose fibre and thus soils the weft thread and the pocket lining. The acid cellulase enzymes have a strong effect on cellulose hydrolysis and create more glucose formation, resulting in increased back staining of the denim garment. Neutral cellulase as compared to acid cellulase, are less aggressive and hence there is less back staining.|$|E

The fading effect of <b>sulphur</b> <b>dyed</b> denim samples with two different enzymes before and after Denimax core 1380 S treatment are shown in Fig.  5 c and also for white cotton pocket lining fabric in Fig.  5 d.

30|$|A wide ranging finish {{effects have}} been given to denim fabrics in {{industrial}} scale to make it more fashionable and functional. Among the numerous wet and dry treatments given, worn out looks of various kinds have received the maximum attention. In this context, herein, two denim fabrics, one dyed with vat indigo and the other with sulphur black were enzyme washed. The enzymes used were acid cellulase and neutral cellulase and the treatments were done at varying concentrations, time and mechanical agitation. The trials so taken were based on design of experiments, and the effect was analysed in terms of decrease in colour depth and weight loss. Back staining of fabric during the wash was also checked and acid enzyme despite higher colour removal, caused significant staining in <b>sulphur</b> <b>dyed</b> quality. Attempt was made to contain this back staining by suitable treatment. The application conditions of cellulases on the denim qualities were also optimized for fading effect.|$|R
40|$|This article gives {{a summary}} of the most {{commonly}} used ecologically unfriendly processes for the reduction and oxidation of vat and <b>sulphur</b> <b>dyes.</b> It also describes the new alternatives that are in the development stage and could be important in the near future. Sodium dithionite as the dominant reducing agent produces large amounts of sodium sulphate, and also toxic sulphite and thiosulphate as by-products. Consequently, high amounts of hydrogen peroxide and alkali are required for the treatment of effluents, which add to the cost of the process. Attempts have been made to use organic biodegradable reducing agents, enzymes, catalytic hydrogenation, and also indirect or direct, electrochemical reductive methods that employ a redox mediator (electron-carrier). The reduction has also been carried out via the dye radical molecule or, in the case of indigo, by direct electrochemical reduction using graphite as the electrode material. Physical techniques, for example using ultrasound, magnetic fields or UV {{have been shown to be}} effective only when used to accelerate methods using classical reduction and oxidation processes. However, although these methods offer some environmental benefits, there is still no satisfactory alternative reducing and/or oxidising agent available today...|$|R

40|$|The {{subject of}} this work was the {{discolouration}} of one side of dyed cotton fabric using UV-C radiation, testing for fastness to that external radiation agent.

The results for colour differences between the original dyed fabric and the fabric discoloured through UV-C radiation treatment show that, in general, the highest values were obtained for the reactive dyes and their mixtures, with the lowest values, in general, for the sulphur, vat and azo dyes, and intermediate values for direct dyesPostprint (published version...|$|E
30|$|Interestingly, {{the trend}} shown by sulphur dyed denim fabric is {{different}} from indigo dyed denim. This {{may be due to}} the reason that the dye removed from denim material after the treatment with cellulase cause back staining or re-deposition and re‑coloration of black threads and black coloration of white threads, resulting in less contrast between black and white threads. Moreover, higher amount of dye is present on the surface of the fabric and hence more dye is released in the bath, thus resulting in heavy back staining. Cellusoft Conc. L being an acid enzyme shows higher level of back-staining as compared to neutral enzyme and results in less contrast or higher K/S value. Also <b>sulphur</b> <b>dye</b> particles have less affinity towards neutral cellulase as compared to acid cellulase. Thus, chances of back-staining are less and better contrast and higher reduction in K/S value is achieved with Neutracell CLD.|$|E

40|$|Throughout history indigo {{was derived}} from various plants for example Dyer’s Woad (Isatis tinctoria L.) in Europe. In the 19 th century were the {{synthetic}} dyes developed and nowadays indigo is mainly synthesized from by-products of fossil fuels. Indigo is a so-called vat dye, which means {{that it needs to}} be reduced to its water soluble leucoform before dyeing. Nowadays, most of the industrial reduction is performed chemically by sodium dithionite. However, this is considered environmentally unfavourable because of waste waters contaminating degradation products. Therefore there has been interest to find new possibilities to reduce indigo. Possible alternatives for the application of dithionite as the reducing agent are biologically induced reduction and electrochemical reduction. Glucose and other reducing sugars have recently been suggested as possible environmentally friendly alternatives as reducing agents for <b>sulphur</b> <b>dyes</b> and there have also been interest in using glucose to reduce indigo. In spite of the development of several types of processes, very {{little is known about the}} mechanism and kinetics associated with the reduction of indigo. This study aims at investigating the reduction and electrochemical analysis methods of indigo and give insight on the reduction mechanism of indigo. Anthraquinone as well as it’s derivative 1, 8 -dihydroxyanthraquinone were discovered to act as catalysts for the glucose induced reduction of indigo. Anthraquinone introduces a strong catalytic effect which is explained by invoking a molecular “wedge effect” during co-intercalation of Na+ and anthraquinone into the layered indigo crystal. The study includes also research on the extraction of plant-derived indigo from woad and the examination of the effect of this method to the yield and purity of indigo. The purity has been conventionally studied spectrophotometrically and a new hydrodynamic electrode system is introduced in this study. A vibrating probe is used in following electrochemically the leuco -indigo formation with glucose as a reducing agent...|$|R
40|$|The strong {{electromagnetic}} field enhancement, occurring at illuminated metal structures with sub-wavelength dimensions, is exploited to develop Raman spectroscopy with exceedingly high sensitivity and lateral resolution, possibly down to single molecule detection.

40|$|Abstract. In recent years, {{the use of}} low-environmental impact {{biotechnology}} giving {{rises to}} new types of treatment in the textile industry. From the environmental point of view, particularly the textile dyeing process constitutes a major pollution problem due to the variety and complexity of chemicals employed. In most industrial vat and indigo, sulphur dyeing processes, {{all of them are}} reduced mainly using sodium dithionite. This process produces large amounts of hazardous by-products which increase the costs for waste water treatment. Hence, many attempts are being made to replace the environmentally unfavorable sodium dithionite by ecologically more attractive alternatives, such as organic reducing agents or catalytic hydrogenation and natural reducing agent. In this paper,a natural reducing agent is introduced that comes from a plant and have been studied on the substance for comparison it with sodium dithionite on vat, indigo and sulphur dyeing on cotton fabrics. The color strength of the samples was analyzed by Reflective Spectrophotometer and the color fastness of them was investigated. The results show that, the use of natural reducing agent in natural indigo dye and <b>sulphur</b> <b>dye</b> is better {{and for the rest of}} them has almost good advantage, but it cannot reduce synthetic indigo as well as sodium dithionite. Therefore, with introducing the substance, consumption of chemicals is minimized and vat, indigo and sulphur dyeing should be environmental. ...|$|E
40|$|Cotton {{knitted fabrics}} were {{manufactured}} with different yarn types (conventional ring spun yarn and torque-free ring spun yarn) with different fibre types (combed cotton and combed Supima cotton) and yarn fineness (Ne 30 and Ne 40). These fabrics were then dyed with {{three types of}} dye (reactive, direct and <b>sulphur</b> <b>dye)</b> with three dye concentrations (0. 1 %, 1. 0 % and 5. 0 % on-weight of fabric (owf)) in three colours (red, yellow and blue). This study examined the impact of constructional parameters and dyeing on ultraviolet (UV) protection properties of cotton knitted fabric. In-vitro test with spectrophotometer was used for evaluating the UV protection property of dyed cotton knitted fabrics. Among the six parameters investigated, fineness of yarn and dye concentration were the most significant factors affecting UPF while the color effect is the least significant. Experimental results revealed that the UPF value of dyed fabrics made from combed cotton is generally higher than the combed Supima cotton since combed cotton is composed of shorter fibres which facilitate the blocking or absorption of UV radiation. Second, fabrics made with twist yarn (i. e. ring spun yarn) have higher UPF value than the corresponding ESTex one (i. e. Torque-free yarn) in general since fabrics made with ring spun yarn tend to shrink during wet processing {{and so it is}} more compact. Third, the UPF value of fabrics made with 30 Ne yarn was higher than the 40 Ne one since it is thicker and has lower fabric porosity. Fourth, fabrics dyed with lower concentration of dye gave the lowest UPF. Fifth, the sulphur dyed samples performed worse than the reactive and direct dyed samples in terms of UV protection property. Sixth, there is no significant difference in UPF for red, yellow and blue coloured fabrics. Seventh, this study also demonstrated that lightness of fabric is negatively related to UV protection property. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|E

40|$|Background: Industrial dyestuffs are {{the main}} sources of the {{discharge}} of dye pollutants into the environment, which are hardly degradable in the conventional biological treatment plants. Therefore, finding an effective method of treatment is urgent for color removal from dye-contaminated effluents. Objectives: In the present study, the photocatalytic degradation of C. I. Sulphur Red 14 was studied by using UV/ZnO process. Materials and Methods: In this work, ZnO catalyst and mercury lamp (UV-C, 254 nm) have been applied for removal of the C. I. <b>Sulphur</b> Red 14 <b>dye</b> from aqueous environments. The influence of various parameters such {{as the amount of}} ZnO, initial dye concentration, pH level, and H 2 O 2 presence were also examined. Results: The results showed that the optimum catalyst dose was found to be 50 mg/L. The maximum rate of decolorization was obtained in acidic condition at pH 5 and the initial dye concentration of 10 mg/L. Photodegradation of C. I.

2500|$|Following the {{invention}} of coal gas early in the 19th century, {{it was discovered that}} numerous organic and inorganic chemicals could be obtained when purifying the gas. Processes began to be developed to recover these, and a major branch of the British chemical industry – the coal tar and ammonia by-products industry – came into existence. By 1876 a nearby company, Burt, Boulton and Haywood of Silvertown, was distilling each year [...] of coal tar to manufacture ingredients for disinfectants, insecticides and <b>dyes.</b> <b>Sulphur</b> from the gas works was the raw material for local manufacturers of sulphuric acid needed by other nearby companies producing products such as fertilizers. Subsequently the GLCC decided that it would carry out the processing of by-products itself, rather than sell them to independent chemical companies. A purpose-built chemical works, Beckton Products Works, was constructed in 1879. It was the largest tar and ammonia by-products works in the UK, possibly in the world. Besides millions of gallons of road tar, products included phenol, the cresols and xylenols, naphthalene, pyridine bases, creosote, benzene, toluene, xylene, solvent naphtha, ammonium sulphate and ammonia solution, sulphuric acid, picolines, quinoline, quinaldine, acenaphthene, anthracene and dicyclopentadiene. Since the Products works was dependent on by-products of gas manufacture it could not long survive the introduction of natural gas. The last train carrying chemical products, a load of pitch, left the works on 1 June 1970.|$|R

Presence of <b>sulphur,</b> naphthol, vat <b>dyes,</b> nitrates, acetic acid, soaps, enzymes chromium compounds and heavy metals like copper, arsenic, lead, cad- mium, mercury, nickel, and cobalt and certain auxiliary chemicals all collectively make the textile effluent highly toxic.

These organic materials react with many disinfectants especially chlorine and form by products (DBP’S) that are often carcinogenic and therefore undesirable. Many of these show allergic reactions. The colloidal matter present along with colors and oily scum increases the turbidity, gives the water a bad appearance and foul smell and prevents the penetration of sunlight necessary for the process of photosynthesis. This in turn interferes with the Oxygen transfer mechanism at air water interface which in turn interferes with marine life and self purification process of water. This effluent if allowed to flow in the fields’ clogs the pores of the soil resulting in loss of soil productivity. If allowed to flow in drains and rivers it effects the quality of drinking water in hand pumps making it unfit for human consumption.
