5|$|Truchet tiles are square tiles {{decorated}} with patterns <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not have rotational symmetry; in 1704, Sébastien Truchet used a square tile {{split into two}} triangles of contrasting colours. These can tile the plane either periodically or randomly.|$|E
5|$|Although {{satellite}} {{males are}} on average slightly smaller and lighter than residents, the nutrition of the chicks does not, as previously thought, influence mating strategy; rather, the inherited mating strategy influences body size. Resident-type chicks will, if {{provided with the}} same amount of food, grow heavier than satellite-type chicks. Satellite males do not have to expend energy to defend a territory, and can spend more time foraging, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not need to be as bulky as the residents; indeed, since they fly more, there would be a physiological cost to additional weight.|$|E

5|$|Downtown Boston's streets grew organically, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> {{not form}} a planned grid, unlike those in later-developed Back Bay, East Boston, the South End, and South Boston. Boston is the eastern {{terminus}} of I-90, which in Massachusetts {{runs along the}} Massachusetts Turnpike. The elevated portion of the Central Artery, which carried most of the through traffic in downtown Boston, was replaced with the O'Neill Tunnel during the Big Dig, substantially completed in early 2006.|$|E
5|$|Early {{settlers}} and property owners {{contributed to the}} development of the city, and many families and individuals are remembered in street names. Streets laid out when Utica was a village had more irregularities than those built later in the 19th and 20thcenturies. As a result of the city's location (adjacent to the Mohawk River), many streets parallel the river, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not run strictly east-west or north–south. Remnants of Utica's early electric-rail systems can be seen in the West and South neighborhoods, where the rails were set into the streets.|$|E
5|$|In {{embryonic}} development, {{the lungs}} {{begin to develop}} as an outpouching of the foregut, a tube which goes on to form {{the upper part of}} the digestive system. When the lungs are formed the fetus is held in the fluid-filled amniotic sac and <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not function to breathe. Blood is also diverted from the lungs through the ductus arteriosus. At birth however, air begins to pass through the lungs, and the diversionary duct closes, so that the lungs can begin to respire. The lungs only fully develop in early childhood.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to these natural factors, much has been done intentionally to make the skies at the park clear and dark and help keep them that way. Within the park, former overhead electrical lines have been buried <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not obstruct views, all lighting is shielded, and all white lights have been converted to red, which has the least effect on night vision and astrophotography. Light from passing vehicles is blocked by earthen berms covered with grass, or shrubbery and spruce trees; the Astronomy Field gate has a special light-blocking tarp. The park's Dark Sky Fund has paid {{for many of these}} improvements since 1999.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) and Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{travel to}} New York City to party with Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak). Ryan starts acting erratically, {{and it is}} {{revealed}} that he is {{under the influence of}} drugs. Meanwhile, the remaining employees are going to be forced to work on a Saturday. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) proposes that they work late on Friday, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not have to come in the next day. Once Jim and his co-workers finish working, they find that they are locked in, and everyone quickly places the blame on Jim.|$|E
5|$|The Country Sunrise News {{stated that}} the drama has a fast pace. Mallory Clarkson of the London Community News {{reported}} that, while She Has a Name is an emotional play, there are lighter moments where audience members can laugh. Similarly, Lana Michelin of the Red Deer Advocate asserted that the play's sporadic humorous points maintain the audience's engagement with the story <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not become numb to the play's emotional pulls. Kooman stated {{that he tried to}} write the play {{in a way that would}} shock audiences without disturbing them to the point that they would not recommend it to friends.|$|E

5|$|Certain areas did {{not report}} their income to the Exchequer, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not usually appear in the Pipe rolls, unless the lands were in the king's custody through a vacancy. These {{included}} the palatinates of Durham and Chester. The county of Cornwall also did not usually appear in the Pipe rolls, {{but it was not}} a palatinate. Another problem with using the Pipe rolls for historical study is the fact that the chronological limits for the financial year varied from roll to roll. In theory, they only recorded revenues from the previous Easter to Michaelmas of that financial year. However, the Pipe rolls often record payments made past Michaelmas, often up until the date the roll was actually compiled. Also, a few debts were not audited annually, but would instead have a number of consecutive years be investigated in one sitting and thus several years of payments would be recorded in one Pipe roll.|$|E
5|$|Fundamental {{physical}} constants {{are often}} highly dependent upon each other. This {{implies that the}} best value of a fundamental physical constant, one with the least uncertainty, often can be determined by directly measuring other fundamental physical constants, from which the value can be calculated. The uncertainty in these constants is then determined from {{the uncertainty of the}} others by the propagation of uncertainty. Constants whose value is fixed, for determining the units in which they are expressed, don't have an uncertainty associated with them, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not account for any extra uncertainty {{in the value of the}} calculated constant. One of the reasons the SI unit system will be changed is that determination of values can often be greatly improved if expressed in these new units. This is due to the dependence of these values on physical constants.|$|E
5|$|Dot holds a {{birthday}} party for Dotty, inviting Tiffany (Maisie Smith) and Liam Butcher (James Forde), {{but they do not}} want to attend. The next day, Tiffany tells Dotty she is not invited to her birthday party. Dotty tells Dot that Tiffany is not having a party and asks if they can invite her round. When they ask Tiffany's mother Bianca (Patsy Palmer), Bianca invites them to Tiffany's party. The next day, Tiffany and Dotty lie <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not have to go to school. Dotty takes Tiffany's bridesmaid's dress and MP3 player, after Tiffany does not allow her to try the dress on, and runs away with them, throwing the MP3 player into a bin. Dotty pushes Tiffany into the bin as she tries to retrieve it. Dotty then runs away to avoid getting in trouble, and when Tiffany is found, Bianca visits Dot, who is unsure about Bianca's claims. Dotty tells Dot she knows nothing about the dress but Dot then finds it in Dotty's school bag. Dot returns the dress to Bianca without Dotty's knowledge. The next day, Dotty is left alone with Dot's husband Jim (John Bardon) who is recovering from a stroke. She pours water on him to make it seem he has wet himself, but Dot catches her. Dotty says she hates them both and wishes that Nick had killed Dot. Dot smacks Dotty across the legs and Dotty manipulates her into letting her stay off school. After Dotty calls the police, Dot is arrested for assault but is released without charge and Dotty apologises.|$|E
