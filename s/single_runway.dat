5|$|On 1 May, {{the first}} mission was {{conducted}} by a single Vulcan (XM607) that flew over Port Stanley and dropped its bombs on the airfield concentrating on the <b>single</b> <b>runway,</b> with one direct hit, making it unsuitable for fighter aircraft. The Vulcan's mission was quickly followed up by strikes against anti-air installations, flown by British Aerospace Sea Harriers from nearby Royal Navy carriers. Three Vulcan missions were flown against the airfield, a further two missions in which missiles were launched against radar installations; an additional two missions were cancelled. At the time, these missions held {{the record for the}} world's longest-distance raids. The ECM systems on board the Vulcans proved to be effective at jamming Argentine radars; while a Vulcan was within the theatre, other British aircraft in the vicinity had a greatly reduced chance of coming under effective fire.|$|E
5|$|Heathrow is {{the largest}} airport in the country, {{handling}} over 67million terminal passengers in 2006, making it the third busiest airport in the world, and the busiest if measured {{by the number of}} international passengers. Nearly a third of all overseas residents visiting the UK enter the country via this airport, which also handles more than a fifth of all overseas visits by UK residents. Even though there are no dedicated freight services operating out of Heathrow, the practise of transporting cargo in the holds of passenger aircraft means that this airport still accounts {{for more than half of}} all freight handled by UK airports. Gatwick airport, with 34million terminal passengers, is the second largest in the country, eighth busiest in the world for international passenger traffic, and lays claim to the busiest <b>single</b> <b>runway</b> airport in the world. Between them the five London airports handle nearly 137million terminal passengers, 59 per cent of the national total. Stansted and East Midlands airports have both experienced large growth in freight handling over the past decade, and these two airports are the major hubs for express freight operations.|$|E

40|$|Design and {{performance}} of the Wake Vortex Prediction and Monitoring System WSVBS are described. The WSVBS has been developed to tactically increase airport capacity for approach and landing on <b>single</b> <b>runways</b> as well as closely-spaced parallel runways. It is thought to dynamically adjust aircraft separations dependent on weather conditions and the resulting wake vortex behavior without compro-mis>ing safety. Dedicated meteorological instrumentation and short-term numerical terminal weather prediction provide the input {{to the prediction of}} wake-vortex behavior and respective safety areas. LIDAR monitors the correctness of WSVBS predictions in the most critical gates at low altitude. The WSVBS is integrated in the arrival manager AMAN of DLR. Performance tests of the WSVBS have been accomplished at Frankfurt airport in winter 2006 / 07 and at Munich Airport in summer 2010. Aircraft separations for landings on <b>single</b> <b>runways</b> have been compared employing the concepts of either heavy-medium weight class combinations or dynamic pairwise separations where individual aircraft type pairings are considered. For the very conservative baseline setup of the WSVBS the potential capacity gains of dynamic pairwise operations for <b>single</b> <b>runways</b> appear to be very small. On the other hand, the consideration of individual aircraft types and their respective wake characteristics may almost double the fraction of time when radar separation could be applied...|$|R

25|$|Singapore's International Airport at Paya Lebar, Singapore's third main {{civilian}} airport after Seletar Airport (main airport from 1930 to 1937) and Kallang Airport (1937–55) {{opened in}} 1955 with a <b>single</b> <b>runway</b> {{and a small}} passenger terminal. With growth in global aviation transport, the airport was facing congestion problems.

25|$|The airport {{started off}} as Moret Field, an American {{airfield}} that was constructed from a rather poor Japanese airfield {{just north of}} Zamboanga. Construction was started by Philippine Commonwealth troops just after American forces landed at the present location on March 15, 1945. It was improved by a U.S. Army airfield construction unit using considerable Filipino labor. When completed, the <b>single</b> <b>runway</b> was about 4,500 feet long aligned SW to NE. There were two adjacent taxiways along {{both sides of the}} runway with revetment areas. At the peak of operations in 1945, there were about 300 aircraft flying from the airfield. The vast majority were United States Marine Corps aircraft from Marine Aircraft Group 24 which were supporting U.S. Army infantry operations on Mindanao but also ranging down the Sulu area as far as Borneo.|$|E
25|$|Chek Lap Kok Airport was {{designed}} as a replacement for the former Hong Kong International Airport (commonly known as Kai Tak Airport) built in 1925. Located in the densely built-up Kowloon City District with a <b>single</b> <b>runway</b> extending into Kowloon Bay, Kai Tak had only limited room for expansion to cope with steadily increasing air traffic. By the 1990s, Kai Tak had become one of the world's busiest airports – it far exceeded its annual passenger and cargo design capacities, and {{one out of every three}} flights experienced delays, largely due to lack of space for aircraft, gates, and a second runway. In addition, noise mitigation measures restricted nighttime flights, as severe noise pollution (exceeding 105dB(A) in Kowloon City) adversely affected an estimated total of at least 340,000 people.|$|E
25|$|In 1972, the World Bank {{approved}} {{funds for}} further {{expansion of the}} airport, including a new international and domestic passenger terminal building, the airport's first dedicated cargo and freight terminal, new taxiways,associated aprons, internal roads, car parks, police and fire stations, a State Pavilion, airfield androadway lighting, fire hydrant system, water, electrical, telecommunications and sewage systems, a dual carriageway passenger access road, security, drainage and {{the building of the}} main access road to the airport (Airport South Road). The total cost of the project was over US$29 million (US$111.8 million in 2013 dollars). On 14 March 1978, construction of the current terminal building was completed {{on the other side of}} the airport's <b>single</b> <b>runway</b> and opened by President Kenyatta. The airport was again renamed, this time in honour of President Kenyatta after his death about five months later on 22 August 1978.|$|E

25|$|On Kiriwina, {{due to the}} {{difficulty}} of landing heavy engineering equipment the construction of Kiriwina airfield was delayed and with heavy rains hindering construction, General Krueger unhappy with the progress of the works replaced Colonel Herndon in command of Kiriwina Force with Colonel John T. Murray. By 20 July a <b>single</b> <b>runway</b> 1,500 feet (457 m) x 150 feet (46 m) was cleared and roughly graded. By the end of July the runway was 5,000 feet (1524 m) and ready to be surfaced with coral. No. 79 Squadron of the RAAF began operations on 18 August. A seaplane base was also constructed at Losuia, consisting of an anchorage and jetty. A PT boat base was also constructed at Louisa in October 1943, however was closed in February 1944. The island was also used as a supply base.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{there was}} a {{political}} debate regarding {{the site of a}} new airport. Fornebu was one alternative. However, it only had a <b>single</b> <b>runway,</b> which was too small to serve intercontinental flights. It would therefore have to serve in tandem with Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. Other proposals were placing the airport at Hurum, Ås and Hobøl, or building a new airport at Gardermoen. The Norwegian State Railways developed a series of plans for the various airport locations, including the Hurum Line, the Gardermoen Line—which was ultimately built—and branches of the Østfold Line to Hobøl and Ås. The ground transport system was {{a major part of the}} considerations and proposals were made both for motorway and railway access to all the alternatives. As part of its 1986 proposal NSB also launched the concept of a people mover to the airport.|$|E
