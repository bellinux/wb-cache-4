5|$|In August 2016, the MBTA began a $6.1 million {{improvement}} {{project at}} the station. The work includes drainage improvements, <b>sidewalk</b> <b>and</b> cobblestone replacement, stair and elevator repairs, painting of the garage structure to prevent rust, structural repairs to the garage, expansion joint replacement, and platform repairs. It {{is expected to be}} completed by November 2016.|$|E
5|$|Agent Fox Mulder {{arrives at}} the civic center after {{what looks like a}} massacre; bodies lie on the <b>sidewalk</b> <b>and</b> in the foyer. Sheriff Spencer (John Cygan) {{explains}} that the suspect murdered four people from the elevator with his bare hands. His rampage ended when he was shot by a security guard. Spencer notes that seven other individuals have murdered twenty-two people in Franklin in the past six months. Mulder discovers that the LED display in the elevator has been damaged, and that the dead suspect has a green residue on his fingertips.|$|E
5|$|The $4.2 million {{expansion}} {{will expand}} the rail trail parking lot from 70 spaces to 210. Completion {{is scheduled for}} spring 2018. A handicapped-accessible <b>sidewalk</b> <b>and</b> a kiss-and-ride lane / bus loop will be constructed next to the station, with plans for a future pedestrian plaza and restrooms where the USO building was located. The project will not include renovations to make the station handicapped accessible, which would have substantially increased the project cost. However, with the parking issues settled and the accessible entry point in place, Ayer may {{be included in the}} next round of MBTA station overhaul projects.|$|E

25|$|Two {{blocks from}} the crime scene, Officer Don Fouke, {{responding}} to the call, observed a white man, walking along the <b>sidewalk</b> <b>and</b> stepping onto a stairway {{leading up to the}} front yard of one of the homes {{on the north side of}} the street; the encounter lasted only five to ten seconds.|$|E
25|$|The main {{entrance}} uses an arched Gibbs-style surround. The building's trim materials {{show up in}} the form of solid stone balustrades that curl to form newel posts at the <b>sidewalk,</b> <b>and</b> terra cotta quoins. The rear facade is less detailed, with terra cotta used only for the coping of the stepped cornice; stone and brick are used everywhere else.|$|E

They {{accepted}} it as a dare and played the show at Olympia's North Shore Surf club. Guitarist Erin Smith joined in March 1991.|$|E
25|$|As the {{landmark}} {{building in the}} area, the Schuster Building has influenced nearby development. Across the street, a Valvoline outlet was built with brick chosen to match the colors used in the Schuster Building. A large, mixed-use building on the opposite corner, called Highland Station, was designed to resemble the Schuster Building, with storefronts flush with the Bardstown Road <b>sidewalk</b> <b>and</b> an outdoor dining area and green space alongside Eastern Parkway.|$|E

However, the statue is not located in the plaza, but rather on a surrounding <b>sidewalk</b> <b>and</b> facing an entrance to the plaza.|$|E

25|$|Burbank {{has taken}} the {{initiative}} in various anti-smoking ordinances. In late 2010, Burbank passed an ordinance prohibiting smoking in multi-family residences sharing ventilation systems. The rule {{went into effect in}} mid-2011. The new anti-smoking ordinance, which also prohibits smoking on private balconies and patios in multi-family residences, is considered {{the first of its kind}} in California. Since 2007, Burbank has prohibited smoking at all city-owned properties, downtown Burbank, the Chandler Bikeway, and <b>sidewalk</b> <b>and</b> pedestrian areas.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the bomb}} explosion, the entire South Oval was marked as off-limits with crime scene tape. Fans exited the stadium at the {{conclusion}} of the game without incident. The South Oval was open the next afternoon except for the immediate area of the explosion, so a broken glass door could be replaced and firefighters could finish spraying down the area with water to wash debris, chemicals and bodily fluids away from the <b>sidewalk</b> <b>and</b> a bus parked there before the preceding day's game. Classes resumed as normal on Monday.|$|E
25|$|On June 23, 2008, a bus loading {{passengers}} {{was struck}} by an out-of-control dump truck {{at the corner of}} Bowery and Canal Street in New York’s Chinatown. The force of the impact pushed the bus onto the <b>sidewalk</b> <b>and</b> into a bank. As the result of the accident, a sign attached to a light pole fell, injuring a 57-year-old woman; the woman later died {{as the result of a}} heart attack. Several people, including two police officers, were treated for minor injuries. State Department of Transportation inspectors found that the dump truck, owned by CPQ Freight Systems, had eight mechanical issues including faulty brakes which led to the accident.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to larger centers like Sugar House and Downtown, Salt Lake City contains several smaller neighborhoods, each {{named after the}} closest major intersection. Two examples are the 9th and 9th (at the intersection of 900 East and 900 South Streets) and 15th & 15th (at the intersection of 1500 East and 1500 South Streets) neighborhoods. These areas are home to foot-traffic friendly, amenities-based businesses such as art galleries, clothing retail, salons, restaurants and coffee shops. During the summer of 2007, 9th and 9th saw <b>sidewalk</b> <b>and</b> street improvements {{as well as an}} art installation by Troy Pillow of Seattle, Washington inspired by the 9 Muses of Greek myth, thanks in part to a monetary grant from Salt Lake City.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} federal, county, and private {{hospitals}} suffered {{varying degrees of}} damage, with four major facilities in the San Fernando Valley experiencing structural damage, and two of those experiencing collapse. The Indian Hills Medical Center, Foothill Medical Building, and the Pacoima Lutheran Professional building were all heavily damaged, but nursing homes were also affected. One facility in particular, the one-story Foothill Nursing Home, sat very close to {{a section of the}} fault that broke the surface and was raised up three feet relative to the street. Scarps ran along the <b>sidewalk</b> <b>and</b> across the property, but the building was not in use at the time, and remained standing. Though the reinforced concrete block structure was afflicted by the shock and uplift, the relatively good performance was {{in stark contrast to the}} Olive View and Veterans Hospital complexes.|$|E
500|$|Offerman and Mullally {{were allowed}} to improvise a great deal during filming. The episode {{features}} a montage of various clips showing how Ron and Tammy gradually go from fighting {{with each other to}} getting married {{over the course of a}} particularly wild night. Long sequences of footage were shot [...] including Ron and Tammy loudly arguing on the <b>sidewalk</b> <b>and</b> the two making out atop a police car [...] but little more than a few seconds ultimately made the final episode. Offerman said it took about a half hour for the hair department to give him his cornrows haircut. He said he enjoyed the process, saying it [...] "felt like a stiff head massage".|$|E

500|$|From {{the top of}} the American Radiator Building to {{the ground}} in Bryant Park, a drop of 324 feet (98.75 m), Bomar {{completed}} a pass to Hinkey Haines for a record on November 12. Haines caught the ball on the fifth attempt. On Bomar's first attempt, the New York Times reported that the ball [...] "hit the <b>sidewalk</b> <b>and</b> burst" [...] and the third pass knocked Haines over. The stunt took place two days before a game with the Los Angeles Buccaneers. [...] "It was as much as anything a playful jab at Brick Muller" [...] (the Buccaneers' end), who caught a pass thrown from atop the Telephone Building—a drop of 320 feet (97.5 m)—in San Francisco the year before to advertise the first East-West Shrine Game.|$|E
500|$|Cartman and Mysterion both {{refer to}} {{themselves}} as [...] "the symbol this town needs", a line from The Dark Knight, and Cartman encourages Butters to film a video threatening {{to blow up a}} hospital, the same as the Joker from a scene in that film. The opening shot of [...] "The Coon" [...] is also inspired by a sequence from Watchmen: both feature a close-up of a city <b>sidewalk</b> <b>and</b> zoom out to someone looking down from the top of a tall skyscraper. A poster of the Coon shown at Cartman's Coonicon 2009 is inspired by the front cover of The Dark Knight Returns, the Batman graphic novel by Frank Miller. Other common comic book film traits parodied in [...] "The Coon" [...] include costumes that do little to actually conceal secret identities, trophies adorning superhero secret lairs, and sudden disappearing exits and entrances.|$|E
500|$|Mayor Puusemp {{and the new}} Village Board also reorganized the Village Police force, {{appointing}} Richard F. Miniter Chief-of-Police {{and hiring}} a dozen part-time officers {{most of which were}} adult students at the Ulster County Community College’s Criminal Justice Program. [...] One of the tasks assigned Chief Miniter by the Village Board and Mayor Puusemp was the closing of Billy Guldy’s bar the Well. [...] It was a continual source of disruption late at night and the <b>sidewalk</b> <b>and</b> street outside the premises the site of numerous drug and assault arrests. [...] Billy Guldy also seemed to go {{out of his way to}} offend residents for example by having a lifesize caricature of the Virgin Mary painted on the premise’s front wall. [...] However the only body with the power to close the Well was the State Liquor Authority and numerous petitions from Village residents had failed to have it do so.|$|E
