40|$|This {{investigation}} compared attainment in 196, 405 <b>students</b> <b>with</b> {{and without}} disabilities who were taking courses by distance learning with the U. K. Open University in 2009. When the effects of demographic variables were statistically controlled, <b>students</b> <b>with</b> mental health difficulties showed poorer course completion than nondisabled students; <b>students</b> <b>with</b> restricted mobility showed poorer course completion and lower pass rates than nondisabled students; <b>students</b> <b>with</b> unseen or other disabilities showed lower pass rates than nondisabled students; and <b>students</b> <b>with</b> dyslexia or other specific learning difficulties showed lower pass rates and poorer grades than nondisabled students. In addition, the presence of additional disabilities led to poorer attainment in different respects in students who were blind or partially sighted, students who were deaf or hard of hearing, <b>students</b> <b>with</b> impaired speech, and <b>students</b> <b>with</b> unseen disabilities.

No significant differences in social participation were found between <b>students</b> <b>with</b> ASD and <b>students</b> <b>with</b> motor and/or sensory disabilities. status: accepte...|$|R
