25|$|Mercedes Reaves is a {{research}} engineer and scientist. She {{is responsible for the}} design of a viable full-scale <b>solar</b> <b>sail</b> and the development and testing of a scale model <b>solar</b> <b>sail</b> at NASA Langley Research Center. She must select and apply tools to analyze complex thin film structures characterized by wrinkling, geometric and material nonlinear behavior. She is also responsible for planning experimental studies to validate analytical techniques and study solar sails dynamics.|$|E
50|$|<b>Solar</b> <b>sails</b> are pivotally mounted wings, {{capable of}} {{rotation}} on two axes. They can {{function as a}} <b>sail,</b> a <b>solar</b> collector, or both at once. <b>Solar</b> <b>Sails</b> can be hydraulically operated, with both computer optimization and manual control. By rotating to maximise exposure, <b>solar</b> <b>sails</b> can increase ship efficiency by up to 40%.|$|R
40|$|<b>Solar</b> <b>sailing</b> is {{a unique}} and elegant form of {{propulsion}} that transcends reliance on reaction mass. Rather than carrying propellant, <b>solar</b> <b>sails</b> acquire momentum from photons, the quantum packets of energy from which sunlight is composed. In addition, since <b>solar</b> <b>sails</b> are not limited by reaction mass, they can provide continual acceleration, limited only by the lifetime of the sail film in the space environment. Therefore, <b>solar</b> <b>sails</b> can expand the envelope of possible missions, enabling new high-energy mission concepts that are essentially impossible with conventional reaction propulsion, and enhancing current mission concepts by lowering launch mass and reducing trip times...|$|R
40|$|<b>Solar</b> <b>sailing</b> is {{emerging}} as a promising form of advanced spacecraft propulsion, which can enable exciting new space-science mission concepts. By exploiting the momentum transported by <b>solar</b> photons, <b>solar</b> <b>sails</b> can perform high-energy orbit transfer manoeuvres {{without the need for}} reaction mass. Missions such as planetary sample return, multiple small-body rendezvous and fast missions to the outer Solar System can therefore be enabled with the use of only a modest launch vehicle. In addition, new families of highly non-Keplerian orbits have been identified that are unique to <b>solar</b> <b>sails,</b> and can enable new ways of performing space-science missions. While the opportunities presented by <b>solar</b> <b>sailing</b> are appealing, engineering challenges are still to be solved before the technology finally comes to fruition...|$|R

25|$|Electromagnetic {{radiation}} (including visible light, ultraviolet light, {{and radio}} waves) is carried by photons. Even though photons (the particle aspect of light) have no mass, they still carry momentum. This leads to {{applications such as}} the <b>solar</b> <b>sail.</b> The calculation of the momentum of light within dielectric media is somewhat controversial (see Abraham–Minkowski controversy).|$|E
40|$|<b>Solar</b> <b>sails</b> {{are among}} the most studied members of the ultra-lightweight and {{inflatable}} (Gossamer) space structures family due to their potential to provide propellentless propulsion. They are comprised of ultra-thin membrane panels that, to date, have proven very difficult to experimentally characterize and numerically model due to their reflectivity and flexibility, and the effects of gravity sag and air damping. Numerical models must be correlated with experimental measurements of sub-scale <b>solar</b> <b>sails</b> to verify that the models can be scaled up to represent full-sized <b>solar</b> <b>sails.</b> In this paper, the surface shapes of five horizontally supported 25 micron thick aluminized Kapton membranes were measured to a 1. 0 mm resolution using photogrammetry.

25|$|As a {{proof of}} concept, NanoSail-D {{became the first}} {{nanosatellite}} to orbit Earth. There are plans to add them to future Earth orbit satellites, enabling them to de-orbit and burn up once {{they are no longer}} needed.

25|$|Some {{spacecraft}} propulsion {{methods such as}} solar sails provide {{very low}} but inexhaustible thrust; an interplanetary vehicle using one of these methods would follow a rather different trajectory, either constantly thrusting against its direction of motion in order to decrease its distance from the Sun or constantly thrusting along its direction of motion to increase its distance from the Sun. The concept has been successfully tested by the Japanese IKAROS <b>solar</b> <b>sail</b> spacecraft.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{the losses}} of Cosmos 1 and NanoSail-D (which {{were due to}} failure of their launchers), {{scientists}} and engineers around the world remain encouraged and {{continue to work on}} <b>solar</b> <b>sails.</b> While most direct applications created so far intend to use the sails as inexpensive modes of cargo transport, some scientists are investigating the possibility of using <b>solar</b> <b>sails</b> as a means of transporting humans. This goal is strongly related to the management of very large (i.e. well above 1 km2) surfaces in space and the sail making advancements. Manned space flight utilizing <b>solar</b> <b>sails</b> is still in the development state of infancy.|$|R

50|$|<b>Solar</b> <b>sails</b> rely on {{the fact}} that light {{reflected}} from a surface exerts pressure on the surface. The radiation pressure is small and decreases by the square of the distance from the Sun, but unlike rockets, <b>solar</b> <b>sails</b> require no fuel. Although the thrust is small, it continues as long as the Sun shines and the sail is deployed.|$|R
25|$|<b>Solar</b> <b>sail</b> {{missions}} to Sun-like stars can decelerate by radiation pressure in reverse {{dynamics of the}} launch. The sails must be properly oriented at arrival, but orientation control may be avoided using spherical sails. The vehicles must approach the target Sun-like stars at radial distances similar to the launch, about 1 au. After the vehicles are captured in orbit, the microbial capsules may be dispersed in a ring orbiting the star, some within the gravitational capture zone of planets.|$|E
25|$|Japan's {{planetary}} missions have so {{far been}} limited to the inner Solar System, and emphasis {{has been put on}} magnetospheric and atmospheric research. The Mars explorer Nozomi (PLANET-B), which ISAS launched prior to the merger of the three aerospace institutes, became one of the earliest difficulties the newly formed JAXA faced. Nozomi ultimately passed 1,000km from the surface of Mars. On 20 May 2010, the Venus Climate Orbiter Akatsuki (PLANET-C) and IKAROS <b>solar</b> <b>sail</b> demonstrator was launched by a H-2A launch vehicle. On 7 December 2010, Akatsuki was unable to complete its Venus orbit insertion maneuver. Akatsuki finally entered Venus orbit in 7 December 2015, making it the first Japanese spacecraft to orbit another planet, sixteen years after the originally planned orbital insertion of Nozomi. One of Akatsuki's main goal is to uncover the mechanism behind Venus atmosphere's super-rotation, a phenomenon in which the cloud top winds in the toposphere circulates around the planet faster than the speed that Venus itself rotates. A thorough explanation for this phenomenon has yet been found.|$|E

500|$|In 1992, some of Roddenberry's ashes {{were flown}} into space, and {{returned}} to Earth, on the Space Shuttle Columbia mission STS-52.

On May 20, 2002, the spacecraft's orbit deteriorated and it disintegrated in the atmosphere. Another flight to launch more of his ashes into deep space, along with those of Barrett, who died in 2008, was initially planned to take place in 2009. Unlike previous flights, the intention was that this flight would not return to burn up in the Earth's atmosphere. The payload was to include the ashes of James Doohan in addition to the Roddenberrys' and several others and was scheduled to fly in 2016 on the Sunjammer <b>solar</b> <b>sail</b> experiment, but the project was canceled in 2014.
