50|$|Set screws {{appear with}} a variety of tip (point) types. The {{different}} shaped tips have different properties that engineers can utilize. If an engineer were to use a detent to ensure proper nesting of the screw, they might choose to use a cone point type of screw. One might often need to use a flat point when the screw must press perfectly flat against a surface. The most common type is the cup point. This type works well because the surface is rounded so that a small surface area is in contact, but it does not have extremely high stress at one point like that of a cone point. Durability studies show that the cup point offers superior resistance to wear while maintaining a strong grip. Knurled cup points offer the added advantage of a locking action (similar to that of a <b>serrated</b> <b>lock</b> washer) that prevents the screws from working loose in high-vibration applications.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} forms of {{adjustable}} spanners, from the taper locking spanners which needed a hammer to set the movable jaw {{to the size of}} the nut, to the modern screw adjusted spanner. Some adjustable spanners automatically adjust {{to the size of the}} nut. Simpler models use a <b>serrated</b> edge to <b>lock</b> the movable jaw to size, while more sophisticated versions are digital types that use sheets or feelers to set the size.|$|R
