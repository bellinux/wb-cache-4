25|$|In 1868, an {{engineer}} proposed a railroad {{bridge across the}} Hudson River at Poughkeepsie, in a letter published in the Poughkeepsie Eagle newspaper. The proposal <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> absurd that the Eagle ridiculed it, and it was effectively forgotten for a few years.|$|E

25|$|Spanish {{maritime}} intelligence {{knew that a}} convoy of at least twenty Dutch ships from Venice, broker of the Middle East, was always hostile to the Spanish and that the rich convoy had the necessity {{to pass through the}} Gibraltar Strait. All the Dutch ships would go well armed and equipped, and with an appreciable escort, thus capture it or destroy it <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> desirable and appropriate for the Spanish admiralty.|$|E

25|$|The {{origins of}} the {{ceremony}} are said {{to go back to}} the days of Doryū. The legend says that one day, right after the end of a segaki, (a Buddhist service in favor of suffering spirits) a ghostly figure appeared. Having discovered that the segaki was already over, the warrior <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> sad that the priest repeated the ceremony just for him. Afterwards, the man revealed he was the ghost of Kajiwara Kagetoki.|$|E
25|$|Affairs <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> bad in {{the west}} (Maurice, with a whole army was still vainly besieging the single line of low breastworks that {{constituted}} the fortress of Lyme Regis) that the King dispatched Hopton {{to take charge of}} Bristol. Nor were things much better at Oxford. The barriers of time and space, and the supply area had been deliberately given up to the enemy. Charles was practically forced to undertake extensive field operations, with no hope of success, save in consequence of the enemy's mistakes.|$|E
25|$|Coming {{into the}} {{afternoon}} session Bell and Cook played positively, attacking the Australian bowlers. Cook managed to post his half century and soon England {{were starting to}} think about a victory. However, Warne got Bell caught by Langer for a well composed 87. That left England on 170/2 with Paul Collingwood coming in, looking to continue the good work. There was a period where Collingwood <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> intent on staying in, he forgot to score. England went into tea at 170/2, having scored 81 runs for 1 wicket in the session.|$|E

25|$|In 1862 Whymper made further attempts, still {{from the}} south side, on the Lion ridge (or Italian ridge), where the route seemed easier than the Hörnli ridge (the normal route today). On his own he reached above 4,000 metres, but was injured on his way down to Breuil. In July John Tyndall with Johann Joseph Bennen and another guide overcame most of the {{difficulties}} of the ridge that <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> formidable from below and successfully reached the main shoulder; but at a point not very far below the summit they were stopped by a deep cleft that defied their utmost efforts. The Matterhorn remained unclimbed.|$|E
25|$|Nueva Trova, {{initially}} so popular, {{was dealt}} a blow {{by the fall}} of the Soviet Union, though it was already fading. It suffered inside Cuba, perhaps from a growing disenchantment with one-party rule, and externally, from the vivid contrast with the Buena Vista Social Club film and recordings. Audiences round the world have had their eyes opened to the extraordinary charm and musical quality of the older forms of Cuban music. By contrast, topical themes that <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> relevant in the 1960s and 70s now seem dry and passé; once a theme is no longer topical, the piece rests solely on its musical quality. Those pieces of high musical and lyrical quality, amongst which Puebla's Hasta siempre stands out, will probably last as long as Cuba lasts.|$|E
25|$|A {{seemingly}} unrelated {{construction is}} the -function of number theory. This object {{belongs to a}} special class of functions called modular functions, whose graphs form {{a certain kind of}} repeating pattern. Although this function appears in a branch of mathematics which seems very different from the theory of finite groups, the two subjects turn out to be intimately related. In the late 1970s, mathematicians John McKay and John Thompson noticed that certain numbers arising in the analysis of the monster group (namely, the dimensions of its irreducible representations) are related to numbers that appear in a formula for the -function (namely, the coefficients of its Fourier series). This relationship was further developed by John Horton Conway and Simon Norton who called it monstrous moonshine because it <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> far fetched.|$|E

500|$|The {{focus of}} most reviews {{was in the}} climactic final scene, whose {{directing}} and acting is universally acclaimed by critics. Writing for Cultural Learnings, Myles McNutt stated: [...] "the final shot, with Arya looking to the sky as everything goes to silence and all she sees is the birds flying was just wonderfully haunting. Alan Taylor's direction sold both the chaos and the resignation of that moment." [...] HitFix's Alan Sepinwall felt that [...] "that final scene was so gorgeously shot, and the weariness of Bean's performance and the horror of Maisie Williams' so perfectly conveyed the emotions of it, even as things <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> chaotic." ...|$|E
500|$|On the geologically new Galápagos Islands, Darwin {{looked for}} {{evidence}} attaching wildlife {{to an older}} [...] "centre of creation", and found mockingbirds allied to those in Chile but differing from island to island.

In Australia, the marsupial rat-kangaroo and the platypus <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> unusual that Darwin thought it was almost as though two distinct Creators had been at work. He found the Aborigines [...] "good-humoured & pleasant", and noted their depletion by European settlement.|$|E

Gerrick Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times {{praised the}} episode and was particularly {{excited by the}} guest appearance by Jane Leeves. She called the subplot between Gaby and Susan was [...] "cute, but honest", but felt the Orson and Katherine characters have [...] "run their course". Entertainment Weekly writer Tanner Stransky declared the reappearance of Katherine Mayfair was the only interesting element of the episode, {{and that it was}} touching to see her realize the damage she had done. Stransky wrote, [...] "The rest of the story lines from last night just kind of sat there rather limply," [...] and said the Orson and Bree story, and Tom and Lynette's therapy, [...] "just <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> dumpy for this once-sexy show".|$|E

500|$|Frank's Cock won several awards at {{domestic}} and international film festivals. At the 1994 TIFF it won the NFB–John Spotton Award, given for the best Canadian short film. The jury cited Frank's Cock for its [...] "evocative images,... impeccable writing and mise-en-scène,... moving depiction of the universal human experiences of love and loss {{in the age of}} AIDS, and especially for its success in shaking our preconceptions". The selection included C$2,500 in prize money and a further C$2,500 worth of film processing. When accepting the award, Hoolboom quipped [...] "Frank's Cock has never <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> large"; Waugh, however, suggests that the title [...] "caused more embarrassment than mirth" [...] when it was read during the citation. Special citations were also read for Andrew Munger's Make Some Noise and Philip Hoffman's Technilogic Ordering.|$|E
500|$|These critiques {{were not}} taken seriously by AI researchers, often because they <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> {{far off the}} point. Problems like intractability and commonsense {{knowledge}} seemed much more immediate and serious. It was unclear what difference [...] "know how" [...] or [...] "intentionality" [...] made to an actual computer program. Minsky said of Dreyfus and Searle [...] "they misunderstand, and should be ignored." [...] Dreyfus, who taught at MIT, was given a cold shoulder: he later said that AI researchers [...] "dared not be seen having lunch with me." [...] Joseph Weizenbaum, the author of ELIZA, felt his colleagues' treatment of Dreyfus was unprofessional and childish. Although he was {{an outspoken critic of}} Dreyfus' positions, he [...] "deliberately made it plain that theirs was not the way to treat a human being." ...|$|E

The main focus of their enthusiasm lay in the regularity of elections and in the alternation of parties in power. The government scrupulously observed the Constitution, individual rights seemed protected, and no military leader or other dictator overthrew the elected government." [...] The Brazilian historian Pedro Calmon in his work covering Brazilian history asserted that during PedroII's reign the [...] "politics became British–like, and were improved, creating processes which began to function under the vigilant eyes of the emperor", and which allowed [...] "the evolution of democracy in Brazil".|$|E
