40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to give insights into the production, income and environmental effects of the introduction of a flat rate for Dutch agriculture that is lower than the present average direct income payment. For this purpose, a detailed agri-environmental programming model for Dutch agriculture is used. Results of a flat rate scenario are compared to a reference scenario comparing agricultural production in the Netherlands in 2020 in a situation without a flat rate. Results show that total gross margin in Dutch agriculture decreases because of the flat rate with 7 %. The supply of <b>starch</b> <b>potatoes</b> and cow milk decreases most. Production of seed and consumption potatoes, vegetables and intensive livestock products increases slightly. This is largely due to a shift of farm payments from milk and <b>starch</b> <b>potatoes</b> production to arable crops and vegetable production. It was found that including risk aversion of income volatility amplifies these effects. In the flat rate scenario total emissions of nutrients from agricultural production to the environment decreases...|$|E

We hypothesize that a measurement of canopy reflectance provides information which can be used to adjust sidedressNrate. The objective of our work was to develop and test a canopy reflectance-based Nsidedress system for potato in humid climates. In four years of experiments with ware potato on a sandy soil it was determined that the reflectance index WDVI correlates well with N uptake, that sidedressN should be applied at around the time of canopy closing, and that the sidedressNrate should be calculated as the difference between a (fixed) desired N uptake and a reflectance-based measurement of N uptake. The calculated N saving in these experiments was between 10 and 109 (average 56) kg N ha- 1. The reflectance-based Nsidedress system was tested at an additional two locations, with ware potatoes on a loamy soil and with <b>starch</b> <b>potatoes</b> on a sandy soil, in two further years of experiments. N saving in these experiments was between 8 and 88 (average 44) kg N ha- 1.

40|$|Coming {{to grips}} with the {{challenges}} posed by globalization will absolutely necessary if the Japanese economy is to be revitalized. Currently, Japan is involved in negotiations to join the TPP (Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement), which would serve as an essential vehicle for this encounter. Beyond the elimination of border protection such as tariffs, the TPP is seeking to develop common rules and institutional harmonization to improve productivity in its member countries. Agriculture is, however, considered to be a stumbling block in these TPP negotiations, because tariffs on agricultural products are still maintained at a very high rate in Japan. It is said that, unless structuralchanges are initiated, the elimination of these tariffs in their entirety would seriously damage Japanese agriculture, particularly in Hokkaido. On the other hand, Japanese domestic agricultural production is declining and the introduction of structural reform is inevitable, regardless of TPP membership. In addition, external pressures for globalizing agriculture come not only from the TPP, but will continue to come from other sources as long as Japan maintains its high tariffs on agricultural imports. This article examines the possibility of making adjustments in Hokkaido agriculture to cope with globalization, particularly under a TPP trade regime, and focuses on upland farming crops such as wheat, soybeans, sugar beets, and <b>starch</b> <b>potatoes.</b> First, the movements of and the conditions for these products in global as well as domestic markets are discussed. Next, the policies regarding these four products are examined in terms of PSE (Producer Support Estimates).

40|$|The Cool Farm Tool – Potato (CFT-Potato) is a {{spreadsheet}} program {{that allows the}} calculation {{of the amount of}} CO 2 equivalents that it costs to produce one ton of potato. The spreadsheet was adapted from an original generic version of the tool, and completed for potato production in diverse production areas in the world applying different levels of technology. The CO 2 embedded in chemicals in their production and released from the soil after nitrogen fertilization in the CFT-Potato have been updated to consider more recent products and production methods. Energy costs of the operations in the original version taken from generic data provided by the American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers Standard, however, were altered (usually increased) where there was evidence from practical sources that the original figures did not apply. For example the figure of around 16 liters per hectare for potato harvesting in the original version was corrected to 60 liters per hectare based on observational data. Figures for typical potato operations such as windrowing were supplied. Irrigation with pumps powered by diesel or electricity from the grid, with a center pivot, a rain gun, drip irrigation and flooding and energy cost for extracting water from deeper sources were also added. We added data for grading, washing, store loading and unloading, the application of a sprout suppressant and storage with ventilation of ambient air or forged refrigeration. The CFT-Potato can be used by growers to calculate the actual costs of one ton of potato in terms of kg CO 2 and explore the repercussion of altered management options. Here the comparison of four potato production systems in the Netherlands is shown: seed potatoes (115 kg of CO 2 /t), table potatoes (77), <b>starch</b> <b>potatoes</b> (71) and organic potato (82).

40|$|The starch {{of potato}} (Solanum tuberosum L.) tubers is a {{renewable}} resource {{and an important}} component of multiple food and non-food products. Optimized starch yield, the product of tuber starch content and tuber yield, is therefore the central selection criterion in breeding programs for <b>starch</b> <b>potatoes.</b> The aim of this work was the detection of diagnostic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers for starch yield optimization by marker-assisted selection. A novel association mapping population of 282 potato genotypes formed the basis of this thesis. Within a collaborative project with breeders, this population was assembled and phenotyped in replicated field trials in Northern Spain for the starch yield determining traits tuber starch content, tuber yield, weight and number. The population was genotyped for known diagnostic PCR markers, SSR markers and novel SNPs in candidate genes, which were reported in the literature to have a function in starch or yield accumulation in potato or other organisms. In addition, three subpopulations were selected based on the highest (cases) and lowest (controls) trait values for tuber starch content, tuber yield and starch yield. Ninety varieties and breeding clones in total were genome-wide genotyped for 8, 303 SNPs using the SolCAP Potato Array. SNPs with highly significantly different allele frequency between the case-control subpopulations for each trait were selected and genotyped in the entire population. Furthermore, the same case-control subpopulations were genotyped with next-generation RAD sequencing. Highly significant SNPs differing between cases and controls were analyzed for effects on the protein sequence and location in previously known candidate genes. Using a mixed linear model including population structure and kinship for association analysis, 21 diagnostic SNP markers and one insertion-deletion polymorphism were identified in candidate genes for tuber starch and yield-related traits. These associations resulted from the targeted candidate gene approach {{as well as from the}} genome wide case-control study by SolCAP Potato Array genotyping. A set of 430 novel and non-obvious candidate loci for tuber starch content, yield and starch yield was obtained from the RAD sequencing approach. Nine loci were detected in both genome-wide genotyping methods and are of special interest for further analysis. All three applied concepts resulted in the detection of novel marker-trait associations and candidate genes.

40|$|The European Commission's {{proposed}} {{regulations for}} further {{reform of the}} cereals, rice, dried fodder, and dairy sectors have been published. The regulations cover: direct aid schemes; support for rural development; the common organisation {{of the market in}} cereals; the common organisation of the market in rice; the common organisation of the market in dried fodder; the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products; the levy on milk and milk products. In addition to reiterating the general concept behind the process of CAP reform, the explanatory memorandum sets out the impact of the proposed reforms. The Commission claims that the 'adjustments proposed will complement the EU's international objective of ensuring that developing countries fully benefit from the expansion of world trade, while maintaining food security'. This will be achieved through reducing export availability, 'thereby contributing to stronger world market prices, which {{is in the interest of}} the agricultural sector in developing countries'. The reform process will also 'provide a sustainable and predictable policy framework for the European Model of Agriculture'. The Commission also emphasises that the reform process will require additional budgetary expenditures since farmers' incomes will need to be maintained. With regard to individual products the cereals-sector proposal would result in: a 5 % reduction in the cereals intervention price to € 95. 30 /tonnee from 2004 / 05; the abolition of seasonal corrections; and the end of intervention for rye. Area payments will be increased from € 63 to € 66 /tonne with these payments being included in the single farm payment. For protein crops the current support payment will be maintained and converted into a crop specific area payment of € 55. 57 /ha. For rice a one-step reduction in the intervention price by 50 % to an effective support price of € 150 /tonne, in line with world prices, is proposed, with direct aid being increased from € 52 /tonnee to € 177 /tonne. € 102 of this will be part of the single-farm payment, paid on the basis of historical rights, while € 75 /tonne multiplied by a specified yield will be paid as crop-specific aid. A private storage scheme will be introduced, to be triggered when the market price falls below the effective support price. In addition special measures will be triggered when market prices fall below € 120 /tonne. Proposals are also put forward for durum wheat, dairy products, <b>starch,</b> <b>potatoes,</b> dried fodder, seeds and nuts. Against this background a single farm payment will replace most of the premia under different common organisations of the market. This will cover arable crops, beef and veal, milk and dairy, sheep and goats, <b>starch</b> <b>potatoes,</b> grain legumes, rice, seeds, dried fodder. As the Commission explains it 'this single farm payment will be broken down into payment entitlements in order to facilitate their transfer. Each entitlement will be calculated by dividing the reference amount by the number of hectares, which gave rise to this amount in the reference years'. The new payment system will be linked to cross compliance with EU standards in the fields of environment, food safety, animal health and welfare and occupational safety. Accompanying these measures the EU will strengthen the rural-development pillar of the CAP. Comment: The development of the most immediate significance to the ACP concerns the rice sector, where the reduction in the EU price is likely to lead to dramatic income losses for Guyana and Surinam. According to the FAPRI study (see last edition) rice-sector reform will also lead to a 20 % expansion in EU rice production, despite an estimated 41 % decline in the EU market price of rice. With such an increase in production, EU exports are likely to rise substantially. These predicted developments sit uneasily with the European Commission's assertion that reform will reduce export availability. The sustainability of the European Model of Agriculture will be achieved by reducing the attractiveness of the EU market to below that of the world market, thereby doing away with the need for both tariff protection and export refunds. It should be noted that when the European Commission asserts a reduction in production as a result of reform, this is in comparison with production levels which would have been attained without the introduction of reform and is not with reference to current production levels. With reference to current production levels, The FAPRI study suggests that post reform production levels will be higher in all major products except barley and beef. It should be borne in mind that with the budgetary ceiling fixed, further reform is likely to be more difficult to secure agreement on, since new expenditures will need to be financed from saving elsewhere in the CAP budget. This will require hard negotiations in the EU Council and this could well slow down the pace of reform, particularly if the US$/euro exchange rate makes export refunds more expensive.

40|$|Living {{positively}} with HIV Cue: HIV/AIDS is making many farmers look afresh {{at what they}} need to grow to provide a healthy diet. It?s certainly happening in Kenya. I?d like to introduce you to a man who is practicing what he preaches. His name is Cephas Kojwang, Co-ordinator for the National Empowerment Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS. He is himself HIV positive and tends a highly productive backyard plot that provides him with a healthy diet. But as he explained to Eric Kadenge, farmers are not just having to recognise the nutritional value of the conventional crops - they are taking a fresh look at wild plants too. Muchicha, otherwise known as Amaranthas, is a common weed in East Africa. But it is a weed with a lot to offer. IN:	?Take for example the? OUT:	?the better for you. ? DUR?N:	 4 ? 31 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: That was Cephas Kojwang from Kenya. He talked about what he has in his garden ? and how it hopes him to cope with the HIV/AIDS illness. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Kojwang	Take for example the plant that you call Muchicha which grows in the wild in people?s farms produces seeds in its maturity. The seeds if they are dried and ground into flour is very, very rich, it can be mixed with a little maize or a little sorghum or use as it is to produce very, very nutritious meal. It is known to boost immunity, it is known to contain more than just the protein you need and the starch you need, it contains much more. All those things that sprout during the rains and are deep green in nature, those greens have more nutritious value. Kadenge	You have mentioned a lot about vitamin providing foods how about protein and starches, what are the simple cheap sources of such foods? Kojwang	I?ll give you the most common, talking about starch, banana has starch, cassava has <b>starch,</b> <b>potatoes</b> have starch, whatever potato it is, Irish or sweet. You have cassava growing in the most arid parts of this country and you have sweet potatoes growing in highland or lowland areas and Irish potatoes also growing mainly in the highlands, those are very rich sources of starch, maize. At the same time when we are talking about vitamins we encourage that people eat fruit and vegetables that contain a lot of vitamins. People should not look down upon some fruit as being inferior. Take for example the guava - {{that has a lot of}} vitamin C. There are wild berries that are edible that you do not need to buy. The lemon tree, the lemon tree grows almost everywhere in the country. Even if you threw a seed behind your backyard it would grow into a tree and produce fruit. The pawpaw plant takes a very short time to grow and papaya is known to be very nutritious. The leaves alone can be used as food, the pulp that we eat as fruit does not just have water it is 80 % water but beyond the water it has got quite a lot of minerals in it. Kadenge	Give me a few more other foods other than maize that fall into the cereal category that can be eaten to provide carbohydrates? Kojwang	The moment you are chewing sugarcane you are actually eating energy. Steer clear of the white maize meal I would rather ask for the brown ugali or what people call black ugali because I know that over and above containing carbohydrates it has iron. My body needs iron to produce red blood cells. Eat your maize but for heavens sake if you have a lot of maize why do you not sell some and also buy sorghum, that mixture makes sense. How about cassava which can grow in literally most parts of the country? Far from the belief that cassava is for the poor, God created cassava with a purpose, it can grow virtually everywhere and there are places where cassava has been cut into pieces and dried and ground into flour. There are people who make cassava chapattis so they do not have to grow wheat. We even have cassava chips, you can do crisps from virtually any of those carbohydrate producing foods like you can have crisps made from bananas and there are types of bananas that are fairly drought tolerant, they are best at making crisps that can be dried and stored and eaten later. Kadenge	Do you have a garden and if you do what are some of the crops that you actually grow there and use them on a daily basis? Kojwang	I have a garden, I have kales, I have spinach, I have onions and I am lucky that I live in a place which is fast growing, you know fast being populated and being developed but I still have space. So I have a few bananas, I also grow sorghum which does very well. People did not even know what it was when I said I was growing sorghum around Kitangela they were asking me, what are these? Also we have tried maize, the variety that grows in dry areas, the short term maize and so I try my hand at several things. I even tried peanuts. I have pawpaw and I have grafted oranges also. We have one guava plant. The more natural the food stuff that you eat the better for you. End of track. One man?s story of life with the viru...|$|E

This study examines the properties of modified starch gels produced by further enhancing the <b>starch</b> functions of <b>potato</b> <b>starch.</b> To study the primary properties of starch gels, color tone tests, viscosity measurements, and texture measurements were performed. Acetylated distarch phosphate gel had the highest values, followed byhydroxypropyl distarch phosphate gel,starch acetate gel,and <b>potato</b> <b>starch</b> gel. As for the degree of viscosity, hydroxypropyl distarch phosphate gel was the thickest,followed by acetylated distarch phosphate gel,potato starch gel,and starch acetate gel. In this experiment, changes in the properties of modified starch gels were observed as compared with those of <b>potato</b> <b>starch</b> gel. In the future,we would like to compare various types of modified starch and the effects of being frozen or defrosted on starch properties...|$|R
40|$|The study {{investigated}} the effect of starch sources, screw configuration, and steam injection on physical quality of extruded fish feed. Pellet durability, water stability and hardness were measured and analyzed. Four <b>starch</b> sources; pregelatinized <b>potato</b> <b>starch,</b> <b>potato</b> <b>starch,</b> whole wheat and wheat starch {{were used in the}} production of extruded fish feed. Three screw configuration types; polygon- 2 L, polygon-LR, and LRLR were used during production of feed. Similarly, steam injection and no steam injection in barrel were used for the production of the extruded fish feed. Contrast, brightness and entropy were used to analyze differences in color. Four diets; Pregelatinized <b>potato</b> <b>starch,</b> <b>potato</b> <b>starch,</b> whole wheat and wheat starch showed varied results. In general, <b>potato</b> <b>starch</b> diets gave the highest pellet durability, hardness and water stability than the wheat <b>starch</b> diets. Pregelatinized <b>potato</b> gave highest pellet durability and water stability. Hardness (length, width and breaking force) was also higher for pregelatinized <b>potato</b> <b>starch.</b> <b>Potato</b> <b>starch</b> gave the highest hardness. Screw configuration LRLR gave the highest pellet durability and Polygon-LR had the lowest. Screw configuration Polygon- 2 L and LRLR gave higher breaking force than Polygon-LR. There was no difference in the effect of screw configuration on length and diameter. No steam injection in the barrel gave a higher pellet durability and water stability. Steam pressure did not affect length, diameter and breaking force of the pellet. Wheat diets gave brighter pellets than the <b>potato</b> <b>starch</b> diet, indicating that extent of maillard and caremelization differed for different diet compositions. Screw configuration and steam pressure did not show significant effect on contrast and entropy of the picture. Whole wheat gave lowest contrast and highest entropy. Wheat starch gave highest contrast and lowest entropy. Overall results indicated that starch source and processing parameters affected physical quality of pellets. Color analysis showed that starch sources used in feed production had influenced color development during extrusion, indicating possible nonenzymatic browning of the feed...|$|R
40|$|In {{the words}} of the European Commission, the June 26 th 2003 {{agreement}} on CAP reform will mean that 'in future, the vast majority of subsidies will be paid independently from the volume of production'. However 'member states may choose to maintain a limited link between subsidy and production under well-defined conditions and within clear limits'. The single farm payment system will enter into force in 2005. However, member states may get a special dispensation to apply it only from 2007. The key elements of the reform package as agreed are:  a single farm payment for EU farmers, independent from production; limited coupled elements may be maintained to avoid abandonment of production; this payment will be linked to respect for environmental, food-safety, animal and plant health and animal-welfare standards, as well as the requirement to keep all farmland in good agricultural and environmental condition ('cross compliance'); a strengthened rural-development policy with more EU money, new measures to promote the quality of the environment and animal welfare, and to help farmers to meet EU production standards starting in 2005; a reduction in direct payments ('modulation') for bigger farms to finance the new rural development policy; a mechanism for financial discipline to ensure that the farm budget fixed until 2013 is not overshot; revisions to the market policy of the CAP involving: asymmetric price cuts in the milk sector; reduction of the monthly increments in the cereals sector by half, (the current intervention price will be maintained);  reforms in the rice, durum wheat, nuts, <b>starch</b> <b>potatoes</b> and dried fodder sectors. The Commission press release provides a detailed summary of how the various reforms will be implemented. This includes an outline of the modifications made to the Commission's original proposals with regard to the single farm payment scheme, where member states can be allowed to maintain up to 25 % of current hectare payments in the arable sector linked to production if this maintains land in production. Alternatively 40 % of the supplementary durum wheat premium may continue to be linked to production. Unlike the Commission's initial proposal there will be no reduction in cereals intervention prices, although the existing seasonal correction payments will be reduced by 50 %. A supplement for durum wheat in traditional durum wheat farming areas will be paid independently of production for which member states may decide to retain 40 % linked to production. A quality premium for durum wheat used in pasta and semolina production to farmers in traditional zones will also be paid. A one-step reduction in the price of rice of 50 % was agreed. This will bring the EU price (€ 150 /tonne) into line with the world market price. Current direct aid payments will be increased from € 25 /tonne to € 177 /tonne. Of this € 102 /tonne {{will be part of the}} single farm aid payment, based on historical rights, while the remainder (€ 75 /tonne) will be paid as a crop-specific aid. Intervention buying will be triggered should market prices fall to € 150 per tonne, with a ceiling of 75, 000 tonnes being set for intervention buying. New tariff items are to be created to accommodate the new rice regime. With regard to the beef sector, member states may decide to retain up to a 100 % of the suckler cow premium and over 40 % of the slaughter premium as a production-linked payment, or 100 % of the slaughter premium or 75 % of the special male premium. In addition for sheep and goats, a maximum of 50 % of the premium can remain linked to production, while drying aid for cereals in the outermost regions of the EU may remain linked to production. The dairy sector will only be incorporated into the single farm payment from 2008 when the process of reform has been fully implemented. The reformed dairy quota regime will remain in place until 2014 / 15. The intervention prices for butter will decrease by 25 % over four years which is an additional price cut of 10 % compared to those agreed in 2000. There will be a reduction in skimmed milk powder prices of 15 % over three years in line with the Agenda 2000 agreement. Intervention buying for butter will be suspended above a limit of 70, 000 tonnes in 2004, with this declining to 30, 000 tonnes by 2007. Compensation payments will rise from € 11. 81 per tonne in 2004 to € 23. 65 in 2005 and € 35. 5 per tonne in 2006. In addition member states may make additional payments equivalent to 10 % of the sum of the single farm aid payment to encourage specific types of farming. With regard to funds generated by 'modulation' (that is the progressive reduction of payments to larger farms) 1 % will remain in the member states where the money is raised. The remainder will be allocated to member states according to: agricultural area; agricultural employment; GDP per capita, purchasing power. This being said every member state will receive at least 80 % of the funds generated from modulation in its territory. Proposals for reform of the olive oil, tobacco and cotton regimes will be tabled in autumn 2003. Comment: The prior implementation of reform in the dairy sector, involving substantial price reductions, in advance of incorporation into the single farm payment scheme, gives an indication of the likely trajectory for reform in the sugar sector, a sector of vital importance to a number of ACP economies. The impact this will have on the value of ACP sugar preferences (quite independent of the outcome of the Brazilian and Australian WTO challenge to the EU's 'C' export arrangements) will need to be taken into account in the on-going EPA negotiations; possibly through the negotiation of 'compensatory trade measures' explicitly linked to the erosion of the value of trade preferences as a result of the implementation of CAP reform. In the rice sector the compromise reform includes a specific reference to traditional rice suppliers stating 'the Commission will also take into account the interests of developing countries, including those traditional suppliers, as well as the implementation of the EBA regulation', it remains to be seen what this will mean in practice for traditional ACP suppliers such as Surinam and Guyana. The major change with regard to modulation which keeps the vast majority of these funds for deployment in support of rural development means that there will be little scope created for the financing of further reform. This could serve to defer substantive reform of the EU sugar regime. In {{the words of}} the European Commission, the June 26 th 2003 agreement on CAP [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effect of wheat flour ratio with <b>potato</b> <b>starch</b> and particle size of <b>potato</b> <b>starch</b> to the characteristics of brownies steamed. The experimental model used in brownies research was Randomized Block Design with 2 (two) factors, performed with 3 (three) replications, so that 27 experimental units were obtained.

40|$|Soil {{compaction}} due {{to heavy}} machinery and intensive cultivation causing yield reduction in potato {{is an increasing}} problem worldwide today. In this experiment inter-row subsoiling at the depth of 55 cm has been tested as a strategy to loosen the soil after planting and thereby increase the yield in <b>starch</b> <b>potato</b> production. The effects of subsoiling were tested in three different irrigation regimes. The results show that subsoiling can increase the <b>starch</b> <b>potato</b> yield significantly in sandy soils where a compacted plough pan is present. This holds true for all years and all cultivars tested. The effect was greater in dry years and decreased with increasing irrigation intensity. However, the starch content of the tubers was not affected by subsoiling but the total starch yield from the field increased with 0. 86 ton/ha to 1. 37 ton/ha, depending on year, cultivar and irrigation strategy...|$|R
40|$|Two growth {{trials were}} {{conducted}} to compare the effectiveness of replacing either corn or lactose with modified <b>potato</b> <b>starches</b> in diets for conventionally and early-weaned pigs. In Exp. 1, 198 pigs (initially 9. 4 lb and 19 d of age) {{were used to determine}} if modified <b>potato</b> <b>starch</b> (<b>potato</b> <b>starch</b> 1) can replace a portion of the lactose in a high nutrient dense diet. Pigs were allotted by weight, gender, and ancestry to each of six dietary treatments with either five or six pigs per pen and six pens per treatment. The control diet contained 10 % dried whey (7. 2 % lactose), 7. 5 % spray-dried porcine plasma, 2. 5 % select menhaden fish meal, and 1. 75 % spray-dried blood meal. Additional treatments were formulated by adding 7 or 14 % modified <b>potato</b> <b>starch</b> or lactose in place of com. A positive control diet also was formulated containing 29 % dried whey (providing the same amount of lactose as the 10 % dried whey plus 14 % lactose diet). All diets were formulated to contain 1. 5 % lysine, and. 90 % Ca,. 80 % P, and 17. 88 % soybean meal and were fed in a meal form. From day 0 to 14 postweaning, increasing dietary lactose tended to linearly improve ADG and ADFI. Added <b>potato</b> <b>starch</b> did not improve ADG compared with pigs fed the control diet, but ADFI increased linearly with increasing <b>potato</b> <b>starch.</b> In Exp. 2, 180 pigs (8. 5 lb and 14 d of age) were used to evaluate the effects of two modified <b>potato</b> <b>starches</b> (<b>potato</b> <b>starch</b> 1 or <b>potato</b> <b>starch</b> 2,a further hydrolyzed <b>potato</b> <b>starch</b> with a greater percentage of sugars as either glucose or maltose as a replacement for either com or lactose in a segregated early-weaning diet (SEW). Pigs were fed a control diet containing 15 % dried whey, 12 % added lactose, 6 % porcine plasma, and 6 % select menhaden fish meal. Modified <b>potato</b> <b>starch</b> 1 or 2 (12 %) replaced either corn or the added lactose on an equal weight basis. From d 0 to 7 postweaning, pigs fed the modified <b>potato</b> <b>starch</b> 1 had greater ADG and ADFI than those fed modified <b>potato</b> <b>starch</b> 2. Pigs fed diets with either starch substituted for corn had greater ADG than those fed diets with either starch substituted for lactose. From d 0 to 14 and d o to 21, pigs fed diets containing either modified <b>potato</b> <b>starch</b> substituted for corn tended to have greater ADG than those fed the control diet. This appeared {{to be the result of}} greater feed intake of pigs fed the diets containing either starch substituted for corn compared with those fed the control diet or diets containing either starch substituted for lactose. Pigs fed diets with either modified starch substituted for lactose had similar ADG as those fed the control diet. In conclusion, these results suggest that <b>potato</b> <b>starch</b> can improve growth performance of pigs when substituted for corn and can replace a portion of the lactose in an SEW diet without adversely affecting performance...|$|R
