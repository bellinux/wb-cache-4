50|$|Therefore, the {{coupling}} constant is a dynamical variable in string theory, unlike {{the case of}} quantum field theory where it is constant. As long as supersymmetry is unbroken, such <b>scalar</b> <b>fields</b> can take arbitrary values (they are moduli). However, supersymmetry breaking usually creates a potential energy for the <b>scalar</b> <b>fields</b> and the <b>scalar</b> <b>fields</b> localize near a minimum whose position should in principle be calculable in string theory.|$|R
25|$|Given a bounded {{sequence}} a in ℓ∞(N), {{there exists}} a closed ball B that contains {{the image of a}} (B is a subset of the <b>scalar</b> <b>field).</b> a is then a function from N to B. Since N is discrete and B is compact and Hausdorff, a is continuous. According to the universal property, {{there exists a}} unique extension βa: βN → B. This extension does not depend on the ball B we consider.|$|E
25|$|A surface {{integral}} {{is a definite}} integral taken over a surface (which may be a curved set in space); it {{can be thought of}} as the double integral analog of the line integral. The function to be integrated may be a <b>scalar</b> <b>field</b> or a vector field. The value of the {{surface integral}} is the sum of the field at all points on the surface. This can be achieved by splitting the surface into surface elements, which provide the partitioning for Riemann sums.|$|E
25|$|The {{denominator}} in this {{expression is}} called the partition function, and the integral over all possible values of H is a statistical path integral. It integrates exp(βF) over all values of H, over all the long wavelength fourier components of the spins. F is a Euclidean Lagrangian for the field H, {{the only difference between}} this and the quantum field theory of a <b>scalar</b> <b>field</b> being that all the derivative terms enter with a positive sign, and there is no overall factor of i.|$|E
