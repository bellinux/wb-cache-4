The site, which appeared to be dedicated to honey sales and beekeeping, was covered in confusing random characters and sentence fragments. Dana, the ostensible webmaster of the ilovebees site, created a weblog stating that <b>something</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> wrong with her website, and the site itself had been hacked. Suspecting {{that this was a}} mystery that could be unraveled, Halo and ARG fans spread the link and began to work on figuring out what was going on.|$|E

And I felt strongly that he had some sort of magical background– he'd been dabbling in magic, and <b>something</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> badly wrong." [...] She had also recently reread J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings and afterward was inspired to [...] " [...] writing a novel of magic and fantasy".|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{the lack}} of {{financial}} backing and grants, Mower {{and his team of}} physicians developed a working AICD by 1980. Dr. Levi Watkins, Jr. implanted the first AICD in a human patient in February 1980. At the time of the implantation, Mirowski and Mower had demonstrated that the device was effective in canines. The operating room at Johns Hopkins Hospital in which the first operation took place was crowded with onlookers. Mower recalled, “It was the talk of the whole hospital that these crazy guys are going to put in an automatic defibrillator. If <b>something</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> awry, we would have never lived it down.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Wilder was {{dissatisfied}} with the theatre of his time: [...] "I felt that <b>something</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> wrong....I began {{to feel that the}} theatre was not only inadequate, it was evasive." [...] His response was to use a metatheatrical style. Our Towns narrator, the Stage Manager, is completely aware of his relationship with the audience, leaving him free to break the fourth wall and address them directly. According to the script, the play is to be performed with little scenery, no set and minimal props. The characters mime the objects with which they interact. Their surroundings are created only with chairs, tables, staircases, and ladders. For example, the scene in which Emily helps George with his evening homework, conversing through upstairs windows, is performed with the two actors standing atop separate ladders to represent their neighboring houses. Wilder once said: [...] "Our claim, our hope, our despair are in the mind—not in things, not in 'scenery.' [...] " ...|$|E

2500|$|Salli Frattini, the {{executive}} producer for MTV who had planned the entire performance, recalled {{a phone call from}} the officiating booth that was her first indication <b>something</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> wrong. Frattini was in a truck outside of Reliant Stadium celebrating the end of the 12-minute halftime performance, which they initially thought was a success. [...] "We were like, 'Uh, we’re playing that back right now'", Frattini said. [...] "There was lots of chaos in the truck, and we played it back and we were like, 'Oh, s. What just happened?'" [...] Alex Coletti, another MTV producer, said he could not find Jackson after the performance. [...] "I tried to get in touch to make sure she was okay", he said. [...] "Her entire camp stopped answering the phones. I finally got to her tour manager, and they were already at the airport." [...] Coletti assumed the singer was so mortified that she fled immediately, though later assumed the incident was a possible [...] "set up", adding it was the last time he had spoken to her. Coletti's assumption is potentially another reason for Jackson's blacklisting on MTV in addition to other music channels and radio formats. An MTV representative confirmed the costume tear was conceptualized by the MTV staff, in which the show's producers mockingly ripped their clothing in response to Timberlake's closing lyric during rehearsals. This led to Jackson and Timberlake improvising the move, in which Timberlake tore off Jackson's kilt. Frattini stated, [...] "When we did the original rehearsal, there was conversation about a fake skirt she would wear, and that Justin would actually pull open the skirt and take off the skirt. In rehearsal, they actually tried to rip open the skirt, which kind of went with the lyrics of the song". The production team then discussed another option, which led to the costume tearing, although the outfit was intended to stay in place.|$|E
