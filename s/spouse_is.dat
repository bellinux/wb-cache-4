5|$|When {{the goddess}} is at last placated, the {{retrieving}} god escorts {{her back to}} Egypt. Her return {{marks the beginning of}} the inundation and the new year. The pacified Eye deity is once more a procreative consort for the sun god, or, in some versions of the story, for the god who brings her back. Mehit becomes the consort of Anhur, Tefnut is paired with Shu, and Thoth's <b>spouse</b> <b>is</b> sometimes Nehemtawy, a minor goddess associated with this pacified form of the Eye. In many cases, the Eye goddess and her consort then produce a divine child who becomes the new sun god. The goddess' transformation from hostile to peaceful is a key step in the renewal of the sun god and the kingship that he represents.|$|E

25|$|A {{charitable}} {{view of the}} Japanese {{system of}} divorce is that it favors a ‘clean break’ so that the divorced parties have little or nothing {{more to do with}} each other after the divorce. A less generous interpretation is that it permits the spouse with economic assets (usually the husband) to keep most of his assets, avoid payment of alimony and provide little or no child support, but the price he pays is the abandonment of any relationship with his children, while the other <b>spouse</b> <b>is</b> punished economically, but keeps her children.|$|E
25|$|Others welcome {{everyone}} whether dressed or nude (subject {{to other}} miscellaneous rules and requirements).

If a full nudity policy were in place, such a family would have to split up for the day, or find an alternative activity. A few resorts attempt a compromise by allowing females to wear minimal clothing, but not males.|$|E

25|$|The Queen is the fount of all honours in the Canadian provinces, {{the first}} being the Order of the Dogwood for the British Columbia's centennial in 1957. Unlike {{in the federal}} sphere, however, where new orders, decorations, and medals may only be created with the {{approval}} of the sovereign through letters patent, the same in the provinces are formed through Order in Council by the relevant lieutenant governor in the Queen's name. Hence, the insignia and medallions for these awards bear a crown, cypher, and/or effigy of the monarch. Further, in 1999 Queen Elizabeth II approved the design and issuance of the Viceregal Badge of Service, which features a diamond shape framing a red circle bearing a maple leaf; the lieutenant governors' badge is gold in appearance and the one for their <b>spouse</b> <b>is</b> silver. On 1 January 2000, all living current and former lieutenant governors and their spouses were presented with the badge.|$|E
