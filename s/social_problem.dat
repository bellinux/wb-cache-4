5|$|Scandal, {{released}} by Shochiku in April 1950, {{was inspired by}} the director's personal experiences with, and anger towards, Japanese yellow journalism. The work is an ambitious mixture of courtroom drama and <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> film about free speech and personal responsibility, but even Kurosawa regarded the finished product as dramatically unfocused and unsatisfactory, and almost all critics agree. However, it would be Kurosawa's second film of 1950, Rashomon, that would ultimately win him, and Japanese cinema, a whole new international audience.|$|E

5|$|Adolf Hitler's rise {{to power}} in Germany and his regime's anti-Semitic {{policies}} significantly affected American pre-Code filmmaking. Although Hitler had become unpopular {{in many parts of}} the United States, Germany was still a voluminous importer of American films and the studios wanted to appease the German government. The ban on Jews and negative portrayals of Germany in the Fatherland even led to a significant reduction in work for Jews in Hollywood until after the end of World War II. As a result, only two <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> films released by independent film companies addressed the mania in Germany during the pre-Code era (Are We Civilized? and Hitler's Reign of Terror).|$|E

Of course, that <b>social</b> <b>problems</b> are not a phenomenon, that is present exclusively in the crisis period, but their worsening and spreading occurs in difficult socio­economic conditions. The article considers such sociological approaches to <b>social</b> <b>problems</b> as <b>social</b> pathology, social disorganization, functional and critical approaches, the approach of value conflict, constructionsite approach and the approach of «labelling». Each approach has its own peculiarities of consideration of <b>social</b> <b>problems,</b> that is related with the historical period in which it arose and settled down, and the views of members of a particular sociological approach to <b>social</b> <b>problems.</b> Also, the article discusses the main advantages and disadvantages of sociological approaches to dealing the <b>social</b> <b>problems...</b>|$|R

5|$|Americans' mistrust and {{dislike of}} lawyers was a {{frequent}} topic of dissection in <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> films such Lawyer Man (1933), State's Attorney, and The Mouthpiece (1932). In films such as Paid (1930), the legal system turns innocent characters into criminals. The life of Joan Crawford's character is ruined and her romantic interest is executed so that she may live free, although she is innocent of the crime for which the district attorney wants to convict her. Religious hypocrisy was addressed in such films as The Miracle Woman (1931), starring Barbara Stanwyck and directed by Frank Capra. Stanwyck also portrayed a nurse and initially reluctant heroine who manages to save, via unorthodox means, two young children in danger from nefarious characters (including Clark Gable as a malevolent chauffeur) in Night Nurse (1931).|$|E
5|$|Dementia, and {{specifically}} Alzheimer's disease, may {{be among the}} most costly diseases for society in Europe and the United States, while their costs in other countries such as Argentina, and South Korea, are also high and rising. These costs will probably increase with the ageing of society, becoming an important <b>social</b> <b>problem.</b> AD-associated costs include direct medical costs such as nursing home care, direct nonmedical costs such as in-home day care, and indirect costs such as lost productivity of both patient and caregiver. Numbers vary between studies but dementia costs worldwide have been calculated around $160billion, while costs of Alzheimer's disease in the United States may be $100billion each year.|$|E

In The Dark Horse (1932), Warren William is again enlisted, {{this time to}} get an imbecile, who is accidentally in the running for Governor, elected. The candidate wins the election despite his incessant, embarrassing mishaps. Washington Merry-Go-Round portrayed the state of a political system stuck in neutral. Columbia Pictures nearly released the film with a scene of the public execution of a politician as the climax before deciding to cut it.|$|E

40|$|A common way of {{defining}} <b>social</b> <b>problems</b> is {{to include a}} subjective element; objective conditions only become <b>social</b> <b>problems</b> when they {{are perceived to be}} undesirable by some segment of the public. In their actual treatment of <b>social</b> <b>problems,</b> however, sociologists have contradicted their own definitions by ignoring public opinion in their selection of specific problems for study. A survey of Gallup Polls from 1935 to 1975 shows certain patterns in public definitions of problems and identifies the kind of concerns held by the public. An examination of thirty-four <b>social</b> <b>problems</b> texts shows the kind of problems treated by sociologists, and there is con-siderable disparity between the public and the professional perspectives. A resolution of this disparity is suggested {{in the form of a}} new definition of <b>social</b> <b>problems</b> that gives both professional and public opinion a place in identifying and analyzing <b>social</b> <b>problems.</b> One of the difficulties in the study of <b>social</b> <b>problems</b> is the initial task of definition.

40|$|Objective: This study {{investigated}} the relationship between motor performance; attentional, hyperactive, and impulsive symptoms; and <b>social</b> <b>problems.</b> Correlations between parents' versus teachers' ratings of <b>social</b> <b>problems</b> and ADHD symptomatology were also examined.

Results: After controlling for ADHD symptomatology, motor skills remained a significant predictor of <b>social</b> <b>problems</b> in the teacher model but not in the parent model. After controlling for motor skills, inattentive (not hyperactive-impulsive) symptoms were a significant predictor of <b>social</b> <b>problems</b> in the parent model, whereas hyperactive-impulsive (not inattentive) symptoms were a significant predictor of <b>social</b> <b>problems</b> in the teacher model.

40|$|Dissertation (Master of Education(Education)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2008 The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} how teachers dealt with learners’ <b>social</b> <b>problems.</b> Another concern of the study was to investigate the extent to which pre-service and in-service teacher-training prepared teachers to deal with learners’ <b>social</b> <b>problems.</b> The research used qualitative methodology. The major advantage of using qualitative research was that it focused on researching teachers in their school setting, to determine how teachers dealt with learners’ <b>social</b> <b>problems.</b> The main instrument used was interviews as it yielded rich in-depth knowledge and allowed me to probe responses and investigate the teachers’ feelings and emotions. A purposive sampling technique was used to select the respondents. The study population was confined to four public high schools in Cape Town. It was composed of three newly qualified teachers and one experienced teacher. The results reflected that teachers dealt with learners’ <b>social</b> <b>problems</b> by trial and error and there was no evidence of deliberate planning in identifying learners with <b>social</b> <b>problems.</b> The preservice teacher training programmes did not equip teachers with the skills to deal with learners’ <b>social</b> <b>problems.</b> Although teachers received some form of training at schools, the training was not effective in assisting them. The thesis argues that <b>social</b> <b>problems</b> cannot be dealt with solely by the school or the teacher. It is recommended that the Department of Education, the community and the parents, as well as other social service organisations, should jointly create preventive and intervention strategies to assist learners with <b>social</b> <b>problems.</b> Such a holistic approach, the study asserts, could assist schools and teachers to deal with learners’ <b>social</b> <b>problems</b> more effectively. Teachers should receive pre-service training to deal with learners’ <b>social</b> <b>problems,</b> for example, by adding a module such as Sociology of Education. The teachertraining programmes and continuous in-service training programmes should ensure that teachers are exposed to current Departmental policies and documents that can assist them in dealing with learners’ <b>social</b> <b>problems...</b>|$|R
