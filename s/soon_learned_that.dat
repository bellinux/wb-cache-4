Harriet complained to Percy Shelley on his return about the way Hogg had treated her; Percy was offended, but nevertheless remained on friendly terms with Hogg. Troubled by the distress felt by his housemates, Percy Shelley suddenly decided to leave York with Harriet and her sister. Hogg subsequently sent him a series of angry letters in which he complained about how he had been treated.

Hogg and Shelley subsequently exchanged many emotional letters {{over the course of the}} following two months, but then ceased communicating for a year.|$|E
5|$|Alomar {{made her}} {{first and only}} {{appearance}} in Resident Evil 5. According to the character's backstory, her parents {{died when she was}} eight years old in an apparent factory accident and she was taken in by her uncle. Eventually, Alomar ran away and was found by a truck driver who was part of a rebel militia group. She later joined the group and <b>soon</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> the factory accident her parents had died in was actually a test of a bio-organic weapon (BOW) by the pharmaceutical company Umbrella Corporation. With the help of the local government, Umbrella destroyed Alomar's village and its inhabitants after the test was complete. When Alomar was 15, she was contacted by U.S. operatives to sabotage Umbrella's attempt to sell a BOW. With Alomar's help, the deal was stopped and she was offered a chance {{to start a new life}} in America. Alomar accepted, was speaking fluent English within months and enrolled at a university two years later. After graduation, her benefactor recruited her to join the Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance (BSAA). While Umbrella had dissolved years before this, Alomar's hatred of Umbrella and others like them led her to join. She was assigned to a unit for eight months of training, in which she excelled and was chosen to become an agent assigned to the BSAA's West African department. When BSAA agent Chris Redfield is sent to intercept a black market BOW sale in the fictional African country Kijuju, Alomar is assigned to be his partner and guide.|$|E

After Sauron forged the One Ring, Gil-galad was given one of the Three Elven Rings: Vilya, the Ring of Air (and most probably also Narya, the Ring of Fire).

25|$|In the {{original}} Morse telegraphs, the receiver's armature made a clicking noise {{as it moved}} {{in and out of}} position to mark the paper tape. The telegraph operators <b>soon</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> they could translate the clicks directly into dots and dashes, and write these down by hand, thus making the paper tape unnecessary. When Morse code was adapted to radio communication, the dots and dashes were sent as short and long tone pulses. It was later found that people become more proficient at receiving Morse code when it is taught as a language that is heard, instead of one read from a page.|$|E

The movement was contested by the Confederate gunboats, but Plummer's troops <b>soon</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> they had only to withdraw out of range when the gunboats appeared, and return as soon as they left. The brigade occupied Point Pleasant on March 6, and the boats shelled their positions for the next three days. In this period, the Confederate Army remained within their fortifications, offering no support to Flag Officer Hollins.|$|E

On Monday, November 15, students began a Taking Back Tuesday movement advocating a schoolwide skip day {{on the day of}} the cancelled concert, but it dissolved after Campbell's schoolwide address that afternoon.|$|E

Bishop Boone ordained both Williams and Liggins to the priesthood on 11 January 1857. They soon began making missionary journeys to various cities in the Yangtze River delta from their Shanghai base.|$|E
25|$|General Lahm {{established}} the Air Corps Training Center in August 1926 {{and set up}} its headquarters at Duncan Field, next to Kelly Field, Texas. He <b>soon</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> the facilities at Kelly and Brooks Fields were not sufficient for proper training. The buildings, erected during World War I with a life expectancy of five years, had no suitable areas for ground training, and the living quarters were inadequate. San Antonio's rapid growth was also beginning to interfere with flying training operations. Maj. Gen. Mason Patrick, Chief of the Air Corps, visited San Antonio in December and recommended that an additional training field be built, and in April 1927 a board of officers appointed by Gen. Lahm approved an unusual circular layout.|$|E
