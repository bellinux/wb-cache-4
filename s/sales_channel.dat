During that time, several F1 designers rented a home in Laguna Beach, California to observe the lifestyles and tastes of American upper class consumers. Meanwhile, F1 engineering teams conducted prototype testing on locations ranging from the German autobahn to U.S. roads. Toyota’s market research concluded that a separate brand and <b>sales</b> <b>channel</b> were needed to present its new sedan, and plans were made {{to develop a new}} network of dealerships in the U.S. market.|$|E
25|$|The {{initiative}} Choice in eCommerce {{was founded}} on May 8, 2013 by several online retailers in Berlin, Germany.

To complement its own direct <b>sales</b> <b>channel,</b> Dell signed agreements {{to have its}} computers sold at CompUSA and Staples Inc. stores. However, selling via middlemen was not very profitable for Dell. Bain consultant Kevin Rollins persuaded Michael Dell {{to pull out of}} these deals. Margins at retail were thin at best and Dell left the reseller channel in 1994. In 1996, Rollins joined Dell full-time.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to analyse {{efficiency}} of <b>sales</b> <b>channels</b> in the time when new products are being launched. As the most suitable method for this analysis was chosen the method of mystery shopping because it can properly compare and measure the most aspects of sales process quality. The results of mystery shopping focused on sales approach of sales assistants showed significant differences in performance of external and internal <b>sales</b> <b>channels</b> in analysed time periods. At the moment there is no significant difference in the support of external and internal <b>sales</b> <b>channels</b> during product launches because it is perceived that both of these <b>sales</b> <b>channels</b> should be highly motivated to sell new products and therefore there is no need in this busy periods to split the effort into two individually designed sales supports. As depicted in the article it would be benefitial to change this approach since the potential of external <b>sales</b> <b>channels</b> is not fully revealed and used as much as it could be. Seeing the fact that all companies generate enormous pressure to launch new products with the highest excellency implementing diverse support should be one of possibilities how to achieve it. Description and explanation of differences in mystery shopping results in external and internal <b>sales</b> <b>channels</b> are used as a base for formulating an approach how sales and marketing efficiency during product launches in external <b>sales</b> <b>channels</b> could be increased...|$|R

25|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{introduction}} of the 610, Nissan launched a new line of slightly smaller cars January 1973 utilizing parts and styling cues from the 610. This new line of cars was sold in various markets as the Datsun 140J/160J, Datsun Violet, or Datsun 710. In Japan, it was exclusive to Nissan Cherry Store Japanese dealerships as a larger companion to the smaller Nissan Cherry, thereby giving Nissan the opportunity to sell a Bluebird-sized vehicle at a different <b>sales</b> <b>channel.</b> The use of the 710 name was a source of confusion because it implied that the model was either a larger, upscale version of the 610 (it was the opposite) or a newer model in the Bluebird line. This car was built at various international plants and was marketed under different names as local conditions required. As the Bluebirds traditional cross-town rival, the Toyota Corona split into a new model called the Toyota Carina, the Violet appeared just under three years after the Carina did.|$|E
