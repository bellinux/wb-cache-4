A substantial carbon deficiency leads to nearly complete bonding of both chromium and cobalt into carbide phases.

Methods: The sCT-CS-NPs were prepared by the ionic gelation method using sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP) as a cross-linking polyion. Inhalable dry powders were obtained by co-spray drying aqueous dispersion of sCT-CS-NPs and mannitol. sCT-CS-NPs co-spray dried powders were characterized with respect to morphology, particle size, powder density, aerodynamic diameter, protein integrity, in vitro release of sCT, and aerosolization. The plasmatic sCT levels following intratracheal administration of sCT-CS-NPs <b>spray</b> dried <b>powders</b> to the rats was also determined. Results: sCT-CS-NPs were able to be incorporated into mannitol forming inhalable microparticles by the spray drying process. The sCT-CS-NPs/mannitol ratios and spray drying process affected the properties of the microparticles obtained. The conformation of the secondary structures of sCTs was affected by both mannitol content and spray dry inlet temperature. The sCT-CS-NPs were recovered after reconstitution of <b>spray</b> dried <b>powders</b> in an aqueous medium. The sCT release profile from <b>spray</b> dried <b>powders</b> was similar to that from sCT-CS-NPs. In vitro inhalation parameters measured by the Andersen cascade impactor indicated sCT-CS-NPs <b>spray</b> dried <b>powders</b> having promising aerodynamic properties for deposition in the deep lung. Determination of the plasmatic sCT levels following intratracheal administration to rats revealed that the inhalable sCT-CS NPs <b>spray</b> dried <b>powders</b> provided higher protein absorption compared to native sCT powders.

40|$|Abstract. Plasma sprayed CoNiCrAlY coating {{can prevent}} {{oxidation}} and corrosion of turbine blades in a gas turbine plant. Cracking and delamination of coatings {{are affected by}} the residual stresses in the coatings. In this study, the arising mechanism of residual stress in the plasma sprayed coating was discussed. The residual stresses in CoNiCrAlY coatings were measured by X-ray diffraction method. The coatings were deposited by either low pressure plasma spraying (LPPS) or atmospheric plasma spraying (APS). Each elastic constant which was used for determining the X-ray stress constant was mechanically measured by a bending test. Two kinds of substrates were prepared for each coating in order to examine the effect of thermal expansion coefficient of a substrate. Results were as follows. The residual stresses of the coatings on steel substrates were tensile. On the other hand, the residual stresses on stainless substrates were lower than those on steel substrates. Arising mechanism of the residual stresses can be explained by both the linear expansion coefficient and the range of changing temperature. It was also found that the absolute residual stresses were affected by the <b>spraying</b> <b>powder</b> size and increased with a decrease of the <b>spraying</b> <b>powder</b> size.
