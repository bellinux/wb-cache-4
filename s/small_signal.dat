5|$|NIF's laser uses {{a system}} of large flashtubes (like those in a {{photography}} flashlamp) to optically pump {{a large number of}} glass plates. Once the plates are flashed and have settled into a population inversion, a <b>small</b> <b>signal</b> from a separate laser is fed into the optical lines, stimulating the emission in the plates. The plates then dump their stored energy into the growing beam, amplifying it billions of times.|$|E
5|$|Each passing loop is {{controlled}} by a <b>small</b> <b>signal</b> box, known as a block-post. These house the lever frames that control the points, the token equipment and telephones. The railway has few signals; instead it has stop boards at Pendre, Brynglas, Quarry Siding and Nant Gwernol, and the blockman allows trains to proceed by use of flags. There are colour light signals located at Tywyn Wharf, operated from the Control Office and disc signals controlled from the ground frame. Abergynolwyn has colour light signals, which are operated from the blockpost. When the block-post is unmanned, {{it is the responsibility}} of the locomotive crew to change the token before proceeding.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, {{several years}} after its {{acquisition}} by Amperex, the manufacturing operations of Advanced Micro Electronics were transferred to Slatersville. The products transferred from Advanced Micro Electronics included <b>small</b> <b>signal</b> silicon planar transistors for military and industrial applications, Leadless Inverted Devices (LIDs) and hybrid circuits using both thin and thick film technology. Manufacturing of these three products and the sales office for Philips Semiconductors were housed in Slatersville until 1992 when this business unit was sold.|$|E
40|$|Classical and {{recently}} found phytohormones {{play an important}} role in plant growth and development, but plants additionally control these processes through <b>small</b> <b>signalling</b> peptides. Over 1000 potential <b>small</b> <b>signalling</b> peptide sequences are present in the Arabidopsis genome. However, to date, a mere handful of <b>small</b> <b>signalling</b> peptides have been functionally characterized and few have been linked to a receptor. Here, we assess the potential <b>small</b> <b>signalling</b> peptide outputs, namely the molecular, biochemical, and morphological changes they trigger in Arabidopsis. However, we also include some notable studies in other plant species, in order to illustrate the varied effects that can be induced by <b>small</b> <b>signalling</b> peptides. In addition, we touch on some evolutionary aspects of <b>small</b> <b>signalling</b> peptides, as studying their signalling outputs in single-cell green algae and early land plants will assist in our understanding of more complex land plants. Our overview illustrates the growing interest in the <b>small</b> <b>signalling</b> peptide research area and its importance in deepening our understanding of plant growth and development...|$|R
50|$|Analog {{geophones}} {{are very}} sensitive devices which can respond to very distant tremors. These <b>small</b> <b>signals</b> can be drowned by larger signals from local sources. It is possible though to recover the <b>small</b> <b>signals</b> caused by large but distant events by correlating signals from several geophones deployed in an array. Signals which are registered only at one or few geophones {{can be attributed to}} unwanted, local events and thus discarded. It can be assumed that <b>small</b> <b>signals</b> that register uniformly at all geophones in an array can be attributed to a distant and therefore significant event.|$|R

5|$|Another {{structure}} at {{the complex}} is a <b>small</b> <b>signal</b> house, which was constructed as a flag {{house for the}} timber flagstaff, both constructed with the original structures in 1903. The flag house was constructed to match the lighthouse, from precast concrete blocks, rendered walls, with the same plinth and deep ashlar coursing. The roof is made of concrete in a shallow hipped form, {{in contrast to the}} concrete dome proposed in the original drawings. The flag locker now houses maritime signal flags. The timber flagstaff was removed at an unknown date, and what remains of it are a concrete and steel base, a concrete apron, and four concrete and iron anchor points.|$|E
25|$|Automatic {{gain control}} {{circuits}} require an amplifier's gain {{be controlled by}} the time-averaged amplitude so that the output amplitude varies little when weak stations are being received. The non-linearities are assumed arranged so the relatively <b>small</b> <b>signal</b> amplitude suffers from little distortion (cross-channel interference or intermodulation) yet is still modulated by the relatively large gain-control DC voltage.|$|E

The model can be quite accurate for low-frequency circuits and can easily be adapted for higher-frequency circuits {{with the addition of}} appropriate inter-electrode capacitances and other parasitic elements.|$|E
25|$|This was {{the first}} of the small {{stations}} that were opened along the line during the 1920s. A siding had been provided when the line opened near the level crossing in the village of Cove, and a simple platform with a corrugated iron pagoda shelter was opened for passengers on 9 June 1924. The level crossing keeper had a cottage and <b>small</b> <b>signal</b> cabin, both of which have survived as a house.|$|E
25|$|An {{amplifier}} {{operating under}} linear (<b>small</b> <b>signal)</b> conditions {{is a good}} example of a non-reciprocal network and a matched attenuator is an example of a reciprocal network.

40|$|We {{discuss a}} new method for setting limits on <b>small</b> <b>signals</b> in the {{presence}} of background noise. The method is based on a combination of a two dimensional confidence region and the large sample approximation to the likelihood ratio test statistic. It automatically quotes upper limits for <b>small</b> <b>signals</b> and two-sided confidence intervals for larger samples. We show that this method gives the correct coverage and also has good power...|$|R
25|$|In most {{amplifiers}} {{a reduction}} in gain takes place before hard clipping occurs; {{the result is a}} compression effect, which (if the amplifier is an audio amplifier) sounds much less unpleasant to the ear. For these amplifiers, the 1nbsp&dB compression point is defined as the input power (or output power) where the gain is 1nbsp&dB less than the <b>small</b> <b>signal</b> gain. Sometimes this non linearity is deliberately designed in to reduce the audible unpleasantness of hard clipping under overload.|$|E
25|$|When {{the line}} opened in 1885 a {{platform}} was provided {{on the east}} side of the track near the hamlet of Up Exe with the name 'Up Exe and Silverton', although a Silverton railway station already existed on the Bristol to Exeter Line to serve that village. From 1 May 1905 the Exe Valley station was renamed 'Up Exe'. It was provided with a small stone building for passenger use and a house for the station master, although it never had a goods yard. A <b>small</b> <b>signal</b> box was provided next to the level crossing.|$|E
25|$|This station {{served the}} village of Swimbridge in Devon. It had just a single {{platform}} {{on the south side}} of the line until a second platform and passing loop were provided from 19 February 1904. The goods shed was on a loop line opposite the original platform, and so from 1904 was behind the westbound platform. The original <b>small</b> <b>signal</b> box was at the east end of the original platform, but was replaced by one in the middle of that platform when the loop was lengthened. Goods traffic was withdrawn from 3 August 1964. The site is now been taken over by the North Devon Link Road.|$|E

25|$|It {{was later}} {{realised}} that the spiral-scan did provide angle-off information, through simple geometry and timing. Since the radar beam had a finite width, about five degrees, it would see some return {{even when the}} target was not centred in the beam. A target far from the centreline would only be illuminated when the dish was pointed in that direction while rotating rapidly away from it. The result as a short arc on the display about 10 degrees long. A target closer to the centre, say five degrees to port, would be illuminated strongly when the dish was pointed to the left, but still receive a <b>small</b> <b>signal</b> {{even when it was}} pointed to the right. That meant it produced a varying return almost through the entire rotation, creating a much longer arc, or a complete circle if the target was dead ahead.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, Little Round Top was undefended by Union troops. Maj. Gen. George Meade, {{commander}} of the Army of the Potomac, had ordered Maj. Gen. Daniel Sickles's III Corps to defend {{the southern end of}} Cemetery Ridge, which would have just included Little Round Top. But Sickles, defying Meade's orders, moved his corps a few hundred yards west to the Emmitsburg Road and the Peach Orchard, causing a large salient in the line, which was also too long to defend properly. His left flank was anchored in Devil's Den. When Meade discovered this situation, he dispatched his chief engineer, Brig. Gen. Gouverneur K. Warren, to attempt to deal with the situation south of Sickles's position. Climbing Little Round Top, Warren found only a <b>small</b> <b>Signal</b> Corps station there. He saw the glint of bayonets in the sun to the southwest and realized that a Confederate assault into the Union flank was imminent. He hurriedly sent staff officers, including Washington Roebling, to find help from any available units in the vicinity.|$|E
25|$|The first {{automatic}} electric fire alarm was patented in 1890 by Francis Robbins Upton, {{an associate of}} Thomas Edison. George Andrew Darby patented the first European electrical heat detector in 1902 in Birmingham, England. In the late 1930s Swiss physicist Walter Jaeger tried to invent a sensor for poison gas. He expected that gas entering the sensor would bind to ionized air molecules and thereby alter an electric current in a circuit in the instrument. His device did not meet its purpose: small concentrations of gas {{had no effect on}} the sensor's conductivity. Frustrated, Jaeger lit a cigarette and was soon surprised to notice that a meter on the instrument had registered a drop in current. Smoke particles from his cigarette had apparently done what poison gas could not. Jaeger's experiment was one of the advances that {{paved the way for the}} modern smoke detector. In 1939 Swiss physicist Ernst Meili devised an ionization chamber device capable of detecting combustible gases in mines. He also invented a cold cathode tube that could amplify the <b>small</b> <b>signal</b> generated by the detection mechanism to a strength sufficient to activate an alarm.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{recently}} reported that some non-magnetic materials in bulk state, exhibit magnetic behavior at the nanscale due to surface and size effects. The experimental observation of these effects {{is based on}} the measurement of very <b>small</b> magnetic <b>signals.</b> Thus, some spurious effects that are not critical for bulk materials with large magnetic signals may become important when measuring <b>small</b> <b>signals</b> (typically below 0. 0001 emu). Here, we summarize some sources of these <b>small</b> magnetic <b>signals</b> that should be considered when studying this new nanomagnetismComment: 16 pages, 10 figure...|$|R
25|$|A {{spindle motor}} {{in the drive}} rotates the {{magnetic}} medium at a certain speed, while a stepper motor-operated mechanism moves the magnetic read/write head(s) radially along {{the surface of the}} disk. Both read and write operations require the media to be rotating and the head to contact the disk media, an action originally accomplished by a disk-load solenoid. Later drives held the heads out of contact until a front-panel lever was rotated (5¼") or disk insertion was complete (3½"). To write data, current is sent through a coil in the head as the media rotates. The head's magnetic field aligns the magnetization of the particles directly below the head on the media. When the current is reversed the magnetization aligns in the opposite direction, encoding one bit of data. To read data, the magnetization of the particles in the media induce a tiny voltage in the head coil as they pass under it. This <b>small</b> <b>signal</b> is amplified and sent to the floppy disk controller, which converts the streams of pulses from the media into data, checks it for errors, and sends it to the host computer system.|$|E
500|$|Dunster {{railway station}} {{is on the}} West Somerset Heritage Railway, though the station is over {{a mile from the}} village. The station was opened on 16 July 1874 by the Minehead Railway. The line was {{operated}} by the Bristol and Exeter Railway which was amalgamated into the Great Western Railway (GWR) in 1876. The Minehead Railway was itself absorbed into the GWR in 1897. A <b>small</b> <b>signal</b> box stood at the [...] end of the platform, but was demolished in 1926 when this was extended. In 1934 a new signal box {{at the opposite end of}} the station, brought second-hand from Maerdy, was put into use when the line from Dunster to [...] was doubled in 1934. The GWR was nationalised into British Railways in 1948 and from 1964, when goods traffic was withdrawn on 6 July, the line was run down until it was eventually closed on 4 January 1971. The line was reopened as a heritage railway operated by the West Somerset Railway on 28 March 1976. The signal box was moved to Minehead in 1977 but the goods yard is now home to the railway’s civil engineering team. It is a Grade II listed building.|$|E
500|$|The station saw {{major works}} at the {{beginning}} of the 1880s. From 24 to 27 January 1880, the line was relaid as [...] standard gauge, and on 15 September 1880 a passing loop was brought into use through the station, east of the original track, with a new platform serving it. The new platform had a large shelter and a <b>small</b> <b>signal</b> cabin immediately south of the shelter, with a footbridge at the south end linking it to the original platform. Both platforms had [...] "half barrel" [...] canopies added. The new [...] "down" [...] platform served trains towards Bristol, while the original [...] "up" [...] platform now served trains towards Portishead. The double track through the station was extended to Portishead Junction from 1883. The station's name was changed to Rownham in March 1891, but reverted to Clifton Bridge in 1910. In 1899 the station was flooded to a depth of several feet (one metre), as were other parts of Bristol. A new signal box with 27 levers was built at the south end of the western platform, with the original cabin taken out of use from 25 August 1907. The signal box contained three token instruments, connected to the line's other signal boxes at Oakwood, [...] and Portishead, so that the Pill or Oakwood boxes could be switched out. The boxes at Clifton Bridge and Portishead were manned 24 hours a day. By 1889, services had increased to nine trains in each direction on weekdays and one on Sundays, and from 1909 this increased to 13 on weekdays and two on Sundays.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the role of}} RALFL 34 during early events in lateral root development, and demonstrate its specific importance in orchestrating formative cell divisions in the pericycle. In plants, many signalling molecules, such as phytohormones, miRNAs, transcription factors, and <b>small</b> <b>signalling</b> peptides, drive growth and development. However, very few <b>small</b> <b>signalling</b> peptides {{have been shown to}} be necessary for lateral root development. Here, we {{describe the}} role of the peptide RALFL 34 during early events in lateral root development, and demonstrate its specific importance in orchestrating formative cell divisions in the pericycle. Our results further suggest that this <b>small</b> <b>signalling</b> peptide acts on the transcriptional cascade leading to a new lateral root upstream of GATA 23, an important player in lateral root formation. In addition, we describe a role for ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTORs (ERFs) in regulatingRALFL 34 expression. Taken together, we put forward RALFL 34 as a new, important player in lateral root initiation...|$|R
