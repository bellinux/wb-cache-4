40|$|A set {{of burning}} {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} investigate the influence of smoke vent height and exhausting velocity on mechanical <b>smoke</b> <b>exhausting</b> efficiency. Results {{have shown that the}} <b>smoke</b> <b>exhausting</b> process becomes more efficient due to the increased smoke vent height and the decreased exhausting velocity, which eliminate the plug-holing issue with fewer disturbances on the smoke layer interface. For each certain exhausting velocity, there is a critical value of distance between the vent and the bottom of the smoke layer. When the distance is less than the critical value, the <b>smoke</b> <b>exhausting</b> is inefficient, and the efficiency decreases sharply as the distance decreases. Contrarily, when the distance is greater than the critical value, a good efficiency can be acquired and the <b>exhausted</b> <b>smoke</b> increased relatively slowly as the distance increases. A critical Froude number, proposed by Hinkley to predict the onset of plug-holing effect in gravity venting systems, was validated in the experiments. However, the experimental results indicate that in the tests without the plug-holing, the fresh air entrained due to <b>smoke</b> <b>exhausting</b> is up to 48 % of the mechanical exhausting rate...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{performance}} of five different smoke extraction modes for an underground channel fire was numerically investigated originally in this paper. Results {{have shown that}} mechanical air supplying from adjacent smoke bays will intensify the air entrainment and increase the smoke production, which lead to a reduction of smoke temperature and buoyancy so that it's easier for smoke to descend to the lower level of the building space. The <b>smoke</b> <b>exhausting</b> process is not effective while using the smoke vents remote to the fire region as the fresh air is strongly sucked into the vents instead of smoke. Compared with the commonly used smoke extraction mode with all the <b>smoke</b> bays together, <b>exhausting</b> the fire-induced <b>smoke</b> with relatively high velocity by using the vents inside of or close to the fire is able to achieve a more effective <b>smoke</b> <b>exhausting</b> process. The most effective smoke extraction mode has also been validated by simulating a platform fire scenario in a full-scale subway station...|$|R

50|$|As {{with water}} and steam, air was also {{necessary}} to burn coal.
