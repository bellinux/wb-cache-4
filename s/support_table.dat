5|$|In the {{original}} version, the Enterprise visits Naterra and meets the planet's leader, Zxolar, who {{is concerned that}} Captain Kirk is an alien called Komether who is due to return within twenty days to destroy their world. Zxolar suddenly collapses and Doctor McCoy tries to help him but an energy surrounds the doctor's head and he runs at a wall and disappears. The landing party search for McCoy {{but to no avail}} and Zxolar is beamed to the Enterprise. Doctor Chapel attempts to help him but the energy appears around her and she passes out. Xon and Kirk discuss the energy and realize it wants Zxolar to die as it has attacked anyone who helps him. The pair beam back down the planet to investigate the palace they met Zxolar in and discover an archive which shows them {{the original}} agreement made by six philosophers, including a much younger Zxolar, and Komether a thousand years earlier. They note one of the philosophers is Zxolar and the Komether is the energy being which attacked the two doctors. As in the later version used on Star Trek: The Next Generation, the agreement was that the being would correct the pollution of the planet in return for ownership of the planet a thousand years later. Xon and Kirk decide to move Zxolan to a life <b>support</b> <b>table</b> and ask for other volunteers as it is apparent that Komether will attack them as they attempt to save him. Scotty, Sulu and Chekov all volunteer as well, and the alien disables each of them as they move Zxolar. It is only because of Xon's strength as he is being attacked that they manage to attach Zxolar to a life support machine and his life signs immediately improve. Zxolar tells Kirk about the contract, who retrieves it from the planet's surface and challenges it. Komethar appears and agrees to a trial with the Enterprises computer acting as an impartial judge. Kirk realises that Komethar was created by the six philosophers and so as the last remaining, Zxolar is in control of it. Zxolar manages to defeat the creature using his will and releases the stunned crewmen. He finds that McCoy was trapped in the wall itself and releases him too, the Enterprise departing shortly thereafter.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT- The task {{of lifting}} an object from a <b>support</b> <b>table,</b> {{holding it in}} the air and then {{replacing}} it on the table seems to be organized in the following way: distinct phases are linking together, each phase characterized by a pattern of muscular activity, specific sensory gating and processing, and by parameters primarily concerned with the magnitude of muscular activity. The transition from one phase to another is triggered by phase-dependent patterns of short-lasting sensory inputs. The parameters em-ployed depend on previous experience, visual and haptic information, and sensory information gathered during the execution of the task. Available data strongly suggest that the motor behavior displayed by humans is best described as a discrete event driven control rather than a continuous closed-loop control. Thus, the control mechanisms active when lifting an object in a precision grip are basilically anticipatory in nature and makes "intermittent " use of sensory information to update task phase parameters or to shift from one phase to another...|$|E

40|$|For the {{acquisition}} of a mammogram, a breast is compressed between a compression paddle and a <b>support</b> <b>table.</b> When compression is applied with a flexible compression paddle, the upper plate may be tilted, which results in variation in breast thickness from the chest wall to the breast margin. Paddle tilt has been recognized as {{a major problem in}} volumetric breast density estimation methods. In previous work, we developed a fully automatic method to correct the image for the effect of compression paddle tilt. In this study, we investigated in three experiments the effect of paddle tilt and its correction on volumetric breast density estimation. Results showed that paddle tilt considerably affected accuracy of volumetric breast density estimation, but that effect could be reduced by tilt correction. By applying tilt correction, a significant increase in correspondence between mammographic density estimates and measurements on MRI was established. We argue that in volumetric breast density estimation, tilt correction is both feasible and essential when mammographic images are acquired with a flexible compression paddl...|$|E
40|$|During the {{acquisition}} of a mammogram the breast is compressed between the compression paddle and the <b>support</b> <b>table.</b> When compression is applied, the upper plate is tilted which results in variation in breast thickness from the chest wall to the breast margin. Variation in breast thickness influences the grey-level values of the image and hampers image analysis, such as volumetric breast density estimation. In this paper, we present and compare two methods that estimate and correct image tilt. The first method estimates tilt from fatty tissue regions. The second method {{is based on the}} entropy of the grey-level distribution of the image. Both methods use a classifier that distinguishes fatty areas from dense tissue based on texture features independent of tilt. The tilt correction methods are evaluated by assessing their accuracies in estimating artificial tilts that are added to images that are known to have only a small tilt. On average, both methods are able to estimate the artificial tilt. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that presents and validates tilt correction methods on individual mammograms...|$|E
