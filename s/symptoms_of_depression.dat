5|$|Antidepressants may be {{effective}} for treating chronic pain associated with <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression,</b> {{but they have}} a risk of side effects. Although the antiseizure drugs gabapentin and carbamazepine are sometimes used for chronic low back pain and may relieve sciatic pain, there is insufficient evidence to support their use. Systemic oral steroids have not been shown to be useful in low back pain. Facet joint injections and steroid injections into the discs have not been found to {{be effective}} in those with persistent, non-radiating pain; however, they may be considered for those with persistent sciatic pain. Epidural corticosteroid injections provide a slight and questionable short-term improvement in those with sciatica but are of no long term benefit.

40|$|Objective To {{explore the}} {{relationship}} between coping mechanisms and suicidal ideations among women who experience <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> postpartum <b>depression.</b> Design This exploratory descriptive study used secondary data from a study of women who experienced <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> postpartum <b>depression.</b> Participants Convenience and purposive sampling were used to obtain the community sample of 40 women who experienced <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> postpartum <b>depression.</b> Methods Binary logistic regression was employed to explore emotion-focused coping, avoidance-focused coping, problem-focused coping, and religious coping as predictors of suicidal ideations. Results Approximately 27 % of the sample reported suicidal ideations within the past seven days. The results showed that lower levels of emotion-focused coping {{and higher levels of}} avoidance-focused and religious coping predicted suicidal ideations in participants. Problem-focused coping did not predict suicidal ideations. Conclusion Overall, our findings provide support for the importance of coping mechanisms as predictors of suicidal ideations among women who experience <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> postpartum <b>depression.</b> The results illustrate the need for health professionals to conduct routine assessments on coping strategies and thoughts of suicide when caring for postpartum women, as well as the need to integrate coping approaches in the prevention and treatment of suicidal ideations...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: This {{case study}} of a 29 -year-old married woman with {{postpartum}} bipolar depression demonstrates the importance of an accurate differential diagnosis when evaluating a patient presenting with <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> postpartum <b>depression.</b> CONCLUSION: Although many of the signs and <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> unipolar <b>depression</b> and bipolar depression are identical, there are some important differences. Careful evaluation <b>of</b> <b>symptoms</b> and a thorough psychiatric history leads to accurate diagnosis and successful treatment outcomes.

40|$|The {{object of}} this study was to examine the role of {{emotional}} reactivity in infants with congenital heart defects (CHD) in relation to their mothers' <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> postnatal <b>depression.</b> The study population was drawn from the Norwegian country-wide CHD registry from the Department of Pediatric Cardiology at Oslo University Hospital and the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study. Mother-infant dyads with mild/moderate or severe CHD (n= 242) were assessed with a 6 -item short version (EPDS- 6) of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and the Infant Characteristic Questionnaire's fussy/difficult subscale (ICQ-D/F- 7) at 6 months postpartum. When adjusting for infant emotional reactivity, mothers of infants with severe CHD showed significantly elevated <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> postnatal <b>depression</b> 6 months postpartum (odds ratio= 2. 22) compared to the mothers of infants with mild/moderate CHD. The results identify severe CHD in infants as a predictor <b>of</b> heightened <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> postnatal <b>depression</b> in mothers, independent of the infant's emotional reactivity.

Therefore patients experiencing depression after acute MI should be identified and given targeted psychological interventions. This research was a quasi experimental and clinical trial study and consisted of two groups and three stages. The samples included 22 patients with MI that were randomly put into two equal groups (experimental & control). The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the effect of group therapy on patients with MI before, after and one month after the intervention. Depression were assessed using the Beck depression inventory. The data were analyzed with paired T-test and T _ student using SPSS soft ware. The results showed a significant difference between <b>depression</b> <b>of</b> groups before, after and one month after intervention (P < 0. 001).

A further study also saw a neutral result. A meta-study of the Coping with Depression course, a cognitive behavioral intervention delivered by a psychoeducational method, saw a 38% reduction in risk of major depression.|$|E
25|$|After the {{deprivation}} is complete, mild psychological disturbances, such as anxiety, irritability, hallucinations, {{and difficulty}} concentrating may develop and appetite may increase. There are also positive consequences of REM deprivation. Some <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> {{are found to}} be suppressed by REM deprivation; aggression, and eating behavior may increase. Higher norepinepherine is a possible cause of these results. Whether and how long-term REM deprivation has psychological effects remains a matter of controversy. Several reports have indicated that REM deprivation increases aggression and sexual behavior in laboratory test animals. Rats deprived of paradoxical sleep die in 4–6 weeks (twice the time before death in case of total sleep deprivation). Mean body temperature falls continually during this period.|$|E
50|$|Depression is also {{characterized}} by decreased {{activation of the}} medial prefrontal cortex, ventral striatum, {{and in particular the}} nucleus accumbens in response to positive stimuli. These regions are important in reward processing, and dysfunction <b>of</b> them in <b>depression</b> is thought to underly anhedonia, a core <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> involving decreased ability to feel pleasure. Residual anhedonia that is not well targeted by serotonergic antidepressants is hypothesized to result from inhibition of dopamine release by activation of 5-HT2C receptors in the striatum.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the current {{study was to examine the}} mutual {{relationships}} between dyadic level (i. e., marital quality and parenting stress) and individual level factors (i. e., children and parental depressive <b>symptoms)</b> in families <b>of</b> children with Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD). Specifically, we explored whether marital interaction (marital quality) was associated with <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> child <b>depression</b> through parent-child interaction (parenting stress) and parent depressive symptoms. We also explored whether parent-child interaction was associated with <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> parent <b>depression</b> through marital interaction and child depressive symptoms. This study was conducted with 256 parent-child dyads, consisting of children with ODD and one of each child&# 39;s parents. Participants were recruited from 14 primary schools located in northern, eastern, and southwestern China. Results revealed that marital quality predicted <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> child <b>depression</b> through the parenting stress, but not parent depressive symptoms; and parenting stress predicted <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> parent <b>depression</b> through marital quality, but not through child depressive symptoms. Also, parenting stress significantly and directly predicted parent depressive symptoms. We concluded in families of children with ODD, the association of marital interaction and parent-child interaction on both <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> parent and child depression highlighted the mutual effects of the couple subsystem and the parent-child subsystem. Furthermore, in regard to parental and child depressive symptoms, implications for intervention are provided. </p...|$|R

25|$|The {{combined}} {{actions of}} 5-HT2A and 5HT2C receptor antagonism with serotonin reuptake inhibition only occur at moderate to {{high doses of}} trazodone. Doses of trazodone lower than those effective for antidepressant action are frequently used for the effective treatment of insomnia. Low doses exploit trazodone's potent actions as a 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, and its properties as an antagonist of H1 and α1-adrenergic receptors, but do not adequately exploit its SERT or 5-HT2C inhibition properties, which are weaker. Since insomnia {{is one of the}} most frequent residual <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> after treatment with an SSRI, a hypnotic is often necessary for patients with a major depressive episode. Not only can a hypnotic potentially relieve the insomnia itself, but treating insomnia in patients with major depression may also increase remission rates due to improvement of other symptoms such as loss of energy and depressed mood. Thus, the ability of low doses of trazodone to improve sleep in depressed patients may be an important mechanism whereby trazodone can augment the efficacy of other antidepressants.|$|E
