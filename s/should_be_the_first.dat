25|$|A {{prayer of}} {{petition}} is {{a request to}} God that asks him to fulfill a need. By prayer of petition, Catholics acknowledge their dependence on God. This expression {{is not intended to}} instruct or direct God what to do, but to appeal to his goodness for the things we need; and the appeal is necessary, not because He is ignorant of our needs or sentiments, but to give definite form to our desires, to concentrate our whole attention on what we have to recommend to him, to help us appreciate our close personal relation with him. The expression need not be external or vocal; internal or mental is sufficient. The prayer of petition is at its heart an Act of Faith in that the one praying must believe first, in the existence of God; and second, that God is both willing and able to grant the petition. The Catechism states that asking forgiveness, coupled with trusting humility, <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> movement of a prayer of petition. Jesus said to bring our every need to God in his name and assures that “whatever you ask the Father in my name he will give you.” (John 16:23) Through petition one can ask for God's help with every need no matter how great or small. According to the Catechism, Christ is glorified by what we ask the Father in his name.|$|E
30|$|Consider <b>the</b> <b>first</b> case c_M_t= 0, {{which means}} <b>the</b> product λ_M_t=c_M_tp_M_t <b>should</b> <b>be</b> 0. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> pair of inequalities (N 1, N 2) says 0 <λ_M_t< 0, forcing λ_M_t= 0. The second pair of inequalities (N 3, N 4) says p_M_t-P_Max<λ_M_t<p_M_t, and λ_M_t= 0 {{satisfies}} those inequalities. Now, {{consider the case}} c_M_t= 1, so that <b>the</b> product <b>should</b> <b>be</b> λ_M_t=p_M_t. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> pair of inequalities becomes 0 <λ_M_t< P_Max, which is satisfied by λ_M_t=p_M_t. The second pair says p_M_t<λ_M_t<p_M_t, forcing λ_M_t=p_M_t as desired. This linearization approach, in particular, equates to splitting the feasible regions into two subregions, one where c_M_t= 0 and f(c_M_t,p_M_t)=c_M_tp_M_t= 0 (trivially linear) and the other where c_M_t= 1 and f(c_M_t,p_M_t)=p_M_t (also linear).|$|R

25|$|The flanker's role is {{to tackle}} the {{opposition}} and try to steal the ball. The openside flanker binds {{to the side of}} the scrum that covers the greatest area, while the blindside covers the side nearest the side-line. They bind loosely {{to the side of the}} scrum, but still play an important role in keeping the props tight by pushing at an angle. They <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> forward to a breakdown from a scrum or line-out and are expected to link with the backline or secure the ball at the tackle. Both positions have a high workrate, meaning the players need to be fit, fast and good at reading the opposition's attacking plays. During open play if they have not made the tackle they usually stand in the loose next to the ruck or maul. This allows them to arrive quickly at the next tackle. The blindside is generally the larger of the two and usually acts as a third jumping option at the line-out. The openside flanker is usually faster than the blindside, with good opensides excellent at turning over the ball at the tackle. Teams often use their openside flankers to 'charge' the opposition fly-half, putting pressure on him and forcing him to rush his decision making, kicking or passing. Blindside flankers also have the task of stopping any attempt by the opposition eighth-man to run with the ball around the blindside of a scrum.|$|E

500|$|The Legendary Axe {{received}} positive coverage {{upon its}} release. It was previewed by various video gaming magazines before its release. A preview from Electronic Gaming Monthly called the game [...] "a definite 10" [...] and [...] "one {{of the best}} video games we've ever played". In {{an overview of the}} PC Engine, VideoGames & Computer Entertainment referred to the game as [...] "characteristic of the PC Engine's advanced sound, graphics and game play". A later preview from the same magazine said {{that it was one of}} the console's better games, and they applauded the arcade-like graphics and gameplay. They said that everyone who owned the console should own the game and that it was an [...] "excellent showcase of the game system's capabilities". It was reviewed in Electronic Gaming Monthly in September1989. In the review, Steve Harris said it was one of his favorite games, praising its theme, graphics, sound, and execution; he added that its features were unsurpassed by any video game at the time. Ed Semrad used this game to criticize Rastan, saying The Legendary Axe [...] "is how [...] should have been done". He added that it <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> game TurboGrafx-16 owners should buy. Donn Nauert called the game one of the best adventure games seen at the time and echoed Harris' praises. Jim Allee repeated Semrad's observation that the game is Rastan but with better graphics; he praised its detailed sprites, the diverse music and gameplay, and difficulty level and concluded that it [...] "is everything you could want in a game". Later in that issue Nauert presented a partial walkthrough of the game, where he further praised the game for breathing new life into the platformer genre. An abridged walkthough was published in VideoGames & Computer Entertainment in November1989.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1860, Edward Whymper, [...] an athletic, twenty-year-old English artist, visited the Alps for the first time. He had been hired by a London {{publisher}} to make sketches and engravings of the scenic mountains along the border of Switzerland and Italy. He was soon interested in mountaineering and decided to attempt the yet unconquered Matterhorn. Whymper soon found that Jean-Antoine Carrel, an Italian guide from the Valtournanche, had attempted {{to be the first}} to reach the summit of the Matterhorn since 1857. In the years 1861-1865 both made several attempts by the south-west ridge together but became progressively rivals, according to Whymper because Carrel patriotically believed that a native Italian like himself and not an Englishman like Whymper <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> to set foot on the summit.|$|E
