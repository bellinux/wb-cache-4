40|$|Gear {{theory is}} re-examined {{and we find}} optimal shapes for gears. As {{optimality}} criteria, we allow: (1) minimal frictional losses (highest efficiency) assuming linear law of friction or (2) uniform maximum stress (it will wear out slowly and last the longest) assuming Hertzian contacts or (3) uniform maximal temperature, assuming {{we are in a}} high power limit in which all heat is removed by the lubricant. Some other criteria which have been used before are that (4) mis-spacing the gears still yields perfect gear action with the desired speed ratio or (5) minimal vibration in the low friction limit. Both (4) and (5) lead to "involute gears" which are the standard in engineering practice. Criteria 1, 2, and 3 lead to apparently new gear-tooth forms. We manage to describe these curves with ordinary differential equations (ODEs), and for each of these 3 criteria we find the ODE for both <b>spur</b> (<b>cylinder)</b> and bevel (conical) gears, i. e. a total of 6 ODEs. Keywords [...] - minimum wear, uniform str [...] ...|$|E
5000|$|Colt's Detective Special {{went through}} several issues or series. The First Series was {{produced}} from 1927 until 1946. Compared to later production models, the First Series used a narrower frame, with reduced clearance between the frontstrap of the gripframe and {{the rear of}} the trigger guard. Other distinctive features included a shorter ejector-rod with an ungrooved, knurled tip; a checkered hammer <b>spur</b> and <b>cylinder</b> latch, a [...] "half-moon"-shaped front sight, and an overlapping screw and locking pin set-up {{on the right side of}} the frame. Grip panels were wooden. A rounded butt on the metal frame became standard in 1933, but pieces with the original square butt (like that of the Police Positive Special) continued to be produced into the 1940s.|$|R
50|$|Historians {{of machine}} tools often {{focus on a}} handful of major {{industries}} that most spurred machine tool development. In order of historical emergence, they have been firearms (small arms and artillery); clocks; textile machinery; steam engines (stationary, marine, rail, and otherwise) (the story of how Watt's need for an accurate <b>cylinder</b> <b>spurred</b> Boulton's boring machine is discussed by Roe); sewing machines; bicycles; automobiles; and aircraft. Others could be included in this list as well, but they tend to be connected with the root causes already listed. For example, rolling-element bearings are an industry of themselves, but this industry's main drivers of development were the vehicles already listedâ€”trains, bicycles, automobiles, and aircraft; and other industries, such as tractors, farm implements, and tanks, borrowed heavily from those same parent industries.|$|R
