The purpose of this report is to present a new technique that is of benefit in the early identification and subsequent radiological monitoring of lateral growth arrest and which may permit appropriate timely surgical intervention. Methods: we performed a retrospective review of the medical records and serial radiographs of 11 patients (three males and eight females) with lateral growth disturbance in the proximal femoral physis. We devised a new technique (named the ‘Tilt angle’) for <b>serial</b> <b>radiographic</b> observation of lateral growth arrest. Results: this study included 11 hips in 11 patients. Ten patients had screw epiphyseodesis performed after progression of lateral growth arrest was noted. One patient did not have screw epiphyseodesis but the results for this patient are included, as they provide an interesting ‘control’ case for comparison. The average age of screw epiphyseodesis was 12 years. Seven patients demonstrated improvement in their tilt angle following screw epiphyseodesis (i. e. less valgus), one showed no change and two continued to decline. Conclusions: using a new technique to monitor the progression of lateral growth arrest, we noted that screw epiphyseodesis can be used for guided growth of the proximal femoral physis. This technique can be employed for <b>serial</b> <b>radiographic</b> observation of lateral growth arrest and can guide the clinician on the optimal timing of screw epiphyseodesis.

40|$|Polyethylene wear {{has been}} {{accepted}} as {{a major cause of}} osteolysis in total hip arthroplasty. Submicron particles, which are secondary to abrasive wear, migrate into the effective joint space and stimulate a foreign-body response resulting in bone loss which is mainly mediated by macrophages. Diagnosis depends on <b>serial</b> <b>radiographic</b> evaluation and frequent follow-up. Polyethylene wear and osteolysis can be prevented by reducing the wear such as using a small femoral head, adaptive polyethylene thickness, suitable surgical techniques, non-polyethylene articulation, etc. The presence of cement or circumferential coatings may also retard the distal migration of particles. Medicines such as NSAIDs and bisphosphonate appear to inhibit the progress of osteolysis.

30|$|Several {{treatment}} methods {{are reported in}} the literature, ranging from closed reduction and cast immobilization to open reduction and ligamentous reconstruction, as summarized in Table  1. Usually, the dislocation can be reduced easily by thumb traction and abduction while gently pushing the metacarpal base medially [7, 13]. Nevertheless, the major factor affecting treatment outcome is reduction adequacy and maintenance. In this combination of injury, the RCL remains intact; therefore, if the joint is stable and reduction quality is good after closed manipulation, a thumb spica cast may be chosen [7]. Thumb extension and slight pronation in the cast allows approximation of the stripped AOL and may enable ligamentous healing while contributing the joint stability [10]. If conservative treatment is preferred, the patient should be checked for any radiological signs of reduction loss, particularly during the first 2  weeks after the injury. <b>Serial</b> <b>radiographic</b> follow-up is advocated to monitor the reduction quality achieved at initial reduction. Tolat et al. reported excellent outcome after conservative treatment in a skeletally immature patient (14 years old) [7]. Although, our patient was an adult, conservative treatment yielded an excellent outcome. However, closed reduction and percutanous pin fixation {{seems to be a}} more appropriate treatment method, as it is both minimally invasive and safe against loss of reduction during follow-up. We believe that extensive surgery, such as ligamentous reconstruction using tendon grafts, is overtreatment, because trapezium union and AOL healing provide adequate joint stability [6, 17].|$|R

The radiopaque markers, which are composed of small pieces of root canal broach inserted into the muscle belly, make it possible to determine longitudinal masseter muscle growth as well as migration of the masseter muscle relative to the mandible. It was found that the masseter muscle increased in length by 64 % during the total growth period, most of which occurred between 6 and 18 months of age. Relative to the cranium, the masseter muscle grew markedly inferiorly and only slightly posteriorly. Relative to the mandible, the masseter migrated in a posterior and slightly superior direction, keeping pace with the ramus and condyle as they grew posteriorly and posterosuperiorly throughout the study period. It was concluded that: 1) radiopaque muscle markers are a valuable tool for analysis of muscle growth and alteration of muscle location; 2) the masseter muscle in the rhesus monkey undergoes elongation, probably due to addition of sarcomeres at the fiber-tendon junctions; and 3) posterior migration of the masseter muscle relative to the corpus of the mandible, probably {{due to the nature of}} its periosteal attachment, results in a stability of the anteroposterior position of the masseter muscle despite the anterior displacement of the mandible...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction Osteopetrosis is a {{group of}} {{conditions}} characterized by defects in the osteoclastic function of the bone resulting in defective bone resorption. Clinically, the condition is characterized by a dense, sclerotic, deformed bone which, despite an increased density observable by radiography, often results in an increased propensity to fracture and delayed union. Case Presentation We report the case of a 27 -year-old Asian man presenting with bilateral subtrochanteric femur fractures. He had a displaced right subtrochanteric femur fracture after a low-energy fall, which was treated surgically. The second fracture that our patient endured was diagnosed as a stress fracture ten weeks later when he complained of pain in the contralateral left thigh. By that time, the right-sided fracture exhibited no radiographic evidence of healing, and when the left-sided stress fracture was being treated surgically, bone grafting with recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein- 7 was also performed on the right side. Conclusion While there are no data supporting the use of bone morphogenic proteins in the management of delayed healing in patients with osteopetrosis, no other reliable osteoinductive grafting options are available to treat this condition. Both fractures in our patient healed, but based on the <b>serial</b> <b>radiographic</b> assessment it is uncertain to what degree the recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein- 7 {{may have contributed to the}} successful outcome. It may have also contributed to the formation of heterotopic bone around the fracture site. Further investigation of the effectiveness and indications of bone morphogenic protein use for the management of delayed fracture healing in patients with osteopetrosis is warranted. </p...|$|R

OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} clinical outcome after Discover arthroplasty versus anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) in patients treated for symptomatic single-level cervical disc disease. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) {{is still considered}} the "gold standard" for surgical treatment of cervical spine degenerative disc disease. However, results of many studies suggest that it may cause degenerative changes at levels immediately {{above and below the}} fusion, known as adjacent segment degenerative disease (ADD). Cervical arthroplasty has recently been introduced as an alternative to standard procedure of ACDF. It showed decreased surgical morbidity, decreased complications from postoperative immobilization and an earlier return to previous level of function.

Conclusion: Non of the centers used rectangular localizator, thyroid shield, film holder and just some centers used leaded apron in specific circumstances. We have concluded that patient protection constitute less consideration. Generally lack of protective consideration is related to deficient knowledge of operators. Lackof information about protection equipments causes decrease of demanding of these tools and ultimately lack of these equipments in the market...|$|R
40|$|SummaryIntroductionComputed {{tomography}} (CT) {{is currently}} the reference standard for measuring femoral and tibial rotational alignment. The EOS System is a new biplanar low-dose <b>radiographic</b> <b>device</b> that allows 3 -dimensional lower-limb modelling with automated measurements of femoral and tibial rotational alignment (torsion). HypothesisFemoral and tibial torsion measurements provided by the EOS System are equivalent to those obtained using CT. Materials and methodsIn a retrospective analysis of 43 lower limbs in 30 patients, three senior radiologists measured femoral and tibial torsion on both CT and EOS images. Agreement between CT and EOS values was assessed by computing Pearson's correlation coefficient and interobserver reproducibility by computing the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). ResultsFemoral torsion was 13. 4 ° by EOS vs. 13. 7 ° by CT (P= 0. 5) and tibial torsion was 30. 8 ° by EOS vs. 30. 3 ° by CT (P= 0. 4). Strong associations were found between EOS and CT values for both femoral torsion (P= 0. 93) and tibial torsion (P= 0. 89). With EOS, the ICC was 0. 93 for femoral torsion and 0. 86 for tibial torsion; corresponding values with CT were 0. 90 and 0. 92. DiscussionThe EOS system is a valid alternative to CT for lower-limb torsion measurement. EOS imaging allows a comprehensive evaluation in all three planes while substantially decreasing patient radiation exposure. Level of evidenceLevel III, case-control...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to develop a method to {{estimate}} the 3 D positioning of an anatomic structure using the knowledge of its volume (provided by CT or MRI) combined with a single radiographic projection. This method could be applied in stereo-tactic surgery or in the study of 3 D body joints kinematics. The knowledge of the 3 D anatomical structure, available from CT (or in future MRI) is used to estimate the orientation of the projection that better match the actual 2 D available projection. For this purpose it was necessary to develop an algorithm to simulate the radiographic projections. The radiographic image formation process has been simulated utilising the geometrical characteristics of a real <b>radiographic</b> <b>device</b> and the volumetric anatomical data of the patient, obtained by 3 D diagnostic CT images. The position of the patient volume respect to the radiological device is estimated comparing the actual radiographic projection with those simulated, maximising a similarity index. To assess the estimation the 3 D positioning a segmented vertebra has been used as test volume. The assessment has been carried out only by means of simulation. Estimation errors have been statistically evaluated. Conditions of mispositioning and noise have been also considered. The results relative to the simulation show the feasibility of the method. From the analysis of the errors emerges that the searching procedure results robust respect to the addition of white gaussian nois...|$|R
50|$|TDO is {{a genetic}} based {{disorder}} it is diagnosed based on radiographic imaging, physical {{characteristics of the}} disease, and genetic testing if necessary. PCR amplification is used to check for normal and deletion allele, found in the 141 base pair allele. A four base pair deletion in exon 3 is also noted in patients with TDO; deletion in two transcription factor genes DLX-3 and DLX-7 gene (distal-less gene) that occurs by a frameshift mutation, makes this gene shorter than its normal length and non-functional. Radiographs such as cephalometric analysis or panoramic radiograph are used to detect skeletal abnormalities in TDO cases; these radiographs along with the phenotypic effects of the disease are often enough evidence for proper diagnosis. In normal cases, radiologic imaging shows no evidence of hardening of bone tissue (sclerosis), lesions on the bone structures surrounding the teeth due to decay or trauma, or hard tissue mass. In cases of TDO, these radiographic abnormalities are almost always present. The radiographic testing is non-invasive, and involves the patient {{to be able to}} sit or {{stand in front of the}} <b>radiographic</b> <b>device</b> with their mouth closed and lips relaxed for approximately one minute. Oral abnormalities are diagnosed by a visual dental examination. A normal oral evaluation would show no signs of broken or fractured teeth, attrition of tooth enamel, no spacing between teeth, no soft tissue mass or sign of dental abscess, and a bite relationship where the mandibular (bottom) teeth interdigitate within a normal plane of 1-2mm behind and underneath the maxillary (top) teeth.|$|R
40|$|OBJETIVO: Validar a avaliação radiográfica da degeneração discal {{experimental}} em coelhos. MÉTODOS: Os discos intervertebrais lombares de coelhos New Zealand foram puncionados três vezes com uma agulha 18 G com profundidade limitada de 5 mm, através de abordagem lateral. Foram realizadas radiografias seriadas pré e pós-operatórias imediatas, e depois de quatro, oito e 12 semanas do procedimento, com posterior análise da altura discal, formação de osteófito, esclerose da placa vertebral e presença de degeneração discal. A análise estatística dos dados foi validada pelo coeficiente de concordância Kappa, com intervalo de confiança (IC) de 95 %. RESULTADOS: Observou-se diminuição significativa do espaço discal nas radiografias em AP após 12 semanas de pós-operatório, com Kappa = 0, 489 para IC 95 % (0, 25 - 0, 72) com p OBJECTIVE: To validate radiographic {{evaluation of}} a rabbit model for disc degeneration. METHODS: Lumbar intervertebral discs of New Zealand rabbits were stabbed three times with a 18 G needle at a limited depth of 5 mm, through lateral approach. <b>Serial</b> <b>radiographic</b> images were taken on the early pre-and postoperative periods, and after four, eight and 12 weeks of the procedure, with subsequent analysis of disc height, osteophyte formation, endplate sclerosis, and presence of disc degeneration. The statistical analysis of data was validated by the Kappa coefficient, with a confidence interval (CI) of 95 %. RESULTS: A significant reduction of disc space was found on AP X-ray images after 12 postoperative weeks, with Kappa = 0. 489 for CI 95 % (0. 25 - 0. 72) with p < 0. 001. X-ray signs of disc degeneration also presented Kappa = 0. 63 for CI 95 % (0. 39 - 0. 86) with p < 0. 001. The remaining assessed criteria showed positive results, but with a lower Kappa value. CONCLUSION: The disc degeneration model using rabbits as proposed {{in this study was}} shown to be feasible, with positive X-ray correlation between pre- and postoperative images, validating the potential to induce disc degeneration in this animal model for future studies...|$|R
40|$|Stress radiographs {{have been}} used for several years to detect the amount of varus/valgus knee laxity and to {{evaluate}} the degree of compartmental involvement in degenerative osteoarthritis. However, the popularity of these radiographic methods has been affected by their technical limits due to the x-ray exposure for the personnel involved and the variability of the stress forces applied. A device was developed with the aim to create a constant varus or valgus stress force to the knee with the patient in a supine position. The device does not require personal assistance during the actual film taking. Sixty consecutive patients where included in the study and measured prior to their total knee replacement. All patients had standard weight-bearing AP and lateral views as well as stress views in varus and valgus. Both knees were examined in full extension and 30 ° of flexion. The joint space width in both the lateral and medial compartments were measured and subsequently compared with the standard weight-bearing films. A significant decrease in joint space distance in the affected compartment was found in the stress radiographs compared with the standard weight-bearing views. The medial compartment was best examined with the knee extended and varus stress force (P < 0. 001) and for the lateral compartment 30 ° of flexion proved to be more efficient (P < 0. 01). In conclusion, this stress <b>radiographic</b> <b>device</b> offers a possibility to enhance the varus/valgus force in a standardized way compared to standard weight-bearing views of the knee. The reliability and reproducibility is high. It is suitable for clinical practice and a valuable tool in research...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyzed}} the radiographic and clinical {{outcome of the}} ScanHip total hip arthroplasty in 70 patients after 10 years. The Swedish National Hip Register, in which the end-point of the survival analysis is defined as revisions, reported a 10 -year survival rate of 94 % with the ScanHip, but in the present series 13 % of the femoral stems and 29 % of the sockets met the criteria for aseptic loosening. Focal osteolysis was found around 8 sockets (11 %) and 23 stems (32 %) and had occurred significantly oftener around loose sockets, but not around femoral stems. Linear polyethylene wear was significantly increased in loose sockets, but no relationship was noted between polyethylene wear and stem loosening or was there a correlation between clinical symptoms or patients' satisfaction and component loosening. Therefore precise <b>serial</b> long-term <b>radiographic</b> follow-up is the only satisfactory method for detecting aseptic loosening of total hip arthroplasty. It gives the surgeon more detailed information about each case than survival analysis alone...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In NDT studies, the {{availability}} of a <b>radiographic</b> <b>devices</b> simulation is of primary interest to design the most suitable system and to predict the future device performance. Numerical simulation of radiographs and CT scans makes inspections more reliable and efficient by providing realistic quantitative answers to non-trivial non-destructive evaluations of complex components. In this context, the X-ray radiographic simulation software, Sindbad, has been developed in our laboratory. This software can model any radiographic set-up, including the X-ray source, the beam interaction (direct and scattered) inside the object represented by its CAD model, and the imaging process in the detector (different types). For each step of the virtual experimental bench, Sindbad combine different modelling modules, accessed via Graphical User Interfaces, to provide realistic synthetic images. In this paper, we present the new functionalities which have been recently integrated in Sindbad to improve the simulation of radiographs of complex parts including defects, under specific and typical configurations. First of all, the interface of the new version of BRL-CAD allows the operator to insert easily flaws of various shapes, sizes, and materials within the CAD representation of the part. Moreover, as Sindbad raytracing functions called for the computing of the direct image have been adapted for small details projection, Sindbad can now efficiently compute realistic radiographs of small defects included in complex parts. Some geometric improvements have also been recently integrated: the modelling of panoramic sources, curved detectors and the possibility to place the detector inside the object. Concerning scattered modelling, the Monte Carlo code has been accelerated in cases of low stopping power detectors, like films. Finally, the new version of Sindbad contains a new model of detector: the cascaded system model which is especially useful for flat panel detectors...|$|R
40|$|One hundred {{eighteen}} patients consecutively {{admitted to}} a University Rehabilitation Program entered a protocol study of urologic management. Bladder pressures were kept below 30 cms/H 2 O by urologic treatment. <b>Serial</b> urodynamic, <b>radiographic,</b> bacteriologic, and endoscopic studies were performed at regular intervals. Eighteen patients have been lost to follow-up; 100 patients were followed for a mean 25. 4 months {{with a range of}} 6 months to 56 months. There were 105 patients with lesions superior to the sacral segments and 13 patients with low lesions. At discharge 11 patients were voiding normally, 105 were continent on an intermittent catheterization (IC) protocol, and 2 patients used condom catheter drainage following sphincterotomy. Bacterial cultures and urinalysis data showed little or no relationship to clinical outcome, and treatment for 387 weeks by antimicrobial agents was not associated with discernible benefit as opposed to no treatment. Five patients developed bladder calculi, and five developed unilateral epididymitis. Bladder pressure was relatively easy to control following spinal cord injury, a result which suggests that high bladder pressure is not {{a direct result of the}} neural injury, but rather an evolutionary change as a result of bladder and urethral interactive dysfunction...|$|R
40|$|We prospectively {{determined}} cystine crystal volume (Vcys) in urine specimens {{from all}} consecutive patients with cystine urolithiasis followed at our institution {{over the past}} decade, {{in order to assess}} its predictive value as to the risk of recurrent cystine stone formation. A total of 57 patients (29 males, 28 females) with homozygous cystinuria entered in the study between January 1990 and December 2000, including 15 children aged less than 15 years and 42 patients aged 15 years or more. The clinical and radiological course was followed until December 2001, for a total of 243 patient-years of follow-up. From study entry until the end of follow-up, we serially examined first voided morning urine specimens in all patients, with determination of the number of cystine crystals per mm 3, and the average size of crystals, thus allowing us to calculate Vcys using a simple formula based on crystal geometry. Recurrence was diagnosed on the basis of <b>serial</b> <b>radiographic</b> examinations using X-rays and echography. Overall, cystine crystals were present in 179 (39 %) of the 460 examined urine specimens. Cystine crystalluria was significantly more frequent among the 27 patients who developed new cystine stones (SF) than in the other 30 who remained stone-free (63. 3 vs 25. 5 % of samples, P or = 50 % of serially examined urine samples was more frequently found in patients with recurrent stone formation than in non-recurrent patients (24 / 27 vs 2 / 30, P or = 3, 000 micro 3 /mm 3 was observed at least once prior to each of the 63 stone recurrences observed in 27 patients (2. 3 per patient on the average). In addition, Vcys reflected the efficacy of treatment, with Vcys mean values of 12, 097 +/- 3, 214 micro 3 /mm 3 at baseline, falling to 2, 648 +/- 658 micro 3 /mm 3 on basic therapy (hyperdiuresis plus alkalinization) alone, 1, 141 +/- 522 micro 3 /mm 3 on tiopronin therapy (median dose 1, 000 mg/day) and 791 +/- 390 micro 3 /mm 3 on D-penicillamine therapy (median dose 900 mg/day) whereas captopril had no effect (5, 114 +/- 2, 128 micro 3 /mm 3). Based on {{the results of the present}} study, cystine crystalluria appears to accurately reflect active stone formation in cystinuric patients. Determination of total Vcys provides a simple, cheap and accurate means of predicting the risk of cystine stone recurrence with a Vcys value > or = 3000 micro 3 /mm 3 as the threshold risk value. We propose that serial Vcys determination be performed simultaneously with the measurement of urine pH and specific gravity to optimally monitor the medical treatment of cystine patients...|$|R
