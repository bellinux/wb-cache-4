40|$|A {{conceptual}} design {{has been developed}} for a spent fuel dry <b>storage</b> <b>cask</b> that employs depleted uranium concrete (DUCRETE) in place of ordinary concrete. DUCRETE, which uses depleted uranium oxide rocks rather than gravel as the concrete's heavy aggregate, is a more efficient overall radiation shield (gamma and neutron) than either steel or ordinary concrete. Thus, it allows the cask weight and size to be substantially reduced. Also, using DUCRETE as shielding avoids, or at least defers, disposal of the depleted uranium as waste. This report focuses on DUCRETE cask transportation issues. The approach studied involves placing the <b>storage</b> <b>cask</b> into a simple steel transportation overpack.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{analyses}} were performed to assess the structural response of spent nuclear fuel dry casks subjected to various handling and on-site transfer events. The results of these analyses are {{being used by the}} Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to perform a probabilistic risk assessment (PRA). Although the PRA study is being performed for a specific nuclear plant, the PRA study is also intended to provide a framework for a general methodology that could also be applied to other dry cask systems at other nuclear plants. The dry cask system consists of a transfer cask, used for handling and moving the multi-purpose canister OLIIpC that contains the fuel, and a <b>storage</b> <b>cask,</b> used to store the MPC and fuel on a concrete pad at the site. This paper describes the analyses of the casks for two loading events. The first loading consists of dropping the transfer cask while it is lowered by a crane to a concrete floor at ground elevation. The second loading consists of dropping the <b>storage</b> <b>cask</b> while it is being transferred to the concrete storage pad outdoors. Three dimensional finite element models of the transfer cask and <b>storage</b> <b>cask,</b> containing the MPC and fuel, were utilized to perform the drop analyses.

The Idaho National Laboratory (INL) project team and CRIEPI representatives identified the Ventilated <b>Storage</b> <b>Cask</b> (VSC- 17) spent nuclear fuel <b>storage</b> <b>cask</b> as a candidate to study cask performance, because it had been used to store fuel as part of a dry cask storage demonstration project for more than 15 years. The project involved investigating the properties of the concrete shield. INL performed a survey of the cask in the summers of 2003 and 2004. Preliminary cask evaluations performed in 2003 indicated that the cask has no visual degradation. However, a 4 - 5 mrem/hr step-change in the radiation levels about halfway up the cask and a localized hot spot beneath an upper air vent indicate that there may be variability in the density of the concrete or localized cracking. In 2005, INL and CRIEPI scientists performed additional surveys on the VSC- 17 cask.

40|$|Highly energetic, cosmic-ray muons {{can easily}} {{penetrate}} a dry <b>storage</b> <b>cask</b> and yield {{information about the}} material inside it by making use of the physics of multiple Coulomb scattering. Work by others has shown this information {{may be used for}} verification of dry <b>storage</b> <b>cask</b> contents after continuity of knowledge has been lost. In our modeling and simulation approach, we use ideal planar radiation detectors to record the trajectories and momentum of both incident and exiting cosmic ray muons; this choice allows us to demonstrate the fundamental limit of the technology for a particular measurement and reconstruction method. In a method analogous to computed tomography with attenuation coefficient replaced by scattering density is we apply a filtered back projection algorithm in order to reconstruct both the geometry and material information in modeled scenarios for concrete-walled cask VSC- 24. A scenario where one of the middle four spent nuclear fuel assemblies is missing undetectable with a simple PoCA-based approach is expected to be readily detectable with CT-based approach. Moreover, a trickier scenario where the one or more assemblies is replaced by dummy assembly is put forward. In this case, we expect that this dry <b>storage</b> <b>cask</b> should be found to be not as declared based on our simulation and reconstruction results.

40|$|Conventional {{dry storage}} {{facilities}} for {{spent nuclear fuel}} (SNF) were designed to remove decay heat through the natural convection of air, but this method has limited cooling capacity and a possible re-criticality accident in case of flooding. To enhance the safety and capacity of dry <b>storage</b> <b>cask</b> of SNF, hybrid heat pipe-based passive cooling device was suggested. Heat pipe is an excellent passive heat transfer device using the principles of both conduction and phase change of the working fluid. The heat pipe containing neutron absorber material, the so-called hybrid heat pipe, is expected to prevent the re-criticality accidents of SNF and to increase the safety margin during interim and long term storage period. Moreover, a hybrid heat pipe with thermoelectric module, a Stirling engine and a phase change material tank {{can be used for}} utilization of the waste heat as heat-transfer medium. Located at the guide tube or instrumentation tube, hybrid heat pipe can remove decay heat from inside the sealed metal cask to outside, decreasing fuel rod temperature. In this paper, a 2 -step analysis was performed using computational fluid dynamics code to evaluate the heat and fluid flow inside a cask, which consisted of a single spent fuel assembly simulation and a full-scope dry cask simulation. For a normal dry <b>storage</b> <b>cask,</b> the maximum fuel temperature is 290. 0 °C. With hybrid heat pipe cooling, the temperature decreased to 261. 6 °C with application of one hybrid heat pipe per assembly, and to 195. 1 °C with the application of five hybrid heat pipes per assembly. Therefore, a dry <b>storage</b> <b>cask</b> with hybrid heat pipes produces relatively low temperature inside a cask and reduces the possibility of structural failure due to thermal degradation. clos...|$|E

40|$|A {{spent fuel}} <b>storage</b> <b>cask</b> must {{efficiently}} transfer the heat {{released by the}} fuel assemblies through the cask walls to the environment. This heat must be transferred through passive means, limiting the energy transfer mechanisms from the cask to natural convection and radiation heat transfer [...] Natural convection is essentially independent {{of the characteristics of}} the array of casks, provided there is space between casks to permit a convection loop. Radiation heat transfer, however, depends on the geometric arrangement of the array of casks because the peripheral casks will shadow the interior casks and restrict radiant heat transfer from all casks to the environment. The shadowing of one cask by its neighbors is determined by a view factor that represents the fraction of radiant energy that leaves the surface of a cask and reaches the environment. This paper addresses the evaluation of the view factor between a centrally located spent fuel <b>storage</b> <b>cask</b> and the environment. By combining analytic expressions for the view factor of (1) infinitely long cylinders and (2) finite cylinders with a length-to-diameter ratio of 2 to represent spent fuel storage casks, the view factor can be evaluated for any practical array of spent fuel storage casks...|$|E
