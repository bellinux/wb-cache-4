At the transmit side multiple users {{are allowed to}} <b>send</b> <b>pulse</b> position modulated signals in a synchronized fashion exploiting a given frequency subband {{in the same time}} intervals. Overlapped data frames sent by distinct users include low data rate training sequences with different repetition periods. This transmission strategy, known as rate division multiple access in the technical literature, allows to ease the first two fundamental tasks at the receive side, namely joint channel estimation and timing synchronization. Channel estimates are exploited by a multiuser detector based on the Viterbi algorithm and separating the contribution generated by the user of interest from those produced by all the other co-channel users. Numerical results evidence that the proposed solution can offer an efficient usage of the available spectrum at the price of a limited complexity...|$|E

The transmitter nodes are assumed to <b>send</b> <b>pulse</b> amplitude modulation (PAM) signals asynchronously, in which information symbols are linearly modulated by a shaping waveform {{to be sent to}} the destination. We consider two different cases with respect to the length of the shaping waveforms in the time domain. In the theoretical case where the shaping waveforms with infinite time support are used, it is shown that asynchronism does not affect the DMT performance of the system and the same DMT as that of the corresponding synchronous network is obtained for all the aforementioned protocols. In the practical case where finite length shaping waveforms are used, it is shown that better diversity gains can be achieved at the expense of bandwidth expansion. In the decode-and-forward (DF) type protocols, the asynchronous network provides better diversity gains than those of the corresponding synchronous network throughout the range of the multiplexing gain. In the amplify-and-forward (AF) type protocols, the asynchronous network provides the same DMT as that of the corresponding synchronous counterpart under the OAF protocol; however, a better diversity gain is achieved under the NAF protocol throughout the range of the multiplexing gain. In particular, in the single relay asynchronous network, the NAF protocol provides the same DMT as that of the 2 × 1 multiple-input single-output (MISO) channel...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{performed}} at Saab Bofors Dynamics in Karlskoga and investigates a technique for ranging with laser pulses. The investigated technique is called Constant Fraction Detection (CFD). Described briefly, the received laser pulse is {{split into two}} equal parts, where one part is delayed half the pulse width and inverted. This signal {{is added to the}} original pulse. The resulting curve has the shape of a laying S and the detection of the zero level is used to stop the time measurement. The time measurement will be independent of the incoming signal’s amplitude. The CFD technique has the advantage of collecting accurate data for each <b>send</b> <b>pulse,</b> which results in an ability to collect values of measurement with a high frequency. The theses investigates a measurement frequency of 10 kHz that will give an opportunity to implement a scanning function with the possibility to, for example, reproduce a ground structure from a flying object. The theses include both digital and analog electronics, which makes it a complex design task. The detector was constructed using analog circuits, from the signal processing of the incoming reflected pulse to the generation of a voltage level as a representation of the distance. The analog part is controlled by digital signals generated by a FPGA, which also performs calculations to convert the voltage level into a distance displayed on a LCD. A large part of the work was dedicated to designing a layout and constructing a surface mounted printed circuit board (PCB) and therefor the report treats the whole development process, from technical requirement to construction and verification of a prototype. The conclusion states that the CFD technique is a suitable technique for ranging with demands on fast collection of data. The prototype has sufficient accuracy at constant amplitude and was at the time of presentation shown as a prototype for demonstration. The independence of amplitude on the incoming signal was never accomplished and {{the reason for this is}} stated in the report. However, further development should solve the problem...|$|E

40|$|Asynchronism {{inherently}} {{exists in}} many communication systems specially in multi-terminal networks mainly {{due to the}} effect of multi-path and propagation delay. While in theoretical analysis of communication systems perfect synchronization of the terminals is often presumed, in some cases in which the nodes are randomly distributed over a geometrical area, it might be impossible to synchronize the nodes even if an ideal infrastructure service provider is used. In this work, two major categories of multi-user communication systems, i. e., relay networks and interference channels, are considered and the effect of the asynchronism among the terminals on characteristic properties of these channels are investigated. In Chapter 2, the construction of distributed space-time codes for a general two-hop asynchronous cooperative relay network is considered. A novel algebraic structure is proposed and shown to achieve full diversity for arbitrary number of relays, arbitrary input alphabets, and arbitrary delay profiles among the relays. Unlike previously proposed delay tolerant schemes, the new design has minimum length which translates into smaller decoding complexity at the same transmission rate. Full-rate and full-diversity are achieved by the new designs with or without the use of guard intervals between successive transmissions. Simulation results confirm the mathematical analysis of the proposed codes. In Chapter 3, the underlying asynchronous network is examined for various relaying protocols such as non-orthogonal selection decode-and-forward, orthogonal selection decode-and-forward, non-orthogonal amplify-and-forward (NAF), and orthogonal amplify-and-forward (OAF). The transmitter nodes <b>send</b> <b>pulse</b> amplitude modulation (PAM) signals, in which information symbols are linearly modulated by a shaping waveform to be sent to the destination, asynchronously. We consider two different cases with respect to the type of the shaping waveforms used {{in the structure of the}} PAM signals. In the theoretical case where band-limited shaping waveforms are used, it is shown that the asynchronism does not affect the DMT performance of the system and the same DMT as that of the corresponding synchronous network is obtained for all the aforementioned protocols. In the practical case where time-limited shaping waveforms are used, it is shown that better diversity gains can be achieved at the expense of a bandwidth expansion. More precisely, in the decode-and-forward type protocols, the asynchronous network provides a better diversity gain than that of the corresponding synchronous network throughout the range of the multiplexing gain. In the amplify-and-forward type protocols, the asynchronous network provides the same DMT as that of the corresponding synchronous counterpart under the OAF protocol; however, a better diversity gain is achieved under the NAF protocol throughout the range of the multiplexing gain. In particular, in the single relay asynchronous network, the NAF protocol provides the same DMT as that of the 2 × 1 multiple-input single-output channel. In Chapter 4, a constant K-user interference channel in which the users are not symbol synchronous is considered. It is shown that the asynchronism among the users does not affect the total number of degrees of freedom (DOF) of this channel; however, it facilitates aligning interfering signals at each receiver node. To achieve the total K/ 2 DOF of this channel when single antenna nodes are used, a novel practical interference alignment scheme is proposed wherein the alignment task is performed with the help of asynchronous delays which inherently exist among the received signals at each receiver node. The asynchronism causes inter-symbol-interference (ISI) among transmitted symbols by different transmitters resulting in the underlying quasi-static links to be converted to ISI and accordingly into time varying channels. It is proved that this conversion solves the lack of channel variation required for the interference alignment in quasi-static scenarios. When each node is equipped with M > 1 antennas, it is argued that the same alignment scheme proposed for the single antenna nodes’ interference channel is sufficient to achieve the total MK/ 2 DOF of the medium provided that each pair of the transmitters and the receivers experience the same asynchronous delay for all the corresponding antennas. In contrast to previously proposed alignment schemes, the channel state information of the links does not need to be known at the transmitter nodes. Instead, the relative delays among the received signals at each receiver node are globally known to the entire network. While the asynchronism is usually treated as a troublesome factor in communication systems, in this dissertation, we are interested to introduce it as a useful property of the wireless medium similar to the fading which can improve the system performance in some communication scenarios or facilitate signaling over the medium in some other scenarios...|$|E
