25|$|Hydroxocobalamin {{is another}} form of B12 {{commonly}} encountered in pharmacology, but which is not normally present in the human body. Hydroxocobalamin is sometimes denoted B12a. This form of B12 is the form produced by bacteria, and is what is converted to cyanocobalmin in the commercial charcoal filtration step of production. Hydroxocobalamin has an avid affinity for cyanide ions and {{has been used as}} an antidote to cyanide poisoning. It is supplied typically in water <b>solution</b> <b>for</b> <b>injection.</b> Hydroxocobalamin is thought to be converted to the active enzymic forms of B12 more easily than cyanocobalamin, and since it is little more expensive than cyanocobalamin, and has longer retention times in the body, has been used for vitamin replacement in situations where added reassurance of activity is desired. Intramuscular administration of hydroxocobalamin is also the preferred treatment for pediatric patients with intrinsic cobalamin metabolic diseases, for vitamin B12 deficient patients with tobacco amblyopia (which is thought to perhaps have a component of cyanide poisoning from cyanide in cigarette smoke); and for treatment of patients with pernicious anemia who have optic neuropathy.|$|E

50|$|AVP is {{administered}} at primovaccination in three doses with a booster dose after six months. The active ingredient is a sterile filtrate of an alum-precipitated anthrax antigen from the Sterne strain in a <b>solution</b> <b>for</b> <b>injection.</b> The other ingredients are aluminium potassium sulphate, sodium chloride and purified water. The preservative is thiomersal (0.005%). The vaccine {{is given by}} intramuscular injection and the primary course of four single injections (3 injections 3 weeks apart, followed by a 6-month dose) {{is followed by a}} single booster dose given once a year. During the Gulf War (1990-1991), UK military personnel were given AVP concomitantly with the pertussis vaccine as an adjuvant to improve overall immune response and efficacy.|$|E
50|$|Nicomorphine (Vilan, Subellan, Gevilan, MorZet) is the 3,6-dinicotinate ester of morphine. It is {{a strong}} opioid agonist {{analgesic}} {{two to three times}} as potent as morphine with a side effect profile similar to that of dihydromorphine, morphine, and diamorphine. Nicomorphine was patented as Vilan by Lannacher Heilmittel G.m.b.H. of Austria in 1957. and was first synthesized in 1904 either there or at another firm in what was then Austria-Hungary. The hydrochloride salt is available as ampoules of 10 mg/ml <b>solution</b> <b>for</b> <b>injection,</b> 5 mg tablets, and 10 mg suppositories. It is possible that other manufacturers distribute 10 mg tablets and other concentrations of injectable nicomorphine in ampoules and multidose vials. It is used, particularly in the German-speaking countries and elsewhere in Central Europe and some other countries in Europe and the former USSR in particular, for post-operative, cancer, chronic non-malignant and other neuropathic pain. It is commonly used in patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) units. The usual starting dose is 5-10 mg given every 3-5 hours.|$|E
40|$|A {{limited number}} of {{researches}} {{have been reported to}} apply the Arrhenius equation to study the relationship between drugs and its degradation products so far. In the present work, the thermal degradation kinetics of lysine hydrochloride <b>solutions</b> <b>for</b> <b>injection,</b> the special solvent for ademetionine 1, 4 -butanedisulfonate (SAM) <b>for</b> <b>injection,</b> was investigated at selected temperatures and pH values. The main degradation product of lysine was separated, purified, and confirmed as lysine lactam. A reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatographic (RP-HPLC) method without derivation was developed for the simultaneous determination of lysine and lysine lactam. The results confirmed that both the lysine degradation and lysine lactam generation followed zero-order reaction kinetics. The degradation and generation rate constants increased with increasing temperatures and decreasing pH values. The temperature-dependent degradation and generation reaction could be sufficiently modeled on the Arrhenius equation with the activation energy of 80. 14 and 83. 22  kJ/mol, respectively. Meanwhile, a linear relationship existed between the amount of lysine degradation and lysine lactam generation since the approximate activation energy. Considering there could be other side effects, we established an upper limit of lysine lactam (500  μg/ml), as the acceptable criteria for stability to estimate the shelf life together with lysine, which made the prediction more accurate and credible. Extrapolation data demonstrated that the lysine hydrochloride <b>solutions</b> <b>for</b> <b>injection</b> could be stable for two years stored at room temperature...|$|R
