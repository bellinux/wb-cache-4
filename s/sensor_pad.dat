40|$|We {{present an}} {{intuitive}} animation interface {{that uses a}} foot pressure <b>sensor</b> <b>pad</b> to interactively control avatars for video games, virtual reality, and low-cost performance-driven animation. During an offline training phase, we capture full body motions with a motion capture system, {{as well as the}} corresponding foot-ground pressure distributions with a pressure <b>sensor</b> <b>pad,</b> into a database. At run time, the user acts out the animation desired on the pressure <b>sensor</b> <b>pad.</b> The system then tries to “see ” the motion only through the foot-ground interactions measured, and the most appropriate motions from the database are selected, and edited online to drive the avatar. We describe our motion recognition, motion blending, and inverse kinematics algorithms in detail. They are easy to implement, and cheap to compute. FootSee can control a virtual avatar in a fixed latency of 1 second with reasonable accuracy. Our system thus makes it possible to create interactive animations without the cost or inconveniences of a full body motion capture system.

40|$|Abstract. With {{the gradual}} {{rise in the}} {{proportion}} of the aging population, the world has entered the aging society. Thus, the assessments of service to care receivers and home sleep quality have attracted more emphasis and attention of the medical sector. The actuation principle is to apply a load on the upper sensor film, which touches an external electronic control device to form the micro-current conduction. Thus the movement information of care receivers getting into or out of bed are provided, and then through the device itself or emergency call device of the nursing station, warnings to the care receiver and other functions are given. This research aimed to understand the relationships of positive load, and repeated load of the <b>sensor</b> <b>pad</b> to resistance; and at the last course of the experiment, SEM and AFM were used to observe the change of oil ink organization {{on the surface of the}} sensor film before and after the experiment as an amendment parameter for subsequent designs of the <b>sensor</b> <b>pad.</b> Future research directions for the flexible pressure <b>sensor</b> <b>pad</b> can be aimed at detecting body pressure distribution, assessment of sleep quality, and so on...|$|E

An Atmospheric Diving Suit is a one person anthropomorphic pressure vessel, with manually operated maneuverable appendages, capable of carrying a diver to great depths in the sea while maintaining the internal cabin pressure at one atmosphere (14. 7 psi). Commercial ADS are used regularly around the world in offshore industries, and military ADS are used by a large number of navies for submarine rescue capabilities. This study specifically investigates the performance of the arm rotary joints on the OceanWorks International HARDSUITTM rated for use as deep as 1200 feet of seawater, that are owned and operated by Phoenix International.

Experiments were conducted with four different pilots, each performing a series of deliberate, repetitive arm motions while submerged in a shallow training pool. Each pilot was outfitted with a pressure <b>sensor</b> <b>pad</b> placed on the wrist at the major contact region with the appendage, and a series of inertial measurement units (IMUs) placed along the arm and suit.

40|$|Booksh, Karl S. Surface plasmon {{resonance}} (SPR) spectroscopy is {{a rapidly}} growing field for chemical detection. Various SPR sensor architectures can offer high sensitivity, tunability and selectivity {{over a wide range}} of applications. Enhancements to this technique are obtained by introducing novel and modified designs capable of probing different optical regions. The contributing efforts of this dissertation aim to identify and characterize several of these platforms for use in real-world sensing applications. Herein, three basic types of SPR architectures are developed, conducting polymers as a replacement for conventional materials, a MIR-SPR <b>sensor</b> <b>pad</b> and composite-SPR sensors for selective applications. Conductive polymers represent an exciting addition to plasmonics as they offer new ways to apply SPR sensing for a reduced cost, in particular Polyaniline (PAni) has been identified in literature a possible candidate for SPR. In this dissertation several deposition methods for PAni are presented to obtain specific film parameters capable of supporting plasmonic behavior, including vacuum deposition and solution cast methods. Vacuum deposition methods exhibit good control over the thin film parameters, with roughness values (R RMS) as low as 0. 5 nm and a reduced amount of observable pin-holes. Additionally, the deposition methods described herein are applicable to the demonstration of polymer plasmonics as well the improvement of non-plasmonic applications of conducting polymers. Theoretical modelling reveals that certain films demonstrate sufficient sensitivity (~ 3770 nm/RIU) for SPR sensor applications. Experimental validation performed in this dissertation does not substantiate theoretical evidence, however identifies innate difficulties is the experimental demonstration and will be essential for subsequent investigations. In an attempt to expand SPR to different analytes and demonstrate a highly tunable sensor, a MIR-SPR sensing pad is developed with the capability of probing various regions within a single sample. The sensitivities and plasmonic characteristics are quantified over the MIR region with the highest sensitivities occurring between 2800 cm - 1 and 2250 cm- 1 (~ 15, 200 +/- 2. 2 nm/RIU). For specific MIR wavelength regimes, a 22 +/- 4 % deviation is observed from theoretical values. Furthermore, discrepancies for determining the theoretical probing depth are identified and alleviated with a more robust method to verify experimental values with theoretical predictions. Finally, composite SPR materials are designed to promote further selectivity and tunability for SPR devices. Initially, a coupled waveguide plasmon resonance MIR-sensor is described that suggests high variability within the MIR regime and is successfully applied to quantitative and qualitative hydrocarbon detection in the ppb range. Moreover, a selective plasmon-plasmon sensor is optimized towards enhancement of sensitivity and modulation of signal by means of plasmon coupling. The optimization of a component parts reveals good tunability for future coupling experiments. Additionally, a deposition method for carbon nano-tubes (CNTs) is validated as a potential substrate for plasmonic coupling. Ultimately the studies described in this dissertation attempt to expand SPR spectroscopy to a wider array of analytes and increase the performance merits of SPR sensors.

However, pressure within the solar metrology industry to report the spectral performance of the device earlier in the manufacturing process as part of the process control loop requires that a new non-contact method be developed.
