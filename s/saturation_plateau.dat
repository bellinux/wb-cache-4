Thirty micromolar cyanide strongly inhibited dark respiration, was without effect on photosynthesis at high light intensities (above the <b>saturation</b> <b>plateau</b> values), and stimulated photosynthesis at low light intensities (below the <b>saturation</b> <b>plateau</b> values). Three hundred nanomolar DCMU inhibited the photosynthesis and was without effect, even under light conditions, {{on the dark}} respiration.

In the case of the mixture of n-hexane−benzene, the <b>saturation</b> <b>plateau</b> is located between those obtained after adsorption of the single components. This is an indication that the coadsorption of n-hexane and benzene does not occur at the expense of one component of the mixture. However, the kinetics of adsorption of the mixture shows that benzene is adsorbed preferentially at low coverage.

This may be traced back, in past models, {{to the lack of}} account of the first stages of nucleation, size dependence of the growth law, and full particle population. Computational method: A microscopic description of the nucleation and growth of amorphous silica nanoparticles is achieved which reproduces a large set of experimental measurements, under various thermodynamic conditions. The time evolution of the solution supersaturation and of the precipitate characteristics is established. Findings : A growth law of order 6 allows reproducing experimental results, without being correlated to the presence of silica oligomers in the aqueous solution. The <b>saturation</b> <b>plateaus</b> are shown not to be due to an induction period. The characteristics of the particle population are more complex than assumed by simple precipitation models (Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov or Chronomal models) and strongly depend on how supersaturation is reached.

Similar statement holds for many other magnetization plateaus supporting nonmagnetic gapless excitations encountered in 1 D electron/spin systems in the absence of special symmetries or features responsible for the mode decoupling.

We employed a statistical test of correlations between tree species density and environmental maps, by generating Monte Carlo simulations of random raster images that preserve autocorrelation of the original maps. Nearly three fourths of the 94 taxa {{with at least one}} stem per ha showed a significant correlation between tree density and relative elevation, revealing contrasted species-habitat associations in term of abundance, with seasonally inundated bottomlands (24. 5 % of species) and well-drained plateaus (48. 9 % of species). We also observed species preferences for environments with or without steep slopes (13. 8 % and 10. 6 %, respectively). We observed that closely-related species were frequently associated with different soil habitats in this region (70 % of the 14 genera with congeneric species that have a significant association test) suggesting species-habitat associations have arisen multiple times in this tree community. We also tested if species with similar habitat preferences shared functional strategies. We found that seasonally inundated forest specialists tended to have smaller stature (maximum diameter) than species found on plateaus. Our results underline the importance of tree-soil habitat associations in structuring diverse communities at fine spatial scales and suggest that additional studies are needed to disentangle community assembly mechanisms related to dispersal limitation, biotic interactions and environmental filtering from species-habitat associations. Moreover, they provide a framework to generalize across tropical forest sites. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|This article {{considers}} {{recent advances}} {{in the investigation of}} the thermal and magnetic properties of integrable spin ladder models and their applicability to the physics of strong coupling ladder compounds. For this class of compounds the rung coupling J perpendicular to is much stronger than the coupling J parallel to along the ladder legs. The ground state properties of the integrable two-leg spin- 1 / 2 and the mixed spin-(12, 1) ladder models at zero temperature are analysed by means of the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz (TBA). Solving the TBA equations yields exact results for the critical. elds and critical behaviour. The thermal and magnetic properties of the models are discussed in terms of the recently introduced High Temperature Expansion (HTE) method, which is reviewed in detail. In the strong coupling region the integrable spin- 1 / 2 ladder model exhibits three quantum phases: (i) a gapped phase in the regime H H-c 2 = J perpendicular to + 4 J parallel to, and (iii) a Luttinger liquid magnetic phase in the regime H-c 1 < H < H-c 2. The critical behaviour {{in the vicinity of the}} critical points H-c 1 and H-c 2 is of Pokrovsky- Talapov type. The temperature-dependent thermal and magnetic properties are directly evaluated from the exact free energy expression and compared to known experimental results for the strong coupling ladder compounds (5 IAP) (2) CuBr 4 center dot 2 H(2) O, Cu- 2 (C 5 H 12 N 2) (2) Cl- 4, (C 5 H 12 N) (2) CuBr 4, BIP-BNO and [Cu- 2 (C 2 O 2) (C 10 H 8 N 2) (2)) ](NO 3) (2).

For weak rung coupling, the fractional magnetization plateau is diminished and a new quantum phase transition occurs.

40|$|One of the {{fundamental}} problems in neurobiology is to understand the cellular mechanism for sustained neuronal activity (neuronal UP states). Prefrontal pyramidal neurons readily switch to a long-lasting depolarized state after suprathreshold stimulation of basal dendrites. Analysis of the dendritic input–output function revealed that basal dendrites operate in a somewhat binary regimen (DOWN or UP) {{in regard to the}} amplitude of the glutamate-evoked electrical signal. Although the amplitude of the dendritic potential quickly becomes saturated (dendritic UP state), basal dendrites preserve their ability to code additional increase in glutamatergic input. Namely, after the <b>saturation</b> of the <b>plateau</b> amplitude, an additional increase in excitatory input is interpreted as an increase in plateau duration. Experiments performed in tetrodotoxin indicate that the maintenance of a stable depolarized state does not require inhibitory inputs to “balance” the excitation. In the absence of action potential-dependent (network-driven) GABAergic transmission, pyramidal neurons respond to brief (5 ms) glutamate pulses with stable long-lasting (~ 500 ms) depolarizations. Voltage-sensitive dye recordings revealed that this somatic plateau depolarization is precisely time-locked with the regenerative dendritic plateau potential. The somatic plateau rises a few milliseconds after the onset of the dendritic transient and collapses with the breakdown of the dendritic plateau depolarization. In our in vitro model, the stable long-lasting somatic depolarization (UP state like) is a direct consequence of the local processing of a strong excitatory glutamatergic input arriving on the basal dendrite. The slow component of the somatic depolarization accurately mirrors the glutamate-evoked dendritic plateau potential (dendritic UP state) ...|$|R

A Monte Carlo Fission Chamber Designer (MCFCD) has been developed in order to assist engineers in the complete design cycle of the fission chambers. So far MCFCD focuses on the most important neutron reactions taking place in a thermal nuclear reactor. A theoretical model describing the most important outcomes in fission chambers design has been developed, including the expected electrical signals (current intensity and drop in potential) and, current-polarization voltage characteristics (sensitivity and saturation plateau); the <b>saturation</b> <b>plateau</b> is the zone of the saturation curve where the output current is proportional to fission rate; fission chambers work in this region. Data provided by MCFCD are in good agreement with measurements available...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} ocean {{acidification}} {{caused by the}} increasing atmospheric CO 2 has been studied in marine calcifiers, including hermatypic corals. However, the effect of elevated pCO 2 on the early developmental life-cycle stage of corals has been little studied. In this study, we reared polyps of Acropora digitifera in seawater at pHT 6. 55, 7. 31, 7. 64, 7. 77, and 8. 03, controlled by CO 2 bubbling. We measured the dry weights of polyp skeletons after the 40 -d experiment to investigate {{the relationship between the}} seawater aragonite saturation state and polyp growth. In addition, we measured skeletal U/Ca ratio to estimate their pH dependence. Skeletal weights of coral polyps increased with the aragonite saturation state and reached an apparent <b>saturation</b> <b>plateau</b> above pH 7. 77. U/Ca ratios had a strong inverse relationship with pH and a negligible relationship with skeletal growth rate (polyp weight), suggesting that skeletal U/Ca could be useful for reconstructing paleo-pH...|$|E
40|$|Optical {{coatings}} of disordered {{thin film}} SiO 2 /SiOx dielectric samples on reflective metal substrates exhibited cathodoluminescence under electron beam irradiation. Measurements {{of the absolute}} radiance and emission spectra as functions of incident electron energy, flux and power over a range of sample temperatures are reported. Radiance reached a <b>saturation</b> <b>plateau</b> at high incident electron power. Well below saturation radiance scaled with deposited power, that is linearly with incident power for lower-energy non-penetrating electrons and decreasing with increasing energy for penetrating radiation. Four bands were observed in spectral measurements from 300 nm to 1000 nm. Changes in peak intensity and shifts in peak energies as functions of temperature are described. The observations are {{explained in terms of}} a simple disordered band theory model and the transitions that take place between electrons in extended conduction states and localized trapped states associated with structural or compositional defects in the highly disordered insulating materials; this provides a fundamental basis for understanding the dependence of cathodoluminescence on irradiation time, incident flux and energy, and sample thickness and temperature...|$|E
40|$|Fatigue {{of copper}} single crystals, {{oriented}} for single slip, {{has been studied}} using electron channelling contrast imaging (ECCI) in a scanning electron microscope. This technique was used to detect and characterize dislocation structures in bulk specimens. With the incident beam set at the Bragg condition, changes in the backscattered electron intensity occur as the beam is scanned over dislocations which cause a local tilting of the diffraction planes. ECCI observations on specimens fatigued up to the <b>saturation</b> <b>plateau</b> (resolved shear stress τS = 28 MPa) show that the dislocation substructures, principally ladder structures and elongated cells, are identical to those observed using transmission electron microscopy on thin foils. One of the main advantages of the ECCI technique is that one can follow all stages of the formation and evolution of dislocation structures over large areas in the same bulk specimen during fatigue interrupted {{at different stages of}} the fatigue life. ECCI should prove a powerful tool for investigating dislocation configurations at crack tips or at extrusions/intrusions or persistent slip band systems. © 1997 Taylor and Francis Ltd...|$|E
