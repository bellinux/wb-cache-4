50|$|<b>Shift</b> <b>by</b> <b>wire</b> is {{the system}} by which the {{transmission}} modes are engaged/changed in an automobile through electronic controls without any mechanical linkage between the gear shifting lever and the transmission. The transmission shifting was traditionally accomplished by mechanical links to put the vehicle in Park, Reverse, Neutral and Drive positions through a lever mounted on the steering column or a gear shifter near the center console.|$|E

50|$|A park by wire system {{engages the}} parking pawl of a {{transmission}} using electrical means. This {{can also be}} considered as part of a <b>shift</b> <b>by</b> <b>wire</b> system whose objective is to put the vehicle in Park, Reverse, Neutral and Drive modes without the traditional mechanical system which involves linkages between the gear shifter and the transmission. The main components of a park by wire system include the driver interface which could be a lever, switch or knob as designed by the OEM (input), an electronic control unit to host the control system and actuators (one or two motors) which are capable of driving the parking pawl {{into and out of the}} locking position with the parking gear of the transmission.|$|E
5000|$|With {{the advent}} of drive by wire (or more properly, <b>shift</b> <b>by</b> <b>wire)</b> {{computer}} controlled transmissions (particularly {{in the case of}} automatics), the gear stick no longer needs to be mechanically connected to the transmission unit itself, and can therefore be made much smaller since {{there is no need to}} package either remote mechanisms or complex interlocking arrangements. This has allowed designers to replace the gear stick completely with either buttons, rotary knobs (current Jaguar and Range Rover models are good examples of this), or a miniaturized gear stick on the centre console. This can be seen in the Toyota Prius and some Audis, BMWs and the Lincoln Continental. Japanese finger shift is another example. It is a revival of an approach used in the 1950s by the Chrysler push button PowerFlite and the Packard Touchbutton Ultramatic.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Safety and {{reliability}} are requirements of automobile steer <b>by</b> <b>wire</b> system. Firstly, steering force feedback subsystem of steer <b>by</b> <b>wire</b> is designed. Design of steer <b>by</b> <b>wire</b> system mechanical parts must consider effects of automobile vibration environment. Then, worm of worm drive speed reducer is modeled using ANSYS software and modal analysis is performed. Natural frequencies and vibration mode contour maps of each order are acquired. The {{results show that}} the modal analysis of worm is valid and can predict worm’s vibration performance; both structure and material affect the part’s vibration performances...|$|R
40|$|In the {{automotive}} industry the safety critical systems in cars are increasing. These systems are called X <b>by</b> <b>Wire</b> system and their purpose is to assist the driver in different situations. These systems must be fail operational as they are deemed safety critical. If the system develops a fault, it might have catastrophic consequences such as injury or death of humans. I have looked closer on one of them, the “Brake <b>by</b> <b>Wire</b> system ” {{which is based on}} a time-trigged protocol. The purpose of this thesis has been to study the Brake <b>by</b> <b>Wire</b> system and the ABS application. A part of this thesis has been dedicated the study of the communication system, the time trigged TTP/C real time communication protocol and compare it with two other time trigged solutions, TTCAN and FlexRay.
