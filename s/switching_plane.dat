The approach taken allows the vector field to be discontinuous on the <b>switching</b> <b>plane.</b> In this framework, verifiable necessary and sufficient conditions are proposed for global asymptotic stability of bimodal systems being considered.

With the development of network functions virtualization, operators make lots of effort to achieve router virtualization by using general servers. In order to ensure high performance, virtual router platform usually adopts a cluster of general servers, which can be also regarded as a special cloud computing environment. However, due to frequent creation and deletion of router instances, it may generate lots of resource fragmentation to prevent platform from establishing new router instances. In order to solve “resource fragmentation problem,” we firstly propose VR-Cluster, which introduces two extra function planes including <b>switching</b> <b>plane</b> and resource management plane. <b>Switching</b> <b>plane</b> is mainly used to support seamless migration of router instances without packet loss; resource management plane can dynamically move router instances from one server to another server by using VR-mapping algorithms. Besides, three VR-mapping algorithms including first-fit mapping algorithm, best-fit mapping algorithm, and worst-fit mapping algorithm are proposed based on VR-Cluster. At last, we establish VR-Cluster protosystem by using general X 86 servers, evaluate its migration time, and further analyze advantages and disadvantages of our proposed VR-mapping algorithms to solve resource fragmentation problem...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The rapid {{increase}} in Internet traffic is forcing packet routers to grow in capacity to meet the demand. Optical packet routers with less buffering and {{a greater degree of}} optical transparency are actively being researched as a way to improve energy efficiency and capacity scaling over traditional electronic routers. Since it is difficult to buffer packets in the optical domain, in this paper we analyze the performance of a hybrid optoelectronic packet router. The router architecture has multiple optical <b>switch</b> <b>planes</b> and a shared electronic buffer to resolve output-port contention. By using multiple ports on the <b>switch</b> <b>planes</b> for each input and output fiber, and by using some switch-plane ports to inter-connect the planes, we can achieve a relatively low packet loss ratio in a router with no buffer. In this case, most traffic can be switched using only the through optical paths of the router without entering the shared buffer. The shared electronic buffer is primarily used to reduce the packet drop ratio under periods of heavy loads and occasionally for optical regeneration of a packet. We run extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of the router with varying number of <b>switch</b> <b>plane</b> ports, number of connections to the electronic buffer, and number of interconnections between the <b>switch</b> <b>planes.</b> We show that the router can provide good throughput, with realistic on-off bursty traffic and asynchronous packet arrivals.

However, {{the capability of}} switching and routing information at this high bandwidth (e. g., 1 Terabids) has been behind the transmission capability. Building a large-capacity switching system using only electronic technology may potentially lead a system bottleneck in interconnecting many electronic devices or modules, mainly caused by enormous interconnection wires and electromagnetic interference among them. We have explored the possibility of switching ATM cells in optical domain by prototyping a WDM ATM Multicast (3 M) switch [2]. By taking the advantages of both optical and electronic technologies, we have constructed two planes, optical <b>switching</b> <b>plane</b> and electronic control plane. ATM cells are routed through the optical <b>switching</b> <b>plane,</b> while their headers are extracted and processed in the electronic plane that controls the optical devices and routes the cells to proper output port(s).

40|$|A new ATM switch called {{wrapped around}} {{multiple}} (WAM) banyan network is proposed in this paper. A WAM banyan switch is constructed using 2 d × 2 d switch elements. It consists of K parallel banyan <b>switch</b> <b>planes</b> and a packet {{is allowed to}} switch/overflow from one <b>switch</b> <b>plane</b> to another when packet contention occurs. This degree of freedom is provided by connecting the d logically equivalent output links from a switch element to d logically equivalent switch elements in the next stage, one in each plane. To further enhance the performance of this switch design, packet broadcasting is used together with priority switching. It is found that under full loading, a WAM banyan switch with K = R = d = 3 can have a packet loss probability Ploss ≤ 10 - 6 for a switch with size up to 4096 × 4096.

40|$|Most of the {{existing}} all-optical switching paradigms assume different wavelengths are switched independently, and hence require W switching planes at each core switch, where W {{is the number of}} wavelengths that an optical fiber can carry. As W is becoming as large as a few hundreds in the near future, the above requirement limits the scalability of core switches. In this paper, we present a novel all-optical switching paradigm, called optical cell switching (OCS), for the next-generation optical network. By time-division multiplexing (TDM), time in OCS is divided into time slots of fixed size, and every F consecutive time slots constitute a frame. Fine bandwidth granularity can be achieved by increasing F. The wavelengths in a time slot are all bundled, and each time slot is called an optical composite cell (OCC). The OCC is the switching unit in the OCS network. Therefore, each OCS core switch (OCX) requires only one <b>switching</b> <b>plane</b> and performs mere time-space switching, thus simplifying the management and reducing the implementation complexity of the OCX. Nevertheless, traffic can be aggregated at edge routers and groomed in the wavelength domain before entering the OCS core network. The OCS network can support both guaranteed and best-effort services. Optical time-slot interchangers (OTSIs) can be employed to further improve the performance of OCS. We provide simulation results to show that the OCS network can achieve low call-blocking rate for guaranteed services, and low cell-loss rate for besteffort services...|$|E

Simulation is even more critical to study future many-core architectures as it provides the opportunity to assess currently non-existing computer systems. In this thesis, a multiprocessor simulator is presented based on a cycle accurate architecture simulator called SESC. The shared L 2 cache system is extended into a distributed shared cache (DSC) with a directory-based cache coherency protocol. A mesh network module is extended and integrated into SESC to replace the bus for scalable inter-processor communication. While these efforts complete an extended multiprocessor simulation infrastructure, two interconnection enhancements are proposed and evaluated. A novel non-uniform fat-mesh network structure similar {{to the idea of}} fat-tree is proposed. This non-uniform mesh network takes advantage of the average traffic pattern, typically all-to-all in DSC, to dedicate additional links for connections with heavy traffic (e. g., near the center) and fewer links for lighter traffic (e. g., near the periphery). Two fat-mesh schemes are implemented based on different routing algorithms. Analytical fat-mesh models are constructed by presenting the expressions for the traffic requirements of personalized all-to-all traffic. Performance improvements over the uniform mesh are demonstrated in the results from the simulator. A hybrid network consisting of one packet <b>switching</b> <b>plane</b> and multiple circuit switching planes is constructed as the second enhancement. The circuit switching planes provide fast paths between neighbors with heavy communication traffic.

40|$|Today the {{telecommunication}} {{market is}} faced with the situation that customers are requesting for new telecommunication services, especially value added services. The concept of Next Generation Networks (NGN) {{seems to be a}} solution for this, so this concept finds its way into the telecommunication area. These customer expectations have emerged in the context of NGN and the associated migration of the telecommunication networks from traditional circuit-switched towards packet-switched networks. One fundamental aspect of the NGN concept is to outsource the intelligence of services from the <b>switching</b> <b>plane</b> onto separated Service Delivery Platforms using SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) to provide the required signalling functionality. Caused by this migration process towards NGN SIP has appeared as the major signalling protocol for IP (Internet Protocol) based NGN. This will lead in contrast to ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) and IN (Intelligent Network) to significantly lower dependences among the network and services and enables to implement new services much easier and faster. In addition, further concepts from the IT (Information Technology) namely SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture) have largely influenced the telecommunication sector forced by amalgamation of IT and telecommunications. The benefit of applying SOA in telecommunication services is the acceleration of service creation and delivery. Main features of the SOA are that services are reusable, discoverable combinable and independently accessible from any location. Integration of those features offers a broader flexibility and efficiency for varying demands on services. This thesis proposes a novel framework for service provisioning and composition in SIP-based peer-to-peer networks applying the principles of SOA. One key contribution of the framework is the approach to enable the provisioning and composition of services which is performed by applying SIP. Based on this, the framework provides a flexible and fast way to request the creation for composite services. Furthermore the framework enables to request and combine multimodal value-added services, which means that they are no longer limited regarding media types such as audio, video and text. The proposed framework has been validated by a prototype implementation...|$|E
