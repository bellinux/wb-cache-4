Watts {{released}} two jazz albums; Wood recorded his fifth solo album, the first in 11 years, called <b>Slide</b> <b>On</b> This, Wyman released his fourth solo album, Richards released his second solo album in late 1992, Main Offender, and did a small tour including big concerts in Spain and Argentina. Jagger got good reviews and sales with his third solo album, Wandering Spirit (UK 12; US 11). The album sold {{more than two million}} copies worldwide, going gold in the US.|$|E
5|$|Miami {{got off to}} a {{good start}} doing just that as it raced out to four {{consecutive}} wins to begin the season, including a victory over nationally ranked rival No. 9 Florida State. On October 11, however, Miami traveled to South Bend, Indiana, to face the Notre Dame Fighting Irish and suffered its first loss of the season to the undefeated Irish, who would go on to be ranked No. 1 in the country. This defeat was followed in succession by two others, but the Hurricanes were able to stop the <b>slide</b> <b>on</b> November 8 with a homecoming win over East Carolina. Miami added two more wins before the end of the season, and brought the regular season to a close with an overall record of 83.|$|E
5|$|During the 2014–15 season, the Raptors {{were off}} to their best start in {{franchise}} history: a then-Eastern Conference-leading 24–8 record {{by the end of}} 2014. On March 27, 2015, the Raptors clinched the Atlantic division title with a 94–83 win over the Los Angeles Lakers. This was the second consecutive year that the Raptors clinched the Atlantic Division title. On April 11, 2015, the Raptors beat the Miami Heat, Toronto's first road win over the Heat since November 19, 2008, ending a ten-game <b>slide</b> <b>on</b> Miami's home floor. The win was Toronto's 48th of the season and 22nd on the road, both tying franchise records. Four days later, the Raptors broke their franchise record with their 49th win of the season. After the 2014–15 season, Louis Williams won the NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award, becoming the first Raptor to do so. The Raptors faced the Washington Wizards {{in the first round of}} the 2015 playoffs, and lost four straight games as the Wizards swept the Raptors.|$|E

40|$|Sliding {{friction}} and wear experiments were conducted at light loads (25 to 250 g) with various molecular weights of the polyethylene oxide polymer <b>sliding</b> <b>on</b> itself and iron. Results {{of the experimental}} investigation indicate that: (1) the coefficient of friction for the polymer decreases with increasing molecular weight; (2) friction coefficient is higher for the polymer <b>sliding</b> <b>on</b> itself {{than it is for}} the polymer <b>sliding</b> <b>on</b> iron; (3) at sufficiently high loads localized surface melting occurs and the friction coefficient is the same for the polymer <b>sliding</b> <b>on</b> itself and iron; (4) fracture cracks develop in the sliding wear track at higher but not lower sliding velocities, reflecting a strain rate sensitivity to crack initiation, and (5) the friction coefficient for the polymer <b>sliding</b> <b>on</b> iron increases with the formation of a polymer film on the iron surface...|$|R
5|$|On 21 February 2007, a Class 73 derailed {{after hitting}} an {{avalanche}} between Hallingskeid and Myrdal on the Bergen Line. The accident {{raised questions about}} the class's abilities to handle hard snow, such as in avalanches. In particular, a DNV report from 1999 had shown that the train could act as a sled, lose contact with the tracks and <b>slide</b> <b>on</b> top of the snow. A former NSB employee who worked with route planning, stated that a locomotive-hauled train would be better suitable for such situations, because more of the weight is located {{at the front of the}} train, and it will therefore plow instead of slide. The National Rail Administration said that they took extra precautions for the Class 73 trains and that during snowfall they would run a snow-clearing unit ahead of all Class 73 runs. NSB stated that they would consider the possibility of reverting to conventional trains, but that unless new information could shed light on the situation, they would retain use of the Class 73 trains.|$|E

Buried tanks and manholes may float in the liquefied soil due to buoyancy. Earth embankments such as flood levees and earth dams may lose stability or collapse if the material comprising the embankment or its foundation liquefies.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, {{teams in}} western Canada formed the Pacific Coast Hockey Association in 1911. This league created new designs and rules that helped ice hockey evolve {{into the game}} it is today. Some of these new {{innovations}} that were created were blue lines that were painted under the ice which divided the ice into three sections, goaltenders are allowed to fall and <b>slide</b> <b>on</b> the ice to help prevent the other team from scoring a goal, forward passing is permitted in the neutral zone, and the game was split into three periods of 20 minutes. In 1912, the game changed again {{reducing the number of}} on-ice players to six players from the previous seven.|$|E
25|$|While it was {{excellently}} {{adapted to}} swimming and diving, Baptornis {{is thought to}} have been clumsy on land, pushing itself along the rocks with its feet rather than actually walking. The natural position of the lower legs was flush against the body, with the feet stretched out sideways and thus it would have been unable to move upright without toppling over. As opposed to Hesperornis which almost certainly had to <b>slide</b> <b>on</b> its belly or galumph like an earless seal, Baptorniss lower leg was not as firmly placed along the body sides. Thus, it would have found it more easy to place its feet under its body with the toes pointing forwards and might have managed small hops or even an awkward waddle, body held low to the ground.|$|E

25|$|The fourth {{match was}} between the Intercontinental Champion Jeff Hardy and Randy Orton for Orton's WWE Championship. Early in the match, Hardy {{performed}} a Baseball <b>Slide</b> <b>on</b> Orton who hit head-first into the barricade outside due to the impact. Knowing he couldn't win the WWE Championship via a countout victory, Hardy brought the knocked-out Orton into the ring. Later, Orton took advantage in the match, as he applied a Body Scissors on Hardy, followed by a choke-hold. Some of the other main highlights of the match were Hardy performing a Whisper in the Wind on Orton; and, laterexecuting a Moonsault from the top-rope to Orton outside the ring. When Hardy brought Orton back in the ring and tried to deliver a Twist of Fate, Orton suddenly reversed it into an RKO and pinned Hardy to retain his WWE title.|$|E
25|$|Muviro (Kevin Michael Richardson) - a treacherous Waziri warrior {{and one of}} Basuli's subordinates. Despite serving for Basuli, Muviro holds a {{personal}} hatred and jealousy against the chief's son, and is hostile towards outsiders (mainly Tarzan and his friends). Upon learning that Basuli is planning to get an eagle's feather with Tarzan's help {{as part of the}} customs for Basuli to marry and be future chief, Muviro secretly plotted to dispose of Basuli so that he himself can be the new chief. He caused several incidents during Tarzan and Basuli's journey: such as chopping down a tree into a river they were crossing over, disturbing a herd of rhinos to stampede after the duo and causing a rock <b>slide</b> <b>on</b> them in an elephant graveyard near the mountain. After the third attempt fails, Muviro reveals his true colors to both Tarzan and Basuli before engaging into a fight with the latter. Fortunately, Basuli defeats Muviro and banishes him from the tribe for his treachery, and Muviro is last seen walking away into the midst with an angry look on his face, implying that he might return to get revenge.|$|E

500|$|Graphically, Wave Race 64 {{was praised}} for its fluid animations, {{realistic}} physics, clean waters, and textured polygons. IGN's Doug Perry commented, [...] "The {{way in which}} jetskis cut into the ocean's surface, lift off ramps, bounce into and off oncoming waves, or <b>slide</b> <b>on</b> icy surfaces is not only believable and engaging, but simply unparalleled." [...] Writing for The Electric Playground, Victor Lucas highlighted the game's distinct environments, saying that each course offers players something to get excited about. He also gave high marks to the game's satisfying sound effects, particularly when players submerge under the waves, but described the music as [...] "undeniably shallow". GamePro agreed, describing the music as juvenile and the announcer's voice as irritating. In contrast, AllGame's Jonti Davies felt that the game's [...] "cheesy" [...] and [...] "distinctly '80s theme" [...] soundtrack combined with the announcer's [...] "hyperexcited cries" [...] gives the game a light and arcade feel.|$|E
