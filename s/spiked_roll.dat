60|$|Saying {{this in a}} {{sufficiently}} positive manner, Capt. Stephen <b>Spike</b> <b>rolled</b> up the wharf, much as a ship goes off before the wind, now inclining to the right, and then again to the left. The gait of the man would have proclaimed him a sea-dog, to any one acquainted with that animal, {{as far as he}} could be seen. The short squab figure, the arms bent nearly at right angles at the elbow, and working like two fins with each roll of the body, the stumpy, solid legs, with the feet looking in the line of his course and kept wide apart, would all have contributed to the making up of such an opinion. Accustomed as he was to this beautiful sight, Harry Mulford kept his eyes riveted on the retiring person of his commander, until it disappeared behind a pile of lumber, waddling always in the direction of the more thickly peopled parts of the town. Then he turned and gazed at the steamer, which, by this time, had fairly passed the brig, and seemed to be actually bound through the Gate. That steamer was certainly a noble-looking craft, but our young man fancied she struggled along through the water heavily. She might be quick at need, but she did not promise as much by her present rate of moving. Still, she was a noble-looking craft, and, as Mulford descended to the deck again, he almost regretted he did not belong to her; or, at least, to anything but the Molly Swash.|$|R

50|$|Gerard's martyrdom {{took place}} on 24 September 1046, during the Vata pagan uprising. His co-martyrs were Bystrik and Buldus. There are various {{accounts}} of his death. According to one, he was stoned, pierced with a lance, and his body thrown from the Blocksburg cliff into the Danube. An alternate account claims that he was placed on a two-wheel cart, hauled to the hilltop and rolled down a hill of Buda, now named Gellert Hill, then still being alive at the bottom, was beaten to death. Other unverified tales report him as being put into a <b>spiked</b> barrel and <b>rolled</b> down the hill during a mass revolt of pagans.|$|R
60|$|However, the Romans, {{after several}} {{disasters}} in Sicily, gained {{a great victory}} near Panormus, capturing one hundred elephants, which were brought to Rome to be hunted by {{the people that they}} might lose their fear of them. The Carthaginians were weakened enough to desire peace, and they sent Regulus to propose it, making him swear to return if he did not succeed. He came to the outskirts of the city, but would not enter. He said he was no Roman proconsul, but the slave of Carthage. However, the Senate came out to hear him, and he gave the message, but added that the Romans ought not to accept these terms, but to stand out for much better ones, giving such reasons that the whole people was persuaded. He was entreated to remain and not meet the angry men of Carthage; but nothing would persuade him to break his word, and he went back. The Romans told dreadful stories of the treatment he met with--how his eyelids were cut off and he was put in the sunshine, and at last he was nailed up in a barrel lined with <b>spikes</b> and <b>rolled</b> down hill. Some say that this was mere report, and that Carthaginian prisoners at Rome were as savagely treated; but at any rate the constancy of Regulus has always been a proverb.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1999 Pre-harvest {{sprouting}} in wheat costs farmers {{millions of}} dollars every year. Pre-harvest sprouting tolerance (PST) has minimized this problem, but improvement of PST is still necessary. Synthetic hexaploid wheats (synthetics) {{have been used as}} sources of genes coding for many useful traits. Two studies evaluated the PST of a synthetic (Altar 84 /Aegilops tauschii) and investigated its potential as a source of PST in crosses with wheat cultivars. The first study compared the synthetic with selected wheat checks for PST and with its parent Altar 84 for the germination response of these genotypes to controlled wetting treatments applied to field-grown intact spikes and threshed seed. <b>Spikes</b> were <b>rolled</b> in wet germination paper and the percentages of germinated seed were determined after seven days. Threshed seeds in Petri dishes were wetted with water and vegetative floral tissues (chaff) extracts. Germinating seeds were counted daily for 14 days. The synthetic was more tolerant than Altar 84 and was classified as moderately sensitive. The improved PST of the synthetic over Altar 84 was attributed to Aegilops tauschii. Seed dormancy and water-soluble substances in the chaff of the synthetic and other genotypes appeared to contribute to their PST. The second study used random inbred F₅ lines obtained from single and backcrosses between the synthetic (red-seeded) and the sensitive wheat cultivars Opata F₅ (red-seeded) and Bacanora 88 (white-seeded). Seed coat color and germination responses of the F 5 lines subjected to a five-day spike wetting treatment were evaluated. Pre-harvest sprouting tolerance was moderately to highly inheritable and largely controlled by additive gene effects in the studied populations. An association between red seed coat color and PST was observed but white recombinant lines more tolerant than their sensitive parent were obtained. The synthetic can be used to improve wheats with red and white seed coats. The potential use of the synthetic as a PST source was discussed and a breeding strategy suggested...|$|R
40|$|The pars intercerebralis neurone PI(2) 5 of Locusta migratoria is a {{descending}} large-field {{deviation detector}} (DN), projecting {{from the brain}} to the fused abdominal ganglia. It responds with bursts of action potentials (1) to specific movements of an artificial horizon, simulating deviations from course (preferred deviations are roll and yaw {{to the side of}} the axon, and pitch-up), and (2) to proprioceptive input from neck receptors signalling head movements in either direction. During compensatory head movements both inputs act together so that the deficit in visual information is balanced by proprioceptive input. The number of <b>spikes</b> elicited by <b>roll</b> deviations depends on the sector of the visual vield initially covered by the horizon (sector specificity), increasing the more the horizon is oriented in the visually preferred direction. Hence, sector specificity involves information about the absolute orientation with respect to the horizon. The number of spikes depends further on the roll position of the head with respect to the prothorax. The response is amplified when the head is oriented in the visually preferred direction, and is attenuated when the head is oriented in the visually antipreferred direction. Visual and proprioceptive modulatory effects balance each other so that sector specificity relates to the body (i. e. the aerodynamic organs) even when head and body are rotated against each other. During flight, the excitability of PI(2) 5 is further influenced by tonic inhibition from frontal wind (no directionality), which is overriden by tonic excitation of central origin...|$|R
40|$|The MK- 82 Joint Direct Attack Munition (GBU- 38) is {{cleared for}} {{carriage}} and employment {{for the entire}} F/A- 18 C aircraft flight envelop from the BRU- 55 Canted Vertical Ejector Rack (CVER). The GBU- 38 was certified for carriage and release {{through a series of}} flight tests. For the first flight where the store was released from the BRU- 55, the wind tunnel Captive Trajectory System (CTS) data, as well as NAVAIR and Boeing pre-flight predictions, showed no resemblance to the flight test results. The original NAVSEP and Boeing predictions considerably underpredicted the roll rate, and had the yaw rates in the opposite direction from the flight test telemetry results. Since the wind tunnel CTS trajectories had the same errors, the simulations obviously were missing an important feature of the trajectories. For the flight from the CVER there was a spike in the rolling moment during the ejector stroke. This <b>roll</b> <b>spike</b> was attributed to the misalignment between the ejector force line of action and the store c. g. A statistical approach was used to modify the ejector force characteristics to best match the flight test data. This modification gave an excellent match with the flight test results for all the succeeding test points. 1. 0 NOMENCLATURE BL: Aircraft Buttline, positive outboard, in.

6000|$|... "All {{this time}} the tumult at the {{breaches}} was such as if the very earth had been rent asunder, and its central fires bursting upwards uncontrolled. The two divisions had reached the glacis just as the firing at the castle commenced, and the flash of a single musket, discharged from the covered-way as a signal, showed them that the French were ready; yet no stir was heard and darkness covered the breaches. Some hay-packs were thrown, some ladders placed, and the forlorn hopes and storming parties of the light division, five hundred in all, descended into the ditch without opposition; but then a bright flame shooting upwards displayed all the terrors of the scene. The ramparts, crowded with dark figures and glittering arms were on one side, on the other the red columns of the British, deep and broad, were coming on like streams of burning lava. It was the touch of the magician's wand, for a crash of thunder followed, and with incredible violence the storming parties were dashed to pieces by the explosion of hundreds of shells and powder-barrels. For an instant the light division stood {{on the brink of}} the ditch, amazed at the terrific sight; but then, with a shout that matched even the sound of the explosion, the men flew down the ladders, or, disdaining their aid, leaped, reckless of the depth, into the gulf below--and at the same moment, amidst a blaze of musketry that dazzled the eyes, the fourth division came running in, and descended with a like fury. There were only five ladders for the two columns, which were close together; and a deep cut, made {{in the bottom of the}} ditch as far as the counter-guard of the Trinidad, was filled with water from the inundation. Into that watery snare the head of the fourth division fell, and it is said above a hundred of the fusiliers, the men of Albuera, were there smothered. Those who followed checked not, but, as if such a disaster had been expected, turned to the left, and thus came upon the face of the unfinished ravelin, which, being rough and broken, was mistaken for the breach, and instantly covered with men; yet a wide and deep chasm was still between them and the ramparts, from whence came a deadly fire, wasting their ranks. Thus baffled, they also commenced a rapid discharge of musketry and disorder ensued; for the men of the light division, whose conducting engineer had been disabled early and whose flank was confined by an unfinished ditch intended to cut off the bastion of Santa Maria, rushed towards the breaches of the curtain and the Trinidad, which were, indeed, before them, but which the fourth division had been destined to storm. Great was the confusion, for the ravelin was quite crowded with men of both divisions; and while some continued to fire, others jumped down and ran towards the breach; many also passed between the ravelin and the counterguard of the Trinidad, the two divisions got mixed, the reserves, which should have remained at the quarries, also came pouring in, until the ditch was quite filled, the rear still crowding forward, and all cheering vehemently. The enemy's shouts also were loud and terrible, and the bursting of shells, and of grenades, and the roaring of guns from the flanks, answered by the iron howitzers from the battery of the parallel, the heavy roll, and horrid explosion of the powder-barrels, the whizzing flight of the blazing splinters, the loud exhortations of the officers, and the continual clatter of the muskets, made a maddening din. Now a multitude bounded up the great breach, as if driven by a whirlwind, but across the top glittered a range of sword-blades, sharp-pointed, keen-edged on both sides, and firmly fixed in ponderous beams chained together, and set deep in the ruins; and for ten feet in front the ascent was covered with loose planks, studded with sharp iron points, on which, feet being set, the planks moved, and the unhappy soldiers, falling forward on the <b>spikes,</b> <b>rolled</b> down upon the ranks behind. Then the Frenchmen, shouting at the success of their stratagem, and, leaping forward, plied their shot with terrible rapidity, for every man had several muskets, and each musket, in addition to its ordinary charge, contained a small cylinder of wood, stuck full of wooden slugs, which scattered like hail when they were discharged. Once and again the assailants rushed up the breaches, but always the sword-blades, immovable and impassable, stopped their charge, and the hissing shells and thundering powder-barrels exploded unceasingly. Hundreds of men had fallen, hundreds more were dropping, still, the heroic officers called aloud for new trials, and sometimes followed by many, sometimes by a few, ascended the ruins; and so furious were the men themselves, that, in one of these charges, the rear strove to push the foremost on to the sword-blades, willing even to make a bridge of their writhing bodies, but the others frustrated the attempt by dropping down; and men fell so fast from the shot, it was hard to know who went down voluntarily, who were stricken and many stooped unhurt that never rose again. Vain also would it have been to break through the sword-blades, for the trench and parapet behind the breach were finished, and the assailants, crowded into even a narrower space than the ditch was, would still have been separated from their enemies, and the slaughter would have continued. At the beginning of this dreadful conflict Andrew Barnard had, with prodigious efforts, separated his division from the other, and preserved some degree of military array; but now the tumult was such, no command would be heard distinctly except by those close at hand, and the mutilated carcasses heaped on each other, and the wounded struggling to avoid being trampled upon, broke the formations; order was impossible! Officers of all ranks, followed more or less numerously by the men, were seen to start out as if struck by sudden madness, and rash into the breach, which, yawning and glittering with steel, seemed like the mouth of a huge dragon belching forth smoke and flame. In one of these attempts, Colonel Macleod, of the 43rd, a young man whose feeble body would have been quite unfit for war if it had not been sustained by an unconquerable spirit, was killed; wherever his voice was heard his soldiers had gathered, and with such a strong resolution did he lead them up the fatal ruins that, when one behind him, in falling, plunged a bayonet into his back, he complained, not; but, continuing his course, was shot dead within a yard of the sword-blades. Yet there was no want of gallant leaders, or desperate followers, until two hours passed in these vain efforts had convinced the troops the breach of the Trinidad was impregnable; and, as the opening in the curtain, although less strong, was retired, and the approach to it impeded by deep holes and cuts made in the ditch, the soldiers did not much notice it after the partial failure of one attack which had been made early. Gathering in dark groups, and leaning on their muskets, they looked up with sullen desperation at the Trinidad, while the enemy, stepping out on the ramparts, and aiming their shots by the light of the fire-balls which they threw over, asked, as their victims fell, 'Why they did not come into Badajos?' In this dreadful situation, while the dead were lying in heaps, and others continually falling, the wounded crawling about to get some shelter from the merciless shower above, and withal a sickening stench from the burnt flesh of the slain, Captain Nicholas, of the engineers, was observed by Lieutenant Shaw, of the 43rd, making incredible efforts to force his way with a few men into the Santa Maria Bastion. Shaw immediately collected fifty soldiers, of all regiments, and joined him, and although there was a deep cut along the foot of that breach also, it was instantly passed, and these two young officers led their gallant band, with a rush, up the ruins; but when they had gained two-thirds of the ascent, a concentrated fire of musketry and grape dashed nearly the whole dead to the earth. Nicholas was mortally wounded, and the intrepid Shaw stood alone! With inexpressible coolness he looked at his watch, and saying it was too late to carry the reaches, rejoined the masses at the other attack. After this no further effort was made at any point, and the troops remained passive but unflinching beneath the enemy's shot, which streamed without intermission; for, of the riflemen on the glacis many leaped early into the ditch and joined in the assault, and the rest, raked by a cross-fire of grape from the distant bastions, baffled in their aim by the smoke and flames from the explosions, and too few in number, entirely failed to quell the French musketry. About midnight, when two thousand brave men had fallen, Wellington, who was on a height close to the quarries, ordered the remainder to retire and re-form for a second assault; he had heard the castle was taken, but thinking the enemy would still resist in the town, was resolved to assail the breaches again. This retreat from the ditch was not effected without further carnage and confusion. The French fire never slackened. A cry arose that the enemy was making a sally from the distant flanks, and there was a rush towards the ladders. Then the groans and lamentations of the wounded, who could not move and expected to be slain, increased, and many officers who had not heard of the order, endeavored to stop the soldiers from going back; some would even have removed the ladders but were unable to break the crowd." ...|$|R
