500|$|In October 2006, Sam Roberts, the Guerilla Gamemaker Competition {{director}} of the Slamdance festival, emailed Ledonne encouraging him to submit the game to the contest. Ledonne looked at {{the selection of the}} game as one of the competition's finalists in December as evidence that [...] "all forms of art can be valid tools for societal exploration (even painful topics like school shootings)". The event's organizer, Peter Baxter, announced the removal of the game from the festival's [...] "Guerrilla Gamemaker Competition" [...] after its selection as a finalist. Several reasons for the change of mind were given, including threatened sponsor withdrawal, possible lawsuits, and [...] "moral grounds"; Baxter denied that sponsor pressure caused the drop, instead affirming that [...] "the shootings are still a very touchy subject, and rightly <b>so.</b> <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be sensitive to [...] feelings." [...] An additional consideration reported was that unnamed parties might sue for copyright violations in the game itself. The announcement marked the first time the festival had pulled jury-selected content from the contest; the incident was dubbed [...] "Slamgate" [...] by the gaming press.|$|E

500|$|Paramount faced two {{obstacles}} {{in promoting the}} film: the unfamiliarity of the [...] "MySpace generation" [...] with the franchise and the relatively weak international performance of the previous films. Six months before the film's release, Abrams toured Europe and North America with 25 minutes of footage. Abrams noted the large-scale campaign started unusually early, but this was because the release delay allowed him to show more completed scenes than normal. The director preferred promoting his projects quietly, but concurred Paramount needed to remove Star Treks stigma. Abrams would exaggerate his preference for other shows to Star Trek as a child to the press, with statements like [...] "I'm not a Star Trek fan" [...] and [...] "this movie is not made for Star Trek fans necessarily". Orci compared Abrams' approach to The Next Generation episode [...] "A Matter of Honor", where William Riker is stationed aboard a Klingon vessel. [...] "On that ship when someone talks back to you, {{you would have to}} beat them down or you lose the respect of your crew, which is protocol, whereas on a Federation ship that would be a crime. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> give [...] a little bit of leeway, when he is traveling the 'galaxy' over there where they don't know Trek, to say the {{things that need to be}} said in order to get people onto our side." ...|$|E

In the accompanying Doctor Who Confidential for this episode, Davies explains [...] "This is so busy and so mental and so epic and universal in scale that of course you need two Doctors to solve it." [...] Phil Collinson, Graeme Harper, and David Tennant discuss the use of the double, a musician named Colum Regan who is a very good physical match for Tennant.

2500|$|Actually, {{the locus}} classicus, the best {{formulation}} of this, was by an {{ambassador to the}} United Nations, Abba Eban, ... He advised the American Jewish community that they had two tasks to perform. One task was to show that criticism of the policy, what he called anti-Zionism — that means actually criticisms of {{the policy of the}} state of Israel — were anti-Semitism. That’s the first task. Second task, if the criticism was made by Jews, their task was to show that it’s neurotic self-hatred, needs psychiatric treatment. Then he gave two examples of the latter category. One was I.F. Stone. The other was me. <b>So,</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be treated for our psychiatric disorders, and non-Jews have to be condemned for anti-Semitism, if they’re critical of the state of Israel. That’s understandable why Israeli propaganda would take this position. I don’t particularly blame Abba Eban for doing what ambassadors are sometimes supposed to do. But we ought to understand that there is no sensible charge. No sensible charge. There’s nothing to respond to. It’s not a form of anti-Semitism. It’s simply criticism of the criminal actions of a state, period.|$|E
