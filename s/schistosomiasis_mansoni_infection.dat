This {{study was designed}} to quantify hepatic alterations in schistosomiasis mansoni-infected mice fed a high fat-rich chow compared to mice fed a standard rodent chow, using stereology. Female SW mice fed each either high-fat diet (29 % lipids) or standard chow (12 % lipids) over 8 months, and then were infected with Schistosoma mansoni cercariae. Four experimental groups were studied: infected mice fed a high-fat diet (IHFC) or standard chow (ISC), uninfected mice fed a high-fat diet (HFC) or standard chow (SC). Mice were sacrificed during early infection (9 weeks from exposure). The following hepatic biometry and the stereology parameters were determined: volume density (hepatocytes [h], sinusoids [s], steatosis [st] and hepatic fibrosis [hf]); numerical density (hepatocyte nuclei - Nv[h]); absolute number of total hepatocyte N[h], normal hepatocyte N[nh], and binucleated hepatocyte N[bh], percentage of normal hepatocyte P[nh] and binucleated hepatocyte P[bh]. IHFC and HFC groups exhibited TC, HDL-C, LDL-C, and body mass significantly greater (p < 0. 05) than control group. No significant differences were found regards liver volume (p = 0. 07). Significant differences were observed regards P[nh] (p = 0. 0045), P[bh] (p = 0. 0045), Nv[h] (p = 0. 0006), N[h] (p = 0. 0125), N[bh] (p = 0. 0164) and N[nh] (p = 0. 0078). IHFC mice group presented 29 % of binucleated hepatocytes compared to HFC group (19 %), ISC group (17 %) and SC (6 %). Volume density was significantly different between groups: Vv[h] (p = 0. 0052), Vv[s] (p = 0. 0025), Vv[st] (p = 0. 0004), and Vv[hf] (p = 0. 0007).

The present experimental study in mice evaluated the following aspects {{of the relationship between}} infection with Schistosoma mansoni and liver abscess caused by S. aureus: a) the role of the eggs of S. mansoni in the genesis of the abscesses; b) the influence of different phases of schistosomiasis in the development of liver abscesses; and c) the effect of the treatment of schistosomiasis {{on the development of the}} abscesses. Macroscopic and histopathological study showed multiple liver abscesses around granulomas of S. mansoni in the acute and chronic phases of schistosomiasis.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{responsibility}} of Schistosoma mansoni in female infertility is still controversial. This {{study was conducted}} to evaluate the effect of acute and chronic <b>schistosomiasis</b> <b>mansoni</b> <b>infection</b> on the endometrium using immunohistochemical analysis of uterine hormone receptor expression. METHODS: Twenty-four nonpregnant swiss albino mice were divided into three groups: control, noninfected; acute; and chronic Schistosoma mansoni infection. Histological sections of uterine specimens were examined by light microscope with an image analyzing system to detect structural histological, estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) expression in the endometrium. RESULTS: No secretory phase was detected in the endometrium in acute and chronic Schistosoma infection. Hormone receptor expression (ER and PR) showed statistically significant differences among the groups (p< 0. 05), with significant low ER hormone expression in chronic infection, compared to control proliferative, control secretory and acute infection cases, and statistically significant high PR expression in both acute and chronic infection cases compared to the control secretory cases (p< 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: Schistosomiasis mansoni seems to have an important impact on the hormone expression of affected women. Further studies to explore the mechanism of such changes are recommended...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Schistosomiasis</b> <b>mansoni</b> {{is usually}} a chronic {{infection}} that leads to long-term, systemic exposure to schis-tosome antigens. Experimental Schistosoma <b>mansoni</b> <b>infection</b> is associated with immunoregulatory mechanisms, in-cluding T regulatory cells (Treg) that may help control morbidity and dampen resistance to re-infection. We now show that some <b>schistosomiasis</b> <b>mansoni</b> patients have high proportions of CD 3 +/CD 4 +/CD 25 high Treg. On effective treatment with praziquantel, these high Treg percentages decrease, and fewer of the remaining Treg express CD 45 RO. The proportion of Treg in S. mansoni–infected patients is inversely related to their percentage of activated, putative effector T cells (CD 3 +/CD 4 +/CD 25 medium/HLA-DR+ cells). We conclude some, but not all, <b>schistosomiasis</b> <b>mansoni</b> patients develop high percentages of circulating Treg, and effective treatment both decreases the levels of these cells and changes their phenotypes, possibly because of the removal of constant exposure to antigens from intravascular, egg-producing adult worms...|$|R
40|$|Malnutrition hampers {{the course}} of <b>schistosomiasis</b> <b>mansoni</b> <b>infection</b> just as normal growth of adult worms. A {{comparative}} morphometric study on adult specimens (male and female) recovered from un-dernourished (fed with a low protein diet – regional basic diet) and nourished (rodent commercial laboratory food, NUVILAB) white mice was performed. Tomographic images and morphometric analy-sis of the oral and ventral suckers, reproductive system and tegument were obtained by means of confo-cal laser scanning microscopy. Undernourished male specimens presented smaller morphometric val-ues (length and width) of the reproductive system (first, third and last testicular lobes) and thickness of the tegument than controls. Besides that, it was demonstrated that the dorsal surface of the male worms bears large tubercles unevenly distributed, but kept grouped and flat. At the subtegumental region, vacuolated areas were detected. It was concluded that the inadequate nutritional status of the vertebrate host has a negative influ-ence mainly in the reproductive system and topographical somatic development of male adult Schisto-soma mansoni, inducing some alterations {{on the structure of}} the parasite.

40|$|The {{plasma level}} of the {{chemokine}} CCL 3 is elevated in patients with chronic severe schistosomiasis mansoni. We have previously shown that CCL 3 (-/-) mice with experimental infection showed diminished pathology and worm burden compared to those of wild-type (WT) mice. To elucidate further the role of CC chemokines during <b>schistosomiasis</b> <b>mansoni</b> <b>infection,</b> we evaluated the course of infection in C 57 BL/ 6 J mice deficient in CCR 5, one of the receptors for CCL 3. The CCR 5 deficiency proved to be remarkably deleterious to the host, since mortality rates reached 70 % at 14 weeks postinfection in CCR 5 (-/-) mice and 19 % in WT mice. The increased lethality {{was not associated with}} an increased parasite burden, since similar numbers of eggs and adult worms were found in mice from both groups. Liver granulomas of chronically infected CCR 5 (-/-) mice were larger and showed greater numbers of cells and collagen deposition than liver granulomas from WT mice. This was associated with higher levels of production of intereleukin- 5 (IL- 5), IL- 13, CCL 3, and CCL 5 in infected CCR 5 (-/-) mice than in infected WT mice. Moreover, at 8 weeks after infection, just before changes in pathology and mortality, the numbers of FoxP 3 -positive cells were lower in liver granulomas of CCR 5 (-/-) mice than in WT mice. In conclusion, the CCR 5 deletion is deleterious to mice infected with Schistosoma mansoni, and this is associated with enhanced fibrosis and granulomatous inflammation...|$|E

Two different dose regimens were used to explore the effects upon worm load, tissue egg load, and hepatic granuloma size. MethodsIn this study, a group of 50 Swiss albino mice was used. This group was divided into five subgroups: subgroup I constituted infected untreated control mice; subgroup II, infected mice given 0. 5 mg diclofenac orally 24 h post infection, then sacrificed three weeks later; subgroup III, infected mice given 0. 5 mg diclofenac orally six weeks post infection and sacrificed one week later; subgroup IV, infected mice administered 1 mg diclofenac orally 24 h post infection and sacrificed three weeks later; and subgroup V, infected mice given 1 mg of the drug orally six weeks post infection and sacrificed one week later. ResultsMice given the high dose regimen (1 mg orally/mouse) 24 h post infection, then sacrificed three weeks later, demonstrated {{a significant reduction in}} the immature worms recovered, compared to the untreated controls. Animals receiving the high dose of the drug six weeks post infection, then sacrificed one week later, revealed a drop in the number of mature worms and in the tissue egg load (hepatic and intestinal), and the smallest hepatic granuloma measurement compared to the untreated controls.

40|$|Although {{eosinophilia}} {{has long}} been associated with helminth infections, {{the function of the}} eosinophil granulocyte has remained obscure.

40|$|Abstract Background In Brazil, <b>schistosomiasis</b> <b>mansoni</b> <b>infection</b> is an {{endemic disease}} that mainly affects the country’s rural populations who carry out {{domestic}} and social activities in rivers and water accumulations that provide {{shelter for the}} snails of the disease. The process of rural migration to urban centers and the disorderly occupation of natural environments by these populations from endemic areas have favored expansion of schistosomiasis to locations that had been considered to be disease-free. Based on environmental {{changes that have occurred}} in consequent to an occupation and urbanization process in the locality of Porto de Galinhas, the present study sought to identify the relationship between those chances, measure by remote-sensing techniques, and establish a new endemic area for schistosomiasis on the coast of Pernambuco State - Brazil. Methods To gather prevalence data, two parasitological census surveys were conducted (2000 and 2010) using the Kato-Katz technique. Two malacological surveys were also conducted in the same years in order to define the density and infection rate of the intermediate host. Based on these data, spatial analyses were done, resulting in maps of the risk of disease transmission. To ascertain the environmental changes that have occurred at the locality, images from the QuickBird satellite were analyzed, thus resulting in land use maps. Results Over this 10 -year period, the foci of schistosomiasis became more concentrated in the Salinas district. This area was considered to be at the greatest risk of schistosomiasis transmission and had the highest prevalence rates over this period. The study illustrated that this was the area most affected by the environmental changes resulting from the disorderly urbanization process, which gave rise to unsanitary environments that favored the establishment and maintenance of foci of schistosomiasis transmission, thereby consolidating the process of expansion and endemization of this parasitosis. </p...|$|E

Our aims were to evaluate if osteopontin {{plays a role in}} acute Schistosoma <b>mansoni</b> <b>infection</b> in both human and experimentally infected mice and if circulating OPN levels could be a novel biomarker of this infection. Serum/plasma osteopontin levels were measured by ELISA in patients with acute (n = 28), hepatointestinal (n = 26), hepatosplenic (n = 39) schistosomiasis and in uninfected controls (n = 21). Liver osteopontin was assessed by immunohistochemistry in needle biopsies of 5 patients. Sera and hepatic osteopontin were quantified in the murine model of <b>schistosomiasis</b> <b>mansoni</b> during acute (7 and 8 weeks post infection, n = 10) and chronic (30 weeks post infection, n = 8) phase. Circulating osteopontin levels are increased in patients with acute schistosomiasis (p = 0. 0001). The highest levels of OPN were observed during the peak of clinical symptoms (7 - 11 weeks post infection), returning to baseline level once the granulomas were modulated (> 12 weeks post infection).

40|$|An {{important}} feature of many chronic parasitic infections {{is the ability of}} the invading pathogen and host to establish a compromise, which ensures successful parasitism without killing the infected host. For many helminth infections, down-modulating the immune response is critical because persistent inflammation can become more damaging to the host than the invading pathogen itself. Such is the case with <b>schistosomiasis</b> <b>mansoni,</b> where chronic granulomatous inflammation in the liver causes portal hypertension, porto-pulmonary shunting, bleeding from collateral bypass vessels, and eventual death if not suppressed effectively.

The present {{study showed that}} the presence in serum of the thermostable cytolytic anti-sheep red blood cells antibodies {{is dependent on the}} Schistosoma <b>mansoni</b> <b>infection,</b> and this is more frequent in adults than in children. The thermostable characteristic of hemolysins in normal sera was not dependent on the presence of Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura or hookworm geo-helminths. Further, thermostable complement-activating heterophile antibodies were noticed in children in association with massive number of S. mansoni eggs. The results were obtained by using the z- and the chi-square tests. The z-test allows us to formulate a one-sided alternative, i. e., a tendency of one of the attributes. On the other hand, the chi-square test analyzes the independence between attributes by using a contingency table. Besides the obtained results being interesting in the field of <b>schistosomiasis</b> <b>mansoni,</b> they can provide a new insight into the use of statistics in medical science...|$|R
40|$|The Kato-Katz (KK) stool smear is the {{standard}} test for the diagnosis of Schistosoma <b>mansoni</b> <b>infection,</b> but suffers from low sensitivity when infections intensities are moderate to low. Thus, misdiagnosed individuals remain untreated {{and contribute to the}} disease transmission, thereby forestalling public health efforts to move from a modality of disease control to one of elimination. As an alternative, the urine-based diagnosis of <b>schistosomiasis</b> <b>mansoni</b> via the circulating cathodic antigen immuno-chromatographic test (CCA-ICT) has been extensively evaluated in Africa with the conclusion that it may replace the KK test in areas where prevalences are moderate or high. The objective was to measure the performance of the CCA-ICT in a sample study population composed of residents from non-endemic and endemic areas for <b>schistosomiasis</b> <b>mansoni</b> in two municipalities of Minas Gerais state, Brazil. Volunteers (130) were classified into three infection status groups based on duplicate Kato-Katz thick smears from one stool sample (2 KK test) : 41 negative individuals from non-endemic areas, 41 negative individuals from endemic areas and 48 infected individuals from endemic areas. Infection status was also determined by the CCA-ICT and infection exposure by antibody ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) to S. mansoni soluble egg antigen (SEA) and soluble (adult) worm antigen preparation (SWAP). Sensitivity and specificity were influenced by whether the trace score visually adjudicated in the CCA-ICT was characterized as positive or negative for S. <b>mansoni</b> <b>infection.</b> An analysis of a two-graph receiver operating characteristic was performed to change the cutoff point. When the trace score was interpreted as a positive rather than as a negative result, the specificity decreased from 97. 6 % to 78. 0 % whereas sensitivity increased from 68. 7 % to 85. 4 %. A significantly positive correlation between the CCA-ICT scores and egg counts was identified (r = 0. 6252, p = 0. 0001). However, the CCA-ICT misdiagnosed as negative 14. 6 % of 2 KK positive individuals, predominantly those with light infections (fewer than 100 eggs/g feces). Considering 2 KK as reference test, the discriminating power of the CCA-ICT (the area under the curve [AUC] = 0. 817) was greater than the SEA-ELISA (AUC = 0. 744) and SWAP-ELISA (AUC = 0. 704). Our data for the performance of the CCA-ICT in the Brazilian communities endemic for <b>schistosomiasis</b> <b>mansoni</b> support those from Africa, i. e., in areas with greater infection prevalence and intensities, the CCA-ICT may be useful as a tool to indicate community-based preventative chemotherapy without individual diagnosis. However, because of the Brazilian Ministry of Health's recommendation for individual diagnosis in areas where prevalence is less than 15 %, i. e., those areas in which infection intensities are likely to be lowest, the CCA-ICT lacks the sensitivity to be used as standalone diagnostic tool...|$|R
40|$|Laboratory {{diagnosis}} of intestinal <b>schistosomiasis</b> <b>mansoni</b> {{can be accomplished}} through various methods of stool examination to detect parasites, ranging from the most classic tests (Kato-Katz) to several methods that are still undergoing validation. This {{study was conducted to}} assess two new parasite identification methods for diagnosing <b>schistosomiasis</b> <b>mansoni</b> in residents of a low endemic area in the municipality of Maranguape, in the state of Ceará, Brazil using the Kato-Katz method as a reference and serology (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) for the screening of patients. The Kato-Katz, the saline gradient method and the Helmintex® method parasite identification methods were employed only in subjects who exhibited positive serologic tests. The test results were then analysed and treatment of positive individuals was subsequently performed. After comparing the test results, we observed that the saline gradient method and the Helmintex® method were more effective in diagnosing <b>schistosomiasis</b> <b>mansoni</b> in the study area compared with the Kato-Katz method...|$|R
40|$|<b>Schistosomiasis</b> <b>mansoni</b> in the Serrano village, {{municipality}} of Cururupu, state of Maranhão, Brazil, {{is a widely}} spread disease. The PECE (Program for the Control of Schistosomiasis), undertaken since 1979 has reduced the prevalence of S. <b>mansoni</b> <b>infection</b> and the hepatosplenic form of the disease. Nevertheless piped water is available in 84 % of the households, prevalence remains above 20 %. In order to identify other risk factors responsible for the persistence of high prevalence levels, a cross-sectional survey {{was carried out in}} a systematic sample of 294 people of varying ages. Socioeconomic, environmental and demographic variables, and water contact patterns were investigated. Fecal samples were collected and analyzed by the Kato-Katz technique. Prevalence of S. <b>mansoni</b> <b>infection</b> was 24. 1 %, higher among males (35. 5 %) and between 10 - 19 years of age (36. 6 %). The risk factors identified in the univariable analysis were water contacts for vegetable extraction (Risk Ratio - RR = 2. 92), crossing streams (RR = 2. 55), bathing (RR = 2. 35), fishing (RR = 2. 19), hunting (RR = 2. 17), cattle breeding (RR = 2. 04), manioc culture (RR = 1. 90) and leisure (RR = 1. 56). After controlling for confounding variables by proportional hazards model the risks remained higher for males, vegetable extraction, bathing in rivers and water contact in rivers or in periodically inundated parts of riverine woodland (swamplands...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to perform a spectral analysis of the electrical activity of the left colon of patients with hepatosplenic schistosomiasis. Thirty patients were studied, divided into 2 groups: group A was composed of 14 patients (9 males and 5 females) with hepatosplenic schistosomiasis and group B was composed of 16 female patients without <b>schistosomiasis</b> <b>mansoni.</b> Three pairs of electrodes were implanted in the left colon at the moment of the surgical treatment. The signals of the electric activity of the colon were captured after postoperative recovery from the ileus and fed into a computer by means of a DATAQ data collection system which identified and captured frequencies between 0. 02 and 10 Hz. Data were recorded, stored and analyzed using the WINDAQ 200 software. For electrical analysis, the average voltage of the electrical wave in the three electrodes of all patients, expressed as millivolts (mV), was considered, together with the maximum and minimum values, the root mean square (RMS), the skewness, and the results of the fast Fourier transforms. The average RMS of the <b>schistosomiasis</b> <b>mansoni</b> patients was 284. 007 mV. During a long period of contraction, the RMS increased in a statistically significant manner from 127. 455 mV during a resting period to 748. 959 mV in patients with <b>schistosomiasis</b> <b>mansoni.</b> We conclude that there were no statistically significant differences in RMS values between patients with <b>schistosomiasis</b> <b>mansoni</b> and patients without the disease during the rest period or during a long period of contraction...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} mass {{treatment}} on questionnaire {{results in the}} diagnosis of <b>schistosomiasis</b> <b>mansoni</b> was examined in 267 school children in an endemic area of Tanzania by Kato-Katz analysis of fecal specimens. The questionnaire asked for information about self-diagnosis, abdominal symptoms, blood in stools, history of wild water contact, stool examination and medication for schistosomiasis, {{and knowledge of the}} disease. A logistic regression analysis disclosed a significant association between schistosomiasis and diarrhea (p ? 0. 007; odds ratio, 32. 0; confidence interval, 2. 5 - 403. 3) and abdominal enlargement (p ? 0. 003; odds ratio, 15. 2; confidence interval, 2. 6 - 90. 1) among 61 children who had no history of medication for schistosomiasis. The sensitivity and specificity of the model were 86 % and 64 %, respectively. In contrast, no significant correlation was observed either for the 116 treated children, or for all the 267 children after the mass treatment. We conclude, therefore, that for children who had no history of medication for schistosomiasis, the questionnaire for abdominal manifestations provides reliable information on S. <b>mansoni</b> <b>infection.</b> However, once a child takes medication, the questionnaire becomes unreliable. This observation suggests that immunomodulation by anti-schistosomiasis drugs that kill adult worms exerts an effect on the appearance of abdominal manifestations and might explain the ambiguity of clinical symptoms in chronically infested patients, except in terminal cases. Further studies are required to develop a simple, rapid and cost-effective diagnostic method for monitoring S. <b>mansoni</b> <b>infection</b> after medication in local areas without resort to laboratory-based identification of schistosomiasis...|$|R

Previous studies demonstrated important roles for IL- 4 Ralpha-responsive hematopoietic cells, including T cells and macrophages in schistosomiasis. In this study, we examined the role of IL- 4 Ralpha responsiveness by nonhematopoietic smooth muscle cells during experimental acute murine <b>schistosomiasis.</b> Comparative Schistosoma <b>mansoni</b> <b>infection</b> studies with smooth muscle cell-specific IL- 4 Ralpha-deficient (SM-MHC(cre) IL- 4 Ralpha(-/flox)) mice, heterozygous control (IL- 4 Ralpha(-/flox)) mice, and global IL- 4 Ralpha-deficient (IL- 4 Ralpha(-/-)) mice were conducted. S. mansoni-infected SM-MHC(cre) IL- 4 Ralpha(-/flox) mice showed increased weight loss and earlier mortalities compared with IL- 4 Ralpha(-/flox) mice, despite comparable T(H) 2 /type 2 immune responses. In contrast to highly susceptible IL- 4 Ralpha-deficient mice, increased susceptibility in SM-MHC(cre) IL- 4 Ralpha(-/flox) mice was not accompanied by intestinal tissue damage and subsequent sepsis. However, both susceptible mutant mouse strains failed to efficiently expel eggs, demonstrated by egg reduction in the feces compared with control mice. Reduced egg expulsion was accompanied by impaired IL- 4 /IL- 13 -mediated hypercontractile intestinal responses, which was present in the more resistant control mice. Together, we conclude that IL- 4 Ralpha responsiveness by smooth muscle cells and subsequent IL- 4 - and IL- 13 -mediated hypercontractility are required for host protection during acute schistosomiasis to efficiently expel S. mansoni eggs and to prevent premature mortality.
