Serological diagnoses of bovine cysticercosis were initially done by means of indirect ELISA, and positive serum samples were confirmed by a immunoblot test. Herds were deemed positive for cysticercosis if they presented at least one positive animal in herds of up to 29 females, and two positive animals in herds with more than 29 females. The spatial clustering was assessed using the Cuzick-Edwards k-nearest neighbor method and spatial scan statistics. A significant clustering of positive herds was detected {{in the southern part of}} the Borborema mesoregion. Given that serological tests for bovine cysticercosis are not widely available, and also that replacement and maintenance of herds through animal purchases is common in the region, it can be concluded that prevention measures should be applied at herd level...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY. This article {{considers}} {{simultaneous estimation}} of means from several strata un-der error-in-variables superpopulation model where variables {{are assumed to}} be measured with measurement error. We propose Bayes estimators for this problem, both hierarchical Bayes (HB) and empirical Bayes (EB). Our results find application in small area estimation where typically there are few observations from each individual stratum and simultaneous estimation of several strata means can be greatly improved by pooling information from similar neighbouring areas. The model formulated in this paper is different from models previously considered in this area in that none of them assumes measurement error. This model also extends Bolfarine’s (1991) simple location error-in-variable superpopulation model to stratified sampling. Our results are applied to a real data set. A simulation study suggests that HB and EB estimators perform considerably better than the <b>sample</b> <b>strata</b> means, the traditional estimators. 1...|$|R

40|$|In Chapter 1, {{a natural}} semiparametric model for {{case control study}} data is discussed, and the {{asymptotic}} properties of two simple methods of estimation are explored. The probability element of the model can be factored into a known positive function h involving the finite dimensional structural parameter, an infinite dimensional nuisance parameter {{in the form of}} the probability element dP of a distribution, and a normalizing constant. In the setup of interest, a sample of size n is available from a population with a distribution from the aforementioned model. A second, independent sample provides information only about the infinite-dimensional nuisance parameter P. The methods of estimation involve replacing the infinite-dimensional parameter with the empirical distribution function based on the second sample, and constructing semiparametric analogs of the maximum likelihood estimator and the method of moment estimator. The simplicity of these semiparametric estimators permits analysis of their asymptotic distribution even when n and m grow at different rates, yielding very natural and interpretable asymptotic results. In the case where n=o(m), the analog of the maximum likelihood estimator is asymptotically efficient. Chapter 2 explores a related parametric asymptotic statistics problem. Suppose a sample of size m is available from a population with density f Y(y; lambda), and an independent sample of size n is available from a population with density f X(x;lambda,alpha). Here &lambda is regarded as a nuisance parameter and &alpha is the structural parameter, where &lambda and &alpha are scalars. One approach to estimation of &alpha would be to compute the maximum likelihood estimator based on both samples. A second approach would be to first find the maximum likelihood estimator of &lambda from the first sample, and to then treat it as the true parameter when using maximum likelihood estimation based on the second sample. Chapter 2 compares the asymptotic behavior of these two estimators under different assumptions about the rate of growth of m relative to n. In chapter 3 we consider interval estimation for small area proportions based on data collected under stratified random sampling. We focus on the case where the <b>stratum</b> <b>sample</b> sizes and the true proportions are small for all strata, and for simplicity we assume equal <b>stratum</b> <b>sample</b> sizes. The objective is to construct a confidence interval for each of the true stratum proportions, P i. A commonly used small area empirical Bayes model for a single stratum's true proportion P i assumes that the distributions of the <b>sampled</b> <b>stratum</b> proportions and the prior distribution of the true stratum proportions are normal. The well-documented problems of the normal approximation to the binomial, particularly when the sample size is small and the probability of success is close to 0 or 1, raise questions about the adequacy of such a model when the P i and the <b>stratum</b> <b>sample</b> sizes are small. We argue that a more reasonable model in this setting is to assume that the <b>sampled</b> <b>stratum</b> counts have binomial distributions and that the prior distribution of the true stratum proportions follows a beta distribution. We propose a new empirical Bayes confidence interval based on this model, and examine related simulation results...|$|R

40|$|Stratification {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used {{techniques}} in finite population <b>sampling.</b> <b>Strata</b> are disjoint subdivisions of a population, the union of which exhaust the universe, each of which contains a portion of the sample. Two of its essential statistical purposes are to: (1) allow for efficient estimation, especially in the case of stratification by size, and (2) deal statistically with subpopulations or domains by controlling their sample allocations. Stratification by size is typically considered as serving purpose (1) by creating strata in an efficient way and optimally allocating the sample to the strata. Using model-based analysis, we show that, in the situation where stratification by size is generally used, optimal allocation of a weighted balanced sample achieves exactly the same variance as unstratified, best linear unbiased (BLU) prediction coupled with weighted balanced sampling. In other words, stratification by size has no advantage over the optimal, unstratified procedure. This and other theoretical findings are illustrated with simulations using real populations...|$|E

The overall approach to discard estimation was designed-based as opposed to modelbased. The former makes no attempt to explain discarding as a function of influential factors whereas the latter does. Discarding is a function of processes related to the stock (e. g. local concentration, population age/size structure), fishing operations (e. g. gear mesh) and management (e. g. small fish prohibitions).

During the review meeting, it was noted that the initiation of fleet sector management in 2010 will introduce considerable uncertainty into how discard practices may change. Thus, at least in the short term, a designbased approach is warranted. It may be possible to explore modeling of the discard process as the database under sector management accumulates.
