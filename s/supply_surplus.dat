50|$|If {{there is}} a near-term shortage, the price {{comparison}} breaks down and contango may be reduced or perhaps even reverse altogether into a state called backwardation. In that state, near prices become higher than far (i.e., future) prices because consumers prefer to have the product {{sooner rather than later}} (see convenience yield), andbecause there are few holders who can make an arbitrage profit by selling the spot and buying back the future. A market that is steeply backwardated—i.e., one where {{there is a}} very steep premium for material available for immediate delivery—often indicates a perception of a current shortage in the underlying commodity. By the same token, a market that is deeply in contango may indicate a perception of a current <b>supply</b> <b>surplus</b> in the commodity.|$|E

In summer 1941, 665 interned Templers from all their settlements, mainly young families with children, were transported to Australia for internment.

40|$|A paper {{published}} in April 2007 questioned the continued rationale of the linkage of Continental European {{long term contract}} gas prices to oil product prices. 1 It concluded that the logic of linking gas prices to those of (mainly) oil products had largely disappeared in the major European gas markets.

The global economic and financial crisis, which began in late 2008, has significantly depressed European energy and gas demand.

40|$|The recent {{crisis of}} soaring food prices has moved {{the world to}} respond. Many factors contributed to the {{unprecedented}} rise in food prices including high energy prices, changing patterns of consumption, low investment in agriculture, low harvests in some major agricultural regions, {{and the use of}} grains for biofuel production. The responses have been sub-optimal due to information deficit and political pressure. Short-term and long-term strategies are yet to be developed. Some <b>supply</b> <b>surplus</b> countries have imposed a ban on exportation of food and certain supply-deficit countries have removed tariffs to increase imports to supplement domestic food supplies.

To maintain a specific frequency in the islanded mode as an important requirement,  the control of DGs’ output and charge action of DSs are used in <b>supply</b> <b>surplus</b> conditions and load-shedding and discharge action of DSs are used in supply shortage conditions. Recently, multiagent systems for autonomous microgrid operation have been studied. Especially, load-shedding, which is intentional reduction of electricity use, is a critical problem in islanded microgrid operation based on the multiagent system. Therefore, effective schemes for load-shedding are required. Meanwhile, the bankruptcy problem deals with dividing short resources among multiple agents. In order to solve the bankruptcy problem, division rules, such as the constrained equal awards rule (CEA), the constrained equal losses rule (CEL), and the random arrival rule (RA), have been used. In this paper, we approach load-shedding as a bankruptcy problem. We compare load-shedding results by above-mentioned rules in islanded microgrid operation based on wireless sensor network (WSN) as the communication link for an agent’s interactions...|$|E
40|$|In {{the first}} half of 1995 the UK gas market {{underwent}} a price shock. At {{the beginning of the year}} gas had been trading on a short-term basis in an informal telephone market at a level of around 18 - 19 p/therm. This was approximately in line with the average long-term contract prices paid by British Gas (BG) and other wholesale gas purchasers and which account for the overwhelming proportion of sales. On a calorific basis these price levels were also comparable with oil prices in the range of $ 15 - 18 barrel. By March the price for short-term – or “spot” – supply had weakened to around 14 p and in April prices collapsed to 9 p. In term of the percentage decline in price the fall can be compared to the collapse in oil prices of 1986.

40|$|Abstract According to new {{institutional}} economics, Logistics transaction is {{a problem}} of Principal-agent that traditional organization transfers its internal logistics activities to the professional outsider which is borne the logistics agent’s liability. The paper employs the theory of principal-agent, signaling game model and incentive model to analyze the forms and the problems about adverse selection and moral hazard in logistics transaction, to solve the fundamental issues caused by incomplete and asymmetrical information. The paper presents that information asymmetry, ‘Short sighted’, huge market and the limitation of signal dissemination system will result in adverse selection in logistics transaction. Adverse selection will result the excellent logistics supplier to be crowded out of the market gradually, result the condition of logistics supply insufficient and <b>supply</b> <b>surplus</b> existing in the same market, impede the improvement of logistics productivity, and moral hazard in logistics market will result insufficient effective demand. The paper implies that signal transferring and signal screening are the most common methods to resolve the above problem. The paper sets up a signaling game model and an incentive model, draws a conclusion that by designing appropriate signaling game model and incentive mechanism, we can change some asymmetrical and incomplete information into symmetrical and complete one to help improve the efficient of logistics transaction.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} requirements of microgrid operation is to maintain a constant frequency such as 50 Hz or 60 Hz, which is closely related to a power balance between supply and demand. In general, microgrids are connected to power grids and surplus/shortage power of microgrids is traded with power grids. Since islanded microgrids are isolated from any power grids, the decrease in generation or load-shedding can be used to maintain the frequency when a power imbalance between supply and demand occurs. The power imbalance restricts the electricity use of consumers in the case of supply shortage and the power supply of suppliers in the case of <b>supply</b> <b>surplus.</b> Therefore, the islanded microgrid should be operated to reduce power imbalance conditions. Meanwhile, the microgrid is a small-scale power system and the employment of skillful operators for effective operation of its components requires high costs. Therefore, automatic operation of the components is effective realistically. In addition, the components are distributed in the microgrid and their operation should consider their owners’ profits. For these reasons, a multiagent system application can be a good alternative for microgrid operation. In this paper, we present a multiagent system for autonomous operation of the islanded microgrid on a power market environment. The proposed multiagent system is designed based on a cooperative operation scheme. We show the functionality and the feasibility of the proposed multiagent system through several tests...|$|E
