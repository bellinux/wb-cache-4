In general, such an electronic device can work as a dosimeter from threshold voltage shift measurements. The {{purpose of this article}} is to show a new way for measuring the dose-response of MOSFETs when they are under X-ray beams generated from 100 kV potential range, which is normally used in diagnostic radiology. Basically, the method consists of measuring the MOSFET drain current as a function of the radiation dose. For this the type of device, it has to be biased with a high value resistor aiming to see a substantial change in the drain current after it has been irradiated with an amount of radiation dose. Two types of N channel device were used in the experiment: a <b>signal</b> <b>transistor</b> and a power transistor. The delivered dose to the device was varied and the electrical curves were plotted. Also, a sensitivity analysis of the power MOSFET response was made, by varying the tube potential of about 20 %. The results show that both types of devices have responses very similar, the shift in the electrical curve is proportional to the radiation dose. Unlike the power MOSFET, the <b>signal</b> <b>transistor</b> does not provide a linear function between the dose rate and its drain current. We also have observed that the variation in the tube potential of the X-ray equipment produces a very similar dose-response...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The millimetre-wave {{spectrum}} at 30 - 300 GHz is {{of increasing}} interest to service providers and systems designers {{because of the}} wide bandwidths available for carrying communications at this frequency range. These wide bandwidths are valuable in supporting applications such as high speed data transmission and video distribution. This project mainly focuses on modeling a MOSFET for millimeter-wave integrated circuits(MMIC). There are many emerging millimeter-wave applications which demand for low unit cost manufacturing solutions. With the advent of millimeter-wave semiconductor technology a MOSFET is modeled to work efficiently at high frequency. The transistor modeling is done by developing a compact model with BSIM 3 v 3 and external parasitics to model substrate and gate resistance. High frequency MOSFET compact model built using BSIM 3 v 3 as intrinsic core and having parasitic elements supporting HF are designed as extrinsic subcircuit. To demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed composite MOSFET model, the proposed methodology is then used in designing a low power millimeter-wave CMOS low noise amplifier.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a methodology for characterizing the random component of transistor mismatch in CMOS technologies. The methodology {{is based on}} the design of a special purpose chip which allows automatic characterization of arrays of NMOS and PMOS transistors of different sizes. Up to 30 different transistor sizes were implemented in the same chip, with varying transistors width W and length L. A simple strong inversion large <b>signal</b> <b>transistor</b> model is considered, and a new five parameters MOS mismatch model is introduced. The current mismatch between two identical transistors is characterized by the mismatch in their respective current gain factors Δβ/β, threshold voltages ΔVT 0, bulk threshold parameters Δγ, and two components for the mobility degradation parameter mismatch Δθo and Δθe. These two components modulate the mismatch contribution differently, depending on whether the transistors are biased in ohmic or in saturation region. Using this five parameter mismatch model, an extraordinary fit between experimental and computed mismatch is obtained, including minimum length (1 μm) transistors for both ohmic and saturation regions. Standard deviations for these five parameters are obtained as well as their respective correlation coefficients, and are fitted to two dimensional surfaces f(W, L) so that their values can be predicted as a function of transistor sizes. These functions are used in an electrical circuit simulator (Hspice) to predict transistor mismatch. Measured and simulated data are in excellent agreement. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
