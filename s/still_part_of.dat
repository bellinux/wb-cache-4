5|$|Gold {{was also}} {{discovered}} in Southern California {{but on a}} much smaller scale. The first discovery of gold, at Rancho San Francisco in the mountains north of present-day Los Angeles, had been in 1842, six years before Marshall's discovery, while California was <b>still</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Mexico. However, these first deposits, and later discoveries in Southern California mountains, attracted little notice and were of limited consequence economically.|$|E

5|$|As the Great Lakes assumed {{their present}} levels, the {{waterfall}} was inundated and Mackinac Island took on its current size. The steep cliffs {{were one of}} the primary reasons for the British army's choice of the island for a fortification; their decision differed from that of the French army, which had built Fort Michilimackinac about 1715 near present-day Mackinaw City. The limestone formations are <b>still</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the island's appeal. However, tourists are attracted by the natural beauty rather than the strategic value. One of the most popular geologic formations is Arch Rock, a natural limestone arch, 146feet (45m) above the ground. Other popular geologic formations include Devil's Kitchen, Skull Cave, and Sugar Loaf.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Lynch left in 1989, Butthole Surfers' stage show {{had become more}} predictable, with {{previously}} random shockers being done {{at the same point}} in each night's performance. Teresa Nervosa quit for good around the same time, and King Coffey became the band's sole percussionist. Strobe lights, smoke machines, and even Gibby Haynes' burning cymbal are <b>still</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the presentation, but the chaotic spontaneity of their 1980s performances is no longer on display.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, the 4th Parachute Brigade, {{although}} <b>still</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the 1st Airborne Division, {{was kept}} out of the Allied invasion of Sicily by a shortage of transport aircraft. The 1st Airlanding Brigade took part in Operation Ladbroke and the 1st Parachute Brigade in Operation Fustian. Both brigades suffered heavy casualties, so that by the time Operation Slapstick was proposed, only the 2nd and 4th Parachute Brigades were up to strength. Slapstick was in part a deception operation to divert German forces from the main Allied landings and also an attempt to seize intact the Italian ports of Taranto, Bari and Brindisi.|$|E

5|$|Nowotny {{was given}} a state funeral in Vienna.

Nowotny was buried at the Zentralfriedhof in Vienna in a grave of honor sponsored {{by the city of}} Vienna, which was <b>still</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Nazi Germany. Following an initiative by the Austrian Green Party and debates in the Vienna Landtag, a resolution supported by Social Democrats and Greens was passed to remove the status of honor in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of the titles, Odaenathus {{controlled}} the Roman East {{with the approval}} of Gallienus who could do little but to formalize Odaenathus self achieved status and settle for his formal loyalty. Palmyra itself, although officially <b>still</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the Roman empire, became a de facto allied state to Rome instead of a provincial city. Outside of Palmyra, Odaenathus' authority extended from the Pontic coast in the north to Palestine in the south. This area included the Roman provinces of Syria, Phoenice, Palaestina, Arabia, Anatolia's eastern regions and later (following the campaign of 262) Osroene and Mesopotamia.|$|E

5|$|The {{land that}} became Sullivan County was {{originally}} part of Northumberland County, then {{became part of}} Lycoming County when it was formed in 1795.

5|$|The parish {{began to}} take on civil as well as ecclesiastical duties {{following}} the 16th-century Dissolution of the Monasteries and the Tudor Poor Law Acts of 1601. The ecclesiastical parish of Navenby was originally placed in the Longoboby Rural Deanery, but {{was transferred to the}} Graffoe Rural Deanery in 1968, and it is <b>still</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the Diocese of Lincoln. Navenby officially became a civil parish in the 19th century and {{became a member of the}} Lincoln Poor Law Union in 1834. The parish was also part of the Lincoln Rural Sanitary District. The Navenby civil parish boundaries were adjusted in 1931, to include the civil parish of nearby Skinnand.|$|E
5|$|The {{period between}} the World Wars saw the {{election}} of reformist mayor Fiorello La Guardia and the fall of Tammany Hall after 80 years of political dominance. As the city's demographics stabilized, labor unionization brought new protections and affluence to the working class, the city's government and infrastructure underwent a dramatic overhaul under La Guardia. Despite the Great Depression, some of the world's tallest skyscrapers were completed in Manhattan during the 1930s, including numerous Art Deco masterpieces that are <b>still</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the city's skyline today, most notably the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building, and the GE Building.|$|E

5|$|This battle {{occurred}} on September 21–22, 1864. General Sheridan considered this battle {{a continuation of}} the Battle of Opequon near Winchester. General Early's Confederate army was pursued from Winchester to Fisher's Hill, where the rebels had strong fortifications and an advantageous location given the terrain. The 2nd West Virginia Cavalry regiment was <b>still</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the 2nd Brigade led by Colonel Powell, who reported to General Averell. In this battle, the regiment initially engaged in some skirmishing while dismounted—the terrain made it difficult to fight while mounted.|$|E
5|$|This {{is a list}} of {{the sixteen}} {{counties}} in the U.S. state of Maine. Before statehood, Maine was officially part of the state of Massachusetts and was called the District of Maine. Maine was granted statehood on March 15, 1820 as part of the Missouri Compromise. Nine of the sixteen counties had their borders defined while Maine was <b>still</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Massachusetts, and hence are older than the state itself. Even after 1820, the exact location of the northern border of Maine was disputed with Britain, until the question was settled and the northern counties signed their final official form, the Webster-Ashburton Treaty, signed in 1842. Almost all of Aroostook County was disputed land until the treaty was signed.|$|E
