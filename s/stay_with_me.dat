25|$|Often {{criticized for}} the lack of {{character}} in their music, Fahrenheit finally moved towards carving a more distinct musical style with their third album, Love You More & More (越來越愛 Yue Lai Yue Ai) which features a new maturity that is brought out by rock ballads like the main track, Lonesome Sprint (寂寞暴走 Ji Mo Bao Zou) and <b>Stay</b> <b>With</b> <b>Me</b> (留下來 Liu Xia Lai)， of which the latter was written by Monster, the lead guitarist of popular Taiwanese band, Mayday. The album also features Artery (動脈 Dong Mai), theme song of Mysterious Incredible Terminator (霹靂MIT), Shining Star (恒星 Heng Xing), theme song of Rolling Love (翻滾吧！蛋炒飯) and the ending song of drama ToGetHer (愛就宅一起) featuring Jiro and Rainie Yang, The Love of Silence (默默 Mo Mo). The album is completed by slower ballads that showcases the quartet's improved vocals and chemistry in harmonization.|$|E

500|$|The album {{received}} generally negative {{reviews from}} critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic understood why Aguilera was {{dissatisfied with the}} release of the material, calling the songs [...] "pre-professional" [...] and [...] "generic early-'90s dance-pop". He noted that Just Be Free did not match the quality of her self-titled debut album due to its [...] "bland" [...] production. David Browne of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a D-rating, citing the album's production and describing the content as [...] "teen-jailbait" [...] due to lyrics such as [...] "Why don't you <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> tonight".|$|E

She later said in an interview: [...] "In a way, I blame myself. I was not feeling well when he left. I was two weeks pregnant, and I wanted Buddy to <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> but he had scheduled that tour. It was the only time I wasn't with him.

500|$|On 28 October 2009 it was {{announced}} that Windsor had quit the show and would leave in 2010 after 15 years. She said: [...] "EastEnders has been wonderful to me and it's no secret that it changed my life all of those years ago. I'll be so sad to leave Peggy behind; she's such a wonderful character to play. I have had the pleasure of working with a marvellous cast and crew and have made many lasting good friends. To have had the honour of showing the Queen around the set is something that will <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> forever." [...] Executive producer Diederick Santer said: [...] "Barbara has contributed so much to EastEnders over the last 15 years, plus countless episodes, and countless amazing storylines. Peggy Mitchell is a truly iconic character, and along with Steve McFadden and Ross Kemp, Barbara has made the Mitchells the premier family of British soap." [...] Windsor filmed her final scene on 16 July 2010. Peggy's final episode, which aired on 10 September 2010, was preceded by a number of television trailers in August and a new section on the EastEnders website dedicated to the character. The episode ended with a special reworking of the piano version of the EastEnders theme tune known as [...] "Julia's Theme", called [...] "Peggy's Theme". Tribute was then paid to her in a clip programme, Peggy Mitchell: Queen of the Vic. [...] Peggy's final episode attracted 10.1 million viewers, and was the second most-watched programme in the week of 6–12 September.|$|E

500|$|... "I'm That Chick" [...] {{is a song}} Carey wrote {{alongside}} Norwegian duo, Stargate. It is a fast-paced song, {{which features}} a [...] "care-free feel", and is influenced by soul, pop and disco music genres. The song incorporates a sample from Michael Jackson's [...] "Off the Wall", and features a strong thumping bass-line and hand claps. Evan Sawdey of PopMatters {{described it as a}} [...] "late-night disco-bass groove", and highlighted its production as the album's finest. [...] "I'll Be Lovin' U Long Time", the album's eventual third single, was written and produced by Carey and DJ Toomp. The song was described as a [...] "mid-tempo", [...] "party jam", that is influenced by pop, R and soul genres. Critics elaborated on the song's [...] "soul" [...] influence, with Melissa Ruggieri from The News & Advance describing it as a [...] "soul-thumper", while Digital Spys Nick Levine called it a [...] "nod towards classic soul". The song's title is derived from the popular line, [...] "me love you long time", from the 1987 war film, Full Metal Jacket. Additionally, its hook and instrumentation is derived from sampling Mark DeBarge's <b>Stay</b> <b>With</b> <b>Me.</b> Critics also noted how [...] "I'll Be Lovin' U Long Time" [...] "recalls" [...] the melody riff and chord progression of the Hill Street Bluess theme song. The song's main source of production comes from its [...] "lush keyboard work", and her usage of the [...] "double voice", which she uses throughout the song's bridge. Carey described the effect as [...] "layering her voice", so that the bridge would sound like a [...] "swooning bank of a hundred Mariahs".|$|E
500|$|Before the launch, Blair {{announced}} that he would give the £4.6m advance and all royalties from his memoirs to a sports centre for injured soldiers.

That responsibility stays with me now, and will <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> {{for the rest of my}} life. You know, I came to office as prime minister in 1997, focusing on domestic policy and ended up in four conflicts – Sierra Leone, Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq. And it does change you, and so it should." [...] BBC political correspondent Norman Smith said Blair's severest critics would see the donation as [...] "guilt money" [...] for taking the UK to war against Iraq in 2003. The father of a soldier killed there decried the donation as [...] "blood money", while the father of another serviceman who died said Blair had a [...] "guilty conscience." [...] A spokesperson for the Stop the War Coalition supported with the donation, but added, [...] "No proportion of Tony Blair's massive and ill-gotten fortune can buy him innocence or forgiveness. He took this country to war on a series of lies against the best legal advice and in defiance of majority opinion." [...] A spokesman for Blair said that it had long been his intention to give the money to a charity; he added aiding soldiers undergoing rehabilitation at the Battle Back Challenge Centre was [...] "his way of honouring their courage and sacrifice." [...] The announcement was welcomed by Chris Simpkins, director general of The Royal British Legion, who said, [...] "Mr Blair's generosity is much appreciated and will help us to make a real and lasting difference to the lives of hundreds of injured personnel." ...|$|E
500|$|Minh instead {{arrived to}} find that the {{brothers}} were not in the palace. In anticipation of a coup, they had ordered the construction of three separate tunnels leading from Gia Long to remote areas outside the palace. Around 20:00 {{on the night of the}} coup, with only the Presidential Guard to defend them against mutinous infantry and armor units, Diệm and Nhu hurriedly packed American banknotes into a briefcase. They escaped through one of the tunnels with two loyalists: Air Force Lieutenant Ðỗ Thơ, Diệm's aide-de-camp, who happened to be a nephew of Colonel Đỗ Mậu, the director of military security and a participant in the coup plot, and Xuân Vy, head of Nhu's Republican Youth. After the coup, General Paul Harkins, the head of the US presence in Vietnam, inspected the tunnel and noted that it [...] "was so far down that I didn't want to go down to walk up the thing". The brothers emerged in a wooded area in a park near the Cercle Sportif, the city's upper class sporting club, where they were picked up by a waiting Land Rover. Ellen Hammer disputes the tunnel escape, asserting that the Ngo brothers simply walked out of the building, which was not yet under siege. Hammer asserts that they walked past the tennis courts and left the palace grounds through a small gate at Le Thanh Ton Street and entered the car. The loyalists traveled through narrow back streets in order to evade rebel checkpoints and changed vehicles to a black Citroën sedan. After leaving the palace, Nhu was reported to have suggested to Diệm that the brothers split up, arguing that this would enhance their chances of survival. Nhu proposed that one of them travel to the Mekong Delta to join Cao's IV Corps, while the other would travel to the II Corps of General Nguyễn Khánh in the Central Highlands. Nhu felt the rebel generals would not dare to kill one of them while the other was free, in case the surviving brother were to regain power. According to one account, Diệm was reported to have turned down Nhu, reasoning that [...] "You cannot leave alone. They hate you too much; they will kill you. <b>Stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> and I will protect you." [...] Another story holds that Diệm said [...] "We have always been together during these last years. How could we separate during these last years? How could we separate in this critical hour?" [...] Nhu agreed to remain with his brother.|$|E

2500|$|In December 1946, Vysotsky's parents divorced.

[...] "We decided that our son would <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> Vladimir came to <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> in January 1947, and my second wife, Yevgenia, became Vladimir's second mother {{for many years to}} come. They had much in common and liked each other, which made me really happy," [...] Semyon Vysotsky later remembered. Here living conditions, compared to those of Nina's communal Moscow flat, were infinitely better; the family occupied the whole floor of a two-storeyed house, and the boy had a room to himself {{for the first time in}} his life. In 1949 along with his stepmother Vladimir returned to Moscow. There he joined the 5th class of the Moscow 128th School and settled at , 15 (where they had to themselves two rooms of a four-roomed flat), with [...] "auntie Zhenya" [...] (who was just 28 at the time), a woman of great kindness and warmth whom he later remembered as his second mother. In 1953 Vladimir Vysotsky, now much interested in theater and cinema, joined the Drama courses led by Vladimir Bogomolov. [...] "No one in my family has had anything to do with arts, no actors or directors were there among them. But my mother admired theater and from the earliest age... each and every Saturday I've been taken up with her to watch one play or the other. And all of this, it probably stayed with me," [...] he later reminisced. The same year he received his first ever guitar, a birthday present from Nina Maksimovna; a close friend, bard and a future well-known Soviet pop lyricist Igor Kokhanovsky taught him basic chords. In 1955 Vladimir re-settled into his mother's new home at 1st Meshchanskaya, 76. In June of the same year he graduated from school with five A's.|$|E

2500|$|Dmitry Merezhkovsky {{spent his}} early years on the Yelagin Island in Saint Petersburg, in a palace-like cottage which served as a summer dacha for the family. In the city the family {{occupied}} an old house facing the Summer Gardens, near Prachechny Bridge. The Merezhkovskys also owned a large estate in Crimea, by a road leading to the Uchan-Su waterfall. [...] "Fabulous Oreanda palace, now in ruins, will <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> forever. White marble pylons against the blue sea... for me it's a timeless symbol of Ancient Greece," [...] he wrote years later. Sergey Merezhkovsky, although a man of means, led an ascetic life, keeping his household 'lean and thrifty'. He saw this also as 'moral prophylactics' for his children, regarding luxury-seeking and reckless spending as the two deadliest sins. The parents traveled a lot, and an old German housekeeper Amalia Khristianovna spent much time with the children, amusing them with Russian fairytales and Biblical stories. It was her recounting of saints' lives that helped Dmitry to develop fervent religious feelings in his early teens.|$|E
