The dean of nursing, Lillian Harvey, encouraged Sanders to consider studying in a Tuskegee-affiliated program at the Brooklyn State College School of Nursing in New York City. Against her foster parents' wishes, Sanders left Alabama for New York in 1953.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, the steel {{industry}} in Pittsburgh began to implode along with the deindustrialization of the U.S. Following the 1981–1982 recession, for example, the mills laid off 153,000 workers. The steel mills began to shut down. These closures caused a ripple effect, as railroads, mines, and other factories across the region lost business and closed. The local economy suffered a depression, marked by high unemployment and underemployment, as laid-off workers took lower-paying, non-union jobs. Pittsburgh <b>suffered</b> <b>as</b> elsewhere in the Rust Belt with a declining population, and like many other U.S. cities, it also saw white flight to the suburbs.|$|E

5|$|He {{struggled}} at {{the start}} of the 1972–73 season, his confidence and form <b>suffered</b> <b>as</b> defenders marked him more closely and poor diet saw his weight rise to over 14 stone. Captain Frank McLintock remarked to the management that Kennedy was only operating at 60% capacity, and Kennedy was fined £200 before he began to shed weight and rediscover his form. Arsenal finished the season in second place, and he scored just nine league goals throughout the campaign. Arsenal reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup, where they were beaten by Sunderland.|$|E
5|$|In late 1970, Young's brother, Chris died aged 31, {{an event}} which {{affected}} Young deeply. His performances for Manchester City <b>suffered</b> <b>as</b> a result. He played approximately half the matches in the 1970–71 season, scoring only two goals. In the following season, he featured only rarely, {{and made his}} last appearance for the club on 16 October 1971, as a substitute against Leeds United.|$|E
5|$|The 2006–07 season saw Nolan {{take over}} from the {{departed}} Jay-Jay Okocha as club captain. His three league goals helped Bolton to again qualify for the UEFA Cup. Nolan's long throw-in set up a goal, which helped Bolton achieve a 2–2 draw away against German champions Bayern Munich, who dominated the match. Despite reaching the first knockout round, Bolton's league form <b>suffered</b> <b>as</b> they were pulled into a relegation fight, eventually finishing the season one point above the relegation zone in 16th. Nolan scored in the 2–0 win over Sunderland in May that virtually secured the club's Premier League status.|$|E

5|$|To {{support the}} household, in late 1874 Coolbrith took a {{position}} as the librarian for the Oakland Library Association, a subscription library that had been established five years earlier. In 1878, the library was reformed as the Oakland Free Library, the second public library created in California under the Rogers Free Library Act (Eureka was first). Coolbrith earned a salary of $80 per month, much less than a man would have received. She worked 6 days a week, 12 hours a day. Her poetry <b>suffered</b> <b>as</b> a result. She published only sporadically over the next 19 years—working as Oakland's librarian was the low point of her poetic career.|$|E
5|$|While Miller toured Europe {{and lived}} out their mutual dream of visiting Lord Byron's tomb, Coolbrith was saddled with {{custody of her}} daughter, and the care of members of her own family, so she set up house a in Oakland and {{accepted}} the position of city librarian. Her poetry <b>suffered</b> <b>as</b> {{a result of her}} long work hours, but she mentored a generation of young readers including Jack London and Isadora Duncan. After she served for 19 years, Oakland's library patrons called for reorganization, and Coolbrith was fired. She moved back to San Francisco and was invited by members of the Bohemian Club to be their librarian.|$|E

5|$|After Denmark ceded Norway to Sweden in 1814, Aalborg {{lost its}} {{important}} {{role as the}} country's centre for Norwegian trade. Its former prosperity also <b>suffered</b> <b>as</b> a result of difficulties with the herring industry as the fish disappeared after the sea breached the Agger Tange (which had linked Thy {{with the rest of}} Jutland at the western end of Limfjord) in the 1825 North Sea storm. The after effects of the state bankruptcy in 1813 also contributed to widespread poverty in the city. In the mid-19th-century, Aalborg was overtaken by Aarhus as the largest city in Jutland. Towards the end of the 19th century there was however an upturn. In 1865, the pontoon bridge over Limfjord was completed, and in 1869, the railway reached the city with a railway bridge over the sound to Vendsyssel three years later. The harbour facilities were also improved, making Aalborg Denmark's second port. Aalborg became the country's main producer of tobacco products and spirits, followed in the 1890s by fertilisers and cement. By 1901, the population had increased to almost 31,500.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{began the}} season in good form and equalled Nottingham Forest's unbeaten league run of 42 matches against Middlesbrough. The team set a new English {{division}} record and went a further seven games unbeaten before losing to Manchester United in controversial circumstances. Arsenal's form <b>suffered</b> <b>as</b> a result and defensive shortcomings became more apparent; two draws and a defeat in November reinforced Chelsea's position {{at the top of}} the table, where they remained for the rest of the season. At home to Crystal Palace in February 2005, Wenger named an Arsenal squad with no English players – a first in the club's history which attracted criticism from the media. The team ended the season strongly, with a run of eight wins from nine games ensuring a second-place finish. 32 different players represented the club in five competitions and there were 15 different goalscorers. Arsenal's top goalscorer was Thierry Henry, who scored 30 goals in 42 games.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the Second World War had {{finished}} the Albert Dock's future looked bleak. The owners of the dock, the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board (MDHB) were in financial crisis and chose not to repair any of the wartime bomb damage, adopting an attitude of 'if it's not broke don't fix it, {{and if it is}} broke we still won't fix it'. At the same time a change in geo-political orientation towards Europe, coupled with the advent of containerisation meant the whole docking system in the city of Liverpool <b>suffered</b> <b>as</b> newer, stronger ports emerged elsewhere in the UK. Nonetheless the architectural and technological value of the docks was recognised in 1952 when the Albert Dock was granted Grade I listed building status.|$|E

5|$|Harmless to humans, the winghead shark {{is caught}} {{throughout}} its range using gillnets, seines, stake nets, longlines, and hook-and-line. The meat is sold fresh, the fins are exported to Asia for shark fin soup, the liver {{is a source}} of vitamin oil, and the offal is processed into fishmeal. This species is taken in large numbers in some areas, such as in the Gulf of Thailand and off India and Indonesia, and anecdotal evidence indicates its population has <b>suffered</b> <b>as</b> a result. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed the winghead shark as Endangered. This species is only infrequently caught in Australian waters, where it has been assessed regionally as Least Concern by the IUCN.|$|E
5|$|On 8 January 1967, the VPAF High Command {{convened a}} meeting to examine what had gone wrong. The actions of 2 January had exposed the flawed tactics {{employed}} by MiG-21 pilots; they broke through the clouds too quickly, {{and they did not}} join up with each other before they attacked the U.S. fighters waiting above them. The VPAF High Command then devised a new tactic which required the deployment of between two or four aircraft for each attack, with a maximum of ten aircraft for each mission to perform guerrilla-style attacks on U.S. bomber formations. Furthermore, after they had examined U.S. air tactics, North Vietnamese commanders decided that MiG-17 pilots should attack U.S. formations from either side, while MiG-21 pilots would strike from above. Before the North Vietnamese Air Force could implement their new tactics, however, the VPAF 921st Fighter Regiment was withdrawn from combat for several months to recover from the bloody defeat it had <b>suffered</b> <b>as</b> a result of Operation Bolo.|$|E
5|$|Ottawa {{was locked}} in a {{contract}} dispute with then-captain Alexei Yashin during the 1999–2000 season. Yashin held out for the entire season, hoping either to play elsewhere or claim his contract was for 1999–2000, not a year of service. The team responded by suspending him for the entire season and granting the captaincy to Daniel Alfredsson. Yashin tried to sign on with a team in Switzerland, but the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) banned him from playing internationally until the dispute with the Senators was resolved. An NHL arbitrator rejected Yashin's request {{to make him a}} free agent, instead ruling that he owed the Senators one more season if he ever returned to the NHL. The Senators even took legal action to recover damages <b>suffered</b> <b>as</b> a result of the dispute.|$|E

5|$|Several {{species of}} {{cockatoo}} can be serious agricultural pests. They are sometimes controlled by shooting, poisoning or capture followed by gassing. Non-lethal damage mitigation methods used include scaring, habitat manipulation {{and the provision}} of decoy food dumps or sacrifice crops to distract them from the main crop. They can be a nuisance in urban areas due to destruction of property. They maintain their bills in the wild by chewing on wood but, in suburbia, they may chew outdoor furniture, door and window frames; soft decorative timbers such as western red cedar are readily demolished. Birds may also target external wiring and fixtures such as solar water heaters, television antennae and satellite dishes. A business in central Melbourne <b>suffered</b> <b>as</b> sulphur-crested cockatoos repeatedly stripped the silicone sealant from the plate glass windows. Galahs and red-tailed black cockatoos have stripped electrical cabling in rural areas and tarpaulin is targeted elsewhere. Outside Australia, the Tanimbar corella is a pest on Yamdena Island where it raids maize crops.|$|E
5|$|St. Louis <b>suffered</b> <b>as</b> much or {{more than}} {{comparable}} cities {{in the early years}} of the Great Depression. Manufacturing output fell by 57 percent between 1929 and 1933, slightly more than the national average of 55 percent, and output remained low until World War II. Unemployment during the Depression was high in most urban areas, and St. Louis was no exception (see table). Black workers in St. Louis, as in many cities, suffered significantly higher unemployment than their white counterparts. To aid the unemployed, the city allocated funds starting in 1930 toward relief operations. In addition to city relief aid, New Deal programs such as the Public Works Administration employed thousands of St. Louisans. Civic improvement construction jobs also reduced the number of persons on direct relief aid by the late 1930s.|$|E

At age 13 Walter set out for a life on the road, but was raped by a fellow wanderer; author Bev Vincent hypothesized in The Road to the Dark Tower that Flagg's later actions towards Delain in The Eyes of the Dragon may have been revenge for the abuse he <b>suffered</b> <b>as</b> a child. Resisting the temptation to crawl back home, Padick instead moves towards his destiny; he learns various forms of magic, achieving a quasi-immortality.
