500|$|Furtado's second album, Folklore, was {{released}} in November 2003. The lead single is [...] "Powerless (<b>Say</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Want)" [...] and the second single is the ballad [...] "Try". The album was not as successful as her debut, {{partly due to the}} album's less [...] "poppy" [...] sound. [...] "Powerless (<b>Say</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Want)" [...] was later remixed, featuring Colombian rocker Juanes, who had previously worked with Furtado on his track [...] "Fotografía" [...] ("Photograph"). The two would collaborate again on [...] "Te Busqué" [...] ("I searched for you"), the single from Furtado's album Loose.|$|E
500|$|... "The {{ultimate}} thing {{behind the}} song {{is that if you}} don't express yourself, if you don't <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want, then you're not going to get it. And in effect you are chained down by your inability to <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> feel or go after what you want. No matter how in control you think are about sexuality in a relationship there is always the power struggle... always a certain amount of compromise. Of being beholden, if you love them. You do it because you choose to. No one put the chain around this neck but me. I wrote 'Express Yourself' to tell women around the world that pick and choose the best for yourself, before that chain around your neck, kills you instead. It's my take on how man can express what they want, the same prerogative should be there for a woman too." ...|$|E

500|$|Only a few {{of these}} shorts have been {{released}} on DVD. [...] "Good Night" [...] was included on The Simpsons Season 1 DVD. Five of these shorts were later used in the clip-show episode [...] "The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular" [...] on the half-hour show, which was released on the Season 7 DVD. These five shorts were [...] "Good Night", which was featured in its entirety, and portions of [...] "The Perfect Crime", [...] "Space Patrol", [...] "World War III", and [...] "Bathtime".

500|$|Smith had {{attempted}} to go to rehab several times, but {{found that he was}} unable to relate to the popular treatments for addicts that used a twelve-step program basis for treatment. [...] "I couldn't do the first step [...] I couldn't <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> were supposed to say and mean it." [...] In 2002, Smith went to the Neurotransmitter Restoration Center in Beverly Hills to start a course of treatment for his drug addiction. In one of his final interviews, he spoke about the center, [...] "What they do is an IV treatment where they put a needle in your arm, and you're on a drip bag, but the only thing that's in the drip bag is amino acids and saline solution. I was coming off of a lot of psych meds and other things. I was even on an antipsychotic, although I'm not psychotic." ...|$|E
500|$|... "If U Seek Amy" [...] {{runs through}} a dance-oriented beat and {{features}} many instruments, including keyboards, snare, bass drums, electric guitars and timpani. According to the sheet music published at musicnotes.com by Hal Leonard Corporation, the song has a beat of 130 {{beats per minute}} and is written in the key of A minor. Spears's vocal range spans from G3-C5. In the song, Spears seems {{to be looking for}} a woman named Amy in a club. It has been suggested that Amy is either Amy Winehouse or an alter ego of Spears herself. The verses end with the hookline [...] "Hahahehehahaho", which, according to Poppy Cossins of The Sun, is fitting to [...] "the album's [...] overtone". The chorus begins with the lines [...] "Love me, hate me / <b>Say</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want about me", a reference to the public's perception and fascination with Spears' life. This presents Spears both as [...] "an object of desire and a punching bag". According to Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph, this line also alludes to the public image of British singer Amy Winehouse.|$|E

500|$|... "Do What U Want" [...] is a mid-tempo synthpop and R track, drawing {{influence}} from 1980s-inspired throbbing synths and an electronic beat. Eric R. Danton of Rolling Stone {{described it as}} a [...] "muscular club beat". James Montgomery from MTV News said that a [...] "lurching, lascivious beat" [...] was the main backbone of the song, interspersed with Gaga's loud-voiced vocals, a [...] "corky" [...] chorus and Kelly's [...] "cool, coital" [...] singing. The song's chorus is built around arpeggios. Complex described its [...] "Do what you want, what you want with my body" [...] hook as [...] "catchy and somewhat raunchy". The song's lyrics represent themes of sexual submissiveness, with Gaga telling off detractors that her thoughts, dreams, and feelings are her own, no matter what one does with her body. Jim Farber of New York Daily News suggested [...] "Do What U Want" [...] to be a response to [...] "everyone who ever made a tart comment about her — which, by now, involves half the planet". Gaga and Kelly alternate singing the lines [...] "Do what u want/ What u want with my body/ Do what u want/ What u want with my body/ Write what you want, <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want about me/ If you want you know that I'm not sorry".|$|E
500|$|... "No Future" [...] {{was nearly}} {{cut from the}} record. It was {{inspired}} by punk rock history, as many songs—for example, the Sex Pistols' [...] "God Save the Queen"—contain a [...] "no future" [...] lyric. [...] "Home Is Such a Lonely Place" [...] is a ballad with [...] "clean arpeggiated finger-picking guitars with strings underneath it." [...] Its lyrics are themed around lost love; it emerged from an early-morning coffee meeting between Hoppus and Feldmann, who both imagined how lonely their homes would be when their children grow up and move away. [...] "Kings of the Weekend" [...] was also nearly moved off the final track listing, but kept because of its recognizable guitar riff. Feldmann described it as [...] "the party song. We've all had day jobs {{and we all know}} what it's like to have that day off to do what we want." [...] "Teenage Satellites" [...] is based around [...] "being a kid and not knowing who you are, not having enough courage to <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean." [...] It was the last song recorded for the album, and it was at first written without a hook or melody in mind. [...] "Left Alone" [...] made the album cut because the band liked Skiba's vocal performance. [...] "Rabbit Hole" [...] was one of Hoppus' favorites, and revolves around [...] "standing your ground and not falling for people's nonsense." ...|$|E

2500|$|Furtado's second album, Folklore, was {{released}} in November 2003. One of the tracks on the album, [...] "Childhood Dreams", was dedicated to her daughter, Nevis. The album includes the single [...] "Força" [...] (meaning [...] "strength"/ [...] "power" [...] or [...] "you can do it!" [...] in Portuguese), the official anthem of the 2004 European Football Championship. Furtado performed this song in Lisbon at the championship's final, in which Portugal's national team played. The lead single released was [...] "Powerless (<b>Say</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Want)" [...] and the second single was the ballad [...] "Try".

DreamWorks had just been sold to Universal Music Group {{at the time of the}} album's release. Eventually in 2005, DreamWorks Records, along with many of its artists, including Furtado, were absorbed into Geffen Records.
