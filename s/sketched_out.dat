5|$|The entire {{movie was}} <b>sketched</b> <b>out</b> via {{hand-drawn}} storyboards and then re-created as computer-generated 3D animatics {{with all of}} the 2D background photographs digitally painted to resemble the 1939 setting. With the animatics as a guide, grids were created to map camera and actor movements with digital characters standing in for the real actors. The grids were made into actual maps on the blue screen stage floor to help the actors move around invisible scenery.|$|E
5|$|The helmet of {{the arms}} was not {{specified}} in the charter, but the engraver <b>sketched</b> <b>out</b> a peer's helmet on the final design, which is used. This {{is contrary to the}} heraldic rules, as a society or corporation normally has an esquire's helmet; it is thought that either the engraver was ignorant of this rule, which was not strictly adhered to until around 1615, or that he used the peer's helmet as a compliment to Lord Brouncker, a peer and the first President of the Royal Society.|$|E
5|$|Nilo Rodis, who {{had worked}} on two {{previous}} Star Trek features, was appointed the role of art director, and worked with Shatner to establish the film's visual design. Shatner sought a grittier and more realistic feel to the Star Trek universe, and so the two worked together to visualize the film from start to finish. After Shatner explained the entire story in a day-long session, Rodis went home and <b>sketched</b> <b>out</b> each scene from the script. Shatner {{was pleased with the}} results, especially with Rodis' designs for Shatner's most expansive or dramatic shots.|$|E

5|$|The term Rosetta stone {{has been}} used idiomatically to {{represent}} a crucial key {{in the process of}} decryption of encoded information, especially when a small but representative sample is recognised as the clue to understanding a larger whole. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first figurative use of the term appeared in the 1902 edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica relating to an entry on the chemical analysis of glucose. Another use of the phrase is found in H. G. Wells' 1933 novel The Shape of Things to Come, where the protagonist finds a manuscript written in shorthand that provides a key to understanding additional scattered material that is <b>sketched</b> <b>out</b> in both longhand and on typewriter.|$|E
5|$|While {{waiting for}} the Convention to {{formally}} begin, James Madison <b>sketched</b> <b>out</b> his initial draft, which {{became known as the}} Virginia Plan and reflected his views as a strong nationalist. By the time the rest of the Virginia delegation arrived, most of the Pennsylvania delegation had arrived as well. They agreed on Madison's plan, and formed what came to be the predominant coalition. By the time the Convention started, the only blueprints that had been assembled were Madison's Virginia Plan, and Charles Pinckney's plan. As Pinckney didn't have a coalition behind his plan, Madison's plan was the starting point for deliberations.|$|E
5|$|Although Max insisted von Neumann {{attend school}} at the grade level {{appropriate}} to his age, he agreed to hire private tutors to give him advanced instruction in those areas {{in which he had}} displayed an aptitude. At the age of 15, he began to study advanced calculus under the renowned analyst Gábor Szegő. On their first meeting, Szegő was so astounded with the boy's mathematical talent that he was brought to tears. Some of von Neumann's instant solutions to the problems in calculus posed by Szegő, <b>sketched</b> <b>out</b> on his father's stationery, are still on display at the von Neumann archive in Budapest. By the age of 19, von Neumann had published two major mathematical papers, the second of which gave the modern definition of ordinal numbers, which superseded Georg Cantor's definition. At the conclusion of his education at the gymnasium, von Neumann sat for and won the Eötvös Prize, a national prize for mathematics.|$|E

5|$|Hatfield {{graduated}} from Salem High School (now North Salem High School) in 1940 and then enrolled at Willamette University, also in Salem. While attending Willamette, Hatfield became a brother of Alpha Phi Omega and Kappa Gamma Rho, which he later helped become {{a chapter of}} Beta Theta Pi. In college he also worked part-time for then Oregon Secretary of State Earl Snell, where {{he learned how to}} build a political base by sending out messages to potential voters after reading about life changes posted in newspapers, such as deaths and graduations. He also <b>sketched</b> <b>out</b> a political career path beginning with the state legislature and culminating in a spot in the United States Senate, with a blank for any position beyond the Senate. Hatfield {{graduated from}} Willamette in 1943 with a Bachelor of Arts degree after three years at the school. While at the school he lost his only election, for student body president.|$|E
5|$|Remi {{developed}} {{a love of}} cinema, favouring Winsor McCay's Gertie the Dinosaur and the films of Charlie Chaplin, Harry Langdon and Buster Keaton; his later work in the comic strip medium displayed an obvious influence from them in style and content. Although not a keen reader, he enjoyed the novels of British and American authors, such as Huckleberry Finn, Treasure Island, Robinson Crusoe and The Pickwick Papers, {{as well as the}} novels of Frenchman Alexandre Dumas. Drawing as a hobby, he <b>sketched</b> <b>out</b> scenes from daily life along the edges of his school books. Some of these illustrations were of German soldiers, because his four years of primary schooling at the Ixelles Municipal School No. 3 coincided with the First World War, during which Brussels was occupied by the German army. In 1919, his secondary education began at the secular Place de Londres in Ixelles, but in 1920 he was moved to Saint-Boniface School, an institution controlled by the archbishop where the teachers were Roman Catholic priests. Remi proved a successful student, being awarded prizes for excellence. He completed his secondary education in July 1925 as the top of his class.|$|E

25|$|The {{aircraft}} was first imagined by Jeana Yeager, Dick Rutan, and Dick's brother Burt Rutan {{when they were}} at lunch in 1981. The initial idea was first <b>sketched</b> <b>out</b> {{on the back of}} a napkin. Voyager was built in Mojave, California, over a period of five years. Voyager was built mainly by a group of volunteers working under both the Rutan Aircraft Factory and an organization set up under the name Voyager Aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Airport {{officials}} and city leaders say {{the merger of}} MCI's three terminals into one terminal is inevitable. They cite the expense of operating several security checkpoints within each terminal {{and the lack of}} concessions and retail space beyond security, as well as the operating costs of the airport itself as reasons for a new terminal. Consultants have been hired and five concepts {{for the future of the}} airport have been <b>sketched</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
25|$|Larocque had <b>sketched</b> <b>out</b> {{his plans}} on {{two pieces of}} plywood, which {{are part of the}} church's {{structure}} today, visible on the stairs to the cupola. To clear the building for construction and get a building permit, formal blueprints had to be sent to officials with the federal government in Ottawa. Larocque drew some up and sent them, only to have the officials send them back when they were unable to comprehend them.|$|E

25|$|Leavis's {{criticism}} {{is difficult to}} directly classify, {{but it can be}} grouped into four chronological stages. The first is that of his early publications and essays including New Bearings in English Poetry (1932) and Revaluation (1936). Here he was concerned primarily with reexamining poetry from the seventeenth to twentieth centuries, and this was accomplished under the strong influence of T. S. Eliot. Also during this early period Leavis <b>sketched</b> <b>out</b> his views about university education.|$|E
25|$|He hired Edward Pearce Casey, {{best known}} at the time {{for his work on}} the Library of Congress's Thomas Jefferson Building (as it is now known), and Arthur Durant Sneden, then chief {{designer}} for the New York City Board of Education. Casey <b>sketched</b> <b>out</b> the main plan of the building and Sneden concentrated on the details. At the insistence of Howes, who had traveled abroad and was fond of English country churches, they hewed to that model.|$|E
25|$|From the {{beginning}} of his career in journalism, Claymoor's style irritated more senior writers, prompting them to caricature him in their fiction. In 1883, Ion Ghica and Dimitrie C. Ollănescu-Ascanio had <b>sketched</b> <b>out</b> a comedy of mores, which, if finalized, was to feature a leading character based on Claymoor. Anton Bacalbașa also refers to Claymoor as the favorite writer of Moș Teacă's ignorant wife, and gives him a brief role in one of his sketches (where Claymoore's homosexuality is again hinted at).|$|E

40|$|Advances in sensor {{technology}} and real-time analysis of neurophysiological data have enabled {{the use of}} live biofeedback in information systems {{and the development of}} neuro-adaptive information systems. In this article, we transfer this notion to the use of foreign neurophysiological data. We <b>sketch</b> <b>out</b> an experimental approach and research model for investigating the impact of such foreign data in a trust scenario. We argue that foreign live biofeedback may be a powerful means to establish social presence and thus trust among the parties. Moreover, we discuss controversies such technology is likely to raise and <b>sketch</b> <b>out</b> potential strategies for IS service providers in this regard...|$|R
50|$|Using the {{insights}} of transformational grammar, Kuno <b>sketches</b> <b>out</b> what standard grammars do not tell their readers, i.e., when otherwise normal grammatical patterns can not be used. In this sense, the work constituted an innovative 'grammar of ungrammatical sentences'.|$|R
25|$|An early {{publication}} from Games Designers' Workshop {{noted that}} The minor races, {{of which there}} are hundreds within the area of known space, will be largely left up to individual referees. GDW's quarterly publication, The Journal of the Travellers' Aid Society designed by Loren K. Wiseman, <b>sketched</b> <b>out</b> about one race per quarter, starting with Aslan in Issue 7, with no signs of letting up. Taken together with aliens casually mentioned or introduced in separate scenarios or adventures—often arbitrarily—there is therefore no indication that the number of minor races is limited in any sense.|$|E
25|$|As we have seen, Wagner <b>sketched</b> <b>out</b> {{the theme}} for the Ride of the Valkyries on 23 July 1851; other than this, the {{earliest}} musical sketches for Die Walküre date from the summer of 1852. But {{it was not until}} 28 June 1854 that Wagner began to transform these into a complete draft of all three acts of the opera. This preliminary draft (Gesamtentwurf), which was completed by 27 December 1854, was written in pencil and shows a greater degree of orchestral elaboration than the corresponding draft of Das Rheingold.|$|E
25|$|In 1961 letter, Purcell {{expressed}} his gratitude to Edna Cutts for opening {{her home to}} students and voiced the desire to have a share in any attempts to restore the house or make it public. Purcell also <b>sketched</b> <b>out</b> a scheme for expanding the space {{around the house and}} setting up a trust fund for the building. He imagined reproducing the Purcell and Elmslie dining suite designed for Mrs. William H. Hanna of Chicago. The suite is now {{in the collection of the}} Minneapolis Institute of Art, renting the space to young couples at low rates, and allowing regular public entry.|$|E
