50|$|NTS {{has sought}} to {{establish}} a national educational standard for Pakistan {{but at the same}} time as an organization cannot and has not catered to the regionally diverse Pakistani nation. NTS resources are geographically restricted and both quantitatively and qualitatively limited. As stated by interface - an educational consultancy. Its contention as an independent NGO can also be challenged as it is affiliated with numerous regular testing centers of Comsats (as <b>semi-Government</b> <b>body</b> or inter-Governmental organization) & Public / Governmental education Institutions for their entrance / admission exams. A recent controversy of regular operational error has also arisen for Phd. assessment tests. The credibility / irresponsibility on the part of NTS officials has disqualified the candidates from applying in MPhil/PhD programs at public and private sector institutes because under HEC rules, they do not have any proof of clearing the test.The overall process lacks credibility & transparency due to the un-disclosed nature of alternative processes for any participants, when they do not fall in the norms of the operating procedure (i.e. errors / loop holes) due to complexities that arise from multifarious of socioeconomic nature of challenges in present-day environment of Pakistan.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{criticizes the}} theory of the embourgoisement of the Australian urban workers in the period from 1950 to 1972 and its {{apparent}} effect upon their political affiliations. The period was marked by sustained economic growth, a burgeoning population and the consolidation of Australia as a small industrialised country. The promise of full employment and improved wages and salaries attracted urban workers into the new industries and away from their old communities. The traditional bonds of work, home and political affiliations were displaced by home ownership and the acquisition of previously unattainable consumer goods. This thesis argues that in this environment new communities of affluent workers emerged united by their aims to maintain their prosperity and achieve a better quality life. Of the number of Australian cities which expanded in this period Wollongong and Canberra have been chosen to illustrate two different kinds of communities. Wollongong was and is a working class city; Canberra middle class. Wollongong, an industrial city in the State of New South Wales, grew largely {{as a consequence of the}} investment in the BHP steel works. Canberra, in contrast, is the seat of the Federal Government and the centre for the Commonwealth Administration with its growth heavily dependent on Federal Government funding. In Wollongong the South Coast Labour Council was committed to the support of workers and their families and the improvement of the urban environment, providing experienced leadership in the art of popular protest. In Canberra the emerging middleclass community was represented in their pursuit of a new community life by the wholehearted endeavours of James Fraser, the Labor Member of the House of Representatives for the Australian Capital Territory who saw himself as both 2 ̆ 2 State Member and Local Councillor 2 ̆ 2. In Wollongong, many workers 2 ̆ 7 homes were located along unmade streets where the sullage flowed from primitive sewerage systems. The city lacked adequate schools, hospitals and recreation areas and any improvement was frustrated for many years by the limitations of Local Government and the ongoing conflict between the State and Federal Governments. Although Canberra escaped the worst of these urban disasters its development was slow, dogged by political infighting and administrative incompetence and the failure of the 1948 Development Programme. Following the recommendations of the Select Committee on the Development of Canberra, the National Capital Development Commission was established in 1957. By the 1960 s Canberra was seen as the model for comprehensive urban planning. But as the Federal Capital emerged from a small county town into Australia 2 ̆ 7 s largest inland city the supply of land ran out and consequently there was a major price rise. Moreover the dissatisfaction of the people reached new heights when there was a significant increase in land rent on re-valued land. Consequently in the late 1960 s these urban problems became politically important and the creation of new alliances between different social groups lent respectability public protest. This thesis challenges the widely held view that affluence led urban workers to desert their affiliation to the Labor Party. In Wollongong and Canberra by 1960 affluent workers who saw themselves as homeowners increased their support for their local representatives of the Federal Labor Party. For the State and Federal Governments 2 ̆ 7 commitment to building a new industrial complex in Wollongong and the development of the National Capital extinguished any interest they had in the quality of life of the people. And they were joined by other groups who came to reject a jaded Federal Coalition lacking initiative in dealing with the urban problems. E G Whitlam and the Federal Labor Party of 1970 offered a new concept of Australian Government and policies which appealed to a confident and empowered electorate. The Introduction to this thesis will review the changing urban process in western industrialised nations after the Second World War. It will touch upon the movement of people from country to cities and from Europe to the New World. Governments were concerned to maintain economic growth and avoid at all costs a return to the economic instability of the pre-war years. Consequently full employment brought a new and sustained affluence to urban workers. The growth of bureaucracies, world organisations and the effect of changing industrial procedures and higher education provided new opportunities for the working class. In the United Kingdom and some European countries large scale plans were made to house the changing population in an expanding suburbia. Many theories which were developed during this period argued that a new elitism emerged with the growth of suburbia because the traditional working class mores were transformed by home ownership, access to consumer goods, cars and an adoption of middle class 2 ̆ 2 consumerist 2 ̆ 2 values. However, the well-known American sociologists Gans and Berger considered that affluence and a house in the suburbs did not alter the commitment of the blue collar workers to their old political affiliations. This view was supported in England by Willmott who maintained that the changes to political affiliations were minimal. In this context of rapidly and radically changing western societies Australia is unique being a highly urbanised society with the larger part of its population living in the cities. As early as 1840 thirty percent of Australians lived in towns of more than 2500 inhabitants. The continuing expansion of the cities was due to immigration rather than the drift of population from the country. But, as in other westernized countries, by the 1960 s the structure of the workforce had changed with a significant rise in the employment of women and an increase in the number of professional and technical workers. Wollongong and Canberra grew rapidly into new cities with residential areas dominated by family dwellings with their own gardens. This changing structure of the workforce and the growth of suburbia influenced scholarly opinion. It was argued by many that affluence reduced the influence of the Australian Labor Party and the emphasis on homeownership promoted that of the Liberal Party. This thesis reflects the changing face of urban Australia and the political consequences of the Federal Coalition 2 ̆ 7 s neglect of the needs of an articulate, affluent and confident urban working class. Part One describes the history of the growth of the new cities Wollongong and Canberra. Part Two discusses the problems associated with an inflexible Constitution and the financial relationship between the Federal, State and Local Governments. Part Three concentrates on the period from 1965 to 1972 when political parties were in transition and the consequences of population and economic growth became electorally important. The introduction to Part One - Australia 2 ̆ 7 s New Cities - provides a background to Australia 2 ̆ 7 s post World War II transition into a small industrialized country. It focuses the changes in trade, foreign and immigration policies. It highlights the problems of urban development in Wollongong and Canberra. Chapter One - Wollongong - Red Belt - concentrates on the history of the working class, the old mining communities and the growth of the union movement and organisation within Wollongong. It shows that despite the vicissitudes of the coal industry and the economic and social disaster of the Depression, the union movement survived and eventually flourished in the 1950 s and 1960 s. More importantly, a concern for the social as well as the industrial needs of its members remained part of the philosophy of the movement. Chapter Two - Wollongong Boom Town - describes the growth of Wollongong as an important industrial town dominated by the steel works and to a lesser extent by the mining industry. To illustrate the strength of the labour movement in this town the history of the South Coast Labour Council is described with emphasis on the 1950 s when it defeated the Industrial Groupers for control of the Council. The 1960 s witnessed the emergence of a well-organised Council concerned with the poor urban environment of the city and the new community of affluent workers who were homeowners and the consolidation of the allegiance of the workers to socialism and the Labor. Chapter Three - Canberra - Conflict City - outlines the development of Canberra, from an unattractive outpost of Commonwealth Administration to its blossoming, in the early 1960 s, as the successful and flourishing National Capital. It describes the growth of the white collar public service union and the contribution made by J R (Jim) Fraser to the development of the new community of well-educated and affluent people. But central to the theme is the continuing conflict which dogged the city from its inception, first between politicians and then between the citizens and the political administration. The Introduction to Part Two focuses on the problems which faced the new communities of Wollongong and Canberra as they strove to achieve a better quality of life. These problems were associated with the inflexibility of the Constitution and the financial imbalance between the three tiers of Government. It outlines the responsibilities of local government and <b>semi-government</b> <b>bodies</b> and the emergence of new forms of protest against the endemic indifference of State and Federal Governments to the needs of the affluent urban worke. Chapter One - The Limitations of the Constitution - deals with the ongoing dissatisfaction of people with centralised State Government Administrations and the overall inability of these Governments to cope with their greater responsibilities. The unsuccessful attempts to change the Commonwealth Constitution and establishment of new states, decentralisation or regional organisations as|$|R
