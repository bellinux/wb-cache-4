500|$|The {{scientific}} {{subjects of}} Wright's paintings {{from this time}} were meant {{to appeal to the}} wealthy scientific circles in which he moved. While never a member himself, he had strong connections with the Lunar Society: he was friends with members John Whitehurst and Erasmus Darwin, as well as Josiah Wedgwood, who later commissioned paintings from him. The inclusion of the moon in the painting was a nod to their monthly meetings, which were held when the moon was full. Like The Orrery, Wright apparently painted Air Pump without a commission, and the picture was purchased by Dr Benjamin Bates, who already owned Wright's Gladiator. An Aylesbury physician, patron of the arts and hedonist, Bates was a diehard member of the Hellfire Club who, despite his excesses, lived to be over 90. Wright's account book shows a number of prices for the painting: Pd£200 is shown in one place and £210 in another, but Wright had written to Bates asking for £130, stating that the low price [...] "might much injure me in the future sale of my pictures, and when I <b>send</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> receipt for the money I shall acknowledge a greater sum." [...] Whether Bates ever paid the full amount is not recorded; Wright only notes in his account book that he received £30 in part payment.|$|E

2500|$|The Dowland Manuscript {{was first}} {{printed in the}} Gentleman's Magazine in 1815. The contributor, James Dowland, wrote [...] "For the {{gratification}} of your readers, I <b>send</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> curious address respecting Freemasonry which not long since came into my possession. It is written on a long roll of parchment, in a very clear hand apparently in the 17th century, and probably was copied from a MS. of earlier date." [...] This earlier date is still estimated to be around 1550, making the Dowland the second oldest prose constitutions known.

2500|$|The {{compilation}} album The Hammer Party, combining Lungs and Bulldozer, {{was also}} released through Homestead Records in 1986, but {{later that year}} Big Black had a falling out with the label and its distributor, Dutch East India Trading. According to Albini, Dutch East India's accounting practices were [...] "always fucked. They would do every sleazy, cheap trick to avoid paying you, like <b>send</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> check that wasn't signed or <b>send</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> check that had a different numeral and literal amount." [...] Homestead then asked to make five hundred copies of a 12-inch single of [...] "Il Duce" [...] for free distribution to radio stations. The band agreed {{on the condition that}} the single was not to be offered for sale, since the song had already been released as a 7-inch single in 1985 and, according to Albini, [...] "We didn't want our audience milked for extra money to buy an alternate format." [...] A few weeks after the single's release, Albini began seeing copies for sale in record stores outside of Chicago. He soon found out that the 12-inch single was being sold both in the United States and abroad as a high-priced [...] "collector's item". Though Homestead claimed not to be selling copies, Albini telephoned one of the label's salespeople posing as a record buyer and was told that they would sell him copies, but not in Chicago. As a result of the deception, Albini and Big Black severed ties with Homestead and Dutch East India. Though the band was receiving lucrative offers from major labels, they chose to remain independent and signed to Touch and Go Records, Albini being good friends with label head Corey Rusk.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout the English Civil War therefore, {{publishers}} and writers remained answerable to the law. [...] State {{control of the}} press was tightened in the Licensing Order of 1643, but although the new regime was arguably as restrictive as the monopoly that the Stationers' Company once enjoyed, parliament was unable to control the number of renegade presses that flourished during the Interregnum. [...] The freedoms ensured by the Bill of Rights 1689 led indirectly to the refusal in 1695 of the Parliament of England to renew the Licensing of the Press Act 1662, a law which required all printing presses to be licensed by Parliament. [...] This lapse led to a freer press, and {{a rise in the}} volume of printed matter. [...] Jonathan Swift wrote to a friend in New York, [...] "I could <b>send</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> great deal of news from the Republica Grubstreetaria, which was never in greater altitude." ...|$|E
2500|$|On January 1, 1965, miffed {{at having}} {{to work on the}} holiday, Sales ended his live {{broadcast}} by encouraging his young viewers to tiptoe into their still-sleeping parents' bedrooms and remove those [...] "funny green pieces of paper with pictures of U.S. Presidents" [...] from their pants and pocketbooks. [...] "Put them in an envelope and mail them to me", Soupy instructed the children. [...] "And I'll <b>send</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> postcard from Puerto Rico!" [...] Several days later, a chagrined Soupy announced that money (mostly Monopoly money) was unexpectedly being received in the mail. He explained that he had been joking and announced that the contributions would be donated to charity. As parents' complaints increased, WNEW's management felt compelled to suspend Sales for two weeks. Young viewers picketed Channel 5. The uproar surrounding Sales' suspension increased his popularity. Sales described the incident in his 2001 autobiography Soupy Sez! My Life and Zany Times.|$|E

[...] The {{women of the}} UK were prevented from direct communication with the women of Germany because of the war. Instead, they sent their missive to America which {{was at that time}} a neutral nation. The letter continued, [...] "The Christmas message sounds like mockery to a world at war, but those of us who wished and still wish for peace may surely offer a solemn greeting to such of you who feel as we do." [...] The letter mentioned that, as in South Africa during the Second Boer War (1899–1902) and in the Balkan Wars of 1912–1913, [...] "the brunt of modern war falls upon non-combatants, and the conscience of the world cannot bear the sight." ...|$|E

2500|$|In November 1894, Alexander III {{died and}} Nicholas mounted the throne as Emperor. At the time, Nicholas had no children, thus {{according}} {{to the laws of}} succession of the Russian Empire, the Grand Duke George became Tsarevich (formally Tsesarevich, denoting the heir presumptive or heir apparent to the throne as opposed to any son of the Tsar, although the latter title fell into disuse in 1721 and was gradually supplanted by the more specific use of Tsarevich). George's ill-health had forced him to relocate to Likani. It was impossible for him to return to St. Petersburg for the funeral of his father, Alexander III. The doctors had forbidden it. Nicholas wrote to his brother, [...] "... constantly pray to God to <b>send</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> full and speedy recovery, and to comfort you, because it is so much more difficult to be alone after such great sorrow than it is for us who are at least together!" [...] George also missed the christenings of Nicholas' elder daughters, Olga and Tatiana. Shortly after the birth of Nicholas' third daughter, Maria, in June 1899, George wrote to his brother, [...] "I am terribly sad that I have not yet been able to see your daughters and get to know them; but what can I do! It means it's not my fate, and everything is the will of God." ...|$|E
