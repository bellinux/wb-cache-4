25|$|Analyzing the {{situation}} in the Kura-Araxes period, T.A. Akhundov notes the lack of unity in funerary monuments, which he considers more than <b>strange</b> <b>in</b> the framework of a single culture; for the funeral rites reflect the deep culture-forming foundations and are weakly influenced by external customs. There are non-kurgan and kurgan burials, burials in ground pits, in stone boxes and crypts, in the underlying ground strata and on top of them; using both the round and rectangular burials; there are also substantial differences in the typical corpse position. Burial complexes of Kura-Araxes culture sometimes also include cremation.|$|E

Proponents of double sentence spacing state that the extra space between sentences enhances readability by providing clearer breaks between sentences and making text appear more legible, particularly noting the very small visual difference between a dot and a comma.|$|E

40|$|The {{idea that}} the {{reduction}} of the <b>strange</b> quark suppression <b>in</b> string fragmentation leads to the enhancement of <b>strange</b> particle yield <b>in</b> nucleus-nucleus collisions is applied to study the singly and multiply <b>strange</b> particle production <b>in</b> p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions at 158 A GeV/c. In this mechanism the strange quark suppression factor is related to the effective string tension, which increases in turn with the increase of the energy, of the centrality and of the mass of colliding system. The WA 97 observation that the strange particle enhancement increases with the increasing of centrality and of <b>strange</b> quark content <b>in</b> multiply <b>strange</b> particles <b>in</b> Pb-Pb collisions with respect to p-Pb collisions was accounted reasonably.
