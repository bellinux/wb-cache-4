Edible vegetable oils are used in food, both in cooking and as supplements.

5|$|Cheadle Hulme did {{not grow}} around a church like many English villages, but instead grew from several hamlets {{that existed in}} the area. Many of the names of these hamlets still appear in the names of areas, {{including}} Smithy Green, Lane End, Gill Bent, and Grove Lane. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>many</b> farms such as Orish Mere Farm and Hursthead Farm which covered the area also retain their names in schools that were built in their place.|$|E
5|$|Despite Lee's {{hope for}} an early start, it took all morning to arrange the {{infantry}} assault force. Neither Lee's nor Longstreet's headquarters sent orders to Pickett to have his division on the battlefield by daylight. Historian Jeffrey D. Wert blames this oversight on Longstreet, describing it either as a misunderstanding of Lee's verbal order or a mistake. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>many</b> criticisms of Longstreet's Gettysburg performance by the postbellum Lost Cause authors cite this failure as evidence that Longstreet deliberately undermined Lee's plan for the battle.|$|E
5|$|Outsourcing {{is among}} <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>many</b> reasons for {{increased}} competition within developing countries. Aside {{from being a}} reason for competition, many First World countries see outsourcing, in particular offshore outsourcing, {{as an opportunity for}} increased income. As a consequence, the skill level of production in foreign countries handling the outsourced services increases within the economy; and the skill level within the domestic developing countries can decrease. It is because of competition (including outsourcing) that Robert Feenstra and Gordon Hanson predict {{that there will be a}} rise of 15–33 percent in inequality amongst these countries.|$|E

Scholars variously attribute such criticism to ignorance, misunderstanding or sectarian bias on <b>the</b> part <b>of</b> <b>some</b> observers, {{as well as}} unscrupulous practices by some Shaktas.

In the Disney film Dinosaur, an Iguanodon named Aladar {{served as the}} protagonist with three other iguanodonts as other main characters; a loosely related ride {{of the same name}} at Disney's Animal Kingdom is based around bringing an Iguanodon back to the present. Iguanodon is one of the three dinosaur genera that inspired Godzilla; the other two were Tyrannosaurus and Stegosaurus.

A recent collision of a comet with a planet occurred in July 1994 when Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 broke up into pieces and collided with Jupiter.|$|E
