That same day, 10 September, Suwito asked for Britain to avoid a terrible 'misunderstanding,' and in a secret offer asked them to use the Lombok Strait instead. While further away from Jakarta, it was still claimed by Indonesia and might help the British attempt to save face while not <b>stepping</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> war they did not truly desire. With the Foreign Office's backing, Thorneycroft and Prime Minister Alec Douglas-Home approved the compromise and notified Suwito that the ships would take the Lombok Strait instead. Suwito appeared, according to eyewitnesses, [...] "extremely relieved" [...] at having avoided full conflict. The Victorious, after rendezvousing with the destroyer HMS Hampshire along with the frigates HMS Dido and HMS Berwick, sailed safely through the Lombok Strait on 12 September.|$|E
500|$|When {{it became}} clear that Foster would skip Hannibal, the {{production}} team considered several different actresses, including Cate Blanchett, Angelina Jolie, Gillian Anderson, Hilary Swank, Ashley Judd, Helen Hunt and Julianne Moore. Hopkins asked his agent if he had any [...] "power" [...] over casting. He informed De Laurentiis that he knew Moore, with whom he had worked on Surviving Picasso, and thought her a [...] "terrific actress". Although Hopkins' agent told him he had no contractual influence on casting, Scott thought it correct to discuss who would be Hopkins' [...] "leading lady". Scott said he was [...] "really surprised to find that [...] had five of the top actresses in Hollywood wanting it." [...] Moore would eventually secure the part. Scott said his decision was swayed in favor of Moore because: [...] "She is a true chameleon. She can be a lunatic in Magnolia, a vamp in An Ideal Husband, a porn star in Boogie Nights and a romantic in The End of the Affair." [...] "Julianne Moore, once Jodie decided to pass, was always top of my list," [...] said Scott on his female lead. Moore talked about <b>stepping</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> role made famous by another actress: [...] "The new Clarice would be very different. Of course people are going to compare my interpretation with that of Jodie Foster's... but this film {{is going to be very}} different." ...|$|E

2500|$|The club's Feijenoord Stadion, {{located in}} the IJsselmonde {{district}} of Rotterdam, is nicknamed De Kuip, Dutch for The Tub. It was built in 1937 {{and is one of}} the major European stadiums. It has 51,117 seats and has hosted a record of ten finals of UEFA club competitions, including the 2002 UEFA Cup Final fittingly won by Feyenoord.

2500|$|When Fra Angelico and {{his assistants}} {{went to the}} Vatican to {{decorate}} the chapel of Pope Nicholas, the artist was again confronted {{with the need to}} please the very wealthiest of clients. In consequence, walking into the small chapel is like <b>stepping</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> jewel box. The walls are decked with the brilliance of colour and gold that one sees in the most lavish creations of the Gothic painter Simone Martini at the Lower Church of St Francis of Assisi, a hundred years earlier. Yet Fra Angelico has succeeded in creating designs which continue to reveal his own preoccupation with humanity, with humility and with piety. The figures, in their lavish gilded robes, have the sweetness and gentleness for which his works are famous. According to Vasari: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{first player}} tosses the marker also called a [...] "lucky" [...] unto the court. This object should {{land in the}} square without bouncing, sliding, or rolling out. It is {{typically}} a small flat stone, coin, bean bag, or small chain with a charm. The marker must land completely within the square without touching the line. The player then hops through the course, skipping the square with the marker in it. Single squares must be hopped on one foot. For the first single square, either foot may be used. Side-by-side squares are straddled, with the left foot landing in the left square, and the right foot landing in the right square. Optional squares marked [...] "Safe", [...] "Home", or [...] "Rest" [...] are neutral squares, and may be hopped through in any manner without penalty. After hopping into [...] "Safe", [...] "Home", or [...] "Rest", the player must {{then turn around and}} return through the course (square 9, then squares 8 and 7, next square 6, and so forth) on one or two legs depending on the square until reaching the square with the marker. The player stops in the square before the marker and reaches down to retrieve the marker and continue the course as stated, without touching a line or <b>stepping</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> square with another player's marker.|$|E

2500|$|Bates said {{on using}} themes and motifs in the score, [...] "Very few {{movies that are}} made these days are fantastical enough to sustain huge, bold {{identifiable}} themes. Even {{with the majority of}} the comic-book films, they have a tendency to be steeped in a realism that would be disturbed or interrupted by highly emotive, melodic themes, and it seems like {{a lot of the stuff}} going in these films is propulsive and somewhat cold emotionally." [...] He felt that Guardians of the Galaxy did not fit this model, and [...] "unabashedly embraced leitmotifs for the array of cosmic characters" [...] that appear in it. Bates described creating a new main theme for a Marvel franchise as [...] "the most rewarding aspect of <b>stepping</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> movie like this". Gunn asked for [...] "something kickass that a 4-year-old would remember", and Bates came up with the theme by [...] "noodling" [...] on an electric guitar. The villain Ronan's theme is quoted in full only once in the film, as Bates and Gunn wanted him to be more serious and scary which they felt would be undermined by a loud, melodic theme. His presence is generally represented with tones [...] "chock full of low-brass" [...] and synths. Bates has [...] "some spongy synthesizers pulsing through" [...] the motif for Groot, which he developed in pre-production. Bates said that he would have infused the score with more of those electronic elements if it was not for the [...] "frenetic working process" [...] on the film.|$|E
2500|$|Parodies of Superman did {{not take}} long to appear, with Mighty Mouse {{introduced}} in [...] "The Mouse of Tomorrow" [...] animated short in 1942. While the character swiftly took {{on a life of}} its own, moving beyond parody, other animated characters soon took their turn to parody the character. In 1943, Bugs Bunny was featured in a short, Super-Rabbit, which sees the character gaining powers through eating fortified carrots. This short ends with Bugs <b>stepping</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> phone booth to change into a real [...] "Superman" [...] and emerging as a U.S. Marine. In 1956 Daffy Duck assumes the mantle of [...] "Cluck Trent" [...] in the short [...] "Stupor Duck", a role later reprised in various issues of the Looney Tunes comic book. In the United Kingdom Monty Python created the character Bicycle Repairman, who fixes bicycles on a world full of Supermen, for a sketch in series of their BBC show. Also on the BBC was the sitcom My Hero, which presented Thermoman as a slightly dense Superman pastiche, attempting to save the world and pursue romantic aspirations. In the United States, Saturday Night Live has often parodied the figure, with Margot Kidder reprising her role as Lois Lane in a 1979 episode. The manga and anime series Dr. Slump featured the character Suppaman; a short, fat, pompous man who changes into a thinly veiled Superman-like alter-ego by eating a sour-tasting umeboshi. Jerry Seinfeld, a noted Superman fan, filled his series Seinfeld with references to the character and in 1997 asked for Superman to co-star with him in a commercial for American Express. The commercial aired during the 1998 NFL Playoffs and Super Bowl, Superman animated in the style of artist Curt Swan, again at the request of Seinfeld. Superman has also been used as reference point for writers, with Steven T. Seagle's graphic novel Superman: It's a Bird exploring Seagle's feelings on his own mortality as he struggles to develop a story for a Superman tale. Brad Fraser used the character as a reference point for his play Poor Super Man, with The Independent noting the central character, a gay man who has lost many friends to AIDS as someone who [...] "identifies all the more keenly with Superman's alien-amid-deceptive-lookalikes status." [...] Superman's image was also used in an AIDS awareness campaign by French organization AIDES. Superman was depicted as emaciated and breathing from an oxygen tank, demonstrating that no-one is beyond the reach of the disease, and it can destroy the lives of everyone.|$|E
