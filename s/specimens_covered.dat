500|$|Aureoboletus mirabilis is edible, yet {{tasteless}} {{according to}} Murrill, who also noted [...] "this {{is one of}} the most difficult species to preserve, owing to its extremely juicy consistency". In contrast, modern field guides suggest this species to be an excellent edible. The Polish Heritage Cookery book opines that in taste, only Boletus edulis surpasses it. When sauteed in butter, the flesh has been noted to have a lemony taste. However, field <b>specimens</b> <b>covered</b> with a white mold, Sepedonium ampullosporum, should not be consumed.|$|E
50|$|The {{case was}} of the variety known as giraffe. The space under the {{keyboard}} was enclosed, a knee-hold being left in which were two pedals used to set in rotation a large wooden cylinder fixed just behind the keyboard over the levers, {{and covered with a}} roll-top similar to those of modern office desks. The cylinder (in some <b>specimens</b> <b>covered</b> with chamois leather) tapered towards the treble-end. When a key was depressed, a little tongue of wood, one end of which stopped the string, was pressed against the revolving cylinder, and the vibrations produced by friction were transmitted to the string and reinforced as in the piano and violin by the soundboard. The adjustment of the parts and the velocity of the cylinder required delicacy and great nicety, for if the little wooden tongues rested too lightly upon the cylinder or the strings, harmonics were produced, and the note jumped to the octave or twelfth.Sometimes when chords were played the touch became so heavy that two performers were required, as in the early medieval organistrum, the prototype of the harmonichord. Carl Maria von Weber must have had some opinion of the possibilities of the harmonichord, which in tone resembled the glass harmonica, since he composed a concerto with orchestral accompaniment for the instrument.|$|E
30|$|Another {{proposed}} antibacterial mechanism involves chitosan {{forming a}} barrier on the bacterial surface, preventing entrance of nutrients (Zheng and Zhu 2003).

Also in support of this mechanism, we observed bacteria <b>specimens</b> <b>covered</b> with chitosan via electron microscopy, and bacteria in large aggregates of chitosan via florescence microscopy.

40|$|Constitutive {{parameters}} identification for elasto-plastic fracture is {{a complex}} problem due to the interplay between two forms of material nonlinearity, viz. plasticity and cohesive fracture. In the present study we examine this problem in relation to Copper <b>specimens</b> <b>covered</b> by Silver used in photovoltaic modules as electrical conductors. Uniaxial tensile tests on un-notched and notched specimens are performed with a tensile stage inside a scanning electron microscope, monitoring crack growth for each imposed far-field displacement. Parameters identification is then performed by considering an elasto-plastic constitutive relation with isotropic hardening for the continuum and a polynomial cohesive zone model (CZM) with two free parameters. For a better numerical-experimental fitting, a four-parameter CZM {{should be used to}} independently control the CZM stiffness and the fracture energy. To do so effectively, a constrained optimization procedure with a two-scale objective function is outlined...|$|E

Aluminum <b>specimens</b> <b>covered</b> with porous type anodic oxide films were irradiated with a pulsed Nd-YAG laser to remove the oxide films locally, and then thin Ni layers were deposited at areas where film had been removed. Polypyrrole could be successfully deposited only on the Ni layer by anodic polarization of the specimens in pyrrole monomer solution, and a polypyrrole / Ni bilayer-structure could be obtained by dissolution of the aluminum substrate and anodic oxide film in NaOH solutions. The bilayer structure was found to be inactive to doping and dedoping of ions during anodic and cathodic polarization.

The detector can identify calcite in visible/NIR (350 - 2500 nm) spectra of both laboratory <b>specimens</b> <b>covered</b> by ferric dust and rocks in Mars analogue field environments. The ANN was trained using the Backpropagation algorithm with sigmoid activation neurons.

We cross-validated several ANN architectures, training on 9, 900 spectra and testing on the remaining 100. The best performing ANN correctly detected, with perfect accuracy, the presence (or absence) of carbonate in spectral data taken on field samples from the Mojave desert and clean, pure marbles from CT.

The PPy layer didn’t lose its electro-conductivity when the specimen was immersed in NaOH solution after connecting with a Pt plate, while the conductivity was lost after immersion of the specimen alone. The immersion with Pt connecting suppressed the reduction of PPy, and enabled the fabrication of PPy/Au actuators.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} presented in the paper is to create the express-method for the estimation {{of the influence of}} the anticorrosive treatment made by surfactant compounds on aluminium alloys fatigue. As a material for the tests the aluminium alloy D 16 AT widely used in aviation industry has been selected. The method is based on the phenomenon of the initiation and development of the deformation relief on the surface of alclad alloys under the cyclical loading. The intensity of the relief indicates the accumulated fatigue damage. The analysis of the relief is provided by the computer aided optical method. The comparison of the deformation relief on the <b>specimens</b> <b>covered</b> by the inhibiting corrosion compounds with the surface relief of uncovered components gives the possibility to make conclusion about the influence of the covering on the fatigue process. The influence of the surfactants on the metal fatigue can be observed and monitored on the initial stage of fatigue. The application of the method allows preventing negative side effects of the anticorrosive treatments, selecting the optimum compound for the protections. ? ?????? ???????? ??????????? ????????-?????? ??????? ???????????????? ????????? ????????????????? ??????????????? ????????? ????????? ?? ????????? ??????????? ???????. ? ?????? ?????? ? ??????? ???????????? ? ???????? ??????????????? ??????? ???????????, ?? ???????????? ???????? ????? ?????? ? ??????????? ??????????? ???????????. ????????? ??????????????? ??????? ??????????? ????????? ???????????, ???????????? ????????????????? ????????? ? ?? ??????? ????????????????? ????????, ????????? ?????? ? ??????? ???????? ?? ??????? ???????????? ???????????...|$|E

All specimens were stored for 1 week at 37 °C and 100 % humidity. The dent in surfaces were cleaned and treated using the GLUMA adhesive system, followed by placement of composite core build-ups. Debonding of t he core material was accomplished using the Accuforce Elite test system. Results: There was a significant reduction in bond strength for the <b>specimens</b> <b>covered</b> with eugenol temporary cement (p <. 0001), but no significant difference was found between the control group and the group treated with eugenol-free temporary cement.

40|$|Severe {{channelling}} corrosion {{of offshore}} water injection pipelines (WIP) {{is a major}} threat for industry. Both microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC) and under deposit corrosion (UDC) are suspected. A pilot study is reported herein to investigate the contributing factors {{for the formation of}} channelling corrosion. This was conducted by exposing half-pipe steel pipelines to different WIP environments. The effect of the presence of deposits, filtration and UV irradiation and nitrate addition were considered. The steel specimens were recovered after 12 days, 180 days and 365 days of exposure. EDS analysis of corrosion products showed evidence of MIC being involved in the corrosion process in natural biotic seawater. The pitting depth was measured and it was found that under deoxygenated seawater environment, the maximum pit depth from the steel <b>specimens</b> <b>covered</b> with deposits is greater than those without deposits. The variability in maximum pit depth changes with increased period of exposure in different test environments. Extreme value statistics were applied to analyse the maximum pit depth. The results show that Gumbel extreme value function are not appropriate for describing the variability of maximum pit depth for all the data from the environments covered with deposits for 180 and 365 days of exposure. For deeper pits, Frechet distribution is more appropriate to model the maximum pit depth. This has important practical implications for predicting long-term pitting governed by anaerobic conditions...|$|E

High resolution atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were periodically captured. The latter were used for measurements of the plastic strain field, using digital image correlation (DIC). Although no meso-scale localization bands appeared, some areas were deformed three times more than average. Plastic deformation inside the grains was more heterogeneous in Fe 22 Mn 0. 6 C, but at meso-scale, the degree of strain heterogeneity was not higher, at least up to 12 % strain. Plastic deformation started from grain boundaries or annealing twin boundaries in both materials, due to a high elastic anisotropy of the grains. An original method based on DIC was developed to estimate the twin fraction in grains that exhibit a single set of slip/twin bands. Deformation twinning accommodated 60 to 80 % of the plastic strain in some favourably oriented grains, from the onset of plastic flow in Fe 22 Mn 0. 6 C, but was not observed in the Al-bearing steel until 12 % strain.

AFM images were also repeatedly captured to monitor the evolution with strain of the out-of-plane component of GBS. Sharp gradients in sliding were observed along some grain boundaries, which proved that GBS should not be considered as a rigid-body motion. Grade 4 Ti was less prone to GBS than Grade 2, which was attributed to a pinning effect of βphase particles present along the grain boundaries. Contrary to what was reported for Zinc and Magnesium alloys, GBS was not found to contribute significantly to the global plastic strain in Titanium at room temperature. Crystal viscoplasticity finite element simulations based on real microstructure were run to compute the shear stress along the grain boundaries for various strain rates. The shear stress along the boundaries that slid was found to be substantially higher than the mean shear stress over all boundaries. However, a high shear stress was not sufficient to trigger GBS, also influenced by other factors. A change in strain rate not only modified the mean shear stress on all grain boundaries, but also the relative values of the shear stress on the grain boundaries, which was attributed to the strain-rate dependence of slip activities in each grain...|$|E

The pitting current density, i (p), increased with time after an incubation time, t (i). The double logarithmic plot of i (p) and polarization time, t, reveal two straight lines, which are separated at the time, tau.

Both the t (i) and tau increase with the thickness of the anodic films, and at the similar film thickness, they are much larger for the anodic films formed in the phosphate electrolyte than for those in the borate electrolyte.
