40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Biological & Agricultural EngineeringDonghai WangLignocellulosic biomass such as {{agricultural}} residues {{tends to}} be a sustainable feedstock for production of biofuels and biobased products in the long term due to its high availability and relative low cost. However, conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to biofuels faces significant technical challenges. One of the major challenges is biomass logistics. The agricultural residues are often harvested during a limited harvest season and stored as bales with low bulk density, making them difficult to handle, transport, store, and use in their natural forms. Densification of biomass by pelleting process could significantly improve the bulk density of biomass and thus improve handling efficiency and reduce transportation and handing costs. The main focus of this research was to better understand the impacts of pelleting process as well as pelleting conditions on physical properties, chemical compositions, biomass structure, and fermentable sugar yield of sorghum stalk, corn stover, wheat straw, and big bluestem. Results showed that pelleting process can increase biomass density up to 9 - 12 folds. Pelleting condition such as hammer <b>mill</b> <b>screen</b> size and ring-die pelleting mill die thickness had significant effects on bulk density, true density, and durability of biomass pellets. Although the pelleting process did not show significant effects on chemical composition of biomass before dilute-acid pretreatment process, glucan content of biomass pellets increased with the increase in ring-die pelleting mill die thickness and decreased with the increase in <b>mill</b> <b>screen</b> size after dilute-acid pretreatment. Opposite trend was observed for xylan content of biomass pellets as affected by pelleting conditions after dilute-acid pretreatment process. Biomass crystallinity increased after pelleting process, but not in a significant level. Softened surface region of biomass was removed after pelleting process, making the biomass more amendable to enzymatic attack. In this study, the optimum pelleting conditions were to grind the biomass feed using a 6. 5 -mm <b>mill</b> <b>screen</b> and to pellet biomass using a 44. 5 -mm ring-die pelleting mill die thickness. Under this optimum pelleting condition, the enzymatic conversion of cellulose of wheat straw pellets was the highest (94. 1 %), followed by corn stover pellet (93. 1 %), sorghum stalk pellet (92. 1 %), and big bluestem pellet (91. 1 %) ...|$|R

The weight percent gain (WPG) of the chemically modified wood was calculated based on the yield after washing with deionized water. The effects of amounts of AA and catalyst added, pulverization time, and saponification of the acetylated wood on WPG were examined. In addition, FT-IR analysis, and water vapor adsorption and desorption tests were performed as functions of the WPG. Increases in WPG, the acetyl contents of the acetylated wood after saponification, changes in the FT-IR spectra after pulverization, and the water vapor sorption isotherms showed that the one-step acetylation systematically modified the hydroxyl groups of the wood into acetyl groups. Up to 38  % WPG was obtained at 100  phr AA and 15  phr catalyst, and 120  min pulverization. Pulverization time and the amounts of AA and catalyst added to the wood meals could be adjusted to obtain acetylated wood meal with the desired WPG. These demonstrated that the mechanochemical acetylation is a method to prepare acetylated wood meals with high WPG at less reaction time and required AA addition.|$|R

This is a result of growing challenges associated with the increasing energy cost, scarcity of water resources and stricter environmental legislation. Dry comminution technologies, such as High Pressure Grinding Rolls (HPGR) and Vertical Roller Mills (VRM), have been successfully used in other industries such as cement and coal for decades, and the literature claims that these technologies are more energy efficient than conventional comminution practices. Pilot scale testing was conducted for each of these technologies using rock with properties similar to many mineral ores to test the claims in the literature and evaluate the applicability for hard rock mining operations. Whilst the test results for the HPGR and VRM are not directly comparable (due to different degree of size reduction), both demonstrated the potential for considerable energy savings compared to conventional ball milling. The HPGR and air classification circuit used 20 - 30 % less energy than the HGPR, <b>screen,</b> ball <b>mill</b> circuit.

40|$|The {{two main}} sources of biomass for energy {{generation}} are purpose-grown energy crops and waste materials. Energy crops, such as Miscanthus and short rotation woody crops (coppice), are cultivated mainly for energy purposes and {{are associated with the}} food vs. fuels debate, which is concerned with whether land should be used for fuel rather than food production. The use of residues from agriculture, such as barley, canola, oat and wheat straw, for energy generation circumvents the food vs. fuel dilemma and adds value to existing crops. In fact, these residues represent an abundant, inexpensive and readily available source of renewable lignocellulosic biomass. In order to reduce industry’s operational cost as well as to meet the requirement of raw material for biofuel production, biomass must be processed and handled in an efficient manner. Due to its high moisture content, irregular shape and size, and low bulk density, biomass is very difficult to handle, transport, store, and utilize in its original form. Densification of biomass into durable compacts is an effective solution to these problems and it can reduce material waste. Upon densification, many agricultural biomass materials, especially those from straw and stover, result in a poorly formed pellets or compacts that are more often dusty, difficult to handle and costly to manufacture. This is caused by lack of complete understanding on the natural binding characteristics of the components that make up biomass. An integrated approach to postharvest processing (chopping, grinding and steam explosion), and feasibility study on lab-scale and pilot scale densification of non-treated and steam exploded barley, canola, oat and wheat straw was successfully established to develop baseline data and correlations, that assisted in performing overall specific energy analysis. A new procedure was developed to rapidly characterize the lignocellulosic composition of agricultural biomass using the Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. In addition, baseline knowledge was created to determine the physical and frictional properties of non-treated and steam exploded agricultural biomass grinds. Particle size reduction of agricultural biomass was performed to increase the total surface area, pore size of the material and the number of contact points for inter-particle bonding in the compaction process. Predictive regression equations having higher R 2 values were developed that could be used by biorefineries to perform economic feasibility of establishing a processing plant. Specific energy required by a hammer mill to grind non-treated and steam exploded barley, canola, oat and wheat straw showed a negative power correlation with hammer <b>mill</b> <b>screen</b> sizes. Rapid and cost effective quantification of lignocellulosic components (cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin) of agricultural biomass (barley, canola, oat and wheat) is essential to determine the effect of various pre-treatments (such as steam explosion) on biomass used as feedstock for the biofuel industry. A novel procedure to quantitatively predict lignocellulosic components of non-treated and steam exploded barley, canola, oat and wheat straw was developed using Fourier Transformed Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Regression equations having R 2 values of 0. 89, 0. 99 and 0. 98 were developed to predict the cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin compounds of biomass, respectively. The average absolute difference in predicted and measured cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin in agricultural biomass was 7. 5 %, 2. 5 %, and 3. 8 %, respectively. Application of steam explosion pre-treatment on agricultural straw significantly altered the physical and frictional properties, which has direct significance on designing new and modifying existing bins, hoppers and feeders for handling and storage of straw for biofuel industry. As a result, regression equations were developed to enhance process efficiency by eliminating the need for experimental procedure while designing and manufacturing of new handling equipment. Compaction of low bulk density agricultural biomass is a critical and desirable operation for sustainable and economic availability of feedstock for the biofuel industry. A comprehensive study of the compression characteristics (density of pellet and total specific energy required for compression) of ground non-treated and steam exploded barley, canola, oat and wheat straw obtained from three hammer <b>mill</b> <b>screen</b> sizes of 6. 4, 3. 2 and 1. 6 mm at 10 % moisture content (wb) was conducted. Four preset pressures of 31. 6, 63. 2, 94. 7 and 138. 9 MPa, were applied using an Instron testing machine to compress samples in a cylindrical die. It was determined that the applied pressure (60. 4 %) was the most significant factor affecting pellet density followed by the application of steam explosion pre-treatment (39. 4 %). Similarly, the type of biomass (47. 1 %) is the most significant factor affecting durability followed by the application of pre-treatment (38. 2 %) and grind size (14. 6 %). Also, the applied pressure (58. 3 %) was the most significant factor affecting specific energy required to manufacture pellets followed by the biomass (15. 3 %), pre-treatment (13. 3 %) and grind size (13. 2 %), which had lower but similar effect affect on specific energy. In addition, correlations for pellet density and specific energy with applied pressure and hammer <b>mill</b> <b>screen</b> sizes having highest R 2 values were developed. Higher grind sizes and lower applied pressures resulted in higher relaxations (lower pellet densities) during storage of pellets. Three compression models, namely: Jones model, Cooper-Eaton model, and Kawakita-Ludde model were considered to determine the pressure-volume and pressure-density relationship of non-treated and steam exploded straws. Kawakita-Ludde model provided the best fit to the experimental data having R 2 values of 0. 99 for non-treated straw and 1. 00 for steam exploded biomass samples. The steam exploded straw had higher porosity than non-treated straw. In addition, the steam exploded straw was easier to compress since it had lower yield strength or failure stress values compared to non-treated straw. Pilot scale pelleting experiments were performed on non-treated, steam exploded and customized (adding steam exploded straw grinds in increments of 25 % to non-treated straw) barley, canola, oat and wheat straw grinds obtained from 6. 4, 3. 2, 1. 6 and 0. 8 mm hammer <b>mill</b> <b>screen</b> sizes at 10 % moisture content (wb). The pilot scale pellet mill produced pellets from ground non-treated straw at hammer <b>mill</b> <b>screen</b> sizes of 0. 8 and 1. 6 mm and customized samples having 25 % steam exploded straw at 0. 8 mm. It was observed that the pellet bulk density and particle density are positively correlated. The density and durability of agricultural straw pellets significantly increased with a decrease in hammer <b>mill</b> <b>screen</b> size from 1. 6 mm to 0. 8 mm. Interestingly, customization of agricultural straw by adding 25 % of steam exploded straw by weight resulted in higher durability (> 80 %) pellets but did not improve durability compared to non-treated straw pellets. In addition, durability of pellets was negatively correlated to pellet mill throughput and was positively correlated to specific energy consumption. Total specific energy required to form pellets increased with a decrease in hammer <b>mill</b> <b>screen</b> size from 1. 6 to 0. 8 mm and also the total specific energy significantly increased with customization of straw at 0. 8 mm screen size. It has been determined that the net specific energy available for production of biofuel is a significant portion of original agricultural biomass energy (89 - 94 %) for all agricultural biomass...|$|R

5000|$|The {{full-scale}} IsaMills allowed MIM {{to refine}} the mill design to allow improved ease of maintenance. For example, the shell design was changed {{to allow it to}} split along the horizontal center-line (see Figure 5). This was done to allow the use of a replaceable slip-in liner, avoiding the need for the shell to be sent away for cold rubber lining and the need to have a stock of spare, lined shells. Also, the direction of flow of feed through the mill was reversed, because most of the disk wear occurred at the feed end, which was initially at the drive end of the mill. By changing the feed end to that opposite the drive end, the disks that required most frequent replacement were the first that were removed from the shaft rather than the last (see Figure 6 and Figure 7).

The protocol consisted of <b>screening</b> the laboratory <b>mill</b> content after each grinding run to remove undersize, which is then replenished with an equal mass of new clinker until CL becomes constant.

Conversely, the locked-cycled protocol led to narrower PSD, with n varying from 1. 025 to 1. 175. Cement ground using the lockedcycle protocol was found to require increased water demand as compared to that ground for afixed time interval. Also, this protocol was found to generate a reducedfraction of particles finer than 1 μ/m, which led to relatively delayed setting times and reduced 1 -day compressive strength.

In order to investigate the grinding behaviour and the interaction of multicomponent materials in a mill, a new semi-autogenous locked-cycle test was developed. The investigation {{was carried out in}} a 600 mm diameter laboratory mill, using quartz and BIF (banded iron formation) ore, tested as pure components and in binary mixtures. When the equilibrium is reached, the test simulates a steady-state continuous operation, where the closing <b>screen</b> represents the <b>mill</b> grate classification. The experiment typically reaches equilibrium after a few 20 -min cycles, when the mill product and recycle composition become stable and the total amount of each component in the product and feed equalise. At the end of each test a full sizing and composition analysis of the mill product and load was performed, using magnetic separation to quantify the proportion of BIF in each size fraction. The mill load and comminution behaviour was found to be controlled by the hard component, as expected, but in a highly non-linear manner. The other key finding was the marked differences in the product size distributions for each component when they were ground alone and in mixtures. The important behaviours and trends are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} study effects of grinding and pelleting on feed structure using either wheat or maize as a base ingredients. In experiment 1, four diets were formulated to contain either completely ground base ingredients using 3 mm and 6 mm screen size in hammer mill or base ingredients were added as whole grain in ration of 30 % whole grain 70 % ground material. In addition base ingredients were mixed with mineral and vitamin premix to make complete diets. Smaller particles improved pellet durability but replacement of ground ingredients with whole ingredinets increased hardness. Coarse structure of the diets reduced energy consumption when compared with fine structured diets. In experiment 2, pure wheat and barley were used as ingredients and were ground using either hammer mill fitted with 3 mm sieve or roller mill using 1. 5 mm gap between rolls. In addition, {{a combination of the}} hammer mill fitted with 3 mm <b>screen</b> and roller <b>mill</b> with the 1. 5 mm gap between rolls as a singular method was tested. Higher pellet durability and lower energy consumption was observed for wheat diets when compared to maize diets. Combination of the hammer mill + roller mill showed higher pellet durability for both cereal sources when compared with either hammer mill or roller mill alone. Larger proportion of the particles smaller than 1. 0 mm were found when diets were ground on a hammer mill fitted with 3 mm screen in comparison to hammer mill fitted with 6 mm screen (experiment 1) or roller mill with 1. 5 mm roller gap (experiment 2). Roller mill had larger proportion of the particles over 1. 6 mm in comparison to either combination of the hammer mill and roller mill or hammer mill alone (experiment 2) ...|$|R
