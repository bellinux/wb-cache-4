40|$|Drepanolejeunea pleiodictya Herzog (Lejeuneaceae), a {{rare and}} poorly known species from Java and Malaysia, was newly {{discovered}} in tropical montane forest in southern Thailand. It is distinguished by the ventral margin of the leaf lobe being usually irregularly dentate with one large tooth, {{the apex of the}} lobule having a <b>straight</b> or slightly <b>curved</b> <b>tooth,</b> ocelli 3 − 4 (− 5) seriate in the leaf lobe separated by 2 − 5 ordinary leaf cells, and gynoecia usually with a single pycnolejeuneoid innovation. This species is described and illustrated in detail, and its diagnostic characters and geographical distribution are briefly discussed...|$|R

5000|$|Sinraptor dongi skull {{specimen}} IVPP 10600 exhibits [...] "a {{variety of}} gently <b>curving</b> <b>tooth</b> drags or gouges, shallow, circular punctures and one fully penetrating lesion." [...] One rib was broken and healed via telescoping of its capitular shaft.|$|R
5000|$|Family Limnoscelidae {{contained}} large carnivores or piscivores. The largest genus, Limnoscelis {{could grow}} {{to at least}} 1,5 meters.

50|$|In most nautiloids and ammonoids, the phragmocone is a long, <b>straight,</b> <b>curved,</b> or coiled structure, {{in which}} the camarae are linked by a siphuncle which determines {{buoyancy}} by means of gas exchange.|$|R

40|$|Here {{we report}} on a large brachyuran crab species from the Late Cretaceous of Mexico that has claws {{indicative}} of highly specialized shell-breaking behaviour. This crab possessed dimorphic claws (the right larger than the left), armed with several broad <b>teeth,</b> including a <b>curved</b> <b>tooth</b> structure found {{at the base of}} the movable finger of the right claw. The <b>curved</b> <b>tooth</b> is similar to the one observed on claws of many living durophagous crabs that use it as a weapon to peel, crush or chip the edges of hard-shelled prey, particularly molluscs. These morphological traits suggest that specialized shell-breaking crab predators had evolved during the Cretaceous, which contradicts previous findings supporting an Early Cenozoic origin for specialized shell crushers within the brachyuran clade...|$|R

5000|$|Cane {{railways}} {{often had}} permanent tracks {{for the main}} lines, with portable tracks serving the canefields themselves. These tracks were narrow gauge (for example, [...] ) and the portable track came in <b>straights,</b> <b>curves,</b> and turnouts, rather like on a model railway.|$|R
5000|$|Geosaurus was a large, marine reptile of {{the group}} Crurotarsi, the line leading to modern crocodilians. Specifically, it was a [...] "marine crocodile", or thalattosuchian. Geosaurus was similar in {{appearance}} to the related Dakosaurus with a relatively short skull and <b>curved</b> <b>teeth</b> designed for slashing, which it likely used to attack large prey.|$|R
50|$|The M1 is {{the only}} UK {{motorway}} to use transition curves (spirals) to connect <b>straights</b> to <b>curves</b> (circles) as is usual with railways.

5000|$|Mosasaur {{teeth are}} of rather uniform {{morphology}} with a pointed and <b>curved</b> <b>tooth</b> crown {{that sits on}} a pedicel composed of bone. The enamel surface is smooth and the crown is subdivided into a lingual and labial surface while the outer surface of the crown is made of enamel and the inner layer is made of dentine.|$|R
5000|$|This {{species was}} first {{formally}} described in 1988 as Melaleuca calycina subsp. dempta [...] Barlow by B.A.Barow and K.J. Cowley. It {{was raised to}} species status in 1999 by Lyndley Craven. The specific epithet (dempta) is a Latin word meaning [...] "removed" [...] or [...] "taken away" [...] referring {{to the lack of}} long, <b>curved</b> <b>teeth</b> around the fruit.|$|R
50|$|Nautiloids {{remained}} {{at the height of}} their range of adaptations and variety of forms throughout the Ordovician, Silurian, and Devonian periods, with various <b>straight,</b> <b>curved</b> and coiled shell forms coexisting at the same time.

'Crispa' is a slow-growing {{tree with}} {{pendulous}} branches bearing narrow, linear to oblanceolate leaves up to 9 cm long by 3.5 cm broad, distinctively wrinkled and with numerous incised <b>curved</b> <b>teeth.</b> Hanham (1857), concurring with Loudon (1838), {{described it as}} [...] "generally of a slender and stunted habit of growth", and Henry (1913) as a small tree; mature specimens in Sweden, however, have attained a height comparable to the type.|$|R

Assyrian dances would vary from weak to strong, depending on the mood and tempo of a song.|$|R
