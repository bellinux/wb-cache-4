Within many nations' meteorological organizations, this data is then plotted onto a weather map using the station model.

5|$|Doppler {{redshift}} vs cosmological red-shift: Astronomersoften {{refer to}} the cosmological red-shift as a normal Doppler shift,which is a misconception. Although similar, the cosmological red-shift is not identical to the Doppler redshift. The Doppler redshift is based on special relativity, which does not consider the expansion of <b>space.</b> <b>On</b> the contrary, the cosmological red-shift is based on general relativity, in which the expansion of space is considered. Although they may appear identical for nearby galaxies, it may cause confusion if the behavior of distant galaxies is understood through the Doppler redshift.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three papers, all {{of them on the}} topic of function <b>spaces</b> <b>on</b> fractals. The papers summarised in this thesis are: Paper I Mats Bodin, Wavelets and function <b>spaces</b> <b>on</b> Mauldin-Williams fractals, Research Report in Mathematics No. 7, Umeå University, 2005. Paper II Mats Bodin, Harmonic functions and Lipschitz <b>spaces</b> <b>on</b> the Sierpinski gasket, Research Report in Mathematics No. 8, Umeå University, 2005. Paper III Mats Bodin, A discrete characterisation of Lipschitz <b>spaces</b> <b>on</b> fractals, Manuscript. The first paper deals with piecewise continuous wavelets of higher order in Besov <b>spaces</b> defined <b>on</b> fractals. A. Jonsson has constructed wavelets of higher order on fractals, and characterises Besov <b>spaces</b> <b>on</b> totally disconnected self-similar sets, by means of the magnitude of the coefficients in the wavelet expansion of the function. For a class of fractals, W. Jin shows that such wavelets can be constructed by recursively calculating moments. We extend their results to a class of graph directed self-similar fractals, introduced by R. D. Mauldin and S. C. Williams. In the second paper we compare differently defined function <b>spaces</b> <b>on</b> the Sierpinski gasket. R. S. Strichartz proposes a discrete definition of Besov spaces of continuous functions on self-similar fractals having a regular harmonic structure. We identify some of them with Lipschitz spaces introduced by A. Jonsson, when the underlying domain is the Sierpinski gasket. We also characterise some of these spaces by means of the magnitude of the coefficients of the expansion of a function in a continuous piecewise harmonic base. The last paper gives a discrete characterisation of certain Lipschitz <b>spaces</b> <b>on</b> a class of fractal sets. A. Kamont has discretely characterised Besov <b>spaces</b> <b>on</b> intervals. We give a discrete characterisation of Lipschitz <b>spaces</b> <b>on</b> fractals admitting a type of regular sequence of triangulations, and for a class of post critically finite self-similar sets. This shows that, on some fractals, certain discretely defined Besov spaces, introduced by R. Strichartz, coincide with Lipschitz spaces introduced by A. Jonsson and H. Wallin for low order of smoothness...|$|R
