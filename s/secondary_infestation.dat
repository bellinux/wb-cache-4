50|$|Pollenia rudis is most {{commonly}} {{known for being}} a household nuisance. The first reports of cluster flies as pests in homes occurred {{as early as the}} nineteenth century, and these flies continue to cause problems today. Cluster flies tend to enter homes and buildings in large masses in late summer or early autumn to seek shelter for the winter months. They possess the ability to squeeze their bodies through any exterior crevices of a home, such as cracks around windows and doors, air conditioning vents, screening vents, and loosely hung siding. Once cluster flies enter a home, they usually hibernate in inaccessible areas between walls and in ceilings until spring when they emerge and seek access to the outdoors. P. rudis is extremely troublesome to home and business owners, but does not cause any true damage to home structures, textiles, foods, or humans. Piles of dead flies left in the walls can sometimes lead to <b>secondary</b> <b>infestations</b> of carpet or larder beetles and rodents.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Ixodes scapularis ticks are hematophagous {{arthropods}} {{capable of}} transmitting many infectious agents to humans. The process of blood feeding is an extended and continuous interplay between tick and host responses. While {{this process has}} been studied extensively in vitro, no global understanding of the host response to ticks has emerged. Methods To address this issue, we used PCR-arrays to measure skin-specific expression of 233 discrete genes at 8 time points during primary and secondary infestations of mice with pathogen-free I. scapularis nymphs. Selected results were then validated at the mRNA and protein levels by additional real-time PCR and bioplex assay. Results Primary infestation was characterized by the late induction of an innate immune response. Lectin pattern recognition receptors, cytokines, and chemokines were upregulated consistent with increased neutrophil and macrophage migration. Gene ontology and pathway analyses of downregulated genes suggested inhibition of gene transcription and Th 17 immunity. During the <b>secondary</b> <b>infestation,</b> additional genes were modulated suggesting a broader involvement of immune cells including CD 8 and CD 4 positive T lymphocytes. The cytokine response showed a mixed Th 1 /Th 2 profile with a potential for T regulatory cell activity. Key gene ontology clusters observed during the <b>secondary</b> <b>infestation</b> were cell migration and activation. Matrix metalloproteinases were upregulated, apoptosis-related genes were differentially modulated, and immunoreceptor signaling molecules were upregulated. In contrast, transcripts related to mitogenic, WNT, Hedgehog, and stress pathways were downregulated. Conclusions Our results support a model of tick feeding where lectin pattern recognition receptors orchestrate an innate inflammatory response during primary infestation that primes a mixed Th 1 /Th 2 response upon secondary exposure. Tick feeding inhibits gene transcription and Th 17 immunity. Salivary molecules may also inhibit upregulation of mitogenic, WNT, Hedgehog, and stress pathways and enhance the activity of T regulatory cells, production of IL- 10, and suppressors of cytokine signaling molecules (SOCS). This study provides the first comprehensive transcriptional analysis of the murine host response at the I. scapularis bite site and suggests both a potential model of the host cutaneous response and candidate genes for further description and investigation. </p...|$|E
30|$|Out of the 11 R-genes (against AGM) {{known in}} rice, {{resistance}} associated with Gm 1 and Gm 8 is without invoking HR while resistance {{associated with the}} remaining 9 R-genes is manifested with HR (Bentur et al. 2011). Though resistance against gall midge is predominantly manifested with HR and results in maggot mortality, HR is not the prerequisite for maggot mortality (Bentur and Kalode 1996). In a pioneering study (Bentur and Kalode 1996), it was shown that an HR+ indica rice variety, Phalguna (harboring Gm 2), was able to resist a <b>secondary</b> <b>infestation</b> by virulent larva but without the expression of HR following its incompatible interaction with gall midge biotype 1 (GMB 1). The current study is based on another HR+ indica rice variety RP 2068 - 18 - 3 - 5 (referred to as RP henceforth) that shows HR upon attack by gall midge biotype 1 (GMB 1). RP harbors gm 3 which confers resistance, manifested with HR, against {{five of the seven}} GMBs found in India. Mapped to chromosome 4 of rice, gm 3 is the only recessive R-gene identified against gall midge thus far and efforts are underway to clone, characterize and functionally validate this gene (Sama et al. 2014). Thus, the resistance shown by RP against GMB 1 is a complex trait which involves expression of HR, inability of the maggots to survive on the resistant host and association with a recessive resistance gene. The interaction between RP and GMB 1 has never been studied before and therefore, evaluating the molecular and biochemical changes occurring in the host upon GMB 1 attack will help us gain insights into the mechanism of resistance conferred by gm 3.|$|E

Histological analysis supported the microarray findings. At 12 hpi, a mild inflammatory infiltrate was present in the dermis, especially concentrated at the junction between dermal connective tissue and underlying adipose tissue. A small lesion was located immediately under the hypostome and likely represents the feeding pool. Surprisingly, at 48 hpi, the number of inflammatory cells had not increased from 12 hpi, perhaps mirroring the reduction in gene expression seen at this time point. The feeding lesion is very well defined, and extravasated erythrocytes are readily evident around the hypostome. By 96 hpi, the inflammatory infiltrate has increased dramatically and the feeding lesion appears to have moved deeper into the dermis. At 120 hpi, most of the changes at 96 hpi are intensified. The infiltrate is very dense, the epidermis is markedly thickened, the feeding lesion is poorly defined and the dermal tissue near the hypostome appears to be loosing its normal architecture.

Root chicory (Cichorium intybus L.) var. sativum (Bisch.) Janch. cv. Polanowicka was involved in the experiment. The experimental factors were 3 species of intercrop plants: common vetch (Vicia sativa), phacelia (Phacelia tanacetifolia), oat (Avena sativa) and 2 dates of ploughing-in: pre-winter and spring. In total, 26 taxons characteristic for vegetable plantations were identified in chicory weed infestation. Monocarpic species dominated, among which Senecio vulgaris, Chenopodium album, Lamium amplexicaule, Galinsoga ciliata, and Capsella bursa-pastoris were predominant. The date of ploughing-in did not significantly affect the status and size of weed infestation of chicory plots. Short-lived species occurred after pre-winter ploughing-in, while perennial - after spring ploughing-in. The application of intercrops significantly reduced chicory weed infestation as compared to the cultivation with no intercrop.

40|$|This paper briefly reviews {{information}} on settlement and recruitment of Acanthaster planci in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) system, {{with emphasis on}} the recent phenomenon of population outbreaks of the starfish. Observations that recent outbreaks have occurred in two series of activity (1962 - 77 and 1979 - 91 +), each characterized by a southward wave of infestations in the central section of the GBR, and that outbreaks are not preceded by observable increases in densities of juveniles, {{have important implications for}} settlement and recruitment processes. The pattern of outbreaks indicates that primary outbreaks occur infrequently and unpredictably in the vicinity of 16 degrees S. However, {{it is not possible to}} assert that primary outbreaks have not occurred elsewhere in the GBR system, and isolated outbreaks at the southern end of the GBR may be primary events. Present data are insufficient to discern whether recruitment leading to primary outbreaks is by mass settlement of larvae or aggregation of adult starfish of various ages. In contrast, evidence indicates strongly that the majority of outbreaks in the system are <b>secondary</b> <b>infestations</b> as a result of water-borne transport and subsequent mass settlements of planktonic larvae seeded by other outbreak populations (and initially by populations undergoing primary outbreaks). The likelihood and pattern of secondary outbreaks is influenced by several parameters that operate at vastly different scales. These include passive transport of larvae by large-scale circulation patterns at scales of 10 to the power of 4 - 10 to the power of 6 m, which can largely account for the southward wave, and substratum selectivity by larvae at small scales (0 - 10 to the power of - 3 m). The spatial distribution of important cues for larval settlement (coral rubble and the coralline alga Lithothamnium pseudosorum) suggests that mass settlements are more likely to occur in deep water at the base of reefs, where they are less likely to be observed. Several foci are defined for future research on settlement and recruitment processes. These include (1) identification of parameters influencing the spatial and temporal distribution of recruitment events that initiate primary outbreaks, (2) testing of hypotheses relating to dissipation of the southward movement of outbreaks at about 20 degrees S despite an abundance of reefs in the area supporting high coral cover, (3) determining the period of competency of larvae for settlement, (4) elucidating the behaviour of larvae (particularly late brachiolaria) in the water column, (5) further work to identify substrata inductive of larval settlement and to determine the nature of inducers, the spatial distribution of inductive substrata, and the effect of small-scale hydrodynamic processes in modifying the response of larvae to inductive substrata, and (6) testing of the hypothesis of deep-water recruitment...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Weed {{control in}} the {{cultivation}} of cotton {{is critical to the}} yield and quality of production. The influence of economically important weeds was studied. Chemical control is the most effective method of weed control in cotton but much of the information on it relates to primary weed infestation. Problems with primary weed infestation in cotton have been solved to a significant extent. The question of <b>secondary</b> weed <b>infestation</b> with annual and perennial graminaceous weeds during the period of cotton vegetation is also determined largely by the use of antigraminaceous herbicides. The data related to herbicides to effectively control secondary germinated broadleaf weeds in conventional technology for cotton growing are quite scarce, even globally. We are still seeking effective herbicides for control of these weeds in cotton crops. Studies on their influence on the sowing characteristics of cotton seed and the quality of cotton fiber are still insufficient. In the scientific literature there is not enough information on these questions. The combinations of herbicides, as well as their tank mixtures with fertilizers or plant growth regulators are more efficient than autonomous application. Often during their combined application higher synergistic effect on yield is produced. There is information about cotton cultivars resistant to glyphosate. These cultivars are GMO and they are banned within the European Union, including Bulgaria...|$|R

We studied beech forests in the southwestern European Alps, which burned between 1970 and 2012. The results show that beech trees, which lack fire-resistance traits, experience increased mortality within the first two decades post-fire with a timing and amount strongly related to the burn severity. Beech mortality is fast and ubiquitous in high severity sites, whereas small- (DBH < 12 cm) and intermediate-diameter (DBH 12 – 36 cm) trees face a higher risk to die in moderate-severity sites. Large-diameter trees mostly survive, representing a crucial ecological legacy for beech regeneration. Mortality remains low and at a level similar to unburnt beech forests for low burn severity sites. Beech trees diameter, the presence of fungal infestation and elevation are the most significant drivers of mortality. The risk of beech to die increases toward higher elevation and is higher for small-diameter than for large-diameter trees. In case of <b>secondary</b> fungi <b>infestation</b> beech faces generally a higher risk to die. Interestingly, fungi that initiate post-fire tree mortality differ from fungi occurring after mechanical injury. From a management point of view, the insights about the controls of post-fire mortality provided by this study should help in planning post-fire silvicultural measures in montane beech forests...|$|R
40|$|Reactive {{arthritis}} is {{an inflammatory}} joint disease that develops after an infection and it usually occurs following a gastrointestinal or genitourinary system infection and {{it belongs to}} the family of arthritis called “spondyloarthritis. ” We wanted to represent a rare case of reactive arthritis <b>secondary</b> to Echinococcus <b>infestation.</b> Cyst hydatid disease is common in endemic regions like Turkey. Internal organ involvements, especially liver and lung, are most frequent involvements. Primary bone involvement is rare complication of Echinococcus infestation. In our case, the patient with Echinococcus infection developed right knee arthritis and sacroiliitis. Other reactive and oligoarthritis causes were excluded and diagnosis of reactive arthritis secondary to cyst hydatid infestation was done with the present findings. Cold pack and TENS treatment were applied as symptomatic treatment to the right knee of the patient. Acemetacin was given as medical treatment. On the 5 th day of treatment, right knee and ankle arthritis were clinically regressed. In regions where the disease is seen as endemic, such as Turkey, patients with musculoskeletal symptoms should consider the possibility of musculoskeletal involvement due to the hydatid cyst...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{onset of}} biotic {{stress in the}} host plants {{as a result of}} {{increased}} insect population size leads to enhanced levels of secondary metabolites and associated phenolic enzyme activity · Of the three host plants examined, viz. Ricinus communis (castor), Eucalyptus globulus (eucalyptus) and Manihot utilissima (tapioca), castor was the host most preferred by Retithrips syriacus · Despite the fact that tapioca had the highest levels of <b>secondary</b> compounds, thrips <b>infestation</b> persisted · However, fecundity and growth were reduced because of the relatively high levels of primary metabolites. Gallic acid was found to be the most toxic of the phenolic acids, followed by pyrogallol, resorcinol, phloroglucinol and vanillic acid · The less toxic phenolic acids and flavanoids were detected in leaves that harboured thrips, while the preponderance of gallic acid was found in uninfested hosts. Thus the interaction of Retithrips syriacus with the hosts is governed essentially by the biochemical profiles of its hosts, which tend to be altered subsequent to infestation, thus manifesting induced resistance through enhanced production of phenolic...|$|R
40|$|Tick-borne {{diseases}} {{are a significant}} and growing problem. A great body of {{research has focused on}} the immunological relationship that ticks have with their vertebrate hosts. It is hoped that knowledge gleaned from these studies will elucidate how tick-borne {{diseases are}} transmitted, and also lead to novel methods for prevention. For example, the acquired immune response to ticks seen in guinea pigs—a phenomenon quite similar to the response seen in some human patients—leads to rapid recognition and rejection of attached ticks and protection from the diseases they vector. Perhaps deeper understanding of this immune response will lend insight into avenues of disease prevention. ^ The primary goal {{of this study was to}} determine the effect that prior tick-bite sensitization has on guinea pig immune responses to tick feeding. Specifically, I explored guinea pig splenocyte secretion of CXCL 8 in response to tick salivary gland homogenate (SGH). ^ A secondary goal was to determine whether splenocyte secretion of CXCL 8 in response to the mitogen concanavalin A was altered by previous tick exposure. Additionally, recent work (Narasimhan et al., 2007) suggests that salivary proteins secreted in the first 24 hours of tick feeding, and not those differentially secreted later in feeding, are critical in the development of acquired tick immunity. Another secondary goal of this study was to investigate whether guinea pigs exposed to only the first 24 hours of tick feeding had different immune responses than guinea pigs exposed to full tick feeding cycles. ^ Fifteen guinea pigs were separated into three treatment groups: (1) Naïve control; (2) 24 hour tick-exposed (fed upon by ticks for 24 hours, after which any attached ticks were manually removed); and (3) replete tick-exposed (fed upon by ticks until the ticks fed to repletion or otherwise detached). Splenocytes from these guinea pigs were cultured with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (negative control), SGH, and ConA for 18 and 24 hours. Concentration of CXCL 8 in supernatant of these cell cultures was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA). ^ It was found that naïve guinea pig splenocytes have a significant increase in CXCL 8 secretion in response to SGH stimulation over their baseline response to PBS stimulation at 18 hours of culture. By 24 hours of cell culture, all three guinea pig groups have a significant response to SGH over their baseline PBS response. ^ There was no significant difference between the guinea pig groups in the concentration of CXCL 8 in splenocyte cell cultures in response to PBS at 24 hours, nor in response to SGH at either 18 or 24 hours of culture. Moreover, the change seen in individual guinea pigs 2 ̆ 7 responses at 24 hours of culture to SGH over their baseline PBS response—whether expressed as the difference or as the fold change of these two CXCL 8 concentrations—was not significantly different between the three guinea pig groups. Splenocyte secretion of CXCL 8 appears, therefore, to be independent of a guinea pig 2 ̆ 7 s prior exposure to tick bites. ^ There also was no significant difference between the three guinea pig groups in their response to ConA, at either 18 or 24 hours of cell culture. This response, too, appears to be independent of prior tick exposure. ^ Tick infestation data from the 24 hour and replete tick-exposed groups suggests that the treatments do not lead to identical development of acquired tick immunity. Replete tick-exposed guinea pigs were better able to reject ticks by 24 hours of feeding in <b>secondary</b> <b>infestations</b> than were 24 hour tick-exposed guinea pigs. Tick salivary components secreted later in feeding may, therefore, play important roles in the development of tick immunity. ...|$|R
40|$|Single plant {{selection}} in F 2 progeny was effective when {{the performance of}} the selected F 2 single plant families were compared with the respective bulk progenies. The mean first infestation scores for aphids of all the families were significantly lower than the respective bulk progenies. Selected single plant progenies also recorded higher mean values for important traits related to aphid infestation. Seed yield per plant showed significantly positive genotypic correlation with height up to first branch, number of siliqua on branches, total number of siliqua per plant and 100 seed weight. First infestation score for aphids showed significantly negative correlations with length of main raceme, number of primary and <b>secondary</b> branches. Second <b>infestation</b> score showed significantly negative correlation with length of main raceme and number of primary branches but showed significantly positive correlation with first aphid infestation score. The result suggested that lines with higher aphid resistance and higher seed yield could be selected from the progenies, if selection is practiced for shorter plant height, more number of primary branches, higher number of seeds per siliqua and 100 seed weight along with lower infestation scores...|$|R
