25|$|Since the {{takeover}} in 2011, NEEP Roma Holding S.p.A. has owned all shares Sensi previously hold. NEEP, itself a joint venture, {{was held by}} DiBenedetto AS Roma LLC (later renamed to AS Roma SPV, LLC) and Unicredit in 60–40 ratio from 2011 to 2013, which the former had four real person shareholders in equal ratio, led by future Roma president Thomas R. DiBenedetto (2011–12). The takeover also activated a mandatory bid of shares from the general public, however not all minority shareholders were willing to sell their shares. The mandatory bid meant NEEP held 78.038% of shares of AS Roma (increased from 67.1% of the Sensi). On 1 August 2013, the president of Roma {{as well as one}} of the four American shareholders of AS Roma SPV, LLC, James Pallotta, bought an additional 9% shares of NEEP Roma Holding from Unicredit (through Raptor Holdco LLC), as the bank was not willing to fully participate in the capital increase of NEEP from €120,000 to €160,008,905 (excluding <b>share</b> <b>premium).</b> On 4 April 2014 Starwood Capital Group also became the fifth shareholder of AS Roma SPV, as well as forming a strategic partnership with AS Roma SpA to develop real estate around the new stadium. The private investment firm was represented by Zsolt Kohalmi in AS Roma SPV, who was appointed on 4 April as a partner and head of European acquisitions of the firm. On 11 August 2014, UniCredit sold the remain shares on NEEP (of 31%) for €33million which meant AS Roma SPV LLC (91%) and Raptor Holdco LLC (9%) were the sole intermediate holding company of AS Roma SpA.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we explore}} actuarial {{justification}} for equal or unequal <b>sharing</b> of <b>premiums</b> and benefits between policyholders in a product involving joint lives. The analysis reveals {{a fundamental difference}} between endowment and assurance types of products in this regard. In assurance plans, {{there is a clear}} basis for differential structure in terms of <b>sharing</b> <b>premium</b> payment. In pure endowment plans, the default system of equal premium for equal benefit may be more justified although implications of other alternatives are also considered. A justification is derived for such an alternative through appropriate discount figures as compared to individual live policies. We also suggest an alternative actuarial principle to deal with joint endowment plans: solutions have been worked out under this framework. While lives are considered to be independent for a major part of this work, the implications of dependency have also been presented here with special reference to common shock model and copula models. ...|$|R

5000|$|The break-even {{stock price}} for Greg is $55 per share, i.e., the $50 per share {{for the call}} option price plus the $5 per <b>share</b> <b>premium</b> he paid for the option. If the stock reaches $55 per share when the option expires, Greg can recover his {{investment}} by exercising the option and buying 100 shares of ABC Corp stock from Terence at $50 per share, and then immediately selling those shares at the market price of $55. His total costs are then the $5 per <b>share</b> <b>premium</b> for the call option, plus $50 per share to buy the shares from Greg, {{for a total of}} $5,500. His total earnings are $55 per share sold, or $5,500 for 100 shares, yielding him a net $0. (Note that this {{does not take into account}} broker fees or other transaction costs.) Note, however, that the $5 per <b>share</b> <b>premium</b> is a sunk cost that he has already paid regardless of whether he chooses to exercise the call. Thus, while he breaks even at $55 per share, actually, he makes a $5 per share profit that covers the earlier expense of $5 per share. Thus it is in his interest to exercise the call if the price goes above $50, even if it does not reach $55, because the profit he makes will reduce his net loss.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} how share restrictions affect hedge fund performance in crisis and non-crisis periods. Consistent with prior research, {{we find that}} more illiquid funds produce both higher returns and alphas in the pre-crisis period. Hence, funds generate a <b>share</b> illiquidity <b>premium</b> for investors as a compensation for limited liquidity. In contrast, in the crisis period, this <b>share</b> illiquidity <b>premium</b> turns into an illiquidity discount. While share restrictions enable funds to manage illiquid assets effectively in the pre-crisis period, they {{do not seem to}} be sufficient to ensure effective management of illiquid portfolios in crisis periods. Our results also show that more rigorous share restrictions do not effectively prevent fund outflows in the crisis periods. Share restrictions also do not protect hedge funds from margin calls and forced deleveraging. Thus, funds are often not able to liquidate positions in an orderly fashion during a financial crisis and asset fire sales might take place. JEL Classification: G 01; G 12; G 2...|$|R
