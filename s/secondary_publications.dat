50|$|Adair {{warns of}} gross factual {{inaccuracy}} in most <b>secondary</b> <b>publications</b> on Hawthorne effect {{and that many}} studies failed to find it.

So for Adair, the issue is that an experimental effect depends on the participants' interpretation of the situation; this is why manipulation checks are important in social sciences experiments. So he thinks it is not awareness per se, nor special attention per se, but participants' interpretation that must be investigated in order to discover if/how the experimental conditions interact with the participants' goals. This can affect whether participants believe something, if they act on it or do not see it as in their interest, etc.|$|E

It aims to discuss the assumption that, by sponsoring the 2016 Special Partnership for Democracy, Peace and Prosperity with Myanmar, the EU was seeking to promote its role in Southeast Asia. It focuses on a few developments that contribute towards enhancing the EU’s involvement in cooperating with Myanmar. It examines how the former Myanmar President entertained diplomatic relations, in 2013, with the European capitals and the EU, and questions whether President Sein was possibly making efforts to free the country from subjection to other powers, specifically China. It discusses how Yangon’s slight distancing of itself from Beijing, combined with Sein’s opening up towards Europe, played the effect of boosting political activity regarding Myanmar at the EU level. It explores the EU’s policies on Myanmar and whether these attempt to respond to Sein’s search for assistance. It, lastly, assesses the article’s assumption.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this comparative survey {{of the use of}} classification in science information is to explore the possibility of adopting a standard general classification in this field. Classification is defined as the grouping, division and/or sequencing according to meaning, of subject representations such.

Classificatory arrangements used in a number of <b>secondary</b> <b>publications</b> are compared with general classifications and with each other. Classificatory relations used in some major thesauri are also compared with general classifications and with each other. The general classifications differ from the intermediate documents with which they were compared in two ways: they lack some of the subject terms used by the documents, and differ in some of their classifactory relations (grouping, decision and sequencing). The overall picture is that, although classification schemes do not occur in all intermediate documents, the use of classificatory relations for both arrangement and thesauric information retrieval is widespread.

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to examine the extent to which social science {{research}} data are shared and assess whether sharing is associated positively with number of publications resulting from the research data. We construct a database from administrative records containing information about thousands of social science studies that have been conducted over the last 40 years. Included in the database are descriptions of social science data collections funded by the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health. Using a subset of these awards, we conduct a survey of principal investigators (n= 1, 021). We find that very few social science data collections are preserved and disseminated by an archive or institutional repository. Informal sharing of data in the social sciences is much more common. The main analysis examines publication metrics that can be tied to the research data collected with NSF and NIH funding – total publications, primary publications (including PI), and <b>secondary</b> <b>publications</b> (nonresearch team). Multivariate models of the count of publications suggest that data sharing, especially sharing data through an archive, is associated with many more times the publications compared to not sharing data.
