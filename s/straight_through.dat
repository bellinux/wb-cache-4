5|$|Although Coatbridge has {{no major}} river running through it, the North Calder Water runs east-west {{to the south}} and the now defunct Monkland Canal used to run <b>straight</b> <b>through</b> the centre of the town toward Glasgow. The canal route through Coatbridge can still be seen today. There are also several smaller burns which run through Coatbridge, most of which drain to the North Calder Water. Coatbridge has four {{significant}} public parks. Dunbeth park, West End park, Whifflet park and Drumpellier Country park. Woodend and Witchwood Loch are situated on the north-west edge of Coatbridge.|$|E
5|$|In late 1944 several British {{air attacks}} damaged the U-boat bases in Bergen. During {{one of these}} attacks, a 'Tallboy' bomb went <b>straight</b> <b>through</b> the roof of pen 3, {{damaging}} it beyond repair and putting it out of action {{for the remainder of}} the war. The base was handed over to the Allies, along with the rest of occupied Norway, on 8 May 1945 when all German forces in Europe surrendered. As a result of the intensive bombing of the city in late 1944 and 1945, the Bergen area was one of the worst damaged regions in the south of Norway at the conclusion of the war.|$|E

5|$|Members of the red-breasted {{nuthatch}} superspecies excavate their own tree holes, although most other nuthatches use natural holes or old woodpecker nests. Several species {{reduce the size}} of the entrance hole and seal up cracks with mud. The {{red-breasted nuthatch}} makes the nest secure by daubing sticky conifer resin globules around the entrance, the male applying the resin outside and the female inside. The resin may deter predators or competitors (the resident birds avoid the resin by diving <b>straight</b> <b>through</b> the entrance hole). The white-breasted nuthatch smears blister beetles around the entrance to its nest, and {{it has been suggested that}} the unpleasant smell from the crushed insects deters squirrels, its chief competitor for natural tree cavities.|$|E

In Hamilton, Highway403 descends the Niagara Escarpment. It wraps around the northern side of Burlington Bay to encounter the QEW. From there, it travels <b>straight</b> <b>through</b> Burlington and Oakville with the QEW, departing to the north at the Mississauga–Oakville boundary. The freeway then crosses through the centre of Mississauga in an east–west direction, serving its city centre, before turning north. It continues north of Highway401 as Highway410 to Brampton.|$|E
5|$|By 1932, US-36 {{headed west}} from Norton toward Oberlin instead of {{southwest}} toward Selden, {{and all of}} what is K-383 became part of US-83. The entire route from Selden to Nebraska had been straightened, mostly paralleling the railroad instead of following section lines, except for through Oronoque and Jennings. US-83 was a gravel road from Selden to the NortonPhillips county line, east of which the highway remained a dirt road until it was graveled in 1937. The highway was relocated <b>straight</b> <b>through</b> Jennings and to a path with fewer turns through Oronoque in 1938; that same year, the highway was paved with a bituminous surface along the US-36 concurrency. US-83 was paved from the US-36 split to the Nebraska state line in 1940. The highway was paved from Selden to Dresden by 1945 and from Dresden to US-36 west of Norton in 1948. US-383 {{was assigned to the}} entire length of the K-383 corridor and beyond in both directions by 1945.|$|E

5|$|Highway {{construction}} in the mid-1930s further altered the park. The first of these proposals was the Grand Concourse Extension, later the Mosholu Parkway Extension, which was already being paved in 1934, when Robert Moses became Parks Commissioner. Moses immediately started planning for the Henry Hudson Parkway, which was originally envisioned {{as an extension of}} Riverside Drive. As proposed, the parkway would have only skirted the park's northwest corner in order to connect with the Saw Mill River Parkway in Westchester. However, due to that plan's high cost, the route was amended and the Henry Hudson Parkway became an extension of the West Side Elevated Highway, cutting <b>straight</b> <b>through</b> the park to intersect with the Saw Mill River Parkway. Unlike the Concourse extension, the Henry Hudson Parkway was minimally opposed by the community, as it was widely seen as an improvement. Work on the parkway began in 1935.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden, {{under the}} {{direction}} of Ernest Rutherford, bombarded a metal foil with alpha particles to observe how they scattered. They expected all the alpha particles to pass <b>straight</b> <b>through</b> with little deflection, because Thomson's model said that the charges in the atom are so diffuse that their electric fields could not affect the alpha particles much. However, Geiger and Marsden spotted alpha particles being deflected by angles greater than 90°, which was supposed to be impossible according to Thomson's model. To explain this, Rutherford proposed that the positive charge of the atom is concentrated in a tiny nucleus {{at the center of the}} atom. Rutherford compared his findings to one firing a 15-inch shell at a sheet of tissue paper and it coming back to hit the person who fired it.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the first-half, it was Alavés who started the half the better of the two sides. Contra put a cross from {{the right side of}} the pitch into the penalty area, which was met by Moreno, whose header beat Westerveld to make the scoreline 3–2. Four minutes later Alavés had equalised. They were awarded a free-kick 25 yards away from goal and Moreno went <b>straight</b> <b>through</b> the Liverpool wall and into the goal past Westerveld. Liverpool reacted to the scoreline being levelled at 3–3 by substituting Stéphane Henchoz with Vladimír Šmicer. Steven Gerrard was placed in the right-back position as a result of the change. Three minutes later, Owen was brought down by defender Antonio Karmona, who was subsequently booked. Liverpool were awarded a free-kick, which Gary McAllister hit into the Alavés wall. In the 64th minute, both sides made substitutions. Liverpool replaced Emile Heskey with Robbie Fowler, while Alavés goalscorer Javi Moreno with Pablo.|$|E

5|$|Over the years, several traffic circles {{have been}} {{modified}} or replaced along Route 73. The Marlton Circle at Route 70 in Marlton was modified in 1974 to allow Route 73 to run directly <b>straight</b> <b>through</b> the circle. This circle became known for traffic backups {{and was replaced}} with an interchange. Construction on this interchange, which cost $31 million, began in April 2009. In May 2010, the circle was eliminated with a temporary at-grade intersection constructed while the Route 73 bridge over Route 70 was being built. The interchange was completed in June 2011. A traffic circle that existed {{at the intersection of}} Route 38 and Route 41 in Maple Shade Township was removed by the 1960s and replaced by the current set of interchanges. In addition, the Berlin Circle in Berlin was replaced by an at-grade intersection between August 2005 and September 2006 at a cost of $73 million.|$|E
5|$|The Belgian Army {{could muster}} 22 divisions, which {{contained}} 1,338 artillery pieces but just 10 AMC 35 tanks. However, the Belgian combat vehicles included 200 T-13 tank destroyers. These {{had an excellent}} 47mm antitank gun and a coaxial FN30 machine gun in a turret. The Belgians also possessed 42 T-15s. They were officially described as armoured cars but were actually fully tracked tanks with a 13.2mm turret machine gun. The standard Belgian anti-tank gun was the 47mm FRC, towed either by trucks or by fully tracked armoured Utilitie B-tractors. One report states that a round from a 47mm gun went <b>straight</b> <b>through</b> a Sd kfz 231 and penetrated the armour of the Panzer IV behind it. These Belgian guns were better than the 25mm and 37mm guns of respectively the French and the Germans.|$|E
5|$|The {{road was}} {{designed}} as part of Pentonville, a new suburb away from the City and became a local hub for manufacturing in the area. There was some debate over the final route of the road; the original plan to run <b>straight</b> <b>through</b> fields owned by the Skinners Company and the New River Company was rejected in favour of the route further north via Battle Bridge. As it was always {{intended to be a}} main road, a coach service began in 1798 between Paddington and Bank but was quickly withdrawn. The road was turnpiked in 1830 and renamed Pentonville Road after landowner Henry Penton in 1857. Until 1882, the upkeep of the road was paid by the local parish, paying a ground rent to Penton's estate for the disused toll house at No.274.|$|E

He lost grip in the wet and went <b>straight</b> <b>through</b> the first chicane. Alonso, Heidfeld, Kubica and Piquet took their only pit stops for the race soon after, all changing to intermediate tyres. By lap36 {{the majority of the}} field were running on intermediate tyres. Webber was passed at turneight by Massa on lap35. The Australian spun after the corner, though managed to retain seventhposition.

5|$|When NY270 was {{assigned}} {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, it began at Main Street (NY5) in the hamlet of Eggertsville and followed Eggert Road north to Millersport Highway. Here, it turned to the northeast, utilizing what is now NY263 to the modern campus of SUNY Buffalo. While today's Millersport Highway veers east to bypass the college, the highway originally went <b>straight</b> <b>through</b> the grounds, partially by way of what is now St. Rita's Lane. North of Ellicott Creek, NY270 proceeded to Getzville via North Forest and Stahl Roads. At Getzville, NY270 joined its modern alignment and followed it to Saunders Settlement Road (now NY31), where it turned northeast onto Saunders Settlement Road for a short distance to Upper Mountain Road, where it ended at NY3 outside of Lockport.|$|E
5|$|Since 1953, {{many changes}} have {{occurred}} to Route 70. Several traffic circles that had existed on the road had been either modified or replaced by at-grade intersections.

Also, the Race Track Circle at the intersection with CR 644 (Haddonfield Road) was eventually replaced by an at-grade intersection. The Laurelton Circle at Route 88, built in 1937, {{was replaced by the}} 1990s. The Ellisburg Circle at Route 41 and Route 154, was replaced by an intersection with jughandles. The Brielle Circle at the eastern terminus was also converted to an intersection with jughandles in 2001. In conjunction with eliminating the Brielle Circle, Route 70 was also widened between the intersection with Jack Martin Boulevard in Brick Township and the former circle. In July 2004, floods caused by heavy rain washed away a bridge along the route in Southampton Township, leading for it to be replaced. The New Jersey Department of Transportation replaced the September 11th Memorial Bridge over the Manasquan River in a $52 million project that increased capacity on the bridge and added monumental decorations and increased pedestrian access. Construction was scheduled to be complete in December 2010; however, the project was completed ahead of schedule in September 2008.|$|E

5|$|The first {{engagement}} that Australian {{troops were}} involved in during the Second World War came at Bardia, a major Italian military outpost {{in the north of}} Libya. The 16th Brigade broke through Bardia's western defensive perimeter at dawn on 3 January 1941, when the 2/1st Battalion breached the wire defences and swung left before advancing. The 2/2nd Battalion followed suit, swinging to the right, and the 2/3rd then moved <b>straight</b> <b>through</b> the breach. Late in the day, a counter-attack by Italian tanks threatened the 2/3rd Battalion's headquarters, until a hastily organised defensive action led by the commanding officer, England, and a platoon of anti-tank guns restored the situation. Meanwhile, the 17th Brigade led a diversion to the south. Although the 16th Brigade was able to capture Bardia in the late afternoon of 4 January, resistance continued, and fighting did not cease until the next morning. Over 40,000 Italians were captured along with significant amounts of equipment and material– including food and ammunition– which was in short supply. A significant amount of alcohol was also captured by the Australians in Italian dugouts inside the 2/3rd's position around Wadi-el-Ghereida. During this period, the 2/3rd lost five officers and 56 men killed or wounded.|$|E
5|$|US-59 heads northward, {{coming to}} an {{interchange}} with US-271 {{just north of the}} Choctaw Country Club in the city of Poteau, county seat of Le Flore County. At this interchange, US-59 exits from the mainline to join US-271; continuing north through the interchange places the motorist on the Poteau Bypass, an unnumbered state highway. US-59 and US-271 proceed through Poteau, {{coming to an}} interchange at the southern terminus of SH-112, which is also the northern terminus of the Poteau Bypass. The two concurrent roads head north through the towns of Shady Point and Panama. North of Panama, US-59 and US-271 form the eastern terminus of SH-31. At Sunset Corner, US-59 turns to the west and US-271 turns to the east, ending the concurrency. SH-9 passes <b>straight</b> <b>through</b> this intersection from west to east; upon turning west, US-59 follows SH-9 for , splitting away southeast of Cowlington. Just north of this junction, US-59 widens to a four-lane divided highway. It crosses the Arkansas River on a bridge just downstream of the dam that impounds Robert S. Kerr Reservoir. Upon crossing the river, the highway enters Sequoyah County.|$|E
5|$|Villaret in Montagne, having {{successfully}} broken {{contact with}} the British flagship and slipped away to the north, managed to gather 11ships of the line around him and formed them up in a reconstituted battle squadron. At 11:30, with the main action drawing to a close, he began a recovery manoeuvre intended to lessen the tactical defeat his fleet had suffered. Aiming his new squadron at the battered Queen, Villaret's attack created consternation in the British fleet, which was unprepared for a second engagement. However, discerning Villaret's intention, Howe also pulled his ships {{together to create a}} new force. His reformed squadron consisted of Queen Charlotte, Royal Sovereign, Valiant, Leviathan, Barfleur, and Thunderer. Howe deployed this squadron in defence of Queen, and the two short lines engaged one another at a distance before Villaret abandoned his manoeuvre and hauled off to collect several of his own dismasted ships that were endeavouring to escape British pursuit. Villaret was subsequently joined by the battered Terrible, which sailed <b>straight</b> <b>through</b> the dispersed British fleet to reach the French lines, and he also recovered the dismasted Scipion, Mucius, Jemmappes, and Républicain—all of which lay within reach of the unengaged British ships—before turning eastwards towards France. At this stage of the battle, Howe retired below and the British consolidation was left to his Captain of the Fleet, Sir Roger Curtis. Curtis was subsequently blamed by some in the Navy for not capturing more of the dismasted French ships, and was also accused of dissuading Howe from attempting further pursuit.|$|E
