40|$|Thousands {{of vessels}} cross EU waters and {{hundreds}} enter into EU ports every day, generating an overwhelming amount of tracking data and reports {{that make it}} possible to disguise illegal operations. Detecting steadily changing deceptive behaviours at sea is becoming like trying to find a needle in a haystack and calls for advanced automatic and adaptive tools to discover useful information from the data. Data mining, information fusion and visual analytics are becoming central to the discovery of knowledge from the increasingly available information on vessels and their movements (e. g. Automatic Identification System - AIS, Long Range Identification and Tracking - LRIT, radar tracks, Earth Observation) at global scale. This enables the automatic detection of <b>structured</b> <b>anomalies,</b> the prediction of vessel routes up to a few days in advance, the behavioural characterisation of vessels, the understanding and mapping of activities at sea and the analysis of their trends over time. Such knowledge provides a new set of possibilities for improving Maritime Situational Awareness and safety of navigation, understanding what is happening and might be happening at sea. This event aims at bringing together technology and research providers (academia, industry) and users (operational authorities) in the field of Maritime Knowledge Discovery to identify current capability gaps and highlight the most promising research strands.

40|$|Lenticulostriate vasculopathy is {{associated}} with various disorders, in particular cytomegalovirus infection, which can cause neurological consequences. We wanted to evaluate the association of lenticulostriate vasculopathy and cytomegalovirus infection. We retrospectively collected data on lenticulostriate vasculopathy from 858 neonatal ultrasonography scans. Methods: Fifty-five patients with lenticulostriate vasculopathy were diagnosed. Lenticulostriate vasculopathy was classified as severe and mild according to the ultrasonographic findings. We analyzed gender, unilateral and bilateral lenticulostriate vasculopathy, mild and severe lenticulostriate vasculopathy, intrauterine growth retardation, and lenticulostriate vasculopathy associated with other brain malformations {{to determine whether they}} were correlated with cytomegalovirus infection. Results: Neonatal cytomegalovirus infections correlated primarily with lenticulostriate vasculopathy that was associated with brain <b>structure</b> <b>anomalies</b> p <  0. 0001, followed by severe lenticulostriate vasculopathy (p =  0. 029). Cytomegalovirus urine polymerase chain reaction ratios were 69 % for severe and 23 % for mild lenticulostriate vasculopathy (p =  0. 002; odds ratio =  7. 33). Of 72 newborns with intrauterine growth retardation without lenticulostriate vasculopathy, 33 were analyzed for cytomegalovirus, of whom only one was positive, which was significantly different from the newborns with lenticulostriate vasculopathy (p =  0. 003; odds ratio =  11. 64). Conclusion: Lenticulostriate vasculopathy on neonatal ultrasonography is useful for predicting cytomegalovirus infection, particularly in severe lenticulostriate vasculopathy. When severe lenticulostriate vasculopathy {{is associated}} with a brain <b>structure</b> <b>anomaly,</b> cytomegalovirus infection should be considered.

40|$|AbstractNon-destructive testing (NDT) {{has been}} {{developed}} as a effective tool in road evaluation system in order to in-situ assess the stiffness parameter of pavement layer, partcularly in conducting a quick assessment on soil subgrade layer. The NDT method based on the seismic surface wave measurement has been recently developed and applied for material evaluation of road-pavement, i. e. the shear wave velocity, Poisson's ratio and dynamic elastic modulus. In this paper, an improved technique of tomography surface waves measurement for simultaneously evaluation of stiffness and anomalies of pavement soil-subgrade is presented. The method performs the time-frequency spectrum analysis on recorded seismic wave data, which is non-destructively sampling the subgrade layers properties. An interactive wavelet analysis {{is used in the}} spectrum analysis to produce the real phase velocity and its corresponding shear wave velocity. Using principal of stress-strain material in elastic behavior, the elastic modulus parameter of soil-subgrade layers is then generated. This method is improved for producing the 2 -D elastic modulus profile and at the same time, it shows the <b>structure</b> <b>anomalies</b> in the investigated subgrade layers. The higher elastic modulus values {{can be found in the}} subgrade layer with more homogeneous soil densities that may be produced from a good degree of compaction. While the lower elastic modulus can be identified in the subgrade layers which are having many structural anomalies. From this study, it can be shown that the tomography seismic surface wave technique is able to simultaneously determine the stiffness and <b>structure</b> <b>anomalies</b> within existing road pavement. Thus, this method can be potentially advanced and developed as an innovative material evaluation device for pavement structures...|$|R

The most evident abnormality in ASD consists in an early (perinatal) brain overgrowth followed by an arrest of growth during the first year of age [4].

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that several small-scale <b>structure</b> <b>anomalies</b> in ΛCDM cosmology can be solved by strong self-interaction between dark matter particles. It was shown by Braaten and Hammer that the presence of a near threshold S-wave resonance can make the scattering cross section at nonrelativistic speeds come close to saturating the unitarity bound. This can result in the formation of a stable bound state of two asymmetric dark matter particles (we call the bound state as darkonium). Laha and Braaten studied the nuclear recoil energy spectrum in dark matter direct detection experiments due to this incident bound state. Here we study the angular recoil spectrum, and show that it is uniquely determined up to normalization by the S-wave scattering length. Observing this angular recoil spectrum in a dark matter directional detection experiment will uniquely determine many of the low-energy properties of dark matter independent of the underlying dark matter microphysics.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the local {{structure}} of a KxFe 2 -ySe 2 superconductor across the phase separation and iron-vacancy order-disorder temperatures (respectively at similar to 520 K and similar to 580 K). The combination of Fe K edge and Se K edge extended x-ray absorption fine-structure (EXAFS) measurements reveal the glassy local structure of KxFe 2 -ySe 2, with anomalous behavior of local atomic displacements. We find that the Fe-Se distance remains temperature independent while the Fe-Fe distance suffers a substantial effect of the phase separation. Furthermore, the Fe-Se network shows a reduced disorder in the phase separation regime at lower temperature.
