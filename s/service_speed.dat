5|$|In January 2006 Queen Mary 2 {{embarked}} on a circumnavigation of South America. Upon departure from Fort Lauderdale, one of her propeller pods was damaged when it struck a channel wall, forcing the ship to sail at a reduced speed, which resulted in Commodore Warwick's decision to skip several calls on its voyage to Rio de Janeiro. Many of her passengers threatened to stage a sit-in protest because of the missed calls, before Cunard offered to refund the voyage costs. Queen Mary 2 continued to operate at a reduced <b>service</b> <b>speed</b> and several itinerary changes were necessary until repairs had been completed after the ship returned to Europe in June, where Queen Mary 2 {{paid a visit to}} dry dock and the damaged propeller pod was unseated. In November, Queen Mary 2 was drydocked once more at the Blohm + Voss yard in Hamburg (drydock Elbe 17) for the reinstallation of the repaired propeller pod. At the same time, sprinkler systems were installed in all of the vessel's balconies to comply with new safety regulations which had come into effect since the MS Star Princess fire. Additionally, both bridge wings were extended by two metres to improve visibility.|$|E

40|$|The authors {{develop a}} {{vertical}} differentiation model which exhibits congestion externalities {{and in which}} firms choose service time. This model is formulated {{for a variety of}} industry and ownership structures. The authors find an ownership effect in which <b>service</b> <b>speeds</b> decrease when public services are privatized. This effect, however, could be offset and even reversed by increased efficiency of private services. The authors also investigate how prices and commitment ability with respect to service times will affect the <b>service</b> <b>speeds</b> in equilibrium.

40|$|A model {{comprising}} several servers, each {{equipped with}} its own queue and with possibly different <b>service</b> <b>speeds,</b> is considered. Each server receives a dedicated arrival stream of jobs; {{there is also a}} stream of generic jobs that arrive to a job scheduler and can be individually allocated to any of the servers. It is shown that if the arrival streams are all Poisson and all jobs have the same exponentially distributed service requirements, the probabilistic splitting of the generic stream that minimizes the average job response time is such that it balances the server idle times in a weighted least-squares sense, where the weighting coefficients are related to the <b>service</b> <b>speeds</b> of the servers. The corresponding result holds for nonexponentially distributed service times if the <b>service</b> <b>speeds</b> are all equal. This result is used to develop adaptive quasi-static algorithms for allocating jobs in the generic arrival stream when the load parameters are unknown. The algorithms utilize server idle-time measurements which are sent periodically to the central job scheduler. A model is developed for these measurements, and the result mentioned is used to cast the problem into one of finding a projection of the root of an affine function, when only noisy values of the function can be observe...|$|R

25|$|When Rautaruukki {{consulted}} Finnlines {{that already}} operated the steel company's conventional bulk carrier Rautaruukki, the shipping company immediately presented the integrated tug barge system it had {{developed in the}} 1970s, the Finnpusku system. A development contract was signed and Finnlines performed several feasibility studies which showed that a pusher-barge system {{would be the most}} economical and efficient method of transporting bulk cargoes on the relatively short routes of the Baltic Sea. Thanks to the extremely short turnaround time at ports, the <b>service</b> <b>speed</b> of the vessel could be lower than that of normal ships, resulting in lower fuel expenses.|$|E
25|$|Mauretania and Lusitania {{were both}} {{designed}} by Cunard naval architect Leonard Peskett, with Swan Hunter and John Brown working from {{plans for an}} ocean greyhound with a stipulated <b>service</b> <b>speed</b> of twenty-four knots in moderate weather, as per the terms of her mail subsidy contract. Peskett's original configuration for the ships in 1902 was a three-funnel design, when reciprocating engines were destined to be the powerplant. A giant model of the ships appeared in Shipbuilder's magazine in this configuration; however, Cunard decided to change power plants to Parson's new turbine technology, and the ship's design was again modified when Peskett added a fourth funnel to the ship's profile. Construction of the vessel finally began with the laying of the keel in August 1904.|$|E

25|$|The {{contract}} for two ships {{was awarded to}} the Finnish state-owned shipbuilding company Valmet and was, at the time, the largest single contract made by a Finnish industrial company at FIM 700 million (US$200 million). Although Valmet had been developing its own barge handling system, {{it was agreed that}} the proven American Seabee concept would be adopted instead of the shipyard's own design due to the relatively short timescale before delivery. The Soviets purchased two sets of drawings from the American owners for US$1 million. However, a number of changes were made to the original design, and as a result the design costs accounted for some 25 percent of the man-hours spent on the project. The work included extensive model testing, which resulted in the adoption of a bulbous bow that alone increased the ships' <b>service</b> <b>speed</b> by 0.5 knots.|$|E
