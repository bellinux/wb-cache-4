5|$|The {{ethos of}} the {{aristocracy}} as exemplified in the English public school greatly influenced Pierre de Coubertin. The public schools subscribed {{to the belief}} that sport formed an important part of education, an attitude <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the saying mens sana in corpore sano, a sound mind in a sound body. In this ethos, a gentleman was one who became an all-rounder, not the best at one specific thing. There was also a prevailing concept of fairness, in which practising or training was considered tantamount to cheating. Those who practised a sport professionally were considered to have an unfair advantage over those who practised it merely as a hobby.|$|E
5|$|Then (on {{the ninth}} page) {{he arrives at}} the first species in the volume, the Greek {{tortoise}}, Testudo graeca. It is <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a paragraph, Cuvier noting {{that it is the}} commonest tortoise in Europe, living in Greece, Italy, Sardinia and (he writes) apparently all round the Mediterranean. He then gives its distinguishing marks, with a highly domed carapace, raised scales boldly marked with black and yellow marbling, and at the posterior edge a bulge over the tail. He gives its size—rarely reaching a foot in length; notes that it lives on leaves, fruit, insects and worms; digs a hole in which to pass the winter; mates in spring, and lays 4 or 5 eggs like those of a pigeon. The species is illustrated with two plates.|$|E

25|$|EcM {{communities}} {{continue to}} exhibit rare EcM fungal constituents {{that have not}} been excluded, despite intense competition. Thus, mechanisms must exist that maintain diverse levels of EcM fungi. This coexistence can be <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> four non-mutually exclusive possibilities illustrated by Bruns: niche partitioning, disturbance-related patch dynamics, density-dependent mortality and competitive networks.|$|E

25|$|During the 1950s {{and early}} 1960s, Gimbutas earned a {{reputation}} as a world-class specialist on Bronze Age Europe, as well as on Lithuanian folk art and the prehistory of the Balts and Slavs, partly <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> her definitive opus, Bronze Age Cultures of Central and Eastern Europe (1965). In her work she reinterpreted European prehistory in light of her backgrounds in linguistics, ethnology, and the history of religions, and challenged many traditional assumptions about the beginnings of European civilization.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of the ring-porous hardwoods, there seems to exist a pretty {{definite}} relation between the rate of growth of timber and its properties. This may be briefly <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the general statement that the more rapid the growth or the wider the rings of growth, the heavier, harder, stronger, and stiffer the wood. This, it must be remembered, applies only to ring-porous woods such as oak, ash, hickory, and others of the same group, and is, of course, subject to some exceptions and limitations.|$|E

25|$|Mr. T.M. Carnegie's {{abilities}} {{were too}} numerous and complex to be <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a sentence. He {{was a man}} of sterling integrity; and it was a common saying in Pittsburg that his word was better than some men's bond. He had remarkable judgment; and his opinion on commercial questions was valued above that of much older and more experienced men. Quick and keen in his perceptions, cautious but progressive in his ideas, faithful to his engagements, and just in all his dealings, he gave to his company that which corporations are habitually lacking, namely, a conscience.|$|E
25|$|In 1898, {{the social}} {{reformer}} Ebenezer Howard {{wrote a book}} entitled To-morrow: A Peaceful Path to Real Reform (later republished as Garden Cities of To-morrow), in which he advocated {{the construction of a}} new kind of town, <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> his Three Magnets diagram as combining the advantages of cities and the countryside while eliminating their disadvantages. Industry would be kept separate from residential areas—such zoning was a new idea at the time—and trees and open spaces would prevail everywhere. His ideas were mocked in the press but struck a chord with many, especially members of the Arts and Crafts movement and the Quakers.|$|E
25|$|The {{wellspring of}} the {{principle}} of humanity is in the essence of social morality which can be <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a single sentence, Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them. This fundamental precept can be found, in almost identical form, in all the great religions, Brahminism, Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, Islam, Judaism and Taoism. It is also the golden rule of the positivists, who do not commit themselves to any religion but only to the data of experience, in the name of reason alone. It is indeed not at all necessary to resort to affective or transcendental concepts to recognize the advantage for men to work together to improve their lot..|$|E

25|$|The {{principal}} results {{which were}} {{expected from the}} exploration of the Mekong may be <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a few words. It was desired, first, that the old maps should be rectified, and the navigability of the river tried, it being our hope that we might bind together French Cochin-China and the western provinces of China by means of it. Were the rapids, of whose existence we knew, an absolute barrier? Were the islands of Khon an impassable difficulty? Was there any truth in the opinion of geographers who, believed that there was a communication between the Meïnam and the Mekong? To gather information respecting the sources of the latter, if it proved impossible to reach them; to solve the different geographical problems which would naturally offer, was {{the first part of the}} programme the commission had to carry out.|$|E
25|$|Other modernists took up {{political}} {{positions that}} did not fit neatly into the left/right model. H.D., Mina Loy and Nathalie Barney, for instance, are now seen as proto-feminists and their openness about their various sexualities {{can be read as}} foreshadowing the 1970s view that the personal is political. H.D., especially after World War I, came to view the goal of modernism as being the bringing about of world peace. However, she also displayed anti-Semitic views in the notebooks for her book Tribute to Freud. Basil Bunting, who came from a Quaker background, was a conscientious objector during World War I, but because of his opposition to Fascism, served in British Military Intelligence in Persia (Iran) during World War II. William Carlos Williams' political views arose from his daily contact with the poor who attended his surgery. He was another for whom the personal and political blended, an approach best <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> his statement that 'A new world is only a new mind'.|$|E
25|$|From 1946, the Nyasaland African Congress {{received}} {{financial and}} political support from Hastings Banda, then living in Britain. Despite this support, Congress lost momentum {{until it was}} reanimated by new Southern Rhodesian proposals for amalgamation in 1948. Post-war British governments of both main parties agreed to a federal solution for Central Africa, not the full amalgamation that the Southern Rhodesian government preferred. The Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland was pushed through in 1953 against very strong African opposition. The main African objections to the Federation were <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a joint memorandum prepared by Hastings Banda for Nyasaland and Harry Nkumbula for Northern Rhodesia in 1951. These were that political domination by the white minority of Southern Rhodesia would prevent greater African political participation and that control by Southern Rhodesian politicians would lead to an extension of racial discrimination and segregation. After Federation was imposed, the Nyasaland African Congress promoted a campaign of non-violent resistance. This {{may have been a}} factor in the Cholo riots in August 1953, although there were also local land issues. In early 1954, Congress abandoned its campaign and lost much of its support.|$|E

30|$|<b>Summing</b> <b>up,</b> <b>in</b> {{contrast}} to ALMPs aiming at generating incentives for employment retention, these aiming at employment creation, {{due to their}} strong transition, screening and competition effects, have generally proven to be more cost-effective and suitable to provide labor market losers with incentives to adapt and work, especially in recoveries. This targeting, which is desirable from a social perspective, also limits cost-ineffective deadweight effects.|$|R
25|$|In an {{infinite}} distributive lattice, {{it may not}} be the case that the lower sets of the join-irreducible elements are in one-to-one correspondence with lattice elements. Indeed, there may be no join-irreducibles at all. This happens, for instance, in the lattice of all natural numbers, ordered with the reverse of the usual divisibility ordering (so x≤y when y divides x): any number x can be expressed as the join of numbers xp and xq where p and q are distinct prime numbers. However, elements in infinite distributive lattices may still be represented as sets via Stone's representation theorem for distributive lattices, a form of Stone duality in which each lattice element corresponds to a compact open set in a certain topological space. This generalized representation theorem can be expressed as a category-theoretic duality between distributive lattices and spectral spaces (sometimes called coherent spaces, but not the same as the coherent spaces in linear logic), topological spaces in which the compact open sets are closed under intersection and form a base for the topology. Hilary Priestley showed that Stone's representation theorem could be interpreted as an extension of the idea of representing lattice elements by lower sets of a partial order, using Nachbin's idea of ordered topological spaces. Stone spaces with an additional partial order linked with the topology via Priestley separation axiom can also be used to represent bounded distributive lattices. Such spaces are known as Priestley spaces. Further, certain bitopological spaces, namely pairwise Stone spaces, generalize Stone's original approach by utilizing two topologies on a set to represent an abstract distributve lattice. Thus, Birkhoff's representation theorem extends to the case of infinite (bounded) distributive lattices in at least three different ways, <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> duality theory for distributive lattices.|$|E
