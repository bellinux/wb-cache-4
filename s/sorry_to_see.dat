5|$|When Nick returns after {{a seven-year}} absence, he tells Dot {{he has changed}} {{and is now a}} plumber, {{introducing}} her to his six-year-old daughter Dotty Cotton (Molly Conlin). However, Dot discovers that Nick is only there for her money. She refuses to pay him, so he tells her if she does not, she cannot see Dotty. Dot gives Nick the money and looks after Dotty. It is revealed Dotty and Nick are planning to kill Dot for her life insurance. They convince her that she has symptoms of dementia, but their plan backfires when Dotty exposes the plot. In a rage, Nick holds various members of the community hostage, resulting in an explosion in Kathy's café. Nick survives and after being disowned again by Dot, he informs her that Dotty had masterminded the murder plot before fleeing. Dotty is retrieved by her mother, Sandy (Caroline Pegg), following various devious deeds, such as accusing Dot of beating her, which leads to Dot being questioned by the police for child abuse. Nevertheless, Dot is <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Dotty go.|$|E
25|$|The {{neatness}} of his attire {{was almost}} incredible; I believe {{a speck of}} dust would have caused him more pain than a bullet wound. Yet this quaint dandified little man who, I was <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> <b>see,</b> now limped badly, {{had been in his}} time one of the most celebrated members of the Belgian police.|$|E
25|$|His {{leadership}} of the group had been strong and colorful. He had been rough on {{those who did not}} produce but fine to those who had.

25|$|You {{always told}} us to remain here {{and take care of}} our lands. It made our hearts glad to hear that was your wish... but now, father, we see you drawing back, and we are <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> our father doing so without seeing the enemy. We must compare our father's conduct to a fat animal, that carries its tail upon its back, but when affrighted, it drops it between its legs and runs off.|$|E
25|$|Our apprehensions {{are raised}} by very {{different}} objects. You seem to dread {{the prevalence of}} Paine's opinions (which in most parts I detest {{as much as you}} do) while I am much more afraid of the total annihilation of all principles of liberty and resistance, an event which I am sure you would be as <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> as I. We both hate the two extremes equally, but we differ in opinions with respect to the quarter from which the danger is most pressing.|$|E
25|$|The 2002–03 and 03-04 seasons yielded no medals for Jokerit. In {{the spring}} of 2003, Jokerit {{acquired}} forward Glen Metropolit from the Washington Capitals organization; despite his unimpressive NHL record, Metropolit became scoring leader of Jokerit in both the 2003–04 regular season and playoffs, {{as well as the}} 2004–05 regular season. Metropolit became a firm fan favorite, and many were <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him leave the Finnish league after the 2004–05 season. Another important Jokerit acquisition was goalie Tim Thomas from the Boston Bruins organization. Thomas played in every game of the season bar two with a save percentage of 94.59% and a record-breaking 15 shutouts, for which he won the Kultainen kypärä award.|$|E

500|$|Hunter and Winchester-ally Bobby Singer {{makes his}} debut, and {{is played by}} Jim Beaver. Beaver had worked with {{executive}} producer Robert Singer on the television series Reasonable Doubts, and Singer gave him the part without viewing his audition tape. The episode also features the final appearance of the demonically-possessed Meg Masters as played by Nicki Aycox. Director Kim Manners was <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her go, as he felt Meg {{had the potential to}} become a [...] "great nemesis" [...] for the Winchesters.|$|E

[...] He said that excepting that from His Lear by Sharpe, that from Northcote's children in the Tower, and some small ones, there were few that could be approved. [...] Such a mixture of dotting and engraving, and such a general deficiency in respect of drawing which He observed the Engravers seemed to know little of, that the volumes presented a mass of works which He did not wonder many subscribers had declined to continue their subscription.|$|E
500|$|The final film, Harry Potter and the Deathly HallowsPart 2, was {{released}} in July 2011. Radcliffe, along with the film, was critically acclaimed: Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post asked, [...] "Who could have predicted that Radcliffe, Grint and Watson {{would turn out to}} be good actors?"; similarly, Rex Reed said: [...] "Frankly, I’m <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> [...] go"; while Rolling Stone critic Peter Travers commented on Radcliffe: [...] "Well played, sir."

500|$|Bill Treadway of DVD Verdict {{said that}} Squidward is [...] "a cross between Bert , Woody Allen, and Roger Addison ...but {{he has some}} heart, {{if you can find}} it". Treadway called him [...] "the {{straight}} man for his neighbor's antics". Film critic A. O. Scott of The New York Times said, in his review of The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, that Squidward is one of his favorite secondary characters on the show, along with Sandy Cheeks and Mrs. Puff. He wrote, [...] "I was <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> [...] pushed to the margins". Also from the same publication, television critic Joyce Millman said that Squidward has [...] "the nasal bitchiness of Paul Lynde and the artistic pretensions of Felix Unger." [...] Millman further wrote, [...] "Hmmm, Squidward is one gay squid, I think." ...|$|E

[...] However, he continued {{to have a major}} impact on the historiography of the Battle of Jutland by serving throughout the 1920s as Winston Churchill's naval consultant on submarine-warfare. [...] Churchill wrote an anti-Jellicoe tract in his World Crisis, Volume III which in large measure shared Dewar's views on tactics and even some diagrams. [...] Although Dewar would later become a supporter of the Labour Party, after Churchill was passed over for a cabinet position in 1931 Dewar wrote to him on 16 November, [...] "I am very <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that you are not in the new Cabinet.

500|$|On 30 July 2002, Neil Wilkes from Digital Spy {{reported}} that Taylor had quit Coronation Street after five years. Wilkes revealed that her contract would expire in October that year, but the actress {{had chosen to}} stay with the serial beyond that to give the writers time {{to come up with a}} storyline for her character's departure. Series producer Kieran Roberts added that he was <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Taylor go, but understood her decision to move on. Taylor later explained that she chose to leave because she and the writers struggled to come up with storylines for Toyah. She told the Liverpool Echo's Janet Tansley [...] "I was asked where she would go from there and couldn't think what she could do. If I couldn't see a future for her, I couldn't play her." [...] Taylor filmed her final scenes on 3 January 2003.|$|E

500|$|Colbeck {{started the}} new season in League Two as a substitute, but won {{a place in the}} side, and scored his first senior goal against Lincoln City more than three years after his debut. However, after a mistake cost defeat to Milton Keynes Dons, he was told he could join another club on loan. On 24 October 2007, Colbeck went on a month-long loan to Darlington {{to take the place of}} injured Julian Joachim. Colbeck scored in both his second and third games before the loan was {{extended}} for a second month. The loan deal was cut short when he returned to Bradford City in December 2007 after he had made six appearances for Darlington, but Darlington manager Dave Penney was disappointed to see Colbeck leave saying, [...] "Joe was fantastic for us. He scored a couple of goals and had a real effect on us so we're <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him go." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1853, {{with the}} party {{increasingly}} divided over the slavery issue, Greeley printed an editorial disclaiming the paper's identity as Whig and declaring it to be nonpartisan. He was confident that the paper would not suffer financially, trusting in reader loyalty. Some in the party were not <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him go: the Republic, a Whig organ, mocked Greeley and his beliefs: [...] "If a party is to be built up and maintained on Fourierism, Mesmerism, Maine Liquor laws, Spiritual Rappings, Kossuthism, Socialism, Abolitionism, and forty other isms, we have no disposition to mix with any such companions." [...] When in 1854, Illinois Senator Stephen Douglas introduced his Kansas-Nebraska Bill, allowing residents of each territory to decide {{whether it would be}} slave or free, Greeley strongly fought the legislation in his newspaper. [...] After it passed, and the Border War broke out in Kansas Territory, Greeley was part of efforts to send free-state settlers there, and to arm them. In return, proponents of slavery recognized Greeley and the Tribune as adversaries, stopping shipments of the paper to the South and harassing local agents. Nevertheless, by 1858, the Tribune reached 300,000 subscribers through the weekly edition, and it would continue as the foremost American newspaper through the years of the Civil War.|$|E
500|$|He {{travels to}} Ceram, where he enjoys {{the company of}} a {{multilingual}} Flemish plantation owner. He finds few birds despite constant searching and wading through rivers; the water and the rough ground destroy both his pairs of shoes, and he returns home on the last day lame from walking [...] "in my stockings very painfully". Sailing in the Matabello Islands, he is blown ten miles off course, his men fearing being swept on to the coast of New Guinea [...] "in which case we should most likely all be murdered" [...] as the tribes there are treacherous and bloodthirsty. He is <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that even the smallest children here all chew betel-nut and are disfigured by sores from a poor diet. However he enjoys their palm wine which he finds more like cider than beer, and the [...] "water" [...] inside young coconuts, which, he explains, is nothing like the undrinkable contents of the old dry coconuts on sale in England. He buys a prau and surprises the people by fitting it out himself, using tools [...] "of the best London make", but lacking a large drill the holes have to be made, very slowly, by boring with hot iron rods. Travelling round Ceram, the crew from Goram run away. He describes in detail the process of making sago.|$|E

500|$|After he {{admitted}} to suffering from drink and gambling addictions he visited the Sporting Chance clinic, determined to turn his life around. After his rehabilitation, he was originally offered a trial with League One side Brighton & Hove Albion, where he scored two goals in two reserve team games against Brentford and Leyton Orient. He left without an offer of a contract, but was offered another trial with League Two side Rotherham United, where he played in a reserves victory over Huddersfield Town. On 12 November, Roberts was offered {{a contract with the}} [...] "Millers". Manager Ronnie Moore commented: [...] "He's only 22 but has real talent... people say he comes with baggage but his attitude has been first class. I think he deserves a second chance." [...] Later in the month Roberts signed a one-month contract. The following month the option to extend Roberts' Rotherham deal {{until the end of the}} 2009–10 season was taken. In his fifth appearance for Rotherham, a 4–2 win over Yorkshire rivals Bradford City, he scored his first goal for the club in 'sensational' fashion by finding the net with a free kick from fifty yards out. However, in April 2010 it was announced he had been sacked from Rotherham for breaking club discipline rules several times. The club did not divulge what the final breach was; though the [...] "bitterly disappointed" [...] manager said that while the player was [...] "full of remorse" [...] his teammates would not be [...] "too <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him go".|$|E
500|$|In its {{original}} broadcast, [...] "Fresh Blood" [...] was viewed by an estimated 2.88 million viewers. The episode received generally positive reviews from critics. Tina Charles of TV Guide praised the episode, commenting that [...] "it {{was really nice}} to get an enjoyable episode high on intensity, brotherly interaction, blood and gore". Although she had grown a [...] "tad bit weary" [...] of the character's continuous attempts to kill Sam, she was still [...] "really <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Sterling and Gordy go". Charles felt that his transformation was a [...] "good twist", and liked that his [...] "black-and-white beliefs" [...] remained the same even after becoming a vampire. She also enjoyed the character of Lucy and her [...] "really sad" [...] ending, and wished that McNab's role had been larger. It was noted that the [...] "brotherly interaction was front and center", and Charles was [...] "beyond happy" [...] that Sam confronted Dean about is behavior. The [...] "moment that [...] been waiting for all season long" [...] finally came to be when Dean took Sam seriously and actually listened to him instead of replying with sarcasm. Charles also deemed the final scene with the brothers to be [...] "just heartbreaking". Likewise, Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune not only gave the episode an A+, but ranked it as the sixth-best episode of the 2007-2008 television season. She praised writer Sera Gamble and director Kim Manners for [...] "creating the best bonding scene we've had all season", and lauded Padalecki and Ackles for [...] "making us care so much and believe so fully that a scene like this can leave us gasping".|$|E
500|$|Among {{the more}} hostile press reviews {{was that of}} Le Figaros critic, Henri Quittard, who called the work [...] "a {{laborious}} and puerile barbarity" [...] and added [...] "We are <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> an artist such as M. Stravinsky involve himself in this disconcerting adventure". On the other hand, Gustav Linor, writing in the leading theatrical magazine Comoedia, thought the performance was superb, especially that of Maria Piltz; the disturbances, while deplorable, were merely [...] "a rowdy debate" [...] between two ill-mannered factions. Emile Raudin, of Les Marges, who had barely heard the music, wrote: [...] "Couldn't we ask M. Astruc... to set aside one performance for well-intentioned spectators?... We could at least propose to evict the female element". The composer Alfredo Casella thought that the demonstrations were aimed at Nijinsky's choreography {{rather than at the}} music, a view shared by the critic Michel-Dimitri Calvocoressi, who wrote: [...] "The idea was excellent, but was not successfully carried out". Calvocoressi failed to observe any direct hostility to the composer—unlike, he said, the premiere of Debussy's Pelléas et Mélisande in 1902. Of later reports that the veteran composer Camille Saint-Saëns had stormed out of the premiere, Stravinsky observed that this was impossible; Saint-Saëns did not attend. Stravinsky also rejected Cocteau's story that, after the performance, Stravinsky, Nijinsky, Diaghilev and Cocteau himself took a cab to the Bois de Boulogne where a tearful Diaghilev recited poems by Pushkin. Stravinsky merely recalled a celebratory dinner with Diaghilev and Nijinsky, at which the impresario expressed his entire satisfaction with the outcome. To Maximilien Steinberg, a former fellow-pupil under Rimsky-Korsakov, Stravinsky wrote that Nijinsky's choreography had been [...] "incomparable: {{with the exception of a}} few places, everything was as I wanted it".|$|E
