40|$|The {{demand for}} large {{discharge}} sluices in Viet Nam is increasing as the constructions of small river barriers show their restrictions in flooding and salt intrusion protection. The main {{objective of this}} study is therefore to research an appropriate design for the sluice structure type that can be applied in Vung Tau Go Cong, which is the largest project of discharge sluice in Viet Nam so far. From the literature review, {{it can be seen that}} in the Netherlands, several units of <b>sluice</b> <b>caisson</b> have been applied but their main function was only to permanently close the basin, while in Viet Nam only a single caisson is applied as small river barriers. It is to say that a large discharge sluice with several units of caisson has never been built so far. In contrast with this type of structure, most of discharge sluices and barriers in the world have been build according to the “pier structure type”. In the Netherlands piers and bottom slabs are normally placed on batter pile foundations. Meanwhile in Viet Nam, piers are often placed on vertical pile foundations and a bottom slab is replaced by supporting beams. Because of both “proven structure”- caisson and pier have their own strong and weak points, by combining the best features of these “proven technologies” of the Netherlands and Viet Nam; two appropriate structure types were designed and the critical concerns related to them were checked. It is concluded that the caisson and pier sluice structure are feasible solutions for the discharge sluice at Vung Tau Go cong. It can be also considered as an innovative structure for larger discharge sluice. Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management (CoMEM) Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

It would be built of rock fill {{embankment}} at the coastal sides (more like the proposals for [...] "Tidal Lagoons"), but like the STPG would be <b>sluice</b> <b>caissons</b> and turbines with powerhouse in the middle section.|$|R
40|$|In the Mekong Delta Vietnam, the {{construction}} of sluices {{with the purpose of}} retaining fresh water and preventing salt water intrusion potentially plays a very important role. However, the structures constructed in small rivers according to local or traditional technology revealed many disadvantages related to the economical, evacuation and ecological conditions. Hence, the demand for large sluices in the larger rivers and estuaries is increasing. In the Netherlands, several units of <b>sluice</b> <b>caissons</b> have been applied but their main function was only to permanently close the basin, while in Viet Nam only single caissons are applied as small river barriers. It is to be noted that a large discharge <b>sluice</b> with several <b>caisson</b> units has never been built so far in Vietnam or in the Netherlands. In contrast with this type of structure, most discharge sluices and barriers in the world have been built according to the "pier structure type". In the Netherlands piers and bottom slabs are normally placed on batter pile foundations. In Viet Nam, piers are often placed on vertical pile foundations and a bottom slab is replaced by supporting beams. Both "proven structure"- caissons and piers have their own strong and weak points; by combining the best features of "proven sluice technologies" of the Netherlands and Vi et N atn, appropriate structure types were designed and the most critical concerns related to them were checked. Besides, the improvements and combination of the hydraulic automatic gates and <b>caisson</b> <b>sluice</b> are also considered. The final results show that they are feasible and innovative solutions for the sluices in the large estuary branches in the Mekong Delta Vietnam, which can be applied to discharge a large amount of water, prevent tidal penetration and retain fresh water.

5000|$|After {{just such}} a {{deterioration}} (due to the Iranian Revolution and 1979 energy crisis) the plans were reinvestigated by the Severn Barrage Committee in 1981. This committee {{was known as the}} [...] "Bondi Committee" [...] (after Professor Sir Hermann Bondi). The committee investigated 6 possible barrage locations, from English Stones {{at the top of the}} estuary, down to a location largely at sea in the Bristol Channel between Lynmouth in North Devon and Porthcawl in South Wales. It produced a major energy paper, which recommended a 10 mi long barrage of concrete powerhouse between Brean Down and Lavernock Point, <b>sluice</b> and plain <b>caissons</b> together with sand and rock-fill embankments. It would have generated 7,200 MW on the flow of the tides (the largest barrage considered could have produced double that power output). This set of plans was strongly built on a few years later by the Severn Tidal Power Group.|$|R
