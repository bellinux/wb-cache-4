Now, if there be any part of landscape in which nature develops her principles of light and shade more clearly than another, it is rock; for the dark sides of fractured stone receive brilliant reflexes from the lighted surfaces, on which the shadows are marked with the most exquisite precision, especially because, owing to the parallelism of cleavage, the surfaces lie usually in directions nearly parallel. Hence every crack and fissure has its shadow and reflected light separated with the most delicious distinctness, and the organization and solid form of all parts are told with a decision of language, which, to be followed with anything like fidelity, requires the most transparent color, and the most delicate and <b>scientific</b> <b>drawing.</b> So far are the works of the old landscape-painters from rendering this, that it is exceedingly rare to find a single passage in which the shadow can even be distinguished from the dark side--they scarcely seem to know the one to be darker than the other; and the strokes of the brush are not used to explain or express a form known or conceived, but are dashed and daubed about without any aim beyond the covering of the canvas. [...] "A rock," [...] the old masters appear to say to themselves, [...] "is a great irregular, formless, characterless lump; but it must have shade upon it, and any gray marks will do for that shade." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{starting}} of the “flight” of {{the present}} work was the personal discovery, during the classes of <b>Scientific</b> <b>Drawing,</b> unveiled into the enormous pleasure of observing and drawing birds. The designing of a “Bird Guide” for children came from the realization of its absence in the shelves of bookstores and libraries {{in the area of}} Lisbon. Believing that you protect what you know, from the beginning it was our intent to build this guide for children identifying through <b>scientific</b> <b>drawing,</b> trying to create a visual object which in the future would facilitate the knowledge and identification {{of a small group of}} passerines, small birds which daily and freely share their movements and chants with each one of us. Curiosity and the pleasure of knowing and researching the relationship between Man and birds, guided the theoretical framework by its visual representation, since the pre-historical stones till the recent pencil drawings and watercolours on paper, the “Bird Guides”, and our attitude from beginners to observers and drawers of birds. Reminding Almada Negreiros who one day asked a child to draw a flower, several children, aged 2 year to 9 year olds, were asked to draw a bird, trying to understand the perception of a bird that exists during childhood, so as to bring our drawings closer to that perception. “My first Bird Guide”, so was it called, was built under the assumption that the child’s knowledge and involvement in the different forms of Nature is important, so the observation and knowledge about birds places the child in direct contact with the environment and with an organized life form. With the contact with birds, day by day the child adopts attitudes of protection, because when you know and understand, you protect, in the present as well as in the futur...|$|E

40|$|Arenaria bernensis (Caryophyllaceae), {{traditionally}} placed within the Arenaria ciliata aggregate and discovered only in 1955, is a poorly studied endemic taxon of western Prealps in Switzerland. In this study, we aimed {{to deliver the}} first detailed appraisal on morphology, distribution and ecology of A. bernensis accompanied by first molecular insights into the A. ciliata aggregate using chloroplast (cp) DNA markers. Altogether 18 populations attributed morphologically to A. bernensis were found during our field surveys. The distribution area of A. bernensis forms an irregular line of ca. 50 km from the south-west (Dent de Lys, FR) to the north-east (Stockhorn, BE). The taxon counts globally ca. 4, 000 individuals {{and the majority of}} populations are small (< 100 individuals). Furthermore, our study demonstrates clear ecological and phytosociological differentiation between A. bernensis and Arenaria multicaulis, another member of the A. ciliata complex growing in the same geographic area. Arenaria bernensis grows exclusively on shady, cool and steep slopes with northern exposition in the alpine zone above 1, 900 – 2, 000 m a. s. l. Results of our chloroplast DNA analyses suggest that the A. ciliata aggregate is a monophyletic group (including A. ciliata s. str., A. multicaulis, A. gothica and A. bernensis). Additionally, A. bernensis is genetically closer to A. multicaulis than to A. ciliata s. str. However, our data also suggest that A. bernensis has a complex evolutionary history. Future investigation of nuclear genomic DNA is needed to clarify the phylogenetic status of A. bernensis. The present paper also delivers a first <b>scientific</b> <b>drawing</b> of A. bernensis and a detailed English description of its morphology. The here documented narrow endemic character of A. bernensis emphasizes the role of the western Prealps as a peripheral refugia during Quaternary glaciations...|$|E
40|$|Manipulative {{skills and}} {{abilities}} include skills in the handling and manipulation of materials and apparatus {{in the context of}} scientific investigation, as well as the ability to follow instructions and make accurate observation. Students lack exposure to hands-on activities at primary level and this could lead to deficiency in manipulative skills and they will carry this problem to secondary school. Transition to secondary school is a challenging process for students whereby they have to adapt with academic, social and emotional issues to fit into their new environment. Thus {{the purpose of this study}} was to explore and investigate the acquisition of students‟ manipulative skills during the transition from primary school (end of Year Six) to secondary school (early Form One). A qualitative study was employed in this research. The participants were selected using the purposive sampling technique. This study was conducted for a period of 11 months and involved 10 participants where the same students were tracked during their transition from the end of Year Six in primary school to the middle of Form One in secondary school. The Manipulative Skills in Transition Tasks (MSTT) instrument has been constructed by the researcher and was completed by the students in order to understand their ability in using four (4) scientific apparatus which are the measuring cylinder, thermometer, Bunsen burner and microscope. The primary data collection techniques used in this study were observation of students doing the MSTT tasks, interviews and examination of the students‟ <b>scientific</b> <b>drawing.</b> Data from early, mid and late transition were analyzed using the constant comparative method of data analysis. Two dimensions emerged during data analyses which were technical skills and functional aspects of performing laboratory task. Each dimension can be explained v through the understanding of elements and sub-elements, respectively. The findings described students‟ manipulative skills during transition. Findings indicated that there is a gap in manipulative skills during transition and this needs to be addressed. If not, the gap may impede the students‟ continuity in the acqusition of manipulative skills during early, mid and late transition. The findings also show that students‟ cognitive ability did not reflect their true ability in manipulative skills. Based on the findings, the Meniti Peralihan (MeP) resource guide has been developed. The resource guide provides an appropriate method to identify the students level of competency in manipulative skills during transition. The evaluation of the appropriateness of this resource guide has been conducted on 39 primary and secondary school science teachers. They found the resource guide useful in assisting them to enhance the students‟ maniplative skills during transition. Further collaboration between primary and secondary school should also be considered in order to bridge the gap during transition...|$|E
