2500|$|The early {{applications}} of CPT mainly determined the soil geotechnical property of bearing capacity. The original cone penetrometers involved simple mechanical {{measurements of the}} total penetration resistance to pushing a tool with a conical tip into the soil. Different methods were employed to separate the total measured resistance into components generated by the conical tip (the [...] "tip friction") and friction generated by the rod string. A friction sleeve was added to quantify this component of the friction and aid in determining soil cohesive strength in the 1960s. Electronic measurements began in 1948 and improved further in the early 1970s. Most modern electronic CPT cones now also employ a pressure transducer with a filter to gather pore water pressure data. The filter is usually located either on the cone tip (the so-called U1 position), immediately behind the cone tip (the most common U2 position) or behind the friction sleeve (U3 position). Pore water pressure data aids determining stratigraphy and is primarily used to correct tip friction values for those effects. CPT testing which also gathers this piezometer data is called CPTU testing. CPT and CPTU testing equipment generally advances the cone using hydraulic rams mounted on either a heavily ballasted vehicle or using <b>screwed-in</b> anchors as a counter-force. One advantage of CPT over the Standard Penetration Test (SPT) is a more continuous profile of soil parameters, with data recorded at intervals typically of 20cm but as small as 1cm.|$|E
5000|$|The H6 engine {{featured}} a straight-six engine inspired by designer Marc Birkigt's work on aircraft engines. [...] It was an all-aluminium engine displacing [...] Apart {{from the new}} overhead camshaft, it was essentially half of Birkigt's aviation V12 design. The seven-bearing crankshaft was milled from a 600 lb steel billet to become a sturdy 35 lb unit, while the block used <b>screwed-in</b> steel liners, and the water passages were enamelled to prevent corrosion.|$|E
50|$|CPT rigs advance {{specialized}} {{testing equipment}} (such as electronic cones), and soil samplers using large hydraulic rams. Most CPT rigs are heavily ballasted (20 metric tons is typical) as a counter force against the pushing {{force of the}} hydraulic rams which are often rated up to 20 kN. Alternatively, small, light CPT rigs and offshore CPT rigs will use anchors such as <b>screwed-in</b> ground anchors to create the reactive force. In ideal conditions, CPT rigs can achieve production rates of up to 250-300 meters per day.|$|E
50|$|An {{internal}} {{focus lens}} (sometimes known as IF) is a photographic lens design in which focus is shifted {{by moving the}} inner lens group or groups only, without any rotation or shifting of the front lens element. This {{makes it easy to}} use, for example, a <b>screwed-in</b> polarizing filter or a petal shaped lens hood. During macro photography, using an internal focus lens reduces the risk of the front of the lens accidentally hitting the subject during focusing as the front element does not move.|$|E
50|$|The Super-Sonic came in 4 colours: Olympic White, Black, Sparkle Silver and Sparkle Blue. All Squier Super-Sonics {{came with}} a white/black/white {{sandwich}} pickguard and 24-inch scale, 22-fret rosewood fretboard and a 'skunk stripe' behind the maple neck. Like the Squier Jagmaster and Jaguar, the body was crafted from basswood in Japan. The guitar {{came with a}} reversed headstock and a Stratocaster-style bridge with hardened steel-pressed saddles and a <b>screwed-in</b> tremolo arm. Kluson-style tuners {{similar to those found}} on many Stratocasters were used on the headstock.|$|E
50|$|Total {{production}} for Firebird models increased to 128,304 units, making this the best-selling {{year of the}} 3rd Generation Firebird. The Firebird's interior options and design remained virtually unchanged for 1984, the only exceptions being a slightly revised dashpad, with <b>screwed-in</b> speaker grilles, an optional driver's knee pad bolster {{on the left side}} of the center console for manual cars, the T-tops were also redesigned to use a pin-mounting arrangement, rather than the earlier latch-based setup, and a new 1 piece horncap embossed with the Firebird logo replaced the earlier medallion version. Base model Firebird production increased to 62,621 units. The S/E Firebirds also remained virtually unchanged as well, with 10,309 units built.|$|E
50|$|The {{engine was}} a four-cylinder in-line petrol unit of 2838 cc {{capacity}} (3.5 in pistons × 4.5 in stroke) designed by Rolls Royce {{and was the}} smallest of the standardised B-Range military engines. These engines had their origin in a 1936 design produced at Derby, with the concept and dimensions first developed for the Rolls-Royce 20 HP of 1922, but with the demands of the war, development was not proceeded with until the late 1940s. The engine was designed with absolute reliability as a prime criterion with fuel economy a secondary consideration, and using British Standard Fine (BSF) thread standards. A feature of this engine was the use of a cast aluminium cylinder head with <b>screwed-in</b> hardened steel valve seats.|$|E
50|$|The AKM’s barrel is {{installed}} in the forward trunnion and pinned (as opposed to the AK-47, which has a one piece receiver with integral trunnions and a barrel that is <b>screwed-in).</b> Additionally the barrel has horizontal guide slots that help align and secure the handguards in place. To increase the weapon’s accuracy during automatic fire, the AKM was fitted with a slant cut muzzle brake that helps redirect expanding propellant gases upward {{and to the right}} during firing, which mitigates the rise of the muzzle during an automatic burst when held by a right-handed firer. The muzzle brake is threaded on {{to the end of the}} barrel with a left-hand thread. Not all AKMs had slant muzzle brakes; some were also fitted with the older muzzle nut which came from the AK-47. Most AKMs with muzzle nuts were older production weapons. The AKM's slant brake can also be used on the AK-47, which had a simple nut to cover the threads.|$|E
50|$|During the Occupation of France and in {{the years}} shortly after World War II, Régnier {{designed}} and produced a set of three simplified four-cylinder inverted air-cooled inline engines of increasing capacity and power, the 4J, 4K and 4L. The specifications of the post-war 4L engine are similar, though not identical to, those of the pre-war R.4, whilst those of the pre-war R.4L specifications are closer {{to that of the}} post-war 4K. In 1946 or 1947, Régnier, now nationalised, was absorbed into SNECMA and the 4L engines, the most widely used member of the series, became the SNECMA-Régnier 4L. Notable constructional features, shared with the 4J and 4K engines, included machined steel cylinder barrels with external baked-on anti-corrosion varnish and separate cylinder heads with unusual metallo-plastic seals, held to the crankcase by long bolts. <b>Screwed-in</b> plug bushes and valve seats were made from aluminium-bronze. The 4L's five-bearing steel crankshaft was forged, as were the duralumin connecting rods which had split, steel backed, bronze bearings. The crankcase was cast from aluminium alloy.|$|E

40|$|The implant is a {{therapeutic}} resource in constant evolution, {{and the different}} types of implants and techniques have been increasingly used in cases of both fully or partially edentulous patients. In some cases they provide more conservative treatment, and in others better stability, retention, and function. To achieve a satisfactory result, there are several factors that should be taken into account: the type and quality of the bone, bone density, the placement location of implants, retrievability of restorations, the patient's motivation, and economic issues. Trainees {{should be aware of the}} limitations of the techniques that can be used for successful prosthetic rehabilitation. This work describes the prosthetic rehabilitation of a fully edentulous mandible treated with dental implants using the 'Toronto Bridge' technique for restoring both function and aesthetics. This type of prosthesis is a <b>screwed-in</b> mesostructure with milled abutments for the cementation of single or multiple suprastructures. This device could also be named 'abutment-hybrid overdenture' The main advantages and disadvantages of this protocol are discussed...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTRe-implantation is a {{procedure}} whereby an accidentally or intentionally fully luxated tooth {{is placed in}} a socket. It is considered a form of tooth transplant. This treatment can adequately function, in certain cases, ankylosis might be present. This process {{can be defined as}} fusion of tooth and alveolar bone. ObjectivePresentation of a re-implanted, ankylosed endodontically treated tooth with root resorption and replacement of this tooth with dental implant. Case presentationA 32 year old female patient was referred to Periodontics and Implantology Department due to bone resorption of tooth number 12. Dental history reported by patient informed that tooth was extracted and intentionally re-implanted after endodontic treatment. After thirteen years the crown fractured, radiographic examination revealed external root resorption and ankylosis. Treatment consisted on guided bone regeneration after extraction and placement of 3 i® implant (3. 5 × 15 mm) with immediate load, the gingival margin was modified by means of gingivoplasty procedure and increase of provisional's crown contour. In order to improve esthetics and morphology of keratinized gingiva, muco-gingival plastic surgery was conducted with rotary instruments. ResultsOne year later, rehabilitation was completed with a <b>screwed-in,</b> fixed porcelain crown...|$|E
40|$|Objective. The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{influence}} of implant–abutment interface (IAI) placement depths on peri-implant tissues in the presence of ligature-induced peri-implant inflammation. Materials and Methods. Two implants with <b>screwed-in</b> IAIs (SI) and two implants with tapped-in IAIs (TI) were inserted in one side of the mandible in six dogs eight weeks after tooth extraction. Four experimental groups were constituted: SI placed crestally, SI placed 1. 5 mm subcrestally, TI placed crestally and TI placed 1. 5 mm subcrestally. After 12 weeks, the healing abutments were connected. Four weeks later, cotton floss ligatures were placed around the abutments to promote plaque accumulation. Clinical and radiographic examinations were performed at 0, 6 and 12 weeks after ligature placement. The effects of the IAI placement depths on clinical and radiographic parameters were assessed. Results. The alterations of peri-implant probing depths, clinical attachment levels, distances from the IAI to the first bone-implant contact (IAI-fBIC) and depths of infrabony defect were significant larger in the subcrestal groups compared with the crestal groups during the plaque accumulation period. The alterations of clinical attachment levels, IAI-fBIC, depth of the infrabony defect and horizontal bone loss were not significantly different between the SI and TI groups after ligature placement. Conclusion. Tissue destruction in subcrestal implants may be more serious than that in crestal implants in the presence of inflamed peri-implant mucosa...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} abutment taper angles on the fracture strength of dental implants with TIS (taper integrated <b>screwed-in)</b> connection. Thirty prototype cylindrical titanium alloy 5. 0 mm-diameter dental implants with different TIS-connection designs were divided into six groups and tested for their fracture strength, using a universal testing machine. These groups consisted of combinations of 3. 5 and 4. 0 mm abutment diameter, each with taper angles of 6 °, 8 ° or 10 °. 3 -Dimensional finite element analysis (FEA) was also used to analyze stress states at implant-abutment connection areas. In general, the mechanical tests found an increasing trend of implant fracture forces as the taper angle enlarged. When the abutment diameter was 3. 5 mm, the mean fracture forces for 8 ° and 10 ° taper groups were 1638. 9 N± 20. 3 and 1577. 1 N± 103. 2, respectively, both larger than that for the 6 ° taper group of 1475. 0 N± 24. 4, with the largest increasing rate of 11. 1 %. Furthermore, the difference between 8 ° and 6 ° taper groups was significant, based on Tamhane's multiple comparison test (P< 0. 05). In 4. 0 mm-diameter abutment groups, as the taper angle was enlarged from 6 ° to 8 ° and 10 °, the mean fracture value was increased from 1066. 7 N± 56. 1 to 1241. 4 N± 6. 4 and 1419. 3 N± 20. 0, with the largest increasing rate of 33. 1 %, and the differences among the three groups were significant (P< 0. 05). The FEA results showed that stress values varied in implants with different abutment taper angles and supported {{the findings of the}} static tests. In conclusion, increases of the abutment taper angle could significantly increase implant fracture resistance in most cases established in the study, which is due to the increased implant wall thickness in the connection part resulting from the taper angle enlargement. The increasing effects were notable when a thin implant wall was present to accommodate wide abutments...|$|E
