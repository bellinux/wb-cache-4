40|$|The {{dimensions}} of the container affect both the production cost {{and the quality of}} seedlings of forest species, and the pattern of response of these depends on the specificity of the species. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>containers</b> on the initial growth of forest species Mezilaurus itauba Taub. ex Mez and Platymiscium ulei Harms. Two experiments were conducted concomitantly in nursery conditions, using the completely randomized design with five replicates. The treatments comprised of six sizes of containers: 20 cm x 15 cm (T 1), 20 cm x 20 cm (T 2), 23 cm x 20 cm (T 3), 25 cm x 20 cm (T 4), 30 cm x 20 cm (T 5) and 33 cm x 23 cm (T 6). After 90 days of growth, the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>containers</b> affects differently the quality of the seedlings of both the species. The size of container 25 x 20 cm is more appropriate for the cultivation of macacaúba species while the best response to itaúba was obtained for the container 33 x 23 cm. On the other hand, the containers 20 x 15 cm and 20 x 20 cm should not be used for any of the tested species...|$|E

The standardized <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>containers</b> (in 20  ft. and 40  ft. equivalent units) makes them a suitable means for transporting {{all kinds of}} products, ranging from multimedia and building materials to clothing and shoes. Even temperature-sensitive goods like flowers, fruits, and vegetables can be transported easily by temperature-controlled containers, known as reefers. The share of containerized transport in seaborne trade increased from 2.75 % in 1980 to 15 % in 2014 (UNCTAD 2015.), and total seaborne trade increased to 9842 million tons (UNCTAD 2015). The annual worldwide transport of containers increased from 28.7 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU) in 1990 to 171 million TEU in 2014  (UNCTAD 2015) The 20 -year average growth percentage of the container market is a remarkable 7.8 % (Clarksons 2015; Port of Rotterdam 2015).|$|E

40|$|Our {{research}} {{focuses on}} developing techniques to rear ladybird beetles (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae). We evaluated the effects of rearing density on survival, growth, and development of Coleomegilla maculata. The hypothesis that a low to moderate rearing density has limited or no effects on survival and development was tested. C. maculata first instars were reared to pupae at a density of 1, 5, 10, 15, or 20 individuals per arena (2. 5 cm high, 9. 0 cm diameter, and 159 cm 3 volume) and fed powdered brine shrimp (Artemia franciscana) eggs. More larvae survived at the 1 and 5 densities, but no differences were detected between the 10, 15, or 20 densities. Median survival rate was at least 90 % for larvae and 100 % for pupae at the 10, 15, and 20 densities. Development time, body weight, and sex ratio were unaffected by rearing density. Overall, {{this study suggests that}} C. maculata larvae can be reared successfully at a density of 20 larvae/ 159 cm 3 (≈ 0. 126 larvae/cm 3) in containers provisioned with powdered A. franciscana eggs. Scaling-up the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>containers,</b> and C. maculata density in these containers, should be possible...|$|E

40|$|Cupuacüu (Theobroma grandiflorum) is an Amazonian {{tropical}} fruit {{with a great}} economic potential. Pasteurization, by a hot-filling technique, was suggested {{for the preservation of}} this fruit pulp at room temperature. The process was implemented with local communities in Brazil. The process was modeled, and a computer program was written in Turbo Pascal. The relative importance among the pasteurization process variables (initial product temperature, heating rate, holding temperature and time, container volume and shape, cooling medium type and temperature) on the microbial target and quality was investigated, by performing simulations according to a screening factorial design. Afterward, simulations of the different processing conditions were carried out. The holding temperature (TF) and time (thold) affected pasteurization value (P), and the container volume (V) influenced largely the quality parameters. The process was optimized for retail (1 L) and industrial (100 L) size containers, by maximizing volume average quality in terms of color lightness and sensory “fresh notes” and minimizing volume average total color difference and sensory “cooked notes”. Equivalent processes were designed and simulated (P 91 °C) 4. 6 min on Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris spores) and final quality (color, flavor, and aroma attributes) was evaluated. Color was slightly affected by the pasteurization processes, and few differences were observed between the six equivalent treatments designed (TF between 80 and 97 °C). TF g 91 °C minimized “cooked notes ” and maximized “fresh notes ” of cupuacüu pulp aroma and flavor for 1 L container. Concerning the 100 L size, the “cooked notes ” development can be minimized with TF g 91 °C, but overall the quality was greatly degraded {{as a result of the}} long cooling times. A more efficient method to speed up the cooling phase was recommended, especially for the industrial <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>containers...</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a two-dimensional {{model of a}} porous medium where circular grains are uniformly distributed in a squared container. We assume that such medium is partially filled with water and that the stationary interface separating the water phase from the air phase is described by the balance of capillarity and gravity. Taking the unity as the average distance between grains, we identify four asymptotic regimes that depend on the Bond number and the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> the <b>container.</b> We analyse, in probabilistic terms, the possible global interfaces that can form {{in each of these}} regimes. In summary, we show that in the regimes where gravity dominates the probability of configurations of grains allowing solutions close to the horizontal solution is close to one. Moreover, in such regimes where the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> the <b>container</b> is sufficiently large we can describe deviations from the horizontal in probabilistic terms. On the other hand, when capillarity dominates while the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> the <b>container</b> is sufficiently large, we find that the probability of finding interfaces close to the graph of a given smooth curve without self-intersections is close to one.
