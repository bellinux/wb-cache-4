500|$|The main plot of [...] "Seahorse Seashell Party" [...] was panned by critics. Kevin McFarland of The A.V.

[...] He resumed: [...] "Nobody cares about {{any member of the}} Griffin family the way we care about every last Simpson. I feel bad about Meg becoming the scapegoat. Not because she’s a good character, but because instead of tweaking and working to make her appreciated or comically valuable, Family Guy spent years going down {{the path of least resistance}} and simply joined the fan chorus of hatred. One episode of pointed, forced justification for that shift doesn’t change a thing." [...] McFarland concluded his review by giving the episode a grade of D+. Similarly, Terron Moore of Ology felt that much of the episode was wasted. In his review, Moore stated that [...] "Seahorse Seashell Party" [...] was [...] "an episode that <b>spends</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of time addressing something that didn’t need to be addressed." [...] He gave the episode a 4.5 out of ten points. TV Fanatic Kate Moon was less negative of the episode, stating that even though Meg confronting her family in regards to her treatment was long overdue, she concluded that it felt contrived and uninteresting.|$|E
