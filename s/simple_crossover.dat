40|$|It is {{believed}} that the semi-Poisson function P(S) = 4 S(- 2 S) describes the normalized distribution of the nearest level-spacings S for critical energy levels at the Anderson metal-insulator transition from quantum chaos to integrability, after an average over four obvious boundary conditions (BC) is taken (Braun et al 1). In order to check whether the semi-Poisson is the correct universal distribution at criticality we numerically compute it by integrating over all possible boundary conditions. We find that although P(S) describes very well {{the main part of}} the obtained critical distribution small differences exist particularly in the large S tail.

50|$|There {{are several}} {{theories}} on how mitotic crossover occurs. In the <b>simple</b> <b>crossover</b> model, the two homologous chromosomes overlap {{on or near}} a common Chromosomal fragile site (CFS). This leads to a double-strand break, which is then repaired {{using one of the}} two strands. This can lead to the two chromatids switching places. In another model, two overlapping sister chromosomes form a double Holliday junction at a common repeat site and are later sheared {{in such a way that}} they switch places. In either model, the chromosomes are not guaranteed to trade evenly, or even to rejoin on opposite sides thus most patterns of cleavage do not result in any crossover event. Uneven trading introduces many of the deleterious effects of mitotic crossover.|$|E

The station survived the Second World War largely undamaged, only suffering from low-flying strafing, which caused little damage. After the war, the second track of the railway was dismantled for reparations and many rail connections within the station became superfluous and were dismantled. The traffic to Roßbach, which was interrupted {{at the end of}} the Second World War, was not resumed, and the route to Roßbach between 1946 and 1951 was also dismantled. The second track of the Plauen-Cheb line was not rebuilt until 1979. [...] In 1990, the station consisted of 54 sets of points, two <b>simple</b> <b>crossovers</b> and a crossing loop.

Performance of the proposed crossover operator is compared with four other commonly used operators. The proposed GA optimizationbased process synthesis method is applied to generate the optimum {{process flowsheet}} for a multicomponent membrane-based CO 2 capture process. Within defined constraints and using the random-point crossover, CO 2 purity of 0. 827 (equivalent to 0. 986 on dry basis) is achieved which results in improvement (3. 4 %) over the <b>simplest</b> <b>crossover</b> operator applied. In addition, the least variability in the converged flowsheet and CO 2 purity is observed for random-point crossover operator, which approximately implies closeness of {{the solution to the}} global optimum, and hence the consistency of the algorithm.

40|$|Recently, {{studies with}} the XCS {{classifier}} system on Boolean functions {{have shown that}} in certain types of functions <b>simple</b> <b>crossover</b> operators can lead to disruption and, consequently, a more effective recombination mechanism is required. <b>Simple</b> <b>crossover</b> operators were replaced by recombination based on estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). The combination showed that XCS with such a statistics-based crossover operator can solve challenging hierarchical functions more efficiently. This study elaborates the gained competence further investigating the coding scheme for the EDA component (BOA in our case) of XCS as well as performance in randomly generated Boolean function problems. Results in hierarchical Boolean functions show that the originally used 2 -bit coding scheme induces a certain learning bias that stresses additional diversity in the evolving XCS population. A 1 -bit coding scheme {{as well as a}} restricted 2 -bit coding scheme confirm the suspected bias. The alternative encodings decrease the unnecessary bias towards specificity and increase performance robustness.

As we vary the magnetic flux, we discover an intermediate twilight regime where perturbative and semiclassical features co-exist.

40|$|The {{specification}} of neural net architectures by genetic algorithm {{is thought to}} be hampered by difficulties with crossover. This is the "permutation" or "competing conventions" problem: similar nets may have the hidden units defined in different orders so that they have very dissimilar genetic strings, preventing successful recombination of building blocks. Previous empirical tests of a number of recombination operators using a simulated net-building task indicated the superiority of one that sorts hidden unit definitions by overlap prior to crossover. However, <b>simple</b> <b>crossover</b> also fared well, suggesting that the permutation problem is not serious in practice. This is supported by an observed reduction in performance when the permutation problem is removed.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{a line of}} research in genetic algorithms (GAs), called building-block identification. The building blocks (BBs) are common structures inferred from a set of solutions. In <b>simple</b> GA, <b>crossover</b> operator {{plays an important role}} in mixing BBs. However, the crossover probably disrupts the BBs because the cut point is chosen at random. Therefore the BBs need to be identified explicitly so that the solutions are efficiently mixed. We propose an approach for identifying BBs. The approach is based on an observation of the compact GA. We observe that the vector elements that correspond to the bits in the same BB are simultaneously updated with a high probability. We formulate the observation to the simultaneity matrix – an ℓ×ℓ matrix of numbers constructed from a set of ℓ-bit solutions. The matrix element in row i and column j is denoted by mij. The larger the mij is, the higher the dependency is between bit i and bit j. If mij is high, bit i and bit j should be passed together to prevent BB disruption. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{report and}} analyze {{low-temperature}} {{measurements of the}} conductance of partially disordered reduced graphene oxide, finding that the data follow a <b>simple</b> <b>crossover</b> scenario. At room temperature, conductance is dominated by two-dimensional (2 D) electric field-assisted, thermally-driven (Pollak-Riess) variable-range hopping (VRH) through highly-disordered regions. However, at lower temperatures T, we find a smooth crossover to follow the exp(-E_ 0 /E) ^(1 / 3) field-driven (Shklovskii) 2 D VRH conductance behaviour when the electric field E exceeds a specific crossover value E_C (T) _ 2 D = (E_a E_ 0 ^(1 / 3) / 3) ^(3 / 4) determined by the scale factors E_ 0 and E_a for the high-field and intermediate field regimes respectively.

In particular we compare this approach which relies on the two-dimensional nature of the superconductivity to the often used $T$-matrix approach. Starting from simple pairing Hamiltonians we present a broad pedagogical introduction to the BCS-Bose crossover problem. The finite temperature extension of these models naturally leads to a discussion of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless superconducting transition and the related phase diagram including the effects of quantum phase fluctuations and impurities. We stress the differences between <b>simple</b> Bose-BCS <b>crossover</b> theories and the current approach where one can have a large pseudogap region even at high carrier density where the Fermi surface is well-defined. The Green's function and its associated spectral function, which explicitly show non-Fermi liquid behaviour, is constructed in the presence of vortices.
