40|$|In {{the present}} work, {{we report on}} the biofunctionalisation of silanised Ti-surfaces with gelatin. In recent years, a large number of papers have been {{published}} about the <b>silanisation</b> of different substrates including Ti-surfaces for biomedical applications. However, a comparative study evaluating the effects of different pre-treatment methods (cleaning and/or oxidation) and the efficiency of different <b>silanisation</b> reactions has to our information not yet been published. Since a clean and reproducible surface is required for studying structure-property relations, all Ti-surfaces were subjected to a three step procedure including a cleaning step, an oxidation step and a <b>silanisation</b> step. XPS analysis and contact angle measurements revealed that the pre-treatment of the Ti samples (cleaning + oxidation) had a drastic effect both on the surface composition and its wettability. A detailed study on the effect of different <b>silanisation</b> parameters indicated that the siloxane concentration, the siloxane type, the solvent and a catalyst affect the coupling efficiency of siloxanes to Ti-surfaces. Stability studies revealed a dependency between the siloxane type and the stability of the siloxane coating against hydrolytic cleavage from a Ti-surface. Since Ti-surfaces modified with a methacrylate containing silane possessed the highest hydrolytic stability, these surfaces were selected for the subsequent immobilisation of methacrylamide-modified gelatin via high energy irradiation induced cross-linking. The present work clearly demonstrates the need of a proper reaction strategy for immobilising ligands on Ti-surfaces. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|E

In recent years, the application of silanes in aluminium bonding process has been extensively investigated. Silane surface treatment is a more environment-friendly alternative than other treatments, which use toxic chemicals (hexavalent chromium compounds, strong acids, etc.), such as FPL (Forest Products Laboratory) etch, CAA (chromic acid anodisation) or PAA (phosphoric acid anodisation). The aim of this work was to optimize the ?-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane application process to obtain the best durability in toughened acrylic bonded aluminium joints.

40|$|In {{order to}} get {{approval}} of adhesive bonding as a reliable joining method in the automotive industry, {{a better understanding of}} the interfacial interactions between aluminium surfaces and adhesives is important. It is also important to get {{a better understanding of the}} degradation mechanisms of the bonded systems in humid environments, as humidity is known to have a detrimental effect. This work has been focused on an aluminium alloy and a one-component epoxy adhesive that are of particular interest to the automotive industry. Pretreatment of the aluminium substrates before adhesive bonding is essential. However, the most successful pretreatment processes involve the use of hexavalent chromium, which will be banned from use within few years due to environmental considerations. Alternative pretreatments need to be developed. A literature study identified <b>silanisation</b> with GPS as a pretreatment method with the potential to obtain good durability. On the basis of research performed by SINTEF Materials Technology, AC anodising in hot phosphoric and sulphuric acid solutions were also identified as interesting pretreatment methods. A modified version of the Boeing wedge test was used to determine the durability of adhesively bonded joints tested in hydrothermal environments. The joints were made of AA 6060 -T 6 aluminium alloy and Betamate XD 4600 epoxy adhesive. Both silane films and anodic oxides were investigated using reflection-absorption FT-IR spectroscopy. Other techniques of surface analysis were also used (SEM, TEM, WLI, XPS, ToF-SIMS and contact angle measurements). The environmental durability of pretreated AA 6060 -T 6 substrates was significantly improved after <b>silanisation</b> with GPS. The grit-blasting + GPS pretreatment process resulted in considerable higher durability then the chromic-sulphuric acid FPL-etch. The general understanding is that <b>silanisation</b> improves the durability through the formation of strong, covalent bonds between the aluminium surface and the adhesive. FT-IR spectroscopy strongly indicated that a chemical reaction took place between GPS films and amine curing agents. Particularly interesting was the reaction with dicyandiamide, which is a common curing agent in one-component epoxy adhesives. The amines also catalysed the condensation of SiOH groups, resulting in higher degree of SiOSi crosslink density in the siloxane films. However, chemical reaction is not necessary for improved durability. The hydrophobicity of the bonded surface is also an important factor. This effect has not been studies extensively earlier. Exposure of GPS films to degrading environments showed that the silane desorbed from the surface in acidic solutions, but it was stable in alkaline solutions. The durability of adhesive joints was also reduced in acidic environments. The two models for the degradation of the silanised aluminium surface in acidic environments were proposed: hydrolysis of the siloxane network and corrosion of the underlying aluminium surface. The environmental durability of substrates that were AC anodised in hot phosphoric and sulphuric acid solutions was good, almost as good as the well-established FPL + PAA pretreatment. DC anodising in sulphuric acid gave inferior durability. FT-IR spectroscopy showed that the anodic films formed in sulphuric acid contained significant amounts of sulphate. This can have a significant negative effect on the long-term properties of bonded joints. The anodic films released water during curing of the adhesive. The observations suggested that a transformation from the hydroxide to the oxide state took place. Adhesive bonding in wet environment of substrates that were anodised in sulphuric acid had a negative effect on durability. The effect was more pronounced for DC anodised, than for AC anodised substrates. Bonding in wet environment also resulted in changed adhesive properties close to the oxide surface. Very little thixotropic agent was present in a ~ 200 nm wide region in the adhesive. This was explained by desorption of water from the oxide during curing of the adhesive. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E

The FT 4 powder rheometer of Freeman Technology, developed {{over the last two}} decades, has provided a clearer differentiation of powder flowability in some instances.

The DEM analysis underestimates the flow energy measured experimentally, although the agreement is improved when sliding friction is increased. The shear stress of the powder in front of the blade is shown to be roughly constant along the radial direction and increasing as the impeller penetrates the bed, suggesting that a characteristic shear stress can be determined for a powder under a given test condition in the FT 4.

The {{prospect of the}} regeneration of the membranes through an acidic process was also examined and discussed. The UF/NF membranes were functionalised with alginates to develop hybrid inorganic/organic materials for continuous, single pass, wastewater treatment applications. The challenge laid in the induction of additional metal adsorption and improved regeneration capacity. This was accomplished by stabilizing alginates either into the pores or on the top-separating layer of the membrane. The preservation of efficient water fluxes at moderate trans-membrane pressures introduced an additional parameter that was pursued in parallel to the membrane modification process.

The successful immobilisation of the gelatin coating was made possible by a polydopamine interlayer, a polymer coating inspired by the adhesive nature of mussels. The presence of both coatings was first optimised on two dimensional titanium (2 D Ti) substrates and confirmed by different techniques including X-ray photelectron spectroscopy, contact angle measurements, atomic force microscopy and fluorescence microscopy. Results showed homogeneous coatings that are stable for at least 24 h in phosphate buffer at 37 °C. In a next step, the coating procedure was successfully transferred to 3 D Ti 6 Al 4 V porous implants, which indicates the versatility of the applied coating procedure with regard to complex surface morphologies. Furthermore, the bio-activity of these stable gelatin coatings was enhanced by applying a third and final coating using the cell-attractive protein fibronectin.

40|$|The {{leaching}} of Ti {{from the}} redox molecular sieve TS- 1 when {{used as a}} catalyst for the oxidation of crotyl alcohol with hydrogen peroxide is described and discussed. The crystallisation time of the TS- 1 is found to be the critical preparation parameter. TS- 1 prepared using a 2 day crystallisation period leaches Ti, whereas TS- 1 prepared using a 10 day crystallisation period is inert to leaching. <b>Silanisation</b> of the external surface of the 2 day preparation effectively stops the leaching of Ti, without significantly affecting the catalytic performance. Similarly, treatment of the 2 day TS- 1 with sodium azide also minimises leaching of Ti but with a reduction in catalytic activity. The Ti leaching is shown to be caused by the reaction of a triol with TS- 1 in the presence of hydrogen peroxide {{from the surface of the}} 2 day TS- 1. A possible mechanism is proposed in which the triol by-product chelates the Ti, thereby breaking Ti-O-Si framework bonds and causing leaching to form a Ti species in solution. The reactivity of this Ti species in solution is modelled using the reaction of crotyl alcohol with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of titanyl acetylacetonate, and it is found that this effectively catalyses the formation of triol.

In this investigation, titanium was coated with hydroxylated silica by plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) to increase the surface hydrophilicity and generate reactive surface silanol groups. Subsequently, the silica-coated titanium surface was further modified through <b>silanisation</b> to generate surfaces bearing different reactive chemical functionalities consisting of aldehydes, epoxides and isocyanates, which can react with the amino groups of proteins and growth factors. 2, 2, 2 -trifluoroethylamine (FEAM) was reacted on these surfaces to determine the coupling efficiency of the different surface chemical functionalities. The amino group of FEAM can react with an amino-reactive surface functional group to form a surface terminated with 3 fluorine atoms per FEAM molecule that can be detected by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. By analysing the techniques used for protein attachment with the FEAM model molecule, a successful method for isocyanate/amine coupling was found and later adapted for tethering IGF- 1 molecules to the functionalised PECVD silica-coated titanium surface.

In this study, Si/SiO 2 substrates were functionalised using self-assembled monolayers of three different aminosilanes with various numbers of amine groups and molecular lengths as underlayers for enhancing the adherence of the molybdenum precursor. The tetrahedral [MoS 4](2 -) anion groups from the molybdenum precursor were bonded on these silanised Si/SiO 2 substrates afterwards. The substrates were then treated with a combined thermolysis and sulphurisation step. The results showed that <b>silanisation</b> of the substrates using the longest chains and {{the largest number of}} amine groups provided a good foundation to grow quasi 2 D MoS 2 made from adjacent flakes in a mosaic formation.

The {{focus of this}} project was consideration of fundamental aspects of surface nanometer-scale patterning and protein-surface interactions {{with the aim of}} preparing an ordered array of surface protein. This was in part achieved {{during the course of the}} work. An equilibrium dialysis method was validated for the measurement of ligand-protein binding parameters. Human serum albumin (HSA) and ethacrynic acid (ETH) were chosen as the ligand-protein pair to be surface-immobilised. Molecular modelling suggested a good fit for ethacrynic acid in the covalent HSA binding 'cleft', however, the covalent HSA-ETH complex was not successfully isolated. A derivative of the ligand, ETH-glycine, was synthesised to a very high purity but a low yield. A gas-phase <b>silanisation</b> method was developed to deposit functional aminopropyletriethoxysilane (APS) groups onto silicon wafer surfaces. The dispersion of APS could not be sufficiently controlled, by changing the evaporative distance or the APS evaporation concentration, and hence it was not possible to bring about gold nanoparticle (AuNP) patterning at the nanometer scale using this approach. However AuNP patterning could be achieved by incubating APS monolayer surfaces with different dilutions of a commercially available AuNP solution. Subsequent development of a protein imprinting strategy would require that non-specifically adsorbed HSA can be removed from PNA silicon surfaces. This was found to be difficult to achieve using mild conditions. Controlled gas-phase deposition of APS could not be used to directly facilitate dispersed ligand attachment.

40|$|Assessment {{of public}} health risk due to {{waterborne}} disease is delayed by the inability to rapidly isolate microorganisms from water for their detection. Australian Escott natural zeolites (natural zeolitized tuffs - NZs), modified by either a <b>silanisation</b> (SZ) or surfactant modification (SMZ) procedure were investigated to rapidly isolate Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis and bacteriophage MS 2 from water. It was hypothesised that microorganisms would bind to the NZ’s added as a powder with particle size < 75 μm to water, be separated by sedimentation and detected by culture or molecular-based assays. Binding to the NZ’s was fast (within 10 minutes) and the NZ-microorganism complex was easily separated by sedimentation. However, microorganism isolation varied in different water chemistries and with different chemical modification of NZ surfaces. Isolation by SMZ, which had been described previously, was achieved at low levels (less than 10 %) presumably because chemical inactivation prevented microorganism detection. For SZ, more than 60 % of bacteria and 30 % of MS 2 bacteriophage (seeded at 103 cfu or pfu/ml) were isolated and detected after agitation in various solutions and in rainwater, bottled water and seawater. Selective isolation of E. faecalis was also enhanced using a novel phage endolysin recombinant protein attached to SZ, increasing isolation to greater than 85 %. Furthermore, pyrosequencing analysis revealed that SZ isolated the most representative population of environmental bacteria from rainwater compared to SMZ and NZ. The process of isolation to detection was completed within three hours and did not require electricity, making NZ-isolation practical for field-based applications. The main drawback was lack of sensitivity as consistent isolation of very low numbers of microorganisms in water (< 102 cfu or pfu/ml) was not achieved. Nonetheless the isolation of live bacteria and viruses by SZ is a novel approach and could potentially be used in combination with molecular-based assays to detect waterborne pathogens...|$|E
40|$|An {{evaluation}} of DNA extraction and amplification performed in microfluidic systems was carried out, {{with the aim}} of integrating the two processes in a single microfluidic device. This integrated device will then be incorporated upstream of capillary gel electrophoresis and fluorescence-based detection for development of a completely integrated genetic analysis system. DNA extraction was performed using a silica substrate with both hydrodynamic and electro-osmotic pumping (EOP), resulting in maximum DNA extraction efficiencies of 82 % and 52 % respectively under optimised conditions. While the DNA extraction efficiency was lower using EOP, this method eliminates the need for external pumps and ensures easier mechanical connection to the microfluidic device. The use of thermally activated silica monoliths as the solid-phase resulted in superior DNA extraction efficiencies compared to when photo-initiated monoliths and silica beads were used. DNA amplification of up to nine forensically relevant loci was successfully achieved on the microfluidic device in volumes as low as 1. 1 microlitres using Peltier heating. A combination of <b>silanisation</b> and dynamic passivation was required to prevent PCR inhibition resulting from DNA polymerase adsorption. A custom-built microwave heating system was also evaluated, which was capable of heating and cooling rates of 65 degC/second and 58 degC/second, respectively. EOP was used in the generation of an integrated microfluidic device, for DNA extraction and amplification. The silica monolith used as the solid-phase for DNA extraction also acted as a pump for electrokinetic movement. All necessary reagents for carrying out both DNA extraction and amplification were encapsulated in agarose gel and pre-loaded onto the microfluidic device creating a self-contained, ready-to-use system. Following addition of the biological sample to the microfluidic device, all electrokinetic movement and thermal cycling was controlled using a custom-built operating system.

40|$|In cell populations {{there is}} a great deal of heterogeneity. Cells can be seen to react {{different}} to the same stimulus despite being the same cell type and under the same conditions. Single cell analysis of a population is, therefore, crucial to understanding the nature of these differences. Using different technologies to study a single cell can help a researcher gather more data on the nature of these differences. The first part of this study looked at the development of a microwell array as a technique to allow correlative microscopy of non-adherent cell types. Laser ablation was used to generate microwells in both glass and the silicone polymer, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Different methods were tested to increase quality of the microwells with the use of a sacrificial layer proving successful. Microwells were determined to be suitable for both live cell imaging and scanning electron microscopy imaging with correlative microscopy of non-adherent cells demonstrated. A new microwell design to allow the tracking of a single well through different imaging steps including sectioning was devised. Surface modification was required to make PDMS more cytophilic and different methods were investigated in the next part of this thesis. More cytocompatible surfaces were produced for PDMS using <b>silanisation</b> of the surface to produce amine moieties proved the most successful. In the final part of the thesis the cell penetrating peptide (CPP) octaargine was investigated along with the pro-apoptotic peptides PAD and the Bcl- 2 converter peptide. The blebbing effects of the two peptides were analysed using non-adherent cells in microwells and fixed cells on a normal surface. Apoptosis as means of cell death by these peptides was disputed and the necrotic blebbing caused by theses peptides investigated. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Surface {{chemical}} modifications {{are presented}} for supporting primary neurons in culture. The initial substrates for culture were glass and gold. The surface modifications {{were based on}} self assembled monolayer (SAM) approaches. Glass surfaces were initially modified by <b>silanisation</b> with either 3 -aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS) or 3 -aminopropyldimethylethoxysilane (APDES), to present amino-terminated surfaces. Gold surfaces were initially modified by thiol SAMs of either 11 -amino- 1 -undecanethiol (AUT) or a peptide fragment of laminin (PA 22 - 2), to present an amino- or peptide-terminated surface respectively. The amine-terminated surfaces of both glass and gold were subject to further modification. A heterobifunctional linker, containing a polyethylene glycol (PEG) spacer, was used to couple the peptide PA 22 - 2 to the amino-terminated surfaces. Surface modifications were characterised using WCA, XPS and ToF-SIMS. The heterobifunctional linker bound homogeneously across the AUT SAM surface, however the linker was not distributed evenly on either of the amino silanisations of glass. Primary neurons from dissociated embryonic rat hippocampi were cultured on the modified glass and gold surfaces. The cell viability was measured during a 3 week long culture using calcein and ethidium homodimer fluorescence. Neuronal cell cultures were viable on all the gold surface modifications. The only viable glass surface was a control surface of adsorbed poly-l-lysine (PLL) on glass. Cell viability on the AUT and the Peptide-PEG-AUT modified gold surfaces was equivalent to the PLL coated glass. Inclusion of the PEG linker reduced protein adsorption from the media to the peptide modified gold surface, allowing cells to recognise the peptide rather than an adsorbed protein layer and improving their viability. The presented gold surface modifications provide suitable substrates for neural cultures {{which can be used}} in existing applications for investigating neural activity, such as; multi-electrode arrays, micro-fluidics devices, and surface plasmon resonance...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Chemical bonding of {{the drug}} onto {{surfaces}} by means of spacer molecules is accompanied with a reduction of the biological activity {{of the drug}} due to a constricted mobility since normally only short spacer molecule like aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APMS) are used for drug coupling. This work aimed to study covalent attachment of heparin to titanium(oxide) surfaces by varying {{the length of the}} silane coupling agent, which should affect the biological potency of the drug due to a higher mobility with longer spacer chains. Methods Covalent attachment of heparin to titanium metal and TiO 2 powder was carried out using the coupling agents 3 -(Trimethoxysilyl) -propylamine (APMS), N - [3 -(Trimethoxysilyl) propyl]ethylenediamine (Diamino-APMS) and N 1 - [3 -(Trimethoxy-silyl) -propyl]diethylenetriamine (Triamino-APMS). The amount of bound coupling agent and heparin was quantified photometrically by the ninhydrin reaction and the tolidine-blue test. The biological potency of heparin was determined photometrically by the chromogenic substrate Chromozym TH and fibrinogen adsorption to the modified surfaces was researched using the QCM-D (Quartz Crystal Microbalance with Dissipation Monitoring) technique. Results Zeta-potential measurements confirmed the successful coupling reaction; the potential of the unmodified anatase surface (approx. - 26 mV) shifted into the positive range (> + 40 mV) after <b>silanisation.</b> Binding of heparin results in a strongly negatively charged surface with zeta-potentials of approx. - 39 mV. The retaining biological activity of heparin was highest for the spacer molecule Triamino-APMS. QCM-D measurements showed a lower viscosity for adsorbed fibrinogen films on heparinised surfaces by means of Triamino-APMS. Conclusion The remaining activity of heparin was found to be highest for the covalent attachment with Triamino-APMS as coupling agent due to the long chain of this spacer molecule and therefore the highest mobility of the drug. Furthermore, the adsorption of fibrinogen on the differently heparinised surfaces in real time demonstrated that with longer spacer chains the ΔD/Δf ratios became higher, which is also associated with better biocompatible properties of the substrates in contact with a biosystem. </p...|$|E
40|$|Monolithic microcolumns and {{especially}} silica monoliths are showing several advantages compared to classical particle packed and organic polymeric monolithic columns: ease {{of production and}} functionalisation, excellent mechanical and thermal stability. Morphology of the monolithic columns can easily be tuned by simply changing the compositions of reaction mixtures. High porosity and interconnected flow-through pores ensure low back pressures at higher flow rates so increasing reaction speeds. High salt resistance allows use water based buffer solutions without any swelling of the stationary phase, large biomolecules can be utilised and conditions to prevent denaturation and comformation changes of these biomolecules can be maintained. Introduction of gold nano-particles on the surfaces of silica monoliths allows increase of the surface areas and alows creation of new, exotic surfaces. Gold shows strong affinity towards thiol groups, {{which can be found}} in different biomolecules so utilisation of this phenomena would allow production of micro-reactors and bioreactors in order to mimic biological reactions happening in living organisms and large biological systems. Silica monoliths were synthesised using classical sol-gel process. In order to immobilise gold nano-particles, surfaces of the silica monoliths were amminated using standard <b>silanisation</b> reaction with 3 -aminopropyl-methyl-diethoxysilane. 20 nm citrate stabilised gold nano-particles were immobilised on the surfaces afterwards. Depending on the desired application, gold nano-oparticle modified silica monoliths were functionalised afterwards. Immobilisation of ionic species such as amino acids and small peptides would allow creation of stationary phase for ion chromatography, retention of enzymes and other biologically active molecules would allow to create micro-reactors. Leaving gold nano-particles unmodified would make ideal stationary phase for micro-extraction. These modified monoliths were characterised using microscopy techniques, such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and field emission SEM. They were used to characterise morphology of the monoliths as well as to evaluate the coverage of the surface with gold nano-particles. The fabricated stationary phases were used for selected biological and chromatographic applications (incorporanting classical chromatographic techniques in order to evaluate the performance of these new modified monolithic materials) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} core and {{core-shell}} nanoparticles with superparamagnetic properties were synthesised and surface functionalised using three different amino-silanes by a chemical conjugation method. The functionalised nanoparticles were characterised and further modified by chemical conjugation with two different classes of bio-molecules; (i) enzymes and (ii) single stranded DNA primers. The resultant nanoparticles (nano-bio conjugates) {{were used for}} applications in (i) enzyme catalysis and (ii) bio-separation / bio-sensing. Magnetite and amorphous silica-coated core-shell nanoparticles were synthesised on both small (5 g) and large (20 g) scales and were characterised using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area measurement and vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM). Silica-coated core-shell nanoparticles were functionalised by <b>silanisation</b> with three different aminosilanes [3 -aminopropyl tri-ethoxysilane (APTS), 3 -aminopropyl di-ethoxymethylsilane (APDS) and 3 -aminopropyl mono-ethoxydimethylsilane (APMS) ] and two different methods: water (classical method) or a Tri-phasic Reverse Emulsion (TPRE) using toluene and a surfactant (Triton X- 100). It was observed that the materials prepared using the TPRE method produced higher surface amine density values on average. The first application involved bio-catalysis where lipases [Pseudomonas Fluorescens lipase (PFL) and Candida Rugosa lipase (CRL) ] were chemically conjugated (covalently linked) via glutaraldehyde-modification onto the amino-functionalised nanoparticles for applications such as: (i) hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl palmitate to produce palmitic acid and p-nitrophenol (model reaction), (ii) transesterification of ethyl butyrate with n-butanol to produce butyl butyrate and (iii) partial and selective hydrolysis of cis- 3, 5 -diacetoxy- 1 -cyclopentene to produce pharmaceutically important and expensive chiral intermediate molecules. Various reaction parameters such as (a) water concentration in a bi-phasic solvent mixture and (b) temperature were investigated to determine the optimum conditions. All reactions were carried out using free lipases and the physically adsorbed lipases in order to compare the performance with chemically conjugated nano-biomaterials. It was observed from the bio-catalytic reaction (i) that the conversion values given by lipase-immobilised materials were comparable to those given by free lipases with the added advantage of being re-usable for further catalytic cycles. PFL-immobilised nanoparticles were shown {{to be more effective}} catalysts than CRL-immobilised materials. In the bio- catalytic reaction (ii), Lipase-immobilised materials were shown to exhibit reasonable conversion values (maximum 53...|$|E
40|$|In {{developing}} a biosensor, the utmost important aspects {{that need to}} be emphasized are the specificity and selectivity of the transducer. These two vital prerequisites are of paramount in ensuring a robust and reliable biosensor. Improvements in electrochemical sensors can be achieved by using microelectrodes and to modify the electrode surface (using chemical or biological recognition layers to improve the sensitivity and selectivity). The fabrication and characterisations of silicon-based and glass-based gold microelectrode arrays with various geometries (band and disc) and dimension (ranging from 10 μm- 100 nm) were reported. It was found that silicon-based transducers of 10 μm gold microelectrode array exhibited the most stable and reproducible electrochemical measurements hence this dimension was selected for further study. Chemical electrodeposition on both 10 μm microband and microdisc were found viable by electro-assisted self-assembled sol-gel silica film and nanoporous-gold electrodeposition respectively. The fabrication and characterisations of on-chip electrochemical cell was also reported with a fixed diameter/width dimension and interspacing variation. With this regard, the 10 μm microelectrode array with interspacing distance of 100 μm exhibited the best electrochemical response. Surface functionalisations on single chip of planar gold macroelectrodes were also studied for the immobilisation of histidine-tagged protein and antibody. Imaging techniques such as atomic force microscopy, fluorescent microscopy or scanning electron microscope were employed to complement the electrochemical characterisations. The long-chain thiol of self-assembled monolayer with NTA-metal ligand coordination was selected for the histidine-tagged protein while <b>silanisation</b> technique was selected for the antibody immobilisation. The final part of the thesis described the development of a T- 2 labelless immunosensor using impedimetric approach. Good antibody calibration curve was obtained for both 10 μm microband and 10 μm microdisc array. For the establishment of the T- 2 /HT- 2 toxin calibration curve, it was found that larger microdisc array dimension was required to produce better calibration curve. The calibration curves established in buffer solution show that the microelectrode arrays were sensitive and able to detect levels of T- 2 /HT- 2 toxin as low as 25 ppb (25 μg kg- 1) with a limit of quantitation of 4. 89 ppb for a 10 μm microband array and 1. 53 ppb for the 40 μm microdisc array...|$|E
40|$|Magnetic {{nanoparticles}} (MNPs) hold {{great promise}} {{in the fields}} of biology and medicine. The synthesis of functional MNPs with precisely controlled crystallographic, physicochemical, and magnetic properties on a large scale still remains the challenge today. This thesis reports the exploration of liquid-fed flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) in the synthesis of functional MNPs, their surface modifications, and potential bio-applications. Superparamagnetic and ferromagnetic maghemite (&# 947;-Fe 2 O 3) nanoparticles, and silica-coated maghemite (SiO 2 /&# 947;-Fe 2 O 3) nanocomposites were synthesised using FSP. The size of &# 947;-Fe 2 O 3 was controllable from 6 to 53 nm, with morphology evolving from a disordered near-spherical shape to fully ordered 2 -D hexagonal/octagonal platelet. The saturation magnetisation (Ms) increased from 21 to 74 emu/g with increasing particle size, up to 13 nm when Ms approached the bulk &# 947;-Fe 2 O 3 characteristics. In the case of SiO 2 /&# 947;-Fe 2 O 3, three distinct morphologies, namely the single segregated &# 947;-Fe 2 O 3 core- SiO 2 shell, transitional mixed morphologies, and multi &# 947;-Fe 2 O 3 cores embedded in submicron SiO 2 shell, were obtained. The core size, composite size, and morphology of &# 947;- Fe 2 O 3 were tunable by varying %SiO 2 loading and the use of a quartz tube enclosure during flame synthesis. The magnetic behaviour correlated well with the crystal microstructure. Following the core particle design, protein adsorption-desorption behaviour on FSP-madeMNPs was studied. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) adsorption was found to follow the Langmuir isotherm, with high binding capacities (150 &# 8722; 348 mg BSA/g particle) and fast association constants. Electrostatically governed BSA orientations were proposed for different particle-buffer systems. The adsorbed BSA was effectively recovered by pH-shift using K 2 HPO 4. Subsequently, terminal amine, aldehyde, carboxylic, epoxy, mercapto and maleimide functionality were anchored onto the FSP-made &# 947;-Fe 2 O 3 particles. These versatile functional groups led to conjugation of active trypsin. The immobilised trypsin exhibited superior durability with > 60 % residual activity after one week, and excellent reusability for > 5 cycles. The trypsin-conjugated MNPs are promising carriers in proteomics, demonstrating good substrate specificity with equivalent or better sequence coverage compared to free trypsin in insulin and BSA digestion. In another application, a refined <b>silanisation</b> procedure simultaneously reduced &# 947;-Fe 2 O 3 to Fe 3 O 4, and generated thiol enriched surface for matrix metalloproteinase- 2 (MMP- 2) conjugation. The highly active MMP- 2 -conjugated MNPs could potentially enhance the interstitial transport of macromolecule/nanoparticles in drug delivery...|$|E
