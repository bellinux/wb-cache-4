40|$|Revalorization of {{strawberry}} surpluses by bio-transforming its glucose content into gluconic acidDOI: 10. 1016 /j. fbp. 2016. 05. 005 URL: [URL] societies produce massive surpluses of food, by-products and wastes {{that increase}} the interest for their revalorization. This work examines {{the use of a}} culture of Gluconobacter japonicus CECT 8443, without pH control, to convert selectively the glucose content of industrially pasteurized strawberry purée into gluconic acid for the development of new beverages. However, depending on the initial concentration of glucose, the microorganism could transform the acid formed into other compounds; for this reason, in this work the effect of initial sugar concentration on the preservation of the acid was investigated. The results show that the gluconic acid formed in <b>strawberry</b> purée <b>containing</b> no <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> started to disappear after glucose depletion, but the acid concentration remained constant if sugar-enriched purée was used. The use of this industrial substrate resulted in the presence of yeasts and hence in some fructose uptake; however, the fructose consumption was negligible until after 20 - 30 h. The use of food by-products is an excellent opportunity not only to recover valuable compounds but for the development of new chemical and biotechnological approaches for their revalorization. This strategy should improve regional economies and contribute to a sustainable management of these underexploited resources...|$|R

40|$|Consumption of <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> in Canada {{is often}} {{reported}} {{to be higher than}} data suggest. Both popular and scientific articles often incorrectly report unadjusted national food supply (availability) data as actual consumption data. Additionally, when describing Canadian eating habits, US data is often cited. This does not provide an accurate reflection of Canadian consumption patterns, as Canadian intakes of many foods and beverages <b>containing</b> <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> are substantially below US levels (1). Misinformation about <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> consumption may be linked to complications associated with their estimation. Such difficulties include estimating waste adjustment factors to determine apparent consumption from food availability data; missing availability data for some sources of <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> (notably corn sweeteners); and the lack of a comprehensive database of <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> content in foods. In this article, the available literature and various reports are used to provide the best estimates of <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> consumption in Canada.

40|$|The role of <b>added</b> <b>sugar</b> in {{a healthy}} diet and {{implications}} for health inequalities Sugars provide a readily available, inexpensive source of energy, can increase palatability and help preserve some foods. However <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> also dilute the nutrient density of the diet. Further, consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages is associated with increased risk of weight gain and reduced bone strength, and high or frequent consumption of <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> is associated with increased risk of dental caries, particularly in infants and young children. The products of the 2013 NHMRC Dietary Guidelines work program at www. eatforhealth. gov. au include the comprehensive evidence base about food, diet and health relationships and the dietary modeling used to inform recommendations. This presentation will detail the scientific evidence underpinning the revised dietary recommendations on consumption of foods and drinks <b>containing</b> <b>added</b> <b>sugar</b> and compare recommendations with the most recently available relevant Australian dietary intake and trend data.

5000|$|The {{increase}} in consumption of sweetened beverages {{has been described}} as a worldwide health problem, but it is particularly visible in the United States, from where most popular drinks, like sodas, have originated. In the US, sweetened beverages such as most sodas are the most widely consumed type of foods <b>containing</b> <b>added</b> <b>sugar,</b> and they account for about a third of all consumption of <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> (about half if counted together with fruit juice; about twice the amount that is gained from the categories of [...] "desserts" [...] and [...] "sweets").

Some more recent research suggests that the <b>added</b> <b>sugar</b> consumption in the US has started declining in the 21st century, due to a related decrease in the consumption of sweetened beverages, encouraged by the government health awareness initiative and other programs.|$|R
5000|$|Breakfast in New Zealand is {{very similar}} to the Australian breakfast. The range of {{processed}} breakfast cereals is vast and children are more likely to eat those that <b>contain</b> <b>added</b> <b>sugar.</b> New Zealanders, particularly in winter, are likely to eat a hot oat cereal called [...] "porridge". Porridge is typically served with milk, sugar, fruit or yogurt. Sliced bread which has been toasted and topped with preserves or spreads is a common alternative breakfast. Eating breakfast at a restaurant was unheard of until the 1990s; however cafes which serve breakfast until midday or all day are now common. The Big Breakfast is the main item at cafes, which is similar to the British cooked breakfast, except that it seldom includes black pudding. Other common menu items are: eggs done how you like, eggs benedict, beans on toast, pancakes, cereal and yogurt, and smoothies. Breakfast nearly always includes coffee, tea or both, with children drinking milk either on their cereal, in a glass or hot milo. Recent concern has been raised about the cost of milk and some families being unable to afford it.|$|R
5000|$|Sugar {{sweetened}} beverages or sugary {{drinks are}} beverages that contain {{any form of}} <b>added</b> <b>sugars.</b> Out of the entire diet, Americans <b>add</b> <b>sugar</b> to beverages more so than any other product. Sugar-Sweetened beverages or sugary drinks are the leading source of <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> in the American diet. Added sugars include syrups and other caloric sweeteners. Other examples of <b>added</b> <b>sugars,</b> especially ones that can be listed as an ingredient, include brown sugar, corn sweetener, corn syrup, dextrose, fructose, glucose, high fructose corn syrup, honey, invert sugar, lactose, malt syrup, maltose, molasses, raw sugar, sucrose, trehalose, and turbinado <b>sugar.</b> The <b>added</b> <b>sugar</b> content is associated with several health concerns like weight gain, obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, liver disease, dental implications, and gout. Naturally occurring sugars, {{such as those in}} fruit or milk, are not <b>added</b> <b>sugars.</b> Even though there are several beverages/drinks that have sugar in them, some beverages, such as milk, fruit juice, and diet drinks, fall into a [...] "gray" [...] area because of different contributions to health and weight gain is more complex. Sugar-sweetened beverages <b>contain</b> <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> such as sucrose or fructose, often in large amounts, which contribute to the overall energy density of diets. The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed guidance on free sugars. Based on the impact of free sugars intake and its effects on weight gain and dental issues the WHO has taken action on such problems. Free sugars include monosaccharides and disaccharides added to foods and beverages by the manufacturer, cook or consumer, and sugars naturally present in honey, syrups, fruit juices and fruit juice concentrates. Current evidence suggests that increasing consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages is associated with weight gain. Reducing consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages can also reduce the risk of unhealthy weight gain in adults. [...] For a normal calorie diet, calories from <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> should be less than 10 percent of the daily calorie limit. Eating habits that include a lesser amount of <b>added</b> <b>sugars,</b> that can be from reduced intake of sugary drinks, can be associated with reduced risk of CVD in adults, and moderate evidence indicates that these eating patterns are associated with reduced risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and some types of cancer in adults.|$|R

40|$|Background: The Health Star Rating (HSR) is {{an interpretive}} front-of-pack {{labelling}} system that rates the overall nutritional profile of packaged foods. The algorithm underpinning the HSR includes total sugar content {{as one of}} the components. This has been criticised because intrinsic sugars naturally present in dairy, fruits, and vegetables are treated the same as <b>sugars</b> <b>added</b> during food processing. We assessed whether the HSR could better discriminate between core and discretionary foods by including <b>added</b> <b>sugar</b> in the underlying algorithm. Methods: Nutrition information was extracted for 34, 135 packaged foods available in The George Institute’s Australian FoodSwitch database. Added sugar levels were imputed from food composition databases. Products were classified as ‘core’ or ‘discretionary’ based on the Australian Dietary Guidelines. The ability of each of the nutrients included in the HSR algorithm, as well as <b>added</b> <b>sugar,</b> to discriminate between core and discretionary foods was estimated using the area under the curve (AUC). Results: 15, 965 core and 18, 350 discretionary foods were included. Of these, 8230 (52 %) core foods and 15, 947 (87 %) discretionary foods <b>contained</b> <b>added</b> <b>sugar.</b> Median (Q 1, Q 3) HSRs were 4. 0 (3. 0, 4. 5) for core foods and 2. 0 (1. 0, 3. 0) for discretionary foods. Median <b>added</b> <b>sugar</b> contents (g/ 100 g) were 3. 3 (1. 5, 5. 5) for core foods and 14. 6 (1. 8, 37. 2) for discretionary foods. Of all the nutrients used in the current HSR algorithm, total sugar had the greatest individual capacity to discriminate between core and discretionary foods; AUC 0. 692 (0. 686; 0. 697). Added sugar alone achieved an AUC of 0. 777 (0. 772; 0. 782). A model with all nutrients in the current HSR algorithm had an AUC of 0. 817 (0. 812; 0. 821), which increased to 0. 871 (0. 867; 0. 874) with inclusion of <b>added</b> <b>sugar.</b> Conclusion: The HSR nutrients discriminate well between core and discretionary packaged foods. However, discrimination was improved when <b>added</b> <b>sugar</b> was also included. These data argue for inclusion of <b>added</b> <b>sugar</b> in an updated HSR algorithm and declaration of <b>added</b> <b>sugar</b> as part of mandatory nutrient declarations...|$|R

40|$|For {{at least}} a {{thousand}} years sugar has been valued for its organoleptic and preservative properties and as an impor-tant trading commodity. The furore sur-rounding the report from WHO and FAO (1) which included a recommend-ed upper limit for intake of free sugars, suggests that sugar is still of huge impor-tance in the global economy. The article by Steyn and colleagues (pp. 599 – 608) explains a guideline to restrict intake of sugar in South Africa. More than 20 countries {{are known to have}} similar guidelines. Yet representa-tives of the sugar industry claim that other authoritative reports do not pro-vide evidence of adverse health effects to the extent that warrants appreciable reductions in sugar intake. It is therefore important to examine these apparent dis-crepancies. The term “sugar ” was previously understood to be more or less synony-mous with sucrose derived from sugar cane or beet. In the United States and other countries high fructose corn syrup is increasingly used in manufactured foods so that while intake of sucrose may be decreasing, the total amount of sugars is not. From the perspective of human health, sugars are generally divided into two main groups: those incorporated within the structure of intact fruit and vegetables (sometimes labelled “intrinsic” sugars) and those saccharides which are added to foods and drinks by manufac-turer, cook or consumer (<b>added</b> <b>sugars).</b> Dietary guidelines do not recommend restriction of intrinsic sugars or milk sug-ars (lactose, galactose) since these are not considered to have adverse health out-comes. However, <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> plus con-centrated sugars in honey, syrups and fruit juices (collectively described as “free sugars”) are believed to be broadly com-parable when it comes to considering untoward effects and are therefore con-sidered as a group. A report issued in September 2002 by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) on dietary reference intakes (2) has been interpreted as suggesting that intake of <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> may be as high as 25 % of total energy without detrimental effect. This is misleading since this maximal intake level is based on ensuring suffi-cient US intakes of certain essential micronutrients not present in foods and beverages that <b>contain</b> <b>added</b> <b>sugars.</b> It in no way implies that this is an accept-able level of intake in other respects...|$|R

However, the associations between modifiable lifestyle factors and Apo concentrations have not been investigated in detail. Therefore, this study investigated the associations between Apo concentrations and education, lifestyle factors and dietary intake (macronutrients and 34 food groups). These cross-sectional associations were examined among 24, 984 individuals in a Swedish population-based cohort. Baseline examinations of the cohort were conducted between 1991 and 1996. Dietary intake was assessed using a modified diet history method. The main determinants of high ApoA 1 concentrations (r between 0. 05 and 0. 25) were high alcohol consumption, high physical activity, non-smoking, and a low body mass index (BMI), and the main determinants of high ApoB concentrations were smoking and a high BMI. The intake of sucrose and food products <b>containing</b> <b>added</b> <b>sugar</b> (such as pastries, sweets, chocolate, jam/sugar and sugar-sweetened beverages) was negatively correlated with ApoA 1 concentrations and positively correlated with ApoB concentrations and the ApoB/ApoA 1 ratio, whereas the intake of fermented dairy products, such as fermented milk and cheese, was positively correlated with ApoA 1 concentrations and negatively correlated with the ApoB/ApoA 1 ratio. These results indicate that smoking, obesity, low physical activity, low alcohol consumption and a diet high in sugar and low in fermented dairy products are correlated with an unfavorable Apo profile...|$|R
