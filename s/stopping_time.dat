With time stuttering and collapsing, objects may get trapped in a time loop and either become platforms for players to proceed into the next section of the game, or create dangerous environmental hazards, which are extremely unstable. In the latter case they become obstacles that block the player's path. Jack can overcome them by using his time manipulation powers, such as slowing down or <b>stopping</b> <b>time,</b> {{so that he can}} proceed without getting hurt.

As the game progresses, visual cues—highlighted {{portions of the}} background or foreground—will appear on the screen to help survive the dangers that occur throughout the stage; more difficult settings omit the visual cues. Depending on {{the location of the}} cue, the player will input one of four directions (up, down, left and right) or an attack (shoot the target with a laser gun). Inputting the correct command will either avoid or neutralize the threats and progress the game, while incorrect choices result in the character's death. Reika dying too many times results in a game over. Specific moments in the game involve Reika <b>stopping</b> <b>time.</b> During these moments, players are presented with a list of three options and have seven seconds to choose the one which will save the character.|$|E

The studio's 100 employees later developed the visual effects for 300 of the 600 shots in the film. In total, {{there are more than}} 100 jumps in the film, and each jump was modified based on the distance and location the character(s) jumped. The jumps were developed using Nuke and Shake software; many, including those to Big Ben and the Sphinx were created with Maya. Weta's VFX supervisor Erik Winquist explained how the visual effects of the jumps were created: [...] "The concept of what a jump looks like changed and evolved a little over the course of post production. There are shots in the film that use still array footage but not {{in the same way that}} we saw in The Matrix.

Motivated by many recently arisen problems in risk management and exotic options, we study some look-back <b>stopping</b> <b>times</b> including drawdown and drawup, Parisian time and inverse occupation time of some time-homogeneous Markov processes such as diffusion processes and jump-diffusion processes. Since the structures of these look-back <b>stopping</b> <b>times</b> are much more complex than fundamental <b>stopping</b> <b>times</b> such as first passage times, we aim to develop some general approaches to study these <b>stopping</b> <b>times</b> such as approximation approach and perturbation approach.

Many interesting and explicit formulas for these <b>stopping</b> <b>times</b> are derived and based on which we gain quantitative understandings of these problems in insurance and finance.

Due to the complex structures, the distributions of these look-back <b>stopping</b> <b>times</b> are usually not explicit even for the simplest linear Brownian motion. However, under Laplace transforms, many important formulas become explicit and it enables us to conduct further derivations and analysis.
