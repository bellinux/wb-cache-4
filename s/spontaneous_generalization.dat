40|$|Connectionism {{represents}} a possible {{approach to the}} resolution of the issues of insufficiently described traffic systems. The system for keeping records on transport capacities of the fleet has been structured by a system of processing units. The output of an individual unit has been determined by the number of products of multiplication of the incidence of input attributes and the strength of their association links. The proposed model has been implemented for vehicles of the fleet described with eight groups (classes) of information. Verification of the application of the connectionism model within the scope of expedite monitoring (follow-up} of performance of transportation means has been completed in an effort of searching for the characteristics of the vehicle according to the data from the records (register) on individual vehicles, identification of the vehicle according to an insufficient description of its characteristics and in cases of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>generalization</b> of characteristics of a vehicle. </p...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} a multicomponent parent training program which emphasized the acquisition of general (as opposed to task-specific) techniques on parents ’ ability to generalize learned skills from an academic task school setting to a structured play home setting. Training in behavior modification skills was introduced in a multiple baseline design across subjects (parents). The results showed that the training procedures facilitated <b>spontaneous</b> <b>generalization</b> of parenting skills from the school to the home for one parent but not for a second parent. After in-home generalization training was conducted for the one parent, both parents demonstrated a maintenance of learned skills over a 12 -month follow-up period. The results of the study support the need for vigorous assessment of generalization and maintenance and the identification of specific intervention procedures and parent/ family variables that may be associated with treatment outcome. 1 The need for a more intensive investiga-tion of generalization and maintenance ef-fects of behavioral parent training has been clearly cited in a number of parent trainin...|$|E
40|$|The {{current study}} {{assessed}} {{the effectiveness of}} Teacher-Child Interaction Training (TCIT), an adaptation of Eyeberg’s Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT), on teacher and child behaviors in a day-treatment preschool setting. The sample included 5 day-treatment classrooms in an urban, socioeconomically disadvantaged, and culturally diverse setting. The study utilized a concurrent multiple probe design across classroom settings (3 training groups consisting of 5 classrooms) to evaluate the effects of didactic and in-vivo coaching on teacher and child behaviors in the training and classroom settings. Results indicated that all teachers ’ use of positive behaviors increased and negative behaviors decreased during pull-out sessions; all 5 teachers attained CDI and TDI mastery criteria. Results also indicated some evidence of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>generalization</b> of teachers ’ use of Labeled Praises to the classroom setting, while other teacher behaviors did not generalize. Results on child behavior were variable and failed to demonstrate consistent improvements in the classroom setting; this finding is understood {{given the lack of}} generalization of teachers ’ behaviors to the classroom. These findings provid...|$|E

In thus {{attempting}} {{to ascertain the}} general order of nature by ascertaining the particular order of the occurrence of {{each one of the}} phenomena of nature, the most scientific proceeding can be no more than an improved form of that which was primitively pursued by the human understanding, while undirected by science. When mankind first formed the idea of studying phenomena according to a stricter and surer method than that which they had in the first instance spontaneously adopted, they did not, conformably to the well-meant but impracticable precept of Descartes, set out from the supposition that nothing had been already ascertained. Many of the uniformities existing among phenomena are so constant, and so open to observation, as to force themselves upon involuntary recognition. Some facts are so perpetually and familiarly accompanied by certain others, that mankind learned, as children learn, to expect the one where they found the other, long before they knew how to put their expectation into words by asserting, in a proposition, the existence of a connection between those phenomena. No science was needed to teach that food nourishes, that water drowns, or quenches thirst, that the sun gives light and heat, that bodies fall to the ground. The first scientific inquirers assumed these and the like as known truths, and set out from them to discover others which were unknown: nor were they wrong in so doing, subject, however, as they afterward began to see, to an ulterior revision of these <b>spontaneous</b> <b>generalizations</b> themselves, when the progress of knowledge pointed out limits to them, or showed their truth to be contingent on some circumstance not originally attended to. It will appear, I think, from the subsequent part of our inquiry, that there is no logical fallacy in this mode of proceeding; but we may see already that any other mode is rigorously impracticable: since it is impossible to frame any scientific method of induction, or test of the correctness of inductions, unless on the hypothesis that some inductions deserving of reliance have been already made.|$|R
40|$|Imitation is {{a pivotal}} social-communicative skill, which {{is crucial for}} children???s social and {{language}} development. Research has shown that young children with autism often have deficits in imitation skills. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the effects of a parent-implemented modified Reciprocal Imitation Training (RIT) on object and gestural imitation skills for children with autism. Two parents were trained and coached to use the modified RIT with their young children with autism in the home. The modified RIT was composed of reciprocity, object imitation, and gestural imitation strategies. A multiple baseline design across strategies was used to examine the parents??? competence in learning and implementing the modified RIT. Results indicated that parents learned to use the intervention strategies, and children showed improvements in <b>spontaneous</b> imitation. <b>Generalization</b> effects for parents and children were examined in typical routines. Maintenance data were collected two weeks following the end of intervention...|$|R
40|$|Two {{experiments}} explore children's spontaneous {{labeling of}} novel objects {{as a method}} to study early lexical access. The experiments also provide new evidence on children's attention to object shape when labeling objects. In Experiment 1, the spontaneous productions of 21 23 - to 28 -month-olds (mean 26; 28) shown a set of novel, unnamed objects were analyzed {{both in terms of}} the specific words said and, via adult judgments, their likely perceptual basis. We found that children's spontaneous names were cued by the perceptual feature of shape. Experiment 2 examines the relation between <b>spontaneous</b> productions, name <b>generalizations</b> in a structured task, and vocabulary development in a group of children between 17 and 24 months of age (mean 21; 6). Results indicate that object shape {{plays an important role in}} both spontaneous productions and novel noun generalization, but contrary to current hypotheses, children may name objects by shape from the earliest points of productive vocabulary development and this tendency may not be lexically specific...|$|R
40|$|Human {{capacity}} for entraining movement to external rhythms—i. e., beat keeping—is ubiquitous, but its evolutionary history and neural underpinnings remain a mystery. Recent findings of entrainment to simple and complex rhythms in non-human animals {{pave the way}} for a novel comparative approach to assess the origins and mechanisms of rhythmic behavior. The most reliable non-human beat keeper to date is a California sea lion, Ronan, who was trained to match head movements to isochronous repeating stimuli and showed <b>spontaneous</b> <b>generalization</b> of this ability to novel tempos and to the complex rhythms of music. Does Ronan’s performance rely on the same neural mechanisms as human rhythmic behavior? In the current study, we presented Ronan with simple rhythmic stimuli at novel tempos. On some trials, we introduced perturbations, altering either tempo or phase {{in the middle of a}} presentation. Ronan quickly adjusted her behavior following all perturbations, recovering her consistent phase and tempo relationships to the stimulus within a few beats. Ronan’s performance was consistent with predictions of mathematical models describing coupled oscillation: a model relying solely on phase coupling strongly matched her behavior, and the model was further improved with the addition of period coupling. These findings are the clearest evidence yet for parity in human and non-human beat keeping and support the view that the human ability to perceive and move in time to rhythm may be rooted in broadly conserved neural mechanisms...|$|E
6000|$|Mr Herbert Spencer, in {{his essay}} {{entitled}} [...] "The Genesis of Science," [...] and more recently in a pamphlet on [...] "the Classification of the Sciences," [...] has criticised and condemned M. Comte's classification, and proposed a more elaborate one of his own: and M. Littré, in his valuable biographical and philosophical work on M. Comte ("Auguste Comte et la Philosophie Positive"), has at some length criticised the criticism. Mr Spencer {{is one of the}} small number of persons who by the solidity and encyclopedical character of their knowledge, and their power of co-ordination and concatenation, may claim to be the peers of M. Comte, and entitled to a vote in the estimation of him. But after giving to his animadversions the respectful attention due to all that comes from Mr Spencer, we cannot find that he has made out any case. It is always easy to find fault with a classification. There are a hundred possible ways of arranging any set of objects, and something may almost always be said against the best, and in favour of the worst of them. But the merits of a classification depend on the purposes to which it is instrumental. We have shown the purposes for which M. Comte's classification is intended. Mr Spencer has not shown that it is ill adapted to those purposes: and we cannot perceive that his own answers any ends equally important. His chief objection is that if the more special sciences need the truths of the more general ones, the latter also need some of those of the former, and have at times been stopped in their progress by the imperfect state of sciences which follow long after them in M. Comte's scale; so that, the dependence being mutual, there is a consensus, but not an ascending scale or hierarchy of the sciences. That the earlier sciences derive help from the later is undoubtedly true; it is part of M. Comte's theory, and amply exemplified in the details of his work. When he affirms that one science historically precedes another, he {{does not mean that the}} perfection of the first precedes the humblest commencement of those which follow. Mr Spencer does not distinguish between the empirical stage of the cultivation of a branch of knowledge, and the scientific stage. The commencement of every study consists in gathering together unanalyzed facts, and treasuring up such <b>spontaneous</b> <b>generalizations</b> as present themselves to natural sagacity. In this stage any branch of inquiry can be carried on independently of every other; and it is one of M. Comte's own remarks that the most complex, in a scientific point of view, of all studies, the latest in his series, the study of man as a moral and social being, since from its absorbing interest it is cultivated more or less by every one, and pre-eminently by the great practical minds, acquired at an early period a greater stock of just though unscientific observations than the more elementary sciences. It is these empirical truths that the later and more special sciences lend to the earlier; or, at most, some extremely elementary scientific truth, which happening to be easily ascertainable by direct experiment, could be made available for carrying a previous science already founded, to a higher stage of development; a re-action of the later sciences on the earlier which M. Comte not only fully recognized, but attached great importance to systematizing.[4] ...|$|R
40|$|To {{advance the}} field of children’s services, {{implementation}} and generalization {{studies are needed to}} help us reveal the inner workings of intervention projects and how they do (or do not) achieve their outcomes. This paper provides a case study of Head Start teachers’ uptake of the Getting Ready school readiness intervention, intended to strengthen professionals’ capacity to support parental engagement in young children’s development and learning. The qualitative method of document review was used in scrutinizing home visit reports and classroom newsletters as a source of authentic evidence about teachers’ implementation and generalization of an early intervention model. Home visits were a focus of training and coaching, and the analysis provided strong evidence of treatment group teachers implementing Getting Ready strategies of collaborative planning and problem-solving with parents around academic learning and social-emotional goals. In contrast, newsletters were not the focus of the intervention; their analysis provided clear evidence of <b>spontaneous</b> change (hence, <b>generalization)</b> made by teachers on their own as they sought to strengthen home-school collaboration, form strong and trusting relationships, and spotlight and acknowledge child and parent competence. Beyond finding evidence of teachers’ uptake and generalization of the Getting Ready strategies, the study suggests the utility of analyzing teachers’ everyday documents to uncover patterns of behavior change of teachers seeking to implement an early childhood school readiness intervention...|$|R
40|$|Much {{evidence}} suggests that, {{from a young}} age, humans are able to generalize information learned about a subset of a category to the category itself. Here, we propose that—beyond simply being able to perform such generalizations—people are biased to generalize to categories, such that they routinely make <b>spontaneous,</b> implicit category <b>generalizations</b> from information that licenses such generalizations. To demonstrate {{the existence of this}} bias, we asked participants to perform a task in which category generalizations would distract from the main goal of the task, leading to a characteristic pattern of errors. Specifically, participants were asked to memorize two types of novel facts: quantified facts about sets of kind members (e. g., facts about all or many stups) and generic facts about entire kinds (e. g., facts about zorbs as a kind). Moreover, half of the facts concerned properties that are typically generalizable to an animal kind (e. g., eating fruits and vegetables), and half concerned properties that are typically more idiosyncratic (e. g., getting mud in their hair). We predicted that—because of the hypothesized bias—participants would spontaneously generalize the quantified facts to the corresponding kinds, and would do so more frequently for the facts about generalizable (rather than idiosyncratic) properties. In turn, these generalizations would lead to a higher rate of quantified‐to‐generic memory errors for the generalizable properties. The results of four experiments (N =  449) supported this prediction. Moreover, the same generalizable‐versus‐idiosyncratic difference in memory errors occurred even under cognitive load, which suggests that the hypothesized bias operates unnoticed in the background, requiring few cognitive resources. In sum, this {{evidence suggests}} the presence of a powerful bias to draw generalizations about kinds...|$|R
