5|$|Each atomic orbital {{corresponds}} to a particular energy level of the electron. The electron can change its state to a higher energy level by absorbing a photon with sufficient energy to boost it into the new quantum state.

These characteristic energy values, defined by {{the differences in the}} energies of the quantum <b>states,</b> <b>are</b> responsible for atomic spectral lines.|$|E
