25|$|The Italian nobleman Luigi Amedeo {{organized}} {{an expedition}} to sail as far north by land as possible and then traverse the ice sheet with sledges to the North Pole. He bought the Norwegian whaling vessel Jason, which he christened <b>Stalle</b> Polare. The expedition left Christiania on 12June 1899, taking on board 121 dogs in Arkhangelsk, which they left on 12July. After sighting Northbrook Island on 21July, they subsequently encountered the Capella and Wellman on 6August, while stuck in ice in the British Channel. The <b>Stalle</b> Polare eventually broke free and sailed north to Rupert Island. Although hoping to continue along Petermann or King Oscar Lands, they established that no such lands were visible and instead established a winter base at Replitz Bay. From August onwards, the ice proved strong enough for a dog sleigh expedition to explore the island.|$|E

5000|$|A type of wight from Northern Sweden called Vittra lives underground, is {{invisible}} {{most of the}} time and has its own cattle. Most of the time Vittra are rather distant and do not meddle in human affairs, but are fearsome when enraged. This can be achieved by not respecting them properly, for example by neglecting to perform certain rituals (such as saying [...] "look out" [...] when putting out hot water or going to the toilet so they can move out of the way) or building your home too close to or, even worse, on top of their home, disturbing their cattle or blocking their roads. They can make your life very very miserable or even dangerous - they {{do whatever it takes to}} drive you away, even arrange accidents that will harm or even kill you. Even in modern days, people have rebuilt or moved houses in order not to block a [...] "Vittra-way", or moved from houses that are deemed a [...] "Vittra-place" [...] (Vittra <b>ställe)</b> because of bad luck - although this is rather uncommon. In tales told in the north of Sweden, Vittra often take the place that trolls, tomte and vättar hold in the same stories told in other parts of the country. Vittra are believed to sometimes [...] "borrow" [...] cattle that later would be returned to the owner with the ability to give more milk as a sign of gratitude. This tradition is heavily influenced by the fact that it was developed during a time when people let their cattle graze on mountains or in the forest for long periods of the year.|$|E
