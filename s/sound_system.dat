5|$|In {{professional}} concert <b>sound</b> <b>system</b> design, subwoofers can {{be incorporated}} seamlessly with the main speakers into a stereo or mono full-range system by using an active crossover. Such a system receives its signal from the main mono or stereo mixing console mix bus and amplifies all frequencies together in the desired balance. If the main <b>sound</b> <b>system</b> is stereo, the subwoofers can also be in stereo. Otherwise, a mono subwoofer channel can be derived within the crossover from a stereo mix, depending on the crossover make and model.|$|E

On the dashboard, satnav and Bluetooth are standard in later models (options on earlier models). Later models also offered a Dolby Prologic <b>sound</b> <b>system</b> can be connected to satellite radio, a six-CD changer, an iPod connector, a USB connector, or an auxiliary input jack.

The number of <b>sound</b> <b>systems</b> involved also varies - small parties may have just one or two <b>sound</b> <b>systems,</b> larger parties may have anything up to 20 or more, including several [...] "link-ups" [...] where two or more <b>sound</b> <b>systems</b> will combine their rigs into a single large system.|$|R

5|$|In Europe, {{others were}} {{also working on}} the {{development}} of sound-on-film. In 1919, the same year that DeForest received his first patents in the field, three German inventors, Josef Engl (1893–1942), Hans Vogt (1890–1979), and Joseph Massolle (1889–1957), patented the Tri-Ergon <b>sound</b> <b>system.</b> On September 17, 1922, the Tri-Ergon group gave a public screening of sound-on-film productions—including a dramatic talkie, Der Brandstifter (The Arsonist) —before an invited audience at the Alhambra Kino in Berlin. By the end of the decade, Tri-Ergon would be the dominant European <b>sound</b> <b>system.</b> In 1923, two Danish engineers, Axel Petersen and Arnold Poulsen, patented a system that recorded sound on a separate filmstrip running parallel with the image reel. Gaumont licensed the technology and briefly put it to commercial use under the name Cinéphone.|$|E

5000|$|Venues with A/B <b>sound</b> <b>systems</b> {{effectively}} {{have two}} separate <b>sound</b> <b>systems</b> {{which can be}} used simultaneously. Deciding what to do with such a system is generally an artistic rather than a technical decision, and so the decision is made by the Sound designer.|$|R
50|$|Showco's initial {{focus was}} <b>sound</b> <b>systems,</b> {{stemming}} from musicians' frustrations with sub-par live sound set-ups.

5|$|A MOS Technology 6502 {{chip that}} {{operates}} at 894kHz generates the sound effects, and a speech synthesizer by Votrax generates Q*bert's incoherent expressions. The audio system uses 128B of random-access memory and 4KB of erasable programmable {{read only memory}} to store the sound data and code to implement it. Like other Gottlieb games, the <b>sound</b> <b>system</b> was thoroughly tested to ensure it would handle daily usage. In retrospect, audio engineer David Thiel commented that such testing minimized time available for creative designing.|$|E

5|$|A {{prominent}} {{feature of}} the new command centre was a large liquid crystal display which displayed information regarding the air conditioning unit and <b>sound</b> <b>system.</b> Buyers could opt for a premium sound package, standard on the Fairmont Ghia, which included a full-colour screen. Ventilation outlets were larger than those of previous models, resulting in a cabin that could be more effectively and efficiently heated or cooled. Another change was the headlamp switch, which was now located {{on the end of}} the turn signal stalk for easier reach.|$|E
5|$|By far {{the most}} {{expensive}} variant in the BA range, the Fairmont Ghia featured leather upholstery, wood grain highlights, full power options and a unique suspension assembly. The premium <b>sound</b> <b>system,</b> which incorporated a full-colour LCD screen, was standard, and the centre console stack was characterised by an analogue clock. Reverse parking sensors were available {{for the first time}} in the BA, standard on the Ghia. The sensors feature an automatic turn-off function for use when towing a boat or trailer for example.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} the origins of syllable systems that brings plausibility to the theory which claims that language learning, and in particular phonological acquisition, needs not innate linguistically specic information, as believed by many researchers of the Chomskyan school, but is rather made possible by the interaction between general motor, perceptual, cognitive and social constraints through a self-organizing process. The strategy is to replace the question of acquisition in a larger and evolutionary (cultural) framework: the model addresses the question of the origins of syllable systems (syllables are the major phonological units in speech). It is based on the articial life methodology of building a society of agents, endowed with motor, perceptual and cognitive apparati that are generic and realistic. We show that agents eectively build <b>sound</b> <b>systems</b> and how these <b>sound</b> <b>systems</b> relate to existing human <b>sound</b> <b>systems.</b> Results concerning the learnability of the produced <b>sound</b> <b>systems</b> by fresh/baby agents are detailed: the critical period eect and the articial language eect can eectively be predicted by our model. The ability of children to learn <b>sound</b> <b>systems</b> is explained by the evolutionary history of these <b>sound</b> <b>systems,</b> which were precisely shaped so as to t the ecological niche formed by the brains and bodies of these children, and {{not the other way around}} (as advocated by Chomskyan approaches to language) ...|$|R

5|$|Dubstep is a {{genre of}} {{electronic}} dance music that originated in South London, England. It {{emerged in the}} late 1990s as a development within a lineage of related styles such as 2-step garage, dub, techno, drum and bass, broken beat, jungle, and reggae. In the United Kingdom {{the origins of the}} genre {{can be traced back to}} the growth of the Jamaican <b>sound</b> <b>system</b> party scene in the early 1980s. The music generally features sparse, syncopated drum and percussion patterns with bass lines that contain prominent sub bass frequencies.|$|E
