40|$|Ambient radio {{frequency}} (RF) energy harvesting {{has emerged as}} a promising solution for powering small devices and sensors in massive Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem due to its ubiquity and cost efficiency. In this paper, we study joint uplink and downlink coverage of cellular-based ambient RF energy harvesting IoT where the cellular network is assumed to be the only source of RF energy. We consider a time division-based approach for power and information transmission where each time-slot is partitioned into three sub-slots: (i) charging <b>sub-slot</b> during which the cellular base stations (BSs) act as RF chargers for the IoT devices, which then use the energy harvested in this <b>sub-slot</b> for information transmission and/or reception during the remaining two sub-slots, (ii) downlink <b>sub-slot</b> during which the IoT device receives information from the associated BS, and (iii) uplink <b>sub-slot</b> during which the IoT device transmits information to the associated BS. For this setup, we characterize the joint coverage probability, which is the joint probability of the events that the typical device harvests sufficient energy in the given time slot and is under both uplink and downlink signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) coverage with respect to its associated BS. This metric significantly generalizes the prior art on energy harvesting communications, which usually focused on downlink or uplink coverage separately. The key technical challenge is in handling the correlation between the amount of energy harvested in the charging <b>sub-slot</b> and the information signal quality (SINR) in the downlink and uplink sub-slots. Dominant BS-based approach is developed to derive tight approximation for this joint coverage probability. Several system design insights including comparison with regularly powered IoT network and throughput-optimal slot partitioning are also provided...|$|E

Priority-aware {{transmission}} coordination mechanism: Since {{the transmission}} scheduling of each class of sensors is designed by fully utilizing the resource {{blocks in the}} superframe, a priority-aware transmission coordination mechanism is required to resolve the collisions among the sensors with different priorities. As shown in Fig. 1, we introduce a priority indicator by setting C− 1 sub-slots {{at the beginning of}} each time slot. The time length of a <b>sub-slot</b> can be set to the backoff period defined in IEEE 802.15. 4 protocol. For the priority class c= 1, its sensors have the highest transmission priority. Hence, if one sensor of class 1 has data packet to transmit, it first transmits the carrier signal during the C− 1 sub-slots as the priority indicator and then transmit the data packet during the remaining part of the slot. For any priority class c> 1, its sensors have to transmit data packet opportunistically. If one sensor from priority class c has data packet to transmit, it has to sense the channel for only one <b>sub-slot,</b> i.e., the <b>sub-slot</b> c− 1. If the channel is sensed idle during this <b>sub-slot,</b> it transmits the carrier signal during the remaining sub-slots c,…,C− 1 and then transmits the data packet; otherwise, it postpones the channel access try to the next scheduled slot. Note that more complicated preamble signal can be used instead of the carrier signal, thus to embed the SDP into some existing communication protocols.|$|E

30|$|The simple amplify-and-forward {{relaying}} protocol is adopted. In the HD mode, {{a transmission}} slot {{is divided into}} two equal sub-slots. In the first <b>sub-slot,</b> PT transmits a signal to PR, while ST and SR also receive the signal. In the second <b>sub-slot,</b> ST combines the received signal with its own signal and then amplifies the composite signal and forwards the amplified signal to PR and SR. PR and SR recover their desired signals from their received signals, respectively. In the FD mode, each transmission slot is not divided into two equal sub-slots. ST receives the signal from PT and immediately amplifies and forwards the composite signal to PR and SR.|$|E
30|$|In {{broadcast}} networks such as TV transmissions, the transmissions periodically encode specific symbols for synchronization [31]. These special symbols {{are used by}} the receivers to synchronize the timing and compute different channel characteristics such as multipath. Once a PR is synchronized, it reports CSI between PR and PT to its nearby STs using its backscatter interface for βT time. In case more than one PRs are located near a ST, there will be collision if both the PRs report CSI simultaneous. To avoid this collision, βT time slot is further divided into X sub-slots. In each slot, independent of others, a backscattering PR randomly selects a single <b>sub-slot</b> to transmit its signal. This divides each slot into a backscatter phase and a waiting phase of durations 1 /X and (1 - 1 /X), respectively. If two or more PRs select the same <b>sub-slot,</b> {{then there will be}} collision, which will be reported back by the receiving ST. Those users will then back-off for a random time and then try to send their information again by randomly selecting another <b>sub-slot</b> in the next time frame. We adopt this simple anti-collision method for our system, however, one can further reduce the number of collisions by adopting more complex anti-collision mechanisms reported in [32].|$|E

Thus, for a given data rate {{additional}} blocks can be allocated either well-separated in frequency to provide additional frequency-diversity, or adjacent in time or frequency (i.e., in same chunk cf. Figure 1), if enough diversity is already obtained from the frequency and/or spatial domain.|$|E
30|$|Here, W is the {{bandwidth}} and {{the value}} 1 / 2 {{is due to the}} fact that the transmission slot is divided into two equal <b>sub-slots.</b> Note that the amplify-and-forward relaying protocol is adopted and SR does not attempt to decode the primary signal, thus it is treated as an interference in (7). In addition, the goal of this work is to maximize the throughput of secondary system while satisfying the interference constraint of primary system, so maximizing the throughput of primary system is not concerned, but the maximal-ratio combining can be applied to improve the diversity gain of primary system [4].|$|R

However, the communication quality-of-service is degraded by the severe self-interference from the transmitting antenna to the receiving antenna of ST. In the FD transmission mode, ST will amplify and forward the composite signal received at the previous time instant m[*]−[*] 1. Specifically, the signal received by ST at the time instant m can be written as x̃_c 1 (m)=√(P_P)h_ 2 x_p(m)+n_ 21 (m)+v_r(m), where v_r(m)=√(P_q)h_qx(m) [...] is the residual self-interference due to the FD operation, x(m)[*]=[*]x [...]...|$|R

Uncoordinated nodes always {{transmit}} packets of fixed length set to 50 <b>sub-slots</b> (i.e., 500 B), while scheduled nodes transmit either fixed-length or variable-length packets {{depending on whether the}} packet adaptation algorithm is used or not. The resource scheduling algorithm runs {{at the beginning of each}} new frame. Each scheduled node requesting for resources is assigned a maximum of one slot per frame. The parameters of the CSMA/CA protocol and other default parameters used in this simulation are summarized in Table 1. A single simulation consists of 1000 frames. Results are averaged over 10 different simulation scenarios, characterized by different nodes’ positions in the area.|$|R
30|$|In this article, time {{division}} multiple access (TDMA) is considered. For a two-users case, each time slot {{is divided into two}} time sub-slots. Frequency {{division multiple access}} (FDMA) can also be considered in a similar fashion, where each frequency sub-band in FDMA corresponds to a time <b>sub-slot</b> in TDMA. The sharing scenarios are classified into two categories: three-time slots scenario (orthogonal), and two-time slots scenario (non-orthogonal). In both categories, the first-time slot is used for the sources’ transmission to the destination node and the relay nodes (broadcast phase). Orthogonal here refers to relay transmission, where the best relay transmits in the second-time slot, and the next-best relay transmits in the third-time slot (no interference). The second and third time slots are subdivided into Tk 1, and Tk 2 for k∈{ 2, 3 } to transmit user’s 1 and 2 data, respectively. For two-time slots scenario, distributed STBC or distributed BF transmission schemes are used to relay the data from the two best ordered relays to the destination node for the two users simultaneously. Non-orthogonal here refers to the transmission in the second-time slot; the best, and the next-best relays transmit at the same time. <b>Sub-slot</b> T 2 j is used by the best and next-best relays for transmitting user’s j data simultaneously for BF scenarios. The instantaneous value of the phase of the channel state information (CSI) of the source-relay and the relay-destination links are required to be available at the best, and the next-best relays to perform distributed BF. For distributed STBC the best and next-best relays transmit the re-encoded signal or the complex conjugate of the the re-encoded signal in a predetermined way as will be explained in Section “DF with distributed STBC (STBC-DF)”. The destination node for all scenarios, combines the directed and the relayed signals using MRC, where the received signals from all independent paths are co-phased, weighted, and combined, assuming the destination knows the instantaneous CSI from the sources, and the relays.|$|E
30|$|The {{proposed}} collaborative neighbor discovery (COND) mechanism {{has been}} summarized in Algorithm 1. Initially, the neighbor table of each node remains empty. After getting a HELLO/REPLY message from any neighbor, a node updates its own table (lines 6 – 23). The node that receives a HELLO message checks its neighbor table to find whether the node is discovered earlier or not. If {{there exists a}} record, the node checks the flag value and if the value is 1, it does not give any REPLY message to that node assuming that it has exchanged messages in the earlier slots with that node; otherwise, it updates {{the information in the}} neighbor table and sends a REPLY message in a random <b>sub-slot</b> to the direction of the sender node (lines 15 – 22). If the sender node receives a REPLY message (without any collision) from any neighbor, it adds the node in the neighbor table (lines 8 – 12). In this way, two nodes discover each other using two-way handshaking. In the case, a node cannot discover any new node in a certain sector in consecutive two iterations, we stop COND process in that sector (lines 25 – 27).|$|E
40|$|Demand for inter-activity {{drives the}} massive {{introduction}} of a return channel in CATV systems {{by means of the}} HFC architecture. Cost-effectiveness dictates sharing this return channel among many customers and the most suitable method is TDMA which can accommodate the high burstiness of the upstream traffic. The MAC protocol arbitrating the access to the time slots combines more than one access mechanisms but reservation ALOHA is the most promising method for the identification of busy stations. In this work a novel method allowing simultaneous reservations without previous symbol synchronization is presented. The simultaneous single symbol reservation (S 3 R) scheme greatly reduces the overhead for reservation <b>sub-slots</b> but also allows better and more predictable performance improving system utilization. © 2005 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering...|$|R

30|$|The {{study of}} MIMO MAC {{taking into account}} TDMA is pioneered by [17, 18]. The authors in [17] use MIMO-OFDM {{technology}} and space-time block codes to achieve parallel transmission, but busy tone channel cost additional overhead. The protocol in [18] allocates each node time <b>sub-slots</b> to reserve and raises time slot utilization using MIMO technology. Moreover, cross-layer MAC design [15, 19, 20] {{is also used to}} improve the performance of networks. To break the strict limitation of the communication between layers, cross-layer MAC design fully considers the relationship of each layer and allows exchanging information between layers {{on the basis of the}} original protocol stacks [21]. In terms of dynamic resource allocation, there are many existing methodologies to allocate the network resources (e.g., bandwidth [22], power per subcarrier [23], time slot and subchannel [24]) for nodes in the networks, which enhance the QoS and guarantee the packet transmission efficiently. Therefore, on the one hand, we can use the cross-layer information to adjust the transmission strategy adaptively to satisfy requirements of high layer, and on the other hand, we can also utilize them to implement time slot allocation for all the nodes in ad hoc networks. However, most of the existing time slot allocation schemes in ad hoc networks do not take the cross-layer information and the changes of network topologies [25, 26], which have the poor adaptability to network topology changes and cannot guarantee the QoS of the packets with high cross-layer transmission parameters.|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} reduce the {{implementation}} complexity and to improve the spectrum efficiency but still realize the potential benefits of multi-relay cooperation, based on the network coding (NC) techniques [7] and the opportunistic relaying (OR) techniques [8], the two-way network coding opportunistic relaying (TWOR-NC) has emerged as a promising solution [9], and instantly become one of research hot topics in wireless network fields [10 – 17]. The basic idea of the TWOR-NC is that, in multi-relay two-way systems, a round of signals exchange between two sources consists of two phases, namely, access phase (AC phase) and broadcast phase (BC phase). Notice that, according to the different transmission protocols employed, time division broadcast (TDBC) and multi-access broadcast (MABC), the AC phase can include one or two <b>sub-slots</b> while the BC phase only does one slot. In AC phase, two sources transmit their signals to relays while the relays are listening state. After receiving the signals from both sources, the best relay selection is performed based on a predefined criterion, which results in that only a best relay is selected for NC-ing the received signals and broadcasting the NC-ed signal in BC phase. Thus, after performing NC on the received signals, the selected best relay simultaneously broadcasts the NC-ed signal to two sources. After receiving the broadcasted signal from the best relay, each source can remove the self-interference from the received signal by taking its own transmitted signal as prior. Thus, the two sources can obtain the wished signal. Obviously, the TWOR-NC perfectly integrates the NC and OR techniques and possesses the advantages of the two techniques. The TWOR-NC systems hold the improvement not only on the spectral efficiency improved by as much as 33 or 50 % due to the employing of NC [7], but also on the implementation complexity decreased because the perfect time synchronization among the relays is no longer performed.|$|R
40|$|Broadcast {{communications}} {{are widely}} proposed for safety messaging. In {{the case of}} highway vehicular networks and constantly communicating safety messages inevitably cause the well-known hidden terminal problem. Three existing leading repetition-based broadcasting protocols have shown to meet the reliability and delay requirements for Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) safety systems. We propose a quantitative model to evaluate the quality of service (QoS) of DSRC systems using these three leading repetition-based protocols under hidden terminals and highway scenarios. The performance of our model is analyzed by means of probability of success and delay performances. We also present three new Medium Access Control (MAC) layer design protocols for safety messaging applications. The main protocol we introduce is known as Passive Cooperative Collision Warning (PCCW) protocol for repetition based vehicular safety message reception reliability improvement in DSRC. The PCCW protocol and jointly proposed Enhanced-PCCW (EPCCW) and emergency-PCCW (ePCCW) protocols variants can work on top of existing repetition protocols for serving as a passive collision warning mechanism in the MAC Layer. A full analytical derivation of the relative reliability and delay performances for all three PCCW, EPCCW and ePCCW protocols are provided, serving as intuitive performance evaluators. EPCCW employs the physical (PHY) layer to create <b>sub-slots</b> {{for the purpose of}} further increasing reliability by both avoiding and minimizing probability of collision at slots that would nominally fail. Analytical and simulation results of PCCW and EPCCW agree, and show a significant reduction in message failure rate versus the leading repetition protocols, especially under high collision scenarios up to 40 % at optimal, and 80 % at higher repetitions. Additionally, an improvement in average timeslots delay is observed, which facilitates improved vehicular safety messaging. ePCCW is particularly useful for emergency vehicle (EV) communications. This enhancement makes meeting stringent quality of service (QoS) requirements particularly prevalent in safety applications of DSRC systems. ePCCW show up to 77 % reliability improvement relative to a leading alternative is realized. Additionally, the proposed system is shown to have a decreased average timeslots delay that is well within acceptable delay threshold, and provides the best reliability in its class, which is key to safety messaging. In all our simulation results, we use our accurate Orthogonal Frequency Division (OFDM) MAC and physical (PHY) layer designs. The PHY layer simulator is a new object-oriented simulation environment, and is achieved using high-level design, parallelism and usability for the simulation environment. A high-level design and GUI layouts of the proposed simulator is shown in details. This can serve as a learning/research tool for students or practiced professionals to investigate particular designs. In addition, we provide a simple technique to implement simulation partitioning for increased parallel performance of reconfigurable object-oriented OFDM simulators. This simple technique applies to scenarios where there is disproportionate simulation duration between different OFDM configurations. It is shown to decrease total simulation time considerably. Additionally, we present a study on different demapping schemes at the PHY level. We propose the use of a linear demapper over a recently proposed non-linear demapper. The study is also presented under different decoding schemes of DSRC receivers. We also propose the use of equalization concepts in frequency domain that exploit the frequency domain channel matrix to combat inter-carrier interference (ICI) instead of inter-symbol interference (ISI) in DSRC systems. It is shown that the DSRC system with the frequency-domain equalization scheme achieves a considerable performance enhancement compared to both the conventional and the Viterbi-aided channel estimation schemes that try to combat ISI in terms of both Packet Error Rate (PER) and Bit Error Rate (BER) at relatively high and low velocities...|$|R
