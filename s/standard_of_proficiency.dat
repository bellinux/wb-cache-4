60|$|The {{instrument}} for {{enforcing the law}} could be no other than public examinations, extending to all children, and beginning at an early age. An age might be fixed at which every child must be examined, to ascertain if he (or she) is able to read. If a child proves unable, the father, unless he has some sufficient ground of excuse, might be subjected to a moderate fine, to be worked out, if necessary, by his labour, and the child might be put to school at his expense. Once in every year the examination should be renewed, with a gradually extending range of subjects, {{so as to make}} the universal acquisition, and what is more, retention, of a certain minimum of general knowledge, virtually compulsory. Beyond that minimum, there should be voluntary examinations on all subjects, at which all who come up to a certain <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>proficiency</b> might claim a certificate. To prevent the State from exercising, through these arrangements, an improper influence over opinion, the knowledge required for passing an examination (beyond the merely instrumental parts of knowledge, such as languages and their use) should, even in the higher class of examinations, be confined to facts and positive science exclusively. The examinations on religion, politics, or other disputed topics, should not turn on the truth or falsehood of opinions, but on the matter of fact that such and such an opinion is held, on such grounds, by such authors, or schools, or churches. Under this system, the rising generation would be no worse off in regard to all disputed truths, than they are at present; they would be brought up either churchmen or dissenters as they now are, the state merely taking care that they should be instructed churchmen, or instructed dissenters. There would be nothing to hinder them from being taught religion, if their parents chose, at the same schools where they were taught other things. All attempts by the state to bias the conclusions of its citizens on disputed subjects, are evil; but it may very properly offer to ascertain and certify that a person possesses the knowledge, requisite to make his conclusions, on any given subject, worth attending to. A student of philosophy would be the better for being able to stand an examination both in Locke and in Kant, whichever of the two he takes up with, or even if with neither: and there is no reasonable objection to examining an atheist in the evidences of Christianity, provided he is not required to profess a belief in them. The examinations, however, in the higher branches of knowledge should, I conceive, be entirely voluntary. It would be giving too dangerous a power to governments, were they allowed to exclude any one from professions, even from the profession of teacher, for alleged deficiency of qualifications: and I think, with Wilhelm von Humboldt, that degrees, or other public certificates of scientific or professional acquirements, should be given to all who present themselves for examination, and stand the test; but that such certificates should confer no advantage over competitors, other than the weight which may be attached to their testimony by public opinion.|$|E
60|$|It is also {{absolutely}} necessary that the examinations should be competitive, and the appointments given {{to those who}} are most successful. A mere pass examination never, in the long run, does more than exclude absolute dunces. When the question, in the mind of an examiner, lies between blighting the prospects of an individual and performing a duty to the public which, in the particular instance, seldom appears of first rate importance, and when he is sure to be bitterly reproached for doing the first, while in general no one will either know or care whether he has done the latter, the balance, unless {{he is a man of}} very unusual stamp, inclines to the side of good-nature. A relaxation in one instance establishes a claim to it in others, which every repetition of indulgence makes it more difficult to resist; each of these, in succession, becomes a precedent for more, until the <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>proficiency</b> sinks gradually to something almost contemptible. Examinations for degrees at the two great Universities have generally been as slender in their requirements as those for honors are trying and serious. Where there is no inducement to exceed a certain minimum, the minimum comes to be the maximum: it becomes the general practice not to aim at more; and as in every thing there are some who do not attain all they aim at, however low the standard may be pitched, there are always several who fall short of it. When, on the contrary, the appointments are given to those, among a great number of candidates, who most distinguish themselves, and where the successful competitors are classed in order of merit, not only each is stimulated to do his very utmost, but the influence is felt in every place of liberal education throughout the country. It becomes with every schoolmaster an object of ambition and an avenue to success to have furnished pupils who have gained a high place in these competitions, and there is hardly any other mode in which the state can do so much to raise the quality of educational institutions throughout the country. Though the principle of competitive examinations for public employment is of such recent introduction in this country, and is still so imperfectly carried out, the Indian service being as yet nearly the only case in which it exists in its completeness, a sensible effect has already begun to be produced on the places of middle-class education, notwithstanding the difficulties which the principle has encountered from the disgracefully low existing state of education in the country, which these very examinations have brought into strong light. So contemptible has the standard of acquirement been found to be, among the youths who obtain the nomination from the minister, which entitles them to offer themselves as candidates, that the competition of such candidates produces almost a poorer result than would be obtained from a mere pass examination; for no one would think of fixing the conditions of a pass examination so low as is actually found sufficient to enable a young man to surpass his fellow-candidates. Accordingly, it is said that successive years show on the whole a decline of attainments, less effort being made, because the results of former examinations have proved that the exertions then used were greater than would have been sufficient to attain the object. Partly from this decrease of effort, and partly because, even at the examinations which do not require a previous nomination, conscious ignorance reduces the number of competitors to a mere handful, it has so happened that though there have always been a few instances of great proficiency, the lower part of the list of successful candidates represents but a very moderate amount of acquirement; and we have it on the word of the commissioners that nearly all who have been unsuccessful have owed their failure to ignorance, not of the higher branches of instruction, but of its very humblest elements--spelling and arithmetic.|$|E

In 1799, returning to Belfast, he was transferred to the Presbytery of Antrim, and licensed on 9 April 1800. He at once received calls from First Holywood and Second Belfast, and accepting the latter was ordained on 26 Aug. 1800, the presiding minister being William Bryson v. He became popular, especially as a preacher of charity sermons, and dealt little in topics of controversy. On his marriage he opened a boarding-school at Mount Collyer, and lectured on natural philosophy, having among his pupils Thomas Romney Robinson, the astronomer. He was one of the first members of the Belfast Literary Society (founded 23 Oct. 1801), and contributed to its transactions several of his poems. Bishop Percy of Dromore sought his acquaintance, and obtained for him the degree of D.D. from Marischal College, Aberdeen (29 Jan. 1810). In 1815 he was an unsuccessful candidate for the chair of logic and belles-lettres in the Belfast Academical Institution, and on 15 Oct. in that year he was called to Strand Street, Dublin, as colleague to James Armstrong, D.D. Installed on 25 December, he entered on the chief charge of his long life. He was soon elected a member of the Royal Irish Academy, contributed frequently to its Transactions, held for many years the office of its librarian, and took a scholarly interest in Celtic literature. His poetical pieces, versified from ancient Irish sources, are graceful paraphrases rather than close translations. Most of his writings show traces of very wide reading.

40|$|The goal-setting {{theory of}} {{motivation}} is “the single most dominant {{theory in the}} field, with over a thousand articles and reviews published on the topic in over 35 years (Mitchell & Daniels, 2003, p. 231). The theory proposes that goals are the immediate regulators of behavior and setting specific and difficult goals leads to higher performance levels than general “do your best”, or easy goals. These effects are subject to two necessary conditions: goal commitment, and feedback on performance (Locke and Latham, 2002). In line with goal setting theory, social cognitive theory (Bandura, 2001) asserts that specific and high goals create negative discrepancies to be mastered, and this discrepancy mobilizes resources based on anticipatory estimates of what is necessary for goal attainment. The application of goal setting theory to the group level {{in the last decade}} confirmed that, similar to the effects at the individual level, group goals have a strong and positive effect on group performance (Latham and Pinder, 2005).

40|$|In {{learning}} a foreign language, the adult learner encounters great difficulties {{due to the}} already built-up competence of L 1 which grammatically, lexically and phonologically interferes with the competence of L 2. This causes performance errors which are difficult, if not impossible, to overcome. The main purpose of language teaching is to provide good language education, ideally striving for the “native-like control” of L 2 which characterizes bilingual individuals. In order to reach a high standard of language proficiency and accuracy in pronunciation, the learner {{should be considered as}} the place of the contact of L 1 and L 2, not simply as a potential L 2 -speaker. Often L 1 is considered only as an obstacle to the successful acquisition of L 2. In order to move to the new L 2 -milieu, the learner must pass the threshold which connects L 1 with L 2. In this paper, it is suggested that this threshold relates to phonetic input. The data involve cross-sectional research on a group of isolated German-Italian bilinguals. The study deals with the phonetic and prosodic interferences of Italian students, who, because of their high <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>proficiency</b> in German, may be considered fully bilingual. I compared the phonological interferences of two groups, beginners and students with high level L 2 competence (the result of bilingual education or advanced L 2 -learning) and I observed that in both groups the interference rate was very high. The interferences can be attributed to a lack of competence at the suprasegmental level, i. e. incompatible Italian intonational models being carried over into German. Phonetically and prosodically incorrect German sentences are not due to a deficit in the speakers’ phonatory apparatus, but simply to the fact that learners are not used to “hearing” the foreign sounds and intonation, i. e. they are not equipped to discriminate elements of German phonology and prosody. The discovery of the phonetic threshold in foreign language learning is the starting point of the Phonetic Input Threshold Hypothesis, which has lead to the Bilingual Educational Approach in Teaching Phonetics. Correct perception is attained starting with correct identification of L 2 -suprasegmentals, achieved by monitoring L 1 -suprasegmentals. This effect filters through to other levels resulting in correct prosody and segmentals...|$|E

The Employee Distinguished Service Award will be given to two employees each fiscal quarter. Employees are to be selected from nominations by the law school community at large, including ICLE, ICJE, the law library and all clinic programs. The winners for the July-September 2002 quarter were Sandra Osborn, ICLE, and Ebony Thompson, Dean Rusk Center. Excerpt from Sandra Osborn 2 ̆ 7 s Nomination I would like to nominate Sandra Osborn for the honor of being an outstanding employee. We all need to be flexible in our jobs; but she has been doing two jobs with a positive attitude. The Institute of Continuing Legal Education provides approximately 180 seminars a year. There are about 24, 000 attorneys in Georgia, and they each need 12 hours of continuing education yearly to keep their licenses. The speakers at ICLE seminars are, for the most part, volunteer and do not receive pay for participating in the seminar. Each speaker prepares a paper containing substantive materials to be presented at the seminar; there may be from 6 to 26 speakers at each program. ICLE currently has a vacancy for the job which entails paginating and preparing these papers for printing and binding in the ICLE print shop and giving page count information to the print shop so covers can be ordered and pricing can be determined. Though Sandra is publications mail supervisor, in charge of the shipping department, she has helped by doing this second job until the vacancy can be filled. Excerpt from Ebony Thompson 2 ̆ 7 s Nomination My nomination goes to Ebony Thompson, senior secretary at the Dean Rusk Center, who has shown exemplary professionalism, especially in her work with the International Judicial Training Program (IJTP). Ebony has worked at the Rusk Center {{for the last three years}} and serves as one of the coordinators of the IJTP. She is in charge of a great part of the logistical work of bringing judges and court personnel from around the world to the University of Georgia. Ms. Thompson does her work with intelligence, efficiency and with a careful eye for details. Her work reflects a higher <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>proficiency</b> and responsibility than the one dictated by the nature of her work.
