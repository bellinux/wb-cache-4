40|$|The dynamic {{viscoelastic}} {{properties of}} two liquid crystal States of cholesteryl myristate were studied. Cholesteryl myristate {{was selected as}} a material for study because it appears both {{in the form of}} a cholesteric liquid crystal or a smectic liquid crystal, depending on the temperature. At small strain amplitudes, the dynamic viscoelastic properties were measured by means of a coaxial cylinder rheometer in the angular frequency range 0. 25 - 2. 96 s- 1 and in the temperature range 70 - 83 °C. Hysteresis loops for the cholesteric state change with frequency and show a non-linear pattern at the higher frequencies. Both the storage modulus G' and the loss modulus G" for the cholesteric state change with frequency. On the contrary, the absolute dynamic modulus | G | for the <b>smectic</b> <b>state</b> does not change with frequency and the smectic liquid crystal behaves as an elastic solid. At large strain amplitudes, the dynamic viscoelastic properties were measured by means of a cone-plate rheometer in the angular frequency range 0. 135 - 5. 39 s- 1 and in the temperature range 90 - 50 °C. Hysteresis loops for this material at a fixed frequency change with temperature. The hysteresis loops for the cholesteric state are elliptical, which is a typical linear viscoelastic response, but for the <b>smectic</b> <b>state</b> they are very much distorted. It has been pointed out that the dynamic behavior of liquid crystals is strongly affected by their mechanical histories. Even cholesteric liquid crystals show liquid-like behaviors after many cycles of sinusoidal strain. Although such rheotropic phenomena are very complicated ones, preliminary studies indicate that they are more evident in the cholesteric state than in the <b>smectic</b> <b>state.</b> Data were compared after 10 cycles of sinusoidal strain at a frequency of 0. 27 s- 1. The dissipation energy ED for the cholesteric stste increases with frequency in a somewhat different way from that for the <b>smectic</b> <b>state.</b> E 0 D at zero frequency for the <b>smectic</b> <b>state</b> decreases with increasing temperature, whereas E 0 D for cholesteric state decreases with decreasing temperature...|$|E
40|$|The phase {{diagrams}} of two {{mixtures of}} chemically similar smectogenic mesogens strongly differing in molecular length were investigated. In these mixtures the nematic phase {{present in the}} pure short mesogen disappeared rapidly on {{the addition of the}} longer mesogen, while the <b>smectic</b> <b>state</b> was preserved. In the <b>smectic</b> <b>state</b> the smectic A phase was the much more stable phase as the smectic C phase disappeared quite rapidly as well. In these compounds the loss of the smectic C phase is accompanied by a decrease in smectic translational order and very small tilt angles. This leads to a concentration induced smectic C to smectic A transition. Thus smectic A seems to be the most stable phase to accommodate mesogenic molecules of substantially different length. These surprising results are of general interest for the understanding of the structure and dynamics of smectic phases, as the structure of these bidisperse smectics is signified by extensive out-of-layer fluctuations...|$|E

G. de Gennes, An analogy between superconductors and smectics A, Solid State Commun. 10 (1972) 753 – 756], the second author introduced the critical wave number Qc 3 (which is an analog of the upper critical field Hc 3 for superconductors) and predicted {{the existence of a}} surface <b>smectic</b> <b>state,</b> which was supposed to be an analogy of the surface superconducting state. In a surface <b>smectic</b> <b>state,</b> the bulk liquid crystal is in the nematic state, and a thin layer of smectic appears in a helical strip {{on the surface of the}} sample. In this paper we study an approximate form of the Landau–de Gennes model of liquid crystals, and examine the behavior of minimizers, in particular the boundary layer behavior. Our work shows the importance of the joint chirality constant qτ, which is the product of wave number q and chirality τ and also appears in the work of [P. Bauman, M. Calderer, C. Liu, D. Phillips, The phase transition between chiral nematic and smectic A∗ liquid crystals, Arch. Rational Mech. Anal. 165 (2002) 161 – 186] and [X. B. Pan, Landau–de Gennes model of liquid crystals and critical wave number, Comm. Math. Phys. 239 (1 – 2) (2003) 343 – 382]. The joint chirality constant of a liquid crystal is useful to predict whether the liquid crystal is of type I or type II, and it is also useful to examine whether the liquid crystal is in a surface <b>smectic</b> <b>state.</b> The results in this paper suggest that a liquid crystal with large Ginzburg–Landau parameter κ and large joint chirality constant qτ exhibits type II behavior, and it will be in the surface <b>smectic</b> <b>state</b> if qτ∼bκ 2 for some β 0 <b< 1, where β 0 is the lowest eigenvalue of the Schrödinger operator with a unit magnetic field in the half space, and 0 <β 0 < 1.

From these observations, we propose a Ginzburg-Landau functional describing this coupling and demonstrate how it can explain the coexistence of the smectic and intra-unit-cell broken symmetries and also correctly predict their interplay at the atomic scale.

40|$|The {{physical}} {{states and}} phase {{behavior of the}} lipids of the spleen, liver, and splenic artery from a 38 -yr-old man with Tangier disease were studied.

The droplets within individual cells melted sharply over a narrow temperature range, indicating a uniform lipid composition of the droplets of each cell.

40|$|There {{is a great}} {{interest}} in smectic materials that show no layer shrinkage (NLS) in the transition from smectic A to smectic C. Such materials are often discussed in terms of ode Vries materialso or ode Vries behavioro after A. de Vries, who proposed different mechanisms for this NLS behavior, involving a significant tilt of the individual molecules in the smectic A phase. According to the original proposition of de Vries, the molecules are already tilted in this kind of smectic A phase, with a large constant tilt and the same tilt direction in each layer but random tilt direction between different layers. Despite the individual molecular tilt the smectic A phase remains uniaxial and the transition to the biaxial <b>smectic</b> C <b>state</b> is seen as a global ordering in the tilt directions. The model thus ad hoc predicts that there is zero layer shrinkage at the A - C transition. We refer to this model as the ohollow cone distributiono. As later pointed out by de Vries there are, however, other possible models for describing a tilt disorder (thermodynamically unavoidable) in the A phase. Nevertheless, the hollow cone has been a widely accepted model in the literature and is repeatedly referred to in discussing de Vries behavior or even taken as a basis for theories describing it. We discuss different smectic A orientational distribution functions that could be related to de Vries behavior or de Vries transitions. We find that two opposite models have comparable predictive power but only one gives a consistent picture together with existing data. Our conclusion is that the smectic A - smectic C transition can have a continuously changing character from a opure tilto to a opure de Vrieso, and we illustrate the orientational distribution functions in the A and C phases for these two limiting cases. We find that de Vries behavior is not related to any exotic distribution of hollow cone or similar kind in the A phase, but instead to an unusual combination of low nematic order and high smectic order in the de Vries smectic A. As the technical interest in such materials is considerable, a directed effort toward the synthesis of new optimized materials would be important...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that liquid {{crystalline}} compounds with a cyano terminal group can present peculiar polymorphisms in particular different types of smectic A mesophases and a reentrant behaviour for both nematic and smectic A mesophases. In this work we study by proton NMR relaxation the influence of these features on the molecular dynamics of the compound 4 -cyanobenzoate- 4 '-octylbenzoyloxyphenyl (DB 8 CN Sym) in its nematic (N), partial bilayer smectic A (SAd), reentrant nematic (Nre) and reentrant smectic A (SA 1) mesophases. Standard and fast field-cycling techniques were used for our spin-lattice relaxation's study over a broad frequency range of 6 decades (200 Hz up to 300 MHz). It was found that the molecular dynamics in the nematic mesophases is rather different from the molecular dynamics in the smectic A mesophases. However, the reentrant aspect present in both nematic and <b>smectic</b> A <b>states</b> is not associated to a major difference on the molecular dynamics of the nematic and reentrant nematic or smectic and reentrant smectic A mesophases. Order director fluctuations and rotations/reorientations are the most important relaxation mechanisms in the nematic mesophases in the lower and higher frequency limits, respectively, while self-diffusion has a very small contribution to the overall relaxation. As for the smectic A mesophases, self-diffusion and rotations/reorientations are the predominant relaxation mechanisms for frequencies above 20  kHz. The collective motions, which for these mesophases have to be associated with layer undulations with the frequency law T 1 ∼ν, are only important to the spin-lattice relaxation on the low part of the frequency spectrum (ν< 10  kHz). The inclusion in the relaxation study of a contribution from the cross-relaxation between protons and nitrogen nuclei improves the quality of the 1 /T 1 data fits in both kinds of mesophases. The combined study of the molecular dynamics in the N, SAd, Nre and SA 1 mesophases of DB 8 CN Sym reveals {{that it is necessary to}} consider one more contribution to the relaxation in the analysis of the 1 /T 1 data in the SAd and high temperature N mesophases. This contribution is associated with a dynamic process of dissociation and recombination of molecules in groups that could be present in this kind of systems as predicted in the literature to explain the layer thickness detected in the SAd mesophases. The characteristic time for this process was estimated...|$|R

40|$|We {{review the}} {{depinning}} and nonequilibrium phases of collectively interacting particle systems driven over random or periodic substrates. This {{type of system}} is relevant to vortices in type-II superconductors, sliding charge density waves, electron crystals, colloids, stripe and pattern forming systems, and skyrmions, and could also have connections to jamming, glassy behaviors, and active matter. These systems are ideal for exploring the broader issues of characterizing transient and steady state nonequilibrium flow phases as well as nonequilibrium phase transitions between distinct dynamical phases, analogous to phase transitions between different equilibrium states. We discuss elastic and plastic depinning on random substrates and {{the different types of}} nonequilibrium phases that produce features in the velocity-force curves, fluctuation spectra, scaling relations, and local or global particle ordering. We describe how these quantities change depending on dimension, anisotropy, disorder strength, and the presence of hysteresis. Within the moving phase we discuss transitions from a liquid-like state to dynamically ordered moving crystal, <b>smectic,</b> or nematic <b>states.</b> Systems with periodic or quasiperiodic substrates can have multiple nonequilibrium transitions in the moving state between chaotic and coherent phases, and can exhibit hysteresis. We also discuss systems with competing repulsive and attractive interactions, which undergo dynamical transitions into stripes and other complex morphologies when driven over random substrates. Throughout this work we highlight open issues and future directions such as absorbing phase transitions, nonequilibrium work relations, inertia, the role of non-dissipative dynamics such as Magnus effects, and how these results could be extended to the broader issues of plasticity in crystals, amorphous solids, and jamming phenomena.

For fillings greater than four, shell and ring structures form at each potential minimum and can exhibit sample-wide orientational order. A disordered state can appear between ordered states as the substrate strength varies. Under an external drive, the onsets of different orderings produce clear changes in the critical depinning force, including a peak effect phenomenon that has generally only previously been observed in systems with random substrates. We also find a rich variety of dynamic ordering transitions that can be observed via changes in the structure factor and features in the velocity-force curves. The dynamical states encompass a variety of moving structures including one-dimensional stripes, <b>smectic</b> ordering, polycrystalline <b>states,</b> triangular lattices, and symmetry locking states. Despite the complexity of the system, we identify several generic features of the dynamical phase transitions which we map out in a series of phase diagrams. Our results have implications for the structure and depinning of colloids on periodic substrates, vortices in superconductors and Bose-Einstein condensates, Wigner crystals, and dusty plasmas.

40|$|To {{determine}} the physical state of lipids in tendon xanthomata, six specimens surgically removed from three patients with familial hypercholesterolemia were studied by microscopy, calorimetry, and x-ray diffraction. The major constituents of the xanthomata were lipid (33 % of dry weight) and collagen (24 % of dry weight). The principal lipids were cholesterol ester and cholesterol. Light microscopy and thin-section electron microscopy showed occasional clusters of foam cells separated by masses of extracellular collagen. Polarized light microscopy of fresh, minced tissue showed rare droplets of free cholesterol ester. When heated, the tissue shrank abruptly at approximately equal to 70 degrees C and, consequently, {{a large amount}} of cholesterol ester was released. Scanning calorimetry of fresh pieces of xanthoma showed a single, broad, reversible liquid crystalline transition of cholesterol ester with peak temperature from 32 to 38 degrees C. The enthalpy (0971 +/- 0. 07 cal/g) was reduced compared with the isolated cholesterol ester from each xanthoma (1. 1 +/- 0. 01 cal/g). There was a large irreversible collagen denaturation endotherm (peak temperature = 67 degrees C; enthalpy 9. 9 cal/g collagen) that corresponded to the tissue shrinkage noted by microscopy. After the collagen denaturation, the sample displayed double-peaked reversible liquid crystalline transitions of cholesterol ester, of enthalpy 1. 18 +/- 0. 1 cal/g, that were identical to transitions of isolated cholesterol ester. Fibers dissected fron xanthomata were examined by X-ray diffraction at temperatures below and above the cholesterol ester transition. At 20 degrees C there was a weakly oriented equatorial reflection of Bragg spacing 36 A, which corresponded to the smectic phase of cholesterol ester, and a series of oriented collagen reflections. At 42 degrees C the cholesterol ester reflection disappeared. Stretched fibers examined at 10 degrees C showed good orientation of collagen and cholesterol ester reflections, and in addition, meridional spacings which indicated oriented crystallization of cholesterol ester. These studies suggest that a major component of tendon xanthomata is extracellular cholesterol ester which displays altered melting and molecular orientation {{as a result of an}} interaction with collagen. At xanthoma temperatures, the cholesterol ester is in a <b>smectic</b> liquid crystalline <b>state,</b> probably layered between collagen fibrils, with the long axis of the cholesterolester molecules perpendicular to the axis of the collagen fiber. Such collagen-cholesterol ester interactions may favor the extracellular deposition of cholesterol ester derived either from intracellular sources or directly from plasma lipoproteins...|$|R
