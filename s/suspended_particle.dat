This is because they are less reliant than D. maxima and S. giganteus on the current for suspension feeding. In comparison, all four species studied showed substrate preference. The distribution of the suspension feeders studied showed varying dependence on current and substrate type.

Therefore, the aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the changes in the physical and biological characteristics of <b>suspended</b> <b>particles</b> during residence in the full scale surface flow constructed wetland. The constructed wetland consists of unvegetated ponds and reed beds and receives treated municipal wastewater containing low concentrations of <b>suspended</b> <b>particles.</b> It was found that residence in the unvegetated ponds caused no major changes in particle concentration, but the organic content (53 - 33 %) and average size (4. 3 - 3. 7 μm) of the <b>suspended</b> <b>particles</b> did decrease, caused by sedimentation of large organic particles and addition of smaller inorganic particles most likely resulting from shore erosion. The bacterial species originating from the wastewater treatment plant (quantified by indicator organisms) decreased strongly in abundance (> 90 % reduction), especially during residence in the reed beds. Simultaneously the total abundance of bacteria gradually increased, indicating the replacement of the bacterial species present in the treated wastewater with other species during residence in the constructed wetland.
