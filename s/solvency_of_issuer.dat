40|$|International audienceThis paper {{proposes a}} {{portfolio}} choice model with two countries {{to evaluate the}} specific role of volatility and co-volatility risks {{in the formation of}} long-term European interest rates over the crisis and post-crisis periods with an active role of the European Central Bank. Long-term equilibrium rates depend crucially on the covariances between international bond yields anticipated by investors. Positively anticipated covariances amplify the phenomena of fundamental contagions related to the degradations of public finance and <b>solvency</b> <b>of</b> sovereign debt <b>issuer,</b> while negatively anticipated covariances amplify the phenomena of Flight-to-quality. The two-step econometric approach over the period January 2006 to September 2016 analyses 21 European market pairs in a bivariate GARCH framework. Empirical results show that the decline in German and French long-term rates from March 2011 is partially due to the decrease in both risk premium and covariances with periphery countries. These declines actually amplify the mechanisms of Flight-to-quality. Finally, a lower sensitivity of rate to volatility and co-volatility risks during the crisis period gives credit to the hypothesis of a occasional fragmentation of the European sovereign bond market...|$|R

In the result of the study the article systemises and considers the conduct of the credit process of Ukrainian commercial banks. It becomes clear from result of the study {{that it is impossible to}} obtain a single assessment <b>of</b> <b>solvency</b> <b>of</b> a borrower with generalisation of numerical and non-numerical data. Assessment of qualified analysts is required for a justified assessment <b>of</b> <b>solvency</b> apart from information represented in numbers. Improvement of approaches to assessment <b>of</b> <b>solvency</b> <b>of</b> borrowers and adaptation of the existing foreign experience in this field to specific features <b>of</b> formation <b>of</b> <b>solvency</b> <b>of</b> Ukrainian borrowers are important tasks for the Ukrainian banking system. Prospects of further studies in this direction are establishment of importance of the conduct of business analysis and its key role in assessment <b>of</b> <b>solvency</b> <b>of</b> borrowers as a main instrument of minimisation of the credit risk. Improvement of this sphere of analytical work in Ukrainian banks should be carried out in the following main directions: study and analysis of qualitative indicators of business activity; analysis of main sections of the business plan; expansion of the composition of indicators of the financial analysis for obtaining information; conduct of analysis of possible sources of repayment of loan liabilities; and active use of analysis of cash flows of an enterprise...|$|R

40|$|The equity {{portfolio}} selection {{problem is the}} subject of a substantial literature. Though equally important in practice, the optimization problem for a fixed-income portfolio, which may contain corporate and government bonds, industrial loans and credit derivatives such as credit swaps, is less well-understood. The fixed-income portfolio problem presents unique challenges: the risk <b>of</b> <b>issuer</b> default induces skewed return distributions, the correlation of defaults significantly influences portfolio returns, and credit derivative positions have complex risk/return implications. This paper formulates and solves the static selection problem for a fixed-income portfolio. It proposes to optimize the portfolio mark-to-market profit or loss at the investment horizon, which incorporates the premium and default cash flows of long and short cash and derivative positions, and the survival-contingent market value of these positions at the horizon. The selection problem is cast as a polynomial goal program that involves a two-stage constrained optimization of preference weighted moments of the portfolio mark-to-market. The decision variable is the vector of contract notionals. A capital constraint guarantees the <b>solvency</b> <b>of</b> the portfolio manager during the investment period. The multi-moment formulation takes account of the non-normal distribution of the portfolio mark-to-market. It also leads to a computationally tractable problem for the large portfolio...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{relationship}} between the types <b>of</b> <b>issuer</b> and the governance codes contents in the neo-institutional social theory perspective, using a global sample of over 70 national governance codes. We hypothesize that the code recommendations are influenced by the nature of isomorphic pressure to embrace new social practices, exerted by the different types <b>of</b> <b>issuer.</b> The findings show that codes issued involving multiple stakeholders’ groups and organizations into hybrid committees are more likely to: (1) include recommendations that take into account multiple political and social institutional demands; (2) adapt the mainstream agency-theory-based governance model to the national setting features. Overall, the policy-making negotiations among different stakeholders’ groups in the local institutional setting appear to be determinant in shaping the code recommendations and in improving the promotion of good governance practices among firms. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to systematically investigate {{the relationship between}} the types <b>of</b> <b>issuer</b> and the codes contents. ...|$|R
