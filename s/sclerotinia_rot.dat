The causal agent of the disease was identified as Sclerotinia nivalis based on cultural characteristics and sequence analyses of the internal transcribed spacer region of rDNA and β-tubulin gene with 100 % sequence similarity. Pathogenicity tests were performed on 2 -year-old ginseng roots with mycelium plugs without wounds. A watery soft rot of the roots and black sclerotia were observed 10 days after inoculation. These symptoms were identical to those observed on naturally infected roots. The same fungus was re-isolated from the lesions induced by artificial inoculation.

40|$|During {{growing season}} of 2011 to 2013, <b>Sclerotinia</b> <b>rot</b> {{symptoms}} consistently {{have been observed}} on basil in Yesan-gun, Chungcheongnam-do in Korea. The typical symptom formed initially brownish spot on leaf and stem, and then advancing margins, wilting the whole plant and blighting, eventually died. On the surface of diseased lesions was observed cottony, white, dense mat of mycelial growth, and sclerotia (30 – 100 µm diameter) formed on stem and leaf. Morphological and cultural characteristic on potato dextrose agar, color of colony was white and colorless chocolate, sclerotium of irregular shape of the oval was black and 5 – 50 µm diameter in size. In pathogenicity test, necrosis and wilt of the inoculated stem were observed in all plants and the pathogen was reisolated from stems. On the basis of mycological characteristics, pathogenicity, and internal transcribed spacer rDNA sequence analysis, this fungus was identified as Sclerotinia sclerotiorum.

40|$|Abstract: The {{epidemiology}} of <b>sclerotinia</b> <b>rot</b> of carrot {{was investigated}} on carrot ‘Cellobunch ’ during 1999 and 2000 in Ontario. Apothecia were first {{detected in the}} crop in early August to mid-September, after the carrot canopy closed and after 7 – 11 days with soil matric potentials between – 0. 1 and – 0. 4 bars and soil temperatures between 14 and 23 °C. Ascospores were first detected in mid-July to mid-August, usually before apothecia were observed in the crop, and after 7 – 12 days with soil matric potentials between – 0. 1 and – 0. 3 bars and air temperatures between 15 and 21 °C. The numbers of apothecia and ascospores were positively correlated with soil matric potential. Preharvest epidemics started in mid-August to mid-September, after the closure and lodging of the canopy, after the appearance of senescing leaves on the soil and ascospores in the crop, and after rain had initiated 12 – 24 h per day of leaf surface wetness. Disease incidence was negatively correlated with air and soil temperatures. Postharvest epidemics in storage followed preharvest epidemics in the field, but not all preharvest epidemics resulted in disease in storage. It is suggested that severe epidemics of <b>sclerotinia</b> <b>rot</b> of carrot can occur in storage when disease in the field progresses rapidly and is associated with soil matric potentials of ≥– 0. 2 bars and leaf wetness of ≥ 14 h per day, particularly close to harvest.

40|$|Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, {{the causal}} agent of <b>Sclerotinia</b> stem <b>rot,</b> is a devastating fungal {{pathogen}} of soybean {{that can cause}} significant yield losses to growers when environmental conditions are favorable for the disease. The development of resistant varieties has proven difficult. However, poor resistance in commercial cultivars can be improved through additional breeding efforts and understanding the genetic basis of resistance. The objective of this project was to develop soybean germplasm lines that have {{a high level of}} <b>Sclerotinia</b> stem <b>rot</b> resistance to be used directly as cultivars or in breeding programs as a source of improved <b>Sclerotinia</b> stem <b>rot</b> resistance. <b>Sclerotinia</b> stem rot-resistant soybean germplasm was developed by crossing two sources of resistance, W 04 - 1002 and AxN- 1 - 55, with lines exhibiting resistance to Heterodera glycines and Cadophora gregata in addition to favorable agronomic traits. Following greenhouse evaluations of 1, 076 inbred lines derived from these crosses, 31 lines were evaluated for resistance in field tests during the 2014 field season. Subsequently, 11 <b>Sclerotinia</b> stem <b>rot</b> resistant breeding lines were moved forward for field evaluation in 2015, and seven elite breeding lines were selected and evaluated in the 2016 field season. To better understand resistance mechanisms, a marker analysis was conducted to identify quantitative trait loci linked to resistance. Thirteen markers associated with <b>Sclerotinia</b> stem <b>rot</b> resistance were identified on chromosomes 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19. Our markers confirm previously reported chromosomal regions associated with <b>Sclerotinia</b> stem <b>rot</b> resistance as well as a novel region of chromosome 16. The seven elite germplasm lines were also re-evaluated within a greenhouse setting using a cut petiole technique with multiple S. sclerotiorum isolates to test the durability of physiological resistance of the lines in a controlled environment. This work presents a novel and comprehensive classical breeding method for selecting lines with physiological resistance to <b>Sclerotinia</b> stem <b>rot</b> and a range of agronomic traits.

A total of 196 bacterial isolates were isolated using serial dilution method. In dual culture assay in vitro, 26 isolates showed more than 80 % of inhibition rates of mycelial growth of S. sclerotiorum. Based on 16 S rDNA sequence analysis, the 26 isolates were identified as Bacillus megaterium, B. cereus, B. subtilis, Arthrobacter nicotianae, A. ramosus, Pseudomonas filiscindens, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Brevibacterium frigoritolerans and Sphingobacterium faecium.

In 2015, China proposed a “two-reduction” strategy, i.e. reducing the application of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, which aims to fight against pollution problem in agriculture and improve food safety in China. Biocontrol agents are becoming increasingly important in achieving these goals while simultaneously enhancing crop production. However, some problems such as relatively low efficiency and instability of biopesticides have limited their development so far (Kredics et al. 2003; Slusarski and Pietr 2009). More biocontrol agents with high efficiency will be obtained with genetic improvement. In this study, we overexpressed the endochitinase-encoding gene Chi 67 - 1 in the biocontrol fungus C. rosea 67 - 1 through protoplast transformation, selected several transformed strains with increased Chi 67 - 1 expression, chitinase production and parasitic ability, and evaluated their ability to protect against <b>Sclerotinia</b> <b>rot</b> of soybean in greenhouse experiments.

This study also evaluated the chemical, fungicidal and microbial control of white mold or <b>Sclerotinia</b> stem <b>rot</b> of soybean in the field. Three experiments were conducted, as follows: 1) inhibition of carpogenic germination of sclerotia, 2) inhibition of ascospore germination, and 3) control of <b>Sclerotinia</b> stem <b>rot</b> in a soybean crop under field conditions. The treatments evaluated were fluazinam, procymidone, iprodione, thiophanate-methyl, carbendazim, benzalkonium chloride + fluazinam, and T. harzianum. Procymidone resulted in an inhibition of 13. 5 % and benzalkonium chloride in an inhibition of 13. 9 % in an ascospore germination test.

Anatomical investigations revealed impeded fungal growth (at 24 hpi and onwards) and hyphal disintegration only on resistant Charlton. Temporal changes (12, 24, 48 and 72 hpi) in protein profile showed certain enzymes up-regulated only in resistant Charlton, such as those related to primary metabolic pathways, antioxidant defence, ethylene biosynthesis, pathogenesis related proteins, protein synthesis and protein folding, play a role in mediating defence responses against S. sclerotiorum.

Simulations using - 1 revealed {{an increase in the}} escape fraction with increasing wind speed, and an order-of-magnitude fall with increases in LAI from values typical of a closely grazed sheep pasture (ca. 2) to those of more laxly grazed cattle pastures and intact grassland (ca. 7).

40|$|Life cycle, symptoms, {{and control}} {{measures}} of <b>sclerotinia</b> stem <b>rot</b> of soybeans is discussed. <b>Sclerotinia</b> stem <b>rot</b> of soybeans {{is caused by}} the fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. This pathogen has an extremely wide host range and can affect more than 400 plant species, including oilseed, vegetable and forage legume crops. S. sclerotiorum has caused a disease known as white mold on dry edible beans in western Nebraska for 40 years, but it did not become a problem in soybeans until the 1990 s. This fungal pathogen can be found on soybeans in Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and North Dakota. Stem rot outbreaks in soybeans recently have become more frequent in eastern Nebraska. In other states, outbreaks usually occur in fields which have previously been rotated with a susceptible crop such as sunflower, dry bean or potato. Cereals such as corn and wheat and other monocots are not hosts for this fungus, but weeds such as pigweed and wild sunflower can become infected. In Nebraska the current increase in disease severity {{can be explained by the}} recent cool, wet summers which favored disease development in susceptible crops and weeds, leaving more inoculum to infect the soybean crop. Continuous soybeans would enhance inoculum and subsequent infection...|$|R
40|$|<b>Sclerotinia</b> stem <b>rot</b> {{is a major}} disease on winter {{oilseed rape}} which causes severe yield losses twice a decade. Chemical control is usually applied at the {{beginning}} of flowering stage, every year. Because of a reduced use of chemicals expected, a biological control agent as Coniothyrium minitans could be usefull for controlling the disease. Experiments have mainly been carried out with Contans® WG, a ready-for-use formulation of C. minitans. Firstly effectiveness of C. minitans against sclerotia of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum was demonstrated. Then, its use on oilseed rape crops has been studied for several years in large size experimental plots. When it is incorporated into soil, C. minitans reduced the soil infestation by destroying sclerotia. By decreasing the soil infestation, C. minitans also reduced the primary inoculum pressure. Thus it allowed to reduce the sclerotinia risk and the disease incidence. The results are discussed according to the decision support system CETIOM in progress. Thus, a reduction of sclerotinia risk underneath a decision threshold in treated field plots could prevent any further spray of fungicides. However, it can be needed to apply fungicides which are more efficient when the disease pressure is reduced. These results contribute to integrate the use of Contans® WG in the disease management of <b>sclerotinia</b> stem <b>rot</b> of oilseed rape...|$|R
50|$|Iprodion {{is used on}} crops {{affected}} by Botrytis bunch <b>rot,</b> Brown <b>rot,</b> <b>Sclerotinia</b> and other fungal diseases in plants. It is currently applied {{in a variety of}} crops: fruit, vegetables, ornamental trees and scrubs and on lawns. It is a contact fungicide that inhibits the germination of fungal spores and it blocks the growth of the fungal mycelium.|$|R
40|$|Evaluation of {{the wild}} {{sunflower}} germplasms indicated that most perennial wild species, including diploid, tetraploid and hexaploid, possess high level of resistance to <b>Sclerotinia</b> stalk <b>rot.</b> Selected resistant wild species were crossed with cultivated sunflower to transfer Sclerotinia resistance genes, though the frequency of successful crosses was relatively low. Hexaploid H. californicus was crossed with HA 410, a moderately stalk rot tolerant inbred line, and repeatedly backcrossed to BC 4 F 1 from 2005 to 2007, with an accompanying chromosome number reduction from 2 n= 68 of the F 1 hybrid to 2 n= 34 in the BC 4 F 1. Accordingly, pollen fertility was increased from 4. 6 % (BC 1 F 1), 31. 3 % (BC 2 F 1), 38. 5 % (BC 3 F 1) to 73. 9 % in BC 4 F 1 generation, and the corresponding seed set for BC 1 F 1, BC 2 F 1, BC 3 F 1, and BC 4 F 1 were 0. 05 %, 3. 35 %, 11. 9 %, and 35. 3 %, respectively. Currently, of the 79 BC 4 F 1 plants, 14 plants have a chromosome number of 2 n= 34 and are ready for seed increase for field testing in 2009 and the 23 plants with 2 n= 35 can be self-pollinated one more time to reach 2 n= 34. Crosses between five selected interspecific amphiploids and HA 410 were successful obtaining 145 BC 2 F 1 plants. Of these, 47 plants with 2 n= 34 are available for seed increase for field testing and 50 plants with 2 n= 35 will be self-pollinated or backcrossed before being increased for field testing. Three perennial diploid species H. maximiliani, H. giganteus, and H. grosseserratus, highly resistant to <b>Sclerotinia</b> stalk <b>rot,</b> were used as pollen donors to cross with NMS HA 89. In total, 67 hybrid seedlings were obtained with all having very low pollen fertility around 1 %. All F 1 plants were backcrossed with HA 410 in the greenhouse, which resulted in 155 BC 1 seeds from 64, 618 pollinated florets. Continued backcrossing and self-pollination of 2 n= 34 progeny plants derived from wild diploid, amphiploid and hexaploid sources will generate {{a large number of}} lines for field evaluation for resistance to <b>Sclerotinia</b> stalk <b>rot</b> in 2009...|$|R
30|$|In vitro assays {{showed that}} most transformants {{exhibited}} a higher parasitic ability against sclerotia {{compared to the}} wild type strain. However, in pot experiments, only one transformant, Rc 4 - 4, exhibited a much higher ability to control soybean <b>Sclerotinia</b> stem <b>rot.</b> This {{might be due to}} various antagonistic mechanisms other than a single pattern of mycoparasitism. The management of plant diseases with C. rosea involves several mechanisms such as mycoparasitism, antagonist action, induced resistance, and competition, which enhance the performance of the biocontrol fungus (Mouekouba et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2008). In addition, colonization of the biocontrol isolates on plants during the growing season can also greatly affect the control efficiency (Vallance et al. 2009).|$|R
40|$|Based on {{evaluations}} {{over two}} years, interspecific amphiploids are useful sources of resistance genes for both <b>Sclerotinia</b> stem <b>rot</b> and head rot. Interspecific amphiploids between wild perennial Helianthus gracilentus, H. hirsutus, H. strumosus, H. grosseserratus, H. maximiliani, and H. nuttallii, crossed with P 21, plus one intercrossed amphiploid involving H. divaricatus and H. grosseserratus were evaluated. The {{results indicated that}} most amphiploids were more resistant to stem rot and head rot than the tolerant checks HA 410 and HA 441, respectively. The good F 1 seed set between the amphiploids and HA 410 or HA 441 provided {{a sufficient number of}} plants for further backcrossing and chromosome reduction toward the 2 n= 34 of the cultivated sunflower...|$|R
