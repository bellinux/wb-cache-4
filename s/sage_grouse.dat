5|$|Over 300 {{species of}} birds have been sighted in the park {{including}} the calliope hummingbird, the smallest bird species in North America, as well as trumpeter swans, which is North America's largest waterfowl. In addition to trumpeter swans, another 30 species of waterfowl have been recorded including blue-winged teal, common merganser, American wigeon and the colorful but reclusive harlequin duck which is occasionally spotted in Cascade Canyon. Both bald and golden eagles and other birds of prey such as the osprey, red-tailed hawk, American kestrel and occasional sightings of peregrine falcon have been reported. Of the 14 species of owls reported, the most common is the great horned owl, though the boreal owl and great grey owl are also seen occasionally. A dozen species of woodpeckers have been reported, as have a similar number of species of warblers, plovers and gulls. The vocal and gregarious black-billed magpie frequents campgrounds while Steller's jay and Clark's nutcracker {{are found in the}} backcountry. The sage covered plains of Jackson Hole are favored areas for <b>sage</b> <b>grouse,</b> Brewer's sparrow and sage thrashers, while the wetlands are frequented by great blue heron, American white pelican, sandhill crane and on rare occasions it's endangered relative, the whooping crane.|$|E
25|$|Since {{half of all}} {{remaining}} <b>sage</b> <b>grouse</b> {{habitat is}} on private lands, the USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service launched the , a partnership-based, science-driven, Farm Bill-funded effort that uses voluntary incentives to proactively conserve America’s western rangelands, wildlife, and rural way of life. The <b>Sage</b> <b>Grouse</b> Initiative has partnered with 1,500+ ranchers across 11 states since 2010, conserving 5.5 million acres of <b>sage</b> <b>grouse</b> habitat (twice the size of Yellowstone National Park).|$|E
2500|$|Facing a court-ordered {{deadline}} of October 2015, the Department of the Interior on September 22, 2015, {{decided not to}} list the bird as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). As rationale for its decision, the Department said it would rely on a new land-management plan to protect the <b>sage</b> <b>grouse’s</b> habitat of 165 million acres across eleven Western states. The designation under the ESA would likely have led to land-use and other restrictions that critics feared would have economic impacts, possibly restricting oil and gas development and homebuilding.

50|$|The Idaho dunes tiger beetle (Cicindela arenicola), {{a species}} of special concern, is found on refuge sand dunes, while the Utah valvata, an {{endangered}} snail, inhabits the reservoir. Both <b>sage</b> and sharptailed <b>grouse</b> occupy refuge habitat that is becoming increasingly important {{in the face of}} petitions to list these species.|$|R
25|$|The greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) is {{the largest}} grouse (a bird species) in North America. Its range is sagebrushcountry in the western United States and {{southern}} Alberta and Saskatchewan, Canada. It was known as simply the <b>sage</b> <b>grouse</b> until the Gunnison sage-grouse was recognized as a separate species in 2000. The Mono Basin population of <b>sage</b> <b>grouse</b> may also be distinct.|$|E
25|$|Males {{gather in}} leks to court, usually in late February to April. Only a few {{dominant}} males, usually two, breed. <b>Sage</b> <b>grouse</b> mating behaviors are complex. After mating, the hen leaves the lek for the nesting grounds.|$|E
25|$|The ranch {{supports}} {{a wide variety}} of wildlife including mule deer, pronghorn antelope, coyote, American badger, jackrabbits, squirrels, and chipmunks. Bird species native to the area include <b>sage</b> <b>grouse,</b> mountain quail, mountain chickadees, pygmy nuthatch, great horned owls, hawks, and golden eagles.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sage</b> <b>grouse</b> lack {{a muscular}} gizzard and cannot grind and digest seeds; they must consume soft-tissue foods. Apart from sagebrush, the adult diet {{consists}} largely of herbaceous leaves, {{which are used}} primarily in late spring and summer. Additionally, greater sage-grouse use perennial bunchgrasses for food.|$|E
25|$|Many {{species of}} animals are {{involved}} in the acts of forming sexual and non-sexual relationship bonds between the same sex; even when offered the opportunity to breed with members of the opposite sex, they pick the same sex. Some of these species are gazelles, antelope, bison, and <b>sage</b> <b>grouse.</b>|$|E
25|$|Clutch size {{ranges from}} six to eight eggs; {{incubation}} time is 25 to 27 days. Greater sage-grouse apparently have high rates of nest desertion and nest predation. Data from several <b>sage</b> <b>grouse</b> studies indicate a range of nesting success from 23.7 to 60.3%, with predation accounting for 26 to 76% of lost nests.|$|E
25|$|In April 2014, the Sage-Grouse and Endangered Species Conservation and Protection Act (H.R.4419) was {{introduced}} in the U.S. House of Representatives to prohibit the federal government from listing <b>sage</b> <b>grouse</b> under the Endangered Species Act for 10 years, as long as states prepare and carry out plans to protect the species within their borders.|$|E
25|$|Animals {{common in}} the forest around the cave include mule deer, pronghorn, coyotes, bobcats, cougar, and American black bear. Smaller mammals include American badgers, porcupines, golden-mantled ground squirrels, and chipmunks. There is also {{a wide range of}} bird species common to the Derrick Cave area. Small bird species include {{mountain}} bluebirds, western meadowlarks, white-crowned sparrows, lark sparrows, and <b>sage</b> <b>grouse.</b> Larger birds include ravens, great horned owls, turkey vultures, red-tailed hawks, golden eagles, and bald eagles.|$|E
25|$|Greater sage-grouse {{disperse}} {{to areas}} surrounding the leks for nesting. In {{a study of}} habitat selection by male greater <b>sage</b> <b>grouse</b> in central Montana during breeding season, sagebrush height and canopy cover at 110 daytime feeding and loafing sites of cocks were recorded. About 80% of the locations occurred in sagebrush with a canopy cover of 20–50%. In another Montana study, sagebrush cover averaged 30% on a cock-use area, and no cocks were observed in areas of less than 10% canopy cover.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sage</b> <b>grouse</b> {{are highly}} {{selective}} grazers, choosing {{only a few}} plant genera. Dandelion (Taraxacum spp.), legumes (Fabaceae), yarrow (Achillea spp.) and wild lettuce (Lactuca spp.) account {{for most of their}} forb intake. From July to September, dandelion comprised 45% of forb intake; sagebrush comprised 34%. Collectively, dandelion, sagebrush, and two legume genera (Trifolium and Astragalus) contributed more than 90% of the greater sage-grouse diet. Insects are a minor diet item for adults. Insects comprised 2% of the adult diet in spring and fall and 9% in summer. Sagebrush made up 71% of the year-round diet.|$|E
25|$|Their {{historic}} range spanned 16 American {{states and}} Alberta, British Columbia, and Saskatchewan in Canada. Between 1988 and 2012, the Canadian population declined by 98%. By 2012, they were extirpated from British Columbia {{and left with}} only remnant populations in Alberta with 40 to 60 adult birds, and in Saskatchewan with only 55 to 80 adult birds. By 2013, <b>sage</b> <b>grouse</b> were also extirpated from five U.S. states. In 2013, the Canadian Governor in Council {{on behalf of the}} Minister of the Environment, under the Species at Risk Act, annexed an emergency order {{for the protection of the}} greater sage-grouse.|$|E
25|$|Swainson's hawks may {{be largely}} insectivorous except when nesting. Insect prey {{commonly}} taken includes grasshoppers, crickets, and locusts. Other Buteo hawks in this species range, including smaller-bodied species, do not normally prefer insects in their diet but instead focus on rodents {{and other small}} vertebrates. However, breeding birds switch mainly to capturing vertebrate prey, which pairs then bring to their nestlings. Breeding Swainson's hawks rely heavily upon small mammals such as young ground squirrels, young cottontails, pocket gophers, mice, young jackrabbits, and, at least locally, small birds and other vertebrates including reptiles and amphibians. Birds taken include large birds such as Mallards, and <b>Sage</b> <b>Grouse</b> {{which may have been}} injured initially.|$|E
25|$|The {{importance}} of sagebrush {{in the diet}} of adult greater sage-grouse is great; numerous studies have documented its year-round use. A Montana study, based on 299 crop samples, showed that 62% of total food volume {{of the year was}} sagebrush. Between December and February, it was the only food item found in all crops. Only between June and September did sagebrush constitute less than 60% of their diet. <b>Sage</b> <b>grouse</b> select sagebrush species differentially. Greater sage-grouse in Antelope Valley, California, browsed black sagebrush more frequently than the more common big sagebrush. The browse of black sagebrush is highly preferred by greater sage-grouse in Nevada. In southeastern Idaho, black sagebrush was preferred as forage.|$|E
25|$|In {{the sage}} steppes and grasslands of the Catlow Valley, {{resident}} birds include horned larks, Brewer's sparrows, vesper sparrows, sage thrashers, sagebrush sparrows, black-throated sparrows, common ravens, and greater <b>sage</b> <b>grouse.</b> The valley also hosts mountain chickadees, Cassin's finches, black-headed grosbeaks, green-tailed towhees, yellow-rumped warblers, MacGillivray's warblers, mountain bluebirds, white-headed woodpeckers, California quail, mourning doves, magpies, burrowing owls, flammulated owls, and northern harriers. In the valley's riparian areas, dusky flycatchers, yellow warblers, orange-crowned warblers, house wrens, and spotted towhees {{are common in}} the summer months. In the rimrock, there are chukars, white-throated swifts, cliff swallows, and barn swallows.

Birds of prey include owls, hawks, prairie falcons, golden eagles, and bald eagles.|$|E
500|$|Most of {{the range}} is public land {{administered}} by the federal Bureau of Land Management. [...] There is very little human development in the remote region—cattle grazing and ranching are the primary human uses—but former mines at the McDermitt Caldera produced {{some of the largest}} amounts of mercury in North America in the 20thcentury. Public lands in the mountains are open to recreation but are rarely visited. Vegetation includes large swaths of big sagebrush in addition to desert grasses and cottonwood and alder stands. <b>Sage</b> <b>grouse</b> and mountain chickadee are two bird species native to the range, and common mammals include pronghorn and jackrabbits.|$|E
500|$|Animals in the Trout Creek Mountains are {{adapted to}} the {{environment}} of the High Desert. [...] Pronghorn are common in the open, sagebrush-covered basins, while mule deer live in the cottonwood and willow groves. [...] There are also bighorn sheep, cougars, and bobcats in the high country. [...] Jackrabbits and coyotes are prevalent throughout the range. Mustangs sometimes pass through the mountains as they roam the Great Basin. Some other mammals include the northern pocket gopher, mountain cottontail, and Belding's ground squirrel. North American beavers live in and along streams, as do Pacific tree frogs, western spadefoot toads, and garter snakes.

[...] To preserve the riparian ecosystem, the ranch keeps cattle away from creek banks during critical times of the year.|$|E
2500|$|Among the big {{sagebrush}} subspecies, basin big sagebrush is less nutritious {{and higher}} in terpenes than either mountain or Wyoming big sagebrush. <b>Sage</b> <b>grouse</b> prefer {{the other two}} subspecies to basin big sagebrush. In a common garden study done in Utah, greater sage-grouse preferred mountain big sagebrush over Wyoming and basin big sagebrush. [...] However, when leaves and buds of the preferred species became limited, the birds shifted to the lesser-liked plants. The birds, while expressing preference, are capable of shifting their eating habits.|$|E
2500|$|The {{predominant}} avifauna of the Aspen Parkland are {{house wren}} (Troglodytes aedon), least flycatcher ( [...] Empidonax minimus), yellow warbler (Dendroica petechia) and western kingbird (Tyrannus verticalis).
