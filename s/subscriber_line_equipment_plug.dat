This evaluation method {{can be used by}} ADSL provider (CO- Central Office) to guarantee the system quality and avoid low performance of service. In order to present this evaluation method, this paper considers a traffic generator, modems under test, a telephony local loop carring ADSL service, and DSLAM as the lab setup to perform such tests.

40|$|Abstract—Access networks, in particular, Digital <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Line</b> (DSL) <b>equipment,</b> are a {{significant}} source of energy con-sumption for wireline operators. Replacing large monolithic DSLAMs with smaller remote DSLAM units closer to customers can reduce the energy consumption as well as increase the reach of the access network. This paper attempts to formalize the design and optimization of the “last mile ” wireline access network with energy as one of the costs to be minimized. In particular, the placement of remote DSLAM units needs to be optimized. We propose solutions for two scenarios. For the scenario where an existing all-copper network from the central office to the customers is to be transformed into a fiber-copper network with remote DSLAM units, we present efficient polynomial-time solutions. For the green-field scenario, where both the access network layout and the placement of remote DSLAM units must be determined, we show that this problem is NP-complete. We present an optimal ILP formulation and also design an efficient heuristic-based approach to build a power and cost optimized access network. Our heuristic-based approach yields results that are very close to optimal. We show how the power consumption of the access network can be reduced by carefully planning the access network and introducing remote DSLAM units. I...|$|R

50|$|Consumer-oriented ADSL was {{designed}} to operate on existing lines already conditioned for Basic Rate Interface ISDN services, which itself is a digital circuit switching service (non-IP), though most incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) provision rate-adaptive digital <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> (RADSL) to work on virtually any available copper pair facility, whether conditioned for BRI or not.Engineers developed high speed DSL facilities such as high bit rate digital <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> (HDSL) and symmetric digital <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> (SDSL) to provision traditional Digital Signal 1 (DS1) services over standard copper pair facilities.|$|R
50|$|Asymmetric digital <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> (ADSL) {{is a type}} {{of digital}} <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> (DSL) technology, a data {{communications}} technology that enables faster data transmission over copper telephone lines than a conventional voiceband modem can provide. ADSL differs from the less common symmetric digital <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> (SDSL). In ADSL, Bandwidth and bit rate are said to be asymmetric, meaning greater toward the customer premises (downstream) than the reverse (upstream). Providers usually market ADSL as a service for consumers for Internet access for primarily downloading content from the Internet, but not serving content accessed by others.|$|R
50|$|In telephony, pair gain is the {{transmitting}} {{of multiple}} POTS signals over the twisted pairs traditionally {{used for a}} single traditional <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> in telephone systems. Pair gain {{has the effect of}} creating additional <b>subscriber</b> <b>lines.</b> This is typically used as an expedient way to solve <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> shortage problems by using existing wiring, instead of installing new wires from the central office to the customer premises. The term was invented in the middle 20th century by analogy with earlier use of gain to extend telephone local loops far from the telephone exchange.|$|R

50|$|A {{symmetric}} digital <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> (SDSL) is {{a digital}} <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> (DSL) that transmits digital data over the copper wires {{of the telephone}} network, where the bandwidth in the downstream direction, from the network to the subscriber, {{is identical to the}} bandwidth in the upstream direction, from the subscriber to the network. This symmetric bandwidth can be considered to be the opposite of the asymmetric bandwidth offered by asymmetric digital <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> (ADSL) technologies, where the upstream bandwidth is lower than the downstream bandwidth.
