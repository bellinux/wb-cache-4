5|$|It must be {{at least}} {{somewhat}} <b>steerable.</b>|$|E
5|$|Interferometry at Jodrell Bank started {{before the}} Lovell {{telescope}} was constructed, using the Transit Telescope with a 35 square meter broadside array {{to determine the}} size of radio-loud nebulae. Once construction of the Lovell telescope was complete, the broadside array was put on a <b>steerable</b> mount and the pair were used as a tracking radio interferometer. This was then {{used to determine the}} 2D shape of quasars on the sky.Rowson (1963) In the summer of 1961, a 25-foot (8-m) diameter paraboloid telescope was constructed (it was made of aluminium tubing and was mounted on the rotating structure of an old defence radar). This was then used as a <b>steerable</b> interferometer with the Mark I, with a resolution of 0.3 arcseconds, to determine the sizes of some high-redshift (z~0.86) quasars.|$|E
5|$|Bernard Lovell {{built the}} Transit Telescope at Jodrell Bank {{in the late}} 1940s. This was a -diameter radio {{telescope}} that could only point directly upwards; {{the next logical step}} was to build a telescope that could look at all parts of the sky so that more sources could be observed, as well as for longer integration times. Although the Transit Telescope had been designed and constructed by the astronomers that used it, a fully <b>steerable</b> telescope would need to be professionally designed and constructed; the first challenge was to find an engineer willing to do the job. This turned out to be Charles Husband, whom Lovell first met on 8 September 1949.|$|E
5|$|Both {{tracks and}} wheels {{were used for}} {{steering}}. The steering system was set up so that gentle turns used just the <b>steerable</b> front wheels, but brakes would {{be applied to the}} tracks the farther the steering wheel was turned. The drive sprocket had the track-saving but more complicated rollers rather than the more common teeth. The rear suspension consisted of five double roadwheels, overlapping and interleaved in the Schachtellaufwerk layout, mounted on swing arms sprung by torsion bars. An idler wheel, mounted {{at the rear of the}} vehicle, was used to control track tension. The front axle had transversely mounted leaf springs and shock absorbers - the only ones on the vehicle.|$|E
5|$|Myers {{designed}} {{a new type}} balloon vessel based on Carlotta's discoveries of aerodynamics and how airship bodies acted in the sky. Carlotta {{was the first woman}} to use a maneuverable airship. She used a cloth screw-sail and also a cloth rudder for controlling the steering of her aeroplane platform. The platform car device weighted 11 pounds. This {{was the first time that}} an ordinary spherical balloon could be controlled by a person. Myers then incorporated new features into balloons based on Carlotta's findings. For a more efficient <b>steerable</b> airship vessel he made his next balloon gas bag bottom flat so that it would act like an inclined plane.|$|E
5|$|The {{airframe}} is of semi-monocoque structure constructed {{primarily of}} aluminium alloys. High strength steel and titanium alloys are partially adopted in some critical areas. The airframe {{is designed for}} a service life of 4,000 flight hours or 25 years, the first overhaul being due at 1,200 flight hours. Block 2 JF-17s incorporate greater use of composite materials in the airframe to reduce weight. The retractable undercarriage has a tricycle arrangement with a single <b>steerable</b> nose-wheel and two main undercarriages. The hydraulic brakes have an automatic anti-skid system. The position {{and shape of the}} inlets is designed to give the required airflow to the jet engine during manoeuvres involving high angles of attack.|$|E
5|$|Most of them {{unscrewed}} at {{once and}} 530kilograms (1170lb) of rope were lost, while the three explorers could simultaneously be seen to dump 210kilograms of sand overboard to get the basket clear of the water. Seven hundred and forty kilograms (1630lb) of essential weight was thus lost {{in the first few}} minutes. Before it was well clear of the launch site, the Eagle had turned from a supposedly <b>steerable</b> craft into an ordinary hydrogen balloon with a few ropes hanging from it, {{at the mercy of the}} wind; its crew had no means to direct it to any particular goal and had too little ballast for stability. Lightened, the balloon rose to 700meters (2300ft), an unimagined height, where the lower air pressure made the hydrogen escape all the faster through the eight million little holes.|$|E
5|$|Salyut 6, {{launched}} on a Proton 8K82K rocket on 29 September 1977, marked {{the switch from}} engineering development stations to routine operations, and united the most effective elements {{from each of the}} previous stations. Its navigation system, made up of the Delta semi-automatic computer to depict the station's orbit and the Kaskad system to control its orientation, was based on that used on Salyut 4, as was its power system, which consisted of a trio of <b>steerable</b> solar panels together producing a peak of 4kilowatts of power over 51m². The station's thermal regulation systems, which made use of a sophisticated arrangement of insulation and radiators, was also derived from that used on Salyut 4. In addition, Salyut 6 made use of environmental systems first used on Salyut 3, and controlled its orientation using gyrodynes first tested on that station.|$|E
5|$|The patent {{illustrates}} a non-powered flying machine—namely, the 1902 glider. The patent's importance {{lies in its}} claim {{of a new and}} useful method of controlling a flying machine, powered or not. The technique of wing-warping is described, but the patent explicitly states that other methods instead of wing-warping could be used for adjusting the outer portions of a machine's wings to different angles on the right and left sides to achieve lateral (roll) control. The concept of varying the angle presented to the air near the wingtips, by any suitable method, is central to the patent. The patent also describes the <b>steerable</b> rear vertical rudder and its innovative use in combination with wing-warping, enabling the airplane to make a coordinated turn, a technique that prevents hazardous adverse yaw, the problem Wilbur had when trying to turn the 1901 glider. Finally, the patent describes the forward elevator, used for ascending and descending.|$|E
25|$|The {{nose wheel}} is <b>steerable,</b> dual {{controls}} were factory standard, while the vertically-hinged cockpit doors were an option. With no occupants the aircraft sits on its tail.|$|E
25|$|Husband {{also helped}} {{to design the}} <b>steerable</b> radio aerials at the GPO's Goonhilly Satellite Earth Station in Cornwall, as well as radio telescopes in the UK and elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea of a}} spherical {{reflecting}} mirror with a <b>steerable</b> secondary {{has since}} been used in optical telescopes, in particular the Hobby–Eberly Telescope and the Southern African Large Telescope.|$|E
25|$|The {{landing gear}} is of {{tricycle}} configuration. Earlier models {{did not have}} a <b>steerable</b> nosewheel, but the SS and RX 550 Plus include this feature. Most models have independent mechanical or hydraulic brakes.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{features a}} cantilever wing, a T-tail, a two-seat side-by-side enclosed cockpit under a bubble canopy, fixed tricycle or {{conventional landing gear}} with a <b>steerable</b> tail wheel and a single engine in tractor configuration.|$|E
25|$|Hawk 67 – Export {{version for}} the Republic of Korea Air Force. Fitted with {{extended}} nose of Hawk 100 to accommodate avionics and a <b>steerable</b> nosewheel. Twenty ordered in July 1991, with delivery by November 1993.|$|E
25|$|Voyager-class ships have a {{diesel-electric}} powertrain. They are {{powered by}} six Wärtsilä Vasa 46 diesel engines, giving a total output of 75,600kW. The generated electric power drives three 14 MW ABB Azipod azimuth thrusters (two <b>steerable</b> and one fixed).|$|E
25|$|Communications {{depends on}} an {{omnidirectional}} low-gain antenna communicating {{at a low}} data rate and a <b>steerable</b> high-gain antenna, both {{in direct contact with}} Earth. A low gain antenna is also used to relay data to spacecraft orbiting Mars.|$|E
25|$|A-4: Seventeen BT-2BRs and BT-2BGs {{converted}} in 1940 as radio-controlled aerial target drones. These had tricycle gear (a <b>steerable</b> nosewheel was added) with main gear moved aft, faired-over rear cockpit, and single controls, allowing the aircraft to be test-flown.|$|E
25|$|It {{includes}} a redesigned and upgraded interior, Honeywell Primus Epic 2.0 avionics, a stern thruster, new Sumitomo corrosion-resistant landing gear, a hydraulic electrically <b>steerable</b> nose gear, and MT five-blade composite propellers and Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-135As.|$|E
25|$|The {{next project}} of Jacques Charles and the Robert {{brothers}} {{was to build}} an elongated, <b>steerable</b> craft that followed Jean Baptiste Meusnier's proposals (1783–85) for a dirigible balloon. The design incorporated Meusnier's internal ballonnet (air cells), a rudder and a method of propulsion.|$|E
25|$|The series {{all share}} similar {{construction}} featuring a bolted aluminium tube structure with the flying surfaces covered in pre-sewn Dacron sailcloth envelopes. All models are open-cockpit, but some have optional streamlined pods available. All models use {{tricycle landing gear}} and <b>steerable</b> nosewheels.|$|E
25|$|In 1961 the {{drillship}} Cuss 1 {{was fitted}} with four <b>steerable</b> propellers, {{in an attempt}} to drill the first Moho well. It was possible to keep the ship in position above the well off La Jolla, California, at a depth of 948 meters.|$|E
25|$|Turbine {{drilling}} is best {{used for}} drilling hard rocks at high bit RPM's with diamond impregnated bits, {{and can be}} used with an angled drive shaft for directional drilling and horizontal drilling. It competes though with moyno motors and increasingly with rotary <b>steerable</b> systems and is again out of favour.|$|E
25|$|The Hawk line of {{ultralight}} aircraft was introduced at Sun 'n Fun, Lakeland, Florida, in March, 1982. The Hawk {{was the first}} fully enclosed ultralight, the first with fully strut-braced wings, three-axis controls, a <b>steerable</b> nose or tail wheel and wing flaps. The original 1982 CGS Hawk Classic remains in production in 2015.|$|E
25|$|Tank {{steering}} systems allow a tank, {{or other}} continuous track vehicle, to turn. Because the tracks cannot be angled {{relative to the}} hull (in any operational design), steering must be accomplished by speeding one track up, slowing the other down (or reversing it), {{or a combination of}} both. The half-track avoids this by combining <b>steerable</b> wheels and fixed-speed tracks.|$|E
25|$|The {{wide track}} and a <b>steerable</b> {{nosewheel}} made the aircraft {{easy to handle}} on the ground, and the short landing gear avoided the need for access ladders and service stands. The aircraft {{was designed to be}} simple to maintain, with more than 100 access panels and doors. An experienced ground crew could change an engine in about half an hour.|$|E
25|$|An {{additional}} {{advantage is}} that considerably less launch energy is needed to place a spacecraft into a Molniya orbit than into a geostationary orbit. Disadvantages are that, {{as opposed to a}} spacecraft in a geostationary orbit, the ground station needs a <b>steerable</b> antenna to track the spacecraft and that the spacecraft will pass the Van Allen radiation belt four times per day.|$|E
25|$|On April 16, 2009 JSAT {{made its}} seventh order for an A2100-based {{satellite}} from Lockheed, JCSAT-13. It would feature 44 Ku band transponders with two <b>steerable</b> antennas for on-orbit reconfiguration. It {{was to be}} launched in 2013 for the 124°East slot where it would replace JCSAT-4A. The next day, April 17, Arianespace announced that they had secured the contract to launch JCSAT-13 on an Ariane 5 ECA.|$|E
25|$|The basic Bensen Gyrocopter {{design is}} a simple frame of square {{aluminium}} or galvanized steel tubing, reinforced with triangles of lighter tubing. It is arranged so that the stress falls on the tubes, or special fittings, not the bolts. A front-to-back keel mounts a <b>steerable</b> nosewheel, seat, engine, and a vertical stabilizer. Outlying mainwheels are mounted on an axle. Some versions may mount seaplane-style floats for water operations.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{fitted with}} a retractable tricycle undercarriage with <b>steerable</b> nosewheels, allowing a fairly large crab angle during cross-wind landing. The reverse pitch control with which the aircraft is fitted allows the constant-speed mechanism to be manually overridden to reverse the blade pitch angle, thus providing excellent ground-handling characteristics, helping {{to slow down the}} plane to shorten the landing run. This control also allows the aircraft to back up on its own during taxiing.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} was a welded steel tube fuselage, with wood wing construction with fabric covering. The <b>steerable</b> rudder mounted tailwheel {{was also the}} only wheel with a brake. The exhaust was routed through a special manifold to a stock Model T exhaust. The steel landing gear was fastened to the wing and used rubber doughnuts in compression for shock absorption. The designer of the aircraft, Otto Koppen, went on to design the Helio Courier.|$|E
25|$|The Dragonfly {{shares the}} Baby Albatross's molded plywood {{fuselage}} pod, aluminium tube tail boom and strut-braced double spar wooden wing, covered in aircraft fabric aft of the spar. The leading edge is a plywood D-cell. The aircraft features dual controls and a retractable {{tricycle landing gear}} with a <b>steerable</b> nose wheel. The engine is started by a ratchet-wire recoil start system that allows restarts in flight, {{as well as on}} the ground.|$|E
25|$|Goddard's work as both theorist and {{engineer}} anticipated many of {{the developments}} that were to make spaceflight possible. He {{has been called the}} man who ushered in the Space Age. Two of Goddard's 214 patented inventions—a multi-stage rocket (1914), and a liquid-fuel rocket (1914)—were important milestones toward spaceflight. His 1919 monograph A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes {{is considered one of the}} classic texts of 20th-century rocket science. Goddard successfully applied three-axis control, gyroscopes and <b>steerable</b> thrust to rockets to effectively control their flight.|$|E
25|$|A {{flexible}} flyer or steel runner sled is a <b>steerable</b> wooden sled {{with thin}} metal runners whereby a rider may sit upright on the sled or lie on their stomach, allowing {{the possibility to}} descend a snowy slope feet-first or head-first. To steer the sled, the rider may either push on the wooden cross piece with their hands or feet, or pull on the rope attached to the wooden cross-piece. The flexible flyer was invented in 1889 by Philadelphia resident Samuel Leeds Allen. U.S. patent #408,681 was issued to Allen on August 13, 1889.|$|E
25|$|Although Gull {{variants}} were {{powered by}} five different engines, those were all inverted inline air-cooled types driving two-bladed propellers, making for a neatly faired installation. The rear fuselage was of square cross section with a rounded top. The glazed cabin joined smoothly into a raised dorsal fairing, {{and placed the}} pilot in front and two passenger seats, slightly staggered behind. Entry into the early models was via the sliding canopy. The main undercarriage was fixed and spatted, each wheel mounted on three struts in the early models; {{there was a small}} <b>steerable</b> tail wheel.|$|E
25|$|The Flamingo's {{fuselage}} had a {{welded steel}} tube structure, skinned forward with light alloy and aft with laminated plastic. Its {{two rows of}} seats were enclosed under a three part canopy which merged at the rear into the raised fuselage. There was a wide door on either side for cabin access and a separate baggage space behind the seats. It had a retractable tricycle undercarriage with the mainwheels, fitted with brakes, behind the engines. The nosewheel was <b>steerable.</b> The undercarriage, like the flaps and airbrakes, were hydraulically powered.|$|E
