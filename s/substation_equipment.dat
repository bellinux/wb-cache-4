50|$|Work was {{completed}} {{right before the}} 1956 summer season, but the power supply was inadequate. Because of a strike, the delivery of <b>substation</b> <b>equipment</b> was delayed. Trains operated slowly across Jamaica Bay in order to conserve power. The newer R10s were intended to operate over the line, but because they required more power than the Arnines, the Arnines operated on the line. The line was incorporated into the Independent Subway System (IND) and connected to the IND Fulton Street Line. On June 28, 1956, service on the line began between Euclid Avenue and Rockaway Park at 6:38 PM and between Euclid Avenue and Wavecrest at 6:48 PM. Once the slow order was removed, the travel time from Euclid Avenue to Rockaway Park decreased from 40 to 28 minutes, and the travel time from Euclid Avenue to Wavecrest decreased from 44 to 32 minutes.|$|E

Whilst inferior to {{and more expensive}} than modern single phase alternating current equipment, it was in vogue during the 1920s, having been used in Melbourne since 1919 and is generally sufficient for the operation of electric multiple unit trains. However, the introduction of powerful electric locomotives in the 1950s, followed by the Millennium train in 2002, revealed drawbacks in this antiquated system of electrification. As the voltage is relatively low, high currents are required to supply a given amount of power, which necessitates the use of very heavy duty cabling and <b>substation</b> <b>equipment.</b> Until the retirement of electric locomotives from freight service in the 1990s, it was often necessary to observe a [...] "power margin" [...] to ensure that substations were not overloaded.

Except of the first pylon, these pylons were used before 1992 for the 110 kV-powerline from Etzenricht to Weiden.

To protected these equipments and for stability purpose, over-voltages and over currents protection are important to consider. Lightning {{is one of the}} most serious causes of over-voltage. If the power equipments especially at outdoor substation are not protected, the over-voltage will cause burning of insulation. Lightning arrester can protect the damages of equipments. This paper describes the arrester type, lightning terminal and earthing plan of Dagon East substation in Myanmar. DynaVar station class and intermediated arrester (Vrated = 72 kV and I charge (max) = 10 kA) are used in this substation. Most of <b>substation</b> <b>equipments</b> are designed to match with the insulation coordination. If the insulation equipments are higher, the cost is also high. So, to relax this, the lightning arrester must be put in front of the protected equipments and protected zone.
