5|$|In 1869 {{the town}} of Rosendale issued {{municipal}} bonds to pay for its portion of the Wallkill Valley Railroad, and construction of a railroad bridge spanning the Rondout Creek began the following year. After bridging the Wallkill River in New Paltz, the railroad reached Rosendale in 1871. The Rosendale trestle was formally opened during a large ceremony on April6, 1872. The height of the bridge terrified onlookers, who questioned the trestle's <b>sturdiness.</b> The bridge's completion allowed the rail line to continue north to Kingston.|$|E
5|$|According to Jain texts, Bahubali {{was born}} to Rishabhanatha and Sunanda during the Ikshvaku dynasty in Ayodhya. He {{is said to have}} excelled in {{studying}} medicine, archery, floriculture, and the knowledge of precious gems. Bahubali had a son named Somakirti (also known as Mahabala). When Rishabhanatha decided to become a monk, he distributed his kingdom among his 100 sons. Bharata was gifted the kingdom of Vinita (Ayodhya) and Bahubali got the kingdom of Asmaka from South India, having Podanapur as its capital. After winning six divisions of earth in all directions (digvijaya), Bharata proceeded to his capital Ayodhyapuri with a huge army and divine chakra-ratna—spinning, disk-like super weapon with serrated edges. But the chakra-ratna stopped on its own at the entrance of Ayodhyapuri, signalling to the emperor that his 99 brothers have yet not submitted to his authority. Bharata's 98 brothers became Jain monks' and submitted their kingdoms to him. Bahubali was endowed with the final and superior body of extraordinary <b>sturdiness</b> and strength (vajra-ṛṣabhanārācasaṃhanana) like Bharata. He hurled open defiance at the chakravartin and challenged him to a fight.|$|E
5|$|Designed by Adrian D. Smith of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, the Franklin Center, {{is one of}} {{the most}} famous and {{recognized}} buildings in Chicago. The building's form features setbacks at the 15th, 30th and 45th floors. Designed in the postmodern architectural style, it is a granite-clad steel-framed building resting on pile foundations. The structure is characterized by strong vertical lines, spiked roof pinnacles, granite cladding and setbacks. The granite is a deep red color at the base, but changes shade to rose-beige at the top. Above the 5th floor, the lighter rose-beige granite is protected by silk-screened aluminum panels. The building relies on Gothic detailing to showcase verticality. The building's verticality evokes images of 1920s buildings, and the <b>sturdiness</b> of the structure is reminiscent of the Chicago Board of Trade Building. In addition to its design, the building relies on its location at the farthest corner from the Willis Tower to set it apart.|$|E
5|$|Dao: Daos are single-edged Chinese swords, {{primarily}} {{used for}} slashing and chopping. The {{most common form}} {{is also known as}} the Chinese sabre, although those with wider blades are sometimes referred to as Chinese broadswords. In China, the dao {{is considered one of the}} four traditional weapons, along with the gun (stick or staff), qiang (spear), and the jian (sword). The earliest dao date from the Shang Dynasty in China's Bronze Age, and are known as zhibeidao (直背刀)– straight backed knives. As the name implies, these were straight-bladed or slightly curved weapons with a single edge. Originally bronze, these weapons were made of iron or steel by the time of the late Warring States period as metallurgical knowledge became sufficiently advanced to control the carbon content. Originally less common as a military weapon than the jian– the straight, double-edged blade of China– the dao became popular with cavalry during the Han dynasty due to its <b>sturdiness,</b> superiority as a chopping weapon, and relative ease of use– it was generally said that it takes a week to attain competence with a dao/saber, a month to attain competence with a qiang/spear, and a year to attain competence with a jian/straight sword. Soon after dao began to be issued to infantry, beginning the replacement of the jian as a standard-issue weapon. Late Han dynasty dao had round grips and ring-shaped pommels, and ranged between 85 and 114 centimeters in length. These weapons were used alongside rectangular shields.|$|E

25|$|Nantes' {{cityscape}} {{is primarily}} recent, with more buildings built during the 20th century {{than in any}} other era. The city has 122 buildings listed as monuments historiques, the 19th-ranked French city. Most of the old buildings were made of tuffeau stone (a light, easily-sculpted sandstone typical of the Loire Valley) and cheaper schist. Because of its <b>sturdiness,</b> granite was often used for foundations. Old buildings on the former Feydeau Island and the neighbouring embankments often lean because they were built on damp soil.|$|E
25|$|Following Lieutenant General A.P. Hill's {{death on}} April 2, 1865 the Third Corps was {{dissolved}} and {{assigned to the}} First Corps. On April 9, 1865, General Lee surrendered. One day later he thanked his men and his officers for their bravery and <b>sturdiness</b> and announced the dismissal of all troops on their word of honor in General Order No. 9. The listings of the Army of Northern Virginia say that 28,231 soldiers were dismissed on their word of honor on April 10, 1865.|$|E
25|$|A further {{contributory}} {{factor was}} {{the introduction of}} a new Establishment of Guns in 1716. Previously, gun establishments had catered for each ship, as there were often differences between ships of the same nominal size that would affect the armament they could carry. The 1716 gun establishment was intended to overturn that situation, so that all ships of a particular type (for example, 70 gun ships) would carry the same armament. The Navy Board highlighted {{the fact that there were}} still several ships in service that were physically incapable of carrying the prescribed armament, either due to the number and disposition of gunports, or to <b>sturdiness</b> of build. Essentially, however, the Navy Board resolved to undertake the task of having all ships rebuilt to common designs to facilitate the new gun establishment.|$|E
25|$|On November 7 and 8, the NWS issued {{hurricane}} wind warnings, flood {{warnings and}} blizzard warnings {{for most of}} Western Alaska.

25|$|The <b>sturdiness</b> and {{quietness}} of the LCA proved invaluable during Operation Dragoon, {{the invasion}} of southern France in July 1944. Operation Romeo had LCAs of the RCN disembark the 1er Commando Français de l'Afrique du Nord to disable German artillery atop the cliffs of Cap Nègre. Canadian LCAs also landed the U.S.-Canadian 1st Special Service Force on the difficult, sharp-rocked shores of Île du Levant in a pre-dawn operation to silence batteries there that threatened the main force. The LCA was a strong little craft, in this instance standing up better to the pounding in rough landings than other LC types, especially on these rocky offshore islands, when many LCVPs were lost. Following the landings in southern France, the RN's LSI units remained in the Mediterranean or began moving to the Indian Ocean in anticipation of joining the war against Japan.|$|E

DeHavilland played Linnett Moore, a tough yet feminine frontier woman who cares for the boy and comes to love his father. The movie was filmed on location in Utah, where deHavilland learned to hitch and drive a team of horses and handle a gun for her role. The Proud Rebel was released May 28, 1958, and was well received by audiences and critics. In his review for The New York Times, A.H.

500|$|The trestle was rebuilt in 1895 by the King Bridge Company {{to address}} public {{concerns}} regarding its stability, {{and it has}} been repeatedly reinforced throughout its existence. Concern over the <b>sturdiness</b> of the trestle has persisted since its opening, and was a major reason Conrail closed the Wallkill Valley rail line in 1977. After the rail line's closure, Conrail sold the bridge in 1986 for one dollar to a private businessman who tried unsuccessfully to operate the trestle as a bungee jumping platform in the 1990s.

500|$|In Europe, it was owing {{in great}} measure to the Renaissance that the chair {{ceased to be}} a mark of high office, and became the {{customary}} companion of whoever could afford to buy it.

No piece of furniture has ever been so close an index to sumptuary changes. It has varied in size, shape and <b>sturdiness</b> with the fashion not only of women’s dress but of men’s also. Thus the chair which was not, even with its arms purposely suppressed, too ample during the several reigns of some form or other of hoops and farthingale, became monstrous when these protuberances disappeared. Again, the costly laced coats of the dandy of the 18th and early 19th centuries were so threatened by the ordinary form of seat that a “conversation chair” was devised, which enabled the buck and the ruffler to sit with his face to the back, his valuable tails hanging unimpeded over the front. The early chair almost invariably had arms, and it was not until towards the close of the 16th century that the smaller form grew common.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} 1840s Sharpe was invited by John Fletcher, his future brother-in-law, {{to build a}} church near Fletcher's home in Little Bolton. [...] Fletcher {{was the owner of}} a coal mine at Ladyshore, Little Lever, {{overlooking}} the River Irwell and the Manchester, Bolton & Bury Canal. [...] He had been using the clay which came up with the coal to make refractory bricks for furnaces, and suggested its use for building the church, as it was much cheaper than stone. Sharpe then designed the first church in England to be built, in whole or in part, from this material (terracotta), StStephen and All Martyrs, Lever Bridge (1842–44). [...] As terracotta is commonly used to make plant pots and the like, Sharpe himself called this church, and its two successors, [...] "the pot churches", a nickname that has stuck. [...] The advantages of terracotta were its cheapness, its <b>sturdiness</b> as a building material, {{and the fact that it}} could be moulded into almost any shape. [...] It could therefore be used for walls, towers, arches, and arcades in a church, for the detailed decoration of capitals and pinnacles, and also, as at StStephen's, for the furnishings, such as the altar, pulpit, font, organ case, and the pew ends. [...] Apart from the foundations and the rubble within the walls, StStephen and All Martyrs was constructed entirely from terracotta. [...] The following year, a second church was built using the same material, Trinity Church, Rusholme, south of Manchester (1845–46), built and paid for by Thomas Carill-Worsley, who lived at nearby Platt Hall. [...] In this case, although the exterior is in terracotta, the interior is of plastered brick. [...] The church was consecrated in June 1846, although at the time work on the spire had not yet started and several other features were incomplete, including the heating, seating, and floor tiling.|$|E

The most serious incident involved an A-36A shedding both wings when its pilot tried to pull out from a 450mph (724km/h) dive.

Nevertheless, the A-36 was used with great success as a dive-bomber, acquiring a reputation for precision, <b>sturdiness</b> and silence.|$|E
2500|$|Railguns face {{a host of}} {{technical}} challenges before they {{will be ready for}} battlefield deployment. First, the rails guiding the projectile must carry very high power. Each firing of the railgun produces tremendous current flow (almost half a million amperes) through the rails, causing rapid erosion of the rail's surfaces (through ohmic heating, and even vaporization of the rail surface.) [...] Early prototypes were essentially single-use weapons, requiring complete replacement of the rails after each firing. Another challenge with the railgun system is projectile survivability. The projectiles experience acceleration force in excess of 100,000g. In order to be effective, the fired projectile must first survive the mechanical stress of firing and the thermal effects of a trip through the atmosphere at many times the speed of sound before its subsequent impact with the target. In-flight guidance, if implemented, would require the onboard navigation system to be built to the same level of <b>sturdiness</b> as the main mass of the projectile.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the main}} feature of the stage was a complex machine like {{structure}} which enabled the whole stage to become mobile and assume numerous shapes and sizes throughout the show. It consists of a [...] high video screen that was interchangeable into the main stage as flooring, as well as used for creating an elevated [...] platform, or a vertical wall that can be tilted from zero to 90 degrees within half-a-minute, or used as an angular wall for Madonna's dancers to sway to and fro. Specially crafted bungee points were attached to {{the top edge of}} the machine, allowing performers to [...] "flip, tumble, run and roll up and down the ramp". They were also able to hang down from the screens acting as walls, while being able to run up them also in the same position. The stage also had video backdrops attached to them showing the visuals by Moment Factory and Veneno Inc. Another prop included a [...] steel spiral staircase which was hidden from the audience initially. Lipson explained that a prototype for the staircase had been made out of a single block of steel. Although not recommended to use steel because of its heavy weight and enormity, it was the finalized piece used for performances, since Madonna had found the <b>sturdiness</b> as useful during rehearsals. Simpler props designed by Stufish were the table during the sequence of [...] "Vogue", which was [...] long and had flickering [...] tall candelabras at each end. The set of crosses for the dancing nuns were designed to support both Madonna and the dancer on it. They were the result of 17 different prototypes and were fastened with ridges, allowing the dancers to know which way they would swivel.|$|E
2500|$|For both Orthodox and Eastern Catholics, the Holy Table (altar) is {{normally}} free-standing, although in very small sanctuaries {{it might be}} placed flush {{against the back wall}} for reasons of space. They are typically about one meter high, and although they may be made of stone they are generally built out of wood. The exact dimensions may vary, but it is generally square in plan and in reasonable proportion {{to the size of the}} sanctuary. It has five legs: one at each corner plus a central pillar for supporting the relics which are placed in it at its consecration (if, however, the consecration was not performed by a bishop, but by a priest whom he delegated for that purpose, relics are not placed in the Holy Table). A plain linen covering (Greek: Katasarkion, Slavonic: Strachítsa) is bound to the Holy Table with cords; this cover is never removed after the altar is consecrated, and is considered to be the [...] "baptismal garment" [...] of the altar. The linen covering symbolizes the winding sheet in which the body of Christ was wrapped when he was laid in the tomb. Since the altar is never seen uncovered thereafter, the table tends to be constructed more with <b>sturdiness</b> than aesthetics in mind. Above this first cover is a second ornamented altar cloth (Indítia), often in a brocade of a liturgical color that may change with the ecclesiastical season. This outer covering usually comes all the way to the floor and represents the glory of God's Throne. In many churches it is the custom for a dust cover to be placed on the Holy Table between services. This is often a simple red cloth, though it may be made of richer stuff. Sometimes it covers only the Gospel Book or the front half of the Holy Table, but it may be large enough to cover the entire Holy Table and everything on it, including candlesticks and the seven-branch candelabra.|$|E
