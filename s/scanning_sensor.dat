Aiming at addressing the problems of existing movable vision measurement methods, a more suitable method for large-sized products on industrial sites is introduced in this paper. A raster binocular vision sensor and a wide-field camera are combined to form a 3 D <b>scanning</b> <b>sensor.</b> During measurement, several planar targets are placed around the object to be measured. With the planar target as an intermediary, the local 3 D data measured by the <b>scanning</b> <b>sensor</b> are integrated into the global coordinate system.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore a novel {{measurement}} approach for wheel-terrain contact angle using laser <b>scanning</b> <b>sensors</b> based on near-terrain perception. Laser <b>scanning</b> <b>sensors</b> have rarely been applied to the measurement of wheel-terrain contact angle for wheeled mobile robots (WMRs) in previous studies; however, it is an effective way to measure wheel-terrain contact angle directly with the advantages of simple, fast and high accuracy. Design/methodology/approach - First, kinematics model for a WMR moving on rough terrain was developed, taking into consideration wheel slip and wheel-terrain contact angle. Second, the measurement principles of wheel-terrain contact angle using laser <b>scanning</b> <b>sensors</b> was presented, including "rigid wheel - rigid terrain" model and "rigid wheel - deformable terrain" model. Findings - In the proposed approach, the measurement of wheel-terrain contact angle using laser <b>scanning</b> <b>sensors</b> was successfully demonstrated. The rationality of the approach was verified by experiments on rigid and sandy terrains with satisfactory results. Originality/value - This paper proposes a novel, fast and effective wheel-terrain contact angle measurement approach for WMRs moving on both rigid and deformable terrains, using laser <b>scanning</b> <b>sensors...</b>|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new {{approach}} for the measurement and reconstruction of large workpieces with freeform surfaces. The system consists of a handheld laser <b>scanning</b> <b>sensor</b> and a position sensor. The laser <b>scanning</b> <b>sensor</b> is used to acquire the surface and geometry information, and the position sensor is utilized to unify the scanning sensors into a global coordinate system. The measurement process includes data collection, multi-sensor data fusion and surface reconstruction. With the multi-sensor data fusion, errors accumulated during the image alignment and registration process are minimized, and the measuring precision is significantly improved. After the dense accurate acquisition of the three-dimensional (3 -D) coordinates, the surface is reconstructed using a commercial software piece, based on the Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) surface. The system has been evaluated, both qualitatively and quantitatively, using reference measurements provided by a commercial laser <b>scanning</b> <b>sensor.</b> The method has been applied for the reconstruction of a large gear rim and the accuracy is up to 0. 0963 mm. The results prove that this new combined method is promising for measuring and reconstructing the large-scale objects with complex surface geometry. Compared with reported methods of large-scale shape measurement, it owns high freedom in motion, high precision and high measurement speed in a wide measurement range...|$|E

Total control of coastal erosion is not feasible but {{it should not be}} ignored and needs timely management. Erosional activities have been significantly noticed along the coastal tract of Vembar and Kallar (Kallurani), South India. An attempt has been made here to delineate different zones based on their sand budget and erosion rate.

Sonar has the opposite problem. Sonar has a very wide sensing angle. This means that when an obstacle is sensed the robot cannot discern the angular position of the obstacle.
