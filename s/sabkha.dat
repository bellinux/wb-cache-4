5|$|About 92% of Bahrain is desert with {{periodic}} droughts {{and dust}} storms, the main natural hazards for Bahrainis. Environmental issues facing Bahrain include desertification {{resulting from the}} degradation of limited arable land, coastal degradation (damage to coastlines, coral reefs, and sea vegetation) resulting from oil spills and other discharges from large tankers, oil refineries, distribution stations, and illegal land reclamation at places such as Tubli Bay. The agricultural and domestic sectors' over-utilisation of the Dammam Aquifer, the principal aquifer in Bahrain, has led to its salinisation by adjacent brackish and saline water bodies. A hydrochemical study identified {{the locations of the}} sources of aquifer salinisation and delineated their areas of influence. The investigation indicates that the aquifer water quality is significantly modified as groundwater flows from the northwestern parts of Bahrain, where the aquifer receives its water by lateral underflow from eastern Saudi Arabia, to the southern and southeastern parts. Four types of salinisation of the aquifer are identified: brackish-water up-flow from the underlying brackish-water zones in north-central, western, and eastern regions; seawater intrusion in the eastern region; intrusion of <b>sabkha</b> water in the southwestern region; and irrigation return flow in a local area in the western region. Four alternatives for the management of groundwater quality that are available to the water authorities in Bahrain are discussed and their priority areas are proposed, based on the type and extent of each salinisation source, in addition to groundwater use in that area.|$|E
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} the Triassic, the {{sea level}} once again rose and {{periodic}} flooding caused by high spring tides and strong on-shore winds {{led to the formation of}} on shore saline lagoons or <b>sabkha</b> environments. (A <b>sabkha</b> is a wide area of coastal flats bordering the sea, the name coming from certain coastal areas of Arabia). Intense evaporation from these lagoons resulted in the precipitation of a carbonate-sulphate complex and the thick halite beds as seen to the south west of Alderley in Northwich where the salt is mined commercially. It was in this type of environment that the Mercia Mudstone Group (formerly Keuper Marl) was deposited.|$|E
25|$|Holocene {{deposits}} are densely {{scattered in}} the <b>sabkha</b> and mud plain areas {{located near the}} city ruins and the sea. Most of the buildings in Zubarah were constructed using materials from these deposits. An area encompassing the city ruins and the project, which is labelled a proto-sabkha habitat, also contains large quantities of holocene fossils. Eocene limestone are predominant further inland where the habitat is a stony, arid desert.|$|E
25|$|Zubarah {{encompasses}} a 400 hectare stretch the north western {{coast of the}} Qatar peninsula, and is located approximately 105km from the Qatari capital Doha. It is situated over a low, coastal hillock. The two main habitat types are the <b>sabkha</b> and the stony desert. Historically, fresh water was of scarce availability. In an attempt to amass a water supply, Murair Fort was constructed 1.8km eastward of the original settlement, {{on the margins of}} the desert scarp. The fort served to facilitate wells which tapped the shallow freshwater lenses.|$|E
25|$|The {{halophytic}} <b>sabkha</b> type desert vegetation is predominant in Muscat. The Qurum Nature Reserve contains {{plants such}} as the Arthrocnemum Macrostachyum and Halopeplis Perfoliata Coral reefs are common in Muscat. Acropora reefs exist in the sheltered bays of the satellite towns of Jussah and Khairan. Additionally, smaller Porites reef colonies exist in Khairan, which have fused to form a flat-top pavement is visible at low tide. Crabs and spiny crayfish {{are found in the}} waters of the Muscat area, as are sardines and bonito. Glassfish are common in freshwater estuaries, such as the Qurum Nature Reserve.|$|E
500|$|Volcanoes {{continued}} to erupt through the Early Triassic on the north–south trending island arc to the west, which was located along {{what is now}} the border between California and Nevada. Shallow, marine water stretched from eastern Utah to eastern Nevada over a beveled continental shelf. As the sea withdrew around 230million years ago, fluvial, mudflat, <b>sabkha,</b> and shallow marine environments developed, depositing [...] gypsum (from lagoon evaporites), mudstones, [...] limestones, sandstones, shales, and siltstones.|$|E
5000|$|Al <b>Sabkha,</b> {{literally}} meaning marshland is bounded to {{the east}} by Al <b>Sabkha</b> Road (109th Street), {{to the east}} by 21st Street and to the north by route D 82 (Al Naif Road). One of the smallest communities in Dubai in terms of area, Al <b>Sabkha</b> is home to Arab and South Asian communities and has an active economic district with traditional souks. Murshid Bazaar in Al <b>Sabkha</b> {{is well known in}} the area for textiles and electronics. Deira's main abra station is located in the eastern section of Al <b>Sabkha</b> across route D 85 (Baniyas Road) ...|$|E
50|$|A <b>sabkha</b> (salt-flat) {{ecosystem}} {{known as}} 'Dukhan Sabkha' {{is found in}} the northern section. As a result of high uranium content, the <b>sabkha</b> has very high levels of radioactivity, ranging from a mean of 16 to 75 cps. Studies suggest that the <b>sabkha</b> is fed by seawater from the Zikrit Gulf, north by approximately 3 km.|$|E
5000|$|Al <b>Sabkha</b> (السبخة) is a {{locality}} in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE). Al <b>Sabkha</b> {{is a small}} community between Al Rigga, Naif, Al Dhagaya and Al Buteen in the Deira region of eastern Dubai.|$|E
50|$|The third picture {{shows the}} area {{south of the}} {{crescent-shaped}} Liwa Oasis in the southern UAE. The picture is about 80km wide, with each <b>sabkha</b> about 2-3km long and 1km wide. You can see white deposits of salt covering {{the surface of the}} <b>sabkha.</b> The Moreeb Dune, rising 120m above the <b>sabkha,</b> is located roughly {{in the middle of the}} picture. The border between Saudi Arabia and the UAE is shown in red.|$|E
50|$|For example, {{large parts}} of the Empty Quarter in Saudi Arabia and the {{southern}} UAE consist of patterns of high drifting barchan dunes alternating with <b>sabkha</b> salt flats. In some places, the <b>sabkha</b> connect to form long accessible corridors into the desert.|$|E
50|$|The {{floor of}} a <b>sabkha</b> is usually a hard-packed {{combination}} of sand, mud and salt. It is easy to walk or drive 4x4 vehicles across the dry <b>sabkha.</b> However, after rains and flash-floods, the <b>sabkha</b> fill with shallow layers of water, and cannot be crossed until they dry out {{to form a new}} crust. When the ground is partly dried, a salt crust forms over soft mud or hollow cavities, and a vehicle will become stuck after breaking through the crust.|$|E
50|$|It {{is located}} in 59 El <b>Sabkha</b> Street.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sabkha</b> {{deposits}} {{are believed}} to form {{some of the major}} subsurface hydrocarbon reservoirs in the Middle East (and elsewhere). The source of these hydrocarbons (both gas and oil) may be the microbial mats and mangrove paleosoils, found in the <b>sabkha</b> sequence, that have total organic carbon up to 8.2% and hydrogen indices typical of marine type II kerogens.|$|E
50|$|In the khor-lagoon-sabkha model, {{an initial}} rise in sea-level floods coastal areas and creates shallow water {{features}}. If the features silt up, or the land rises, or the sea level falls, then the trapped water evaporates, leaving a flat salt pan, or <b>sabkha.</b> If the coastal region has irregular topography, then the flooding creates large independent creeks, or khors. A khor is a shallow, subtidal flat or tidal inlet. The inlet may host grey mangroves, {{depending on whether}} less saline water is available from wadis or groundwater. As sediment begins to accumulate, the khors become more shallow and form a lagoon, or intertidal flat. The lagoons continue to fill until the lagoon floor is exposed at low tide, and the <b>sabkha</b> begins to form. A <b>sabkha</b> may be inundated during higher than normal spring tides, after rainstorms, or when driving winds push seawater onshore {{to a depth of}} a few centimeters. Mature sabkhas are only flooded after heavy rainstorms and may eventually coalesce to form a <b>sabkha</b> coastal plain. These coastal plains are very flat, with reliefs between 10-50 cm, and their seaward slope can be as little as 1:1,000. The flatness of a <b>sabkha</b> is enhanced by aeolian siliciclastic dust being deposited in the topographic lows with most of the relief caused by evaporites.|$|E
5000|$|The Cedar Mesa Sandstone {{varies with}} location, but {{contains}} evaporite, fluvial, tidal-flat, and <b>sabkha</b> facies.|$|E
50|$|These facies sequences, {{except for}} the halite that is {{frequently}} re-dissolved when wetted, can easily be preserved. Factors enabling preservation include the progradation of the <b>sabkha</b> with sedimentation rates of 1 m/1000 years {{and the creation of}} Stokes surfaces. These surfaces are created by the deflation of the <b>sabkha</b> surface that is related {{to the level of the}} groundwater table acting as a local base level.|$|E

50|$|The {{accepted}} type locality for {{a coastal}} <b>sabkha</b> {{is at the}} southern coast of the Persian Gulf, in the United Arab Emirates.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sabkha</b> is a phonetic {{translation}} of the Arabic word used to describe any form of salt flat. Geographically, sabkhas can be sub-divided into two broad categories.|$|E
5000|$|The {{climate is}} one of the main factors in <b>sabkha</b> development. Rainfall in this arid region usually occurs as {{thunderstorms}} and averages 4 cm/year. Temperatures can range in excess of 50 °C to as low as 0 °C. Humidity is linked to the wind direction, with humidity as low as 20% in the mornings from off the dry interior and building in the afternoon as a strong, onshore wind prevail. At night, relative humidity of 100% can lead to dense fogs. [...] Water temperatures vary by depth with shallow water as much as 10 °C warmer. These high temperatures drive high rates of evaporation in the Persian Gulf, as much as 124 cm/year leading salinity to increase in the shallow lagoons to as much as 70 ppt. The net rate of evaporation from the <b>sabkha</b> can be as much as an order of magnitude less and has averaged 6 cm for the last 4,000 to 5,000 years. The reasons for this are that the <b>sabkha</b> surface is not a free-water surface, the high humidity during the night, and vertical stratification of the air column. Despite the loss of water due to evaporation, the groundwater, never deeper than 1.5 m, flows seawards and is recharged by continental waters, rainstorms, and the northwest [...] "shamal” gale-force winds that create waves of greater height than the intertidal height and drive water as much as 5 km inland over the <b>sabkha</b> to a depth of a few centimeters. [...] The climate variations lead to the very dynamic nature of a <b>sabkha.</b> Halite is deposited on the surface of the <b>sabkha</b> and gypsum and aragonite precipitate in the subsurface via capillary action from brines brought up from the water table. In drier parts of the <b>sabkha</b> the gypsum can be altered to anhydrite and the aragonite can be dolomitized diagenetically. [...] Thermal contraction at night and expansion during the day leads to concave polygonal pans as the edges have been upturned, in part due to growth of evaporites wedging the crack apart. Below this is a gypsum mush where nodules of anhydrite and other sulfates may develop. These might also form a “chicken wire” crystalline structure. Below this are the intertidal deposits typified by laminated, organic-rich muds formed by the microbial mats that grade downward into more bioturbated muds. The subtidal facies show carbonate grainstones and lagoonal muds.|$|E
