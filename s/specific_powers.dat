5|$|The playable {{character}} can lead {{a group of}} three additional allies into battle, controlling their actions to attack a single enemy or to use <b>specific</b> <b>powers.</b> Characters can be set to one of three modes: defensive, neutral, or offensive. In defensive mode, the character remains distant from battles, while offensive mode sends the character directly into battle. The main character and active allies are represented by portraits on screen that reflect their current physical or emotional state, showing sadness, anger, feeding, or the presence of injuries or stakingâ€”having been stabbed through the heart and rendered immobile.|$|E
5|$|As the Chief Executive of the State of Maryland, the Governor {{heads the}} {{executive}} branch of government, which includes all state executive departments and agencies, as well as advisory boards, commissions, committees, and task forces. The main constitutional responsibility of the Governor of Maryland, and any other State's chief executive, is to carry out the business of the state and to enforce the laws passed by the Legislature. The Governor also has some say in these laws, since the Governor has the ability to veto any bill sent to his or her desk by the Maryland General Assembly, though the Assembly may override that veto. The Governor is also given a number of more <b>specific</b> <b>powers</b> as relates to appropriations of state funds, the appointment of state officials, and also a variety of less prominent and less commonly utilized powers.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} in order to design a tracking photovoltaic (PV) array and optimize the design for maximum <b>specific</b> <b>power.</b> The design considerations were minimal deployment time, high reliability, and small stowage volume. The array design was self-deployable, from a compact stowage configuration, using a passive pressurized gas deployment mechanism. The array structural components consist {{of a combination of}} beams, columns, and cables used to deploy and orient a flexible PV blanket. Each structural component of the design was analyzed to determine the size necessary to withstand the various forces to which it would be subjected. An optimization was performed to determine the array dimensions and blanket geometry which produce the maximum <b>specific</b> <b>power.</b> The optimization was performed for both lunar and Martian environments with 4 types of PV blankets (silicon, GaAs/Ge, GaAs CLEFT, and amorphous silicon). For the lunar environment, the amorphous silicon array produced the highest <b>specific</b> <b>power,</b> whereas, for Mars the GaAs CLEFT array produced the highest <b>specific</b> <b>power.</b> A comparison was made to a fixed PV tent array of similar design. The tracking array produced a higher <b>specific</b> <b>power</b> with all types of the PV blankets examined except amorphous silicon at both locations...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of oxygen from the lunar regolith requires both thermal and electrical power in roughly similar proportions. This unique power requirement is unlike most applications on the lunar surface. To efficiently meet these requirements, both solar PV array and solar concentrator systems were evaluated. The mass {{of various types}} of photovoltaic and concentrator based systems were calculated to determine the type of power system that provided the highest <b>specific</b> <b>power.</b> These were compared over a range of oxygen production rates. Also a hybrid type power system was also considered. This system utilized a photovoltaic array to produce the electrical power and a concentrator to provide the thermal power. For a single source system the three systems with the highest <b>specific</b> <b>power</b> were a flexible concentrator/Stirling engine system, a rigid concentrator/Stirling engine system and a tracking triple junction solar array system. These systems had <b>specific</b> <b>power</b> values of 43, 34, and 33 W/kg, respectively. The hybrid power system provided much higher <b>specific</b> <b>power</b> values then the single source systems. The best hybrid combinations were the triple junction solar array with the flexible concentrator and the rigid concentrator. These systems had a <b>specific</b> <b>power</b> of 81 and 68 W/kg, respectively...|$|R
25|$|Fire {{districts are}} public {{corporations}} that generally provide fire protection and other emergency response in towns outside villages. A fire district can levy taxes and incur debt just like other general purpose municipal corporations, although fire districts {{do not have}} home rule powers and the taxes are generally collected by the town or towns that the district serves. Fire districts depend on their towns for initial establishment, expansion of district territory, and dissolution, but are otherwise thereafter autonomous political entities able to exercise only those <b>specific</b> <b>powers</b> granted to them by statute. The district is governed by a board of elected commissioners.|$|E

500|$|Incorporated {{places in}} Maryland are self-governing {{municipalities}} chartered as cities, towns, or villages by an Act of the Maryland General Assembly or, in some cases, by a referendum. Municipalities are the lowest tier administrative {{units in the}} state, and all except Baltimore are also subject to county administration. Despite the designations of city, town, or village, there are no differences in municipal power and authority. There is no official classification of municipal governments and the municipalities are equal under state law. [...] The municipalities themselves decide whether to avail themselves of the <b>specific</b> <b>powers</b> conferred on them by the Maryland Constitution and state code. Since its separation from Baltimore County in 1851, the City of Baltimore functions more as a county than a city under state law since it exercises charter home rule, which empowers the city with broad legislative authority similar to Maryland's six home rule counties.|$|E
500|$|Initially, {{the game}} was more free-form, {{allowing}} players to purchase new powers at any point during the game, but the developers {{found it difficult to}} create a challenging game on that basis, particularly as they could not design missions calling for <b>specific</b> <b>powers</b> that the player may not have at that time. This evolved into the scheme of presenting new powers to the player {{over the course of the}} game, with the developers created guiding rules for which powers were ultimately included in the game and when: the power had to be useful and add something unique to the game, the player would need a chance to use that power immediately after they got it, and the power would need to be enjoyable to use. The team employed frequent reviews of when these powers were introduced to the player as other gameplay elements were added to the game. Not all powers were necessarily offensive; the [...] "postcognition" [...] power, allowing the player to see the psychic echo of a dead person of where they were before their death, was added as the team found there was an element of fun in tracking the echo through the crowded city. Some powers were cut from the game. One power, gained through the Evil karma path, was called [...] "Minionize", and would have allowed Cole to control the minds of civilians and force them to join him in battle. Although the power was [...] "decidedly evil and very fun to watch", the team felt it wasn't useful to the game, though they managed to retain a hint of it in one of the Evil side missions. Though the team had tested each of the core missions individually with the powers that the player would have based on the game's storyboard, they found that play-testers, who played the missions back-to-back, found the game lacked a variety of combat situations. The developers revisited all the combat scenarios from this feedback to alter the combat layouts as well as adding new enemies, a step that Bridges believes the game [...] "benefited greatly" [...] from. The ability to use Cole's electrical powers to ride along Empire City's elevated train rails was a last-minute addition during the last month of development based on a play-tester's suggestion.|$|E
