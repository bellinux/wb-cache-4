40|$|Domoic acid {{isolated}} from "hanayanagi", a red alga Chondria armata by Daigo et al. is a biotoxic amino acid, {{which had been}} used as an anthelmintic in the Ryukyu Islands. In Canada at 1987, a big amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP) case occurred due to ingestion of the cultured mussel. The causative agent was concluded to be domoic acid which a diatom Pseudonitzschia pungens forma multiseries produced. ASP infestation to bivalves has not been reported in Japan. On the other hand, "hanayanagi" is known to possess high concentration of domoic acid in Kagoshima, although the mechanism is unknown. In order to elucidate the origin of domoic acid, screening tests of domoic acid were carried out for many algae and shellfishes in Hanasezaki and Yakushima, Kagoshima Prefecture during November 1997 to December 1997. In this connection, seasonal variation of domoic acid content in "hanayanagi" was investigated at Hanasezaki, during November 1997 to July 1998. "Hanayanagi" showed high domoic acid content of 256. 0 - 903. Oppm at Hanasezaki during 1997 to 1998 and of 614. 4 ppm at Yakushima, in December 1997. A small seasonal variation of its content was recognized in Hanasezaki. Some seaweeds entwining "hanayanagi" showed comparatively high domoic acid content in the tide pool which "hanayanagi" inhabits, while others separating from "hanayanagi" showed a small or none content. However, domoic acid was not detected in the shellfishes investigated in Hanasezaki and Yakushima. The result of bioassay of domoic acid in a mouse showed that minimum dose of domoic acid to cause a mouse <b>scratching</b> <b>syndrome</b> was 30 Î¼g...|$|E
