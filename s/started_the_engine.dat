5|$|On 11 April 1939 he {{narrowly}} {{escaped with}} his life alongside Geoffrey de Havilland; both men parachuting to safety. They had taken a Moth Minor into the air to test its response to spins. The prototypes had an anti-spin parachute but preceding tests had been carried out without the need to resort to the safety measure. Geoffrey put the aircraft into a left-hand spin which was recovered. Climbing back to 8,000 feet the aircraft was put into it a right-hand spin. The engine cut out, the nose reared-up and the aircraft stalled and entered a flat spin. Geoffrey asked John through the Gosport tube to try to escape their perilous situation after the controls proved non-responsive to de Havilland's efforts. Both decided to parachute out. Upon doing so the Moth declined its nose and recovered from the spin. The engine ignition had been left on and the wind-milling propeller <b>started</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b> The aircraft began circling the descending airmen at dangerously close range. Fortunately it descended {{at a faster rate}} and was destroyed when it hit the ground. Cunningham casually took pictures of the wreckage and his parachute which exemplified his cool nature.|$|E
25|$|Development of {{the first}} {{generation}} Unreal Engine was carried out by the founder of Epic Games, Tim Sweeney. Inspired by John Carmack's pioneering programming work on Doom and then Quake, Sweeney <b>started</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> in 1995 for the production of a game that would later become known as Unreal, a first-person shooter set in a medieval world. After three years of development, it debuted with the game's release in 1998, although licensees such as MicroProse and Legend Entertainment had possessed the technology much earlier, with the first licensing deal taking place in 1996.|$|E
25|$|At 5:00 pm EST, 15-year-old Charlie J. Bishop's {{instructor}} {{left him}} at the plane to perform a preflight inspection. Once he was left alone in the plane, he <b>started</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> and took off without permission. As soon as the plane took off, the air traffic controllers alerted the United States Coast Guard and the MacDill Air Force Base. Despite repeated warnings from a helicopter dispatched by the Coast Guard, the small plane continued on until it collided with an office building. The plane crashed between the 28th and 29th floors of the 42-story building.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Engine</b> start: To <b>start</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine,</b> {{power is}} applied to MG1 {{to act as a}} starter. Because of the size of <b>the</b> motor generators, <b>starting</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> {{requires}} relatively little power from MG1 and the conventional starter motor sound is not heard. Engine start can occur while stopped or moving.|$|R

5000|$|Unlike a turbine engine, a {{hot start}} is {{unlikely}} to damage a reciprocating fuel injected engine. However,with improper <b>starting</b> procedure <b>the</b> situation may progress {{to the point that}} the operator depletes the starter battery before successfully <b>starting</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> and there is risk of battery or starter damage, and certainly excess wear, due to these repeated unsuccessful attempts to <b>start</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|R
25|$|Bennett parked her Cadillac {{convertible}} {{in the lot}} at {{the back}} of the MCA offices, at Santa Monica Boulevard and Rexford Drive, across the street from the Beverly Hills Police Department, and she and Lang drove off in his car. Meanwhile, her husband Walter Wanger drove by at about 2:30p.m. and noticed his wife's car parked there. Half an hour later, he again saw her car there and stopped to wait. Bennett and Lang drove into the parking lot a few hours later and he walked her to her convertible. As she <b>started</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine,</b> turned on the headlights and prepared to drive away, Lang leaned on the car, with both hands raised to his shoulders, and talked to her.|$|E
25|$|Stanger {{fell ill}} {{while he was}} aloft {{on one of his}} October sorties. He landed on a handy {{airfield}} and shut down his plane's engine before realizing he had landed on an Austro-Hungarian strip. His only chance to escape any enemy soldiers investigating the racket of an untimely landing was to restart his engine and fly away. The customary method for starting an engine was for a ground crew member to yank the propeller as a lever to crank the engine, while a pilot sat at the controls. Stanger's solution was to remove his boots and chock the landing gear tires with the footwear. He then cranked the prop, <b>started</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine,</b> circled about the rotating blades, clambered into the cockpit, and departed. The fate of the boots is unknown.|$|E
500|$|Haynes {{ordered a}} one-horsepower marine upright, two-cycle engine from Sintz Gas Engine Company in Grand Rapids, Michigan for $225. Although {{the engine was}} {{intended}} for use on a small boat, Haynes believed it could be adapted for his purposes. The [...] engine arrived {{in the fall of}} 1893. Haynes soon had the device attached to a carriage he built in his kitchen. He found when he <b>started</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> that its vibrations were too severe for the harness it was in, and before he could stop the engine it had done considerable damage to the carriage and the floor of his kitchen, and filled the room with smoke.|$|E

50|$|The {{fuel system}} as {{explained}} above {{is one of}} the two systems required for <b>starting</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b> <b>The</b> other is the actual ignition of the air/fuel mixture in the chamber. Usually, an auxiliary power unit is used to <b>start</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines.</b> It has a starter motor which has a high torque transmitted to the compressor unit. When the optimum speed is reached, i.e. the flow of gas through the turbine is sufficient, the turbines take over.|$|R
2500|$|E100 {{imposes a}} {{limitation}} on normal vehicle operation, as ethanol's lower evaporative pressure (as compared to gasoline) causes problems when cold {{starting the engine}} at temperatures below [...] For this reason, both pure ethanol and E100 flex-fuel vehicles are built with an additional small gasoline reservoir inside the engine compartment to help in starting the engine when cold by initially injecting gasoline. [...] Once <b>started,</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> is then switched back to ethanol. An improved flex-fuel engine generation was developed to {{eliminate the need for}} the secondary gas tank by warming the ethanol fuel during starting, and allowing them to start at temperatures as low as , the lowest temperature expected anywhere in the Brazilian territory. The Polo E-Flex, launched in March 2009, was the first flex-fuel model without an auxiliary tank for cold start. The warming system, called Flex Start, was developed by Robert Bosch GmbH.|$|E
2500|$|Because of the ruthlessness of {{the attacks}} carried out by his unit, Wright struck fear into nationalists and Catholics in his area. The Cappagh killings in {{particular}} surprised the Provisional IRA East Tyrone Brigade {{as they had been}} carried out in a village which was an IRA stronghold, a departure from the usual arbitrary killings of Catholic civilians [...] Wright boasted that he and his Mid-Ulster unit had [...] "put the East Tyrone Brigade of the IRA on the run" [...] and [...] "decimated" [...] them. The IRA tried unsuccessfully to kill Wright on five different occasions; on 23 October 1992 they planted a bomb under his car but it fell off. In June 1994, Wright again checked his car after the RUC told him that a man had been seen crouching suspiciously beside the vehicle in West Street, Portadown. Finding no bomb under the car, Wright sat in and <b>started</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine,</b> detonating the bomb planted in the engine. He escaped with minor injuries.|$|E

To detect the use of <b>the</b> <b>engine,</b> GNSS Flight Recorders used in motor gliders must have a noise sensor that allows recording the sound level along with position and altitude. In many competitions, the rules require that <b>the</b> pilot <b>start</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> at <b>the</b> beginning of <b>the</b> flight, before <b>starting</b> <b>the</b> task, to ensure an <b>engine</b> <b>start</b> later in <b>the</b> flight will be detected.|$|R
