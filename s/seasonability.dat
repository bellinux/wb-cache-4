25|$|Wharton {{professor}} Simon Kuznets, {{who later}} won the Nobel Prize in Economics, created statistical data on national output, prices, investment, and capital stock, and also measured <b>seasonability,</b> cycles, and secular trends of these phenomena. His work laid out {{what became the}} standard procedure for measuring {{the gross national product}} and the gross domestic product, and he later led an international effort to establish the same statistical information for all national economies. Professor Lawrence Klein, who also won the Nobel Prize in Economics, developed the first econometric model of the U.S. economy, which combined economic theory with mathematics, providing another way to test theories and predict future economic trends.|$|E
40|$|Biogas {{generated}} in a Municipal Solid Wastes landfill is collected and, when economically advantageous, it is exploited in internal combustion engines to produce electric energy, also {{taking into account}} that at present, excellent transformation efficiencies are achievable, precisely 38 - 40 % of the biogas thermal content. The flue gas deriving from combustion is at about 500 째C, in other terms it has still a valuable enthalpic content. In addition, the engines need lubrification and refrigeration loops, and intercooler devices to cool down the compressed gas mixture before entering the engines themselves. In this frame, thermal recovery is possible by modular heat exchangers: they produce hot water, cooling down respectively oil, water and gas. Moreover, the flue gas can be cooled from 500 째C to 180 째C. In this paper, the Municipal landfill of Torino, Northern Italy, has been considered for a study on thermal recovery from biogas after its energy exploitation. The considered recovery operations are: - district heating - absorption chilling - sludge drying - superheated steam production. Different scenarios are possible, according <b>seasonability,</b> thermal level and quantities of recover...|$|E
40|$|Coupled {{measurements}} of delta 18 O and accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) 14 C {{in a particular}} species of planktonic foraminifera {{may be used to}} calculate sea-level estimates for the last deglaciation. Of critical importance for this type of study is a knowledge of the seasonality of foraminiferal growth, which can be provided by delta 18 O {{measurements of}} modern shells (core tops, plankton tows). Isotopic (delta 18 O, AMS- 14 C dating) and faunal records (transfer function sea surface temperature) were obtained from two cores in the North Atlantic at about 37 째N. The locations were chosen to obtain high sedimentation rate records removed from the major ice-melt discharge areas of the last deglaciation. Based upon Globigerina bulloides data, four delta 18 O-based sea-level estimates were calculated: - 67 +/- 7 m at 12, 200 yr B. P. and - 24 +/- 8 m at about 8200 yr B. P. for core SU 81 - 18; - 83 +/- 10 m at 12, 200 yr B. P. and - 13 +/- 11 m at about 8500 yr B. P. for core SU 81 - 14. Using a second working hypothesis concerning the <b>seasonability</b> of G. bulloides growth, it is suggested that the sea-level rose by about 40 m during the millennium which followed 14, 500 yr B. P...|$|E
40|$|Sepsis-like {{illness is}} a main cause for {{hospital}} admission in young infants. Our {{aim was to}} investigate incidence, epidemiology and clinical characteristics of enterovirus (EV) and human parechovirus (HPeV) infections in young infants with sepsis-like illness. This is a prospective observational cohort study in which infants younger than 90 days of age, presenting with sepsis-like symptoms in a secondary care children's hospital, underwent a full sepsis work-up. Clinical signs and infectious indices were recorded. EV or HPeV RNA was detected by PCR in plasma and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Infants were diagnosed with EV, HPeV, fever of unknown origin or severe infection. EV and HPeV were detected in 132 / 353 (37 %) and 52 / 353 (15 %) of cases, respectively. EV and HPeV have distinct <b>seasonability.</b> Some differences in clinical signs and symptoms occurred between children with EV and HPeV infection, but were of limited clinical value. CSF pleocytosis occurred in 44 % of EV positive infants, and only in 13 % of those with HPeV infection. EV and HPeV infections are major causes of sepsis-like illness in infants < 90 days of age. Neither clinical characteristics nor laboratory indices were predictive for EV/HPeV infection. CSF pleocytosis occurs, but not in all patients. Testing for EV and HPeV in all young infants with sepsis-like illness is strongly advise...|$|E
40|$|Fusain occurs {{widely in}} Carboniferous coals and sediments. It is now {{recognised}} to represent charcoal {{and be the}} product of wildfire. The occurrence of fire is partly constrained by atmospheric oxygen levels, availability and nature of fuel and by aspects of climate (rainfall and <b>seasonability</b> in particular). The majority of fires in the Carboniferous were probably started by lightning strikes or by volcanic activity. Experiments on the charring of modern plants {{has shown that the}} reflectance of charcoal (and hence fusain) is directly related to temperature of formation. Different fire types may yield fusain assemblages of differing reflectance spectrums, but it may be significant that many modern charcoal assemblages yield only semifusinites (as seen by reflectance microscopy). The significance of these findings is assessed in relation to the use of fusinites and semifusinites as depositional indicators, as interpreted from coal petrology. Fires may have a dramatic effect on ecosystems, not only causing changes in vegetational succession but also severe erosion can occur following a major fire which can be traced in depositional systems. In this paper we document three major Carboniferous sedimentary systems affected by fire: clastic sedimentary systems, using extensive fusain deposits in mid-Lower Carboniferous, near-shore sediments in Donegal, Ireland; volcanic systems using late Early Carboniferous, volcaniclastic sequences in the Midland Valley of Scotland; and coal and coal-bearing sequences in the Upper Carboniferous (Westphalian B) of the Pennine Basin, England. In the later settings the influence of fire in peat formation and succession is assessed. In addition, data on the vegetational composition of charcoal assemblages is considered. It is concluded that fire {{plays a major role in}} many Carboniferous ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|Development of {{tropical}} spiny lobster aquaculture {{has occurred in}} Vietnam and more recently in Indonesia based on the collection of naturally settling puerulus. Strong market demand for spiny lobsters and static fishery production has driven such development. High availability of lobster seed has been identified for exploitation particularly in some locations and fishing methods have been developed which make capture of these post-larval lobsters quite straightforward. Such pueruli availability may exist throughout the South East Asian region providing opportunity of industry expansion. A research project is supporting assessment of pueruli resources in Indonesia and providing baseline data on puerulus catch. Capture data over several years is now available which provide a comprehensive picture of spatial distribution, species composition, <b>seasonability,</b> inter-annual variability, catch per unit effort, pricing and total production. Methods of puerulus capture, their innovation and evolution are described. The delicate nature of pueruli has resulted in high mortality through the production chain and the processes involved in their handling and improvements recommended are discussed. In particular, a nursery phase close {{to the point of}} capture is advisable to produce robust juveniles suitable for transport to grow out locations. Management of the puerulus resources of Vietnam and Indonesia is advisable, but difficult given lack of information about the source breeding populations and effectiveness of the catching methods. Sustainability of the wild catch is of concern but may be offset by development of a hatchery supply. The lobster aquaculture industry of Vietnam has provided demonstrable benefit to coastal fishing communities and is likely to provide equivalent bene fit in Indonesia. Such benefits may be expanded to other parts of South East Asia and hopefully can be achieved on a sustainable basis...|$|E
