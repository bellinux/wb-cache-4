40|$|Cultivation of microalgae in open {{ponds and}} closed photobioreactors (PBRs) using {{wastewater}} resources offers {{an opportunity for}} biochemical nutrient recovery. Effective reactor system design and process control of PBRs requires process models. Several models with different complexities {{have been developed to}} predict microalgal growth. However, none of these models can effectively describe all the relevant processes when microalgal growth is coupled with nutrient removal and recovery from wastewaters. Here, we present a mathematical model developed to simulate green microalgal growth (ASM-A) using the systematic approach of the activated sludge modelling (ASM) framework. The process model – identified based on a literature review and using new experimental data – accounts for factors influencing photoautotrophic and heterotrophic microalgal growth, nutrient uptake and storage (i. e. Droop model) and decay of microalgae. Model parameters were estimated using laboratory-scale batch and <b>sequenced</b> <b>batch</b> experiments using the novel Latin Hypercube Sampling based Simplex (LHSS) method. The model was evaluated using independent data obtained in a 24 -L PBR operated in <b>sequenced</b> <b>batch</b> mode. Identifiability of the model was assessed. The model can effectively describe microalgal biomass growth, ammonia and phosphate concentrations as well as the phosphorus storage using a set of average parameter values estimated with the experimental data. A statistical analysis of simulation and measured data suggests that culture history and substrate availability can introduce significant variability on parameter values for predicting the reaction rates for bulk nitrate and the intracellularly stored nitrogen state-variables, thereby requiring scenario specific model calibration. ASM-A was identified using standard cultivation medium and it can provide a platform for extensions accounting for factors influencing algal growth and nutrient storage using wastewater resources...|$|E

Through the addition of both stirring up to 400 RPM and nitrogen sparging, the yields were enhanced from 1. 6 to 3. 1 molH 2 ·molglucose- 1 and the maximum hydrogen production rates from 140 to 278 mL·h- 1. These original results were achieved with a pure Clostridium strain. They showed that hydrogen production was improved by a higher liquid-to-gas hydrogen transfer resulting in a lower dissolved hydrogen concentration in the culture medium and therefore in a lower bacterial inhibition. In addition, biohydrogen partitioning between the gas and the liquid phase did not conform to Henry’s Law due to critical supersaturation phenomena up to seven-fold higher than the equilibrium conditions. Therefore dissolved hydrogen concentration should be systematically measured instead of the headspace hydrogen partial pressure.

Evaluating {{the effect}} of {{manufacturing}} porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) -contaminated feed on subsequent feed mill environmental surface contamination. Journal of Animal Science, 94, 77 - 77. doi: 10. 2527 /msasas 2016 - 164 With the introduction of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) to the United States in 2013 and the subsequent identification of feed as a route of transmission, identifying sources of feedstuff contamination and methods {{to reduce the risk}} of transmission at feed mills has become paramount. As with other biological hazards, contaminated ingredients can easily lead to cross-contamination of finished feeds and contamination throughout the facility. Therefore, the objective of this study was to monitor equipment and environmental contamination after manufacturing PEDV-positive feed and after the production of subsequent PEDV-negative feed. PEDV-positive feed (50 kg with 4. 5 × 104 TCID 50 /g, Ct 11) was mixed in a 0. 11 m 3 paddle mixer, discharged into a bucket elevator, and collected. Following processing of the contaminated feed, 4 subsequent batches of PEDV-free feed (sequence 1 – 4) were processed through the mixer and bucket elevator with no decontamination between batches to mimic commercial feed production. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus contamination of equipment and surrounding areas were monitored via the collection of swabs that were analyzed via quantitative PCR (qPCR) for PEDV RNA. Swabs were collected from equipment and facility surfaces prior and after processing contaminated feed and after processing subsequent <b>sequenced</b> <b>batch</b> diets. Monitored areas for equipment included the interior of the mixer and bucket elevator. Facility areas included high and low foot traffic areas (concrete), floor drain (concrete), worker boot bottoms (rubber), table (metal), and door (metal). Three replications of contaminated feed and subsequent sequence batch diet processing was completed, with equipment and facility decontamination between replicates. Following qPCR analysis, Ct values ? 40 were considered PEDV-positive and all numerical data was converted to ± for statistical analysis via PROC MIXED procedure of SAS. The interactions feed contact surface by sequence were found to be significant (P < 0. 01). All swabs collected from equipment surfaces after processing of PEDV-positive feed were positive for PEDV, while 16 of 18 of the collected facility swabs were positive for PEDV RNA. Following processing of the first sequence batch diet, 100 % of equipment surfaces and 88. 9 % of facility surfaces were positive for PEDV. Surprisingly, a large percentage of equipment and facility surfaces remained PEDV-positive through the processing of the subsequent sequence batch diets. Furthermore, all swabs collected from concrete and rubber surfaces remained PEDV-positive through all processing of all diets. This study demonstrates the extent of equipment and facility contamination that could occur in a feed manufacturing facility after processing of PEDV-contaminated feed...|$|E
40|$|Due {{to limited}} water {{resources}} {{available in the}} world and the ever growing world population, there is an increasing need for water recycling, recovery and multi-sourcing strategies. One of the new physical process technologies being investigated for water purification and/or constituent recycling is ultrasonic particle separation. This technology is especially interesting for harvesting particles with an almost neutral buoyancy. An ultrasonic particle filter does not use a filter medium, like sand or a membrane, but filters on a basis of acoustic forces in ultrasonic standing waves, which are able to immobilise particles in flowing water. The objective of this study was to develop an ultrasonic separation device for particle recovery and water purification. This separator should be fit for industrial applications treating cubic meters of water per hour. In order to reach this objective, a combined numerical-experimental approach was proposed to develop a model-based design of an ultrasonic separator. Each individual component of this separator was modelled using a finite element (FE) approach. The numerical simulations were continuously cross-checked with experiments in order to find the best solution possible. In this thesis, the source of the acoustic wave is a piezoelectric transducer attached to a glass matching layer of the acoustic cavity, which couples the transducer to the fluid inside the cavity, forming an acoustic resonator/separator. In order to obtain a valid FE transducer model, a limited set of material parameters for the piezoelectric transducer were obtained from the manufacturer, thus preserving prior physical knowledge to a large extent. The remaining unknown parameters were estimated from impedance (admittance) analysis combined with a numerical optimisation routine using 2 D and 3 D FE models. Thus, a full set of physically interpretable material parameters was obtained. The approach provided adequate accuracy of the estimates of the material parameters, near 1 %. A similar approach as used for the transducer was applied to an existing ultrasonic separator, again preserving known physical parameters and estimating the remaining unknown or less certain parameters. The results showed that the approach led to a fully calibrated 2 D model of the emptyseparator, which was subsequently validated with experiments on a filledseparator chamber. The large sensitivity of the separator to small variations indicated that either such system should be made and operated within tight specifications to obtain the required performance. Alternatively, the operation of the system should be adaptable to cope with a slightly off-spec system, requiring a feedback controller. Starting from a fully characterised existing separator with all material parameters found so far, the subsequent step was the actual design of, or extrapolation to, a new separator. A basic design for an industrial scale acoustic separator was obtained based on simulated flow characteristics inside the separation chamber, on acoustic analysis within the chamber and simulated particle trajectories combining these two analyses. Results showed that positioning the piezoelectric transducer surfaces perpendicular to the flow direction and introducing chamber partitioning with multiple flow lanes to enforce laminar flow, resulted in high particle retention. The average particle displacement was found to be related to acoustic pressure in the fluid, showing large retention at peak pressures above 1 MPa or average pressures above 0. 5 MPa for small (10 µm), near buoyant (1100 kg/m 3) particles at a flow speed of 3. 5 cm/s, thus providing comprehensible criteria for subsequent optimisation. This basic ultrasonic standing wave separator design was optimised with respect to separation efficiency, throughput and energy consumption. The methodology, using a design of experiments (DOE) approach, showed that it was possible to improve system performance based on acoustic pressure profiles, separation efficiency and flow robustness. Compromising the energy consumption and aiming for maximum separation efficiency with a laminar stable flow up to 5 ml/s resulted in a separator with inner dimensions of 70 mm length, 20 mm width and 28. 5 mm height using two transducers perpendicular to the direction of flow and three parallel flow lanes with 9. 5 mm height each. The lowest power consumption (with an average of 30 W) with adequate pressure to trap the particles was obtained when it was not operated at the main eigenfrequency. Finally, this new ultrasonic particle filter was built and evaluated experimentally. The particle filter was a three channel device, manufactured from glass with four in/outlet ports made of ABS. It was operated in <b>sequenced</b> <b>batch</b> mode and the separation efficiency was determined at three flow rates ranging from 1 to 3 ml/s, using a stock suspension of insoluble potato starch of 1 g/l (1000 ppm). Concentrations of stock, filtrate and concentrate were measured using a turbidity meter and significant effects of acoustic particle concentration were measured at both outlets of the process. The maximum filtration efficiency and concentration efficiency were 54 % and 76 %, respectively. The performance found was lower than the 100 % that was expected for 10 µm particles from the model based design study. The deviation in performance is mainly a result of (i) the pulsation of the feed pump, (ii) differences between the model and the actual prototype, (iii) the limited power supply of only 10 W used and (iv) (too) small particles, below 10 µm, occurring in the starch suspension. The best dimensions for an acoustic separator were obtained, but thus far operational characteristics were not yet studied. Operational characterisation and optimisation is the last step in the process of obtaining the best possible solution for operation. With the aim to achieve a high separation efficiency with minimal energy consumption, a model-based open-loop switching control strategy was designed for the commercially available BioSep, using a numerical-experimental approach. Firstly, a dynamic BioSep model structure was derived from mass balances and its system properties were studied. Then, the unknown system parameters were estimated from steady state and dynamic experimental data and subsequently, the switching times of the control input were determined. The model with switching control outputs was then validated by experiments. Finally, the control strategy was implemented in an experimental setup and tested using suspended potato starch. Results showed that the optimal control strategy reached a mass separation efficiency of 96 %, which was an improvement of 4 % with respect to the initial settings, while using less energy. Concluding, a stepwise numerical-experimental approach to acoustic separator design was presented in this study. The minimum power required was estimated to be 22 - 34 W, resulting in an average electric energy consumption of 1 - 1. 5 kWh/m 3. The practical concentration efficiency obtained was 76 % at a flow rate of 2 ml/s and a filtration efficiency of 54 % at 1 ml/s with a real power input of 8. 8 W. An optimal open loop control strategy showed that it is possible to operate an acoustic separator with high separation efficiency using the least power possible. Parallelisation, instead of enlarging the separator, is recommended to scale this system up to larger, industrial flows...|$|E

Such changes in reactor performance were related with structural variations in the microbial community, particularly the bacterial community, with repeated cycles. Methanosaeta- and Methanolinea-related populations were most likely the main aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens, respectively, in the reactor. The emergence and prevalence of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRBs), primarily a Solitalea-related population, most likely resulted in increased consumption of organic substrates for sulfate reduction, rather than methane production, in later cycles.

Saccharomycotina, Fusarium, and Aspergillus were detected in both anaerobic baffled reactor and <b>sequencing</b> <b>batch</b> reactor during summer and winter. The fungal communities in anaerobic baffled reactor and <b>sequencing</b> <b>batch</b> reactor were shaped by seasons and treatment units, while there was no correlation between abundance of fungi and chemical oxygen demand removal rates. Compared to summer, {{the total amount of}} the dominant hydrocarbon degrading bacteria decreased by 10. 2 % in anaerobic baffled reactor, resulting in only around 23 % of chemical oxygen demand was removed in winter. Although microbial community significantly varied in the three parallel sulfide reducing bacteria, the performance of these bioreactors had no significant difference between summer and winter...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this work}} were to demonstrate the potential of a two-phase <b>sequencing</b> <b>batch</b> reactor in degrading xenobiotics and to evaluate the kinetic parameters leading to a mathematical model of the system. 4 -Nitrophenol (4 NP), a typical representative of substituted phenols, {{was selected as the}} target xenobiotic; this compound has never been remediated in a two-phase bioreactor before. Partition tests were conducted to determine the most appropriate partitioning solvent, and among the three investigated solvents (1 -undecanol, 2 -undecanone and oleyl alcohol), 2 -undecanone was chosen because of its favourable partition coefficient and its negligible emulsion-forming tendencies. Moreover, the selected solvent showed satisfactory biocompatibility characteristics with respect to the biomass, with only minor effects on the intrinsic microbial kinetics. Kinetic tests were then performed in a <b>sequencing</b> <b>batch</b> reactor (2 -l volume) operated in both conventional one- and two-phase configurations, with the two-phase system showing a significant improvement in the process kinetics in terms of reduced inhibition and increased maximum removal rate. The obtained kinetic parameters suggest that the two-phase <b>sequencing</b> <b>batch</b> system may find full-scale application, as the maximum removal rate k max (∼ 3 mg 4 NP mgVSS- 1 day- 1) is of the same order of magnitude of heterotrophic bacteria operating in wastewater treatment plants. © 2008 Springer-Verlag...|$|R

40|$|Biological {{treatment}} of dairy wastewater was investigated using a laboratory scale aerobic <b>sequencing</b> <b>batch</b> flexible fibre biofilm reactor (SBFFBR). The SBFFBR system was modified from a typical <b>sequencing</b> <b>batch</b> reactor system by using eight flexible fibre bundles {{with a very}} high specific surface area, which served as support for microorganisms. The reactor was operated under different influent chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentrations (610, 2041 and 4382 mg l- 1) and constant hydraulic retention times of 1. 6 days. The results have shown successful applicability of the SBFFBR system to treat this dairy wastewater. High COD removal efficiencies between 89. 7 and 97 % were achieved at average organic loading rates of 0. 4 and 2. 74 kg COD m- 3 d- 1, respectively.

Using stable-isotope probing, full-cycle rRNA analysis, and fluorescence in situ hybridization-microautoradiography (FISH-MAR), Ginige et al. (2004; 2005) characterized methanol-fed and acetate-fed denitrifying microbial community in <b>sequencing</b> <b>batch</b> reactors, respectively, and found Methylophilales bacteria were the dominant denitrifiers in methanol-fed denitrifying <b>sequencing</b> <b>batch</b> reactor while Comamonadaceae and Rhodocyclaceae were the dominant denitrifiers in the acetate-fed reactor. Osaka et al. (2008) characterized the differences of microbial community structure between two active sludge reactors using acetate and methanol as the external carbon source by using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and cloning analysis. Baytshtok et al.

In addition, effects of different alternative carbon sources on denitrifying microbial community structure were also carried out using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based molecular techniques or high-throughput techniques (Warneke et al. 2011; Lv et al. 2014).|$|R
