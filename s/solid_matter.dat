Despite the similarity of this concept to that of Ptolemy's Planetary Hypotheses, al-Haytham's presentation differs in sufficient detail that {{it has been argued that}} it reflects an independent development of the concept. In chapters 15–16 of his Book of Optics, Ibn al-Haytham also said that the celestial spheres do not consist of <b>solid</b> <b>matter.</b>|$|E

40|$|Behavior of <b>solid</b> <b>matters</b> {{and heavy}} metals during {{conductive}} drying process {{of sewage sludge}} was evaluated in a sewage sludge disposal center in Beijing, China. The results showed most of <b>solid</b> <b>matters</b> could be retained in the dried sludge after drying. Just about 3. 1 % of <b>solid</b> <b>matters</b> were evaporated with steam mainly by the form of volatile fatty acids. Zn was the dominant heavy metal in the sludge, followed by Cu, Cr, Pb, Ni, Hg, and Cd. The heavy metals in the condensate were all below the detection limit except Hg. Hg in the condensate accounted for less than 0. 1 % of the total Hg. It can be concluded {{that most of the}} heavy metals are also retained in the dried sludge during the drying process, but their bioavailability could be changed significantly. The results are useful for sewage sludge utilization and its condensate treatment...|$|R

25|$|The {{microphone}} design {{differs from}} that of a conventional audio system in that the peculiar features of infrasound are taken into account. First, infrasound propagates over vast distances through the Earth's atmosphere as a result of very low atmospheric absorption and of refractive ducting that enables propagation by way of multiple bounces between the Earth's surface and the stratosphere. A second property that has received little attention is the great penetration capability of infrasound through <b>solid</b> <b>matter</b> – a property utilized in the design and fabrication of the system windscreens.|$|E

In addition, water qualitiy of Jingyuetan Lake was evaluated based on the microorganisms indication. The results showed that SC contains abundant algae, protozoa, and metazoa, while both Species and quantity of algae and protoza on DS were less than SC greatly. As far as SPM, species and quantity of algae and protoza were in the midist. Evaluation of water quality based on the indication of algae suggested that Jingyuetan Lake was contaminated with organic pollutants...|$|R
25|$|The {{density of}} a liquid is usually {{close to that}} of a solid, and much higher than in a gas. Therefore, liquid and solid are both termed {{condensed}} matter. On the other hand, as liquids and gases share the ability to flow, they are both called fluids. Although liquid water is abundant on Earth, this state of matter is actually the least common in the known universe, because liquids require a relatively narrow temperature/pressure range to exist. Most known matter in the universe is in gaseous form (with traces of detectable <b>solid</b> <b>matter)</b> as interstellar clouds or in plasma form within stars.|$|E

25|$|Presolar grains are {{interstellar}} <b>solid</b> <b>matter</b> in {{the form}} of tiny solid grains that originated at a time before the Sun was formed (presolar: before the Sun). Meteoriticists often use the term to represent stardust, grains that originated within a single star and which they extract from meteorites for study. Because most interstellar grains are not stardust from a single star, however, being instead interstellar cloud matter accreted by smaller presolar grains, most presolar grains are also not stardust. Logically, all stardust are presolar grains; but not all presolar grains are stardust. This confusing terminology is heavily entrenched among 21st century meteoriticists who prefer to use the terms interchangeably, however, so it is best to live with both usages or to write presolar stardust grains for stardust.|$|E
25|$|The {{vitreous}} is the transparent, colourless, {{gelatinous mass}} that fills {{the space between}} the lens of the eye and the retina lining the back of the eye. It is produced by certain retinal cells. It is of rather similar composition to the cornea, but contains very few cells (mostly phagocytes which remove unwanted cellular debris in the visual field, as well as the hyalocytes of Balazs of the surface of the vitreous, which reprocess the hyaluronic acid), no blood vessels, and 98–99% of its volume is water (as opposed to 75% in the cornea) with salts, sugars, vitrosin (a type of collagen), a network of collagen type II fibres with the mucopolysaccharide hyaluronic acid, and also a wide array of proteins in micro amounts.

25|$|The {{purpose of}} {{disinfection}} {{in the treatment}} of waste water is to substantially reduce the number of microorganisms in the water to be discharged back into the environment for the later use of drinking, bathing, irrigation, etc. The effectiveness of disinfection depends {{on the quality of the}} water being treated (e.g., cloudiness, pH, etc.), the type of disinfection being used, the disinfectant dosage (concentration and time), and other environmental variables. Cloudy water will be treated less successfully, since <b>solid</b> <b>matter</b> can shield organisms, especially from ultraviolet light or if contact times are low. Generally, short contact times, low doses and high flows all militate against effective disinfection. Common methods of disinfection include ozone, chlorine, ultraviolet light, or sodium hypochlorite. Chloramine, which is used for drinking water, is not used {{in the treatment of}} waste water because of its persistence. After multiple steps of disinfection, the treated water is ready to be released back into the water cycle by means of the nearest body of water or agriculture. Afterwards, the water can be transferred to reserves for everyday human uses.|$|E

40|$|Oceanic crust {{expansion}} belt is {{the largest}} extensional structure on the earth. All the crustal movement theories {{have to face the}} phenomenon of oceanic crust expansion. The paper tries to interpret the phenomenon of oceanic crust expansion by the volume change of the earth and the satellite data. The oceanic crust expansion {{is the result of the}} volume change of the earth. The vo-lume change of the earth’s mantle is the element causing the volume change of the earth; the state variation of the <b>solid</b> <b>matters</b> within the earth is the element leading to the volume increase of the earth’s mantle; while the discharge of liquid matters within the earth is the element leading to the volume decrease of the earth’s mantle. The process of oceanic crust expansion can be divided into two phases—expansion and top mounting. The phase of expansion is the volume increase of the earth’s mantle, that is, the state variation of the <b>solid</b> <b>matters</b> within the earth leading to the ocea-nic crust expansion. The phase of top mounting is the volume decrease of the earth’s mantle; that is, the matters of the earth’s mantle (new oceanic crust) are uplifted to be the oceanic crust mat-ters under the action of buoyancy, which is one of the ways to discharge the matters within the earth.

40|$|Antibiotic mycelial dreg is a {{hazardous}} pollutant {{that is difficult}} to deal with because of its high contents of moisture and biomass pectin. Our previous work has demonstrated that the hydrothermal treatment (HTT) provides a feasible way to produce safe solid biofuel by reducing its moisture and nitrogen contents and decomposing its residual antibiotics. This study is devoted to further investigating the HTT through characterizing the HTT produced solid biofuels using oxygen bomb calorimeter, XPS, FTIR, XRF, TGA, DTA and so on. The results showed that the higher heating value (HHV) of the solid biofuel can reach about 26. 5 kI/g, which was much higher than the HHV of dried raw antibiotic mycelial dreg made by conventional drying (only 19. 3 kJ/g). Moreover, the N content was lowered from 7. 7 wt. % in the dried raw antibiotic mycelial dreg to 5. 6 wt. % in the 200 degrees C HTT produced solid biofuel, while most alkaline metals and chlorine in ash of antibiotic mycelial dreg were leached out with centrifugation after HTT. The atomic ratios of H/C and O/C in the solid biofuels both decreased with increasing the temperature of HTT, indicating the occurrence of dehydration, decarboxylation and hydrolysis of <b>solid</b> <b>matters</b> in the dreg. The HTT also greatly improved the combustion reactivity of the <b>solid</b> <b>matters</b> in the antibiotic mycelial dreg. All of these show that HTT provides indeed an effective way to convert the antibiotic mycelial dreg into high-quality solid biofuel. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. </p...|$|R

40|$|A smooth unclustered {{dark matter}} {{component}} with negative presure could reconcile a flat universe {{with the many}} observations that find a density in ordinary, clustered matter well below the critical density and also explain the recent high redshift supernova data suggesting that {{the expansion of the}} universe is now accelerating. For a perfect fluid negative presure leads to instabilities that are most severe on the shortest scales. However, if instead the dark <b>matter</b> is a <b>solid,</b> with an elastic resistance to pure shear deformations, an equation of state with negative presure can avoid these short wavelength instabilities. Such a solid may arise as the result of different kinds of microphysics. Two possible candidates for a <b>solid</b> dark <b>matter</b> component are a frustrated network of non-Abelian cosmic strings or a frustrated network of domain walls. If these networks settle down to an equilibrium configuration that gets carried along and stretched by the Hubble flow, equations of state result with $w=- 1 / 3 $ and $w=- 2 / 3,$ respectively. One expects the sound speeds for the <b>solid</b> dark <b>matter</b> component to comprise an appreciable fraction of the speed of light. Therefore, the <b>solid</b> dark <b>matter</b> does not cluster, expect on the very largest scales, accessible only through observing the large-angle CMB anisotropy. In this paper we develop a generally-covariant, continuum description for the dynamics of a <b>solid</b> dark <b>matter</b> component. We derive the evolution equations for the cosmological perturbations in a flat universe with CDM+(solid) and compute the resulting large-angle CMB anisotropy.
