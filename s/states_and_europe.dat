5|$|Giant mouse lemurs {{are rarely}} kept in captivity, though they breed easily. In 1989, the Duke Lemur Center held more than 70% of the captive {{population}} (45 of 62individuals). At the time, the DLC was coordinating a captive breeding program for Coquerel's giant mouse lemur, and all individuals kept at American facilities were descended from six individuals imported by the DLC in 1982 {{from the region}} around Ambanja. As of 2009, the International Species Information System (ISIS) recorded only six remaining individuals registered in the United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>Europe,</b> all reclassified as northern giant mouse lemurs and considered a non-breeding population; and in 2015, only a single female remained on record.|$|E

5|$|In 1849 James Goodhue began {{publication}} of the Minnesota Pioneer newspaper in Saint Paul (the paper would later be renamed the St. Paul Pioneer Press). By the time the area achieved statehood 89 newspapers had been established.

These efforts met with limited success though they would become much more successful after statehood.|$|E

Nominally a treaty of friendship, the agreement soon {{paved the way for}} the opening of Japan and normal trade relations with the United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>Europe.</b>|$|E

5|$|M.I.A.'s debut studio album, Arular, was {{initially}} {{scheduled to be}} released in September 2004, but the release was delayed by six months due to problems with the clearance of samples used in the songs. She released two singles and a mixtape in the interim. Although the album had limited commercial success, it was highly regarded by music critics for its blending of genres such as grime, hip hop, ragga and Brazilian baile funk, and for its politicised lyrics. Music magazines in the United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>Europe</b> included it in lists of the best albums of the year, and it was nominated for the Mercury Prize in the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|Throughout June {{and into}} July 1944, {{material}} from the Vrba–Wetzler and earlier reports appeared in newspapers and radio broadcasts in the United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>Europe,</b> particularly in Switzerland, prompting world leaders to appeal to Hungarian regent Miklós Horthy to halt the deportations. On 7 July 1944, Horthy ordered an end to them, possibly fearing he would be held responsible after the war. By then 437,000 Jews had been deported, constituting almost the entire Jewish population of the Hungarian countryside, but another 200,000 in Budapest were saved.|$|E
5|$|After {{his return}} to Parliament in 1922, Lansbury was denied office in the brief Labour {{government}} of 1924, although he served as First Commissioner of Works in the Labour government of 1929–31. After {{the political and economic}} crisis of August 1931, Lansbury did not follow his leader, Ramsay MacDonald, into the National Government, but remained with the Labour Party. As the most senior of the small contingent of Labour MPs that survived the 1931 general election, Lansbury became the Leader of the Labour Party. His pacifism and his opposition to rearmament in the face of rising European fascism put him at odds with his party, and when his position was rejected at the 1935 Labour Party conference, he resigned the leadership. He spent his final years travelling through the United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>Europe</b> in the cause of peace and disarmament.|$|E
5|$|Born in Los Angeles to second-generation Chinese-American parents, Wong became {{infatuated}} with {{the movies and}} began acting in films at an early age. During the silent film era, she acted in The Toll of the Sea (1922), {{one of the first}} movies made in color and Douglas Fairbanks' The Thief of Bagdad (1924). Wong became a fashion icon and had achieved international stardom in 1924. Frustrated by the stereotypical supporting roles she reluctantly played in Hollywood, Wong left for Europe in the late 1920s, where she starred in several notable plays and films, among them Piccadilly (1929). She spent {{the first half of the}} 1930s traveling between the United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>Europe</b> for film and stage work. Wong was featured in films of the early sound era, such as Daughter of the Dragon (1931) and Daughter of Shanghai (1937) and with Marlene Dietrich in Josef von Sternberg's Shanghai Express (1932).|$|E

40|$|Most {{analyses}} on the European {{integration process}} {{are dedicated to}} the impact of external factors on the European Union, or on the influence of Member State, to explain EU evolution. In this perspective, the State is envisaged as an intangible and stable reality on which is based the European construction. However, mainly {{since the end of the}} cold war, this picture is questioned by analyses concluding on a State weakened by evolutions and factors. Henceforth, the relationship between the <b>State</b> <b>and</b> <b>Europe</b> which, previously could be seen as an equation with one unknown, i. e. the future of the European integration, is an equation with two unknowns, the <b>State</b> <b>and</b> <b>Europe.</b> In such context, the central question of the present contribution can be formulated in the following terms: in a context of transformation crisis of the State, does the European governance stimulate the shift from "government" towards "governance"...|$|R

5|$|Five {{medications}} {{have evidence}} for long-term use orlistat, lorcaserin, liraglutide, phentermine–topiramate, and naltrexone–bupropion. They result in weight loss {{after one year}} ranged from 3.0 to 6.7kg over placebo. Orlistat, liraglutide, and naltrexone–bupropion are available in both the United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>Europe,</b> whereas lorcaserin and phentermine–topiramate are available only in the United States. European regulatory authorities rejected the latter two drugs {{in part because of}} associations of heart valve problems with lorcaserin and more general heart and blood vessel problems with phentermine–topiramate. Orlistat use is associated with high rates of gastrointestinal side effects and concerns have been raised about negative effects on the kidneys. There is no information on how these drugs affect longer-term complications of obesity such as cardiovascular disease or death.|$|E

5|$|Leave Home is {{the second}} studio album by American punk rock band the Ramones. It was {{released}} on January 10, 1977, through Sire Records, with the expanded CD being released through Rhino Entertainment on June 19, 2001. Songs on the album were written immediately after the band's first album's writing process, which demonstrated the band's progression. The album had a higher production value than their debut Ramones and featured faster tempos. The front photo was taken by Moshe Brakha and the back cover, which would become the band's logo, was designed by Arturo Vega. The album spawned three singles, but only one succeeded in charting.
