25|$|It is {{apparent}} {{from the above}} process that the matrix stiffness method is easier to comprehend and to implement for automatic computation. It is also easier to extend for advanced applications such as non-linear analysis, stability, vibrations, etc. For these reasons, the matrix stiffness method is the method of choice for use in general purpose <b>structural</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>software</b> packages. On the other hand, for linear systems with a low degree of statical indeterminacy, the flexibility method {{has the advantage of}} being computationally less intensive. This advantage, however, is a moot point as personal computers are widely available and more powerful. The main redeeming factor in learning this method nowadays is its educational value in imparting the concepts of equilibrium and compatibility in addition to its historical value. In contrast, the procedure of the direct stiffness method is so mechanical that it risks being used without much understanding of the structural behaviors.|$|E
25|$|When {{there are}} many degrees of freedom, one method of {{visualizing}} the mode shapes is by animating them using <b>structural</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>software</b> such as Femap or ANSYS. An example of animating mode shapes {{is shown in the}} figure below for a cantilevered -beam as demonstrated using modal analysis on ANSYS. In this case, the finite element method was used to generate an approximation of the mass and stiffness matrices by meshing the object of interest in order to solve a discrete eigenvalue problem. Note that, in this case, the finite element method provides an approximation of the meshed surface (for which there exists an infinite number of vibration modes and frequencies). Therefore, this relatively simple model that has over 100 degrees of freedom and hence as many natural frequencies and mode shapes, provides a good approximation for the first natural frequencies and modes. Generally, only the first few modes are important for practical applications.|$|E

This work presents finite-element-based {{bottom hole assembly}} model which addresses natural frequencies determination, and torsional and lateral oscillations on the near vertical well. In terms of the excitations of the developed finite-element model, forces are applied on the bit with time history generated using an Auto-Regressive Moving-Average digital filter. Due to the random pattern of the forces at the drill bit, a stochastic dynamic approach is adopted in investigating the problem. The method of Newmark-beta direct integration is used. It is hoped that this study will enhance the interest in using stochastic dynamic techniques in drilling system analysis and design, as they can capture quite appropriately the inherent uncertainty of the bit forces and, potentially, of other sources.
