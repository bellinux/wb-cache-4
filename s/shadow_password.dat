50|$|The <b>shadow</b> <b>{{password}}</b> {{system is}} used to limit access to hashes and salt. The salt is 8 characters, the hash is 86 characters, and the password length is unlimited.|$|E
5000|$|With a <b>shadowed</b> <b>password</b> {{scheme in}} use, the [...] file {{typically}} shows a character such as , or [...] in the password field for each user {{instead of the}} hashed password, and [...] usually contains the following user information: ...|$|R
50|$|The file's name {{originates}} {{from one}} of its initial functions as it contained the data used to verify passwords of user accounts. However, on modern Unix systems the security-sensitive password information is instead often stored in a different file using <b>shadow</b> <b>passwords,</b> or other database implementations.|$|R
50|$|<b>Password</b> <b>shadowing</b> first {{appeared}} in Unix systems {{with the development of}} SunOS in the mid-1980s, System V Release 3.2 in 1988 and BSD4.3 Reno in 1990. But, vendors who had performed ports from earlier UNIX releases did not always include the new <b>password</b> <b>shadowing</b> features in their releases, leaving users of those systems exposed to password file attacks.|$|R
5000|$|For example, the <b>shadow</b> <b>password</b> record [...] {{specifies}} a cost parameter of 10, indicating 210 key expansion rounds. The salt is [...] and {{the resulting}} hash is [...] Per standard practice, the user's password itself is not stored.|$|E
50|$|System administrators {{may also}} arrange for {{the storage of}} {{passwords}} in distributed databases such as NIS and LDAP, rather than in files on each connected system. In the case of NIS, the <b>shadow</b> <b>password</b> mechanism is often still used on the NIS servers; in other distributed mechanisms the problem {{of access to the}} various user authentication components is handled by the security mechanisms of the underlying data repository.|$|E
5000|$|In 1987 {{the author}} of the {{original}} <b>Shadow</b> <b>Password</b> Suite, Julie Haugh, experienced a computer break-in and wrote the initial release of the Shadow Suite containing the , [...] and [...] commands. The original release, written for the SCO Xenix operating system, quickly got ported to other platforms. The Shadow Suite was ported to Linux in 1992 one year after the original announcement of the Linux project, and was included in many early distributions, and continues to be included in many current Linux distributions.|$|E
5000|$|Prior to <b>{{password}}</b> <b>shadowing,</b> a Unix user's hashed password was {{stored in}} the second field of his/her record in the [...] file (within the seven-field format as outlined above).|$|R
5000|$|Systems administrators {{can reduce}} the {{likelihood}} of brute-force attacks by making the list of hashed passwords unreadable by unprivileged users. The obvious {{way to do this is}} to make the [...] database itself readable only by the root user. However, this would restrict access to other data in the file such as username-to-userid mappings, which would break many existing utilities and provisions. One solution is a [...] "shadow" [...] password file to hold the password hashes separate from the other data in the world-readable passwd file. For local files, this is usually [...] on Linux and Unix systems, or [...] on BSD systems; each is readable only by root. (Root access to the data is considered acceptable since on systems with the traditional [...] "all-powerful root" [...] security model, the root user would be able to obtain the information in other ways in any case). Virtually all recent Unix-like operating systems use <b>shadowed</b> <b>passwords.</b>|$|R
50|$|Regardless {{of whether}} <b>password</b> <b>shadowing</b> {{is in effect}} on a given system, the passwd file is {{readable}} by all users so that various system utilities (e.g., ls) can work (e.g., to ensure that user names are shown when the user lists {{the contents of a}} folder), while only the root user can write to it. Without <b>password</b> <b>shadowing,</b> this means that an attacker with unprivileged access to the system can obtain the hashed form of every user's password. Those values can be used to mount a brute force attack offline, testing possible passwords against the hashed passwords relatively quickly without alerting system security arrangements designed to detect an abnormal number of failed login attempts. Especially when the hash is not salted it is also possible to lookup these hashed passwords in rainbow tables, databases specially made for giving back a password for a unique hash.|$|R
50|$|The modern <b>shadow</b> <b>{{password}}</b> system, {{in which}} password hashes and other security data {{are stored in}} a non-public file, somewhat mitigates these concerns. However, they remain relevant in multi-server installations which use centralized password management systems to push passwords or password hashes to multiple systems. In such installations, the root account on each individual system may be treated as less trusted than the administrators of the centralized password system, so it remains worthwhile {{to ensure that the}} security of the password hashing algorithm, including the generation of unique salt values, is adequate.|$|E
50|$|The <b>shadow</b> <b>password</b> file {{does not}} entirely {{solve the problem}} of {{attacker}} access to hashed passwords, as some network authentication schemes operate by transmitting the hashed password over the network (sometimes in cleartext, e.g., Telnet), making it vulnerable to interception. Copies of system data, such as system backups written to tape or optical media, can also become a means for illicitly obtaining hashed passwords. In addition, the functions used by legitimate password-checking programs need to be written {{in such a way that}} malicious programs cannot make large numbers of authentication checks at high rates of speed.|$|E
5000|$|A group identifier, often {{abbreviated}} to GID, is a numeric value {{used to represent}} a specific group. The range of values for a GID varies amongst different systems; at the very least, a GID can be between 0 and 32,767, with one restriction: the login group for the superuser must have GID 0. This numeric value is {{used to refer to}} groups in the [...] and [...] files or their equivalents. <b>Shadow</b> <b>password</b> files and Network Information Service also refer to numeric GIDs. The group identifier is a necessary component of Unix file systems and processes.|$|E
5000|$|Open Directory {{began with}} Mac OS X Server 10.2. In this initial form, Open Directory {{consisted}} of a network-visible NetInfo directory domain and a corresponding Authentication Manager service for storing passwords outside of the directory. Version 10.2 also included support for Kerberos. [...] Mac OS X versions 10.1 and 10.0 stored user password information within the directory domain using crypt password authentication authorities, but version 10.2 {{paved the way for}} the current <b>Shadow</b> Hash and <b>Password</b> Server mechanisms.|$|R
50|$|Since all users {{must have}} read {{access to the}} /etc/passwd file to do many common tasks (ls -l /home will use /etc/passwd to map UIDs to login names for example), anyone could also read the {{password}} hashes of other users. To solve this problem, the file /etc/shadow was created to store the password hashes, with only root having read access. Under <b>password</b> <b>shadowing,</b> the 2nd field (password hash) is replaced by an 'x' which tells the system to retrieve the corresponding user's password via the /etc/shadow file.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most common}} use of KDFs is the {{password}} hashing approach to password verification, as {{used by the}} passwd file or <b>shadow</b> <b>password</b> file.KDFs happen to have the characteristics desired for a [...] "password hash function", {{even though they were}} not originally designed for this purpose.The non-secret parameters are called [...] "salt" [...] in this context.In 2013 a [...] "Password Hashing Competition" [...] was announced to choose a new, standard algorithm for password hashing. On 20 July 2015 the competition ended and Argon2 was announced as the final winner. Four other algorithms received special recognition: Catena, Lyra2, Makwa and yescrypt.|$|E
5000|$|Information used to {{validate}} a user's password; in most modern uses, this field is usually set to [...] "x" [...] (or [...] "*", {{or some other}} indicator) with the actual password information being stored in a separate <b>shadow</b> <b>password</b> file. On Linux systems, setting this field to an asterisk ("*") is a common way to disable direct logins to an account while still preserving its name, while another possible value is [...] "*NP*" [...] which indicates to use an NIS server to obtain the password. [...] Without password shadowing in effect, this field would typically contain a cryptographic hash of the user's password (in combination with a salt).|$|E
5000|$|The bcrypt {{function}} is the default password hash algorithm for OpenBSD and other systems including some Linux distributions such as SUSE Linux.The prefix [...] "$2a$" [...] or [...] "$2b$" [...] (or [...] "$2y$") in a hash string in a <b>shadow</b> <b>password</b> file indicates that hash string is a bcrypt hash in modular crypt format.The {{rest of the}} hash string includes the cost parameter, a 128-bit salt (base-64 encoded as 22 characters), and 184 bits of the resulting hash value (base-64 encoded as 31 characters).The cost parameter specifies a key expansion iteration count as a power of two, which is an input to the crypt algorithm.|$|E
5000|$|The best {{method of}} {{preventing}} a password from being cracked {{is to ensure}} that attackers cannot get access even to the hashed password. For example, on the Unix operating system, hashed passwords were originally stored in a publicly accessible file /etc/passwd. On modern Unix (and similar) systems, on the other hand, they are stored in the <b>shadow</b> <b>password</b> file /etc/shadow, which is accessible only to programs running with enhanced privileges (i.e., [...] "system" [...] privileges). This makes it harder for a malicious user to obtain the hashed passwords in the first instance, however many collections of password hashes have been stolen despite such protection. Another strong approach is to combine a site-specific secret key with the password hash, which prevents plaintext password recovery even if the hashed values are purloined. A third approach is to use key derivation functions that reduce the rate at which passwords can be guessed.Unfortunately, many common Network Protocols transmit passwords in cleartext or use weak challenge/response schemes.|$|E
40|$|A hash {{function}} H: { 0, 1 } ∗ → { 0, 1 } m produces an m-bit digest of an arbitrary message, file, {{or even an}} entire file system. Typically, one wants {{hash function}}s {{to be easy to}} compute, but also infeasible to invert or to find collisions (pairs of inputs which hash to the same value). Hash functions are fundamental cryptographic primitives, and they are used extensively in authentication, preserving data integrity, digital signatures, and many other security applications. Since 2007, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is running a competition to design a new hash function to be used instead of a very popular but already broken MD 5 (Message Digest) and the most used but much troubled SHA- 1 (Secure Hash Algorithm). Out of 64 designs submitted in October 2008, now, in the final round there are 5 hash function candidates remaining. The new emerging standard, to be dubbed SHA- 3, will be chosen in late 2012 from the current set of 5 finalists: BLAKE, Grøstl, JH, Keccak and Skein. This talk will contain the background of hashing, the competition, rounds completed so far, an overview of the finalists and a prediction by the speaker who will be the winner. 2 Hash- simple, powerful idea anything (email, program, document, movie, file system [...] .) x = y H(x) = H(y) 256 bits (32 bytes, like this ”napisze do ciebie z dalekiej pod ” [...] . no more) 3 Hashes in Practice Applications of (cryptographic) hashes • hash then sign • time-stamping • data authentication • checksumming • PGP email • <b>shadow</b> <b>password...</b>|$|E
