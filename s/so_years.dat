But from 1929, the buses took to the narrow streets in the city centre, as well as routes with low tram traffic such as Chartreux, Maromme and the circular. The tramways {{continued}} as going concerns, and started large programmes of renovation and modernisation in the dozen or <b>so</b> <b>years</b> before World War II.

5|$|Ares– The former God of War {{and main}} {{antagonist}} of God of War. Ares captured Kratos' brother Deimos {{and had him}} imprisoned and tortured due to a misinterpreted prophecy, and later chose Kratos as his champion during a successful wager with other Olympian Gods in the God of War comic series. Early on, Ares wanted to overthrow Zeus and entered into an alliance with the Furies to help him do <b>so.</b> <b>Years</b> later, as he deemed his own son Orkos unworthy, Ares saw an opportunity to create a warrior to help him. During a battle, Kratos called on the God of War, and pledged his life in servitude if Ares spared him from his foes and provided the power to destroy them. Ares granted Kratos' wish and empowered his new servant with the Blades of Chaos. A victorious Kratos eventually renounced his servitude to Ares when the god tricked Kratos into accidentally killing his own wife and child. In God of War, while Ares waged war on the city of Athens, Kratos was tasked by Athena to find Pandora's Box, an artifact capable of destroying Ares. Ultimately successful, Kratos ascended to Mount Olympus and replaced Ares as the new God of War. In Ascensions multiplayer mode, Ares {{is one of the}} four gods that players can pledge their allegiance to. The character was voiced by Steven Blum in God of War, Ghost of Sparta, and Ascension. Fred Tatasciore provided Ares' voice in God of War III during the psyche sequence.|$|E

25|$|Croneberger also {{established}} a Canon for Congregational Development, which is helping churches with the challenging task of {{planning for the}} future. In the past 30 or <b>so</b> <b>years</b> the diocese has struggled {{to keep up with}} the growing population in the region. 23 congregations have closed (compared with a 2% increase nationwide) due to dropping attendance. A major obstacle is the concentration of churches, many of which are over 100 years old, in traditional population centers that do not reflect the growth patterns in the state. Numerous churches are within five miles of 15 other congregations. Another diocesan commission, the Bethsaida Team, helps churches overcome obstacles for people with disabilities.|$|E

But the French Revolution meant that they never got to France, thereby making his tour the first international cricket tour to be cancelled for political reasons. Just as the American Civil War 80 or <b>so</b> <b>years</b> later destroyed the prospect of cricket becoming popular there, so the French Revolution destroyed any footholds the game had in France.|$|E

Prince of Wales then carried a cargo from Canton back to England for the British East India Company (EIC). On her return Staniforth & Co. sold her to Blackman & Co., who sailed her on the London-West Indies run. She is last listed in Lloyd's Register in 1811, still trading with Antigua.|$|E
25|$|Esarhaddon (681–669 BC) succeeded Sennacherib as {{ruler of}} the Assyrian Empire. He {{completely}} rebuilt Babylon and brought peace to the region.

For the next 60 or <b>so</b> <b>years</b> Babylon and Chaldea remained peacefully under direct Assyrian control. The Chaldeans remained subjugated and quiet during this period, and the next major revolt in Babylon against the Assyrian empire was fermented not by a Chaldean, Babylonian or Elamite, but by Shamash-shum-ukin, who was an Assyrian king of Babylon, and elder brother of Ashurbanipal (668-627 BC), the new {{ruler of the}} Neo-Assyrian Empire.|$|E

Unfortunately, while the spiritual battle ensued, Aydrian was physically rendered frozen and had his heart pierced by Brynn Dharielle and died shortly after being freed from the demon. Pony used her soul stone and dove into it again, with Elbryan's help they brought Aydrian back to life as he had brought his father back. The strain was too great for Elbryan though, and he faded back into death again moments after.|$|E
