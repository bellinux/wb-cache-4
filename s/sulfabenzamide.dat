50|$|<b>Sulfabenzamide</b> is an antibacterial/antimicrobial. Often used in {{conjunction}} with sulfathiazole and sulfacetamide (trade name - Sultrin) as a topical, intravaginal antibacterial preparation.|$|E
50|$|Sulfathiazole is an {{organosulfur}} compound {{used as a}} short-acting sulfa drug. It is {{an organic}} compound. Formerly, it was a common oral and topical antimicrobial, until less toxic alternatives were discovered. It is still occasionally used, sometimes in combination with <b>sulfabenzamide</b> and sulfacetamide in aquariums.|$|E
40|$|CZE allows {{to measure}} the acidic {{dissociation}} constant (pKa) of many drug substances. However, determining the EOF intensity may be time-consuming, especially at a low pH. In order to overcome this drawback, a dynamic coating procedure of the capillary was carried out to increase microEOF, and thus to reduce the analysis time. In addition, this coating procedure enhanced migration time stability. The effective mobilities of 15 compounds were measured at different pH, producing pK'a values dependent on BGE ionic strength. The latter values were corrected with the activity coefficient to obtain a "true" pKa value. The 15 investigated compounds were (i) five acids: namely, salicylic acid, benzoic acid, ketoprofen, phenobarbital, and phenol, (ii) four bases: lidocaine, propafenone, propranolol, and quinine, (iii), five ampholytes: sulfanilamide, <b>sulfabenzamide,</b> sulfadimethoxine, sulfadoxine, and sulfisoxazole, and (iv) one zwitterion: cetirizine. The range of determined pKa values was between 1. 2 and 11. 2, {{and close to the}} pKa values available from the literature...|$|E
40|$|Plant {{activators}} are agrochemicals {{that protect}} crops from diseases by activating the plant immune system. To isolate lead compounds {{for use as}} practical plant activators, we screened 2 different chemical libraries composed of various bioactive substances by using an established screening procedure that can selectively identify immune-priming compounds. We identified and characterized a group of sulfonamide compounds—sulfameter, sulfamethoxypyridazine, <b>sulfabenzamide,</b> and sulfachloropyridazine—among the various isolated candidate molecules. These sulfonamide compounds enhanced the avirulent Pseudomonas-induced cell death of Arabidopsis suspension cell cultures and increased disease resistance in Arabidopsis plants against both avirulent and virulent strains of the bacterium. These compounds did not prevent the growth of pathogenic bacteria in minimal liquid media at 200 &# 181;M. They also did not induce the expression of defense-related genes in Arabidopsis seedlings, at least not at 24 and 48 h after treatment, suggesting {{that they do not}} act as salicylic acid analogs. In addition, although sulfonamides are known to be folate biosynthesis inhibitors, the application of folate did not restore the potentiation effects of the sulfonamides on pathogen-induced cell death. Our data suggest that sulfonamides potentiate Arabidopsis disease resistance by their novel chemical properties...|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{establish}} {{a method for}} determination of 22 sulfonamides in pork, including <b>sulfabenzamide,</b> sulfacetamide, sulfachloropyridazine, sulfadiazine, sulfadimethoxine, sulfamethazine, sulfamera-zinesulfadoxine, sulfamonomethoxine, sulfamethoxypyridazine, sulfamethoxydiazine, sulfamethoxazole, sulfamethizole, sulfamoxole, sulfaphenazole, sulfapyridine, sulfaquinoxaline, sulfathiazole, sulfisoxazole, sulfaguanidine, trimethoprim and sulfisomidine, with matrix solid phase dispersion and high pressure liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry. Methods Pork samples were mixed and grinded with solid-phase sorbent (Florisil), then put in a glass mortar. The mixture was packed as a solid phase extraction cartridge and eluted with 15 mL 1 % acetic acid dichloromethane:ethyl acetate(1 : 3, v/v). The eluted materials were collected and evaporated to dry by nitrogen gas. The residues were dissolved in 1 mL acetonitrile: 10 mmol/L ammonium acetate (15 : 85, v/v) and 1 mL n-hexane. After centrifugation, the lower solution was gone through a 0. 22 μm filter membrane and then separated by Agilent Poroshell 120 EC-C 18 column (2. 1 mm× 150 mm, 2. 7 μm), after that it was determined by high resolution mass spectrometry. Results The linear range of 22 sulfonamides were 10 ~ 100 μg/kg, r> 0. 99. The recoveries of sulfamethizole, trimethoprim and sulfaguanidine were below 40 %, the others were above 60 %. The limits of quantitation were 5 ~ 10 μg/kg. Conclusion The advantages of this method are fast, efficient, less organic reagent and low cost. It is suitable for the determination of sulfonamides residues in pork...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{describes}} an automated methodology {{based on a}} liquid chromatography-electrospray, tandem mass spectrometry method combined with online solid phase extraction (online SPE-LC-ESI-MS/MS) for the simultaneous analysis of 16 sulfonamides (SAs) and five of their acetylated metabolites in groundwater. The evaluation {{of the degree of}} SA pollution in groundwater was made through the analysis of a total of 39 samples taken in seven groundwater bodies of Catalonia (Spain). Recovery values obtained ranged from 34. 3 % (N 4 -acetylsulfadiazine) to 134. 4 % (<b>sulfabenzamide).</b> The method limits of detection for all the analytes were 0. 09 - 11 ng L- 1. Sulfamethoxazole was the SA detected more frequently (56. 4 % of the samples), with an average concentration of 2. 3 ng L- 1, followed by sulfadimethoxine, present in 54 % of the samples with an average concentration of 0. 2 ng L- 1. It should be highlighted that the acetylated metabolites were ubiquitous in the different samples, with frequencies of detection up to 36 % and maximum concentrations of 18 ng L- 1 (N 4 - acetylsulfamerazine). © 2010 Springer-Verlag.
