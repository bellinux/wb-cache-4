25|$|The {{first known}} {{mention of a}} <b>Stirling</b> <b>cycle</b> machine using freely moving {{components}} is a British patent disclosure in 1876. This machine was envisaged as a refrigerator (i.e., the reversed <b>Stirling</b> <b>cycle).</b> The first consumer product to utilize a free piston Stirling device was a portable refrigerator manufactured by Twinbird Corporation of Japan and offered in the US by Coleman in 2004.|$|E
25|$|All {{thermodynamic}} cycles require large temperature differentials for efficient operation. In {{an external}} combustion engine, the heater temperature always equals or exceeds the expansion temperature. This {{means that the}} metallurgical requirements for the heater material are very demanding. This {{is similar to a}} Gas turbine, but is in contrast to an Otto engine or Diesel engine, where the expansion temperature can far exceed the metallurgical limit of the engine materials, because the input heat source is not conducted through the engine, so engine materials operate closer to the average temperature of the working gas. The <b>Stirling</b> <b>cycle</b> is not actually achievable, the real cycle in Stirling machines is less efficient than the theoretical <b>Stirling</b> <b>cycle,</b> also the efficiency of the <b>Stirling</b> <b>cycle</b> is lower where the ambient temperatures are mild, while it would give its best results in a cool environment, such as northern countries' winters.|$|E
25|$|When the {{displacer}} is in motion, {{the generator}} holds the working piston in the limit position, which brings the engine working cycle {{close to an}} ideal <b>Stirling</b> <b>cycle.</b>|$|E

40|$|A general {{criterion}} {{to distinguish}} whether a <b>Stirling</b> refrigeration <b>cycle</b> possesses {{the condition of}} perfect regeneration is given. It is proven using the criterion that a <b>Stirling</b> refrigeration <b>cycle</b> using a simple paramagnetic or ferromagnetic material as the working substance possesses the condition of perfect regeneration, as does a <b>Stirling</b> refrigeration <b>cycle</b> using an ideal or van der Waals gas as the working substance. However, a <b>Stirling</b> refrigeration <b>cycle</b> using a gas which is described by the Redlich-Kwong, Beattie-Bridgeman, Benedict-Webb-Rubin, Dieterici, Berthelot, or Martin-Hou equation as the working substance does not possess the condition of perfect regeneration and its coefficient of performance is always smaller {{than that of the}} Carnot refrigeration cycle for the same temperature range. Moreover, the effect of non-perfect regeneration on the level of refrigeration and the coefficient of performance of a <b>Stirling</b> refrigeration <b>cycle</b> is expounded using a strict equation of state...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of quantum degeneracy {{on the performance}} of a <b>Stirling</b> refrigeration <b>cycle</b> is investigated, based on the equation of state of an ideal Fermi gas. The inherent regenerative losses and the coefficient of performance (COP) of the cycle are calculated. It is found that, under the condition of strong gas degeneracy, the COP of the cycle in the first approximation is a function only of the temperatures of the heat reservoirs, while under other conditions, the COPs of the cycle depend on the temperatures of the heat reservoirs and other parameters of the cycle. The results obtained here reveal the general performance characteristics of a <b>Stirling</b> refrigeration <b>cycle</b> having a Fermi gas as its working substance. <b>Stirling</b> refrigeration <b>cycle</b> Fermi gas Quantum degeneracy Regenerative loss Coefficient of performance...|$|R
25|$|The rotary Stirling engine {{seeks to}} convert {{power from the}} <b>Stirling</b> <b>cycle</b> {{directly}} into torque, similar to the rotary combustion engine. No practical engine has yet been built {{but a number of}} concepts, models and patents have been produced, such as the Quasiturbine engine.|$|E
25|$|Another {{alternative}} is the Fluidyne engine (Fluidyne heat pump), which uses hydraulic pistons {{to implement the}} <b>Stirling</b> <b>cycle.</b> The work produced by a Fluidyne engine goes into pumping the liquid. In its simplest form, the engine contains a working gas, a liquid, and two non-return valves.|$|E
25|$|The ideal <b>Stirling</b> <b>cycle</b> is {{unattainable}} in {{the real}} world (as with any heat engine); efficiencies of 50% have been reached, similar to the maximum figure for Diesel cycle engines. The efficiency of Stirling machines is also linked to the environmental temperature; higher efficiency is obtained when the weather is cooler, thus making this type of engine less interesting in places with warmer climates. As with other external combustion engines, Stirling engines can use heat sources other than from combustion of fuels.|$|E
40|$|Three power {{producing}} cycles {{have been}} so far known that include two isothermal processes, namely, Carnot, Stirling, and Ericsson. It {{is well known that}} the efficiency of the Carnot cycle represented by 1 −/ is independent of its working fluid. Using fundamental relationships between thermodynamic properties including Maxwell's relationships, this paper shows in a closed form that the Ericsson and the <b>Stirling</b> <b>cycles</b> also possess the Carnot efficiency irrespective {{of the nature of the}} working gas...|$|R
40|$|Real gas effects {{typical of}} the {{critical}} region of working fluids are a powerful tool to increase the energy performances of <b>Stirling</b> <b>cycles,</b> mainly at low top temperatures. To carry out the compression near the critical region the working fluids must have a critical temperature near environmental conditions {{and the use of}} organic working substances (pure or in suitable mixtures) {{as a matter of fact}} begins compulsory. The moderate thermal stability of the organic working fluids limits the maximum temperatures to 300 – 400 °C and as a consequence, the achievable cycles efficiencies result rather low. Carbon dioxide, with a critical temperature of 31 °C, is, among the traditionally inorganic gases, an exception and is considered here in comparison with organic substances. But the good thermodynamics of the cycles allows, in the considered cases, conversion efficiencies of about 20 %, with good specific powers. The good energy performance of real gas <b>Stirling</b> <b>cycles</b> is obtained at the cost of high maximum cycle pressure, in the range of at least 100 – 300 bar. These high pressures nevertheless have large positive effects on the heat power transferred per unit of pumping mechanical power, and the low top temperatures have a positive influence on the material problems for the hottest engine parts...|$|R
50|$|The Manson-Guise engine {{efficiency}} {{has yet to}} be tested but is expected to be less than the <b>Stirling</b> engine <b>cycle</b> efficiency due to drawing in cold air and expelling hot air.|$|R
25|$|Thermoacoustic {{devices are}} very {{different}} from Stirling devices, although the individual path travelled by each working gas molecule does follow a real <b>Stirling</b> <b>cycle.</b> These devices include the thermoacoustic engine and thermoacoustic refrigerator. High-amplitude acoustic standing waves cause compression and expansion analogous to a Stirling power piston, while out-of-phase acoustic travelling waves cause displacement along a temperature gradient, analogous to a Stirling displacer piston. Thus a thermoacoustic device typically does not have a displacer, as found in a beta or gamma Stirling.|$|E
25|$|The ideal Otto and Diesel cycles are {{not totally}} {{reversible}} because they involve heat transfer through a finite temperature difference during the irreversible isothermal heat-addition and heat-rejection processes. The irreversibility renders the thermal efficiency of these cycles {{less than that}} of a Carnot engine operating within the same limits of temperature. Another cycle that features isothermal heat-addition and heat-rejection processes is the <b>Stirling</b> <b>cycle,</b> which is an altered version of the Carnot cycle in which the two isentropic processes featured in the Carnot cycle are replaced by two constant-volume regeneration processes.|$|E
25|$|Other {{methods of}} {{refrigeration}} include the {{air cycle machine}} used in aircraft; the vortex tube used for spot cooling, when compressed air is available; and thermoacoustic refrigeration using sound waves in a pressurized gas to drive heat transfer and heat exchange; steam jet cooling popular in the early 1930s for air conditioning large buildings; thermoelastic cooling using a smart metal alloy stretching and relaxing. Many <b>Stirling</b> <b>cycle</b> heat engines can be run backwards {{to act as a}} refrigerator, and therefore these engines have a niche use in cryogenics. In addition there are other types of cryocoolers such as Gifford-McMahon coolers, Joule-Thomson coolers, pulse-tube refrigerators and, for temperatures between 2 mK and 500 mK, dilution refrigerators.|$|E
40|$|The <b>Stirling</b> {{refrigeration}} <b>cycle</b> {{using an}} ideal Bose-gas as the working substance {{is called the}} Bose-Stirling refrigeration cycle, which is different from other thermodynamic cycles such as the Carnot cycle, Ericsson cycle, Brayton cycle, Otto cycle, Diesel cycle and Atkinson cycle working with an ideal Bose gas and may be operated across the critical temperature of Bose-Einstein condensation of the Bose system. The performance of the cycle is investigated, based on the equation of state of an ideal Bose gas. The inherent regenerative losses of the cycle are considered and the coefficient of performance {{and the amount of}} refrigeration of the cycle are calculated. The results obtained here are compared with those derived from the classical <b>Stirling</b> refrigeration <b>cycle,</b> using an ideal gas as the working substance. The influence of quantum degeneracy and inherent regenerative losses on the performance of the Bose <b>Stirling</b> refrigeration <b>cycle</b> operated in different temperature regions is discussed in detail, and consequently, general performance characteristics of the cycle are revealed.

This paper presents an analysis of a tri-generation cycle that is based upon coupled <b>Stirling</b> <b>cycles.</b> It is shown {{that it is possible to}} obtain a significantly higher Energy Utilisation Factor with this type of cycle by considering the energy transferred during the isothermal compression and expansion processes as useful products thus making the energy utilisation larger than the enthalpy drop of the working fluid.

40|$|In {{the field}} of energy production, {{cogeneration}} systems based on <b>Stirling</b> <b>cycles</b> appear particularly suitable to reach the goals of improving efficiency and reducing pollutants, as they ensure high efficiency, fuel flexibility, low emissions, low noise/vibration levels and good performance at partial load.

40|$|The use {{of solar}} thermal power systems coupled with thermal energy storage (TES) is being studied for both {{terrestrial}} and space applications. In the case of terrestrial applications, {{it was found that}} one or two hours of TES could shift the insolation peak (solar noon) to coincide with user peak loads. The use of a phase change material (PCM) is attractive because of the higher energy storage density which can be achieved. However, the use of PCM has also certain disadvantages which must be addressed. Proof of concept testing was undertaken to evaluate corrosive effects and thermal ratcheting effects in a slurry system. It is concluded that the considered alkali metal/alkali salt slurry approach to TES appears to be very viable, taking into account an elimination of thermal ratcheting in storage systems and the reduction of corrosive effects.

40|$|This study {{takes into}} account engines working in <b>Stirling</b> <b>cycles</b> in {{cogeneration}} systems. Stirling engines have been selected because of their characteristics of exploitation. The possibility of their use in cogeneration systems is more favourable in comparison with other combustion engines because they can avoid usage of industrial and transport fuels. The Stirling engines enable the use of biomass, agricultural and other waste energy sources in micro tri- and cogeneration plants dedicated for the use in agriculture and forestry. Considering such applications, three types of usage structures of Stirling engines are proposed. All three structures are dedicated to install in small residential or farm buildings. These three types of structure are named: “type master”, “type slave ” and “type customer”. In accordance with the proposed structures, different types of engine constructions are discussed, too. At the same time, the authors described the dependences between Stirling engines and electric power energy systems. The arguments of grid power systems and dispersed energy resource in text were reviewed. After that overview, some legal problems are discussed.
