40|$|International audienceThe {{microstructure}} {{and dynamics}} of a colloidal system interacting via <b>short-ranged</b> interparticle potential is studied by ultra-small-angle x-ray scattering and x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy. A colloidal gas-liq. type transition is induced when the <b>short-ranged</b> attractive interactions attain sufficient magnitude. The development of liq. -like structure is {{preceded by a}} systematic transition in the particle dynamics from diffusive to constrained motion and then completely frozen behavior. This demonstrates {{the existence of a}} jamming transition induced by strong <b>short-ranged</b> attractive interactions even at low packing fractions...|$|R

40|$|Long-ranged {{microstructural}} {{order of}} a near-critical colloid-polymer mixture under stationary and oscillatory shear flow is studied by means of time-resolved small-angle light scattering. The distance from the critical point, the shear rate, {{and the frequency of}} oscillation are systematically varied. Unexpected shear-induced distortions of critical microstructural order is observed in directions perpendicular to the flow direction, more so on closer approach of the gas-liquid critical point. The measured distortion of long-ranged order can be quantitatively understood on the basis of an approximate solution of the Smoluchowski equation, provided that a nonanalytical distortion of <b>short-ranged</b> microstructural order is assumed. These <b>short-ranged</b> microstructural changes, induced by the flow, account for the observed distortion perpendicular to the flow direction, and are responsible for the shear-induced shift of the location of the gas-liquid critical point. The importance of <b>short-ranged</b> correlations renders the behavior of critical systems under shear flow nonuniversal. The origin of the nonanalytic dependence of <b>short-ranged</b> distortions on the shear rate remains unclear. Including these <b>short-ranged</b> microstructural distortions, we find a good agreement between theory and experiment for both stationary and oscillatory shear flow...|$|R

We present a nonperturbative calculation of the tunneling density of states (TDOS) for both Coulomb and <b>short-ranged</b> electron-electron interactions. In the case of Coulomb interaction, the TDOS exhibits a 2 D quantum Coulomb gap behavior, ν() =C_Q/e^ 4, with C_Q a nonuniversal coefficient of quantum mechanical origin.
