The eaves have corbel brackets with carvings including human faces and animals. These include a lion, ape and devil, {{as well as}} a salamander, <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> protection against fire. Gilded carvings of Richard and Margerye Churche are located above the main entrance, on either side. The timbers bear carpenters' marks with both Roman and Arabic numerals, some being unusually long. The highly decorated style is typical of the timber-framed buildings of the Elizabethan period.|$|E

Before the ferry could start service, the NYCDOT {{was required to}} approve a new transportation mode within its service area. Additionally, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and United States Army Corps of Engineers (CoE) was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> NYC Ferry permission to use of the landings, with the United States Coast Guard advising the CoE's approval of a permit as well as monitoring the design of vessels. In addition, the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation had to allow ferries to use the landing at Gantry Plaza State Park, and the Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation was consulted so they could give permission for the Roosevelt Island landing to be built. By September 2016, the Gantry Plaza landing had been approved.|$|E

5|$|Periyar {{fought against}} the {{orthodox}} traditions of marriage as suppression of women in Tamil Nadu and throughout the Indian sub-continent. Though arranged marriages were meant to enable a couple to live together throughout life, it was manipulated to enslave women. Much worse was the practice of child marriages practised throughout India at the time. It was believed {{that it would be}} a sin to marry after puberty. Another practice, which is prevalent today, is the dowry system where the bride's family is <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> the husband a huge payment for the bride. The purpose of this was to assist the newly wedded couple financially, but in many instances dowries were misused by bridegrooms. The outcome of this abuse turned to the exploitation of the bride's parents wealth, and in certain circumstances, lead to dowry deaths. There have been hundreds of thousands of cases where wives have been murdered, mutilated, and burned alive because the father of the bride was unable to make the dowry payment to the husband. Periyar fiercely stood up against this abuse meted out against women.|$|E

25|$|Circumcision {{in ancient}} Egypt {{was thought to}} be a mark of passage from {{childhood}} to adulthood. The alteration of the body and ritual of circumcision was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> access to ancient mysteries reserved solely for the initiated. The content of those mysteries are unclear but are likely to be myths, prayers, and incantations central to Egyptian religion. The Egyptian Book of the Dead, for example, tells of the sun god Ra performing a self-circumcision, whose blood created two minor guardian deities. Circumcisions were performed by priests in a public ceremony, using a stone blade. It is thought to have been more popular among the upper echelons of the society, although it was not universal and those lower down the social order are known to have had the procedure done.|$|E
25|$|Cohn-Bendit's {{disregard}} for conventional European politics of {{left and right}} has made him more unpopular in France than in Germany. The French Green Party and the French left in general remain more attached to these distinctions, whereas in the German Green Party, the moderate Realo wing had already won over the hard-line Fundi wing, possible alliances with the Conservatives were no longer taboo, and third way policies under the center-left Gerhard Schröder government, such as Agenda 2010 and the Hartz I – IV laws, found considerable support. He was also accused of not giving to the French party the percentage of income that all MEPs and other elected members are <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> to their party, although the party had officially agreed to exempt him before his first election in France. This, alongside his pro-European attitude, led him {{to participate in the}} 2004 European elections on the German side, where he became the highest male candidate on the list and was elected again.|$|E

The National Congress Women studies reports sent to them from the Executive Committee of the ACWF, decide the goals for the women’s movements, make changes to the constitution, and elect the Executive Committee and Standing Committees of the ACWF.

500|$|Back then in 1944, only Filipino {{soldiers}} were denied from being given benefits by the GI Bill of Rights, which was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> welfare {{to all those}} who have served in the United States Military irrespective of race, color or nationality. Over 66 countries were inducted into the bill but only the Philippines was left out, describing the Filipino soldiers as mere [...] "Second Class Veterans". Then in 1946, the Rescission Act was enacted to mandate some aid to Filipino veterans, but only to those who had disabilities or serious injuries. The only benefit the United States could only give at that time was the Immigrant Act, which made it easier for Filipinos who served in World War II to get American citizenship. It was not until in 1996 when the veterans started seeking for recognition from the United States. Representative Colleen Hanabusa submitted legislation to award Filipino Veterans with a Congressional Gold Medal, which became known as the Filipino Veterans of World War II Congressional Gold Medal Act. The Act was referred to the Committee on Financial Services and the Committee on House Administration. The Philippine government has also enacted laws concerning the benefits of Filipino guerrillas.|$|E

Uhura was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> a dramatic speech in Klingon during the film, but midway through production the element was scrapped and a scene where Uhura is speaking garbled Klingon, surrounded by books, was added for extra humour. Nichols protested the scene, wondering why there were still books in the 23rd century, but accepted the change since {{it would be the}} last Star Trek film she would appear in. Nichols was more uncomfortable with some of the dialogue's racial undertones. Her character was originally to speak the line, [...] "Guess who's coming to dinner," [...] as the Klingons arrive on the Enterprise, but refused to say the part and it was given to Koenig's character instead. Nichols also refused to say the line [...] "yes, but would you like your daughter to marry one [...] ", and it was dropped from the film altogether. George Takei also returned as former helmsman Hikaru Sulu, though his character is now commander of the USS Excelsior, which includes former Enterprise yeoman Janice Rand (again played by Grace Lee Whitney) as a communications officer.|$|E
