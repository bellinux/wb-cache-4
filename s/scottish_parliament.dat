5|$|A {{referendum}} of the Scottish electorate, held on 11 September 1997, {{approved the}} establishment of a directly elected <b>Scottish</b> <b>Parliament</b> to legislate on most domestic affairs. Following this, the Scottish Office, led by the then Secretary of State for Scotland, Donald Dewar, decided that a new purpose-built facility would be constructed in Edinburgh, to house the <b>Scottish</b> <b>Parliament.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} {{elections}} in the UK, Irish and qualifying Commonwealth citizens are entitled to vote. Unlike elections to the Westminster parliament, citizens of other non-Commonwealth EU member states who are resident in Scotland are entitled to vote in elections to the <b>Scottish</b> <b>Parliament.</b> Overseas electors on Scottish electoral registers {{are not allowed to}} vote in <b>Scottish</b> <b>Parliament</b> elections. From the 2016 election, the franchise for <b>Scottish</b> <b>Parliament</b> elections was expanded to include 16 and 17-year olds.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>Scottish</b> <b>Parliament</b> the Orkney {{constituency}} elects one Member of the <b>Scottish</b> <b>Parliament</b> (MSP) by {{the first}} past the post system. The current MSP is Liam McArthur of the Liberal Democrats. Before McArthur the MSP was Jim Wallace, who was previously Deputy First Minister. Orkney is within the Highlands and Islands electoral region.|$|E

5|$|Kirkcaldy forms {{part of the}} Kirkcaldy {{constituency}} of the <b>Scottish</b> <b>Parliament</b> (or Holyrood), {{and is one of}} nine {{within the}} Mid Scotland and Fife electoral region. Each constituency elects one Member of the <b>Scottish</b> <b>Parliament</b> by the first–past–the–post system of election, and the region elects seven additional members to produce a form of proportional representation. The Kirkcaldy seat was won at the 2011 <b>Scottish</b> <b>Parliament</b> elections by David Torrance for the Scottish National Party (SNP). Following a review of <b>Scottish</b> <b>Parliament</b> constituency boundaries, the Kirkcaldy constituency was extended along the coast, taking in the Buckhaven, Methil, and East and West Wemyss villages ward, ahead of the 2011 elections. Kirkcaldy is part of the pan-Scotland European Parliament constituency, which elects seven Members of the European Parliament (MEPs).|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the work}} of the <b>Scottish</b> <b>Parliament</b> is done in committee. The role of {{committees}} is stronger in the <b>Scottish</b> <b>Parliament</b> than in other parliamentary systems, partly as a means of strengthening the role of backbenchers in their scrutiny of the government and partly to compensate for {{the fact that there is}} no revising chamber. The principal role of committees in the <b>Scottish</b> <b>Parliament</b> is to take evidence from witnesses, conduct inquiries and scrutinise legislation. Committee meetings take place on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morning when Parliament is sitting. Committees can also meet at other locations throughout Scotland.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Scottish</b> <b>Parliament</b> Building at Holyrood itself did {{not open}} until October 2004, after lengthy {{construction}} delays and running over budget. The <b>Scottish</b> <b>Parliament</b> has {{a form of}} proportional representation (the additional member system), which normally results in no one party having an overall majority. The pro-independence Scottish National Party led by Alex Salmond achieved this in the 2011 election, winning 69 of the 129 seats available. The success of the SNP in achieving {{a majority in the}} <b>Scottish</b> <b>Parliament</b> {{paved the way for the}} September 2014 referendum on Scottish independence. The majority voted against the proposition, with 55% voting no to independence. More powers, particularly in relation to taxation, were devolved to the <b>Scottish</b> <b>Parliament</b> after the referendum, following cross-party talks in the Smith Commission.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, a <b>Scottish</b> <b>Parliament</b> was re-established, in {{the form}} of a devolved unicameral {{legislature}} comprising 129 members, having authority over many areas of domestic policy. Scotland is represented in the United Kingdom Parliament by 59 MPs and in the European Parliament by 6 MEPs. Scotland is also a member of the British–Irish Council, and sends five members of the <b>Scottish</b> <b>Parliament</b> to the British–Irish Parliamentary Assembly.|$|E
5|$|Since September 2004, the {{official}} {{home of the}} <b>Scottish</b> <b>Parliament</b> has been a new <b>Scottish</b> <b>Parliament</b> Building, in the Holyrood area of Edinburgh. The <b>Scottish</b> <b>Parliament</b> building was designed by Spanish architect Enric Miralles in partnership with local Edinburgh Architecture firm RMJM which was led by Design Principal Tony Kettle. Some of the principal features of the complex include leaf-shaped buildings, a grass-roofed branch merging into adjacent parkland and gabion walls formed from the stones of previous buildings. Throughout the building there are many repeated motifs, such as shapes based on Raeburn's Skating Minister. Crow-stepped gables and the upturned boat skylights of the Garden Lobby, complete the unique architecture. Queen Elizabeth II opened the new building on 9 October 2004.|$|E
5|$|The next <b>Scottish</b> <b>Parliament</b> {{election}} {{is due to}} be held on Thursday 6 May 2021. Under the Scotland Act 1998, an ordinary general election to the <b>Scottish</b> <b>Parliament</b> would normally have been held on the first Thursday in May {{four years after the}} 2016 election, i.e. in May 2020. This would have clashed with the proposed date of the 2020 United Kingdom general election, but later became a moot point after the latter was brought forward to 2017. In November 2015, the Scottish Government published a Scottish Elections (Dates) Bill, which proposed to extend the term of the Parliament to five years. That Bill was passed by the <b>Scottish</b> <b>Parliament</b> on 25 February 2016 and received Royal Assent on 30 March 2016, setting the new date for the election as 6 May 2021, with subsequent elections every four years after that.|$|E

5|$|A further type of {{committee}} is normally {{set up to}} scrutinise private bills submitted to the <b>Scottish</b> <b>Parliament</b> by an outside party or promoter {{who is not a}} member of the <b>Scottish</b> <b>Parliament</b> or Scottish Government. Private bills normally relate to large-scale development projects such as infrastructure projects that require the use of land or property. Private Bill Committees have been set up to consider legislation on issues such as the development of the Edinburgh Tram Network, the Glasgow Airport Rail Link, the Airdrie-Bathgate Rail Link and extensions to the National Gallery of Scotland.|$|E
5|$|As the <b>Scottish</b> <b>Parliament</b> {{is able to}} make laws on {{the areas}} constitutionally devolved to it, the {{legislative}} process begins with bills (draft laws) which are presented to Parliament.|$|E

5|$|Bills can be {{introduced}} to Parliament {{in a number of}} ways; the Scottish Government can introduce new laws or amendments to existing laws as a bill; a committee of the Parliament can present a bill in one of the areas under its remit; a member of the <b>Scottish</b> <b>Parliament</b> can introduce a bill as a private member; or a private bill can be submitted to Parliament by an outside proposer. Most draft laws are government bills introduced by ministers in the governing party (or parties). Bills pass through Parliament in a number of stages before receiving royal assent, whereupon they become Acts of the <b>Scottish</b> <b>Parliament.</b>|$|E
5|$|In August 2009 the SNP {{proposed}} {{a bill to}} hold a referendum on independence in November 2010. Opposition from all other major parties led to an expected defeat. After the 2011 elections gave the SNP an overall majority in the <b>Scottish</b> <b>Parliament,</b> a referendum on independence for Scotland was held on 18 September 2014. The referendum resulted in a rejection of independence, by 55.3% to 44.7%. During the campaign, the three main parties in the UK Parliament pledged to extend {{the powers of the}} <b>Scottish</b> <b>Parliament.</b> An all-party commission chaired by Lord Smith of Kelvin was formed, which led to a further devolution of powers through the Scotland Act 2016.|$|E
5|$|Scotland {{has limited}} {{self-government}} within the United Kingdom, {{as well as}} representation in the UK Parliament. Executive and legislative powers respectively have been devolved to the Scottish Government and the <b>Scottish</b> <b>Parliament</b> at Holyrood in Edinburgh since 1999. The UK Parliament retains control over reserved matters specified in the Scotland Act 1998, including UK taxes, social security, defence, international relations and broadcasting. The <b>Scottish</b> <b>Parliament</b> has legislative authority for all other areas relating to Scotland. It initially had only a limited power to vary income tax, but powers over taxation and social security were significantly expanded by the Scotland Acts of 2012 and 2016.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Scottish</b> <b>Parliament</b> {{can give}} {{legislative}} consent over devolved matters {{back to the}} UK Parliament by passing a Legislative Consent Motion if United Kingdom-wide legislation is considered more appropriate for a certain issue.

For instance, university education and care services for the elderly are free at point of use in Scotland, while fees are paid in the rest of the UK. Scotland was the first country in the UK to ban smoking in enclosed public places.|$|E

50|$|In 1707 the <b>Scottish</b> and English <b>Parliaments</b> {{signed a}} Treaty of Union. Implementing the treaty {{involved}} dissolving both the English and the <b>Scottish</b> <b>Parliaments,</b> and transferring all their powers {{to a new}} Parliament in London which then became the British Parliament. A customs and currency union also took place. With this, Scotland's position was consolidated within the United Kingdom.|$|R
50|$|The English and <b>Scottish</b> <b>parliaments</b> {{had evolved}} along {{different}} lines; especially, the Parliament of Scotland had been unicameral while that of England had been bicameral. Following Union, the parliament at Westminster followed the English model.|$|R
