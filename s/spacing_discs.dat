Anatomically, the extrusion is the displacement of disc material with a full-thickness disruption of the annulus fibrosus fibres; usually the posterior longitudinal ligament however remains intact (Fig.  13). The posterior aspect of the extrusion may be larger than its base in the sagittal plane causing the posterior longitudinal ligament to tent, which often causes neurological symptoms and pain.|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} was to quantify the {{relationship of}} the esophagus to the CVB, <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> and LC. 30 patients were selected for a retrospective review of computed tomography (CT) scans. Measurements between the esophagus and the C 5, C 6, and C 7 vertebral bodies as well as the C 5 / 6 and C 6 / 7 <b>disc</b> <b>spaces</b> were performed in the midline, 3  mm right and left of midline, and at the edge of the LC on both sides. The closest distance of the esophagus to the CVB and <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> occurs at the midline (range 1. 02 – 1. 31  mm at each level). The furthest distance occurred at the edge of the right LC (range 2. 67 – 3. 30  mm at each level). The mean distance from the edge of the right LC to the midline was significantly greater (P <  0. 01) than mean distance from the edge of the left LC to the midline. No statistical significant differences were observed when comparing measurements at the individual vertebral bodies and <b>disc</b> <b>spaces.</b> The results of the study demonstrate that the esophagus lies in closest proximity to the CVB and <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> in the midline. A larger potential space exists between the esophagus and the CVB and <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> at the edge of the LC. These results may provide insight into a potential cause of post-operative dysphagia.

OBJECTIVE: To examine {{the influence of}} spinal fusion on adjacent segment <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> height {{as an indicator of}} disc degeneration at LTFU. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: There is ongoing debate as to whether adjacent segment disc degeneration results from the increased mechanical stress of fusion. METHODS: Plain standing lateral radiographs were obtained at LTFU (mean, 13 ± 4 yr postrandomization) in 229 of 464 (49 %) patients randomized to surgery and 140 of 303 (46 %), to nonoperative care. <b>Disc</b> <b>space</b> height and posteroanterior displacement were measured for each lumbar segment using a validated computer-assisted distortion compensated roentgen analysis technique. Values were reported in units of standard deviations above or below age and sex-adjusted normal values. Patient-rated outcomes included the Oswestry Disability Index and pain scales. RESULTS: Radiographs were usable in 355 of 369 (96 %) patients (259 fusion and 96 nonoperative treatment). Both treatment groups showed significantly lower values for <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> height of the adjacent segment than norm values. There was a significant difference between treatment groups for the <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> height of the cranial adjacent segment (in both as-treated and intention-to-treat analyses). The mean treatment effect of fusion on adjacent segment <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> height was - 0. 44 SDs (95 % CI, - 0. 77 to - 0. 11; P = 0. 01; as-treated analysis); there was no group difference for posteroanterior displacement (0. 18 SDs, 95 % confidence interval, - 0. 28 to 0. 64, P = 0. 45). Adjacent level <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> height and posteroanterior displacement were not correlated with Oswestry Disability Index or pain scores at LTFU (r = 0. 010 - 0. 05; P > 0. 33). CONCLUSION: Fusion was associated with lower <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> height at the adjacent segment after an average of 13 years of FU. The reduced <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> height had no influence on patient self-rated outcomes (pain or disability). LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2...|$|R

40|$|Spondylosis deformans and diffuse {{idiopathic}} skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) {{are usually}} incidental ﬁndings {{and in most}} dogs are either asymptomatic or associated with mild clinical signs. Severe spondylosis defor- mans and DISH can result in complete bony fusion of consecutive vertebral segments. One of the recognised complications following vertebral fusion in human patients is the development of adjacent segment disease, which is deﬁned as degenerative changes, most commonly degenerative intervertebral disc disease, in the mobile vertebral segment neighboring a region of complete vertebral fusion. A similar syndrome following cervical fusion in dogs has been termed the domino effect. The purpose of this retrospective study was to investigate the hypothesis that vertebral fusion occurring secondary to spondylosis deformans or DISH in dogs would protect fused intervertebral <b>disc</b> <b>spaces</b> from undergoing degeneration, but result in adjacent segment disease at neighbouring unfused intervertebral <b>disc</b> <b>spaces.</b> Eight dogs with clinical signs of thora- columbar myelopathy, magnetic resonance imaging of the thoracolumbar vertebral column, and spondylosis deformans or DISH producing fusion of ≥ 2 consecutive intervertebral <b>disc</b> <b>spaces</b> were evaluated.

30|$|Annular bulging (folding). Degeneration of the nucleous pulposus {{eventually}} {{leads to}} a marked drop in intradiscal pressure resulting in <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> narrowing or collapse with the vertebral bodies moving closer to one another.

40|$|ABSTRACT Surgical {{treatment}} of intervertebral disc degeneration aims {{to restore the}} height of the <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> and the release of involved neurological structures. Like any surgical treatment in orthopedics, {{the success or failure of}} the lumbar procedure involves the possibility of performing an adequate planning of each particular event. In the case of lumbar stabilization surgery with interbody fusion, it is essential to know the ideal height of the <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> for the fusion to be successful. Objective: To demonstrate that the ideal height of the <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> corresponds approximately to one third of {{the height of the}} vertebral body. Methods: X-ray images were taken in AP and lateral views of hospital residents to measure L 4 -L 5 vertebral bodies as well as the <b>disc</b> <b>space.</b> The rule of three was used to check the height of the disc and vertebral bodies. Results: It was verified that the <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> corresponds to 31 % of the size of the vertebral body, taking 0. 31 as the constant. Conclusions: The size of the disc corresponds to one third of the vertebral body, taking 0. 31 as the constant. The multiplication of the constant by the height of the vertebral body results in the exact height of the disc. Thus, in the presence of degeneration of the intervertebral disc, it is possible to know the size of the disc and, therefore, the size of the interbody cage...|$|R
40|$|The {{insufficient}} investigations on {{the changes}} of spinal structures during traction prevent further exploring the possible therapeutic mechanism of cervical traction. A blind randomized crossover-design {{study was conducted}} to quantitatively compare the intervertebral <b>disc</b> <b>spaces</b> between axial and anterior lean cervical traction in sitting position. A total of 96 radiographic images from the baseline measurements, axial and anterior lean tractions in 32 asymptomatic subjects were digitized for further analysis. The intra- and inter-examiner reliabilities for measuring the intervertebral <b>disc</b> <b>spaces</b> were in good ranges (ICCs = 0. 928 - 0. 942). With the application of anterior lean traction, the statistical increases were detected both in anterior and in posterior <b>disc</b> <b>spaces</b> compared to the baseline (0. 29 mm and 0. 24 mm; both P < 0. 01) and axial traction (0. 16 mm and 0. 35 mm; both P < 0. 01). The greater intervertebral <b>disc</b> <b>spaces</b> obtained during anterior lean traction might be associated with the more even distribution of traction forces over the anterior and posterior neck structures. The neck extension moment through mandible that generally occurred in the axial traction could be counteracted by the downward force of head weight during anterior lean traction. This study quantitatively demonstrated that anterior lean traction in sitting position provided more intervertebral <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> enlargements in both anterior and posterior aspects than axial traction did. These findings may serve as a therapeutic reference when cervical traction is suggested...|$|R

30|$|Historically, {{debridement}} {{and drainage}} of disc abscess has been performed through open surgery and anterior {{exposure of the}} spine. More recently, minimally invasive techniques for surgical management of resistant spondylodiscitis have been described [9 – 15]. Percutaneous transpedicular discectomy and drainage (PTDD) makes use of the pedicle as the entry point to the <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> [10, 12, 13]. Although this allows safe access to the <b>disc</b> <b>space,</b> the main drawbacks of this technique are limited access to the <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> due to the orientation and limited size of the pedicle {{as well as the}} risk of spreading the infection to the posterior elements. Percutaneous endoscopic discectomy (PED) was first developed for the treatment of herniated discs in the 1980 s. More recently, this technique has been adapted for use in treating spinal infections [9, 11, 14]. PED allows better access than PTDD and direct visualisation of the disc space; however, it requires skills and equipment only available in centres which routinely carry out PED [15].|$|R

To assess the severity and {{reasons for the}} reduction of <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> distraction after successful autograft fusion of the lumbar spine and its clinical consequences. Summary of Background Data. Anterior lumbar interbody fusion is an established treatment for lumbar disc degeneration. It Is not firmly established whether the grafted level narrows after surgery, and if so, what the clinical consequences are. Methods. This study assessed 67 patients who underwent anterior lumbar interbody fusion at L 4 -L 5 with autologous iliac crest graft. The <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> height and angle between L 4 and L 5 were serially measured. Times until fusion {{and the presence of}} symptoms before and after surgery and at the latest follow-up assessment were noted. Results. The mean follow-up period was 14 years (range, 2. 5 - 32 years). The fusion rate was 96 % (64 of 67 patients), and the mean time to fusion was 9 months. In the group that had successful fusion, there was an initial increase in <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> distraction followed by a reduction in 55 patients (86 %). The mean preoperative <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> height was 12. 1 mm, which increased immediately after surgery to 16. 2 mm, but had been reduced to 12. 6 mm at the latest follow-up assessment. The reduction in distraction occurred within the first 3 months after surgery and was correlated with age, but not with recurrence of symptoms, the amount of initial distraction, or the gender of the individual. A similar trend was seen with L 4 -L 5 segmental angulation. Conclusions. Reduction of <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> distraction after anterior lumbar interbody fusion using tricortical iliac crest bone graft is a common finding. Despite this, the fusion rate is high, and there is no association with symptom recurrence. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
