40|$|In Cambodia, the {{planting}} of rice lines with a competitive and/or allelopathic ability {{would be a}} very useful way to supplement weed management in the rain-fed, low-input production systems. The present study examines a wide range of rice germplasm, mainly from Cambodia, and uses a series of bioassay techniques to identify those that might have a weed growth-suppressing, allelopathic trait. A laboratory bioassay study that involved 359 rice lines showed that there were 15 that could significantly reduce the growth of awnless barnyard grass seedlings. In a second laboratory bioassay, involving the best 96 rice lines that were identified in the first study, 14 were shown to <b>suppress</b> <b>the</b> shoot growth of awnless barnyard grass, 11 could <b>suppress</b> <b>the</b> shoot growth of barnyard grass, six could <b>suppress</b> <b>the</b> shoot growth of small umbrella sedge, four could <b>suppress</b> <b>the</b> shoot growth of two-leaf fimbristylis, four could <b>suppress</b> <b>the</b> shoot growth of water primrose, and three could <b>suppress</b> <b>the</b> shoot growth of gooseweed. Of the 13 rice lines that were able to <b>suppress</b> <b>the</b> growth of at least two weed species, there were three lines that could <b>suppress</b> <b>the</b> growth of three weed species, one line that could <b>suppress</b> <b>the</b> growth of four weed species, and one line that could <b>suppress</b> <b>the</b> growth of five weed species. In a third soil-based, pot bioassay that studied the 18 best lines coming from the second laboratory bioassay, all showed a significant weed growth-suppressive ability. A linear regression analysis showed that there was no correlation between their weed growth-suppressive ability and their physical seedling size, supporting the idea that the growth suppression was allelopathic in nature and not a physical competition effect. In summary, the results indicate that an allelopathic trait does exist in some Cambodian rice lines and that this trait is effective in the growth suppression of a number of major rice weeds...|$|R

40|$|AbstractInteraction between adipocytes and macrophages {{contributes}} {{to the development of}} insulin resistance in obese adipose tissues. In this study, we examined whether luteolin, food-derived flavonoid, could <b>suppress</b> <b>the</b> production of inflammatory mediators of the interaction between adipocytes and macrophages. Experiments using a coculture system of adipocytes and macrophages showed that luteolin <b>suppressed</b> <b>the</b> production of inflammatory mediators. In addition, activated macrophages were targets for the suppressive effect of luteolin. Luteolin inhibited the phosphorylation of JNK and <b>suppressed</b> <b>the</b> production of inflammatory mediators in the activated macrophages. The findings indicate that luteolin can inhibit the interaction between adipocytes and macrophages to <b>suppress</b> <b>the</b> production of inflammatory mediators, suggesting that luteolin is a valuable food-derived compound for the treatment of metabolic syndrome...|$|R

The Byzantine navy accompanied the expedition, tasked with carrying troops to effect a landing in the enemy's rear and to cut off their retreat across the Danube. The emperor chose Easter week of 971 to make his move, catching the Rus' completely by surprise: The passes of the Balkan mountains had been left unguarded, either because the Rus' were busy suppressing Bulgarian revolts or perhaps (as A.D. Stokes suggests) because a peace agreement that had been concluded after the battle of Arcadiopolis made them complacent.|$|E
