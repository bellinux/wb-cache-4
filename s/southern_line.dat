5|$|Caroline Island {{remained}} uninhabited and undisturbed through World War II and afterwards. It remained under British jurisdiction, repossessed by the British Western Pacific High Commission in 1943 and governed {{as part of}} the Central and <b>Southern</b> <b>Line</b> Islands. In January 1972, the Central and <b>Southern</b> <b>Line</b> Islands, including Caroline, {{were joined}} with the British colony of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands, which had become autonomous in 1971 as part of British decolonization efforts.|$|E

5|$|Standard gauge rail {{services}} from Sydney {{came with the}} extension of the Main <b>Southern</b> <b>line</b> to Cootamundra and Junee in 1878 and the construction of the Murrumbidgee River Railway Bridge in 1881 allowed the line to be extended past Wagga Wagga to Henty and Albury later that year. A branch line was constructed to Temora in 1893 and extended to Barellan in 1908, Griffith in 1916 and Hillston in 1923. Further south, a branch line was completed from Junee to Narrandera in 1881 and extended to Hay by 1882. Another branch pushed south from Narrandera toward the Victorian border reaching Jerilderie in 1884 and the Murray at Tocumwal in 1898.|$|E
5|$|At the intersection, Routes957 and958 become {{concurrent}} along a westbound residential street, until leaving Lottsville, {{where the}} two routes turn to the southwest in fields. As Routes 957 and958 approach a railroad line used by Norfolk Southern (and previously the Erie Railroad), Route958 forks to the north, paralleling and soon crossing the rails northwest of Lottsville. The distinctively rural surroundings for Route958 return, and the Norfolk <b>Southern</b> <b>line</b> parallels to the east as the highway curves northwestward. Soon, Route958 returns to a farming region and curves away from the railroad on a mountainside. After passing a large pond, the route intersects Greeley Street a t-intersection in Bear Lake, where Route958 turns eastward through the rural areas before intersecting with North Road, where the route turns northward and reaches the New York state line near Niobe, New York. Route958 terminates here, and the right-of-way continues northward as Chautauqua County Route33 (PanamaBear Lake Road).|$|E
5|$|Located {{entirely in}} Salt Lake County, Utah, SR-202 begins at an {{intersection}} with SR-201 and 11500West northwest of Magna, Utah. The road travels northwesterly, bordered {{on the east}} by a large tailing pond owned by Kennecott Utah Copper {{and part of the}} former Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad rail line, which is now owned by the Union Pacific Railroad (UP). The parallel rail line intersects a pair of east–west rail lines, the <b>southern</b> <b>line</b> being UP main line, and the northern line being the Feather River Route of the former Western Pacific Railroad, which is now owned by UP. After crossing the rail lines, SR-202 intersects with I-80 near the Great Salt Lake State Park and comes to a terminus at the I-80 frontage road, which provides access to the Great Salt Lake State Park and to the Saltair resort. Kennecott Utah Copper owns all of the land surrounding SR-202, except for the right-of-way for the railroad, and the highway itself.|$|E

5|$|At this point, DE 9 becomes West 7th Street {{and passes}} and {{industrial}} development. The route turns north-northwest onto Washington Street and crosses Norfolk Southern's New Castle Secondary railroad line, heading into residential areas. DE 9 {{comes to an}} intersection with the southern terminus of DE 141 and the eastern terminus of DE 273, at which point DE 9 Truck returns to the route by way of DE 273. Here, DE 9 turns east onto Delaware Street and is signed concurrent with DE 273, even though this portion of road is officially not DE 273. The road carries one eastbound lane and two westbound lanes. The route narrows back to two lanes and crosses the New Castle Industrial Track Trail before it heads across the Norfolk <b>Southern</b> <b>line</b> again, at which point it turns east-northeast onto Ferry Cut Off Street near the New Castle Historic District. The historic district {{is home to the}} New Castle Court House Museum, New Castle Green, and the Sherriff's House, which are all part of First State National Historical Park. The road passes homes and businesses before intersecting East 6th Street, where DE 273 signage ends.|$|E
5|$|The Seventh and Eighth Armies Ottoman {{defenders}} were {{supplied by}} two railways which crisscrossed the battlefield. A railway ran from Haifa on the Mediterranean coast {{to join the}} main railway from Istanbul to Deraa, which crossed the Jordan River before passing Beisan to enter the Judean Hills at Jenin. There were also good roads from Haifa and Damascus, via Nazareth and Jenin. From Deraa the extensive railway network, branched into two lines. The <b>southern</b> <b>line</b> known as the Hejaz railway continued east of the Jordan River to supply the Ottoman Fourth Army headquarters at Amman, the garrisons at Shunet Nimrin and Es Salt and the forces scattered along several hundred miles of the southern Hejaz railway. The western line known as the Palestine Railways crossed the Jordan River at Jisr Mejamie to become the Jezreel Valley railway, as it ran southwards down {{the west bank of}} the Jordan River to Beisan, on the western edge of the Esdraelon Plain. From there it turned westward to run parallel to the front line in the Judean Hills, to Afulah. Here the railway branched again into two lines, one line running north–westerly to Haifa on the Mediterranean coast, while the main line turned south across the Esdraelon Plan to Jenin. From Jenin the railway wound through a narrow pass in the foothills to climb to Messudieh Junction in the Judean Hills where it again branched. One line continued south–eastward to Nablus the Seventh Army headquarters, located on the main road to Jenin, Nazareth and Damascus, while the second line ran westward to Tulkarm and the Eighth Army headquarters before turning south to reach railhead behind the Eighth Army' front line on the coastal plain.|$|E

25|$|Two {{proposals}} were issued in 1917 for a suburban tram line further north. The southern proposal {{was to build}} the line {{as an extension of}} the Lilleaker Line, which would open in 1919. The line would go from the initial terminus at Lilleaker and extend towards Jar and Nadderud to Haslum. The northern proposal was for an extension of the Røa Line (at the time called the Smestad Line) via Røa to Hosle, Haslum and Fleskum to Kolsås. The latter was essentially a combination of the current Røa and Kolsås Lines. The two proposals caused local debate; generally people in western Bærum in general supported the northern line and people in eastern Bærum supported the <b>southern</b> <b>line.</b> An agreement was quickly reached with Kristiania Elektriske Sporvei (KES), the owner of the Lilleaker Line. The municipal council voted in favor of the <b>southern</b> <b>line</b> in 1921 after first rejecting a proposal to negotiate trackage rights with Holmenkolbanen. The main argument for the southern alternative was that the municipality would not have to pay any of the investment costs for the section of the line that would be localed within Aker.|$|E

Trial commuter services between Helensville, north of Swanson, and central Auckland commenced in July 2008, but ceased on Christmas Eve 2009 due to lower patronage than had been expected.|$|E
25|$|Two new {{traction}} power lines {{are used to}} supply power to the line (110kV). The 23.3kilometre-long <b>southern</b> <b>line</b> is to branch off at Wörlsdorf from the existing Nuremberg–Weimar line and end at the new Roth substation at the north portal of the Müß tunnel near Welchendorf in Thuringia. The 21kilometre-long northern line leads from the new Eischleben substation to the Wolfsberg substation. Over a length of about 4.4kilometres, the railway power line is carried through the Wipfra valley on 13 masts of a 380 kV transmission line, which runs from the Vieselbach substation to the Altenfeld substation. This eliminated the need for 15railway power line masts. For energy supply and data transmission, moreover, there are approximately 1,200km of cable.|$|E
