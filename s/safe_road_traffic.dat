40|$|Human errors play a {{vital role}} in road crashes. This {{presentation}} deals with the prevention of human errors by proper road planning, road design and improving existing roads (reconstruction/rehabilitation/resurfacing). Road safety considerations must play an explicit role in decision making in all three areas. Our knowledge about the relationships between <b>road</b> and <b>traffic</b> characteristics and <b>road</b> safety has increased enormously in the last decades, and we can apply this knowledge in decisions related to planning, design and operations. Different procedures are available or will be developed to use this knowledge in actual decision making. In road planning for example, a road safety impact assessment should be made in order to take road safety transparently into consideration. A minimum safety level should be defined and agreed upon between road authorities. Defining such a level has started in the Netherlands and we call this `Sustainable safety'. This concept focuses on three design principles: functionality, homogeneity, and predictability. These principles are introduced briefly in this presentation. If we implement `Sustainable safety', we expect to build a considerably <b>safer</b> <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> system by reducing human errors, taking into account limits given by human tolerances in crashes and eliminating `preventable crashes'. Of course, public support needs to be created in order to get this challenging concept implemented and accepted by the population.

30|$|Recently {{the use of}} ICTs during travelling, {{especially}} in the case of driving cars, has become a major problem for maintaining secure and <b>safe</b> urban <b>road</b> <b>traffic.</b> Traffic accidents due to multi-tasking and the use of ICT devices are rapidly growing [23]. Nonetheless, ICTs contribute at least to the social inclusion of mobility-impaired and -constrained people [24]. Similarly, governmental and technical resource-efficiency measures have been insufficiently effective. For instance, the actual efficiency of new engines or power units depends on its form of drive (e.g., fuel, diesel, gas or electricity), application and use [25, 26]. In comparison to older, lighter and simple operating cars, present heavier and bigger vehicles equipped with a mass of electronics demand much power/energy in operation, are more resource-consuming in production and, depending on the particular use, new cars are comparably inefficient [27]. Improvements of renewable-powered vehicles (e-mobility) and infrastructure (network of solar-generated charging stations) are promising developments with regard to the replacement of fossil-fuel-powered vehicles and enabling multiplier-effects as well as closed resource consumption loops.|$|R
40|$|A four-wheeled moped (FWM) is a mini {{passenger}} {{car with a}} top speed of 45 km/h. This report carries out an initial exploration of the consequences of introducing the FWM in The Netherlands concerning road safety. Recommendations were made about the policy to be adopted and the measures to be taken. The most important information was obtained from: (1) importers of the FWM; (2) the SWOV sister organizations in France, Italy, and Belgium; and (3) from the Dutch Department of Public Works. It was established that the prime target group consists of 55 to 60 year-olds and older persons, who do not have a driving licence. It was concluded that the FWM does not fit into the development of a `sustainably <b>safe</b> <b>road</b> and <b>traffic</b> system' in The Netherlands. It is recommended to prohibit admission of the FWM to cycle paths. The FWM could in principle only be permitted on maximum 50 km/h speed limit roads inside built-up areas. FWM drivers should have a specific driving licence type. It is recommended to set the minimum age for driving a FWM at eighteen years.

40|$|Apart from {{technical}} {{issues that have}} to be solved for a successful introduction of Automated Vehicle Guidance (AVG), several uncertainties about the behaviour of road users that will be exposed to telematics applications in traffic have to be tackled. The working group agreed with the first statement of Wiel Janssen, viz. that with the current knowledge the direction of safety effects of AVG systems (positive or negative) can not be predicted. The second statement (also in extensively automated systems the human factor plays an essential role) was confirmed as well with the expectation that for near-future systems the driver always will stay in charge for legal reasons. Modern insight in task allocation should be applied to come to an optimal split of tasks between operator (road user) and computer (AVG) (third statement by Janssen). The general conclusion is that many human factors issues have to be solved before large-scale implementation of automated systems can become reality, especially with respect to the consequences of behaviour and as an important part the acceptance by road users. At the moment, it is not even possible to predict whether a safety effect will be positive or negative.

40|$|The Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) {{becomes an}} {{important}} component of the smart city toward <b>safer</b> <b>roads,</b> better <b>traffic</b> control, and on-demand service by utilizing and processing the information collected from sensors of vehicles and road side infrastructure. In ITS, Vehicular Cloud Computing (VCC) is a novel technology balancing the requirement of complex services and the limited capability of on-board computers. However, the behaviors of the vehicles in VCC are dynamic, random, and complex. Thus, one of the key safety issues is the frequent disconnections between the vehicle and the Vehicular Cloud (VC) when this vehicle is computing for a service. More important, the connection fault will disturb seriously the normal services of VCC and impact the safety works of the transportation. In this paper, a safety resource allocation mechanism is proposed against connection fault in VCC by using a modified workflow with prediction capability. We firstly propose the probability model for the vehicle movement which satisfies the high dynamics and real-time requirements of VCC.

40|$|The Dutch Government {{has set the}} {{following}} quantitative targets for road safety: a 25 per cent {{reduction in the number}} of road deaths and injuries by the year 2000 (compared with 1985 levels) and a further reduction of 50 % and 40 % respectively by the year 201 0 (compared with 1986 levels). Various indicators suggest that road safety in The Netherlands is not showing enough significant signs of improvement and it is no longer certain that the aforementioned targets will be met, even if the traditional policy continued to be followed. New, innovative road safety policy is required and in 1990 SWOV Institute for Road Safety Research was invited by the Dutch Government to develop a scientifically supported, long term concept of a considerably safer road traffic system. The general concept of sustainable development introduced by the UN Brundtland Commission also inspired the new vision for road safety: no longer do we want to hand over a road traffic system to the next generation in which we have to accept that road transport inevitably causes thousands of deaths and ten thousands of injuries, year after year in The Netherlands. A sustainably <b>safe</b> <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> system is one in which the road infrastructure has been adapted to the limitations of human capacity through proper road design, in which vehicles are technically equipped to simplify driving and to give all possible protection to vulnerable human beings, and in which road users have been properly educated, informed, and, where necessary, deterred from undesirable or dangerous behaviour. Man should be the reference standard and road safety problems should be tackled at its roots. Safety Principles were identified as keys to arrive at a sustainably safe system (functional use of the road network, homogeneous use en predictable use) and based on these Principles as a basically theoretical perspective the concept has been worked out. Stimulated by a discussion in the Dutch Parliament, the concept of sustainable road safety has been adopted by the Dutch Government as an official part of its policy. Many other stake-holders supported the concept (other governmental levels and the `road safety community'), although some doubts have been heard about financing the implementation and about possible side-effects. Furthermore, some differences how to translate the vision practically could be detected between road safety professionals. Two major developments took place since the concept was launched. A special Steering Committee prepared a so-called Start-up Programme covering the first phase of implementation. Another important step was to implement different large scale demonstration projects in The Netherlands in order to enlarge our practical knowledge and experience on how sustainable road safety may be put into practice. Estimates have been made to investigate what the introduction of a sustainably safe traffic system would cost. The first SWOV-estimations resulted in 60 billion Dutch guilders; a major proportion of this money should be invested in adapting the existing road infrastructure according to the Principles of sustainable safety. Based on different recent and more detailed estimations, a more sober implementation would cost 30 billion Dutch guilders. SWOV has suggested to spread these investments over a period of 30 years in order to run these investments in parallel with the standard maintenance of the road infrastructure; a period of 30 years is a reasonable one for the Dutch circumstances. If we invest 30 billion Dutch guilders over a period of 30 years, we estimate a reduction of 60 % of the number of road accident casualties. Even if we use a conservative basis for cost-effectiveness estimations, SWOV concludes a cost-effectiveness of 9 %, which is considerably higher than the customary government standard of a 4 % return on investment for infrastructure projects. The key stakeholder to realise a sustainably <b>safe</b> <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> system is the government, either directly as investor or indirectly as `broker' between those who could invest and those who profit from the benefits.

In this advanced version, adaptations have been made, where necessary, {{based on what we}} have learned from our first steps towards sustainably <b>safe</b> <b>road</b> <b>traffic.</b> The vision has also been updated in line with new insights and developments. This book is not a policy document. However, elements of the advanced concept could be further developed in the future, and could provide inspiration for the policy agenda of all levels of government, the private sector and civic society, etc. Every chapter provides many recommendations and possible leads for future road safety policy. The comprehensive exposition of Sustainable Safety starts with a section comprising theoretical backgrounds and analyses. Firstly, there is a chapter with general theoretical backgrounds to the Sustainable Safety vision (Chapter 1), followed by analyses of road safety problems in the Netherlands (Chapter 2). The final chapter of Part I (Chapter 3) discusses an evaluation of what has been learned during a decade of Sustainable Safety about implementation and the effects of measures based on that vision. Part II and III discuss the elaboration in the content of the advanced Sustainable Safety vision. Part II focuses on various types of measures in the field of infrastructure (Chapter 4), vehicles (Chapter 5), Intelligent Transport Systems (Chapter 6), education (Chapter 7) and regulation and enforcement directed at road user behaviour (Chapter 8). Part III focuses on specific problem areas or groups within road safety. These are identified as speed management (Chapter 9), drink and drug driving (Chapter 10), young and novice drivers (Chapter 11), cyclists and pedestrians (Chapter 12), motorized two-wheelers (Chapter 13) and heavy goods vehicles (Chapter 14).
