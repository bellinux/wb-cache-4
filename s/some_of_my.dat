5|$|I am {{excited to}} give my Australian fans the World Premiere of 'Love On Top'! Thank you for the amazing {{response}} to the song at radio. I have worked very hard on this video, this song is special to me and I had an idea for the video based on <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> favorite male groups. I remember seeing videos from New Edition, The Jackson 5 and the Temptations, bands I love for their beautiful harmonies, and precise choreography and I always {{wanted to make a}} video and be part of a boy group myself. It was so much fun. I put my heart and soul into 'Love On Top' and I hope you love it.|$|E

25|$|Garroway, {{an amateur}} drummer and inveterate music lover, lent {{his name to}} a series of {{recordings}} of jazz, classical, and pop music released in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

25|$|<b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> {{critics have}} painted me {{as a kind}} of moral leper, {{comparing}} me to those who deny that the Jewish Holocaust happened, that six million Jews were murdered during the Holocaust. Others say my work is a revisionist job, useful, perhaps, in stimulating debate, but otherwise too extreme to be considered reliable. Of course, I disagree with those appraisals.|$|E

25|$|Darling went on {{to appear}} in other {{independent}} films, including Brand X, by Wynn Chamberlain, Silent Night, Bloody Night, {{as well as a}} co-starring role as a victim of trans-bashing in <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>My</b> Best Friends Are... She appeared in Klute with Jane Fonda and Lady Liberty with Sophia Loren. In 1971 she went to Vienna to make two films with director Werner Schroeter; The Death of Maria Malibran, and another one that was never released. Her attempt at breaking into the mainstream movie circuit, by campaigning for the leading role in Myra Breckinridge, (1970) led to rejection and bitterness.|$|E
25|$|Bob Summers, my brother-in-law, {{has come}} into his own over the years too. Bob and I worked a lot on MGM records with the Mike Curb scene, early 1960s. He also was chief {{arranger}} for the Mike Curb Congregation, and they recorded <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> material, great too! Also Bob and I worked at Capitol Records for Ken Nelson and Cliffie Stone, passed recently. Too many country artists to even name nearly all of them: Hank Thompson, Wynn Stewart, Rose Maddox and others. Roy Lanham did one of his better albums at the Sound House, Merced, in El Monte (my old stamping grounds) and Mary Ford's home place, 9840 Kale Street. Bruce Summers (who is no longer with us), a piano man whom I played with a few times; a real swinger too.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea for}} the series was {{conceived}} as Marc Cherry and his mother were watching a news report on Andrea Yates. Prior to Desperate Housewives, Cherry was best known for producing and writing episodes of Touchstone Television's hit comedy series The Golden Girls and its successor, The Golden Palace. In addition, he had created or co-created three sitcoms: The 5 Mrs. Buchanans, The Crew, and <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>My</b> Best Friends, none of which lasted longer than a year. Cherry had difficulty getting any television network interested in his new series; HBO, CBS, NBC, Fox, Showtime, and Lifetime all turned the show down. Finally, two new executives at ABC, Lloyd Braun and Susan Lyne, chose to greenlight it, reportedly after The O.C. on Fox premiered in 2003 and showed that a soap opera could succeed in prime time. Shortly thereafter, Disney had both Braun and Lyne fired, following their approval of another new drama series: Lost.|$|E

25|$|It is {{time for}} a new beginning. As I have {{discussed}} with <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> friends over the past few weeks, my elected service is one piece of what I hope will be an interesting and diverse professional career. After spending more than 13 of my 31 years in public service, it {{is time for}} a change for me and my family. I was appointed to my first public position as a college freshman and leave my second elected office as a proud father of three little girls. I am stepping down today from the State Assembly to turn greater attention to them and my law practice and to fulfilling other personal and professional aspirations. I will remain an active and vocal voice for better schools, a cleaner environment and lower taxes. I am grateful for the friendship and support of so many, especially my wife Lauren, my family, my campaign volunteers and my clients. It has been a privilege to serve.|$|E
25|$|For most of {{her life}} Louisa Meredith lived on {{properties}} around Swansea. In 1860 she published <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>My</b> Bush Friends in Tasmania which contained elaborate full-colour plates printed by the new chromolithography process. The illustrations were drawn by herself, and simple descriptions of characteristic native flowers were given. In 1861 an account of a visit to Victoria in 1856, Over the Straits, was published, and in 1880 Tasmanian Friends and Foes, Feathered, Furred and Finned. This went into a second edition in 1881. In 1891, Meredith went to London to supervise the publication of Last Series, Bush Friends in Tasmania. Published {{at the beginning of a}} severe financial depression in the Australian colonies, this project and the collapse of the bank where {{most of her}} savings were held ruined her financially. In her final years Meredith suffered from chronic sciatica and became blind in one eye. She died in Collingwood, Victoria (a suburb of Melbourne) on 21 October 1895 and was survived by sons Owen and George.|$|E
25|$|I {{composed}} the fugue first and {{wrote it down}} while I was thinking out the prelude. I only {{hope that you will}} be able to read it, for it is written so very small; and I hope further that you will like it. Another time I shall send you something better for the clavier. My dear Constanze is really the cause of this fugue's coming into the world. Baron van Swieten, to whom I go every Sunday, gave me all the works of Händel and Sebastian Bach to take home with me (after I had played them to him). When Constanze heard the fugues, she absolutely fell in love with them. Now she will listen to nothing but fugues, and particularly (in this kind of composition) the works of Händel and Bach. Well, as she has often heard me play fugues out of my head, she asked me if I had ever written any down, and when I said I had not, she scolded me roundly for not recording <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> compositions in this most artistically beautiful of all musical forms and never ceased to entreat me until I wrote down a fugue for her.|$|E

500|$|Carey and her {{management}} {{then decided}} to release [...] "It's Like That", which Carey called [...] "the right fire-starter", as the album's lead single.

[...] Kid Cudi also tweeted: [...] "The overall tone of indicud is positive and confident," [...] adding: [...] "The energy of Indicud is its own new thing. New format with <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> favorite musical tricks here and there. The album moves dope".|$|E
500|$|Cudi also {{incorporated}} {{quotes from}} his favorite movies into the album, wherever he saw fit. The first release with a movie quote was [...] "Immortal", where Cudi sampled Adam Sandler in his 1995 film Billy Madison: [...] "That’s {{one of my}} favorite movies, man. From my childhood, straight up. I love Adam Sandler. Throughout the album I wanted to include clips from <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> favorite movies to kind of narrate the album a bit and liven it up and give it some personality." [...] He declared that throughout the album, people will hear scenes from several different movies: [...] "Yeah, different actors will pop up periodically. That’s how I felt when I finished the song. 'Oh my God. It's so good!' [...] So {{there had to be a}} way that I could express myself. So I had to find <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> favorite quotes from my favorite movies. I put on Billy Madison and just watched that. There were so many lines that I picked that were great. But “I’m the smartest man alive!” resonated with me. And Adam Sandler is like a god to me. He’s so amazing. I just wanted to pay homage through song and let him know, like, 'You’re the shit!'" ...|$|E

I entreat them to assist to emancipate their companion, to make her a help meet for them! Would men but generously snap our chains, and be content with rational fellowship instead of slavish obedience, they would find us more observant daughters, more affectionate sisters, more faithful wives, more reasonable mothers– in a word, better citizens.|$|E
500|$|West {{said that}} he began to {{experience}} [...] "some vocal fatigue" [...] in April 2007. He said [...] "I had lost <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> vocal range, staying on higher notes and lower notes. I even began having a hard time speaking." [...] At a vocal check-up in response to the issue, West's doctors at the Nashville Vanderbilt Voice Center discovered [...] "hemorrhaging caused by some polyps". He was told by his doctors that vocal surgery was the only option, since a few weeks had passed. The surgery took place on May 17, 2007, a process that he said was [...] "career threatening." [...] Afterward, he was prescribed a two-month period of silence for vocal rest.|$|E
500|$|George Salmond was Scotland's first ODI captain, {{leading his}} {{team in the}} 1999 World Cup. In the {{intervening}} years between the World Cup and Scotland gaining ODI status in 2006, the captaincy had passed on to Craig Wright. After his team were knocked out of the 2007 World Cup in the first round, Wright resigned the captaincy. He was replaced by Ryan Watson. Watson said Wright was a hard act to follow and he intended [...] "to pick up where Craig left off, bring in <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own ideas and hopefully achieve {{the same level of}} success". Early in 2009, after Scotland failed to qualify for the 2011 World Cup, Watson stepped down as captain and was replaced by Gavin Hamilton.|$|E
