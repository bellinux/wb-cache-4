50|$|In February 2011, three Beitillu {{houses were}} vandalised by {{anonymous}} graffiti artists who painted slogans like 'Muhammad is a pig' on their walls, probably as {{a price tag}} policy retaliation for the forced evacuation of a <b>settler</b> <b>outpost</b> near Kiryat Arba.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{settlers}} have publicly adopted {{what they}} refer to as a [...] "price tag" [...] policy whereby settlers attack Palestinian villages in retaliation after <b>settler</b> <b>outposts</b> are removed by the Israeli government.|$|R
5000|$|Pressured by America, the Sharon {{administration}} {{commissioned the}} Sasson Report, {{which found that}} the Israeli government had funded the creation of Jewish <b>settler</b> <b>outposts</b> in the West Bank that were unauthorized and in violation of stated government policy. According to the report, the Housing and Construction Ministry, the World Zionist Organization, the Education Ministry and the Defense Ministry cooperated to [...] "systematically establish illegal settlement points", paying {{millions of dollars to}} create the infrastructure for scores of settlements.|$|R
2500|$|In May 2012 the 27 {{ministers of}} foreign affairs of the European Union {{published}} a report strongly denouncing policies of the State of Israel in the West Bank and finding that settlements in the West Bank are illegal: [...] "settlements remain illegal under international law, irrespective of recent decisions {{by the government of}} Israel. The EU reiterates that it will not recognize any changes to the pre-1967 borders including with regard to Jerusalem, other than those agreed by the parties." [...] The report by all EU foreign ministers also criticized the Israeli government's failure to dismantle <b>settler</b> <b>outposts</b> illegal even under domestic Israeli law." ...|$|R
50|$|The first notable {{battle was}} the Fort Parker {{massacre}} in 1836, {{in which a}} huge war party of Comanches, Kiowa, Witchitas, and Delaware attacked the <b>settler</b> <b>outpost</b> Fort Parker. Despite {{the small number of}} white settlers killed during the raid, the abduction of Cynthia Ann Parker caused widespread outrage among Texas' Anglo settlers.|$|E
5000|$|Having {{acquired}} Kenya and Uganda, the British {{sought to}} develop infrastructure and link {{the coast to}} Lake Victoria. The Uganda Railway serves as a lasting legacy of this ambition. The railway opened up much of the Kenyan interior to European settlement, and in 1899 British pioneers established Nairobi as a <b>settler</b> <b>outpost.</b> The period saw an influx of European settlers and farmers seeking to make a fortune, most notably the British peer Lord Delamere. Many of these settlers imagined an [...] "empty" [...] Africa where they hoped to recreate a society that mirrored their fantasy of manorial Europe, where they would rule as lords and Africans would serve as retainers.|$|E
5000|$|According to The Economist in October 2009, 200 {{olive trees}} {{belonging}} to villagers from Al-Mughayyir, Ramallah (Al Mughayyir), were felled by settlers from the illegal <b>settler</b> <b>outpost</b> at Adei Ad, near Shvut Rachel. October is harvest time for olives {{and is often}} a time of [...] "tension between Palestinian farmers and Jewish settlers", and The Economist tied the destruction of trees to the settlers' 'price tag policy. [...] "Many of the settlers pursue a “price-tag policy”, deliberately instigating violence and mayhem so that the Israeli military and political establishment is loth to take action, such as evacuating the 100-plus “illegal” settlements, for fear of further violence. As international criticism has mounted, even in America, several Israeli governments have promised to dismantle the outposts but so far little has been done. The settlers are generally against the peace process, because it could mean their expulsion. So whenever {{there are signs of}} negotiation, they increase their attacks—among other things, on olive trees. They want to show who controls the land." [...] The Economist ...|$|E
5000|$|According to {{a report}} of the Israeli Environmental Protection Ministry, waste water {{management}} is [...] "virtually nonexistent" [...] in unauthourized Jewish <b>settler</b> <b>outposts</b> and some other settlements, thus raw sewage is contaminating the ground water in parts of the West Bank. According to the report, the main cause of the contaminated water is that raw waste water flows from Hebron, Ramallah, Nablus, Jenin and other villages, without proper treatment. The report blames Israeli settlements for pumping contaminated water into the sewers, not Palestinian villages. 70% of the Jewish communities east of the Green Line are connected to treatment facilities, so [...] "illegal outposts" [...] are the main source of the untreated water, according to the Israeli report.|$|R
50|$|Regavim focuses most {{intensely}} {{on construction}} {{work in the}} Galilee, Negev, and the West Bank {{that has been done}} by Israeli Arabs and Palestinians without Israeli permits. Regavim has also directly petitioned against government removal of <b>settler</b> <b>outposts.</b> It has also petitioned successfully to stop Israeli demolition orders against settler homes, {{as in the case of}} Har Bracha in April 2010, and Migron. According to its director Ari Briggs, the courts and Civil Administration are often slow to act against illegal Palestinian construction activity, and Regavim files lawsuits to prod the courts to issue demolition orders. After Yesh Din successfully petitioned the state to force settlers in the illegal Israeli outpost of El Matan to seal an unauthorized synagogue, Regavim retaliated by petitioning the Israeli Supreme Court to have a mosque, still under construction and serving 400 worshippers in Al Mufaqara, bulldozed in the West Bank on the grounds it was in Area C. Their suit was successful.|$|R
50|$|In 2011, <b>settlers</b> {{from the}} <b>outpost</b> of Havat Ma'on {{attacked}} internationals and Palestinians five times within 30 days. On 13 July, three settler youth attacked Palestinian shepherds. On 18 July, 3 masked settlers armed with clubs attacked two shepherds {{and members of}} the At-Tuwani peace team.|$|R
50|$|The {{beginnings}} of settlement {{in this area}} dates back to 6th century AD. The Sokołów area belongs {{to that part of}} Podlasie, which, due to its location, was a typical <b>settler</b> <b>outpost.</b> This area in early Medieval was a scene of the feudal fights between Polish and Russian state, the Teutonic Knights, Yotvingians and Lithuanians. Political history of this land strongly influenced its cultural development and progress of colonisation. The archaeological research was conducted to determinate the cultural and ethnic structure of the settlements. Quite numerous archaeological sites from early Middle Ages was found in the area, which allowed the scientists to accurately reproduce phases of colonisation process and the character of defensive and residential building structures of the settlements. Archaeologists found evidence of settlements in the area dated from 6th and 7th centuries. Ceramics, iron fittings, buckles, beads, staples and numerous items of burial equipment testify about the culture, customs and rituals celebrated to honour the dead. The study confirmed that in a place a of an old Russian and Polish settlements in Cetynia river valley, as a result of gradual colonisation, new settlement of Sokołów was established.|$|E
50|$|In 2001, <b>settlers</b> {{built the}} <b>outpost</b> Havat Ma'on (also named Hill 833 or Tel Abu Jundiya) {{on the other}} side of the road. By 2003, Palestinians stopped using the main road completely. Settlers from Ma'on fenced off private Palestinian lands by the road and now use the land for {{agricultural}} purposes.|$|R
50|$|In 2001, Jewish <b>settlers</b> {{established}} the <b>outpost</b> Havat Ma'on (also named Hill 833 or Tel Abu Jundiya) {{on the other}} side of the main road. In 2003, settlers took over Palestinian land near the road, which was abandoned due to ongoing settlers attacks; on 25 December, several new outposts were set up.|$|R
40|$|How does {{terrorism}} affect land {{control in}} intrastate conflicts? This paper explores {{this question in}} the case of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict during the Second Intifada (2000 - 2005), and shows that Palestinian attacks lead to an expansion of Israeli outposts in the disputed territories of the West Bank. Following suicide attacks, there is an increase in outposts in home districts of the perpetrators. The number of outposts also increases following deadly attacks against Israelis in West Bank districts where these attacks take place. These results suggest that Israeli <b>settlers</b> use <b>outpost</b> expansion as retaliation against Palestinian communities they perceive to be involved in violence, and this shifts territorial control against Palestinians...|$|R
5000|$|According to the Shin Bet, the {{internal}} Israeli security service, Ettinger {{set up in}} September 2013 an organization dedicated to {{the overthrow of the}} state in four stages by striking it where it was most vulnerable.In 2012 Ettinger was arrested for complicity in what Israeli media termed the [...] "spy affair". According to the indictment, 5 settler youths had organized an [...] "operations room" [...] for monitoring IDF movements in the West Bank in order to intercept communications and forewarn <b>settlers</b> in <b>outposts</b> of IDF plans to evacuate the sites. Ettinger was subsequently sentenced to a 6-month term for [...] "conspiracy to collect information of military value". Israeli media regarded Ettinger as 'the most-wanted figure by the Jewish division of the Shin Bet.' ...|$|R
25|$|Europeans {{began to}} settle {{permanently}} in 1826 when Albany was claimed by Britain to forestall French {{claims to the}} western third of the continent. Perth was founded as the Swan River Colony in 1829 by British and Irish <b>settlers,</b> though the <b>outpost</b> languished. Its officials eventually requested convict labour to augment its population. In the 1890s, interstate immigration, resulting from a mining boom in the Goldfields region, resulted in a sharp population increase.|$|R
5000|$|Israel {{has had its}} {{settlement}} {{growth and}} policies in the Palestinian territories harshly criticized by the European Union citing it as increasingly undermining {{the viability of the}} two-state solution and running in contrary to the Israeli-stated commitment to resume negotiations. In December 2011, all the regional groupings on the UN Security Council named continued settlement construction and settler violence as disruptive to the resumption of talks, a call viewed by Russia as a [...] "historic step". In April 2012, international outrage followed Israeli steps to further entrench the Jewish settlements in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, which included the publishing of tenders for further settler homes and the plan to legalize <b>settler</b> <b>outposts.</b> Britain said that the move was a breach of Israeli commitments under the road map to freeze all settlement expansion in the land captured since 1967. The British Foreign Minister stated that the [...] "Systematic, illegal Israeli settlement activity poses the most significant and live threat to the viability of the two state solution".In May 2012 the 27 foreign ministers of the European Union issued a statement which condemned continued Israeli settler violence and incitement. In a similar move, the Quartet [...] "expressed its concern over ongoing settler violence and incitement in the West Bank," [...] calling on Israel [...] "to take effective measures, including bringing the perpetrators of such acts to justice." [...] The Palestinian Ma'an News agency reported the PA Cabinet's statement on the issue stated that the West, including East Jerusalem, were seeing [...] "an escalation in incitement and settler violence against our people with a clear protection from the occupation military. The last of which was the thousands of settler march in East Jerusalem which included slogans inciting to kill, hate and supports violence".|$|R
500|$|In 1625, {{another group}} of English <b>settlers</b> {{established}} an <b>outpost</b> {{not far from the}} site of Wessagusset, located in what is now Quincy, Massachusetts, about [...] north of Plymouth. The settlement was officially known as Mount Wollaston, but soon earned the nickname [...] "Merrymount." [...] Their leader Thomas Morton encouraged behavior that the Pilgrims found objectionable and dangerous. [...] The men of Merrymount built a maypole, drank liberally, refused to observe the Sabbath, and sold weapons to Native Americans. [...] Bradford found the weapons sales particularly disturbing and ordered Standish to lead an expedition to arrest Morton in 1628.|$|R
5000|$|In January 2015, {{settlers}} at what Haaretz {{referred to}} as the Adei Ad [...] "illegal outpost" [...] threw stones at diplomats from a U.S. delegation who had arrived to inspect vandalism reported at a grove of Palestinian-owned trees in the occupied West Bank. It was reported that Jewish <b>settlers</b> from the <b>outpost</b> were suspected of uprooting thousands of olive tree saplings, some of which had been planted in honor of senior Palestinian official Ziad Abu Ein, who collapsed and died after an altercation with an Israeli soldier. The American consulate came to inspect the grove because some of the land owners claim U.S. citizenship. This is the first known physical attack by Israelis against American diplomatic staff.|$|R
50|$|In any case, Minuit had {{a falling}} {{out with the}} {{directors}} of the Dutch West India Company, was recalled from New Netherland, and quickly made his services available to his many friends in Sweden, then a major power in European politics. They established a , aimed at settling the territory of New Sweden, and, following much negotiation, he led a group under the flag of Sweden to the Delaware River in 1638. They established a trading post at Fort Christina, now in Wilmington. Minuit claimed possession of the western side of the Delaware River, saying he had found no European settlement there. Unlike the Dutch West India Company, the Swedes intended to actually bring <b>settlers</b> to their <b>outpost</b> and begin a colony.|$|R
5000|$|In 2008, a yeshiva {{student from}} Yitzhar was arrested after a failed rocket attack on Burin. After Israeli police {{demolished}} a trailer home in Adei Ad, {{a group of}} settlers from Yitzhar vandalized cars, smashed windows and cut electricity wires in Burin. From mid-June 2008 to August 2008 the human rights group Yesh Din documented nine attacks on Palestinian families living in Burin allegedly carried out by <b>settlers</b> living in <b>outposts</b> near Yitzhar or Har Brakha. Cases of [...] "disturbances of the peace", a term referring to harm caused to Palestinians and their property, as well as harm to Israeli security forces, by Israeli citizens, rose in 2008, with 429 incidents {{in the first half}} of 2008, compared with 587 incidents in all of 2006 and 551 in 2007.|$|R
5000|$|In 2011, Christian Peacemaker Teams {{reported}} 5 {{attacks by}} <b>settlers</b> from the <b>outpost</b> Havat Ma'on on internationals and Palestinians within 30 days. On 13 July, three settler youth attacked Palestinian shepherds. On 18 July 3 masked settlers armed with clubs attacked two shepherds {{and members of}} the At-Tuwani peace team. In July 2012, Operazione Colomba reported an attack by masked settlers on a child and volunteers of [...] "Operation Dove". In January 2014, settlers threatened shepherds. At the end, the army arrested a shepherd. The following days, Israeli soldiers chased shepherds in the same area. In November 2014, the Israeli army was still escorting schoolchildren from Tubas to school in At-Tuwani and home, with no plans to cancel the twice daily escort, because of the risk of settler attacks.|$|R
5000|$|In July 2008 it was {{reportedly}} {{close to being}} expanded. According to Israeli Radio, the expansion {{was part of a}} deal between <b>settlers</b> in Israeli <b>Outposts</b> established without the permission of the Israeli Government and the Israeli Defense Ministry. Many of Maskiot's residents are planned to be settlers previously evicted from Gush Katif in the Gaza Strip as part of the Israeli disengagement from Gaza. Twenty housing units will be built for evacuees of Shirat HaYam. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said he was [...] "deeply concerned" [...] over the new Maskiot plan, whereas the British government said it was [...] "dismayed". A spokesman for US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said that the settlement expansion was [...] "not helpful", and [...] "inconsistent with Israel's commitment to the roadmap".|$|R
5|$|On December 16, 1811, {{the first}} of the New Madrid {{earthquakes}} shook the South and the Midwest. Many Indians took the earthquake as a sign that Tenskwatawa's predictions of doom were coming true, and they supported Tecumseh in greater number, including many of his former detractors. They increased their attacks against European-American <b>settlers</b> and isolated <b>outposts</b> in the Indiana and Illinois Territories, resulting in the deaths of many civilians. The Shawnee partially rebuilt Prophetstown over the next year, but it was destroyed by a second US campaign in 1812. Tecumseh continued {{to play a major role}} in military operations on the frontier. By the time the U.S. declared war on Great Britain in the War of 1812, Tecumseh's confederacy was ready to launch its own war against the United States, this time with British allies. Tecumseh's warriors made up nearly half of the British forces that captured Detroit from the United States in the War of 1812. It was not until Tecumseh's death at the 1813 Battle of the Thames in Ontario that his confederacy ceased to threaten the interests of the United States.|$|R
50|$|There {{have been}} a number violent {{incidents}} involving Havat Gilad settlers. On October 16, 2002, journalists covering a so-called “quiet” evacuation at the outpost, were attacked by settlers, on October 19, 2002, a Shabbath, when the outpost was forcibly evacuated and all its buildings were razed by the Israel Defense Forces for the first time, about 1,000 settlers, trying to prevent the dismantling of the outpost, clashed with soldiers and police. During the two days of confrontations, 46 policemen, and dozens of male and female soldiers and settlers were lightly injured. Fifteen people were arrested, but were released a few days later. Some of the settlers were back at the outpost the next day and erected temporary structures which were dismantled a week later, but the settlers were back on the site after a few hours. In November, security forces decided to file charges against twelve of the protesters. In 2004, police arrested one settler, after armed <b>settlers</b> from the <b>outpost</b> had opened fire on shepherds from a nearby Palestinian village. In March 2009, five residents of the outpost were briefly arrested on suspicion of throwing stones at police, when security forces attempted to evacuate the site. In September of the same year, settlers and security forces clashed following an attempt by security forces to confiscate a truck which was supposedly used to illegally transport a mobile home to the site, leading to four arrests. In October 2010, Havat Gilad settlers set fire to olive trees belonging to Palestinian farmers of the village of Farata.|$|R
