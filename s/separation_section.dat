50|$|The three {{configurations}} of separators {{are available for}} two-phase operation and three-phase operation. In the two-phase units, gas is separated from the liquid with the gas and liquid being discharged separately. Oil and gas separators are mechanically designed such that the liquid and gas components are separated from the hydrocarbon steam at specific temperature and pressure according to Arnold et al (2008). In three-phase separators, well fluid is separated into gas, oil, and water with the three fluids being discharged separately. The gas-liquid <b>separation</b> <b>section</b> of the separator {{is determined by the}} maximum removal droplet size using the Souders-Brown equation with an appropriate K factor. The oil-water <b>separation</b> <b>section</b> is held for a retention time that is provided by laboratory test data, pilot plant operating procedure, or operating experience. In the case where the retention time is not available, the recommended retention time for three-phase separator in API 12J is used. The sizing methods by K factor and retention time give proper separator sizes. According to Song et al (2010), engineers sometimes need further information for the design conditions of downstream equipment, i.e., liquid loading for the mist extractor, water content for the crude dehydrator/desalter or oil content for the water treatment.|$|E

40|$|Three {{pyrolysis}} {{processes for}} Mixed Plastic Waste (MPW) with different reactors (Bubbling Fluidized Bed, Circulating Fluidized Bed and Rotating Cone Reactor, respectively BFB, CFB and RCR) were designed and evaluated. The estimated fixed capital investment for a 50 kton/year MPW pyrolysis plant build in 1996 in the Netherlands varies from 14 million Nlg for the RCR to 20 million Nlg for the CFB pyrolysis plant. The Return On Investment (ROI) of the RCR plant (29. 5 %) is {{significantly higher than}} the ROI of the BFB and CFB pyrolysis plants (respectively 21. 7 and 14. 2 %). The lower temperature levels (less energy required) {{and the fact that the}} RCR requires no or little additional utilities are important operational advantages of the RCR. The chlorine from PVC was removed in this process using low temperature pyrolysis converting 98 % of the chlorine into HC 1 gas. The remaining chlorine is subsequently converted to CaCl 2 by reaction with CaCO 3, but this is unattractive from an economical and environmental point of view as a large amount of sand has to be disposed of to prevent agglomeration of CaCl 2 and sand at high CaCl 2 concentrations. Removal of the last 2 w% of chlorine using NH 3 or NaHCO 3 is probably preferable. A dedicated product <b>separation</b> <b>section</b> for a MPW pyrolysis plant of this size is economically not feasible as only 50 to 60 % of the polymer is converted to product gas, resulting in an economically unattractive scale for the product <b>separation</b> <b>section.</b> Integration of the pyrolysis plant with an existing chemical complex (naphtha cracker) should be preferred.

40|$|Steam {{cracking}} for {{the production}} of light olefins, such as ethylene and propylene, is the single most energyconsuming process in the chemical industry. This paper reviews conventional steam cracking and innovative olefin technologies in terms of energy efficiency. It is found that the pyrolysis section of a naphtha steam cracker alone consumes approximately 65 % of the total process energy and approximately 75 % of the total exergy loss. A family portrait of olefin technologies by feedstocks is drawn to search for alternatives. An overview of state-of-the-art naphtha cracking technologies shows that approximately 20 % savings on the current average process energy use are possible. Advanced naphtha cracking technologies in the pyrolysis section, such as advanced coil and furnace materials, could together lead to up to approximately 20 % savings on the process energy use by state-of-the-art technologies.

40|$|In an {{industrial}} hydrocracking plant, except to the reactor, the <b>separation</b> <b>section</b> {{can affect the}} accuracy of the developed mathematical model. In this study, two combined-bed six and seven-lump kinetic models for the hydrocracking of vacuum gas oil in a real refinery are developed and their accuracies for the prediction of product yields are compared. In the six-lump model, the engaged components are selected according to the actual products of the plant, but the seven-lump one is included of lumps which are partitioned based on the specified initial and final boiling points. For both approaches, a complete kinetic network with the catalyst-decay functions is considered. It is found that over a 17 -month period of operation from the start of run, the average absolute deviation (AAD%) of the six-lump and the seven-lump models for the yield prediction are 20. 51 % and 5. 21 %, respectively for all products. Additionally, the sum of residuals for the seven-lump model has been appreciably decreased in comparison to the six-lump one. Therefore, it is confirmed that partitioning of the products to the lumps with specific boiling points can acceptably decrease the deviation of the prediction.

40|$|Combine {{harvesters}} play a {{key role}} in agriculture as threshable crops take up about two thirds of the worldwide arable land. From an economic perspective there is a continuous demand for increased productivity of these machines, but the limits for the outside dimensions have been reached and the increased processing efficiency should not compromise the quality of the end product. The reduction of the straw length in the threshing section of a combine harvester is considered to be an important indicator for the crop processing quality. An aggressive threshing action or discontinuous flow of the crop material invokes high impact and friction forces on the crop. This breaks up the straw, resulting in a swath of low volume which complicates the subsequent baling process. Therefore, the impact of the settings of the threshing process on the straw quality, expressed in terms of the swath volume has been assessed in this study. An experimental design involving different combinations of machine settings has been applied and for each of these setting combinations the resulting swaths have been scanned with a LiDaR (Light Detection and Ranging) -sensor. By a backward stepwise regression a quadratic relation between the concave clearance and rotor speed setting and the swath height was found (R²= 0. 79). All terms in the model were significant (p value of F-statistic < 0. 05). The observed relation between machine parameters and straw quality is interpreted as a combination of forces on the crop and residence time of the crop in the threshing and <b>separation</b> <b>section.</b> Insight in the interaction of crop and machine is gained that could be a useful input for optimizing the settings of the threshing and <b>separation</b> <b>section.</b> status: publishe...|$|E

The design problem is outlined by studying the involved key aspects {{with respect to the}} crude composition, purity requirements and process integration. A discussion of candidate technology identifies multistage membrane processes as a promising option, for which a multicomponent thermo-economic design model is coupled to a process model for SNG production. In a design study using multi-objective optimisation, the most promising membrane configurations are identified and optimised with respect to cost and efficiency. Comparing design strategies that consider different levels of process integration, it is shown that coupling the reactive and <b>separation</b> <b>sections</b> improves the process design. If process integration is not considered, the separation system is oversized by up to 60 % and its investment cost is up to 46 % too high.
