5|$|Meanwhile, an {{independent}} trader, Cyrano Jones (Stanley Adams), arrives {{on the station}} with some tribbles. He gives one to Lt. Uhura (Nichelle Nichols), who brings it on board the Enterprise, where it and its quickly-produced offspring are treated as adorable pets. The animals purr a relaxing trill that the crew find <b>soothing.</b> Klingons, however, find tribbles annoying, and the feeling is mutual: tribbles hiss and shriek whenever they are near Klingons.|$|E

50|$|In 2004, Alimera Sciences {{introduced}} <b>Soothe</b> Emollient (Lubricant) Eye Drops {{for people}} with dry eyes. <b>Soothe</b> was the first lubricant eye drop to feature Restoryl, a lipid restorative that works to re-establish the lipid (oily) layer of tears, promoting sustained moisture retention. <b>Soothe</b> was a mineral oil in water emulsion developed by Chris Brancewicz (then at Clarkson University) for Ocular Research of Boston during 1996-2001. <b>Soothe</b> was sold to Bausch & Lomb in August 2007.|$|R

5|$|The mid-11th century Gosforth Cross {{located in}} Cumbria, England, has been {{interpreted}} as featuring various figures from Norse mythology. The bottom portion of {{the west side of}} the cross features a depiction of a long-haired female, kneeling figure holding an object above another prostrate, bound figure. Above and to their left is a knotted serpent. This {{has been interpreted}} as Sigyn <b>soothing</b> the bound Loki.|$|E
5|$|The {{shifting}} {{position of}} the Court led to personal animosity between members of its two wings. Despite his disappointment over the Court's positions on some issues, Minton remained popular among his colleagues on the Court as he didn't take sides in their personal disagreements; he proved a <b>soothing</b> presence during a period marked by bitter personal feuds between strong personalities such as William O. Douglas and Felix Frankfurter.|$|E
5|$|Hitachi {{listed the}} Magic Wand for {{business}} {{use with the}} United States Patent and Trademark Office on 25 April 1968. Kabushiki Kaisha Hitachi Seisakusho registered the trademark to the Magic Wand. It became available to the mass market in the U.S. during the 1970s and was advertised as a device to aid with massage techniques. It is effective at relieving pain associated with back aches, and is registered with the Food and Drug Administration as a physical medicine device under the classification therapeutic electric massager. The stated use of the Magic Wand is the <b>soothing</b> and relaxing of sore muscles and nerves, relieving tension, and rehabilitation after sports injuries.|$|E

60|$|When Bremmil was at home, {{which was}} not often, he was more affectionate than usual; and that showed his hand. The affection was forced partly to <b>soothe</b> his own {{conscience}} and partly to <b>soothe</b> Mrs. Bremmil. It failed in both regards.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind," [...] she said, eagerly, [...] "the {{words come}} back to me {{whenever}} I think of the life I have to face, and I want them written; they <b>soothe</b> me, as they <b>soothed</b> that frightened woman and raving man." ...|$|R
5|$|Convinced {{that these}} heavy-handed tactics were {{the source of}} the {{alienation}} of the native population to Soviet rule, in 1921 Moscow appointed an experienced administrator, Alexander Miasnikian, to carry out a more moderate policy and one better attuned to Armenian sensibilities. With the introduction of the New Economic Policy (NEP), Armenians began to enjoy a period of relative stability. Life under the Soviet rule proved to be a <b>soothing</b> balm in contrast to the turbulent final years of the Ottoman Empire. The Armenians received medicine, food, as well as other provisions from the central government and extensive literacy reforms were carried out. The situation was difficult for the Armenian Apostolic Church, however, which became a regular target of criticism in educational books and in the media and struggled greatly under Communism.|$|E
5|$|Rose Beuret and Rodin {{returned}} to Paris in 1877, {{moving into a}} small flat on the Left Bank. Misfortune surrounded Rodin: his mother, who had {{wanted to see her}} son marry, was dead, and his father was blind and senile, cared for by Rodin's sister-in-law, Aunt Thérèse. Rodin's eleven-year-old son Auguste, possibly developmentally delayed, was also in the ever-helpful Thérèse's care. Rodin had essentially abandoned his son for six years, and would have a very limited relationship with him throughout his life. Father and son now joined the couple in their flat, with Rose as caretaker. The charges of fakery surrounding The Age of Bronze continued. Rodin increasingly sought more <b>soothing</b> female companionship in Paris, and Rose stayed in the background.|$|E
5|$|There {{are five}} main plot lines that the player {{will have the}} chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. Throughout gameplay, the player is given {{multiple}} options to choose from, and text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made. To view all plot lines in their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices to further the plot to an alternate direction. After Mai's scenario is completed, a replay of her route will offer an additional choice to play through Sayuri's back-story. Jun Maeda, who worked on the scenario for Kanon, commented in March 2001 that the Japanese public may have fallen under the impression that Key makes <b>soothing</b> games because of Kanons influence, but Maeda affirmed that there was not one person who worked on Kanon who thought that.|$|E

5000|$|... "Musick has charms to <b>soothe</b> {{a savage}} breast," [...] {{which is the}} first line of the play, spoken by Almeria in Act I, Scene I. This is often {{rendered}} as: [...] "Music hath charms to <b>soothe</b> the savage breast" [...] or even savage beast.|$|R
6000|$|LADY: Peace, perturbed heart! [...] 35 I am to thee only as thou to mine, The passing wind which heals {{the brow}} at noon, And may strike cold into the breast at night, Yet cannot linger where it <b>soothes</b> the most, Or long <b>soothe</b> could it linger.|$|R
5|$|Cultural {{attitudes towards}} rain differ across the world. In {{temperate}} climates, {{people tend to}} be more stressed when the weather is unstable or cloudy, with its impact greater on men than women. Rain can also bring joy, as some consider it to be <b>soothing</b> or enjoy the aesthetic appeal of it. In dry places, such as India, or during periods of drought, rain lifts people's moods. In Botswana, the Setswana word for rain, pula, is used as the name of the national currency, in recognition of the economic importance of rain in its country, since it has a desert climate. Several cultures have developed means of dealing with rain and have developed numerous protection devices such as umbrellas and raincoats, and diversion devices such as gutters and storm drains that lead rains to sewers. Many people find the scent during and immediately after rain pleasant or distinctive. The source of this scent is petrichor, an oil produced by plants, then absorbed by rocks and soil, and later released into the air during rainfall.|$|E
5|$|Feeling {{the need}} to seek out truth creates a {{separation}} between {{the mind of a}} poet and the mind of a philosopher. The poem reconciles the two by allowing the pursuer of truth to reflect on his time of simply enjoying nature and God's presence. However, the philosopher aspect is dominant and the individual must {{go out and try to}} help humanity. Nature can be <b>soothing,</b> but the narrator must reject the Edenic quality of nature because such a state is not yet appropriate. The Edenic imagery figures into many of Coleridge's poems and is reinforced with the image of myrtle trees and takes on many forms within his poetry. In Reflections, to dwell in an Edenic state is a paradise in which the narrator leaves voluntarily because he cannot ignore the problems of the world like a coward. Instead, the individual is compelled to join with humanity and even the lowest form of benefiting humanity is superior to doing nothing at all.|$|E
5|$|Finding her mother's body, Buffy {{at first}} denies what she sees, {{to the point}} of imagining {{alternate}} realities. Whedon stated that these mini dream sequences were like documentaries; people who find their loved ones dead are desperate to imagine a different, better outcome, and they create fantasies that cause much more pain when they are forced to return to the harshness of reality. Later in the hospital, Buffy imagines what she {{might have been able to}} do to save Joyce, although the doctor tells her there was nothing to be done. Willow and Xander express anger and helplessness. Anya, new to mortality and human connections, is childlike in her innocence and questions. Xander's anger and Anya's confusion allow them to be mothered somewhat by Willow, who needs to take care of someone. Dawn is deeply in denial, unable to understand that the woman she thought she had known all her life was gone. Tara, who has gone through the ordeal before, represents the acceptance phase, <b>soothing</b> and helping the others to work through what they are experiencing. Buffy toward the end also begins to see acceptance when she tells Dawn that the body in the morgue is not their mother; Joyce is gone.|$|E
60|$|The inhuman clamour <b>soothed</b> {{his ears}} {{in which his}} mother's sobs and reproaches murmured insistently and the dark frail quivering bodies {{wheeling}} and fluttering and swerving round an airy temple of the tenuous sky <b>soothed</b> his eyes which still saw {{the image of his}} mother's face.|$|R

25|$|One of {{the most}} common {{frameworks}} in the emotions field proposes that affective experiences are best characterized by two main dimensions: arousal and valence. The dimension of valence ranges from highly positive to highly negative, whereas the dimension of arousal ranges from calming or <b>soothing</b> to exciting or agitating.|$|E
25|$|Isaac {{composed}} a 6-voice motet Angeli Archangeli for the Feast of All Saint’s Day, honoring angels, archangels, {{and all other}} saints. Another famous motet by Isaac is Optime pastor (Optime divino), written for the accession to the papacy of Medici pope Leo X. This motet compares the Pope to a shepherd capable of <b>soothing</b> all of his flock and binding them together.|$|E
