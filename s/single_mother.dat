40|$|Although {{high school}} dropout rates have been declining among members of {{virtually}} all major demographic groups, the dropout rates of <b>single</b> <b>mothers</b> remain high. This is troubling, given that the author finds {{that over the last}} quarter century <b>single</b> <b>mothers</b> who do not graduate from high school have been more likely to go on welfare than <b>single</b> <b>mothers</b> who do graduate. In fact, <b>single</b> <b>mothers</b> on welfare are {{more than twice as likely}} to be {{high school dropout}}s than are <b>single</b> <b>mothers</b> who are not on welfare.

In our analysis, we make a distinction between native and immigrant welfare recipients.

In both cases we find that the EITC expansions are associated with a relative decline in the unsecured debt of affected households of <b>single</b> <b>mothers.</b> This suggests that <b>single</b> <b>mothers</b> may have used part of their EITC to limit the growth of their unsecured debt during this period. # 1 U 01 AE 000002 - 02 from the U.

40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades Australian {{government}} policy has focused on increasing access to formal childcare but in recent years there has been growing debate about the need to support other forms of childcare. It has been argued that formal care (government regulated care) is insufficiently flexible for today’s labour market. For example, research in the United Kingdom and the United States shows that informal care is particularly important for the employment prospects of <b>single</b> <b>mothers.</b> In Australia cross sectional data from three large sample surveys show that <b>single</b> <b>mothers</b> who use both formal and informal care (mixed care) have stronger labour market attachment than <b>single</b> <b>mothers</b> who use formal care exclusively. Furthermore, this relationship between the type of childcare and the labour force participation of <b>single</b> <b>mothers</b> does not hold for partnered mothers. In this paper we use panel data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey and panel data models to explore the determinants of childcare type choice among <b>single</b> <b>mothers</b> and why <b>single</b> <b>mothers</b> who use mixed care have a stronger labour market attachment than <b>single</b> <b>mothers</b> who only use formal care...|$|R

40|$|Due to the {{preponderance}} of <b>single</b> <b>mothers</b> on public assistance, delinquent child support has been a contentious political issue in the U. S. for over 30 years. We examine whether joint-child-custody reform affects the child- support receipt of <b>single</b> <b>mothers.</b> We use variation in the timing of joint-custody reforms across states to identify the effect of joint custody on the child-support receipt of <b>single</b> <b>mothers.</b> Joint-custody enactment raises the probability of receiving child support for all <b>single</b> <b>mothers</b> by six percent. However, the effect on all <b>single</b> <b>mothers</b> {{is driven by the}} effect on divorced mothers since separated and never-married mothers are unaffected by joint-custody reform.
