5|$|Young Earth creationist Kent Hovind blames communism, socialism, World War I, World War II, racism, the Holocaust, Stalin's war crimes, the Vietnam War, and Pol Pot's Killing Fields on evolution, {{as well as}} the {{increase}} in crime, unwed mothers, and other <b>social</b> <b>ills.</b> Hovind's son Eric Hovind claims that evolution is responsible for tattoos, body piercing, premarital sex, unwed births, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), divorce, and child abuse.|$|E
5|$|Supporters of {{evolution}} dismiss such criticisms as counterfactual, and {{some argue that}} the opposite {{seems to be the}} case. A study published by the author and illustrator Gregory S. Paul found that religious beliefs, including belief in creationism and disbelief in evolution, are positively correlated with <b>social</b> <b>ills</b> like crime. The Barna Group surveys find that Christians and non-Christians in the U.S. have similar divorce rates, and the highest divorce rates in the U.S. are among Baptists and Pentecostals, both sects which reject evolution and embrace creationism.|$|E

5|$|The 1896 {{establishment}} of the Gympie Truth, a newspaper {{that he was to}} partly own, was part of his response. Intended as a medium to broadcast Labour's message, the newspaper played a vital role in Fisher's return to parliament in 1899. This time, he was the beneficiary of a scare campaign, in which conservative candidate Francis Power was consistently painted by the Gympie Truth as being a supporter of black labour and the alleged economic and <b>social</b> <b>ills</b> that accompanied it. In that year he was Secretary for Railways and Public Works in the seven-day government of Anderson Dawson, the first parliamentary Labour government in the world.|$|E
5|$|The tour {{shaped the}} {{political}} ideology of E.V. Ramasamy {{to achieve the}} social concept of Self-Respect. The communist system obtained in Russia appealed to him as appropriately suited {{to deal with the}} <b>social</b> <b>ills</b> of the country. Thus, on socio-economic issues Periyar was Marxist, but he did not advocate for abolishing private ownership. Immediately after his return, E.V. Ramasamy, in alliance with the enthusiastic communist, M. Singaravelar, began to work out a socio-political scheme incorporating socialist and self-respect ideals. This marked a crucial stage of development in the Self-Respect Movement which got politicised and found its compatibility in Tamil Nadu.|$|E

5|$|These {{decisions}} give {{support to}} a current mistaken {{view of the}} Constitution and the constitutional function of this court.

25|$|While many Americans {{suffered}} economically {{during the}} Great Depression, African Americans {{also had to}} deal with <b>social</b> <b>ills,</b> such as racism, discrimination, and segregation. Black workers were especially vulnerable to the economic downturn since most of them worked the most marginal jobs such as unskilled or service-oriented work. Therefore, they were the first to be discharged. Additionally many employers preferred white workers. When jobs were scarce some employers even dismissed blacks to create jobs for whites. In the end there were three times more African American workers on public assistance or relief than white workers.|$|E

40|$|Increasing {{economic}} {{inequality in}} recent years has triggered an outpouring of analysis and reflection on the causes and consequences of these changes. Several commentators have argued that inequality does not merit all the attention it has been receiving noting that the focus on inequality can divert attention from the real problem, which is poverty. This article reviews the arguments for and against this position, highlighting the effects of economic inequality on economic growth and efficiency, politics and democracy, individual behaviors that result in poor health outcomes and social disruption, social cohesion, and environmental degradation. Poverty is, of course, a very important social issue but this review of the arguments about inequality shows that economic inequality in itself is also an important <b>social</b> <b>ill</b> that should be addressed...|$|R
40|$|Fear {{of crime}} is {{widely seen as}} an {{unqualified}} <b>social</b> <b>ill,</b> yet might some level of emotional response comprise a natural defence against crime? Our methodology differentiates between a dysfunctional worry that erodes {{quality of life and}} a functional worry that motivates vigilance and routine precaution. A London-based survey shows that one-quarter of those individuals who said they were worried about crime also viewed their worry as something akin to a problem-solving activity: they took precautions; these precautions that made them feel safer; and neither the precautions nor the worries reduced the quality of their lives. Fear of crime can therefore be helpful as well as harmful: some people are both able and willing to convert their concerns into constructive action...|$|R
50|$|In the UK, {{parallels}} {{have been}} drawn between binge drinking and the Gin Crisis of 18th century England.

In 2003, the cost of binge drinking was estimated as £20 billion a year. In response, the government has introduced measures to deter disorderly behavior and sales of alcohol to people under 18, with special provisions in place during the holiday season. In January 2005, it was reported that one million admissions to UK emergency department units each year are alcohol-related; in many cities, Friday and Saturday nights are by far the busiest periods for ambulance services.|$|R
