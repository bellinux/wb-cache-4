5|$|In the 1990s, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) {{finalized}} {{plans to}} overhaul the station completely. In 1999, the MTA requested $125 million in federal funding for the renovation. As part of renovation, a group of <b>satellite</b> <b>dishes</b> was proposed for the station. By this point, the New York City Transit Police were operating from a tent adjacent to the station, and there were vestiges of a carousel within the station.|$|E
5|$|The {{powerful}} {{winds of}} Typhoon Ioke caused extensive {{damage to the}} island's power grid, leaving most power lines to buildings and backup generators damaged. The combination of the winds and storm surge flooding damaged 70% of the buildings in the territory, many of which with moderate roof damage. All low-lying areas were described as being covered with sea water or sand, and the territory was left without running water. Communications were downed on the island, with <b>satellite</b> <b>dishes</b> and cables destroyed. Damage to the infrastructure was extensive, though repairable and less than expected. Damage on the island was estimated at $88million (2006USD).|$|E
5|$|Across Oman, Phet's {{damage was}} {{estimated}} at over 300million rials (US$780million). Strong winds knocked down billboards, trees, and power lines, causing power outages. Water pipes and desalination plants were also damaged. Storm flooding washed away hundreds of cars, while also damaging roads and bridges. Nationwide, the cyclone wrecked thousands of homes. On the offshore Masirah Island, Phet's storm surge damaged or wrecked some boats, while strong winds damaged tin roofs and <b>satellite</b> <b>dishes.</b> The roof and compound wall of a resort hotel were damaged. Across eastern and northern Oman, heavy rainfall from Phet flooded low-lying areas and produced landslides. The Royal Oman Police helped direct or traffic after many roads were inundated or blocked. The floodwaters entered homes in Al-Ghubra and Al Athaiba, {{as well as the}} Qurum market in Muscat. According to Oman's National Committee for Civil Defence, Phet killed 16people in the country, although the IMD reported the death toll at 24.|$|E

5|$|Hundreds of {{television}} channels, thousands {{of local and}} national radio stations, several dozen newspapers, a productive and profitable national cinema and a rapid growth of broadband Internet use all make up a very vibrant media industry in Turkey. In 2003 a total of 257 television stations and 1,100 radio stations were licensed to operate, and others operated without licenses. Of those licensed, 16 television and 36 radio stations reached national audiences. The majority of the audiences are shared among public broadcaster TRT and the network-style channels such as Kanal D, Show TV, ATV and Star TV. The broadcast media {{have a very high}} penetration as <b>satellite</b> <b>dishes</b> and cable systems are widely available. The Radio and Television Supreme Council (RTÜK) is the government body overseeing the broadcast media. By circulation, the most popular newspapers are Posta, Hürriyet, Sözcü, Sabah and Habertürk.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} {{cockatoo}} can be serious agricultural pests. They are sometimes controlled by shooting, poisoning or capture followed by gassing. Non-lethal damage mitigation methods used include scaring, habitat manipulation {{and the provision}} of decoy food dumps or sacrifice crops to distract them from the main crop. They can be a nuisance in urban areas due to destruction of property. They maintain their bills in the wild by chewing on wood but, in suburbia, they may chew outdoor furniture, door and window frames; soft decorative timbers such as western red cedar are readily demolished. Birds may also target external wiring and fixtures such as solar water heaters, television antennae and <b>satellite</b> <b>dishes.</b> A business in central Melbourne suffered as sulphur-crested cockatoos repeatedly stripped the silicone sealant from the plate glass windows. Galahs and red-tailed black cockatoos have stripped electrical cabling in rural areas and tarpaulin is targeted elsewhere. Outside Australia, the Tanimbar corella is a pest on Yamdena Island where it raids maize crops.|$|E
5|$|Shooting in Venice {{took place}} on August 8. For scenes such as Indiana and Brody {{greeting}} Elsa, shots of the boat chase, and Kazim telling Indiana where his father is, Robert Watts gained control of the Grand Canal from 7 am to 1 pm, sealing off tourists {{for as long as}} possible. Cinematographer Douglas Slocombe positioned the camera to ensure no <b>satellite</b> <b>dishes</b> would be visible. San Barnaba di Venezia served as the library's exterior. The next day, filming moved to the ancient city of Petra, Jordan, where Al Khazneh (The Treasury) stood in for the temple housing the Grail. The cast and crew became guests of King Hussein and Queen Noor. The Treasury had previously appeared in Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger. The main cast completed their scenes that week, after 63 days of filming.|$|E

He developed his HC series microphones, intended for amateur radio communication. Heil Sound was also an early installer of large <b>satellite</b> <b>dishes</b> for radio.|$|E

25|$|Beginning in the 1920s, {{broadcast}} {{television was}} delivered for free over local frequencies. When the industry began charging viewers {{for access to}} its services via cable, free broadcasts continued. Starting in the 1970s, a small community of satellite television enthusiasts (mostly engineers) shared the technology and knowledge on how to construct <b>satellite</b> <b>dishes,</b> {{as well as how}} to access pay television from the airwaves for free. This was not illegal at the time, and restaurant and hotel chains made use of this technology to distribute programming to guests and patrons without charge.|$|E
