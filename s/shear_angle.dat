5000|$|The machine used {{is called}} a {{squaring}} shear, power shear, or guillotine. The machine may be foot powered, less commonly hand powered, or mechanically or hydraulically powered. It works by first clamping the material with a ram. A moving blade then comes down across a fixed blade to shear the material. For larger shears the moving blade may be set on an angle or [...] "rocked" [...] in order to shear the material progressively {{from one side to}} the other; this angle is referred to as the <b>shear</b> <b>angle.</b> Setting the blade on an angle decreases the amount of force required, but increases the stroke. A 5 degree <b>shear</b> <b>angle</b> decreases the force by about 20%. The amount of energy used is still the same. The moving blade may also be inclined 0.5 to 2.5°, called the rake angle, to keep the material from becoming wedged between the blades. However, raking the blade compromises the squareness of the edge. The machine consists of a shear table, work-holding device, upper and lower blades, and a gauging device. The shear table is the part of the machinery that the workpiece rests on while being sheared. The work-holding device is used to hold the workpiece in place and keep it from moving or buckling while under stress. The upper and lower blades are the piece of machinery that actually do the cutting, while the gauging device is used to ensure that the workpiece is being cut where it is supposed to be.|$|E

The evolution of the two shear angles is then tracked over a small region located over the sheared penumbra of the delta sunspot in NOAA 10930.

30|$|A {{simplified}} {{analytical model}} of forces during <b>shearing</b> with <b>angled</b> tools {{was developed by}} Atkins (1990) in guillotining of copper plates. In that model, the force can be computed provided the materials shear yield stress, work hardening index, and fracture toughness in the plane of cut are known. The latter two parameters are, however, often not so readily available as the yield stress. Therefore, in this paper, a simple model is developed, {{based on the assumption}} of plane strain, in which the forces in <b>shearing</b> with <b>angled</b> tools are calculated from forces measured with parallel tools. The main purpose of this work is to compare the forces predicted by the model, with forces measured with inclined tools. Forces were accurately measured, both with parallel and angled tools, using an experimental set-up with a high stiffness and a stable tool clearance providing reliable reproducible results, as previously demonstrated by Gustafsson et al.

If the model can predict the forces in <b>shearing</b> with <b>angled</b> tools, this implies that a 2 D plane strain FE analysis is applicable to obtain forces in <b>shearing</b> with <b>angled</b> tools.
