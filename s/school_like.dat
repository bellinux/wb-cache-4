40|$|We {{examined}} the relations among children’s effortful control, <b>school</b> <b>liking,</b> and academic competence {{with a sample}} of 240 7 - to 12 -year-old children. Parents and children reported on effortful control, and teachers and children assessed <b>school</b> <b>liking.</b> Children, parents, and teachers reported on children’s academic competence. Significant positive correlations existed between children’s effortful control, <b>school</b> <b>liking,</b> and academic competence. Consistent with predictions, and while controlling for the effects of parents’ education and family income, <b>school</b> <b>liking</b> mediated the relation between effortful control and academic competence. Implications include a focus on proximal processes such as enhancing <b>school</b> <b>liking</b> and encouraging social relationships when designing interventions to promote academic competence...|$|R
40|$|Findings {{about the}} {{association}} between academic performance and <b>school</b> <b>liking</b> have been inconsistent, indicating that this association may depend on other factors. Because of this, {{it is important to}} try and identify factors that can moderate this association. Under which conditions do adolescents with learning difficulties still <b>like</b> <b>school,</b> or under which conditions do they dislike school the most? The current study examines the relationship between learning difficulties and the general <b>liking</b> of <b>school,</b> as well as potential moderators of this association: self-esteem among peers and the perception of class climate. The current study uses the data of a Finnish study, consisting of 11, 365 adolescents averaging 14. 75 year of age. The effects of learning difficulties on <b>school</b> <b>liking</b> were researched, as well as the interaction effects of self-esteem and perception of classroom climate. This analysis showed that learning difficulties are a negative predictor of <b>school</b> <b>liking.</b> However, the negative effects of learning difficulties on <b>school</b> <b>liking</b> are significantly moderated by self-esteem among peers. Adolescents with high self-esteem have higher <b>school</b> <b>liking</b> than adolescents with low self-esteem. Both groups <b>like</b> <b>school</b> less when encountering learning difficulties, but the drop in <b>school</b> <b>liking</b> is significantly greater for adolescents with high self-esteem. Additionally, a more positive perception of class climate does moderate the negative effects of learning difficulties on <b>school</b> <b>liking.</b> Adolescents with a more positive perception of their classroom climate have higher <b>school</b> <b>liking</b> and experience a significantly smaller drop in <b>school</b> <b>liking</b> when they encounter learning difficulties...|$|R
40|$|As {{children}} enter kindergarten, {{the degree}} to which they <b>like</b> <b>school</b> may be an important determinant of their classroom participation, which in turn may impact their achievement. To explore this premise, data were gathered on <b>school</b> <b>liking,</b> classroom participation, and achievement with a sample of 200 children (M age = 5. 58) as they entered and completed kindergarten. Greater support was found for the premise that <b>school</b> <b>liking</b> fosters classroom participation and achievement than for the contention that early participation and achievement increases <b>school</b> <b>liking</b> or identification. Also supported was the premise that children’s early academic progress stems from affective processes (e. g., <b>liking</b> <b>school)</b> that are distinct from many other entry factors (e. g., family backgrounds, formative experiences, child’s readiness, etc.) ...|$|R
