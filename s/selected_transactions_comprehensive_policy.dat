40|$|Power system {{operation}} with multiple energy transactions poses {{one of the}} challenges to the new competitive open-access power market environment. In this paper both individual and group transactions are assumed to exist in a power market. Transmission dispatch methodology for transaction requests to ensure feasibility and assessment of transfer capability of the transmission network to accommodate additional power transfers for <b>selected</b> <b>transactions</b> are developed. A transmission dispatch methodology is proposed to curtail requested transactions to ensure that there is no operating constraint violation. The transfer capability problem is thus formulated as an optimum power flow (OPF) problem where the objective is to assess the transfer capability for a set of <b>selected</b> <b>transactions.</b> The methodology is applied to a sample power network to verify its validity.
