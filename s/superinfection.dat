5|$|More recent investigations, mainly {{based on}} {{original}} medical {{reports from the}} period of the pandemic, found that the viral infection itself was not more aggressive than any previous influenza, but that the special circumstances (malnourishment, overcrowded medical camps and hospitals, poor hygiene) promoted bacterial <b>superinfection</b> that killed most of the victims typically after a somewhat prolonged death bed.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1980s, the {{prognosis}} or expected outcome of DPB was poor, especially in cases with <b>superinfection</b> (the {{emergence of a}} new viral or bacterial infection, in addition to the currently occurring infection) by P.aeruginosa. DPB continued to have a very high mortality rate before generalized antibiotic treatment and oxygen therapy were beginning to be used routinely in the effort to manage symptoms. Around 1985, when long-term treatment with the antibiotic erythromycin became the standard for managing DPB, {{the prognosis}} significantly improved. In 1990, the association of DPB with HLA was initially asserted.|$|E
5|$|HIV is {{transmitted}} by three main routes: sexual contact, significant exposure to infected body fluids or tissues, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding (known as vertical transmission). There is no risk of acquiring HIV if exposed to feces, nasal secretions, saliva, sputum, sweat, tears, urine, or vomit unless these are contaminated with blood. It {{is possible to}} be co-infected {{by more than one}} strain of HIV—a condition known as HIV <b>superinfection.</b>|$|E

40|$|Viral infections of {{the upper}} {{respiratory}} tract {{are associated with a}} variety of invasive diseases caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, the group A streptococcus, including pneumonia, necrotizing fasciitis, toxic shock syndrome, and bacteremia. While these polymicrobial infections, or <b>superinfections,</b> are complex, {{progress has been made in}} understanding the molecular basis of disease. Areas of investigation have included the characterization of virus-induced changes in innate immunity, differences in bacterial adherence and internalization following viral infection, and the efficacy of vaccines in mitigating the morbidity and mortality of <b>superinfections.</b> Here, we briefly summarize viral-S. pyogenes <b>superinfections</b> with an emphasis on those affiliated with influenza viruses...|$|R
40|$|Transmission {{of human}} {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) is no exception to the phenomenon that a second, productive infection with another strain of the same virus is feasible. Experiments with RNA viruses have suggested that both coinfections (simultaneous infection with two strains of a virus) and <b>superinfections</b> (second infection after a specific immune response to the first infecting strain has developed) can result in increased fitness of the viral population. Concerns about dual infections with HIV are increasing. First, the frequent detection of <b>superinfections</b> {{seems to indicate that}} {{it will be difficult to}} develop a prophylactic vaccine. Second, HIV- 1 <b>superinfections</b> have been associated with accelerated disease progression, although this is not true for all persons. In fact, <b>superinfections</b> have even been detected in persons controlling their HIV infections without antiretroviral therapy. Third, dual infections can give rise to recombinant viruses, which are increasingly found in the HIV- 1 epidemic. Recombinants could have increased fitness over the parental strains, as in vitro models suggest, and could exhibit increased pathogenicity. Multiple drug resistant (MDR) strains could recombine to produce a pan-resistant, transmittable virus...|$|R

25|$|Prognosis {{is highly}} variable. Spontaneous {{remission}} is common. Complete cure {{can be obtained}} with proper antibiotic treatments to kill the causative bacteria, such as tetracycline, doxycycline, or erythromycin. Prognosis is more favorable with early treatment. Bacterial <b>superinfections</b> may complicate course. Death can occur from bowel obstruction or perforation, and follicular conjunctivitis due to autoinoculation of infectious discharge can occur.|$|R
25|$|Rare {{adverse effects}} (<0.1% of patients) include: anaphylaxis, toxic {{epidermal}} necrolysis, erythema multiforme, red man syndrome, <b>superinfection,</b> thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, leukopenia, tinnitus, dizziness and/or ototoxicity, and DRESS syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Common adverse drug {{reactions}} (ADRs) (≥ 1% of patients) {{associated with}} the cephalosporin therapy include: diarrhea, nausea, rash, electrolyte disturbances, and pain and inflammation at injection site. Infrequent ADRs (0.1–1% of patients) include vomiting, headache, dizziness, oral and vaginal candidiasis, pseudomembranous colitis, <b>superinfection,</b> eosinophilia, nephrotoxicity, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and fever.|$|E
25|$|Most {{patients}} who acquire hepatitis D {{at the same}} time as hepatitis B (co-infection) recover without developing a chronic infection; however, in people with hepatitis B who later acquire hepatitis D (<b>superinfection),</b> chronic infection is much more common at 80-90%, and liver disease progression is accelerated.|$|E
30|$|Three studies {{provide the}} rate of <b>superinfections.</b> One was lower in PCT-guided arm: 7 / 31 (22.5 %) vs. 11 / 37 (29.7 %) [41]. The other two {{were higher in the}} PCT group: 7 / 51 (13.7 %) vs. 6 / 50 (12 %) [45] and 106 / 307 (34.5 %) vs. 97 / 314 (30.9 %) [42].|$|R
40|$|B. fragilis, an {{anaerobic}} normal inhabitant of {{the intestinal}} tract, is recovered from about 5 % of bacteriologically proved bacteremias. Its high resistance to beta lactam antibiotics and to aminoglycosides accounts for its increasing importance in infectious diseases, particularly {{in patients with}} altered host defenses; in these subjects, B. fragilis may cause deadly <b>superinfections.</b> SCOPUS: NotDefined. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

25|$|The {{hepatitis}} D virus {{requires that}} a person first be infected with hepatitis B virus, so prevention efforts should focus on limiting the spread of hepatitis B. In people who have chronic hepatitis B infection and {{are at risk for}} <b>superinfection</b> with the hepatitis D virus, the preventive strategies are the same as for hepatitis B.|$|E
25|$|Sex {{may also}} be derived from another prokaryotic process. A {{comprehensive}} 'origin of sex as vaccination' theory proposes that eukaryan sex-as-syngamy (fusion sex) arose from prokaryan unilateral sex-as-infection when infected hosts began swapping nuclearised genomes containing coevolved, vertically transmitted symbionts that provided protection against horizontal <b>superinfection</b> by more virulent symbionts. Sex-as-meiosis (fission sex) then evolved as a host strategy to uncouple (and thereby emasculate) the acquired symbiont genomes.|$|E
25|$|Common adverse drug {{reactions}} {{associated with}} the use of flucloxacillin include: diarrhoea, nausea, rash, urticaria, pain and inflammation at injection site, <b>superinfection</b> (including candidiasis), allergy, and transient increases in liver enzymes and bilirubin. Rarely, cholestatic jaundice (also referred to as cholestatic hepatitis) has been associated with flucloxacillin therapy. The reaction may occur up to several weeks after treatment has stopped, and takes weeks to resolve. The estimated incidence is one in 15,000 exposures, and is more frequent in people >55 years, females, and those with treatment longer than two weeks.|$|E
40|$|<b>Superinfections</b> from Staphylococcus aureus {{following}} influenza are {{an increasing}} concern. We assessed several laboratory and clinical strains in a mouse coinfection model with influenza virus. A methicillin-resistant USA 300 clone and several recent clinical strains from patients with necrotizing pneumonia caused high mortality following influenza virus infection in mice. Both viral and bacterial lung titers were enhanced during coinfections compared with single infections. However, differences in titers did not correspond with differences in disease outcomes in {{a comparison of}} <b>superinfections</b> from a highly pathogenic strain with those from a poorly pathogenic strain. These strains did differ, however, in expression of Panton-Valentine leukocidin and {{in the degree of}} inflammatory lung damage each engendered. The viral cytotoxin PB 1 -F 2 contributed to the negative outcomes. These data suggest that additional study of specific bacterial virulence factors involved in the pathogenesis of inflammation and lung damage during coinfections is needed...|$|R
40|$|Severe {{influenza}} virus infections with pneumonic involvement {{are known to}} predispose the lungs to bacterial <b>superinfections</b> due to dysfunctions in the alveolar macrophage (AM) phagocytic system. To determine whether milder forms of influenza without pneumonic involvement have a similar outcome, pulmonary antibacterial defenses and AM phagocytosis were compared in murine models of mild and severe {{influenza virus}} A/HK/ 68 infections. Bactericidal activity was quantitated by the intrapulmonary killing of Staphylococcus aureus following aerosol challenge, whereas the functional capacity of the AMs was determined by Fc-receptor-mediated phagocytosis. With the severe virus infection, maximal suppression of bactericidal activity occurred on day 8 of infection and correlated with impairment of AM phagocytosis. A lesser but significant degree of suppression of pulmonary antibacterial defenses and AM phagocytosis was observed {{on the third day}} of the mild virus infection. The data demonstrate that mild influenza virus infections that are limited to the upper respiratory tract also impair pulmonary antibacterial defenses and may predispose the lungs to bacterial <b>superinfections...</b>|$|R
30|$|We {{also found}} a high {{prevalence}} of mixed bacterial-fungal corneal infections, representing 24 of 63 cases (38  %). This is {{significantly higher than the}} prevalence of bacterial-fungal infections reported in the Northeastern USA (11 / 61, 18  %) [8]. This increased rate of polymicrobial infections may reflect the high number of patients with prior PKP in our series as these patients were likely more susceptible to <b>superinfections.</b>|$|R
25|$|Since RNA {{proofreading}} enzymes are absent, the RNA-dependent RNA transcriptase makes {{a single}} nucleotide insertion error roughly every 10 thousand nucleotides, {{which is the}} approximate length of the influenza vRNA. Hence, nearly every newly manufactured influenza virus will contain a mutation in its genome. The separation of the genome into eight separate segments of vRNA allows mixing (reassortment) of the genes if more than one variety of influenza virus has infected the same cell (<b>superinfection).</b> The resulting alteration in the genome segments packaged into viral progeny confers new behavior, sometimes the ability to infect new host species or to overcome protective immunity of host populations to its old genome (in which case it is called an antigenic shift).|$|E
50|$|People with HIV risk <b>superinfection</b> by {{the same}} actions that would place a non-infected person at risk of {{acquiring}} HIV. These include sharing needles and forgoing condoms with HIV-positive sexual partners. For many years <b>superinfection</b> was thought to occur mainly in high-risk populations. Research from Uganda published in 2012 indicates that HIV <b>superinfection</b> among HIV-infected individuals within a general population remains unknown. Further research from The Journal of Infectious Diseases indicates {{that there have been}} 16 documented cases of <b>superinfection</b> since 2002.|$|E

40|$|Serological {{studies of}} persons {{infected}} with yellow fever (YF) during the 1970 epidemic in Okwoga District, Nigeria, indicated that epidemic YF occurred despite a high prevalence of pre-existing group B arbovirus immunity, which increased with age. The viruses involved were primarily dengue, Zika, and Wesselsbron. Patterns of responses of haemagglutination-inhibiting, complement-fixing, and neutralizing antibodies in primary YF and in <b>superinfections</b> are defined in this paper...|$|R
40|$|A {{clinical}} trial {{was designed to}} evaluate the efficacy and safety of cefotaxime, a new semisynthetic, broad-spectrum cephalosporin, in the therapy of community-and hospital-acquired pneumonias. Thirty-nine males (mean age, 65 years) were treated for 41 episodes of pneumonia. Only five patient {{did not have a}} serious underlying disease; 15 had two or more significant disorders. Sixty-six percent of these pneumonias were due to Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae. The minimal inhibitory concentrations for all bacterial isolates ranged from 0. 008 to 4 micrograms/ml. Peak serum cefotaxime levels during therapy ranged from 12 to 124 micrograms/ml 1 h after a 1 -g dose. Satisfactory bacteriological and clinical responses were observed in 85 % of the cases. Four episodes of pulmonary <b>superinfections</b> due to cefotaxime-resistant gram-negative bacilli were noted, each in a patient being mechanically ventilated. Pseudomonas was involved in each of these <b>superinfections,</b> and three were fatal. No serious toxicity or adverse reaction to cefotaxime was seen. The {{results of this study suggest}} that cefotaxime is an affective and well-tolerated new cephalosporin antimicrobial agent for the therapy of pneumonia due to susceptible organisms...|$|R
50|$|Because M. ulcerans {{infection}} {{is associated with}} nonspecific clinical manifestations and indolent course, {{it is important to}} consider every nodule or ulcer in an endemic area as a suspected M. ulcerans infection until proven otherwise. A nodule is firm and painless. In the absence of <b>superinfection(s)</b> an ulcer is painless or minimally painful, has the characteristic undermined edge and a whitish-yellow necrotic base. Previous residence in an endemic area should raise the suspicion of M. ulcerans infection.|$|R
