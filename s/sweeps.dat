40|$|The {{relationship}} between juvenile and final stem <b>sweep</b> {{is used to}} aid selection of final-crop trees at time of thinning, and measurement of juvenile <b>sweep</b> at final pruning (approximately age 6 to 8 years) provides the information with which to predict <b>sweep</b> in the final-crop stems ofPinus radiata D. Don stands. <b>Sweep</b> in the pruned butt log, in conjunction with log diameter, length, and taper, affects the level of conversion to sawn timber, and hence, {{the value of a}} log. Pith <b>sweep,</b> as a surrogate for juvenile <b>sweep,</b> and final-stem <b>sweep</b> data calculated from cross-sectional analyses or sawing studies of 815 pruned logs, were used to improve the stand average and individual log <b>sweep</b> predictions made in the stand modelling system STANDPAK. The following juvenile / final <b>sweep</b> model was fitted using regression analysis: SF=aSP-b(AGE- 28) where: SF is final <b>sweep</b> (mm/m) Sp is pith <b>sweep</b> (mm/m) AGE is time from juvenile <b>sweep</b> measurement to final harvest (years) a, b are regression coefficients. Validation by residual analysis indicated the model slightly under-predicted final <b>sweep</b> and the error in predicting final <b>sweep</b> could be expected to fall within + 5 mm/m. Comparison of the fit of several distribution models to study data, by comparing chi-squared goodness-of-fit deviances, identified the lognormal distribution as a reliable predictor of individual log final <b>sweep.</b> Validation using an independent data set from six sites indicated the error in predicting percentage frequency of logs in individual log classes could be expected to fall within ± 20 %. An important limitation of this study was the use of pith <b>sweep</b> as a surrogate for juvenile <b>sweep...</b>|$|R

5|$|It {{was seen}} in Figure2 that Foucault placed the {{rotating}} mirror R {{as close as possible}} to lens L so as to maximize the distance between R and the slit S. As R rotates, an enlarged image of slit S <b>sweeps</b> across the face of the distant mirror M. The greater the distance RM, the more quickly that the image <b>sweeps</b> across mirror M and the less light is reflected back. Foucault could not increase the RM distance in his folded optical arrangement beyond about 20meters without the image of the slit becoming too dim to accurately measure.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Varieties {{diversity}} {{have been}} known to reduce disease incidence on rice. Our research evaluated the impact of four varieties planted with intercropping in reducing population green leaf hopper Nephotettix virescens and incidence of rice white stem borer Scirpophaga innotata in Sulawesi Indonesia. The optimum population average of green leaf hopper catch by <b>sweep</b> net on Pulut putih, Lapang, Fatmawati, Ciliwung varieties planted with strip intercropping in Sidrap plantation was respectively 4. 3 adults/ 5 <b>sweep</b> net, 6. 0 adults/ 5 <b>sweep</b> net. 6. 7 adults/ 5 <b>sweep</b> net and 10. 0 adults/ 5 <b>sweep</b> net, while with monoculture was respectively 2. 5 adults/ 5 <b>sweep</b> net, 2. 7 adults/ 5 <b>sweep</b> net, 2. 6 adults/ 5 <b>sweep</b> net, and 3. 5 adults/ 5 <b>sweep</b> net.

40|$|Searching {{a network}} for an {{intruder}} {{is an interesting}} and difficult problem. Sweeping is one such search model, in which we "sweep" for intruders along edges. The minimum number of sweepers needed to clear a graph G {{is known as the}} <b>sweep</b> number sw(G). The <b>sweep</b> number can be restricted by insisting the <b>sweep</b> be monotonic (once an edge is cleared, it must stay cleared) and connected (new clear edges must be incident with already cleared edges). We will examine several lower bounds for <b>sweep</b> number, among them minimum degree, clique number, chromatic number, and girth. We will make use of several of these bounds to calculate <b>sweep</b> numbers for several infinite families of graphs. In particular, these families will answer some open problems regarding the relationships between the monotonic <b>sweep</b> number, connected <b>sweep</b> number, and monotonic connected <b>sweep</b> number. While sweeping originated in simple graphs, the idea may be easily extended to directed graphs, which allow for four different <b>sweep</b> models. We will examine some interesting non-intuitive <b>sweep</b> numbers and look at relations between these models. We also look at bounds on these <b>sweep</b> numbers on digraphs and tournaments...|$|R

5|$|More {{effective}} tactics {{had to be}} used {{if there}} were to be no greater resources for the Command. Two major changes adopted by Coastal Command were <b>sweeps</b> over convoy routes and <b>sweeps</b> against U-boat transit routes. According to German and Italian submarine logs, both were effective and denied them the chance of shadowing convoys on the surface. It also rapidly increased the chances of a kill. The transit tactic over the Bay of Biscay resulted in many air-to-air and air-to-submarine combats, reaching its peak in 1943. As it was, in 1940 the Command was credited with just two sinkings with Navy vessels, one sunk unaided, and two damaged. The damaged ships could have been sunk had proper weapons been available.|$|E
5|$|On 19 August, Göring {{read the}} {{reports on the}} losses of 18 August, and unhappy with {{the extent of the}} losses, {{recalled}} both pilots. Hitler's Directive 17 had ordered the Luftwaffe to achieve air superiority, but remain strong enough for when, or rather if, Sea Lion was launched. Moreover, Göring recognised that the Luftwaffe was his power base. A failure would be damaging, but a severe weakening of the Luftwaffe would be far worse. He emphasised to his commanders the need to preserve the Luftwaffe's strength. Essentially, the core theme of the conference was fighter protection. The fighter leaders advocated <b>sweeps</b> to clear the skies in advance of attacks. Other commanders present thought a combination of <b>sweeps</b> and close escort would be more effective in reducing losses. Göring agreed and listed a number of forms that the <b>sweeps</b> could take. The most important tactical change he made was instituting a wholesale purge of older Geschwaderkommodore in favour of younger men. From now on, leaders were to be drawn from the ranks, given responsibility based on skill and experience rather than rank, while allowing them to have a free rein in tactical engagements (a form of aerial Auftragstaktik).|$|E

50|$|The {{algorithm}} maintains both a <b>sweep</b> {{line and}} a beach line, which both move through the plane as the algorithm progresses. The <b>sweep</b> line is a straight line, which we may by convention assume to be vertical and moving left to right across the plane. At {{any time during the}} algorithm, the input points left of the <b>sweep</b> line will have been incorporated into the Voronoi diagram, while the points right of the <b>sweep</b> line will not have been considered yet. The beach line is not a straight line, but a complicated, piecewise curve {{to the left of the}} <b>sweep</b> line, composed of pieces of parabolas; it divides the portion of the plane within which the Voronoi diagram can be known, regardless of what other points might be right of the <b>sweep</b> line, from the rest of the plane. For each point left of the <b>sweep</b> line, one can define a parabola of points equidistant from that point and from the <b>sweep</b> line; the beach line is the boundary of the union of these parabolas. As the <b>sweep</b> line progresses, the vertices of the beach line, at which two parabolas cross, trace out the edges of the Voronoi diagram. The beach line progresses by keeping each parabola base exactly half way between the points initially swept over with the <b>sweep</b> line, and the new position of the <b>sweep</b> line. Mathematically, this means each parabola is formed by using the <b>sweep</b> line as the directrix and the input point as the focus.|$|R
