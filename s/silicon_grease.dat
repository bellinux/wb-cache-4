5000|$|The RS {{represented}} {{the pinnacle of}} Nikon's commitment to underwater imaging, and generated significant interest at the time. Although groundbreaking in many ways, it was also very expensive, putting it {{out of reach of}} all but the most dedicated (or best funded) underwater photographers. Unfortunately, early versions also had a tendency to flood if not maintained perfectly. Flooding was attributed to many factors, one of which was the change to orange-colored silicone o-rings that could swell and fail if third-party silicone grease was applied instead of the Nikonos grease that was petroleum-based. (Non-Nikon (third party) <b>silicon</b> <b>grease</b> was commonly used without problems on black Nikonos o-rings by underwater photographers for several decades.) Nikon replaced all these floods at first, but in the end, it clearly became not worth the trouble. The RS was quietly discontinued about 5 years later, and no subsequent models were ever designed or manufactured.|$|E
50|$|A classic sucrose gap {{technique}} is typically {{set up with}} three chambers that each contain {{a segment of the}} neuron or cells that are being studied. The test chamber contains a physiological solution, such as Krebs or Ringer's solution, which mimics the ion concentration and osmotic pressure of the cell's natural environment. Test drugs can also be added to this chamber to study the effect that they have on cellular function. Ag-AgCl or platinum wire electrodes are generally used for stimulating the cells in the test solution. The sucrose chamber (or gap) is the middle chamber that separates the two other chambers, or sections of the nerve fiber or cells. This chamber contains an isotonic sucrose solution of a high specific resistance. Specific resistance describes the ability of a material or solution to oppose electric current, so a sucrose solution of a high specific resistance is effective in electrically isolating the three chambers. The third chamber usually contains a KCl solution that mimics the intracellular solution. The high potassium concentration in this chamber depolarizes the immersed segment of the tissue, allowing potential differences to be measured between the two segments separated by the sucrose gap. Vaseline, <b>silicon</b> <b>grease,</b> or a silicon-vaseline mixture is used to seal the nerve or tissue in position and prevent diffusion of solution between the chambers. A pair of agar-bridged Ag-AgCl electrodes are placed in the test and KCl chambers to record the changes in membrane potential.|$|E
40|$|A {{carbon fibre}} {{reinforced}} plastic (CFRP) adhesively bonded single lap joint sample is used for comparing the detection of different defect types using pulsed phase thermography (PPT). Firstly, a polytetrafluoroethene (PTFE) insert, of the type widely used to simulate defects in composite materials, {{was added to the}} bond line of the joint. Liquid layer kissing defects were simulated using <b>silicon</b> <b>grease.</b> PPT clearly identified the PTFE but not the <b>silicon</b> <b>grease</b> contamination. The PPT identified the <b>silicon</b> <b>grease</b> defect when the joint was loaded. It is postulated that kissing defects can be detected using thermography if a small load is applied to the joint, as loading opens the defect and produces a gap that provides sufficient thermal contrast for detection. Thermoelastic stress analysis (TSA) is used to validate the approach. On-site application is addressed both in terms of the load application and the use of low cost infrared (IR) detectors...|$|E

40|$|Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) is a {{technique}} that used for quantitative elemental analysis of various samples in different forms. In this technique, a laser light {{is focused on the}} surface of sample yielding a plasma just above the sample surface that used for analytical source. Nowadays, rapid powder analysis in tiny amount (mg) has been carried out using plasma induced by high power laser of  Nd:YAG (Neodymium-doped Yttrium Aluminium Garnet) at atmospheric pressure. However, powder analysis using high power laser is still difficult to be carried out  due to blow of powder when irradiated laser beam focused on a powder sample. In general, the powder must be transformed into pellet form prior to analysis. Pellet sample requires a lot of powder and it takes time for preparation. In this study, we developed {{a technique}} of powder sample with its size about  30 µm (± 5 mg) that mixed with <b>silicon</b> <b>grease</b> (± 5 mg) that act as a binder.

Nowadays recent developments in bridge design and increasing traffic conditions have posed more severe requirements on wear life and load carrying capacity that are no longer matched by PTFE. Therefore a special sliding material, Xlide®, has been developed and proposed to replace PTFE in bridge bearings. The tests carried out on the special material show that lubricated with <b>silicon</b> <b>grease</b> Xlide® can support larger pressure levels and sustain longer accumulated sliding paths than PTFE does, and has a low coefficient of friction even at very low temperatures, out of the range of application of PTFE.

40|$|A {{robust and}} {{reliable}} method for {{the identification of}} defects in adhesively bonded joints used in the membrane containment system used to store liquefied natural gas during transport on board ships is required. The adhesively bonded interface of the membrane system may contain low volume defects known as kissing defects, which are extremely difficult to detect using portable inspection techniques. A novel methodology for detecting such defects is described in the paper. To demonstrate the approach simulated kissing defects were produced in a controlled fashion in a representative secondary membrane bond using <b>silicon</b> <b>grease</b> contamination. The defects were detected using an active thermographic approach known as pulsed phase thermography (PPT) which detects subsurface defects by monitoring the effect they have on the propagation of heat through a component. Due to the low volume of kissing defects, they generally have minimal effect on the heat propagation, so the detection {{was made possible by}} application of a small load generated by application of a vacuum. The vacuum can be set-up using a reusable chamber and a standard vacuum pump and therefore is portable and can be applied on-site and in a shipyard during construction. <br/...|$|E
40|$|We {{developed}} a dilatometer {{to investigate the}} specific volume of polymers {{as a function of}} pressure (to 100 MPa), temperature (to 260 oC), cooling rate (to 80 C/s), and shear rate (to 77 1 /s). The dilatometeris based on the principle of con¯ned compression and comprises of a pressure cell used in combination with a tensile testing machine with rotation capability. The design of the pressure cell is a mixture of atraditional 'piston-die type' dilatometer and a Couette rheometer, i. e. piston and die make up an annular shaped sample spacing. Typical dimensions of annular samples are: inner radius ri = 10. 5 mm, outerradius ro = 11. 0 mm, height h = 2. 5 mm, and a typical mass of about 60 - 70 mg. <b>Silicon</b> <b>grease</b> is used to reduce loss of hydrostatic pressure in the sample due to friction occurring between the solidifying sampleand dilatometer wall. Specific volume measurements at low cooling rate using an isotactic polypropylene (i-PP) are compared with measurements performed using a commercial bellows type dilatometer, showing relative di®erences in the range of 0. 1 - 0. 4 %. Finally, results for an isotactic polypropylene are presented showing a profound influence of cooling rate and melt shearing on the evolution of specific volume...|$|E
40|$|A {{detector}} {{based on}} a pixellated scintillator crystal coupled on two opposite sides to Silicon Photomultiplier (SiPM) strips is presented. In one direction {{the width of the}} SiPM strips matches the crystal pitch, while in the other direction the strip length is equal to the crystal pitch times the number of pixels in a row. The SiPM strips on one side are orthogonal to the strips on the other side. The crystal position can be identified using a row-column coding method. As a proof of concept, a small prototype using an array of 8 × 8 LYSO crystals, each one 1. 5 mm × 1. 5 mm × 10 mm in dimensions, has been built. The crystal is coupled on both sides to monolithic matrices composed of 8 SiPM strips, each one 1. 5 mm wide (pitch) and 12 mm long by means of <b>silicon</b> <b>grease.</b> SiPMs strips have been obtained connecting in parallel single pixels belonging to a monolithic matrix, where each pixel has the same pitch of the scintillating crystal coupled to it. This arrangement allows a reduction from N 2 to 2 N of the number of analog channels needed to read-out the entire crystal array. Furthermore, this method provides the information about the Depth of Interaction of the primary particles impinging on the detector. The results of the prototype characterization in terms of energy and Depth Of Interaction resolution capabilities are presented here. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd and Sissa Medialab srl...|$|E
40|$|High {{pressure}} X-ray crystallography is {{an effective}} tool for studying the behaviour of systems in the solid state. It is becoming an increasingly popular technique and offers a way to determine and monitor the behaviour of systems, which in some cases is necessary in order for those particular materials {{to be used in}} real-world applications. This thesis explores the use of high pressure X-ray crystallography to understand the behaviour of systems such as metal-organic frameworks (Chapters 4 and 5) and the coordination complexes, [1, 4 -C 6 H 4 PPh 2 (AuCl) 2](Chapter 6) and chloro(4 -ethoxycarbonyl- 6 -phenyl- 2, 2 ′-bipyridyl) platinum (Chapter 7). It also describes hydrostatic limit determinations carried out on 4 : 1 MeOH/EtOH with additional additives such as <b>silicon</b> <b>grease</b> and/or crystals of [PdCl 2 ([9]aneS 2 O) ] to see how the hydrostatic limit might be manipulated by the use of these additives. It has been possible to determine the hydrostatic limit of a possible pressure-transmitting medium, namely RS 3000, which showed an increased pressure limit when compared to the hydrostatic limits for other similar media. This thesis therefore covers a wide range of studieshighlighting some of the diversity that this fieldoffers. To betterunderstand the behaviour of the systems studied, several ancillary techniques have been employed including Hirshfeld surface analysis, Raman spectroscopy, UV/visible spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. In all cases these techniques provided useful information which complemented the results of the high pressure X-ray crystallographic studies...|$|E
40|$|To {{examine the}} {{transmission}} of herpes simplex virus (HSV) from axon to epidermal cell, an in vitro model was constructed consisting of human fetal dorsal root ganglia cultured in the central chamber of a dual-chamber tissue culture system separated from autologous skin explants in an exterior chamber by concentric steel cylinders adhering to the substratum through <b>silicon</b> <b>grease</b> and agarose. Axons grew through the agarose viral diffusion barrier and terminated on epidermal cells in the exterior chamber. After inoculation of HSV onto dorsal root ganglia, anterograde axonal transport of glycoprotein and nucleocapsid antigen was observed by confocal microscopy to appear in exterior chamber axons within 12 h and in epidermal cells within 16 h, moving at 2 - 3 mm/h. Although both enveloped and unenveloped nucleocapsids were observed in the neuronal soma by transmission electron microscopy, only nucleocapsids were observed in the axons, closely associated with microtubules. Nodule formation at the surface of HSV-infected axons, becoming more dense at the axon terminus on epidermal cells, and patches of axolemmal HSV glycoprotein D expression were observed by scanning (immuno) electron microscopy, probably representing virus emerging from the axolemma. These findings strongly suggest a specialized mode of viral transport, assembly, and egress in sensory neurons: microtubule-associated intermediate-fast anterograde axonal transport of unenveloped nucleocapsids with separate transport of glycoproteins to the distal regions of the axon and assembly prior to virus emergence at the axon terminus...|$|E
40|$|We {{developed}} a non-invasive technique for electrophysiological investigations of ion transport proteins endogenously or heterologously expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. We named this technique the transoocyte voltage clamp (TOVC). Whereas {{in the classical}} two-microelectrode voltage-clamp (TEVC) technique, the oocyte is impaled with two glass microelectrodes, we mount the egg in a modified Ussing chamber as used for transepithelial electrophysiological studies. The oocyte is introduced in a container that is positioned between the two chamber halves. Proper fixation of the oocyte in the aperture of the container is accomplished under a stereo binocular microscope and the electrical seal between the oocyte and the container is achieved with <b>silicon</b> <b>grease.</b> The new method allows measurement of transoocyte currents and conductances {{as well as the}} recording of membrane impedance and the fluctuation analysis of ion currents. We studied a K+ channel that resembles the inward rectifier K+ channel endogenously expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. K+ currents were obtained by exposing one side of the oocyte to K(+) -containing solutions and by the application of different voltages. Adding Cs+ and Ba 2 + inhibited these currents. The analysis of the fluctuation in current demonstrated a Lorentzian component in the power density spectrum. With the transoocyte voltage clamped to zero, the corner frequency (fc) was 61 +/- 1. 7 Hz. Imposed positive transoocyte potentials caused a downward shift of fc. These findings are consistent with previous data obtained using the TEVC technique, and extend the characterization of the channel with kinetic data obtained from noise analysis. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|A PET {{detector}} {{featuring a}} pseudo-monolithic crystal {{is being developed}} as a more cost-effective alternative to a full monolithic crystal PET detector. This work evaluates different methods to localize the scintillation events in quartered monolithic crystals that are optically coupled. A semi-monolithic crystal assembly was formed using four 26 26 10 mm 3 LYSO crystals optically coupled together using optical adhesive, to mimic a 52 52 10 mm 3 monolithic crystal detector. The crystal assembly was coupled to a 64 -channel multi-anode photomultiplier tube using <b>silicon</b> <b>grease.</b> The detector was calibrated using a 34 34 scan grid. Events were first filtered and depth separated using a multi-Lorentzian fit to the collected light distribution. Next, three different techniques were explored to generate the look up tables for the event positioning. The first technique was 'standard interpolation' across the interface. The second technique was 'central extrapolation', where a bin was placed at {{the midpoint of the}} interface and events positioned within the interface region were discarded. The third technique used a 'central overlap' method where an extended region was extrapolated at each interface. Events were then positioned using least-squares minimization and maximum likelihood methods. The least-squares minimization applied to the look up table generated with the standard interpolation technique had the best full width at half maximum (FWHM) intrinsic spatial resolution and the lowest bias. However, there were discontinuities in the event positioning that would most likely lead to artifacts in the reconstructed image. The central extrapolation technique also had discontinuities and a 30 % sensitivity loss near the crystal-crystal interfaces. The central overlap technique had slightly degraded performance metrics, but it still provided ∼ 2. 1 mm intrinsic spatial resolution at the crystal-crystal interface and had a symmetric and continuously varying response function. Results using maximum likelihood positioning were similar to least-squares minimization for the central overlap data...|$|E
40|$|Presentation date: 2007 - 07 - 23 Graduation date: 2008 Podosphaera macularis causes one of {{the most}} {{important}} diseases, powdery mildew, of Humulus lupulus (hop). If left unmanaged, hop powdery mildew can cause total crop loss due to disease or browning of hop cones rendering the cones unmarketable to buyers. The Hop Powdery Mildew Infection Risk Index (HOPS) is heavily relied on for management of the disease. However, HOPS assumes constant inoculum presence, which is not likely to be true. Evidence suggests that temperature fluctuations influence inoculum availability. As such, knowledge of inoculum presence and density and their relationship to environmental conditions may increase management efficacy by reducing pesticide use and cost of crop production. Molecular methods for detecting and quantifying P. macularis were developed and used to analyze air samples taken from hop fields for two seasons. A protocol for DNA extraction from field samples was modified in order to use PCR to detect and quantify P. macularis DNA from the field. Primers and a probe designed to the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of P. macularis ribosomal DNA have made inoculum detection possible using both conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). DNA extracted from conidia impinged on glass rods coated in <b>silicon</b> <b>grease</b> has been used as template for qPCR, and we have successfully detected as DNA extracted from 10 spores Specific and sensitive detection of P. macularis DNA with conventional PCR was possible under conditions typically used to evaluate qPCR; however results from field samples indicated that sensitivity was an issue, in that spores were not detected in samples from fields with high disease pressure. The effects of constant exposure (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 °C) and 6 hr exposure (18, 22, 26, 30, 34, and 38 °C) on sporulation of P. macularis were tested. Exposure to constant low and high temperatures decreases sporulation, which indicates that inoculum may not always be available once the epidemic has started. Sporulation is also decreased during brief exposures to temperatures above 30 °C. These data indicate that inoculum availability is reduced when the temperature exceeds 30 °C in the field. A modification of HOPS should be examined to incorporate an algorithm which takes the findings in this study into account...|$|E
