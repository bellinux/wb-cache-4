40|$|Objectives: To explore Australian and UK consumers' receipt {{and use of}} {{spoken and}} written {{medicine}} information and examine the role of leaflets for consumers of over-the-counter (OTC) medicines. Methods: Semistructured {{interviews were conducted with}} 37 Australian and 39 UK consumers to explore information received with their most recent OTC medicine purchase, and how information was used at different times post-purchase. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed. Key findings: Similarities were evident between the key themes identified from Australian and UK consumers' experiences. Consumers infrequently sought <b>spoken</b> <b>information</b> and reported that pharmacy staff provided minimal <b>spoken</b> <b>information</b> for OTC medicines. Leaflets were not always received or wanted and had a less salient role as an information source for repeat OTC purchases. Consumers tended not to read OTC labels or leaflets. Product familiarity led to consumers tending not to seek information on labels or leaflets. When labels were consulted, directions for use were commonly read. However, OTC medicine information in general was infrequently revisited. Conclusions: As familiarity is not an infallible proxy for safe and effective medication use, strategies to promote the value and use of these OTC medicine information sources are important and needed. Minimal <b>spoken</b> <b>information</b> provision coupled with limited written information use may adversely impact medication safety in self-management...|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{vast amounts}} of audio and video {{material}} containing <b>spoken</b> <b>information</b> have become available in digital format, for example radio news recordings. Along with this development there is an increased demand to retrieve <b>spoken</b> <b>information</b> {{in response to a}} user's information need. This thesis addresses the problem of spoken document retrieval (SDR). A particular goal is to perform experimental studies on documents spoken in German. The approach taken by this thesis requires a phoneme recognizer, which initially generates phoneme sequences from the spoken documents. The main issues of phoneme-recognition [...] based SDR are (1) missing word boundaries in the phoneme sequences and (2) the high number of phoneme recognition errors, requiring an error-tolerant method to detect query words. We present Probabilistic String Matching (PSM); a new retrieval method where query words are spotted in document phoneme sequences that are corrupted by recognition errors.

40|$|Abstract. In <b>spoken</b> <b>information</b> retrieval, users ’ spoken {{queries are}} {{converted}} into text queries by using ASR engines. If top- 1 {{results of the}} ASR engines are incorrect, the errors are propagated to information retrieval systems. If a docu-ment collection is a small set of short texts, the errors will more affect the per-formances of information retrieval systems. To improve the top- 1 accuracies of the ASR engines, we propose a post-processing model to rearrange top-n out-puts of ASR engines by using Ranking SVM. To improve the re-ranking per-formances, the proposed model uses various features such as ASR ranking in-formation, morphological information, and domain-specific lexical information. In the experiments, the proposed model showed the higher precision of 4. 4 % and the higher recall rate of 6. 4 % than the baseline model without any post-processing. Based on this experimental result, the proposed model showed {{that it can be}} used as a post-processor for improving the performance of a <b>spoken</b> <b>information</b> retrieval system if a document collection is a restricted amount of sentences...|$|E

40|$|Cross-language {{comparison}} {{shows that}} in expressing information packaging [...] -i. e., the structuring of propositional content in function of the speaker's assumptions about the hearer's knowledge and attentional state [...] -, different languages exploit word order and prosody in different ways. In other words, one single informational construct is realized by drastically different structural means across languages. Thus for English and Dutch {{it can be argued}} that, roughly <b>speaking,</b> <b>information</b> packaging is structurally realized by means of alternative intonational contours of identical strings. But languages such as Catalan and Turkish, on the other hand, have a constant prosodic structure and realize information packaging by means of string order permutations. The present paper investigates how the various structural realizations of information packaging can be handled by a sign-based categorial grammar formalism which takes its inspiration from Oehrle's (1988, 1993) work on genera [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Theories that {{propose a}} mapping between {{prosodic}} and syntactic structures require that prosodic units in fluent speech be perceptually salient for infants. Although {{previous studies have}} demonstrated that infants are sensitive to prosodic markers of syntactic units, they do not show that prosodic information really has an impact on how infants encode the speech they hear. Two experiments were conducted to examine whether infants as young as 2 months old might actually use the prosody afforded by sentences to organize and remember <b>spoken</b> <b>information.</b> The results suggest that infants better remember the phonetic properties of (1) words that are prosodically linked together within a single clause as opposed to individual items in a list (Experiment 1); and (2) words that are prosodically linked within a single clausal unit as opposed to spanning two contiguous fragments (Experiment 2). Taken together, the evidence from both experiments suggests that the prosodic organization of speech into clausal units enhances infants 2 ̆ 7 memory for <b>spoken</b> <b>information.</b> These findings are discussed with regard to their implications for theories of language acquisition...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The {{efficacy}} of using sung words as a mnemonic device for verbal memory {{has been documented}} in persons with probable Alzheimer’s dementia (AD), {{but it is not}} yet known whether this effect is related to music training. Given that music training can enhance cognitive functioning, we explored the effects of music training and modality (sung vs. spoken) on verbal memory in persons with and without AD. Method: We used a mixed factorial design to compare learning (5 trials), delayed recall (30 -min and, 24 -hour), and recognition of sung versus <b>spoken</b> <b>information</b> in 22 healthy elderly (15 musicians), and 11 people with AD (5 musicians). Results: Musicians with AD showed better total learning (over 5 trials) of sung information than nonmusicians with AD. There {{were no significant differences in}} delayed recall and recognition accuracy (of either modality) between musicians with and without AD, suggesting that music training may facilitate memory function in AD. Analysis of individual performances showed that two of the five musicians with AD were able to recall some information on delayed recall, whereas the nonmusicians with AD recalled no information on delay. The only significant finding in regard to modality (sung vs. spoken) was that total learning was significantly worse for sung than <b>spoken</b> <b>information</b> for nonmusicians with AD. This may be due to the need to recode information presented in song into spoken recall, which may be more cognitively demanding for this group. Conclusions: This is the first study to demonstrate that music training modulates memory of sung and <b>spoken</b> <b>information</b> in AD. The mechanism underlying these results is unclear, but may be due to music training, higher cognitive abilities, or both. Our findings highlight the need for further research into the potentially protective effect of music training on cognitive abilities in our aging population. 13 page(s...|$|E
