40|$|This paper {{presents}} the moisture transfer and energy losses due to moisture of household refrigerator-freezer during {{the closed door}} operation. Moisture transfer into the cabinet takes place by two ways of gasket diffusion and cabinet breathing. Experiments were conducted in the controlled chamber to investigate {{the effects of the}} ambient temperature, cabinet load, thermostat set position and open <b>surface</b> water <b>pan</b> area inside the cabinet on moisture transfer. The average gasket diffusion and cabinet breathing moisture transfer is about 4. 6 kg/year and 18 kg/year respectively. In this experimental investigation, it is found that the average energy consumption of the refrigerator-freezer in kWh/day is about 2. 9, 2. 8, 2. 8 and 2. 9 due to the ambient temperature, cabinet load, thermostat set position and open <b>surface</b> water <b>pan</b> area respectively. The ambient temperature and open <b>surface</b> water <b>pan</b> area inside the cabinet have strong influence on gasket diffusion and cabinet breathing moisture transfer respectively. The extra energy consumption due to the gasket diffusion and cabinet breathing moisture transfer has been calculated and found as 1. 3 kWh/year and 4. 9 kWh/year respectively. The ambient temperature and cabinet load has strong influence on energy consumption compared to the thermostat setting position and open <b>surface</b> water <b>pan</b> area inside the cabinet. The average energy consumption is about 1043 kWh/year of the refrigeratorfreezer...|$|R
40|$|Because {{investigations}} of PAN at higher southern latitudes are very scarce, we measured <b>surface</b> <b>PAN</b> concentrations {{for the first}} time in Antarctica. During the Photochemical Experiment at Neumayer (PEAN' 99) campaign mean <b>surface</b> <b>PAN</b> mixing ratios of 13 +/- 7 pptv and maximum values of 48 pptv were found. When these PAN mixing ratios were compared to the sum of NOx and inorganic nitrate they were found to be equal or higher. Low ambient air temperatures and low PAN concentrations caused a slow homogeneous PAN decomposition rate of approximately 5 x 10 (- 2) pptv h(- 1) These slow decay rates were not sufficient to firmly establish the simultaneously observed NOx concentrations. In addition, low concentration ratios of [HNO 3]/[NOx] imply that the photochemical production of NOx within the snow pack can influence surface NOx mixing ratios in Antarctica. Alternate measurements of PAN mixing ratios at two different heights above the snow surface were performed to derive fluxes between the lower troposphere and the underlying snow pack using calculated friction velocities. Most of the concentration differences were below the precision of the measurements. Therefore, only an upper limit for the PAN flux of +/- 1 x 10 (13) molecules m(- 2) s(- 1) without a predominant direction can be estimated. However, PAN fluxes below this limit can still influence both the transfer of nitrogen compounds between atmosphere and ice, and the PAN budget in higher southern latitudes.

At low concentrations the butanol simply swells the PAN near-surface nanostructure, but at higher concentrations the nanostructure fragments. Octanol and dodecanol first lower the preferred curvature of the PAN near-surface nanostructure because, unlike n-butanol, their alkyl chains are too long to be accommodated alongside the PAN cations. At higher concentrations, octanol and dodecanol self-assemble into n-alkanol rich aggregates in a PAN rich matrix. The concentration at which aggregation first becomes apparent decreases with n-alkanol chain length...|$|R
50|$|In pan frying, {{the water}} that exits the meat forms a barrier between the meat and the oil or the <b>surface</b> of the <b>pan.</b> This barrier is {{critical}} {{for the success of}} pan frying meat. When meat cooks, the proteins {{on the surface of the}} meat denature because of the heat. This means that many of the secondary bonds that give the proteins their shape are broken. The protein molecules want to reform those interactions to return to their most thermodynamically stable state. Two opportune locations for the surface proteins to bind are the oil and the <b>surface</b> of the <b>pan.</b> Meat sticking to the bottom of the pan is caused by the interactions between proteins on the surface of the meat binding with the molecules on the <b>surface</b> of the <b>pan.</b> The denatured protein can also bind with the oil in the pan.

40|$|Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) is {{a widely}} used polymer in the textile industry. PAN {{contains}} cyano groups on the surface due to which it possess low hydrophilicity and limits its application.

A number of strategies such as chemical treatment, plasma treatment, enzymatic treatment etc. have been applied for the surface modification of polymer but enzymatic treatment are advantageous over plasma treatment and chemical treatment.

40|$|The primary {{question}} that the thesis investigates is: what impacts could climate change have on cattle water demand and supply in Khurutshe, Botswana. This thesis is pursued {{in light of the}} fact that there is a lack of knowledge on climate change and cattle water demand and supply. Thus, this thesis aims at filling the gap in knowledge on climate change and cattle water resources in Botswana and other semi-arid environments. A cattle water demand and supply model is developed to investigate the primary question of the thesis. The model is driven by rainfall and temperature over time as these variables largely determine cattle water supply and demand, respectively. Climate scenarios for 2050 are constructed using SimCLIM (developed by the International Global Change Institute of the University of Waikato) based on HadCM 3 and CSIRO Mk 2 General Circulation Models (GCMs). Three Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) are used: A 1 B, A 1 FT and A 1 T. These emission scenarios were selected based on their coverage for possible future Greenhouse Gas emissions (GHG). Climate scenarios show that by 2050 the temperature for the Khurutshe area could increase by as much as 3 oC depending on the GCM and SRES emission scenario and that there could be a decline in rainfall of up to 14 % per month. CSIRO Mk 2 displayed the maximum decline in rainfall while HadCM 3 depicted the maximum increase in temperature. The model is implemented in the Khurutshe of the Kgatleng District, Botswana. The results reported are for Masama Ranch and also for the whole of the Khurutshe area. The results show that climate change could lead to an annual increase of more than 20 % in cattle water demand by 2050 due to an increase in temperature. In addition, climate change could lead to a decline in the contribution of <b>surface</b> <b>pan</b> water to cattle water supply. Overall, there could be an increase in abstraction of groundwater for cattle by 2050 due to an increase in demand and a decline in forage water content and <b>surface</b> <b>pan</b> water. Observations in semi-arid environments of Africa indicate that farmers encounter problems of declining borehole yields and local depletion in groundwater in summer and drought years when demand peaks. In addition, it has been observed that during drought more cattle are lost as a result of lack of water, particularly for those whose cattle are reliant on surface water. Thus, the results from this study indicate that climate change could enhance this problem. In the thesis I have shown the importance of integrating climate change impacts on water demand and supply when assessing water resources, which has been ignored in the past. Some of the policy options that are discussed are tradable pumping permits for controlling abstraction and allocation issues in the Khurutshe aquifer and, controlling stocking numbers. This is in recognition of the fact that climate change could result in more reliance on groundwater for both cattle farming and urban water supply hence compromising sustainability and allocation issues especially for the Khurutshe aquifer which is earmarked to supply the city of Gaborone and surrounding villages in drought periods...|$|R

Anichab is a 128 km 2 salt-encrusted pan on the hyper-arid southern coast of Namibia with an emergent, well-preserved and in-place mid-Holocene mollusc assemblage. The molluscs are typical of subtidal sands on the sheltered side of offshore islands but include several warm-water species no longer found living along this coast. The Holocene evolution of the pan was largely influenced by changes in sea level and supply of sand along the coast. Calibrated radiocarbon ages of mollusc shells indicate a maximum Holocene sea level of ca 2 m above mean sea level (msl) from 7 Ã† 0 to 6 Ã† 3 ka and a return to near present-day sea level by 5 Ã† 3 ka.
