40|$|Recently, the {{production}} and service components {{of the real estate}} business have evolved from collections of mom and pop operations to full-fledged industries comprised of highly competitive, small and medium-sized firms. This evolution to larger-scale business operations has important implications for the type of financial analysis to be conducted by real estate firms in the future. Specifically, the traditional project-specific financial analysis of real estate investment opportunities will be subsumed by <b>strategic</b> <b>financial</b> <b>planning</b> for real estate decisions at the firm level. Even with a radical change in emphasis and interpretation, the discounted cash flow tradition, firmly established in project-specific analysis, is likely to remain since it underlies most <b>strategic</b> <b>financial</b> <b>planning</b> models. This article details how such a model can be used by firms to make real estate production decisions...|$|R
40|$|Substantially more {{investment}} {{is needed in}} both OECD and developing countries to achieve water and, especially, sanitation policy objectives, and to realise the associated economic, social and environmental benefits. Optimising the need for investment through demand-side measures, such as better planning and low-cost technologies, and ensuring an adequate supply of finance will be essential to meet those objectives. <b>Strategic</b> <b>financial</b> <b>planning</b> that blends the “ 3 Ts ” – tariffs and other user contributions, tax-based subsidies and transfers including official development assistance – provides an important means for agreeing on water- and sanitation-related targets and how they will be achieved. This requires good information and analysis, policy dialogue among stakeholders, and appropriate measures to reduce the demand for, and increase the supply of, finance. This report reviews good practices in <b>strategic</b> <b>financial</b> <b>planning</b> in OECD and developing countries and summarises key lessons for policy makers and practitioners...|$|R

40|$|Dynamic {{financial}} analysis (DFA) {{is a technique}} which uses Monte Carlo simulation to investigate the evolution over time of financial models of funds, complex liabilities and entire firms. Although of increasing popularity, the drawback of DFA is the dearth of systematic methods for optimising model parameters for <b>strategic</b> <b>financial</b> <b>planning.</b> This paper introduces strategic DFA which employs the only recently mature technology of dynamic stochastic optimisation to fill this gap. The new approach is {{described in terms of}} an illustrative case study of a joint university/industry project to create a decision support system for strategic asset liability management involving global asset classes and defined contribution pension plans. Although the application of the system described in the paper is to fund design and risk management, the approach and techniques described here are much more broadly applicable to <b>strategic</b> <b>financial</b> <b>planning</b> problems; for example, to insurance and reinsurance firms, to risk capital allocation in financial institutions and trading firms and to corporate investment and business development involving real options. As well as describing the mathematical and statistical models used in the case study, the paper treats econometric estimation, asset return and liability scenario generation, model specification and optimisation, system evaluation and historica...|$|R
