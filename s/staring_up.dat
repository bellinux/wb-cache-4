25|$|In 1950, Anger {{moved to}} Paris, France, where he {{initially}} stayed with {{friends of his}} (who themselves {{had been forced to}} leave Hollywood after being blacklisted for formerly having belonged to trade union organisations). He would later remark that he travelled to the country after receiving a letter from the French director Jean Cocteau in which he told Anger of his admiration for Fireworks (shown in 1949 at Festival du Film Maudit in Biarritz, France). Upon arrival, Anger and Cocteau became friends, with the Frenchman giving the young protege his permission to make a movie of his ballet The Young Man and Death, although at the time there were no financial backers for the project. While in Paris he continued producing short films; in 1950 he started filming on Rabbit's Moon, which was also known as La Lune des Lapins and revolved around a clown who was <b>staring</b> <b>up</b> at the moon, in which a rabbit lived, something found within Japanese mythology. Anger produced 20 minutes of footage at the Films du Pantheon Studio in the city before he was rushed out of the studio, leaving the film uncompleted. He stored the footage in the disorganized archives of the Cinémathèque Française, and only collected it again in 1970, when he finally finished and released Rabbit's Moon. It was at the Cinémathèque Française that he was given by the head, Henri Langlois, prints of Sergei Eisenstein's Que Viva Mexico!, which he attempted to put into Eisenstein's original order.|$|E
500|$|As Prince Gian Gastone disliked his father's hyper-pious character, he {{elected to}} stay away from him and the royal court. The closed court that Gian Gastone did keep was {{dominated}} by his favourite, Dami. Meanwhile, the Grand Prince Ferdinando was slowly dying from syphilis, making Gian Gastone's immediate succession more likely. Ferdinando, nonetheless, was not alone in his suffering: Guyot de Merville, a French adventurer, took note of Gian Gastone's mental decline: [...] "He carries [...] so far that it is said he never opens a letter, to avoid having to answer." [...] Additionally, Gian Gastone's fragile temperament required long periods of isolation; he spent several hours alone each night, drinking and <b>staring</b> <b>up</b> at the moon.|$|E

500|$|The film's plot, which {{develops}} as {{a flashback}} narrated by Dumitriu's young son, opens with what American film magazine Variety called [...] "a mad gallop, {{with the camera}} in the saddle, giving viewers {{a crash course in}} regional rivalries circa 1925." [...] In the opening scenes, Romanian authorities are shown to be frantically engaged in shutting down a brothel, whose presence they believe would embarrass local high society at a time when a grand ball is set to take place. This scandalized prostitutes include the Hungarian Erzsi, who is also a communist sympathizer, and who irritates the officials by shouting out insults and mooning them through a window. During the latter scene, John Simon notes, Land Forces officers are shown <b>staring</b> <b>up</b> [...] "in mixed horror and admiration at the familiar globe whose owner they promptly identify." [...] As she is beaten up by the soldiers, Erzsi continues to defy her aggressors by shouting up revolutionary slogans coined under the Hungarian Soviet Republic.|$|E
500|$|The video {{opens with}} the view of a city {{populated}} with skyscrapers, intermingling railway lines and aero-crafts. Steam blows out of the funnels of a factory as big machines are shown. Madonna, wearing black lingerie, appears {{on the back of}} a statue of an angry looking swan, and utters the line: [...] "Come on girls, do you believe in love?" [...] This is followed by the chorus, showing the interiors of the factory where the workers slave at the machines, as rain pour incessantly on them. Amidst the smoke filled environment, the chiseled torso of the male workers are shown, as they strip off their shirts, with water splashing all around. Madonna is then shown in a light-green gown, holding a black cat in her lap, looking across the factory from her sitting room of her penthouse office. As she sings the first verse, the workers perform choreographed dance routine inside the factory. Madonna lies down on a sofa and the cat escapes from her lap, as her singing reaches the owner of the factory, through a series of speakers. He becomes nervous hearing her voice and looks down to find one of the workers <b>staring</b> <b>up</b> and looking for the source of the voice.|$|E

2500|$|Father Merrin's arrival {{scene was}} filmed on Max von Sydow's {{first day of}} work. The scene where the elderly priest, Father Merrin (portrayed by Max von Sydow) steps out of a cab and {{stands in front of}} the MacNeil residence, between the open gates of the driveway — silhouetted in a misty streetlamp's glow and <b>staring</b> <b>up</b> at an intense beam of light shining from a bedroom window above — is one of the most famous scenes in the movie.

Sam loathes and distrusts him, but Frodo pities the poor creature. Gollum promises by the Ring (his [...] "Precious")to lead the pair to the Black Gate of Mordor, and for a time appears to be like his old self Sméagol. He leads them through a hidden passage of the Dead Marshes in order to avoid being spied by Orcs. Frodo and Sam learn that the Dead Marshes were once part of an ancient battlefield, upon which the War of the Last Alliance was fought.

2500|$|This {{white marble}} {{sculpture}} represents a man standing, <b>staring</b> <b>up,</b> and raising {{his left arm}} into the air. Wrapped around his left wrist is a chain; however, this chain is not restraining him. To his right is a woman kneeling with her hands held in a prayer position. The man’s right hand is gently placed on her right shoulder. Forever Free represents the emancipation of African-American slaves after the Civil War, a celebration of black liberation, salvation, and redemption. Lewis attempted to break stereotypes of African-American women with this sculpture. For example, she portrayed the woman as completely dressed while the man was partially dressed. This drew {{attention away from the}} notion of African-American women being sexual figures. This sculpture also symbolizes the end of the Civil War. While African Americans were legally free, they continued to be restrained, shown {{by the fact that the}} couple had chains wrapped around their bodies. The representation of race and gender has been critiqued by modern scholars, particularly the Eurocentric features of the female figure. [...] This piece is held by Howard University Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.|$|E
