5|$|The {{physical}} properties of gallium are highly anisotropic, i.e. have different values along {{the three major}} crystallographical axes a, b, and c (see table), producing a <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the linear (α) and volume thermal expansion coefficients. The properties of gallium are strongly temperature-dependent, particularly near the melting point. For example, the {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} increases by several hundred percent upon melting.|$|E
5|$|The {{pre-production}} Griffon I {{shared the}} R engine's bore and stroke, but was otherwise {{a completely new}} design that first ran in the Experimental Department in November 1939. Although this single engine was never flown, the production version, the Griffon II, first flew in 1941 installed in the Fairey Firefly. A <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the R and the production Griffon was the re-location of the camshaft and supercharger drives {{to the front of}} the engine to reduce overall length. Another length-reducing measure was the use of a single magneto (the R had two, mounted at the rear), this again was moved {{to the front of the}} engine.|$|E
5|$|A <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the {{community}} components in Miami and California was that both Los Angeles and San Francisco had very active and visible gay communities. Founder of Metropolitan Community Church Reverend Troy Perry, {{who began his}} career as a charismatic preacher in the Church of God of Prophecy but was rejected for being gay, went on a 16-day fast to raise $100,000 and succeeded. Hollywood stars Bette Midler, Lily Tomlin, and Richard Pryor came out in force for the cause, raising another $100,000. In January 1978 Harvey Milk took office as a supervisor of San Francisco, and the first openly gay man to be elected to office in California. Briggs campaigned for the measure throughout the state, and held a series of public and televised debates with Milk who was very well received by the media, quick to quip and give print-friendly comments. He often made the front page in newspapers in San Francisco with the outrageous things he said. Milk spoke to 350,000 participants of 1978's San Francisco Gay Freedom Day; similar numbers were seen in Los Angeles.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, the Waffen-SS had {{suffered}} over 43,000 casualties up to February 1942, {{particularly in the}} Battle of Moscow, and Berger had to replace them. Berger next {{turned his attention to}} the Hungarian Volksdeutsche. Through an agreement with the Royal Hungarian Army, his recruiters enlisted more than 16,500 ethnic German recruits from Hungary between March and May 1942. While this campaign was ongoing, on 20 April 1942 Berger was promoted to SS-Gruppenführer. At this point, he saw a <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> SS ideological leadership and the martial indoctrination conducted by the German Army. In September 1942, the SS-FHA complained bitterly about Berger's recruiters, stating that many of the recruits were medically unsuitable, had been coerced or duped into enlisting, or were in fact ethnic Hungarians. Late in 1942, more Volksdeutsche from the Banat and Romania were combined with the SS Cavalry Brigade to form the SS-Kavallerie-Division. On 24 November 1942, the Chief of the Gestapo, Heinrich Müller advised Himmler of a proposal he had received from Berger that a Hungarian SS division could be financed by selling emigration permits to Slovak Jews.|$|E
