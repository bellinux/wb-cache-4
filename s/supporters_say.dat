5|$|Support for {{continued}} use of the name {{has come from the}} team's owners and a majority of fans, which include some Native Americans. <b>Supporters</b> <b>say</b> that the name honors the achievements and virtues of Native Americans, and that it is not intended in a negative manner. Some, such as team president Bruce Allen, also point to the use of Redskins by three high school teams, two on reservations, that have a majority of Native American students. Supporters have asserted that a majority of Native Americans are not offended by the name based upon a national poll by Annenberg Public Policy Center in 2004. In a commentary published soon after that poll, 15 Native American scholars collaborated on a critique that stated that there were so many flaws in the Annenberg study that rather than being a measure of Native American opinion, it was an expression of white privilege and colonialism. Specific criticism of the methodology includes the use of self-reporting to identify Native Americans, which violated the basic principles supporting the validity of public opinion polling. In May 2016, the Washington Post published a poll that duplicated the central question posed in 2004, yielding an identical result.|$|E
25|$|<b>Supporters</b> <b>say</b> {{that the}} total {{electricity}} generated from a large-scale array of dispersed wind farms, located in different wind regimes, cannot be accurately described as intermittent, {{because it does not}} start up or switch off instantaneously at irregular intervals. With a small amount of supplementary peak-load plant, which operates infrequently, large-scale distributed wind power can substitute for some base-load power and be equally reliable.|$|E
25|$|But {{advocates of}} the guild model argue that the union is {{laying the groundwork for}} {{long-term}} growth. The union is not only gaining members which enable it to advocate for changes in federal labor law to permit the unionization of independent contractors. The union is also setting the stage for the affiliation of potentially hundreds of thousands of these workers. In the meantime, <b>supporters</b> <b>say,</b> OPEIU gains some additional dues income and is able to enhance its bargaining status with insurers and other vendors by pointing to a larger membership base.|$|E

25|$|<b>Supporters</b> <b>say</b> {{that capital}} {{punishment}} is applied infrequently and {{only to those}} who have committed the most extreme of crimes—a single act of murder does not attract capital punishment without additional aggravating circumstances such as rape or robbery. In the 1956 debate, Japanese serial killer Genzo Kurita, who engaged in rape and necrophilia, was cited by the Diet {{as an example of a}} murderer whose crimes were atrocious enough to merit death. However, it is more the rarity of extreme crimes in Japanese society rather than an unwillingness of the authorities to carry out executions that has caused so few executions to take place.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, Stavans {{published}} in the Barcelona newspaper La Vanguardia a Spanglish translation of {{the first chapter of}} Cervantes’ Don Quixote de la Mancha. The translation has been controversial throughout the world, garnishing celebrations and attacks. Critics accuse Stavans of using Spanglish to call attention to himself. <b>Supporters</b> <b>say</b> that the translation is an indication that the Latino community in the United States has come of age. Stavans has responded to the reactions with interviews in which he argues that Spanglish is today’s manifestation of “mestizaje,” the crossbreeding of racial, social, and cultural traits of Anglos and Latinos similar to what occurred during the colonization of the Americas in the sixteenth century.|$|E
500|$|Much public {{attention}} {{has focused on}} Opus Dei's practice of mortification—the voluntary offering up of discomfort or pain to God; this includes fasting, or for some of its members self-inflicted pain such as self-flagellation. Mortification {{has a long history}} in many world religions, including the Catholic Church. It has been endorsed by Popes as a way of following Christ, who died in a bloody crucifixion and who speaking of anybody that sought to be his disciple: [...] "let him deny himself, take up his cross daily and follow me." [...] (Lk 9:23) <b>Supporters</b> <b>say</b> that opposition to mortification is rooted in having lost (1) the [...] "sense of the enormity of sin" [...] or offense against God, and the consequent penance, both interior and exterior, (2) the notions of [...] "wounded human nature" [...] and of concupiscence or inclination to sin, and thus the need for [...] "spiritual battle," [...] and (3) a spirit of sacrifice for love and [...] "supernatural ends," [...] and not only for physical enhancement.|$|E

On July 12, Sanders officially endorsed Clinton at a unity rally with her in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.|$|R
500|$|For some time, it was {{doubtful}} that the match would be played at all. Shortly before the match, Fischer {{demanded that the}} players receive, {{in addition to the}} agreed-upon prize fund of $125,000 (5/8 to the winner, 3/8 to the loser) and 30% of the proceeds from television and film rights, 30% of the box-office receipts. He failed to arrive in Iceland for the opening ceremony on July 1. Fischer's behavior was seemingly full of contradictions, as it had been throughout his career. He finally flew to Iceland and agreed to play after a two-day postponement of the match by FIDE President Max Euwe, a surprise doubling of the prize fund by British investment banker Jim Slater, and much persuasion, including a phone call by Henry Kissinger to Fischer. Many commentators, particularly from the USSR, have suggested that all this (and his continuing demands and unreasonableness) was part of Fischer's plan to [...] "psych out" [...] Spassky. Fischer's <b>supporters</b> <b>say</b> that winning the World Championship was the mission of his life, that he simply wanted the setting to be perfect for it when he took the stage, and that his behavior was the same as it had always been.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding {{the issue}} of {{internal}} consistency and correspondence with the Gospels, Valtorta <b>supporters</b> <b>say</b> that, ever since Saint Augustine of Hippo addressed the Augustinian hypothesis (that the Gospel of Mark used the Gospel of Matthew as a source and that the Gospel of Luke used both Matthew and Mark) in the 5th century, religious scholars have been debating issues regarding the order of composition of the Gospels, at times with no clear resolution. Such debates still take place among experts even on issues regarding the Church canons and the canonical Gospels themselves. Valtorta <b>supporters</b> <b>say</b> that the Poem of the Man God seems to provide solutions to some synoptic debates such as those regarding Luke 22:66 ...|$|E

5000|$|In October 2016, McCrostie faced {{criticism}} when he {{was recorded}} {{on a cell phone}} gathering up a challenger's campaign fliers while campaigning door-to-door in Boise. The campaign flyers came from Ryan McDonald, a Republican challenger to District 16 Sen. Grant Burgoyne. When confronted, McCrostie stated, [...] "It's part of the game."

2500|$|On 11 April, Ravalomanana's {{supporters}} {{ended their}} participation in meetings with Rajoelina's <b>supporters.</b> Ravalomanana's <b>supporters</b> <b>saying</b> that the meetings were not worthwhile because their condition of the Ravalomanana's return to power was not met, nor was the United Nations' special envoy to Madagascar, Tiébilé Dramé, acting as an impartial mediator. In response, Dramé said he was [...] "seeking a consensus" [...] rather than an [...] "imposed solution". On the same day, more than 10,000 people assembled in Antananarivo to protest Rajoelina's government.|$|R
2500|$|Critics of the {{legislation}} say it encourages racial profiling, while <b>supporters</b> <b>say</b> the law prohibits the use of race as the sole basis for investigating immigration status. [...] The law was modified by Arizona House Bill 2162 {{within a week of}} its signing with the goal of addressing some of these concerns. There have been protests in opposition to the law in over 70 U.S. cities, including boycotts and calls for boycotts of Arizona.|$|E
2500|$|The Constitution of the Republic of China still {{claims to}} be the {{government}} of the whole of China. Taiwan independence <b>supporters</b> <b>say</b> that the non-assertion of the claim is mainly due to PRC's public statement that any attempts to change the ROC constitution is interpreted as declaring independence, which will lead to [...] "military actions" [...] from the PRC. Given the PRC's attitude, even having the General Assembly admit the ROC or [...] "Taiwan" [...] as an observer, as with Palestine, would be problematic; the case of Palestine is {{different from that of the}} ROC because of the UN's commitment to a two-state solution for the Israeli–Palestinian conflict but not for the Taiwan issue.|$|E
2500|$|Milošević's <b>supporters</b> <b>say</b> the anti-bureaucratic {{revolution}} was an authentic grass-roots political movement. Reacting to the indictment, Dr. Branko Kostić, Montenegro's then-representative on the Yugoslav state presidency said, [...] "Well, {{it sounds like}} nonsense to me. If a government or a leadership were supportive of Milošević, {{then it would be}} normal for him to feel indebted to them, not the other way around." [...] He said Milošević enjoyed genuine grassroots support because [...] "his name at that time shone brightly on the political arena of the entire federal Yugoslavia... and many people saw him as a person who would be finally able to make things move, to get things going." [...] Kosta Bulatović, an organizer of the anti-bureaucratic rallies, said [...] "All of this was spontaneous" [...] the motivation to protest was [...] "coming from the grassroots." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cox aims {{to prevent}} {{discrimination}} against Muslim women and 'jurisdiction creep' in Islamic tribunals, {{which would be}} forced to acknowledge the primacy of English law under a bill introduced to the House of Lords in May 2012. [...] The bill will introduce an offence carrying a five-year jail sentence for anyone falsely claiming or implying that sharia courts or councils have legal jurisdiction over family or criminal law. The bill, which will apply to all arbitration tribunals if passed, aims to tackle discrimination, which its <b>supporters</b> <b>say</b> is inherent in the courts, by banning the sharia practice of giving woman's testimony only half the weight of men's. [...] In a similar way to Jewish Beth Din courts, sharia tribunals can make verdicts in cases involving financial and property issues which, under the Arbitration Act 1996, are enforceable by county courts or the high court.|$|E
2500|$|Western Rite {{advocates have}} pointed out that there is nothing {{inherently}} unorthodox about creating a new rite for the Church provided that the Orthodoxy of the rite is sound. The Byzantine Rite has grown in ways which have caused liturgies and devotions to develop in one location without subsequent universal practice. Such services would have been invented from scratch based on pastoral need at some point, yet few Western Rite critics would say that such services or devotions should be abandoned, thus perceiving to lend to the legitimacy of restoring an ancient rite of the undivided Church. Western Rite <b>supporters</b> <b>say</b> that Western Rite never actually lost continuity of use in Orthodoxy, since on Mount Athos, during history, on special occasions the Liturgy of St. Peter the Apostle was served. It was used even in Russia prior to reformations of patriarch Nikon, and later by [...] "old believers".|$|E
2500|$|During his lifetime, Colegio Cesar Chavez {{was one of}} the few {{institutions}} {{named in}} his honor, but after his death he became a major historical icon for the Latino community, with many schools, streets, and parks being named after him. He has since become an icon for organized labor and leftist politics, symbolizing support for workers and for Hispanic empowerment based on grass roots organizing. He is also famous for popularizing the slogan [...] "Sí, se puede" [...] (Spanish for [...] "Yes, one can" [...] or, roughly, [...] "Yes, it can be done"), which was adopted as the 2008 [...] of Barack Obama. His <b>supporters</b> <b>say</b> his work led to numerous improvements for union laborers. Although the UFW faltered a few years after Chavez died in 1993, he became an iconic [...] "folk saint" [...] in the pantheon of Mexican Americans. His birthday, March 31, has become Cesar Chavez Day, a state holiday in California, Colorado, and Texas. Among many other honors and accolades received both while still living and after his death, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1994.|$|E
