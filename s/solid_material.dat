5|$|At Oak Ridge, uranium slugs were {{irradiated}} for 40 days, {{then left}} {{to cool down}} for 1 to 5 days, then dissolved. Barium then was extracted and the solution evaporated; the <b>solid</b> <b>material</b> was then shipped to Los Alamos. As of 1949, full production runs involved up to 1728 slugs (34.5 batches of 50 slugs). Until 1949 the Oak Ridge production site processed uranium slugs irradiated both on-site and at Hanford; afterward only Hanford material was processed.|$|E
5|$|In {{some species}} of Lepidoptera, a waxy layer is present inside the chorion {{adjacent}} to the vitelline layer which {{is thought to have}} evolved to prevent desiccation. In insects, the chorion has a layer of air-pores in the otherwise <b>solid</b> <b>material</b> which provides very limited capability for respiratory function. In Lepidoptera, the chorion layer above this air pore layer is lamellar with successive sheets of protein arranged in a particular direction and stepped so as to form a helical arrangement.|$|E
5|$|Surface {{diffusion}} is {{a general}} process involving the motion of adatoms, molecules, and atomic clusters (adparticles) at <b>solid</b> <b>material</b> surfaces. The process can generally be thought of in terms of particles jumping between adjacent adsorption sites on a surface, as in figure 1. Just as in bulk diffusion, this motion is typically a thermally promoted process with rates increasing with increasing temperature. Many systems display diffusion behavior that deviates from the conventional model of nearest-neighbor jumps. Tunneling diffusion is a particularly interesting example of an unconventional mechanism wherein hydrogen {{has been shown to}} diffuse on clean metal surfaces via the quantum tunneling effect.|$|E

5|$|Glasses {{and certain}} types of {{plastics}} are commonly welded materials. Unlike metals, which have a specific melting point, glasses and plastics have a melting range, called the glass transition. When heating the <b>solid</b> <b>material</b> into this range, it will generally become softer and more pliable. When it crosses through the glass transition, {{it will become a}} very thick, sluggish, viscous liquid. Typically, this viscous liquid will have very little surface tension, becoming a sticky, honey-like consistency, so welding can usually take place by simply pressing two melted surfaces together. The two liquids will generally mix and join at first contact. Upon cooling through the glass transition, the welded piece will solidify as one solid piece of amorphous material.|$|E

40|$|The U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NRC's) {{regulations}} that set standards for {{protection of the}} public against radiation do not currently contain specific requirements for the control of <b>solid</b> <b>materials</b> with small or no amounts of radioactivity.

25|$|Aerogel is a {{material}} that is 98.2% air. Aerogel has a porous solid network that contains air pockets, with the air pockets taking {{up the majority of}} space within the material. The lack of <b>solid</b> <b>material</b> allows aerogel to be almost weightless.|$|E

25|$|A polaron is a {{quasiparticle}} used in {{condensed matter physics}} {{to understand}} the interactions between electrons and atoms in a <b>solid</b> <b>material.</b> The polaron concept was first proposed by Lev Landau in 1933 to describe an electron moving in a dielectric crystal where the atoms move from their equilibrium positions to effectively screen the charge of an electron, known as a phonon cloud. This lowers the electron mobility and increases the electron's effective mass.|$|E

25|$|A crystal or {{crystalline}} solid is a <b>solid</b> <b>material</b> whose constituents (such as atoms, molecules, or ions) {{are arranged}} in a highly ordered microscopic structure, forming a crystal lattice that extends in all directions. In addition, macroscopic single crystals are usually identifiable by their geometrical shape, consisting of flat faces with specific, characteristic orientations. The scientific study of crystals and crystal formation is known as crystallography. The process of crystal formation via mechanisms of crystal growth is called crystallization or solidification.|$|E
25|$|Volcanic {{activity}} produces lightning-friendly {{conditions in}} multiple ways. The enormous quantity of pulverized material and gases explosively ejected {{into the atmosphere}} creates a dense plume of particles. The ash density and constant motion within the volcanic plume produces charge by frictional interactions (triboelectrification), resulting in very powerful and very frequent flashes as the cloud attempts to neutralize itself. Due to the extensive <b>solid</b> <b>material</b> (ash) content, unlike the water rich charge generating zones of a normal thundercloud, it is often called a dirty thunderstorm.|$|E
25|$|In January 1930, Dr. Elmer K. Bolton became {{assistant}} chemical {{director in}} the chemical department, and thus, Carothers' immediate boss. Bolton wanted practical results in 1930, and his wish was fulfilled. Bolton asked Carothers to examine the chemistry of an acetylene polymer {{with the goal of}} creating synthetic rubber. In April 1930 one of Carothers' staff, Dr. Arnold M. Collins, isolated chloroprene, a liquid which polymerized to produce a <b>solid</b> <b>material</b> that resembled rubber.

25|$|This {{principle}} {{relies on}} substances harmful to humans being usually more reactive than air. This method of separation will use {{some form of}} generally reactive substance (for example an acid) coating or supported by some <b>solid</b> <b>material.</b> An example is synthetic resins. These can be created with different groups of atoms (usually called functional groups) that have different properties. Thus a resin can be tailored to a particular toxic group. When the reactive substance comes {{in contact with the}} resin, it will bond to it, removing it from the air stream. It may also exchange with a less harmful substance at this site.|$|E
25|$|Bradgate Park and its {{surrounding}} areas were heavily overlain in the (geologically) recent past by glacial deposits of Boulder Clay. The Quaternary period includes the last ice age. As the ice melted, some 10,000 years ago, the <b>solid</b> <b>material</b> within the ice settled over the 'natural' rocks below. This material includes unsorted clay and sand particles, small and large pebbles and large stones and boulders. It travelled great distances within the ice sheets and glaciers, so individual rocks, whether on the ground, or within the great lengths of stone walls of the Park, may be local stone, or may be a specimen from northern Britain or even from northern Europe.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there are}} {{similarities}} between adsorption chillers and absorption refrigeration, {{the former is}} based on the interaction between gases and solids. The adsorption chamber of the chiller is filled with a <b>solid</b> <b>material</b> (for example zeolite, silica gel, alumina, active carbon or certain types of metal salts), which in its neutral state has adsorbed the refrigerant. When heated, the solid desorbs (releases) refrigerant vapour, which subsequently is cooled and liquefied. This liquid refrigerant then provides a cooling effect at the evaporator from its enthalpy of vaporization. In the final stage the refrigerant vapour is (re)adsorbed into the solid. As an adsorption chiller requires no compressor, it is relatively quiet.|$|E
