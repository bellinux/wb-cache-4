50|$|According to its {{inventor}} Dave Lampert, the Sybian {{was first}} conceived in the 1970s {{but it was}} not until 1983 that he began to develop the idea further.

50|$|Around 1920, {{vacuum tube}} {{technology}} had matured {{to the point}} where the availability of radio receivers made radio broadcasting viable. A technical challenge was that the vacuum tubes in the radio receivers required 50 to 250 volt direct current but car batteries ran at 6V. Voltage was stepped up <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>vibrator</b> that provided <b>a</b> pulsating DC which could be converted to <b>a</b> higher voltage <b>with</b> <b>a</b> transformer, rectified, and filtered to create higher-voltage DC.|$|R

40|$|Active seismic {{measurements}} were {{an important part}} of geophysical traverses on the Antarctic ice sheet {{as far back as the}} 1920 s. These methods lost their leading role for ice thickness measurements to much faster ground-based and airborne radar surveys because of the considerable logistical effort necessary for seismic data acquisition. However, new achievements <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>vibrator</b> source in active seismics (vibroseis for short) could open new prospects and foster future geological and glaciological surveys in Antarctica and Greenland and on ice caps and glaciers...|$|R
5000|$|In late 1991 Bowie {{reiterated that}} he was still happy being in the band during that time, stating [...] "I'm content. ... I'm {{deriving}} a great deal of fulfillment from working with Tin Machine", and band-mate Gabrels agreed, saying [...] "we're doing exactly what we wanted to do." [...] During press performances for songs on the album, Gabrels famously played his guitar <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>vibrator</b> and on another occasion (when banned from using the vibrator on BBC's [...] "Top of the Pops"), a chocolate éclair.|$|R

30|$|Figure  7 {{shows the}} V-shaped {{aligning}} sub-device. We conducted experiments {{to verify that}} seeds can be aligned in the bottom groove of the V-shape <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>vibrator</b> and measure {{the time needed to}} align them. Throughout this paper, we use mock seeds made of tungsten with the same dimensions as the Au grain. The density of tungsten is close to that of gold. The measurement was repeated 5 times. Figure  8 shows the result. The horizontal axis shows the number of seeds to align and the vertical axis the time needed to align them. All seeds can be aligned, although the time needed increased as the number of seeds increased.|$|R

40|$|An thin elastic {{steel plate}} is excited <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>vibrator</b> and its local {{velocity}} displays a turbulent-like Fourier spectrum. This system {{is believed to}} develop elastic wave turbulence. We analyze here {{the motion of the}} plate <b>with</b> <b>a</b> two-point measurement in order to check, in our real system, a few hypotheses required for the Zakharov theory of weak turbulence to apply. We show that the motion of the plate is indeed a superposition of bending waves following the theoretical dispersion relation of the linear wave equation. The nonlinearities seem to efficiently break the coherence of the waves so that no modal structure is observed. Several hypotheses of the weak turbulence theory seem to be verified, but nevertheless the theoretical predictions for the wave spectrum are not verified experimentally.

40|$|A {{middle-aged man}} was {{admitted}} to our hospital with abdominal pain and bleeding per rectum.

His partner volunteered further information regarding devient practice such as regular insertion of other foreign objects (e. g. shower hose). Tearing of the rectal mucosa following such practices is a recognised complication. However mortality following foreign body perforation is reported as extremely rare in the medical literature. Surgical repair of rectal perforation and intensive treatment did not prevent development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) hence leading to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and death.

40|$|The {{effects of}} optokinetic {{stimulation}} on the disorders of position {{sense in the}} horizontal and vertical planes were assessed in 24 patients with unilateral cerebral lesions (eight right brain-damaged patients with visuo-spatial hemineglect, eight right brain-damaged patients without neglect, eight left brain-damaged patients without neglect). In neglect patients, the position sense disorder was more severe, and affected by optokinetic stimulation in a direction-specific fashion. In both the horizontal and the vertical plane, and in both arms, <b>stimulation</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> direction of the movement contralateral {{to the side of}} the lesion improved the disorder, whereas <b>stimulation</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ipsilateral direction worsened the deficit.

During simultaneous vibration welding primary δ-ferrite can be refined and the morphologies of retained δ-ferrite become discontinuous so that δ-ferrite contents decrease. The smallest content of δ-ferrite (5. 5 %) occurred using the eccentric circulating vibrator. The diffraction intensities decreased and the FWHM widened with both vibration and no vibration. A residual stress can obviously be increased, producing an excellent effect on stress relief at a resonant frequency.

40|$|The {{effects of}} optokinetic {{stimulation}} on position sense disorders were investigated {{in a series}} of 30 patients with unilateral vascular lesions (10 right brain-damaged patients with visuo-spatial hemineglect, 10 right brain-damaged patients without visuo-spatial hemineglect, 10 left brain-damaged patients), and 10 control subjects. The position sense deficit was more severe in right brain-damaged patients with neglect, where both the contralateral and the ipsilateral arm were involved. Optokinetic stimulation was effective only in right brain-damaged patients <b>with</b> neglect: <b>stimulation</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> leftward movement (contralateral {{to the side of the}} hemispheric lesion) improved the position sense deficit, while <b>stimulation</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> rightward (ipsilateral) movement produced a worsening of the performance level. These findings suggest that in right brain-damaged patients with neglect the position sense deficit has a nonsensory component, related to neglect, which may be affected by optokinetic stimulation.

40|$|Ukrainian {{patent on}} {{invention}} No. 87369 The invention relates to a material separation method, substantially {{by means of}} screens, {{and can be used}} in the coal, metal mining, building ant other industries. The inventive method for resonance excitation of the screen sieving mesh involves statically tensioning the sieving mesh and exposing it to frequency vibration action. The static tension of the sieving mesh is stabilised in relation to the opposite displacements of the sides thereof and the vibration action is substantially performed in the plane of the sieving mesh transversally to the above-mentioned sides thereof. The inventive resonance screen comprises a bed connected to a frame, to which the sieving mesh is attached with the longitudinal sides thereof, and at least one vibrator. The frame is designed in the form of elements which are not linked to each other and are arranged on the opposite sides of the mesh, at least one of said elements being connected to the bed by means of at least one stabilising device {{in the form of an}} elastic element located in the plane of the mesh and being provided <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>vibrator...</b>|$|R
