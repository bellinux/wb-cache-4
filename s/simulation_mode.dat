500|$|Using the Ignite engine {{developed}} by Electronic Arts, NHL 17 features gameplay improvements {{in terms of}} artificial intelligence and physics. The game also features several game modes, including Hockey Ultimate Team (HUT), a trading card-based team building mode, the fan-favorite EA Sports Hockey League, an online co-operative play mode and a revamped version of [...] "Be a GM", a <b>simulation</b> <b>mode</b> where the player acts as a team's general manager, titled [...] "Franchise Mode", which now features team owners. New modes were also added, with key additions including the World Cup of Hockey tournament mode as well as Draft Champions, a fantasy draft spin-off of HUT. A newer Creation Zone is added into the game, featuring an expansive team builder {{as well as an}} arena creator. All 27 teams from the ECHL are also playable, for the first time. The game, similar to the past two NHL titles, features presentation {{in the style of the}} NHL on NBC.|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} Vasa, a configurable high-performance multiprocessor simulation {{package for the}} Virtutech Simics full-system simulator. Vasa includes models of multilevel caches, store buffers, interconnects and memory controllers and can model complex out-of-order SMT/CMPprocessors in great detail. However, {{it can also be}} run in two less detailed <b>simulation</b> <b>modes</b> being up to 287 times faster on average. We compare the simulation results from a 16 -way cache coherent multiprocessor system with four 4 -way SMT/CMP processors in the three <b>simulation</b> <b>modes.</b> Our results indicate that for many architectural studies, it is justifiable to run the simulations in a faster less detailed mode {{as long as it is}} not the behavior of the processor itself or the first level caches that is being studied...|$|R
40|$|Plasmons in {{two-dimensional}} systems find {{applications in}} terahertz oscillators, detectors, filters, plasmonic crystals, etc. Numerous approaches to modeling plasmonic spectra exists, but little {{work has been}} done to compare results from theoretical calculations with each other, and so to understand their limitations. Using three different techniques (full-wave <b>simulations,</b> <b>mode</b> matching, and trasmission-line model), we analyse here a realistic structure comprising three coupled plasmonic resonators. While the results of all three models offer qualitatively similar results, revealing a rich spectrum of coupled modes, the values of the predicted resonant frequencies differ between the models. The best agreement is found between full-wave <b>simulations</b> and <b>mode</b> matching, both of which are based on rigorous solution of Maxwell's equations...|$|R

5000|$|Arcade is a mode {{similar to}} most other racing video games.

This mode features up to 2-8 players {{and a variety of}} tracks that can be raced on 3, 5, or 7 lap segments. Newer players to the game will only be able to race in arcade mode until they unlock access to <b>simulation</b> <b>mode</b> tracks.|$|E

50|$|SBK-X {{features}} an intuitive mode named Arcade mode {{in which the}} player {{does not require the}} same precision and timing as in the <b>simulation</b> <b>modes.</b> The player also has at their disposal the boost button which enhances the speed of the motorcycle during straights. In this mode the player may enter in the Story mode, in which they have to accomplish some objectives including overtaking a number of adversaries or finishing at a certain position to complete.|$|R
30|$|In Figure 6 c, the NSLOC-based online <b>mode</b> <b>simulations</b> with HWC no filter/unsort/ 25 us options {{generate}} {{slightly less}} output spikes than the offline mode {{ones with the}} same filtering options. This means that the online <b>mode</b> <b>simulations</b> discard some input spikes in the SIM. However, they should not need to discard any spikes given that the offline <b>mode</b> <b>simulations</b> with the same options are able to run in real time (Figure 5 c). This happens because the prototype implementation was designed to keep the simulation moving forward even {{when there are no}} input spikes, so that the simulation achieves smoother arm trajectories. In order to do this, the callback function in the NSLOC-based online <b>mode</b> <b>simulation</b> checks the queue at very short intervals and forces NEURON to skip input spikes that are lagging behind real time. Therefore, the higher the input spike frequency is {{the more likely it is}} that some input spikes are behind the time the callback function is invoked. This explains why the three online <b>mode</b> <b>simulations</b> mentioned above, with a relatively high input spike frequency, have less output spikes than the equivalent corresponding offline <b>mode</b> <b>simulations.</b>|$|R

50|$|Gran Turismo 2 is {{fundamentally}} {{based on the}} racing game genre. The player must maneuver an automobile to compete against artificially intelligent drivers on various race tracks. The game uses two different modes: Arcade Mode and <b>Simulation</b> <b>Mode</b> (Gran Turismo Mode in PAL and Japanese versions). In the arcade mode, the player can freely choose vehicles they wish to use, and can enable damage. However, the <b>simulation</b> <b>mode</b> requires the player to earn driver's licenses, pay for vehicles, and earn trophies in order to unlock new courses. Gran Turismo 2 features nearly 650 automobiles and 27 racing tracks, including rally tracks.|$|E

Players can save their game via passcodes. As the game has the National Football League license, all 30 teams are represented in the game, and players can perform transactions between teams, as well as player substitutions.
