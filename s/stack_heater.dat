40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the use of}} micromachined lead zirconate titanate (PZT) piezoceramic elements for heat generation by ultrasonic energy dissipated within the elements and surrounding media. Simulations based on three-dimensional finite-element models suggest that circular disk-shaped elements provide superior steady-state temperature rise for a given cross-sectional area, volume of the PZT element and drive voltage. Experimental validation is performed using PZT- 5 A heaters of 3. 2 mm diameter and 0. 191 mm thickness. Single-element <b>heaters</b> and dual-element <b>stacks</b> are evaluated. Although the steady-state temperature generated by these heaters reaches the maximum value at the frequency of maximum electromechanical conductance, the heating effectiveness is maximized at the frequency of maximum electromechanical impedance. <b>Stacked</b> PZT <b>heaters</b> provide 3. 5 times the temperature rise and 3 times greater heating effectiveness than single elements. Furthermore, the heaters attain the maximum heating effectiveness when bonded to highly damping and non-conducting substrates. A maximum temperature of 120 °C is achieved at 160 mW input power. Experiments are performed using porcine tissue samples to show the feasibility of using PZT heaters in tissue cauterization.

40|$|A differential, membrane-based nanocalorimeter {{for general}} {{specific}} heat studies of very small samples, ranging from 0. 5 mg to sub-μg in mass, is described. The calorimeter operates over the temperature range from above room temperature down to 0. 5 K. It {{consists of a}} pair of cells, each of which is a <b>stack</b> of <b>heaters</b> and thermometer {{in the center of a}} silicon nitride membrane, in total giving a background heat capacity less than 100 nJ/K at 300 K, decreasing to 10 pJ/K at 1 K. The device has several distinctive features: i) The resistive thermometer, made of a Ge_ 1 -xAu_x alloy, displays a high dimensionless sensitivity |dlnR/dlnT | ≥ 1 over the entire temperature range. ii) The sample is placed in direct contact with the thermometer, which is allowed to self-heat. The thermometer can thus be operated at high dc current to increase the resolution. iii) Data are acquired with a set of eight synchronized lock-in amplifiers measuring dc, 1 st and 2 nd harmonic signals of heaters and thermometer. This gives high resolution and allows continuous output adjustments without additional noise. iv) Absolute accuracy is achieved via a variable-frequency-fixed-phase technique in which the measurement frequency is automatically adjusted during the measurements to account for the temperature variation of the sample heat capacity and the device thermal conductance. The performance of the calorimeter is illustrated by studying the heat capacity of a small Au sample and the specific heat of a 2. 6 μg piece of superconducting Pb in various magnetic fields.

40|$|Abstract. 3 D stacked chips {{have become}} a {{promising}} integration technology for modern systems. The complexity reached in multi-processor systems has increased the communication delays between processing cores, and {{an effective way to}} diminish this impact on communication is the 3 D integration technol-ogy and the use of through-silicon vias (TSVs) for inter-layer communication. However, 3 D chips present important ther- mal issues due to the presence of processing units with a high power density, which are not homogeneously dis-tributed in the stack. Also, the presence of hot-spots creates thermal gradients that impact negatively on the system reliability and relate with the leakage power consumption. Thus, new approaches for thermal control of 3 D chips are in great need. This paper discusses the use of a grid and non-uniform placement of TSVs as an effective mechanism for thermal balancing and control in 3 D chips. We have modelled the material layers and TSVs mathematically using a detailed calibration phase based on a real 5 -tier 3 D chip <b>stack,</b> where several <b>heaters</b> and sensors are manufactured to study the heat diffusion. The obtained results show interesting conclusions about thermal dissipation for 3 D chips with TSVs and outline new insights in the area of thermal modeling and optimiza-tion for 3 D chips by exploiting the inclusion of minimal percentages of TSVs in strategic positions of the layout. ...|$|R
40|$|This work {{explores the}} use of bulk micromachined {{piezoelectric}} transducers for ultrasonic heat generation. The work includes basic studies of the phenomenon, the development of simulation models, the design and fabrication of practical devices and interface circuits. The technology is demonstrated in two application contexts: cauterization with a biopsy needle, and stimulation of insect locomotion. Simulations based on three-dimensional finite element models, indicate that circular disc-shaped elements provide superior steady-state temperature rise for a given cross-sectional area, volume of the PZT element, and drive voltage. The heating is greatest at the frequency of maximum electromechanical conductance. The thermal efficiency is maximized at frequency of maximum electromechanical impedance. <b>Stacked</b> PZT <b>heaters</b> provide 3. 5 x the temperature rise and 3 x greater efficiency than single elements. A biopsy needle with an embedded array of four piezoceramic microheaters of 200 µm diameter and 70 - 80 µm thickness has been fabricated. The PZT- 5 A heaters generate the target temperature rise of 33 ˚C at the tissue-needle interface for an input power of < 325 mW and a drive voltage of < 17 VRMS when inserted into porcine tissue. The extent of tissue cauterization is < 1. 25 mm beyond {{the perimeter of the}} needle. Cauterization of porcine tissue sample results in a decrease of 600 kHz in the resonance frequency and 900 ohms in the peak impedance magnitude, allowing the extent of cauterization to be monitored easily. Interface circuits for measurement of resonance frequency shift due to cauterization and for actuation of PZT heaters are also described. Experiments have been conducted using piezothermal stimulators implanted near antennae of green June beetles (GJB), and {{on either side of the}} thorax of Madagascar hissing roaches and green diving beetles (GDB) to show the feasibility of locomotion control using microthermal stimulation. Thermal stimulation causes the insects to move away from the direction of the actuated stimulator. Thermal stimulation achieves an overall success rate of 80 %, 93. 5 % and 68 % in GJB, roaches and GDB, respectively. On average, thermal stimulation results in an angle turn of about 15 ˚- 18 ˚ on GJB, 30 ˚- 45 ˚ on the roaches and 15 ˚- 60 ˚ on GDB. The corresponding average input power is 360 mW, 330 mW and 100 mW for GJB, roach, and GDB, respectively...|$|R
40|$|The Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) {{fuel cell}} has been {{investigated}} for a long time, and {{is regarded as a}} new energy source for various applications, such as portable, stationary and automotive ones. However, due to the shortage of the infrastructure in the society, the high cost, the difficulty of the water/thermal management, etc., practical systems have not reached the general public, yet. Of these matters, the water/thermal management is a critical problem to obtain a high efficiency and durability of the systems. This is because the proton conductivity in the electrolyte made of membrane is strongly dependent on its humidity. Therefore, the systems are designed and operated to maintain high humidity inside the stack. However, high humidity may induce water condensation as well. The liquid water in the stack obstructs the reactant to reach the active sites, and reduces the performance of the stack. The water condensation leads to the increase of the heat loads in the radiator as well. Therefore, the analyses of the water/thermal balances, related to the operating and design parameters, in the components and at the system level are important. In these analyses, the study of the stack design to avoid large pressure drop and maldistribution is recently activated. However, the water/thermal balance at the system level has not deeply involved it yet. This thesis involves a study of the water/thermal balances at the component level and the system level and the interaction between them. One major concern of the current work is the analysis of the water/thermal balances in 100 kW class PEM fuel cell systems. The system consists of PEM fuel cell <b>stack,</b> compressor, intercooler, <b>heater,</b> humidifier, condenser and radiator. As a first step, the heat and mass balances in the intercooler and the design of the heat exchangers for it were conducted. As a second step, the heat and mass balances in the whole system were analyzed. The analysis was focused on the heat load in the heat exchangers related to the water recovery schemes. The study showed that the water recovery scheme without phase change would reduce the heat load in the heat exchangers and be able to simplify the system configuration. Another major concern is the analysis of the stack design concerning the pressure drop and the maldistribution. The considered design parameters were the size of manifold, the number and the turn of the flow channels on the bipolar plate. According to the study, it is found that the maldistribution can be eliminated by increasing the size of the manifold or reducing the number of flow channels in the bipolar plate. The water removing effect is also improved. However, in such cases, the pressure drop is large. The final part of the work analyses the influence of the stack design on the water/thermal balance in the whole system. The stack design influences the pressure drop and maldistribution. By involving the pressure drop in the stack, the heat load in the radiator is reduced about 5 %. This reduced heat is mostly shifted to the condenser for the water recovery. It corresponds to the 10 % increase in the heat load in the condenser. The design of the radiator and condenser must consider such shift of the heat load due to the pressure drop in the stack. A future study is highlighted which will contribute to the introduction of PEM fuel cell system to the general public...|$|R
