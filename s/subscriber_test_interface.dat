The aim of {{this project}} {{is to build a}} flexible <b>test</b> <b>interface</b> and grading service module for ClassTA Course Management System (CMS). Most CMS has similar features in their <b>test</b> <b>interface</b> and grading module. However, most of them also shared common issues such as how to design a responsive yet easy to use <b>test</b> <b>interface</b> and grading service, how to minimizing the possibility of cheating, and how to enhance students' learning experience. The newly <b>test</b> <b>interface</b> and grading service are built with consideration to tackle the known issues above. AJAX is used as a based technology for this project. It is chosen because of its capability to communicate with the server asynchronously and allowing part of the web page to be updated without having to reload the entire page, thus creating a fast and responsive <b>test</b> <b>interface</b> and grading services. Moreover, to make it easy to use, the basic interface uses icons and simple drag and drop feature. New <b>test</b> <b>interface</b> is developed for students to take the different types of available tests such as In-Class Test, Online Test, and Self-Graded Test. In-Class test is unique feature developed to minimize cheating possibility. It is a type of hybrid test where students take the test in the class and later on submit their answers online. New <b>test</b> <b>interface</b> has options for teacher to display one question in one page or display all questions in a page. To provide a better learning experience for students, it also has features that allowing students to check their grades, review test result and solution, and submit difficulty rating of a question in the test. The grading service is built for faculties to provide an advance and flexible grading system. With the new grading service, faculties can perform manual grading or automatic regrading process in many different ways, including options to use or ignore manual changes in re-grading process. New statistics, histogram, and comments for survey and regular test also provided for faculties to track the class performance...|$|R

40|$|It {{is common}} for {{computer}} science curricula to include a course on data structures and algorithm analysis following a two-semester sequence that covers the fundamentals of computer programming. Emphasis in such a course may {{be placed on the}} mathematical techniques of algorithm analysis or on the design and implementation of algorithms that perform fundamental operations on the underlying data structures. For instructors who prefer an emphasis on implementation, this paper describes a sequence of four laboratory projects that reinforce learning about fundamental operations on common data structures, about trade-offs between flexibility and efficiency, and about the techniques of abstraction, implementation-hiding, and code re-use in the object-oriented approach to software development. The four projects are centered on implementing the following structures: general-purpose lists, priority queues, general trees, and undirected graphs. These projects are consistent with the organization of most standard textbooks for courses on data structures and algorithms. Each project has three components: an abstract definition of a data structure definition, and a graphical user <b>interface</b> for <b>testing</b> the implementation. In the simplest delivery of each project, the instructor provides the abstract definition and the <b>testing</b> <b>interface,</b> and the student is responsible for supplying the concrete class that implements definitions. Java is used as the development language for the projects presented here. The graphical <b>testing</b> <b>interfaces</b> use Java Swing classes. Depending on how the <b>testing</b> <b>interfaces</b> are presented to the students, these projects may also provide an introduction to the coding of graphical user interfaces...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} results of a study {{associated}} with Task 8. 4 b of the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Project 12 - 77 Structural Concrete Design with High-Strength Steel Reinforcement. The objective of the study is to evaluate the effects of the use of high-strength steel reinforcement in shear friction applications. Shear friction is the mechanism present when shear is transferred across an interface between two concrete members that can slip relative to one another. It arises from the roughness of the interface and the clamping force created by the steel reinforcement across it. The study was accomplished by testing typical push-off specimens with a cold joint <b>test</b> <b>interface,</b> which had a surface roughness with at least ¼-inch amplitude in order to simulate the connection between a composite slab and an AASHTO girder. The parameters measured during the tests were the magnitude of the shear load, the shear displacement or "slip" parallel to the <b>test</b> <b>interface,</b> the crack width perpendicular to the <b>test</b> <b>interface,</b> and the strain in the steel reinforcement across the <b>test</b> <b>interface.</b> The <b>test</b> results showed that the shear friction mechanism occurs in stages and that the concrete component contributes to the majority of the shear friction capacity; the steel component develops only after significant cracking. In other words, the concrete and steel components of the shear friction mechanism do not act simultaneously as implied by current design standards. In addition, the test results showed that, contrary to the assumptions of the AASHTO and ACI equations to calculate the shear friction capacity of concrete members, the interface steel reinforcement never reaches its yield strain. Therefore, the use of high-strength reinforcing steel does not affect the shear friction capacity of concrete members because the clamping force {{that is part of the}} shear friction mechanism is a function of the elastic modulus of the steel rather than its yield strength. Based on these findings and using the experimental data from current and previous tests an alternative equation is proposed for the calculation of the shear friction capacity of reinforced concrete members...|$|R
