40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the modelling of gear rattle in Roots blower vacuum pumps. Analysis of experimental data reveals that the source of the noise and vibration problem is the backlash nonlinearity due to gear teeth losing and re-establishing contact. We derive simple non-smooth models for the lightly damped, lightly loaded dynamics of the pump. The models include a time-dependent forcing term which arises from the eccentric mounting of the gears acting at the gross rotation rate. We use a combination of explicit construction, asymptotic methods and numerical techniques to classify complicated dynamic behaviour in realistic parametric regimes. We first present a linear analysis of permanent-contact motions, and derive upper bounds on eccentricity for silent operation. We then develop a nonlinear analysis of ‘backlash oscillations’, where the gears lose and re-establish contact, corresponding to noisy pump operation. We show that noisy solutions can coexist with silent ones, explaining why geared systems can rattle intermittently. Finally, we consider possible design solutions, and <b>show</b> <b>implications</b> for pump design in terms of existence and stability of solutions. <br/...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{composition}} question for bounded-error randomized query complexity: Is R(f circ g) = Omega(R(f) R(g)) ? We show that inserting a simple function h, whose query complexity is onlyTheta(log R(g)), in between f and g {{allows us to}} prove R(f circ h circ g) = Omega(R(f) R(h) R(g)). We prove this using a new lower bound measure for randomized query complexity we call randomized sabotage complexity, RS(f). Randomized sabotage complexity has several desirable properties, such as a perfect composition theorem, RS(f circ g) >= RS(f) RS(g), and a composition theorem with randomized query complexity, R(f circ g) = Omega(R(f) RS(g)). It is also a quadratically tight lower bound for total functions and can be quadratically superior to the partition bound, the best known general lower bound for randomized query complexity. Using this technique we also <b>show</b> <b>implications</b> for lifting theorems in communication complexity.

The first two mentioned factors in turn are influenced by external variables.

40|$|The {{development}} of virtual sponsored communities has created great possibilities {{for people and}} companies to interact on shared platforms. To create interaction in the community, {{it is essential to}} create the perception of trustworthiness of the community. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine which concepts of trust-building constitute the perception of trustworthiness of virtual sponsored communities. A theoretical framework based on previous studies on trust-building in virtual communities is used to provide the basis for our empirical studies. The paper examines the virtual sponsored community of an online video game, World of Warcraft, with both quantitative surveys and qualitative netnographical observations to determine the important concepts which affect the perception of trustworthiness of the community from the perspectives of the sponsor and the gamers. Our findings show that the concepts of quality content, privacy policy, interaction, knowledge growth, satisfaction, embeddedness, shared value and perceived responsiveness constitute the perception of trustworthiness of the virtual sponsored community.

40|$|The Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) is a {{fundamental}} property of a matrix enabling sparse recovery [5]. Informally, an m ×n matrix satisfies RIP of order k in the ℓ p norm if ∥[*]Ax[*]∥[*] p [*]≈[*]∥[*]x[*]∥[*] p for any vector x that is k-sparse, i. e., that has at most k non-zeros. The minimal number of rows m necessary for the property to hold has been extensively investigated, and tight bounds are known. Motivated by signal processing models, a recent work of Baraniuk et al [3] has generalized this notion to the case where the support of x must belong to a given model, i. e., a given family of supports. This more general notion is much less understood, especially for norms other than ℓ 2. In this paper we present tight bounds for the model-based RIP property in the ℓ 1 norm.

40|$|Industry {{is a major}} {{contributor}} to carbon emissions in China, and industrial land is an important input to industrial production. Therefore, a detailed analysis of the carbon emission performance of industrial land use is necessary for making reasonable carbon reduction policies that promote the sustainable use of industrial land. This paper aims to analyze the dynamic changes in the total-factor carbon emission performance of industrial land use (TCPIL) in China by applying a global directional distance function (DDF) and non-radial Luenberger productivity index. The empirical results show that the eastern region enjoys better TCPIL than the central and western regions, but the regional gaps in TCPIL are narrowing. The growth in NLCPILs (non-radial Luenberger carbon emission performance of industrial land use) in the eastern and central regions is mainly driven by technological progress, whereas efficiency improvements contribute more to the growth of NLCPIL in the western region. The provinces in the eastern region have the most innovative and environmentally-friendly production technologies. The results of the analysis of the influencing factors <b>show</b> <b>implications</b> for improving the NLCPIL, including more investment in industrial research and development (R&D), the implementation of carbon emission reduction policies, reduction in the use of fossil energy, especially coal, in the process of industrial production, actively learning about foreign advanced technology, properly solving the problem of surplus labor in industry and the expansion of industrial development...|$|E
