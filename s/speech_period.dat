30|$|This study {{presents}} a DNN-based VAD method {{for improving the}} performance of VAD by introducing dynamics, which may be highlighted by <b>speech</b> <b>period</b> candidates. These candidates are derived from heuristic rules based on {{the first and second}} derivatives of the log power spectrum of the RSF output (LPS-RSF). The <b>speech</b> <b>period</b> candidates are calculated for individual subbands and are then input into a DNN together with the log power spectra to generate the VAD decision. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we perform experiments using clean and noisy speech signals smeared with five types of noise, namely, white, babble, factory, car, and pink, with SNRs of 10, 5, 0 and −[*] 5 dB. The proposed method effectively detects speech and non-speech periods. The experimental results show that the VAD performance based on log power spectra are improved after combining the log power spectra with the <b>speech</b> <b>period</b> candidates, particularly for noisy speech signals with low SNRs and non-stationary cases. The addition of dynamics expressed by the <b>speech</b> <b>period</b> candidates provides positive information that contributes to the detection of speech periods.|$|E

30|$|Voice {{activity}} detection (VAD) is {{an important}} preprocessing step for various speech applications to identify speech and non-speech periods in input signals. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network (DNN)-based VAD method for detecting such periods in noisy signals using speech dynamics, which are time-varying speech signals that may be expressed as the first- and second-order derivatives of mel cepstra, {{also known as the}} delta and delta-delta features. Unlike these derivatives, in this paper, the dynamics are highlighted by <b>speech</b> <b>period</b> candidates, which are calculated based on heuristic rules for the patterns of the first and second derivatives of the input signals. These candidates, together with the log power spectra, are input into the DNN to obtain VAD decisions. In this study, experiments are conducted to compare the proposed method with a DNN-based method, which exclusively utilizes log power spectra by using speech signals smeared with five types of noise (white, babble, factory, car, and pink) with signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of 10, 5, 0, and −[*] 5 dB. The experimental results show that the proposed method is superior under all the considered noise conditions, indicating that the <b>speech</b> <b>period</b> candidates improve the log power spectra.|$|E
30|$|In this work, {{the input}} signals are sampled at 8 kHz. The frame size is 20 ms, and the {{analysis}} window is a Hamming {{window with a}} 10 -ms frame shift. After the RSF filtering process, the LPS-RSF is calculated for an individual subband using Eq. (3). Next, {{the first and second}} derivatives for each subband are calculated using Eqs. (4) and (5). These derivatives are used to obtain the starting and ending point candidates in accordance with rules (i) and (ii). After the conversion of the starting and ending point candidates from the sparse representation to the masks, the masks are multiplied by the spectra, expressed in decimal form to obtain <b>speech</b> <b>period</b> candidates. Then, the DNN is applied to the <b>speech</b> <b>period</b> candidates in combination with the log power spectra derived from Eq. (2). This combination (i.e., the dynamic features) is fed to the DNN to obtain the final VAD decision regarding the speech periods. The dynamic features are normalized to zero mean and unit variance in each dimension. To train the DNN, we use five RBMs. These RBMs are stacked together, and the number of neurons for each RBM is 200, 200, 200, 200, and 100, in sequence.

40|$|Abstract—Admission {{control is}} a key issue for quality of service (QoS) {{provisioning}} in both wired and wireless communication networks. Providing QoS for voice traffic transmission over packet-based network is a crucial task, which requires development of accurate resource estimation models. In order to perform bandwidth saving and improve the naturalness of the voice service contemporary voice coding schemes are equipped with the functionality of voice activity detection and background noise transmission during inactive <b>speech</b> <b>periods.</b> The adoption of traditional ON-OFF traffic model may cause significant errors in estimating the bandwidth required to meet the performance bounds of aggregated traffic flow. The aim {{of this article is}} to present a “new paradigm ” of call admission control (CAC) dimensioning applicable to wireless access transmission media. The admission decision policy is codec-dependent and relies on the concept of user-perceived voice quality, since it could provide a tight connection with the QoS metrics that shall be guaranteed by the network.

30|$|Because {{background}} noise is a challenging problem, selecting {{features that are}} discriminative for properties of speech and noise is {{an important aspect of}} the design of VAD algorithms [5]. In prior studies, simple acoustic features such as energy and zero crossing rates have been used to detect <b>speech</b> <b>periods</b> [6]. This type of technique is suitable for clean signals, and its performance is degraded under low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Hence, various modifications of energy-based features, such as those described in [1, 7], have been proposed to improve the VAD performance. Other acoustic features have also been examined and investigated to improve the VAD performance. For example, the VAD algorithm proposed in [8] measures the long-term spectral divergence between speech and noise. Periodic to aperiodic component ratios were employed in [9]. Pek et al. [10] used modulation indices of the modulation spectra of speech data. Kinnunen and Rajad [11] introduced likelihood ratio-based VAD method in which speech and non-speech models are trained on an utterance-by-utterance basis using mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs). Sohn et al. [12] proposed a method based on a Gaussian statistical model, in which a decision rule is derived from the mean of the likelihood ratios for individual frequency bands by assuming that the noise is known a priori. Davis et al. [13] proposed a scheme that incorporates a low-variance spectrum estimation technique and a method for determining an adaptive threshold based on noise statistics. These methods perform well under stationary noise; however, their performances are degraded under non-stationary noise. To improve the performance of VAD, machine learning methods have been explored. For instance, support vector machine (SVM) methods [14 – 16] and deep neural networks (DNNs) [17 – 19] {{have been found to be}} highly competitive with traditional VAD.|$|R

Whether there are gender differences, either {{on the part of the}} provider or the recipient, in this social support effect is explored. Such differences might shed some light on the frequent epidemiological reports of gender differences in social support and health. Methods: Male and female subjects gave an impromptu speech and received either standardized supportive or nonsupportive feedback from a male or female confederate. Blood pressure and heart rate were monitored continuously during baseline and <b>speech</b> <b>periods.</b> Results: Speakers with a supportive female audience showed a systolic increase of 25 mm Hg over baseline. Those with a nonsupportive female audience increased 36 mm Hg. A supportive male audience led to increases of 32 mm Hg, and a nonsup-portive male audience 28 mm Hg. There was no significant effect of gender of subject. Conclusions: Results indicate that social support provided by women reduced cardiovascular changes for both male and female speakers compared with presence of a nonsupportive female audience. Social support from men did not. These findings suggest a possible mechanism that might help explain the epidemiological literature on the relationship between gender, social support, and health. The findings are consistent with the notion that married men are healthier because they marry women. Women do not profit as much from marriage or suffer as much from separation, in terms of health outcomes, because the support they gain or lose is the less effective support of a man. These findings render more plausible the possibility that differences in social support might contribute to health differences, through the dampening of cardiovascular responses to stress.
