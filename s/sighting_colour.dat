These are tools aimed at changing {{the way in which}} a user works with a system with the intention of reducing barriers to interaction. Issues that are known to create interaction difficulties include blindness or partial <b>sight,</b> <b>colour</b> blindness, deafness, and the physical inability to work with input devices such as keyboards and mice. In some cases, a distinct impairment may be possible to identify and correct for. In others, a more subtle interaction of minor ailments may make it difficult to identify a single causative factor and subsequently complicate the search for an appropriate solution.|$|R

30|$|Participants in the FGD {{identified}} the main challenges in achieving clean milk production and marketing as (i) insufficient water availability during the camel milking process, (ii) milk contamination arising from saliva of the calf during suckling to initiate milk letdown prior to milking and (iii) use of plastic containers for milking, storage and transportation that {{are generally not}} easy to clean and therefore cause milk spoilage, despite washing with hot water. The use of overnight milk cooling facilities was limited to a few camel keepers {{who were able to}} transport evening milk to Isiolo town where such facilities were available. Different types of milk quality testing methods were used by producers and traders in Isiolo County. The results show most producers and milk traders in both systems (85.7 % for pastoral and 100 % for peri-urban system) use subjective assessments of taste and <b>sight</b> (<b>colour</b> of milk) for hygiene and quality indicators.|$|R

40|$|Due to {{constraints}} {{in various}} browsers and multimedia players people can experience difficulty using the World Wide Web. This {{is particularly true}} {{for people with disabilities}} who use assistive technologies that can be even more restricted in accessing Web content. This can have greater consequences, such as inaccessible education and lack of access to information in general. Also, access to Web content is sometimes more critical for people with disabilities who can make use of particular digital media only because they are print-disabled. Finally, Web sites created accessible are more usable to non-disabled users as they are more easily navigable and can be used by non-graphical desktop browsers. Particularly affected people with disabilities are visually impaired (blind, short or long <b>sighted,</b> <b>colour</b> blind, tunnel vision sufferers), dyslexic, and people with motor disabilities who are not able to use a mouse. One of disabilities that are most likely to affect Web access is visual impairment. Visually impaired users have difficulties with pages having images without alternative text, especially if images are used as links (as are in image maps). Other common problems are: using structural elements for page layout (using heading mark-ups for making things written in bigger or different type-face), non-described multimedia (no alternative text for sounds and videos), non-existent alternative for finding pages by browsers unable to render frames and scripting languages, non-described tables, poor colour contrast and badly chosen colours for colour blind users. As libraries are intended to provide equal access to information for all, our intention was to determine to what extent Croatian public libraries really ensure access to content provided on their Web pages. To that purpose, W 3 Câ€™s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1. 0 have been used to compare the sites with the recommended guidelines. Libraries should provide accessible Web sites, as well as promote Web content accessibility in the community...|$|R

6000|$|Impersonal emotion! And what--I thought do I mean by that? Surely I mean: That is not Art, which, while I, am contemplating it, inspires me {{with any}} active or {{directive}} impulse; that is Art, when, for however brief a moment, it replaces within me interest in myself by interest in itself. For, let me suppose {{myself in the}} presence of a carved marble bath. If my thoughts be [...] "What could I buy that for?" [...] Impulse of acquisition; or: [...] "From what quarry did it come?" [...] Impulse of inquiry; or: [...] "Which would be the right end for my head?" [...] Mixed impulse of inquiry and acquisition--I am at that moment insensible to it as a work of Art. But, if I stand before it vibrating at <b>sight</b> of its <b>colour</b> and forms, if ever so little and for ever so short a time, unhaunted by any definite practical thought or impulse--to that extent and for that moment it has stolen me away out of myself and put itself there instead; has linked me to the universal by making me forget the individual in me. And for that moment, and only while that moment lasts, it is to me a work of Art.

[...] "Do not die just yet: {{you must}} not die--not wholly die--until you have heard what I {{have to say to}} you.

Only, when I finish, make some sign--a sigh, a {{movement}} of the eyelid, a twitch of the lips, even in the small corners of the mouth; nothing more than that, just to show that you have heard, and I shall be satisfied. Remember all the years that I have been your protector, and this long journey that I have taken on your account; also all that I did for your sainted mother before she died at Voa, {{to become one of the}} most important of those who surround the Queen of Heaven, and who, when they wish for any favour, have only to say half a word to get it. And do not cast in oblivion that at the last I obeyed your wish and brought you safely to Riolama. It is true that in some small things I deceived you; but that must not weigh with you, because it is a small matter and not worthy of mention when you consider the claims I have on you. In your hands, Rima, I leave everything, relying on the promise you made me, and on my services. Only one word of caution remains to be added. Do not let the magnificence of the place you are now about to enter, the new <b>sights</b> and <b>colours,</b> and the noise of shouting, and musical instruments and blowing of trumpets, put these things out of your head. Nor must you begin to think meanly of yourself and be abashed when you find yourself surrounded by saints and angels; for you are not less than they, although it may not seem so at first when you see them in their bright clothes, which, they say, shine like the sun. I cannot ask you to tie a string round your finger; I can only trust to your memory, which was always good, even about the smallest things; and when you are asked, as no doubt you will be, to express a wish, remember before everything to speak of your grandfather, and his claims on you, also on your angelic mother, to whom you will present my humble remembrances." ...|$|R
40|$|The most {{impressive}} {{sight in the}} Geyser Valley at wairakei it the Champagne Cauldron, so named because of the exquisite sparkle of its ever-boiling contents. The huge opening in the ground is 83 feet in depth, and measures 60 feet by 80 feet from lip to lip. Some idea {{of the size of}} its steam-cloud may be estimated by comparing its volume with the figure on the cliff. There is a flight of steps from the main track, leading to the eminence on which he stands. The water in the boiling pool is a delicious blue of wonderful transparency, that lends additional brilliance to the constant effervescence. The water issues from the solid rock, and its overflow finds its way into the Wairakei River, creating in its journey a sinter path of delicate, creamy ripples, dashed with white and silver grey. The Cauldron boils up at times to a height of ten or twelve feet, emitting fearful sounds, and throwing off overpowering clouds of scalding steam, that appal the spectators. It is estimated that the perpendicular back of the blow-out must reach nearly 100 feet. The pool is truly a magnificent <b>sight.</b> Its dominant <b>colour</b> is a luminous blue, transparent in spite of its ebullition, and as the dazzling foam rises steadily upwards, it mounts into a pyramid of white effervescence. From this pyramidal mass of froth, waves break away, and descend in quick succession down the sinister slope. Around the Cauldron is a thick fringe of shrubbery, that is partly hidden amidst the clouds of steam. The sides of t he valley are clothed with the beautiful variety of manuka that forms one of the many charms of this beautiful valley...|$|R
60|$|First, all {{the simple}} ideas {{we have are}} {{confined}} (as I have shown) to those we receive from corporeal objects by sensation, and from the operations of our own minds as the objects of reflection. But how much these few and narrow inlets are disproportionate to the vast whole extent of all beings, will not be hard to persuade {{those who are not}} so foolish as to think their span the measure of all things. What other simple ideas it is possible the creatures {{in other parts of the}} universe may have, by the assistance of senses and faculties more or perfecter than we have, or different from ours, it is not for us to determine. But to say or think there are no such, because we conceive nothing of them, is no better an argument than if a blind man should be positive in it, that there was no such thing as <b>sight</b> and <b>colours,</b> because he had no manner of idea of any such thing, nor could by any means frame to himself any notions about seeing. The ignorance and darkness that is in us no more hinders nor confines the knowledge that is in others, than the blindness of a mole is an argument against the quicksightedness of an eagle. He that will consider the infinite power, wisdom, and goodness of the Creator of all things will find reason to think it was not all laid out upon so inconsiderable, mean, and impotent a creature as he will find man to be; who in all probability is one of the lowest of all intellectual beings. What faculties, therefore, other species of creatures have to penetrate into the nature and inmost constitutions of things; what ideas they may receive of them far different from ours, we know not. This we know and certainly find, that we want several other views of them besides those we have, to make discoveries of them more perfect. And we may be convinced that the ideas we can attain to by our faculties are very disproportionate to things themselves, when a positive, clear, distinct one of substance itself, which is the foundation of all the rest, is concealed from us. But want of ideas of this kind, being a part as well as cause of our ignorance, cannot be described. Only this I think I may confidently say of it, That the intellectual and sensible world are in this perfectly alike: that that part which we see of either of them holds no proportion with what we see not; and whatsoever we can reach with our eyes or our thoughts of either of them is but a point, almost nothing in comparison of the the rest.|$|R
60|$|We {{were none}} of us very cheerful now at the farm. Even Ukridge's spirit was a little daunted by the bills which poured in by every post. It {{was as if the}} tradesmen of the {{neighbourhood}} had formed a league, and were working in concert. Or it may have been due to thought-waves. Little accounts came not in single spies but in battalions. The popular demand for the <b>sight</b> of the <b>colour</b> of his money grew daily. Every morning at breakfast he would give us fresh bulletins of the state of mind of each of our creditors, and thrill us with the announcement that Whiteley's were getting cross, and Harrod's jumpy or that the bearings of Dawlish, the grocer, were becoming overheated. We lived in a continual atmosphere of worry. Chicken and nothing but chicken at meals, and chicken and nothing but chicken between meals had frayed our nerves. An air of defeat hung over the place. We were a beaten side, and we realised it. We had been playing an uphill game for nearly two months, and the strain was beginning to tell. Ukridge became uncannily silent. Mrs. Ukridge, though she did not understand, I fancy, the details of the matter, was worried because Ukridge was. Mrs. Beale had long since been turned into a soured cynic by the lack of chances vouchsafed her for the exercise of her art. And as for me, I have never since spent so profoundly miserably a week. I was not even permitted the anodyne of work. There seemed to be nothing to do on the farm. The chickens were quite happy, and only asked to be let alone and allowed to have their meals at regular intervals. And every day one or more of their number would vanish into the kitchen, Mrs. Beale would serve up the corpse in some cunning disguise, and we would try to delude ourselves into the idea that it was something altogether different.|$|R
60|$|The {{principle}} {{that ought to}} determine the position, apparent size, and architecture of a house, viz. {{that it should be}} so constructed, and (if large) so much of it hidden, as to admit of its being gently incorporated into the scenery of Nature--should also determine its colour. Sir Joshua Reynolds used to say, 'If you would fix upon the best colour for your house, turn up a stone, or pluck up a handful of grass by the roots, and see what is the colour of the soil where the house is to stand, and let that be your choice.' Of course, this precept given in conversation, could not have been meant to be taken literally. For example, in Low Furness, where the soil, from its strong impregnation with iron, is universally of a deep red, if this rule were strictly followed, the house also must be of a glaring red; in other places it must be of a sullen black; which would only be adding annoyance to annoyance. The rule, however, as a general guide, is good; and, in agricultural districts, where large tracts of soil are laid bare by the plough, particularly if (the face of the country being undulating) they are held up to view, this rule, though not to be implicitly adhered to, should never be lost <b>sight</b> of;--the <b>colour</b> of the house ought, if possible, to have a cast or shade of the colour of the soil. The principle is, that the house must harmonise with the surrounding landscape: accordingly, in mountainous countries, with still more confidence may it be said, 'look at the rocks and those parts of the mountains where the soil is visible, and they will furnish a safe direction.' Nevertheless, it will often happen that the rocks may bear so large a proportion {{to the rest of the}} landscape, and may be of such a tone of colour, that the rule may not admit, even here, of being implicitly followed. For instance, the chief defect in the colouring of the Country of the Lakes (which is most strongly felt in the summer season) is an over-prevalence of a bluish tint, which the green of the herbage, the fern, and the woods, does not sufficiently counteract. If a house, therefore, should stand where this defect prevails, I have no hesitation in saying, that the colour of the neighbouring rocks would not be the best that could be chosen. A tint ought to be introduced approaching nearer to those which, in the technical language of painters, are called warm: this, if happily selected, would not disturb, but would animate the landscape. How often do we see this exemplified upon a small scale by the native cottages, in cases where the glare of white-wash has been subdued by time and enriched by weather-stains! No harshness is then seen; but one of these cottages, thus coloured, will often form a central point to a landscape by which the whole shall be connected, and an influence of pleasure diffused over all the objects that compose the picture. But where the cold blue tint of the rocks is enriched by the iron tinge, the colour cannot be too closely imitated; and it will be produced of itself by the stones hewn from the adjoining quarry, and by the mortar, which may be tempered with the most gravelly part of the soil. The pure blue gravel, from the bed of the river, is, however, more suitable to the mason's purpose, who will probably insist also that the house must be covered with rough-cast, otherwise it cannot be kept dry; if this advice be taken, the builder of taste will set about contriving such means as may enable him to come the nearest to the effect aimed at.|$|R
