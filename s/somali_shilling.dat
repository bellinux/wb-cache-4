5|$|Owing {{to a lack}} of {{confidence}} in the local currency, the US dollar is widely accepted as a medium of exchange alongside the <b>Somali</b> <b>shilling.</b> Dollarization notwithstanding, the large issuance of the <b>Somali</b> <b>shilling</b> has increasingly fueled price hikes, especially for low value transactions.

5|$|In the {{autonomous}} northwestern Somaliland region, the Somaliland Shilling {{was used as}} currency. It was not recognized as legal tender by the international community, and had no official exchange rate. It was regulated by the Bank of Somaliland, the enclave's central bank. Although the separatist authorities in Somaliland attempted to bar usage of the <b>Somali</b> <b>shilling,</b> Somalia's official currency remained the preferred means of exchange for many peoples in the region.|$|E
25|$|In October 2008, {{the daily}} labor rate was {{estimated}} at 157,500 <b>Somali</b> <b>shillings</b> (approximately $4.50), up from 52,000 shillings (approximately $2.21) in January 2008, while kilogram of red rice rose from 14,170 (approximately $0.61) to 46,000 (approximately $1.31). A liter of diesel cost 43,000 shillings (approximately $1.23) and a camel costs over 15 million shillings (approximately $435). Total cereal production as of 2008 {{was estimated to be}} 780MT.|$|R
5|$|Rival {{producers}} of <b>Somali</b> <b>shillings</b> emerged after 1991. These included the Na shilling, which failed to gain widespread acceptance, and the Balweyn I and II, which were forgeries of pre-1991 bank notes. A competition for seigniorage drove {{the value of}} the money down to about $0.04 per SoSh (1000) note, approximately the commodity cost. Consumers have refused to accept bills larger than the 1991 denominations, which has helped stop the devaluation from spiraling further. The pre-1991 notes and the subsequent forgeries are treated as the same currency. It takes large bundles to make cash purchases.|$|R
40|$|Economists {{commonly}} {{appeal to}} sovereign powers {{to explain the}} acceptance of unbacked paper money at a positive value. The government accepts or compels taxes to be paid in the money (makes it publicly receivable) or compels creditors to accept it (grants and enforces legal tender status). Thus fiat money is thought to rely on enforcement of a literal fiat or decree. The case of Somalia defies such an account. Following the state’s collapse in 1991, unbacked paper <b>Somali</b> <b>shillings</b> continued to circulate at a positive value. We explain how historical acceptance, or “inertia, ” can sustain the ongoing acceptance of unbacked money {{even in the absence}} of ongoing sovereign support. Although sovereign power might be necessary to launch a fiat standard, we conclude that it is not a necessary condition for its survival...|$|R
25|$|Somalia's newly {{established}} Transitional Federal Government revived the defunct Central Bank of Somalia {{in the late}} 2000s. In terms of financial management, the monetary authority {{is in the process}} of assuming the task of both formulating and implementing monetary policy.

25|$|The <b>Somali</b> <b>shilling</b> {{has been}} the {{currency}} of parts of Somalia since 1921, when the East African shilling {{was introduced to the}} former British Somaliland protectorate. Following independence in 1960, the somalo of Italian Somaliland and the East African shilling (which were equal in value) were replaced at par in 1962 by the <b>Somali</b> <b>shilling.</b> Names used for the denominations were cent, centesimo (plural: centesimi) and سنت (plurals: سنتيمات and سنتيما) together with shilling, scellino (plural: scellini) and شلن.|$|E

5|$|The {{relatively}} stable {{value of the}} currency in the 1990s compared to the 1980s is explained by Peter D. Little in Somalia: Economy without a State as resulting {{from the lack of}} a central government printing currency to pay for civil and military expenditures. Traders avoid the need to carry large amounts of <b>Somali</b> <b>shillings</b> by converting them to U.S. dollars and then wiring them to money houses in Somalia. Because identification can be easily forged, those seeking to pick up wired money are required to answer questions about their clan and kinship relations. Private remittance companies known as hawala assist in the transfer of money. One of the largest such companies, Al Barakaat, was shut down in 2001 by a U.S.-led initiative due to alleged terrorist ties; the company's communications business, with more than 40,000 subscribers, was also shut down.|$|R
25|$|On 22 October, Maalin {{fell ill}} with fever and headache, and {{received}} malaria treatment in hospital. After {{four days a}} rash appeared. Perhaps working {{on the assumption that}} he had been successfully vaccinated against smallpox, Maalin was then believed to have chickenpox and was discharged from hospital. Over the next few days, his symptoms developed to indicate smallpox as the cause. Not wishing to be put into isolation, Maalin failed to report himself. On 30 October, a male nurse colleague reported him, possibly for the reward of 200 <b>Somali</b> <b>shillings</b> (around $35), and Maalin was transferred to the isolation camp. He was diagnosed with an infection of the Variola minor strain of smallpox, based on his symptoms and later confirmed by laboratory tests. The date of diagnosis is sometimes stated as 26 October 1977. Maalin did not experience complications, and subsequently recovered fully and was discharged in late November.|$|R

25|$|With a {{significant}} improvement in local security, Somali expatriates began returning to the country for investment opportunities. Coupled with modest foreign investment, the inflow of funds have helped the <b>Somali</b> <b>shilling</b> increase considerably in value. By March 2014, the currency had appreciated by almost 60% against the U.S. dollar over the previous 12 months. The <b>Somali</b> <b>shilling</b> was the strongest among the 175 global currencies traded by Bloomberg, rising close to 50 percentage points higher than the next most robust global currency over the same period.|$|E
25|$|The {{currency}} of the Trusteeship was the somalo. It was coined by the Bank of Italy for the Cassa per la Circolazione Monetaria della Somalia (the Trusteeship's central bank). The Somalo was replaced in 1962 with the <b>Somali</b> <b>shilling.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Somaliland {{shilling}} is {{the official}} currency of Somaliland, a self-declared republic that is internationally recognised as an autonomous region of Somalia.

25|$|The East African {{shilling}} was {{in use in}} the British {{colonies and}} protectorates of British Somaliland, Kenya, Tanganyika, Uganda and Zanzibar from 1920, when it replaced the rupee, until after those countries became independent, and in Tanzania after that country was formed by the merger of Tanganyika and Zanzibar in 1964. Upon independence in 1960, the East African shilling in the State of Somaliland (former British Somaliland) and the Somali somalo in the Trust Territory of Somalia (former Italian Somaliland) were replaced by the <b>Somali</b> <b>shilling.</b>|$|E
25|$|Hargeisa Taxi {{is another}} of the recent taxi firms based in Hargeisa. It has a fleet of four small compact cars and seven {{passenger}} minivans, in addition to around 19 other vehicles. GPS devices installed by the Sahal Technology firm allow the cab company's dispatch office to monitor its taxis {{to ensure that they}} travel within the speed limit. The office can also disable the vehicles online in the event of theft. Other new taxi firms serving Hargeisa include Dalhis Taxi and Marodi Jeh Taxi. Fares are inexpensive, costing between 15,000 and 18,000 Somaliland shillings ($2–$3 USD) per ride, with the national <b>Somali</b> <b>shilling</b> also widely accepted.|$|E
25|$|The {{shilling}} {{was also}} used in parts {{of what is now}} Somalia, Ethiopia, and Eritrea when they were under British control. Before 1941, these areas, then known as Italian East Africa, were using the Italian East African lira. In 1941, as a result of World War II, Britain regained control and introduced the shilling, at a rate of 1 shilling to 24 lira. Italian Somaliland was returned to Italy in 1949 as a UN Trusteeship and soon switched to the Italian Somaliland somalo, which was at par with the shilling. British Somaliland gained independence in 1960, and joined what had been Italian Somaliland to create Somalia. In that year, Somalia began using the <b>Somali</b> <b>shilling</b> (replacing the Somali somalo) at par with the East African shilling.|$|E
