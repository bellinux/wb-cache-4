25|$|Headquarters for Amoco Corporation were in Chicago, {{because that}} city {{is close to}} Whiting, Indiana. Whiting was home of Amoco’s largest oil {{refinery}} (and {{one of the largest}} in the world). In operation since 1890, Whiting originally refined <b>sour</b> <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> from the neighbouring state of Ohio. And it was Standard of Indiana's (Amoco's) most important single asset after the US Supreme Court ordered the Standard Oil Trust broken up. In its early years, Amoco was primarily a refiner and a marketer of refined products to expanding Midwestern markets. Whiting provided products that could be marketed from Chicago — a city that was itself a large market for petroleum products.|$|E

50|$|Garyville Refinery {{operations}} {{consist of}} crude distillation, hydrocracking, catalytic cracking, hydrotreating, catalytic reforming, alkylation, sulfur recovery, and coking. The facility primarily processes heavy <b>sour</b> <b>crude</b> <b>oils</b> to produce gasoline, diesel, asphalt, propylene, isobutane, propane, fuel-grade coke, and sulfur. Feedstocks are supplied via pipeline, truck, barge, rail, and ocean tanker.|$|R
5000|$|US {{refineries}} import {{large quantities}} of <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> from Canada, Mexico, Columbia and Venezuela, and they began in the 1990s to build coker and sulfur capacity enhancements to accommodate the growth of these medium and heavy <b>sour</b> <b>crude</b> <b>oils</b> while meeting environment requirements and consumer demand for transportation fuels. [...] "While US refineries have made significant investments in complex refining hardware, which supports processing heavier, <b>sourer</b> <b>crude</b> into gasoline and distillates, similar investment outside the US has been pursued less aggressively.

50|$|The {{price of}} Tapis in Singapore is often {{considerably}} {{higher than the}} price of benchmark <b>crude</b> <b>oils</b> such as Brent or WTI (those commonly referenced in market commentaries). This is because its greater aromaticity (i.e. higher ° API) allows for greater production of higher-value products, such as petrol, than from Brent or WTI. Its high price is also due to {{the purity of the}} blend. Because it contains less sulfur it requires less refinery processing than <b>sourer</b> <b>crude</b> <b>oils</b> such as Brent Oil and WTI. Malaysia is the only country which has significant amounts of oil produced as Tapis, from fields located in the South China Sea.|$|R
50|$|The {{price of}} oil, or the oil price, {{generally}} {{refers to the}} spot price of a barrel of benchmark crude oil—a reference price for buyers and sellers of <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> such as West Texas Intermediate (WTI), Brent ICE, Dubai Crude, OPEC Reference Basket, Tapis Crude, Bonny Light, Urals oil, Isthmus and Western Canadian Select (WCS). There is a differential {{in the price of}} a barrel of oil based on its grade—determined by factors such as its specific gravity or API and its sulphur content—and its location—for example, its proximity to tidewater and/or refineries. Heavier, <b>sour</b> <b>crude</b> <b>oils</b> lacking in tidewater access—such as Western Canadian Select— are less expensive than lighter, sweeter oil—such as WTI.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Sour</b> <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> is {{crude oil}} {{containing}} a high {{amount of the}} impurity sulfur. It is common to find crude oil containing some impurities. When the total sulfur level in the oil is more than 0.5% the oil is called [...] "sour".|$|E
50|$|Dubai Crude is {{a medium}} <b>sour</b> <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> {{extracted}} from Dubai.

50|$|The Paulsboro Refinery is a 950 acre {{facility}} abutting Paulsboro {{in adjacent}} Gibbstown (Greenwich Township) and processes medium-to-heavy <b>sour</b> <b>crude</b> <b>oils</b> to produce unbranded gasoline, heating oil, and jet fuel. It {{is one of}} only two facilities on the East Coast able to process petroleum coke. It became a Special Purpose Subzone 142A of Foreign Trade Zone (FTZ) No. 142 in 1995. In 1998, Valero Energy Corporation purchased the facility from Mobil and in 2010 sold it to PBF with backing from Blackstone Group and First Reserve Corporation. Construction of a new tanker berth was completed in 2010 by Weeks Marine.|$|R
25|$|Because of the {{difficulty}} of moving crude bitumen through pipelines, non-upgraded bitumen is usually diluted with natural-gas condensate in a form called dilbit or with synthetic <b>crude</b> <b>oil,</b> called synbit. However, to meet international competition, much non-upgraded bitumen is now sold as a blend of multiple grades of bitumen, conventional <b>crude</b> <b>oil,</b> synthetic <b>crude</b> <b>oil,</b> and condensate in a standardized benchmark product such as Western Canadian Select. This <b>sour,</b> heavy <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> blend is designed to have uniform refining characteristics to compete with internationally marketed heavy oils such as Mexican Mayan or Arabian Dubai Crude.|$|R
5000|$|Another reason {{given by}} current PDVSA {{management}} {{is that with}} rising <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> prices, {{it has been found}} that mixing or diluting Orinoco bitumen (extra-heavy oil) with a lighter <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> can make this blend more profitable as a <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> on the world market than by selling it as Orimulsion. An example of this is the popular Merey blend (Orinoco bitumen and Mesa <b>crude</b> <b>oil).</b> ConocoPhillips along with PDVSA operate the Merey Sweeny [...] (bpd) delayed coker, vacuum tower and related facilities at ConocoPhillips' refinery in Sweeny, Texas, U.S.A. for processing and upgrading heavy <b>sour</b> Merey <b>crude</b> <b>oil.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The {{majority}} of the sulfur in crude oil occurs bonded to carbon atoms, {{with a small amount}} occurring as elemental sulfur in solution and as hydrogen sulfide gas. Sour oil can be toxic and corrosive, especially when the oil contains higher levels of hydrogen sulfide, which is a breathing hazard.

40|$|Low molecular-weight {{organic sulfur}} {{compounds}} (H 2 S, RSH, COS, CS 2) contained in gasoline are major environmental pollutants. The demand for {{energy in the}} world is increasing, and therefore the production volumes and processing of <b>sour,</b> mercaptan-containing <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> are growing in all countries of the world. Because environmental regulation, new processes for hydrocarbon feedstock treatment are more expanding. Demercaptanization is an appropriate process for sweetening of gasoline. Where, mercaptanic components of gasoline are converted to alkyl disulfides. Simulators are useful tools to manage sweetening operation and to improve the profitability of the process. Based on chemical kinetic and equilibrium data and according to pilot plant data, modeling of the reactors and process simulation were done using HYSYS environment. HYSYS unit operation extensibility has been used to link Fortran codes for the extractor and regenerator to the HYSYS environment. The effect of different parameters on the process performance has been studied and the process was optimized based on the simulation results...|$|R

5000|$|In 1885, {{he founded}} the Empire Oil Company and began {{perfecting}} a method for removing sulfur from <b>sour</b> <b>crude</b> <b>oil.</b> The presence of sulfur in oil causes it to smell noxious and release excessive soot as it burns, making the oil virtually useless for many purposes. John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil company owned fields of oil that contained sulfur. The oil would become far more valuable if the sulfur were removed, so Standard Oil purchased Frasch's company and employed him as the first head of its research department. Frasch perfected his method for removing sulfur from oil, resulting in a financial windfall for Standard Oil.: ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, oil {{companies}} in northern Alberta began building sour gas wells on land they owned near Trickle Creek. Ludwig {{believed he had}} linked the flared hydrogen sulfide sour gas and leaks from the wells with stillbirths, deformations, and miscarriages that began {{to occur in the}} community at the time, and began to protest sour gas development near his community. He appealed to both levels (eg.) of government to regulate sour gas extraction near the community, but the government did not respond. Ludwig then produced a video titled [...] "Home Sour Home" [...] in order to gain broader attention. In an effort to gain the attention of the government he appeared at the government offices of Grande Prairie and poured <b>sour</b> <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> on the lobby carpet.

50|$|As Squire's wealth grew, {{and he made}} {{business}} connections {{through his}} Standard Oil work, he began to develop {{a wide range of}} other business interests. Chemical engineer Herman Frasch was hard at work on a process to remove sulfur from <b>sour</b> <b>crude</b> <b>oil.</b> Solar Refining Co. was founded to utilize the process Frasch developed, which led to Squire's directorship with Solar. Frasch become Standard Oil's first director of research and development in 1888. Frasch next began work on a process to cheaply manufacture soda ash. The petroleum industry consumed large amounts of soda ash, which was used to decalcify drilling fluids. In 1892, Frasch established the Frasch Process Soda Company, with Squire as vice president. Salt was a major component of soda ash production, and in 1882 and 1883 Frash had secured patents on new methods to crystallize and grain salt from a brine solution. Frasch, Frank Rockefeller, and Squire formed the United Salt Company in 1892 as well, but a bad fire in 1894 and financial losses led to the sale of the firm to the National Salt Company in 1899. He became a director of National Salt in 1900.|$|E
40|$|The {{upheaval}} in global <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> {{markets and the}} boom in shale oil production in North America brought scrutiny on the US export ban for <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> from 1975. The ban was eventually lifted in early 2016. This paper examines the shifts of global trade flows and strategic refinery investments in a spatial, game-theoretic partial equilibrium model. We consider detailed oil supply chain infrastructure with multiple <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> types, distinct oil products, as well as specific refinery configurations and modes of transport. Prices, quantities produced and consumed, as well as infrastructure and refining capacity investments are endogenous to the model. We compare two scenarios: an insulated US <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> market, and a counter-factual with lifted export restrictions. We find a significant expansion of US sweet crude exports with the lift of the export ban. In the US refinery sector, more (imported) heavy <b>sour</b> <b>crude</b> is transformed. Countries importing US sweet crude gain from higher product output, while avoiding costly refinery investments. Producers of heavy <b>sour</b> <b>crude</b> (e. g. the Middle East) are incentivised to climb up the value chain to defend their market share and maintain their dominant position...|$|R
5000|$|Barauni Refinery was {{initially}} designed to process low sulphur <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> (sweet <b>crude)</b> of Assam.

With various revamps and expansion projects at Barauni Refinery, capability for processing high-sulphur crude has been added — high-sulphur <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> (<b>sour</b> <b>crude)</b> is cheaper than low-sulphur crudes — thereby increasing not only the capacity but also the profitability of the refinery.|$|R
40|$|Pitting {{corrosion}} {{is one of}} {{the main}} threats in the pressure vessels integrity and also causes the failure of buried pipelines steels that transport <b>sour</b> gas, <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> or condensate hydrocarbon, for this reason, a reliability assessment of pressurized vessels and buried pipelines based on probabilistic mathematical modelling to estimate the remaining life-time due to pitting corrosion damage is extensively employed. Herein, a methodology for probabilistic mathematical modelling of the pits initiation process and its depth growth process is developed; both uncertain processes are well represented by stochastic models. In this methodology two stochastic models are applied; Poisson process is used to model pit initiation and Gamma process to model the pit depth-growth. Such methods are validated using data produced by computer modeling procedures. On the other hand, in the oil industry it is common not to inspect the entire vessels surface; instead of this only a small part of the surface is under inspection. According to this, the use of Block Maxima (BM) and Peak-Over-Threshold (POT) models “EXTREME VALUE STATISTICS ” to characterize the probability distribution of maximum pit depths is also approached...|$|R
