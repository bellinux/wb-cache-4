40|$|AbstractResearch and {{development}} of renewable energy is one solution to energy crisis and its related environmental problem. Among all kinds of renewable energy, geothermal energy has good development feasibility due to its low investment and operation costs, independence to weather and climate change, and stable power generation. In China, high-temperature geothermal resource is rare; however, low-medium temperature geothermal resource is widely distributed. Therefore, small and medium sized geothermal power system based on low-medium temperature organic Rankine cycle(ORC) {{is a good choice}} for geothermal exploitation. Expander is the key device in such system. Single <b>screw</b> <b>expander</b> has proper size and good output performance. Therefore, in order to test the application of single <b>screw</b> <b>expander</b> in geothermal exploitation, compressed air was used as working fluid to conduct experimental study at different temperature. The results show that at the same rotational speed, the single <b>screw</b> <b>expander</b> at a higher air temperature has a bigger output power, a smaller gas consumption rate, a bigger expansion ratio, a bigger temperature drop, a higher thermal efficiency, and a smaller irreversible loss. Moreover, if a lubricant circle is added in the experimental system, the single <b>screw</b> <b>expander</b> with lubricant at a lower air temperature will have the same performance as the expander without lubricant at a higher air temperature. Therefore, the performance of single <b>screw</b> <b>expander</b> can be improved by adding a lubricant circle and raising compressed air temperature...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} {{characteristics of a}} small-size <b>screw</b> <b>expander</b> for the energy conversion of hot spring water are described in this report. Recently, the <b>screw</b> <b>expander</b> has been recognized as an effective machine for low temperature energy conversion, i. e. hot spring water. Usually in the low temperature energy conversion cycle, organic working mediums such as NH 3 or fron are used. With the organic working mediums, the performance tests of <b>screw</b> <b>expander</b> under the same conditions of a practical conversion cycle are very difficult. On the other hand, usually small-size screw expanders may be produced by adapting the massproduced screw compressors. We therefore made compression tests with air using small-size screw expanders. For a small-size <b>screw</b> <b>expander,</b> the compression tests with air are rather easy than the expansion tests with air or organic working mediums. If {{the performance of the}} expansion with organic working mediums could be estimated by the compression tests with air, it might be an effective technique for the design of the low temperature energy conversion cycle using the small-size <b>screw</b> <b>expander.</b> In this paper, we report the experimental results of the compression tests with air, of the expansion tests with air or R II, and comprise the results. The principal specifications of the two testing screw expanders are the built-in volume ratios are 2. 0 and 2. 4, and the exit displacement, 0. 816 m 3 / 1000 rev., which is the same for both expanders...|$|E
40|$|Small scale Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) {{systems have}} a big {{potential}} for waste heat recovery in the market. Due to the smaller volume flows inside these systems, non-conventional expansion technologies such as screw expanders become more interesting. Recent economic studies have shown {{the important role of}} screw machines in such cycles. However, {{in order to get a}} better understanding of the expansion behaviour in an ORC, appropriate simulation models of screw expanders are necessary. The flow inside an oil-injected twin <b>screw</b> <b>expander</b> is modeled in detail with 3 D CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) calculations. These simulations are challenging because of the deforming domain and the narrow gaps between the screws or between a screw and the casing. The deforming mesh motion is handled by an in-house code which generates a block-structured grid with the help of the solutions of the Laplace problem. The oil-phase was modeled with an Eulerian multiphase model and the working fluid is treated compressible. The performance of the <b>screw</b> <b>expander</b> is strongly affected by the oil-injection which provides lubrication and a better sealing of the gaps. Therefore, the different types of leakages inside the <b>screw</b> <b>expander</b> are studied and monitored.

40|$|International audienceThe continual {{increases}} in global energy demand and {{greenhouse gas emissions}} call {{for more and more}} utilisation of sustainable energy sources, such as solar energy, biomass energy, and waste heat. Solar thermal energy, the heat of biomass combustion and waste heat may be used to drive a combined heat and power (CHP) system. In recent years, several micro-CHP systems with organic Rankine cycle (ORC) suitable for domestic applications (1 - 10 kW) driven by solar thermal, biomass-fired boilers and waste heat resources have been investigated. These ORC-based micro-CHP systems have lower operation pressures and temperatures compared to conventional steam-Rankine cycle CHP systems and hence safer for household applications. However, the lack of commercially available expanders applicable to ORC-based micro-CHP systems has hindered the development of these novel CHP systems. This paper summarizes the findings of the market research for the expanders and discusses the selection and choices of the expanders for ORC-based micro-CHP systems.

40|$|The present paper {{focuses on}} the {{thermodynamic}} modeling of screw expanders in a trilateral flash cycle. In this process a liquid is pumped from low to high pressure and then heated up close to saturation point. Instead of a vaporous working fluid as usual, a hot liquid is filled in the working chamber of the <b>screw</b> <b>expander.</b> During the filling process {{the pressure of the}} liquid drops below the saturation pressure while the temperature remains almost constant due to a fast process. Hence the liquid is in a metastable state. The liquid aspires a stable state and therefore is vaporized during the filling and expansion process due to its increasing chamber volume. Thus a two-phase mixture, vapor and liquid, exists in the working chamber. The simulation presented includes the calculation of fluid states within each chamber to be in thermodynamic equilibrium, which assumes that a sufficient heat transfer exists between the phases to reach a stable state within a time step. Thermodynamic simulations are carried out using water as the working fluid for an exemplary <b>screw</b> <b>expander</b> geometry.

40|$|A {{study has}} been carried out on the {{feasibility}} of using <b>screw</b> <b>expanders,</b> as an alternative to turbines, in three types of binary systems, suitable for recovering power from liquid dominated brines. The maximum power that one machine can generate is of the order of 1 - 3 MW per unit, {{depending on the type of}} system, and the brine and cooling conditions. They are shown to be roughly as efficient as turbines, when expanding dry vapour, and they can be coupled directly to a generator, without an intermediate gearbox. They have similar characteristics as two-phase expanders, when their efficiencies are not much reduced. This latter feature enables improvements to be made in the conversion of heat to power, of the order of 30 % over conventional ORC systems, from brines in the 100 o – 140 oC temperature range. The costs of these machines are very competitive and it is shown that in a cycle designed for power recovery from brines in the 170 o- 210 oC range, the cost per unit output of the first expander stage may be less than 50 % of that of a radial inflow turbine-generator set. 2...|$|R

The application in vehicles {{for the purpose of}} heat recovery, which is characterized by the small machine dimensions due to relatively low system mass flows, is a still unexplored area for the screw-type machine. The <b>screw</b> <b>expander</b> is to be used in an organic Rankine cycle (ORC). Compared to other expander designs in general screw expanders are characterized by high efficiency together with relatively low geometrical dimensions. Within the presented investigation mainly the performance characteristic of a <b>screw</b> <b>expander,</b> geometrically designed for a particular operating point, is determined {{as a function of the}} system parameters – inlet pressure and temperature – as well as the rotational speed of the expander. Here, based on an iterative coupling of thermodynamic and thermal simulations the influence of the thermal deformation on the machine performance in particular is analyzed. The results of the thermodynamic simulation, mainly based on so-called chamber models, represent the thermodynamic and fluid dynamic performance of the screw machine by means of mass and energy conservation. The information obtained in this way about the temperature distributions and the heat fluxes provides a basis for the subsequent thermal simulation using a finite element method (FEM) calculation.

40|$|Screw {{expanders}} offer a {{high potential}} for energy conversion {{in the lower}} and medium power range, for instance as expansion engines in closed loop power cycles. A common field of application is waste heat recovery where a certain heat flow is available to evaporate a working fluid in an organic Rankine cycle (ORC). In order to reach maximum cycle efficiency, the expander has to be designed {{with regards to the}} specific case of application. Design parameters, such as rotor geometry, size and inner volume ratio, have to be chosen in accordance to system parameters, for instance pressure levels and mass flow. Given that the available heat flow for the application is restricted, it is necessary to variably determine inlet and outlet pressure as well as the expansion mass flow in order to maximize the power output of the case specifically designed <b>screw</b> <b>expander.</b> The paper contains results of an exemplary design and dimensioning process of a <b>screw</b> <b>expander</b> for an organic Rankine cycle for exhaust heat recovery of internal combustion engines. Both geometric parameters and system parameters are varied in a wide range to maximize the overall power output. It is shown that especially for small scale applications a combination of an uncommonly large inner volume ratio with high inlet pressures can be advantageous despite the fact that only relatively small isentropic expander efficiency is reached. Further proceeding includes consideration of several part load Rankine cycle operation points where a method of averaging the final expander size is presented. During the dimensioning process chamber model simulation is used to predict the operation behavior of the <b>screw</b> <b>expander</b> where the chamber model of the machine is scaled under consideration of geometrical similarity (except of gap heights) during the simulation process at constant circumferential speed. Thus, it is assured that the actual expander mass flow matches the calculated ORC mass flow.

The CSP condition needs more time to finish the release process. The decrease of air temperature in the CSP condition is smaller than it in the VSP one.

The recovery of the energy from the low pressure saturated steam can save tremendous power consumption for those industries. Although the Rankin cycle with a steam turbine can be used to generate the power from the low pressure saturated steam, the isotropic efficiency of the steam turbine is low, the reliability is questionable due to the two phase expansion, and the size is typically large due to the low pressure.

The proposed solutions will have an installed capacity of 2. 65 [MW] to a cost of 5 601 [SEK/kW]. The electric energy production will be 15. 7 [GWh/year]. An investment is recommended to a future electric energy price around 400 [SEK/MWh]. Before an investment it is recommended to investigate how to optimize the regulation of the new system with absorptions heat pumps and turbines...|$|R

40|$|New and old data on <b>screw</b> <b>expanders</b> {{operating}} with 2 -phase mixtures in the admission {{line has been}} combined to enable the first public correlation of adiabatic expansion efficiency {{as a function of}} entry vapour fraction. Although not yet perfected, these findings have enabled an entirely new approach to the design and optimisation of Organic Rankine Cycles, ORCs. By allowing a continuous variation of vapour fraction at expander entry optima for thermal efficiency, second law efficiency and cost efficiency can be found. Consequently one can also find maxima for power output in the same dimension. This research describes a means of adapting cycle characteristics to various heat sources by varying expander inlet conditions from pure liquid expansion, through mixed fluid and saturated gas expansion, to superheated gas. Thermodynamic analysis and comparison of the above optimisations were a challenge. As most terms of merit for power cycles have been developed for high temperature applications they are often simplified by assuming infinite heat sinks. In many cases they also require specific assumptions on e. g. pinch temperatures, saturation conditions, critical temperatures etc, making accurate systematic comparison between cycles difficult. As low temperature power cycles are more sensitive to the ‘finiteness’ of source and sink than those {{operating with}} high temperatures, a substantial need arises for an investigation on which term of merit to use. Along with an investigation on terms of merit, the definition of high level reversible reference also needed revision. Second law efficiency, in the form of exergy efficiency, turned out to be impractical and of little use. A numerical approach, based on a combination of first and second law, was developed. A theory and method for the above is described. Eventually low temperature power cycle test data was compiled systematically. Despite differences in fluid, cycle, temperature levels and power levels the data correlated well enough to allow for a generalised, rough correlation on which thermal efficiency to expect as a function of utilization of source and sink availability. The correlation on thermal efficiency was used to create a graphical method to pre-estimate key economic factors for low temperature site potential in a very simple manner. A major consequence from the findings of this thesis is the reduced dependency on unique choices of process fluid to match heat source characteristics. This development significantly simplifies industrial standardisation, and thereby potentially improves cost efficiency of commercial ORC power generators...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{due to the}} {{increasing}} concern over energy shortage and global warming, the interest in low grade heat recovery from industrial processes has grown dramatically (IEA, 2010). Several studies have underlined the potential of small-capacity ORC power plants for waste heat recovery (WHR) applications (Verneau, 1979). For such systems accurate dynamic modeling represents an important tool in particular when control issues are considered (Colonna and van Putten, 2007) (Casella et al., 2013). This paper presents a dynamic model of an ORC system, validated both in steady-state and transient conditions via experimental data from a 10 kWe waste heat recovery ORC system with a <b>screw</b> <b>expander...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} characteristics of an evaporator system with spring steam and a direct-contacttype condenser system for energy conversion of hot springs {{are described in}} this report. The newly devised evaporator system is composed by a spring steam separator, a hot water tank, a heat exchanger remaked of the shell-and-tube V-type, and a lubricant separator tube. The spring steam, which is separated from spring hot water by the spring steam separator, is blown up {{in the form of}} bubbles in the hot water through the bubble-making plate placed under the Uvtype tubes. These steam bubbles enhance turbulent flows around the If-type tubes, incresing the heat transfer rate. Therefore, the pump of hot water could be omitted in the present system. The working medium heated in the U'-type tubes is first led into the lubricant separator, where it is separated from the lubricant, and then goes into the flusher. In the flusher, the necessary amount of working medium for electric power generation is evaporated, and its gas is fed into the <b>screw</b> <b>expander.</b> The rest liquid of the working medium is returned to the Ll-type tubes by the pump and is reheated with the hot water. The lubricant separated by the lubricant separator, and then moves to the <b>screw</b> <b>expander</b> because of its own high pressure, therefore the pump of the lubricant could be omitted in this system. In the present test, evaporator system is composed of bare copper tubes (25. 44 > x 2 t x effective length 60 m) and the overall heat transfer coefficients with the from R 11 are about 1. 0 kW/m 2 K. Secondly, the newly devised condenser system is similary built by modifying the usual mass-produced shelland- tube U-type heat exchanger. The working medium liquid filling the tube chamber is chilled by the cooling water which flows in the tubes. The working medium gas from the <b>screw</b> <b>expander</b> is blown up into the working medium liquid through the perforated metal plate with (408 x 4 Φ bubble holes) which is placed under the working medium liquid. The blown working medium gas bubbles are condensed efficiently through the direct-contact heat exchange. From the experiments of the new condenser system with R 11, we obtained the value of 2. 5 kW/m 2 K for the overall heat transfer coefficients of this condensor system with bare copper tubes (25. 4 Φ x 2 t x effective length 85 m) ...|$|E
40|$|In this study, a {{small scale}} hybrid solar heating, {{chilling}} and power generation system, including parabolic trough solar collector with cavity receiver, a helical <b>screw</b> <b>expander</b> and silica gel-water adsorption chiller, etc., was proposed and extensively investigated. The system has the merits of effecting the power generation cycle at lower temperature level with solar energy more efficiently and can provide both thermal energy and power for remote off-grid regions. A case study was carried out to evaluate an annual energy and exergy efficiency of the system under the climate of northwestern region of China. It is found that both the main energy and exergy loss {{take place at the}} parabolic trough collector, amount to 36. 2 % and 70. 4 %, respectively. Also found is that the studied system can have a higher solar energy conversion efficiency than the conventional solar thermal power generation system alone. The energy efficiency can be increased to 58. 0 % from 10. 2 %, and the exergy efficiency can be increased to 15. 2 % from 12. 5 %. Moreover, the economical analysis in terms of cost and payback period (PP) has been carried out. The study reveals that the proposed system the PP of the proposed system is about 18 years under present energy price conditions. The sensitivity analysis shows that if the interest rate decreases to 3 % or energy price increase by 50 %, PP will be less than 10 years.

The sensible heat recovered from a common bus engine (typically 8000 cc) feeds the energy recovery system that can generate sufficient extra power to sustain the air-conditioning system {{and part of the}} auxiliaries. The concept is suitable for all kind of thermally propelled vehicles, but the application considered here is specific for an urban bus. The ORC cycle performance is calculated by a Process Simulator (CAMEL Pro) and the results are discussed. A preliminary design of the considered expanders is proposed using ad-hoc made models implemented in MATLAB; the technical constraints inherent to each machine are listed in order to perform the optimal choice of the expander based on efficiency, reliability and power density.
