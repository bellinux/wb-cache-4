Two-thirds of a sample of 1,200 Rwandan genocide widows tested positive for HIV, and the infection rates in rural areas more than doubled after the genocide.

500|$|No one professes to {{have seen}} Home carried from window to window. Home told the three men who were present {{that he was going}} to be wafted, and he thus set up a state of very nervous expectation... Both Lord Crawford and Lord Adare <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> warned. Then Lord Crawford says that he saw the shadow on the wall of Home {{entering}} the room horizontally; and as the moon, by whose light he professes {{to have seen}} the shadow, was at the most only three days old, his testimony is absolutely worthless. Lord Adare claims only that he saw Home, in the dark, [...] "standing upright outside our window." [...] In the dark—it was an almost moonless December night—one could not, as a matter of fact, say very positively whether Home was outside or inside; but, in any case, he acknowledges that there was a nineteen-inch window-sill outside the window, and Home could stand on that.|$|E

The Federal Court challenge was due to commence early in 2013 before Justice Tony North, who handled the Tampa affair. According to a June 2012 report in The Age, some indigenous owners would [...] "testify they were never consulted, while others [...] <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not properly consulted and never consented to the nomination". The court did not begin hearing the case until 2 June 2014, for what {{was expected to be}} a five-week trial. However, on 18 June, the Northern Land Council withdrew the nomination of Muckaty as part of a legal settlement between the parties. The Australian government indicated there would be a three-month period during which the Northern Land Council and traditional owners could determine whether they wished to nominate an alternative site for the dump elsewhere on Muckaty Station.|$|E

500|$|The Paris {{delegation}}, led by Bertrand Delanoë, {{argued that}} Tony Blair and the London delegation {{had broken the}} IOC rules. On 11 July 2005, Delanoë stated: [...] "They have not respected the rules established by the International Olympic Committee. I do not <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> flirting with the yellow line, I say that they crossed the yellow line". A controversial move by the London bid team was its initiative to offer incentive packages for participating athletes, which included free flights, food, vouchers for long-distance calling and other financial accommodations. Immediately after announcing the initiative, London withdrew it, most likely {{as a result of}} Jacques Rogge raising concerns over its potential to start a [...] "bidding war". Paris also claimed that the lobbying by Tony Blair was illegal, an accusation that was strongly denied by Downing Street. It was not until 4 August 2005 that Jacques Rogge suppressed any further controversies by saying in a statement: [...] "I made it very clear that, in my opinion, the competition was fair. It was conducted according to the rules that we have set out". Delanoë's comments were criticised by Parisian political leaders; Claude Goasguen, president of the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) party of the Council of Paris, stated: [...] "One cannot make such type of accusations without delivering any proof".|$|E

The Midrash read the word , cheresh ("secretly"), as , chares, [...] "earthenware", to teach that the two spies took with them earthenware pots and cried, [...] "Here are pots!

While Shi'a Muslim areas were mostly peaceful, Ayatollah Sayed Mohammed Baqir al-Hakim, who returned to Iraq after decades in exile shortly after the occupation began, said: [...] "We are {{not afraid of the}} British or American troops.

The Neronic persecution was instituted in 64 AD and lasted {{until his death}} in June 68 AD, which is three and a half years, or 42 months. Nero was even called the beast. Apollonius of Tyana specifically states that Nero was called a beast: [...] "In my travels, which have been wider than ever man yet accomplished, I have seen man, many wild beasts of Arabia and India; but this beast, that is commonly called a Tyrant, I know not how many heads it has, nor if it be crooked of claw, and armed with horrible fangs. ...

2500|$|A Midrash {{explained}} the mirrors {{of the women}} who [...] "performed tasks" [...] ( [...] , ha-tzovot) at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting in [...] The Midrash told that when the Israelites were suffering hard labor in Egypt, Pharaoh decreed that they should not sleep at home or have sexual relations with their wives. Rabbi Shimon ben Halafta told that the Israelite women would go down to draw water from the river, whereupon God caused them to draw up small fish in their pitchers. The Israelite women would sell some of the fish, cook some of them, buy wine with the proceeds, and go out to the work fields to feed their husbands. After they had eaten, the Israelite women took their mirrors and looked into them together with their husbands. The wives would <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> better looking than the husbands. The husbands would <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> better looking. And in this way, they aroused their sexual desire and became fruitful and multiplied, as [...] reports, [...] "And the children of Israel were fruitful and swarmed and multiplied and became exceedingly mighty." [...] It was through the use of these mirrors that the Israelites were able to continue to have children even under the demands of harsh labor. When God told Moses to make the Tabernacle, all of the men came to contribute. Some brought silver, some brought gold or brass, onyx, and other gems to be set. They readily brought everything. The women brought the mirrors and presented them to Moses. When Moses saw the mirrors, he was furious with the women, saying that whoever brought the mirrors should be punished, asking what possible use they could have in the Tabernacle. God told Moses not to look down on them, for it was those mirrors that raised up all of the hosts of children born in Egypt. God thus directed Moses to take them and make from them the washbasin and its base for the priests.|$|E
