25|$|Danes, Norwegians, and Inuit were {{recruited}} into a sledge patrol {{to search for}} additional Axis weather reporting stations along the coast. Sledge expeditions also rescued Allied airmen making forced landings on the Greenland ice cap. Coast Guard work parties built range lights, <b>shore</b> <b>markers</b> and LORAN radio beacons to aid navigation. Northland landed 41 men with thirty tons of equipment to establish a high-frequency direction finding station on Jan Mayen in November 1942.|$|R
50|$|Designated for walkers and runners, only {{foot traffic}} is allowed on this two mile long trail {{adjacent}} to the eastern lake <b>shore.</b> Distance <b>markers</b> along the route help users log their mileage. Special uses (strollers, children's bicycles with training wheels, tricycles and wheel chair users) are also permitted on this trail which is not plowed in the winter.|$|R
40|$|The {{utilization}} of modest equipment and software revealed bottom contours and water column conditions of a dynamic water body. Classroom discussions of field techniques and equipment capabilities followed by exercises {{with the data}} sets in cause-and-effect analysis all contributed to participatory education {{in the process of}} science. This project is presented as a case study of the value of engaging secondary and collegiate level students in planning, executing and appraising a real world investigation which they can directly relate to. A 1 km wide bay, experiencing marsh inflow, along an 8 km long lake situated 120 km north of Ottawa, Canada, on the glaciated Canadian Precambrian Shield was mapped in midsummer for submerged topography, bottom composition, temperature profile, turbudity, dissolved oxygen and biota distribution. Low level aerial photographs scanned into image processing software are permitting spatial classification of bottom variations in biology and geology. Instrumentation consisted of a portable sport fishing SONAR depth finder, an electronic lead line multiprobe with photocell, thermistor and dissolved oxygen sensors, a selective depth water sampler, portable pH meter, an underwater camera mounted on a home-made platform with a bottom-contact trigger and a disposable underwater camera for shallow survey work. Sampling transects were referenced using a Brunton hand transit triangulating several <b>shore</b> <b>markers...</b>|$|R
50|$|Ophir Creek {{is named}} for the 1853 {{discovery}} of the Comstock Ophir bonanza, a major silver discovery. Ophir was classically a wealthy region described in the Bible, from where King Solomon received tribute of gold, silver, and other precious items. To reduce the silver metal from the ore from the Comstock Ophir mine, the Ophir Mining Company erected the Ophir Mill in 1861 on Washoe Lake's (what was then Washoe Marsh) west <b>shore.</b> A historic <b>marker</b> just north of Ophir Creek on U.S. Route 395 marks its location.|$|R
40|$|The {{shores of}} the northwestern Atlantic have two {{indigenous}} mussel species, the Blue mussel, Mytilus edulis and the Mediterranean mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis. These two species once isolated by the last ice age, are now occurring sympatrically along 1500 miles of the northwestern Atlantic coast. They regularly interbreed and hybridise, producing a patchwork of mixed pure species and hybrid populations, their distribution mainly defined by environmental factors. In hybrid populations on exposed shores in Ireland mussels higher up the shore {{are more likely to}} be M. galloprovincialis. This study set out to test two hypotheses: is this pattern due to preferentially settlement of larvae at a given shore height, or is it due to blanket settlement of larvae followed by preferential secondary settlement or postsettlement selective mortality. The Mel 5 / 16 DNA marker was used to analyse the genetic composition of newlysettled spat onto artificial substrates, which were placed on the mid and low shore areas of two exposed shores in Galway Bay over the period May-October 2002. Samples of adults were collected at the same time, with additional samples collected from a nearby sheltered <b>shore.</b> This DNA <b>marker</b> can differentiate between M. edulis, M,galloprovincialis and hybrids. There was no evidence for preferential settlement by any of the three genotypes on exposed shores. Neither was there evidence of post settlement mortality, as adults from exposed shores were genetically similar to settling spat. Contrary to the results from published studies, there was no significant difference in the genetic structure of adult mussel populations with tidal height. However, in adult exposed shores samples there was a significantly higher frequency of M. galloprovincialis among larger individuals in the population, possibly indicating a selective advantage for the genotype in this environment. Adult mussels from a nearby sheltered site were found to be significantly different to exposed shore adults, due to higher frequencies of M. edulis and hybrid genotypes. There was no difference in the proportions of the three genotypes in small versus large mussels at this site. The difference between adults on exposed and sheltered shores may be due to the competitive advantage of M. galloprovincialis on exposed shore sites, e. g., resistance to wave action and faster growth rates...|$|R
