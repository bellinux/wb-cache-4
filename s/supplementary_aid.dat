There was little glamour to attract worker's to this service, for it was frequently very arduous, carried out under all kinds of conditions, in all weather, and at any time when there was need. In spite of this, {{the response to the}} first call for volunteers was generous. The service {{was organized}} as a Bureau of the Department of Military Relief, and in every Chapter which organized a Motor Corps, a Captain was appointed to command the Corps, with power to appoint Lieutenants and noncommissioned ofiicers. Military discipline and an appropriate measure of military training were strictly enforced. The First Division consisted of the ambulance drivers and truck drivers, who were required to meet the highest standard, and to perform the most exacting and the heaviest service, of the Corps.

40|$|Specimens of {{peritoneal fluid}} or peritoneal {{washings}} {{from a series}} of 106 patients who had had laparotomy or laparoscopy for gynaecological complaints were studied "blind" by conventional cytology and immunocytochemical staining. The antibodies used were Ca 1 or Ca 2, anti-CEA, and HMFG- 2 or E 29. All these are directed against epithelial antigens and are expressed on most malignant epithelial cells and weakly or not at all on mesothelial cells. It was hoped that these reactions would confirm diagnoses made by conventional cytology and possibly show malignant cells which had not already been identified. Of 28 patients with malignant disease (chosen to exclude any with frank ascites), eight gave positive immunochemical reactions, only four having been reported positive from conventional examination. Of 77 patients without malignant disease, HMFG- 2 or E 29 gave positive reactions in seven, Ca 1 or Ca 2 in two, and anti-CEA in two (reactions with plasma cells being disregarded). Some misleading reactions were probably due to endometrial cells.

40|$|Nowadays in eye {{prosthetics}} and eye lenses produc-tion mostly poly methyl metha acrylate (PMMA) is used be-cause {{the material}} excellently fulfills biomedical and aesthetic functions. Peculiarities of PMMA material determines that {{under influence of}} mechanical impact (wind, sand, eye lid movements) and degradation in time, surface properties alter and wetting between <b>supplementary</b> <b>aid</b> and eye lid declines. Reduced biocompatibility follows, discomfort and inflammations in the eye socket region occur. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} research is to decrease/avoid complications by regulating surface charge that would result in wettability alterations, possibly altered to patients gain. It is presumed that applying small enough energy, will influence properties at surface level without changing bulk properties since only the first are responsible for interaction between eye prosthesis or lens and eye socket. For that reason non-ionizing Ultra Violet radiation is used in range 200 - 400 nm. Processed material was examined by means of detecting electron work function, contact angle and absorption spectra to find correlation between surface charge and other surface properties, e. g., wettability. Results demonstrate, that UV radiation influences PMMA surface electrical charge and also wettability in non-linear manner.

The findings of the study supported the literature, which indicates that unlike film,reading materials are not accessible to illiterate adults in rural communities. Two hundred (200) participants were used in the first approach (quantitative), while fifteen (15) illiterate adults were purposively selected from the area to participate in the second approach (qualitative). The research was undertaken within an interpretivist framwork {{in the sense that it}} was a communal process informed by participating illiterate adults, and was sensitive to the role of context (Alvermann, D.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the evaluation of}} the construction market performance in three Baltic States, including Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, based on using structural statistical criteria. The evaluation covers various periods of time, embracing the time before the economic crisis, in 2007, during the economic crisis, in 2009, and after the economic crisis, in 2013. For assessing the efficiency of their construction sectors’ performance, the investigated countries are arranged in the order of preference according to this indicator by using three multiple-criteria decision making methods (MCDM), such as SAW, TOPSIS and COPRAS. These evaluation methods are based on determining the weights of the structural criteria used. For this purpose, three various methods, including the entropy, the method of the criteria impact loss (CILOS) and a new method of determining the objective criteria weights (IDOCRIW) suggested by the authors. The results obtained allowed the researchers to assess the construction market performance in the considered states in various periods of time, to compare them with other countries and to rank them based on this parameter. Therefore, the suggested method of market performance evaluation may be used as an effective <b>supplementary</b> <b>aid</b> for determining the priorities in the future business development, as well as for studying the competitive markets or directing the cash flows of an enterprise to the appropriate areas...|$|E

40|$|After {{several years}} of {{development}} aid being ruled by conditionality, the international trend in discussion revolving around development co-operation and aid efficiency has gradually shifted focus towards the concepts of “ownership” and “partnership”. Through international organizations and official documents, like for instance the OECD-DAC and their Paris Declaration on Aid Efficiency of 2005, these terms have become close to synonymous with aid efficiency {{in a lot of}} donor countries. In this study I have reviewed the international discussion concerning these new terms – how they came about and what they entail for both donors and recipients, and further how the Japanese aid policy relates to them with their own similar terminology of self-help efforts. After defining what characterizes each of the philosophies, I have discussed what policy may work better in certain development environments, and analyzed specialist’s opinions as to what measures Japan can take to better harmonize with the ideas in the international community and raise the effectiveness of aid, as well as what the international community can learn from the extensive Japanese aid experiences. Major findings include the fact that there not necessarily {{is such a thing as}} a superior aid modality. Based on the specific conditions and development environments in a developing country, ideal strategies and modalities may vary greatly according to economic and social situations as well as general development environments. It is therefore of utmost importance to adapt and combine strategies and modalities in order to maximize the efficiency of aid. Japan could thus in certain cases benefit from harmonizing more with the international community by for instance increasing focus on budget support and basket funding or moving away from so-called request based aid. Western donors, on the other hand, could for instance potentially benefit from taking project based aid into more careful consideration as a <b>supplementary</b> <b>aid</b> modality...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{deals with the}} {{influence}} of common affections of the liver and biliary tract upon the level of serum phosphatase activity in the adult. It is an analysis of our observations during the period 1933 to 1939 on those patients with involvement of the liver or biliary tract in whom the diagnosis could be proven by explora-tion or necropsy, or when insusceptible of proof (as in the hepatitides), could be established with reasonable certainty by clinical methods. Some 350 cases satisfied these criteria: 79 adults with proven obstruction of the common bile duct; 75 cases of hepatitis of indeterminate etiology ("catarrhal " jaundice); 39 cases of jaundice following exposure to known hepatotoxic drugs; 15 cases of hemolytic jaundice; 45 patients with proven cirrhosis of the liver, exclusive of biliary cirrhosis; 46 patients with proven neoplastic in-volvement of the liver; 10 patients with proven liver abscess; 10 cases of proven chronic passive congestion of the liver, without significant "car-diac " cirrhosis; and 29 cases of miscellaneous disorders of the liver or biliary tract.

40|$|The study {{analyses}} {{the following}} aspects {{within the framework}} of international cooperation in education development: development trends in the Zambian education and training sector, aid process and coordination in Zambia, and foreign aid responses to Zambia's education development. The cases of British and Swedish aid to education and training are examined more closely for their policy changes and relevancy to Zambia's needs. The study has also sought to determine the position of donors on aspects of aid coordination in Zambia. Because aid operates in overlapping frameworks and responds to many signals. The study has therefore adopted a holistic approach in its analysis of the issues. The following analytic and theoretical frameworks have been used in the study: the systems analysis, the <b>supplementary</b> <b>aid</b> theory, and the exchange and power-dependency theory in interorganisation relationship. The methodology used is qualitative descriptive critical analysis. The findings indicate that the whole realm within which aid relationships are conducted is characterised by a complex mosaic of objectives and interests. British aid to education and training for example has been structured in a way which is intended to make it responsive to a wide-ranging set of objectives in Britain and in the overseas aid constituency. Swedish aid too has a diversified and equally complex aid framework and goals. This is still undergoing changes in approach and method. The findings of this study show that aid responses to education and training in Zambia has been given in the context described above. The aid relationships which has existed between Zambia and donors have accordingly been fairly complex. Consequently, some of the analytic frameworks used in this study have been found inadequate to explain some of the field experiences in Zambia's and donors' aid relationships...|$|E
