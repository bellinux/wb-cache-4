50|$|In 1515, Hachenbach {{passed along}} with the other villages in the Eßweiler Tal (dale) into the lordship of the Waldgraves and Rhinegraves of Grumbach. In 1595, the Eßweiler Tal, and thereby Hachenbach too, then passed to the Duchy of Palatinate-Zweibrücken. Like many other villages in the region, Hachenbach, too, was utterly {{destroyed}} in 1677 in the Franco-Dutch War (1672-1678) by French King Louis XIV’s troops. Even though a 1755 agreement between Palatinate-Zweibrücken and the Rhinegraves of Grumbach resulted in the cession of ﬁve villages by the former back to the latter, Hachenbach remained with Zweibrücken and received a customs station at the bridge across the Glan, for Hachenbach had become a border village. This bridge, ﬁrst built as a stone bridge in 1751/1752, was of special importance to the village. All postal and road trafﬁc between Meisenheim and Zweibrücken went across this bridge {{in the area of the}} so-called Hohe Straße (“High Road”). The bridge had its ﬁrst documentary mention in 1693, when it was newly built, although it was still only a wooden bridge then. The cost of this bridge, which was completed in May 1752 and which was thereby the earliest known crossing of the Glan, was 1,746 Gulden, two thirds of which (1,164 Gulden) was borne by the treasury of the Zweibrücken Oberamt of Lichtenberg, and the other third of which (582 Gulden) was borne by the administration of the Lordship of Kellenbach. In 1784, the bridge was heavily damaged in an ice run on the Glan, and thus Duke Carl II August of Zweibrücken <b>saw</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> in 1789 <b>that</b> a great two-storey-high and 70-foot-long (actually the old German measure called a Schuh, which literally means “shoe”; this was >20 m) wing wall was built onto the bridge on the Hachenbach (right) side, obliged as he felt to shield the bridge against any further such misfortunes. In 1794, the French military broke the arch nearest the Hachenbach side. Until 1825, a wooden emergency bridge was used, until the stone bridge could be set right again. As before, the cost was split at a ratio of 2:1, between the rightful heirs to the lordships on each side of the Glan, but the total this time was only 850 Gulden.|$|R

A broken motor scooter has been put out of sight. There's an empty desk in room 304 at Central high school. And a grief-stricken father and mother must decide what they'll do with a steadily growing college fund. These were the tragic reminders Thursday that Jimmy Dutton was not an ordinary boy. He was a hard-working, dependable youth, and {{he wanted to go to}} college. JIMMY's dreams of college and a new car were crushed Thursday-as broken as were his parents, Mr. and Mrs. J. B. Dutton, the dozens of friends along his paper route and his classmates at Central high school. Fifteen-year-old James William Dutton was buried Thursday afternoon in Memorial cemetery. His parents will take the money collected by friends and use to toward the marker they'll place on their boys grave. Jimmy died Tuesday night when his motor scooter crashed into the side of a taxi-cab at NW 10 and Classen. WEDNESDAY morning, Jimmy's homeroom teacher, Doris Taylor, welcomed her 31 other students for their daily homeroom session in room 304 at Central high school. "I've never seen a more broken group," she said. "They all told me they've never had an experience like this one before. " Within one minute, Jimmy's classmates had collected $ 7 to pay for flowers. Most of the pupils gave their lunch money. Thursday, the group forgot about a Valentine party which was planned, Instead, they made plans to attend in a group their friend's funeral, to be at 2 p. m. Thursday in Guardian funeral home. FOLKS LIVING along Jimmy's paper route in the 2600 block along NW 46, 47, and 49, and along Linn, Detroit and Pate, heard the news early Wednesday, Mothers left their chores to call on others along the route and take up a collection for Jimmy. Children gathered in little knots to talk about the friendly carrier boy. The customers Jimmy served so well collected $ 50 to send his parents along with a note they'll always treasure. It reads. "Each person in Jimmy's route has always deeply appreciated and admired him for all he typified-his friendship, courtesy, dependability and wonderful consideration for us and all our children. His death is a deep personal tragedy to each of us and even more to every child in the neighborhood. We would all be proud to have had him for our son. " It was signed by 76 families. TWELVE-YEAR-OLD Terry Tatum, of 4929 N Pate, idolized Jimmy because "he let me ride his motor scooter "round the block. " Terry helped the older boy throw his papers, and he was sort of learning the job from Jimmy. Jimmy's paper bag and the master carrier jacket he earned at the last recognition dinner held by Oklahoma-Times circulation department in December was hung in his closet. His parents, of 3137 NW 44, think they'll keep Jimmy's jacket, but Dutton said "We'll probably give his bag to R. L. " R. L. Stiles is Jimmy's closet friend. "THEY TRADED scooters when one wasn't working, and they helped each other throw their routes. " Dutton said. The boy had carried the Oklahoman and Times for about 11 / 2 years. He was saving his money for college. Jimmy was born in Wesley hospital, and lived here all his life. He attended Mayfair elementary school and Harding junior highschool. He transferred to Central this year, because he wanted to get into Central's automobile mechanics class. "He liked to fool around with car motors,"his father said. Jimmy, a sophomore at Central, was highly popular with his classmates. He never caused teachers any trouble, and he was described as a better than average student. FRIENDS at Central <b>saw</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> Thursday <b>that</b> the Cardinal yearbook staff will go ahead and publish his picture. Then they'll give a copy of the annual to his parents when it comes out in the spring. Jimmy was a first class Scout and was working toward his Eagle rank. He was a member of troop 66.

His new legislation called for another general sacrifice, coupled with a general offering of libations. It was even more systematic than the first, allowing no exceptions for infants or servants. Logistai (curatores), strategoi, duumviri, and tabularii, who kept the records, <b>saw</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> there were no evasions. Maximinus introduced some innovations to the process, making him the only known persecuting emperor to have done so. This edict now required food sold in the marketplaces to be covered in libation. Maximinus sent sentries to stand guard at bathhouses and city gates {{to ensure that all}} customers sacrificed. He issued copies of the fictitious Acts of Pilate to encourage popular hatred of Christ. Prostitutes confessed, under judicial torture, to having engaged in debaucheries with Christians. Bishops were reassigned to work as stable boys for the Imperial horse guard or keepers of the Imperial camels.|$|E
