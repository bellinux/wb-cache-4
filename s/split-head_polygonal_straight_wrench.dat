40|$|A novel type of {{skeleton}} {{for general}} <b>polygonal</b> figures, the <b>straight</b> skeleton S(G) of a planar straight line graph G, is introduced and discussed. Exact bounds {{on the size}} of S(G) are derived. The straight line structure of S(G) and its lower combinatorial complexity may make S(G) preferable to the widely used Voronoi diagram (or medial axis) of G in several applications. We explain why S(G) has no Voronoi diagram based interpretation and why standard construction techniques fail to work. A simple O(n) space algorithm for constructing S(G) is proposed. The worst-case running time is O(n 3 log n), but the algorithm can be expected to be practically efficient, and it is easy to implement. We also show that the concept of S(G) is flexible enough to allow an individual weighting of the edges and vertices of G, without changes in the maximal size of S(G), or in the method of construction. Apart from offering an alternative to Voronoi-type skeletons, these generalizations of S(G) have ap [...] ...|$|R

Effect of various parameters like Prandtl and Rayleigh numbers has been considered in the study. Columnar-basalts are geological formations observed {{in some of the}} ponded basalt-lava found at many parts of the world. They are prismatic rock joints having <b>polygonal</b> cross-section with <b>straight</b> edges and parallel faces. The typical cross-sectional dimensions vary from few centimeters to meter size and typical height from 30 - 50 meters. Hence the aspect ratio of the columnar-basalt in most cases is greater than 100. The limitations for the evolution of columnar basalts provided in the literature have been discussed. An order of magnitude analysis has been presented for the thickness of the unstable layer at the interface. In this paper, we demonstrate that the double diffusive finger convection system can produce features similar to those observed in columnar basalt and can serve as an alternative, plausible explanation for the evolution of columnar basalt structure. </p...|$|R

No strict correlation exists between the external surface patterns and the anatomy. Two main cell types can be recognized in cross- and longitudinal section, correlated with the straight or undulating outline of the anticlinal walls. No distinction can be made between sections Persicaria, Tovara, Echinocaulon, and Cephalophilon of the genus Persicaria; all share narrow rectangular cells with undulating anticlinal walls. Aconogonon and Bistorta can be delimited by the square to rectangular cells with a narrow dichotomously branching lumen and straight anticlinal walls; both genera are best grouped as a single genus with two sections. A similar arrangement is found occasionally in species of Polygonum s. s., Polygonella, Atraphaxis, Fallopia and Calligonum. Fruit anatomy of Pteropyrum is distinctive. The genus Polygonum s. s. shows a wide range of integrating patterns, ranging from straight to undulating anticlinal walls and cannot be separated from Polygonella. Fagopyrum is aberrant in having a parenchymatic exocarp and a thickened mesocarp; other evidence supports its isolated position. Different fruit anatomical patterns have arisen several times in evolution and have a limited value at tribal level but are useful at generic level. It is suggested that an arrangement with Straight anticlinal walls and a broad lumen, eventually with dendritic branching towards the periphery, is ancestral.

40|$|The Jurassic flora of Sardinia is {{the largest}} Middle Jurassic Flora of Italy. Fossil plants coming from various levels of the Genna Selole Formation and from {{the lower part of}} the Dorgali Formation (Dieni et al., 1983; Costamagna and Barca, 2004; Scanu et al., 2012), and the better-preserved series are located in the Tacchi Area (central-eastern Sardinia). These {{fossiliferous}} levels contain the most abundant Jurassic species of Sardinia (Scanu et al., 2012) and are distributed over a wide area, representing lacustrine-fluvial to coastal transitional environments. The updated list of the Bajocian-Bathonian flora consists of 18 genera belonging to seven divisions. The flora is dominated by well-preserved cycadophytes. Conifers, ginkgophytes and ferns are abundant, while seed ferns and horsetails are rare. The horsetails are represented only by some fragmentary stem impressions with distinct vascular bundles and nodes. The ferns belong to five genera. Some frond fragments with a basal dichotomy belong to the genus Phlebopteris, and particularly to the species P. polypoidioides. The pinnules are narrow and totally or broadly attached to the rachis. Todites cf. williamsonii shows bipinnate frond fragments with grooved midribs. The Cladophlebis sp. fronds are bipinnate with smooth-edged pinnules. In Hausmannia sp. a wedge-shaped structure with marked midribs are present. From the midrib, secondary veins arise and form rectangular or square meshes. Two species of Coniopteris have been identified in the flora: C. simplex shows elongated, narrow pinnules whilst in C. hymenophylloides the pinnules are broad and with a rounded apex. Two different genera of seed ferns have been identified as well, Sagenopteris and perhaps Ptilozamites. Sagenopteris sp. has leaflets with a marked midrib, while Ptilozamites show rhombic to slightly falcate segments inserted laterally to the rachis. In particular, Ptilozamites has thick cuticle with isodiametric cells. Cycadophytes are the most represented plants in the Middle Jurassic of Sardinia and at least seven genera are present. Fragments of Nilssonia have parallel and undivided secondary veins. The leaves are hypostomatic and epidermal cells are sub-rectangular to <b>polygonal</b> with <b>straight</b> anticlinal walls. Another cycads, Pterophyllum cf. thomasi, shows elongated segments with parallel veins and slightly expanded bases. The genus Ptilophyllum is present perhaps with two species and a detailed cuticular analysis, in progress, will confirm the presence of P. pectinoides and of another new species. Taeniopteris sp. shows leaves with a typical taeniopterid venation arising from the thick midrib. Impression fossils with a round-oval shape and a scale-like structure belong to the genus Cycadeospermum. Lastly, Williamsonia hildae includes bennettitalean female fructifications with a gynoecium showing a minutely reticulated surface surrounded by interseminal scales; Weltrichia sp., the male fructification, has cup-like structures with extensive lobes. Czekanowskiales count the only species Czekanowskia cf. furcula whereas conifers are well-represented in the flora with 3 genera: Brachyphyllum (with at least 2 species), Geinitzia sp. and Elatocladus sp. Furthermore, seeds of Carpolithes sp. have also been found. In summing up the flora shows a high biodiversity. Additionally, the Jurassic of Sardinia shows analogies with the other European floras of the same age, particularly with the Yorkshire Middle Jurassic flora wherewith shares 14 genera of plant fossils. ...|$|R

The aim is the identification of morphological and microscopic diagnostic characteristics of the seed epidermis of Plantago ovata, minimal and sufficient to establish {{the authenticity of the}} granular pieces of the plant’s epidermis. Materials and methods. The study of morphological and anatomical characteristics as well as histochemical study were conducted according to the procedures of the State Pharmacopoeia of the Russian Federation XIII edition. Microscope “Micromed- 1 ” and digital camera MD 300 Electronic Eyepiece (Jincheng) were used. Photos were edited in Adobe Photoshop CS 6. Results and discussion. Morphological signs of the epidermis of Plantago ovata seeds include its light yellow or pinkish-yellow color and a presence of a pigmented spot of pink or light brown color on the epidermis of the convex side of the seeds and along the seed. These signs are applicable for diagnosis and are also found in crushed raw materials. Granules are rough lumps, consisting of stuck together epidermis pieces. They are characterized by a yellowish or light brown color and the presence of a pigmented spot. The microscopic diagnostic signs include the structure of the upper and lower epidermis, the presence of cells with mucus and starch grains. The upper epidermis consists of large <b>polygonal</b> cells with <b>straight</b> thin anticlinal walls. The cells are covered with a smooth cuticle and are filled with mucus. The lower epidermis consists of elongated rectangular cells. Cells with mucus swell rapidly in the radial direction. Biometric characteristics of anatomical diagnostic signs were established.

40|$|The Dawn {{spacecraft}} {{arrived at}} Ceres in March 2015. There, the on-board Framing Camera (FC) collects image data with {{a resolution of}} up to 35 m/pixel, which reveal a large variety of impact crater morphologies including polygonal craters. <b>Polygonal</b> craters show <b>straight</b> rim sections aligned to form an angular shape. They are com- monly associated with fractures in the target material, which may be preserved as linear structures on Ceres [3, 4]. On Ceres, we find polygonal craters with a size ranging between 5 km and 280 km in diameter. However, the ma- jority of polygonal craters have diameters ranging between 10 km and 50 km diameter. A preferential hexagonal shape is observed and some polygonal craters exhibit central peaks or relaxed crater floors. On average there are eight to ten polygonal craters per 100, 000 km 2, however the northern latitudes have a slightly higher and the southern latitudes a slightly lower polygonal crater density. This may hint at an older and younger age of the northern (> 60 °N) and southern regions (> 60 °S) compared to the mid latitudes, respectively. Alter- natively, the relaxation of craters may be advanced in the mid latitudes which are generally warmer than the poles and thus support the relaxation of depressions. Also, the southern region harbors relatively large craters which may have altered or destroyed preexisting structures in the crust which are necessary {{for the formation of}} polygonal craters. Most polygonal craters have six or seven straight rim sections; however, there is a tendency for fewer edges with decreasing crater size. Although this observation may be biased due to the map resolution, {{it is also possible that}} the impactor creating a relatively small polygonal crater embeds less energy and thus forms the straight rim sections during the excavation stage. This may result in fewer straight rim sections compared to more energetic impactors which form their polygonal shape during the modification stage. Straight rim sections and edges of polygonal craters often align with linear features associated with Ceres’ tec- tonics. Small and medium-sized polygonal crater rims tend to align with the general direction of linear features, whereas very large polygonal crater edges tend to be intersected by the linear features. This may hint at the differ- ent formation processes of polygonal craters depending on the embedded energy. In contrast, polygonal craters are also present in areas with no obvious tectonic features. These polygonal craters may be produced by subresolution or subsurface fractures.

40|$|The Apse, Construction and Geometry: some Reflections The {{interest}} in apses {{is the result}} of a chain of episodes, not always connected to one another, outlining a framework for fruitful inquiry. It is no coincidence that this need is felt in a land like Sicily, an island at risk of earthquakes where history has been forced to make do with an unstable and age-old status-quo existing between innovation and resilience. Many of the possible lines of reasoning can be found in the following essays, while in this paper I will try using some examples (not just strictly Sicilian) to clarify the meaning and requirements of this field of investigation, in the awareness of all the limits that a short diachronic overview implies. The apses of some Norman cathedrals of western Sicily (Palermo, Monreale, and Cefalù) are marked by a decorative grandeur and a perfection that are unparalleled at least as far as their exteriors are concerned. For the Normans who ordered their construction, it was essential and rewarding to invest in that part of the works that could presumably be accomplished within a few years. This attention to the apses also had a propagandist component. The apses of the cathedrals of Mazara and Catania have resisted for centuries to catastrophes and human mutations becoming models even centuries after their construction. Compared with the weakness of the facade, the solidity of the apse emerges and is visible at a cursory glance. Generally speaking, there were three possible geometrical variants relating to the construction of apses; semicircular, <b>polygonal</b> (semi-octagonal), or <b>straight.</b> These options implied a different solution for the conch. The quarter of a sphere placed over a semicircular apse lent itself to being decorated with a mosaic or fresco. However, if it was made of bare cut stone, it would give rise to a series of complications. The blocks would be placed in horizontal or vertical rows. In some extraordinary examples a fan-shaped arrangement was used, often creating the shape of a seashell (chapel of the Sailors in the Sanctuary of the Annunciation in Trapani, dating to around 1520) or unique lenticular conformations, as in the case of the church of the Carmine in Mazara (1680 s). The polygonal shape generally afforded greater ease when fitting openings on the sides and could be completed with ribbed roofing, which was much more practical, geometrically simpler and statically safer. The straight termination, finally, would require the construction of pendentives or trumpet shaped easements or, as in Sardinia and the eastern part of Spain, with small simple triangular crossings with three ribs (“tercerol”) to reconfigure the geometry of the conch. Clearly, over the course of history apses underwent processes of transformation or radical substitution. The liturgical components and the reasons for these renovations are known, but the phenomenon is not solely attributable to the Counter-Reformation. By contrast, the older apses were also a support on which a new structure or several ones could be built, creating a so-called “telescope” effect, as in the case of Cathedral of Mallorca. In Sicily it is still possible to observe the dissonant and dramatic effects of structures destined to engulf more ancient edifices, but which stop short before the demolition process is completed leaving visible remains of the original apses (mother church of Sciacca and Church of San Domenico in Palermo). Then there is the case of the multiplication of the apse that is usually found in centric plans and in those solutions, almost always of the 18 th century, which exploit facades with a great central convexity...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, careful {{analysis}} of a large quantity of ceramic material found during excavation at Vinca has identified {{a significant number of}} ceramic fragments with clear use-wear traces. Recycled fragments of ceramic vessels are characterized by the presence of damage and deformation caused by abrasive processes i. e. contact of the fragments with hard material. All recorded recycled fragments can generally be divided into two basic groups: fragments representing tools with a working edge, and fragments with traces of abrasion on their outer surface. The largest group comprises fragments whose edges form the working edge of a tool, rounded or flattened through use and so becoming smooth. In contrast to so-called burnishers (the secondarily used, striped handles with traces of the action of water, manifesting in a uniformly rounded break) with ceramic tools only one edge of the fragment is rounded and used; the remaining edge indicates a completely normal break. In addition, most fragments also have abrasions directly beneath the working edge, which indicates holding the tool at a certain angle during use. That damage can occur both on the exterior and interior surfaces. It is striking that in a large group of fragments, the rim is used as a working edge. Tools are mostly fragmented, but it appears that their shape was not modified before use. In that sense, two <b>straight</b> <b>polygonal</b> tools can be distinguished (T. I/ 1 a-b), or tools which are rectangular in shape with rounded corners (T. II 4 a-b), preserved complete. In most cases, these are fragments of bowls, so tools usually have polished or burnished surfaces, but ornamental parts formed by burnished lines or channelling are also noticeable. Fragments of rough fabric were never used as tools, but only those with an admixture of fine sand. Very rarely, actually in two cases, fragments of amphorae were used as tools (T. IV/ 2, 5). Usually the upper parts of vessels were used, although there are several exceptions, where parts of the base and body were used as well (T. IV/ 3). Also, in the damaged area straight depressions can often be noticed, which apparently represent some kind of negative impression of the object on which they were used, or, in rare cases, the whole working surface is step-like. The second group of fragments do not generally differ from the first group as regards their form and the surface treatment. The difference {{can be seen in the}} distribution of damage. To be precise, the zone of intensive abrasion lies on the surface of fragments and is manifested by complete removal of original surface, while across it, marks caused by contact with hard material often result in deep incisions, which can be seen with the naked eye. These marks can be found on the most protruted parts of vessels i. e. on the shoulder, apart from two cases concerning the shoulder, or the thickened rim of an amphora (T. V/ 1, 5). Finally, we should emphasise the fact that not one ceramic tool has been found around an architectural structure. Specimens originate from archaeological layers or contexts which do not represent a specific zone of activity (destruction layers, ditch filling, posthole, levelling layers etc) but in contexts in which waste material was deposited. From that perspective, one example can particularly be distinguished, a tool with a working edge found near the ceramic substructure of a oven. By analysis of the distribution, shape and kind of damage, as well as the position and shape of the working edge, it is possible to reconstruct the direction of movement and position of the tool during use. Scraping tools show marks in the form of dense incisions, visible both macroscopically and microscopically. They can also be characterised by a pronouncedly rounded working edge. Bearing these characteristics in mind, tools from Vinca with rounded working edges can be categorized as tools for scraping away excess clay and for thinning the surface of unfired vessels. They were held at right angles or slanting in relation to the vessel, with the working edge horizontal or also at an angle or lateral to the working edge, so that the vessels walls were thinned by movements in various directions. Ceramic tools were not specialized, and were undoubtedly multi-functional. They could have been used for smoothing and polishing. This is supported by the fact that abrasion traces are parallel or distributed in various directions. A group of tools with a flattened working edge, judging by preserved marks, had a rather different function. There are indications that these were held at right angles to the vessel but that the movement was not lateral. The tool was probably held with the working edge in a vertical position, so that burnished decoration could be carried out by using up/down movements, when it was necessary to make thin burnished lines of uniform thickness and with clearly defined edges. Bearing in mind traces of 'negative' impressions of the item on which the tools were used, the tool could also have been used in a left-right direction, when it was used to execute the burnished zone typical for upper bowls' parts. One of the important characteristics of ceramic tools is the use of the rim of a broken vessel as a working edge. This is a very logical choice. Bowl rims have a naturally rounded and often symmetrical, sharpened shape. Thus, craftsmen got a ready-made thin, relatively sharp tool, so there was no need to modify a fragment or re-shape it for the working edge to obtain the desired shape. Likewise, as mentioned before, the existence of a negative impression on work edges, usually rims, makes it probable that such tools were used to shape and burnish the rims of vessels. It is an interesting fact that most of these tools comprise fragments of bowls, and this is not coincidental. Important role in the appearance and form of traces caused by abrasive processes is played by characteristics of the abrasive, i. e. tool, such as hardness and granulation. All bowls are characterised by their fine fabric and fine-sand admixture, thin walls, burnished or polished surfaces and firing in a reduced atmosphere. These characteristics are very significant regarding the reaction of material to mechanical stress. A reduced atmosphere during firing increases the hardness of ceramics. Ceramics with fine granulation and lower porosity show greater resistance to mechanical stress than ceramics of rougher fabric with larger quantities of a coarse admixture. Burnishing and polishing lead to the compression of particles on surfaces, which creates a hard, compact structure, resistant to abrasion. It was especially convenient to have tools made of materials with identical characteristics as material they were used on. Analysis of ceramic fragments from the early phase of the Late Neolithic settlement at Vinca indicated an exceptional number of recycled vessel fragments, shaped as tools and used in the process of shaping and modifying ceramic surfaces. Since this concerns a new class of archaeological finds, it is necessary to suggest a direction for future research, particularly experimental, which would, together with microscopic identification of use-wear traces, reveal completely the activities in which ceramic tools were used...|$|R
