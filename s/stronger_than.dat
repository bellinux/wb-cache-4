5|$|A {{key element}} in combat since Genealogy of the Holy War is the Weapon Triangle, a system {{governing}} {{the strengths and weaknesses}} certain weapons and types of magic have against each other in a Scissors, Paper, Rock fashion. For weapons, lances are <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> swords, swords are <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> axes, and axes are <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> lances. In magic, fire is <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> wind, wind is <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> thunder, and thunder is <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> fire. For Fates, the Weapon Triangle relationships add other weapons in the following way: swords and tomes are <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> axes and bows, axes and bows were <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> lances and shuriken, lances and shuriken are <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> swords and tomes, and so on. Several games use a Weapon Durability system: after being used a certain number of times, a character's weapon will break. Different entries have various systems related to character weapons: in Genealogy of the Holy War, weapons can be repaired at special shops; in Path of Radiance and future games, weapons can be bought and upgraded, while the durability system is replaced in Fates with a system where more powerful weapons weaken some of a wielder's stats.|$|E
5|$|A {{research}} paper published {{ten years after}} the storm suggested that Gay could have been <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> Typhoon Tip, which attained the lowest barometric pressure ever recorded. While at its peak intensity, Gay registered a rating of 8.0 for nine consecutive hours using the Dvorak technique, indicating sustained wind speeds of at least (315km/h) 195mph. In addition, the cyclone had a significantly colder band of clouds around the eye. Typhoon Angela in 1995 presented similar features and could have been <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> Gay. Neither of the two had direct observations into their eyes, however, making it impossible to confirm such intensity.|$|E
5|$|Battles {{play out}} using a turn-based system where each unit {{on both sides}} is given their chance to move and act. Characters move and attack within the same turn, {{and in a few}} cases units can take two moves in a turn. A key part of combat is the Weapons Triangle, a new {{addition}} which governs the opposing strengths and weaknesses of weapon types based on a rock–paper–scissors system - lances are <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> swords, swords are <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> axes, and axes are <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> lances. A secondary system governs the magic system, where Fire, Lightning, and Wind spells have varying strengths and weaknesses against each other. Each unit has a character class which determines their weapon, skill set, movement and attack range, how much effect they have on other units, which latent skills they possess, and whether they use passive or aggressive skills when in combat. Different weapon types also affect character movement and battle performance: for instance, a powerful sword deals damage while slowing a character's movement.|$|E

5|$|The {{electrons}} of an atom {{are attracted}} to the protons in an atomic nucleus by this electromagnetic force. The protons and neutrons in the nucleus {{are attracted to}} each other by a different force, the nuclear force, which is usually <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> the electromagnetic force repelling the positively charged protons from one another. Under certain circumstances, the repelling electromagnetic force becomes <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> the nuclear force, and nucleons can be ejected from the nucleus, leaving behind a different element: nuclear decay resulting in nuclear transmutation.|$|E

5|$|A {{widely used}} zinc alloy is brass, in which copper is alloyed with {{anywhere}} from 3% to 45% zinc, {{depending upon the}} type of brass. Brass is generally more ductile and <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> copper, and has superior corrosion resistance. These properties make it useful in communication equipment, hardware, musical instruments, and water valves.|$|E
5|$|As players {{walk through}} the level, they are stopped by groups of enemies who must be {{defeated}} before they can continue. The level ends when all the enemies are defeated. Each level contains many identical groups of enemies, making these games notable for their repetition. In beat 'em up games, players often fight a boss—an enemy much <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> the other enemies—at {{the end of each}} level.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} forms of climbing, bouldering {{technique}} is largely centered on proper footwork. Leg muscles are significantly <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> arm muscles; thus, proficient boulderers use their arms primarily to maintain balance and body positioning, relying on their legs to push them up the boulder. Boulderers also keep their arms straight whenever possible, allowing their bones to support their body weight rather than their muscles.|$|E

5|$|Battles {{take place}} on a grid-based battlefield, with {{objectives}} which range from clearing enemy groups to capturing points of importance. Each map has unique terrain to be negotiated in battle ranging from mountains to rivers and flat plains. Viewed from an overhead perspective, there are castles and locations such as shops that the player can visit, the latter of which provides a means for obtaining items. Each chapter has {{a different set of}} victory conditions, which can be related to the number of turns taken or how the enemy force is dealt with. Battles play out using a turn-based system where each unit on both sides is given their chance to move and act. During battle, the combat screen appears, showing the fight from a sidelong perspective. Both sides move at least once, after which the combat screen fades. Battles between individual units are governed by the series' recurring Weapons Triangle, a rock–paper–scissors system where certain weapons have advantages over others — lances are <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> swords, swords are <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> axes, and axes are <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> lances. As they participate in battles, each unit gains experience points (EXP) from their actions: they raise their experience level by one when they have accumulated 100 EXP. EXP can be earned in both normal battles and challenge fights in special arenas. Players can save {{at the end of each}} chapter or outside battle. They also have a single mid-chapter save available. All units are subject to permanent death: If a unit dies in battle, they are removed from the rest of the campaign.|$|E

Will realizes that his passion is teaching, not performing, and {{resolves}} to recommit to the glee club.|$|E
5|$|Christiansen (1998) {{estimated}} that the leg bones of Tyrannosaurus were not significantly <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> those of elephants, which are relatively limited in their top speed and never actually run (there is no airborne phase), and hence proposed that the dinosaur's maximum speed would have been about , {{which is about the}} speed of a human sprinter. But he also noted that such estimates depend on many dubious assumptions.|$|E

During Q3 of 2006, the game sold a total of 343,000 across Japan, mainland Asia and North America.|$|E

The visiting team, under the captaincy of Bob Wyatt, was <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> English teams that had previously toured the Caribbean; despite some shortcomings, Wisden and other critics considered it strong enough for the task in hand.|$|E
5|$|In the Philippines, Elsie worsened the {{situation}} already {{left in the}} wakes of typhoons Angela and Dan. Although it was <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> the previous two, Elsie caused far less damage due to the relatively sparse population {{in the area of}} landfall. During the storm's passage, 47 people were killed and another 363 were injured. Damages throughout the country amounted to $35.4million and roughly 332,000 people were left homeless.|$|E

50|$|Sulfonic acids {{are much}} <b>stronger</b> acids <b>than</b> the {{corresponding}} carboxylic acids. p-Toluenesulfonic acid, with a pKa of −2.8, {{is about a}} million times <b>stronger</b> acid <b>than</b> benzoic acid, with a pKa of 4.2. Similarly, methanesulfonic acid, pKa = −1.9, is also about one million times <b>stronger</b> acid <b>than</b> acetic acid. Because of their polarity, sulfonic acids tend to be crystalline solids. They are also usually colourless and nonoxidizing, which is convenient. Because of their high acidity, sulfonic acids are often soluble in water or exhibit detergent-like properties.|$|R
