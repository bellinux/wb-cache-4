40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the seasonal effect of wet and dry periods on the composition and structure of flooding grassland. Thirty quadrats (0, 5 m× 0, 5 m) were used in each period (wet and dry) to estimate the degree of covering of the species. Phytosociological parameters, diversity and similarity indices were calculated between periods. Forty eight species were collected, 35 genera distributed in 20 families. Cyperaceae (10), Poaceae (six) and Euphorbiaceae (five) were the families with the highest number of species. Therophytes were the most abundant (41, 02 %), followed by hemicryptophytes (23, 08 %). Diversity and richness were higher in wet <b>season</b> (<b>S</b> = 41, H’= 4, 09 e D = 0, 91) than in the dry <b>season</b> (<b>S</b> = 26, H = 3, 29 e D = 0, 85), and the similarity was Ss = 55, 88 %. Some species, like Bacopa myriophylloides Wettst, Cyperus haspan L. ssp. juncoides (Lam.) Kük, Digitaria fuscescens (J. Presl) Henrard and Eleocharis minima Kunth, were humidity indicators, while Euphorbia thymifolia L., Wedelia brachycarpa Baker, Ludwigia octovalvis (Jacq.) P. H.

The binary logistic regression analysis also retained passing variables. The team should attempt fewer passes, but ensure that more of these passes are completed. With away matches, the effect became more pronounced (β = - 0. 042, OR = 0. 959, p = 0. 012). In conclusion, the team should adopt a more direct style of play. They should move the ball into a shooting position with fewer passes and ensure that more shots are on the target...|$|R

The data were recorded in two files; the first file consisted of 103776 records, each record included information about farm and animal identification, lactation number and reproduc¬tive traits like service number, calving interval, number of service per conception and age at first calving. The second fil, included farm and cow identification, lactation number and birth date, calving date and dry off date. Each file was sorted by lactation within cow number within farm number. According to calving date, cows were grouped into two seasons of calving: fall-winter <b>season</b> (<b>S</b> 1) for cows calved from October to March and summer-spring <b>season</b> (<b>S</b> 2) for cows calved from April to September. Milk records were divided into two milk production levels: level one (MU) for cows with milk production s 9500 liter, level two (ML 2) for cows with milk pro¬duction > 9500 liter. The results revealed that: Sevice number and number of service per conception have not affected significantly by lac¬tation no, after first lactation.
