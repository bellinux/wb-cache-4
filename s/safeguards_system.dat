Such <b>safeguard</b> <b>systems</b> should not disrupt the host genome and should have long-term stability. Here, we attempted to develop a tumor-suppressing mammalian artificial chromosome containing a <b>safeguard</b> <b>system</b> that uses the immune rejection system against allogeneic tissue from the host. For proof-of-concept of the <b>safeguard</b> <b>system,</b> B 16 F 10 mouse melanoma cells expressing the introduced H 2 -K(d) major histocompatibility complex (MHC class I) -allogenic haplotype were transplanted into recipient C 57 BL/ 6 J mice expressing MHC H 2 -K(b). Subcutaneous implantation of B 16 F 10 cells into C 57 BL/ 6 J mice resulted in high tumorigenicity. The volume of tumors derived from B 16 F 10 cells expressing allogenic MHC H 2 -K(d) was decreased significantly (P < 0. 01). Suppression of MHC H 2 -K(d) -expressing tumors in C 57 BL/ 6 J mice was enhanced by immunization with MHC H 2 -K(d) -expressing splenocytes (P < 0. 01).

40|$|The {{proliferation}} {{resistance of}} {{a nuclear power plant}} has become an increasingly important issue due to the political climate of nuclear power at the present. Any new power plant that is constructed must be proliferation resistant and meet international standards set by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). In an age with a War on Terrorism and states not declaring their nuclear intentions, nuclear power needs to have proliferation resistance be a primary concern if nuclear power plants are to be built in the future. The PRISM nuclear reactor system has been examined in this work with focus on the movement of nuclear fuel. The PRISM was chosen as the system to develop a proliferation <b>safeguard</b> <b>system</b> because of the literature that has been readily available for it and its potential use in the MIT Sodium Fast Reactor project. The <b>safeguard</b> <b>system</b> is based on the CANDU <b>safeguard</b> <b>system</b> with new components included to address diversion scenarios that were developed as part of this work. This work consists of developing those scenarios and the <b>safeguard</b> <b>system.</b> Also, research into the different components has been done.

50|$|Since its {{founding}} by the United Nations in 1957, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has promoted two, sometimes contradictory, missions: {{on the one}} hand, the Agency seeks to promote and spread internationally the use of civilian nuclear energy; on the other hand, it seeks to prevent, or at least detect, the diversion of civilian nuclear energy to nuclear weapons, nuclear explosive devices or purposes unknown. The IAEA now operates a <b>safeguards</b> <b>system</b> as specified under Article III of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) of 1968, which aims to ensure that civil stocks of uranium, plutonium, as well as facilities and technologies associated with these nuclear materials, are used only for peaceful purposes and do not contribute {{in any way to}} proliferation or nuclear weapons programs. It is often argued that proliferation of nuclear weapons to many other states has been prevented by the extension of assurances and mutual defence treaties to these states by nuclear powers, but other factors, such as national prestige, or specific historical experiences, also play a part in hastening or stopping nuclear proliferation.|$|E
5000|$|EURATOM is {{owner of}} all such materials. Its control {{functions}} {{are linked to}} this ownership. The Treaty provided further {{for the establishment of}} so-called [...] "Common Enterprises", which have certain obligations to the Community but also enjoy certain privileges, among them tax privileges which they could not enjoy under national law. A particular activity of the Community is the exchangeof information, including even secret patents. A legal device for technical cooperation within the Community which I find of special interest is the so-called [...] "Association Contract". The European Nuclear Energy Agency consists of 18 Western European members and 3 associate countries (Canada, Japan, United States). It has played a considerable role in the creation of [...] "joint undertakings". The first was the European Company for the Chemical Processing of Irradiated Fuels (EUROCHEMIC) at Mol, Belgium. EUROCHEMIC is an independent international share-holding company with its own legal personality. It was created by an international convention. Later, other international projects such as the Halden experimental boiling water reactor in Norway, the Dragon reactor project at Winfrith, United Kingdom, the Seibersdorf Food Irradiation Project in Austria, the Nuclear Data Compilation Centre at Saclay, France, and the ENEA Computer Programme Library at Ispra, Italy, were founded. One finds that a new sector of nuclear law has evolved from the range of techniques used in the formation of such joint projects and through the concepts developed in their administration and those relating to the use of information derived from their operation. ENEA has also its own <b>safeguards</b> <b>system</b> and the European Nuclear Energy Tribunal can decide disputes arising out of its application. ENEA has caused its Member States to adopt legislation by which premiums paid on nuclear insurance received a certain preferential tax treatment in order to enable insurance companies to build up reserves faster. This demonstrated how law can contribute to the promotion of nuclear economy.|$|E

40|$|SummaryThe {{discovery}} of induced {{pluripotent stem cells}} (iPSCs) has created promising new avenues for therapies in regenerative medicine. However, the tumorigenic potential of undifferentiated iPSCs is a major safety concern for clinical translation. To address this issue, we demonstrated the efficacy of suicide gene therapy by introducing inducible caspase- 9 (iC 9) into iPSCs. Activation of iC 9 with a specific chemical inducer of dimerization (CID) initiates a caspase cascade that eliminates iPSCs and tumors originated from iPSCs. We introduced this iC 9 /CID <b>safeguard</b> <b>system</b> into a previously reported iPSC-derived, rejuvenated cytotoxic T lymphocyte (rejCTL) therapy model and confirmed that we can generate rejCTLs from iPSCs expressing high levels of iC 9 without disturbing antigen-specific killing activity. iC 9 -expressing rejCTLs exert antitumor effects in vivo. The system efficiently and safely induces apoptosis in these rejCTLs. These results unite to suggest that the iC 9 /CID <b>safeguard</b> <b>system</b> is a promising tool for future iPSC-mediated approaches to clinical therapy...|$|R
