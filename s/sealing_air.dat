40|$|Gas {{turbines}} {{operate with}} medium {{of very high}} temperatures, which requires using advanced materials for vanes and blades and sophisticated methods of their cooling. Other parts of the turbine have {{to be protected from}} contact with hot gases. Discs that hold vanes and blades are especially exposed to this danger. In order to avoid it certain improvements have to be applied: providing <b>sealing</b> <b>air</b> and adjusting geometry of the hub to make the ingress to the cavity (space between discs) more difficult. This thesis concerns CFD investigation of the influence of the amount of <b>sealing</b> <b>air</b> on sealing efficiency and on the flow in the main annulus. The first part concerned literature study. Phenomena of ingress and interaction between main flow and <b>sealing</b> <b>air</b> were described. Different methods of estimating efficiency were shown.

The aim was to investigate how the power and reaction rate depend on the secondary air. The results were also exported to be used as boundary condition {{in the second part of}} the thesis. The last part concerned only the cavity – conditions at the main annulus were taken from the main annulus solution. Pressure in specified locations was measured and used to calculate sealing efficiency. Results were compared with the theoretical equations from the literature study. A structure of the flow inside the cavity was analyzed for several different amounts of the sealing flow. A method of unsteady flow analysis was developed and described.

40|$|Rim {{seals in}} gas {{turbines}} {{are used to}} reduce the potentially damaging ingestion of hot gas into the rotor-stator wheel-space of a turbine stage. <b>Sealing</b> <b>air,</b> bled from the compressor, {{is also used to}} reduce or prevent ingestion, but this can be at the expense of stage efficiency. This paper summarises recent research into the computation of the fluid dynamics and heat transfer of ingestion carried out at the University of Bath. 3 D Unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier- Stokes (URANS) simulations have been carried out, and much more economical simplified steady state computational models have also been tested. The results of the computations are compared with experimental measurements (also made at the University) of pressure, tracer gas concentration based sealing effectiveness, swirl and heat transfer for different generic and also engine- representative rim seals. The computations allow insight into the flow physics of ingestion and factors affecting the most efficient use of <b>sealing</b> <b>air,</b> as well as providing information to support the development of the theoretical models of ingestion that are useful to engine designers.

40|$|Ingestion (or ingress) of hot {{mainstream}} {{gas into}} the wheel-spaces between the rotor and stator discs {{in the high}} pressure stages of gas turbines {{is one of the}} most important internal cooling problems for engine designers. A rim seal at the periphery of the wheel-space and a radial outflow of <b>sealing</b> <b>air</b> are used to reduce or prevent this damaging ingestion. The <b>sealing</b> <b>air</b> is also used for rotor disc cooling. In this paper, a simplified axisymmetric computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of a gas turbine rotor-stator wheel-space is used to predict the effects of ingress on the flow and heat transfer. The steady flow computations are carried out using the CFD code ANSYS/CFX and the shear stress transport (SST) turbulence model. The rotational Reynolds number, inlet flow rates and thermal boundary settings are selected to represent the operating conditions of an ingress experimental rig, and comparisons are made between computations and measurements of heat transfer in the wheel-space. The computed heat transfer from the steady model (in terms of values of local Nusselt number on the rotor) is in broad agreement with measurements obtained using thermochromic liquid crystal in a transient experiment. Alternative wall-surface thermal boundary conditions are investigated in order to study the sensitivity of computed Nusselt numbers to these modelling assumptions...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe rim seals of gas {{turbines}} {{are used to}} prevent or reduce the ingestion of hot mainstream gas into the wheel-space between the turbine rotor and its adjacent stationary casing. The ingestion is caused by local pressure differences between the mainstream and the wheel-space; ingress usually occurs where the mainstream pressure is higher than that in the wheel-space and egress occurs where it is lower. <b>Sealing</b> <b>air,</b> which is supplied to the wheel-space, flows through the seal clearance and joins the mainstream flow. Too much <b>sealing</b> <b>air</b> is inefficient; too little can lead to disastrous consequences. The nozzle guide vanes create three-dimensional (3 D) variations {{in the distribution of}} pressure in the mainstream annulus and the turbine blades create unsteady effects. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is both time-consuming and expensive for these 3 D unsteady flows, and engine designers tend to use correlations or simple models to predict ingress. This paper describes the application of simple ‘orifice models’, the analytical solutions of which can be used to calculate the sealing effectiveness of turbine rim seals. The solutions agree well with available data for externally-induced ingress, where the effects of rotation are negligible, for rotationally-induced ingress, where the effects of the external flow are small, and for combined ingress, where the effects of both external flow and rotation are significant...|$|E

40|$|An aero-engine {{bearing chamber}} is a {{structure}} {{that is used to}} contain and collect oil used in lubricating and cooling the bearings supporting the high-speed engine shafts. There are various bearings in an aero-engine. Within the bearing chambers, there are typically the bearings, rotating shafts, seals and gears (in some designs). The walls of the bearing chamber are stationary and there are vents and sumps to take out the oil, via an offtake pipe, and the <b>sealing</b> <b>air.</b> The oil collected via the sump and vents is recycled and used again in the loop. To prevent oil degradation and reduce chance of coking in the chamber, it is desired that all of the oil goes through the recycling loop, with no oil staying longer than necessary in the chamber. The <b>sealing</b> <b>air</b> is used to maintain a positive pressure to keep the oil within the chamber. The flow inside a bearing chamber is highly turbulent and consists of a rotating mixture of oil and air. A smaller amount of the oil, mostly as oil-droplets, exits at the vents and is separated from the air using de-aerators [1]. It is expected that by gravity, most of the oil collects at the sump and can be easily scavenged. This is provided the sump can be large enough. The geometry of a bearing chamber is, however, complex largely because of space limitations. It is very important that oil is not resident longer than necessary to prevent over-heating and therefore deterioration or coking. Experimental observations by Chandra & Simmons [2], have shown that bearing chambers with deep sumps perform better that those with shallow sumps. Since shallow sumps are inevitable, a number of innovative studies have been done to improve bearing chamber designs. The presence of air in the oil (e. g. as bubbles) reduces the efficiency of the scavenging pump. Other factors such as oil momentum and windage can take oil away from the off-take pipe potentially increasing oil residence volume. Chandra & Simmons [2] placed inserts such as grille cover, perforated plate, etc, on a side of the bearing wall and improvements in the residence volume were seen. In this work, we are looking at a detailed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation of one of the inserts that performed well. This will aid understanding of the flow characteristics of using an insert to improve oil residence in a bearing chamber...|$|E
