5|$|She and Tony meet up {{with her}} Israeli friend, Adam Eshel (Damon Dayoub), who gives them {{information}} on Bodnar's whereabouts and intentions. Bodnar contacts Ziva on the computer, urging her to walk away. They are able to track his location but are unable to apprehend him as he disappears into a crowd. Later, they learn that he is planning {{to pick up the}} diamonds from an ally (Willem Van Der Vegt) at a night club. While waiting to intercept him, Tony dances with Ziva both to help her get a better view of the area and to calm her agitated state of mind. Bodnar seems to appear, but when Ziva approaches him, she is stunned to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is Ilan's brother, Yaniv (Iddo Goldberg).|$|E

25|$|Concerning {{issue number}} 2 above one can {{consider}} so-called weave states. Ordinary measurements of geometric quantities are macroscopic, and planckian discreteness is smoothed out. The fabric of a T-shirt is analogous. At a distance it is a smooth curved two-dimensional surface. But a closer inspection we <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is actually composed {{of thousands of}} one-dimensional linked threads. The image of space given in LQG is similar, consider a very large spin network formed by {{a very large number}} of nodes and links, each of Planck scale. But probed at a macroscopic scale, it appears as a three-dimensional continuous metric geometry.|$|E

25|$|This event {{occurred}} {{shortly before}} Rosh Hashanah. On that holiday, {{as he lay}} dying, Rabbi Amnon asked to be carried into the synagogue, where he recited the original composition of Unetanneh Tokef with his last breath (the story contains an ambiguous phrase that some commentators interpreted as saying {{that he did not}} merely die but that his body miraculously vanished). Three days later, he appeared in a dream to Rabbi Kalonymus ben Meshullam (died 1096), one of the great scholars and liturgists of Mainz, and begged him to transcribe the prayer and to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was included in the text of the High Holiday services. Thus, the legend concludes, Unetanneh Tokef became a part of the standard liturgy.|$|E
25|$|Gershwin's all-black opera {{was also}} unpopular with some celebrated black artists. Harry Belafonte {{declined}} to play Porgy {{in the late}} 1950s film version, so the role went to Sidney Poitier. Betty Allen, president of The Harlem School of the Arts, admittedly loathed the piece, and Grace Bumbry, who excelled in the 1985 Metropolitan Opera production as Bess, made the often cited statement: I thought it beneath me, I felt I had worked far too hard, that we had come far too far to have to retrogress to 1935. My {{way of dealing with}} it was to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was really a piece of Americana, of American history, whether we liked it or not. Whether I sing it or not, it was still going to be there.|$|E
25|$|Bobby, who {{has been}} {{divorced}} from Pam {{for over a year}} and is now engaged to Jenna Wade, decides that he wants to remarry his ex-wife instead, and Pam agrees. The next morning, as Bobby is leaving Pam's house, someone drives a car at high speed toward Pam. Bobby shoves her out of the way just before she is hit but cannot {{get out of the way}} of the car in time to save himself. We <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is Katherine who was driving the car, and that she was also killed when her car crashed after running over Bobby. Bobby is rushed to the hospital, where he later dies. Pam, Jenna, J.R., Miss Ellie, Clayton, Ray and Donna were the people present at the time of Bobby's death.|$|E

25|$|Macedonski {{supported}} the lost cause {{until the very}} end, and refused {{to distance himself from}} Caion even as the latter admitted to the court that he had invented the story. His magazine also accused Caragiale of having copied Victorien Sardou's Rabagas for his O scrisoare pierdută, as well as Henri Chivot and Alfred Duru's Le Carnaval d'un Merle Blanc in D-ale carnavalului. In one memorable incident of 14 February 1902, while he was hosting a literary festivity at the Bucharest Athenaeum, Macedonski was heckled and responded by blowing a whistle. Forţa Morală was shut down soon after this episode. In parallel, the National Theater offered Caragiale a degree of satisfaction, when it decided to showcase Rabagas, leaving the public to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was only remotely similar to his play.|$|E
25|$|The Yamato {{arrives at}} Iskandar, but is {{met by a}} large Gamilas fleet that sends a {{spacecraft}} to obstruct the muzzle of the Wave Motion Cannon. With their main weapon disabled, Kodai makes the dangerous choice to conduct a random warp and ends up at {{the opposite side of}} Iskandar. They are surprised to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is lifeless, and in fact strongly resembles Earth in its presently irradiated state. It is then discovered that Gamilas and Iskandar are the same planet. The crew thinks it is a trap, but Kodai urges them to go ahead. He leads an attack party to the planet's surface against heavy Gamilas opposition. Much of the assault force is killed, and the remaining pilots stay behind to cover for Kodai, Sanada, Saito and Mori as they head for the coordinates.|$|E
25|$|The fairest {{solution}} would be to replay the game {{but it is not}} in my control...Naturally I feel embarrassed at the way that we won and feel extremely sorry for the Irish who definitely deserve to be in South Africa...I have said at the time and I will say again that 'yes' I handled the ball. I am not a cheat and never have been. It was an instinctive reaction to a ball that was coming extremely fast in a crowded penalty area....As a footballer you do not have the luxury of the television to slow the pace of the ball down 100 times {{to be able to make}} a conscious decision...People are viewing a slow motion version of what happened and not what I or any other footballer faces in the game. If people look at it in full speed you will <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was an instinctive reaction.|$|E

25|$|Captain Tracy {{and a small}} crew left Newburyport for Boston {{to take on a}} full crew for {{a six-month}} patrol. As the ship rounded Cape Ann, they spotted another sail. As the Yankee Hero was short-handed, Tracy decided to let it pass. However, some local sailors rendezvoused with them at sea and told them that several {{transports}} had been seen close to the Cape that day. Supplemented with fourteen of the local men, bringing his crew to 40 (other accounts say 52), Tracy set after the distant ship. When they had approached to within six miles, they could <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a ship of war, the HMS Milford. Still short-handed and ill-prepared for a fight, the Captain changed his mind again and ordered the ship around. However, the Milford had spotted them by this time and gave chase. Heavily outgunned and outmanned, the Yankee Hero's crew was decimated and the ship disabled. At least four of the crew were killed and thirteen wounded, including Captain Tracy.|$|E
500|$|When Wodehouse {{heard of}} the furore the {{broadcasts}} had caused, he contacted the Foreign Office—through the Swiss embassy in Berlin—to explain his actions, and attempted to return home via neutral countries, but the German authorities refused to let him leave. In Performing Flea, a 1953 collection of letters, Wodehouse wrote, [...] "Of course I ought {{to have had the}} sense to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a loony thing to do to use the German radio for even the most harmless stuff, but I didn't. I suppose prison life saps the intellect". The reaction in America was mixed: the left-leaning publication P.M. accused Wodehouse of [...] "play Jeeves to the Nazis", but the Department of War used the interviews as an ideal representation of anti-Nazi propaganda.|$|E
500|$|Sam begs Ruby {{to teach}} him how to use his abilities, but she tells him that it is too late. Dean accepts his fate as the clock strikes midnight, but runs from the {{approaching}} hellhound. The three barricade themselves inside a room, but Dean quickly realizes that Lilith has taken over Ruby's host. Claiming to have sent Ruby [...] "far, far away", Lilith telekinetically pins the brothers down and lets in the hellhound. As Dean is mauled to death, Lilith blasts Sam with white energy from her hand. Horrified to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> has no effect, she flees her host before Sam can retaliate. A devastated Sam cradles Dean, whose soul is then shown in Hell hanging from a vast landscape of chains and meathooks while fruitlessly screaming for Sam.|$|E

500|$|Wayne Scholes, {{owner of}} the Telford Tigers (currently in the English Premier League) has stated that his {{organisation}} doesn't have any immediate plans to make the step up, but has not ruled {{out the possibility of}} joining the EIHL in the future, saying that “We have had conversations with the Elite League before but they have to invite you. You can’t approach them. It {{is one of those things}} where they want to see that you have got two or three years of really good solid success. They want to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is sustainable and that you are up to a certain standard, and then they will reach out. At that point, it’s a discussion that we will have but right now we are pretty happy where we are." ...|$|E
500|$|Boycott's slow scoring led to {{increasing}} media pressure, and owing to his perceived selfish attitude, he was {{dropped from the}} team after the match. He remembered in 1987 that [...] "the decision stunned me at the time, though looking back now I <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had become inevitable. I was mortified with embarrassment and filled with an angry, burning sense of injustice which I can remember clearly and painfully to this day." [...] A combination of low confidence and a throat infection limited Boycott to two further Test appearances, playing once more against India and once against Pakistan, {{for the rest of}} the year. He nevertheless again topped the domestic averages with 1260 at 48.46. In 1967, Boycott toured the West Indies with England, where he hit a rich seam of form. He scored 463 runs at 66.14 in a series England won 1–0.|$|E
500|$|Benjamin's {{view that}} slavery should {{continue}} {{was based in}} his belief that citizens {{had a right to}} their property as guaranteed by the Constitution. As Butler put it, [...] "he could no more <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was right for Northern people to rob him of his slave than it would be for him to connive at horse stealing". He avoided the arguments of some that the slaves were inferior beings, and that their position was ordained by God: Evans ascribes this to Benjamin not being raised as a slaveowner, but coming to it later in life. Benjamin joined in a widespread view of white Southerners that the African American would not be ready for emancipation for many years, if ever. They feared that freeing the slaves would ruin many and lead to murders and rapes by the newly liberated of their former masters and mistresses. Such a massacre had been feared by Southerners since the Haitian Revolution, the violent revolt known as [...] "Santo Domingo" [...] in the South, in which the slaves of what became Haiti killed many whites and mulattoes in 1804 while gaining independence from French control. When the anti-slavery book Uncle Tom's Cabin was published in 1852, Benjamin spoke out against Harriet Beecher Stowe's portrayal. He said that slaves were for the most part well treated, and plantation punishments, such as whipping or branding, were more merciful than sentences of imprisonment that a white man might receive in the North for similar conduct.|$|E

500|$|The 19th-century clergyman and {{antiquarian}} Harry Longueville Jones {{disputed the}} need to replace the old church and condemned its [...] "melancholy fate", describing the reasons for its demise as [...] "pretexts". In his view {{the only part of}} the church that needed repair was the [...] "ruinous" [...] western end (which had been [...] "badly constructed in the first instance"), yet this part was saved while the [...] "good portions of the building" [...] were destroyed. [...] Furthermore, the cost of the new church was more than double the cost of repairs to the medieval church, which could have [...] "endure for ages to come". He added that it might have been thought to be safe, as it was so close to Lord Boston's house and thus [...] "under the shadow of the lord of the domain", and he condemned the [...] "evil hour" [...] in which [...] "the ruthless hand of the destroyer was allowed to be lifted against it by those whose first duty it was to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> took no harm". He stated that [...] "when buildings, dedicated to God's service by the piety of former ages, are allowed to be treated in this manner by the constituted authorities of the land... the institutions to which they are attached cannot be expected to find greater favour at the hands of the fickle and ignorant multitude." [...] He also noted that the new church was only a little larger than its predecessor.|$|E
