In 2015, Dragon TV (SMG media holding channel) {{was added to the}} SPB TV application. In 2015, SPB TV signed an agreement with CNTV, Chinese internet-television (CCTV tele-holding’s affiliate) for broadcasting its CCTV-4 (Chinese International), CCTV-9 Documentary, CCTV News, CCTV Français, CCTV Español, CCTV Russian and CCTV Arabian channels. In 2016, the new <b>service</b> <b>Belt</b> and Road TV was launched, available worldwide on all popular operating systems and via all internet connections.|$|E
60|$|Old Von der Tann, {{the light}} of a new hope firing his eyes, threw aside his cloak and leaped to the chancel steps beside Butzow and the others who were {{mounting}} them. Behind him a hundred cloaks dropped from the shoulders of his fighting men, exposing not silks and satins and fine velvet, but the coarse tan of khaki, and grim cartridge belts well filled, and stern revolvers slung to well-worn <b>service</b> <b>belts.</b>|$|R

5000|$|A multi-groove, V-Ribbed, or polygroove belt {{is made up}} of usually between 3 and 24 [...] "V" [...] shaped {{sections}} alongside each other. This gives a thinner belt for {{the same}} drive surface, thus it is more flexible, although often wider. The added flexibility offers an improved efficiency, as less energy is wasted in the internal friction of continually bending the belt. In practice this gain of efficiency causes a reduced heating effect on the belt, and a cooler-running belt lasts longer in <b>service.</b> <b>Belts</b> are commercially available in several sizes, with usually a 'P' (sometimes omitted) and a single letter identifying the pitch between grooves. The 'PK' section with a pitch of 3.56 mm is commonly used for automotive applications.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This article {{deals with}} {{adaptive}} {{control of the}} belt conveyor preloading. One of the main factors influencing the behaviour of the belt conveyor is preload of conveyor belt. Adaptive control of this parameter is possible to optimize the <b>service</b> parameters of <b>belt</b> conveyors. The function of adaptive control of the belt conveyor preloading is experimentally verified...|$|R
50|$|Originally {{there were}} two {{regional}} variations of STV +1 on Freeview; one for north and one for central Scotland. The north used to receive the Aberdeen-based news and advertisements and the Central <b>Belt</b> <b>service</b> carried the Edinburgh-based news and advertisements allowing viewers in the East who could watch STV's 6pm & 10:30pm news programmes for the micro-region to watch the bulletins an hour later.|$|R

M/F Kong Frederik IX was preserved {{as a museum}} in Nyborg from 1997 to 2001, but scrapped in 2005 despite continued efforts to save it. There are ongoing efforts to return the former M/F Sjælland, currently a restaurant and nightclub ship named Princess Selandia, from Barrow-in-Furness, England, to restoration in Denmark {{as part of a}} ferry museum.|$|R
5000|$|In 1892, the Belt Line was {{purchased}} by the Lynn and Boston Street Railway. When the Eastern Railroad undertook a [...] for its Boston-Portland mainline, the line's circuit was disrupted, leading {{to the use of}} an alternate, parallel line. Many customers continued to use this alternate line after <b>service</b> to the <b>Belt</b> Line was restored, leading to a motion for abandonment. East Lynn residents protested the abandonment, claiming it would leave them without proper access to the Central and Narrow Gauge railroad stations, as well as several large industries.|$|R
5000|$|HMS Little Belt was the mercantile sloop Friends Good Will, {{launched}} in 1811, which the British captured {{shortly after the}} start of the War of 1812. The British took her into <b>service</b> as Little <b>Belt,</b> armed her with three guns, and incorporated her into the Royal Navys Lake Erie fleet. The American schooner [...] captured her during the Battle of Lake Erie and the Americans took her into service under her existing name. A storm drove her ashore in October 1813 and a British expeditionary force burnt her in December 1813.|$|R

50|$|In 1936 Bonus had fifty {{residents}} and two residents. Throughout its history the community received a low volume of mail. The post office was discontinued {{three times before}} the final closing in 1940; since then residents received mail in Eagle Lake and Egypt. In 1940 the Eldridge to Bonus rail link ended. The rail bed became a county road. In the 1980s the community had 42 {{residents and}} no reported businesses. In 1992 the Cane <b>Belt</b> <b>service</b> ended. This led to {{the removal of the}} gravel bed, ties, and tracks. In 2000 Bonus had 42 residents.|$|R
25|$|In {{the years}} after the war a train crew's workday usually started at Sealy at 6:45 am and ended at Matagorda at 10:45 pm. The crews stayed {{overnight}} in bunk cars at Matagorda and began the return journey the next day. Each train typically carried an engineer, fireman, conductor and two brakemen. During harvest season a third brakeman was added to the crews. Cane <b>Belt</b> <b>service</b> was unpopular and the more senior workers of the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe usually opted to work on the Galveston main line. Passenger service was included on the Cane Belt by attaching a car {{to the end of the}} trains. In December 1948, the Cane Belt was absorbed by the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway and the railroad ceased to exist.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the fellow}} {{students}} on his SOE course in 1943 {{had been a}} 19-year-old WAAF officer. Already having two years of <b>service</b> under her <b>belt,</b> she had then volunteered for SOE. She was also training for special operations and, like Guy, was parachuted into France before D-Day, though into a different district and 'Reseau', {{in the department of}} the Sarthe. She worked as a courier for Hudson's Reseau 'Headmaster' {{on the edge of the}} Normandy Landings. The work was dangerous and she was arrested. However, she managed to maintain her cover and was released, surviving through to liberation by the advancing ground forces. This 20-year-old veteran was herself later decorated. When the couple had both returned to Britain on the successful completion of their separate missions, they were reunited and were quickly married. Assistant Section Officer Sonya Butt, MBE, war heroine, became Mrs. Sonia d'Artois and quietly disappeared from public view to become a wife and mother. Though not unique, by any means, this must have been one of the most distinguished romances of the war.|$|R
50|$|The first {{company of}} the unit was {{organized}} on October 23, 1864, but since the low enlistments numbers the companies were individually sent to the front, and were temporarily attached to the 4th New Jersey Volunteer Infantry in the First New Jersey Brigade. It was officially organized and mustered in as a whole on March 10, 1865, when the last company {{was sent to the}} front. Owing largely to high bounties paid out and a smaller pool of available men of age since the war was in its later days, the unit suffered heavy desertion rates - the highest of any New Jersey infantry regiment. Its commander, Colonel Stephen Rose Gilkyson, had previously commanded the 6th New Jersey Volunteer Infantry as a lieutenant colonel, and had several years of combat field <b>service</b> under his <b>belt.</b> Likewise, most of the 40th's officer corps were combat veterans from previous New Jersey regiments. Due to the haphazard way the unit was organized, many officers served in their duty in the field long before they were officially mustered in.|$|R
50|$|At exit 8, the Belt Parkway {{connects to}} Coney Island Avenue, {{approaching}} the namesake bay as it continues east. Paralleling Emmons Avenue through Sheepshead Bay, the parkway enters exit 9A eastbound, which connects to Knapp Street and exit 9B, {{which is a}} ramp to {{the eastern end of}} Emmons Avenue. Westbound, exit 9 services Knapp Street. Crossing south of Gerritsen Beach, the parkway passes south of the Plum Beach Channel and passes a small rest area on the eastbound lanes. Turning northeast through the Floyd Bennett Field area, the parkway bends north and passes a service area with gas services in the median. Just north of the <b>service</b> area, the <b>Belt</b> enters exit 11N-S, a cloverleaf interchange which connects to Flatbush Avenue and the Rockaways.After exit 11N, the Belt Parkway continues east through Floyd Bennett Field, crossing over the Mill Basin Drawbridge into Brooklyn Beach and passes the entrance to the Jamaica Bay Riding Academy, the only business served directly on the parkway. Crossing over another bridge, the parkway enters the Canarsie section of Brooklyn. The parkway, now running northeast, parallels a bicycle path, reaching Canarsie Pier and exit 13, which serves as the southern end of Rockaway Parkway. Crossing over another bridge over Spring Creek, the parkway enters exit 14, which connects to Pennsylvania Avenue in Starrett City. The interchange is adjacent to the former Pennsylvania Avenue Landfill. After crossing another waterway, Hendrix Creek, the Belt passes the former Fountain Avenue Landfill and enters exit 15, a diamond interchange with Erskine Street leading to the Gateway Center shopping complex.|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} {{conveying}} practice demonstrates that belt conveyors provide a versatile and. much-used method of transporting bulk materials, but {{a review of}} belting manufacturers' design procedures shows that belt design and selection rules are often based on experience with all-cotton belts no longer in common use, and are net completely relevant to modern synthetic constructions. In particular, provision of the property "load support", which was not critical with cotton belts, is shown to determine the outcome of most belt selection exercises and lead to gross over specification of other design properties in many cases. The results of an original experimental investigation into this property, carried out to determine the belt and conveyor parameters that affect it, how the major role that belt stiffness plays in its provision; {{the basis for a}} belt stiffness test relevant to service conditions is given. A proposal for a more rational method of specifying load support data results from the work, but correlation of the test results with service performance is necessary before the absolute toad support capability required from a belt for given working conditions can be quantified. A study to attain this correlation is the major proposal for future work resulting from the present investigation, but a full review of the literature on conveyor design and a study of present practice within the belting industry demonstrate other, less critical, factors that could profitably be investigated. It is suggested that the most suitable method of studying these would be a rational data collection system to provide information on various facets of <b>belt</b> <b>service</b> behaviour; a basis for such a system is proposed. In addition to the work above, proposals for simplifying the present belt selection methods are made and a strain transducer suitable for use in future experimental investigations is developed...|$|R
5000|$|Puzzled by an {{apparent}} three-minute time discrepancy - revealed by a perusal of a stopwatch that was active during the switch - Cramden visits former agent Derek Flint at his New York City home. Greeted by Flints' three female live-in companions {{in the living}} room of Flint's spacious Manhattan apartment, Cramden is informed that Flint is experimenting with the creation a dolphin language dictionary. Flint tells Cramden these undersea mammals are intelligent creatures and that they use sounds or sonics to communicate, a notion that had been only relatively recently reinforced by scientific experimentation at the time the film was produced. Flint then shows Cramden a sonic device of his own invention that is integrated into a cigarette lighter (and that, amongst many other uses mentioned - 82 are claimed for the gadget - is later revealed to <b>service</b> as a <b>belt</b> buckle), first moving and then shattering a white cue ball on the pool table. Cramden requests that Flint investigate the [...] "lost" [...] three minutes recorded by the stopwatch. Flint agrees to take up the matter after his return from a survival exercise in the Mojave Desert. During their meeting, Lisa Norton (Jean Hale), an operative of Fabulous Face, is meeting with Flint's three live-in girl friends, where she tricks the girls into accepting a free visit to the Fabulous Face Spa in the Virgin Islands. That evening Cramden encounters Norton, whom Fabulous Face has re-tasked to deal with his unexpected interference with their plans, at an Italian restaurant. Disguised as a southern schoolteacher visiting the city, she drugs him using cigarettes treated with a soporific substance and stages a compromising scene with a prostitute at a hotel; the scene is then photographed and published under the auspices of General Carter (Steve Ihnat), who is working with Fabulous Face. With Cramden framed as a libertine, the [...] "imposter" [...] President publicly suspends the disgraced spy chief from active duty.|$|R
