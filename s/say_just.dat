25|$|The {{number of}} dead is also {{difficult}} to determine. Sources claim 252, 260, 262, 264, 266, and 274 dead. The {{number of dead}} {{is complicated by the}} fact that several members of the crew died after the initial explosion. But even these figures vary. Some sources <b>say</b> <b>just</b> 6 later died of their injuries, while others claim 8 did so.|$|E
25|$|Dolphins {{are often}} {{regarded}} as one of Earth's most intelligent animals, though it is hard to <b>say</b> <b>just</b> how intelligent. Comparing species' relative intelligence is complicated by differences in sensory apparatus, response modes, and nature of cognition. Furthermore, the difficulty and expense of experimental work with large aquatic animals has so far prevented some tests and limited sample size and rigor in others. Compared to many other species, however, dolphin behavior has been studied extensively, both in captivity and in the wild. See cetacean intelligence for more details.|$|E

500|$|In May 1890 Van Gogh {{left the}} clinic in Saint-Rémy to move nearer to both Dr Paul Gachet in Auvers-sur-Oise and to Theo. Gachet was an amateur painter and had treated several other artists – Camille Pissarro had {{recommended}} him.

500|$|Climate {{scientists}} {{agree that}} climate change {{increases the likelihood of}} stronger and wetter storms, though possibly leading to fewer of them. However, researchers were unable to <b>say</b> <b>just</b> how responsible climate change was for the development and track of Sandy. Tropical cyclones derive their energy from warm waters, and warmer water generally means stronger storms. Climate change has caused sea levels to rise, which made the storm surge and coastal flooding caused by Sandy much more devastating. Since the overall sea level has risen by [...] between 1902 and 2007, and is accelerating, the rise in sea level increases the risk for major floods to occur every time a storm hits. A 2012 paper in Nature projected {{that climate change}} could lead to floods that should occur only once a century to happening every three to twenty years.|$|E
500|$|Early on, Young {{established}} himself {{as one of the}} harder-throwing pitchers in the game. Bill James wrote that Zimmer often put a piece of beefsteak inside his baseball glove to protect his catching hand from Young's fastball. In the absence of radar guns, however, it is impossible to <b>say</b> <b>just</b> how hard Young actually threw. Young continued to perform at a high level during the 1890 season. On {{the last day of the}} season, Young won both games of a doubleheader. In the first weeks of Young's career, Cap Anson, the player-manager of the Chicago Colts spotted Young's ability. Anson told Spiders' manager Gus Schmelz, [...] "He's too green to do your club much good, but I believe if I taught him what I know, I might make a pitcher out of him in a couple of years. He's not worth it now, but I'm willing to give you $1,000 ($ today) for him." [...] Schmelz replied, [...] "Cap, you can keep your thousand and we'll keep the rube." ...|$|E

500|$|Several critics {{suggested}} that the piece {{may have been too}} sophisticated for its audience—or at least, the audience that greeted its first performance on Boxing Night. The Times wrote: [...] "The dialogue throughout is superior in ability and point to that with which ordinary burlesque and extravaganza have familiarized us; so much so, in fact, that it was a daring experiment to produce such a piece on such a night. It met, however, with an excellent reception, and on any other occasion than Boxing Night the numerous merits of the piece cannot fail to secure for it in the public estimation a high place among the novelties of the season." [...] Other reviews of the first night took up a similar theme: Sporting Life {{suggested that}} [...] "It may be that they looked for something less polished than Mr. Gilbert's verse, and went for something broader and coarser than that delightful author's humour. It may be, too, that Thespis was a little—I only <b>say,</b> <b>just</b> a little—'over their heads'." [...] The Orchestra carried a similar sentiment: [...] "In fact, both music and idea were somewhat {{over the heads of the}} audience." ...|$|E
500|$|Australian and American {{media were}} {{generally}} welcoming to the album; John Mangan from Australia's The Age newspaper commended the diverse set of styles and Minogue's songwriting skills, saying [...] "Impossible Princess sounds right and constitutes another {{step in the}} right direction." [...] Similarly, an editor at Who magazine commended the sound, and pointed out that [...] "Vocally, Kylie has never sounded better or more human. Her phrasing here is unique." [...] In conclusion, they acknowledged that [...] "Impossible Princess is the best, most complete work of her career." [...] Cameron Adams, writing for Herald Sun, listed the record as his [...] "CD of the Week"; He favored the singles as the album's best tracks, but also said, [...] "Impossible Princess is her best yet, the classey, personal pop album she has always threatened." [...] Michael Dwyer, writing for the Western Mail highlighted the [...] "club-dance" [...] tracks as the better cuts, while examining that [...] "Impossible Princess range of styles approaches and collaborators makes it as hard as ever to <b>say</b> <b>just</b> who is making progress here, but progress it most assuredly is." [...] Larry Flick from American magazine Billboard described the album as [...] "stunning", concluding that [...] "it's a golden commercial opportunity for a major record company with vision and energy to release it in the United States...".|$|E
500|$|Despite this, member Lisa [...] "Left Eye" [...] Lopes was the opposite. She {{threatened}} to wear black tape {{over her mouth}} on the song's music video due to her disagreement with its message and the choice {{for it to be}} CrazySexyCool lead single, partially because of the group's history of advocating for safe sex since their debut. [...] "I was totally, 100% against 'Creep'. I wasn't down with cheating on your man, you know, for me, it's be faithful. Trust me, I fought against that single coming out. You know, I was like 'If a girl is gonna [...] catch her man cheating,' this was my thing, 'instead of telling her to cheat back, why don't we tell her [...] just leave,'" [...] she shared. In the end, Lopes eventually capitulated, stating: [...] "If some people can creep, and in their minds, they can feel better by going out doing the same thing... Fine. I'm just not one of those people." [...] She instead added her new rap verse on remixed versions of the song, which talks about the consequences of cheating. Thomas later thought the song and the video's choreography routine were [...] "cool" [...] enough to distract people from its lyrical content and [...] "just sing along." [...] "Even the song 'Creep'—not that we creep, but if we did, [...] for a woman that would do such a thing. I <b>say</b> <b>just</b> leave his ass, but if you're not ready to just jet at the moment, then you know, I guess we told you how to [...] We were really happy and we still are really happy to be the voice for so many women in so many different situations in their lives," [...] she told Myspace in 2014. Jon Parales of The New York Times stood by the song's concept, he wrote: [...] "The women sing about infidelity, revenge, status and power plays, not as victims but as contenders; when they're cheated on, they cheat, too." [...] Carol Cooper from The Guardian also described the track as the darker side of their [...] "giddy hedonism." ...|$|E

The least deviation from the Rule entailed corporal punishment, or a severe form of fasting.
