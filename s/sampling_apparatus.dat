50|$|Many {{autosamplers}} {{for liquids}} {{consist of a}} carousel and the <b>sampling</b> <b>apparatus.</b> The carousel holds the samples, and revolves around its center so that samples change their horizontal position. There may be several concentric rings holding samples in a carousel. The <b>sampling</b> <b>apparatus</b> can be fixed horizontally, only {{moving up and down}} to allow the carousel to move, or it can also move horizontally, depending on the design of the system. The <b>sampling</b> <b>apparatus</b> in most of such autosamplers consist of a needle connected to a remote pumping syringe via tubing. Similar designs have been employed for titrators, which do not have a <b>sampling</b> <b>apparatus,</b> but a titration apparatus.|$|E

40|$|A {{comparison}} {{is made of}} measurements {{of the effect of}} axial tensile strain on the critical current of multifilamentary Nb{sub 3 }Sn superconductors by three different laboratories. Two of the laboratories used short <b>sample</b> testing <b>apparatus</b> wherein a straight section of conductor was cooled in a force-free state. One of the laboratories used a spring apparatus wherein a long sample was reacted in a coil shape and attached to a spring sample holder.

To make a comparison with the data obtained using the spring method, it was necessary to fit the data to the compressive prestrain determined using the straight-sample technique. With such a fit, the agreement was variable, between 15 and 25 % depending on the conductor. Values of the prestrain and irreversible strain obtained from the straight sample data agreed within 0. 06 % and 0. 05 % respectively.

In contrast, a current permafrost sampling system that the RATRAP is intended to supplant works by scraping with tines followed by picking up the scrapings in a scoop, sometimes taking hours to acquire a few grams.
