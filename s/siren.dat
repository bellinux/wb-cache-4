5|$|Surmising the <b>Siren</b> {{is using}} {{water as a}} portal, the Doctor instructs {{everyone}} to seek refuge in the ship's dry magazine. There, they find Toby Avery (Oscar Lloyd), {{the son of the}} ship's captain Henry Avery (Hugh Bonneville), who stowed away on the ship in order to join the crew after his mother died, unaware of his father's illicit deeds. He too has a black spot on his palm due to a fever. In an attempt to escape, the Doctor and Avery board the TARDIS, but find it is acting haphazardly, and are forced to evacuate, and they watch as it dematerializes by itself. After another shipmate is taken by the <b>Siren</b> in a dry room, the Doctor realizes the <b>Siren</b> is using reflection to appear. In response they rid the ship of reflective surfaces, including the ship's stolen treasure.|$|E

50|$|Xenia {{currently}} has {{a system of}} tornado <b>sirens.</b> After the 1974 tornado outbreak, the city purchased a system of Federal Signal Thunderbolt <b>Sirens</b> for warning. During the 2000 tornado strike, the lack of backup power silenced the <b>sirens,</b> so the city purchased Federal Signal 2001-SRN series <b>sirens</b> with battery backup. Most of Xenia's old <b>sirens</b> are still standing, but not operational.|$|R
5000|$|Belgium tests its air-raid <b>sirens</b> every first Thursday of the trimester. When the air-raid <b>sirens</b> are tested, {{the message}} [...] "proefsignaal" [...] or [...] "signal d'essai" [...] is {{pronounced}} {{every time the}} <b>sirens</b> work. There are 540 <b>sirens</b> placed all across the country.|$|R
5|$|When a storm begins, {{the crew}} start to set sail. Toby drops a {{polished}} crown while bringing his father a coat. The <b>Siren</b> is summoned and takes Toby. Soon, Rory {{falls into the}} ocean, and the Doctor rationalises that the <b>Siren</b> has shown intelligence and will likely get to Rory before he drowns and convinces her to save him. Believing the victims are not dead, the Doctor convinces Avery and Amy to prick themselves to get the <b>Siren</b> to take them. The Doctor's suspicions are confirmed when the Siren's touch actually teleports them to an alien spaceship, invisible {{in the same spot}} the pirate ship is located.|$|E
5|$|In 1867, it was {{determined}} a new tower needed to be built and the new structure was completed in 1868. The new lighthouse was a keeper's quarters with an attached lantern on the roof. The structure is of the same design as lighthouses at Sheffield Island in Norwalk; Morgan Point in Noank; Old Field Point Light and Plum Island in New York; and Block Island North in Rhode Island. The dwelling is made of granite and the lantern made of cast iron. The original Fresnel lens was installed in the new tower. In 1890, a fog whistle was installed {{and it would be}} replaced by a <b>siren</b> in 1905. The <b>siren</b> caused much distress to nearby residents and had to be modified.|$|E

25|$|Many fire <b>sirens</b> (used {{for calling}} the {{volunteer}} fire fighters) serve double duty as tornado or civil defense <b>sirens,</b> alerting an entire community of impending danger. Most fire <b>sirens</b> are either {{mounted on the}} roof of a fire station or on a pole next to the fire station. Fire <b>sirens</b> can also be mounted on or near government buildings, on tall structures such as water towers, as well as in systems where several <b>sirens</b> are distributed around a town for better sound coverage. Most fire <b>sirens</b> are single tone and mechanically driven by electric motors with a rotor attached to the shaft. Some newer <b>sirens</b> are electronically driven speakers.|$|R

Amy convinces the <b>Siren</b> to release Rory into her care. Using Rory's nursing knowledge, Amy and the Doctor remove him from life support and are able to resuscitate him. Meanwhile, Avery decides to stay with his son and his crew, unable to go back to England himself while the ship will care for his crew. Avery takes the helm of the spaceship and, along with Toby and his crew, sets off to explore the stars.|$|E

5000|$|... 1,078 {{electronic}} warning <b>sirens</b> {{are installed}} in Denmark. The <b>sirens</b> {{are placed on}} the top of buildings or on masts. This warning system makes it possible to warn the population in all urban areas with more than 1,000 inhabitants. This means that about 80% of Denmark's population can be warned by means of the stationary <b>sirens.</b> The remaining 20% will be warned by mobile <b>sirens</b> mounted on police cars. The function of the <b>sirens</b> is tested every night, without producing any sound. Once every year, on the first Wednesday of May at 12:00, the <b>sirens</b> will be tested with sound.|$|R

5|$|Falkner Island Light {{was chosen}} for fog-signal {{experiments}} in 1865 and in 1902. In 1865, Joseph Henry of the Smithsonian Institution, the Chairman of the Lighthouse Board, set up bells and whistles and tested the distances they could be heard. In 1879, a steam fog whistle was installed {{at the cost of}} $5000. In 1902, a air <b>siren</b> was installed and powered by two 16Â½ horsepower engines and used in an experiment in sound penetration. In 1934, a Leslie-Tyfon trumpet was installed.|$|E
5|$|Many unpitched {{percussion}} instruments, {{such as the}} snare drum or maracas, {{make use}} of the presence of random sounds or noise to produce a sound without any perceived pitch. See timbre. Unpitched percussion is typically used to maintain a rhythm or to provide accents, and its sounds are unrelated to the melody and harmony of the music. Within the orchestra unpitched percussion is termed auxiliary percussion, and this subsection of the percussion section includes all unpitched instruments of the orchestra no matter how they are played, for example the pea whistle and <b>siren.</b>|$|E

5|$|The French 55th Infantry Division was not {{prepared}} for such an attack. French soldiers had commented on the massive psychological effect of the bombardment, in particular the <b>siren</b> of the Ju 87. However, after the war, {{it was discovered that}} none of the bunkers had been destroyed by direct hits. Moreover, just 56 French casualties were suffered. It was the indirect effect that did the damage. The telecommunication cables were destroyed (most had been laid out in the open) through bombing, paralysing the division's communications, and the psychological damage crippled its defensive capacity.|$|E
5|$|The longer {{version of}} The Last Road to Hell {{is no longer}} found in the film's negatives, but it was {{included}} in the original Dutch Ultrabit DVD release by EC Entertainment in 1999.

5|$|Following a {{distress}} signal, the TARDIS lands {{aboard a}} 17th-century pirate ship {{stranded in the}} middle of an ocean. The ship's crew have been terrorised by a Siren-like creature (Lily Cole) who marks people with black spots on their palms after they are injured. Her song then lulls victims into a trance, making them want to go to her, which apparently disintegrates them. Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill) receives a cut during a tussle with the pirates, and finds a black spot on his hand, but is prevented from succumbing to the song of the <b>Siren</b> by Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and the Doctor (Matt Smith).|$|E

50|$|Singapore {{currently}} has {{a network of}} over 2,000 stationary <b>sirens</b> named the Public Warning System which warns the entire country of war air raids, man-made and natural disasters (except earth tremors). On {{the first day of}} every month Singapore's <b>sirens</b> are tested. During the test, the <b>sirens</b> sounds a light but cheerful chime instead of any of its three signals, which led to the population's speculations of the <b>sirens</b> reminding them of the start of each month. The <b>sirens</b> look very similar to the ECN3000 Israel version pictured on the upper right.|$|R
