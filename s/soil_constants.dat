40|$|The coupled {{mechanical}} and water retention elasto-plastic constitutive model of Wheeler, Sharma and Buisson (the Glasgow coupled model, GCM) predicts unique unsaturated isotropic normal compression and unsaturated critical state planar surfaces for specific volume {{and degree of}} saturation when soil states are {{at the intersection of}} mechanical (M) and wetting retention (WR) yield surfaces. Experimental results from tests performed by Sivakumar on unsaturated samples of compacted speswhite kaolin confirm the existence and form of these unique surfaces. The GCM provides consistent representation of transitions between saturated and unsaturated conditions, including the influence of retention hysteresis and the effect of plastic volumetric strains on retention behaviour, and it gives unique expressions to predict saturation and de-saturation conditions (air-exclusion and air-entry points, respectively). Mechanical behaviour is modelled consistently across these transitions, including appropriate variation of mechanical yield stress under both saturated and unsaturated conditions. The expressions defining the unsaturated isotropic normal compression planar surfaces for specific volume and degree of saturation are central {{to the development of a}} relatively straightforward methodology for determining values of all GCM parameters (<b>soil</b> <b>constants</b> and initial state) from a limited number of laboratory tests.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to {{investigate}} very small strain elastic behaviour of soils under unsaturated conditions, using bender/extender element (BEE) testing. The behaviour of soils at very small strains has been widely studied under saturated conditions, whereas much less work has been performed on very small strain behaviour under unsaturated conditions. A suction-controlled double wall triaxial apparatus for unsaturated soil testing was modified to incorporate three pairs of BEEs transmitting both shear and compression waves with vertical and horizontal directions of wave transmission and wave polarisation. Various different techniques for measuring wave travel time were investigated in both the time domain and the frequency domain and it was concluded that, {{at least for the}} current experimental testing programme, peak-to-first-peak in the time domain was the most reliable technique for determining wave travel time. An experimental test programme was performed on samples of compacted speswhite kaolin clay. Two different forms of compaction were employed (i. e. isotropic and anisotropic). Compacted kaolin soil samples were subjected to constant suction loading and unloading stages at three different values of suction, covering both unsaturated conditions (s= 50 kPa and s= 300 kPa) and saturated conditions (s= 0). Loading and unloading stages were performed at three different values of stress ratio (η= 0, η= 1 and η=- 1). In some tests a wetting-drying cycle was performed before or within the loading stage, with the wetting-drying cycles including both wetting-induced swelling and wetting-induced collapse compression. BEE tests were performed at regular intervals throughout all test stages, to measure shear wave velocity Vs and compression wave velocity Vp and hence to determine values of shear modulus G and constrained modulus M. The experimental test programme was designed to investigate how very small strain shear modulus G and constrained modulus M varied with unsaturated state variables, including how anisotropy of these parameters developed either with stress state (stress-induced anisotropy) or with previous straining (strain-induced anisotropy). A new expression has been proposed for the very small strain shear modulus G of an isotropic soil under saturated and unsaturated conditions. This expression relates the variation of G to only mean Bishop’s stress p* and specific volume v, and it converges to a well-established expression for saturated soils as degree of saturation approaches 1. The proposed expression for G is able to predict the variation of G under saturated and unsaturated conditions at least as well as existing expressions from the literature and it is considerably simpler (employing fewer state variables and fewer <b>soil</b> <b>constants).</b> In addition, unlike existing expressions from the literature, the values of <b>soil</b> <b>constants</b> in the proposed new expression can be determined from a saturated test. It appeared that, in the current project at least, any strain-induced anisotropy of very small strain elastic behaviour was relatively modest, {{with the possible exception of}} loading in triaxial extension. It was therefore difficult to draw any firm conclusion about evolution of strain-induced anisotropy and whether it depended upon the same aspects of soil fabric as evolution of anisotropy of large strain plastic behaviour. Stress-induced anisotropy of very small strain elastic behaviour was apparent in the experimental test programme. An attempt was made to extend the proposed expression for G to include the effect of stress-induced anisotropy. Interpretation of the experimental results indicated that the value of shear modulus was affected by the values of all three principal Bishop’s stresses (in the direction of wave transmission, the direction of wave polarisation and the third mutually perpendicular direction). However, prediction of stress-induced anisotropy was only partially successful, and it was concluded that the effect of Lode angle was also significant...|$|E
40|$|A {{numerical}} FE homogenization {{approach for}} {{the interpretation of}} existing crack patterns induced by founda-tion settlement on old masonry buildings is discussed. The approach is quite general and may be applied to any case study.

Soil is modeled by means of elastic translational springs, with values derived from at hand simplified approaches. The case study analyzed is the so called “Siloteca” [1] building in Milan, Italy, which belongs to a more complex built ag-gregate, originally conceived by the French Napoleonic army as riding stable during the Cisalpina Republic.

The masonry face texture is relatively regular and well organized; its section is constituted of three leaves of header bricks, one leaf being alternatively constituted by one-half brick. A quite large sub-vertical crack is present in the central long wall, at a distance of about 10 meters from the main façade, which is progressively rocking.

Using electromagnetic (EM) wave transmission through soil is one such nondestructive technique.

Relative permittivity is a complex value comprised of a real component (referred to herein as dielectric constant) and an imaginary component: however, {{the focus of the}} research is concentrated on the <b>soil's</b> dielectric <b>constant.</b> <b>Soil</b> parameters that govern the dielectric constant are: volumetric water content, bulk density, soil texture, soil structure, soluble ions, temperature, and measurement frequency.

(1980) model, Hendrickx et al. (2003) model and Wagner & Scheuermann (2009) /Hilhorst (1998) model (WSH model). The Topp et al. model is strictly empirical and the simplest of the three models correlating only volumetric water content to a <b>soil's</b> dielectric <b>constant.</b> The Hendrickx et al. and WSH models are theoretically derived with some empirical calibration and are inherently more complex, requiring more soil parameter inputs.

50|$|A ridgeway {{previously}} used by carts often remains physically {{evident in}} the form of a hollow way: a trench or fosse eroded deep into the <b>soil</b> by <b>constant</b> passage of wheels and hooves. These are most common at inclines. Sleds, axles scraping the soil between wheel ruts, locked wheels skidding downhill and heavy weights dragged over the ground to brake the carts' descents would all continue eroding the surface down to the bedrock, if any, which then forms a natural pavement.|$|R
40|$|Development and {{verification}} of a {{coefficient of permeability}} function for a deformable unsaturated soil Shangyan Huang, S. L. Barbour, and D. G. Fredlund Abstract: The modelling of flow through saturated/unsaturated soils has become routine in geotechnical and geo-environmental engineering. The analysis requires that the coefficient of permeability for an unsaturated soil be defined. The coefficient of permeability can be estimated based on currently available procedures. However, each procedure has limitations and consequently cares should be taken {{in the selection of}} a proper procedure. The coefficient of permeability of a saturated soil is a function of void ratio. The coefficient of permeability of an unsaturated <b>soil</b> of <b>constant</b> volume, {{is a function of the}} degree of saturation. However, soil is deformable and both the degree of saturation and the void-ratio influence the coefficient of permeability of a compressible, unsaturated soil. In this paper, the literature pertaining to the coefficient of permeability function for an unsaturated <b>soil</b> of <b>constant</b> volume and the coefficient of permeability for a deformable saturated soil are reviewed. A new coefficient of permeability function for a deformable unsaturated porous medium is then developed. A series of triaxial permeameter tests on unsaturated silty sand are described and the results from the experimental program are analyzed using th...|$|R
