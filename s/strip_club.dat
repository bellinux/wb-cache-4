5|$|Mary's Club is {{the oldest}} <b>strip</b> <b>club</b> in Portland, Oregon, in the United States. In 1954 Roy Keller bought the {{business}} from Mary Duerst Hemming, who owned and operated Mary's as a piano bar beginning in the 1930s.

Following the season, in April 2003, he was suspended again by the league for violations of its substance abuse program. The suspension ended his NHL career.|$|E
