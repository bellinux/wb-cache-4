5|$|In 1945, Glenn Seaborg, an American scientist, {{made the}} <b>suggestion</b> that the {{actinide}} elements, like the lanthanides, were filling an f sub-level. Before {{this time the}} actinides {{were thought to be}} forming a fourth d-block row. Seaborg's colleagues advised him not to publish such a radical <b>suggestion</b> as it would most likely ruin his career. As Seaborg considered he did not then have a career to bring into disrepute, he published anyway. Seaborg's <b>suggestion</b> was found to be correct and he subsequently {{went on to win the}} 1951 Nobel Prize in chemistry for his work in synthesizing actinide elements.|$|E

30|$|The {{interviews}} with the government officials showed a more even distribution of structural and nonstructural <b>suggestions</b> for improvements. Three made both structural and nonstructural <b>suggestions,</b> while one made only structural <b>suggestions</b> and one made only nonstructural <b>suggestions</b> (Table  8). Structural <b>suggestions</b> from government officials included the Nilwala Project, improved drainage and irrigation systems, building houses in safer areas, and renovating flood banks. Nonstructural <b>suggestions</b> included relocating people to safer areas using compensation, dredging the river, improving maintenance policies, and clearer directives on the responsibilities of authorities and educating the local public.|$|R
40|$|Participants (6 - and 7 -year-olds, N = 130) {{participated in}} {{classroom}} activities four times. Children were interviewed about the final occurrence (target event) either 1 week or 4 weeks later, during which {{half of the}} event items were described inaccurately. Half of these <b>suggestions</b> {{were consistent with the}} theme of the detail across the occurrences (e. g., always sat on a kind of floor mat) or were inconsistent (e. g., sat on a chair). When memory for the target event was tested 1 day later, children falsely recognized fewer inconsistent <b>suggestions</b> than consistent <b>suggestions,</b> especially compared with a control group of children who experienced the event just one time. Furthermore, the longer delay reduced accuracy only for consistent <b>suggestions.</b> Source-monitoring ability was strongly and positively related to resistance to <b>suggestions,</b> and encouraging children to identify the source of false <b>suggestions</b> allowed them to retract a significant proportion of their reports of inconsistent <b>suggestions</b> but not of consistent <b>suggestions.</b> The results suggest that the gist consistency of <b>suggestions</b> determines whether event repetition increases or decreases suggestibility. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Several {{controlled}} {{trials have}} demonstrated that hypnosis is an efficacious treatment for chronic pain. However, less {{attention has been given}} to the specific procedures and <b>suggestions</b> used in hypnotic treatments in research. The goal of this review was {{to address the issue of}} differences in the content of hypnotic <b>suggestions,</b> including pain management <b>suggestions,</b> non-pain related <b>suggestions,</b> and posthypnotic <b>suggestions,</b> in the context of published clinical trials of hypnosis for chronic pain management. This review focused on the types of <b>suggestions</b> used in twenty five studies comparing hypnosis to active treatments (e. g., relaxation, biofeedback), non-treatment control groups (e. g., standard care/wait-list control, supportive attention), or both in adult populations with various chronic pain conditions. Overall, these studies found hypnosis to be more effective than non-treatment control groups and similarly effective when compared to active treatments on pain-related outcomes when either pain-related <b>suggestions</b> or non-pain related <b>suggestions</b> were used. However, for studies that included both pain-specific and non-pain related <b>suggestions,</b> hypnosis was found to be superior to active treatments on a variety of pain-related outcomes...|$|R

As Jan storms out of the office, she admonishes Michael before complimenting him and reluctantly stating that she is not ready for a relationship. Meanwhile, the stunned staff listens in.|$|E

40|$|We present SceneSuggest: an {{interactive}} 3 D scene design system providing context-driven <b>suggestions</b> for 3 D model retrieval and placement. Using a point-and-click metaphor we specify regions {{in a scene}} in which to automatically place and orient relevant 3 D models. Candidate models are ranked using a set of static support, position, and orientation priors learned from 3 D scenes. We show that our <b>suggestions</b> enable rapid assembly of indoor scenes. We perform a user study comparing <b>suggestions</b> to manual search and selection, as well as to <b>suggestions</b> with no automatic orientation. We find that <b>suggestions</b> reduce total modeling time by 32 %, that orientation priors reduce time spent re-orienting objects by 27 %, and that context-driven <b>suggestions</b> reduce the number of text queries by 50 %...|$|R

40|$|The study {{investigated}} the differences in pain perception in highly (Highs) and low (Lows) hypnotizable patients with chronic benign pain undergoing hypnotic <b>suggestions</b> of analgesia. Self reports of pain intensity were collected in different groups of fibromyalgic patients: (1) Highs and Lows during pre-hypnosis, neutral hypnosis, <b>suggestions</b> for analgesia, posthypnotic conditions; (2) Lows during <b>suggestions</b> for analgesia administered after a mental stress instead of neutral hypnosis; (3) healthy Lows receiving nociceptive stimulation during hypnotic relaxation and <b>suggestions</b> of analgesia. The results showed that Highs and Lows differed in their response to <b>suggestions,</b> but significant analgesia was reported also by Lows. These individuals did not report any difference in pain perception between the sessions including mental stress and hypnotic relaxation. No change in pain perception was observed in healthy Lows during nociceptive stimulation associated with relaxation and <b>suggestions</b> for analgesia. In conclusion, the presence of chronic pain seems {{to be responsible for}} the paradoxical response of non hypnotizable patients to hypnotic <b>suggestions...</b>|$|R

30|$|Data {{preparation}} for experiments: To evaluate various classification methods, we first randomly sampled a small dataset, then we manually labelled {{the comments that}} are <b>suggestions</b> and, finally, tested various classification methods described in the “Classification techniques for textual data” section. To compare the models, we used text evaluation measures: precision, recall and F-score (Manning et al. 2008). Precision is the fraction of comments that are actually <b>suggestions</b> among the total number comments classified as <b>suggestions.</b> Recall is the fraction of actual <b>suggestions</b> that have been retrieved over a total number of <b>suggestions</b> in all the student comments. F-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.|$|R
