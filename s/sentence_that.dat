5|$|In 2009, a {{security}} system at a scrap metal yard, {{which had been}} repeatedly burglarized, went off. The yard's owner {{was at the time}} on a hunt close to the yard and drove directly to it. A group of burglars jumped into their car and attempted to drive away. The owner used his shotgun and attempted to shoot the car's tires, hitting and wounding two of its occupants. He was sentenced to 6 years imprisonment for intentional infliction of bodily harm, a <b>sentence</b> <b>that</b> was confirmed on appeal. The owner received full presidential pardon.|$|E
5|$|In 1202 the new Bishop of Worcester Mauger {{attempted}} to investigate Norreis's conduct, {{but under the}} leadership of Thomas of Marlborough the monastic community refused to allow the bishop to visit, claiming that Evesham was exempt from episcopal visitation and oversight. According to Thomas, Norreis offered to renounce the abbey's claim to exemption in return for money, but the bishop refused. Norries then fled the monastery, while the monks continued to refuse the bishop and were excommunicated, a <b>sentence</b> <b>that</b> Norreis was spared. Between early September and mid-October the dispute was heard by three ecclesiastical tribunals, Mauger was supported by Eustace, Bishop of Ely, and Giles de Braose, Bishop of Hereford. The monks and Norreis then made common cause, each vowing to stand by the other in resisting Mauger. As well as these two cases, there was a dispute between the monks and the bishop over the ownership of some properties. The monks and Norreis then obtained the right for their case to be heard by papal judge-delegates, but Mauger objected {{to the fact that the}} appointed judges were all Benedictine monks, and travelled to Rome to appeal.|$|E
40|$|By {{classifying}} Japanese sentences {{into eight}} categories, this paper discusses {{the problems of}} Japanese to English translation. By way of illustration, Japanese compositions written by a Japanese first-grader are used. The eight categories into which the sentences are classified are as follows: 1. sentences structured into “there is” or “there are”; 2. <b>sentences</b> <b>that</b> indicate the writer’s observations; 3. <b>sentences</b> <b>that</b> describe the writer’s actions; 4. <b>sentences</b> <b>that</b> express the writer’s feelings; 5. <b>sentences</b> <b>that</b> describe the writer’s state and intentions; 6. <b>sentences</b> <b>that</b> describe events; 7. statements of generalization; and 8; other. The short analyses of each category {{shed light on the}} difficulties of translating Japanese into English and, at the same time, provide us with useful insights which can be used when translating Japanese into English. 研究ノー...|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} morning of 10 April, leading {{elements}} of the Austrian army crossed the Inn River and invaded Bavaria. Bad roads and freezing rain slowed the Austrian advance in the first week, but the opposing Bavarian forces gradually retreated. The Austrian attack occurred about a week before Napoleon's anticipations, and in his absence Berthier's role became all the more critical. Berthier (whose fortè was staff work) {{proved to be an}} insufficient field commander, a characteristic made worse by the fact that several messages from Paris were being delayed and misinterpreted when they finally arrived at headquarters. Whereas Napoleon had written to Berthier that an Austrian attack before 15 April should be met by a general French concentration around Donauwörth and Augsburg, Berthier focused on a <b>sentence</b> <b>that</b> called for Davout to station his III Corps around Regensburg and ordered the Iron Marshal to move back to the city despite massive Austrian pressure.|$|E
5|$|The legal {{elements}} and {{features of the}} major federal public corruption offenses differ. The various jurisdictional elements of the offenses require that the prosecution prove, alternatively: that the payee was a federal official; that the payee organization received $10,000 in federal funds; that the corrupt communications involved {{the use of the}} mail or interstate wires; that the corruption affected interstate commerce or interstate travel. The mens rea elements differ in whether they require a quid pro quo; a mere nexus is an easier element to prove; more difficult elements to prove include the intent to be influenced and inducement. The offenses also differ in whether the act to be procured from the public official must be an official, a violation of an official duty, a fraud on the United States, or an official transaction. The offenses also differ in whether the payor may be prosecuted in addition to the public official. Finally, the offenses differ in whether they are predicates for Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and money laundering prosecutions, and in the maximum authorized prison <b>sentence</b> <b>that</b> may be imposed upon conviction.|$|E

25|$|Likewise, cadences can be {{classified}} as either transient (a pause, like a comma in a linguistic <b>sentence,</b> <b>that</b> implies the piece will continue after a brief lift in the voice) or terminal (more conclusive, like a period, that indicates the sentence is done). Most transient cadences are half cadences (which stop momentarily on a dominant chord), though IAC or deceptive cadences are also usually transient, as well as Phrygian cadences. Terminal cadences are normally perfect, and rarely plagal.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the first}} {{sentence}} in this clause originally concerned apportionment of both House seats and taxes among the several states, the Fourteenth Amendment <b>sentence</b> <b>that</b> replaced it in 1868 mentioned only the apportionment of House seats.
