60|$|He {{pretended to}} hurl a biscuit at her, and <b>she</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> with a shriek of laughter.|$|E
60|$|When Dora {{went up to}} her room, {{after the}} visitor had gone, <b>she</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{and sat down to}} think.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{upon the}} sudden {{illumination}} of Lucy Ellen's face and went up-stairs with the tears rolling down her cheeks.|$|E
60|$|It {{has been}} the great shock of Alice's life, and she sways. But <b>she</b> <b>shuts</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> before {{answering}} him.|$|R
6000|$|She comes forward, {{holds out}} a cup for BUILDER to pour into, takes [...] it and goes out. BUILDER'S glass remains suspended. He drinks the [...] brandy off as <b>she</b> <b>shuts</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R
50|$|Some time later, notably {{healthier}} and fully recovered from his injuries, Dennis calls at Libby's house {{to pick up}} Jake. He {{says that he has}} something to ask her, but is interrupted by Jake, and says he'll talk to her later. However, just after <b>she</b> <b>shuts</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> he knocks again and asks her on a date. She accepts.|$|R
60|$|Involuntarily <b>she</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> and {{advanced}} like a great, dangerous bird. Her voice rose, {{there was a}} touch of hoarseness in it.|$|E
6000|$|... "We don't take transients," [...] she snapped. [...] "Only regular {{boarders}} with first-class references," [...] and <b>she</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> in Jerry's face.|$|E
6000|$|... "Free parding, indeed!" [...] in {{tones of}} indignant contempt, as <b>she</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{with a bang}} and retired in disgust from the scene.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> folding <b>doors</b> {{leading to}} <b>the</b> sitting room, and then <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to <b>the</b> hall.|$|R
60|$|She {{found her}} own way out, with the tears running down her face. Very gently <b>she</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> hall <b>door.</b>|$|R
60|$|In {{less than}} a minute after she had spoken these words, Mother Anastasia entered the room. She stood for a moment amazed, and then <b>she</b> hastily <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Pots! What have I {{to do with}} pots, thou saucy fellow? I {{thought it}} was some one wanting a charm." [...] And <b>she</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'Thank you,' she said, and <b>she</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of her room. The woman {{went away}} mortified. Not a word, not a tear--ha! Gudrun was cold, a cold woman.|$|E
6000|$|When I joined Euphemia in her room, she met me with {{a mysterious}} {{expression}} on her face. <b>She</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> and then said in a very earnest tone: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You don't {{mean to say}} {{you walked}} here!' said Mrs Griffith, as <b>she</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> front <b>door.</b> 'Fancy that, when you could have all the {{carriages}} in Blackstable to drive you about!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'm {{sorry to}} hear it, ma'am,' rejoined Dick when <b>she</b> had <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> 'I hope you may be {{unexpectedly}} detained, ma'am. If you could manage to be run over, ma'am, but not seriously, so much the better.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should say}} my brother has done {{something}} for her in his will," [...] said Mr. Solomon, in a very low undertone, when <b>she</b> had <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> behind her, pointing with his head towards the absent Mary.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Hush! silly boy--goodnight,' said Wilmet, with a quivering voice, then, as <b>she</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> 'Please don't {{go on this}} way, Felix--I wouldn't {{have had}} it happen for any consideration.' ...|$|E
60|$|Norah {{shook hands}} with him, and {{accompanied}} him to the landing. <b>She</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> behind her and stood outside {{for a couple of}} minutes. Philip wondered what they were talking about.|$|E
6000|$|... "I used to ride," [...] she said. She got up gracefully, calmly. Jacob got up. She {{smiled at}} him. As <b>she</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> he put so many shillings on the mantelpiece.|$|E
50|$|The sketch {{starts with}} a milkman (Michael Palin) {{delivering}} milk to a suburban house. <b>The</b> <b>door</b> opens and a seductive woman (Thelma Taylor in the Television version, Carol Cleveland in the film version) steps out and lures the milkman in; the milkman looks around, then enters the house. The woman takes the milkman upstairs, smiling at him and beckoning him with her finger. The milkman cautiously follows her as she unlocks her bedroom <b>door.</b> She opens <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and ushers <b>the</b> milkman inside. As the milkman enters <b>the</b> room, <b>she</b> <b>shuts</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and locks it. The milkman {{looks around the room}} and sees several milkmen, some of whom are very old, including one who is a skeleton.|$|R
60|$|When {{they are}} gone, Brassbound {{sits down at}} the end of the table, with his elbows on it and his head on his fists, gloomily thinking. Then he takes from the breast pocket of his jacket a leather case, from which he {{extracts}} a scrappy packet of dirty letters and newspaper cuttings. These he throws on the table. Next comes a photograph in a cheap frame. He throws it down untenderly beside the papers; then folds his arms, and is looking at it with grim distaste when Lady Cicely enters. His back is towards her; and he does not hear her. Perceiving this, <b>she</b> <b>shuts</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> loudly enough to attract his attention. He starts up.|$|R
6000|$|It was the parlour-maid. Instead of {{entering}} the room, she spoke through <b>the</b> open <b>door.</b> <b>The</b> woman {{was one of}} Miss Minerva's many enemies in the house. [...] "Mrs. Gallilee wishes to see you," [...] <b>she</b> said--and <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> again, <b>the</b> instant the words were out of her mouth.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, Dora, you may come,' said she, running up-stairs {{to her own}} room, where <b>she</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> and set Winifred on {{her feet}} again. 'Well, Winifred, let us see,' said she cheerfully, 'are you much hurt?' ...|$|E
60|$|Ten {{minutes later}} Lady Thompson arrived, and her coming {{was like to}} that of a thunderstorm. <b>She</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> locked it, and sat down in an {{armchair}} in solemn, lurid silence. Then with one swift flash the storm broke.|$|E
60|$|Lady Bellamy {{sat in the}} drawing-room, {{and waited}} for her carriage; at last she heard the wheels upon the gravel. Then she rose, and rapidly did {{something}} to the great lamp upon the paper-strewn table. As <b>she</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> she turned.|$|E
6000|$|... "They have gone," [...] was {{the sharp}} answer, and Mrs. Slater {{looked as if}} <b>she</b> wished to <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> in <b>the</b> faces of the callers.|$|R
50|$|A clerk {{finds her}} the same manner. When he has brought the money, she says <b>she</b> must <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> <b>The</b> clerk says he will, and once he has <b>the</b> <b>door</b> latch, <b>the</b> Master Maid says that he will hold it, and it will hold him, and he will {{go back and forth}} all night. And so he does.|$|R
60|$|No! One of {{the keys}} fitted; one {{of the keys}}, with a little patient management, turned the lock. She looked in eagerly. There were open shelves above, and one long drawer under them. The shelves were devoted to {{specimens}} of curious minerals, neatly labeled and arranged. The drawer was divided into compartments. Two of the compartments contained papers. In the first, she discovered nothing but a collection of receipted bills. In the second, she found a heap of business documents; but the writing, yellow with age, was enough of itself to warn her that the Trust was not there. <b>She</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> of <b>the</b> cabinet, and, after locking them again with some little difficulty, proceeded to try the keys in the bookcase cupboards next, before she continued her investigations in the other rooms.|$|R
60|$|The {{table was}} between them. He {{did not offer}} {{to shake hands with}} her. <b>She</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> quietly. He heard her moving about in the bed-room, and in a little while he heard the {{creaking}} of the bed as she got in.|$|E
6000|$|He went out, and <b>she</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> upon him. He {{looked up}} at the windows of his mother's room, and the dim light, deadened by the yellow blinds, seemed to say a {{response}} after Affery, and to mutter, 'Don't ask me anything. Go away!' ...|$|E
60|$|So Mrs. Gould {{advanced}} {{into the}} drawing-room; Mrs. Evelyn {{came forward to}} assume the duties of hostess; and Sydney turned and ran away so precipitately that <b>she</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> on the trailing skirt of her habit and had to open it again to release herself.|$|E
6000|$|But first <b>she</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> front <b>door.</b> <b>The</b> old {{habit of}} respect for my unaccountable temper still swayed her. [...] "Ah deary!" [...] she said, [...] "ah deary! But you were sorely tried," [...] and kept her face close to my shoulder, lest she should offend me {{by the sight of}} the tears that welled within her.|$|R
60|$|The {{moment she}} got inside the Chapel--it was a big, airy, {{pleasant}} building--she heard hammering from the organ-loft, {{and saw the}} flicker of a candle. Some workman busy before Sunday. <b>She</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> baize <b>door</b> behind her, and hurried across to the vestry, for vases, then out to the tap, for water. All was warm and still.|$|R
60|$|The {{very first}} day <b>she</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> kitchen <b>door</b> in <b>the</b> face of the tom-cats who used to enjoy {{watching}} Lizina at her work, and a young and mischievous cat who jumped in by the open kitchen window and alighted on the table got such a blow with the rolling-pin that he squalled for an hour.|$|R
