He was subsequently no balled for throwing twice in the Sheffield Shield, but his career was ended when Australian umpire Colin Egar no balled him four times in his first over against South Africa in the First Test at Brisbane in 1963-64. Some thought this was arranged for the benefit of sporting relations, but Meckiff never played cricket again.|$|E
2500|$|In 1958 life {{looked good}} for Peter May of Charterhouse, Cambridge, Surrey and England; his county had been County Champions {{for seven years}} running, with May the captain {{for the last two}} seasons, and England had never been {{defeated}} under his leadership. Vice-captain on the triumphant tour of Australia in 1954-55 he had beaten South Africa 3-2 in 1955, considered by many to have been the most exciting Test series since the war, Australia 2-1 in 1956, the West Indies 3-0 in 1957 and New Zealand 4-0 in 1958. He was widely regarded as the best post-war batsman England produced, tall, strong and disciplined with a near-perfect technique, a straight bat and a complete range of strokes. His standards improved with the responsibilities of captaincy and his Test average as captain was [...] His greatest century was against the West Indies in 1957 when England followed on 288 runs behind at , he made 285 not out, the highest score by an England captain until Graham Gooch's , adding 411 with Colin Cowdrey (154) - still an England record for any wicket - and destroyed the mesmerising hold the spinner Sonny Ramadhin had over English batsmen. In the low scoring Ashes series of 1956 he had made 453 runs (90.60) and was out only once for less than 50, when he made 43. Although himself a highly educated amateur and a gentleman he realised that the old class divisions in English cricket were breaking down and under Len Hutton's leadership the amateur and professional had merged. He enjoyed the complete loyalty of the team and the selectors and was ready to help his players and smooth down feathers. As a captain he was a strict team disciplinarian who expected high standards, he was ruthless when the occasion demanded, but could be inflexible and unimaginative and lacked the charisma of a natural leader. In 1958-59 he played too defensively and surrendered the initiative to readily to Benaud as he concentrated on saving runs instead of trying to get batsmen out. Faced with Meckiff's bowling in the disastrous First Test he declined to make an official complaint as it would appear unsporting and <b>sour</b> <b>grapes.</b> A more ruthless captain may have resolved this problem {{at the start of the}} series, even at the loss of Tony Lock, but that would have damaged Anglo-Australian cricketing relations. After the Australian tour May beat New Zealand 1-0, India 5-0 and led England to its first series victory in the West Indies 1-0. He lost 2-1 to the 1961 Ashes series and retired due to ill-health having been captain in a then record 41 Tests, Richie Benaud being the only man to defeat him in a Test series.|$|E

40|$|Background and Objectives: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to monitor the microorganisms isolated from grapes and its derivative traditional products produced in Iran. Material and Methods: Four kinds of grapes cultivated summer of 2010 in vineyard of Takestan and also grape derived products from Shahrod, Hamedan and Takestan were used for this study. The samples were cultured in specific media to isolate the microorganisms that might grow on or pollute the products. Results: Species of bacteria and fungi isolated from 4 kinds of grapes cultivated in Takestan graveyards and also from 2 kinds of derived traditional products; <b>grape</b> sap and <b>sour</b> <b>grape</b> (abe-ghure locally named), were taken from Takestan, Shahrod and Hamedan cities. Also, bacteria Bacillus spp., Micrococcus spp., Clostridium spp., and fungus of Penicillium spp., and Aspergillus spp. were isolated. Conclusion: The isolated bacteria were common microorganisms that grow in soil or in the organic fertilizer and may appear from the environments that samples were collected. These bacteria were not pathogenic to human. The fungus isolated from the grapes may harm humans as they produce toxin. The results suggested that bacterial diversity on grapes and its derived traditional products are expected to be monitored and described in all Iranian graveyards as Iran has been known as one of the world’s biggest grape producers...|$|R

40|$|Doutoramento em Engenharia Alimentar - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaThe {{grape berry}} {{microbiota}} is deeply {{influenced by the}} sanitary status of grapes. In sound grapes the most frequent yeast species were basidiomycetes, Aureobasidium pullulans, Candida zemplinina and Hanseniaspora uvarum. <b>Sour</b> rotten <b>grapes</b> were mostly colonised by C. zemplinina, H. uvarum, Issatchenkia spp. and Zygoascus hellenicus.

The acetic acid bacteria Gluconobacter spp. and Gluconoacetobacter spp. were isolated from healthy and injured grapes, while Acetobacter spp. was only associated with sour rot. Sour rot induced an increase of the sugar content, volatile acidity, colour and total phenols of grape juices.

40|$|Aims: To {{identify}} ascomycetous yeasts {{recovered from}} sound and damaged grapes {{by the presence}} of honeydew or sour rot. Methods and Results: In sound grapes, the mean yeast counts ranged from 3 Æ 20 ± 1 Æ 04 log CFU g) 1 to 5 Æ 87 ± 0 Æ 64 log CFU g) 1. In honeydew grapes, the mean counts ranged from 3 Æ 88 ± 0 Æ 80 log CFU g) 1 to 6 Æ 64 ± 0 Æ 77 log CFU g) 1. In <b>sour</b> rot <b>grapes</b> counts varied between 6 Æ 34 ± 1 Æ 03 and 7 Æ 68 ± 0 Æ 38 log CFU g) 1. Hanseniaspora uvarum was the most frequent species from sound samples. In both types of damage, the most frequent species were Candida vanderwaltii, H. uvarum and Zygoascus hellenicus. The latter species was recovered in high frequency because of the utilization of the selective medium DBDM (Dekkera ⁄ Brettanomyces differential medium). The scarce isolation frequency of the wine spoilage species Zygosaccharomyces bailii (in <b>sour</b> rotten <b>grapes)</b> and Zygosaccharomyces bisporus (in honeydew affected grapes) could only be demonstrated by the use of the selective medium ZDM (Zygosaccharomyces differential medium). Conclusions: The isolation of several species only from damaged grapes indicates that damage constituted the main factor determining yeast diversity. The utilization of selective media is required for eliciting the recovery of potentially wine spoilage species. Significance and Impact of the Study: The impact of damaged grapes in the yeast ecology of grapes has been underestimated...|$|R

40|$|<b>Grape</b> <b>sour</b> (bunch) rot is a polymicrobial {{disease of}} {{vineyards}} that causes {{millions of dollars}} in lost revenue per year due to decreased quality of grapes and resultant wine. The disease is associated with damaged berries infected with a community of acetic acid bacteria, yeasts, and filamentous fungi that results in rotting berries with high amounts of undesirable volatile acidity. Many insect species cause the initial grape berry damage that can lead to this disease, but most studies have focused on the role of fruit flies in facilitating symptoms and vectoring the microorganisms of this disease complex. Like fruit flies, social wasps are abundant in vineyards where they feed on ripe berries and cause significant damage, while also dispersing yeasts involved in wine fermentation. Despite this, their possible role in disease facilitation and dispersal of grape rots has not been explored. We tested the hypothesis that the paper wasp Polistes dominulus could facilitate <b>grape</b> <b>sour</b> rot in the absence of other insect vectors. Using marker gene sequencing we characterized the bacterial and fungal community of wild-caught adults. We used a sterilized foraging arena to determine if these wasps transfer viable microorganisms when foraging. We then tested if wasps harboring their native microbial community, or those inoculated with sour rot, had an effect on <b>grape</b> <b>sour</b> rot incidence and severity using a laboratory foraging arena. We found that all wasps harbor some portion of the sour rot microbial community and that they have the ability to transfer viable microorganisms when foraging. Foraging by inoculated and uninoculated wasps led to an increase in berry rot disease symptom severity and incidence. Our results indicate that paper wasps can facilitate sour rot diseases in the absence of other vectors and that the mechanism of this facilitation may include both increasing host susceptibility and transmitting these microbial communities to the grapes. Social wasps are understudied but relevant players in the sour rot ecology of vineyards...|$|R
