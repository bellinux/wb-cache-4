Baker's husband became a chief wound dresser, and sent for Baker to accompany him as the head of a <b>special</b> <b>diet</b> <b>kitchen</b> for the Officers' Hospital in Stockwell, Indiana in January 1864. She prepared about 500 meals a day. In her letter to Mary G. Holland for Holland's book, Our Army Nurses: Stories from Women in the Civil War, Baker writes of the under-staffing issue that plagued hospitals of the Union and Confederacy during the Civil War.|$|E
50|$|The largest was the Depot Field Hospital which covered nearly 200 acres (800,000 m²) {{and could}} {{hold up to}} 10,000 patients. Twelve hundred tents, {{supplemented}} by ninety log barracks in the winter, comprised the compound, which included laundries, dispensaries, regular and <b>special</b> <b>diet</b> <b>kitchens,</b> dining halls, offices and other structures. Army surgeons administered the hospital aided by civilian {{agencies such as the}} United States Sanitary Commission and the U.S. Christian Commission. Male nurses, drawn from the ranks, made sure each patient had his own bed and wash basin; and regularly received fresh pillows and linens. The excellence of the facilities and the efficiency and dedication of the staff not only made the Depot Field Hospital the largest facility of its kind in America but also the finest.|$|R

40|$|Aim: Information {{about the}} {{prevalence}} of <b>special</b> <b>diets</b> in preschool children is limited. The {{aim of this study}} was to measure {{the prevalence of}} all <b>special</b> <b>diets</b> among preschool children in a Swedish municipality. Methods: This was a population-based cross-sectional survey of all 3276 preschool children aged one to five years in the municipality of Karlskrona, Sweden. The questionnaire assessed the number of children at each preschool, how many were on <b>special</b> <b>diets,</b> their dietary requirements, age, sex, whether they had a medical certificate and whether the <b>special</b> <b>diet</b> had a perceived medical cause. Results: We obtained data for 3221 (98 %) of the children, and 19 % had <b>special</b> <b>diets,</b> including 12 % on nonmedical diets and 6. 3 % on medical diets. The five most common diets were avoiding pork (7. 8 %), a vegetarian diet (4. 8 %), and avoiding cows' milk (3. 5 %), hens' eggs (1. 2 %) and lactose (1. 1 %). Gluten avoidance was more common in girls than boys (0. 8 % versus 0. 2 %, p = 0. 032). Half (47 %) of the children on <b>special</b> medical <b>diets</b> lacked a medical certificate. Conclusion: <b>Special</b> <b>diets</b> were common in preschool children in south-east Sweden, and the causes were mainly nonmedical. Mandatory medical certificates for medically based <b>special</b> <b>diets</b> might reduce unnecessary dietary restrictions...|$|R

40|$|Background and aims: The {{current study}} evaluates {{following}} a <b>special</b> <b>diet</b> with diet quality and comorbidities (hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity) in four racial/ethnic groups di-agnosed with prediabetes or “at risk for diabetes”. Methods and results: This is a cross-sectional {{analysis of data}} from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES), 2007 - 2008 and 2009 - 2010. Sample weights were used to achieve a representative sample. Data were available for N = 2666 adults, aged ≥ 20 years (508 Mexican American, 294, Other Hispanic, 616 Black non-Hispanic, and 1248 White non-Hispanic) who were medically diagnosed with either prediabetes or “at risk for diabetes”. Those reporting following a <b>special</b> <b>diet</b> had greater odds of meeting saturated fat guidelines (< 10 % of calories) but no greater odds of adequate fiber (14 g/ 4184 kJ (1000 Kcal)) as compared to those not following a <b>special</b> <b>diet.</b> There was a significant association of following a diet by number of comorbidities. Regardless of race/ethnicity, reporting following a <b>special</b> <b>diet</b> was more likely for those having more comorbidities; however, number of comorbidities {{was not associated with}} diet quality.
