5|$|Sociology is the {{scientific}} study of society, including patterns of social relationships, social interaction, and culture. It is a social science that uses various methods of empirical investigation and critical analysis to develop a body of knowledge about social order, acceptance, and change. Many sociologists aim to conduct research that may be applied directly to social policy and welfare, while others focus primarily on refining the theoretical understanding of <b>social</b> <b>processes.</b> Subject matter ranges from the micro-sociology level of individual agency and interaction to the macro level of systems and the social structure.|$|E

The analyses indicate the main dimensions of stigmatization as a <b>social</b> <b>process.</b> These are following dimensions: time, spatial or socio-cultural, socio-stratification, gender-consequential, ideological-political, reactive and socio-psychological dimension. ...|$|R
5|$|The {{sociology}} {{of race and}} of ethnic relations is {{the area of the}} discipline that studies the social, political, and economic relations between races and ethnicities at all levels of society. This area encompasses the study of racism, residential segregation, and other complex <b>social</b> <b>processes</b> between different racial and ethnic groups. This research frequently interacts with other areas of sociology such as stratification and social psychology, as well as with postcolonial theory. At the level of political policy, ethnic relations are discussed in terms of either assimilationism or multiculturalism. Anti-racism forms another style of policy, particularly popular in the 1960s and 70s.|$|E

Through these processes, team members are able to access their collective pool of knowledge, reach shared understandings, identify new ways of understanding problems or tasks, and make new connections between ideas. Engaging in these <b>social</b> <b>processes</b> also promotes positive team affect, which facilitates collective creativity.|$|E

25|$|Commencing in {{the late}} nineteenth century and {{impacting}} the twentieth-century, Muhammed Abduh and Rashid Rida undertook a project to defend and modernize Islam to match Western institutions and <b>social</b> <b>processes.</b> Its most prominent intellectual founder, Muhammad Abduh (d. 1323 AH/1905 CE), was Sheikh of Al-Azhar University for a brief period before his death. This project superimposed the world of the nineteenth century on the extensive body of Islamic knowledge that had accumulated in a different milieu. These efforts had little impact at first, however were catalysed with the demise of the Ottoman Caliphate in 1924 and promotion of secular liberalism – particularly with a new breed of writers being pushed to the fore including Egyptian Ali Abd al-Raziq’s publication attacking Islamic politics for the first time in Muslim history. Subsequent secular writers including Farag Foda, al-Ashmawi, Muhamed Khalafallah, Taha Husayn, Husayn Amin, et. al., have argued in similar tones.|$|E

25|$|Behavioural {{research}} generally {{indicates that}} teenagers begin their smoking habits due to peer pressure, and cultural influence portrayed by friends. However, {{one study found}} that direct pressure to smoke cigarettes played a less significant part in adolescent smoking, with adolescents also reporting low levels of both normative and direct pressure to smoke cigarettes. Mere exposure to tobacco retailers may motivate smoking behaviour in adults. A similar study suggested that individuals may play {{a more active role in}} starting to smoke than has previously been thought and that <b>social</b> <b>processes</b> other than peer pressure also need to be taken into account. Another study's results indicated that peer pressure was significantly associated with smoking behavior across all age and gender cohorts, but that intrapersonal factors were significantly more important to the smoking behavior of 12- to 13-year-old girls than same-age boys. Within the 14- to 15-year-old age group, one peer pressure variable emerged as a significantly more important predictor of girls' than boys' smoking. It is debated whether peer pressure or self-selection is a greater cause of adolescent smoking.|$|E
25|$|Other {{authors have}} focused on the {{structural}} conditions leading up to genocide and the psychological and <b>social</b> <b>processes</b> that create an evolution toward genocide. Ervin Staub showed that economic deterioration and political confusion and disorganization were starting points of increasing discrimination and violence in many instances of genocides and mass killing. They lead to scapegoating a group and ideologies that identified that group as an enemy. A history of devaluation of the group that becomes the victim, past violence against the group that becomes the perpetrator leading to psychological wounds, authoritarian cultures and political systems, and the passivity of internal and external witnesses (bystanders) all contribute to the probability that the violence develops into genocide. Intense conflict between groups that is unresolved, becomes intractable and violent can also lead to genocide. The conditions that lead to genocide provide guidance to early prevention, such as humanizing a devalued group, creating ideologies that embrace all groups, and activating bystander responses. There is substantial research to indicate how this can be done, but information is only slowly transformed into action.|$|E

500|$|Institutional {{economics}} is one {{means by which}} feminist economists improve upon the homo economicus model.

500|$|Sociologists' {{approach}} to culture {{can be divided}} into a [...] "sociology of culture" [...] and [...] "cultural sociology"—the terms are similar, though not entirely interchangeable. The sociology of culture is an older term, and considers some topics and objects as more-or-less [...] "cultural" [...] than others. Conversely, cultural sociology sees all social phenomena as inherently cultural. Sociology of culture often attempts to explain certain cultural phenomena as a product of <b>social</b> <b>processes,</b> while cultural sociology sees culture as a potential explanation of social phenomena.|$|E
500|$|According to Murray Bookchin, {{the idea}} that humans must {{dominate}} nature is common in hierarchical societies. Bookchin contends that capitalism and market relationships, if unchecked, {{have the capacity to}} reduce the planet to a mere resource to be exploited. Nature is thus treated as a commodity: [...] "The plundering of the human spirit by the market place is paralleled by the plundering of the earth by capital." [...] Social ecology, founded by Bookchin, is based on the conviction that nearly all of humanity's present ecological problems originate in, indeed are mere symptoms of, dysfunctional social arrangements. Whereas most authors proceed as if our ecological problems can be fixed by implementing recommendations which stem from physical, biological, economic etc., studies, Bookchin's claim is that these problems can only be resolved by understanding the underlying <b>social</b> <b>processes</b> and intervening in those processes by applying the concepts and methods of the social sciences.|$|E

I found that Erikson saw this relationship as the relationship between ego identity and group identity which is constructed and recognized mutually. In these two points, I can evaluate Erikson's identity theory as psycho-social theory. In addition, through examining Erikson's theory on <b>social</b> <b>process,</b> I found the identical relationship between ego <b>process</b> and <b>social</b> <b>process.</b> This means that Erikson's identity theory can revive by means of reconstructing the theory on <b>social</b> <b>process...</b>|$|R
