25|$|Both the Nationals' {{starting}} shortstop, Trea Turner, and {{his primary}} backup, Stephen Drew, {{were placed on}} the 10-day disabled list with strained hamstrings within days of one another. The team recalled Taylor on April 10 and purchased the contract of utility infielder Grant Green on April 12, making Green the third non-roster invitee to the Nationals' spring training in West Palm Beach (after Guthrie, who was removed from the roster after less than 24 hours, and Albers) added to the roster during the month. Turner was activated on April 21 for a game against the division rival New York Mets, and Green was designated for assignment; in his return, as a pinch-hitter, Turner had the game-winning RBI in a 4–3 victory when he took a bases-loaded walk in the 11th inning. On the pitching <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ledger,</b> left-handed reliever Sammy Solis was placed on the disabled list with elbow inflammation on April 19, and the Nationals called up Joe Ross to start against the division rival Atlanta Braves; Washington won that game 14–4 on the back of two grand slams, struck by right fielder Bryce Harper and first baseman Ryan Zimmerman, in a 20-hit effort and Ross earned the win.|$|E

[...] While Arthur was not opposed to internal improvements, the scale of the bill disturbed him, as did its narrow focus on [...] "particular localities," [...] rather than projects that benefited a larger part of the nation. [...] On August1, 1882, Arthur vetoed the bill to widespread popular acclaim; in his veto message, his principal objection was that it appropriated funds for purposes [...] "not for the common defense or general welfare, and which do not promote commerce among the States." [...] Congress overrode his veto the next day and the new law reduced the surplus by $19 million.

UConn was involved in four of them.

However, on this day, Connecticut would be on the opposite <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ledger,</b> scoring only 12 points against Stanford in the first half. The first two minutes gave no indication of this result. UConn held a 5–0 lead just over two minutes into the game, but they would not score again until after the media timeout with under eight minutes to go in the half. Connecticut hit but 5 of their 29 shot attempts in the first half for a shooting percentage of 17% described by the New York Times as [...] "laughable".

40|$|The precautionary {{principle}} (PP) {{has sometimes been}} invoked to justify a ban on GM crops.

40|$|For several years, {{residents}} of Cache County, Utah {{have suffered from}} <b>the</b> recurrence <b>of</b> {{what has come to}} be known as the winter-inversion, or “red-air-day” season. Each year during this season – which occurs primarily in <b>the</b> months <b>of</b> December, January, and February – particulate matter concentrations measuring two and half micrometers or less (commonly known as PM 2. 5) rise and languish (for periods of days or even weeks) above federally mandated standards, causing extensive harm to community health and confounding what have thus far been the relatively tepid control efforts undertaken by local and state policymakers. Through time-series regression modeling, we establish a statistical relationship between PM 2. 5 concentrations and vehicle use in Cache County, and further calculate a gas-price elasticity for the region. Next, we analyze the benefits and costs associated with a potential seasonal gas tax which, if set appropriately and enforced effectively, could decrease vehicle use and thereby lower health costs through concomitant decreases in PM 2. 5 concentrations. Specifically, we find a relatively strong positive relationship between percentage of vehicle trips reduced and associated reductions in PM 2. 5 concentrations, and a gas price elasticity of approximately - 0. 31 in what we call a “high price variability environment. ” Based upon these results, benefit-cost analysis suggests a potentially positive social net benefit for Cache County associated with imposing a seasonal gas tax to reduce PM 2. 5 concentrations during the winter-inversion season. Our benefit-cost analysis, which uses quantitative estimation techniques on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ledger,</b> yields a first-of-its-kind social net benefit estimate for controlling elevated PM 2. 5 concentrations in Cache County through <b>the</b> imposition <b>of</b> a seasonal gas tax...|$|R
2500|$|One {{theory is}} that in its {{original}} Latin, Pacioli's Summa used the Latin words [...] (to owe) and [...] (to entrust) to describe <b>the</b> two <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> a closed accounting transaction. Assets were owed to the owner and the owners' equity was entrusted to the company. At the time negative numbers were not in use. When his work was translated, the Latin words debere and [...] credere became the English debit and credit. Under this theory, the abbreviations Dr (for debit) and Cr (for credit) derive from the original Latin. However, Sherman casts doubt on this idea because Pacioli [...] uses Per (Latin for [...] "from") for the debtor and A (Latin for [...] "to") for the creditor in the Journal entries. Sherman {{goes on to say}} that the earliest text he found that actually uses [...] "Dr." [...] as an abbreviation in this context was an English text, the third edition (1633) of Ralph Handson's book Analysis or Resolution of Merchant Accompts and that Handson uses Dr. as an abbreviation for the English word [...] "debtor."

25|$|One issue {{concerns}} {{the relationship between}} the real economy (producing goods and services) and the financial economy (trading assets). Some argue, like Marx did, that <b>the</b> tendency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rate <b>of</b> profit to fall applies only to <b>the</b> sphere <b>of</b> <b>the</b> capitalist industrial production of commodities, not to the whole capitalist economy. Thus, it is argued, it is eminently possible that while industrial profitability stagnates, average profitability in activities external to <b>the</b> sphere <b>of</b> industrial production increases. In fact, Michael Hudson claims that in the United States, only about a quarter of workers' gross wages is spent on <b>the</b> purchase <b>of</b> actual goods and services. All the rest is spent on <b>the</b> payment <b>of</b> rents and mortgages, retirement schemes and insurance, loans and interest, and various taxes Costas Lapavitsas adds to this insight that not just household liabilities, but also household assets have to be looked at: <b>the</b> rich 20% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world's workers have substantial deposits and savings invested with banks and retirement funds, so that, on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ledger,</b> they become fully dependent on finance capital. Since labor incomes rose strongly in rich countries along with population growth in <b>the</b> second half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20th century, very large savings became available in retirement funds, representing an additional source of capital invested for profit worldwide and increasing <b>the</b> economic power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> finance industry. In 2008, the world's total tradeable financial assets (stocks, debt securities and bank deposits) were estimated at $178 trillion, more than three times <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> what <b>the</b> whole world produces in a year. In June 2017, the world's total public and private debt was estimated at US$217 trillion, again more than three times <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> what <b>the</b> whole world produces in a year.
