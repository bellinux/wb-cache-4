5|$|Pinnipeds spend {{many months}} at a time at sea, so they must <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> the water. Scientists have {{recorded}} them sleeping for minutes at a time while slowly drifting downward in a belly-up orientation. Like other marine mammals, seals <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> water with half of their brain awake so that they can detect and escape from predators. When they are asleep on land, both sides of their brain go into sleep mode.|$|E
5|$|A 2008 {{study found}} that sperm whales <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> {{vertical}} postures just under the surface in passive shallow 'drift-dives', generally during the day, during which whales {{do not respond to}} passing vessels unless they are in contact, leading to the suggestion that whales possibly sleep during such dives.|$|E

5|$|Other {{problems}} may occur along with {{low back pain}}. Chronic low back pain is associated with sleep problems, including a greater amount of time needed to fall asleep, disturbances during sleep, a shorter duration of sleep, and less satisfaction with <b>sleep.</b> <b>In</b> addition, a majority of those with chronic low back pain show symptoms of depression or anxiety.|$|E

5|$|Albatrosses {{combine these}} soaring {{techniques}} {{with the use}} of predictable weather systems: albatrosses in the Southern Hemisphere flying north from their colonies will take a clockwise route, and those flying south will fly counterclockwise. Albatrosses are so well adapted to this lifestyle that their heart rates while flying are close to their basal heart rate when resting. This efficiency is such that the most energetically demanding aspect of a foraging trip is not the distance covered, but the landings, take-offs and hunting they undertake having found a food source. A common assumption is that albatrosses must be able to <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> flight, although no direct evidence has ever been obtained.|$|E
5|$|Birds need {{to alter}} their {{metabolism}} {{to meet the demands}} of migration. The storage of energy through the accumulation of fat and the control of <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> nocturnal migrants require special physiological adaptations. In addition, the feathers of a bird suffer from wear-and-tear and require to be moulted. The timing of this moult – usually once a year but sometimes twice – varies with some species moulting prior to moving to their winter grounds and others molting prior to returning to their breeding grounds. Apart from physiological adaptations, migration sometimes requires behavioural changes such as flying in flocks to reduce the energy used in migration or the risk of predation.|$|E

5|$|Birkin becomes {{accepted}} into the Nonconformist family of Mr Ellerbeck the station master (Jim Carter), with whom he dines on Sundays; the hospitality of the chapel congregation is contrasted against the established church, which has consigned the penniless Birkin to <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> the church belfry. Ellerbeck's children eventually persuade Birkin to preach a sermon at a nearby Methodist chapel. Birkin also forms an emotional, albeit unspoken, attachment to Alice Keach (Natasha Richardson), the young wife of the vicar. The vicar himself (Patrick Malahide) is portrayed unsympathetically as an obstruction to {{the work in the}} church, viewing the medieval painting as symptomatic of the superstition prevalent in the community.|$|E
5|$|College {{students}} {{are at risk}} of engaging in poor sleep hygiene and also of being unaware of the resulting effects of sleep deprivation. Because of irregular weekly schedules and the campus environment, college students may be likely to have variable sleep-wake schedules across the week, take naps, drink caffeine or alcohol near bedtime, and <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> disruptive sleeping environments. Because of this, {{it is important to have}} sleep hygiene education on college campuses.|$|E
5|$|Each Clan has an {{identical}} hierarchical system. From birth, newborn kittens {{are known as}} ‘kits’, {{as evidenced by the}} ‘-kit’ suffix {{at the end of their}} name. Parents of the kits choose the names; often, a name is related to their appearance (‘Graykit’), an element of nature (‘Sandkit’), or in regards to how the parent felt when the kit was born (‘Brokenkit’). Mothers, known as ‘queens’, then look after their kits for their first six months of life. Kits are expected to stay in camp at all times, and <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> a designated and comfortable area known as the ‘nursery’.|$|E

5|$|Individuals with {{breathing}} difficulties due to asthma or allergies may experience additional barriers to quality sleep {{that can be}} addressed by specific variations of sleep hygiene recommendations. Difficulty with breathing can cause disruptions to sleep, reducing the ability to stay asleep and to achieve restful sleep. For individuals with allergies or asthma, additional considerations {{must be given to}} potential triggers in the bedroom environment. Medications that might improve ability to breathe while sleeping may also impair <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> other ways, so there must be careful management of decongestants, asthma controllers, and antihistamines.|$|E
5|$|Myra Hindley {{was born}} in Crumpsall on 23 July 1942 and raised in Gorton, then a working-class area of Manchester. Her parents, Nellie and Bob Hindley (the latter an alcoholic), beat her {{regularly}} as a young child. The small house the family lived in was in such poor condition that Hindley and her parents had to <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> the only available bedroom, she in a single bed next to her parents' double. The family's living conditions deteriorated further when Hindley's sister, Maureen, {{was born in}} August 1946. About {{a year after the}} birth, Hindley, then 5, was sent by her parents to live with her grandmother, whose home was nearby.|$|E
