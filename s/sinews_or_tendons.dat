50|$|A <b>tendon</b> <b>or</b> <b>sinew</b> {{is a tough}} band of fibrous {{connective}} tissue that usually connects muscle to bone and is capable of withstanding tension.|$|R
50|$|The building's {{design is}} {{cited as a}} {{masterpiece}} of Organic Modern architecture. Taillibert based the building on plant and animal forms, aiming to include vertebral structures with <b>sinews</b> <b>or</b> tentacles, while still following the basic plans of Modern architecture.|$|R
25|$|Later, the European {{early modern}} humans had crude {{necklaces}} and bracelets of bone, teeth, berries, and stone hung on pieces of string <b>or</b> animal <b>sinew,</b> <b>or</b> pieces of carved bone used to secure clothing together. In some cases, jewellery had shell or mother-of-pearl pieces.|$|R
5000|$|The rondache or roundel was {{a shield}} carried by late Medieval and Renaissance foot {{soldiers}} (swordsman). [...] It {{was made of}} boards of light wood, <b>sinews</b> <b>or</b> ropes, covered with leather, plates of metal, or stuck full of nails in concentric circles or other figures.|$|R
30|$|The {{goals of}} this study are to {{determine}} the effects of intratendinous PRP injections including, (1) the retention of injectant within the tendon, (2) the distribution of PRP after intratendinous injection, (3) whether intratendinous injection <b>or</b> <b>tendon</b> needle fenestration alters tissue morphology, and (4) whether intratendinous injection <b>or</b> <b>tendon</b> needle fenestration alters tendon mechanical properties.|$|R
25|$|Sonomicrometry {{employs a}} pair of {{piezoelectric}} crystals implanted in a muscle <b>or</b> <b>tendon</b> to continuously measure {{the length of a}} muscle <b>or</b> <b>tendon.</b> This is useful because surface kinematics may be inaccurate due to skin movement. Similarly, if an elastic tendon is in series with the muscle, the muscle length may not be accurately reflected by the joint angle.|$|R
50|$|Torsion siege engine {{pieces were}} {{probably}} invented in Macedonia, {{shortly before the}} times of Alexander III. These were driven by the torsion of a spring made of an appropriate organic material, usually <b>sinew</b> <b>or</b> hair, human or horse. Stone-throwing torsion-powered machines had their first recorded use in 332 BC at the siege of Tyre by Alexander.|$|R
50|$|A strain {{is a type}} {{of acute}} injury that occurs to the muscle <b>or</b> <b>tendon.</b> Similar to sprains, it can vary in severity, from a {{stretching}} of the muscle <b>or</b> <b>tendon</b> to a complete tear of the tendon from the muscle. Some of the most common places that strains occur are in the foot, back of the leg (hamstring), or back.|$|R
50|$|Increased DOMS {{leads to}} more {{tenderness}} in eccentric, rather than pure pain <b>or</b> <b>tendon</b> swelling amongst patients.|$|R
5000|$|Choice of {{anterior}} cruciate ligament augmentation, patellar <b>tendon</b> <b>or</b> hamstring <b>tendon.</b>|$|R
50|$|Leg <b>or</b> <b>tendon</b> soreness - heat or pain may be penalized. Blemishes {{are noted}} at {{check-in}} and {{are generally not}} penalized.|$|R
25|$|Arrowheads may be {{attached}} to the shaft with a cap, a socketed tang, or inserted into a split in the shaft and held by a process called hafting. Points attached with caps are simply slid snugly over the end of the shaft, or may be held on with hot glue. Split-shaft construction involves splitting the arrow shaft lengthwise, inserting the arrowhead, and securing it using a ferrule, <b>sinew,</b> <b>or</b> wire.|$|R
5000|$|... • Second degree - torn muscle <b>or</b> <b>tendon</b> tissues; painful, limited motion; {{possibly}} some swelling {{or depression}} {{at the spot}} of the injury.|$|R
5000|$|Interpositional arthroplasty, {{previously}} {{a popular}} form of arthroplasty, with interposition {{of some other}} tissue like skin, muscle <b>or</b> <b>tendon</b> to keep inflammatory surfaces apart ...|$|R
5000|$|An Ojibwe legend recounted by American ethnographer Frances Densmore {{says the}} dreamcatcher {{originates}} with Spider Woman, known as Asibikaashi; she {{took care of}} the children and the people on the land. As the Ojibwe Nation spread to the corners of North America it became difficult for Asibikaashi to reach all the children. So the mothers and grandmothers would weave magical webs for the children, using willow hoops and <b>sinew,</b> <b>or</b> cordage made from plants: ...|$|R
60|$|Emp. Age {{has not yet}} So shrunk my <b>sinews,</b> <b>or</b> so chilled my veins, But {{conscious}} {{virtue in}} my breast remains: But had I now That strength, with which my boiling youth was fraught, When in the vale of Balasor I fought, And from Bengal their captive monarch brought; When elephant 'gainst elephant did rear His trunk, and castles jostled in the air; My sword thy way to victory had shown, And owed the conquest to itself alone.|$|R
25|$|Subcutaneous nodules: Painless, firm {{collections}} of collagen fibers over bones <b>or</b> <b>tendons.</b> They commonly {{appear on the}} back of the wrist, the outside elbow, and the front of the knees.|$|R
50|$|Footballer's Ankle is a {{pinching}} or impingement of the ligaments <b>or</b> <b>tendons</b> of {{the ankle}} between the bones, particularly the talus and tibia. This results in pain, inflammation and swelling.|$|R
5000|$|Subcutaneous nodules: Painless, firm {{collections}} of collagen fibers over bones <b>or</b> <b>tendons.</b> They commonly {{appear on the}} back of the wrist, the outside elbow, and the front of the knees.|$|R
5000|$|... a lower, the {{ligament}} <b>or</b> <b>tendon</b> of Zinn, {{which gives}} origin to the Rectus inferior, {{part of the}} Rectus internus, and the lower head of origin of the Rectus lateralis.|$|R
2500|$|... "Noroxin (norfloxacin) is {{contraindicated}} {{in persons}} {{with a history}} of hypersensitivity, tendinitis, <b>or</b> <b>tendon</b> rupture {{associated with the use of}} norfloxacin or any member of the quinolone group of antimicrobial agents." ...|$|R
30|$|Even with MR imaging, {{identification}} of a communicating stalk with the joint <b>or</b> <b>tendon</b> sheath may be difficult. In these cases, CT arthrography with delayed imaging may be performed to ultimately demonstrate communication [7].|$|R
30|$|The role of imaging is {{to define}} the cystic nature and exact {{location}} of the lesion, and to demonstrate possible communication with a joint <b>or</b> <b>tendon</b> sheath, which is relevant for optimal treatment planning.|$|R
50|$|Stretching {{is a form}} of {{physical}} exercise in which a specific muscle <b>or</b> <b>tendon</b> (<b>or</b> muscle group) is deliberately flexed or stretched in order to improve the muscle's felt elasticity and achieve comfortable muscle tone. The result is a feeling of increased muscle control, flexibility, and range of motion. Stretching is also used therapeutically to alleviate cramps.|$|R
5000|$|Prolotherapy {{involves}} the injection of an irritant solution into a joint space, weakened ligament, <b>or</b> <b>tendon</b> insertion to relieve pain. [...] Most commonly, hyperosmolar dextrose (a sugar) {{is the solution}} used; glycerine, lidocaine (a commonly used local anesthetic), phenol, and sodium morrhuate (a derivative of cod liver oil extract) are other commonly used agents. The injection is administered at joints <b>or</b> at <b>tendons</b> where they connect to bone.|$|R
30|$|A {{fracture}} {{was defined}} as a disruption of {{at least one of the}} cortices of the wrist or an osseous avulsion at the site of attachment of a ligament <b>or</b> <b>tendon.</b> Bilateral fractures were recorded as two fractures.|$|R
50|$|Especially for {{affected}} fingers, hands, and wrists, synovectomy may {{be needed}} to prevent pain <b>or</b> <b>tendon</b> rupture when drug treatment has failed. Severely affected joints may require joint replacement surgery, such as knee replacement. Postoperatively, physiotherapy is always necessary.|$|R
60|$|The leg {{which had}} been held within the jaws of the {{crocodile}} was badly lacerated, but the bone had not been broken, nor were the muscles <b>or</b> <b>tendons</b> sufficiently injured to render it useless. It gave him excruciating pain, that was all.|$|R
30|$|Searching for {{uncommon}} anatomical changes, such as {{the presence}} of abnormal muscles <b>or</b> <b>tendons</b> (Natsis et al. 2010; Besana-Ciani & Greenall 2005) or duplication of the axillary vein (Kutiyanawala et al. 1998) {{was not part of the}} objectives of the present study.|$|R
25|$|In {{pre-tensioned}} concrete, the prestressing {{is achieved}} by using steel <b>or</b> polymer <b>tendons</b> <b>or</b> bars that are subjected to a tensile force prior to casting, or for post-tensioned concrete, after casting.|$|R
5000|$|... "Fen jin" [...] or [...] "zhua jin" [...] (dividing the muscle/tendon, {{grabbing}} the muscle/tendon). Fen means [...] "to divide", zhua is [...] "to grab" [...] and jin means [...] "tendon, muscle, sinew". They refer to techniques which tear apart an opponent's muscles <b>or</b> <b>tendons.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Post-tensioning with {{high-strength}} bonded <b>or</b> unbonded <b>tendons</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|Marian and Duncan have a {{surprise}} {{meeting in a}} laundromat, engage in awkward conversation, and kiss. Shortly afterwards, Marian's problems with food begin when she finds herself empathizing with a steak that Peter is eating, imagining it [...] "knocked on the head as it stood in a queue like someone waiting for a streetcar." [...] After this, she is unable to eat meat - anything with [...] "bone <b>or</b> <b>tendon</b> <b>or</b> fiber".|$|R
5000|$|A Cargile {{membrane}} is {{a sterile}} membrane {{made from the}} peritoneum of the ox. It is used in abdominal surgery to interpose between raw surfaces and thus prevent the formation of adhesions. [...] It was also used to envelop freshly sutured nerves <b>or</b> <b>tendons,</b> and to protect wounds.|$|R
25|$|Contemporary sea kayaks {{trace their}} origin {{to the native}} boats of Alaska, {{northern}} Canada, and Southwest Greenland. Eskimo hunters developed a fast seagoing craft to hunt seals and walrus. The ancient Aleut name for a sea kayak is Iqyak, and earliest models were constructed from a light wooden frame (tied together with <b>sinew</b> <b>or</b> baleen) and covered with sea mammal (sea lion or seal) hides. Archaeologists have found evidence indicating that kayaks are at least 4000 years old. Wooden kayaks and fabric kayaks on wooden frames (such as the Klepper) dominated the market up until the 1950s, when fiberglass boats were introduced. Rotomolded plastic kayaks first appeared in 1984.|$|R
60|$|I {{must say}} that I {{was fascinated by the}} perfect lines of Wolf Larsen’s figure, and by what I may term the terrible beauty of it. I had noted the men in the forecastle. Powerfully muscled though some of them were, there had been {{something}} wrong with all of them, an insufficient development here, an undue development there, a twist or a crook that destroyed symmetry, legs too short or too long, <b>or</b> too much <b>sinew</b> <b>or</b> bone exposed, or too little. Oofty-Oofty had been the only one whose lines were at all pleasing, while, in so far as they pleased, that far had they been what I should call feminine.|$|R
