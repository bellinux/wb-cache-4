5|$|The Wrongs of Woman usually uses third-person narration, {{although}} large {{sections of}} Maria's and Jemima's tales are in first-person narrative. The narrator often relates Maria's feelings to the reader through the new technique of free indirect discourse, which blurs {{the line between the}} third-person narrator and the first-person dialogue of a text. Wollstonecraft juxtaposes the events of the novel with both Maria's own retelling of them and her innermost feelings. The first-person stories allow Maria and Jemima to address each other as equals: their stories of suffering, while still allowing each character to retain an individualized <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>self,</b> are a levelling and bonding force between the two.|$|E
5|$|The Indian Princess is {{one example}} of an attempt by an artist of the early 19th Century to define an American {{national}} identity. Pocahontas, representing the spirit of America, literally shields Smith from injury and serves as foster mother, protecting colonists from famine and attack, achieving mythic status as a heroic mother, and preserving, nurturing and legitimizing America as a country. The play allows for an acknowledgement of the troubling aspects of the nation’s history of conquest, violence, and greed, by couching the negative implications in a romantic plot. In other words, the romantic conquest helps to soften the harshness and brutality of the colonial conquest. The success of the play reflects a larger cultural desire to express its <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>self</b> through the Pocahontas myth.|$|E

5|$|A {{terrorist}} group manages to abduct Nao and Kumagami, one of Shunsuke's closest friends and aides, and holds them hostage {{in exchange for}} Yuu, who attempts to rescue them. However, the operation does not go as planned, which results in Kumagami's death and Yuu being gravely injured. After Yuu recovers, he resolves to protect all of the ability users around the world by stealing their abilities per Nao's suggestion. As Yuu travels the world stealing abilities, the more powers he takes on soon takes its toll on him as he starts losing his memories and <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>self.</b> However, he still manages to steal everyone's abilities throughout the world before collapsing. Shunsuke rescues Yuu, bringing him back to Japan among friends and family. Yuu is left with no past memories, but Nao tells him she is his girlfriend.

5|$|The Doctor {{explains}} that crossing the Void causes a traveller to become saturated in Void material. If {{he opens the}} breach and reverses it, anything saturated in Void material will be pulled in. Everyone except Jackie has crossed the breach and is thus vulnerable to being trapped in the Void, so the Doctor sends them all to the parallel universe. Rose decides she would rather be with the Doctor than her family and jumps back to help him. The Cybermen attempt to stop the Doctor but are repelled by a converted Ms. Hartman, who has resisted the effects of her conversion and at least partially retains her <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>self.</b> The Doctor and Rose open the breach and hang on to magnetic clamps as the Cybermen and Daleks are pulled in. The Cult of Skaro use an emergency temporal shift to escape. Rose's lever slips, and in resetting it she loses her grip and plunges toward the Void. At the last second, Pete reappears and grabs her, and together they transport back to the parallel universe. The breach closes, leaving a devastated Rose trapped in the parallel universe. The devices used to travel between the two worlds have also stopped working. The Doctor presses his ear against the wall, as a tearful Rose does {{the same in the}} other universe, as if trying to listen for each other.|$|E

40|$|Living with Fragility, {{traces the}} lives of sixteen African {{children}} between 1992 and 1995. It explores the intimate spaces of children's social relationships and charts discontinuities they experienced. The eight girls and eight boys, aged between and sixteen years, resided in New Crossroads, Cape Town, a suburb marked by poverty, inadequate schooling, {{and a history of}} violent intervention by the apartheid state and other power holders. The thesis shows that institutions of childhood are fragile, that children's social relationships are fragmented, as are their <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>self.</b> Fragility is traced within and the social domains the children inhabited and created. The thesis argues that children's <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>self</b> are subject to flux and interruption. Narrative ethnographies about the children demonstrate their individuality. Nuanced descriptions of children and the changes in their lives over time challenge bald categorisations of, for example, the African child, or, youth at risk. The descriptions demonstrate the agency, dexterity and responsibilities of children in fluid circumstances and lead to a critical appraisal of predominant notions of childhood. The work also outlines processes of social and relational reconstitution to which children and care-givers had recourse. Methods used in gathering data included a series of formal interviews conducted in Xhosa (the children's first language) in which economic descriptions of households, life histories, social networks, and ritual and religious affiliations of children and care-givers were sought. The formal interviews complemented by repeated visits to each child's home to record changes time. The sixteen children were brought together in workshops where discussion directed towards themes to do with mobility between care-givers, violence, sexuality and <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>self</b> the data were enriched by use of dramatic improvisations and drawings.
