40|$|The current global {{economic}} crisis {{has led to}} greater prominence for the issue of strengthening <b>social</b> <b>protection</b> <b>systems</b> in Asia. This paper analyzes the key factors determining and the possible avenues for strengthening <b>social</b> <b>protection</b> <b>systems</b> in Asia. The choice of an appropriate combination of avenues depends on the initial starting point, public policy objectives, institutional, fiscal, and other capabilities. Following introductory remarks, Section 2 discusses demographic and labor market trends in Asia. It stresses that rapid ageing and large, informal labor markets pose challenges for Asian <b>social</b> <b>protection</b> <b>systems,</b> while making {{the role of the}} state even more essential. This is followed in Section 3 by an overview of social security systems in Asia. The key point is that while there are fairly elaborate social security programs in Asia, primarily for formal sector employees, this does not necessarily imply that the schemes are well designed, have wide coverage, or are financially sustainable. Section 4 discusses four general avenues to strengthening <b>social</b> <b>protection</b> <b>systems.</b> These emphasize greater professionalism, parametric and systemic reforms, social assistance, and social pensions, as well as others such as microfinance institution-initiated pensions. The final section provides concluding observations. The {{global economic}} crisis provides a potential opportunity for strengthening <b>social</b> <b>protection</b> <b>systems.</b> However, the construction of multitiered <b>social</b> <b>protection</b> <b>systems</b> will require much greater professionalism, experimentation, political and organizational leadership, and vision. asia <b>social</b> <b>protection</b> systems; strengthening <b>social</b> systems; social development; global economic crisis; <b>social</b> <b>protection</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

50|$|The French <b>social</b> <b>protection</b> <b>system</b> is {{gradually}} becoming universal, covering all individuals. At its origins (end {{of the nineteenth}} century), social protection has been built as a system of social insurance. Insurance was tied to the exercise of an occupation and the benefits were provided in case {{of the risk of}} loss of income due to the forced inactivity (accident, sickness, unemployment, old age). It only covered workers and their families. The right to social benefits depended on the payment of social security contributions, itself related to earnings. Non-employees, or individuals who have not contributed during their occupation, were entitled to welfare, reserved for cases of extreme distress.|$|E

Following {{the fall of}} {{communism}} in 1990 and transition of People's Republic of Poland into the present day Third Polish Republic, according to Rutkowski (1998), the welfare spending in Poland has risen. Contrary to popular expectations equating transformation from a communist to a capitalist system with reduction of the welfare state, the democratic political system led to the growth of the welfare state due to large public expectations that the state should meet social needs. Rutkowski (1998) also noted that Polish <b>social</b> <b>protection</b> <b>system</b> is [...] "extremely generous" [...] in comparison with most other OECD countries.|$|E
5000|$|France, like {{a number}} of countries, was {{affected}} by the 2008 financial crisis. However, during {{the worst part of}} the crisis, between 2008-2010, France fared better than other industrialized countries. For example, the Euro zoneâ€™s overall GDP decreased by 4 percent, while Franceâ€™s GDP only decreased by 2.2 percent. This resilience is linked to Franceâ€™s <b>social</b> <b>protection</b> <b>system,</b> which, through the transfers it organizes (47 percent of gross disposable household income in 2007) equips France with strong economic stabilizers. However, these stabilizers weigh inversely on recovery. Starting in 2012, many countries experienced economic recoveries, where the analysis of the indicators of economic activity in France do not show a clear recovery, or rather do not show an increased growth during this time.|$|E

40|$|This article aims {{to present}} some {{reflections}} on <b>social</b> <b>protection</b> <b>systems</b> in Latin America. For this, we started from a theoretical {{reflection on the}} action of the state and argue that this intervention in social relations is an outcome of the systemic relationship {{between the state and the}} economy. In a second part, the article develops the hypothesis about the structuralâ€™s determinations of stateâ€™s intervention and the need, for the social policy analysis to considerer the role of the state in the capitalist society. After that, argues about limitations presented by social policy systems and develops the idea that there is a mismatch between the risk structure and architecture of <b>social</b> <b>protection</b> <b>systems.</b> To do this, describes the main features of <b>social</b> <b>protection</b> <b>systems</b> and the changes that they suffered during the process of reforms and economical adjustment. Then, starting on the definition of social risk describes the new risk structure and proposes the existence of a mismatch between <b>social</b> <b>protection</b> and the structure of emerging risks.

It shows that these systems expanded broadly but unevenly across the region during the decade from 2003 to 2013. In particular, there are still large inequalities in access to <b>social</b> <b>protection</b> by type of employment and household income. Contributory coverage is low, and while the coverage of non-contributory assistance has increased, benefits are generally small.
