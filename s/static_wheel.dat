However, there is increasing interest in the use of smaller diameter wheels on freight vehicles, in order to prolong wheelset life (smaller scrap diameter) and increase capacity within the GB’s constrained structure gauge. GB Railway Group Standards [1] limit Q/D to 0. 13 kN/mm.

The goal {{of this research is}} to investigate possible changes in insulated rail joint design in order to improve the performance of the insulated joint. The finite element program ABAQUS is used to model the supported butt joint. In this model, the rail, joint bars, epoxy, and ties surrounding the joint are modeled using solid elements. The remaining ties are modeled as an elastic foundation. The rail is subjected to a tensile load, as well as a vertical wheel load that is applied to the rail using Hertz contact theory. Parametric studies are performed by varying the tie width, joint bar length, and joint bar dimensions. Two different wheel load locations are also investigated: centered about the end post, and halfway between the tie under the end post and the tie just {{to the left of the}} end post. The vertical displacement of the rail and insulated joint is one measure used to determine the effect of the parameters on the insulated joint.

40|$|Abstract — The present thesis {{summarizes}} {{the application of}} Finite Element Analysis technique for analysing stress distribution and fatigue life of Aluminium alloy wheels subject to radial loads. Alloy wheels intended for use on passenger cars stipulate two types of fatigue tests, the Dynamic cornering fatigue test and the Dynamic radial fatigue test. As wheels undergo inconsistent, varying loads during their service life, fatigue behaviour is a key consideration {{in the design and}} performance evaluation. But, alloy wheels have more complex shapes than regular steel wheels, so it is difficult to assess fatigue life by analytical methods. Hence, Finite Element Analysis has been used to evaluate the performance of wheels over their life. The deflection for Alloy wheel Al 2024 -T 351 of this project is found to be around 0. 164 mm which is much less than that of Aluminium A 356. 2 alloy wheel which is 0. 2833 mm.

Dedicated strategies must exist in the brain to prevent these oscillations from disrupting normal processing. Could suitable stimuli fool these strategies and lead to the conscious experience of our own brain oscillations? We describe and explore a novel illusion in which the center of a <b>static</b> <b>wheel</b> stimulus (with 30 - 40 spokes) is experienced as flickering when viewed in the visual periphery. The key feature of this illusion is that the stimulus fluctuations are experienced as a regular and consistent flicker, which our human observers estimated at ∼ 9 Hz during a psychophysical matching task. Correspondingly, the occipital α rhythm of the EEG was the only oscillation that showed a time course compatible with the reported illusion: when α amplitude was strong, the probability of reporting illusory flicker increased. The peak oscillatory frequency for these flicker-induced modulations was significantly correlated, on a subject-by-subject basis, with the individual α frequency measured during rest, in the absence of visual stimulation. Finally, although the effect is strongest during eye movements, we showed that stimulus motion relative to the retina is not necessary to perceive the illusion: the flicker can also be perceived on the afterimage of the wheel, yet by definition this afterimage is stationary on the retina. We conclude that this new flickering illusion is a unique way to experience the α rhythms that constantly occur in the brain but normally remain unnoticed...|$|E
40|$|Roughness {{is found}} by {{analysing}} the longitudinal {{profile of a}} road and is {{a summary of the}} characteristics of the road surface that impact on the ride of a passenger in a car. Since heavy vehicles respond differently to different wavelength bands of roughness, IRI may not be applicable for trucks. A system of analysis is proposed using power spectral density (PSD) of the profile. This provides a measure of the level of development of roughness contained in various wavebands in the pavement. Certain wavebands have been tentatively identified as contributing to the resonance of airbag and steel suspensions. PSD analysis is used to identify the level of wavebands and thus indicate whether road users may determine if the road is rough. A particular section of a Highway in the state of Victoria, Australia, was identified as rough by objective measurement and subjective opinion. The wavebands that affect the performance of heavy vehicles were identified and recognised in the section of the highway chosen for analysis. A simulation of the passage of an articulated heavy vehicle showed that the dynamic wheel load exceeded the <b>static</b> <b>wheel</b> load by a factor of up to two. A link is established between the roughness of a section of pavement, the perception of the section as being rough, and the dynamic wheel loads induced in the pavement by interaction of the suspension system with the surface profile.

40|$|The impact an {{aircraft}} has on its tires when it lands has been problematic practically since {{the invention of}} the airplane. Upon touchdown, the tires frequently smoke as rubber burns off and tire material is worn away while the tires slip up to a steady rolling speed. To minimise tire slip, torque or spin mechanisms could be added to each tire assembly to accelerate the tire to match the landing speed. Patents have been registered since the 1940 s to improve tire safety and performance, decrease the substantial wear that results from every landing, and save airline companies the cost of regularly replacing expensive worn tires and to clean tarmacs. In this paper, a case study is presented of a Boeing 747 - 400 aircraft touching down on a runway and its wheels spinning up to match the forward speed of the aircraft as it rolls along the runway. A LuGre friction model is employed to simulate the dynamic behaviour of the tires during a typical landing, and Archard wear theory is used to compare tire wearing between initially <b>static</b> and pre-spun <b>wheels.</b> We conclude that the amount of rubber worn from the tire on each landing is proportional to the kinetic energy that the wheel must gain to reach a free-rolling velocity.

40|$|Thiswork {{presents}} an experimentalmethod for visualizing and analyzingmachine-soil interactions, namely the soil optical flow technique (SOFT). SOFT uses optical flow and clustering techniques to process images of soil interacting with a wheel or tool from photos taken {{through a glass}} wall of a soil bin. It produces results that are far richer than past approaches that utilized long-exposure photography. It achieves a performance comparable to particle image velocimetry or particle tracking velocimetry, butwithout the need for specializedmeasurement equipment or specially marked soil particles. The processing technique demonstrates robustness to different soil types. Ground-truth and cross-validation experiments exhibit subpixel accuracy in estimating soil motions. An example of an application of this technique for field robotics research is the detailed study of push-rolling for slope climbing and soft soil traverse. Push-rolling advances a vehicle by rolling a subset of its wheels while changing its wheelbase to keep the other <b>wheels</b> <b>static</b> and pushing against the ground. Experiments show that push-rolling achieves higher net traction than conventional rolling. Observing the two aspects of push-rolling (rolling and horizontal pushing) using SOFT shows that they result in entirely different forms of soil shearing (“grip failure ” and “ground failure, ” respectively). SOFT also demonstrates how the direction of soil motion is more efficiently utilized for horizontal thrust by pushing than conventional rolling.

Two devices, a large scale and small scale device, encompassed by the European Standard and the former British Standard were used. Rutting evaluation at the same temperature on two different materials for pavement surface layers was tested under the same conditions allowing the evaluation of the rutting rate to be determined which was found to be very close from one test to another but sensitive to mixture type. In addition to rutting results, the contact dimensions and pressures from the two devices are evaluated in both the static case and during motion using a fiat force transducer on the surface of the slab. The stresses induced in the slabs were calculated using finite element simulations and the measured contact conditions. For different pressure distributions under the wheel the isotropie and deviatoric stresses at the centre of the slab were compared which showed the importance of a good understanding of the wheel slab contact conditions.

40|$|Conventional {{construction}} of Jointed Plain Concrete Pavements (JPCP) in Canada consists of placing a round steel epoxy-coated dowel at the mid {{height of the}} pavement. Steel dowels reduce stepping at the joint to improve comfort and reduce the stress concentration on the support layer beneath the pavement. Most importantly they transfer load and are {{commonly referred to as}} load transfer devices. Problems with dowel bar deterioration, including corrosion causes the slab joint to lock and cause stress concentrations as the slab expands and or contracts and curls due to thermal and shrinkage straining occurring in the concrete. In this research, alternative joint load transfer devices are presented and compared to conventional steel dowels. Four device alternatives are developed and evaluated: a Glass Fibre Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) I-beam placed directly on the base material; GFRP tapered plates; a continuous horizontal V device; and a continuous horizontal pipe device both placed directly on the support layer. The two devices that are continuous run the length of the joint similar to a shear key. The GFRP tapered plate and I-beam, as well as conventional steel dowels, were analyzed in a wheel path sized three dimensional finite element model for wheel loading and static loading applied to either side of the joint. An experimental testing program was developed to test joint load transfer capabilities of each device when subjected to a <b>static</b> <b>wheel</b> load applied to either side of the joint. The GFRP tapered plates and I-beams were shown to transfer load based on the results from the wheel path finite element model and experimental testing program. The differential joint deflection, stress concentrations and plastic straining occurring in the concrete is not reduced with either the tapered plate or I-beam compared to a dowel under wheel loading. In addition, a similar plastic straining area identified in the finite element models were noticed as an area of damage in the experimental testing program. All of the devices developed are analyzed in a quarter slab three dimensional finite element model with shrinkage and thermal strains as well as wheel loading applied to the slab to simulate service loading. A detailed investigation into the stress distribution around the devices and the differential deflection at the joint through the service loading applied is presented in this paper. Similarly to the wheel path investigation the stress concentration in the tapered plate and I-beams are greater than conventional dowels and also have greater differential deflection occurring at the joint. Both the continuous Horizontal V and Horizontal Pipe device reduce stress and plastic straining in the concrete during the service load analysis compared to dowels. During daytime wheel loading the differential deflection in the joint is the lowest with no noticeable stepping occurring at the joint with the Horizontal V device; however is greater than conventional steel dowels under nighttime wheel load application. The differential deflection with the Horizontal Pipe during day and night straining and wheel loading is similar to conventional steel dowels...|$|E
40|$|In aircraft, {{the main}} landing gear wheels skid on the runway {{at the moment of}} {{touchdown}} because of high slip. A slipping tyre generates enough heat to melt its rubber. Melted rubber is easily eroded by the friction force between the tyre and runway; and part of eroded rubber stays on the runway, and other is burnt off as smoke. Since the early days of airplane use, a number of ideas have been patented to improve tyre safety and decrease the substantial wear and smoke during every landing by spinning the gear wheels before touchdown. In this thesis, there are three parts of research work. First part is to find the effectiveness of the technique of pre-spinning the wheel to reduce the tyre tread heat and wear, and then choosing the initial wheel rotation speed that prevent the tread rubber from melting temperature. For achieving this, a coupled structural – thermal transient analysis in ANSYS has been used to model a single wheel {{main landing gear}} as a mass-spring system. This model has been chosen to analyze the wheel’s dynamic behaviour and tyre tread temperature and wear during the short period from static to a matching free-rolling velocity in which the wheel is forced to accelerate by the friction between the tyre and ground. The tyre contact surface temperature and wear have been calculated for both the initially <b>static</b> and pre-spun <b>wheels</b> in order to compare the temperature and wear levels for different initial rotation speeds.

An evaluation system was to be developed for the long-term data, and this was to be programmed {{in the form of a}} database. Furthermore, correlations between axle load distributions and the vehicle mix, depending on the traffic characteristics of a section, were to be investigated. During the test operation the accuracy of the dynamic axle load equipment was to be checked with the aid of <b>static</b> weighing equipment (<b>wheel</b> load measuring equipment), and the experience gained during the practical operation of the equipment systems was to be documented. The documentation of all breakdowns and malfunctions showed limited breakdown times of a total of one to three weeks for each of the five measuring points during a stipulated eight-month analysis period. In the initial phase there were a few breakdowns and malfunctions in the equipment due to hardware and software errors, which were immediately remedied through exchanging the respective defect electronic components and improving the software - in particular to adapt it to the TLS requirements. With regard to the accuracy of the axle load measurements compared to the static measuring results, relatively limited deviations were determined, and the long-term stability of the calibration setting was proved over a period of six months. After initial difficulties, the equipment system with bending plates which was used for these measurements was hence able to prove its suitability, above all with regard to the further expansion of the network.

By measuring the proportion of the wave reflected it is possible to deduce the extent of the contact area and also estimate the pressure distribution. In previous work [1] <b>static</b> specimens of <b>wheel</b> and rail were measured by scanning a transducer to build up a 2 D map of the contact. Whilst this produced good results and agreed well with contact modeling, it is a time consuming process (typically takes 30 minutes for a scan) and could in no way be used for the measurement on-line. In this paper we describe a method that potentially could be used at line speeds and so provide wheel rail contact measurements in field trials. The 2 D scan is achieved by using an array transducer that performs a simultaneous line scan. This coupled with the speed of travel of the contact patch over the sensor location can achieve a map of the contact. Specimens were cut from wheel and rail sections and loaded together hydraulically in a biaxial frame. An array transducer was mounted beneath the rail specimen. The array transducer consisted of 64 ultrasonic elements that may be pulsed independently, simultaneously, or with controlled phase difference. In this work all transducers were pulsed simultaneously at repetition rates of 20 kHz. The signals were reflected back from the contact to effectively produce a line scan. The transducer was physically moved, to simulate the translation of the contact patch and so generate a series of reflection profiles. Contacts under a range of normal and lateral loads have been measured and compared with some simple results using pre-inked paper. The paper concludes with a discussion of how this array measurement procedure might be implemented at full line sped and what accuracy could potentially be achieved...|$|R
40|$|The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) builds {{upon the}} {{successful}} flight {{experience of the}} Chandra Xray Telescope by incorporating an additional LOS pointing servo to meet the more stringent pointing requirements. The LOS pointing servo, referred to in JWST as the Fine Guidance Control System (FGCS), will utilize a Fine Guidance Sensor (FGS) as the sensor, and a Fine Steering Mirror (FSM) as the actuator. The FSM {{is a part of}} the Optical Telescope Element (OTE) and is in the optical path between the tertiary mirror and the instrument focal plane, while the FGS is part of the Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM). The basic Chandra spacecraft bus attitude control and determination architecture, utilizing gyros, star trackers/aspect camera, and reaction wheels, is retained for JWST. This system has achieved pointing stability of better than 0. 5 arcseconds. To reach the JWST requirements of milli-arcsecond pointing stability with this ACS hardware, the local FGCS loop is added to the optical path. The FGCS bandwidth is about 2. 0 Hz and will therefore attenuate much of the spacecraft ACS induced low frequency jitter. In order to attenuate the higher frequency (greatet than 2. 0 Hz) disturbances associated with reaction <b>wheel</b> <b>static</b> and dynamic imbalances, as well as bearing run-out, JWST will employ a two-stage passive vibration isolation system consisting of (1) 7. 0 Hz reaction wheel isolators between each reaction wheel and the spacecraft bus, and (2) a 1. 0 Hz tower isolator between the spacecraft bus and the Optical Telescope Element (OTE). In order to sense and measure the LOS, the FGS behaves much like an autonomous star tracker that has a very small field of view and uses the optics of the telescope. It performs the functions of acquisition, identification and tracking of stars in its 2. 5 x 2. 5 arcminute field of view (FOV), and provides the centroid and magnitude of the selected star for use in LOS control. However, since only a single star is being tracked at any time within the FGS FOV there is only tip and tilt information; rotation about the FGS LOS will not be sensed. The FGCS uses the FSM to move the guide star within the FGS FOV and place the centroid of the guide star at any desired position within the FGS focal plane. Using this architecture allows the FGCS to correct the low frequency LOS jitter that is induced by the spacecraft ACS in pitch and yaw, and achieve the milli-arcsecond pointing stability required by JWST. The less stringent ISIM FOV roll performance will be provided solely by the ACS, using the spacecraft gyros and star trackers. Since the FSM is in the optical path, the pointing stabilrty of a science object in any of the instruments will be similar to that of the guide star LOS...|$|R
40|$|To reduce {{railway track}} {{maintenance}} costs {{and meet the}} growing demand for rail travel the railway industry needs to significantly increase the performance of old existing tracks and design any new tracks accordingly. In this thesis, a new full-scale laboratory Geopavement & Railway Accelerated Fatigue Testing (GRAFT) facility at Heriot-Watt University is developed to study the performance of both unreinforced and reinforced railway track substructure systems. The new GRAFT facility enables accelerated testing of full-scale railway tracks and innovative railway products under realistic railway loading conditions. The unreinforced track systems represent typical railway tracks in the UK while the reinforced track systems represent sections of track implemented with various geosynthetic products. GRAFT consists of a track constructed within a steel tank. The track comprises a 750 mm clay subgrade layer overlain by a clay formation layer overlain by a 300 mm ballast layer. The track includes three hardwood sleeper sections overlain by an I-section steel beam which has similar stiffness properties to a BS 113 A rail section. Cyclic loading {{is applied to the}} track from a hydraulic testing machine with the centre sleeper directly under the loading actuator. The loading mechanism replicates a repeated quasi <b>static</b> single <b>wheel</b> load on the central sleeper of one half of a 3 m long section of railway track. Based on the results found from the testing programme in GRAFT empirical relationships are developed between the unreinforced track performance in terms of track settlement and stiffness and the subgrade modulus, applied load and number of applied cycles. These relationships fit the GRAFT data presented in this thesis well and it is thought that they could be used (tentatively) to estimate track settlement on track after tamping/ballast renewal/new track. These relationships are shown to be consistent with other well known track settlement models and they indicate that subgrade stiffness and applied vertical load are two of the most significant parameters that influence track substructure deterioration. The results found from the reinforced track tests quantify the improvement in track performance available with each product under various track conditions. Two ballast ii reinforcement products have been tested; XiTRACK reinforcement and geocell reinforcement, along with a reinforced geocomposite used primarily for separation at the ballast/subgrade interface. In addition, a geocomposite product designed to replace a traditional sand blanket, used on the tracks where severe subgrade erosion conditions prevail, has been tested in GRAFT under flooding conditions. The most significant results show that XiTRACK reinforcement can considerably improve the performance of railway tracks while the performance of the track implemented with the sand blanket replacement product indicates that currently a traditional sand blanket with a geotextile separator is the recommended option for tracks with subgrade wet spots. From all the data recorded empirical settlement models are proposed for each of the geosynthetics compared for reinforcement purposes. These models form the basis for reinforced track design graphs that could potentially be used to form part of an initial cost-benefit analysis of different track reinforcement techniques considered for improving track performance and reducing maintenance. In order to use the track settlement design graphs developed within this thesis (in the field) a reliable measure of subgrade stiffness needs to be made on track. A reliable insitu measuring device could enhance railway site investigations. Several in-situ measuring devices that could potentially be used to measures subgrade stiffness and strength in the field have been tested within GRAFT. The devices studied include the Dynamic Cone Penetrometer (DCP), Light Falling Weight Deflectometer (LFWD), Pocket Penetrometer and Proving Ring Penetrometer. The accuracy of these devices is compared to Plate Load Tests (PLT) and unconfined compression strength tests and suggestions towards the use of such devices on track made. The results indicate that the DCP {{has the potential to be}} a quick and accurate in-situ measuring device for railway track site investigations. The GRAFT facility and the results found in GRAFT have been validated using a basic static 3 D FE computer model termed SART 3 D (Static Analysis of Railway Track 3 D). The program has been calibrated to GRAFT by modifying the FE mesh for the dimensions of GRAFT and inputting the GRAFT track properties. The validated results from this thesis have direct practical implications to the railway industry in terms of iii design recommendations on how best to investigate and improve key geotechnical parameters that influence railway track performance and hence reduce maintenance costs and extend asset life. A review of current design procedures used in the railway industry is given and a new design procedure is suggested to reduce track maintenance and offer an optimised design and maintenance strategy...|$|R
