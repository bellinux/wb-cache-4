40|$|Jens Eggvin (1899 - 1989) was {{employed}} at the Institute of Marine Research (IMR) in Bergen {{as head of}} its physical oceanographic activities in 1933. He followed a Norwegian tradition in relating the physical conditions of the ocean with fisheries. In 1935 he established several fixed hydrographic stations along the Norwegian coast and installed thermographs aboard several regular coastal steamers. In doing so, the entire 2700 km Norwegian of coast was covered by regular observations of {{the temperature in the}} surface layer. Later this program was extended to include samples for salinity determination at fixed locations along the coast and also to include a number of shipping routes across the North Sea [...] The system of the fixed hydrographic stations were conducted by local observers, usually fishermen, but trained by IMR. This Norwegian Coastal Observing System is still in operation today. Eggvin was also a pioneer in oceanographic forecasting. An excellent demonstration of the advantage of the new observation system was described in his doctoral thesis “The movement of a cold water front” from 1940. He was able to follow an outbreak of cold water from the Skagerrak and its propagation along the southern Norwegian coast. This work was the basis for later forecasts on cold-water outbreaks and the transporting of harmful algae, both of great importance especially for the fish farmers. It was early known that the cod in the Lofoten area preferred to spawn in the transition layer between the cold coastal water and the warmer water of Atlantic origin below. The temperature of the transition layer was between 4 o and 6 o C and the depth of this layer showed great inter-annual variations. These variations influenced fisheries in several ways. Eggvin submitted in many years regular forecasts for the depth of the transition layer {{before the start of the}} fisheries. At the ICES meeting in 1959 Eggvin strongly advocated for “synoptic oceanography” for the benefit of fisheries. “We know that certain hydrographic situations influence the fisheries in various ways. If we can predict such special hydrographic situations, we can expect to be able to assist the fisheries with valuable information, knowing in advance that certain oceanographic conditions affect the fish in such and such a manner that we shall know how the fisheries will turn out” Today, this term is called “Operational Oceanography”. On Eggvin initiative the first ICES pilot project on <b>synoptic</b> <b>oceanography</b> was carried out during the period January- March 1966 with Norway as the lead country...|$|E
40|$|The {{existing}} {{need for}} synoptic subsurface observations was demonstrated giving {{special attention to}} the requirements of meteorology. The current state of synoptic oceanographic observations was assessed; a preliminary design for the Basic Observational Network needed to fulfill the minimum needs of <b>synoptic</b> meteorology and <b>oceanography</b> was presented. There is an existing critical need for such a network in the support of atmospheric modeling and operational meteorological prediction, and through utilization of the regional water mass concept an adequate observational system can be designed which is realistic in terms of cost and effort...|$|R
40|$|A {{sequence}} of surface pigment {{images of the}} 1980 phytoplankton spring bloom on the Grand Bank of Newfoundland {{was derived from the}} Nimbus- 7 Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS). This data set is augmented with in situ observations of physical and biological data to examine spatial and temporal variability of the surface pigment fields. The satellite imagery suggests considerable temporal and spatial variability in surface chlorophyll concentrations across the period of investigation. Patterns in near-surface pigment concentrations were associated with the evolution of the spring bloom. [...] A semi-empirical model, which is in part physiologically based, is presented which utilizes integral chlorophyll (IC), photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) and light absorption by chlorophyll to predict integral production (IP). A preliminary assessment of the relationship between sea-surface temperature (SST), water column stability (VS), integral chlorophyll (IC), and remote sensing optical depth (1 /K 490) allows the development of another model based on secondary variables to predict integral production (IP). Simultaneous assimilation of sea surface temperature and optical depth into one model for predicting integral chlorophyll demonstrates the usefulness and need for a thermal channel in future ocean color sensors. [...] Water column light utilization index, ψ, varies seasonally over the Grand Banks and cannot be treated as a constant in primary production models. Mean values of ϕc showed a twofold to sixfold variation from spring through summer. A shift in distribution of normalized quantum yield (i. e. ϕc / ϕmax) towards lower values in the upper 20 m suggested frequent occurrence of light saturation. [...] Chlorophyll determined from satellite imagery is used to calculate the depth-integrated pigment content of the euphotic zone. This value, along with a computed value of chlorophyll-specific cross section and computed values of quantum yield, are used in an algorithm developed to predict annual production on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. Adjustment of the phytoplankton physiological parameters was necessary to take seasonal variation into account. Mean primary production computed from the algorithm was 194 g C m⁻² yr⁻¹ which compared well with the mean shipboard measured value of 186 g C m⁻² yr⁻¹. [...] The work presented in this thesis represents a significant advance for the <b>synoptic</b> description of <b>oceanography</b> in the Newfoundland area and provides baseline information, for mid-latitude cold oceans, of use in pigment retrieval and production estimation from the proposed ocean color sensor (SeaWiFS) when it becomes available in 1993. The study gives CZCS-derived production estimates which are similar and reasonable in comparison to the few other such studies which have been carried out in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. ...|$|R
