5|$|At Essex County Road11, Highway3 enters rural southwestern Ontario, and is {{dominated}} by farmland for much of its length through Essex County. The now four-laned route becomes divided as it follows the Essex Bypass around {{the southern edge of}} Essex, with commercial services lining the highway, primarily on the north side. Returning to farmland and narrowing to a two lane undivided road, the highway continues southeast, passing nearby, but avoiding, several <b>small</b> <b>communities</b> that the original highway travelled through.|$|E

50|$|In Canada, EAS {{is still}} {{regulated}} by the CRTC, even though local service is subject to competition. In Canada, EAS is usually reflected as the appropriate monthly rate group {{for the number of}} lines that can be dialed toll-free - a <b>small</b> <b>community</b> gaining EAS with a large city usually means the large city's monthly rate applies to the <b>small</b> <b>community.</b> The rate alternately may be represented by a visible and separate charge, but is often much higher for the <b>small</b> <b>community.</b>|$|R

5|$|The bay {{serves as}} a nursery for shrimp and as an {{ecosystem}} for diverse species of birds and fish. Shrimp farms have been established inland to circumvent restrictions on the bay. The area close to shore is prone to flooding, and can sometimes accumulate large populations of mosquitos. As a consequence, no major settlements have been founded on the bay. However, the <b>small</b> <b>communities</b> of Port Alto and Carancahua have been established on the western and eastern shores, respectively.|$|E

5|$|M-33 is a north–south state {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the US state of Michigan {{that runs from}} Interstate 75 (I-75) at Alger in Arenac County north to M-27 near Cheboygan. In between, the trunkline runs through rural sections of the northeastern Lower Peninsula including state and national forest areas.

It runs concurrently with three other state highways, sharing pavement to connect through several <b>small</b> <b>communities</b> of Northern Michigan.|$|E
5|$|M-50 {{is a state}} {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the US state of Michigan. Although designated as an east–west highway, it is nearly a diagonal northwest–southeast route. The western terminus is at exit52 along Interstate 96 (I-96) near Alto a few {{miles east of the}} metro Grand Rapids area, and its eastern terminus is in downtown Monroe at US Highway24 (US24, Telegraph Road). In between the trunkline runs through seven counties of {{the southern part of the}} Lower Peninsula mostly through rural farm fields and <b>small</b> <b>communities.</b> The highway also runs through downtown Jackson to connect between two freeway sections of US127. In the Irish Hills area of the state southeast of Jackson, M-50 runs next to Michigan International Speedway.|$|E
5|$|Many <b>small</b> <b>communities</b> obtain their {{drinking}} water from diverse sources (lakes, streams, springs and groundwater wells). Levels of treatment vary widely, from rudimentary systems with coarse screening or settling followed by disinfection (usually chlorination), to more sophisticated systems using a filtration step. It {{should be noted}} that unless a high quality source is used, such as secure groundwater, disinfection alone is unlikely to guarantee that drinking water is safe from protozoa such as Giardia and Cryptosporidium, which are relatively resistant to standard disinfectants and which require additional removal steps such as filtration.|$|E

When discussing the War on Terror, Moore felt it was destroying <b>small</b> <b>communities</b> throughout the country with higher taxes and more pressure on the local governments. Moore and Vice Presidential candidate Stewart Alexander supported a 50% reduction of the United States Department of Defense spending, and using the other 50% to improve veteran benefits. Alexander proposed that retired veterans with 10–30 years of military service should receive an income of $15–30 thousand annually from the state.|$|E
5|$|NY43 heads southeastward from NY66, {{passing through}} mostly rural, forested areas as it {{proceeds}} toward the Massachusetts state line.

It passes through Dunham Hollow and enters the town of Stephentown as it serves the hamlet of West Stephentown. NY43 continues through forested areas of Stephentown to Stephentown Center, denoted by a cluster of homes near the intersection of NY43 and Newton Road.|$|E

5|$|Polar bears can be {{hunted for}} sport in Canada {{with a special}} permit and accompaniment by a local guide. This can be an {{important}} source of income for <b>small</b> <b>communities,</b> as guided hunts bring in more income than selling the polar bear hide on markets. The United States, Russia, Norway, Greenland, and Canada allow subsistence hunting, and Canada distributes hunting permits to indigenous communities. The selling of these permits is a main source of income for many of these communities. Their hides can be used for subsistence purposes, kept as hunting trophies, or can be bought in markets.|$|E
5|$|Settlement on the Mendip Hills {{appears to}} fall into two types. The first, {{apparent}} in the Neolithic and Bronze Age Britain periods, and repeated {{on a small scale}} in the Middle Ages and post-medieval era, comprised occupation by self-sufficient groups in <b>small</b> <b>communities</b> or isolated farms. The second was represented in the Iron Age Britain and Roman periods by large sites with specialist functions, existing by virtue of their ability to exert power over lowland producers. From the Iron Age onward the ownership of land took on increasing importance, with large landholdings based on the mines or on stock grazing, denying settlers access to the plateau or forcing them off the hills.|$|E
5|$|The more {{commonly}} spoken languages dominate the less commonly spoken languages, so the less commonly spoken languages eventually disappear from populations. The {{total number of}} languages {{in the world is}} not known. Estimates vary depending on many factors. The consensus is that there are between 6,000 and 7,000 languages spoken as of 2010, and that between 50–90% of those will have become extinct by the year 2100. The top 20 languages, those spoken by more than 50 million speakers each, are spoken by 50% of the world's population, whereas many of the other languages are spoken by <b>small</b> <b>communities,</b> most of them with less than 10,000 speakers.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from the}} Bengali majority, {{there are a}} number of <b>small</b> <b>communities</b> of ethnic {{minorities}} in the area. Many of the resident Rakhine people are believed to have settled here during the Arakanese rule of Chittagong (1459–1666), though the event is not historically traceable. The Rakhine population in Khagrachari District migrated from the surrounding area and built up their permanent abode at Ramgarh in the 19th century. Other ethnic groups include the recently migrated Tripuri people. In the District of Chittagong that includes Sitakunda, the population ratio by religion in 2001 was Muslim 83.92%, Hindu 13.76%, Buddhist 2.01% and Christian 0.12%, with 0.19% following other religions. In 1981, it was Muslim 82.79%, Hindu 14.6%, Buddhist 2.23% and Christian 0.21%, with 0.19% following other religions. Chittagonian, a derivative of Bengali spoken by 14million people mainly in the Chittagong district, is the dominant language.|$|E
