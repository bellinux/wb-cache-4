50|$|The first {{electronic}} ballistic chronograph {{was invented}} by Kiryako ("Jerry") Arvanetakis in the 1950s. As consulting engineer under contract by NACA (later NASA), {{he was asked to}} find a way to accurately measure the velocity of various projectiles fired at hyper-velocities into a variety of engineered materials in anticipation of manned space flight. His first design was an open rectangular frame of <b>square</b> aluminum <b>tubing</b> with a screen of fine copper wire at both ends. Breaking the first wire started charging a capacitor, breaking the second wire stopped it. Measuring the accumulated voltage and knowing the rate of charge the elapsed time could be accurately calculated.|$|R
50|$|A {{shaker screen}} {{consists}} of the following parts:*Screen Frame- Much like a canvas for painting a screen has to be supported on a frame {{in order to do}} its job, this frame differs between manufacturers in both material and shape. Screen frames can be made from materials such as, <b>square</b> steel <b>tubing,</b> flat steel sheets, plastic type composites or they can just be supported on the ends with strips of steel (similar idea to a scroll). These frames consist of a rectangular shaped outer perimeter which is divided into small individual inner panels. These smaller panels differ in shape from manufacturer to manufacturer and have been known to come in shapes such as square, hexagonal, rectangular and even triangular.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was invented}} in the mid-1960s at the California Institute of Technology by Prof Nehr and Leighton.

The original track was about 1 meter long with tiny air orifices and highly compressed air. Stull returned to Alfred Univ. Where he developed a simple version using standard <b>square</b> aluminum <b>tubing</b> with large air orifices and air from the vent of a shop vacuum cleaner. Stull with Ferguson's help at Ealing designed a custom aluminum track that Ealing offered commercially in various lengths up to 10 meters. T. Walley Williams III at Ealing extended the concept to the 2-dimensional air table in 1969.|$|R

50|$|The Borz {{was very}} simple and {{inexpensive}} to produce, costing about $100 in Chechnya. The receiver could be <b>square</b> steel <b>tubing</b> with a stamped steel dust-cover {{on top and}} trunnions {{in the front and}} rear, although some versions have a round receiver. The bolt design closely mimicked that of the Soviet PPS, and the magazine was based on the magazine used in the German MP 40. The trigger mechanism has features in common with the Madsen M-50, and enables both fully automatic and single fire. The ejector and barrel locking nut also resemble those of the Madsen. Its lightweight design and ease of use was ideal for sudden attacks, making up for its quality shortcomings. The barrel would generally wear out after firing about three magazines worth of ammunition, with the result of increasingly poor accuracy. Like many improvised firearms (such as the FP-45 Liberator), the Borz submachine gun was intended for use by guerillas as a crude semi-disposable weapon to ambush police and military forces in urban settings, after which they could obtain higher-quality factory-produced arms from the dead and wounded.|$|R
30|$|Specimens {{were then}} {{hydrated}} for 1  h in PBS. Each femur was potted in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) bone cement (DePuyOrthopaedics, Inc., IN) in sections of <b>square</b> aluminum <b>tubing</b> in a custom jig to ensure axial alignment and constant gage length. The bone cement {{was allowed to}} set for 2  h prior to rehydration in PBS {{at room temperature for}} 1 – 2  h. Plated specimens were centered in the gage length based on the center of the fixation plate. Nonplated specimens were centered in the gage length based on anatomical landmarks (lateral ridge on the proximal half) for consistency. Prior to testing, the titanium plates were cut perpendicularly through the center using a hand Dremel and a stainless steel, diamond coated disc (Part # 011960 U 0, Brasseler USA Dental Instrumentation, GA). A # 11 scalpel blade was inserted in the space between the bone and plate to protect the femur from the Dremel blade during cutting. Specimens were tested in torsion using an EnduraTec TestBench system (200  N-mm torque cell; Bose Corporation, MN) at 1 °/s until failure. Testing was stopped if specimens showed no torsional resistance by 30 – 40 ° of rotation.|$|R
50|$|The {{frame was}} the most {{innovative}} aspect of the bike. Suzuki abandoned steel altogether and built the frame from welded <b>square</b> section aluminium <b>tubing.</b> To gain the rigidity they wanted, the tubes were quite large, giving the bike a unique appearance.

The seating position was the racer's crouch, not the street rider's semi-upright one. It shipped stock with the motor tuned to deliver 100HP, but could be easily boosted to 135 with the race tuning kit. It was the lightest of the superbikes by a good margin, weighing only 388 lbs. Styling too was aggressive and unique, with a signature full fairing holding two round headlights, starting a trend that continues on supersport motorcycles to this day.|$|R

5000|$|Casey and {{his team}} {{developed}} and built the second Tornado Intercept Vehicle, dubbed TIV 2, to be featured in their next IMAX movie and the Storm Chasers series. Work began in September 2007 by forty welding students at the Great Plains Technology Center in Lawton, Oklahoma and was completed {{in time for the}} 2008 tornado chase season. TIV 2 was designed to address some of the problems experienced with the original TIV, namely its low ground clearance, lack of four-wheel drive, and low top speed. It is based on a Dodge Ram 3500 that was strengthened and converted to six-wheel drive by adding a third axle. After season two the six-wheel drive system was modified to four-wheel drive. It is powered by a 6.7-liter Cummins turbo charged Diesel engine, modified with propane and water injection to produce [...] This gives TIV 2 an estimated top speed of over 100 mi/h km/h. Its fuel capacity is 95 gal, giving TIV 2 an approximate range of 750 mi. The body of TIV 2 is constructed of a 1/8-inch steel skin welded over a 2 in <b>square</b> <b>tubing</b> steel frame. The windows in TIV 2 are all bullet-resistant 1.63 in interlayered polycarbonate sheets and tempered glass. TIV 2 also features an IMAX filming turret similar to the one on the original TIV. The original TIV's somewhat cumbersome hydraulic claws were not used on TIV 2 in favor of six hydraulic skirts that drop down to deflect wind over the TIV to stabilize it and protect the underside from debris, and four hydraulically operated anchoring spikes.|$|E
50|$|Roberts searched {{and found}} a 1972 De Tomaso Pantera, which was {{perfectly}} suited for the Testarossa body pieces. The Pantera was rigidly modified to withstand the duties of filming. It was raised 1.5 inches for additional ground clearance, 2.5 inch wall-thick <b>square</b> <b>tubing</b> was used to prevent potential roof buckling and added a reinforcing railing {{that doubles as a}} skid plate, an auxiliary braking system designed to assist drivers in controlled spins, the master cylinder was repositioned in the brake line to enable it to feed the rear wheels enabling the driver to lock the aft end on command, and the auxiliary master cylinder utilizes the original master cylinder's reservoir and is installed in series with the outlet of the original master cylinder port leading to the rear wheels. When the stock brake is applied, fluid passes freely through the stunt master cylinder inlet port and compensating port and out the exhaust port to the rear wheels. When the stunt brake is applied, the piston in the master cylinder blocks off the compensating port to the exhaust port and pressurizes the rear brake system, cutting off the original brake master cylinder besides the compensating port in the stunt brake. BF Goodrich TA's were added for enhanced stick, as were Tilton brake calipers. The improved traction required installation of a hydraulic in-line brake power booster lifted from a Volvo P-1800. It operates on engine vacuum to aid in breaking loose the pavement-hugging TA's. To further enhance the growl of the vehicle, Robert's team installed a NOS port-injected nitrous system, which was later replaced with a plate-type configuration. He also replaced the carburetor replacing the stock with a Predator which reduces fuel lag. A Modine all-aluminum four-core radiator was used to guard against Miami's hot weather, and liquid Auto-Meter gauges to monitor the temperature.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Lack of {{electricity}} {{is one of}} the most crippling problems of India. The purpose of this paper is to design a power generating device which acts as an active speed breaker. The prototype is a one-sided, one-way device which emphasizes function over form. This is done with a hydraulic system including an actuator, accumulator, and hydraulic motor. This is coupled to a permanent magnet alternator which converts the low torque, high speed output of the motor into useful electri-cal energy. All of this is housed inside a steel frame made of rectangular and <b>square</b> hollow <b>tubing,</b> attached to the frame is a paddle on a pivot point which is depressed by the weight of a vehicle. This downward motion is transmitted to the hydraulic actuator which pumps fluid through the system. The actuator was cycled up and down repeatedly in order to charge the accumulator until the system reached the desired pressure. The automatic switch within the system would then open the valve to the motor and the system would discharge and generate power. A hydraulic transducer was also fitted at multiple points within the system to monitor the system pres-sure before and after the accumulator during the charge and discharge cycles. The goal of this investigation is to propose a setup for power generation which can be used in metropolitan cities as a speed breaker so that when the vehicle passes over the speed breaker, the kinetics energy developed can be converted in the power generation. This provides a starting point for utilities in developing coun...|$|R
50|$|The Tornado Intercept Vehicle 1 (TIV 1) is {{a heavily}} {{modified}} 1997 Ford F-Super Duty cab & chassis truck {{used as a}} storm chasing platform and built by Sean Casey. This heavily armored vehicle can drive into a weak to relatively strong tornado (EF0 to EF3) to film it and take measurements. Work began on the TIV in 2003 and took around eight months to finish, at a total cost of around US$81,000. TIV's armored shell consists of 1/8-1/4 inch steel plate welded to a two inch <b>square</b> steel <b>tubing</b> frame. The windows are bullet resistant polycarbonate, measuring 1.5 in thick on the windshield and 0.5 in thick on the sides. The TIV weighs approximately 14,000 lb fully loaded and {{is powered by a}} 7.3 litre Ford Powerstroke turbocharged diesel engine manufactured by Navistar-International, otherwise known as the International T444E. The vehicle's speed was limited by the factory Ford PCM, giving it a top speed of 100 mi/h km/h. The TIV has a fuel capacity of 60 gal, giving it a range of around 500 mi. The TIV is featured in a series called Storm Chasers which began airing on the Discovery Channel in October 2007. TIV was succeeded in 2008 by TIV 2, but returned to service to finish out the 2008 storm chasing season after TIV 2 suffered mechanical problems. In a June 2011 interview with NPR's All Things Considered, Casey said that TIV is still in service and is designated as the backup vehicle in the event TIV 2 breaks down during a shoot.|$|R
5000|$|In common usage {{the words}} {{pipe and tube}} are usually interchangeable, but in {{industry}} and engineering, the terms are uniquely defined. Depending on the applicable standard {{to which it is}} manufactured, pipe is generally specified by a nominal diameter with a constant outside diameter (OD) and a schedule that defines the thickness. Tube is most often specified by the OD and wall thickness, but may be specified by any two of OD, inside diameter (ID), and wall thickness. Pipe is generally manufactured to one of several international and national industrial standards. While similar standards exist for specific industry application tubing, tube is often made to custom sizes and a broader range of diameters and tolerances.
