50|$|This small {{dragonfly}} {{is seen in}} a {{wide variety}} of habitats, including lakes, ponds, canals and slow-flowing rivers. They are ambush predators, waiting on a prominent perch - such as a leaf or the top of a gate, until prey fly past, whereupon they will fly after it. They are territorial on breeding waters, often attempting to chase much bigger dragonflies away such as <b>southern</b> <b>hawkers.</b> This habit of repeatedly returning to a sunny spot allows you to easily predict where they are going to land, which is why it is one of the easiest dragonflies to photograph.|$|R
50|$|Aeshna affinis, the <b>southern</b> migrant <b>hawker</b> or blue-eyed hawker, is a {{dragonfly}} {{found in}} southern Europe and Asia. It {{is in the}} family Aeshnidae and is very similar in appearance to A. mixta.|$|R
500|$|<b>Southern</b> Migrant <b>Hawker</b> {{was known}} {{from just a}} single record, in Kent in 1952, {{although}} an Aeshna seen in 1992 {{on the outskirts of}} Bristol may have been this species (Holmes 1993 [...] ), and the species has been recorded twice in Jersey since 1998 (Long 2000, Parr 2005 [...] ). However in 2006 four specimens were seen: In the Adur valley in West Sussex on 13 July Grimstone Warren, Norfolk on 21 July; Little Wootton Inclosure New Forest (SZ 227 987) on 6 August; And {{at the mouth of the}} Beaulieu River in Hampshire on 10 August. since 2012 it has probably become established as a breeding species in the Thames Estuary area.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Southern</b> <b>hawker</b> (A. cyanea) - {{recorded}} on St Mary's in October 1992 and October 1996 and from Tresco also in October 1996.|$|E
50|$|Notable {{invertebrates}} include nine {{species of}} Odonata, including the <b>Southern</b> <b>Hawker,</b> Aeshna cyanea, {{as well as}} a grass-mining fly, Opomyza punctella, and a leaf beetle, Longitarsus reichei, which are locally rare.|$|E
50|$|The <b>southern</b> <b>hawker</b> breeds {{in still}} or slow-flowing water, but will wander widely, {{and is often}} seen in gardens and open woodland. This is an {{inquisitive}} species and will approach people.|$|E
50|$|In January 1943 the {{squadron}} moved to South Wales to train as a ground-attack unit, {{where it was}} equipped with Hawker Hurricanes. Operations against enemy shipping and coastal targets began in June 1943. Squadron Leader Percy Beake {{was put in charge}} of the Squadron in May 1944. After providing support for the landing forces from <b>southern</b> England, using <b>Hawker</b> Typhoons, {{the squadron}} moved to France in July 1944. During the Battle of Normandy, No.164 used its rockets against enemy armour in the battle area and after the breakout moved forward through northern France and Belgium in support of the 21st Army Group.|$|R
50|$|The reserve {{supports}} {{large numbers}} of fly, snail, spider and beetle species. Damselflies found here include the emerald, azure, large red, red-eyed, variable and common blue; together with dragonflies such as the <b>southern</b> and brown <b>hawkers,</b> emperor, hairy dragonfly and black-tailed skimmer. The Lepidoptera fauna is very rich also, especially the moths, with over 1000 species. The nationally rare reed leopard moth is common at the site. Other local moths include cream-bordered green pea, yellow-legged clearwing and emperor. China-mark moths such as the small, brown and ringed are also seen here. Local butterflies include the green hairstreak, brown argus, speckled wood and brimstone. There are a range of freshwater and land snails including the Red Data Book species Desmoulin's whorl snail.|$|R
50|$|Nesting birds include mallard. Common frog, {{palmate newt}} and smooth newt breed in the pools. Dragonflies {{recorded}} include four-spotted chaser, broad-bodied chaser, <b>southern</b> <b>hawker,</b> brown hawker, emperor, common darter {{and the small}} red damselfly.|$|E
50|$|There is {{one small}} pond in Sydenham Hill Wood {{which has been}} {{enhanced}} {{over the years and}} is surveyed by volunteers. Common frog and smooth newt are resident, as well as <b>southern</b> <b>hawker</b> dragonfly, common blue and red-tailed damselflies.|$|E

The bouquet shows Rosa gallica, poppy, Pieris, Myosotis, Gentiana, Viburnum opulus, Tagetes lucida, Tagetes patula, butterfly, <b>Southern</b> <b>Hawker,</b> and Calliphoridae.The vase itself is an object created by Johannes Lutma in the auricular style.|$|E
50|$|Some {{insects and}} {{dragonfly}} {{to be seen}} on the river include banded demoiselle, emerald damselfly, scarce emerald damselfly, large red damselfly, red-eyed damselfly, small red-eyed damselfly, azure damselfly, common blue damselfly, blue-tailed damselfly, migrant hawker, <b>southern</b> <b>hawker,</b> brown hawker, emperor dragonfly, four-spotted chaser, broad-bodied chaser, black-tailed skimmer, keeled skimmer, common darter, ruddy darter, common hawker, Norfolk hawker, hairy dragonfly, red-veined darter, yellow-winged darter, black darter and the variable damselfly.|$|E
50|$|The Woorgreens {{reserve is}} {{considered}} to be the Forest of Dean's best dragonfly site, and over seventeen species have been recorded. Some of the species are scarce and breeding colonies in this area are important. They are supported by the network of other ponds and ditches in the area, such as Kensley pond. Breeding populations recorded include blue-tailed damselfly, large red damselfly, azure damselfly, <b>southern</b> <b>hawker,</b> ruddy sympetrum, broad-bodied chaser and the emperor dragonfly.|$|E
50|$|Fry {{of smooth}} newt was {{reported}} in 2000, the only amphibian reported by the lake. An inventory of damselflies in 1997 resulted in a list of emerald damselfly, red-eyed damselfly, variable damselfly, <b>southern</b> <b>hawker,</b> brilliant emerald, four-spotted chaser, eastern white-faced darter, and black darter. A second inventory in 2000 produced the following list interpreted as a normal amount of species: common hawker, brown hawker, Irish damselfly, variable damselfly, downy emerald, red-eyed damselfly, northern white-faced darter, brilliant emerald, and black darter.|$|E
50|$|It is 74 mm {{long with}} a brown body. The male has a black abdomen with paired {{blue and yellow}} spots on each {{abdominal}} segment, and narrow stripes along the dorsal surface of the thorax. In the female, the abdomen is brown with yellow or sometimes green or blue spots. The wings of both sexes display a yellow costa (the major vein running along {{the leading edge of}} the wings). This species lacks the green thorax stripes of the <b>southern</b> <b>hawker.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The <b>southern</b> <b>hawker</b> or blue hawker (Aeshna cyanea) is a 70 mm long {{species of}} hawker dragonfly.The species {{is one of}} the most common and most {{widespread}} dragonflies in Europe. The total range is West Palearctic and covers a large part of Europe (to Scotland and southern Scandinavia in the North to Italy (without the Southwest) and the northern Balkans to the South); the Eastern boundary is formed by the Ural and the West by Ireland. It is also found in Northwest Africa (Algeria). In Central Europe the species is very common ...|$|E
50|$|Delamere Forest {{encompasses}} broadleaved {{and mixed}} woodlands, blocks of coniferous plantation, {{as well as}} grassland and wetland. The area provides a habitat for numerous woodland bird species, including nuthatches, treecreepers, crossbills, siskins, tawny owls and great spotted and green woodpeckers. Dragonflies such as the <b>southern</b> <b>hawker</b> {{can be seen in}} the wetland areas; the nationally scarce white-faced darter has been observed at several sites within the forest, including Black Lake. Butterflies such as the small tortoiseshell are common in the Old Pale area. Adders have been observed in the woodland, and mammals seen here include badgers, foxes and bats.|$|E
50|$|Another {{species of}} note, {{found in the}} wet flushed areas, is the nationally {{uncommon}} keeled skimmer dragonfly (Orthetrum coerulescens). This is a species of southern wet heathlands whose larvae develop in the wet mud of base-enriched flushes or bog pools. The valley is particularly rich in Odonata species: dragonflies recorded include the emperor (Anax imperator), golden-ringed (Cordulegaster boltonii), broad-bodied chaser (Libellula depressa), four-spotted chaser (Libellula quadrimaculata), <b>southern</b> <b>hawker</b> (Aeshna cyanea), common hawker (Aeshna juncea), black-tailed skimmer (Orthetrum cancellatum), common darter (Sympetrum striolatum), and black darter (Sympetrum danae); damselflies include the large red (Pyrrhosoma nymphula), azure (Coenagrion puella), emerald (Lestes sponsa), common blue (Enallagma cyathigerum), blue-tailed (Ischnura elegans), scarce blue-tailed (Ischnura pumilio), and beautiful demoiselle (Calopteryx virgo).|$|E
50|$|Brown hares and European otters {{are found}} {{all along the}} north Norfolk coast, but red {{squirrels}} disappeared from the Holkham pines by 1981. The rare natterjack toad breeds at Holkham, {{one of only two}} sites along this coast, although the common frog, common toad and common lizard are widespread in appropriate habitats.The green hairstreak, purple hairstreak, comma, hummingbird hawk-moth, broad-bordered bee hawk-moth and ghost moth are sometimes seen in the woods with the common butterfly and moth species, and a clouded yellow or Camberwell beauty may also occur in some years. Grayling, small heath and common blue butterflies {{can be found in the}} dunes, where there is also a large antlion colony, making Holkham one of only two locations for this predatory insect in the UK. Dragonflies include the migrant hawker, <b>southern</b> <b>hawker</b> and ruddy darter.|$|E
50|$|In recent years, Leicestershire County Council {{took over}} clay {{workings}} and coal pits in the Sence Valley between Ravenstone, Ibstock and Heather and later transferred {{them to the}} Forestry Commission, which reclaimed the area as the Sence Valley Forest Park. It contains woodland, lakes linked to the River Sence, grassland and a wild flower meadow. An artificial nesting wall for sand martins has also been constructed alongside Horseshoe Lake. In this varied habitat, 150 species of bird have been recorded. The lakes provide habitat for heron, coot, tufted duck, pochard, wigeon and great-crested grebe. Kestrels nest each year and, though less evident in daytime, there are barn owls and short-eared owls. Raptors, marsh, hen and Montague's harrier, osprey, red-footed falcon, merlin, peregrine and buzzard have all been seen. The bird list for the park currently stands at 101 species. Long grassy areas have become home for many wild mammals including field vole, shrew, stoat, rabbit and fox. Water voles are present on streams feeding the river. Otters too are once again using the river. Among the species of bats are pipistrelle, Daubenton's bat and noctule. Insects in summer include gatekeeper butterfly, meadow brown, speckled wood, small skipper, green-veined white, peacock butterfly and small tortoiseshell. Around the lakes, damselflies such as common blue, blue-tailed and azure as well as dragonflies such as the <b>southern</b> <b>hawker</b> and brown hawker are also fairly abundant.|$|E
