40|$|Abstract. We {{present results}} demonstrating similar {{distributions}} of student scores, and statistically indistinguishable gains on two popular research-based assessment tools: the Brief Electricity and Magnetism Assessment (BEMA) and the Conceptual Survey of Electricity and Magnetism(CSEM). To deepen {{our understanding of}} <b>student</b> learning <b>in</b> <b>our</b> course environment and of these assessment tools as measures of student learning, we identify systematic trends and differences in results from these two instruments. We investigate correlations of both pre- and post- conceptual scores with other measures including traditional exam scores and course grades, student background (earlier grades), gender, a pretest of scientific reasoning, and tests of attitudes and beliefs about science and learning science. Overall, for practical purposes, we find the BEMA and CSEM are roughly equivalently useful instruments for measuring <b>student</b> learning <b>in</b> <b>our</b> course...|$|R

Our research question is: can reflectiuve journals be used to identify struggling students? Previous work with reflective journals has not related the level of reflection with module outcomes obtained by the <b>student.</b> <b>In</b> <b>our</b> study, we have classified journal entries written by first year <b>students</b> <b>in</b> a foundationalprogramming module based on the SOLO taxonomy and compared this against the outcomes of two module assessments.

[...] U.S. District Judge William H.

Mayo Clinic administrative records were reviewed for calendar years 1995 through 2008 {{to determine the effect}} of interventions to increase the numbers of appropriately qualified international VMSs and underrepresented minority VMSs. For numerical data, descriptive statistics were used; for comparisons, chi(2) tests were performed. During the specified period, 4908 VMSs participated in the Mayo VMS Program (yearly mean [SD], 351 [24]). Most students were from US medical schools (3247 [66 %]) and were male (3084 [63 %]). Overall, 3101 VMSs (63 %) applied for and 935 (30 %) were appointed to Mayo Clinic residency program positions. Interventions to address the challenge of large numbers of international <b>students</b> who participated <b>in</b> <b>our</b> VMS program but did not apply for Mayo residency positions resulted in significantly fewer international <b>students</b> participating <b>in</b> <b>our</b> VMS program (P<. 001), applying for Mayo residency program positions (P<. 001), and being appointed to residency positions (P=. 001).
