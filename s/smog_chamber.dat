According to the chair of the Air Resources Board, Mary Nichols, [...] "Jim Pitts was probably the single person most responsible for the understanding of what strategies we need to clean up Southern California's air...He was able to explain all of this in English to policymakers so that {{they would be able to}} accept that it was going to take extensive and difficult actions to control emissions." [...] He often invited state and federal officials to his <b>smog</b> <b>chamber</b> at UC Irvine, including Jerry Brown and Ronald Reagan, to demonstrate the effects of smog and air pollution. In a common demonstration, Pitts would fill an Erlenmeyer flask with ozone and then twist a slice of lemon onto the flask. The ensuing chemical reaction, which quickly produced a fog, demonstrated the formation of smog in the atmosphere.|$|E

With this set-up the observed particle size distributions of an exemplary experiment in Valencia was reproduced, when only the long-lived organic compounds like carboxylic acids and carbonyl compounds are detected by the available aerosol size distribution instruments.

40|$|International audienceThe {{formation}} of secondary organic aerosol from the gas-phase reaction of catechol (1, 2 -dihydroxybenzene) with ozone {{has been studied}} in two <b>smog</b> <b>chambers.</b> Aerosol production was monitored using a scanning mobility particle sizer and loss of the precursor was determined by gas chromatography and infrared spectroscopy, whilst ozone concentrations were measured using a UV photometric analyzer. The overall organic aerosol yield (Y) was determined as {{the ratio of the}} suspended aerosol mass corrected for wall losses (Mo) to the total reacted catechol concentrations, assuming a particle density of 1. 4 g cm 3. Analysis of the data clearly shows that Y is a strong function of Mo and that secondary organic aerosol formation can be expressed by a one-product gas-particle partitioning absorption model. The aerosol formation is affected by the initial catechol concentration, which leads to aerosol yields ranging from 17 % to 86 %. The results of this work are compared to similar studies reported in the literature...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} that {{liquefied petroleum gas}} (LPG) emissions can increase substantially the formation of ozone (O 3) in the ambient air. We tested experimentally such hypothesis in Guadalajara’s downtown by captive-air irradiation (CAI) techniques. During November 1997 -January, 1998, morning ambient air samples were confined in outdoor <b>smog</b> <b>chambers</b> and subjected to the follow-ing treatments: 35 % addition of commercial LPG or one out of two mixtures of major LPG compounds (propane/butane: 70 / 30 % or 60 / 40 %), 50 % dilution of total volatile hydrocarbons (VOCs), and 50 % dilution of LPG associated VOCs (C 2 -C 4). Captive and untreat-ed morning ambient air served as experimental control. This experi-ment ran under ambient sunlight and temperature. Chamber O 3 was measured hourly from 08 : 00 - 18 : 00 h, and the maximum O 3 concentra-tion (O 3 max) was used for treatment comparisons.

40|$|A new {{mechanism}} {{to simulate the}} formation of secondary organic aerosols (SOA) from reactive primary hydrocarbons is presented, together with comparisons with experimental <b>smog</b> <b>chamber</b> results and ambient measurements found in the literature. The SOA formation mechanism {{is based on an}} approach using calculated vapor pressures and a selection of species that can partition to the aerosol phase from a gas phase photochemical mechanism. The mechanism has been validated against <b>smog</b> <b>chamber</b> measurements using α-pinene, xylene and toluene as SOA precursors, and has an average error of 17 %. Qualitative comparisons with <b>smog</b> <b>chamber</b> measurements using isoprene were also performed. A comparison against SOA production in the TORCH 2003 experiment (atmospheric measurements) had an average error of only 12 %. This contrasts with previous efforts, in which it was necessary to increase partition coefficients by a factor of 500 in order to match the observed values. Calculations for rural and urban-influenced regions in the eastern U. S. suggest that most of the SOA is biogenic in origin, mainly originated from isoprene. A 0 -dimensional calculation based on the New England Air Quality Study also showed good agreement with measured SOA, with about 40 % of the total SOA from anthropogenic precursors.

40|$|Abstractα-Pinene/NOx and α-pinene/HONO {{photooxidation}} experiments at varying humidity {{were conducted}} in <b>smog</b> <b>chambers</b> in {{the presence or absence}} of FeSO 4 seed particles. FeSO 4 seed particles decrease SOA mass as long as water was present on the seed particle surface, but FeSO 4 seed particles have no decreasing effect on SOA under dryer conditions at 12 % relative humidity (RH). The decreasing effect of FeSO 4 seed particles on the SOA mass is proposed to be related to oxidation processes in the surface layer of water on the seed particles. Free radicals, including OH, can be formed from catalytic cycling of Fe 2 + and Fe 3 + in the aqueous phase. These radicals can react further with the organic products of α-pinene oxidation on the seed particles. The oxidation may lead to formation of smaller molecules which have higher saturation vapor pressures and favor repartitioning to the gas phase, and therefore, reduces SOA mass...|$|R
40|$|This work {{investigates the}} {{computer}} modelling of the photochemical formation of smog {{products such as}} ozone and aerosol, in a system containing toluene, NOx and water vapour. In particular, the problem of modelling this process in the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) <b>smog</b> <b>chambers,</b> which utilize outdoor exposure, is addressed. The primary requirement for such modelling is {{a knowledge of the}} photolytic rate coefficients. Photolytic rate coefficients of species other than N 02 are often related to JNo 2 (rate coefficient for the photolysis ofN 02) by a simple factor, but for outdoor chambers, this method is prone to error as the diurnal profiles may not be similar in shape. Three methods for the calculation of diurnal JNo 2 are investigated. The most suitable method for incorporation into a general model, is found to be one which determines the photolytic rate coefficients for N 02, as well as several other species, from actinic flux, absorption cross section and quantum yields. A computer model was developed, based on this method, to calculate in-chamber photolysis rate coefficients for the CSIRO <b>smog</b> <b>chambers,</b> in which ex-chamber rate coefficients are adjusted by accounting for variation in light intensity by transmittance through the Teflon walls, albedo from the chamber floor and radiation attenuation due to clouds. The photochemical formation of secondary aerosol is investigated in a series of toluene-NOx experiments, which were performed in the CSIRO <b>smog</b> <b>chambers.</b> Three stages of aerosol formation, in plots of total particulate volume versus time, are identified: a delay period in which no significant mass of aerosol is formed, a regime of rapid aerosol formation (regime 1) and a second regime of slowed aerosol formation (regime 2). Two models are presented which were developed from the experimental data. One model is empirically based on observations of discrete stages of aerosol formation and readily allows aerosol growth profiles to be calculated. The second model is based on an adaptation of published toluene photooxidation mechanisms and provides some chemical information about the oxidation products. Both models compare favorably against the experimental data. The gross effects of precursor concentrations (toluene, NOx and H 20) and ambient conditions (temperature, photolysis rate) on the formation of secondary aerosol are also investigated, primarily using the mechanism model. An increase in [NOx]o results in increased delay time, rate of aerosol formation in regime 1 and volume of aerosol formed in regime 1. This is due to increased formation of dinitrocresol and furanone products. An increase in toluene results in a decrease in the delay time and an increase in the rate of aerosol formation in regime 1, due to enhanced reactivity from the toluene products, such as the radicals from the photolysis of benzaldehyde. Water vapor has very little effect on the formation of aerosol volume, except that rates are slightly increased due to more OH radicals from reaction with 0 (1 D) from ozone photolysis. Increased temperature results in increased volume of aerosol formed in regime 1 (increased dinitrocresol formation), while increased photolysis rate results in increased rate of aerosol formation in regime 1. Both the rate and volume of aerosol formed in regime 2 are increased by increased temperature or photolysis rate. Both models indicate that the yield of secondary particulates from hydrocarbons (mass concentration aerosol formed/mass concentration hydrocarbon precursor) is proportional to the ratio [NOx] 0 /[hydrocarbon]...|$|R

40|$|This thesis treats aerosol {{behaviour}} {{under various}} conditions in enclosed spaces. Knowledge of this behaviour is of importance {{for the use of}} aerosol-filled enclosures as a supply of aerosol, as a means for aerosol characterization and for so-called <b>smog</b> <b>chambers</b> for air pollution research (mainly for the investigation of photochemical processes by which usually particles are formed). Chapter 1 gives a brief literature survey, indicating the limited attention given hitherto to aerosol behaviour in enclosed spaces. After decades of almost exclusive interest from meteorologists, {{since the beginning of the}} sixties, enclosed aerosols have become an important research subject in nuclear safety. Nuclear aerosol research, however, pertains mainly to high aerosol mass concentrations. In chapter 2 a model is given, describing aerosol removal from enclosed spaces. Usually, aerosol deposition on the walls occurs from a cloud with homogeneous space distribution due to thermal convection. The rate-limiting step of deposition is the transport through the boundary layer at the walls. Relations are derived for a number of removal mechanisms: sedimentation, diffusion, thermophoresis, diffusiophoresis, electrophoresis and photophoresis. From literature data and Fuchs' theory a relation is derived for the dependence of the boundary layer thickness δfor diffusive deposition on the diffusion coefficient D of aerosol particles in usual containments. Boundary conditions for non-stirred deposition of aerosols by sedimentation and diffusion are given. Chapter 3 summarizes the most important means used for experiments. In chapter 4 the experimental results and conclusions are presented. It consists of four sections dealing with unheated dry enclosures, heated dry enclosures, enclosures with a heated pool of liquid, and <b>smog</b> <b>chambers,</b> respectively. Observations on the behaviour of monodisperse and polydisperse aerosols in unheated dry enclosures support the model derived for sedimentation and diffusion. Additionally, the relation between δand D derived in chapter 2 is validated. Particles larger than a few tenths of a micron are removed by sedimentation; particles smaller than about 0. 1 μm aresubject to diffusive deposition, though often electrophoresis plays an important role (particularly, in case of particles of about 0. 1 μm). It is shown that aerosol measurements in containments can be used for determination of dynamic shape factors and aerodynamic diameters. Aerosols in heated dry containments are removed by thermophoresis. Observations on a large variety of aerosols and enclosures are in fair agreement with the model on thermophoretic removal derived in chapter 2. Interpretation of the experimental results yields the thermophoretic properties of aerosols. The results support the theories of Brock and Stetter, and are in disagreement with those of Derjaguin and Epstein. In accordance with theoretical predictions, thermophoretic decay constants are obtained independent of particle size (≥ 0. 5 μm), of particle material and of temperature. Gentle heating of the floor of a containment is shown to have a stabilizing effect on the enclosed aerosol. Introduction of aerosol in a containment with a heated pool of liquid on the floor leads to particle growth by vapour condensation followed by an accelerating removal by sedimentation. Experimental observations support a model describing aerosol behaviour in such systems. The knowledge of this aerosol behaviour allows study of condensation on aerosol particles and particle growth under conditions of variable degrees of supersaturation. The degree of supersaturation can be varied by means of the heating power dissipated in the pool of liquid as well as by means of solving substances in the liquid. Investigations of aerosol behaviour in photochemical <b>smog</b> <b>chambers</b> show insignificant deposition due to thermophoresis or photophoresis under these conditions. Observed aerosol stabilities could be explained by electrophoretic deposition, yielding a coherent picture with electrophoresis in other investigations. Coagulation constants of aerosol could be calculated from measurements on number concentrations of aerosols in enclosed spaces. The results obtained agree fairly well with Davies' theory on coagulation. Decay curves of number concentration of aerosols in metal vessels can be used for assessment of diffusion coefficients...|$|R

40|$|<b>Smog</b> <b>chambers</b> are {{extensively}} used {{to study}} processes that drive gas and particle evolution in the atmosphere. A limitation of these experiments is that particles and gas-phase species may be lost to chamber walls on shorter timescales than the timescales of the atmospheric processes being studied in the chamber experiments. These particle and vapor wall losses have been investigated in recent studies of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation, {{but they have not}} been systematically investigated in experiments of primary emissions from combustion. The semi-volatile nature of combustion emissions (e. g. from wood smoke) may complicate the behavior of particle and vapor wall deposition in the chamber {{over the course of the}} experiments due to the competition between gas/particle and gas/wall partitioning. Losses of vapors to the walls may impact particle evaporation in these experiments, and potential precursors for SOA formation from combustion may be lost to the walls, causing underestimations of aerosol yields. Here, we conduct simulations to determine how particle and gas-phase wall losses contributed to the observed evolution of the aerosol during experiments in the third Fire Lab At Missoula Experiment (FLAME III). We use the TwO-Moment Aerosol Sectional (TOMAS) microphysics algorithm coupled with the organic volatility basis set (VBS) and wall-loss formulations to examine the predicted extent of particle and vapor wall losses. We limit the scope of our study to the dark periods in the chamber before photo-oxidation to simplify the aerosol system for this initial study. Our model simulations suggest that over one-third of the initial particle-phase organic mass (41 %) was lost during the experiments, and over half of this particle-organic mass loss was from direct particle wall loss (65 % of the loss) with the remainder from evaporation of the particles driven by vapor losses to the walls (35 % of the loss). We perform a series of sensitivity tests to understand uncertainties in our simulations. Uncertainty in the initial wood-smoke volatility distribution contributes 18 % uncertainty to the final particle-organic mass remaining in the chamber (relative to base-assumption simulation). We show that the total mass loss may depend on the effective saturation concentration of vapor with respect to the walls as these values currently vary widely in the literature. The details of smoke dilution during the filling of <b>smog</b> <b>chambers</b> may influence the mass loss to the walls, and a dilution of ~ 25 : 1 during the experiments increased particle-organic mass loss by 33 % compared to a simulation where we assume the particles and vapors are initially in equilibrium in the chamber.

40|$|A {{new model}} for the {{formation}} of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) from isoprene was developed. This model uses surrogate molecular species (hydroxy-hydroperoxides, tetrols, methylglyceric acid, organic nitrates) to represent SOA formation. The development of this model used available experimental data on yields and molecular composition of SOA from isoprene and methacrolein oxidation. This model reproduces the amount of particles measured in <b>smog</b> <b>chambers</b> under both low-NO x and high-NO x conditions. Under low-NO x conditions, the model reproduces the transitional formation of hydroxy-hydroperoxides particles, which are photolyzed and lead to SOA mass decrease after reaching a maximum. Under high-NO x conditions, particles are assumed to be formed mostly from the photo-oxidation of a PAN-type molecule derived from methacrolein (MPAN). This model successfully reproduces the complex NO x -dependence of isoprene oxidation and suggests a possible yield increase under some high-NO x conditions. Experimental data correspond to dry conditions (RH < 10 %). However, particles formed from isoprene are expected to be highly hydrophilic, and isoprene oxidation products would likely partition between an aqueous phase and the gas phase at high humidity in the atmosphere. The model was extended {{to take into account the}} hydrophilic properties of SOA, which are relevant under atmospheric conditions, and investigate the effect of particulate liquid water on SOA formation. An important increase in SOA mass was estimated for humid conditions due to the hydrophilic properties. Experiments under high relative humidity conditions should be conducted to confirm the results of this study, which have implications for SOA modeling...|$|R

40|$|Assessment of the {{environmental}} impact of aircraft emissions is required by planners and policy makers. Seveal areas of concern are: 1. exposure of airport workers and urban residents to toxic chemicals emitted when the engines operate at low power (idle and taxi) on the ground; 2. contributions to urban photochemical air pollution of aircraft volatile organic and nitrogen oxides emissions from operations around airports; and 3. emissions of nitrogen oxides and particles during high-altitude operation. The environmental impact of chemicals emitted from jet aircraft turbine engines has not been firmly established due to lack of data regarding emission rates and identities of the compounds emitted. This paper describes an experimental study of two different aircraft turbine engines designed to determine detailed organic emissions, as well as emissions of inorganic gases. Emissions were measured at several engine power settings. Measurements were made of detailed organic composition from C 1 through C 17, CO, CO 2, NO, NO x, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Measurements were made using a multi-port sampling pro be positioned directly behind the engine in the exhaust exit plane. The emission measurements have been used to determine the organic distribution by carbon number and the distribution by compound class at each engine power level. The sum of the organic species was compared with an independent measurement of total organic carbon to assess the carbon mass balance.

The new particle formation (NPF) process is an ubiquitous phenomenon, yet poorly understood despite the many studies performed on this topic using various approaches (observation, experimentation in <b>smog</b> <b>chambers</b> and modeling). In this work, we investigate the formation of secondary charged aerosols and its climatology at Jungfraujoch, a high altitude site in Swiss Alps (3580 m a. s. l.). Charged particles and clusters (0. 5 &ndash; 1. 8 nm) were measured within the EUCAARI program from April 2008 to April 2009 and allowed the detection of nucleation events. We found that the aerosol concentration, which is dominated by cluster size class, shows a strong diurnal pattern and that the aerosol size distribution and concentration are strongly influenced by the presence of clouds either during daytime or nighttime conditions. New particle formation events have been investigated and it appears that new particle formation occurs 17. 5 % of measured days and that the nucleation frequency is strongly linked to air mass origin and path and negatively influenced by cloud presence. In fact, we show that NPF events depend on the occurrence of high concentration VOCs air masses which allowed clusters growing by condensation of organic vapors rather than nucleation of new clusters. Furthermore, the contribution of ions to nucleation process was studied and we found that ion-mediated nucleation (IMN) contribute to 26 % of the total nucleation so that ions {{play an important role in}} the new particle formation and growth at Jungfraujoch...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the sensitivity of}} secondary aerosol formation and oxidation capacity to NO (x) in homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions, a series of irradiated toluene/NO (x) /air and alpha-pinene/NO (x) /air experiments were conducted in <b>smog</b> <b>chambers</b> in the absence or presence of Al 2 O 3 seed particles. Various concentrations of NO (x) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were designed to simulate secondary aerosol formation under different scenarios for NO (x). Under "VOC-limited" conditions, the increasing NO (x) concentration suppressed secondary aerosol formation, while the increasing toluene concentration not only contributed {{to the increase in}} secondary aerosol formation, but also led to the elevated oxidation degree for the organic aerosol. Sulfate formation was suppressed with the increasing NO (x) due to a decreased oxidation capacity of the photooxidation system. Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation also decreased with the presence of high concentration of NO (x), because organoperoxy radicals (RO 2) react with NO (x) instead of with peroxy radicals (RO 2 or HO 2), resulting in the formation of volatile organic products. The increasing concentration of NO (x) enhanced the formation of sulfate, nitrate and SOA under "NO (x) -limited" conditions, in which the heterogeneous reactions played an important role. In the presence of Al 2 O 3 seed particles, a synergetic promoting effect of mineral dust and NO (x) on secondary aerosol formation in heterogeneous reactions was observed in the photooxidation. This synergetic effect strengthened the positive relationship between NO (x) and secondary aerosol formation under "NO (x) -limited" conditions but weakened or even overturned the negative relationship between NO (x) and secondary aerosol formation under "VOC-limited" conditions. Sensitivity of secondary aerosol formation to NO (x) seemed different in homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions, and should be both taken into account in the sensitivity study. The sensitivity of secondary aerosol formation to NO (x) was further investigated under "winter-like" and NH 3 -rich conditions. No obvious difference for the sensitivity of secondary aerosol formation except nitrate to NO (x) was observed...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} here {{characterization of}} a new state-of-the-art <b>smog</b> <b>chamber</b> facility for studying atmospheric gas phase and aerosol chemistry. The chamber consists of a 30 m 3 fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) Teflon film reactor suspended in a temperature-controlled enclosure equipped with two banks of black lamps as the light source. Temperature can be set {{in the range from}} − 10 °C to 40 °C at accuracy of ± 1 °C as measured by eight temperature sensors inside the enclosure and one just inside the reactor. Matrix air can be purified with NMHCs x /O 3 /carbonyls. The photolysis rate of NO 2 is adjustable between 0 – 0. 49 min − 1. At 298 K under dry conditions, the average wall loss rates of NO, NO 2 and O 3 were measured to be 1. 41 × 10 − 4 min − 1, 1. 39 × 10 − 4 min − 1 and 1. 31 × 10 − 4 min − 1, respectively; and the particle number wall loss rate to be 0. 17 h − 1. Auxiliary mechanisms of this chamber are determined and included in the Master Chemical Mechanism to evaluate and model propene-NO x -air irradiation experiments. The results indicate that this new <b>smog</b> <b>chamber</b> can provide high quality data for mechanism evaluation. Results of α-pinene dark ozonolysis experiments revealed SOA yields comparable to those from other chamber studies, and the two-product model gives a good fit for the yield data obtained in this work. Characterization experiments demonstrate that our GIG-CAS <b>smog</b> <b>chamber</b> facility can be used to provide valuable data for gas-phase mechanisms and aerosol chemistry...|$|E

40|$|We {{report the}} {{physical}} and chemical effects of photochemically aging dilute biomass-burning smoke. A "potential aerosol mass" (PAM) flow reactor was used with analysis by a high-resolution aerosol mass spectrometer and a proton-transfer-reaction ion-trap mass spectrometer during the FLAME- 3 campaign. Hydroxyl (OH) radical concentrations in the reactor reached up to ~ 1000 times average tropospheric levels, producing effective OH exposures equivalent to up to 5 days of aging in the atmosphere, and allowing for us to extend the investigation of smoke aging beyond the oxidation levels achieved in traditional <b>smog</b> <b>chambers.</b> Volatile organic compound (VOC) observations show aromatics and terpenes decrease with aging, while formic acid and other unidentified oxidation products increase. Unidentified gas-phase oxidation products, previously observed in atmospheric and laboratory measurements, were observed here, including evidence of multiple generations of photochemistry. Substantial new organic aerosol (OA) mass ("net SOA"; secondary OA) was observed from aging biomass-burning smoke, resulting in total OA average of 1. 42 ± 0. 36 times the initial primary OA (POA) after oxidation. This study confirms that the net-SOA-to-POA ratio of biomass-burning smoke is far lower on average than that observed for urban emissions. Although most fuels were very reproducible, significant differences were observed among the biomasses, with some fuels resulting in a doubling of the OA mass, while for others a very small increase or even a decrease was observed. Net SOA formation in the photochemical reactor increased with OH exposure (OH exp), typically peaking around three days of equivalent atmospheric photochemical age (OH exp ~ 3. 9 × 10 11 molecules cm − 3 s), then leveling off at higher exposures. The amount of additional OA mass added from aging is positively correlated with initial POA concentration, {{but not with the}} total VOC concentration or the concentration of known SOA precursors. The mass of SOA formed often exceeded the mass of the known VOC precursors, indicating the likely importance of primary semivolatile/intermediate volatility species, and possibly of unidentified VOCs as SOA precursors in biomass burning smoke. Chemical transformations continued even after mass concentration stabilized. Changes in the biomass-burning tracer f 60 ranged from substantially decreasing to remaining constant with increased aging. With increased OH exp, oxidation was always detected (as indicated by f 44 and O/C). POA O/C ranged from 0. 15 to 0. 5, while aged OA O/C reached up to 0. 87. The rate of oxidation and maximum O/C achieved differs for each biomass, and appears to increase with the initial O/C of the POA...|$|R
40|$|This thesis mainly {{described}} {{the development of}} studying the behavior and secondary organic aerosol formation from semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs). SVOCs comprises a significant fraction of the organic mass in particulate matter (PM), which has shown important impacts on human health and also influences on Earth’s climate. SVOCs are thought to play essential roles {{in the formation of}} SOA, chemical aging and mixing processes. <b>Smog</b> <b>chambers</b> have been extensively used to study SOA formation, chemical reaction and physical properties. The interaction between SVOC vapor with Teflon chamber wall and suspended particles is a key factor influencing organic aerosol formations and behaviors in chamber experiments. We observed that pinanediol (PD) showed a large chamber wall deposition and reached a steady concentration, only around 14 % of mass left in the gas phase. But we did not observe the release of PD from the chamber walls during isothermal dilution of the chamber with fresh air at 22 oC, which indicated there was no PD released from the chamber walls during the SOA formation. This clearly shows the vapor loss of SVOC precursors need to be considered when studying their SOA formation. The average carbon oxidation states the SOA from PD were calculated as around - 0. 7, which were similar to the value observed in CLOUD. Our data are consistent with ~ 10 % of the SOA with low volatility that could drive new particle formation. It is challenging to measure SVOC vapor concentrations and properties. A new approach is discussed in this thesis, studying SVOC vapors from measuring the particles. The SVOCs coated particles sustained the SVOCs in the gas phase at or near their saturation concentration. The mass loss of SVOCs from the suspended particles thus reflects SVOCs vapor wall loss. Our results show the vapor wall loss rate of SVOC is consistently proportional to the SVOC vapor concentrations. We observed PEG 400 seeds can sorb semi-volatile α-pinene SOA vapors. This allows us to trap semi-volatile α-pinene SOA into PEG 400 seeds and then analyze their compositions and properties through measuring particles. PEG 400 is liquid, water-soluble, nearly non-volatile, good solvent for SOA and relative stable during the oxidation with OH radicals and ozone. It can also be easily separated from the SOA mass spectrum with the unique fragment C 4 H 9 O 2 + at m/z= 89. The results demonstrated that SOA prepared from α-pinene reacted with OH produced more semi-volatile SOA vapors comparing to α-pinene ozonolysis. More semi-volatile SOA vapors were observed in the gas phase with higher SOA loadings. With well-built particle measurement methods, we may get more knowledge on the SVOC vapors...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) generated by irradiating 2 -methyl- 3 -buten- 2 -ol (MBO) {{in the presence}} and/or absence of NO x, H 2 O 2, and/or SO 2 was examined. Experiments were conducted in <b>smog</b> <b>chambers</b> operated either in dynamic or steady-state mode. A filter/denuder sampling system was used for simultaneously collecting gas and particle phase products. The structural characterization of gas and particulate products was investigated using BSTFA, BSTFA + PFBHA, and DNPH derivatization techniques followed by GC-MS and liquid chromatography analysis. This analysis showed the occurrence of more than 68 oxygenated organic compounds in the gas and particle phase, 28 of which were identified. The major components observed include 2, 3 -dihydroxyisopentanol (DHIP), 2 -hydroxy- 2 -oxoisopentanol, 2, 3 -dihydroxy- 3 -methylbutanal, 2, 3 -dihydroxy- 2 -methylsuccinic acid, 2 -hydroxy- 2 -methylpropanedioic acid, acetone, glyoxal, methylglyoxal, glycolaldehyde, and formaldehyde. Most of these oxygenated compounds were detected {{for the first time}} in this study. While measurements of the gas phase photooxidation products have been made, the focus of this work has been an examination of the particle phase. SOA from some experiments was analyzed for the organic mass to organic carbon ratio (OM/OC), the effective enthalpy of vaporization (ΔH vap eff), and the aerosol yield. Additionally, aerosol size, volume, and number concentrations were measured by a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer coupled to a Condensation Particle Counter system. The OM/OC was found to be 2. 1 in MBO/H 2 O 2 system. The ΔH vap eff was 41 kJ mol − 1, a value similar to that of isoprene SOA. The laboratory SOA yield measured in this study was found to be 0. 7 % in MBO/H 2 O 2 for an aerosol mass of 33 μg m − 3. Time profiles and proposed reaction schemes are provided for selected compounds. The contribution of SOA products from MBO oxidation to ambient PM 2. 5 was investigated by analyzing a series of ambient PM 2. 5 samples collected in several places around the United States. In addition to the occurrence of several organic compounds in both field and laboratory samples, DHIP was found to originate only from the oxidation of MBO, and therefore this compound could serve as a tracer for MBO SOA. Initial attempts have been made to quantify the concentrations of DHIP and other compounds based on surrogate compound calibrations. The average concentrations of DHIP in ambient PM 2. 5 samples from Duke Forest, NC ranged from zero during cold seasons in areas with low MBO emission rates to approximately 1 ng m − 3 during warm seasons in areas with high MBO emission rates. This appears to be the first time that DHIP has been detected in ambient PM 2. 5 samples. The occurrence of several other compounds in both laboratory and field samples suggests that SOA originating from MBO can contribute under selected ambient conditions to the ambient aerosol mainly in areas where MBO emissions are high...|$|R
