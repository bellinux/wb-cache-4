Technical success, ablation duration time, overall procedure time and safety were registered. To define the shape of the ablation zone, multiplanar reformatting (MPR) was performed.

The cartilage canals were always present in the calcaneum by 78 mm CR length. The calcaneum has two primary ossification centres. The main centre was identified in the deep part of the calcaneum as a <b>spherical</b> <b>zone</b> of cartilage cells in the proliferative phase between 82 and 120 mm CR length and in the hypertrophic phase between 130 - 156 mm. Numerous cartilage canals entered the calcaneum from its dorsal and ventral surfaces and, between 106 and 156 mm CR length, they formed vascular arcades around this centre. Between 165 and 175 mm, calcification and marrow space formation were noted involving branches from the adjoining cartilage canals within these areas, which provided vascular osteogenic tissue to the early spaces. The inconstant parachondral centre, when present, may appear first during the fourth month as a periosteal reaction on the inferolateral side in the anterior wall of a deep groove {{in front of the}} posterior tuberosity of the calcaneum. By 120 mm CR length, a thin layer of subperiosteal bone was present along with a zone of early hypertrophic cartilage cells deep to it.

40|$|SUMMARY Fifty-three grafted {{keratoconus}} corneas chosen {{at random}} from several hundred operated upon over a 10 -year period showed {{an increase in}} myopia after removal of sutures but a decrease in astigmatism. With the photoelectrokeratograph machine the <b>spherical</b> <b>zone</b> was shown {{to be limited to}} 3 mm with gross eccentricities. Half the patients chose to wear contact lenses after surgery and 10 % had no correction. Contact lens wearers showed a much greater decrease in astigmatism than spectacle wearers. The treatment of keratoconus by keratoplasty would be ideal if the curvatures of the donor graft resulted in an emmetropic eye. But for several reasons this is rarely possible. The chief reasons given are light transmission defects of the graft tissue or irregulari-ties in curvature of the donor corneal surface. Analysis of curvatures even suggested to previous workers that keratoconus recurs in the grafted eye. It will not be {{the purpose of this paper}} to discuss light transmission problems, which are chiefly concerned with endothelial survival and function, or the several problems that iesult in opacities, either partial or total, of the graft. The latter are usually associated with either inflammatory reactions of healing or immunological reactions. The various aspects of graft size, shape, and suturing techniques have been dealt with by several workers. The conclusions so far are that, while size and shape may alter the final curvature (Ruben, 1972; Troutman and Meltzer, 1972; Troutman, 1973), the reasons why they do so are not fully known. According to Ruben (1972) the relationship between average keratometry and size was related to graft size; thus the large grafts resulted in overall flatter curvatures. Recent work by Davies et al. (1976) disputes a statistical relationship between number of sutures but favours more the tension present in sutures. Indeed, it is well known that the tension, when released on removal of sutures even one-and-a-half years after grafting, results in sudden changes of graft curvatures. This has led some surgeons to leave graft sutures of 10 - 0 Perlon i...|$|E

40|$|Two {{years ago}} it was {{reported}} that polonium (Po) radiohalos were still “a very tiny mystery. ” 1 Since then, extensive research into the geological occurrence and distribution of Po, uranium (U) and thorium (Th) radiohalos has been undertaken as part of the RATE project, 2 so now there are some preliminary results to report that are both significant and exciting. What are Radiohalos? Radiohalos are minute <b>spherical</b> <b>zones</b> of discoloration surrounding tiny mineral crystals included in larger host mineral grains in certain rocks, particularly granites. Alpha-particles produced by radioactive decay of U, Th, and their decay products (including Po) in the tiny mineral inclusions (often zircons) penetrate the surrounding host minerals (often the dark mica, biotite) damaging their crystal lattices. Because the α-particles emitted by the different radionuclides in the U and Th decay chains have different energies, they travel different distances. Where the α-particles stop they do the most damage, resulting in spherical shells of intense discoloration, which are concentric ring structures when the rocks are studied in thin (cross) sections. Therefore, it is possible to identify which radionuclides were responsible for producing the observed radiohalos. There are three Po radionuclides in the 238 U decay chain — 218 Po, 214 Po and 210 Po. All decay very rapidly and so have very short half-lives— 3. 1 minutes, 164 micro-seconds and 138 days respectively. Thus the occurrence in granitic rocks of 218 Po, 214 Po, and 210 Po radiohalos, exhibiting only the rings produced by these Po radionuclides because only these respective radionuclides were present in the radiocenters when the radiohalos formed (figure 1), has been interpreted as indicating instantaneous formation of both the Po radiohalos and the granitic rocks. 3 U and Th radiohalos are not without significance either. Dark, fully-formed U and Th radiohalos are estimated to have required around 100 million years worth of radioactive decay at today’s rates to have formed, 4 so their presenc...|$|R
40|$|Agent-based {{models have}} shown that local {{interactions}} between identical agents can, through self-organizational processes, give rise to patterns at a group level that resemble those in animal groups, such as mocking birds or schooling and milling fish. Flocking or schooling is achieved in most models by surrounding the individuals with behavioral (response) zones which induce the individual to avoid agents that are close-by, align with those at mid-range and are attracted to others that are further away. Previous models {{have shown that}} circular (2 D) and spherical (3 D) behavioral zones give rise to elongated schools. There are, however, physiological indications that circular or <b>spherical</b> behavioral <b>zones</b> do not accurately reflect the sensory capabilities of real fish. In addition, the width-height ratios of schools brought about by <b>spherical</b> behavioral <b>zones</b> do not suficiently resemble empirical measurements of real fish schools. The present study investigates the effects on school shape and structure of differently shaped behavioral zones in a model of schooling fish. It {{was found that the}} school shape in general adopts the shape of the behavioral zone and is additionally influenced by group size and density of the schools. School structure is expressed in terms of the position of the nearest neighbors with respect to the individuals. For stronger attraction the positions of the nearest neighbors are mainly determined by the individuals' blind angle, whereas for weaker attraction the nearest neighbors are most often found at position where the behavioral zones are smallest. Furthermore, this study explains how these spatial structures emerge through measurements of the direction and magnitude of the repulsion and attraction forces experienced by the individuals. This study is the first to show schools with realistic school structures, i. e. angles towards positions of the nearest neighbors, and school shapes that resemble empirical data in all three dimensions. The schools which most resemble those of real fish result from behavioral zones which extend less in the vertical direction. This might indicate that fish respond more to, or can more easily perceive, conspecifics swimming on the movement plane. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract-The {{problem of}} a spherical cavity which is {{embedded}} in a linear, fluid-infiltrated, elastic porous medium and which is subjected to the sudden quasi-static application of a stress at the cavity boundary is solved. It is demonstrated that the deformation of the cavity is homogeneous regardless of the boundary condition imposed on the pore fluid at the cavity wall. For the {{case in which the}} pore pressure vanishes at the cavity wall, the time dependence of the cavity strain is evaluated explicitly and is shown to vary between the limits of the ordinary linear elastic response based on the short-time (undrained) and on the long-time (drained) properties of the fluid-saturated solid.

Such properties are achieved due to a heat treatment of solubilization, quenching and aging, in order to precipitate metastables phases, which act as dislocation obstacles, increasing {{the strength of the}} alloy. In the present study, the precipitation sequence of Al- 8 %Ag alloy was analyzed via Vickers hardness and Transmission Electron Microscopy.

It was observed that this hardness value does not compete with others well known alloys, like AA 6061 and AA 2024, which can be precipitation hardened. The main reason for the low values of HVN, is because of there is no enough difference between the matrix and the precipitated particles lattice parameters, and don’t cause a significant elastic strain by coherence in the matrix lattice, that could produce a substantial hardening. To ascertain this assumption, the aged material was severely plastic deformed, achieving 94 HVN, and the grain refinement and high dislocations density were the major hardening mechanisms, since the precipitates behavior was similar as the matrix, because particles were distorted instead of acting as impediment to material flow...|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of locating a buried vertical magnetic dipole source (horizontal loop) from surface {{measurements of the}} vertical and horizontal magnetic field components has been investigated by Wait (1971)., For sufficiently low frequencies, the magnetic fields have a simple static-like behavior, and a single observation of the ratio and relative phases of the vertical and horizontal field components is sufficient for location when the earth is homogeneous. However, when inhomogenieties are present, the surface fields will be modified, and source location may be more difficult. In order to obtain a quantitative idea of the surface field modifications, we consider a <b>spherical</b> conducting <b>zone</b> as a perturbation to the homo- geneous half-space. A rigorous solution for the buried sphere problem has been formulated by D'Yakanov (1959). Unfortunately, his solution is restricted to azimuthally symmetric excitation, and even then the solution {{is not in a}} convenient computational form. However, if the sphere is electrically small and is located at a sufficient distance from both the dipole source and the interface, the scattered fields can be identified as the secondary fields of induced dipole moments. The latter are equal to the product of the incident fields and the polarizabilities of the sphere. The details of the approach are given by Hill and Wait (1973). Wait (1968) has used this induced dipole moment approach for scattering by a small sphere above a conducting half-space. The method has the advantage that it is easily generalized to scatterers of other shapes for which both the electric and magnetic polarizabilities are known, such as spheroids (Van de Hulst, 1957) ...|$|R
