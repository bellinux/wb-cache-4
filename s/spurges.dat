25|$|Hawkmoths {{also occur}} on the island. One of the more notable species is Hyles tithymali which feeds on endemic <b>spurges</b> such as Euphorbia regis-jubae. Acherontia atropos, the deaths-head hawkmoth also occurs on the island presumably feeding on members of the Solanaceae, for example, Datura innoxia and Nicotiana glauca which are common weeds in the {{vicinity}} of human habitation.|$|E
25|$|Its last refuge was {{dominated}} by endemic Guettarda insularis, Ilex socorroensis and Sideroxylon socorrense, as well as black cherry (Prunus serotina), Ficus cotinifolia fig trees and Psidium socorrense guavas, apparently all native on Socorro. At least {{at the time of}} the last record, it seemed to be dependent on intact understorey of Euphorbiaceae (<b>spurges</b> and relatives) and ferns, maybe because cats hunt less efficiently in these dense tangles. It is frugivorous and, as is often the case in Columbidae, might have played an important role in the reproduction of the trees which dominate its habitat. One of these (S. socorrense) is classified as vulnerable by the IUCN. In particular, it was found to associate with the fig trees.|$|E

25|$|Many {{other plants}} produce forms of latex rich in {{isoprene}} polymers, {{though not all}} produce usable forms of polymer as easily as the Pará. Some of them require more elaborate processing to produce anything like usable rubber, and most {{are more difficult to}} tap. Some produce other desirable materials, for example gutta-percha (Palaquium gutta) and chicle from Manilkara species. Others that have been commercially exploited, or at least showed promise as rubber sources, include the rubber fig (Ficus elastica), Panama rubber tree (Castilla elastica), various <b>spurges</b> (Euphorbia spp.), lettuce (Lactuca species), the related Scorzonera tau-saghyz, various Taraxacum species, including common dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) and Russian dandelion (Taraxacum kok-saghyz), and perhaps most importantly for its hypoallergenic properties, guayule (Parthenium argentatum). The term gum rubber is sometimes applied to the tree-obtained version of natural rubber in order to distinguish it from the synthetic version.|$|E
500|$|Leaving Oldbridge, the Way {{follows the}} road for {{approximately}} [...] before turning onto a boreen. To {{the left of the}} boreen is Wart Stone Field, so called on account of a bullaun stone that lies in the field, water from which is said to cure warts. The boreen ends at Brusher Gap, reputed to be a place where locals left food and supplies for Michael Dwyer and his followers when they went on the run after the 1798 Rebellion. The Way enters Drummin forest, a sitka spruce plantation, where it passes an Adirondack shelter, constructed by Mountain , a volunteer group dedicated to trail preservation that has upgraded various sections of the Wicklow Way over the years. The trail climbs Paddock Hill before descending into a plantation of larch trees. The forest floor here is a habitat for <b>spurges,</b> heath bedstraw and fly agaric toadstools. The trail crosses the Military Road, near Laragh, and then a wooden footbridge across the Glenmacnass River. A dense spread of granite boulders litters the riverbed, glacial erratics deposited by melting glaciers {{at the end of the}} last ice age. This stretch of the trail follows an old mass path through a woodland of many native Irish tree species, including oak, rowan, silver birch and willow, carpeted with a forest floor of bilberry, bluebell and hard fern. The Way continues along forest tracks over the shoulder of Brockagh Mountain. At the highest point there is a vista over the Vale of Glendalough with the two lakes nestled in the shelter of Camaderry and Derrybawn Mountains. Exiting the forest, the Way reaches the R756 road and the Glendalough visitor centre. Crossing the Glendasan River, it passes the remains of the Monastic City, founded in the 6th century by Saint Kevin.|$|E

60|$|In India, for example, {{there are}} no cactuses. But I wouldn't advise you to dispute the point with a peppery, fire-eating Anglo-Indian colonel. I did so once, myself, {{at the risk of}} my life, at a table d'hôte on the Continent; and the wonder is that I'm still alive to tell the story. I had nothing but facts on my side, while the colonel had fists, and {{probably}} pistols. And when I say no cactuses, I mean, of course, no indigenous species; for prickly pears and epiphyllums may naturally be planted by the hand of man anywhere. But what people take for thickets of cactus in the Indian jungle are really thickets of cactus-like <b>spurges.</b> In the dry soil of India, many <b>spurges</b> grow thick and succulent, learn to suppress their leaves, and assume the bizarre forms and quaint jointed appearance of the true cactuses. In flower and fruit, however, they are euphorbias to the end; {{it is only in the}} thick and fleshy stem that they resemble their nobler and more beautiful Western rivals. No true cactus grows truly wild anywhere on earth except in America. The family was developed there, and, till man transplanted it, never succeeded in gaining a foothold elsewhere. Essentially tropical in type, it was provided with no means of dispersing its seeds across the enormous expanse of intervening ocean which separated its habitat from the sister continents.|$|E
60|$|True cactuses (in {{the native}} state) are {{confined}} to America; but the unhappy naturalist who ventures to say so in mixed society is sure to get sat upon (without due cause) by numberless people who have seen 'the cactus' wild all the world over. For one thing, the prickly pear {{and a few other}} common American species, have been naturalised and run wild throughout North Africa, the Mediterranean shores, and a great part of India, Arabia, and Persia. But what is more interesting and more confusing still, other desert plants which are not cactuses, living in South Africa, Sind, Rajputana, and elsewhere unspecified, have been driven by the nature of their circumstances and the dryness of the soil to adopt precisely the same tactics, and therefore unconsciously to mimic or imitate the cactus tribe in the minutest details of their personal appearance. Most of these fallacious pseudo-cactuses are really <b>spurges</b> or euphorbias by family. They resemble the true Mexican type in externals only; that is to say, their stems are thick, jointed, and leaf-like, and they grow with clumsy and awkward angularity; but in the flower, fruit, seed, and in short in all structural peculiarities whatsoever, they differ utterly from the genuine cactus, and closely resemble all their spurge relations. Adaptive likenesses of this sort, due to mere stress of local conditions, have no more weight as indications of real relationship than the wings of the bat or the nippers of the seal, which don't make the one into a skylark, or the other into a mackerel.|$|E

60|$|On {{the other}} hand, it seems {{pretty clear that}} certain plants have {{efficiently}} armed themselves against the aphides, in turn, by secreting bitter or otherwise unpleasant juices. So far as I can discover, the little plunderers seldom touch the pungent 'nasturtiums' or tropsælums of our flower-gardens, even when these grow {{side by side with}} other plants on which the aphides are swarming. Often, indeed, I find winged forms upon the leaf-stem of a nasturtium, having come there evidently in hopes of starting a new colony; but usually in a dead or dying condition--the pungent juice seems to have poisoned them. So, too, spinach and lettuce may be covered with blight, while the bitter <b>spurges,</b> the woolly-leaved arabis, and the strong-scented thyme close by are utterly untouched. Plants seem to have acquired all these devices, such as close networks of hair upon the leaves, strong essences, bitter or pungent juices, and poisonous principles, mainly as deterrents for insect enemies, of which caterpillars and plant-lice are by far the most destructive. It would be unpardonable, of course, to write about honey-dew without mentioning tobacco; and I may add parenthetically that aphides are determined anti-tobacconists, nicotine, in fact, being a deadly poison to them. Smoking with tobacco, or sprinkling with tobacco-water, are familiar modes of getting rid of the unwelcome intruders in gardens. Doubtless this peculiar property of the tobacco plant has been developed as a prophylactic against insect enemies: and if so, we may perhaps owe the weed itself, as a smokable leaf, to the little aphides. Granting this hypothetical connection, the name of honey-dew would indeed be a peculiarly appropriate one. I may mention in passing that tobacco is quite fatal to almost all insects, a fact which I present gratuitously to the blowers of counterblasts, who are at liberty to make whatever use they choose of it. Quassia and aloes are also well-known preventives of fly or blight in gardens.|$|E
60|$|So we rode on {{and up the}} hills, by {{green and}} flowery paths, with {{here and there a}} cottage and a garden, and groups of {{enormous}} Palmistes towering over the tree-tops in every glen, talking over that wondrous weed, whose head we saw still far below. For weed it is, and nothing more. The wood is soft and almost useless, save for firing; and the tree itself, botanists tell us, is neither more nor less than a gigantic Spurge, the cousin-german of the milky garden weeds with which boys burn away their warts. But if the modern theory be true, that when we speak (as we are forced to speak) of the relationships of plants, we use no metaphor, but state an actual fact; that the groups into which we are forced to arrange them indicate not merely similarity of type, but community of descent-- then how wonderful is the kindred between the Spurge and the Hura-- indeed, between {{all the members of the}} Euphorbiaceous group, so fantastically various in outward form; so abundant, often huge, in the Tropics, while in our remote northern island their only representatives are a few weedy <b>Spurges,</b> two Dog's Mercuries--weeds likewise--and the Box. Wonderful it is if only these last have had the same parentage--still more if they have had the same parentage, too, with forms so utterly different from them as the prickly- stemmed scarlet-flowered Euphorbia common in our hothouses; as the huge succulent cactus-like Euphorbia of the Canary Islands; as the gale-like Phyllanthus; the many-formed Crotons, which in the West Indies alone comprise, according to Griesbach, at least twelve genera and thirty species; the hemp-like Maniocs, Physic-nuts, Castor-oils; the scarlet Poinsettia which adorns dinner-tables in winter; the pretty little pink and yellow Dalechampia, now common in hothouses; the Manchineel, with its glossy poplar-like leaves; and this very Hura, with leaves still more like a poplar, and a fruit which differs from most of its family in having not three but many divisions, usually a multiple of three up to fifteen; a fruit which it is difficult to obtain, even where the tree is plentiful: for hanging at the end of long branches, it bursts when ripe with a crack like a pistol, scattering its seeds far and wide: from whence its name of Hura crepitans.|$|E

40|$|Sodium {{chlorate}} {{has proved}} {{the most effective}} herbicide for the eradication of leafy <b>spurge.</b> The following formula is effective when applied as a spray: Sodium chlorate, 1 pound; animal glue, 4 grams; sulfuric acid, 3 cubic centimeters; water, 1 gallon. The best kill was obtained when the chlorate solution was sprayed on actively growing plants in full foliage. In northwestern Iowa, sodium chlorate sprayed on the aerial parts has given better and more consistent results than when applied dry, directly to the soil. The highest percentage of kill of leafy <b>spurge</b> through sodium chlorate was produced when the spray was applied {{the latter part of}} May or when the plant was about to come into blossom. The second spray, applied the latter part of August or before killing frost, usually completed the eradication of leafy <b>spurge.</b> Sodium chlorate has proved more effective in killing leafy <b>spurge</b> when treated in small grain or millet than where growing alone. Leafy <b>spurge</b> was eliminated in a large pasture by spraying with sodium chlorate, the first application being made the latter part of May and the second the latter part of August. Pound for pound, the old Atlacide on the market in 1930 - 33 apparently was not as effective in killing leafy <b>spurge</b> as sodium chlorate. Dilute sulfuric acid and C. -K. (creosote-kerosene) killed the tops of leafy <b>spurge</b> with little injury to the roots. Heavy applications of ammonium thiocyanate may prove valuable as a herbicide for leafy <b>spurge.</b> Potassium chlorate was about as effective in eradicating leafy <b>spurge</b> as sodium chlorate. Residual soil effect was greater for potassium chlorate than for sodium chlorate. To insure complete elimination of leafy <b>spurge</b> by spraying with sodium chlorate, 2 years are necessary. Two applications the first year will destroy most of the <b>spurge.</b> Remaining plants must be given two treatments the second year. Kainite, a fertilizer, will exterminate leafy <b>spurge</b> when heavy applications are made. Applications of well rotted manure (3 tons to the square rod) were effective against leafy <b>spurge.</b> Straw had no effect. Plowing leafy <b>spurge</b> deeply (7 - 8 inches) in the fall and again in the spring materially reduced the amount of leafy <b>spurge.</b> Millet, sorghum and soybeans drilled in heavily about the middle of June after the ground had been plowed and fallowed proved to be good crops for infested areas of leafy <b>spurge.</b> Reduction in leafy <b>spurge</b> population is greater if the land is plowed the preceding fall and again the following spring, and cultivated until the smother crop is planted. Fallowing for 2 years, by cultivating 30 times each year from June 1 until Oct. 1, completely destroyed leafy <b>spurge.</b> A program of eradication with growing competitive crops may be shortened by giving leafy <b>spurge</b> one application of sodium chlorate the previous fall, shortly before killing frost. Leafy <b>spurge</b> population in corn was not reduced by four cultivations. Surface cultivation in corn following regular cultivation did not prove to be an effective procedure in eradicating leafy <b>spurge.</b> Alfalfa did not compete successfully with leafy <b>spurge.</b> Alfalfa was tolerant to sodium chlorate and may be used on ground where the leafy <b>spurge</b> has been killed with sodium chlorate or Atlacide. Barley was sensitive to sodium chlorate in the soil; soybeans are less tolerant than barley or oats...|$|R

5000|$|The milky sap of <b>spurges</b> (called [...] "latex") {{evolved as}} a {{deterrent}} to herbivores. It is white, and transparent when dry, except in E. abdelkuri, where it is yellow. The pressurized sap seeps from the slightest wound and congeals after a few minutes in air. The skin-irritating and caustic effects are largely caused by varying amounts of diterpenes. Triterpenes such as betulin and corresponding esters are other major components of the latex. In contact with mucous membranes (eyes, nose, mouth), the latex can produce extremely painful inflammation. Therefore, <b>spurges</b> should be handled with caution and kept away from children and pets. Latex on skin should be washed off immediately and thoroughly. Congealed latex is insoluble in water, but can be removed with an emulsifier such as milk or soap. A physician should be consulted if inflammation occurs, as severe eye damage including permanent blindness may result from exposure to the sap. When large succulent <b>spurges</b> in a greenhouse are cut, vapours can cause irritation to the eyes and throat several metres away. Precautions, including sufficient ventilation, are required.|$|E

40|$|Three {{flea beetle}} species (Aphthona spp.), first {{introduced}} into North America in 1988, {{have come to}} be regarded as effective biological control organisms for leafy <b>spurge</b> (Euphorbia esula). The black flea beetles (Aphthona lacertosa and A. czwalinae) in particular have been shown to cause reductions in leafy <b>spurge</b> stem counts in the northern Great Plains, while the brown flea beetle (A. nigriscutis) has persisted and spread, but has not been found to be as effective at controlling leafy <b>spurge.</b> The ability of black flea beetles to control leafy <b>spurge</b> in any given year, however, has been found to vary. To better understand the long-term effects of flea beetle herbivory on leafy <b>spurge,</b> we monitored stem counts of leafy <b>spurge</b> and numbers of black and brown flea beetles at three sites on two National Wildlife Refuges in east-central North Dakota, USA, from 1998 to 2006. Brown flea beetle numbers were observed to be negligible on these sites. Over the 9 years of the study, black flea beetles were seen to spread over the three study sites and leafy <b>spurge</b> stem counts declined substantially on two of the three sites. Even at low densities of <b>spurge,</b> black flea beetle populations persisted, a necessary prerequisite for long-term control. We used structural equation models (SEM) to assess the yearly effects of black flea beetles, soil texture, and refuge site on leafy <b>spurge</b> stem counts over this time period. We then used equations developed from the SEM analysis to explore flea beetle–leafy <b>spurge</b> dynamics over time, after controlling for soil texture and refuge. Yearly effect strength of black flea beetles on leafy <b>spurge</b> was found to be modest, largely owing to substantial spatial variability in control. However, simulation results based on prediction coefficients revealed leafy <b>spurge</b> to be highly responsive to increases in flea beetle populations on average...|$|R
