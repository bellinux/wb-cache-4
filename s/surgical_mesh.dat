40|$|Infection of <b>surgical</b> <b>meshes</b> used in {{abdominal}} wall reconstructions {{often leads to}} removal of the implant and increases patient morbidity due to repetitive operations and hospital administrations. Treatment with antibiotics is ineffective due to the biofilm mode of growth of the infecting bacteria and bears the risk of inducing antibiotic resistance. Hence {{there is a need}} for alternative methods to prevent and treat mesh infection. Nitric oxide (NO) -releasing coatings have been demonstrated to possess bactericidal properties in vitro. It is the aim of this study to assess possible benefits of a low concentration NO-releasing carbon-based coating on monofilament polypropylene meshes with respect to infection control in vitro and in vivo. When applied on <b>surgical</b> <b>meshes,</b> NO-releasing coatings showed significant bactericidal effect on in vitro biofilms of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and CNS.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{study the}} {{influence}} of morphology of <b>surgical</b> <b>meshes</b> on the course of bacterial infection under {{the influence of}} the host immune system in an in vivo chronic bacterial infection model. BACKGROUND: The use of prosthetic meshes has increased dramatically the last decades in abdominal wall reconstructive surgery. Whereas infection is becoming a more frequent complication, attention is increasingly drawn to the influence of the surgeon's mesh choice on the course of this complication. METHODS: Samples of 6 often applied <b>surgical</b> <b>meshes</b> were contaminated with a bioluminescent strain of Staphylococcus aureus and implanted subcutaneously in an immunocompetent BALB/c mouse. The intensity and the spreading of bioluminescence (ie, p/s/cm/sr) were analyzed non-invasively in vivo during a 10 -day follow-up period. RESULTS: Over the course of infection, multifilament polypropylene and hydrophobic materials showed a significantly higher persistence of bacteria as well as spreading of infection compared to all other meshes. In contrast, infection resolved in almost all animals with a low-weight polyester mesh. CONCLUSION: The results of this study are in accordance with circumstantial evidence from limited clinical reports on infection involving <b>surgical</b> <b>meshes</b> and suggest that multifilament and hydrophobic meshes significantly increase bacterial persistence or spreading in the infected area in contrast to monofilament polypropylene and lightweight meshes. Therefore, the surgeon should consider this outcome when choosing a mesh graft for limiting infection in abdominal wall repair...|$|R

50|$|The primary {{function}} of <b>surgical</b> <b>mesh</b> {{is to support}} prolapsed organs either temporarily or permanently. It is most commonly used in hernia surgery within the abdomen, which is required when an organ protrudes through abdominal muscles. <b>Surgical</b> <b>mesh</b> may {{also be used for}} pelvic or vaginal wall reconstructions in women and is implemented to add as a growth guide for damaged tissue.

40|$|Background: Prosthetic meshes are {{increasingly}} popular in abdominal wall reconstructive surgery owing {{to a reduction}} in hernia recurrence rate. Individual meshes have been evaluated with respect to the formation of infectious biofilms, but no comprehensive comparison yet exists. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of the material and morphology of <b>surgical</b> <b>meshes</b> on biofilm growth. Methods: Biofilms of a coagulase-negative staphylococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were grown in vitro on different meshes. Intact biofilms were stained fluorescently and evaluated with confocal laser scanning microscopy to distinguish dead from live bacteria and slime. Results: Numbers of adhering bacteria and the amount of slime in the biofilm were dependent on the morphology of the mesh. Hydrophobicity and the presence of niches in multifilament meshes contributed most to increased biofilm growth. Conclusion: The morphological properties of <b>surgical</b> <b>meshes</b> as well as their hydrophobicity influence bacterial growth and slime production. Differences in slime production may explain why the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment varies for different types of mesh...|$|R

50|$|Hernia {{surgery is}} one of the most common current {{applications}} of <b>surgical</b> <b>mesh.</b> Hernias occur when organs or fatty tissue bulge through openings or debilitated areas of muscle, usually in the abdominal wall. <b>Surgical</b> <b>mesh</b> is implanted to strengthen tissue repair and minimize the rate of recurrence. The surgery can be performed laparoscopic (internally) or open with a variety of materials available for prosthesis. Polypropylene (PP) is the most frequently used type of mesh, although it may be uncomfortable for the patient after implantation. Another type that is less utilized in hernia surgery is polyethylene-terephtalat (PET), which faces complications in that fact that it easily degrades after some years of implantation, erasing the effects of the surgery. Polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) is used as well, but is manufactured in the form of a foil and has difficulty integrating into surrounding tissue, therefore it loses stability.|$|E

40|$|Female urinary {{incontinence}} and pelvic organ prolapse are common conditions. The {{aim of this}} study was to assess the biomechanical properties of raw meshes commonly used in pelvic floor surgery, particularly the effects of cyclical loading on these meshes. The material properties of nine different types of <b>surgical</b> <b>meshes</b> were examined using uniaxial tensile tests. The strength and extensibility of the mesh designs differed considerably. Most mesh types exhibited curvilinear loading curves. Cyclical loading of mesh samples produced significant permanent deformation in all mesh designs. This non-recoverable extension ranged from about 8. 5 % to 19 % strain. Hysteresis also varied considerably between materials from 30 % to 85 %. All mesh groups tested for their biomechanical properties displayed differences in results for failure load, stiffness, non-recoverable extension and hysteresis...|$|R
50|$|The vaginal wall {{has three}} layers: tunica mucosa, muscularis, adventitia. When {{prolapse}} occurs, smooth fibers of the muscularis are compromised. Prolapse in women {{has also been}} seen to increase stiffness in the pelvis, particularly post-menopausal women. <b>Surgical</b> <b>mesh</b> that is used in pelvic reconstruction must counter this stiffness, but if the modulus of elasticity is too high, it will not sufficiently support the organs. On the contrary, if the mesh is too stiff, tissue will erode and inflammatory responses will cause post-surgical complications.|$|E

5000|$|The idea {{of using}} organic {{materials}} for <b>surgical</b> <b>mesh</b> {{has been around since}} at least the late 1950s, though researchers soon learned the materials they tested weren't biocompatible. Research into more compatible biomaterials occurred in the proceeding decades, including the search for cellular-based materials extracted from humans and animals. For example, in 1980, research presented at the first ever World Biomaterials Congress detailed the examined use of dermal collagen of sheep to construct biological mesh for reconstructive surgery. Since then, [...] "research for developing and improvising the biological material required for the production of these meshes" [...] has been ongoing.|$|E
40|$|An {{animal model}} {{that allows for}} {{assessment}} {{of the degree of}} stretching or contraction of the implant area and the in vivo degradation properties of biological meshes is required to evaluate their performance in vivo. Adult New Zealand rabbits underwent full thickness subtotal unilateral rectus abdominis muscle excision and were reconstructed with the non-biodegradable Peri-Guard®, Prolene® or biodegradable Surgisis® meshes. Following 8 [*]weeks of recovery, the anterior abdominal wall tissue samples were collected for measurement of the implant dimensions. The Peri-Guard and Prolene meshes showed a slight and obvious shrinkage, respectively, whereas the Surgisis mesh showed stretching, resulting in hernia formation. Surgisis meshes showed in vivo biodegradation and increased collagen formation. This surgical rabbit model for abdominal wall defects is advantageous for evaluating the in vivo behaviour of <b>surgical</b> <b>meshes.</b> Implant area stretching and shrinkage were detected corresponding to mesh properties, and histological analysis and stereological methods supported these findings...|$|R
40|$|The {{consequences}} of a biomaterial associated infection will generally follow a disastrous pattern regarding the subjected patient. In modern times post operative complications following abdominal wall reconstructive surgery are reduced to a minimum which, consequently, {{will result in a}} more prone position for infection as a complication. Present studies suggest wide ranges of infection rates depending on the mesh morphology. This thesis presents a new experimental method to systematically investigate the progress of mesh related infections using non-invasive bio-optical techniques. A significant reduction of animals was seen. Comparative research showed significant differences in decease progress as a result of mesh morphology. In addition, using bio-optical imaging the number of animals was significantly reduced. In future perspective, the results presented in this thesis will lead to improvements of <b>surgical</b> <b>meshes</b> and the currently presented experimental set-up could be used as an efficient and standardized evaluation protocol. ...|$|R
30|$|Varied {{scaffold}} chemistries {{suggest the}} ability to decrease the expression of M 1 macrophages. Microgel conformational coatings formed from poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAm) and poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) reduce fibrinogen adsorption, macrophage adhesion, macrophage spreading, and secretion of inflammatory cytokines [124]. Zwitterionic hydrogels are able to reduce protein adsorption and are characterized by anti-inflammatory, pro-healing macrophages that promote angiogenesis and show {{no evidence of a}} collagenous capsule for longer than three months [125]. The ability of macrophages to induce positive tissue remodeling on fourteen different biologically-derived <b>surgical</b> <b>meshes</b> was investigated, and suggested that a predominance of M 2 macrophages could potentially lead to more constructive tissue remodeling after two weeks [23]. Sugisis and Matristem scaffolds – derived from porcine small intestinal submucosa, and urinary bladder, respectively – appeared to increase macrophage infiltration; whereas the other scaffolds, derived from human and porcine dermis, appeared to prolong the healing response and exhibited an increase in M 1 -like macrophages [23].|$|R
50|$|Laparoscopic incisional {{hernia repair}} {{is a new}} method of surgery for this condition. The {{operation}} is performed using surgical microscopes and specialized instruments. The <b>surgical</b> <b>mesh</b> is placed into the abdomen underneath the abdominal muscles through small incisions {{to the side of}} the hernia. In this manner, the weakened tissue of the original hernia is never re-incised to perform the repair, and one can minimize the potential for wound complications such as infections. In addition, performance of the operation through smaller incisions can make the operation less painful and speed recovery. Laparoscopic repair has been demonstrated to be safe and a more resilient repair than open incisional hernia repair.|$|E
50|$|Knowing this, {{the current}} {{problem with a}} variety of the meshes used in all types of {{surgeries}} is that they are not sufficiently biocompatible. PP proves an effective mesh for adjusting prolapsed organs, but may cause severe discomfort for the patient due to its low modulus of elasticity. This stiffens the prosthesis and results in a more pronounced inflammatory response, which complicates integration into the body with tissue ingrowth. As previously mentioned, PET too easily degrades in vivo and tissue has a difficult time integrating with PTFE. For these reasons, researchers are beginning to look for different types of <b>surgical</b> <b>mesh</b> that may be suitable for the biological environment and provide better comfort while supporting prolapsed organs.|$|E
50|$|Inflammatory {{responses}} to mesh insertion promote tissue formation around mesh fibers and proliferation of fibroblasts, polymorphonucleocytes, and macrophages, which all {{aid in the}} integration of mesh. Failures to resolve inflammatory responses may lead to foreign body reactions and the ultimate encapsulation of the implant which negates any functional purpose that the implant was supposed to serve. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are known to reduce inflammatory responses which, when combined with <b>surgical</b> <b>mesh,</b> could prevent them from getting uncontrollable and too difficult to tame. MSCs combined with surgical meshes {{can be used as}} “off the shelf” products and enhance macrophage polarization in both in vivo and in vitro environments. This can encourage an anti-inflammatory response and can regulate the inflammatory reaction associated with mesh implantation.|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} activity performed is {{addressed to the}} evaluation of the interaction phenomena between <b>surgical</b> <b>meshes</b> and native biological tissues and structures, with the aim to assess the biomechanical compatibility, which represents a mandatory factor for successful adoptions in different surgical procedures. The mechanical characterization of meshes for repairs is performed by means of an integrated experimental-numerical approach, in direct correlation with the surgical techniques. Surgical grafts can origin from different sources and they can be classified as synthetic or biological, characterized by peculiar biochemical and mechanical properties and, consequently, by different biomechanical performances. Biological grafts are derived from collagen-rich tissues and can be drawn from animal (xenografts) or human (allograft) sources, the latter are usually obtained from the fascial system. For this reason, the mechanical characterization of fascial tissues is performed, evaluating the in situ functional role in the interaction with surrounding biological structures. With the purpose to interpret fascial tissues mechanical behaviour, which is characterized by anisotropy, coupled geometric and material non-linearity and time-dependent phenomena, a specific fiber reinforced visco-hyperelastic model is provided. The constitutive parameters evaluation is performed through the minimization of a cost function that defines the discrepancy between experimental data and results from the model of the tensile tests. The optimization technique, based on the Simulated Annealing optimization algorithm, leads to the definition of the set of constitutive parameters to be adopted within the constitutive formulation and implemented in the model, with the purpose to achieve a suitable description of tissue in situ mechanical behaviour. The preliminary phase of fascial tissues performances is investigated through numerical analysis of the anterior compartment of the leg. The response in this region allow for a definition of the characteristic facial tissues behaviour and is of clinical interest in the several painful syndrome, as the compartment syndrome, also offering the possibility of several references in literature. As an example of xenograft, Permacol ™ is characterized through experimental analysis and constitutive modelling. It is derived from decellularized and cross-linked porcine skin and it is a graft commonly used in abdominal wall surgery. As far as synthetic meshes is concerned, Bard® Soft mesh is studied, as a lightweight, large pore monofilament polypropylene mesh, following the above mentioned procedure. The mechanical investigation of different kinds of <b>surgical</b> <b>meshes</b> is fundamental for the definition of the numerical model of the herniated and repaired human abdominal wall. The reconstruction of the abdominal region is based on MR images integrated with data from literature. Constitutive formulations of the different biological tissues of the anatomical region are provided. The numerical model allows the analysis of different configurations, firstly considering the healthy abdomen to assess its overall mechanical behaviour in physiological conditions. Then a hernia defect is introduced in the abdominal wall, with size and position defined in accordance with clinical evidences, virtually repaired by means of different kinds of grafts (biologic and synthetic). The purpose is to evaluate the mechanical interaction between native abdominal wall tissues and structures and <b>surgical</b> <b>meshes,</b> to assess the mechanical functional response and compatibility. The analysis allows the comparison between physiological and pathological conditions and between different kinds of meshes, by means of the estimation of the stress and strain fields within biological tissues and prosthesis. Attention is paid to the interaction at tissue-implant interface, providing a useful computational tool for the evaluation of surgical strategies in dependence on prosthesis configuration. The investigation entails a relevant experimental effort, essential for the extensive numerical analysis of the anatomical district considered, providing a result evaluation by direct correlation with surgical competences. ...|$|R
40|$|Hernia repair {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{operations}} in general surgery, and its associated complications typically relate to infections, among others. The loading of antibiotics to <b>surgical</b> <b>meshes</b> to deliver them locally in the abdominal hernia repair site can be one way to manage infections associated with surgical implants. However, the amount of drug loaded is restricted by the low wettability of polypropylene (PP). In this work, plasma has been used to tailor the surface properties of PP meshes to obtain high loading of ampicillin while conserving the desired biological properties of the unmodified samples and conferring them with antibacterial activity. It was demonstrated that the new surface chemistry and improved wettability led to 3 -fold higher antibiotic loading. Subsequently, a PEG-like dry coating was deposited from tetraglyme with low-pressure plasma which allowed maintaining the high drug loading and kept cell properties such as chemotaxis, adhesion and morphology to the same levels as the untreated ones which have shown long-standing clinical success.

Eight different types of mesh: Atrium, Dexon, Gynemesh, IVS tape, Prolene, SPARC tape, TVT tape and Vypro II, were implanted into the abdominal walls of rats for 3 months 2 ̆ 7 duration. Explanted meshes were assessed, using light microscopy, for parameters of rejection and incorporation. Type 1 (Atrium, Gynemesh, Prolene, SPARC and TVT) and type 3 (Vypro II, Dexon and IVS) meshes demonstrated different biocompatible properties. Inflammatory cellular response and fibrosis at the interface of mesh and host tissue was most marked with Vypro II and IVS. All type 1 meshes displayed similar cellular responses despite markedly different mesh architecture. The inflammatory response and fibrous reaction in the non-absorbable type 3 meshes tested (IVS and Vypro II) was more marked than the type 1 meshes. The increased inflammatory and fibrotic response may be because of the multifilamentous polypropylene components of these meshes. Material and filament composition of mesh is the main factor in determining cellular response...|$|R

Biologic mesh is primarily indicated for several types of hernia repair, including inguinal and ventral hernias, hernia prophylaxis, and contaminated hernia repairs. However, it has also been used in pelvic floor dysfunction, parotidectomy, and reconstructive plastic surgery. The development of biologic mesh largely has derived from the need of a biocompatible material that addresses [...] "the problems associated with a permanent synthetic mesh, including chronic inflammation, foreign body reaction, fibrosis, and mesh infection."

Safety and efficacy of many newer meshes is unknown. The use of a transvaginal mesh in treating vaginal prolapses is associated with side effects including pain, infection, and organ perforation.

50|$|Of these meshes, {{the most}} important, Ethicon’s Gynecare Prolift, was {{introduced}} in March 2005.

However, in 2008, the FDA issued a Public Health Notification regarding reports of serious complications associated with transvaginal mesh devices. This further escalated when, in 2011, the agency received more than 1,000 adverse effect reports from <b>surgical</b> <b>mesh</b> manufacturers. The FDA decided to order Ethicon and other transvaginal mesh manufacturers to cease production until extensive testing and research on each of vaginal mesh device was conducted.

30|$|Silver {{nanoparticles}} {{are used}} in bone cements that are used as artificial joint replacements. Polymethyl methacrylate loaded with nanosilver is being considered as bone cement as the nanosilver can induce antimicrobial activity[69]. Ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene has been the preferred choice for fabricating inserts for total joint replacement components, but it is susceptible to wear and tear which is a major drawback. To overcome this, silver nanoparticles were added, {{and the presence of}} silver nanoparticles drastically reduced the wear and tear of the polymer[70]. The currently used methods to prevent surgical infection include antibiotics and antiseptics. <b>Surgical</b> <b>meshes</b> are used to bridge large wounds and for tissue repairs. Though these meshes are effective, they are susceptible to microbial infections. Silver nanoparticle-coated polypropylene mesh is said to have good antimicrobial activity and can be considered an ideal candidate for surgical meshes[71]. The antimicrobial property of silver nanoparticles is documented, and it has immense potential to be used in disinfectants[72]. It is also believed that most medical treatments such as intravenous catheters, endotracheal tubes, wound dressings, bone cements, and dental fillings can all make use of nanosilver to prevent microbial infections.|$|R

An ambispective observational study involving 90 patients was conducted with retrospective chart review and prospective subjective and objective assessments at the end of a 1 -year study period. Apart from 2 of 90 (2. 2 %) minor hematoma incidents, there was no other major perioperative morbidity. Prevalence of common prolapse complaints of vaginal lump sensation, constipation, defecation difficulty and dyspareunia all improved significantly postoperatively (p< 0. 001). Surgical correction was achieved in 27 of 31 (83. 9 %) at 6 months and beyond. There was no mesh infection but minor vaginal mesh protrusion was found in 7 of 90 (7. 8 %) patients at 6 – 12 weeks and 4 of 31 (12. 9 %) patients at 6 months and beyond.

30|$|Furthermore, silver {{nanoparticles}} {{are also}} applied in nano-crystalline dressings for the therapy of wound or hospital-acquired infections, minimizing the inflammatory response (Fong and Wood 2006). For instance, the classical <b>surgical</b> <b>meshes</b> {{are used to}} bridge severe wounds and for tissue therapy, but it is highly vulnerable to pathogenic invasions. Thus, {{the effectiveness of these}} meshes is enhanced with the impregnation with silver nanoparticles. With the plasmonic properties of silver nanoparticles, it can be widely applied in bio-imaging for monitoring dynamic events {{over an extended period of}} time without undergoing photo-bleaching as compared to common fluorescent dyes. Therefore, the conjugation of cells to the target cells leads to the conversion of light energy to thermal energy and then resulted in thermal ablation of the target cells, aiding in destroying unwanted or damaged cells (Loo et al. 2005). In addition, the plasmonic properties of silver nanoparticles can be exploited for bio-sensing, which can effectively detect wide ranging of proteins that typical biosensors do not. With this unique capability, silver nanoparticles are broadly employed for detecting various abnormalities and diseases in human body system, e.g., tumor cells or cancer. The plasmonic properties of silver nanoparticles are somehow dependent on its size, shape, and the dielectric potential of surrounding medium (Morley et al. 2007).|$|R
