The {{incident}} <b>wave,</b> the <b>scattering</b> <b>waves</b> {{in the host}} and the transmitted waves in the elastic spheres are all expanded in the series form of spherical wave functions. The total waves are obtained by addition of all <b>scattered</b> <b>waves</b> from individual elastic sphere. The addition theorem of spherical wave function is used to perform the coordinates transform for the <b>scattering</b> <b>waves</b> from different spheres. The expansion coefficients of <b>scattering</b> <b>waves</b> {{are determined by the}} interface condition between the elastic spheres and the solid host. The scattering cross section is computed as numerical examples...|$|R

40|$|As more {{resources}} are directed toward reverse time migration, an accurate velocity model, including strong reflectors, {{is necessary to}} form a clear image of the subsurface. This is of particular importance {{in the vicinity of}} salt, where singly <b>scattered</b> <b>waves</b> are often not ideal for imaging the salt flanks. This has led to interest in processing doubly <b>scattered</b> <b>waves</b> (also called duplex or prismatic waves) for imaging salt flanks and thus improving the location of salt boundaries in a velocity model. We used doubly <b>scattered</b> <b>waves</b> in a two-pass, one-way method to image salt flanks in a North Sea data set. By working in the one-way framework we were able to separately construct images with singly, doubly, and triply <b>scattered</b> <b>waves.</b> We used a multistep imaging process that includes multiply <b>scattered</b> <b>waves</b> by using an imaged reflector to fix one (or more) of the scattering points, allowing for multiply scattered energy from several reflectors, potentially with poor continuity, to be included without picking each reflector individually. With this method we were able to image the flank of a North Sea salt body...|$|R
40|$|Reverse-time {{migration}} is a two-way time-domain finite-frequency technique that accurately handles {{the propagation of}} complex <b>scattered</b> <b>waves</b> and pro-duces a band-limited representation of the subsurface structure that is conven-tionally assumed to be linear in the model parameters. Because of this underly-ing linear single-scattering assumption, most implementations of this method do not satisfy energy conservation and do not optimally use illumination and model sensitivity of multiply <b>scattered</b> <b>waves.</b> Migrating multiply <b>scattered</b> <b>waves</b> re-quires preserving the nonlinear relation between image and model parameters. I modify the extrapolation of source and receiver wavefields to more accurately handle multiply <b>scattered</b> <b>waves.</b> I extend {{the concept of the}} imaging condi-tion in order to map into the subsurface structurally coherent seismic events that correspond to the interaction of both singly and multiply <b>scattered</b> <b>waves.</b> This results in an imaging process here referred to as nonlinear reverse-time migration. It includes a strategy that analyzes separated contributions of singly and multiply <b>scattered</b> <b>waves</b> to the final nonlinear image. The goal is to pro-vide a tool suitable for seismic interpretation and potentially migration velocity analysis that benefits from increased illumination and sensitivity from multiply <b>scattered</b> seismic <b>waves.</b> It is noteworthy that this method applies to migrating internal multiples, a clear advantage for imaging challenging complex subsur-face features, e. g., in salt and basalt environments.
