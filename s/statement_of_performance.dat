In his defining <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> theory, [...] "Our center is in the interaction between readers and texts which enriches, extends, clarifies, and (yes) alters the interior and even the exterior lives of students performers and audiences through the power of texts" [...] (Literature in Performance, Vol 5 No 1, 1984; p. 84). In addition, Robert Breen's text Chamber Theatre is a cornerstone in the field for staging narrative texts, though it remains controversial in its assertions about the place of narrative details in chamber productions. Breen is also regarded by many as a founding theorist for the discipline, along with advocate Louise Rosenblatt. More recently, performance theorist and novelist Barbara Browning has suggested that narrative fiction itself - and particularly the novel - demands the performative participation of the reader.|$|E

40|$|Despite analysts' {{demands for}} (and {{standard}} setters' preferences for) a single statement of comprehensive income, both the IASB and the FASB {{have not been}} able to achieve this objective. Proponents of a single statement presentation argue that comprehensive income brings discipline to managers and analysts as it requires them to consider all factors affecting owners' wealth. Opponents argue that other comprehensive income items are transitory in nature, including them with core business earnings increases the volatility and reduces the predictive power of earnings. Thus, this thesis examines the volatility, value relevance and predictive power of comprehensive income relative to net income. Motivated by the concerns that the volatility of comprehensive income leads to the perception of increased risk, this thesis investigates the volatility and risk relevance of comprehensive income for a sample of non-financial United States (US) and New Zealand (NZ) firms. The findings show that comprehensive income is more volatile than net income. The findings also show that comprehensive income volatility is associated with market-based measures of risk (volatility of stock returns and beta). However, the incremental volatility of comprehensive income (over net income) is not associated with market risk and is not priced. Prior literature documents mixed evidence on the pricing of comprehensive income. The mixed results are attributed to the use of as if measures of comprehensive income, which introduces measurement error. This thesis uses as reported data from US and NZ firms and shows that comprehensive income is more value relevant compared to net income. However, net income is a better measure for predicting future operating cash flows and future net income. These results have important implications for the FASB/IASB in deciding whether to report comprehensive income in a single <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance...</b>|$|E

Moreover, performance expectations for the assessment materials and the learning activities were general and open to interpretation. There was no progression of difficulty evident or specified for selections within the units, and readability ratings provided for the selections in two of the programs did not distinguish appropriateness for use in grades seven, eight, or nine. The third program specified selections and thematic units for each of grades seven, eight, and nine. However, within each grade level no progression of difficulty was specified for the selections within units or across units in the program. Although it was suggested that reading strategies such as predicting or scanning be used with particular selections, no explicit instruction guidance was provided on text structure knowledge, or reading strategies, two areas identified in the research as distinguishing proficient readers from less proficient readers.

This project allowed State Public Utility Commissioners and their staffs to engage on the most cutting-edge level in the arenas of energy assurance and electricity policy. Four tasks were outlined in the <b>Statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>Performance</b> Objectives: Task 1 - Training for Commissions on Critical Infrastructure Topics; Task 2 - Analyze and Implement Recommendations on Energy Assurance Issues; Task 3 - Ongoing liaison activities & outreach to build stronger networks between federal agencies and state regulators; and Task 4 - Additional Activities. Although four tasks were prescribed, in practice these tasks were carried out under two major activity areas: the critical infrastructure and energy assurance partnership with the US Department of Energy's Infrastructure Security and Emergency Response office, and the National Council on Electricity Policy, a collaborative which since 1994 has brought together State and Federal policymakers to address the most pressing issues facing the grid from restructuring to smart grid implementation. On Critical Infrastructure protection, this cooperative agreement helped State officials yield several important advances. The lead role on NARUC's side was played by our Committee on Critical Infrastructure Protection. Key lessons learned in this arena include the following: (1) Tabletops and exercises work - They improve the capacity of policymakers and their industry counterparts to face the most challenging energy emergencies, and thereby equip these actors with the capacity to face everything up to that point as well. (2) Information sharing is critical - Connecting people who need information with people who have information is a key success factor. However, exposure of critical infrastructure information to bad actors also creates new vulnerabilities. (3) Tensions exist between the transparency-driven basis of regulatory activity and the information-protection requirements of asset protection. (4) Coordination between states is a key success factor - Because comparatively little federal authority exists over electricity and other energy infrastructure, the interstate nature of these energy grids defy centralized command and control governance. Patchwork responses are a risk when addressed at a state-by-state level. Coordination is the key to ensuring consistent response to shared threats. In Electricity Policy, the National Council on Electricity Policy continued to make important strides forward. Coordinated electricity policy among States remains the best surrogate for an absent national electricity policy. In every area from energy efficiency to clean coal, State policies are driving the country's electricity policy, and regional responses to climate change, infrastructure planning, market operation, and new technology deployment depend on a forum for bringing the States together...|$|E

40|$|Abstract]: This paper {{reports on}} the results of a case study {{investigating}} the response of New Zealand schools to the legislative requirement to prepare service performance reports. To date, the ongoing failure to successfully establish service performance reporting in schools suggests further research is warranted. Prime facie, it was expected that schools would find the output and outcome distinction underlying the Ministry of Education’s procedural guidelines difficult to apply. However, the case study findings support this expectation to a surprising extent. Schools do not apply the output/outcome distinction to their choice of objectives because they include only activities that are easy to measure in their <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> service <b>performance.</b> Objectives are then designed to fit these activities. In this sense, schools adopt a historical and arbitrary methodology to service performance reporting whilst government policy assumes a forward looking and purposeful approach. The research findings also suggest that schools do not prepare <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> service <b>performance</b> in the way intended by the reporting framework because they question its applicability and relevance. Participants expressed concerns with the language used in service performance reporting because it is informed by terminology which they perceive to be associated with commercial enterprises. Schools felt this model was incongruous with the educational environment. Overall, the research suggests that schools are not prepared to devote sufficient time and resources to developing adequate reports <b>of</b> service <b>performance.</b> If, as appears to be case, “service performance reports are [expected to be] forged in the field, by the public entities required to produce them” (Thompson, 1995, p. 337) then service performance reporting in the school sector seems destined to remain a controversial and problematic issue for both the schools and the New Zealand government...|$|R

40|$|Human {{resource}} costs {{comprise a}} significant proportion of New Zealand government departments' operating expenditure, thus, reporting on these resources is important. Yet, to date, a practical alternative to the monetary valuation and reporting of human resources has still to be found. This thesis examines the usefulness and practicality of reporting non-monetary human resource information in government departments' <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> service <b>performance.</b> The examination was conducted through a mail questionnaire sent to all 39 government departments, with a response rate of 87 % (34 questionnaires out of 39 sent) being achieved. Personal interviews were then conducted with two of the respondents. The majority (84 %) of government department financial controllers believed it was necessary to report non-monetary human resource information. A <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> service <b>performance</b> (SSP) received 61 % support as the method of disclosure, followed by a <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> resources (48 %), a separate human resource report (45 %), and a chief executive's report (42 %). There was considerable support for the disclosure in the SSP of several items of human resource information as either inputs, outputs or outcomes. A number of costs and benefits were also identified by respondents as resulting from the disclosure of human resource information in the SSP. However, when comparing the overall costs and benefits, the majority of respondents did not expect such reporting to be cost effective. These results indicate that, although there is support in theory for reporting non-monetary human resource information in government departments' SSPs, further research is necessary to determine the practicality of such reporting. The results of this thesis have extended the literature concerning disclosure of human resource information. Many costs and benefits associated with the provision of monetary human resource information have been found to apply to the reporting of non-monetary human resource information. Furthermore, many of the non-monetary human resource measures suggested for the private sector were found to be applicable to public sector organisations, specifically New Zealand government departments...|$|R
