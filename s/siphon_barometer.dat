5000|$|A <b>siphon</b> <b>barometer</b> is {{the term}} {{sometimes}} applied to the simplest of mercury barometers. A continuous U-shaped tube of the same diameter throughout is sealed on one end and filled with mercury. When placed into the upright, [...] "U", position, mercury will flow away from the sealed end, forming a partial vacuum, until balanced by atmospheric pressure on the other end. The term [...] "siphon" [...] derives from the belief that air pressure {{is involved in the}} operation of a siphon. The difference in height of the fluid between the two arms of the U-shaped tube {{is the same as the}} maximum intermediate height of a siphon. When used to measure pressures other than atmospheric pressure, a <b>siphon</b> <b>barometer</b> is sometimes called a siphon gauge; these are not siphons but follow a standard 'U'-shaped design leading to the term. Siphon barometers are still produced as precision instruments. Siphon barometers should not be confused with a siphon rain gauge., ...|$|E
