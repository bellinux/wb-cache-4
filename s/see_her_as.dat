5|$|Isabeau was {{dismissed}} by historians as a wanton, weak and indecisive leader. Modern historians now <b>see</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> taking an unusually active leadership role for a queen of her period, {{forced to take}} responsibility {{as a direct result}} of Charles' illness. Her critics accepted skewed interpretations of her role in the negotiations with England, resulting in the Treaty of Troyes, and in the rumors of her marital infidelity with Orléans. Gibbons writes that a queen's duty was to secure the succession to the crown and look after her husband; historians described Isabeau as having failed in both respects, and she came to be seen as one of the great villains of history. Gibbons goes on to say that even her physical appearance is uncertain; depictions of her vary depending on whether she was to be portrayed as good or evil.|$|E
5|$|Teenager Billy Duncan {{wakes up}} in his bed, {{seemingly}} disturbed, and learns his mother is leaving for vacation. He goes to visit his girlfriend Kathy, but her deranged grandfather Colonel Farley makes him leave before he can <b>see</b> <b>her.</b> <b>As</b> Billy drives around town, he is harassed by bullies Chuck Boran and Froggy, and by two police deputies who give him a speeding ticket. Billy wanders into the desert and discovers the laser cannon and pendant. He starts playing with the cannon, pretending to shoot things, then realizes he can fire the weapon while wearing the pendant. Meanwhile, on the alien spacecraft, the two aliens converse with their leader who shows them footage of Billy using the cannon, prompting the aliens to turn their ship around {{to head back to}} Earth. Context implies that the two aliens, upon departing Earth, left the cannon and pendant behind under the presumption that no other human would be able to use them as the green-skinned man had, but they have now learned that they were in error.|$|E
5|$|The poems {{were written}} during {{a short period}} while the poet lived in Germany. Although they {{individually}} deal {{with a variety of}} themes, as a series they focus on the poet's longing for the company of his friend Coleridge, who had stayed in England, and on his increasing impatience with his sister Dorothy, who had travelled with him abroad. Wordsworth examines the poet's unrequited love for the idealised character of Lucy, an English girl who has died young. The idea of her death weighs heavily on the poet throughout the series, imbuing it with a melancholic, elegiac tone. Whether Lucy was based on a real woman or was a figment of the poet's imagination has long been a matter of debate among scholars. Generally reticent about the poems, Wordsworth never revealed the details of her origin or identity. Some scholars speculate that Lucy is based on his sister Dorothy, while others <b>see</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> a fictitious or hybrid character. Most critics agree that she is essentially a literary device upon whom he could project, meditate and reflect.|$|E

25|$|Frances Burney's {{early career}} was deeply {{affected}} by {{her relationship with}} her father, and by the critical attentions of their family friend Samuel Crisp. Both encouraged her writing, but also employed their influence in a critical fashion, dissuading her from publishing or performing her dramatic comedies because they felt that working in the genre was inappropriate for a lady. Many feminist critics thus <b>see</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> an author whose natural talent for satire was somewhat stifled by the social pressures exerted on female authors of the age. But Burney persisted in writing despite the setbacks. When her comedies were poorly received, she returned to novel writing, and later tried her hand at tragedy. She supported both herself and her family with the proceeds of her later novels, Camilla and The Wanderer.|$|E

On Carter and Stark's relationship moving into the second season, Atwell said, [...] "there’s a new comfort level between Stark and Peggy ... they’re on a bit more of an even level. She respects him hugely, but is also not afraid to comment on his lifestyle choices and how disgustingly misogynistic she finds him ... he does use women as a form of escapism for him and his Dionysian ways, but when it comes to Peggy, he doesn’t <b>see</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> big boobs and red lips. He sees her as someone he can actually have a proper conversation with. Which probably scares the hell out of him".|$|E

500|$|Hoping {{to write}} a song that would {{successfully}} [...] "portray [...] {{in a world that}} is so protected and safe", Ashman and Menken drew inspiration from a story-telling style that is often reserved for traditional operettas. As Beauty and the Beasts opening number, [...] "Belle", a [...] "pivotal moment...in the narrative", plays a significant role in the film by introducing both the film's heroine, Belle, after whom the song is named, and Gaston, the film's villain. While Belle, a book-loving and intelligent nonconformist who has grown frustrated with her predictable village life, longs for an adventure similar to the ones she reads about in her books, Gaston is a narcissistic hunter who seeks her hand in marriage.
