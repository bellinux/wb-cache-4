500|$|The speech Big Gay Al gave {{while taking}} Stan {{on a boat}} ride through his animal {{sanctuary}} were based on actual speeches animation director Eric Stough made {{while working as a}} [...] "jungle cruise director" [...] at the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida. The dirt smudges on the football player's helmets and uniforms were intentionally designed to look like smudges on construction paper. This was done to maintain the show's deliberately crude visual style they first created with construction paper in [...] "The Spirit of Christmas" [...] and the pilot episode, [...] "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe". The characters Butters Stotch and Clyde Donovan are featured during the football game, although neither had been identified by name yet in the series. During a football crowd scene, a white character can be seen that looks identical to Token Black, an African-American character introduced later in the series. The background character is wearing the same shirt Token wears, which Parker explained was the result of an animator placing a different head on the body {{in order to create a}} filler character for the crowd. The moment when Big Gay Al says, [...] "My work here is done" [...] and disappears into a suitcase is Stone's favorite part of the episode, even though he admitted, [...] "It makes no sense". Parker said that the moment was written that way simply because the duo could not decide how to [...] "get rid of" [...] the character. Parker said, [...] "We didn't want him around all the time, (<b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>asked)</b> how do we not make him a character each week".|$|E

5000|$|The album {{represents}} a drastic change in style from their previous album, Ascendancy, adopting a mostly thrash metal sound, and having metalcore {{characteristics such as}} breakdowns and growled vocals featured in metalcore kept to a very small minimum. As a result, vocalist Matt Heafy used a clean vocal style similar to James Hetfield {{throughout most of the}} record. Heafy justified this by noting that [...] "the four of us were never into bands that scream and we don't like any of the current bands that scream, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> ourselves why we're doing it." [...] However, growled vocals would return as a regular attribute on the band's proceeding album, Shogun as well as sometimes some breakdowns.|$|E

50|$|He {{asks us to}} then {{consider}} the attribution of a belief. We are seeking a good scientific theory of amorous relations. <b>We</b> <b>ask</b> ourselves if Thomas, who has recently been betrayed by his girlfriend Ffion, believes {{that it is possible}} that the relationship can continue. The way we can find out the answer to this question is simply by asking Thomas if he believes it is possible. Thomas says no. Does this authorize us to attribute to Thomas the belief that the relationship cannot continue? Of course not, since Thomas is probably angry and confuses his desire to break up with Ffion with his beliefs. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>ask</b> him if he is angry with Ffion. He says that he is, but we cannot attribute to him the belief that the relationship can continue, because we don't really know if he's confusing his desires with his beliefs or vice versa. <b>So</b> now <b>we</b> <b>ask</b> Thomas if he will still retain the same opinion next month. Thomas pauses for a while and then says yes. At this point, we think we have a definitive confirmation of the fact that Thomas believes that the relation must be interrupted, since he reflected on the matter before answering. Just to be sure, <b>we</b> <b>ask</b> him what came to mind during that interval of reflection. Thomas answers that he thought of all the unhappy incidents between that took place between him and Ffion. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> return to our original hypothesis on the basis that Thomas is angry and therefore confuses his desires and his beliefs.|$|R
