The main objective of the first experiment was to compare reproductive performance of ewes bred naturally to those bred by artificial insemination. Semen for artificial insemination was collected by either artificial vagina or electroejaculation and stored for up to 36 hours at 5 degrees C. A second objective was to evaluate the effect of pregnant mares' <b>serum</b> <b>gonadotrophin</b> on the reproductive performance of ewes synchronized for estrus.

40|$|Pregnant mare <b>serum</b> <b>gonadotrophin</b> (PMSG) {{was found}} to stimulate the {{production}} of cyclic AMP in isolated rat seminiferous tubule cells. The PMSG was equipotent with highly purified ovine FSH. The subunits of PMSG were inactive in this system but recombination resulted in partial restoration of activity, and the combination of PMSG =asubunit with FSH =bsubunitwas even more active. Desialation of PMSG, but not of ovine FSH, resulted in a reduction of slope and potency of this response, suggesting that sialic acid may be important for the interaction of PMSG and the Sertoli cell.

40|$|It is {{generally}} assumed that an injection of <b>serum</b> <b>gonadotrophin</b> stimulates the secretion of gonadotrophin in the immature rat since the ovarian response in intact rats is greater than, and qualitatively different from, that in hypophysectomized rats.

40|$|Based on the {{findings}} of close links between intermittent hypothalamic releasing hormone stimulation and hypophyseal gonadotrophin response, an assessment of the pulsatility of <b>serum</b> <b>gonadotrophins</b> may represent a feasible way to indirectly evaluate central regulatory processes in humans. Since ovarian steroid feedback is virtually absent in hypo-gonadal women, their luteinizing hormone (LH) pulsatility may represent the unrestrained LH pulse rhythm at its max-imal rate. Relative changes in the LH pulse characteristics during the menstrual cycle could then be referred to this basic pulsatility. Hence, LH pulse frequencies increase during cycle periods of high sex steroid exposure, but this increase is limited to the LH periodicities found in hypogonadal women. Furthermore, LH pulse amplitudes are successively enhanced from the follicular to the luteal phase of the cycle yet they never exceed those found in hypogonadal subjects. In addition, circadian excursions subserve pulsatile LH secretion during all periods of the menstrual cycle, although the character of these circadian rhythmicities differs from that observed in the LH secretory profiles of hypogonadal women. Thus, albeit profoundly modulated by ovarian sex steroid feedback during the menstrual cycle, LH pulsatility and its circadian variations in women during the menstrual cycle is confined to the ultradian and circadian LH secretory patterns of the hypogonadal state.

In this study, we aimed to examine the pattern of secretion of LH and FSH from a series of pituitary adenomas cultured in vitro and where data were available to relate the results to pre-operative <b>serum</b> <b>gonadotrophin</b> levels. Methods: The in vitro secretion of LH and FSH was measured from 46 cultured NFPAs and compared with pre-operative <b>serum</b> <b>gonadotrophin</b> levels in 38 patients. Peri-tumorous ‘normal ’ pituitary cell cultures from 20 additional pituitary tumour patients were used for comparison with the NFPA group. Results: A median pre-operative LH:FSH ratio of 0. 33 : 1 was found in 38 patients with NFPAs. Preferential secretion of FSH was also documented from media of 46 NFPAs cultured in vitro with a median LH:FSH ratio of 0. 32 : 1. A significant correlation (r 0. 43, P, 0. 01) was observed between serum and media levels of FSH but not LH. Peri-tumorous ‘normal ’ pituitary cells released LH and FSH in a reversed ratio (median LH:FSH ratio 3. 6 : 1, P, 0. 01 compared with NFPAs). Conclusions: This study has evaluated pre-operative <b>serum</b> <b>gonadotrophin</b> levels and in vitro release of hormones in cultures of surgically removed tissue from patients with NFPAs. The data suggest preferential secretion of FSH occurs both in vitro and in vivo. By demonstrating that NFPAs cultured in vitro reflect the in vivo situation of preferential secretion of FSH, it may be possible in future to perform functional studies using this system to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the development of an imbalance in gonadotroph cells preferentially overproducing FSH in NFPAs.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The study aim was {{to assess}} whether the {{incorporation}} of myo-inositol (MI) into culture medium could improve oocyte maturation in vitro. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a controlled prospective study using female ICR strain mice superovulated with pregnant mare's <b>serum</b> <b>gonadotrophins.</b> Cumulus-enclosed germinal vesicle (GV) oocytes were randomly cultured in medium with or without MI supplementation. The kinetics of GV breakdown after 4 h of incubation was signi®cantly higher in oocytes incubated with 30 mmol/l of MI than in controls (P < 0. 001). Accordingly, this concentration of MI was used for subsequent experiments. The proportion of metaphase II oocytes achieved after 24 h of culture, their fertilization and cleavage rates were signi®cantly higher in the MI-treated group (P < 0. 01, P < 0. 05, P < 0. 05 respectively). This group also demonstrated signi®cant improve-ment in postimplantation development after transferring the 2 -cell embryos to pseudopregnant mice. Confocal microscopy revealed spontaneous intracellular Ca 2 + oscillations within competent GV oocytes and treatment with MI caused an earlier onset of these Ca 2 + signals. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that MI may affect meiotic progression of mouse GV oocytes possibly by enhancing the intracellular Ca 2 + oscillations.

40|$|Ten {{patients}} with advanced progressive adenocarcinoma {{of the prostate}} were treated with a long acting analogue of gonadotrophin releasing hormone. Eight of these patients responded to treatment in terms of pain relief and clinical regression of tumour. <b>Serum</b> <b>gonadotrophin</b> and testosterone concentrations were significantly suppressed {{by the end of}} the second week of treatment, testosterone concentrations being comparable with those achieved by castration. The two patients who failed to respond had both relapsed previously when receiving conventional treatment, and neither showed any endocrine response to the analogue. Superagonists of gonadotrophin releasing hormone may be the treatment of choice in adenocarcinoma of the prostate, but further trials are required to establish long term safety and efficacy...|$|E
40|$|Mature Suffolk ewes {{were either}} {{actively}} or passively immunized against the synthetic fragment of porcine inhibin alpha, pIα(1 - 30),to {{determine the effects}} on gonadotrophin secretion and ovulation rate. Thirteen control ewes were immunized against human serum albumin, 12 ewes were actively immunized against pIα(1 - 30) and 36 ewes were passively immunized with pIα(1 - 30) antiserum. Blood samples were collected at 4 -h intervals for 72 h from oestrus-synchronized ewes following {{the withdrawal of the}} progestagen pessaries. Mean gonadotrophin concentrations measured during the oestrous cycle of control ewes, ewes actively immunized against pIα(1 - 30) and ewes passively immunized against pIα(1 - 30) were similar, but their secretory profiles differed. Serum concentrations of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) were highest in ewes which had received antiserum at the time of pessary withdrawal; FSH concentrations did not decrease during the follicular phase of the oestrous cycle in ewes given antiserum 24 h after pessary withdrawal. Subtle but significant increments in serum FSH concentrations were observed in all passively immunized ewes in which sampling commenced at the time of treatment. The amplitude of the preovulatory luteinizing hormone (LH) peak, but not of the FSH peak, and the postovulatory secondary rise in FSH were lower (P 3 ̆c 0 · 05) in actively immunized ewes than in control ewes. The mean (±s. e.) ovulation rate for actively immunized ewes (6 · 6 ± 1 · 0) was 3 times higher (P 3 ̆c 0 · 05) than that for control ewes (2 · 0 ± 0 · 2),but was unaffected by passive immunization (range, 1 · 8 - 2 · 3). The divergent results involving <b>serum</b> <b>gonadotrophins</b> and ovulation rate following active or passive immunization to the same pIα(1 - 30) immunogen suggest that changes in circulating gonadotrophins alone may not account for the increased ovulation rate in immunized Suffolk ewes...|$|R
40|$|Background: Myxedema coma is {{the extreme}} manifestation of hypothyroidism, {{typically}} seen {{in patients with}} severe biochemical hypothyroidism. Its occurrence in association with subclinical hypothyroidism is extremely unusual. We describe a patient with subclinical hypothyroidism who developed clinical manifestations of myxedema coma. Summary: A 47 -year-old woman presented to our endocrine clinic with complaints of fatigue and biochemical findings of subclinical hypothyroidism. She was started on treatment with thyroxine (T 4) but remained unwell and was later admitted to hospital with hormone profile showing persisting subclinical hypothyroidism (elevated thyrotropin and normal free T 4 [FT 4] and free triiodothyronine [FT 3]) : FT 4 10. 7 [*]pmol/L (reference range 10. 3 – 24. 5), FT 3 2. 7 [*]pmol/L (reference range 2. 67 – 7. 03), and thyrotropin 6. 09 [*]mU/L (reference range 0. 4 – 4. 0). She subsequently developed hypothermia (temperature 33. 2 °C), circulatory collapse, and coma. Biochemical profile showed hyponatremia, elevated creatinine phosphokinase, metabolic acidosis, and renal failure. An echocardiogram revealed a moderate-sized pericardial effusion. We diagnosed myxedema coma and started treatment with intravenous T 3. She responded dramatically with improvement in level of consciousness and normalization of metabolic parameters. We found no explanation other than hypothyroidism {{to account for the}} presentation. Adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) stimulation tests excluded adrenal insufficiency, and <b>serum</b> <b>gonadotrophins</b> were within the normal reference range. FT 4 estimation by equilibrium dialysis excluded analytical interference, and molecular analysis for the thyroid hormone receptor β gene associated with thyroid hormone resistance was negative. Conclusions: To {{the best of our knowledge}} this is the first report of myxedema coma in a patient with subclinical hypothyroidism. The reason for normal thyroid hormone levels is unclear but may reflect deviation from a higher pre-morbid set-point. The case highlights the importance of careful clinical evaluation in patients with disparate clinical and laboratory findings...|$|R
40|$|Background: Benign prostatic {{hyperplasia}} (BPH) {{develops in}} elderly males when serum androgens are relatively {{lower than in}} healthy younger males, {{but it is not}} well understood whether and how sex steroids are altered in prostatic hyperplasia. It is also uncertain whether there is any change in sex steroid levels in males older than 40 years of age. The use of androgens in elderly males is often discouraged because of the probable worsening effect of androgens on prostatism. This study aimed to determine the relationship between prostatic hyperplasia and sex steroid levels and whether there is any significant change in these hormones after the age of 40 years. Subjects and Methods: We studied healthy males of age 240 years with (n= 92) or without (n= 93) clinical prostatic hyperplasia. <b>Serum</b> testosterone, estradiol, <b>gonadotrophins</b> and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) were compared. The hormones and SHBG were also correlated with age. Results: No significant difference was found in any hormone in cases with prostatic hyperplasia as compared with the controls. There was no significant age-related change in any hormone except estradiol where as a negative correlation (P&# 60;. 003) with age was found. Conclusions: Serum sex steroids and SHBG remained unchanged in symptomatic prostatic hyperplasia and except for estradiol there was no significant age-related change in <b>serum</b> testosterone, <b>gonadotrophins</b> and SHBG in healthy males after the fourth decade. More studies are needed to confirm the age-related decline of estrogens in males...|$|R
