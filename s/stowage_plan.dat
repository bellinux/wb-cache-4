40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the problem of determining <b>stowage</b> <b>plans</b> for containers into ships having to visit a given number of ports in their circular route. The problem is denoted Multi-Port Master Bay Plan Problem (MP-MBPP) In practice, the MP-MBPP consists in determining how to stow a given set of containers, split into different groups, according to their size, type, class of weight and destination, into bay locations, either on the deck or in the stow. Some structural and operational constraints, related to the containers, the ship and the maritime terminals, have to be satisﬁed. The single port MBPP is a NP-hard optimization problem, and has been proposed in the literature from 2001.

40|$|Abstract — Stowage {{planning}} for container vessels concerns the core competence of the shipping lines. As such, automated stowage planning has attracted much {{research in the}} past two decades, but with few documented successes. In an ongoing project, we are developing a prototype stowage planning system aiming for large containerships. The system consists of three modules: the <b>stowage</b> <b>plan</b> generator, the stability adjustment module, and the optimization engine. This paper mainly focuses on the stability adjustment module. The objective of the stability adjustment module is to check the global ship stability of the <b>stowage</b> <b>plan</b> produced by the <b>stowage</b> <b>plan</b> generator and resolve the stability issues by applying a heuristic algorithm to search for alternative feasible locations for containers that violate some of the stability criteria.

40|$|Since {{the start}} of the {{containerization}} revolution in 1950 's, not only the TEU capacity of the vessels has been increasing constantly, but also the number of fully cellular container ships has expanded substantially. Because of the tense competition among ports in recent years, improving the operational efficiency of ports has become an important issue in containership operations. Arrangement of containers both within the container terminal and on the containership {{play an important role in}} determining the berthing time. The berthing time of a containership is mainly composed of the unloading and loading time of containers. Containers in a containership are stored in stacks, making a container directly accessible only if it is on the top of one stack. The task of determining a good container arrangement to minimize the number of re-handlings while maintaining the ship's stability over several ports is called <b>stowage</b> <b>planning,</b> which is an everyday problem solved by ship planners. The horizontal distribution of the containers over the bays affects crane utilization and overall ship berthing time. In order to increase the terminal productivity and reduce the turnaround time, the <b>stowage</b> <b>planning</b> must conform to the berth design. Given the configuration of berths and cranes at each visiting port, the <b>stowage</b> <b>planning</b> must take into account the utilization of quay cranes as well as the reduction of unnecessary shifts to minimize the total time at all ports over the voyage. This dissertation introduces an optimization model to solve the <b>stowage</b> <b>planning</b> problem with crane utilization considerations. The optimization model covers a wide range of operational and structural constraints for containership load planning. In order to solve real-size problems, a meta-heuristic approach based on genetic algorithms is designed and implemented which embeds a crane split approximation routine. The genetic encoding is ultra-compact and represents grouping, sorting and assignment strategies that might be applied to form the stowage pattern. The evaluation procedure accounts for technical specification of the cranes as well as the crane split. Numerical results show that timely solution for ultra large size containerships can be obtained under different scenarios...|$|R

40|$|Stowage {{planning}} for container ships is a core activity of shipping lines. As {{the size of}} containership increases, generating a <b>stowage</b> <b>plan</b> with good safety and stability for a large containership becomes increasingly difficult.

This paper focuses on the safety and stability adjustment module which resolves the stability issues of a <b>stowage</b> <b>plan</b> by adjusting the distribution of container weights by stowing containers in alternative feasible locations and fine-tuning stability parameters through adjusting the ballast in tanks onboard.

Naval Research Logistics, 62 (7), pp. 564 - 581., which has been published in final form at [URL] This article {{may be used for}} non-commercial purposes in accordance with Wiley Terms and Conditions for Self-Archiving. We consider a ship <b>stowage</b> <b>planning</b> problem where steel coils with known destination ports are to be loaded onto a ship. The coils are to be stowed on the ship in rows. Due to their heavy weight and cylindrical shape, coils can be stowed in at most two levels. Different from stowage problems in previous studies, in this problem there are no fixed positions on the ship for the coils due to their different sizes. At a destination port, if a coil to be unloaded is not at a top position, those blocking it need to be shuffled. In addition, the stability of ship has to be maintained after unloading at each destination port. The objective for the <b>stowage</b> <b>planning</b> problem is to minimize a combination of ship instability throughout the entire voyage, the shuffles needed for unloading at the destination ports, and the dispersion of coils to be unloaded at the same destination port. We formulate the problem as a novel mixed integer linear programming model. Several valid inequalities are derived to help reducing solution time. A tabu search (TS) algorithm is developed for the problem with the initial solution generated using a construction heuristic. To evaluate the proposed TS algorithm, numerical experiments are carried out on problem instances of three different scales by comparing it with a model-based decomposition heuristic, the classic TS algorithm, the particle swarm optimization algorithm, and the manual method used in practice. The results show that for small problems, the proposed algorithm can generate optimal solutions. For medium and large practical problems, the proposed algorithm outperforms other methods...|$|R

When sailing, {{this type of}} cargo must {{be attached to the}} deck using chains, to prevent damaging the cargo. For each voyage including multiple port calls where the cargo is loaded/unloaded, an important decision is to decide where to place each vehicle (or unit), such that the time used on shifting is minimized. Shifting means temporarily moving some vehicles to make an entry/exit route for the vehicles that are to be loaded/unloaded at a given port. As the vehicles are securely fastened to the deck, shifting is a time-consuming procedure. We present the <b>stowage</b> <b>plan</b> evaluation problem which is to determine the optimal vehicles to shift at each port call, such that the time spent on shifting is minimized. Given a set of alternative stowage plans for a voyage, the results from the <b>stowage</b> <b>plan</b> evaluation problems are used to determine the best among these stowage plans.

40|$|The {{support of}} {{containerization}} to trade development demands an efficient solution method for the container loading problem {{in order to}} reduce shipment and handling time. Hence, the <b>stowage</b> <b>planning</b> of containers is critical to provide speedy delivery of resources from the area of supply to the area of demand. Moreover, information on container terminal activities, structure of ship, and characteristics of containers is distributed among stowage planners. This information imposes constraints, and so the master bay plan problem (MBPP) becomes NP-hard. Therefore, a multi-agent systems (MAS) methodology is designed to effectively communicate the information and solve the MBPP sustainably. In the designed MAS methodology, an information exchange system (IES) is created for stowage planners to bid for ship slots in each experimental iterative combinatorial auction (ICA) market.

Facing this scenario, it is needed the development of technologies and solutions which contribute to raise the profitability, flexibility and efficiency of marine transportation. This will lead to more competitive freight, so investing on such technologies is a guarantee of success.

40|$|The {{container}} ship <b>stowage</b> <b>planning</b> problem {{was introduced to}} the research group by the container transport company Euroports. The goal of this so called Master Bay Plan Problem (MBPP) is to minimize the total stowage time to transport a given set of cargo. Although the MBPP is a general definition of the problem, it differs in two aspects. First, the MBPP takes into account an individual loading time for each container and aims to minimize the total loading time. Second, containers are located into fixed slots in the cargo space. Our approach aims to minimize the total container operations or shifts consisting of unloading and reloading operations caused by blocking containers. In the first stage an alternative model is developed: the Sliced Bar Packing Model (SBPM). Bars represent containers from the pick up till the destination terminal. These bars can be cut into multiple parts and are packed in a given space, while the total number of cuts should be minimized. In the second stage, a heuristic solves stowage problems represented by the SBPM. The performance of the SBPM heuristic is compared to the Suspensory Heuristic (SH) introduced by Avriel et al. Results show that the SBPM outperforms the SH. In addition, while the SH is limited to a homogeneous set of containers and cannot take into account stability constraints, the SBPM accommodates these needs. status: publishe...|$|R
5000|$|Chemical tankers {{often have}} a system for tank heating in order to {{maintain}} the viscosity of certain cargoes, typically by passing pressurized steam through stainless steel 'heating coils' in the cargo tanks, transferring heat into the cargo which circulates in the tank by convection. All modern chemical tankers feature double hull construction and most have one hydraulically driven, submerged cargo pump for each tank with independent piping, which means that each tank can load a separate cargo without any mixing. Consequently, many oceangoing chemical tankers may carry numerous different grades of cargo on the same voyage, often loading and discharging these [...] "parcels" [...] at different ports or terminals. This means that the scheduling, <b>stowage</b> <b>planning</b> and operation of such ships requires a high level of coordination and specialist knowledge, both at sea and on shore. Tank cleaning after discharging cargo is a very important aspect of chemical tanker operations, because tanks which are not properly cleaned of all cargo residue can adversely affect the purity of the next cargo loaded. Before tanks are cleaned, they must be properly ventilated and checked to be free of potentially explosive gases. Chemical tankers usually have transverse stiffeners on deck rather than inside the cargo tanks, in order to make the tank walls smooth and thus easier to clean using permanently fitted tank cleaning machines.|$|R
