25|$|Grain {{boundaries}} are in general {{only a few}} nanometers wide. In common materials, crystallites are large enough that grain boundaries account for {{a small fraction of}} the material. However, very <b>small</b> <b>grain</b> sizes are achievable. In nanocrystalline solids, grain boundaries become a significant volume fraction of the material, with profound effects on such properties as diffusion and plasticity. In the limit of small crystallites, as the volume fraction of grain boundaries approaches 100%, the material ceases to have any crystalline character, and thus becomes an amorphous solid.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Kodak {{introduced}} the T-Grain emulsion, a technological advancement {{in the shape}} and make-up of silver halide grains in their films. T-Grain is a tabular silver halide grain that allows for greater overall surface area, resulting in greater light sensitivity with a relatively <b>small</b> <b>grain</b> and a more uniform shape that results in a less overall graininess to the film. This made for sharper and more sensitive films. The T-Grain technology was first employed in Kodak's EXR line of motion picture color negative stocks. This was further refined in 1996 with the Vision line of emulsions, followed by Vision2 in the early 2000s and Vision3 in 2007.|$|E

The bimodal size distribution of interstellar grains is discussed, steady-state grain temperatures are computed for core-mantle and bare particles, and temperature fluctuations of small bare particles are analyzed. Far-IR emission properties are calculated for spherical core-mantle and bare grains. The results obtained indicate that the use of a fluctuating temperature distribution for <b>small</b> <b>grains</b> shifts the radiation maximum for emission by all grains from about 170 to about 250 microns and that the total IR radiation emitted by <b>small</b> <b>grains</b> is substantially larger than the total emitted by classical-sized grains.

But when what I consider the true effect only was obtained, the quantity of gas given off was so small that I could not ascertain whether it was, as it ought to be, oxygen at one wire and hydrogen at the other. Of the two streams one seemed more copious than the other, and on turning the apparatus round, still the same side in relation to the machine; gave the largest stream. On substituting solution of sulphate of soda for pure water (329.), these minute streams were still observed. But the quantities were so small, that on working the machine for half an hour I could not obtain at either pole a bubble of gas larger than a <b>small</b> <b>grain</b> of sand.

40|$|Granular {{materials}} size segregate {{when exposed}} to external periodic perturbations such as vibrations. Moreover, mixtures of grains of different sizes spontaneously segregate {{in the absence of}} external perturbations: when a mixture is simply poured onto a pile, the large grains {{are more likely to be}} found near the base, while the <b>small</b> <b>grains</b> are more likely to be near the top. Here, we report a spontaneous phenomenon arising when we pour a mixture between two vertical plates: the mixture spontaneously stratifies into alternating layers of <b>small</b> and large <b>grains</b> whenever the large grains are rougher than the <b>small</b> <b>grains.</b> In contrast, we find only spontaneous segregation when the large grains are more rounded than the <b>small</b> <b>grains.</b> The stratification is related to the occurrence of avalanches; during each avalanche the grains comprising the avalanche spontaneously stratify into a pair of layers through a "kink" mechanism, with the <b>small</b> <b>grains</b> forming a sublayer underneath the layer of large grains.

She was hungry for a sight of well-remembered faces; she longed to hear the soft laughter and gay repartee of old friends; she was eager for gossipy first-hand news of her old world. Nevertheless, something in her sister's letter, in messages from the others who were coming, had touched Madeline's pride. In one sense the expected guests were hostile, inasmuch as they were scornful and curious about the West that had claimed her. She imagined what they would expect in a Western ranch. They would surely get the real thing, too, as Stillwell said; and in that certainty was satisfaction for a <b>small</b> <b>grain</b> of something within Madeline which approached resentment. She wistfully wondered, however, if her sister or friends would come to see the West even a little as she saw it. That, perhaps, would he hoping too much.

Do not you destroy in them what <b>small</b> <b>grain</b> of self-respect still remains. You fancy they are not so. They seem to you brazen-faced, proud, impenitent. So did the publicans and harlots seem to those proud, blind Pharisees. Those pompous, self-righteous fools did not know what terrible struggles were going on in those poor sin- tormented hearts. Their pride had blinded them, while they were saying all along, 'It is we alone who see. This people, which knoweth not the law, is accursed.' Then came the Lord Jesus, the Son of man, who knew what was in man; and he spoke to them gently, cordially, humanly; and they heard him, and justified God, and were baptized, confessing their sins; and so, as he said himself, the publicans and harlots went into the kingdom of God before those proud, self-conceited Pharisees.|$|E
6000|$|Change of habits {{appears to}} be often a result of imitation, of which Mr. Tegetmeier gives some good examples. He states that if pigeons are reared {{exclusively}} with <b>small</b> <b>grain,</b> as wheat or barley, they will starve before eating beans. But when they are thus starving, if a bean-eating pigeon is put among them, they follow its example, and thereafter adopt the habit. So fowls sometimes refuse to eat maize, but on seeing others eat it, they {{do the same and}} become excessively fond of it. Many persons have found that their yellow crocuses were eaten by sparrows, while the blue, purple, and white coloured varieties were left untouched; but Mr. Tegetmeier, who grows only these latter colours, found that after two years the sparrows began to attack them, and thereafter destroyed them quite as readily as the yellow ones; and he believes it was merely because some bolder sparrow than the rest set the example. On this subject Mr. Charles C. Abbott well remarks: [...] "In studying the habits of our American birds--and I suppose it is true of birds everywhere--it must at all times be remembered that there is less stability in the habits of birds than is usually supposed; and no account of the habits of any one species will exactly detail the various features of its habits as they really are, in every portion of the territory it inhabits."[27] ...|$|E

60|$|During {{the three}} months she had been here she had made up considerably, as Helen meant she should, for time spent in interminable walks round {{sheltered}} gardens, and the household gossip of her aunts. But Mrs. Ambrose {{would have been the}} first to disclaim any influence, or indeed any belief that to influence was within her power. She saw her less shy, and less serious, which was all to the good, and the violent leaps and the interminable mazes which had led to that result were usually not even guessed at by her. Talk was the medicine she trusted to, talk about everything, talk that was free, unguarded, and as candid as a habit of talking with men made natural in her own case. Nor did she encourage those habits of unselfishness and amiability founded upon insincerity which are put at so high a value in mixed households of men and women. She desired that Rachel should think, and for this reason offered books and discouraged too entire a dependence upon Bach and Beethoven and Wagner. But when Mrs. Ambrose would have suggested Defoe, Maupassant, or some spacious chronicle of family life, Rachel chose modern books, books in shiny yellow covers, books {{with a great deal of}} gilding on the back, which were tokens in her aunt's eyes of harsh wrangling and disputes about facts which had no such importance as the moderns claimed for them. But she did not interfere. Rachel read what she chose, reading with the curious literalness of one to whom written sentences are unfamiliar, and handling words as though they were made of wood, separately of great importance, and possessed of shapes like tables or chairs. In this way she came to conclusions, which had to be remodelled according to the adventures of the day, and were indeed recast as liberally as any one could desire, leaving always a <b>small</b> <b>grain</b> of belief behind them.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} novel method {{to measure the}} {{strength}} of interstellar magnetic fields based on ultraviolet (UV) polarization of starlight, which is in part produced by weakly aligned, <b>small</b> interstellar <b>grains.</b> We begin with calculating degrees of alignment of small (size a∼ 0. 01 μm) and very small (a∼ 0. 001 μm) grains in the interstellar magnetic field due to the Davis-Greenstein paramagnetic relaxation and resonance paramagnetic relaxation. We compute the degrees of paramagnetic alignment with the ambient magnetic field B using Langevin equations. In this paper, we take into account various processes essential for the dynamics of <b>small</b> <b>grains,</b> including infrared (IR) emission, electric dipole emission, plasma drag and collisions with neutral and ionized species. We find that the alignment of <b>small</b> <b>grains</b> is necessary to reproduce the observed polarization in the UV, although the polarization arising from these <b>small</b> <b>grains</b> is negligible at the optical and IR wavelengths. Based on fitting theoretical models to observed extinction and polarization curves, {{we find that the}} best-fit model requires a higher degree of alignment of <b>small</b> <b>grains</b> for the case with the peak wavelength of polarization λ_< 0. 55 μm, which exhibits an excess UV polarization relative to the Serkowski law, compared to the typical case λ_= 0. 55 μm. We interpret the correlation between the systematic increase of the UV polarization relative to maximum polarization (i. e. of p(6 μ m^- 1) /p_) with λ_^- 1 by appealing to the higher degree of alignment of <b>small</b> <b>grains.</b> We identify paramagnetic relaxation as the cause of the alignment of <b>small</b> <b>grains</b> and utilize the dependence of the degree of alignment on the magnetic field strength B to suggest a new way to measure B using the observable parameters λ_ and p(6 μ m^- 1) /p_.
