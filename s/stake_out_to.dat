An error by first baseman Andrés Galarraga helped San Diego take a 2-1 lead in the eighth. In {{the bottom half of the}} inning, closer Trevor Hoffman came into the game early to end a Braves' scoring threat. However, in the ninth, the Braves got the tying run off him when Ryan Klesko scored on a sacrifice fly. In the tenth, Ken Caminiti belted a home run off reliever Kerry Ligtenberg to give San Diego their winning margin. The Braves put two men on the bottom of the inning, but Galarraga flew <b>out</b> <b>to</b> end the game.|$|R
50|$|After {{a grueling}} stretch where they endured two hard fought {{overtime}} matches over {{a span of}} 5 days, the Texans took the opportunity of a prolonged week to heal up and rest {{in advance of the}} stretch run to the playoffs. The Texans took the AFC's best record into Tennessee to face a reeling Titans team, fresh off of firing their offensive coordinator earlier in the week. The Texans <b>staked</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> an early lead and never looked back as the defense forced 6 Titans turnovers and held Titans running back Chris Johnson to 51 yards en route to a relatively stress free 24-10 victory. With the win, the Texans set a new team record for wins in a season, while improving to 11-1 and also clinched the franchise's second straight trip to the playoffs and swept the Titans {{for the first time since}} 2004.|$|R

Beyond these, as soon as the gravel was known to contain gold, other miners began to work--for the most part in parties, as the depth at which paying ground lay beneath the surface was so great that it could only be reached by joint labour--and the flat so long {{neglected}} now became one of the busiest points in the camp.|$|R

You see I cannot get on much with the claim by myself; the ground falls in and wants timbering, and I can do nothing alone. Well these miners have offered to help sink our shaft, on the conditions that they get no pay if it turns out poor, but if it turns out well they are to be paid for their daily labour, and when we have worked out our claims they are to have the right of using our shaft for working out the claims they have <b>staked</b> <b>out</b> next <b>to</b> ours." ...|$|R
5000|$|The rancho {{society had}} few {{resources}} except large herds of Longhorn cattle which grew well in California. The ranchos produced the largest cowhide (called California Greenbacks) and tallow business in North America by killing and skinning their cattle and {{cutting off the}} fat. The cowhides were <b>staked</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> dry and the tallow was put in large cowhide bags. The rest of the animal was left to rot or feed the California grizzly bears that were common in California. With something to trade, and needing everything from nails, needles and almost anything made of metal to fancy thread and cloth that could be sewn into fancy cloaks or ladies' dresses, etc., they started trading with merchant ships from Boston, Massachusetts, Britain and other trading ports in Europe and the East Coast of the United States. The trip from Boston, New York City or Liverpool England averaged over 200 days one way. Trading ships and the occasional whaler put into San Diego, San Juan Capistrano, San Pedro, San Buenaventura (Ventura), Monterey and Yerba Buena (San Francisco) after stopping and paying the import tariff of 50-100% at the entry port of Monterey, California. These tariffs or custom fees paid for the Alta California government. The classic book Two Years Before the Mast (originally published 1840) by Richard Henry Dana, Jr. gives a good first-hand account of a two-year sailing ship sea trading voyage to Alta California which he took in 1834-5. Dana mentions that they also took back a large shipment of California longhorn horns. Horns were {{used to make a}} large number of items during this period.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} moral economy {{of food in}} the United Kingdom via discourses on food bank usage and obesity. It argues that both of these markers of {{malnutrition}} were interpreted under the Conservative-led governments of David Cameron (2010 – 2016) as failings of personal responsibility and identified primarily with the working class, advancing the assumption that poor people make poor choices. Based on a critique of this account, our wider contribution is two-fold. First, we identify the Hayekian lineage of the discourse of personal responsibility, highlighting its utility in facilitating a form of neoliberal market consent through its insistence on self-reliance. Second, we <b>stake</b> <b>out</b> an alternative <b>to</b> this conceptualization through a discussion of Adam Smith’s notion of self-command, which we call interpersonal responsibility...|$|R
40|$|This article {{investigates the}} effect of public opinion, ideology, and {{political}} security on state decision-making on economic integration within the European Union (EU). Although leaders may have objective preferences based on projected economic effects and party ideology, they often face domestic constituencies with different views on increasing European interdependence. I argue that leaders with higher political security are able to discount adverse public opinion and to pursue their own preferences. Where leaders feel their politi-cal life may be in jeopardy, they <b>stake</b> <b>out</b> positions closer <b>to</b> prevailing public opinion. I test this hypothesis using a series of ordered probit models, and I conclude that even modest gains in political security dramatically {{increase the likelihood of}} a leader pushing strongly for economic integration...|$|R

He suspects a trap, however, and in a brief shootout shoots and paralyzes Jones. Jones wounds Roy, who performs surgery on himself to remove the bullet and avoid going to a hospital, where his gunshot wound would be reported to the police. With his knowledge of police procedures, Roy changes his modus operandi and becomes an armed robber. During one robbery he fires his semi-automatic pistol, and the police recover the ejected casing.
