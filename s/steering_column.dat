5|$|Italian {{prosecutors}} brought {{legal proceedings}} against six people {{in connection with}} Senna's death. They were Frank Williams, Patrick Head and Adrian Newey of Williams; Fedrico Bendinelli representing {{the owners of the}} Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari; Giorgio Poggi as the circuit director and Roland Bruynseraede who was race director and sanctioned the circuit. The trial verdict was given on 16 December 1997, clearing all six defendants of manslaughter charges. The cause of Senna's accident was established by the court as the <b>steering</b> <b>column</b> breaking. The column had been cut and welded back together at Senna's request in order for him to be more comfortable in the car.|$|E
5|$|Holden's {{standardisation}} of six airbags in March 2008 for MY09 {{made the}} VE {{eligible for the}} ANCAP side pole test, yielding additional scoring points. The second stage of the VE's safety rollout in October 2008 for MY09.5 included {{the addition of a}}n energy absorbing <b>steering</b> <b>column</b> shroud and redesigned rear door latches across the VE range. The inclusion of a seat belt reminder on the Omega sedan yielded another point, thus allowing the Omega sedan to score five-stars, or a score of 33.45 when tested the following December. The Omega Sportwagon was the next model to be awarded the full five stars the following February, following the addition of a seat belt reminder in Sportwagon production. The remaining VE models, including the Ute and WM Statesman/Caprice, which had already received most of the safety upgrades, received the seat belt reminder as standard fitment as of MY10 production from August 2009. As a result, all VE sedan and Sportwagon variants along with the extended length WM models received the five-star rating. The VE Ute officially received the rating on 19 October 2009, making the entire line-up of Australian-made Holdens five-star ANCAP rated.|$|E
40|$|Several {{parts of}} {{automotive}} <b>steering</b> <b>columns</b> are fixed by both dimensional interference and mechanical-plastic sticking of one part to another. To determine {{the effect of}} these fixing procedures on the joints of <b>steering</b> <b>columns,</b> pull-out tests were performed. Samples with and without sticking were tested. The influence of the sticking and interference procedures on the integrity of the <b>steering</b> <b>columns</b> was experimentally determined by force-distance curves. The results suggested that the sticking increases more than twice the pull-out force and augments about 24 % the absorbed energy in the whole pull-out process. Statistical fitting tests show that pull-out forces obey a log-normal distribution. From these data were possible to estimate the structural reliability of joints of <b>steering</b> <b>columns,</b> which results indicate that the fail probability is close to zero for a minimum pull-out force of 2000 N. This work allows for knowing the importance of the sticking procedure in the fixation of automotive pieces, and establishing new standards for the assembly of <b>steering</b> <b>columns</b> in mechanical and statistical basis...|$|R

50|$|Collapsible <b>steering</b> <b>columns</b> {{were invented}} by Bela Barenyi and were {{introduced}} in the 1959 Mercedes-Benz W111 Fintail, along with crumple zones. This safety feature first appeared on cars built by General Motors after an extensive and very public lobbying campaign enacted by Ralph Nader. Ford started to install collapsible <b>steering</b> <b>columns</b> in 1968.|$|R
5|$|In 1994, Ayrton Senna joined Hill at Williams. As {{the reigning}} champion, this time Prost, was again no longer racing, Hill {{retained}} his number '0'. The pre-season betting was that Senna would coast to the title, {{but with the}} banning of electronic driver aids, the Benetton team and Michael Schumacher initially proved more competitive and won the first three races. At the San Marino Grand Prix on 1 May, Senna died after his car went off the road. With the team undergoing investigation from the Italian authorities on manslaughter charges, Hill found himself team leader with only one season's experience in the top flight. It was widely reported {{at the time that}} the Williams car's <b>steering</b> <b>column</b> had failed, though Hill told BBC Sport in 2004 that he believed Senna simply took the corner too fast for the conditions, referring to the fact that the car had just restarted the race with cold tyres after being slowed down by a safety car.|$|E
25|$|Options {{included}} headrests ($52) and a tilt-telescopic <b>steering</b> <b>column.</b>|$|E
25|$|Interiors were mildly revised {{with minor}} {{changes to the}} {{instrument}} panel including the movement of the heating/air conditioning controls {{to the left of the}} steering wheel, which was new this year. Headrests, previously optional, were now standard equipment due to a federal safety mandate. The 1969 LeSabre and other Buicks also received a new <b>steering</b> <b>column</b> mounted ignition switch (relocated from the instrument panel) that also locked the steering wheel when the transmission was in Park. The ignition/locking <b>steering</b> <b>column</b> appeared on all 1969 General Motors cars one year ahead of the federal mandate requiring all cars to be so equipped.|$|E

25|$|Pontiacs {{built in}} the late 1960s {{conformed}} to new U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. These included energy-absorbing interior parts such as <b>steering</b> <b>columns,</b> <b>steering</b> wheels, knobs and handles, dual-circuit hydraulic brake systems, shoulder belts, side marker lights, and headrests.|$|R
25|$|New {{this year}} was a dual master-cylinder braking system and {{optional}} front disc brakes along with Rally II wheels. Also new for 1967 was an energy-absorbing collapsible <b>steering</b> <b>column.</b> Plus, Pontiac added an 8-track Stereo tape player.|$|E
25|$|One {{important}} {{research objective}} {{which could not}} be achieved with either cadavers or live humans was a means of reducing the injuries caused by impalement on the <b>steering</b> <b>column.</b> By 1964, over a million fatalities resulting from steering wheel impact had been recorded, a significant percentage of all fatalities; the introduction by General Motors in the early 1960s of the collapsible <b>steering</b> <b>column</b> cut the risk of steering-wheel death by fifty percent. The most commonly used animal subjects in cabin-collision studies were pigs, primarily because their internal structure is similar to a human's. Pigs can also be placed in a vehicle in a good approximation of a seated human.|$|E
25|$|A new safety-oriented {{instrument}} panel featured a <b>steering</b> <b>column</b> designed to collapse under impact, and the gauges and controls were grouped in a hooded binnacle {{front of the}} driver with the dashboard pushed forward {{and away from the}} passengers.|$|E

50|$|The USVI have 1257 km of roadways. Island roads {{tend to be}} poorly {{surfaced}} due to the terrain, and {{may take}} sharp turns. Cars drive on the left hand side of the road, but nearly all the automobiles on the island have left-side <b>steering</b> <b>columns.</b>|$|R
25|$|GM {{announced}} in April 2011 that 2,100 North American-market Cruze models would be recalled following {{a report of}} the steering wheel breaking away from the <b>steering</b> <b>column</b> during motion. According to Consumer Reports, during its first year, the Cruze scored the lowest in reliability among compact sedans.|$|E
25|$|The {{criminal}} charges {{focused on the}} car's <b>steering</b> <b>column,</b> which {{was found to have}} sheared off at a point where a modification had been made. The prosecution alleged that the column had failed causing the accident and the Williams team conceded to this failure, but only as caused by the impact at the Tamburello corner. Senna had not liked the position of his FW16's steering wheel relative to the seating position and had asked for the former to be changed. Head and Adrian Newey satisfied Senna's request by having the existing column cut and extended with a smaller-diameter piece of tubing, which was welded together with reinforcing plates. The modification was carried out in this manner as {{there was no time to}} manufacture a new longer <b>steering</b> <b>column</b> in time for the race.|$|E
25|$|The 1967 {{model year}} {{required}} new safety equipment. A new energy-absorbing <b>steering</b> <b>column</b> {{was accompanied by}} an energy-absorbing steering wheel, padded instrument panel, non-protruding control knobs, and four-way emergency flashers. A shoulder belt option was also featured, and the brake master cylinder was now a dual reservoir unit with a backup hydraulic circuit.|$|E
50|$|The first EUCD {{cars were}} {{introduced}} at the 2006 Geneva Motor Show: Volvo's S80 and Ford's S-MAX and Galaxy, which share {{about half of}} their total parts, for example, the <b>steering</b> <b>columns</b> on the Galaxy, S-Max and S80 share 80 percent of their parts.|$|R
50|$|While a {{bare chassis}} {{instead of a}} cowled chassis, the 3900/3000 {{maintained}} mechanical commonality with the 3800 conventional. This included shared powertrain and suspension components, while interior parts included Navistar instrument panels and <b>steering</b> <b>columns.</b> The 3800 itself {{was based on the}} International 4700/4900.|$|R
5000|$|Collapsible universally jointed <b>{{steering}}</b> <b>columns,</b> {{along with}} <b>steering</b> wheel airbag. The steering system is mounted {{behind the front}} axle - behind and protected by, the front crumple zone.

25|$|Third: See that {{spark control}} lever, {{which is the}} short lever located {{on top of the}} {{steering}} wheel on the right side, is back as far as possible toward the driver and the long lever, on top of the <b>steering</b> <b>column</b> controlling the carburetor, is pushed forward about one inch from its retarded position.|$|E
25|$|Hogan and his wife, Valerie, {{survived a}} head-on {{collision}} with a Greyhound bus on a fog-shrouded bridge, {{early in the}} morning, east of Van Horn, Texas on February 2, 1949. Hogan threw himself across Valerie {{in order to protect}} her, and would have been killed had he not done so, as the <b>steering</b> <b>column</b> punctured the driver's seat.|$|E
25|$|Common {{equipment}} includes tilt <b>steering</b> <b>column,</b> six-way adjustable driver seat, rear-window defroster, remote {{fuel door}} and a 60/40 split-bench folding rear seat. The instrument panel includes a tachometer, speedometer, odometer, trip odometer, fuel gauge, coolant temperature gauge and lighting dimmer control. The IP also has a center storage tray, lighter, extra 12-volt outlet, digital quartz clock and lighted glove box.|$|E
25|$|Drive train, {{front and}} rear suspension, brakes, radiators, master cylinders, trunnions, <b>steering</b> <b>columns,</b> power <b>steering</b> pumps, engines, transmissions, brake drums and rotors are {{interchangeable}} with 1965 and 1966 Ambassadors and Classics. Some parts are even interchangeable back to 1958 and earlier, while other components were used by AMC into the 1970s.|$|R
50|$|Cars {{drive on}} the left hand side of the road, but nearly all the {{automobiles}} on the island have left side <b>steering</b> <b>columns.</b> This has proven difficult for new residents and visitors from right-hand traffic locales such as the mainland United States, the French and Dutch West Indies, and Puerto Rico.|$|R

25|$|Galaxies for {{model year}} 1970 {{received}} minor trim changes. A new ignition lock was {{located on the}} right side of the <b>steering</b> <b>column.</b> Model year 1970 was the last year for the XL, but Galaxie 500 hardtop coupes were also available in both formal-roof and SportsRoof body styles. The optional 4-speed manual transmission, which was available on the 429 the year prior, was dropped for 1970.|$|E
25|$|One {{innovation}} was {{the attention}} paid to passive safety. The car featured a robust chassis providing above average side impact protection, an unusually short <b>steering</b> <b>column</b> with the steering gear set well back {{from the front of}} the car, and a fuel tank placed in a carefully protected location above the rear axle in order to minimize fire risk in the event of an accident.|$|E
25|$|For 1967 all Fords {{featured}} a large, padded hub {{in the center}} of the plastic steering wheel, along with an energy-absorbing <b>steering</b> <b>column</b> (introduced late into the 1967 model year), padded interior surfaces, recessed controls on the instrument panel, and front outboard shoulder belt anchors. Another safety related change was the introduction of the dual brake master cylinder used on all subsequent Galaxies (and other Ford models).|$|E
50|$|Additionally, TABC {{manufactures}} spare parts, catalytic converters, coated catalytic substrates, and <b>steering</b> <b>columns</b> for Toyota's North American Manufacturing Facilities. Corolla stamped {{parts are}} also exported to Japan and Canada. In 2004, TABC began {{assembly of the}} first, U.S. produced Hino commercial truck. This assembly line was removed from TABC in 2008.|$|R
50|$|Some {{varieties}} of screw are manufactured with a break-away head, which snaps off when adequate torque is applied. This prevents tampering and also provides an easily inspectable joint to guarantee proper assembly.
