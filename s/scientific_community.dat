50|$|A major {{development}} {{in recent decades}} has been {{the study of the}} formation, structure, and evolution of <b>scientific</b> <b>communities</b> by sociologists and anthropologists including David Bloor, Harry Collins, Bruno Latour, and Anselm Strauss.

In recognition of his ability, he was commissioned by the Spanish government to study tropical and communicable diseases.

In this paper we analyze <b>scientific</b> <b>communities</b> from the CoP point of view.

This analysis includes an analysis of CSCL conference proceedings and an analysis of the lists of participants and program committee members of CSCL confer-ences...|$|R

Pastafarianism has received praise from the <b>scientific</b> <b>community</b> and criticism from proponents of intelligent design. Pastafarians have engaged in disputes with creationists, including in Polk County, Florida, where they {{played a role in}} dissuading the local school board from adopting new rules on teaching evolution.|$|E

5|$|He was {{undoubtedly}} {{one of the}} greatest natural history explorers of the 19th century. Despite this, his fame faded quickly after his death. For a long time, he was treated as a relatively obscure figure in the history of science. A number of reasons have been suggested for this lack of attention, including his modesty, his willingness to champion unpopular causes without regard for his own reputation, and the discomfort of much of the <b>scientific</b> <b>community</b> with some of his unconventional ideas.|$|E
