40|$|Effects of {{selenium}} {{administration on}} blood serum Se content and on selected reproductive characteristics of sheep (short communication) Effects of selenium on certain indicators of sheep reproductive success and on Se {{level in the}} sheep’s blood serum were studied in 2001 - 2002 on 100 Polish merino sheep ewes kept in a Western Pomeranian sheep farm. The 100 ewes were picked out on random and divided into two equal groups: treatment and control. The blood samples for serum Se assays were collected prior to administration of sodium selenide (before servicing) and 7 days after the treatment. The study was aimed at determining Se effects on the reproductive success (fecundity) of ewes and on selected indicators of lamb utility in a <b>Se-deficient</b> <b>area.</b> Se administration prior to servicing enhanced the herd’s reproductive success. The treatment group’s litter size was by 0. 38 lamb per ewe {{higher than that of}} the control. The control group lamb body weight was lower than that of the treatment group by an average of 0. 23 kg on birth and 0. 31 kg 33 days later...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSelenium (Se) is an {{essential}} trace element to animals and humans as Se is incorporated {{in a series of}} organic molecules, such as 30 mammalian selenoproteins or seleno - enzymes, which are vital for the basic functions of life. To increase the Se intake in <b>Se-deficient</b> <b>areas,</b> food and feed can be enriched using Se fertilizers or supplements. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the distribution, speciation, bioaccessibility, and bioavailability of Se in Se-enriched wheat (SW) grain and in Se-enriched chicken meat products using commercial enzymes and human gastric juices (HGJs). Results from the present work show that Se in wheat is bioaccessible and bioavailable, and that SW flour or bran can serve as a valuable dietary source of Se to humans. However, the bioaccessibility studies using commercial enzymes and HGJs for wheat flour, bran, and chicken meat digestion suggests that the use of commercial enzymes overestimate Se bioavailability. Furthermore, the use of NaCl or Tris-HCl to extract Se proteins from enriched products was not suited for bioaccessibility studies. The SW flour or bran can, however, serve as a valuable dietary source of Se to humans...|$|R
