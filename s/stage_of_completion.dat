In July, Melody Maker referred to the album as [...] "poetic" [...] and [...] "interesting", though NME wrote in October that there was [...] "not nearly enough variety to make it entertaining". It received radio plays from the BBC's more progressive disc-jockeys such as John Peel and Bob Harris. Drake was unhappy with the inlay sleeve, which printed songs in the wrong running order and reproduced verses omitted from the recorded versions. In an interview his sister Gabrielle said: [...] "He was very secretive.

He threw it onto the bed and walked out!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Saint Petersburg Mint {{received}} the {{instructions on the}} next day, [...] Constantine's birth medals were pressed immediately and sent to Cancrin's orders; making of the dies [...] took a whole week. The dies were sized to fit a manual press {{and could not be}} reused in automated mass production presses. Tradition held it that the Constantine ruble presses were designed and carved by Jacob Reichel (obverse) and Vladimir Alekseyev (reverse). According to Schukina, Reichel was certainly the author of the artwork, but each of three obverse press dies was carved by its own engraver. All three differ in craftsmanship quality and <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>completion.</b>|$|E

50|$|How {{accounting}} {{revenue and}} costs {{need to be}} recognized depends first on whether the <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>completion</b> of a project can be reliably measured. If this is the case, cost and revenue (including profit if any) can be recognized up to the percentage of completion during the current accounting period. If the <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>completion</b> of a project cannot be reliably measured, the revenue can only be recognized up to the costs that have been incurred and any profit is only recognized {{at the end of}} the last accounting period. In the case a company is expecting to make a loss on the contract, this loss will be immediately recognized in the current accounting period.|$|E

The country code changed as the hull was transferred from flag state to flag state.

50|$|A {{contract}} {{usually takes}} {{several years to}} get itself completed. If the profit on such contracts is recorded only after their completion, then wide fluctuations may be noted in the profit figures of contractors from year to year. To avoid these fluctuations in the reported profits and to reflect the revenue in the accounting period during which the activity is undertaken, the profit in respect of each contract in progress is transferred to the {{profit and loss account}} of the year by calculating the notional profit. The portion of notional profit to be transferred to the profit and loss account depends on the <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>completion</b> of a contract.|$|E

50|$|According to Carl Blümel, a {{sculptor}} {{and director of}} the Pergamonmuseum, Greek quarrying in early times was similar to Egyptian quarrying practice. The rough form of the figure was carved out. The sculptors were especially able to work the sides. They worked layer by layer, creating flat contour areas. So the sculptors never worked on a leg, arm or head individually, but always on the sculpture as a whole and thus the whole figure was at the same <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>completion</b> at each moment. Only after the creation of the rough contour was the figure rounded out. This is all clearly demonstrated by the Kouros of Apollonas.|$|E

50|$|Most {{of what we}} {{know about}} Cao was passed down from his contemporaries and friends. Cao {{eventually}} settled in the countryside west of Beijing where he lived the larger part of his later years in poverty selling off his paintings. Cao was recorded as an inveterate drinker. Friends and acquaintances recalled an intelligent, highly talented man who spent a decade working diligently on a work that must have been Dream of the Red Chamber. They praised both his stylish paintings, particularly of cliffs and rocks, and originality in poetry, which they likened to Li He's. Cao died some time in 1763 or 1764, leaving his novel in a very advanced <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>completion.</b> (At least the first draft had been completed, some pages of the manuscript were lost after being borrowed by friends or relatives.) He was survived by a wife after the death of a son.|$|E
