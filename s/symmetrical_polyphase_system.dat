50|$|A <b>polyphase</b> <b>system</b> is a {{means of}} distributing alternating-current {{electrical}} power. <b>Polyphase</b> <b>systems</b> have three or more energized electrical conductors carrying alternating currents with a definite time offset between the voltage waves in each conductor. <b>Polyphase</b> <b>systems</b> are particularly useful for transmitting power to electric motors. The most common example is the three-phase power system used for industrial applications and for power transmission. A major advantage of three phase power transmission (using three conductors, as opposed to a single phase power transmission, which uses two conductors), is that, since the remaining conductors act as the return path for any single conductor, the power transmitted by a balanced three phase system is three times that of a single phase transmission but only one extra conductor is used. Thus, a 50% / 1.5x increase in the transmission costs achieves a 200% / 3.0x increase in the power transmitted.|$|R

Nikola Tesla, (1856 - 1943) Serbian-born, American inventor and scientist, a pioneer in electrification, significantly influenced the technological development of our civilization by his <b>polyphase</b> <b>system</b> inventions. This system {{is the cornerstone of}} modern electro-energetic system of production, long distance transmission and usage of electrical currents, electricity and communication. Tesla’s asynchronous motor performs 95 % of electric drive in the world. It is also estimated that 60 % of total world energy is spent in driving these motors. The asynchronous motor is also called “the draft horse of industry ” since it is used as the drive in factories, mines, power stations, in other words, in all industry. The majority of household motors are also asynchronous. Since the beginning of its exploitation towards the end of last century up to now, the <b>polyphase</b> <b>system,</b> together with the asynchronous motor, has been perfected and improved to a remarkable and hitherto unconceivable dimensions.

50|$|For two {{electrical}} {{systems to}} be synchronized, both systems must operate {{at the same}} frequency, and the phase angle between the systems must be zero (and two <b>polyphase</b> <b>systems</b> must have the same phase sequence). Synchroscopes measure and display the frequency difference and phase angle between two power systems. Only when these two quantities are zero {{is it safe to}} connect the two systems together. Connecting two unsynchronized AC power systems together is likely to cause high currents to flow, which will severely damage any equipment not protected by fuses or circuit breakers.|$|R

50|$|Polyphase coils are {{electromagnetic}} coils connected {{together in a}} <b>polyphase</b> <b>system</b> such as a generator or motor. In modern systems, the number of phases is usually three or a multiple of three. Each phase carries a sinusoidal alternating current whose phase is delayed relative to one of its neighbours and advanced relative to its other neighbour. The phase currents are separated in time evenly within each period of the alternating current. For example, in a three-phase system, the phases are separated from each other by one-third of the period.|$|R

40|$|The paper formulates {{the problem}} of {{optimizing}} power flows in <b>polyphase</b> <b>systems</b> with significant source (line) impedance. The problem is stated in a Hilbert space, and then solved explicitly for {{the case of a}} linear line and load. Properties of the solution are illustrated on the example of an asymmetrical three-phase induction motor supplied with unbalanced non-sinusoidal voltages. While the optimal compensator current depends on explicit knowledge of numerous network and load parameters, the paper also explores an alternative close-to-optimal solution which gener-alizes the Fryze compensator and relies only on knowledge of load voltage and current, thus being easier to implement in practice. ...|$|R
50|$|When {{using the}} method of {{symmetrical}} components, separate one-line diagrams are made {{for each of the}} positive, negative and zero-sequence systems. This simplifies the analysis of unbalanced conditions of a <b>polyphase</b> <b>system.</b> Items that have different impedances for the different phase sequences are identified on the diagrams. For example, in general a generator will have different positive and negative sequence impedance, and certain transformer winding connections block zero-sequence currents. The unbalanced system can be resolved into three single line diagrams for each sequence, and interconnected to show how the unbalanced components add in each part of the system.|$|R
40|$|Compressional and {{shear wave}} {{velocities}} of water-saturated rhyolite, granite and diabase were measured {{as a function}} of temperature near the melting point of ice. Although such porous rocks as the Carleton rhyolite have a large velocity-hysteresis, the hysteresis in low porosity rocks, such as Troy granite, is negligible. Such low porosity rocks are suitable specimens for the simulation of the effects of partial melting. The change of effective bulk modulus of the rocks occurs only in a narrow range of temperature near the melting point of ice, while the change of effective shear modulus occurs gradually over a wider range of temperature. Except for the elastic anomaly, the variation of elasticity in the rocks can be explained by Walsh's equations with an assumed aspect ratio of the inclusions equal to 0. 002. While no elastic anomalies are found in polycrystals, the elastic anomaly in water-saturated rocks is found near the melting temperature of ice. The anomaly is attributed to the existence of liquid on the boundary between rock and ice due to local stresses and anomalous melting of ice under pressure. We predict that an elastic anomaly will exist in any <b>polyphase</b> <b>system</b> near the melting temperature (T_m) of the inclusions whenever aT_m/aP< 0. We speculate that the origin of the low velocity zone in the upper mantle may be an elastic anomaly of a <b>polyphase</b> <b>system</b> because the melting temperature of some silicatewater system is close to the geotherm and decreases with an increase of pressure...|$|R

50|$|Any <b>polyphase</b> <b>system,</b> {{by virtue}} of the time {{displacement}} of the currents in the phases, makes it possible to easily generate a magnetic field that revolves at the line frequency. Such a revolving magnetic field makes polyphase induction motors possible. Indeed, where induction motors must run on single-phase power (such as is usually distributed in homes), the motor must contain some mechanism to produce a revolving field, otherwise the motor cannot generate any stand-still torque and will not start. The field produced by a single-phase winding can provide energy to a motor already rotating, but without auxiliary mechanisms the motor will not accelerate from a stop when energized.|$|R
