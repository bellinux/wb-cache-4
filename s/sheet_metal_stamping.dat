40|$|Forming {{simulation}} has now {{reached an}} acceptable level of accuracy. It is possible to predict the hardening, the thinning and required forces for <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>stamped</b> parts {{and it is also}} possible to predict the geometrical defects such as springback, wrinkling and surface appearance problems. <b>Sheet</b> <b>metal</b> forming can therefore be used in a closed loop to help design of parts and required tools in order to achieve a pre-defined geometry and mechanical performance. The paper presents a practical optimization methodology applied to automotive <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>stamped</b> parts. The goal is to automatically optimize tool geometry in order to achieve an optimal part. An optimal part is regarded as a part free of defects. The defects are classified in two categories: material and geometrical. Material defects prevent the forming of the parts which can be {{in the form of a}} premature failure or an excessive wrinkling. The geometrical defects prevent the formed part from being assembled to the body structure and are generally referred as “springback”. In order to establish this optimization methodology, available tools for optimization and automatic geometry modification were coupled to LS-DYNA [1]. A special attention was paid to the definition of the optimization problem: appropriate selection of design variables, definition of the response functions in order to characterize the possible part defects (material or geometrical) and specification of the required physical constraints. The developed methodology will be demonstrated on actual automotive components Keywords...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{describes}} an expert system developed for assisting die designers for design of blanking dies for <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> operations. The production rule-based expert system approach is utilized {{for development of}} the system. The proposed system labelled as INTBDIE is organized in form of twelve modules. Modules are coded in AutoLISP language and designed to be loaded into the prompt area of AutoCAD. For consultation, the user loads the system into the prompt area of AutoCAD. The proposed system generates friendly prompt eliciting from the user for data pertaining to the job. The recommendations imparted by the system for design of blanking die are automatically stored in various output data files which are further utilized for automatic modelling of die components and die assembly. This arrangement facilitates interfacing of design with drafting and can be operated on a PC/AT. The knowledge base of the proposed system can be modified depending upon the capabilities of a specific shop floor. As the system can be implemented on a PC having AutoCAD software, therefore its low cost of implementation makes it affordable for small and medium-sized stamping industries.

Therefore, the current standard P226 has a Nitron coated, stainless steel slide.

50|$|The m/45 SMG was {{developed}} in 1944-45, with a design borrowing from and also improving on many design elements of earlier submachine guns. The <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>stamping</b> techniques used in making the German MP 40, the British Sten, and the Soviet PPSh-41 and PPS-43 were studied in detail. Two designs were tested in 1944, one from Carl Gustafs Stads Gevärsfaktori and one from Husqvarna Vapenfabrik AB and the prototype from Carl Gustafs Stads Gevärsfaktori was chosen for further development. The first production version was adopted in 1945 as the Kpist m/45. The Danish Hovea M/49 SMG, although similar in appearance, is not a version derived from the m/45. The Hovea was a development of the failed test contender (fm44) from Husqvarna Vapenfabrik AB.|$|E

50|$|Mark 3/3A: Quick-change barrel. Currently the Mark 3 variant is {{available}} in two different barrel lengths, a standard and short. The short barrel is designed for use with paratroopers and special forces. There is also an optional 10.5 in VIP protection barrel. The barrel on all versions has a slotted flash suppressor and a carrying handle used to transport the weapon and assist in barrel removal. The Ultimax Mark 3 has a three-position gas regulator (early models had a five-position gas adjustment valve) that allows the rate of fire to be controlled and enables reliable operation in various environmental conditions. The gas regulator is usually pre-adjusted prior to operations. Where there is sluggish operation due to fouling, the gas setting may be increased by two clicks using the provided C-tool. The weapon features a standard pistol grip, a vertical forward grip integrated into the forend and a detachable buttstock. The mild felt recoil allows the weapon to be used effectively without the buttstock, using only the pistol and forward grips to support and aim the firearm. The adjustable bipod has a height adjustment mechanism and is secured to the weapon's forend, providing stability in a sustained-fire role. The bipod is quick-detachable and can be mounted or removed {{without the use of}} tools. The Ultimax 100 features an aperture type rear sight (with range settings for distances up to 1,200 m, graduated every 100 m) placed on a sliding scale and a forward vertical post housed in the front sight base and protected by two metal tabs. The weapon incorporates <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>stamping</b> and the use of synthetic components in its design. The drum magazine, buttstock, pistol grip and forend with vertical grip are all made of an impact-resistant polymer. The Mark 3/3A can fire both the American 5.56×45mm M193 cartridge (with 1:12 (305 mm) twist barrel fitted) or the heavier Belgian SS109/M855 cartridge (178 mm (1:7 in) twist rate barrel).|$|E

25|$|Constructed of {{light-gauge}} painted sheet steel, Joroleman designed his mailbox with an arched, tunnel-shape roof, which prevented excessive {{accumulation of}} rainwater or snow while resisting deformation. The tunnel top also simplified {{the process of}} mass production by {{eliminating the need for}} precise <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> bends. <b>Stamped</b> and formed <b>metal</b> straps riveted to the arched opening and the mailbox door served as a door latching mechanism, while a rotating red semaphore flag mounted on a shaft attached {{to the side of the}} mailbox served to signal the approaching mailman if there was outgoing mail inside. Fitted with a crimped or braze-on rear steel panel and a false floor to keep its contents dry in inclement or humid weather, the Joroleman mailbox required only two rivets, three axle bolts, and four screws and nuts for completion. Durable and inexpensive, the popularity of the Joroleman mailbox was further enhanced by a decision not to patent the design, but to make its specifications known to all potential manufacturers for competitive sale. Adopted across the United States, it has remained the top-selling mailbox since its introduction, and was also widely used in Canada prior to that country's decision to eliminate individual curbside delivery to rural residents.|$|R
40|$|The hot {{stamping}} and cold die quenching process is increasingly adopted to form complex-shaped structures of <b>sheet</b> <b>metals</b> in the automotive industry. However, {{it is difficult}} to obtain formability data of <b>sheet</b> <b>metals</b> under hot <b>stamping</b> conditions by using conventional experimental testing methods. In this study, a novel in-plane biaxial testing system, which is attached to a Gleeble materials thermo-mechanical simulator, had been developed for determining forming limit diagrams (FLDs) under {{hot stamping}} conditions. However, there is no standard of cruciform specimen geometries available for this type of biaxial tests. In this paper, the features of thickness reduction in the central region and slots in the arms of a type of cruciform specimen of aluminium alloy 6082 were verified first to increase strain uniformity of the biaxial loading zone on a cruciform specimen, based on the selective heating and cooling method. Finite Element (FE) thermo-electrical and thermo-mechanical models with UAMP and VUMAT subroutines were then implemented in ABAQUS 6. 12 to optimise specimen dimensions so that fracture occurs in the concerned central region of the specimen during testing. By the use of the optimised specimen for AA 6082 in the biaxial testing system, formability tests under the designated strain paths were conducted at specified hot stamping conditions. Strain fields in the gauge region of the cruciform specimens were measured using the digital image correlation (DIC) system and the experimental results were presented and analysed in order to verify the cruciform specimen design...|$|R
