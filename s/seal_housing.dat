40|$|Abstract: The {{development}} of reciprocating hydraulic seals radically decreased {{the efficiency and}} immensely reduced the <b>seal</b> <b>housing</b> volumes and also the overall economy of high pressure hydraulic drives. To reveal tribological behaviour of reciprocating seals {{it is necessary to}} analyse the relationships of seal design, tribological features and the main operating characteristics. For environmental protection leakage control has great importance. Leakage calculation of reciprocating high pressure hydraulic seals is based on the sealing pressure distribution profiles, i. e. diagrams which are playing an important role in research and {{development of}} piston and piston rod seals too. Key words: tribology of seals, reciprocating hydraulic seals, piston and piston rod seals, efficiency of friction seals, seal design. 1...|$|E

40|$|A {{modified}} circumferential {{segmented ring}} seal {{was designed for}} direct replacement of a helicopter transmission elastomeric lip seal operating on a shaft diameter of 13. 91 centimeters (5. 481 in.) at sliding velocities to 52. 48 m/sec (10 330 ft/min). The modifications involved the garter spring tension, shaft roundness, <b>seal</b> <b>housing</b> flatness, and pumping grooves to inhibit leakage. Operation of the seals in bench tests under simulated helicopter transmission conditions revealed that the seal leakage rate was within acceptable limits and that the wear rate was negligible. The low leakage and wear rates were confirmed in flight tests of 600 and 175 hours (sliding speed, 48. 11 m/sec (9470 ft/min)). An additional 200 hours of air worthiness qualification testing (aircraft tie down) demonstrated that the seal can operate at the advanced sliding conditions of 52. 48 m/sec (10 330 ft/min) ...|$|E
40|$|Vibration dampers {{have been}} invented that are {{incorporated}} as components within the stationary labyrinth seal assembly. These dampers {{are intended to}} supplement other vibration-suppressing features of labyrinth seals {{in order to reduce}} the incidence of high-cycle-fatigue failures, which have been known to occur in the severe vibratory environments of jet engines and turbopumps in which labyrinth seals are typically used. A vibration damper of this type includes several leaf springs and/or a number of metallic particles (shot) all held in an annular seal cavity by a retaining ring. The leaf springs are made of a spring steel alloy chosen, in conjunction with design parameters, to maintain sufficient preload to ensure effectiveness of damping at desired operating temperatures. The cavity is vented via a small radial gap between the retaining ring and <b>seal</b> <b>housing.</b> The damping mechanism is complex. In the case of leaf springs, the mechanism is mainly friction in the slippage between the <b>seal</b> <b>housing</b> and individual dampers. In the case of a damper that contains shot, the damping mechanism includes contributions from friction between individual particles, friction between particles and cavity walls, and dissipation of kinetic energy of impact. The basic concept of particle/shot vibration dampers has been published previously; what is new here is the use of such dampers to suppress traveling-wave vibrations in labyrinth seals. Damping effectiveness depends on many parameters, including, but not limited to, coefficient of friction, mode shape, and frequency and amplitude of vibrational modes. In tests, preloads of the order of 6 to 15 lb (2. 72 to 6. 8 kilograms) per spring damper were demonstrated to provide adequate damping levels. Effectiveness of shot damping of vibrations having amplitudes from 20 to 200 times normal terrestrial gravitational acceleration (196 to 1, 960 meters per square second) and frequencies up to 12 kHz was demonstrated for shot sizes from 0. 032 to 0. 062 in.

40|$|The leaf seal, a seal {{comprising}} multiple flexible elements, offers similar leakage to a brush seal, but {{may have}} other benefits {{that make it}} a more attractive option in some applications. This paper details an experimental investigation of the leakage and stiffness {{of a pair of}} prototype leaf seals carried out in a slow speed rotating rig at differential pressures of up to 0, 4 MPa. The stiffness is characterised by measuring the force required to create excursions of the housing relative to the seal. The results are presented in terms of the effective annular clearance of an idealised labyrinth seal. For a single seal design, in which contact between the leaf tips causes inherent damping in the seal, the effect of changes in <b>seal</b> <b>housing</b> geometry are reported. The results observed are explained with reference to the flow field in the leaf pack. Copyright © 2008 by ASME...|$|E

40|$|Brush seals are {{comprised}} of fine diameter fibers densely packed between retaining and backing plates. To achieve seal compliance bristles {{are arranged to}} contact rotor with some lay angle. When axial pressure load is applied, bristles interlock and get stuck at the backing plate, and seal stiffness varies under operating conditions. Operating stiffness is critical to determine seal-rotor contact pressure and wear life. Typically, seal stiffness is measured by pressing a curved shoe to brush bore as reported in open literature. Due to the complex nature of pressure-stiffness bristle behavior, static and unpressurized measurements cannot represent actual working seal stiffness. This work presents a brush seal stiffness measurement system {{that is capable of}} measuring seal stiffness under working pressure and speed conditions. Rotor speed is achieved by an integrated spindle drive, while contact forces are measured via sensitive load cells. Rotor excursions are applied through lateral motions of the <b>seal</b> <b>housing</b> that is actuated by a motorized linear slide. Stiffness testing methodology and calibration procedure are discussed. Comparative experimental data are presented for both static pressurized and dynamic-pressurized stiffness tests...|$|E
40|$|Compliant {{contacting}} filament seals such as {{brush seals}} {{are well known}} to give improved leakage performance and hence specific fuel consumption benefit compared to labyrinth seals. The design of the brush seal must be robust {{across a range of}} operating pressures, rotor speeds, and radial build-offset tolerances. Importantly the wear characteristics of the seal must be well understood to allow a secondary air system suitable for operation over the entire engine life to be designed. A test rig at the University of Oxford is described which was developed for the testing of brush seals at engine-representative speeds, pressures, and <b>seal</b> <b>housing</b> eccentricities. The test rig allows the leakage, torque, and temperature rise in the rotor to be characterized as functions of the differential pressure(s) across the seal and the speed of rotation. Tests were run on two different geometries of bristle pack with conventional, passive, and active pressure-balanced backing ring configurations. Comparison of the experimental results indicates that the hysteresis inherent in conventional brush seal design could compromise performance (due to increased leakage) or life (due to exacerbated wear) as a result of reduced compliance. The inclusion of active pressure-balanced backing rings in the seal designs are shown to alleviate the problem of bristle–backing ring friction, but this is associated with increased blow-down forces which could result in a significant seal-life penalty. The best performing seal was concluded to be the passive pressure-balanced configuration, which achieves the best compromise between leakage and seal torque. Seals incorporating passive pressure-balanced backing rings are also shown to have improved heat transfer performance in comparison to other design...|$|E
40|$|Improvements upon current {{gas turbine}} sealing {{technology}} performance {{are essential for}} decreasing specific fuel consumption to meet stringent future efficiency targets. The clearances between rotating and static components of a gas turbine, which need to be sealed, vary over a flight cycle. Hence, a seal which can passively maintain an optimum clearance, whilst preventing contact between itself and the rotor, is extremely desirable. Various configurations of a Rolls Royce (RR) seal concept, the Large Axial Movement Face Seal (LAMFS), use static pressure forces to locate face seals. Prototypes were tested experimentally at the Osney Thermofluids Laboratory, Oxford. Firstly a proof-of concept rig (simulating a 2 -D seal cross-section) manufactured by RR was re-commissioned. The simplest configuration using parallel seal faces induced an unstable <b>seal</b> <b>housing</b> behaviour. The author used this result, CFD, and analytical methods to improve the design and provide a self-centring ability. A fully annular test rig of this new seal concept was then manufactured to simulate a 3 D engine representative seal. The full annulus eliminated leakage paths unavoidable in the simpler rig. A parametric program of experiments was designed to identify geometries and conditions which favoured best-practice design. The new seal design {{is in the process}} of being patented by Rolls Royce. A 'fluidic' seal was also investigated, showing very promising results. A test rig was manufactured so that a row of jets could be directed across a leakage cross-flow. An experimental program identified parameters which could achieve a combined lower leakage mass flow rate compared with the original leakage. Influence of jet spanwise spacing, injection angle, jet to mainstream pressure ratio, mainstream pressure difference and channel height were analysed. It is hoped this thesis can be used as a tool to further improve these seal concepts from the parametric trends which were identified experimentally.

40|$|Different {{wave power}} {{technologies}} are in development {{around the world}} in different stages of prototype testing. So far only a few devices have been deployed offshore at full scale for extended periods of time. Little data is published about how these different devices perform. This thesis presents results from experiments with the full-scale offshore wave energy converters at the Lysekil research site on the Swedish west coast. The theories, experiments, measurements, performance evaluations and developments of the submerged transmission in the direct driven permanent magnet linear generator are in focus. The reciprocating submerged transmission fulfills the purpose of transmitting the absorbed mechanical wave energy through the capsule wall into the generator, while preventing the seawater from entering the capsule and reducing the life time of the converter. A measuring system with seven laser triangulation sensors has been developed to measure small relative displacements between piston rod and <b>seal</b> <b>housing</b> in the submerged transmission with excellent accuracy for the purpose of evaluating both functional behavior and successive wear in-situ. A method for calculating relative tilt angles, azimuth angles, differential tilt angles, and successive wear in the submerged transmission has been developed. Additional sensors systems have been installed in the converter enabling correlation and a thorough investigation into the operating conditions of the transmission and the converter. The thesis presents unique results from the measurements. A data acquisition system transmits the signals from the converter on the seabed to an onshore measuring station. Results are presented in time-, frequency- and the time-frequency domain. The results have given important information for further development of the submerged transmission, which is important to the survivability of the system. The thesis describes the status of research, and is a step that may influence future designs of wave energy devices for reaching survivability and a cost-effective renewable energy system.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references: p. 84 - 86. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Experiments to identify stiffness and damping force coefficients of a two bladed teeth-on-stator labyrinth seal and a gas damper seal, both of diverging clearance, are presented. Calibrated impact guns excite a housing holding the test seal, and the seal displacement and acceleration time responses in two orthogonal directions are measured. A frequency domain parameter identification procedure allows the determination of the seals' dynamic force coefficients over a frequency range. Tests are made for a centered seal condition without journal rotation and with rotation at 1, 500 and 3, 000 rpm. The pressure drop across the seal is controlled by increments in the inlet supply pressure to values three times the exit (ambient) pressure. The two bladed labyrinth seal becomes less stable with increasing pressure ratio across the seal. This seal exhibits positive direct stiffness and negative direct damping. Cross-coupling is observed but identification of cross-coupled stiffnesses is poor. Comparison with analytical predictions is good for mass flow and direct damping coefficients. Predicted values for direct stiffness are negative, contrary to identified values. The same labyrinth'seal is transformed into a four pocket damper seal and tested under identical conditions. The damper seal is shown to be more stable dynamically but can create a static instability due to excessive negative direct stiffness. In the test facility used, the <b>seal</b> <b>housing</b> does not have enough direct stiffness to support the damper seal at pressure ratios greater than 2. 0. Cross-coupled stiffness is not detected in the measurements. The direct damping coefficients are positive and large in magnitude compared to those from the labyrinth seal measurements.
