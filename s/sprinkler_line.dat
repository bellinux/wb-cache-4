50|$|Sunbeam {{acquired}} Rain King Sprinkler Company {{producing a}} popular lawn <b>sprinkler</b> <b>line</b> of the 1950s and 1960s. Meanwhile, Sunbeam continued to expand outside of Chicago. By {{the end of}} the 1970s, as the leading American manufacturer of small appliances, Sunbeam enjoyed about $1.3 billion in annual sales and employed nearly 30,000 people worldwide. The John Oster Manufacturing Company was acquired in 1960 by Sunbeam Corporation. In 1981, after Sunbeam was bought by Allegheny International Inc. of Pittsburgh, most of the Chicago-area factories were closed and the headquarters moved to Downtown Pittsburgh. Under Allegheny International's ownership Sunbeam became the world's largest maker of small appliances through much of the 1980s. Allegheny International moved its headquarters into a 32 floor signature skyscraper in Pittsburgh. During this time the companies Allegheny controlled included John Zink Company (manufactured air pollution control devices) and Hanson Scale (manufactured bathroom scales and other balance machines).|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} of wheat in Al-Qassim is entirely dependent on groundwater that requires high pumping lifts {{to supply the}} irrigation requiremens. Numerous {{studies have shown that}} many wheat grow-ers over-irrigate their lands using center-pivot sprinkler irrigation systems. The most common irrigation management objective is to eliminate water as the production-limiting variable while minimizing excessive water application. The wheat yield production functions were developed to predict wheat yields for sea-sonal water application that ranged from 170 to 825 mm using the <b>sprinkler</b> <b>line</b> source technique. It was found that the yield increase was linear with the increase in applied water up to a seasonal applied water of about 500 mm. Above 500 mm, the relationship was curvilinear with the point of maximum yield at 734 mm. With the pumping cost of SR 0. 2 /cubic meter of water and SR 2000 /ton grain wheat, the optimum amount of applied water was 710 mm...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to study the effect of saline water on the yield of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L., var. longifolia Lam., cv.

40|$|Water deficit {{occurring}} after flowering in sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] predisposes {{the crop}} to stalk rot, mainly due to infection by the charcoal rot causal fungus Macrophomina phaseolina (Tassi) Goid., resulting in lodging. The line source (LS) sprinkler irrigation technique which produces a gradient of water deficit stress due to decreasing {{amount of water}} supply with increasing distance from the <b>sprinkler</b> <b>line</b> was used to study the relationships between applied water levels, time of inoculation {{and the degree of}} charcoal rot incidence. Grain yields were reduced in proportion to the deficit in water supply along the gradient, whereas the incidence of charcoal rot increased. Inoculation with the fungus increased the incidence of disease when natural incidence was low. Sorghum was more susceptible to disease during the later stages of grain filling than during the period immediately after flowering. The rows of plants farthest from the LS, which received the least irrigation, showed disease incidence earlier than those nearest, which were better watered. This was apparent {{for each of the three}} different, but highly correlated, parameters of disease spread: percentage of soft stalks; number of nodes crossed; and the length of fungal spread (cm). It is concluded that the LS is an effective method to study the quantitative relationship between severity of water stress and the degree of charcoal rot incidence during rainfree dry seasons...|$|E

A determination also was made of the uniformity of water distribution by sprinkler and furrow irrigation. Sprinkler and gravity irrigation were compared at the North Platte Agricultural Experiment Station of the University of Nebraska. The experimental plots were located in an area on the Northeast corner of the station, known as the Shelby land. The legal description of the area is the south 600 feet of the east ½ of the east ½ of the southeast ¼ of section 16, T 13 N, R 30 W. The soil on the experimental area was a Bridgeport very fine sandy loam. Eight plots, 56 by 500 feet, were used in the experiment. Four plots of Midland milo were irrigated with a portable <b>sprinkler</b> <b>line</b> and four with gated pipe into furrows. All plots except two were separated from the neighboring plots by 30 -foot strips of alfalfa An adequate water supply was available at the plot area. Water was taken from a pipeline which taps the penstock of the Platte Valley Public Power and Irrigation District power plant. A six-inch aluminum pipe line was used to take water from the field riser to the experimental plots. The line was laid along the south ends of the plots. A “T” in the main line near the plots being irrigated allowed water to be delivered to a sprinkler lateral to the gated pipe at the same time. Advisor: Paul E. Schleusene...|$|E

40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy {{announced}} it will be hosting an international public competition called the Solar Decathlon in Irvine, CA during October 2015 to showcase high-efficiency houses. Cal Poly students created a team – Solar Cal Poly – to participate. Three mechanical engineering students joined the team {{to work on the}} plumbing section of the competition. The team completed multiple iterations and designs of the plumbing system within the Solar Cal Poly house as the house was designed and redesigned. The construction and final design of the plumbing system will be decided by the construction crew and architecture team within Solar Cal Poly. The mechanical engineering design was selected with the intent to satisfy architecture design needs. There are cold and hot water PEX supply systems, a code-compliant sprinkler system, and black and grey ABS waste systems designed for easy hookup after transport to Irvine, CA. In addition to architectural design needs, structural integrity, ease of assembly, safety, durability, head loss, building code, and integration with other systems were all considered {{in the design of the}} system. Of particular importance was integration with the Solar Cal Poly water systems team. This team dictated use of the grey water captured by the plumbing system, and directly coordinated supply conditions and requirements with our team. A black-grey connection valve was designed for the plumbing system to easily divert water away from water systems as necessary. Sewage pumps were designed into the system to allow flow into grey water and septic tanks above grade. The entire system was designed for easy on-site hook up. To prevent need to travel underneath the house during competition, all hook-ups were designed along the edge of the house, to connect to pre-laid plumbing connections. Tanks were placed for easy access on-site. Plumbing supply <b>lines</b> and <b>sprinkler</b> <b>lines</b> were analyzed to ensure they will supply adequate pressure and volume.

40|$|Water application, storage, and {{distribution}} efficiencies of sprinkler and furrow methods of irrigation were compared at North Platte, Nebraska. Four plots of Midland grain sorghum were irrigated with portable <b>sprinkler</b> <b>lines</b> and four with gated pipe and furrows. Cultural practices {{were the same}} for all plots with the exception that the sprinkler plots did not receive any cultivation at the time of furrowing the plots to be furrow irrigated. The results obtained were: Runoff losses on the sprinkler plots averaged 0. 5 per cent of the water applied. On the furrow plots 6. 67 per cent of applied water ran off. Evaporation and deep percolation were assumed to be the difference between runoff loss and total water loss. These combined losses were 16. 8 per cent of the water applied on sprinkler plots and 19. 1 per cent of the applied water on furrow plots. The water application efficiency on sprinkler plots averaged 82. 7 per cent as compared to an average of 74. 2 per cent on furrow irrigated plots. The water storage efficiency on furrow irrigated plots averaged 93. 0 per cent as compared to an average of 88. 5 per cent on sprinkler plots. Water distribution efficiencies provide a direct means of comparing areas within a plot or corresponding areas of different plots to determine uniformity of water application. The average distribution efficiency lengthwise of the plots varied from 8. 2 percentage points on sprinkler plots as compared to 38. 9 percentage points on furrow irrigated plots. The average distribution efficiency across the plots varied from 8. 1 percentage points on furrow irrigated plots to 12. 7 percentage points on sprinkler plots. The average yield of grain sorghum was 69. 1 bushels per acre for furrow irrigation. The average yield of grain sorghum was 67. 6 bushels per acre for sprinkler irrigation.

40|$|Four fire {{protection}} systems have been attached to a small building model for testing their dynamic properties. Three of the systems used CPVC (fire rated) plastic pipes while the fourth was made from schedule- 40 steel pipe. The building model was securely attached to a three by three foot shake table {{in one of two}} orientations and was able to experience base accelerations along both its principle axis (longitudinal, transverse). Test procedures involved sending a sine sweep with a progressively increasing frequency at a constant acceleration value. Various recording locations provided data showing fundamental frequencies with pronounced amplification over the base input accelerations. First the buildings natural frequencies were obtained. Then each sprinkler system was tested for acceleration values at the sprinkler drops. Sprinkler drops were affixed with an accelerometer at the fitting connection and one at the sprinkler head. Comparisons are made between the fundamental frequencies of the building and the fire sprinkler system. An analytical model of the four sprinkler systems was designed on the SAP 2000 computer program. The test frequency range providing clean data was from 10 Hz – 25 Hz. In this range the computer analysis identified all of the first observed fundamental frequencies. The SAP 2000 Analysis also identified the distinct second fundamental frequencies obtained from testing. Large acceleration amplifications were observed at fundamental frequencies in the building and in the sprinkler systems. The largest amplification was sixty times that of the base input experienced by one of the CPVC drops. The steel <b>sprinkler</b> <b>line</b> also experienced large amplification values of up to 35 times the base level acceleration. The fire systems were filled with water to simulate a wet-system and to indicate potential failures. No failures occurred in any of the four test systems. After testing each sprinkler design multiple times it is concluded that sprinkler systems should remain functional following a seismic event. Sprinkler systems installed to NFPA- 13 code (National Fire Protection codebook) standards have been proven to perform in earthquakes as well as the structures they’re attached to. Improper connectors and lack of required pipe clearances are the main factors attributed to researched fire system failures...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1987 The {{effects of}} deficit irrigations and {{nitrogen}} {{rates on the}} yield and size distribution of 'Detroit Dark Red' table beets were investigated during 1985 and 1986. Beets were grown on a Chehalis silty clay loam (fine-silty, mixed, mesic Cumulic Ultic Haploxeroll) (7. 5 cm of available water per 30 cm of soil depth) at a row spacing of 60 cm. Six irrigation treatments of 8, 18, 40, 60, 76, and 95 percent of evapotranspiration during 1985 and 6, 16, 41, 63, 86, and 95 percent during 1986 were imposed by a line source overhead sprinkler system. Nitrogen treatments of 125 and 250 Kg N/Ha were randomized over plots {{on either side of}} each <b>sprinkler</b> <b>line.</b> Water production functions developed for the root or total yield versus evapotranspiration or applied water (irrigation plus rainfall) conformed to a second degree polynomial equation. There was no statistical difference between the functions for the two nitrogen rates at the 5 percent level of significance. The 1986 root yield versus evapotranspiration and root yield versus water applied functions for the higher nitrogen level were Y = - 65. 154 +. 557 ET - 6. 058 * 10 ⁻⁴ET² (R²=. 74) and Y = 20. 172 +. 156 WAT - 9. 166 * 10 ⁻⁵ WAT² (R²=. 83), respectively and did not reach maximums. Similar functions for the lower nitrogen level were Y = 17. 76 +. 212 ET - 2. 39 * 10 ⁻⁴ET² (R²=. 81) and Y = 15. 885 +. 255 WAT - 3. 547 * 10 ⁻⁴WAT² (R²=. 83), respectively. These did reach maximums of 63 and 62 MT/Ha at evapotranspiration and water applied levels of 460 and 360 mm, respectively. The 1985 root yield versus water applied for the two nitrogen levels were Y = 26. 018 +. 202 WAT - 2. 92 * 10 ⁻⁴WAT² (R²=. 83) for the higher nitrogen level and Y = 27. 591 +. 163 WAT - 2. 141 * 10 ⁻⁴WAT² (R²=. 82) for the lower nitrogen level. Neither of these functions reached maximums in the range of applied water. Evapotranspiration data were not available for 1985. Roots were graded based on their diameter into five sizes. These from the smallest to the largest were: less than 25 mm, between 26 and 44, between 45 and 70, between 71 and 95, and larger than 96 mm. The yields of the two smallest grades did not change appreciably over the ET range. The yield of the third smallest conformed to the same type of function as did the root yield and reached its maximum at about the same ET as did the root yield. The yields of the two largest grades showed an increasing trend over the ET range. The percent dry matter in roots and leaves decreased over the ET range and reached a minimum at an ET level which was somewhat less than the ET level for maximum root yield and the middle size grade yield...|$|E
40|$|Sizable {{investments}} {{have been}} made {{and continue to be}} made throughout the world to develop irrigation potentials. Recent food shortages have heightened the concern for obtaining greater returns to irrigation through improved water management and use. A knowledge of how plant growth cycles relate to moisture and salinity levels in the root zone is prerequisite to developing practical ways of maintaining optimum conditions for maximum production per unit of water concerned. This research further defines the role of irrigation timing and salinity management on crop production, and proposes practical techniques for predicting the crop response to management measures. Some of the advantages and special features of the research program outlined by the report are listed as follows: 1. The experimental design is unique in that a <b>sprinkler</b> <b>line</b> is used as a single source of water. This approach provides large volumes of yield data as influenced by water supplies available to the crop. These data will provide information on the following: a. Accurate evaluation of the basic water requirements of crops. b. The optimal sequencing of deficits during crop growth stages. c. The establishment of yield versus evapotranspiration relationships over the entire range of wter supply from rainfall (dryland) to over-irrigation. d. An evaluation of soil water holding capacities in terms of its contributions to the water needs of the crop. This information provides guidance on how to best utilize the root system of a given crop type as a water gathering tool in terms of time during the growing season. For example, planting date, plant spacing, and fertilizer practices will be influenced by this information. 2. The experimental layout is versatile in that it lends itself to a study of the effects on plant growth of input parameters other than water, such as fertility levels and plant spacing. 3. The design can be readily adapted to accommodate several varieties and/or species in the same experiment. 4. The research results are practical and generally applicable {{to a wide range of}} crop, climate, soil, and water supply (non site specific and site specific) conditions. 5. The research provides a clear demonstration (both visual and quantitative) of the beneficial effects of proper management practices on crop production. 6. The research deals with both domestic and international water problems involving crop production, namely, the influence of available soil measure and soil salinity on plant yields. 7. The research techniques are readily adaptable to application in developing countries. a. A sprinkler system for irrigation is not necessary though desireable. b. The research procedures are simple, inexpensive, easy to perform, and yet provide much information. 8. The research involves the join efforts of several institutions and utilizes highly experienced research principal investigators who have a proven record of effectively working together as an integrated team. 9. The validity of the research approach and the viability of the results have been demonstrated by current research. The main tasks remaining are to broaden the crop base and to test and demonstrate the applicability of the results to other areas throughout the world...|$|E

40|$|Breeding and {{selection}} for salt tolerance {{has been limited}} {{because of the large}} heterogeneity of natural saline soils and the lack of efficient criteria for measuring salt tolerance. Regulation of salt balances in leaves is an important aspect of salt tolerance. This work analyses the relationship between leaf ion concentrations and salt tolerance with the aim of using these traits as indicators of salt tolerance. This is done both in solution culture (hydroponics) and field trials (sprinkler irrigation with saline water). Varieties were found to differ in the amounts of ions accumulated in their leaves. However, these differences did not relate directly with their level of salt tolerance. The lack of correlation was partly due to difficulties in estimating salt tolerance in the field. Also, the Triple <b>Line</b> <b>Sprinkler</b> system (TLS) used in the field experiments posed several problems, the most important ones being related to direct ion absorption by the leaves. The high concentrations of CaC 12 (in addition to NaCl) used in the irrigation water added a further complication. In hydroponic experiments, a minimum of 2 mol in-' Ce' was enough to prevent an indiscriminate entry of Na' and to ameliorate the growth inhibition of plants growing at 200 mol in-' NaCl. Higher Caý' concentrations (50 mol in-' CaCl 2) reduced even more the concentrations of Na' in leaves without significantly affecting growth.

According to directive 2000 / 60 /EC, action is needed to protect water in qualitative and quantitative terms. Among the several actions {{that are expected to}} contribute to the protection of water is the optimization of irrigation management. In this framework irrigation professionals are challenged to achieve maximum irrigation efficiency at scheme as well as at end-user (farm or landscape setup) level. Irrigation efficiency is a complex concept at upper levels as the losses of someone could be the gains for someone else. At end-user level, irrigation audits which register and analyze information regarding water and soil characteristics, the design, installation and maintenance of the system, the available flow, the operating pressure, the application uniformity and the irrigation schedule provide a useful tool for system evaluation and maintenance, upgrade decisions. In the framework of the present work, selected case studies, part of an irrigation auditing initiative, which is in progress and will include 100 audits at the Regions of Epirus and Western Greece, are presented. Extended literature review was made in order to design the auditing procedures. Special fact sheets have been prepared and pilot audits were used in order to evaluate them and make final adjustments. The audits have been applied on a variety of agricultural irrigation systems (big guns, <b>sprinklers</b> bubblers, drip <b>lines,</b> emitters etc) as well as on sprinkler irrigation systems for landscaping setups (parks and athletic facilities).

40|$|Groundwater {{contamination}} {{has many}} sources, the routine agricultural application of fertilizers and pesticides {{are recognized as}} significant sources. This field study was initiated and designed to evaluate if there were differences among different irrigation technologies on water and solute transport under field conditions. The modes of water application were flood, <b>sprinkler</b> and drip (<b>line</b> source) with {{the same amount of}} water but different water application rates. Potassium bromide was applied along with irrigation water to assess the leaching behavior of chemicals. The three methods of water application yielded similar patterns of moisture regimes as a function of time. As the flow rate decreases, the gradual transition of moisture was observed with long peaks indicating more uniform water distribution and water availability in the case of drip irrigation. The moisture distribution for post irrigation was not significantly different with time among different irrigation systems. The moisture distribution profiles with depth were statistically different for sprinkler irrigation compared to flood and drip irrigations. There {{was no significant difference between}} flood and drip irrigations. The solute concentration distribution as a function of time exhibited solute pattern differences among irrigation methods. The concentration distribution in flood irrigation was quite different from sprinkler and drip irrigations due to high input flow rate. The post irrigation concentration distribution with time was higher in drip irrigation than those of flood and sprinkler irrigations. The solute concentration profiles in flood, sprinkler and drip irrigations showed no big differences among irrigation methods with depth up to 55 cm. But the drip irrigation had more solute retained and more uniformity in the soil profile than flood or sprinkler irrigations. The numerical model "HYDRUS" was used for the simulation of one-dimensional water flow and solute transport in flood, sprinkler and drip irrigations. The dispersivity versus solute profiles exhibited greater vertical variability with depth in flood irrigation than for sprinkler and drip irrigation. The comparative results of model simulation and field observed data for moisture distribution showed good agreement between the observed and the simulated water contents. The model prediction for solute concentration distribution also showed comparable results with field measurements...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} {{research}} on the water relations and irrigation needs of sugar cane are collated and summarized in an attempt to link fundamental studies on crop physiology to irrigation practices. Background information on the centres of production of sugar cane is followed by reviews of (1) crop development, including roots; (2) plant water relations; (3) crop water requirements; (4) water productivity; (5) irrigation systems and (6) irrigation scheduling. The majority of the recent research published in the international literature has been conducted in Australia and southern Africa. Leaf/stem extension is a more sensitive indicator of the onset of water stress than stomatal conductance or photosynthesis. Possible mechanisms by which cultivars differ in their responses to drought have been described. Roots extend in depth at rates of 5 - 18 mm d- 1 reaching maximum depths of > 4 m in ca. 300 d providing there are no physical restrictions. The Penman-Monteith equation and the USWB Class A pan both give good estimates of reference crop evapotranspiration (ETo). The corresponding values for the crop coefficient (Kc) are 0. 4 (initial stage), 1. 25 (peak season) and 0. 75 (drying off phase). On an annual basis, the total water-use (ETc) is in the range 1100 - 1800 mm, with peak daily rates of 6 - 15 mm d- 1. There is a linear relationship between cane/sucrose yields and actual evapotranspiration (ETc) over the season, with slopes of about 100 (cane) and 13 (sugar) kg (ha mm) - 1 (but variable). Water stress during tillering need not result in a loss in yield because of compensatory growth on re-watering. Water can be withheld prior to harvest for periods of time up to the equivalent of twice the depth of available water in the root zone. As alternatives to traditional furrow irrigation, drag- <b>line</b> <b>sprinklers</b> and centre pivots have several advantages, such as allowing the application of small quantities of water at frequent intervals. Drip irrigation should only be contemplated when there are well-organized management systems in place.

40|$|The {{increased}} use of domestic wastewater for irrigation purposes has stimulated a growing practice of sprinkler irrigating from oxidation ponds and other domestic wastewaters. Aerosols generated from these sprinkler irrigation systems may contain potentially hazardous pathogens. Subsequently, the aerosols can contain infective viruses which can be carried through the air to surrounding populations. Thus, a public health hazard can be created by sprinkler irrigating domestic wastewater. This study is an investigation of {{a means by which}} the virus decay rate of viruses in aerosols and the potentials hazard of sprinkler irrigation aerosol clouds may be examined. A means of injection of a human and animal virus stimulant, MS- 2 bacteriophage, is described. In addition, the factors which are known to effect the survival of viruses in aerosols are discussed. The ambient air factors that are known to effect virus survival and which are discussed include relative humidity, air temperature, solar radiation, and aerosol age. The suspending fluid factors that are known to effect virus survival and which are discussed include dissolved inorganic salt contact, dissolved organic content, filterable solids and pH. The decay rate of the aerosolized MS- 2 was measured with an all-glass impinger (AGI- 30) when the wind velocity and distance of the sampler from the sprinkler system, and the initial and final concentrations of aerosolized MS- 2 virus were known. The aerosol hazard of a domestic wastewater sprinkler irrigation system is defined in terms of the likelihood of infective aerosol particles to be inhaled and penetrate the human lung. Thus, the aerosol hazard is a function of aerosol particle size. The aerosol particle size distribution of the infective aerosol cloud was measured wit the Andersen sampler. A high and homogeneous concentration of the virus in the wastewater was insured by using pressure differentials in the <b>sprinkler</b> irrigation delivery <b>line.</b> By injecting the MS- 2 virus into the line at a constant rate along with a tracer, Bacillus subtilus var niger (Bacillus globigii) spores, the decay rate of the virus during airborne exposure to environmental factors could be determined. The decay rate was determined assuming the environmental factors had no affect on the concentration of the tracer. It was proposed that the environmental engineer, after knowing the virus decay rates under varying environmental conditions, can define buffer zones which would be required around sprinkler irrigation sites. The buffer zone would reduce the possibility of contaminating humans by prohibiting access. The usefulness of the filed technique was demonstrated and the MS- 2 was found to undergo a 33. 3 percent decay per minute in the dark (no solar radiation) at 33 percent relative humidity, 70. 6 percent dissolved organic material, 29. 4 percent dissolved inorganic salts, 30. 1 mg/ 1 filterable solids, and 17 degree C air temperature. The aerosol cloud resulting from the spray irrigation process appeared potentially hazardous because the Andersen sampler collected 84. 2 percent of the virus infective droplets in the size range that could be inhaled...|$|R
40|$|The garden, {{named after}} the {{founding}} Director of the Tussock Grasslands and Mountain Lands Institute, {{is intended to be}} educational. From the early 1970 s, a small garden plot provided a touch of character to the original Institute building, but it was in 1979 that planning began to really make headway. Landscape students at the College carried out design projects, ideas were selected and developed by Landscape architecture staff in the Department of Horticulture, Landscape and Parks, and the College approved the proposals. Construction was completed in time for spring plantings in the same year. The garden is a collection of plants to provide not only an atmosphere of natural grassland and mountain herb field, but also to attract attention to the plants that make up those associations. Because many plants are small and rather hidden among the large dominant species, a sense of atmosphere ('being among the tussocks') is of itself unlikely {{to draw attention to the}} fascinating denizens of the nooks and crannies. As has always been true, many people climb mountains and tramp through the open country without ever putting their noses to the carpet of plants at their feet. In our educational garden, the beds are therefore raised high, and no point is far from the pathway. In addition, seating enables you to view the plants at eye level. Many alpine plants demand a good supply of moisture and yet cannot withstand 'wet feet'. On mountain slopes, sub-surface water is always on the move down the slope, and so the plant is supplied without any pooling effects around its roots. In this raised garden, good drainage is provided to achieve this. There are heavy layers of gravel below the soil and a gritty mix throughout the soil. The large rocks in the garden are greywacke, and were selected from an alpine area for their form and lichen covering. The rocks create a focal point and are intended to give a sense of 'altitude' within the garden. In the centre bed, rock scree is spread over the surface to create a pavement of broken stone, and at the same time, a mulch giving a cool root run. Plant distributions are in a radial pattern around the focal rocks. Like the spokes of a wheel, they extend across pathways to the outer beds. There are seven groupings, representing the geographic spread of seven regions of the New Zealand native grassland flora. The regions and a diagram of their location in the garden are listed on page 36. Typical plants of each region were sought, and especially those that help to make the regions distinctive. The collection therefore, includes the physiognomic dominants - the larger plants that confer on a vegetation its basic form and appearance. A tall tussock grassland is very different from a short tussock grassland, although some plant species may be common to each. The same species of tussocks and mountain daisies, for example, may therefore be found growing in different regional areas in the garden. The inclusion of shrubs and small trees is a recognition that grasslands and herb fields are frequently integrated with other vegetation types. The woody species furthermore, add greatly to the landscaping use of texture, form and height within the garden. Below the vegetation canopy are the less obvious plants - diverse in their growth form and habits - cushion plants, herbs, and mats. Like all gardens, ours requires regular weeding and care is necessary that some alpine plants themselves do not become weeds by outgrowing the less vigorous species. In the summer months, regular nightly watering is controlled by an automatic <b>sprinkler</b> system. <b>Line</b> drawings by Pat Prendergast are intended as impressions of plants in the garden and should not be used elsewhere for reliable species identifications. Many of the original sketches were made in the garden itself, as plants flowered and attracted attention during the succession of seasonal changes. Others were done in the field, but illustrate plants included in the garden. The text has been written by Joy Talbot, a botanist. The emphasis is on relationships - the meanings behind the names, the natural habitats of plants (abbreviated as 'Ha' in the text) and geographic distributions (abbreviated as 'Di' in the text). The relationships between genera and the families in which they are grouped is alphabetically arranged in the annotated index. To find information on the genus of an illustrated plant, first look alphabetically for the family name. For example, to find the meaning and relationships of Celmisia, look under the family name Compositae (Daisy family), shown with the illustration for any of the Celmisia species...|$|R
