40|$|We {{investigate}} the structures, NMR chemical shifts, absorption <b>spectra,</b> <b>frontier</b> molecular orbitals, and transition density matrices of ð-stacked polyfluorenes by ab initio calculations. For F 1 -F 4, we consider two different conformations, syn and anti. The simulated 1 H NMR chemical shifts {{are in good}} agreement with the previous experiment, and the significantly upfielded chemical shifts explain that the fluorene moieties are stacked on each other. It is found that the relative stability for syn and anti conformers is almost equivalent in B 3 LYP calculations; however, the syn conformer becomes much more stable than the anti conformer in MP 2 calculations, {{which is consistent with}} the experimental finding that only the syn conformers are relevant. The vertical detachment energy, which is linearly proportional to the ionization potential, shows the same size dependence as the previous experiment. The electron attachment energy decreases exponentially as the size increases, which implies that the electron transport would be possible even for long chains such as F 3 and F 4. This was evident from the frontier molecular orbitals (HOMO and LUMO). Also, it is found that the syn conformers are very favorable for electron transport through the ð-stacked fluorene moieties.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Cu(I) catalyzed azide−alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) {{reactivity}} {{was successfully}} employed to synthesize three donor−acceptor energy transfer (EnT) arrays that contain one (Dyad), three (Tetrad) and four (Pentad) 4, 4 -difluoro- 4 -bora- 3 a, 4 a-diaza-s-indacene (BODIPY) donors con-nected to a Zn-tetraphenylporphyrin acceptor via 1, 2, 3 -triazole linkages. The photophysical {{properties of the}} three arrays, along with individual donor and acceptor chromophores, were investigated by UV−vis absorption and emission spectroscopy, fluorescence lifetimes, and density functional theory (DFT) electronic structure modeling. Comparison of the UV−vis absorption <b>spectra</b> and <b>frontier</b> molecular orbitals from DFT calculations of the three arrays with ZnTPP, ZnTTrzlP, and Trzl-BODIPY shows that the electronic structure of the chromophores is essentially unperturbed by the 1, 2, 3 -triazole linkage. Time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations on the Dyad reproduce the absorption spectra in THF and show no evidence of excited state mixing of the donor and acceptor. The BODIP...|$|R

The project’s hypotheses are structured into three related themes. The first aim is analyzing the determinants of the likelihood of adoption of macroeconomic policy regimes. The second project theme focuses on cyclicality of macroeconomic policies and accuracy in attaining inflation targets. Finally, the project tests for the behavior of two key macroeconomic variables –economic growth and inflation– focusing on their sensitivity to different macroeconomic regimes and policies. A large world database was assembled for this project from both publicly available and private databases. Data coverage extends to more than 100 countries, with annual time series extending from 1970 to 2008. A wide <b>spectrum</b> of <b>frontier</b> estimation techniques {{is applied to the}} country panel data series, appropriate for discrete-choice and continuous variable estimation. The key research results are the following. Country choice of macroeconomic policy regimes (exchange-rate regimes, money-based targeting, inflation targeting, and rule-based fiscal regimes) is explained by countries’ structural and institutional features, macroeconomic performance, financial development, and international integration. The cyclical behavior of fiscal policy reflects the quality of country institutions, financial openness, and financial development. Central bank accuracy in meeting inflation targets is also a result of domestic institutional strength and macroeconomic credibility. Long-term growth is significantly shaped by the quality of policies, financial development, foreign aid, and exchange-rate misalignment, in addition to standard growth determinants. Growth volatility is aresult of domestic macroeconomic policy volatility, external shocks, international integration, and financial development. Country inflation rates are determined by international factors and domestic determinants, including fiscal policy, institutional development, monetary and exchange-rate regimes, and financial depth and integration...|$|R

40|$|In {{a highly}} {{interdisciplinary}} field, such as organic photovoltaics (OPVs), developing a predictive {{understanding of the}} relationship between molecular structures, morphology of the photoactive layer and the ultimate device performance is the key to unlocking the vast potential of this field. Although isolated examples of high-performance organic molecules are prevalent in the literature, the reasons for their superior performance are not well understood. The function of an OPV device is dependent of four key processes: (i) light absorption, (ii) charge separation, (iii) charge transport, and (iv) charge collection. While the first three are material-dependent factors, charge collection depends {{on the nature of the}} interfaces involved. We have thus investigated a new class of semiconductor molecules based on BODIPY dyes with the aim of understanding how variations in the molecular structure affect the optoelectronic and transport properties of the molecules. ^ First-generation pi-conjugated polymers based on the BODIPY core possess broad and intense absorption <b>spectra.</b> Additionally, the <b>frontier</b> molecular orbital (FMO) energy levels of the polymers can be tuned by a judicious choice of the comonomers. Electron-deficient comonomers with electron affinities higher than that of the BODIPY core, predominantly afford n-type polymers. A unique feature of these semiconductors is their panchromatic absorption spectrum that spans throughout the visible region. Thus these polymers can be considered to be potential electron acceptors in all-polymer solar cells. ^ Copolymerization of BODIPY with electron-rich comonomers, on the other hand, only results in p-type semiconductors. Furthermore, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of these polymers is found to correlate with the ionization potential of the electron-rich monomer. Having said that, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level does not change. Thus for the first time, a correlation between theoretical calculations and experimental observations has been demonstrated for predicting the FMO energy levels of BODIPY-based semiconducting polymers. ^ Second-generation copolymers based on an unsubstituted BODIPY core retain the broad absorption characteristics of the first-generation polymers. In addition, due to reduced electron density on the BODIPY core, the HOMO energy level of the resulting polymers is reduced thereby imparting enhanced oxidative stability to these polymers. Charge transport measurements through thick films (∼ 1 micron) reveal only p-channel activity with hole mobilities comparable to some of the high-performance polymers reported in literature. Preliminary bulk-heterojunction OPV devices fabricated with these polymers show modest power conversion efficiencies. We believe that understanding the morphology of the active layer in relation to the polymer structure will help improve future molecular designs and eventually, device performance. ...|$|R
40|$|The Willard-Paris-Meade thrust is {{the oldest}} and western-most sheet to develop in the Wyoming salient of the Sevier fold-thrust belt. The 10 - 15 km thick thrust sheet was emplaced ~ 60 km eastward and {{included}} Jurassic-Triassic strata, mixed siliciclastic-carbonate upper Paleozoic strata, carbonate-rich lower Paleozoic strata, and quartzite-rich basal Cambrian to Neoproterozoic strata. Each stratigraphic interval has a distinctive detrital zircon (DZ) age signature, {{which can be used}} in provenance analysis of foreland basin fill. The thrust system had a long deformation history recorded by westward thickening and coarsening synorogenic strata. DZ U-Pb geochronology of 27 synorogenic samples collected from two transects reveals an unroofing sequence with stratigraphically consistent changes in DZ patterns. DZ spectra for the Gannett Group in {{the lower part of the}} basin fill are consistent with erosion of Mesozoic to upper Paleozoic strata. Maximum depositional ages (MDA) from limited euhedral and likely volcanic grains for the foreland basin sequence show the following for the northern transect: basal Ephraim Formation, 150 ± 2. 8 Ma (n= 10); upper Ephraim, 115. 2 ± 1. 8 Ma (n= 13); lower Bechler, 116. 2 ± 2. 3 Ma (n= 9); upper Bechler 107. 3 ± 3. 3 Ma (n= 4). These data clarify that there is not a significant unconformity at the base of the Bechler, and that the Bechler conglomerate facies at Red Mountain spans the depositional interval including the ~ 112 Ma Drainey Limestone, which is absent at Red Mountain but present elsewhere. The southern transect yields the following MDAs: Upper Gannett, 109 ± 6. 1 Ma (n= 5) and 108. 3 ± 3. 4 Ma (n= 10); Cokeville, 101. 6 ± 0. 7 Ma (n= 32); Lower Sage Junction 101. 55 ± 0. 5 Ma (n= 67); Upper Sage Junction, 101. 3 ± 0. 6 Ma (n= 29); Aspen, 98. 8 ± 0. 4 Ma (n= 51); lower Frontier, 99. 93 ± 0. 6 Ma (n= 21); upper Frontier, 95. 68 ± 1. 4 Ma (n= 38). DZ spectra for the Bear River and Aspen formations in the middle part of the basin fill are consistent with erosion of mostly Paleozoic bedrock. DZ <b>spectra</b> in the <b>Frontier</b> Formation in the upper part of the basin fill are consistent with increased erosion of basal Cambrian and Neoproterozoic quartzites. The early history of deposition is elusive due to the potential bias from the early Cretaceous Sierran magmatic lull and a lack of datable materials related to corollary studies...|$|R
