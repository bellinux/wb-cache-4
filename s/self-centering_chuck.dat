50|$|A <b>self-centering</b> <b>chuck,</b> {{also known}} as a , uses dogs (usually called jaws), {{interconnected}} via a scroll gear (scroll plate), to hold onto a tool or workpiece. Because they most often have three jaws, the term three-jaw chuck without other qualification is understood by machinists to mean a self-centering three-jaw chuck. The term universal chuck also refers to this type. These chucks are best suited to grip circular or hexagonal cross-sections when very fast, reasonably accurate (±0.005 inch mm TIR) centering is desired.|$|E
50|$|Typically collets offer {{higher levels}} of {{precision}} and accuracy than <b>self-centering</b> <b>chucks,</b> and have a shorter setting up time than independent-jaw chucks. The penalty is that most collets can only accommodate a single size of workpiece. An exception is the ER collet which typically has a working range of 1 mm (about 0.04 in).|$|R
50|$|<b>Self-centering</b> <b>chucks</b> {{with four}} jaws {{also can be}} obtained. Although these are often said to suffer from two disadvantages: {{inability}} to hold hex stock, and poor gripping on stock which is oval, only the latter is true. Even with three jaw self centering chucks, work which is not of uniform section along the work (and which is not free of spiral or 'wind') should not be gripped, as the jaws can be strained and the accuracy permanently impaired.|$|R
5000|$|There are hybrid <b>self-centering</b> <b>chucks</b> {{that have}} {{adjustment}} screws {{that can be}} used to further improve the concentricity after the workpiece has been gripped by the scroll jaws. This feature is meant to combine the speed and ease of the scroll plate's self-centering with the run-out eliminating controllability of an independent-jaw chuck. The most commonly used name for this type is a brand name, Set-Tru. To avoid undue genericization of that brand name, suggestions for a generic name have included [...] "exact-adjust".|$|R
5000|$|The four most {{commonly}} used workholding devices are the three-jaw chuck, the four-jaw chuck, the collet, and the faceplate. The three-jaw chuck is used to hold round or hex workpieces because the work is automatically centered. On these chucks the runout faces limitations; on late-model CNCs, it can be quite low if all conditions are excellent, but traditionally it is usually at least [...]001-.003 in (0.025-0.075 mm). The four-jaw chuck is used either to hold irregular shapes or to hold round or hex to extremely low runout (with time spent indicating and clamping each piece), in both cases because of its independent action on each jaw. The face plate is also used for irregular shapes. Collets combine <b>self-centering</b> <b>chucking</b> with low runout, but they involve higher costs.|$|R

The scroll plate is rotated within the chuck body by the key, the scroll engages the teeth {{on the underside of}} the jaws which moves the three jaws in unison, to tighten or release the workpiece.|$|R
50|$|Austin F. Cushman (June 18, 1830 - November 29, 1914) {{invented the}} <b>self-centering</b> Cushman {{universal}} <b>chuck</b> in 1862; his father-in-law, Simon Fairman, had previously invented the lathe chuck.|$|R
50|$|A {{drill chuck}} is a {{specialised}} <b>self-centering,</b> three-jaw <b>chuck,</b> usually with capacity of 0.5 in or less and rarely greater than 1 in, {{used to hold}} drill bits or other rotary tools. This type of chuck is used on tools ranging from professional equipment to inexpensive hand and power drills for domestic use; it is the type a person who does not normally work with machine tools {{is most likely to}} be familiar with.|$|R
50|$|Simon Fairman (1792-1857) of West Stafford, Connecticut, is {{credited}} as having invented the scroll-type lathe chuck in 1830; his son-in-law, Austin F. Cushman invented the <b>self-centering</b> Cushman Universal <b>Chuck.</b> He was issued a patent for his design by the US Patent Office on July 18, 1840.|$|R
50|$|Commercial {{production}} machining {{now makes}} use of increasingly advanced chucks which have not only indexable positioning but also indexable clamping. Both functions are typically hydraulically controlled. The clamping is often done with each pair of jaws consisting of one fixed jaw and one movable jaw (hydraulically actuated), thematically similar to advanced milling vises. This method of clamping brings the high precision and repeatability of such vises to a chucking application. Such chucks offer the centering precision of traditional independent-jaw chucks with the chucking speed and ease of traditional three-jaw <b>self-centering</b> scroll <b>chucks.</b> They have expensive initial cost (compared with traditional chucks), but such initial cost pays for itself and then lowers ongoing marginal costs in commercial production-run environments.|$|R
50|$|Heavy-duty tire changers require larger {{equipment}} {{because these}} changers deal with larger, heavier tires and wheels. Heavy-duty tire changers {{can work with}} some wheels up to 56 inches in diameter and tires up to 90.5 inches in diameter and 43 inches wide. Heavy-duty tire changers are used for agricultural, off-road and construction vehicles. However, now, bigger versions of the heavy-duty tire changers are designed to mount/demount tires up to 95 inches in diameter and also features a hydraulically operated <b>self-centering</b> four jaw <b>chuck</b> with clamping jaws that can clamp from 14 to 58 inches either from the wheel’s inside or from the center bore.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this poster is to develop an {{automated}} production layout along with its design for above mentioned subject. The research work includes designing the fixture for holding the bottle while capping and three-finger self-centering gripper for placing and moving the bottle to and fro from guideways to the bottle bottom holder and vice versa. Suggesting an automated system and technology for checking the water level in bottle and effectively removing such bottles from assembly line would also {{be one of the}} objectives of this poster. Tools like automated torque wrench, precision indexing conveyor belts, three-finger <b>self-centering</b> grippers, three-jaw <b>chuck</b> (bottle holding fixture), infrared level detection sensors have been used in this system. FEA analysis of three-finger gripper and three-jaw chuck is done to verify their design. The components of this system are designed using Creo Parametric 2. 0. Designed components are analyzed using ANSYS Workbench 16. 0...|$|R
5000|$|A Pest in the House is an {{animated}} short film released on August 2, 1947. It {{is directed by}} Chuck Jones and stars the characters of Daffy Duck and Elmer Fudd. The title is an appropriate play on [...] "a guest in the house." [...] The film is notable for featuring a sort of [...] "in-between" [...] interpretation of Daffy. He {{is not necessarily the}} zany, impish interpretation used famously by Tex Avery and Bob Clampett, nor is he the greedy, <b>self-centered</b> version that <b>Chuck</b> Jones later popularized in the 1950s. As Paul Dini said in the DVD audio commentary for this cartoon: [...] "this cartoon, Daffy is really kind of almost like a sprite. He's just a little, almost elfin creature who's not really out to hurt anybody or has any ill will or malice toward anybody. He's just completely out of his mind." ...|$|R
50|$|Similarly, Connecticut {{industry}} became {{well known}} in allied fields. Hardware and tools continue to be manufactured by Stanley Corporation in New Britain, despite having almost moved elsewhere for financial reasons. Connecticut was a major area for development and manufacture of machine tools. In 1818, Simeon North designed America's first milling machine. Machinist Elisha Root first designed machinery for the Collins Company of Collinsville which manufactured axes which became world-famous, then was hired by Colt in 1849 to modernize firearm production by designing precision drop hammers, boring machines, gauges, jigs, etc., and improving the milling machines designed by Francis A. Pratt for the George S. Lincoln company in Hartford; the resulting Lincoln miller became world-famous, selling over 150,000 machines. Another Colt engineer, William Mason, patented 125 inventions for manufacture of firearms, as well as steam pumps and power looms. Christopher Spencer invented the automatic turret lathe (which in its small- to medium-sized form {{is known as a}} screw machine) for machining screws, as well as the variable cam cylinder used to control the turret. Francis A. Pratt and Amos Whitney invented a thread milling machine in 1865; Whitney also perfected various measurement instruments, and Pratt designed the aforementioned original milling machine manufactured by the George S. Lincoln company of Hartford. Simon Fairman invented the lathe chuck in West Stafford in 1830, and his son-in-law, Austin F. Cushman, invented the <b>self-centering</b> Cushman Universal <b>Chuck</b> in 1862. Edward P. Bullard designed the vertical boring mill in 1883. Charles E. Billings perfected the drop hammer for metal forging in the 1870s and designed the copper commutator central to the operation of electrical generators and motors. Edwin R. Fellows of Torrington in 1896 designed and built a new type of gear shaper and founded the Fellows Gear Shaper Company, which made a vital contribution to the manufacture of effective and reliable gear transmissions for the nascent automotive industry. The name Bridgeport on machine tools continues to be a guarantee of high quality around the world, for people who have no idea that the machinery is named after a city in Connecticut. Even the world of toys was dominated by the A. C. Gilbert Company, manufacturers of Erector Sets as well as other educational toys such as chemistry sets, microscopes, toy trains, etc.|$|R
