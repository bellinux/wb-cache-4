40|$|Lecturepg. 17 Since the {{introduction}} of noncontacting, gas lubricated, dual pressurized mechanical seals for process pumps over five years ago, and they have primarily been applied to ANSI pumps and other applications where the barrier pressure was below 300 psig. This pressure limit was not due to a limitation in material strength or face pattern technology as noncontacting seals have been applied in compressors at pressures well above this. The challenge came in fitting a dual pressurized cartridge seal into the limited size seal cavity available in most process pumps. The radial and axial dimensions of a pump seal chamber limit {{the size and shape}} of the seal faces as well as the supporting hardware needed to make a convenient cartridge seal design. A pressure responsive primary sealing ring geometry has been developed to allow a dual pressurized <b>sealing</b> <b>arrangement</b> to routinely handle pressures up to 600 psig. This pressure capability enables the dual pressurized gas seal to be utilized in applications generally found in the API market where contacting liquid lubricated seals are commonly used options.

40|$|LectureThe use of CO 2 for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) {{has been}} around since the early 70 ?s and was {{developed}} to enable oil extraction from declining fields. The process involves injecting CO 2 from either natural or man-made sources into the ground to free up trapped crude oil that would otherwise not be possible to obtain. This process significantly improves the lifetime production of oil from mature fields. Moving the CO 2 from one field to another is accomplished through a series of pipelines and pumps using centrifugal technology. In the early days of this process, pumps were sealed using double pressurized mechanical seals. This particular <b>sealing</b> <b>arrangement</b> was selected because of the very poor lubricating qualities of CO 2, the desire for high reliability, and the lack of capability to seal this fluid in the liquid state using a single seal. The downside to this arrangement was the cost and complexity. This paper will focus on new technology that allows for contacting seal faces with minimal seal face temperature rise, minimal wear, and leakage almost an order of magnitude less than non-contacting gas seal technology. Details of the design, testing and successful field application of a contacting type liquid seal using engineered seal face micro features in a CO 2 pipeline application are presented...|$|E
40|$|Master's thesis in Offshore technologyThe main {{objective}} of this thesis is to evaluate challenges in satisfying rules and regulations set by regulatory bodies, constrains related to the well status {{as well as the}} limitation of technology available to perform plugging and abandonment activities. IOSS and NCA have joined resources in development of state of the art technology especially for full commercialization in P&A operations. It is required to provide suitable technical solutions to show to the authority that P&A for shut in well category 2 & 3 can normally be performed safely and successfully by fit for purpose intervention facilities as accomplished by drilling rigs. This will be a favorable solution for oil operating companies taking into consideration their determination toward IOR philosophy for subsea wells. Safety authorities require a good quality of P&A operation that provides an eternal <b>sealing</b> <b>arrangement</b> to isolate reservoir fluids migration up to the sea surface. Therefore primary strategy was to establish a clear understanding of the state of a shut in well to be abandoned and the means to establish barriers to control well pressure prior to commencement of the P&A campaign as required by the authorities. A thorough study of guidelines related to selection and location of WBE is dealt with, especially the technology available for deployment of tools downhole when setting plugs. This forms the design bases for top side equipment capability needed for handling heavy lifts of subsea WCP packages, SLIS or riser system and BHA while performing P&A activities. Based on evaluation {{of the state of the}} art of technology available today and exploration of the scope of work required to be accomplished on P&A operation for shut in well category 1 to 3, it is recommended that permanent abandonment by use of small intervention facilities be done since is as well economically a viable solution. The major constrain in this work was the limitation in acquiring technical information for P&A operation since most of the information and experience available is not well shared in the industry and lack of supporting literature. It was necessary to gather technical information from experienced personnel who directly have been involved or performed P&A operations. This was a challenge and led into set back in the thesis work since most of the crew dealing with WOI operations was located offshore...|$|E
40|$|Lecturepg. 69 There {{has been}} a rapid growth in the {{application}} of noncontacting double seals with a gas buffer fluid to pump sealing. The advantages of such a <b>sealing</b> <b>arrangement</b> are: ?	There is no liquid buffer fluid to maintain or dispose of. ?	Gas buffer fluid causes a minimum of contamination to the process. ?	There are no emissions, so no monitoring may be required. ?	Friction power is only a fraction of that associated with liquid seals. ?	Because there is no contact, seal life can be several times that of a liquid/contacting seal. One of the limitations of a conventional double seal arrangement, be it gas or liquid, is that there must be either considerable axial length or considerable diametral space available. There are many pump applications that could benefit from a double gas buffered sealing system where space is severely limited. Thus, {{there is a need for}} a small size double gas sealing device. The double gas seal with coplanar coaxial Rayleigh pad faces has two gas sealing faces concentrically located on the same plane. Buffer gas is supplied to an annular groove between the two sealing faces. The outside gas seal leaks to process and the inside gas seal leaks to atmosphere. Both faces have Rayleigh step pad lifting surfaces as well as a sealing dam similar to a conventional gas seal. The process fluid is to the outside of the outer seal face so as to minimize process fluid contamination of the gas seal face. With the configuration described, the double gas seal with coplanar coaxial faces can be made into a small package that fits entirely into a seal gland, which itself has minimum dimensions. Thus this seal will fit to most conventional small bore ANSI pumps, and this makes it possible to apply double gas sealing technology to many existing process pumps. In this paper, the theory of the double gas seal with coplanar coaxial faces is described. Considerable design work was required to find useable shapes and balance moments on the seal so that the inside and outside sealing gaps stay open under variable process and gas supply pressures. Optimization of the Rayleigh step pad bearings was performed. A complete simulation model was developed. Deflection results and predicted performance (leakage) are presented. Extensive testing has been conducted, and the paper presents predicted and measured leakage as a function of process and gas pressure. Loss-of-gas testing has also been performed, and these results are presented. Several field tests have been initiated and these are described. Observation so far has been that the seal performs as expected, so the double gas seal with coplanar coaxial faces can be used to provide double gas sealing solutions for many pumps having limited available space...|$|E

They can convert solar radiation into electricity by supplying heat to a thermodynamic cycle. In particular, air-cooled solar central receivers can power gas turbine engines for electrical generation. Solar heating of the compressed air is realized in a pressurized volumetric receiver. A new type of receiver module consists of an insulated pressure vessel, closed by a quartz glass window and a mixture of small particles in air as working medium. The process {{has so far been}} investigated mainly in Spain, Israel, Germany and United States with different designs with varying power outputs, all below 400 kW. However, the critical part of the whole assembly is the window which transmits solar flux into the receiver. To overcome the drawbacks of the previously designed windows a new geometry was developed and an appropriate method of building it economically and commercially is suggested. The main focus of this project is to analyze different materials obtainable from the market, Optimize the window design of one large window and Ideal mounting arrangement. A part of this work is carried out by using Finite Element Analysis of quartz glass windows of different shapes using the commercial software Hypermesh and Solidworks. The analysis will be performed taking in to account the load and boundary conditions for the window design. The operating conditions for the receiver will provide a uniform 5 bar pressure distribution on the window. The high pressure makes receiver window design difficult, further analysis was done with considering different <b>seal</b> <b>arrangements</b> for window design and a better <b>seal</b> <b>arrangement</b> with reduced stresses on to the window is suggested.

40|$|Lubricating grease is {{commonly}} applied to lubricate e. g. rolling bearings, seals and gears. Grease has some clear advantages over lubricating oil. It is a semi-solid material, which prevents it from flowing/leaking {{out from the}} lubricated system and gives it sealing properties, protecting the system against contaminants. Unlike oil, grease has a much more complicated rheology, which {{makes it more difficult}} to model and understand grease flow. Grease acts as a lubricant reservoir, and understanding grease flow is essential in order to model and predict how grease is transported within e. g., a rolling element bearing housing, a <b>sealing</b> <b>arrangement</b> or replenishment of a gear mesh. Three greases with different rheological behaviors (NLGI 2 grease, NLGI 1 grease and NLGI 00 grease) have been used in two kinds of test rigs: a straight channel with different restrictions and a rotating shaft with two narrow gap sealing-like restrictions. In the first test rig two types of flow restrictions were applied into a straight channel in order to simulate flow of grease near a sealing pocket. In the case of a single restriction, the distance required for the velocity profile to fully develop when going from a wide to a narrow gap is approximately the same as the initial height of the channel. In the corner pocket before and after the restriction, the velocity is very low and part of the grease is stationary. For the channel with two flow restrictions, this effect is even more pronounced in the “pocket” between the restrictions. Clearly, {{a large part of the}} grease is not moving since the yield stress of the grease is not exceeded. This condition particularly applies to the cases with a low-pressure gradient and where high consistency grease is used. In practice this means that grease is not replaced in such “pockets” and that some aged/contaminated grease will remain there. A test rig comprising of a rotating shaft with two narrow gap sealing-like restrictions (a so called Double Restriction Seal, DRS) was designed to simulate the a labyrinth type of seal. Two different gap heights in the DRS have been designed to compare grease flow. It is shown that partially yielded grease is detected in the large gap geometry and fully yielded grease in the small gap geometry. Grease shear thinning behavior and wall slip effects have been detected and discussed. For the small gap geometry, it is shown that three distinct grease flow regions are present: a slip layer close to the stationary wall, a bulk flow layer, and a slip layer near the rotating shaft.

40|$|Large rotary {{processors}} such like rotary dryers, rotary calciners and kilns {{are difficult}} to seal properly because of their large diameter, their low precision methods of fabrication and their severe operating conditions. Those factors result in several types of imperfection at the sealing surface. This work explores the possibility to seal large rotary processors to positive pressure up to 1 atmosphere (14. 7 psig). First, an extensive theoretical analysis combined with on-site measurements evaluation was conducted to quantify the magnitude of each type of surface imperfection at the seal location. Against these results, the current typical seals used in the industry were evaluated and compared. The seals that featured compressed packing seals seem to show great possibility as they are already used in successful positive pressure large <b>seal</b> <b>arrangement.</b> A typical packing <b>seal</b> <b>arrangement</b> with a stuffing-box was studied thoroughly {{in order to understand}} its particularities. The data collected and calculated in the previous steps was gathered and settled the new seal requirements. A new <b>seal</b> <b>arrangement</b> is proposed and it features as principal characteristics: radial compression and adaptive flexible housing. Based on the stuffing-box available mathematical relations, the equations are re-evaluated to account for the new radially oriented arrangement. Meanwhile, a test rig is designed and built to measure the seal performance and observe its behaviour. The effect of several parameters can be studied such as temperature, gas pressure, magnitude of sealing surface imperfection, magnitude of radial compression and drum rotation speed. Finally, tests are conducted and the results are discussed {{in order to make a}} recommendation for the possible industrial application. In the light of this study the new proposed seal meets or surpasses the industrial application requirements.

There are a wide variety of seal options including the use of single or dual <b>seal</b> <b>arrangements.</b> While dual <b>seals</b> provide benefits in leakage containment and monitoring, single seals continue to be widely used due to their lower cost and simpler designs. Newer piping plans however offer options to increase leakage detectability and containment in single seals without sacrificing the simplicity of the seal design. A Plan 65 piping plan was introduced in API 682 Third Edition and ISO 21049. This captured leakage detection practices which were currently in use in the pipeline industry. The upcoming Fourth Edition of API 682 changes the designation of this plan to Plan 65 A and adds an alternative version designated as Plan 65 B.
