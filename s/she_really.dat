5|$|Taraborrelli {{decided to}} focus on the singer's private life; who <b>she</b> <b>really</b> was. Many books about the superstar were based on {{previously}} published material, but Taraborrelli had ten years of research to draw upon including interviews with people who had not spoken about Madonna in public and his own interviews with the icon. Taraborrelli and his team of private investigators interviewed Madonna's close friends, business associates, and family members including her father Silvio Ciccone.|$|E
5|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, Ima {{did not have}} a sister named Ura. Texas legend insists that when Jim Hogg ran for {{re-election}} as Texas governor in 1892 he often travelled with Ima and a friend of hers and introduced them as his daughters Ima and Ura. Ima Hogg maintained throughout her life that this never happened. She was frequently forced to dispel the myth; hundreds of people wrote her letters inquiring whether her name was real and if <b>she</b> <b>really</b> had a sister named Ura. The Kansas City Star even invented another sister, Hoosa.|$|E
5|$|During a rainy night, Jake tells Finn a {{story about}} a {{supposed}} vampire that used to live in their tree fort. Finn, scared by the sounds outside the house, goes downstairs to talk to Jake. Suddenly, their window is blown open and the lights go out. Finn and Jake soon discover that Marceline the Vampire Queen has snuck into their house. Both Finn and Jake are terrified that Marceline will kill them and drink their blood, but she reveals that she has no intentions of killing them, noting that <b>she</b> <b>really</b> only eats the color red. However, she explains that the tree house used to belong to her, and she promptly evicts them from their residence.|$|E

So she was great to bounce ideas off. And she sang on nearly all the songs. So <b>she</b> was <b>really</b> a great part of this record.|$|R

5|$|In December 1818, the Shelleys {{travelled}} {{south with}} Claire Clairmont and their servants to Naples, where they stayed for three months, receiving only one visitor, a physician. In 1820, {{they found themselves}} plagued by accusations and threats from Paolo and Elise Foggi, former servants whom Percy Shelley had dismissed in Naples shortly after the Foggis had married. The pair revealed that on 27 February 1819 in Naples, Percy Shelley had registered as his child by Mary Shelley a two-month-old baby girl named Elena Adelaide Shelley. The Foggis also claimed that Claire Clairmont was the baby's mother. Biographers have offered various interpretations of these events: that Percy Shelley decided to adopt a local child; that the baby was his by Elise, Claire, or an unknown woman; or that she was Elise's by Byron. Mary Shelley insisted she would have known if Claire had been pregnant, but {{it is unclear how}} much <b>she</b> <b>really</b> knew. The events in Naples, a city Mary Shelley later called a paradise inhabited by devils, remain shrouded in mystery. The only certainty is that she herself was not the child’s mother. Elena Adelaide Shelley died in Naples on 9 June 1820.|$|E
5|$|In 1649, {{the town}} is witness to many witch burnings. In the church, the townspeople {{try to figure out}} whom to condemn next. People begin accusing others and soon they erupt into chaos, until Marge intervenes. She tries to talk sense into the townspeople, but Moe accuses her of being a witch. Quimby assures her that she is {{entitled}} to due process which means she will be thrown off a cliff with a broomstick; if she is a witch she will be able to fly to safety, in which case the authorities expect her to report back for punishment. If she is not a witch, then she will fall to an honorable Christian death. After being shoved off the cliff, Marge flies up on the broomstick revealing that <b>she</b> <b>really</b> is a witch and vows to conquer the whole entire town. She returns to her sisters Patty and Selma. The sisters watch Ned and Maude Flanders talking about how the witches eat children, which gives them the notion to do just that. They knock on the Flanders' door and demand their sons, but before they leave, Maude offers the witches gingerbread men instead. The witches like these better than the children so they go to each house, getting goodies in exchange for not eating the children. As they fly off, the Sea Captain says that is how the tradition of Halloween and trick-or-treating started.|$|E

She tries to dump {{him but he}} is knocked unconscious and forgets what she told him. After a while he remembers and their relationship ends. While seeing Geoff, Ruby starts to feel unwell and is diagnosed with diabetes. She later organises a rally to stop a number of refugees being deported, but the event is fire bombed by racists. After this event Geoff blames Ruby and leaves her and Summer Bay. She briefly reunites with Xavier but Mink Carpenter (Matylda Buczko) ruins it. Ruby later enlists Liam to become her music tutor. They form a strong friendship but Ruby starts to have feeling for him. Nicole Franklin (Tessa James) tells Liam, he agrees to keep tutoring her and tells her where they stand. Although Liam tells her {{they will not be}} together, she lets her feelings develop into love for Liam and tries to kiss him.

5|$|Danielle later {{breaks down}} and tells Ronnie {{that she is}} {{pregnant}} by Paul, a barman she had a one-night stand with. She intended {{to tell him about}} her pregnancy until he reveals he has a girlfriend. Ronnie comforts Danielle and contacts Andy, suggesting that he take Danielle home but she resists in favour of staying close to Ronnie. She is dismayed when Ronnie confides in her that having her own child was the biggest mistake of her life. Danielle makes up with Stacey and decides to terminate her pregnancy. She is delighted when Ronnie accompanies her to the clinic but dismayed when she backs out of attending her second appointment. Following her abortion, Danielle visits her family for a while, but soon comes to miss Ronnie and Stacey and returns to Walford. Danielle becomes increasingly angry with Ronnie for rejecting her. She decides that she will tell Ronnie who <b>she</b> <b>really</b> is and leave Walford for good but Archie stops her when he learns who she is. Unknown to Danielle, Archie has told Ronnie that her daughter died as an infant, so in order to preserve his story, he convinces Danielle that Ronnie suffers from depression and she should keep quiet until he decides the time is right to make her revelation. Although Danielle continues to press Archie to reveal the truth, he repeatedly puts her off to maintain his lie. Eventually, believing that Archie has told Ronnie about her, Danielle tells her the truth but Ronnie refuses to believe her. Distraught, Danielle intends to leave Walford but Ronnie discovers that Archie has been lying and chases her. They are about to reconcile when Danielle is accidentally run over by a car driven by Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks).

Danielle passes away in Ronnie's arms as Roxy, Stacey and Janine watch on helpless, leaving Ronnie devastated. Danielle is buried and a grief-stricken Ronnie sings by her grave when alone.|$|E
25|$|I am {{sure that}} she was {{frequently}} bewildered by the rapidity and mutability of her own impulses. Possessed, as she was, of an intuitive rather than an analytical intelligence, I doubt that <b>she</b> <b>really</b> understood herself clearly, any more than did {{most of those who}} thought they knew her intimately. An exception in this regard was Daphne du Maurier.|$|E
25|$|Lily {{tells the}} family she is leaving Limerick House. <b>She</b> <b>really</b> makes {{off with the}} mirror, in 1867; Ned Kelly steals Constance's.

It's a race against time for the {{children}} to retrieve the mirror and foil the greedy duo.|$|E

25|$|After {{the end of}} one of her interviews, Lucinda {{started to}} {{question}} whether <b>she</b> <b>really</b> desired the job. In the boardroom, Alex picked up on this and brought it up in the boardroom, damaging Lucinda's chances of remaining in the competition. He was accused by the You're Fired panel of being a snake, and was mocked for his extremely defensive responses to the interviewers' questions, with Michael McIntyre also mocking his CV.|$|E
25|$|Russia {{produced}} more goods, and enlisted {{thousands of troops}} during Catherine's reign. While she acquired new lands, including Crimea and Poland, updated the army, and supported burgeoning manufactures, <b>she</b> <b>really</b> wanted to westernize Russia by reforming it, specifically {{the lives of the}} gentry, qualitatively. Bringing Russia to an equal level with the rest of Europe intellectually was a major concern of Catherine's. For this reason she created laws that justified her rule.|$|E
25|$|Like {{on the two}} {{previous}} stages, Wild powered to victory, outsprinting Lucinda Brand and Marta Tagliaferro. The Dutch rider captured her sixth success on Qatar soil and comforted her overall lead. Wild indeed wins the Ladies Tour of Qatar {{for the third time}} after 2009 and 2010 and shows that <b>she</b> <b>really</b> is the Queen of the event. In the final overall standings, she can enjoy a lead of 14” on Chloe Hosking and 29” on Ellen van Dijk.|$|E

60|$|NICHOLLS (with a gratified smile). You bet! (With a patronising air.) I {{hope to get}} Eileen {{away from}} all this as soon as--things pick up a little.

Eileen and I have gone around together for years--went to Grammar and High School together--in different classes, of course. <b>She's</b> <b>really</b> a corker--very {{different from the rest}} of the family you've seen--like her mother. <b>She's</b> <b>really</b> educated and knows a lot--used to carry off all the prizes at school.

25|$|Although {{the idea}} of working with {{resistance}} is essentially a hypnotic one, it goes beyond hypnosis and trance. In a typical example, a girl that bit her nails was told that she was cheating herself of really enjoying the nail biting. He encouraged her to let some of her nails grow a little longer before biting them, so that <b>she</b> <b>really</b> could derive the fullest pleasure from the activity. She decided to grow all of her nails long enough that she might really enjoy biting them, and then, after some days, she realised that she didn't want to bite them anyway.|$|E
25|$|In 1980 Brian De Palma, who {{directed}} Carrie, wanted Liv Ullmann {{to play the}} role of Kate Miller in the erotic crime thriller Dressed to Kill and offered it to her, but she declined because of the violence. The role subsequently went to Angie Dickinson. In 1982 Ingmar Bergman wanted Ullmann to play the main character Emelie Ekdahl in his last feature film, Fanny and Alexander and wrote the role with this in mind. But Ullmann felt the role was too sad and declined. Liv Ullmann later stated in interviews that turning it down was one of the few things <b>she</b> <b>really</b> regrets.|$|E
25|$|Defying orders, Max {{visits a}} former {{colleague}} named Guy Sangster who knew Marianne but, blind from a wartime injury, cannot confirm her identity.

Max seeks out a young pilot named Adam Hunter, gives him a photograph and instructs him to ask Delamare whether <b>she</b> <b>really</b> is Marianne. Max's commanding officer Frank Heslop informs him that Hunter was killed while waiting on the ground for the answer. Max also hears that this whole operation might be a test, before he is given a vital job in the run-up to D-Day.|$|E

5000|$|Jonathan Franzen felt {{conflicted}} {{about his}} book The Corrections being chosen {{as a book}} club selection. After the announcement was made, he expressed distaste with being {{in the company of}} other Oprah's Book Club authors, saying in an interview that Winfrey had [...] "picked some good books, but she's picked enough schmaltzy, one-dimensional ones that I cringe, myself, even though I think <b>she's</b> <b>really</b> smart and <b>she's</b> <b>really</b> fighting the good fight." [...] Franzen added that his novel was a [...] "hard book for that audience." [...] Franzen also felt conflicted about being selected by Winfrey because he was hoping to attract a male audience.|$|R
25|$|Alcoholic Angie {{shares a}} stormy {{marriage}} with her womanising husband, Den Watts (Leslie Grantham), {{and refuses to}} let him go even during their rockiest times. They run and live in The Queen Victoria pub on Albert Square. Angie and Den dote on their spoilt teenage adopted daughter, Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean), who carries on loving them despite her resentment of Den's affairs and Angie's binge drinking. Angie is good at putting on a front for the customers, dressing to kill, screeching outrageously with the girls, but inside she is a mess. Despite all her bravado, all <b>she</b> <b>really</b> wants is a happy marriage with Den, {{despite the fact that he}} treats her terribly and has endless affairs with other women.|$|E
25|$|Harlacher {{grew up in}} Camarillo, California, {{and started}} acting in school plays. When she was around 9–10 years old, she was {{inspired}} by an interview by Christy Carlson Romano who voiced Kim Possible, in which Romano said that with voice acting, {{you could go to}} work in your pajamas. Harlacher's mother responded {{that it was not a}} real job, and suggested she pursue acting only as a hobby. Her first exposure to anime was through Dragonball Z and Pokémon shows, which she considered more like cartoons, and that <b>she</b> <b>really</b> got into manga and anime in school when Fruits Basket was being published in English. At La Reina High School, she was active in the Speech and Mock Trial team, which was noted statewide and even attended a national event. She also competed on the school's diving team.|$|E
25|$|Winnicott {{thought that}} one of the {{developmental}} hurdles for an infant to get past is the risk of being traumatised by having to be too aware too soon of how small and helpless <b>she</b> <b>really</b> is. A baby who is too aware of real-world dangers will be too anxious to learn optimally. A good-enough parent is well enough attuned and responsive to protect the baby with an illusion of omnipotence, or being all-powerful. For example, a well-cared-for baby usually doesn't feel hungry for very long before being fed. Winnicott thought the parents' quick response of feeding the baby gives the baby a sense that whenever she's hungry, food appears as if by magic, as if the baby herself makes food appear just by being hungry. To feel this powerful, Winnicott thought, allowed a baby to feel confident, calm and curious, and able to learn without having to invest a lot of energy into defences.|$|E
