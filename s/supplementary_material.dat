40|$|Purpose- This study {{seeks to}} analyse the {{policies}} of library and information science (LIS) journals regarding the publication of <b>supplementary</b> <b>materials,</b> the number of journals and articles that include this feature, the kind of <b>supplementary</b> <b>materials</b> published {{with regard to their}} function in the article, the formats employed and the access provided to readers. Design/methodology/approach- The study analysed the instructions for authors of LIS journals indexed in the ISI Journal Citation Reports, as well as the <b>supplementary</b> <b>materials</b> attached to the articles published in their 2011 online volumes. Findings- Large publishers {{are more likely to have}} a policy regarding the publication of <b>supplementary</b> <b>materials,</b> and policies are usually homogeneous across all the journals of a given publisher. Most policies state the acceptance of <b>supplementary</b> <b>materials,</b> and even journals without a policy also publish <b>supplementary</b> <b>materials.</b> The majority of <b>supplementary</b> <b>materials</b> provided in LIS articles are extended methodological explanations and additional results in the form of textual information in PDF or Word files. Some toll-access journals provide open access to any reader to these files. Originality/value- This study provides new insights into the characteristics of <b>supplementary</b> <b>materials</b> in LIS journals. The results may be used by journal publishers to establish a policy on the publication of <b>supplementary</b> <b>materials</b> and, more broadly, to develop data sharing initiatives in academic settings...|$|R
40|$|Curriculum 2013 {{strongly}} suggests {{teachers and students}} to use the textbooks which have been developed by the government (the Ministry of Education and Culture law number 71 year 2013). It is seen that the English textbook for the seventh grade students which is entitled “When English Rings a Bell” (WERB) does not have adequate listening materials. Listening plays a critical important role in language learning, communication, academic pursuit, and current English curriculum (Rost, 2002; Vandergrifft, 2004 in Li and Renandya, 2012). Therefore, there should be adequate listening materials for English language learners. This paper presents the theories underpinning the development of listening <b>supplementary</b> <b>materials</b> for the seventh grade students based on Curriculum 2013. The theories {{presented in this paper}} are about (1) teaching listening, (2) <b>supplementary</b> <b>materials,</b> and (3) how to develop listening <b>supplementary</b> <b>materials.</b> By considering these theories, it is hoped that scholars, teachers, and material developers can have theoretical insights in developing listening <b>supplementary</b> <b>materials.</b> Key words: listening <b>supplementary</b> <b>materials,</b> Curriculum 201...|$|R

With the exception of the section on insects, in which he was assisted by his friend Latreille, the whole of the work was his own.

25|$|The Return of the King {{followed}} the precedent set by its predecessors by releasing an Extended Edition (251 minutes) with new editing and added special effects and music, along with four commentaries and {{six hours of}} <b>supplementary</b> <b>material,</b> plus 10 minutes of fan-club credits. However, this set took longer to produce than the others because the cast and crew, no longer based in New Zealand for the trilogy, were spread {{all over the world}} working on other projects.

25|$|Research {{scientists}} {{are the primary}} audience for the journal, but summaries and accompanying articles are intended to make {{many of the most}} important papers understandable to scientists in other fields and the educated public. Towards the front of each issue are editorials, news and feature articles on issues of general interest to scientists, including current affairs, science funding, business, scientific ethics and research breakthroughs. There are also sections on books and arts. The remainder of the journal consists mostly of research papers (articles or letters), which are often dense and highly technical. Because of strict limits on the length of papers, often the printed text is actually a summary of the work in question with many details relegated to accompanying <b>supplementary</b> <b>material</b> on the journal's website.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} Unearthed Arcana contains {{errors in}} its text, which readers discovered and reported to Dragon magazine. Even some positive {{reviews of the}} book pointed out the considerable number of mistakes. Dragon editor Kim Mohan, with ideas from Gygax, Frank Mentzer, and Jeff Grubb, addressed the many errors found in the book. In the November 1985 issue of Dragon magazine, Mohan printed four pages of rules corrections {{as well as new}} <b>supplementary</b> <b>material</b> intended to be inserted into the book, and some explanations and justifications for items which were not actually errors, and compiled a two-page list of type corrections meant to be pasted into further revisions of Unearthed Arcana. Dragon also devoted the entirety of its [...] "Sage Advice" [...] column in the January 1987 issue to answering readers' questions about Unearthed Arcana, as a follow-up to Mohan's prior column. However, the errata were not incorporated into later printings of the manual.|$|E
500|$|Twyne died on 4 July 1644, {{having made}} a will {{earlier that day}} in which he left his books and manuscripts to his college and the university. He made some pecuniary bequests to friends {{and those who had}} {{assisted}} him in his final illness. His manuscript collections amounted to 24 main volumes (about 12,000 pages) with other <b>supplementary</b> <b>material.</b> He was buried in the chapel of Corpus Christi. A hard-working researcher and collector of manuscripts, he was highly regarded and consulted by the legal scholar John Selden, the historian William Camden and Archbishop James Ussher. A later Keeper of the Archives, Strickland Gibson, described him in 1940 as [...] "one of the greatest of Oxford antiquaries". Twyne's collections, he said, were [...] "one of his greatest achievements, and in themselves a monument." [...] They were used extensively by Antony Wood in his history of the university but (noted Gibson) without proper credit being given. He was, however, disliked intensely by the city authorities for his actions against them. As it happens, many of the town's medieval records were lost in the early 17th century and are only known because Twyne had copied them into his collection.|$|E
500|$|According to Zalmout et al., Saadanius {{may also}} help resolve {{the age of the}} hominoid–cercopithecoid split. Paleoanthropological work has {{typically}} placed the divergence between 25 and 23mya, but genetic-based estimates have placed it in the early Oligocene, approximately 33mya. Despite the predictions from the genetic tests, little fossil evidence has been found for a last common ancestor between 30 and 23mya, favoring a later split. Only isolated teeth of Kamoyapithecus hinted at the existence of potential basal hominoids in the late Oligocene (between 24 and 27.5mya), while the oldest fossil Old World monkey, Victoriapithecus macinnesi, dates to 19mya. [...] With the discovery of Saadanius, Zalmout et al. suggested a later split than the genetic data, dating between 29–28 and 24mya. [...] However, Pozzi et al. later argued that although Saadanius is a significant discovery, because it is a stem catarrhine, it could not be used to date the divergence of the crown group. [...] The presence of stem taxa in the fossil record does not indicate that crown groups have evolved, and stem taxa may survive for millions of years after the crown taxa appear. [...] For this reason, the fossil record can only suggest a hard minimum boundary for divergence dates, which corresponds to the first appearance of a crown taxon. [...] Furthermore, Pozzi et al. pointed out that the <b>supplementary</b> <b>material</b> published by Zalmout et al. demonstrated that Pliopithecoidea were more closely related to living catarrhines than Saadanius.|$|E

Another important aspect of <b>supplementary</b> <b>materials</b> is that they facilitate the teacher’s creativity. However, there are advantages and disadvantages to using only coursebooks or only specially prepared classroom materials, and both - coursebooks and <b>supplementary</b> <b>materials</b> - should be used only after careful consideration.
