40|$|O poeta Públio Ovídio Nasão (43 a. C. - 17 d. C.) iniciou cedo sua carreira literária, cantando temas caros aos jovens, como o amor, a conquista e o bem viver. E o estilo que melhor recepcionava esses temas era a elegia amorosa, inspirada nos autores alexandrinos, como Calímaco e na geração {{anterior}} de poetas latinos, notadamente Tibulo, Propércio, Cornélio Galo e Catulo. Mais adiante, Ovídio expandiu tanto a temática quanto a variedade de gêneros em que escrevia. O objetivo deste trabalho é verificar a presença de motivos (tópoi) tipicamente elegíacos nos poemas IV, V, VI, IX, XI e XII das Heroides, uma obra ovidiana composta de dezoito cartas ficcionais de heroínas épicas a seus amados ausentes e as correspondentes respostas a três delas. Propõe-se também a tradução comentada de tais poemas e um estudo geral sobre elegia amorosa e seus tópoi mais recorrentes. The poet Publius Ovidius Naso (43 b. C. - 17 a. D.) {{began his}} literary career early, <b>singing</b> <b>themes</b> highly appreciated by the youth, such as love, seduction and good living. And the style that best conveyed those themes was the love elegy, inspired from Alexandrian {{writers such as}} Callimachus and the previous generation of Latin poets, especially Tibullus, Propertius, Cornelius Gallus, and Catullus. Later, Ovid expanded both the theme and variety of the genres he wrote. The goal of this work is to verify the presence of motifs (tópoi) typically elegiac in the poems IV, V, VI, IX, XI and XII of the Heroides, an Ovid work comprising eighteen fictional letters from epic heroines to their absent beloved ones and the corresponding responses to three of them. Finally, it is also proposed a commented translation of such poems, a general study on love elegy, and their most recurring tópoi...|$|E
