40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Audio {{amplifier}} {{power supplies}} have typically utilized power transformers to provide safety isolation from a wall outlet. These transformers provide ohmic disconnect between the power supply and the AC mains. The power transformer and its inherent weight and expense can be eliminated by implementing an off line rectified system for high voltage {{portions of the}} amplifier. An optical <b>isolator</b> <b>circuit</b> {{has been designed to}} allow audio signals to pass while providing the isolation necessary to protect users from a wall outlet power source <b>short</b> <b>circuit.</b> The optical <b>isolator</b> used to pass the input signal in this design is a Fairchild 6 N 136 high speed opto-isolator. An identical opto-isolator has been employed to provide negative feedback for temperature stability and to maintain the operating point necessary to pass an audio signal. The circuit passes an input signal from the now optically isolated preamplifier stage to the power amplification stage with minimum distortion. The designed isolator does not exceed 1. 0 % total harmonic distortion, which is quite acceptable for high quality audio applications. B. S. (Bachelor of Science...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – The up-gradation of an Electrical power {{generation}} network results in {{higher levels of}} <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> fault current. Thereby, the existing protection equipment like <b>circuit</b> breakers, <b>isolators</b> and fuses become under capacity and not capable of withstanding higher <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> currents. Thus the system is highly vulnerable to the adverse effects of <b>short</b> <b>circuits.</b> Replacing the whole protection switchgear is not feasible technically and economically. The solution {{in such a situation}} is an equipment called Fault Current Limiter (FCL). The concept of FCL is not new but the most suitable FCL is an on going research subject. This paper covers the prevailing aspects of FCL, the types of FCL, the research progress and at present the most viable FCL solution for industrial purpose at 6. 3 kV system in Pakistan...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: This paper studies dynamic {{characteristics}} of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> in the pulsed current {{gas metal arc}} welding (GMAW-P). Design/methodology/approach: Welding experiments with different values of pulsing parameter and simultaneous recording of high speed camera pictures and welding signals (such as current and voltage) were used to identify different <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> conditions in GMAW-P. The investigation is based on the synchronization of welding signals and high speed camera to characterize different types of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> occurring in GMAW-P system. The behaviour of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> under the influence of different pulsing conditions is also investigated. Findings: It will be shown in the paper that <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> in GMAW-P occurs in different forms which can be categorized depending upon time of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> and phase (peak or base time) of the pulse. Further investigation involves study of the dynamic behaviour of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> with variation of different pulsing parameters. Research limitations/implications: The results show that by varying the pulse parameters, behaviour of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> in GMAW-P is changed. The pulse parameters can be adjusted to avoid occurrence of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> in GMAW-P. Future work should concentrate on development of practical indices in terms of pulse welding parameters for quantitative estimation of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> occurrence and avoidance. Originality/value: Determination of proper working parameters with GMAW-P is crucial for the appropriate selection of pulse welding parameters. As short-circuiting is common between the welding electrode and the workpiece in GMAW-P, so in order to estimate the working parameters and ensure stable GMAW-P understanding dynamic behaviour of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> in GMAW-P will be useful. However, in case of aluminum hardly any attempt is made to analyse the dynamic behaviour of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> in GMAW-P.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this bachelor thesis is to introduce the calculation of voltage and current ratios in asymmetrical <b>short</b> <b>circuits.</b> The {{first part of the}} thesis is focused on delineating the problem of <b>short</b> <b>circuits</b> in general.

The next part of the thesis shows the ways of calculating particular types of <b>short</b> <b>circuits,</b> namely concentrating on the method of symmetrical components. The last part of the thesis is focused on the application of the discovered findings to calculate the ratios for the particular electric network. The calculation has been made for all the types of <b>short</b> <b>circuits,</b> both symmetrical and asymmetrical. The resulting ratios are recorded into the phasor diagrams for particular types of <b>short</b> <b>circuits.</b> The part of the calculation is also the recalculation of phase currents through a transformer...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The paper {{discusses}} several {{methods of}} detecting occurrence of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> and <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> severity in pulse {{gas metal arc}} welding process (GMAW-P). Design/methodology/approach: Welding experiments with different values of pulsing parameter and simultaneous recording of high speed camera pictures and welding signals (such as current and voltage) were used to identify the occurrence of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> and its severity in GMAW-P process. The investigation is based on the measurement of welding signals specifically current and voltage signals and their synchronization with high speed camera to investigate the <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> phenomenon in GMAW-P process. Findings: The results reveal that <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> can be detected using signal processing techniques and its severity can be predicted by using statistical models and artificial intelligence techniques in GMAW-P process. Research limitations/implications: Several factors are responsible for <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> occurrence in GMAW-P process. The results show that voltage and current signal carry rich information about the metal transfer and especially <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> occurrence in GMAW-P process. Hence it’s possible to detect <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> occurrence in GMAW-P process. Future work should concentrate on development of advance techniques to improve reliability of techniques mentioned in this paper for <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> detection and prediction in GMAW-P process. Originality/value: For achieving atomization of the welding processes, implementation of real time monitoring of weld quality is essential. Specifically for GMAW-P process which is widely used for light weight metal which is widely gaining popularity in manufacturing industry. However, in case of GMAW-P process hardly any attempt is made to analyse techniques to detect and predict occurrence of <b>short</b> <b>circuit.</b> This paper analyses different techniques that can be employed for real time monitoring and prediction of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> and its severity in the GMAW-P process...|$|R

It was found that there exists optimum conditions of magnetic field with which preset {{pulsed magnetic field}} could accelerate the rupture of the liquid bridge and reduce the peak value of welding current in the period of <b>short</b> <b>circuiting</b> transfer. This lead to energy accumulation lowered at the last phase of the <b>short</b> <b>circuiting</b> transfer and spatter loss reduced resulting from explosive <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> rupture, in the meantime, it could improve the regularity and stability of the <b>short</b> <b>circuiting</b> transfer as well as the weld shaping quality...|$|R

Experimental data are presented to verify predicted behavior for both types of <b>short</b> <b>circuits.</b> It is shown that single-phase asymmetrical <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> faults produce more severe fault responses with high pulsating torque and a significant threat of rotor demagnetization. A control strategy that purposely transitions such faults into symmetrical three-phase <b>short</b> <b>circuits</b> can minimize the fault severity and associated demagnetization risks.

3000|$|... 1) A new {{transmission}} network expansion planning model with embedded constraints of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> currents and N- 1 security is proposed in this paper. In this model, {{the constraints of}} <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> currents are explicitly incorporated. Thus, the optimal planning results can not only satisfy N- 1 security of transmission systems, but also limit the <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> currents below the safety threshold.|$|R
30|$|In {{existing}} literature, while incorporating N- 1 constraints into transmission expansion {{models is}} common practice [18, 19, 20, 21, 22], embedding constraints of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> currents into transmission expansion planning models is not thoroughly discussed. Since <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> currents have strong nonlinear relation with decision variables of candidate transmission lines, current power grid planning models have defects of heavy computational burden and low solution accuracy. In an actual power grid planning project, instead of embedding constraints in the grid planning model, <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> currents are calculated after determining {{the power grid}} planning result. This is an open-loop approach in which <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> currents are checked manually. Once the <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> currents are excessive, the power grid planning result needs modifying according to artificial experience. The major drawback of this procedure is low efficiency and loss of optimality. Therefore, current power grid planning model can merely guarantee N- 1 security. A model that can ensure both <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> currents constraints and N- 1 security needs investigating.|$|R

30|$|In {{the past}} decades, {{how to reduce}} <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> {{currents}} of power grids has been widely investigated [8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. Up to date, there are mainly three kinds of measures in limiting <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> currents, i.e., to improve the structure of power grids, to optimize the operation of power systems and to deploy current limiting devices. Ref. [13] investigates the influence of zoning on <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> currents and proposes the optimization model of the zonal operation in 220  kV power grids. Ref. [14] presents a decision method of operation schemes for limiting <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> currents in regional grids. The effect of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> currents, transient voltage security and static power flow distribution are considered. In Ref. [15], the case study based on PSCAD verifies the calculation method of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> faults in an HVDC system. In addition, the various <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> current sources with their corresponding faults are analyzed. In Ref. [16], a model for automatically allocating optimal current limiting devices in power systems is formulated. In this mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model, integer variables are utilized to determine the discrete capacity of reactors. Ref. [17] establishes a model for configuring ultra-high voltage <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> currents limiters with particle swarm optimization (PSO).
