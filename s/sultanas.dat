25|$|The {{emphasis}} which Islam places {{upon the}} feminine/masculine polarity (and therefore complementarity) results, quite logically, in {{a separation of}} social functions. In general, a woman's sphere of operation is the home in which she is the dominant figureand a man's corresponding sphere is the outside world. However, this separation is not, in practice, as rigid as it appears. There are many examplesboth in {{the early history of}} Islam and in the contemporary worldof Muslim women who have played prominent roles in public life, including being <b>sultanas,</b> queens, elected heads of state and wealthy businesswomen Moreover, it is important to recognise that in Islam, home and family are firmly situated at the centre of life in this world and of society: a man's work cannot take precedence over the private realm.|$|E

25|$|Examples {{of popular}} Irish cuisine include boxty, colcannon, coddle, stew, and bacon and cabbage. Ireland {{is famous for}} the full Irish breakfast, which {{involves}} a fried or grilled meal generally consisting of bacon, egg, sausage, pudding, and fried tomato. Apart from the significant influence by European and international dishes, {{there has been a}} recent emergence of a new Irish cuisine based on traditional ingredients handled in new ways. This cuisine is based on fresh vegetables, fish, oysters, mussels and other shellfish, and the wide range of hand-made cheeses that are now being produced across the country. Shellfish have increased in popularity, especially due to the high quality shellfish available from the country's coastline. The most popular fish include salmon and cod. Traditional breads include soda bread and wheaten bread. Barmbrack is a yeasted bread with added <b>sultanas</b> and raisins.|$|E
