50|$|The <b>Scottish</b> <b>Grand</b> <b>Committee</b> is a {{committee}} of the House of Commons. It is not a select committee (see Scottish Affairs Select Committee), but rather a grand committee composed of all 59 Scottish MPs (72 MPs prior to 2005).|$|E
50|$|Regarding {{parliamentary}} matters, {{an anomaly}} called the West Lothian Question {{has come to}} the fore as a result of legislative devolution for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland without corresponding legislative devolution for England. Before devolution, for example, purely 'Scottish' legislation was debated at Westminster in a <b>Scottish</b> <b>Grand</b> <b>Committee</b> composed of just those MPs representing Scottish constituencies.|$|E
50|$|The Regional Affairs Committee, {{previously}} {{known as}} the Standing Committee on Regional Affairs, is a general committee of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom that considers any matter related to regional affairs in England that may be referred to it. The Committee comprises thirteen MPs from English constituencies, although any MP representing an English constituency may participate in its debates. In that it {{is similar to the}} Northern Ireland, <b>Scottish,</b> and Welsh <b>Grand</b> <b>Committees.</b> Also like those committees, provision is made for it to meet away from Westminster.|$|R

50|$|The EU-legislation under {{preparation}} {{is brought to}} the <b>Grand</b> <b>Committee</b> of the Finnish Parliament by the Finnish government when Finland has received notice of the proposal from the European Commission. The <b>Grand</b> <b>Committee</b> discusses the matter in camera, and if appropriate, requests opinions from the specialized committees of the Parliament. Both the <b>Grand</b> <b>Committee</b> and the specialized committees hear expert opinions while preparing their opinions. Finally, the <b>Grand</b> <b>Committee</b> formulates the Finnish opinion to the proposal. However, as {{an exception to the}} general rule, in matters concerning the external relations of the Union, the Finnish stance is formulated by the Committee for Foreign and Security Policy, instead of the <b>Grand</b> <b>Committee.</b>|$|R
5000|$|After the Old Royal High School was vacated in 1968, the {{building}} became available and was refurbished {{to accommodate a}} new devolved legislature for Scotland. However, the 1979 devolution referendum failed to provide sufficient backing for a devolved assembly. Its debating chamber was later used for meetings of the <b>Scottish</b> <b>Grand</b> <b>Committee,</b> the committee of Members of Parliament in the United Kingdom House of Commons with constituencies in Scotland.|$|E
50|$|The Scottish Liberal Democrats were {{committed}} to an overarching principle of federalism throughout the United Kingdom, with the Scottish Labour Party advocating legislative devolution for Scotland and Wales, as had been attempted unsuccessfully in the late 1970s, the Scottish National Party seeking independence. However, the Conservative Government wanted no such change, and Scottish Secretaries, such as Ian Lang and Michael Forsyth, advocated internal parliamentary reforms at Westminster, such as holding more debates in the <b>Scottish</b> <b>Grand</b> <b>Committee,</b> which then consisted of all 72 MPs for Scottish constituencies.|$|E
50|$|The Scottish Grand Committee's {{function}} is to oversee UK Parliament bills specific to Scotland. However, since {{the creation of the}} Scottish Parliament none has been presented, and consequently the Committee has met only occasionally since. It is not a defunct body, however, as a Scotland-only UK Parliament bill is still theoretically possible. The Committee last met in November 2003. For several years it met at the Old Royal High School in Edinburgh. The retention of the <b>Scottish</b> <b>Grand</b> <b>Committee</b> was agreed by the House of Commons on 21 October 1999.|$|E

50|$|The party's {{commitments}} to a devolved Scottish Assembly were to decline {{under the leadership}} of Margaret Thatcher. Previously the party had offered some support for a Scottish Assembly, including in the so-called Declaration of Perth in 1968 under UK party leader Edward Heath. John Major, while endorsing further powers for the <b>Scottish</b> <b>Grand</b> <b>Committee</b> and the Scottish Office did not support a devolved parliament. With the Labour Party's victory in 1997, referendums on devolution were organised in Scotland and Wales, both receiving agreement that devolved legislatures should be formed.|$|E
5000|$|Robertson was {{increasingly}} {{more interested in}} his own constituency than in party politics. In July 1957, while debating highlands roads in the <b>Scottish</b> <b>Grand</b> <b>Committee,</b> he declared that unless the problem was dealt with, [...] "I can assure this Committee that I will have the greatest difficulty remaining in this party"; he also described the Minister John Maclay as [...] "a Treasury lackey and a mouthpiece for officialdom". In January 1959, he seconded an amendment moved by Labour MP Tom Fraser to continue marginal agricultural production grants, but again found Maclay unwilling to help.|$|E
50|$|A grand {{committee}} for Scotland, the <b>Scottish</b> <b>Grand</b> <b>Committee,</b> {{was established in}} 1907 to consider issues and legislation exclusive to Scotland. Grand committees for Wales (Welsh Grand Committee) and Northern Ireland (Northern Ireland Grand Committee) were subsequently established to consider issues relating to those nations. No {{grand committee}} was established for England; however, a Regional Affairs Committee was established to discuss issues relating to the Regions of England. This committee had 13 members, but all English MPs could attend and participate in its proceedings. Regional select committees and grand committees also existed for the English Regions between 2008 and 2010.|$|E

He {{also served as a}} trade union organiser with the National Union of Public Employees (NUPE) between 1976 and 1979. He was elected as Member of Parliament for Glasgow Springburn in the 1979 general election. Martin is associated with {{the right wing of the}} Labour Party, and a social conservative on matters such as abortion and homosexuality. In 1994, he was one of thirteen Labour MPs who voted against the reduction of the age of consent for homosexuals from 21 to 18. He was a supporter of Roy Hattersley and Denis Healey, with whom he served as a Parliamentary Private Secretary from 1980 until 1983. He served as Chairman of the <b>Scottish</b> <b>Grand</b> <b>Committee</b> from 1987 to 1997.|$|E
50|$|He won at five general elections, {{although}} his seat {{was not always}} particularly safe, particularly in the two general elections of 1974: his majority was reduced to just over 1,800 votes by the Scottish National Party at the October 1974 general election. As a Member of Parliament, his focus was firmly on the interests of his constituency and constituents. Throughout his time in parliament, he took {{a keen interest in}} the Scotch whisky industry, which was the key employer in the constituency. The nuclear base at Faslane was also in his constituency, and his constituents were also affected by the decline of the shipbuilding industry on the Lower Clyde. Although a backbencher for all of his time in the Commons, he was Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Secretary of State for Scotland, Bruce Millan, from 1976 until 1979, during the period when the Labour government was proposing to implement Scottish devolution. He also served for many years {{as a member of the}} Chairman's panel, and eventually as the regular Chairman of the <b>Scottish</b> <b>Grand</b> <b>Committee.</b> He was significantly, and controversially, involved in the campaign against abortion, co-sponsoring an ultimately unsuccessful private member's bill introduced by his friend and colleague, James White, MP for Glasgow Pollok, to tighten the requirements of the Abortion Act 1967. Campbell acted as an informal whip in the committees considering various bills aimed at tightening the law in this area. Early in the 1979 parliament, he successfully piloted a private member's bill through the House of Commons to enable Scottish local authorities to offer concessionary transport to people with mental disabilities.|$|E
40|$|First paragraph: A {{distinctive}} feature of Scottish devolution {{compared with other}} countries is that Scotland has always had its own statute book, with distinct Scottish legislation over a range of policy fields. Some of this consisted of separate Scottish bills, {{but a lot of}} it took the form of Scottish clauses tacked onto UK bills, making the statute book somewhat untidy and not easy to follow. Most Scottish MPs tended to specialize in Scottish legislation, which was dealt with largely by the <b>Scottish</b> <b>Grand</b> <b>Committee</b> and Scottish Standing Committees, isolating it from the Westminster mainstream. While they jealously guarded their prerogatives in these matters, the policy content of legislation was not greatly different from that pursued in England and Wales, given government dominance of the process {{and the fact that the}} essential Second Reading and Report votes were taken in the whole House. Standing Committees were also nominated to ensure a government majority, with English MPs being drafted in during the later years of the Conservative Government in order to make up the numbers...|$|E

50|$|In the House of Lords, <b>Grand</b> <b>Committee</b> is {{a meeting}} of the House as a whole, but away from the Floor of the House.

House of Lords <b>Grand</b> <b>Committees</b> may consider Bills or statutory instruments (usually but not always instruments that later require approval on the Floor of the House under the affirmative resolution procedure), or debate particular issues or topics.|$|R
