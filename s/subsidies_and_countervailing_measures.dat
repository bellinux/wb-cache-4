40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{discusses the}} application of “Agreement on <b>Subsidy</b> <b>and</b> <b>Countervailing</b> <b>Measures</b> (ASCM) ” of WTO to non-market economies (NMEs).   The difficulties of application of ASCM to NMEs mainly lie in two basic questions.   The first is how to separate the <b>subsidy</b> <b>and</b> government involvement in a NME.   The second is how perfect the market {{has to be in}} order to qualify as a benchmark to calculate subsidy margins. By focusing on WTO rules and substantial WTO cases, this dissertation analyzes the difficulties in application of ASCM to NMEs from seven perspectives in legal practice.   They are: (1) whether subsidies in public utility enterprises in China are actionable, because such subsidies as upstream subsidies pass benefits to export-oriented enterprises? (2) whether subsidies may continue after privatisation of state-owned companies? (3) whether the loans provided by state-owned banks in China are subsidies? (4) whether it is fair to evaluate the subsidies margins of the land use rights in China by using out-of-country benchmark? (5) tax-incentive subsidies in China; (6) the calculation of a subsidy margin in NMEs; and (7) whether currency manipulation constitutes a subsidy? The dissertation finds that the difficulties of application of ASCM to NMEs are due to a number of reasons.   First, the deficiencies of ASCM cannot explain {{the application of}} ASCM to NMEs; second, if applicable to NMEs, there are difficulties in defining a <b>subsidy</b> in NMEs <b>and</b> in calculating a subsidy margin in NMEs; third, the non-unification of assessment of a NME results in unfairness to China which faces different standards of evaluating a NME.   Even though China has been a market economy in some countries’ view, it is difficult to be recognised as a market economy by all countries.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} whether private actors {{can rely}} upon WTO Agreements and rulings when challenging {{the legality of}} actions taken by a WTO member before that member's domestic court, with {{special attention to the}} cases on trade remedies law, such as antidumping <b>and</b> <b>subsidies</b> <b>countervailing</b> <b>measures.</b> As is well known, however, most countries have clearly denied the direct applicability of WTO law. Hence, what deserves to be discussed is the indirect applicability, i. e., courts taking WTO law into consideration when they interpret domestic statutes. In the present paper, the author tries to address this issue {{on the basis of the}} recent jurisprudence developed in the United States and the NAFTA bi-national panels. As a result, it is shown that the indirect applicability, on one hand, has been denied if it leads to the same consequences as when WTO law is directly applied and thus compels political branches to change their positions significantly. On the other hand, courts would not hesitate to make a strict review of governmental actions in light of WTO law if the government itself has a positive attitude toward complying with it. Therefore, even before the domestic courts, private actors may have the opportunity to challenge the legality of governmental measures successfully, relying upon the WTO Agreements and jurisprudence indirectly. A combined use of the WTO dispute settlement system and the domestic judicial procedure would be helpful in ensuring more effective compliance with WTO law. ...|$|R

50|$|Within the {{international}} system {{it is difficult to}} enforce international law, particularly with regard to human rights. So using trade sanctions as a coercive measure is an appealing prospect to ensure cooperation. However, there are many reasons why trade sanctions are an inappropriate mechanism for enforcing labour standards. They are generally against WTO principles, and can only be used in very limited circumstances that are authorized by the WTO agreements, such as anti-dumping <b>and</b> <b>countervailing</b> <b>measures.</b> Politically, it is unlikely that unilateral action would be allowed for breaches of labour standards. Even assuming that labour standards are able to be enforced through trade measures within the WTO, either through amendments to GATT XX, the introduction of a social clause or any other measure, they do not provide a solution to the complexity of the labour standards issue and should not be used to deal with disputes over labour standards.|$|R

Recent changes to the Customs Act and the creation of a new Anti-Dumping Commission are designed to make it easier for Australian producers to bring anti-dumping actions against foreign producers. If this leads to a sustained increase in anti-dumping actions, it will mark the end of a downward trend in Australia’s use of anti-dumping measures since the mid- 1980 s.

40|$|Analysis of the Appellate Body's (AB) {{treatment}} of a particular legal question often provides insight into issues of more general importance.

The legal question analyzed arose when European governments challenged the US's imposition of countervailing duties (CVDs) on steel manufactured by 'privatized' steel companies. The US claimed the CVDs were proper since subsidies provided prior to privatization had 'passed through' to the privatized companies. The AB, relying heavily on the meaning of words rather than on consideration of 'object and purpose', found that the US had violated its obligations under the SCM Agreement. An analysis of the AB's logic and the authorities cited demonstrates that neither justifies the AB's conclusion. A heuristic model of the definition of subsidy is used to show that the question raised by privatization implicates issues of causation, overlooked by the AB, that are important in correctly interpreting the SCM Agreement. The problems arising from AB texturalism are contrasted with the justifications given for that approach, suggesting that a change in approach may be warranted., Oxford University Press. ...|$|R

The strengthening of the multilateral disciplines on afeguards — including the prohibition and elimination of voluntary export restraints and he commitments to phase out the Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA) quotas under the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC) — appears to have provoked an increasing resort to anti-dumping measures. C rtain countries and product sectors, such as teel and textiles, have been targeted more than others. At the same time, there has been an increasing resort to anti-dumping measures by non-traditional users — particularly developing countries — many of which have introduced anti-dumping <b>and</b> <b>countervailing</b> legislation since the entry into force of the WTO Agreements. Developing countries continue to be the main targets of anti-dumping measures. This has the effect of creating instability and uncertainty for their exports, which has resulted in reductions in trade volumes and market shares for their goods.
