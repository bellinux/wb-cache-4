5|$|Inception was {{released}} on DVD and Blu-ray on December3,2010, in France, and the week after in the UK and USA (December7,2010). Warner Bros. also made available in the United States a limited Blu-ray edition packaged in a metal replica of the PASIV briefcase, which included extras such as a metal replica of the <b>spinning</b> <b>top</b> totem. With a production run of less than 2000, it sold out in one weekend.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{arrival at}} Los Angeles Airport, Cobb passes the U.S. {{immigration}} checkpoint and Professor Miles accompanies {{him to his}} home. Using his totem—a <b>spinning</b> <b>top</b> that spins indefinitely in a dream world but falls over in reality—Cobb conducts a test {{to prove that he}} is indeed in the real world, but he ignores its result and instead joins his children in the garden.|$|E
5|$|A viral {{marketing}} campaign was employed for the film. After {{the revelation of}} the first teaser trailer, in August2009, the film's official website featured only an animation of Cobb's <b>spinning</b> <b>top.</b> In December, the top toppled over and the website opened the online game Mind Crime, which upon completion revealed Inceptions poster. The rest of the campaign unrolled after WonderCon in April2010, where Warner gave away promotional T-shirts featuring the PASIV briefcase used to create the dream space, and had a QR code linking to an online manual of the device. Mind Crime also received a stage2 with more resources, including a hidden trailer for the movie. More pieces of {{viral marketing}} began to surface before Inceptions release, such as a manual filled with bizarre images and text sent to Wired magazine, and the online publication of posters, ads, phone applications, and strange websites all related to the film. Warner also released an online prequel comic, Inception: The Cobol Job.|$|E

5|$|Finally {{there is}} often a need to correct for the {{apparent}} movement of the stars. On the timescale of human civilisation the stars have largely maintained the same position relative to each other. Each night they appear to rotate around the celestial poles due to the Earth's rotation about its axis. However, the Earth spins rather like a <b>spinning</b> <b>top.</b> Not only does the Earth rotate, it wobbles. The Earth's axis takes around 25,800 years to complete one full wobble. The effect to the archaeoastronomer is that stars did not rise over the horizon in the past in the same places as they do today. Nor did the stars rotate around Polaris as they do now. In the case of the Egyptian pyramids, it has been shown they were aligned towards Thuban, a faint star in the constellation of Draco. The effect can be substantial over relatively short lengths of time, historically speaking. For instance a person born on 25 December in Roman times would have been born with the sun in the constellation Capricorn. In the modern period a person born on the same date would have the sun in Sagittarius due to the precession of the equinoxes.|$|E
25|$|Axial {{precession}} {{is similar}} to the precession of a <b>spinning</b> <b>top.</b> In both cases, the applied force is due to gravity. For a <b>spinning</b> <b>top,</b> this force tends to be almost parallel to the rotation axis. For the Earth, however, the applied forces of the Sun and the Moon are nearly perpendicular to the axis of rotation.|$|E
25|$|In 1838, he {{also studied}} the still-mysterious perceptual {{illusion}} {{of what is}} still called the Fechner color effect, whereby colors are seen in a moving pattern of black and white.

Whether Fechner and Benham ever actually met face to face for any reason is not known.|$|E

25|$|Due to a {{phenomenon}} called precession of the equinoxes (where the Earth's axis slowly rotates like a <b>spinning</b> <b>top</b> in a 25,700-year cycle), {{there is a}} slow shift in the correspondence between Earth's seasons (and calendar) and the constellations of the zodiac. Thus, the tropical zodiac corresponds with {{the position of the}} earth in relation to fixed positions in the sky (Western Astrology), while the sidereal zodiac is drawn based on the position in relation to the constellations (sidereal zodiac).|$|E
25|$|Christina Mundy: At 26 years old, Chris is the {{youngest}} of the Mundy sisters, and, like Maggie, has no paid job.

25|$|Conservation is {{not always}} a full {{explanation}} for the dynamics of a system but is a key constraint. For example, a <b>spinning</b> <b>top</b> is subject to gravitational torque making it lean over and change the angular momentum about the nutation axis, but neglecting friction at the point of spinning contact, it has a conserved angular momentum about its spinning axis, and another about its precession axis. Also, in any planetary system, the planets, star(s), comets, and asteroids can all move in numerous complicated ways, but only so that the angular momentum of the system is conserved.|$|E

25|$|A {{large-scale}} memorial of Smith by Alexander Stoddart {{was unveiled}} on 4 July 2008 in Edinburgh. It is a -tall bronze sculpture and it stands above the Royal Mile outside StGiles' Cathedral in Parliament Square, near the Mercat cross. 20th-century sculptor Jim Sanborn (best {{known for the}} Kryptos sculpture at the United States Central Intelligence Agency) has created multiple pieces which feature Smith's work. At Central Connecticut State University is Circulating Capital, a tall cylinder which features an extract from The Wealth of Nations on the lower half, and on the upper half, {{some of the same}} text but represented in binary code. At the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, outside the Belk College of Business Administration, is Adam Smith's <b>Spinning</b> <b>Top.</b> Another Smith sculpture is at Cleveland State University. He also appears as the narrator in the 2013 play The Low Road, centred on a proponent on laissez-faire economics {{in the late eighteenth century}} but dealing obliquely with the financial crisis of 2007–2008 and the recession which followed—in the premiere production, he was portrayed by Bill Paterson.|$|E
25|$|Precession can be {{demonstrated}} by placing a <b>spinning</b> <b>top</b> with its axis horizontal and supported loosely (frictionless toward precession) at one end. Instead of falling, as might be expected, the top appears to defy gravity by remaining with its axis horizontal, when {{the other end of}} the axis is left unsupported and the free end of the axis slowly describes a circle in a horizontal plane, the resulting precession turning. This effect is explained by the above equations. The torque on the top is supplied by a couple of forces: gravity acting downward on the device's centre of mass, and an equal force acting upward to support one end of the device. The rotation resulting from this torque is not downward, as might be intuitively expected, causing the device to fall, but perpendicular to both the gravitational torque (horizontal and perpendicular to the axis of rotation) and the axis of rotation (horizontal and outwards from the point of support), i.e., about a vertical axis, causing the device to rotate slowly about the supporting point.|$|E

500|$|The film cuts to {{the closing}} credits from {{a shot of the}} top {{apparently}} starting to show an ever so faint wobble, inviting speculation about whether the final sequence was reality or another dream. Nolan confirmed that the ambiguity was deliberate, saying, [...] "I've been asked the question more times than I've ever been asked any other question about any other film I've made... What's funny to me is that people really do expect me to answer it." [...] The film's script concludes with [...] "Behind him, on the table, the <b>spinning</b> <b>top</b> is STILL SPINNING. And we – FADE OUT". [...] Nolan said, [...] "I put that cut there at the end, imposing an ambiguity from outside the film. That always felt the right ending to me — it always felt like the appropriate 'kick' to me... The real point of the scene — and this is what I tell people — is that Cobb isn't looking at the top. He's looking at his kids. He's left it behind. That's the emotional significance of the thing." [...] Also, Michael Caine explained his interpretation of the ending, saying, [...] "If I'm there it's real, because I'm never in the dream. I'm the guy who invented the dream." ...|$|E
500|$|In the Solar System, {{the planets}} and the Sun lie roughly {{within the same}} flat plane, known as {{the plane of the}} ecliptic. From our {{perspective}} on Earth, the ecliptic is the path taken by the Sun across the sky {{over the course of the}} year. The twelve constellations that line the ecliptic are known as the zodiacal constellations and, annually, the Sun passes through all of them in turn. Additionally, over time, the Sun's annual cycle appears to recede very slowly backward by one degree every 72 years, or by one constellation approximately every 2,160 years. This backward movement, called [...] "precession", is due to a slight wobble in the Earth's axis as it spins, and can be compared to the way a <b>spinning</b> <b>top</b> wobbles as it slows down. Over the course of 25,800 years, a period often called a Great Year, the Sun's path completes a full, 360-degree backward rotation through the zodiac. In Western astrological traditions, precession is measured from the March equinox, one of the two annual points at which the Sun is exactly halfway between its lowest and highest points in the sky. At the end of the 20th century and beginning of the 21st, the Sun's March equinox position was in the constellation Pisces moving back into Aquarius. This signaled the end of one astrological age (the Age of Pisces) and the beginning of another (the Age of Aquarius).|$|E
