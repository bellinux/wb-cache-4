This study compares diagnostic delay and treatment outcomes of non-insured non-national migrants (NINNM) with insured Israeli citizens (IC) in the Tel Aviv tuberculosis (TB) clinic between 1998 and 2008. Patient delay was the time from symptoms onset to doctor’s visit, while <b>system</b> <b>delay</b> was measured from doctor visit to anti-TB therapy administration. We randomly sampled 222 NINNM and 265 IC. NINNM were younger than IC, had lower male to female ratio and fewer smoked.

It {{is based on a}} recombination or merging structure previously proposed by the authors [1]. By relaxing the original CMFB and the recombination transmultiplexer (TMUX) to be biorthogonal, nonuniform CMFBs with lower <b>system</b> <b>delay</b> can be obtained. This increases the possible choices of the prototype filters and greatly reduces the overall <b>system</b> <b>delay</b> of the nonuniform filter bank. A new method is also introduced to suppress the spurious response resulting from the mismatch in the transition bands of the two biorthogonal CMFBs.

40|$|Abstract Background Tuberculosis (TB) is a {{major public}} health concern in the {{developing}} world. Early diagnosis and prompt initiation of treatment is essential for effective TB control. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the length and analyze associated factors of patients’ and health <b>system’s</b> <b>delays</b> in the diagnosis and treatment of new pulmonary TB (PTB) patients. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in 30 randomly selected public health facilities in West Gojjam Zone, Amhara Region, Ethiopia. Newly diagnosed PTB patients who were ≥ 15  years of age were consecutively enrolled in the study. Patients’ delay (the time period from onset of TB symptoms to first presentation to a formal health provider) and health <b>system’s</b> <b>delay</b> (the time period from first presentation to a formal health provider to first start of TB treatment) were measured. Median patients’ and health <b>system’s</b> <b>delays</b> were calculated. Mixed effect logistic regression was used to analyze predictors of patients’ and health <b>system’s</b> <b>delays.</b> Results Seven hundred six patients were enrolled in the study. The median patients’ delay was 18  days (interquartile range [IQR]: 8 – 34  days) and the median health <b>system’s</b> <b>delay</b> was 22  days (IQR: 4 – 88  days). Poor knowledge of TB (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2. 33; 95  % confidence interval [CI], 1. 34 – 4. 05), first visit to non-formal health provider (AOR, 47. 56; 95  % CI, 26. 31 – 85. 99), self-treatment (AOR, 10. 11; 95  % CI, 4. 53 – 22. 56) and patients’ age (≥ 45  years) (AOR, 2. 99; 95  % CI, 1. 14 – 7. 81) were independent predictors of patients’ delay. Smear-negative TB (AOR, 1. 88; 95  % CI, 1. 32 – 2. 68) and first visit to public health centers (AOR, 2. 22; 95  % CI, 1. 52 – 3. 25) and health posts (AOR, 5. 86; 95  % CI, 1. 40 – 24. 39) were found to be independent predictors of health <b>system’s</b> <b>delay.</b> Conclusions The health <b>system’s</b> <b>delay</b> in this study was long and contributed more than 50  % of the total delay. Better TB diagnostic tools to complement sputum smear microscopy are needed to early diagnose PTB cases at peripheral health facilities.

Interesting load scenarios were defined and simulated. Results show that channel speed is traded off for sensitivity to <b>system</b> <b>delays.</b> High bit rates are not as beneficial as was believed, due to system constraints. Choice of common channels diminishes the control overhead of scheduling. Exploitation and performance of Dynamic Resource Allocation Control procedure in WCDMA is illustrated via restrictive and random scheduling. Random scheduling proves to lack in performance. Restrictive scheduling does better with less complexity, which also makes it more robust to <b>system</b> <b>delays.</b> Pre-emptive scheduling performs even better than restrictive scheduling in a limited range of <b>system</b> <b>delays,</b> but looses this andvantage for practical values.
