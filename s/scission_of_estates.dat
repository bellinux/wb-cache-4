The outcomes were applied to a reaction system with recombination of chain fragments, yielding an analytical solution of the 2 -dimensional population balance problem in chain length and numbers of combination points. As regards copolymer scission an exact equation and a simple approximation for the fragment length distribution has been obtained based on all possible configurations of sequences of unbroken bonds between two types <b>of</b> monomer units. <b>Scission</b> <b>of</b> weaklinks could also be successfully treated using the simple approximation based on a copolymer composition weighted average scission probability...|$|R

40|$|Polyamides 6. 6 (PA- 6. 6) and 6. 10 (PA- 6. 10) {{decompose}} on {{heating by}} <b>scission</b> <b>of</b> the N-alkylamide bond (CH 2 NHCO), with {{the formation of}} vinyl chain ends and primary amide groups which dehydrate to nitriles at the temperature of degradation. In PA- 6. 6 <b>scission</b> <b>of</b> the alkylamide bond (CH 2 CONH) also takes place, resulting in methyl and isocyanate chain ends which can further dimerize to carbodiimides with elimination of CO 2 or trimerize to isocyanurate structures. In the presence of ammonium polyphosphate (APP), flammability, as measured by oxygen index, decreases because APP induces intumescent behaviour. The chemical interaction between APP and PA- 6. 6 and PA- 6. 10 leads to chain <b>scission</b> <b>of</b> the polyamide, with formation of a primary amide group and a phosphate ester which thermally degrades to give a vinyl chain end. APP also catalyses the alkylamide bond scission in PA- 6. 6. The intumescent behaviour might be due to blowing of the thermally stable polyphosphoric acid layer {{on the surface of the}} material by the gases evolved by the degradation of the polyamides, which occurs at lower temperature in the presence of APP...|$|R
40|$|<b>Scission</b> <b>of</b> {{plant cell}} wall polysaccharides in vivo has {{generally}} been assumed to be enzymic. However, {{in the presence of}} l-ascorbate, such polysaccharides are shown to undergo non-enzymic scission under physiologically relevant conditions. <b>Scission</b> <b>of</b> xyloglucan by 1 mM ascorbate had a pH optimum of 4. 5, and the maximum scission rate was reached after a 10 - 25 -min delay. Catalase prevented the scission, whereas added H 2 O 2 (0. 1 - 10 mM) increased the scission rate and shortened the delay. Ascorbate caused detectable xyloglucan scission above approx. 5 microM. Dehydroascorbate was much less effective. Added Cu 2 + (> 0. 3 microM) also increased the rate of ascorbate-induced scission; EDTA was inhibitory. The rate <b>of</b> <b>scission</b> in the absence of added metals appeared to be attributable to the traces of Cu (2. 8 mg. kg- 1) present in the xyloglucan. Ascorbate-induced <b>scission</b> <b>of</b> xyloglucan was inhibited by radical scavengers; their effectiveness was proportional to their rate constants for reaction with hydroxyl radicals (. OH). It is proposed that ascorbate non-enzymically reduces O 2 to H 2 O 2, and Cu 2 + to Cu+, and that H 2 O 2 and Cu+ react to form. OH, which causes oxidative <b>scission</b> <b>of</b> polysaccharide chains. Evidence is reviewed to suggest that, in the wall of a living plant cell, Cu+ and H 2 O 2 are formed by reactions involving ascorbate and its products, dehydroascorbate and oxalate. Systems may thus be in place to produce apoplastic. OH radicals in vivo. Although. OH radicals are often regarded as detrimental, they are so short-lived that they could act as site-specific oxidants targeted to play a useful role in loosening the cell wall, e. g. during cell expansion, fruit ripening and organ abscission...|$|R

40|$|SummarySome {{bacteria}} invade host cells by {{triggering a}} process akin to phagocytosis. We analyzed the mechanisms underlying invasion vacuole formation by the bacterium Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. After engaging integrins on host cells, Yersinia resided in PI(4, 5) P 2 -rich, membrane-bound compartments called “prevacuoles” that were inaccessible to extracellular antibodies but remained {{connected to the}} plasma membrane. The <b>scission</b> <b>of</b> prevacuoles to form separate, sealed compartments coincided with and required PI(4, 5) P 2 hydrolysis. At the time <b>of</b> <b>scission,</b> the inositol 5 -phosphatases OCRL and Inpp 5 b were recruited to prevacuoles. This recruitment and subsequent PI(4, 5) P 2 hydrolysis required the association of the GTPase Rab 5 with prevacuoles. Phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase activity was required for fusion of Rab 5 -positive vesicles with prevacuoles and <b>scission</b> <b>of</b> nascent vacuoles from the plasma membrane. Thus, Yersinia invasion involves a multistep {{process in which the}} bacteria form a protective prevacuole and then recruit host factors to induce membrane fission, allowing the bacteria to invade the cell...|$|R

In contrast with results previously reported for RuO 4 oxidations, we found that trisubstituted double bonds gave α-hydroxy ketones and/or 1, 2 -diols rather than the expected products deriving from the <b>scission</b> <b>of</b> the carbon-carbon double bond. <b>Scission</b> <b>of</b> the double bond indeed occurs when fully substituted steroidal alkenes are oxidized.

40|$|The GTPase dynamin catalyzes the <b>scission</b> <b>of</b> deeply invaginated clathrin-coated pits at {{the plasma}} membrane, but the {{mechanisms}} governing dynamin-mediated membrane fission remain poorly understood. Through mutagenesis, we {{have altered the}} hydrophobic nature of the membrane-inserting variable loop 1 (VL 1) of the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of dynamin- 1 and demonstrate that its stable insertion into the lipid bilayer is critical for high membrane curvature generation and subsequent membrane fission. Dynamin PH domain mutants defective in curvature generation regain function when assayed on precurved membrane templates in vitro, but they remain defective in the <b>scission</b> <b>of</b> clathrin-coated pits in vivo. These results demonstrate that, in concert with dynamin self-assembly, PH domain membrane insertion is essential for fission and vesicle release in vitro and for clathrin-mediated endocytosis in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Sorting, transport, and autophagic {{degradation}} of proteins in endosomes and lysosomes, {{as well as}} the division of these organelles, depend on <b>scission</b> <b>of</b> membrane-bound tubulo-vesicular carriers. How scission occurs is poorly understood, but family proteins bind these membranes. Here, we show that the yeast PROPPIN Atg 18 carries membrane scission activity. Purified Atg 18 drives tubulation and <b>scission</b> <b>of</b> giant unilamellar vesicles. Upon membrane contact, Atg 18 folds its unstructured CD loop into an amphipathic α-helix that inserts into the bilayer. This allows the protein to engage its two lipid binding sites for PI 3 P and PI(3, 5) P 2 PI(3, 5) P 2 induces Atg 18 oligomerization, which should concentrate lipid-inserted α-helices in the outer membrane leaflet and drive membrane tubulation and scission. The <b>scission</b> activity <b>of</b> Atg 18 is compatible with its known roles in endo-lysosomal protein trafficking, autophagosome biogenesis, and vacuole fission. Key features required for membrane tubulation and scission by Atg 18 are shared by other PROPPINs, suggesting that membrane scission may be a generic function of this protein family...|$|R
