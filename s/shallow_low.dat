40|$|Indene-C(60) bisadduct (ICBA) {{is one of}} {{the rare}} acceptors which can {{supersede}} commonly used phenyl-C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM 70) in enhancing the performance of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells owing to its <b>shallower</b> <b>lowest</b> unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level. However, ICBA tends to decrease the photocurrent for most of the low band-gap polymers synthesized to date. Here we examine the interaction of ICBA with the one of the popular low band-gap polymers poly[[4, 8 -bis[(2 -ethylhexyl) oxy]benzo[1, 2 -b: 4, 5 -b']dithiophene- 2, 6 -diyl][3 -fluoro- 2 -[(2 -ethylhexyl) carbonyl]thieno[3, 4 -b]thio-phenediyl]] (PTB 7), at femtosecond level, to explore key dynamics governing the operation of BHJ cells involving ICBA. The photo-physics of binary and ternary systems based on PTB 7 coupled with PCBM 70 and/or ICBA are studied by means of transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and supported by morphology analysis. Our study suggests that both inefficient charge-separation and poor charge transport of ICBA is responsible for relatively low photocurrent generation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V.

30|$|This study {{investigates the}} thermal {{maturity}} {{structure of the}} accretionary wedge along with the thermal history of sediments during wedge formation using a numerical simulation. The thermal maturity, which is {{described in terms of}} vitrinite reflectance, is determined using the temperature and duration of exposure based on the particle trajectories within the accretionary wedge. This study revealed the variability in the thermal maturity even though sediments are observed to originate at an identical initial depth and thermal conditions. We propose two end-member pathways of sediment movement in the accretionary wedge during wedge growth: a <b>shallow,</b> <b>low</b> thermal maturity pathway and a deep, high thermal maturity pathway. These shallow path sediments, which move into the shallow portion of the wedge during wedge growth through accretion, rarely experience high temperatures; therefore, their thermal maturity is low. However, the sediments subducted in the deep portion of the wedge experience high temperatures and obtain high thermal maturity {{as a function of the}} deep high thermal maturity pathway. Simultaneously, a geological deformation event, such as faulting, defines the steps of thermal maturity. The small step of thermal maturity is formed by the frontal thrusting and can be preserved as a function of the <b>shallow</b> <b>low</b> thermal maturity pathway. However, the step is overprinted and is observed to disappear through the deep high thermal maturity pathway. The large step of thermal maturity is formed by long-term displacement along an out-of-sequence thrust (OOST) in the deep portion of the wedge.|$|E

40|$|The near-surface rock {{structure}} that covers an abandoned marl mine nearby {{the village of}} Montevecchia (Italy) was investigated {{through a combination of}} seismic surveys performed in two different survey campaigns. The methods selected for these investigations were Refraction Seismics and Multichannel Analysis of Surface Waves (MASW). A sort of transillumination experiment was also attempted. All the methods were successful and gave complementary information. Refraction seismics was used to characterize the <b>shallower</b> <b>low</b> velocity layers and a deeper high velocity layer of the near-surface structure. The MASW method was necessary to assess the existence of a velocity inversion revealing the presence of a low velocity layer between the faster layer identified by refraction seismics and a 4 th high velocity layer covering the upper mine gallery. The transillumination experiment validated the presence of the 4 th layer and gave an estimate of the average velocity that represents a lower boundary for the P-wave velocity within this layer. Both refraction and transillumination data were analysed to derive average estimates of attenuation level and rock quality factor...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Palaeonvironment of the Dalichai Formation, northeastern Semnan, is envisaged {{based on}} 69 samples studied palynologically. Diverse and well-preserved palynofloras, viz., miospores, dinoflagellate cysts, foraminiferal test linings, acritarchs, wood debris (plant tissue) and Amorphous Organic Matters (AOM) {{occur in the}} {{material}} examined. The presence of relatively abundant proximate dinoflagellates and ±laevigate acritarchs in {{the lower part of}} the section studied implies sedimentation in a turbulent shallow environment. However, occurrence in the upper part of the section of abundant chorate dinoflagellates as well as notable proportion of blade-shaped to equal dimensional opaque palynomacerals seem to signify marine incursion and accumulation in an open marine setting. In most of the samples examined, prevalence of transparent AOM denotes a low oxygenated environment and slow rate of accumulation. Moreover, incidence of three palynofacies types (II, IV, VI) in the pertinent material also corroborates a <b>shallow</b> <b>low</b> oxygenated environment with low sedimentation rate which gradually deepened upward in the section...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the Greenland ice sheet is the cause of earthquake suppression in the region. With few exceptions, the observed seismicity extends only along the continental margins of Greenland, which almost coincide with the ice sheet margin. This pattern has been put forward as further validation of the earthquake suppression hypothesis. In this review, new evidence in terms of ice melting, post-glacial rebound and earthquake occurrence is gathered and discussed to re-evaluate the connection between ice mass unloading and earthquake suppression. In Greenland, the spatiotemporal distribution of earthquakes indicates that seismicity is mainly con- fined to regions where the thick layer of ice is absent and where significant ice melting is presently occurring. A clear correlation between seismic activity and ice melting in Greenland is not found. However, earthquake locations and corresponding depth distributions suggest two distinct governing mechanisms: post-glacial rebound promotes moderate-size crustal earthquakes at Greenland’s regional scale, while current ice melting promotes <b>shallow</b> <b>low</b> magnitude seismicity locall...|$|E
40|$|The Trecastagni Fault (TF) is a NNW-SSE tectonic {{structure}} inside Mt. Etna that {{is characterized by}} evident morphological scarps and normal and right-lateral type movements that directly affect roads and buildings. The TF has {{an important role in}} the instability that affects the south-eastern flank of Mt. Etna, and it represents part of the southern boundary of the unstable sector. Starting from 2005, the TF has been monitored using continuous wire extensometers and by carrying out periodic direct measurements across the northern and central sectors. From 2005 to September 2009, the measurements show that the TF has undergone continuous extension of about 2 - 3 mm/yr. During the October 2009 to January 2010 period, the creep rate of the TF reached up to 5. 5 to 7. 0 mm/yr, and this was accompanied by several <b>shallow,</b> <b>low</b> magnitude earthquakes that were felt by local people.

40|$|How {{tropical}} {{low clouds}} change with climate remains the dominant source of uncertainty in global warming projections. An analysis of an ensemble of CMIP 5 climate models reveals {{that a significant}} part of the spread in the models’ climate sensitivity can be accounted by differences in the climatological shallowness of tropical low clouds in weak-subsidence regimes: models with <b>shallower</b> <b>low</b> clouds in weak-subsidence regimes tend to have a higher climate sensitivity than models with deeper low clouds. The dynamical mechanisms responsible for the model differences are analyzed. Competing effects of parameterized boundary-layer turbulence and shallow convection are found to be essential. Boundary-layer turbulence and shallow convection are typically represented by distinct parameterization schemes in current models—parameterization schemes that often produce opposing effects on low clouds. Convective drying of the boundary layer tends to deepen low clouds and reduce the cloud fraction at the lowest levels; turbulent moistening tends to make <b>low</b> clouds more <b>shallow</b> but affects the low-cloud fraction less. The relative importance different models assign to these opposing mechanisms contributes to the spread of the climatological shallowness of low clouds and thus to the spread of low-cloud changes under global warming...|$|R
