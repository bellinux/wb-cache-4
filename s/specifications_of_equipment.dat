40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{depletion}} of {{fossil fuel resources}} on a worldwide basis has necessitated an urgent search for alternative energy sources to meet up the present day demands. Solar energy being a clean, inexhaustible and environment-friendly potential resource among all renewable energy options. But in the present scenario, {{there is a need}} of continuous supply of energy, which cannot be full filled by alone wind energy system or solar photovoltaic system due to seasonal and periodic variations. Therefore, in order to satisfy the load demand the combination of solar and conventional conversion units are now being implemented as a Grid connected energy systems. The objective of this work is to estimate the cost analysis for 4 KW grid connected solar photovoltaic plant and developed a system based on the potential estimations made for a chosen area of 50 m.

40|$|The {{objective}} for the CV Joint Test Stand Thesis is {{to design}} and develop a test stand {{that will allow the}} ability to test a constant velocity (CV) joint with a computer interface for data collection. This thesis concentrates on two separate sections, one is the <b>specification</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> and computer program for data collection, and the second is a moderate outlook on signature analysis of the system. The APRA (Automotive Parts Rebuilders Association) along with the National Center for Remanufacturing and Resource Recovery (NCRRR) are dedicated to the quality and the need for better remanufacturing techniques. The <b>specification</b> <b>of</b> the <b>equipment</b> includes instruments such as an infrared thermocouple, accelerometer, microphone, and a magnetic particle brake. The infrared (IR) thermocouple will be used to check the temperature of the CV Joint. This type of thermocouple was chosen since it {{does not need to be}} permanently mounted on the object it is reading. An accelerometer is used to provide vibration analysis information for the system. The magnetic particle brake will be needed to provide a torque to simulate road like-conditions and to accurately investigate the system. The computer interface will utilize Labview to control and monitor the system during operation. Programming will be done in Labview to complete these tasks. Data files can then be exported to Matlab for further analysis. Finally, a conservative look at the signature analysis of the system will be done to try and correlate CV joint ball wear with noise. No attempt will be made to correlate CV joint wear with temperature and/or vibration at this time. However, this instrumentation can be used for future research...|$|R

The retrospective project assessment was developed from consideration of relevant literature and theoretical principles.

40|$|Advances in {{materials}} technology, information and management systems {{have led to}} improvements in the engineering design, procurement, construction, installation and commissioning of process columns. The development of the front-end engineering design (FEED) process {{has led to the}} incorporation of best practices in the <b>specification</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> on projects during the design phase. The aim of the research is to investigate whether technical specifications {{have an impact on the}} life cycle costs of process columns. Adding to the initial capital cost <b>of</b> <b>equipment,</b> in the form <b>of</b> technical <b>specification</b> requirements, in an attempt to reduce life cycle costs, is always challenged during the project phase of a product life cycle. The principle of designing for the full product life cycle of process columns requires that consideration for both the project and operating life cycle be made at the stage of basic engineering. What is important to note is that the potential for life cycle cost savings at the beginning of a product life cycle is higher than during the operating life cycle. Figure S. 1 illustrates this concept, and what is observed is that the potential for life cycle cost savings diminishes as the product life progresses over time. Process columns were chosen as the type <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> to be investigated based on the nature, size and complexity <b>of</b> the <b>equipment</b> when compared to other equipment on a processing unit. Process columns are amongst the highest capital cost pieces <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> in petrochemical units and usually have many auxiliary pieces <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> associated with it in a system i. e. reboilers, condensers, pumps etc. Dissertation (MEng) [...] University of Pretoria, 2009.
