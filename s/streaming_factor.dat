40|$|International audienceCurrent {{theories}} of consciousness assume a qualitative dissociation between conscious and unconscious processing: while subliminal stimuli only elicit a transient activity, supraliminal stimuli have long-lasting influences. Nevertheless, {{the existence of}} this qualitative distinction remains controversial, as past studies confounded awareness and stimulus strength (energy, duration). Here, we used a masked speech priming method in conjunction with a submillisecond interaural delay manipulation to contrast subliminal and supraliminal processing at constant prime, mask and target strength. This delay induced a perceptual streaming effect, with the prime popping out in the supraliminal condition. By manipulating the prime-target interval (ISI), we show a qualitatively distinct profile of priming longevity as a function of prime awareness. While subliminal priming disappeared after half a second, supraliminal priming was independent of ISI.

To measure retention and to study factors affecting retention, we conducted both long-term and short-term experiments using small dowels as indices of stick retention and pieces of paper as indices of leaf retention. These experiments were done in streams at Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory. In general, we found that both types of CPOM were efficiently retained in all <b>streams.</b> <b>Factors</b> that affected CPOM transport and retention were storms, stream size, stream depth, and the abundance of retention structures in the streams. After initial transport, woody CPOM was transported only during storms. Retention was greater in smaller streams and in shallower stream sites. Rocks, boulders, and woody debris were the most important retention structures. In the stream draining a logged catchment, lower CPOM retention was associated with lower abundance of woody debris dams.

40|$|Wood {{deposited}} in streams provides {{a wide variety}} of ecosystem functions, including enhancing habitat for key species in stream food webs, increasing geomorphic and hydraulic heterogeneity and retaining organic matter. Given the strong role that wood plays in <b>streams,</b> <b>factors</b> that influence wood inputs, retention and transport are critical to stream ecology. Wood entrapment, the process of wood coming to rest after being swept downstream at least 10 m, is poorly understood, yet important for predicting stream function and success of restoration efforts. Data on entrapment were collected {{for a wide range of}} natural wood pieces (n D 344), stream geomorphology and hydraulic conditions in nine streams along the north shore of Lake Superior in Minnesota. Locations of pieces were determined in summer 2007 and again following an overbank stormflow event in fall 2007. The ratio of piece length to effective stream width (length ratio) and the weight of the piece were important in a multiple logistic regression model that explained 25 % of the variance in wood entrapment. Entrapment remains difficult to predict in natural streams, and often may simply occur wherever wood pieces are located when high water recedes. However, this study can inform stream modifications to discourage entrapment at road crossings or other infrastructure by applying the model formula to estimate the effective width required to pass particular wood pieces. Conversely, these results could also be used to determine conditions (e. g. pre-existing large, stable pieces) that encourage entrapment where wood is valued for ecological functions...|$|R

We analyse patterns of turnover in freshwater macroinvertebrate assemblages to identify which communities {{are most likely to}} be at risk from climate change, and the location of geographic barriers that could impede such adaptive range shifts. We analysed macroinvertebrate data from standard biological assessments at the family level, from surveys of all coastal basins of New South Wales, Australia, covering a latitudinal gradient of more than 1000 km. We used variance partitioning to separate the variation in composition explained by climate, among-site distance, human disturbance and other <b>stream</b> <b>factors.</b> Montane <b>stream</b> assemblages showed high turnover in response to climatic variation. Turnover in coastal-fringe streams was least affected by climate, but strongly correlated with distance and stream variables. Significant shifts in assemblage composition occurred between habitats within catchments and across catchment boundaries. Montane stream assemblages are most vulnerable to climate change because their distribution is most responsive to climatic factors, and elevated sites are isolated from one another, reducing the scope for altitudinal migration. Dispersal limitations in coastal-fringe assemblages will also increase their vulnerability to habitat loss from sea-level rise. For all stream classes, the separation of many neighbouring catchment assemblages, owing to either limited dispersal or the lack of suitable habitat, is likely to constrain adaptive range shifts. This would lead to an overall reduction in beta diversity among reaches and subsequently to a reduction in landscape-level gamma diversity. 13 page(s...|$|R

Individually, {{each of these}} factors may have predictable effects or even be inconsequential; however when combined there may be unpredictable and synergistic effects at the population level. We have identified an important population of native Bonneville cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii utah) in Northern Utah that are potentially impacted by livestock grazing and Myxobolus cerebralis the parasite that causes whirling disease. The relationship between the whirling disease life cycle (e. g., tubifex worms), and habitat degradation caused by livestock grazing (e. g., sedimentation) represents an interaction between two factors with strong potential for synergistic effects. We are investigating means to mitigate this interaction by implementing a passive stream restoration project. Spawn Creek, a secondary tributary to the Logan River, was identified as the restoration site, due to its importance {{as a location for}} the spawning and rearing of Bonneville cutthroat trout, occurrence of livestock grazing, and positive tests for the presence in M. cerebralis. Passive restoration was implemented by removing the source of habitat alteration through the exclusion of livestock grazing.

The {{relevance of the}} problem we address lies in the growing concern for the major environmental impacts of increasing nutrient loads from watersheds to freshwater bodies and coastal waters. Here we express the first‐order nutrient loss rate constant, ke, {{as a function of}} key biogeochemical and hydrologic controls, in particular the stream depth (h). The stage h modulates the impact of natural streamflow temporal fluctuations (induced by intermittent rainfall forcings) on the underlying biogeochemical processes and thus represents the major driver of at‐a‐site fluctuations of ke. Novel expressions for the probability distribution function (pdf) of h and ke are derived as a function of a few eco‐hydrologic, morphologic and biogeochemical parameters. The shape of such pdf’s chiefly depends on the following attributes: (1) the average frequency of streamflow‐producing rainfall events, l; (2) the inverse of mean catchment residence time, k; and (3) a <b>stream</b> channel shape <b>factor,</b> identified through the discharge rating curve exponent b. For l/(kb) > 1, h and ke have lower intra‐annual variability and lower sensitivity to climatic and morphologic controls, leading to improved predictability and ease of measurement of these attributes.
