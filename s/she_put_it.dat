5|$|On 23 March 2013, BBC {{released}} a short prequel video to the episode, written by Steven Moffat. In the prequel, the Doctor {{is sitting at}} the swings of a children's playground when he meets a little girl. They talk about losing things, and the Doctor states that he has lost someone twice and he hopes {{he might be able}} to find her again. The girl tells him that, when she loses something, she goes to a quiet place for a think, and then can remember where <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>it.</b> As the girl leaves, it is revealed that she is Clara Oswald.|$|E
5|$|Firestorm tells {{everyone}} that Superman is emitting Kryptonite. Element Woman goes inside Superman's blood stream {{and finds a}} small sliver in his brain. Atom then tells {{everyone that}} <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> there in Kahndaq, {{and that it was}} this that has been causing Superman's illness and loss of control of his powers. The Outsider comes out of the shadows to pick up the box. He tells the heroes that the box is not magic, but science, that was created on his world and can only be opened by someone from his world. He explains that the box opens a gateway to his homeworld, and that he and Atom arrived following the weakening of the barriers between the universes resulting from the Justice League's battle with Darkseid.|$|E

25|$|The next morning, {{the group}} {{sets out to}} {{retrieve}} the ring, which is at a cabin in the valley, which Everett earlier claimed was the location of his treasure. The police, having learned of the place from Pete, arrest the group. Dismissing their claims of receiving pardons, Sheriff Cooley orders them hanged. Just as Everett prays to God, the valley is flooded and they are saved. Tommy finds the ring in a desk that floats by, and they return to town. However, when Everett presents the ring to Penny, it turns out it wasn't her ring, and she doesn't even remember where <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
500|$|Produced {{primarily}} by Timbaland and Danja, Loose showcases Furtado {{experimenting with a}} more R hop sound and, as <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> the [...] "surreal, theatrical elements of '80s music".|$|E
500|$|Though {{some historians}} have criticised Elizabeth on similar grounds, Raleigh's verdict has more often been judged unfair. Elizabeth {{had good reason}} not to place too much trust in her commanders, who once in action tended, as <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> herself, [...] "to be transported with an haviour of vainglory".|$|E
5000|$|In 2010 Maya Tiwari renounced her monastic {{title and}} spiritual honorific—Her Holiness, Sri Swami Mayatitananda—to, as <b>she</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it,</b> “walk a simpler and more {{accessible}} life {{in service of}} the populations in need." ...|$|R

50|$|An old man {{brought back}} two {{fish from the}} market for his daughters. The older one ate hers, but the younger asked her fish {{what to do with}} it. It told her to <b>put</b> <b>it</b> in water, and it might repay her; <b>she</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> in the well.|$|R
500|$|She {{has often}} {{been the target of}} animal rights organisations like PETA, who are angered by her use of fur in Vogue, her pro-fur editorials and her refusal to run paid {{advertisements}} from animal rights organisations. Undeterred, she continues to use fur in photo spreads, saying there's always a way to wear it. [...] "Nobody was wearing fur until <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> on the cover in the early 1990s," [...] says Vogue co-worker Tom Florio. [...] "She ignited the entire industry." ...|$|E
500|$|Loose {{was also}} named partly for the R girl group TLC, who Furtado said she admires for [...] "taking back their sexuality, showing they were {{complete}} women." [...] She {{said she wanted}} the album to be [...] "assertive and cool" [...] and [...] "sexy but fun", like TLC, MC Lyte, Queen Latifah and Janet Jackson, who inspired Furtado because, as <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> she was [...] "comfortable in her sexuality and womanhood" [...] when her 1993 single [...] "That's the Way Love Goes" [...] was released.|$|E
500|$|Mary Shelley and {{her husband}} Percy Bysshe Shelley had lived in Italy from 1818 to 1823. Although Percy Shelley and two of their four {{children}} died there, Italy became for Mary Shelley [...] "a country which memory painted as paradise", as <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>it.</b> The couple's Italian years were a time of intense intellectual and creative activity. Percy composed a series of major poems, and Mary wrote the autobiographical novel Matilda, the historical novel Valperga, and the plays Proserpine [...] and Midas. Mary Shelley {{had always wanted to}} return to Italy and she excitedly planned her 1840 trip. The return was painful as she was constantly reminded of Percy Shelley.|$|E

500|$|Dawson City {{declined}} {{after the}} gold rush. When journalist Laura Berton (future mother of Pierre Berton) moved to Dawson in 1907 {{it was still}} thriving, but away from Front Street, the town had become increasingly deserted, jammed, as <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> [...] "with the refuse of the gold rush: stoves, furniture, gold-pans, sets of dishes, double-belled seltzer bottles... piles of rusting mining machinery—boilers, winches, wheelbarrows and pumps". By 1912, only around 2,000 inhabitants remained compared to the 30,000 of the boom years and the site was becoming a ghost town. By 1972, 500 people were living in Dawson whereas the nearby settlements created during the gold rush had been entirely abandoned. The population has grown since the 1970s, with 1,300 recorded in 2006.|$|E
500|$|Producer Joan Ganz Cooney has stated, [...] "Without research, {{there would}} be no Sesame Street". In 1967, when Cooney and her team began to plan the show's development, {{combining}} research with television production was, as <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> [...] "positively heretical". Shortly after creating Sesame Street, its producers began to develop what came to be called [...] "the CTW model", a system of planning, production, and evaluation that did not fully emerge {{until the end of the}} show's first season. According to Morrow, the CTW model consisted of four parts: [...] "the interaction of receptive television producers and child science experts, the creation of a specific and age-appropriate curriculum, research to shape the program directly, and independent measurement of viewers' learning".|$|E
500|$|While {{the books}} {{could be said}} to {{comprise}} many other themes, such as power/abuse of power, violence and hatred, love, loss, prejudice, and free choice, they are, as Rowling states, [...] "deeply entrenched in the whole plot"; the writer prefers to let themes [...] "grow organically", rather than sitting down and consciously attempting to impart such ideas to her readers. Along the same lines is the ever-present theme of adolescence, in whose depiction Rowling has been purposeful in acknowledging her characters' sexualities and not leaving Harry, as <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> [...] "stuck in a state of permanent pre-pubescence". Rowling has also been praised for her nuanced depiction {{of the ways in which}} death and violence affects youth, and humanity as a whole.|$|E
6000|$|She {{paused for}} a moment. [...] "It is a digression. She divides things. <b>She</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> all wrong. <b>She</b> {{has a way of}} concentrating {{attention}} about herself. She alters the values of things. She prevents my being single-minded, she will prevent Harry being single-minded----" ...|$|R

500|$|Employing Brent Thomson as his new manager, she {{suggested}} that Sylvester rid himself of his androgynous image and wear more masculine clothing {{in order to gain}} a recording contract; as <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> [...] "nobody is giving out recording contracts to drag queens." [...] Thomson opened auditions for new backing singers, with Sylvester being captivated by one of those auditioning, Martha Wash. Sylvester asked her if she had another large black friend who could sing, after which she introduced him to Izora Rhodes. Although he referred to them simply as [...] "the girls", Wash and Rhodes named themselves the Two Tons O' Fun (and much later, when they achieved mainstream success, as The Weather Girls), and continued to work with Sylvester intermittently until his death, developing a close friendship with him. They were soon joined by bassist John Dunstan and keyboard player Dan Reich.|$|E
500|$|Pryce took an {{interest}} in cars while driving a baker's van at the age of 10, before informing his parents {{that he wanted to be}} a racing driver. During an interview with Alan Henry in 1975, he stated that he had wanted to become a pilot, but thought he was not intelligent enough. Like many future Formula One drivers, Pryce had a childhood racing hero. In his case it was Lotus's Scottish driver Jim Clark. Pryce's mother recalled that he was very upset when Clark died at the Hockenheimring in April 1968. His father noted that [...] "he was very upset when Jochen Rindt was killed, too". After he left school at 16, Pryce's mother insisted that he take an apprenticeship as a tractor mechanic at Llandrillo Technical College, giving him [...] "something to fall back on", as <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> if his career as a racing driver was unsuccessful.|$|E
500|$|Though Silent Spring had {{generated}} a fairly {{high level of}} interest based on pre-publication promotion, this became much more intense with the serialization in The New Yorker, {{which began in the}} June 16, 1962, issue. This brought the book {{to the attention of the}} chemical industry and its lobbyists, as well as a wide swath of the American populace. Around that time Carson also learned that Silent Spring had been selected as the Book-of-the-Month for October; as <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> this would [...] "carry it to farms and hamlets all over that country that don't know what a bookstore looks like—much less The New Yorker." [...] Other publicity included a positive editorial in The New York Times and excerpts of the serialized version in Audubon magazine, with another round of publicity in July and August as chemical companies responded. The story of the birth defect-causing drug thalidomide broke just before the book's publication as well, inviting comparisons between Carson and Frances Oldham Kelsey, the Food and Drug Administration reviewer who had blocked the drug's sale in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|She {{insisted that}} her replies are not rants, rather a passionate {{education}} {{for the people who}} write and comment about transgender people in public domain.

5000|$|The song is a ballad, with Brüel {{explaining}} that she behaves in a feminine manner {{for the sake}} of her lover, however she would prefer him not to require it of her.

500|$|Strickland {{was born}} in Blackshear, Georgia to Susan Strickland, a nurse, and Dee Strickland, a high school {{football}} coach, principal and superintendent. KaDee's birthname is Katherine Dee; her parents combined the K in Katherine with her father's name to make KaDee. She was raised in Patterson, Georgia, which she said is a [...] "one-stoplight town", {{and she had a}} job picking tobacco on a local farm for eight years. When she was a child, Strickland watched the Woody Allen film Annie Hall (1975) and was, as <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> [...] "wanting to be in that place, and being completely taken with the energy of those people. I wanted to be in it". During her childhood, she was well known locally {{as a member of the}} Strickland family and for her extracurricular activities and achievements (she was the Homecoming Queen in elementary, middle and high school, the student council president and a cheerleader). She never considered a career in the performing arts until her participation in a one-act play performed by students of her high school: [...] " [...] the minute I set foot on stage, that was it. Destiny took over. There were no other options. I felt like I fit my skin, I knew what I was here to do", Strickland said.|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1967 Cooney took {{a leave of absence}} from WNDT and, funded by Carnegie Corporation, {{traveled}} the U.S. and Canada interviewing experts in child development, education, and television. [...] She reported her findings in a fifty-five-page document entitled [...] "The Potential Uses of Television in Preschool Education". [...] The report, which Gikow called [...] "a schematic for the show Sesame Street would become", described what the new show would look like and proposed the creation of a company that oversaw its production, which eventually became known as the Children's Television Workshop (CTW). [...] Cooney later stated that her undergraduate training in Education helped her research and write the study, and that it, along with her Emmy, provided her with credibility in the eyes of both the experts she interviewed and the new show's funding sources. [...] Davis credited Cooney's motivation to be involved with the project with her journalism skills, learned early in her career, and her idealism, which drove her to want to, as <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> [...] "make a difference". [...] She later told an interviewer, [...] "I could do a thousand documentaries on poverty and poor people that would be watched by a handful of the convinced, but I was never really going to have an influence on my times". [...] She later told Davis, [...] "Preschoolers were not necessarily my thing. [...] It was using television in a constructive way that turned me on".|$|E
2500|$|Short {{approved}} of the NATO bombing of the headquarters of Serbian state television, in which sixteen media workers were killed and sixteen others wounded, because the station was, as <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> [...] "a source of propaganda".|$|E
