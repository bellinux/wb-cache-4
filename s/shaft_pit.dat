50|$|The No 11 coal pit {{was near}} Dalmore Farm; Willie McIlwraith, a farmer there in later years, had a narrow escape when the <b>shaft</b> <b>pit</b> {{collapsed}} whilst he was ploughing over it. A Mowlum steam engine {{was used to}} sink the shaft in 1877 and this was later used at the Hone pit.|$|E
50|$|The {{second type}} of burial, from a later period, also {{consisted}} of <b>shaft</b> <b>pit</b> graves, surrounded by seven concentric circles of poles. Six male graves were found, in which the bodies were extended on their backs, and facing towards the east. Few artifacts were found, except for some traces of copper, or bronze.|$|E
50|$|The Bull Thistle Cave Archaeological Site is {{an archaeological}} {{site on the}} National Register of Historic Places, located in Tazewell County, Virginia. It is a {{vertical}} <b>shaft</b> <b>pit</b> burial cave. The distribution of the skeletal remains indicates that bodies were either thrown or lowered into the cave. On {{the surface of the}} cave floor, researchers have discovered the remains of a minimum of 11 bodies. Based on an artifact recovered from the site, it is estimated that the cave was used for burials between 1300 and 1600 AD.|$|E
50|$|The {{date for}} the first pits around Bishop Sutton are {{uncertain}} but {{there was at least}} one before 1719. By 1824 a collection of four bell pits were identified in field tithe No 1409, and four <b>shaft</b> <b>pits</b> in field tithe No 1428, but they were no longer working.|$|R

5|$|The Pensford {{coal basin}} {{is in the}} {{northern}} part of the coalfield around Bishop Sutton, Pensford, Stanton Drew, Farmborough and Hunstrete. At least one pit was operating near Bishop Sutton before 1719. Four bell pits in Bishop Sutton were marked on field tithe No 1409, and four <b>shaft</b> <b>pits</b> on field tithe No 1428, but were no longer working by 1824.|$|R
50|$|In 1979, {{some of the}} {{earliest}} of the Tarim mummies were discovered in burial sites at Qäwrighul (Gumugou), which is located to the west of Lop Nur, on the Könchi (Kongque) river. Forty-two graves, most of which dated from 2100-1500 BC, were found. There were two types of tomb at the site, belonging to two different time periods. The first type of burial featured <b>shaft</b> <b>pit</b> graves, some of which had poles at either end to mark east and west. Bodies were found extended, usually facing east, and sometimes were wrapped in wool weavings and wearing felt hats. Artefacts found included basketry, wheat grains, cattle and sheep/goat horns, bird bone necklaces and bracelets, nephrite beads, and fragments of copper (or bronze), although no pottery was discovered.|$|E
50|$|One {{unproductive}} <b>shaft</b> (<b>pit</b> 15) {{appears to}} have been turned into a shrine. An altar of flint lumps had been built with a chalk bowl at its base and antler picks piled around. In front of the altar had been placed a Venus figurine of chalk, a chalk phallus and some balls, also of chalk. It may have been an attempt to ensure that the mine remained productive or 'fertile' after this particular shaft turned out to have little flint in it. However, {{it is possible that the}} Venus figurine and the phallus are modern fakes - there is a lack of primary evidence surrounding their recovery in 1939, and rumours circulated at the time of the excavation that they were planted in order to deceive Leslie Armstrong, the archaeologist overseeing the dig.(Piggot 1986: 190, Longworth et al. 1991: 103-105).|$|E
50|$|When {{it became}} viable to mine {{anthracite}} coal in deep <b>shaft</b> <b>pits</b> in the mid-19th century, many pits were sunk in the Rhondda valley, {{one of which}} was located in Ton Pentre - the Maindy Colliery. It was the individual collieries that were {{at the heart of the}} separate 'villages' that emerged on the valley floor as they were the major employers in the area. At the height of the coal mining industry Ton Pentre was home to a few thousand people living in high density terraced houses that spanned the whole valley.|$|R
5000|$|There is {{evidence}} of 700 years of mining in the adjacent village of Emley. [...] Records from the 13th century indicate that monks from Byland Abby mined and smelted iron ore. They mined using bell pits. A pit was sunk {{to a depth of}} 7 meters and worked outward {{from the bottom of the}} <b>shaft.</b> <b>Pits</b> dating back to the 16th century can be seen off Woodhouse Lane. Evidence of bell pits is also clearly visible in the woodlands around Spring Wood, down the hill from Cliffe Woods, in Clayton West.|$|R

50|$|In December 1910 the Hatfield Main Colliery Company {{was formed}} by Emerson Bainbridge. On 11 September 1916 the first main shaft was completed, {{followed}} on 1 April 1917 by the second <b>shaft.</b> The <b>pit</b> exploited coal from the High Hazel coal seam (see Coal Seams of the South Yorkshire Coalfield).|$|R

50|$|On 7 May 1993, {{the mine}} was closed, {{with the loss}} of 1,400 jobs, causing a decline in the local economy. The <b>pit</b> <b>shaft</b> {{headgear}} was demolished the following year.|$|R
50|$|Subsequently {{the term}} was {{transferred}} to the funnel-shaped depressions that formed at the surface above filled or collapsed mineshafts. In lode mining, <b>shafts</b> and <b>pits</b> followed the strike of the lode and left behind the typical lines of Pingen (Pingenzüge) associated with medieval mining that may still be seen, for example, in the Thuringian Forest, the Upper Harz Mountains, the Ore Mountains and the Eschweiler area in central Europe.|$|R
50|$|In {{an effort}} to recover lost output, the Middle <b>Pit</b> <b>shaft</b> (formerly the Ragman) was deepened to the Hardmine seam in 1881, and a new upcast shaft to replace the Laura was sunk to the Cockshead seam.|$|R
50|$|Economically, the Alcimoennis {{thrived on}} iron. The {{surrounding}} soil contains large concentrations of iron, and the thick forests {{on all sides}} delivered adequate fuel for the smelting process. The landscape {{to the west of}} the settlement literally, is covered in pock marks left by shallow mine <b>shafts</b> and <b>pits.</b> The valleys around the city contained vast fields for farming as well as livestock, most notably swine. Fishing probably played an important role in everyday life.|$|R
50|$|The {{force of}} the {{explosion}} caused {{the collapse of the}} Laura Pit and the entire <b>shaft</b> and <b>pit</b> top were abandoned. At the same time the Institute shaft had to be partly filled, in an effort to extinguish the fire. Later, an enquiry into the explosion was held at the nearby Norton Arms Public House, while at Staffords Assizes the Manager, Edwin Thompson, defended himself against a charge of manslaughter and was acquitted.|$|R
50|$|Coal {{was finally}} reached in August 1924, {{at a depth}} of 921.5 yd and was worked from January 1925. The sinking of the second <b>pit</b> <b>shaft</b> was then {{completed}} the following year which was claimed to be the deepest pit in South Yorkshire.|$|R
50|$|The Paulson Mine, {{as well as}} {{the other}} nearby <b>shafts</b> and test <b>pits</b> lie within the {{confines}} of the United States Forest Service's Superior National Forest. It is adjacent to the renown Boundary Waters Canoe Area, {{as well as the}} Kekekabic Trail.|$|R
50|$|Then irony struck: in this dry, arid scrub-land {{that borders}} the Kalahari desert, Otto's hope {{literally}} drowned in water. As the original seTswana name hinted, the town sat {{on top of}} what some old-timers describe as an underground river that is 25 kilometres wide in parts. During the summer rain season, the water level rose to fill every the mine <b>shaft</b> and <b>pit</b> with water faster than it could be pumped with the biggest pumps money could buy - then and now.|$|R
50|$|By the 1930s, {{when most}} of the complex was within the {{ownership}} of Powell Duffryn, the accessible coal reserves had been exhausted from the shallower <b>shafts.</b> Resultantly, their <b>pit</b> head workings were closed on economic grounds, although the workable underground coal faces were consolidated into the remaining shafts.|$|R
50|$|Big Pit was {{originally}} an iron mine, {{driven into the}} side of the mountain not far from the surface due to the shallow iron deposits, the level is called Engine Pit Level and can still be seen on the bridge connecting Blaenavon and Garn Rd at 51.773998, -3.092075 coordinates. The Iron Workings are above the Big Pit coal workings, for some time Engine Pit Level was used as an emergency exit for Big Pit whilst it was working, now the River Arch Level is the escape route. Engine Pit Level was driven around 1810 by hand due to dynamite being invented 5 decades later, there are no known records of the iron mine, although none that I can find.There are a few pictures online showing the interior of the Engine Level from the 60's when miners from Big Pit explored the level, finding an old flange-less wheel'ed dram inside, now at a museum. There was also a known Iron Workings <b>shaft,</b> Engine <b>Pit</b> <b>Shaft</b> which existed, information and location of this shaft can be on Industrial Gwent.|$|R
50|$|Excavation of the Ram Hill site exposed {{more of the}} railway, {{including}} stone blocks with {{cast iron}} chairs in situ {{and the remains of}} a boiler house for a steam engine. Other remains at the site included the foundations of a horse gin and the uncapped <b>shaft</b> of the <b>pit.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{decision}} {{to create a}} new pit at Dawdon was taken by the Marquess of Londonderry in the late 19th century, due to problems at his collieries in nearby Seaham. As Seaham Colliery's workings pushed out to the south-east, it became increasing expensive to mine the reserves from the old <b>pit's</b> <b>shafts.</b>|$|R
50|$|The mill was {{originally}} built {{to run on}} hydropower, transmitted from water turbines throughout the building by mechanical <b>shafting.</b> The wheel <b>pit</b> was {{large enough to accommodate}} twice the capacity required to run the mill. In 1977, three water driven generators were observed with a combined capacity of 2625 kVA (HAER, 6-7).|$|R
50|$|Dr Andrew {{claimed that}} in their {{assessment}} of the extent and impact of mine workings EirGrid had solely relied upon the information received from the GSI and EPA and {{did not appear to}} have conducted any detailed research. The GSI have admitted in correspondence concerning the extent of mine workings in the area that they “..do not necessarily capture the full extent of a feature, particularly if it is inaccessible and impractical..” and thus do not have information detailing the extent of mine workings such as <b>shafts,</b> trial <b>pits,</b> adits, stoped sections of veins and any lateral workings thereon.|$|R
5000|$|In collieries at {{that time}} air {{circulation}} was induced by a furnace {{at the base of}} the upcast pit. Hot air rising up the pit, as if up a chimney, drew the exhausted and contaminated air out of the galleries. Downcast pits let the fresh air in to replace it. The route the air took was carefully controlled by doors and partitions. At Blantye pit number 5 was the upcast <b>shaft</b> for <b>pits</b> 1, 2 and 3. About 5 tons of coal were burnt per day in two out of three grates, each [...] by [...]|$|R

50|$|Radcliffe was {{a mining}} community, once home to over 700 people. A {{colliery}} was worked here until 1892, when a fault in the seam, then fire and flooding, made coal extraction uneconomical. New <b>pit</b> <b>shafts</b> were sunk nearby at Newburgh and later at Hauxley, but flooding remained {{a problem with}} the pits in this area.|$|R
5000|$|The {{effects of}} coal mining in the valley, both from small family owned <b>shafts</b> and major <b>pits</b> alike, caused {{the river to}} become {{polluted}} and dirty with coal dust and other chemicals to {{the point at which}} it was once entirely black in colour, earning it the mainly local nickname of the [...] "Black River".|$|R
50|$|In January 1804 Matthew Fletcher's nephew, Ellis Fletcher (1765-1834), sank a downcast shaft to the Doe {{mine and}} {{equipped}} {{it with a}} steam-powered winding engine. The original single <b>shaft</b> Gal <b>Pit</b> had given problems with access, ventilation and getting coal out of the mine. The second <b>shaft</b> gave the <b>pit</b> a new lease of life and production increased. The old gin winding mechanism on the Gal Pit was abandoned when the second shaft was opened. On the death of Ellis in 1834, the pit {{was taken over by}} his sons Ellis Jnr and John. In 1835, a year after his father John died, Ellis Jnr lost interest, barely keeping the pit going until his own death in 1854. The pit then passed to Charlotte Anne Fletcher. A succession of family, cousins, uncles and sons of these relatives variously owned or worked the mines for the next few years. By 1880, the seams had been almost worked out and the Fletchers lost all interest and sold the mines to the Pilkington brothers, who founded the Pilkington Tile Company on a site close to the Gal Pit.|$|R
50|$|From early {{times the}} miners had viewed the pit with suspicion, {{and it was}} part folk lore, part fright, and part plain superstition, {{that many of the}} {{disasters}} had been attributed to the de’il (the devil) or his henchmen who lived {{at the bottom of the}} <b>shaft</b> in every <b>pit.</b> This old north eastern song confirms the superstition.|$|R
5000|$|In 1853, Sam and Joseph Thomas began sinking a <b>pit</b> <b>shaft</b> {{within the}} remote farming {{community}} {{at the top}} of the Dare Valley. The two shafts were [...] deep, and initially operated by water balance winding, with ventilation from a furnace. Production commenced in 1856, but by 1857 business partner Ebenezer Lewis was the sole owner.|$|R
