25|$|Between {{the source}} and compile level, {{directives}} and build flags {{can be used to}} tune performance options in the source code and compiler respectively, such as using preprocessor defines to disable unneeded software features, optimizing for specific processor models or hardware capabilities, or predicting branching, for instance. Source-based <b>software</b> <b>distribution</b> systems such as BSD's Ports and Gentoo's Portage can take advantage of this form of optimization.|$|E
25|$|OpenBSD is a {{free and}} {{open-source}} Unix-like computer operating system descended from Berkeley <b>Software</b> <b>Distribution</b> (BSD), a Research Unix derivative developed at the University of California, Berkeley. In late 1995, Theo de Raadt forked it from NetBSD. Besides the operating system as a whole, the project maintains portable versions of many subsystems, most notably OpenSSH, which are available as packages in other operating systems.|$|E
25|$|Modern Unix-derivatives are {{generally}} based on module-loading monolithic kernels. Examples {{of this are}} the Linux kernel in its many distributions {{as well as the}} Berkeley <b>software</b> <b>distribution</b> variant kernels such as FreeBSD, DragonflyBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD,and macOS. Apart from these alternatives, amateur developers maintain an active operating system development community, populated by self-written hobby kernels which mostly end up sharing many features with Linux, FreeBSD, DragonflyBSD, OpenBSD or NetBSD kernels and/or being compatible with them.|$|E

25|$|A {{subgroup}} of the Unix {{family is the}} Berkeley <b>Software</b> <b>Distribution</b> family, which includes FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD. These operating systems are most commonly found on webservers, although they can also function as a personal computer OS. The Internet owes much of its existence to BSD, {{as many of the}} protocols now commonly used by computers to connect, send and receive data over a network were widely implemented and refined in BSD. The World Wide Web was also first demonstrated on a number of computers running an OS based on BSD called NeXTSTEP.|$|E
25|$|Also in 1975, Ken Thompson took {{a sabbatical}} from Bell Labs {{and came to}} Berkeley as a visiting professor. He helped to install Version 6 Unix and started working on a Pascal {{implementation}} for the system. Graduate students Chuck Haley and Bill Joy improved Thompson's Pascal and implemented an improved text editor, ex. Other universities {{became interested in the}} software at Berkeley, and so in 1977 Joy started compiling the first Berkeley <b>Software</b> <b>Distribution</b> (1BSD), which was released on March 9, 1978. 1BSD was an add-on to Version 6 Unix rather than a complete operating system in its own right. Some thirty copies were sent out.|$|E
25|$|In 1977, a {{graduate}} student in the computer science department named Bill Joy (MS 1982) assembled the original Berkeley <b>Software</b> <b>Distribution,</b> commonly known as BSD Unix. Joy, who went on to co-found Sun Microsystems, also developed the original version of the terminal console editor vi, while Ken Arnold (BA 1985) created Curses, a terminal control library for Unix-like systems that enables the construction of text user interface (TUI) applications. Working alongside Joy at Berkeley were undergraduates William Jolitz (BS 1997) and his future wife Lynne Jolitz (BA 1989), who together created 386BSD, a version of BSD Unix that runs on Intel CPUs and evolved into the BSD family of free operating systems and the Darwin operating system underlying Apple Mac OS X. Eric Allman (BS 1977, MS 1980) created SendMail, a Unix mail transfer agent that delivers about 12% of the email in the world.|$|E
50|$|This {{software}} development and release cycle can be disruptive for cyclical rolling release <b>software</b> <b>distributions</b> based on primary development branches, {{due to the}} freeze period and the subsequent sudden discontinuity in stability and software bugs, as most rolling release distributions try to maintain a steady and consistent user experience. This conflict arises due to the inherent difference between rolling release and non-rolling release {{software development}} models, hence making this a challenge for all cyclical rolling release <b>software</b> <b>distributions</b> to overcome.|$|R

25|$|Windows 8, the {{successor}} to Windows 7, was released generally on October 26, 2012. A number of significant changes were made on Windows 8, including {{the introduction of a}} user interface based around Microsoft's Metro design language with optimizations for touch-based devices such as tablets and all-in-one PCs. These changes include the Start screen, which uses large tiles that are more convenient for touch interactions and allow for the display of continually updated information, and a new class of apps which are designed primarily for use on touch-based devices. Other changes include increased integration with cloud services and other online platforms (such as social networks and Microsoft's own OneDrive (formerly SkyDrive) and Xbox Live services), the Windows Store service for <b>software</b> <b>distribution,</b> and a new variant known as Windows RT for use on devices that utilize the ARM architecture. An update to Windows 8, called Windows 8.1, was released on October 17, 2013, and includes features such as new live tile sizes, deeper OneDrive integration, and many other revisions. Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 has been subject to some criticism, such as removal of the Start menu.|$|E
25|$|The <b>software</b> <b>distribution</b> of {{a product}} can be done offline as well as online. In an offline {{situation}} the package is a physical package which contains all the elements. The software is stored on a data carrier such as a CD or a DVD, and the documents might also be stored in a digital form on this data carrier, or they might be in physical form such as a booklet. The package {{as a whole is}} a physical product. In an online situation the entire package needs to be in a digital form. The consequences on the distribution process are described in the following paragraphs. CCU is designed to fit both situations but as bandwidth is growing it is making more sense to distribute especially updates and new versions to existing customers online. In this article both ways are discussed. In the process-data model it is assumed that the software vendor conducts both distribution channels. As a practical example: HISComp, a provider of medical information systems distributes its software straightforward via CDs. However they use their website to distribute patches for the software products.|$|E
25|$|Because {{of lower}} incomes and the {{domination}} of the Sinclair Spectrum in the UK, almost all British C64 software used cassette tapes. Few cassette C64 programs were released in the US after 1983, and in North America the diskette was the principal method of <b>software</b> <b>distribution.</b> The cartridge slot on the C64 was also mainly a feature used in the computer's first two years {{on the market and}} became rapidly obsolete once the price and reliability of 1541 drives improved. A handful of PAL region games used bank switched cartridges to get around the 16k memory limit. C64 cartridges normally map into $8000 and depending on the ROM size may extend up to $BFFF, in which case they displace the BASIC ROM. A special ID string is checked for on power-up; if found, the kernel will jump to the starting address specified in the ID string. A few early C64 cartridges released in 1982, used the so-called MAX Mode, a leftover feature of the failed MAX Machine. These cartridges map into $F000 rather than $8000 and displace the kernel ROM. If MAX Mode is used, the programmer will have to provide his own code for handling system interrupts. Disk and tape software normally load at the start of BASIC memory ($801) and use a small BASIC stub (e.g. 10 SYS(2064)) to jump {{to the start of the}} program. Although no Commodore 8-bit machine except the C128 can automatically boot from a floppy disk, some software intentionally overwrites certain BASIC vectors in the process of loading so that execution begins automatically rather than requiring the user to type RUN at the BASIC prompt following loading.|$|E
5000|$|The {{distinction}} between rolling release <b>software</b> <b>distributions</b> and development branches of standard release <b>software</b> <b>distributions</b> is often overlooked by users inexperienced with rolling distributions. This {{can lead to}} confused comments, such as: [...] "distro-X is a rolling distribution if you use its development branch" [...] — where distro-X is a standard release distribution. Even in rare cases where the development branch is a rolling (versus the more common cyclical) development branch, this {{does not make the}} distribution rolling. Unlike standard release distributions, rolling release distributions do not have development branches.|$|R
50|$|<b>Software</b> <b>{{distributions}},</b> {{of which}} Linux distributions form a sizable proportion, are {{commonly referred to}} as distros, with rolling release distributions {{commonly referred to as}} rolling distros. When used as an adjective, instead of a noun, rolling release is often shortened to rolling, when referring to <b>distributions,</b> <b>software,</b> or development models.|$|R

500|$|FreeBSD is a {{free and}} {{open-source}} Unix-like operating system descended from Research Unix via the Berkeley <b>Software</b> <b>Distribution</b> (BSD). Although for legal reasons FreeBSD cannot use the Unix trademark, it is a direct descendant of BSD, which was historically also called [...] "BSD Unix" [...] or [...] "Berkeley Unix". The first version of FreeBSD was released in 1993, and as of 2005 FreeBSD was {{the most widely used}} open-source BSD distribution, accounting for more than three-quarters of all installed systems running open-source BSD derivatives.|$|E
500|$|Another <b>software</b> <b>distribution</b> {{method was}} to {{broadcast}} the audio stream from the cassette on another medium and have users record it onto an audio cassette themselves. In radio or television shows in many European countries, the host would describe a program, instruct {{the audience to}} connect a cassette tape recorder to the radio or TV and then broadcast the program over the airwaves in audio format. [...] Some magazines distributed 7" [...] 33⅓ rpm flexidisc records, a variant of regular vinyl records which could be played on a standard record player. These disks were known under various trademarked names including [...] "Floppy ROM", [...] "Flexisoft", and [...] "Discoflex".|$|E
