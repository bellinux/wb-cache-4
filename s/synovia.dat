Two field studies found an association between the eggshell apex abnormalities (EAA) and infection with Mycoplasma <b>synoviae.</b> M. <b>synoviae</b> was isolated from the oviduct of birds that produced abnormal eggs, but not from birds in control flocks, although both affected and control birds had agglutinating antibodies against M. <b>synoviae.</b> After a single injection with long acting oxytetracycline, the production of abnormal eggs ceased, but then reoccurred about 12 days later. A causal relationship between EAA and M. <b>synoviae</b> infection was subsequently demonstrated experimentally. EAA occurred after intratracheal inoculation of birds with M. <b>synoviae,</b> and even more frequently in birds infected with infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) five days before inoculation of M. <b>synoviae.</b> EAA also occurred, but {{to a lesser extent}} than in previous groups, in birds inoculated intravenously (i. v.) with M. <b>synoviae</b> and infected with IBV.

40|$|Major poultry {{pathogens}} M. gallisepticum and M. <b>synoviae</b> share {{a gene encoding}} a putative cysteine protease CysP {{similar to}} papain cysteine (CaA subfamily). Comparison of the cysP gene sequences of 18 M. <b>synoviae</b> and 10 M. gallisepticum strains sequenced in this study showed polymorphisms, including deletions. Seven M. <b>synoviae</b> strains, including the type strain WVU 1853, had a 39 bp deletion in the 32 ฬ 7 end of the cysP gene. In the same cysP region, all M. gallisepticum strains showed a deletion of 66 bp. Immunoblot analysis with specific antibpodies demonstrated that M. <b>synoviae</b> strains expressed CysP, which was approximately 65 kDa. both M. <b>synoviae</b> and M. gallisepticum were able to digest chicken IgG (cIgG). Incubation of cIgG (- 170 kDa) with M. <b>synoviae</b> or M. gallisepticum cells (- 15 h at 37 oC) resultes in a papain-like cleavage pattern of cIgG and fragments corresponding to the antigenbinding fragment of IgG (Fab, - 45 kDa) and the crystallizable region fragment (Fc) of the IgG heavy chain (dimer of - 60 kDa).

RESULTS: The expression of heparan sulfate on microvascular endothelial cells was demonstrated in RA and nonrheumatoid <b>synovia.</b> Using antibodies to syndecan- 1 - 4 and glypican- 1, - 3, and - 4, the selective expression of syndecan- 3 by endothelial cells was detected in RA and nonrheumatoid <b>synovia.</b> In addition, RT-PCR showed the presence of syndecan- 3 messenger RNA in endothelial cells extracted from RA and nonrheumatoid <b>synovia.</b> (125) I-CXCL 8 bound to venular endothelial cells; treatment with heparinases I and III significantly reduced this binding in RA but not nonrheumatoid <b>synovia.</b> (125) I-CXCL 8 binding was not reduced after treatment with PI-PLC, which cleaves glycosyl phosphatidylinositol linkages, suggesting that CXCL 8 did not bind to glypicans.

The effect of proinflammatory cytokines (IL 1 ฮฒ and TNFฮฑ), and of antirheumatic drugs (salicylic acid, dexamethasone, and methotrexate) on the ฮฑ 6 and ฮฒ 1 expression of cultured normal FBS and FBS from patients with OA and RA was determined by flow cytometry. โจRESULTSโIn normal <b>synovia</b> and in OA <b>synovia</b> samples with a low grade of inflammation, synovial lining cells (SLC) showed a parallel expression and distribution of ฮฑ 6 and laminin. In <b>synovia</b> samples of OA with a higher grade of inflammation and in the majority of RA <b>synovia</b> samples laminin was pericellularly distributed in a low number of SLC, whereas ฮฑ 6 was expressed on the surface of a high number of SLC. In RA <b>synovia</b> samples with severe inflammatory changes the gradual loss of laminin generally corresponded to a decrease of the ฮฑ 6 integrin subunit. ฮฒ 1 was always strongly expressed in all <b>synovia</b> samples detected. Proinflammatory cytokines up regulated the expression of ฮฑ 6 and ฮฒ 1 on OA-FBS, whereas these effectors decreased ฮฑ 6 and ฮฒ 1 on RA-FBS. In contrast, antirheumatic drugs, in particular methotrexate and dexamethasone, reduced the expression of ฮฑ 6 and ฮฒ 1 on OA-FBS, whereas the same treatment on RA-FBS stimulated {{the expression of the}}se integrin subunits. โจCONCLUSIONโThe gradual loss of laminin in chronic synovitis may contribute to the altered expression of ฮฑ 6 in SLC. IL 1 ฮฒ and TNFฮฑ down regulated the expression of the ฮฑ 6 and ฮฒ 1 integrin subunits on long term cultures of FBS derived from RA. Therefore, these cytokines may be among the effectors regulating the expression of the ฮฑ 6 integrin subunit in SLC in vivo. As antirheumatic drugs increase the expression of ฮฑ 6 on RA-FBS, the presence of the laminin receptor may confer a protective effect on the <b>synovia</b> in vivo. โจโจ Keywords: laminin; alpha 6; integrins; rheumatoid arthritis; osteoarthriti...|$|E

40|$|The {{increased}} {{clinical and}} economic relevance of M. <b>synoviae</b> a poultry pathogen causing arthritis and eggshell apex abnormalities and egg production drops prompted the Dutch poultry industry {{to launch a}} mandatory control and eradication programme for this mycoplasma species in 2013 This programme is based on monitoring of commercial poultry aiming at detection of infected flocks improving awareness, and the implementation of control measures to prevent vertical and horizontal transmission. The success of a disease control and eradication programme depends on the accurate and early detection of infected flocks. This is achieved by the regular monitoring of flocks, using adequate diagnostic tests. A qPCR {{for the detection of}} M. <b>synoviae</b> in case of infectious synovitis in poultry was developed and may as such contribute to the reduction of economic damage due to this disease. Adequate diagnostics become especially relevant when intervention strategies such as live M. <b>synoviae</b> vaccination are introduced as they jeopardize seromonitoring due to the induction of vaccinal antibodies. To overcome these problems development of a DIVA (differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals) PCR is beneficial. Test parameters of the differentiating M. <b>synoviae</b> qPCR were excellent, while field validation yielded good results also. Horizontal spread of the MS-H live vaccine strain from vaccinated to non-vaccinated birds located at different houses on the same farm was demonstrated. The test is recommended for assessing freedom from field M. <b>synoviae</b> in MS-H vaccinated flocks, but {{can also be used to}} determine shedding of MS-H. Using this PCR it was shown that vaccination with MS-H significantly reduced the shedding and horizontal spread of a M. <b>synoviae</b> challenge strain. Based on this findings this vaccine could be used in successive rearing flocks to populate M. <b>synoviae</b> infected multiple age layer farms. Although elimination of infected flocks can be a very effective disease control strategy in case of low prevalence, this is not attainable in poultry categories with high prevalence. In such cases antibiotic treatment and vaccination may be used to diminish the impact of clinical signs. Drawbacks of antibiotic treatment are the occurrence of resistance, residues and birds remain infected despite treatment. Furthermore, vaccination may help to prevent or reduce clinical signs it does not protect against infection with field M. <b>synoviae.</b> One of the main pillars in a control and eradication programme is the implementation of effective biosecurity measures to separate M. <b>synoviae</b> free flocks from those infected.

(3) IL- 10, but not IL- 4, IL- 13 or IFN-ฮณ, is produced by rheumatoid <b>synovia</b> and IL- 10 is the major anti-inflammatory cytokine in rheumatoid <b>synovia.</b> (4) Peptide containing nuclear localization sequence of NF-ฮบB p 50 inhibits TNF-ฮฑ-induced IL- 6 and IL- 8 production. These data indicates that imbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines would contribute to the persistence of synovial inflammation of RA and that NF-ฮบB is a novel target of therapeutic approach against RA...|$|E

Its prevention is done by vaccination with live attenuated (lentogenic strains) and/or killed vaccines. The lentogenic strains can lead to strong post-vaccination reaction, principally due {{to the presence of}} other pathogenic agents. Among them, Mycoplasma <b>synoviae</b> is worldwide important, mainly in Brazil.

40|$|International audienceMajor poultry pathogens, Mycoplasma gallisepticum and Mycoplasma <b>synoviae</b> share several genes, {{including}} nanH that encodes their sialidases (neuraminidases). Previous {{studies have}} shown considerable differences in neuraminidase enzymatic activity (NEAC) in M. <b>synoviae</b> strains and NEAC absence in individual cultures of two strains, ULB 925 and ULB 9122. This study showed that their cultures lacking NEAC did not express NanH neuraminidase detectable by specific antibodies. In cultures of M. <b>synoviae</b> ULB 925 and ULB 9122, which lacked NEAC and detectable NanH, deletions of a single adenine in different nanH regions of each strain created translational frameshifts resulting in TAA (UAA) stop codons and premature termination of translation. ULB 925 and ULB 9122 with such nanH mutations did not desialylate reference fetuin and transferrin or chicken glycoproteins which M. <b>synoviae</b> strains with NEAC efficiently desialylated. They desialylated several chicken serum glycoproteins with SAฮฑ(2 - 6) gal moieties, including immunoglobulin G heavy chain. Neuraminidase inhibitor 2, 3 -didehydro- 2 -deoxy-N-acetylneuraminic acid (DANA) inhibited such desialylation otherwise caused by M. <b>synoviae</b> WVU 1853 neuraminidase. WVU 1853 also cleaved sialic acid from SAฮฑ(2 - 3) gal moieties from glycoproteins of mucus from chicken tracheas.

40|$|AbstractChemokine receptors on leukocytes {{mediate the}} {{recruitment}} and accumulation of these cells within affected joints in chronic inflammatory {{diseases such as}} rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Identification of involved receptors offers potential for development of therapeutic interventions. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the expression of orphan receptor GPR 15 /BOB in the synovium of RA and non-RA patients and in peripheral blood of RA patients and healthy donors. GPR 15 /BOB protein and messenger RNA expression were examined in RA and non-RA synovium by immunofluorescence and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) respectively. GPR 15 /BOB expression on peripheral blood leukocytes was analysed by flow cytometry and GPR 15 /BOB messenger RNA was examined in peripheral blood monocytes by RT-PCR. GPR 15 /BOB protein was observed in CD 68 + and CD 14 + macrophages in <b>synovia,</b> with greater expression in RA <b>synovia.</b> GPR 15 /BOB protein was expressed in all patient <b>synovia</b> whereas in non-RA <b>synovia</b> expression was low or absent. Similarly GPR 15 /BOB messenger RNA was detected in all RA and a minority of non-RA <b>synovia.</b> GPR 15 /BOB protein was expressed on peripheral blood leukocytes from RA and healthy individuals with increased expression by monocytes and neutrophils in RA. GPR 15 /BOB messenger RNA expression was confirmed in peripheral blood monocytes. In conclusion GPR 15 /BOB is expressed by macrophages in synovial tissue and on monocytes and neutrophils in peripheral blood, and expression is up-regulated in RA patients compared to non-RA controls. This orphan receptor on monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils may play a role in RA pathophysiology...|$|E

40|$|Osteoarthritis (OA) is {{a chronic}} primary non-inflammatory joint disease with varying etiologies. OA {{is caused by}} unphysiologicaly {{increased}} stress on healthy cartilage, e. g. trauma, luxation and fracture. Another cause is pressure exerted on an anatomically abnormal joint, e. g. hip dysplasia (HD), osteochondritis dissecans (OCD), fragmented coronoid process (FPC) or ununited anconeal process (UAP). Secondary reactions follow and so explain the term OA. In this study the Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was examined and correlated {{to the degree of}} osteoarthirtic changes and the severity of clinical symptoms. Furthermore the MPO activity of <b>synovia</b> and serum were determined. <b>Synovia</b> and serum samples were collected and examined from 137 dogs suffering from OA. The dogs were devided into groups of patients suffering from either OCD/Shoulder (n = 12), OCD/Elbow (n = 10), FPC (n = 37), UPA (n = 3), HD (n = 13), Rupture of the cranial cruciate ligament (CCL) /duration of lameness 5 d (n = 21), Patella Luxation (n = 5) and control group (n = 11). As control group, dogs were used which did not show orthopedic disfunctions or signs of OA in clinical or X-ray examination. The clinical examination comprised the general condition, duration of lameness, inspection of the musculoskeletal system and X-ray examination of the diseased joint. The <b>synovia</b> was macroscopically examined, the nucleated cells counted and differentiated. Total protein, viscosity, specific weight and MPO activity were also determined. In the serum the MPO activity was also examined. The MPO activity was assessed by utilising the H 2 O 2 -dependent oxidation of O-dianisidine. Clinical, surgical and X-ray findings were scaled according to the severity of the case, ranging from grade 0 (free) to grade 3 (high-grade OA). Macroscopically the <b>synovia</b> of all patients was slightly opaque and showed minimally reduced viscosity. The cell count ranged from 250 - 4325 /&# 956;l (M: 1380 /&# 956;l), the fraction of mononuclear cells averaged around 97 - 99 %. The amount of total protein was between 2, 0 - 4, 8 g/dl (M: 3, 4 g/dl). The synovial MPO activity of the patients varied between 0, 23 - 2, 88 &# 956;U/ 200 &# 956;l, the median ranged from 0, 74 &# 956;U/ 200 &# 956;l to 1, 49 &# 956;U/ 200 &# 956;l. A significant difference in MPO activity of the <b>synovia</b> between patients with the different diseases could not be determined. The MPO values of control animals were between 0, 02 - 0, 23 &# 956;U/ 200 &# 956;l, the median was 0, 05 &# 956;U/ 200 &# 956;l. Therefore the MPO activity in the <b>synovia</b> of the patients was significantly higher than in the control animals. The values were 15 - 30 fold higher than those of the control groups. The MPO activity of the patients in the serum ranged between 0, 88 - 2, 26 &# 956;U/ 200 &# 956;l and in the control group between 0, 70 - 1, 62 &# 956;U/ 200 &# 956;l. A correlation between MPO activity in the <b>synovia</b> and the serum could not be found. The synovial MPO activity correlates with a loss of synovial viscosity, which is due to the destruction of hyaluronan by the oxidative products of MPO. Elevated MPO activity was detected during increased cell counts in the <b>synovia.</b> This is a sign of MPO secretion, as MPO is stored in granules of neutrophils or monocytes. A correlation between X-ray and intraoperative macroscopic findings and MPO activity was not found. Correlations could be found between clinical OA signs and MPO activity in the <b>synovia.</b> Patients with a high grade OA had a strikingly increased synovial MPO activity. Therefore the MPO activity in the <b>synovia</b> {{can be used as a}} measurement of clinical features, such as pain and impaired function...|$|E

40|$|The {{complex interplay}} between Mycoplasma <b>synoviae</b> and chicken chondrocytes (CCH), which come into direct contact during {{infectious}} synovitis, has been examined {{at the level}} of gene expression. Our previous studies demonstrated a significant influence of M. <b>synoviae</b> on the level of CCH gene expression. Here, we show {{for the first time that}} in vitro co-cultivation of M. <b>synoviae</b> and CCH also induces upregulation of gene expression in this mycoplasma. We observed significantly increased expression of genes important for M. <b>synoviae</b> pathogenicity, including cysteine protease cysP, neuraminidase nanH, haemagglutinin vlhA, and the putative nuclease MS 53 _ 0284. Moreover, the pattern of gene expression was dependent on the infection environment. In CCH, significant changes in the expression of genes encoding catabolic enzymes of the cartilage extracellular matrix (cathepsins B, K and L, aggrecanase ADAM 10, and matrix metalloproteinase MMP 2) were demonstrated.

Decreased susceptibility to enrofloxacin was identified in 59 % of strains, with theMICs ranging from 1 to> 16 g/ml. The estimatedMIC 50 andMIC 90 values for enrofloxacin were 2 and 8 g/ml, respectively. Moreover, {{this study showed that}} 92 % of recent Israeli field isolates (2009 to 2011) ofM. <b>synoviae</b> have MICs of> 2 g/ml to enrofloxacin. Compari-son of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) inM. <b>synoviae</b> isolates revealed a clear correlation between the presence of one of the amino acid substitutions Asp 79 -Asn, Thr 80 -Ala/Ile, Ser 81 -Pro, and Asp 84 -Asn/Tyr/His of the ParC QRDR and decreased susceptibility to enrofloxacin (MIC,> 1 g/ml). Amino acid substitutions at positions GyrA 87, GyrB 401 / 402, and ParE 420 / 454 were also identified, but there was no clear-cut correlation with susceptibility to enrofloxacin. Comparison of vlhAmolecular profiles revealed the presence of 9 different genotypes in the IsraeliM. <b>synoviae</b> field isolates and 10 genotypes in the European isolates; only one vlhA genotype (type 4) was identified in both cohorts.
