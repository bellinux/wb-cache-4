It is enabled through sequencing or array genotyping of parental inbred lines while using low-cost, low-density genotyping technologies for their segregating progenies. For purposes of data analyses of NAM populations, parental genotypes at a large number of Single Nucleotide Polymorphic (SNP) loci need to be projected to their <b>segregating</b> <b>progeny.</b> Herein we demonstrate how approximately 0. 5  million SNPs that have been genotyped in 26 parental lines of the publicly available maize NAM population can be projected onto their <b>segregating</b> <b>progeny</b> using only 1, 106 SNP loci that have been genotyped in both the parents and their 5, 000 progeny. The challenge is to estimate both the genotype and genetic location of the parental SNP genotypes in <b>segregating</b> <b>progeny.</b> Both challenges were met by estimating their expected genotypic values conditional on observed flanking markers through the use of both physical and linkage maps. About 90 %, of 500, 000 genotyped SNPs from the maize HapMap project, were assigned linkage map positions using linear interpolation between the maize Accessioned Gold Path (AGP) and NAM linkage maps.

40|$|The {{most serious}} {{diseases}} for the barley crop in Southern Europe environments, where mildew and other leaf fungi {{have a relatively}} small or not significant effect on yields, are the soil-borne barley yellow mosaic virus (BaYMV), the aphid-borne {{barley yellow dwarf virus}} (BYDV) and the seed-borne fungus Pyrenophora graminea (leaf stripe). Developing barley cultivars resistant to the three diseases, while being an urgent objective of barley breeding, in a context of increasing organic farming for cereals, encounters several problems and cultivars resistant to all the former diseases are not yet available. The problems of barley breeding for resistance to BYDV are the availability of sources of resistance, mainly based on semi-dominant Yd 2 gene, and the labour-intensive inoculation test made with infected aphids. Availability of resistant cultivars and inoculation test is easier for BaYMV and, in relative terms, also for leaf stripe. Indeed, in normal breeding schemes is quite difficult and anyway expensive to perform all resistance tests on the <b>segregating</b> <b>progenies.</b> For these reasons, it has been developed few years ago a "gene pyramiding" MAS (molecular-assisted selection) scheme to introduce four loci of resistance - two to leaf stripe, and one each to BYDV and BaYMV - into the elite winter barley cultivar Nure. Nure is in fact a highly yielding cultivar, adapted to Southern European environments, but lacking of most important resistances. STS and SSR markers have been adapted to the aim and applied to <b>segregating</b> <b>progenies</b> together with phenotypic selection for agronomic traits.

40|$|A {{reciprocal}} chromosomal transposition {{was identified}} in several annual oilseed Brassica napus genotypes used as parents in crosses to biennial genotypes for genetic mapping studies. The transposition involved {{an exchange of}} interstitial homeologous regions on linkage groups N 7 and N 16, and its detection {{was made possible by}} the use of segregating populations of doubled haploid lines and codominant RFLP markers.

Although it included approximately one-third of the physical length of the N 7 and N 16 chromosomes, few recombination events within the region were recovered in the progenies of the hybrids. Significantly higher seed yields were associated with the parental configurations of the rearrangement in <b>segregating</b> <b>progenies.</b> These progenies contained complete complements of homeologous chromosomes from the diploid progenitors of B. napus, and thus their higher seed yields provide evidence for the selective advantage of allopolyploidy through the fixation of intergenomic heterozygosity...|$|R

The mVe 1 gene has a coding region of 3, 051 bp. The predicted mVe 1 protein contains a leucine-rich repeat domain, a common feature of plant disease resistance proteins.

Seed stocks in which heterozygous plants could be identified phenotypically were treated with a chemical mutagen. These seed stocks were heterozygous for recessive genetic markers, and/or heterozygous for a chromosome translocation. Spikes from heterozygous M 1 plants were harvested and seeded in bulk. Spikes from heterozygous M 2 plants were harvested and planted in M 3 rows. The M 3 rows were observed {{for the absence of}} <b>segregating</b> <b>progeny</b> and/or were observed cytologically for the presence of a heterozygous translocation. M 3 rows not segregating for the genetic markers were crossed onto plants homozygous for the genetic markers. The F 1 progenies were observed for an expected ratio of 1 normal: 1 recessive plant. All nonsegregating lines were found to be non-heterozygous. These lines most likely occurred due to seed and pollen contamination or were the result of crossing over between genetic markers. Fertile M 2 plants were harvested from the treated heterozygous translocation seed stock. Normally, barley plants heterozygous for a translocation will produce semisterile spikes. Plants that would normally be semisterile but are fertile could be carrying a mutation conditioning apomixis. Progeny of the fertile M 2 plants were examined cytologically for the presence of the heterozygous translocation. All selected lines contained the normal seven pairs of chromosomes and were the result of seed or pollen contamination. Seed stocks which could eliminate the problem of contamination in future experiments were developed and discussed. Haploviable mutants closely linked with the male sterile locus, msg 2, were isolated in these seed stocks. Haploviable mutants are recognized by upset genetic ratios of alleles linked with the mutant. Selfed progenies of plants carrying a haploviable mutation contained fertile and male sterile plants in about a 1 : 1 ratio.

In a few cases, mouse and zebrafish, this cell death is mediated by an auxilin (Lee et al. 2008; Bai et al. 2010). In soybean, overexpression of a type III J-protein (GmHsp 40.1) caused necrotic cell death (Liu and Whitham 2013). Although, a relationship between auxilin-like proteins and cell death has not been previously observed in plants, the development of cell death lesions {{in many of the}} XB 21 -overexpressing plants suggests that XB 21 is at least partially involved in this cell death phenotype.

Differences in expressivity and interactions of these genes are responsible for the wide variation of the mode of reproduction. Apospory and parthenogenesis as well as the initiator and preventer genes of these components segregate independently. The genotypes with the highest expressivity of apospory and parthenogenesis were assigned as Ait-/apvapv/Pit-/ppvppv, those with intermediate expressivity as Ait-/Apv-/Pit-/Ppv-, and those with low expressivity as aitait/apvapv/pitpit/ppvppv. Among the self progenies of obligate sexual individuals, plants with a low capacity for apospory and/or parthenogenesis occurred, indicating that the sexual parents were heterozygous for the preventer genes and homozygous for the recessive initiator alleles (aitait/Apv-/pitpit/Ppv-).

The present work shows that the genes at all of the loci examined (Le, Cry, and Na) also exert an effect on internode length in plants grown in complete darkness. Preliminary results using pure lines were verified using either <b>segregating</b> <b>progenies</b> or near isogenic lines. The major cause of the differences was due to a change in the number of cells per internode rather than to an alteration of the cell length. Since the genes occupying at least two of these loci, Le and Na, {{have been shown to be}} directly involved with gibberellin metabolism, it appears that gibberellins are not only essential for elongation in the dark but are limiting for elongation in the nana (extremely short, na), dwarf (Na le), and tall (Na Le) phenotypes. These results are supported by the large inhibitory effects of AMO 1618 treatments on stem elongation in dwarf and tall lines grown in the dark and the fact that applied gibberellic acid could overcome this inhibition and greatly promote elongation in a gibberellin-deficient na line.

There is a wider appreciation that simply demonstrating that a complex trait can be dissected into QTLs and mapped to approximate genomic locations using DNA markers would not serve {{the ultimate goal of}} trait improvement. In facing the challenge of improving several lines for quantitative traits, MAS strategies use DNA markers in one key selection step to maximize their impact.

The genes {{are expressed in}} different tissues and organs during development; however, their exact role in barley is poorly understood. It has already been proven that RNA interference (RNAi) -based silencing of HvCKX 1 decreased the CKX level, especially in those organs which showed the highest expression, i. e. developing kernels and roots, leading to higher plant productivity and higher mass of the roots [1]. The same type of RNAi construct was applied to silence HvCKX 2 and analyze {{the function of the}} gene. Two cultivars of barley were transformed with the same silencing and selection cassettes by two different methods: biolistic and via Agrobacterium. Results The mean Agrobacterium -mediated transformation efficiency of Golden Promise was 3. 47 % (± 2. 82). The transcript level of HvCKX 2 in <b>segregating</b> <b>progeny</b> of T 1 lines was decreased to 34 %. The reduction of the transcript in Agrobacterium -derived plants resulted in decreased CKX activity in the developing and developed leaves as well as in 7 DAP (days after pollination) spikes. The final phenotypic effect was increased productivity of T 0 plants and T 1 lines. Higher productivity {{was the result of the}} higher number of seeds and higher grain yield. It was also correlated with the higher 1000 grain weight, increased (by 7. 5 %) height of the plants and higher (from 0. 5 to 2) numbers of spikes. The transformation efficiency of Golden Promise after biolistic transformation was more than twice as low compared to Agrobacterium. The transcript level in <b>segregating</b> <b>progeny</b> of T 1 lines was decreased to 24 %. Otherwise, the enzyme activity found in the leaves of the lines after biolistic transformation, especially in cv. Golden Promise, was very high, exceeding the relative level of the control lines. These unbalanced ratios of the transcript level and the activity of the CKX enzyme negatively affected kernel germination or anther development and as a consequence setting the seeds. The final phenotypic effect was the decreased productivity of T 0 plants and T 1 lines obtained via the biolistic silencing of HvCKX 2. Conclusion The phenotypic result, which was higher productivity of silenced lines obtained via Agrobacterium, confirms the hypothesis that spatial and temporal differences in expression contributed to functional differentiation. The applicability of Agrobacterium -mediated transformation for gene silencing of developmentally regulated genes, like HvCKX 2, was proven. Otherwise low productivity and disturbances in plant development of biolistic-silenced lines documented the unsuitability of the method. The possible reasons are discussed. </p...|$|E
40|$|Morpho-physiological and {{molecular}} analysis {{were conducted to}} identify useful root indexes of sugar beet nutrient uptake capacity and productivity. Root architectural parameters, root elongation rate, sulfate uptake rate and glucose and fructose content in the root apex, traits involved in the plant response to sulfate stress, were evaluated in 18 sugar beet genotypes characterized by different root yield. Morpho-physiological traits, determined on 11 -day-old seedlings grown in hydroponics under sulfate deprivation, showed variations from 59 to 197 % and were significantly correlated (P< 0. 01) with root yield. Under field conditions, the highest root yield genotype (L 18), which has the highest root phenotypic values following sulfate shortage, also showed the greatest root length density and leaf relative water content, {{with respect to the}} lowest root yield genotype (L 01). Bulk segregant analysis based on AFLP analysis, done on a <b>segregating</b> <b>progeny</b> obtained from the cross between the two lines L 01 9 L 18, allowed the identification of two AFLP markers associated to the root elongation rate parameter that showed the highest variation among all the analyzed root traits. The genetic diversity of root adaptive traits and the use of marker-assisted selection aimed at increasing sugar yield under water and nutrient stress in sugar beet breeding programmes are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{arginine}} methyltransferase family (PRMT) {{has been}} implicated {{in a variety of}} cellular processes, including signal transduction, epigenetic regulation, and DNA repair pathways. PRMT 1 is thought to be responsible for the majority of PRMT activity in Toxoplasma gondii, but its exact function is unknown. To further define the biological function of the PRMT family, we generated T.  gondii mutants lacking PRMT 1 (Δprmt 1) by deletion of the PRMT 1 gene. Δprmt 1 parasites exhibit morphological defects during cell division and grow slowly, and this phenotype reverses in the Δprmt::PRMT 1 mRFP complemented strain. Tagged PRMT 1 localizes primarily in the cytoplasm with enrichment at the pericentriolar material, and the strain lacking PRMT 1 is unable to <b>segregate</b> <b>progeny</b> accurately. Unlike wild-type and complemented parasites, Δprmt 1 parasites have abnormal daughter buds, perturbed centrosome stoichiometry, and loss of synchronous replication. Whole-genome expression profiling demonstrated differences in expression of cell-cycle-regulated genes in the Δprmt 1 strain relative to the complemented Δprmt 1 ::PRMT 1 mRFP and parental wild-type strains, but these changes do not correlate with a specific block in cell cycle. Although PRMT 1 ’s primary biological function was previously proposed to be methylation of histones, our studies suggest that PRMT 1 plays an important role within the centrosome to ensure the proper replication of the parasite...|$|R
40|$|Septoria tritici blotch, {{causal agent}} Mycosphaerella graminicola (Fuckel) J. Schrot. (anamorph: Zymoseptoria tritici Desm.), {{is the major}} foliar disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in Tunisia causing {{frequent}} epidemics on T. turgidum L. var. durum (Desf.) Bowden, and important yield and grain quality losses. To determine the inheritance of resistance to septoria, a cross was made using resistant ('Salim') and susceptible ('Karim') cultivars. Parents, and the 149 derived recombinant lines, were tested for resistance to septoria under field conditions during the 2009 and 2010 crop seasons. The inheritance of resistance to septoria was quantitative where a continuous and normal distribution (W = 0. 93) was shown among <b>segregate</b> <b>progenies.</b> During 2009 and 2010 crop seasons, the mean disease severities of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) ranged from 29. 1 % to 41. 8 %, respectively, and 53 % of RILs were associated with lower disease severity than the mid-parent value. The severity was significantly affected by Genotype x Year interaction (p < 0. 01). Broad sense heritability was 0. 55 suggesting a quantitative inheritance of resistance to M. graminicola. These results would imply that genetic resistance to STB {{could be attributed to}} additive gene effects. Thus, using identified sources of tolerance to STB in a breeding program would enhance the development of cultivars that are adapted to the prevailing isolates in field conditions...|$|R
40|$|Microsatellite {{markers and}} {{morphological}} characteristics {{were used to}} explore the genetic diversity and possible origin of weedy rice in Taizhou City, Jiangsu Province, China. Fifty-two weedy rice (Oryza sativa L.) accessions were compared with two wild rice, four hybrid rice and five cultivars using 22 simple sequence repeat (SSR) primer pairs. A total of 107 fragments were amplified, averaging 5. 6 alleles per primer pair. The polymorphic index content (PIC) values ranged from 0. 3077 to 0. 7951, averaging at 0. 5870. The average genetic distance of all samples ranged from 0. 02 to 0. 46 {{with an average of}} 0. 262. The genetic distance among Taizhou weedy rice ranged from 0. 03 to 0. 44 with an average of 0. 224. Cluster analysis showed that all the weedy rice accessions from Taizhou City were indica, and could be subdivided into different genotypes. The majority (86 %) of weedy rice was most closely related to hybrid rice. The Taizhou weedy rice accessions were morphologically similar, but still could be delineated into indica or japonica group by some morphological traits. It is suggested that the levels of genetic and morphological diversities of weedy rice in Taizhou City are low and these weedy rice plants originated from the <b>segregating</b> <b>progenies</b> of hybrid rice that had naturally introgressed with cultivated rice...|$|R
