5|$|From {{the early}} 20th century {{to at least}} the mid-1980s, {{educational}} policies in Mexico focused on the hispanicization (castellanización) of indigenous communities, teaching only Spanish and discouraging the use of indigenous languages. As a result, today there is no group of Nahuatl speakers having attained general literacy in Nahuatl; while their literacy rate in Spanish also remains {{much lower than the}} national average. Even so, Nahuatl is still spoken by well over a million people, of whom around 10% are monolingual. The <b>survival</b> <b>of</b> Nahuatl as a whole is not imminently endangered, but the <b>survival</b> <b>of</b> certain dialects is, and some dialects have already become extinct within the last few decades of the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to endometrial carcinomas, the uncommon endometrial stromal sarcomas are cancers that {{originate in the}} non-glandular connective tissue of the endometrium. They are generally non-aggressive and, if they recur, can take decades. Metastases to the lungs and pelvic or peritoneal cavities are the most frequent. They typically have estrogen and/or progesterone receptors. The prognosis for low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma is good, with 60–90% five-year survival. High-grade undifferentiated endometrial sarcoma (HGUS) has a worse prognosis, with high rates of recurrence and 25% five-year survival. HGUS prognosis is dictated by {{whether or not the}} cancer has invaded the arteries and veins. Without vascular invasion, the five-year survival is 83%; it drops to 17% when vascular invasion is observed. Stage I ESS has the best prognosis, with five-year <b>survival</b> <b>of</b> 98% and ten-year <b>survival</b> <b>of</b> 89%. ESS makes up 0.2% of uterine cancers.|$|E
5000|$|Don Yoder {{argued that}} there were five {{separate}} ways of defining folk religion. The first was a perspective rooted in a cultural evolutionary framework which understood folk religion as representing the <b>survivals</b> <b>of</b> older forms of religion; in this, it would constitute [...] "the survivals, in an official religious context, of beliefs and behavior inherited from earlier stages of the culture's development". This definition would view folk religion in Catholic Europe as the <b>survivals</b> <b>of</b> pre-Christian religion and the folk religion in Protestant Europe as the <b>survivals</b> <b>of</b> Medieval Catholicism. The second definition identified by Yoder was the view that folk religion represented the mixture of an official religion with forms of ethnic religion; this was employed to explain the place of folk religion in the syncretic belief systems of the Americas, where Christianity had blended with the religions of indigenous American and African communities.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{comparing}} the <b>survival</b> outcomes <b>of</b> two treatments while adjusting for multiple demographic and clinical factors. We wish {{to answer the}} question: "At what times do the <b>survival</b> outcomes <b>of</b> two treatments differ?". Previous work by Zhang and Klein (2001) addressed this issue by considering a stratified Cox model and by constructing the confidence band for the differences between <b>survival</b> functions <b>of</b> treatments, for a given subject. In this study, we utilize direct adjusted <b>survivals</b> <b>of</b> treatments, so that treatment comparison can be performed on a general basis. The confidence band for the differences between direct adjusted survivals was constructed using the simulation method. We developed two SAS macros that compute the band. The first macro was developed for data sets consisting of fixed covariates only. The second macro was developed based on the piecewise proportional hazards Cox model and allows for timedependent variables. We illustrate both macros by analyzing the <b>survival</b> data <b>of</b> a cohort of lymphoma patients...|$|R
