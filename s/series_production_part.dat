40|$|In an EFB / AiF {{supported}} {{project at}} Fraunhofer IWU Chemnitz the process combination of hydroforming and press hardening was successfully {{applied to a}} <b>series</b> <b>production</b> <b>part</b> with multiple bends. The focus of the investigations was on {{the determination of the}} repeatability of the forming process as a function of two process parameters part temperature and forming pressure. The wall thickness, hardness, forming accuracy and mechanical properties of formed components were measured and analysed. The manganese boron steel tubes (26 MnB 5) had a diameter of 55 mm, a wall thickness of 2 mm and a x-tec® coating. During forming, a high large circumferential elongation of up to 60 % combined with a very good dimensional accuracy was achieved...|$|E

This presentation gives an overview of new applications and ongoing research projects in the fields of tool and die making via selective laser melting (e. g. die forging, press hardening), adaptronic components, medical implants (e. g. patient-specific implants or implants with structured surfaces) and design components...|$|R
40|$|Manufacturing {{companies}} {{with a high}} share of value added in assembly have realized that productivity in <b>series</b> <b>production</b> can be considerably increased {{by a number of}} optimization approaches, such as value stream design or simulation techniques. Therefore, the question arises why this huge potential is only tapped into after the start of <b>series</b> <b>production.</b> As <b>part</b> of the research project NäGeMo, a new IT-based pre-series planning approach has been developed which unlocks the value-added potential for optimization even before <b>series</b> <b>production</b> is started...|$|R

30|$|The {{detection}} of defects within the adhesive can be proofed by {{the testing of}} <b>series</b> <b>production</b> <b>parts</b> in the line. These are the most difficult defects for the testing method to detect as the ultrasonic wave penetrates the adhesive depending on {{the ratio of the}} sound resistance and is also attenuated. The reason is that, in contrast to the destructive test, the position of the flaws in area 2 of Fig.  12 in the C image migrates in its height (y-direction), {{can be attributed to the}} position of the seam loop in the UT probe. This can be presupposed as non-uniform due to the robot’s path. The reason that the defects are not separately represented as such is due to the spatial resolution of the UT probe. The transducer length of 8  mm and an aperture consisting of 3 adjacent elements excites an area of 8  mm ×  1.15  mm, neglecting the divergence angle. The following evaluation is integrated over this area, resulting in a superimposition of adjacent meander structures. The consequence is that due to the 8  mm long extension of the transducers in the z-direction (see Fig.  1 on the right) several defects are ultrasonically superimposed. Therefore, these flaws cannot be displayed separately in the C image.|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} {{potential of}} micro-system-oriented products clarifies seriously {{the need of}} highest precision and micro technologies. The economic implementation of these technologies requires to consider the entire process chain. At the Fraunhofer IWU the entire way of the component development is therefore examined beginning from the concept over prototype and tool manufacturing, surface modification, replication up to the metrological evaluation, {{with the objective of}} mass production by replication processes. Thus our customers are supported not only during basic studies and component development, but accompanied during plant engineering and process development up to the <b>series</b> <b>production</b> of the <b>parts...</b>|$|R
40|$|Metal Injection Moulding (MIM) {{is known}} as a viable process for <b>series</b> <b>production</b> of complex <b>parts</b> for {{biomedical}} applications. In this study, biodegradable iron based materials (Fe, Fe- 0. 6 P, Fe- 35 Mn, Fe-ß-TCP) were prepared, processed by MIM and characterized towards biocompatibility, mechanical and degradation properties. Samples were sintered under different conditions to create a range of densities and microstructures. Cytotoxicity was tested according to ISO 10993 - 5. Using appropriate process parameters all materials proved non cytotoxic. Mechanical properties showed significant dependency on sintering conditions. The values recorded indicate potential usability of the materials for a range of orthopaedic implants. Corrosion behavior in vitro shows a strong dependency of the degradation rates on the medium used, and results of mechanical tests suggest significant degradation of mechanical properties. Despite the obvious need for further investigations, iron based a lloys and composites processed by PIM may be considered for future biodegradable implants in load bearing implant applications...|$|R
