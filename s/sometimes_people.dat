5|$|According to Procopius, the Slavs {{believed}} in one god, {{the creator of}} lightning and master of the entire universe, to whom all sacrificial animals (and <b>sometimes</b> <b>people)</b> were offered. The highest god was called Svarog throughout the Slavic area, but other gods were also worshiped in different regions at different times, often with local names. Natural objects such as rivers, groves or mountains were also celebrated, as well as nymphs, demons, ancestral and other spirits, who were all venerated and bought off with offering rituals, which also involved augury. Such beliefs and practices were later developed and individualized by the many Slavic tribes.|$|E
5|$|Doctors {{initially}} told Kennedy {{the tumor}} was inoperable, but he looked around for other opinions and decided on the most aggressive and exhausting course of treatment possible. On June 2, 2008, Kennedy underwent brain surgery at Duke University Medical Center {{in an attempt to}} remove as much of the tumor as possible. The 3½-hour operation, conducted by Dr. Allan Friedman while Kennedy was conscious to minimize any permanent neurological effects, was deemed successful in its goals. Kennedy left the hospital a week later to begin a course of chemotherapy and radiation treatment. Opinions varied regarding Kennedy's prognosis: the surgery typically only extended survival time by a matter of months, but <b>sometimes</b> <b>people</b> lived for years.|$|E
5|$|Reactions to {{the ants}} sting show similar {{symptoms}} to fire ant stings; namely local swelling which lasts for several days, and {{swelling of the}} lips, face and eyes may occur from a minor allergic reaction. Other common symptoms include watering of the eyes and nose, and hives or welts will begin to develop. Headaches, anxiety and flushing may also occur. Jack jumpers, bees and wasps {{are the most common}} causes of anaphylaxis from insect stings. People most commonly feel a sharp pain after these stings, similar to that from an electric shock. Some patients develop a systemic skin reaction after being stung. Localised envenomation occurs with every sting, but severe envenoming only occurs if someone has been stung many times (as many as 50 to 300 stings in adults). The heart rate increases, and blood pressure falls rapidly. Most people will only experience mild skin irritation after being stung. Those who suffer from a severe allergic reaction will show a wide variety of symptoms. This includes difficulty breathing and talking, the tongue and throat will swell up, and coughing, chest tightness, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting may occur. Others may lose consciousness and collapse (<b>sometimes</b> <b>people</b> may not collapse), and confusion. Children who get stung will show symptoms such as floppiness and paleness if a severe allergic reaction occurs.|$|E

25|$|Hairy tongue largely {{occurs in}} {{the central part of}} the dorsal tongue, just {{anterior}} (in front) of the circumvallate papillae, although sometimes the entire dorsal surface may be involved. Discoloration usually accompanies hairy tongue, and may be yellow, brown or black. Apart from the appearance, the condition is typically asymptomatic, but <b>sometimes</b> <b>people</b> may experience a gagging sensation or a bad taste. There may also be associated oral malodor (intra-oral halitosis).|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{are unable}} to predict who with {{heartburn}} will develop Barrett's esophagus. While no relationship exists between the severity of heartburn {{and the development of}} Barrett's esophagus, a relationship does exist between chronic heartburn and the development of Barrett's esophagus. <b>Sometimes,</b> <b>people</b> with Barrett's esophagus have no heartburn symptoms at all. In rare cases, damage to the esophagus may be caused by swallowing a corrosive substance such as lye.|$|E

25|$|Treatment of {{anorexia}} involves restoring {{a healthy}} weight, treating the underlying psychological problems, and addressing behaviors that promote the problem. While medications do not help with weight gain, {{they may be}} used to help with associated anxiety or depression. A number of types of therapy may be useful including an approach where parents assume responsibility for feeding their child, known as Maudsley family therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>people</b> require admission to hospital to restore weight. Evidence for benefit from nasogastric tube feeding, however, is unclear. Some people will just have a single episode and recover while others may have many episodes over years. Many complications improve or resolve with regaining of weight.|$|E
25|$|In Romania and Moldova, Epiphany, {{is called}} Boboteaza. In {{south-eastern}} Romania, following religious services, men participate in winter horse races. Before the race, the men {{line up with}} their horses before the priest, who will bless them by sprinkling them with green branches that have been dipped into Epiphany holy water. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>people</b> desire to have this blessing for themselves as well. Winning the Epiphany race is a great honor for both horse and rider, while the post-race celebrations, win or not, are highly festive. As in other Orthodox heritage countries, water rites play a special role on this day. A unique piece of Romanian folk wisdom holds that if a girl slips on ice – or better yet falls into water- on Epiphany, she will surely marry before the year is out.|$|E
25|$|Another {{theme is}} {{confidentiality}} {{and this is}} an important principle in many nursing ethical codes. This is where information about the person is only shared with others after permission of the person, unless it is felt that the information must be shared to comply with a higher duty such as preserving life. Related to information giving is the debate relating to truth telling in interactions with the person in care. There is a balance between people having the information required to make an autonomous decision and, on the other hand, not being unnecessarily distressed by the truth. Generally the balance is in favour of truth telling due to respect for autonomy, but <b>sometimes</b> <b>people</b> will ask not to be told, or may lack the capacity to understand the implications. Finally, the role of empirical ethics has become prominent in recent years.|$|E

25|$|At {{the peak}} of the terror, the {{slightest}} hint of counter-revolutionary thoughts or activities (or, {{as in the case of}} Jacques Hébert, revolutionary zeal exceeding that of those in power) could place one under suspicion, and trials did not always proceed according to contemporary standards of due process. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>people</b> died for their political opinions or actions, but many for little reason beyond mere suspicion, or because some others had a stake in getting rid of them. Most of the victims received an unceremonious trip to the guillotine in an open wooden cart (the tumbrel). In the rebellious provinces, the government representatives had unlimited authority and some engaged in extreme repressions and abuses. For example, Jean-Baptiste Carrier became notorious for the Noyades ("drownings") he organised in Nantes; his conduct was judged unacceptable even by the Jacobin government and he was recalled.|$|E
25|$|A 2011 {{survey of}} the largest cities in the United States by walkscore.com {{determined}} the city of Miami to be ranked eighth in terms of walkability, with an overall walkscore of 73, though Miami provides a case study for the well-known fallibility of WalkScore for not accounting for safety and other factors. The ranking is based on proximity of restaurants, food, transit stops, and entertainment, among other things. Despite this, Miami, along with many younger, auto-dependent southern and western (Sunbelt) cities, is consistently ranked {{as one of the}} most dangerous cities in the US for pedestrians due to rude drivers, very wide roads, and the number of hit and runs; Miami-Dade County was found to have the highest number of pedestrian strikes in a 2013 study. Often several cars will hit a pedestrian and drive away. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>people</b> are even killed while waiting in bus stops when cars run off the road and destroy them. In 2002, pedestrians in Tampa-Orlando and Miami-Fort Lauderdale were found to be three times more likely to die than pedestrians in Cincinnati, Cleveland, and Columbus, Ohio. In 2011, all four of the most dangerous metropolitan areas or pedestrians in the United States were in Florida, with Miami-Fort Lauderdale coming in fourth, having a Pedestrian Danger Index five times greater than the New York City metropolitan area based on 2008–2012 data. Additionally, many motorists are acquitted or receive minor punishments for crimes such as DUI vehicular manslaughter and other reckless driving incidents.|$|E

500|$|Unable {{to address}} the cult image directly, laymen still {{attempted}} to convey their prayers to it. At times they related messages to priests to deliver to the temple deity; at other times they expressed their piety in {{the parts of the}} temple that they could access. Courts, doorways, and hypostyle halls might have spaces designated for public prayer. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>people</b> directed their appeals to the royal colossi, which were believed to act as divine intermediaries. More private areas for devotion were located at the building's outer wall, where large niches served as [...] "chapels of the hearing ear" [...] for individuals to speak to the god.|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} {{to whether the}} change to a bigger record label would influence his creative control, Smith said, [...] "I think {{despite the fact that}} <b>sometimes</b> <b>people</b> look at major labels as simply money-making machines, they're actually composed of individuals who are real people, and there's a part of them that needs to feel that part of their job is to put out good music."

500|$|Sometimes the {{symptoms}} {{reported in the}} history are misleading and point the examiner to the wrong area of the mouth. For instance, <b>sometimes</b> <b>people</b> may mistake pain from pulpitis in a lower tooth as pain in the upper teeth, and vice versa. In other instances, the apparent examination findings may be misleading and lead to the wrong diagnosis and wrong treatment. Pus from a pericoronal abscess associated with a lower third molar may drain along the submucosal plane and discharge as a parulis over {{the roots of the}} teeth towards the front of the mouth (a [...] "migratory abscess"). Another example is decay of the tooth root which is hidden from view below the gumline, giving the casual appearance of a sound tooth if careful periodontal examination is not carried out.|$|E
