In this paper, the author details {{the results of a}} pedagogical program whereby students at a New York City community college used industry-standard software to design, conduct, and analyze <b>sociological</b> <b>surveys</b> of one another, with the aim of inspiring student interest in quantitative methods and enhancing technical literacy. A chi-square test of independence was performed to determine the effect of the pedagogical process on the students’ ability to discuss sociological methods unrelated to their surveys in their final papers, compared with the author’s students from the previous semester who did not undergo the pedagogical program. The relation between these variables was significant, χ 2 (3, N= 36) = 9. 8, p =. 02. Findings suggest that community college students, under lecturer supervision, with minimal prior statistical knowledge, and access to digital media can collaborate in small groups to create and conduct <b>sociological</b> <b>surveys,</b> and discuss methods and results in limited classroom time. College sociology lecturers, instead of combatting student desire to use digital media, should harness this desire to advance student mastery of quantitative methods...|$|R
