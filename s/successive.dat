5|$|New {{home and}} away kits were {{introduced}} for the second <b>successive</b> summer, the home kit featuring red shirts with a white 'V' shape decoration {{toward the top of}} the shirt, light blue shorts with white trims on each side and white socks. The away kit included light blue shirts with the same 'V' shape decoration, white shorts with light blue trims on each side and light blue socks. Pryers Solicitors continued as shirt sponsors for the third <b>successive</b> season.|$|E

Benenden Health continued as shirt sponsors for the fourth <b>successive</b> season.|$|E
5|$|Only two {{or three}} frets are needed for the guitarchords—major, minor, and {{dominant}} sevenths—which are emphasized in introductions to guitar-playing and to the fundamentals of music. Each major and minor chord can be played on two <b>successive</b> frets on three <b>successive</b> strings, and therefore each needs only two fingers. Other chords—seconds, fourths, sevenths, and ninths—are played on only three <b>successive</b> frets. For fundamental-chord fingerings, major-thirds tuning's simplicity and consistency are not shared by standard tuning, whose seventh-chord fingering is discussed {{at the end of}} this section.|$|E

5|$|A {{variety of}} calls have been recorded, {{described}} as 'tinkle' and 'blurt' songs. These are similar across mainland Australia but distinct on Rottnest Island; on the isolated island, birds rarely linked <b>successive</b> songs.|$|E
5|$|According to Pauling's first rule, <b>successive</b> pK {{values of}} a given acid {{increase}} (pKa2 > pKa1). For oxyacids {{with more than one}} ionizable hydrogen on the same atom, the pKa values often increase by about 5 units for each proton removed, as in the example of phosphoric acid above.|$|E
5|$|Adolfo Rodríguez Saá (born July 25, 1947) is an Argentine Peronist politician. Born in {{a family}} that was highly {{influential}} {{in the history of}} the San Luis Province, he became governor in 1983, after the end of the National Reorganization Process military dictatorship. He remained governor up to 2001, being re-elected in <b>successive</b> elections.|$|E

5|$|After the Second World War, no one {{dominated}} the Tour until Louison Bobet, who won three consecutive Tours from 1953 to 1955—he {{was the first}} person to achieve this feat. This was bettered by the French cyclist Jacques Anquetil, who won four <b>successive</b> Tours from 1961 to 1964. Anquetil, who also won in 1957, became the first to win five Tours. Anquetil's five victories were matched when Belgian cyclist Eddy Merckx won four <b>successive</b> Tours from 1969 to 1972 and the 1974 Tour. Merckx is the only person to have won the general, points and king of the mountains classifications in the same Tour. He achieved this in 1969, when he won his first Tour.|$|E

5|$|Armies {{of workers}} would gather a long, durable grass known as shicra in the {{highlands}} above the city, tie the grass strands into loosely meshed bags, fill the bags with boulders, and then pack the trenches behind each <b>successive</b> retaining wall of the step pyramids with the stone-filled bags.|$|E
5|$|As the Chief Minister, Mayawati {{gained a}} {{reputation}} for efficient governance and promoting law and order, winning praise even from opposition parties and other rivals. In 2007, MLA Umakant Yadav of her own political party accused in a land grabbing case, was arrested near her dwelling on her orders. During September–October 2010, {{at the time of}} the Ayodhya verdict, her government maintained law and order and the state remain peaceful. Several high-profile criminals and mafia dons were jailed during her terms in office. She called for strong anti-rape laws. Fewer riots, lowest rapes, and least corruption occurred during her tenure as compared to previous or <b>successive</b> governments. In the 2007-2012 assembly, only 124 MLAs were crorepatis as compared to 271 crorepatis in <b>successive</b> assembly elected in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Australia fell to <b>successive</b> defeats in {{the opening}} two Tests, Bradman making two ducks in his four innings, {{and it seemed that}} the {{captaincy}} was affecting his form. The selectors made another four changes to the team for the Third Test at Melbourne.|$|E
5|$|Belgian Eddy Merckx was the {{dominant}} figure during the 1970s. His first victory came in 1968; another triumph in 1970 {{was followed by}} three <b>successive</b> victories from 1972 to 1974, which is {{the record for the}} most <b>successive</b> victories in the Giro. Felice Gimondi was victorious in 1976 winning his third Giro. Belgians Michel Pollentier and Johan De Muynck won the two subsequent Giros in 1977 and 1978. In 1980, Frenchman Bernard Hinault who up to this point had won two Tours de France, became France's first winner since Anquetil in 1964. He would win another two Giros in 1982 and 1985.|$|E

5|$|Drilling at low speed: The {{pilot hole}} is {{expanded}} by using progressively wider drills (typically {{between three and}} seven <b>successive</b> drilling steps, depending on implant width and length). Care is taken not to damage the osteoblast or bone cells by overheating. A cooling saline or water spray keeps the temperature low.|$|E
5|$|During September and October of the 1999–2000 season, Boulding {{scored in}} four <b>successive</b> league games. However, {{he could only}} score another two goals {{during the rest of}} the {{campaign}} to once again record a tally of six goals. His last goal came only two minutes after he had come on as a substitute during Mansfield's penultimate game of the season against Scunthorpe United, which helped the team to their fourth <b>successive</b> home victory and a final league position of 13th. Boulding's two-year contract with Mansfield had finished and he left after playing 74appearances in all competitions for Mansfield, of which 41 were as a substitute. During his two seasons he scored 12goals, all in the league.|$|E
5|$|During the Investiture Controversy, {{both the}} {{legitimate}} Popes {{as well as}} Antipope Clement III developed another, not entirely new, practice. They appointed their cardinals to the important Episcopal sees in Italy in order to assure their government by their own trusted collaborators. Antipope Clement III named cardinals Hugo Candidus and Roberto of S. Marco bishops of Fermo and Faenza respectively. Popes Victor III and Urban II appointed their cardinals to the episcopal sees of Brescia (Herimanus) and Reggio-Emilia (Bonussenior). The practice was continued by <b>successive</b> popes, who named their cardinals particularly to the recently reestablished Latin archiepiscopal sees in southern Italy (Siponto, Brindisi, Salerno, Benevento). Also, three <b>successive</b> archbishops of Pisa: Uberto Rossi Lanfranchi (1133–1137/38), Balduino (1138–1145) and Villano Caetani (1146–1175) were initially the cardinals.|$|E

5|$|Following World War II, in {{response}} to the growth of Nigerian nationalism and demands for independence, <b>successive</b> constitutions legislated by the British government moved Nigeria toward self-government on a representative and increasingly federal basis. By the middle of the 20th century, a great wave for independence was sweeping across Africa. Nigeria achieved independence in 1960.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2016–17 season, and {{suffering}} his second <b>successive</b> year in struggling offensively with the Devils, Cammalleri {{was placed on}} waivers in order to buy-out the remaining two years and $10 million left on his contract on June 30, 2017.|$|E
5|$|Heavy metals {{up to the}} {{vicinity}} of iron (in the periodic table) are largely made via stellar nucleosynthesis. In this process, lighter elements from hydrogen to silicon undergo <b>successive</b> fusion reactions inside stars, releasing light and heat and forming heavier elements with higher atomic numbers.|$|E
5|$|If the Parliament Act 1949 {{were found}} {{not to be}} an Act of Parliament {{on any of the}} above grounds, all {{legislation}} passed using the Parliament Acts since the introduction of the 1949 Act, including the Hunting Act, would also not be valid Acts of Parliament, being passed only in accordance with the 1949 Act (rejection in two <b>successive</b> sessions and a delay of one year) as opposed to the more onerous requirements of the 1911 Act (rejection in three <b>successive</b> sessions and a delay of two years).|$|E
5|$|In {{developmental}} biology, organs {{that developed}} in the embryo {{in the same manner}} and from similar origins, such as from matching primordia in <b>successive</b> segments of the same animal, are serially homologous. Examples include the legs of a centipede, the maxillary palp and labial palp of an insect, and the spinous processes of <b>successive</b> vertebrae in a vertebral column. Male and female reproductive organs are homologous if they develop from the same embryonic tissue, as do the ovaries and testicles of mammals including humans.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} reach the final, Alloa played all four matches in the {{preceding}} rounds away from home, keeping only one clean sheet and recording three <b>successive</b> 2–1 away wins.
