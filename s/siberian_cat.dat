50|$|Cat breeds {{such as the}} LaPerm, Sphynx, Devon Rex and Cornish Rex, which lack {{some or all of}} {{the normal}} layers in cats' fur, are {{believed}} by mild allergy sufferers to be significantly less likely to provoke an allergic reaction than other breeds. <b>Siberian</b> <b>cats</b> and Russian Blue are also believed by some to have such properties.|$|R
50|$|A hypoallergenic cat is a {{cat that}} {{is less likely to}} provoke, or produce an {{allergic}} reaction in humans. Although the topic is controversial, owners' experience and recent clinical studies suggest that <b>Siberian</b> <b>cats,</b> Devon Rex and Cornish Rex cats, Abyssinian cats, Balinese cats, and several other breeds, especially females, are likely to have low levels of Fel d 1, the main allergenic protein.|$|R
50|$|<b>Siberian</b> <b>cats</b> are {{excellent}} parents, with the fathers helping {{to care for}} kittens if they are allowed access to the nest. Parents are often strongly bonded and some mothers will only mate with one male. Atypical for <b>cats,</b> juvenile male <b>Siberians</b> have been seen cuddling and grooming their cousins and siblings. Siberians, due to their communal nature, often do better in pairs in captivity.|$|R

40|$|Many feline breeds {{have been}} {{generated}} {{from a small}} number of ancestors. Thus, breed-specific peculiarities can be expected, which could include haematological and biochemical measurements. Despite this, {{there are only a few}} reports on breed-specific reference intervals (RI). This information is essential in routine practice where results from individual patients are usually compared with an RI. The aim was to compare haematological and biochemical data from clinically healthy Abyssinian, Holy Birman, Norwegian Forest and <b>Siberian</b> <b>cats</b> with published RIs to assess whether the published RIs are acceptable in these breeds. Comparison with established RIs using guidelines from the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards and the American Society of Veterinary Clinical Pathology, revealed a number of breed-related clinicopathological differences. New RIs were established, but in most cases the new RIs overlapped with published RIs, and the use of the breed-specific data would minimally affect the clinical interpretation of laboratory results. Important differences that could result in misinterpretation of laboratory results were as follows: microcytosis and high α 2 -globulin concentrations in Abyssinian cats; high serum creatinine, α 2 -globulin and glucose concentrations in Holy Birman cats; high serum alkaline phosphatase activity and calcium and phosphate concentration in Norwegian Forest cats; low β 2 -globulin and γ-globulin concentrations in Norwegian Forest and <b>Siberian</b> <b>cats.</b> Breed-specific RIs should be used for these analytes. In addition, care should be taken in interpreting clinicopathological data in purebred cats for which specific RIs have not been established...|$|R

50|$|Anecdotally, Balinese are {{claimed to}} cause many fewer {{problems}} with allergies than most breeds. While strict scientific {{evidence for this}} is lacking, it has been determined that, in comparison to most cats, the Balinese produces very low amounts of the Fel d1 and Fel d4 protein allergens. As with the <b>Siberian</b> <b>cat</b> breed, some Balinese breeders and clubs are working together to produce more rigorously tested evidence of the Balinese's hypoallergenic quality.|$|E
50|$|<b>Siberian</b> <b>cats</b> tend to {{come into}} {{reproductive}} readiness earlier than other breeds, sometimes as young as five months. It is thought that this {{is related to the}} breed's closeness to its natural wild state; feral cats often die young due to harsher natural conditions. Achieving reproductive ability early and having large litters provides a biological balance to this. On average, a Siberian litter consists of five to six kittens, as compared to the average litter of three to four kittens in breeds who have been registered as pedigreed <b>cats.</b> However, <b>Siberian</b> litters may consist of as few as one and as many as nine kittens.|$|R

The cat is an ancient breed that is now believed to be ancestral to all modern long-haired cats. [...] The cat has similarities with the Norwegian Forest Cat, to which it is likely closely related. [...] It is a natural breed of Siberia and the national cat of Russia. While it began as a landrace, it is selectively bred and pedigreed today in at least seven major cat fancier and breeder organisations. The colorpoint variant of the breed is called the Neva Masquerade by some registries, including Fédération Internationale Féline (FIFé).|$|E
5000|$|In Australia, The Russian White program {{started on}} the 4 May 1971 by Dick and Mavis Jones of Myemgay Cattery. Below is an excerpt from an article by Mavis Jones."Our project began in earnest when we {{acquired}} a genuine white <b>Siberian</b> <b>cat,</b> albeit a [...] "domestic", as she possessed no pedigree. She was the family pet of {{an official at the}} Thai Embassy, who brought her to Australia with him. We exchanged a Russian Blue for this beautiful white cat, and mated her to one of our Russian Blue studs. She produced two white kittens in her litter, the best of which we kept, and named White Rose, then applied for permission to breed White Russians. To our knowledge, the white cat fromRussia or Siberia, is the only cat suitable to cross with a Russian Blue. White Rose grew to be a beautiful white queen, long, svelte, elegant, with all the appearances, and the charming characteristics of the Russian Blues. Eventually we mated Rose back to her sire, Myemgay Yuri, who had already established quite a reputation for himself, as best shorthair stud cat for two successive years. Our two first generation White Russian kittens were registered in November 1971. They were exquisite and we were delighted.Sadly Rose developed milk fever when her babies were three weeks old, and we lost her. We raised the two wee girls with a dolls bottle and carnation milk, until they were old enough to digest solid food.It would take far too long to enumerate all the difficulties and incidents that [...] "happen" [...] in a programme such as ours. Suffice to say they were many and varied, but we accepted them as they came, and managed to overcome most. Of course there were some heartaches, but we accepted those too.We mated our two first generation whites to two different Myemgay Blue Studs to produce our second generation whites and then two of the best whites (one from each litter) to produce our third generation kitten. We continued this procedure until we reached fourth generation and applied for full registration and recognition of our whites. They were granted full registration, eligible to compete for Championship status in July 1975." ...|$|E
40|$|Cats {{are usually}} {{spreaders}} of allergens {{that are critical}} for sensitive people; the <b>Siberian</b> <b>cat</b> is a breed supposed to be low level allergenic, according to some breeders’ statements. The sequence of the two genes, namely Ch 1 and Ch 2, that code for the allergen Fel d 1, the major allergen responsible for outbreaks of allergy symptoms, is not yet known in the <b>Siberian</b> <b>cat,</b> and finding this was the aim of our investigation. Notably, our work is the first survey of the genetic structure of these genes in Siberian cats. The comparison of the sequences of Siberian cats, non-Siberian cats, and sequences present in the National Center for Biotechnology Information database revealed {{a considerable number of}} mutations; some of those detected in the <b>Siberian</b> <b>cat,</b> due to their position in exon regions, could affect the Fel d 1 allergenic properties. Therefore, further investigations are recommended to assess if the identified mutations can be responsible for a reduced-allergen synthesis and can be used as markers for selection of low level allergenic cats...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} possible differences in felinine excretion between domesticated cat breeds. For this purpose, urine was collected from a total of 83 privately owned entire male cats from eight different breeds in the Netherlands during the period of November 2010 till November 2011. In the collected samples, free felinine and creatinine concentrations were measured. Free felinine concentrations were expressed relative to the urinary creatinine concentration to compensate for possible variations in renal output. The mean (±SD) felinine:creatinine (Fel:Cr) ratio as measured over all cats was 0. 702 (± 0. 265). Both the Abyssinian and Sphynx breeds showed the highest Fel:Cr ratio (0. 878 ± 0. 162 and 0. 878 ± 0. 341 respectively) which significantly differed from the ratios of the British Shorthairs (0. 584 ± 0. 220), Birmans (0. 614 ± 0. 266), Norwegian Forest cats (0. 566 ± 0. 296) and <b>Siberian</b> <b>cats</b> (0. 627 ± 0. 124). The Fel:Cr ratios of the Persians (0. 792 ± 0. 284) and Ragdolls (0. 673 ± 0. 256) showed no statistical difference with either of the other breeds. A significant proportion of the observed variation between the different feline breeds could be explained by hair growth, as both hair growth and felinine production compete for available cysteine. Shorthaired and hairless cat breeds generally showed a higher Fel:Cr ratio compared to longhaired cat breeds, with the exception of Persian cats. Further research is warranted to more closely study the effect of hair growth on felinine production...|$|R
40|$|Because size reduced, or bottlenecked, {{populations are}} more prone to adverse events, the {{detection}} of genetic bottleneck signatures in wildlife species is highly relevant for conservation. Here we applied 11 microsatellite markers to the endangered Siberian tiger (Panthera tigris altaica) using tissue and blood samples of animals from the Primorsky region of the Russian Far East. Excess heterozygosity and mode shift in allele frequencies tests were positive, while the M-ratio test was negative, indicating the like- lihood of a contemporary rather than a historical population bottleneck. The recent genetic population bottleneck could be attributed to the well-documented demographic collapse of the Siberian tiger pop- ulation in the 1940 s, when population size hit bottom with 20 – 30 surviving animals. The mean effective population size Ne was 14 Siberian tigers (CI 95 : 12 – 25 animals), and the effective population size/census size ratio (Ne /N ratio) was 0. 028. This is the ﬁrst molecular evidence of a recent Siberian tiger population bottleneck, which is of great interest for further conservation and management plans of the highly endan- gered largest felid species, while the worryingly low effective population size challenges the optimism for the recovery of the huge <b>Siberian</b> <b>cat.</b> Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPyometra is a {{clinically}} relevant {{problem in}} intact female cats and dogs. The etiology {{is similar in}} both animal species, with the disease caused by bacterial infection of a progesterone-sensitized uterus. Here, we studied pyometra in cats with the aim to describe the incidence and probability of developing pyometra based on age and breed. The data used were reimbursed claims for veterinary care insurance or life insurance claims or both in cats insured in a Swedish insurance database from 1999 to 2006. The mean incidence rate (IR) for pyometra was about 17 cats per 10, 000 cat years at risk (CYAR). Cats with pyometra were diagnosed at a median age of 4  years and a significant breed effect was observed. The breed with the highest IR (433 cats per 10, 000 CYAR) was the Sphynx, and other breeds with IR over 60 cats per 10, 000 CYAR were <b>Siberian</b> <b>cat,</b> Ocicat, Korat, Siamese, Ragdoll, Maine coon, and Bengal. Pyometra was more commonly diagnosed with increasing age, with a marked increase in cats older than 7  years. The mean case fatality rate in all cats was 5. 7 %, which is slightly higher than corresponding reports in dogs of 3 % to 4 %. Geographical location (urban or rural) {{did not affect the}} risk of developing the disease. The present study provides information of incidence and probability of developing pyometra based on age, breed, and urban or rural geographical location.
