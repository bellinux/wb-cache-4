5|$|The Barra estates of MacNeil (including all the Barra Isles) {{were sold}} to Colonel John Gordon of Cluny Aberdeenshire in 1840 whose lack of {{consideration}} for his tenants during the potato famines was matched by his zeal for evictions to create sheep farms. However, the Highland Clearances <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> effect of increasing Mingulay’s population as families evicted from Barra sometimes chose to re-settle there rather than take the emigrant ships to Nova Scotia. In this regard Mingulay's remoteness was probably an advantage and rents were actually reduced from 1840–45. In 1878 Lady Gordon Cathcart inherited the estate and visited but once during her fifty-four year period of tenure.|$|E
5|$|Orme and La Fleche {{met again}} in the Gordon Stakes at Goodwood with two other opponents, Watercress and Royal Harry. Starting favourite, Orme had La Fleche in trouble {{with more than a}} quarter of a mile still to run. He <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> race won, but then veered left forcing Morny Cannon to pull him back and {{allowing}} La Fleche to draw level. However Orme pulled away again and won by a neck, with Watercress a further six lengths back in third. Orme's final race came in the Limekiln Stakes where he had to carry 10 stone. He finished second to Childwick, who was receiving 33 pounds. During the autumn Orme's legs had started to give him trouble and during the Limekiln a suspensory ligament gave way. This injury brought an end to his racing career, and he was retired to stud. Throughout his racing career he won a total of £32,528 in prize money.|$|E
5|$|Washington {{went into}} {{quarters}} at Morristown {{during the winter}} of 1779–1780, which represented the worst suffering for the army during the war. The temperatures fell to 16 below zero, the New York Harbor was frozen over, and snow and ice covered the ground for weeks, with the troops again lacking provisions for a time as at Valley Forge. In late 1779, Clinton moved his forces south to Charleston for an offensive against the patriots led by Benjamin Lincoln. After his success there, Clinton returned victorious to New York, leaving Cornwallis in the south. Congress replaced Lincoln with Gates, despite Washington's recommendation of Greene. Gates failed in South Carolina and was then replaced by Greene. The British at the time <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> South almost in their grasp. Despite this news, Washington was encouraged to learn in mid-1780 that Lafayette had returned from France with additional naval assets and forces.|$|E

5|$|He used a {{somewhat}} negative advertising campaign that <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> intended initial effect of boosting him to serious contention. His 1988 campaign {{was based on}} the platform of supply-side economics and inner-city enterprise zones. In Bare Knuckles and Back Rooms: My Life in American Politics, campaign chairman Rollins described Kemp as a candidate with foibles. Kemp's campaign managers say he was unmanageable: he ignored timers on his speeches, refused to call contributors, and refused to practice for debates. A humbling Super Tuesday, in which his 39delegate total was fewer than eventual nominee and President Bush and both Dole and Pat Robertson, ended his campaign. After withdrawing from the race, he was still considered a contender for the Vice President nomination. In 1989, the Kemps switched their official residence from Hamburg, New York to Bethesda, Maryland, their residence {{at the time of his}} death. In 1994, Kemp's 1988 campaign reached a settlement with the Federal Election Commission by agreeing to pay $120,000 in civil penalties for 1988 campaign election law violations for, among other things, excessive contributions, improper direct corporate donations, press overbilling, exceeding spending limits in Iowa and New Hampshire, and failure to reimburse corporations for providing air transportation.|$|E
5|$|On the January 2 {{episode of}} Raw, the Ladies in Pink turned their {{attention}} to backstage announcer Maria Kanellis, blaming her for Victoria's loss in a match. Victoria announced to Maria that they had a match scheduled that night and proceeded to attack her before the bell. Although Victoria <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> advantage in the match, which included interference from Wilson and Chloe, Victoria was pinned after she attempted an offensive maneuver but missed and ran into the turnbuckle, allowing Maria to pin her. After the match, Candice Michelle, Wilson, and Victoria attacked Maria until Ashley Massaro ran down to the ring to assist Maria. The conflict between the Divas caused the Chairman, Vince McMahon, to make a Bra and Panties Gauntlet match at New Year's Revolution, which Massaro won when she eliminated Victoria by removing her shorts. The next night on Raw, the Ladies in Pink announced that they had changed the name of their alliance to Vince's Devils. The storyline rivalry with Massaro continued on the January 23 episode of Raw, when Victoria and Candice Michelle were defeated by Trish Stratus and Massaro in a tag team match. At the Royal Rumble on January 30, the three women were shown in backstage segments flirting with McMahon.|$|E

30|$|It can be {{seen that}} the four {{analyses}} just outlined differ a lot. Nevertheless, the non-uniqueness theory considers all of them to be legitimate, because each <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> its own advantage.

25|$|These results {{caught the}} eye of Count Domenico Agusta who signed Agostini to ride for his MV Agusta squad as Mike Hailwood's teammate. Agostini then fought a season-long battle with Honda's Jim Redman for the 1965 350cc world championship. He <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> title won when he led the final round in Japan at Suzuka when his bike failed him, handing the title to Redman.|$|E

Button closed the gap to under two seconds before he too appeared to develop brake problems. Fortunately for Button, his attempts to catch Vettel had given him a ten-second cushion over Barrichello with two laps to go.|$|E
25|$|After some {{search for}} the girl, I interviewed a nightclub dancer who had just scored in a small {{emotional}} part in a play that did not run (The Noose). She <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> quality I wanted, a sort of rough poignancy. She at once displayed more sensitive, easily expressed emotion than I had encountered since Pauline Lord. She and (Hal) Skelly were the perfect team, and they made the play a great success. I had great plans for her, but the Hollywood offers kept coming. There was no competing with them. She became a picture star. She is Barbara Stanwyck.|$|E

25|$|In {{his third}} race, the Brazilian Grand Prix, he {{qualified}} in fourth place. He {{got up to}} second on the first lap {{and there was a}} safety car due to an incident in the first corner. On the restart, which was on the third lap, Montoya passed World Champion Michael Schumacher into the first corner. He held off Schumacher, who was on a two-stop strategy compared to Montoya's one stop strategy until Schumacher's first stop. Montoya now <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> race in his pocket as he had a five-second advantage over eventual winner David Coulthard. However, while he was lapping Jos Verstappen, the Dutchman accidentally rammed into the back of him, taking Montoya out.|$|E
25|$|The Blues {{climbed the}} ladder quickly, making the finals in 1903-04-05 without winning the flag. Worrall's old club Fitzroy were the {{benchmark}} {{of the competition}} at this point, and eliminated Carlton from the finals in the latter two years. Worrall continually turned over players {{in an effort to}} find the right combination for success. Eventually, he developed a big, strong team that favoured long kicking and liked to close up the game, forming packs and using their physical strength in the crushes. Fitness was a priority for Worrall: he ensured that his team trained harder than the opposition. Finally, in 1906, Carlton defeated their nemesis Fitzroy in the Grand Final by a record margin with a young team that <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> footballing world at its feet.|$|E
25|$|Merritt's 2008 {{season was}} {{distinguished}} by a considerable rivalry with Wariner, {{who had won}} the 400 m at every major global championship since 2004. The 2008 IAAF Golden League provided the venue for many of their duels. He scored his first major win over Wariner in a close affair at the Internationales Stadionfest in Berlin. He confirmed his Olympic place a month later by winning at the 2008 United States Olympic Trials, again defeating the reigning Olympic champion Wariner. Later in July at the Golden Gala meeting, Wariner responded by edging a win in the 400 m by just 0.01 seconds. At the Meeting Gaz de France in Paris, the last Golden League competition before the Olympics, Wariner <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> momentum behind him after a win in 43.86 seconds.|$|E

25|$|England {{started the}} way they had {{finished}} on day 1 – with fast wickets for few runs. Strauss was eventually bowled out on his second ball of the day for his previous day's total of 161. After that, two quick wickets meant that England were on 378 with only one wicket left. Onions and Anderson started slowly but gathered confidence with a partnership of 47 until Anderson was caught by Hussey ending England's innings on 425 all-out. The Australians had just under an hour before lunch and James Anderson claimed two wickets with the crucial wicket of Ricky Ponting. A 93 run partnership <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> Australians back in the game but 6 wickets for 53 runs put England into a very strong position going into day 3 with Hauritz and Siddle on 3* each.|$|E
25|$|One {{of those}} {{irregularities}} {{is related to}} juror No. 12. During the trial he violated his oath on several occasions and was referred to by Anand Jon’s lawyers as hardly an impartial juror. Although prohibited, juror No. 12 had discussed the case with his tenant and told her he felt the girls on the stand all <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> same or similar stories, {{and that he was}} under the impression they had all collaborated. Due to his fellow jurors’ anger towards him, juror No. 12 felt he was pressured to give a verdict that he didn’t want to give. Also, during deliberations, several jurors complained to the judge that juror No. 12 was refusing to properly deliberate and had made up his mind about the evidence. Although the jury foreman had requested that juror No. 12 be removed for refusal to deliberate, it was denied by Judge Wesley.|$|E
25|$|The {{game was}} closely contested by {{throughout}} the night as the lead changed 12 separate times, and the game was tied on 18 occasions. Regulation {{was not enough to}} settle this game, so the game went into overtime. The Pistons streaked out to a quick lead in the first few minutes of overtime, and <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> game in hand. However, a missed layup by Chauncey Billups with Detroit ahead 95-93 with nine seconds left San Antonio with a chance. On the Spurs' next possession, Robert Horry inbounded the ball to Ginobili, who headed for the left corner and dished it right back to Horry. Rasheed Wallace had left Horry to double-team Ginobili, and Horry was left alone to sink the game-winning basket with 5.8 seconds remaining in the OT. Horry was already famous for nailing last-second shots in the playoffs, including Game Four of the 2002 Western Conference Finals between the Lakers and Sacramento Kings.|$|E
