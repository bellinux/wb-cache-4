Mean comparisons of germination percentages revealed highly significant differences between the treatments (seeds with protective seed coats sown on farm yard manure) and control groups (seeds with protective seed coats sown on <b>standard</b> <b>soil</b> mixture) at P< 0. 05.

40|$|Soil {{ecotoxicology}} {{studies are}} usually performed in <b>standard</b> <b>soils,</b> {{such as the}} OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) artificial soil or the LUFA St. 2. 2, a natural soil. When assessing the toxic effects in the environment, soil properties are often different from those in <b>standard</b> <b>soils,</b> which {{might lead to a}} different exposure situation for the test species and, therefore, to a different evaluation of the risk of the test substance. Selected to cover a broad range of properties and based on the Euro-Soils concept, 18 different soils were studied regarding their suitability to two test species: Enchytraeus albidus and Enchytraeus luxuriosus (Enchytraeidae). In reproduction tests, the test species reacted differently to the tested soils, but both enchytracids did not survive in acid soils (i. e. pH <= 5). Results indicate that although a combined effect of soil properties seems to occur, certain soil properties are causing specific toxic effects. In the present study, EC(50) s in enchytraeids changed by a factor of 9 for juveniles and nearly 30 for the adults of E. luxuriosus (maximum values; slightly lower values were found for E albidus), which shows how important the test soil can become for the environmental risk assessment of chemicals. More data using more soils and species are required to understand the effect of soil properties in soil toxicology. Nevertheless, it was clear that certain soil properties such as OM (Organic Matter) and WHC (Water Holding Capacity) or pH, CEC (Cation Exchange Capacity), C/N (Carbon/Nitrogen ratio) and clay content did interact with the chemical and the organisms.

40|$|Soil {{ecotoxicology}} {{studies are}} usually performed in <b>standard</b> <b>soils</b> such as Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development artificial soil or LUFA ST. 2. 2, a natural soil. When assessing the toxic {{effects in the}} environment, soil properties are often different from those in <b>standard</b> <b>soils,</b> which {{might lead to a}} different exposure situation for the test species and therefore to misleading conclusions. Selected to cover a broad range of properties and based on the Euro-Soils concept, 17 different soils were studied regarding their suitability to two test species: Folsomia candida and Hypogastrura assimilis (Collembola). In reproduction tests, the test species reacted differently to the soils. F. candida was less affected by soil properties: 500 to 1200 juveniles/vessel were found in untreated soils (i. e., controls). These differences can be attributed to normal interindividual variability. H. assimilis showed a significant correlation with maximum water-holding capacity and also a tendency to lower the reproductive output in soils with a low pH (< 4). Therefore, some soils were revealed to be inappropriate for tests with H. assimilis. In the main tests, the effect of the reference test substance Phenmedipham (formulation Betosyp) was studied in those soils where sufficient reproduction was determined beforehand. Clearly, the chronic end point was more sensitive than survival when testing Phenmedipham. In H. assimilis, because of high variability and low effects in the tested dosages, no conclusions could be drawn. In F. candida, different soils caused different toxic effects: Juveniles preferred soils with high C-to-N ratios. Higher microbial activity might support a quicker metabolization of the test substance. In general, the toxic response is caused by a synergistic action of several soil properties with each of them exerting an effect too small to be clarified with the available set of data.
