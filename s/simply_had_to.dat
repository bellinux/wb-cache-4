5|$|Cameron and Comfort {{participated in}} a {{televised}} debate with atheists Brian Sapient and Kelly O'Conner of the Rational Response Squad, at Calvary Baptist Church, in Manhattan, on May 5, 2007. It was moderated by ABC's Martin Bashir and parts of it were aired on Nightline. At issue was the existence of God, which Comfort stated he could prove scientifically, without relying on faith or the Bible. The audience was composed of both theists and atheists. Points of discussion included atheism and evolution. While Sapient contended during his arguments that Comfort violated the rules by talking about the Ten Commandments, Cameron later stated on The Way of the Master radio show that {{the rules of the}} debate did not say that the Bible could never be referenced, but rather that Comfort <b>simply</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> come up with one argument that did not reference the Bible or faith.|$|E
25|$|Particularly at Cape Fear's outlet to the Atlantic, {{the area}} was {{enclosed}} by a half dozen Confederate positions. The river flowed to the sea through two relatively shallow inlets, which were partitioned by Smith Island now Bald Head Island. The existence of two inlets resulted in a crucial advantage: guided by the Confederates, the blockade runners were capable of avoiding the Union ships. They <b>simply</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> change course unexpectedly, alternatively between the two inlets.|$|E
25|$|Even {{the most}} passive wielders of the willow wand find them waving it about gaily on occasion, and Bannerman was no exception, {{with the first}} Sydney Test of Ivo Bligh's 1882/83 tour the most notable example. Going into the match, Australia was two-one down in the series, and it <b>simply</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> win this one. A Bannerman edge was spilt, and he decided, {{on the back of}} such fortune, to go on the offensive, hitting out in {{cavalier}} fashion for a delightfully short innings of 63.|$|E

500|$|The Ledder, or Ledbury Run, is a [...] {{cross country}} race that starts in [...] the town of Ledbury, goes over the Malvern Hills and {{finishes}} on the Senior, the main cricket pitch in {{the centre of the}} College. The first 9 runners receive Ledder Caps. In its early days there was no organised route and pupils <b>simply</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> get back to college as fast as they could.|$|E
500|$|The {{directors}} {{admitted that}} they were not keen on hiring solely big-named, A-list celebrities or top-billed actors to voice the film's main characters. Howard explained that, in order to be cast, the actors <b>simply</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> have the [...] "right voice" [...] for the characters, preferring voice actors [...] "who could ... bring a natural ease to those characters." [...] Greno elaborated, [...] "It was never about how big the star was ... It was always about ... who’s best for the part". Film critic James Berardinelli of ReelViews observed that this decision echoed [...] "Disney's approach during the late 1980s and early 1990s, when big name stars where often bypassed in favor of lesser known talents." [...] An additional asset was that the actor be able to perform well both independently and collaboratively.|$|E
500|$|After {{the release}} of the NES version, ports for the Mega Drive, Game Gear, Master System, Game Boy, Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), CD-I, and PC were developed. The Mega Drive team {{improved}} the handling (giving it an [...] "on-rails" [...] feel), and most of the graphics merely required redrawing. This involved adding colour, or simply recreating them based on the originals. Rotations were added to the vehicle sprites for smoother movement. According to artist Brian Hartley, the main considerations were the colour schemes, and it was decided to keep the game with a cartoon style. He stated it led to a [...] "fun use of colour". As the design decisions were made during the development for the NES version, the Mega Drive team <b>simply</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> convert the game for Mega Drive hardware. Galoob's only input was to ensure their logos were correct. The Mega Drive version was originally due for release in January 1993, but legal issues with Sega over the game being unlicensed delayed release until July.|$|E

500|$|Alvin Lu found The Warped Ones to be a {{prime example}} of the Sun Tribe genre and placed it among those films whose outlook made way for the Japanese pink film. In the film Tim Lucas noted antecedents and a {{possible}} influence to [...] "the most hellbent characters" [...] in the films of acclaimed director Quentin Tarantino's films and specifically to Stanley Kubrick's iconic A Clockwork Orange (1971). Lucas drew comparisons between The Warped Ones main character Akira and A Clockwork Oranges Alex DeLarge, including their respective obsessions with hard jazz and the music of Ludwig van Beethoven, the former with a framed copy of Ornette Coleman's album The Shape of Jazz to Come next to his bed, the latter an engraving of Beethoven. Also, scenes of the former's verbal deconstructions by a group of art students versus the latter's by the government. Akira's attacks on abstract art and DeLarge's on pop art–lined homes. Finally, the character's regular hangouts, both painted with black walls, the former's adorned with portraits of jazz legends, the latter's with advertisements for [...] "Vellocet" [...] and [...] "Drencrom"—the fictional drugs DeLarge and his gang use to invigorate themselves before their criminal acts. Lucas concluded, [...] "Kubrick <b>simply</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> have seen it." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Maple, Pickingill was {{sufficiently}} {{well known in}} Essex as an accomplished cunning man that people came to visit him from outside Canewdon in search of magical aid, sometimes [...] "from great distances", including men from the Essex village of Dengie, who sought his advice in a wage dispute. Meanwhile, as Maple noted, Canewdon had developed a reputation associating it with witchcraft and magic {{by the end of}} the nineteenth century, when it was often thought of as [...] "The Witch Country" [...] and avoided by many wagoners who feared having their vehicles bewitched. This was possibly due to its relative isolation from neighbouring settlements, as it was surrounded by marshland, and the insular nature of its community. Maple recorded that in this period there was a rumour that there were either six or nine elderly women living in Canewdon who were malevolent witches and used their magic to harm others. It was believed that whilst they were not known to one another, they all owed their allegiance to a singular wizard or master of witches, and there was a rumour in the local community that Pickingill himself was this figure. It was claimed that as [...] "Master of Witches", Pickingill <b>simply</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> whistle in order for these nine witches to stand by their front doors and reveal their identities, or that alternately he could [...] "will them" [...] to dance for him in the local churchyard.|$|E

[...] They believe that adoption {{of the popular vote}} would shift the disproportionate focus to large cities at the expense of rural areas.|$|E

2500|$|The {{product range}} {{underwent}} extensive development, {{with the design}} team using focus groups [...] "mostly comprising boys aged between six and 12, but also child psychologists". Designer William Thorogood commented on these focus groups that [...] "it emerged that there were certain key icons the product <b>simply</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> include: propellers, dome cockpits, big lights, helmets, harpoons, torpedo-like weapons, tridents, giant squid and, of course, evil sharks." [...] The focus groups also threw up some surprising views on particular Lego pieces, such as transparent pieces, which {{the boys in the}} focus groups determinedly asserted as being [...] "magical". There is also a ride at Legoland Windsor, making it the 3rd ride to be based on a Lego theme, preceded by Fire Academy and Laser Raiders.|$|E
2500|$|Ferrer may be {{best remembered}} for his {{performance}} {{in the title role}} of Cyrano de Bergerac, which he first played on Broadway in 1946. Ferrer feared that the production would be a failure in rehearsals, due to the open dislike for the play by director Mel Ferrer (no relation), so he called in Joshua Logan (who had directed his star-making performance in Charley's Aunt) to serve as [...] "play doctor" [...] for the production. Logan wrote that he <b>simply</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> eliminate pieces of business which director Ferrer had inserted in his staging; they presumably were intended to sabotage the more sentimental elements of the play that the director considered to be corny and in bad taste. The production became one of the hits of the 1946/47 Broadway season, winning Ferrer the first Best Actor Tony Award for his depiction of the long-nosed poet/swordsman.|$|E
2500|$|Admiral Tryon was {{concerned}} that the normal system of signalling between ships would become unworkable in real war conditions. To send a signal required hoisting a flag sequence, waiting for all ships to raise flags to confirm they had seen and understood, and then lowering the initial flags to signal everyone to carry it out. [...] The signals book had grown to hundreds of pages describing the many possible flag combinations and virtually no one knew them all. In a real battle this process might take too much time, or might be entirely impossible if enemy fire had destroyed the masts from which the flags must fly, or smoke made them impossible to read. Instead, Tryon proposed a simple signal, using the letter-flags T and A, which simply instructed captains to follow their leader. Other flag signals might be used additionally as circumstances allowed, but once the initial order was given, the ships <b>simply</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> follow the movements of their leaders. A few, basic, single flag signals were designated for particular movements, which would simply be flown without needing acknowledgement. This was {{a radical departure from}} contemporary practice, in which all movements were precisely signalled from the flagship and acknowledged by their recipients. Opinion was fiercely divided about it, for instance The Times newspaper considered it [...] "unsound in theory and perilous in practice", whilst Rear-Admiral William Kennedy on the East Indies station declared following experiments with it that [...] "the officers commanding thoroughly appreciated the idea which would be invaluable in time of war".|$|E
