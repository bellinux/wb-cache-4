40|$|Abstract — Co-development {{of design}} rules and layout methodologies {{is the key}} to {{successful}} adoption of a technology. In this work, we propose Chip-level Design Rule Evaluator (ChipDRE), the first framework for systematic evaluation of design rules and their interaction with layouts, performance, margins and yield at the chip scale (as opposed to standard cell-level). A “good chips per wafer ” metric is used to unify area, performance, variability and yield. The framework uses a generated virtual standard-cell library coupled with a mix of physical design, semi-empirical, and machine-learning-based models to estimate area and delay at the chip level. The result is a unified design-quality estimate that can be computed fast enough to allow using ChipDRE to optimize a large number of complex design rules. For instance, a study of well-to-active <b>spacing</b> <b>rule</b> reveals a non-monotone dependence of rule value to chip area (although the dependence to cell area is monotone) due to delay changes coming from well-proximity effect.

40|$|Abstract—Double/Multiple-patterning (DP/MP) {{lithography}} in {{a multiple}} litho-etch steps {{process is a}} favorable solution for technology scaling to the 20 nm node and below. Mask-assignment conflicts represent the biggest challenge for MP and limiting them through design rules is crucial for the adoption of MP technology. In this paper, we offer a methodology for the early evaluation and exploration of layout and MP rules intended for speeding up the rules-development cycle. Using a novel wiring-estimation method, we create layout estimates with fine-grained congestion prediction. MP-conflicts are then predicted using a machine-learning approach. In this work, we demonstrate {{the use of the}} method for double-patterning lithography in litho-etch-litho-etch process; the methodology is more general, however, and can be applied for other multiple-patterning technologies includ-ing tripe/multiple-patterning with multiple litho-etch steps, self-aligned double patterning (SADP), and directed self-assembly. Results of testing the methodology on standard-cell layouts show an 81 % accuracy in DP-conflicts prediction. The methodology was then used to explore DP and layout rules and investigate their effects on DP-compatibility and layout area. The methodology allows for rules optimization; for example, pushing the minimum tip-to-side same-color <b>spacing</b> <b>rule</b> value from 1. 7 × to 1. 5 × the minimum side-to-side spacing design rule (i. e., from 110 nm down to 90 nm) would more than double the number of DP-compatible cells in the library.

Special emphasis is given to field theory in anti-de Sitter space, as it represents a maximally symmetric space-time of constant curvature which could arise in the local description of matter interactions in the small regions of space-time. Transform <b>space</b> <b>rules</b> for evaluating Feynman diagrams in Euclidean anti-de Sitter space are initially defined using eigenfunctions based on generalized plane waves.

A proof of the analogue of Goldstone’s theorem in anti-de Sitter space is given using a generalized plane wave representation of the commutator of the current and the scalar field.

In Arabidopsis thaliana, stomatal development is preceded by asymmetric cell divisions, and stomatal distribution follows the one-cell <b>spacing</b> <b>rule,</b> reflecting {{the coordination of}} cell fate specification. Stomatal development and patterning are regulated by both genetic and environmental signals. Here, we report that Arabidopsis MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE 3 (MPK 3) and MPK 6, two environmentally responsive mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and their upstream MAPK kinases, MKK 4 and MKK 5, are key regulators of stomatal development and patterning. Loss of function of MKK 4 /MKK 5 or MPK 3 /MPK 6 disrupts the coordinated cell fate specification of stomata versus pavement cells, resulting {{in the formation of}} clustered stomata. Conversely, activation of MKK 4 /MKK 5 -MPK 3 /MPK 6 causes the suppression of asymmetric cell divisions and stomatal cell fate specification, resulting in a lack of stomatal differentiation.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to investigate the possibility of increasing the useful bandwidth of multilayer mirrors. Mirrors 'constructed' with non-periodically spaced reflecting surfaces were considered. These structures included depth-graded and laterally-graded mirrors as well as those with reflectors located via a log-periodic <b>spacing</b> <b>rule.</b> No enhancement of bandwidth resulted from simulations of simple versions of any of the three non-periodic mirrors. However, certain depth-graded structures did exhibit reflectances essentially the same as from uniform mirrors. Moreover, it was found that some control was possible regarding the location (with respect to energy) of the maximum reflectance peak. Effective bandwidth was increased when composite models were simulated. In two of the cases studied, bandwidth was enhanced by a factor of approximately 3. One model consisted of a depth-graded mirror constructed with three separately defined structures, or blocks. Each block consisted of two layer-pairs repeated three times. Then, the entire 18 layer-pair group was repeated several times. Simulation of this 3 block depth-graded configuration yielded three reflectance peaks, one representative of each depth-graded block. The other configurations resulting in enhanced bandwidth assumed independently constructed mirrors immediately adjacent to each other and sharing the same substrate. Reflectance peaks from each mirror appeared in the response. Both basic models show greatly enhanced effective bandwidths even though the reflectance curves appear as non-overlapping for these specific models. Additionally, these configurations are realizable.
