40|$|Abstract—Research {{based on}} {{computer}} simulations, especially that conducted through agent-based experimentation, is often criticised {{for not being}} a reliable source of information – the simulation software can hide errors or flawed designs that inherently bias results. Consequently, the academic community shows both enthusiasm and lack of trust for such approaches. In order to gain confidence is using engineered systems, domains such as Safety Critical Systems employ structured argumentation techniques as means of explicitly relating claims to evidence – in other words, requirements to deliverables. We argue here that structured argumentation {{should be used in}} the development and validation process of simulation-driven research. Making use of the Goal <b>Structuring</b> <b>Notation,</b> we provide insights into how more trustworthy outcomes can be obtained through argumentation-driven validation.

40|$|Abstract. Safety {{policy is}} a {{collection}} of rules that govern the behaviour of entities such that they do not cause accidents. It has been suggested that policies in general can be expressed at various levels of abstraction and organised as a hierarchy of goals. In developing policy, it is desirable to decompose from top-level objectives down to rules in a structured manner. The Goal <b>Structuring</b> <b>Notation</b> (GSN) allows us to model the policy decomposition in order to scrutinise and better understand the development process. In so doing, a number of issues arise concerning reusable patterns of decomposition and the assumed models of the system whose behaviour the policy is intended to govern. This paper discusses the need to structure a safety policy decomposition and how modelling techniques and patterns can aid in this. ...|$|R
