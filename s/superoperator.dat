40|$|We {{consider}} the Lindblad equation for {{a collection of}} multilevel systems coupled to independent environments. The equation is symmetric under the exchange of the labels associated with each system and thus the open-system dynamics {{takes place in the}} permutation-symmetric subspace of the operator space. The dimension of this space grows polynomially with the number of systems. We construct a basis of this space and a set of <b>superoperators</b> whose action on this basis is easily specified. For a given number of levels, M, these <b>superoperators</b> are written in terms of a bosonic realization of the generators of the Lie algebra M^ 2. In some cases, these results enable finding an analytic solution of the master equation using known Lie-algebraic methods. To demonstrate this, we obtain an analytic expression for the state operator of a collection of three-level atoms coupled to independent radiation baths. When analytic solutions are difficult to find, the basis and the <b>superoperators</b> can be used to considerably reduce the computational resources required for simulations...|$|R

It is shown that the application of the TCL technique to this class of correlated <b>superoperators</b> enables the non-perturbative treatment of the dynamics of system-environment models for which the standard approach fails in any finite order of the coupling strength. We demonstrate further that the correlated <b>superoperators</b> correspond {{to the idea of a}} best guess of conditional quantum expectations which is determined by a suitable Hilbert space average. The general approach is illustrated by means of the model of a spin which interacts through randomly distributed couplings with a finite reservoir consisting of two energy bands.

5000|$|A formal {{construction}} of a local equation of motion with a Markovian property is an alternative to a reduced derivation. The theory {{is based on an}} axiomatic approach. The basic starting point is a completely positive map. The assumption is that the initial system-environment state is uncorrelated [...] and the combined dynamics is generated by a unitary operator. Such a map falls under the category of Kraus operator. The most general type of and time-homogeneous master equation with Markovian property describing non-unitary evolution of the density matrix ρ that is trace-preserving and completely positive for any initial condition is the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad equation or GKSL equation: is a (Hermitian) Hamiltonian part and :is the dissipative part describing implicitly through system operators [...] the influence of the bath on the system.The Markov property imposesthat the system and bath are uncorrelated at all times [...]The GKSL equation is unidirectional and leads any initial state [...] to a steady state solution which is an invariant of the equation of motion [...]The family of maps generated by the GKSL equation forms a Quantum dynamical semigroup.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{transport}} through a strongly interacting Anderson quantum dot at zero-temperature using the real-time renormalization group (RT-RG) {{in the framework}} of a kinetic equation for the reduced density operator. We further develop the general finite temperature real-time transport formalism by introducing field <b>superoperators</b> that obey fermionic statistics. This direct second quantization in Liouville-Fock space strongly simplifies the construction of operators and <b>superoperators</b> which transform irreducibly under the Anderson-model symmetry transformations. The fermionic field <b>superoperators</b> naturally arise from the univalence (fermion-parity) superselection rule for the total system. Expressed in these field <b>superoperators,</b> the causal structure of the perturbation theory for the effective time-evolution superoperator-kernel becomes explicit. The causal structure also implies the existence of a fermion-parity protected eigenvector of the exact Liouvillian, explaining a recently reported result on adiabatic driving [Phys. Rev. B 85, 075301 (2012) ] and generalizing it to arbitrary order in the tunnel coupling. Furthermore, in the WBL the causal representation exponentially reduces the number of diagrams for the time-evolution kernel. We perform a complete 2 -loop RG analysis at finite voltage and magnetic field, while systematically accounting for the dependence on both the quantum dot and reservoir frequencies. Using the second quantization in Liouville-space and symmetry restrictions we obtain analytical RT-RG equations with an efficient numerical solution and we extensively study the model parameter space, excluding the Kondo regime. The incorporated renormalization effects result in an enhancement of the inelastic cotunneling peak. Moreover, we find a tunnel-induced non-linearity of the stability diagrams at finite voltage, both in the SET and ICT regime. Comment: With respect to the version of 13. 07. 2012 : Corrected typos.

40|$|Recently we {{introduced}} a new formalism of fermionic <b>superoperators</b> in Liouville-Fock space to enable {{for the first time}} a real-time renormalization group analysis cite{Saptsov 12 a} of the non-equilibrium Anderson model in the stationary state. Here we show that this approach also sheds new light on physics of the relaxation of a quantum dot to the stationary state. With help of <b>superoperators</b> possessing a fermionic statistics we obtain new, general properties of an effective dot Liouvillian of a quantum dot which are not at all obvious in other formulations. In particular we elegantly explain a recent theoretical observation cite{Contreras 12 } on a relaxation of an Anderson quantum to the equilibrium state and generalize this to arbitrary order in a coupling constant $Gamma$. We furthermore, consider the non-interacting and weakly interacting quantum dots and show their generalization to "beyond of wide band limit" and "beyond of factorisable initial conditions" limits. The solution for the non-interacting case turns out to be very illustrative and intuitive: perturbation series in $Gamma$ truncates at a finite (second) order due to anti-commutation algebra of the <b>superoperators.</b> For the weakly interacting case in the wide band limit we show relations between perturbative series in the coupling constant $Gamma$ and interaction $U$.

40|$|The {{results of}} quantum process {{tomography}} on a three-qubit {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} quantum information processor are presented, and shown {{to be consistent with}} a detailed model of the system-plus-apparatus used for the experiments. The quantum operation studied was the quantum Fourier transform, which is important in several quantum algorithms and poses a rigorous test for the precision of our recently-developed strongly modulating control fields. The results were analyzed in an attempt to decompose the implementation errors into coherent (overall systematic), incoherent (microscopically deterministic), and decoherent (microscopically random) components. This analysis yielded a <b>superoperator</b> consisting of a unitary part that was strongly correlated with the theoretically expected unitary <b>superoperator</b> of the quantum Fourier transform, an overall attenuation consistent with decoherence, and a residual portion that was not completely positive - although complete positivity is required for any quantum operation. By comparison with the results of computer simulations, the lack of complete positivity was shown to be largely a consequence of the incoherent errors during the quantum process tomography procedure. These simulations further showed that coherent, incoherent, and decoherent errors can often be identified by their distinctive effects on the spectrum of the overall <b>superoperator.</b> The gate fidelity of the experimentally determined <b>superoperator</b> was 0. 64, while the correlation coefficient between experimentally determined <b>superoperator</b> and the simulated <b>superoperator</b> was 0. 79; most of the discrepancies with the simulations could be explained by the cummulative effect of small errors in the single qubit gates.

40|$|We examine {{constraints}} on quantum operations imposed by relativistic causality.

We show here on the Friedrichs model, that we can specify uniquely such a transformation in agreement with our previous "new quantum rules for dissipative systems".
