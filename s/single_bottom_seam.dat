30|$|In {{the present}} {{investigation}} an attempt {{has been made to}} demineralize the Gondwana coal of Gopinathpur top and <b>bottom</b> <b>seams</b> of Mugma mine, Raniganj coalfield, Dhanbad with the help of Pseudomonas mendocina strain B 6 - 1. The change in the amount of ash yield and decrease in the concentration of selected minor elements like Na, K, Mn and Ca and environmentally sensitive selected trace elements such as Cd, Pb, Se, Ni, Mn, and Zn have been studied as a function of time of bacterial treatment as well as with variation in the bacterial biomass. After 28  days of bacterial treatment there was variable amount of decrease observed in ash yield {{as well as in the}} concentration of minor and trace elements. The removal of the elements was further enhanced with the increase in the bacterial biomass from 10 to 25  mg/mL. Due to over exploitation of superior grade coals in the country, the remaining coal resources, available for current use, are inferior in grade and contain high level of impurities and there is ample scope of bio-beneficiation of these coals using bacterial biomass.|$|R
30|$|The present paper {{entails the}} results of the {{investigations}} carried out on the lignite deposits of Kachchh Basin. The lignite samples were drawn from five lignite seams from Panandhro lignite field (Seam-I to -V) and eight lignite seams (Seam-I to -VIII) from the Matanomadh lignite field which are currently operational. The petrographic analysis of the lignites indicates a dominance of huminite group of macerals which is mainly contributed by ulminite-A, ulminite-B, attrinite, densinite, and phlobaphinite. Liptinite (chiefly sporinite, cutinite, resinite, and liptodetrinite) and inertinite (chiefly fusinite, funginite, and inertodetrinite) groups occur in subordinated amount. The mineral matter occurs in moderate concentration. Though sulfur content is high in these lignites, there is no fixed trend of variation of sulfur from <b>bottom</b> <b>seam</b> to top seam. The investigation reveals a flooded forest swamp having high rate of degradation. However, there were a few drier periods indicated by relatively more inertinite macerals. The petrography-based models indicate that the Kachchh lignites of Gujarat evolved in coastal marshy setting under transgressive phase. However, there were few intermittent fluvial activities giving rise to supratidal flood plain. This {{led to the formation of}} the associated carbonaceous shales in the basin.|$|R
