5|$|A {{peculiar}} {{feature of}} Muslim castles in the Iberian Peninsula {{was the use}} of detached towers, called Albarrana towers, around the perimeter as can be seen at the Alcazaba of Badajoz. Probably developed in the 12thcentury, the towers provided flanking fire. They were connected to the castle by removable wooden bridges, <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> towers were captured the rest of the castle was not accessible.|$|E

5|$|While MLS {{has looked}} into {{changing}} to a fall-to-spring format, {{there are no}} current plans to do <b>so.</b> <b>If</b> <b>the</b> league were to change its schedule, a substantial winter break would still be necessary due to teams being located in harsh winter climates. It {{would also have to}} compete with the popularity and media presence of the National Football League (NFL) in the fall and winter as well as the National Basketball Association (NBA) and National Hockey League (NHL), which both run on fall-to-spring schedules.|$|E
5|$|Indoor {{residual}} spraying is the spraying of insecticides on {{the walls}} inside a home. After feeding, many mosquitoes rest on a nearby surface while digesting the bloodmeal, <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> walls of houses have been coated with insecticides, the resting mosquitoes can be killed before they can bite another person and transfer the malaria parasite. As of 2006, the World Health Organization recommends 12 insecticides in IRS operations, including DDT and the pyrethroids cyfluthrin and deltamethrin. This public health use of small amounts of DDT is permitted under the Stockholm Convention, which prohibits its agricultural use. One problem with all forms of IRS is insecticide resistance. Mosquitoes affected by IRS tend to rest and live indoors, and due to the irritation caused by spraying, their descendants tend to rest and live outdoors, meaning that they are less affected by the IRS.|$|E
5|$|Surprised by Aberhart's {{refusal to}} be drawn into open conflict, the insurgents needed time to {{reassess}} their strategy. They got that time when, on March17, Lieutenant-Governor Primrose died, necessitating a five-day adjournment while the federal government selected a replacement. When the legislature reconvened March 22 or 23, the dissidents filibustered against the budget. Albert Bourcier opened debate, and was followed by, among others, Edith Rogers, Ansley, and Wilson Cain. On March24, Harry Knowlton Brown moved an adjournment, which was carried over the government's objections by a vote of 27 to 25. Though the insurgents considered this a vote of non-confidence in Aberhart's government, he refused to resign; he acknowledged, however, that he would do <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> budget itself was defeated.|$|E

5|$|The crew of Atlantis had six {{possible}} landing opportunities on Saturday. Managers {{evaluated the}} best three opportunities {{of the day}} to try bring the orbiter home. Saturday's first landing opportunity at Kennedy Space Center was waived due to poor weather forecasts, and observed weather violations for the landing criteria. After further evaluating weather patterns around Florida, managers on the ground chose to waive the second opportunity as well, and wait one more day to attempt to get the orbiter into Florida on Sunday. Weather in California had excellent forecasts, <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> attempts on Sunday to land in Florida were not successful, the shuttle would be able to land at Edwards Air Force Base without weather being an issue.|$|E
5|$|The senior project {{consists}} of four main P's project, paper, portfolio and presentation. The {{students are required to}} work on a project outside of class that takes at least 15 hours of their time. This project can be anything. Their paper then has to relate in some way to their project, <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> project is creating a bird house the paper could be able the best type of bird house. The portfolio then brings everything together with evidence to prove that the project was completed. The presentation is then given at least 3 times and ties all of the items together. All the projects are judged throughout the year, and the top four receive a scholarship to help finance their college education.|$|E
5|$|There are 53 {{municipalities}} of Finland in which Finnish {{is not the}} sole official language. In Finland, as of December 31, 2013, 89.3% of the population speak Finnish, 5.3% Swedish and 0.04% Sami languages. Both Finnish and Swedish are official languages of Finland. Officially, a municipality is bilingual if the minority language group consists of at least 8% of the population, or at least 3,000 speakers. A previously bilingual municipality remains <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> linguistic minority proportion drops below 8%, up to 6%. If it drops below 6%, {{it is possible for}} the municipality to remain bilingual by government decree, on the recommendation of the municipal council, for a further ten years. Municipalities that make use of the 3,000-speaker rule include the national capital Helsinki and the cultural center of Swedish Finns, Turku. On the Åland archipelago, where Finnish is almost absent from daily life, the language law does not apply. On the mainland, the highest proportion of Swedish-speakers is found on the western coast, in Ostrobothnia.|$|E

5|$|When {{a warrior}} is so old, or sustains an injury {{that means they}} can no longer serve their Clan, they retire to become elders. Elders live out the {{remainder}} of their life in general peace, using it as a time of rest and relaxation. They sleep in their own separate den, which is looked after by the apprentices. Elders are not expected to hunt or fight for their Clan, but are able to do <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> mood takes them. Their only expected duty is to carry the body of a deceased Clanmate to their grave. Every cat of the Clan respects and appreciates the elders, thanking them for the time they have spent upholding their roles as a warrior. Sadly, it is rare for a Clan to have more than three or four elders, as many warriors die before they can retire.|$|E
5|$|Once granted, {{a coat of}} arms {{becomes the}} {{hereditary}} and inheritable property of the owner and his descendants. However, this can only be <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> inheritor is a legitimate male-line descendent of the person originally granted with the arms. To establish the right to arms by descent, one {{must be able to}} prove that an ancestor had his arms recorded in the registers of the College. If there is a possibility of such an inheritance, one must first make contact with an officer-in-waiting at the College, who could then advise on the course of action and the cost of such a search. The research into a descent of arms requires details of paternal ancestry, which will involve the examination of genealogical records. The first step involve a search of the family name in the College's archives, as coats of arms and family name has no connection, the officer could prove, through this method, that there is in fact no descent. However, if a connection is found a genealogical research outside of the College's archives would then be undertaken to provide definitive evidence of descent from an armigerous individual.|$|E
