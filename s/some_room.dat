25|$|The essay, {{written in}} harsh tones, listed what Caragiale {{saw as the}} major social {{problems}} tolerated by Romanian administrations: he discussed the landowning class, successor to the boyars, having maintained as much possible from the legacy of serfdom; he noted that, while the commerce was dominated by foreigners, the administration was gripped by a no longer aristocratic oligarchy and its far-reaching political machine. As several commentators noted, many of the topics brought up by Caragiale built on the critical overview adopted by Junimea. To {{the social and political}} problems, the text offered a monarchist solution—Caragiale expected Carol I to carry out a coup d'état against the Romanian political establishment, replacing the Constitution of 1866, which left <b>some</b> <b>room</b> for privilege through the census suffrage, with a more democratic one.|$|E

25|$|Ireland had no regular central {{authority}} {{capable of making}} new law and hence the Brehon laws were entirely {{in the hands of}} the jurists. As such some early scholars felt that the legal system was essentially unchanging and archaic. However, more recently scholars have noticed that some methods of change were laid out within the Brehon laws. In particular, Cóic Conara Fugill mentions five bases on which a judge must base judgment, and at least three offer <b>some</b> <b>room</b> for change: fásach (legal maxim), cosmailius (legal analogy), and aicned (natural law) (the other two are roscad, a type of legal verse jurists were trained to create to mark a statement made by someone who knows the law and teistimin (scriptural testimony)). However, it has not yet been studied in detail how exactly these three innovative methods were used.|$|E

500|$|While Burgoyne's troop {{strength}} was nominally higher, he likely had only about 5,000 effective, battle-ready troops on October 7, as losses {{from the earlier}} battles in the campaign and desertions following the September 19 battle had reduced his forces. [...] General Riedesel advised that the army retreat. Burgoyne decided to reconnoiter the American left flank to see if an attack was possible. [...] As an escort, the generals took Fraser's Advanced Corps, with light troops and the 24th Foot {{on the right and}} the combined British grenadiers on the left, and a force drawn from all the German regiments in the army in the center. [...] There were eight British cannon under Major Williams and two Hesse-Hanau cannon under Captain Pausch. [...] Leaving their camp between 10 and 11 am, they advanced about three-quarters of a mile (1km) to Barber's wheat field on a rise above Mill Brook, where they stopped to observe the American position. [...] While the field afforded <b>some</b> <b>room</b> for artillery to work, the flanks were dangerously close to the surrounding woods.|$|E

2500|$|Provided with a {{low power}} {{klystron}} as a microwave source, Lovell and Hodgkin began experimenting with horn antennas that would offer significantly higher angular accuracy than the Yagi antennas used on the Mk. IV. Instead of broadcasting the radar signal across the entire forward hemisphere of the aircraft and listening to echoes from everywhere in that volume, this system would allow the radar to be used like a flashlight, pointed {{in the direction of}} observation. This would also have the side-effect of allowing the radar to avoid ground reflections simply by pointing the antenna away from the ground. With a beamwidth of 10 degrees, a horizontal antenna would still create some downward-pointed signal, about 5 degrees in this case. If the aircraft were flying at , the beam would not strike the ground until about [...] in front of the aircraft, leaving <b>some</b> <b>room</b> for detection against even the lowest flying targets.

[...] This group's membership consisted mostly of representatives of some of the larger operators of urban electric street railways in the United States plus potential manufacturers. [...] Three interurban lines and at least one [...] "heavy rail," [...] or rapid transit, operator - the Chicago Rapid Transit Company - were represented as well. [...] Also included on the membership roll were manufacturers of surface cars (streetcars) and interested component suppliers. The ERPCC goal was to design a streamlined, comfortable, quiet, and fast accelerating and braking streetcar that would be operated by a seated operator utilizing floor mounted pedal controls to better {{meet the needs of the}} street railways and to better appeal to riders. [...] The committee prepared a detailed research plan, conducted extensive research on streetcar design, built and tested components, made necessary modifications and revisions based upon the findings, and, in the end, produced a set of specifications for a standardized and fixed design (albeit one with a modest list of available options with <b>some</b> <b>room</b> for customer customization) to be built with standard parts as opposed to a custom designed carbody with any variety of different parts added depending on the whims and requirements of the individual customer. An excellent product emerged, the PCC car, as was proved in later years by numerous national and international users.|$|E
