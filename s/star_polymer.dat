Furthermore, as-assembled star/star multilayer films exhibit distinct morphological changes by undergoing extensive structural reorganization upon post-treatment under different pH conditions that do not lead to any changes with their linear compositional counterparts; it is hypothesized that these differences are due to the star polyelectrolyte's compact structure and decreased extent of entanglement and interpenetration, which lead to a low degree of ionic cross-linking compared to their linear counterparts. The pH-responsive structural changes of the films are characterized by AFM, SEM, and FTIR.

A challenging task in this filed is how to precisely control the interactions between <b>star</b> <b>polymers</b> and with other components, and maintain the responsive properties of the functional stars in the assembled nanostructures. Therefore, {{the goal of the}} proposed work is to understand the responsive properties and interactions of <b>star</b> <b>polymers</b> in different conditions, including solution and interfaces, and utilize them as building blocks for polymeric micro- and nano-structures such as polymersomes, ultrathin films and microcapsules, which have intriguing properties in terms of stability, responsiveness and functionalities compared with conventional linear polymers based structures. Specifically, in the first place, we studied the solution phase behavior of responsive <b>star</b> <b>polymers</b> by using in situ (small angle neutron scattering) SANS, and showed that in semidilute solution, the temperature induced phase separation for thermo-responsive <b>star</b> <b>polymers</b> are significantly different from that of their linear counterparts. The <b>star</b> <b>polymers</b> show limited microphase separation with aggregates composed of several molecules, while the corresponding linear polymers have LSCT (low critical solution temperature) type phase separation. Secondly, we studied the responsive properties and assembly of amphiphilic <b>star</b> <b>polymers</b> at the air/water interface and in Langmuir-Blodgett monolayer. We found that the confined interface environment leads to different conformational changes and assembly behaviors of the <b>star</b> <b>polymers</b> compared with those in solution state. For instance, when there is a hydrophilic to hydrophobic transition, the polymers tend to go from water subphase to the air/water interface, rather than showing coil to globule transition in aqueous solution. Thirdly, we utilized the <b>star</b> <b>polymers</b> as major component to fabricate 3 D responsive microstructures such as thin shell microcapsules, by using layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly technique, which has rarely been explored before, especially for complex star block copolymers. The assembly microcapsules have hierarchical multicompartmental structure, which enables the encapsulation and release of multiple molecules simultaneously.

40|$|Polydisperse hyperbranched polyesters were {{modified}} {{for use as}} novel multifunctional reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT) agents. The polyester-core-based RAFT {{agents were}} subsequently employed to synthesize <b>star</b> <b>polymers</b> of n-butyl acrylate and styrene with low polydispersity (polydispersity index 70 %) and molecular weights [M-n > 140, 000 g mol(- 1), linear poly(methyl methacrylate) equivalents) ], the corresponding styrene-based system reached a maximum molecular weight at low conversions (approximate to 30 %, M-n = 45, 500 g mol(- 1), linear polystyrene equivalents). The resulting <b>star</b> <b>polymers</b> were subsequently used as platforms for the preparation of star block copolymers of styrene and n-butyl acrylate with a polyester core with low polydispersities (polydispersity index < 1. 25). The generated polystyrene-based <b>star</b> <b>polymers</b> were successfully cast into highly regular honeycomb-structured microarrays. (C) 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R

40|$|Linear and <b>star</b> <b>polymers</b> in {{solution}} are {{studied in}} the presence of shear flow. The solvent is described by a particle-based mesoscopic simulation technique, which accounts for hydrodynamic interactions. The scaling properties of the average gyration tensor, the orientation angle, and the rotation frequency are investigated for various arm lengths and arm numbers. With increasing functionality f, <b>star</b> <b>polymers</b> exhibit a crossover in their flow properties from those of linear polymers to a novel behavior, which resembles the tank-treading motion of elastic capsules...|$|R
