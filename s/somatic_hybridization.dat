It is closely related to the potato and, as it has evolved strong resistance to all known varieties of potato blight, has been used to genetically engineer resistance into the cultivated varieties of potatoes around the world. The use of genetic engineering is helpful, as efforts to hybridize by traditional methods have so far been unsuccessful, and the use of <b>somatic</b> <b>hybridization</b> to transfer genes is difficult.

40|$|<b>Somatic</b> <b>hybridization</b> is the {{particle}} collider {{of the biological}} world: where plant cells stripped of their cell wall are fused to create interspecific crosses containing a huge range of genetic information.

40|$|Cytosine {{methylation}} {{is a well}} recognized epigenetic mark. Here, the methylation {{status of}} a salinity-tolerant wheat cultivar (cv. SR 3, derived from a <b>somatic</b> <b>hybridization</b> event) and its progenitor parent (cv. JN 177) was explored both globally and within a set of 24 genes responsive to salinity stress. A further comparison was made between DNA extracted from plants grown under control conditions and when challenged by salinity stress. The SR 3 and JN 177 genomes differed {{with respect to their}} global methylation level, and methylation levels were reduced by exposure to salinity stress. We found the genetic stress- (triggered by a combination of different genomes in <b>somatic</b> <b>hybridization)</b> induced methylation pattern of 13 loci in non-stressed SR 3; the same 13 loci were found to undergo methylation in sal-inity-stressed JN 177. For the salinity-responsive genes, SR 3 and JN 177 also showed different methylation modifications. C methylation polymorphisms induced by salinity stress were present in both the promoter and coding regions of some of the 24 selected genes, but only the former were associated with changes in transcript abundance. The ex-pression of both TaFLS 1 (encoding a flavonol synthase) and TaWRSI 5 (encoding a Bowman–Birk-type protease in-hibitor), which showed both a different expression and a different DNA methylation level between SR 3 and JN 177, enhanced the salinity tolerance of Arabidopsis thaliana.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of sour orange rootstock {{in the southern}} and {{eastern part of the}} Mediterranean Basin is presently threatened by the spread of Citrus Tristeza Virus (CTV) and its main vector Toxoptera citricida, combined with abiotic constraints such as drought, salinity and alkalinity. The search for alternative CTV-resistant rootstocks that also withstand the other constraints is now considered an urgent priority for a sustainable citrus industry in the area. Complementary progenitors can be found in citrus germplasm to combine the desired traits, particularly between Poncirus and Citrus genera. The production of somatic hybrids allows cumulating all dominant traits irrespective of their heterozygosity level, and would appear to be an effective way to solve the rootstock challenge facing the Mediterranean citrus industry. This paper presents the results obtained during a regional collaborative effort between five countries, to develop new rootstocks by <b>somatic</b> <b>hybridization.</b> New embryogenic callus lines to be used for <b>somatic</b> <b>hybridization</b> have been created.

40|$|Protoplast {{regeneration}} {{is essential}} for <b>somatic</b> <b>hybridizations.</b> In this study, a standard method for plantlet regeneration from Cichorium protoplasts was developed. We evaluated {{the effect of the}} low melting point agarose (LMPA) bead technique on the regeneration capacity of protoplasts of seven C. intybus and four C. endivia genotypes. The LMPA bead technique was more efficient than culture in liquid or solid medium and allowed us to obtain plating efficiencies up to 4. 9 % in C. intybus genotypes and efficiencies of up to 0. 7 % in C. endivia genotypes. Moreover, the LMPA bead technique offers great advantages over liquid and solid culture systems: the media can be readily refreshed, protoplasts can be monitored separately, and microcalli can easily be removed from the beads. This increased efficiency was observed for all of the 11 Cichorium genotypes tested. Shoot formation was induced more efficiently when using 0. 5 mg l- 1 indole- 3 -acetic acid-enriched medium (up to 87. 5 % of the protoplast-derived calli started shoot development) compared to 1 -naphthaleneacetic acid-enriched medium. The LMPA bead technique optimized in this study enabled {{for the first time the}} full plantlet regeneration from protoplasts of C. endivia genotypes and increased the protoplast regenerating ability in other Cichorium species. This finetuned LMPA bead technique can therefore be applied for protoplast regeneration after protoplast fusions of the genus Cichorium...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} mitochondrial genes on stamen development of higher plants, protoplasts from three different, male-sterile tobacco cultivars were fused. The fused cells were cultured individually into calli, from which plants were regenerated. Cybrid plants were obtained that exhibited flowers with recombined biparental male-sterile morphology and with novel male-sterile stamens that differed from any types from sexual or <b>somatic</b> <b>hybridizations</b> described previously. The male-sterile morphologies of these cybrids and their parents {{support the hypothesis that}} nuclear-mitochondrial interaction occurs at several stages in tobacco floral development and that several mitochondrial genes are necessary for normal stamen and corolla development. Analysis by restriction endonuclease digestion of mitochondrial DNA of male-sterile cybrids and their parents revealed that the mitochondrial DNA of male-sterile cybrids with parental floral morphology was unchanged when compared with parental mitochondrial DNA. Cybrids that were morphologically similar to one parent's male-sterile phenotype had mitochondrial DNA almost identical to that parent, whereas cybrids with recombined biparental or novel male-sterile phenotypes contained mitochondrial DNA different from both male-sterile parents and from each other. A set of mitochondrial DNA fragments could be correlated with split corollas, a feature found in several tobacco male-sterile cultivars. DNA gel blot analysis using a number of mitochondrial genes confirmed the conclusions based on ethidium bromide staining of mitochondrial DNA restriction digests...|$|R

40|$|Oryza meyeriana {{is highly}} {{resistant}} to rice bacterial blight (BB) and this resistance trait has {{been transferred to}} cultivated rice (O. sativa) using asymmetric <b>somatic</b> <b>hybridization.</b> However, no resistance genes have yet been cloned. In the present study, a progeny of the <b>somatic</b> <b>hybridization</b> with high BB resistance was crossed with a rice cultivar with high BB susceptibility to develop an F 2 population. Using bulked segregant analysis (BSA), 17 polymorphic markers that were linked to rice BB resistance were obtained through scanning a total of 186 simple sequence repeats (SSR) and sequence-tagged site (STS) markers, evenly distributed on 12 chromosomes. A genetic linkage map was then constructed based on the 17 linkage markers and the F 2 segregating population, which was followed by mapping for quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for BB resistance. Three QTLs were identified on chromosomes 1, 3 and 5, respectively, and the alleles of the resistant parent {{at any of the}} QTLs increased BB resistance. All of the three QTLs had a strong effect on resistance, explaining about 21. 5 %, 12. 3 % and 39. 2 % of the resistance variance, respectively. These QTLs were different from the loci of the BB resistance genes that have been identified in previous studies. The QTLs mapped in this work will facilitate the isolation of novel BB resistance genes and their utilization in rice resistance breeding...|$|E
40|$|Resistance to Alternaria {{blackspot}} {{disease is}} not known within the gene pool of oilseed rape. At present the only possibility to develop resistant cultivars is the transfer of resistances which were identified within related species. Eight putative resistance donors of the Brassicaceae family were tested {{with regard to their}} reaction towards different isolates of Alternaria brassicae and A. brassicicola, respectively. Whereas the genetics of resistance remain to be clarified for seven putative donor species in this study a monogenic dominant inheritance has been shown by intraspecific crosses of Diplotaxis erucoides. Sexual and <b>somatic</b> <b>hybridizations</b> were carried out between oilseed rape (Brassica napus) and four related species (B. elongata, Sinapis alba, D. tenuifolia and D. erucoides) showing different levels of blackspot resistance. The hybrid character of the offspring was determined using molecular markers, genomic in situ hybridization or chromosome counts. Using embryo rescue, backcross as well as selfing progenies were produced, and resistant genotypes were selected. Amongst all combinations, progenies originating from crosses between B. napus and D. erucoides showed the highest level of resistance. The changes of the genomic structure in the consecutive backcross generations were examined using genomic in situ hybridization. Resistant and fertile genotypes with only a few extra chromosomes from the donor species were identified and can be used in breeding programs to Alternaria resistance.

40|$|Cultivated {{and wild}} potato species {{synthesize}} {{a wide variety}} of steroidal glycoalkaloids (GAs). During breeding programs, species genomes are often put together through either sexual or <b>somatic</b> <b>hybridization.</b> Therefore, the determination of the GA composition of hybrids is very important in that it may affect either human consumption, or resistance to pathogen and pests. Here, we report the results of GA analysis performed on wild Solanum bulbocastanum, haploids of cultivated potato S. tuberosum and their interspecific somatic hybrids. GAs were extracted from tubers and analyzed by HPLC. HPLC Profile of S. tuberosum haploids showed, as expected, the presence of a-solanine and a-chaconine. The profile of S. bulbocastanum extract showed lack of a-solanine and a-chaconine, and the presence of four GAs. The GA pattern of the somatic hybrids was the sum of their parents profile. This represents a noteworthy tool for their unequivocal recognition. Interestingly, two hybrids produced not only GAs of both parents but also new compounds to be further investigated. This provided evidence that <b>somatic</b> <b>hybridization</b> induced the synthesis of new metabolites. The nature of the probable unidentified GAs associated to S. bulbocastanum and its somatic hybrids was ascertained by chemical degradation and spectroscopic analysis of their aglycones and sugar moieties. Our results suggest their close relation with GAs of both wild and cultivated potato species...|$|E
40|$|Summary Unlike {{maternal}} inheritance in sexual hybridiza-tion, plant <b>somatic</b> <b>hybridization</b> allows transfer, mixing and recombination of cytoplasmic genomes. In {{addition to the}} use of <b>somatic</b> <b>hybridization</b> in plant breeding programs, applica-tion of this unique tool should lead {{to a better understanding of}} the roles played by the chloroplastic and mitochondrial genomes in determining agronomically important traits. The nucleotide sequences of cytoplasmic genomes are much more conserved than those of nuclear genomes. Cytoplasmic DNA composition in somatic hybrids is commonly elucidated either by length polymorphism analysis of restricted genome regions amplified with universal primers (PCR-RF) or by hybridiza-tion of total DNA using universal cytoplasmic probes. In this study, we demonstrate that single-stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis is a powerful, quick and easy alternative method for cytoplasmic DNA characterization of somatic hybrids, especially for mitochondrial DNA. The tech-nique allows detection of polymorphisms based on both size and sequence of amplified targets. Twenty-two species of the subfamily Aurantioideae were analyzed with eight universal primers (four from chloroplastic and four from mitochondrial regions). Differences in chloroplastic DNA composition were scored in 98 % of all possible two-parent combinations, and dif-ferent mitochondrial DNA profiles were found in 87 % of them. Analysis by SSCP was also successfully used to characterize somatic hybrids and cybrids obtained by fusion of Citrus sinensis (L.) Osb. and C. excelsa Wester protoplasts...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study we show that {{malignant}} human papillomavirus (HPV) -positive cells lost their ability to synthesize endogenous beta interferon (IFN-β) upon tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) treatment. IFN-β transcription, however, was reinducible in nonmalignant HPV-positive cells, which was confirmed in functional protection assays against encephalomyocarditis virus or vesicular stomatitis virus infections. Addition of neutralizing antibodies against IFN-β blocked the antiviral effect, excluding the possibility that other IFN types were involved. Conversely, both malignant and immortalized cells could be protected against viral cytolysis when either IFN-β, IFN-α, or IFN-γ was added exogenously. This indicates that only the cross talk between TNF-α and the IFN-β pathways, and not IFN-α/β and IFN-γ signaling in general, is perturbed in cervical carcinoma cells. Notably, full virus protection was restricted exclusively to nonmalignant cells, indicating that the antiviral effect correlates with the growth-inhibitory and virus-suppressive properties of TNF-α. The IFN-regulatory factors IRF- 1 and p 48 (ISGF 3 γ) emerged as key regulatory molecules in the differential IFN-β response, since their transcription was either absent or only inefficiently enhanced in tumorigenic cells upon treatment with TNF-α. Inducibility of both genes, however, became reestablished in cervical carcinoma cells, which were complemented to nontumorigenicity after <b>somatic</b> cell <b>hybridization.</b> Complementation was paralleled by the entire reconstitution of cytokine-mediated IFN-β expression {{and the ability of}} TNF-α to exert an antiviral state. In contrast, under conditions where tumor suppression was not accomplished upon <b>somatic</b> cell <b>hybridization,</b> neither expression of IRF- 1, p 48, and IFN-β nor antiviral activity could be restored...|$|R
40|$|The ES- 2 {{esterase}} is a kidney-associated esterase and {{is expressed}} in a cloned mouse renal adenocarcinoma cell line. <b>Somatic</b> cell <b>hybridization</b> of the mouse renal adenocarcinoma with either mouse or human fibroblasts leads to the marked reduction of ES- 2 esterase titer. The extinction of ES- 2 esterase activity in mouse×human hybrids is reversible. Extinction correlates {{with the presence of}} the human C 10 chromosome in the somatic cell hybrids; whereas reexpression of the ES- 2 esterase is observed in hybrids which have lost C 10.

40|$|Abstract Background High {{molecular}} weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) have been {{proved to be}} mostly correlated with the processing quality of common wheat (Triticum aestivum). But wheat cultivars have limited number of high quality HMW-GS. However, novel HMW-GS {{were found to be}} present in many wheat asymmetric somatic hybrid introgression lines of common wheat/ Agropyron elongatum. Results To exploit how these new subunits were generated, we isolated HMW-GS genes from two sib hybrid lines (II- 12 and 11 - 4 - 6) and compared them with those from their parents. The result shows that two genes of hybrid (H 11 - 3 - 3 and H 11 - 4 - 3) are directly introgressed from the donor parent Agropyron elongatum; one hybrid gene (H 1 Dx 5) comes from point mutation of a parental wheat gene (1 Dx 2. 1); two other hybrid genes (H 1 By 8 and H 1 By 16) are likely resulting from unequal crossover or slippage of a parental wheat gene (1 By 9. 1); and the sixth novel hybrid gene (H 1 Dy 12) may come from recombination between two parental genes. Conclusion Therefore, we demonstrate that novel HMW-GS genes can be rapidly created through asymmetric <b>somatic</b> <b>hybridization</b> in a manner similar with the evolution mechanism of these genes supposed before. We also described gene shuffling as a new mechanism of novel HMW-GS gene formation in hybrids. The results suggest that asymmetric <b>somatic</b> <b>hybridization</b> is an important approach for widening HMW-GS genebank of wheat quality improvement. </p...|$|E

However, the mechanisms underlying these variations were unknown. In this study, 28 putative introgression lines (ILs) were pre-selected {{according to a}} series of morphological (leaf shape and color, plant height and branching, curd features, and flower traits) and physiological (black rot/club root resistance) characters. Multi-color fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed that these plants contained 18 chromosomes derived from ‘Korso’. Molecular marker (65 simple sequence repeats and 77 amplified fragment length polymorphisms) analysis identified the presence of ‘G 1 / 1 ’ DNA segments (average 7. 5 %). Additionally, DNA profiling revealed many genetic and epigenetic differences among the ILs, including sequence alterations, deletions, and variation in patterns of cytosine methylation. The frequency of fragments lost (5. 1 %) was significantly higher than presence of novel bands (1. 4 %), and the presence of fragments specific to B. carinata (BBCC 2 n = 34) were common (average 15. 5 %). Methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism analysis indicated that methylation changes were common and that hypermethylation (12. 4 %) was more frequent than hypomethylation (4. 8 %). Our results suggested that asymmetric <b>somatic</b> <b>hybridization</b> and alien DNA introgression induced genetic and epigenetic alterations. Thus, these ILs represent an important, novel germplasm resource for cauliflower improvement that can be mined for diverse traits of interest to breeders and researchers...|$|E
