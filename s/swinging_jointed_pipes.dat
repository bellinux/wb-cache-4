5|$|At the Canning Dam {{and indeed}} all dams, care {{had to be}} taken to prevent water seepage between the {{foundation}} rock and the structure of the dam. At the Canning in addition to cutting back the foundation to solid unfractured rock, a cut-off trench was sited near the upstream face of the dam, down stream which a rock filled drain containing open <b>jointed</b> <b>pipes</b> was provided to intercept any seepage between the rock face and the concrete of the dam. The inclusion of an internal drainage system was considered innovative at the period. Near vertical tubular 8 in (200mm) cut-off drains were provided at five-foot (1.52 m) intervals along the dam to relieve internal seepage through the concrete.|$|R
50|$|Coiled Tubing Drilling (CTD) {{has been}} used {{effectively}} for over 20 years {{in the oil industry}} and the technology has been evolving in order to meet changing industry demands. CTD takes the well-established concept of Coiled tubing and combines it with directional drilling using a mud motor to create a system for drilling reservoirs. Bottom hole assemblies (BHAs) are now able to drill directional, S-curve and horizontal wells and can be the key to unlocking reserves in mature oilfields via re-entry drilling. Coiled tubing drilling is known for its speed and ability to drill reservoirs in an underbalanced condition and CTD can reduce drilling times between 30%-60% compared with conventional <b>jointed</b> <b>pipe</b> drilling rigs. Therefore, CTD can provide significant economic benefits.|$|R

50|$|In {{the oil and}} gas industries, {{coiled tubing}} refers to a very long metal pipe, {{normally}} 1 to 3.25 in in diameter which is supplied spooled on a large reel. It is used for interventions in oil and gas wells and sometimes as production tubing in depleted gas wells. Coiled tubing is often used to carry out operations similar to wirelining. The main benefits over wireline are the ability to pump chemicals through the coil and the ability to push it into the hole rather than relying on gravity. Pumping can be fairly self-contained, almost a closed system, since the tube is continuous instead of <b>jointed</b> <b>pipe.</b> For offshore operations, the 'footprint' for a coiled tubing operation is generally larger than a wireline spread, which can limit the number of installations where coiled tubing can be performed and make the operation more costly. A coiled tubing operation is normally performed through the drilling derrick on the oil platform, which is used to support the surface equipment, although on platforms with no drilling facilities a self-supporting tower can be used instead. For coiled tubing operations on sub-sea wells a Mobile Offshore Drilling Unit (MODU) e.g. semi-submersible, Drillship etc. has to be utilized to support all the surface equipment and personnel, whereas wireline can be carried out from a smaller and cheaper intervention vessel. Onshore, they can be run using smaller service rigs, and for light operations a mobile self-contained coiled tubing rig can be used.|$|R
40|$|This article {{describes}} the failure analyses of a 302 ̆ 01 d-diameter cast iron main that failed suddenly at the bell 2 ̆ 013 spigot joint in Cleveland, Ohio in March 2008. The main had been operating largely without problems since its installation in 1880. The failure was analyzed using three models developed previously, each of which considered a specific failure mechanism candidate, namely (a) operational load or static analysis, (b) joint failure due to ground movement (settlement), and (c) fatigue failure. Operational load analysis clearly showed that while the factor of safety was significantly reduced {{in the presence of}} a concrete vault installed in 2002 just above the pipe, the margin of safety was still sufficient for the main to have performed safely. Ground movement analysis of the <b>jointed</b> <b>pipe</b> showed that the construction of the concrete vault above the joint of the 302 ̆ 01 d-cast iron main subjected the joint to rotation, which might have ultimately cracked the bell leading to failure. Under this circumstance, two failure scenarios are possible: namely, (a) additional rotation was large enough to cause the bell to split, or (b) additional rotation was sufficient to induce a minor crack in the bell but fatigue (repeated) loading caused the crack to grow over time until the combination of crack length and loading was sufficient to cause the bell to eventually split. The color differences along the fracture surfaces indicated that the fracture occurred in two distinct stages. This observation suggests that the second scenario is more plausible than the first.

40|$|Master thesis in Petroleum engineeringThe {{transient}} {{behavior of}} the bottomhole pressure during underbalanced drilling operations has been investigated. Focus has been on <b>jointed</b> <b>pipe</b> drilling with gas injection through the drill string. A description is made of a two‐phase drift‐flux model. The model has previously been developed in Matlab and is modeled to simulate the dynamic bottomhole pressure, during transient conditions in underbalanced operations. The original model only recognizes the slug flow regime and its corresponding slip parameters are implemented through the general slip law [29]. Extension {{has been made to}} the original model by including a model that distinguishes between bubble flow and slug flow, based on a simplified version of the suggestions made by Caetano [22]. Values for the slip parameters were chosen depending on existing flow pattern. For the transition zone, interpolation technique was used. The velocity profile coefficient for bubble flow was suggested to be 1. 0 by Caetano, however, as this made oscillations in the simulation results a value of 1. 1 was adapted, as proposed by Lage and Time [34]. Simulation runs of two‐phase flow in a vertical well were performed using the original model, the bubble slip parameters and the flow pattern dependent model. The results of the bubble flow model was compared to the original model, showing that after the unloading sequence, the bottomhole pressure was found to be 18. 3 % lower than for the original model. The unloading sequence was also found to last 47 % longer for the bubble flow model. The results gained from the flow pattern dependent model concluded that the slug flow region is the main flow regime during the simulation. However, until break through of gas during the unloading sequence, the bubble flow regime was found to be the primary flow pattern...|$|R
40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringManaged Pressure Drilling (MPD) is a {{relatively}} young technology that has improved some old ideas of Underbalanced Drilling (UBD). According to the IADC, MPD is an “adaptive process used to precisely control the annular pressure profile throughout the wellbore. The goal is to ascertain the downhole pressure environment limits and to manage the annular pressure profile accordingly”. In other words the main aim of MPD is to avoid continuous influx of formation fluids to the surface by maintaining a state of effective overbalance. It’s done by applying surface backpressure during drilling ahead or shut-in to make a connection of <b>jointed</b> <b>pipe.</b> Basic tools required to conduct MPD are: a rotating control device (RCD), drillstring non-return valves and dedicated choke manifold. MPD allows drilling through the un-drillable in conventional way formations, helps to reduce non productive time (NPT) and to overcome several drilling problems like: drilling with narrow “pressure window” and kick-loss scenarios caused by narrow margins, excessive casing program, low ROP, excessive mud cost caused {{by the loss of}} circulation, failure to reach TD with large enough hole diameter and shallow geohazards both with drilling riserless and with casing or marine riser. This technology enables manage pressures through the wellbore in more precise way than conventional drilling and there are several strong indicators that MPD in marine environments will be a breakthrough technology in offshore industry in the next years. It’s a big chance for MPD to be best solution for drilling in reservoirs with narrow pressure window, drilling with troublesome zones, depleted reservoirs, HP/HT reservoirs and to overcome almost all offshore drilling-related challenges. Therefore the main objective of this Master’s Thesis is to evaluate both technical and economical feasibility of using Managed Pressure Drilling technology from a floating drilling rig on the Skarv/Idun field on the NCS. Furthermore to show which MPD variation is most suitable on this field, equipment needed to conduct MPD operations, evaluates reservoir and drilling related benefits and assess which drilling problems can be avoided using Managed Pressure Drilling technology...|$|R
40|$|Full-scale {{tests have}} been carried out on lengths of {{unrestrained}} and restrained plain and <b>jointed</b> distribution <b>pipe</b> sections (similar to 4 '' or similar to 100 mm internal diameter) in order to investigate the strains and loads generated in cast iron water distribution mains as a result of temperature fluctuations. Tests on unrestrained sections enabled the coefficient of thermal expansion of the pipe material to be measured. In a fully restrained situation, which can occur in a pipe section in service when the joints are locked, tensile stresses arise from a decrease in temperature (in accordance with the predictions of a simple one-dimensional model) and it is shown that these stresses are sufficiently high to fracture a corroded pipe. In situations where the tensile stress leads to joint slippage, leakage through the joint is observed. Water leakage was also observed through the wall of corroded pipes that retained sufficient structural stability to carry load without failure...|$|R
2500|$|The Mason Bogie was still, though, {{plagued by}} one of the biggest {{problems}} of the Fairlie - the <b>jointed</b> steam <b>pipes</b> to the driven truck leaked far too much steam. Mason eventually changed to a different scheme, in which the pivot point for the leading truck became a hollow ball joint through which the live steam for the cylinders passed. [...] Mason also developed a sliding seal for the exhaust from the moving cylinder saddle into the smoke box. Although better, Mason's improvements took up much valuable space in between the driving wheels, forcing Mason to use an outside valve gear, generally the Walschaerts valve gear. Additionally, the reversing shaft had to be mounted atop the boiler, with a long lifting link dropping down to the radius rod, a feature unique to Mason Bogies (this was necessary because the lifting link would swing to the side as the truck pivoted, lifting the radius rod and changing the valve setting. [...] Lengthening the link, and thus increasing the radius of its swing, minimized the amount of change.).|$|R
50|$|Samuda's system {{involved}} a continuous (<b>jointed)</b> cast iron <b>pipe</b> laid between the rails of a railway track; the pipe had a {{slot in the}} top. The leading vehicle in a train was a piston carriage, which carried a piston inserted in the tube. It was held by a bracket system that passed through the slot, and the actual piston was on a pole ahead of {{the point at which}} the bracket left the slot. The slot was sealed from the atmosphere by a continuous leather flap that was opened immediately in advance of the piston bracket and closed again immediately behind it. A pumping station ahead of the train would pump air from the tube, and air pressure behind the piston would push it forward.|$|R
40|$|Bell split, {{in which}} a shard is {{separated}} from the bell end of a bell-spigot joint, is a predominant failure mode (in addition to longitudinal facture) that is observed in lead-caulked bell-spigot joints of large-diameter cast-iron pipes installed between 1850 and the early 1960 s. This paper addresses three specific issues related {{to this type of}} failure of lead-caulked bell-spigot joints: (1) the extent to which cast-iron pipe joints can rotate without inducing stress in the bell; (2) the behavior of the bell-spigot lead-caulked joints; and (3) an estimate of the degree of settlement that two or more contiguous segments of <b>jointed</b> cast-iron <b>pipe</b> can tolerate before failure. The procedures described in this paper were motivated by the need to understand and explain the circumstances that lead to this failure mode in large-diameter cast-iron pipes. A mechanistic model accounts for lead material nonlinearity, wet and dry joint conditions encountered in water and gas pipelines, respectively, and existence or absence of asphalt coating on the outer pipe surface. The model is validated against experimental tests conducted in the mid- 1930 s on lead-caulked bell-spigot joints and is subsequently used to develop another model to predict the cumulative joint response of two or more contiguous pipesegments resting on an elastic medium and subject to overburden pressure followed by ground movement. Illustrative analyses of 400 and 1, 200 mm diameter pipes clearly show that {{the extent to which a}} pipejoint can rotate without failure when subjected to ground movement gets smaller as the pipes become larger. The models developed in this paper to characterize joint behavior can be used to monitor pipe joint condition if actual joint rotations are measured when conducting pipe inspection 9 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

40|$|Soil-pipe {{interaction}} studies {{leading to}} the laboratory observations {{of the effects of}} differential ground movement between a heavy yielding structure and a pipeline firmly connected to it is presented in this paper. Such differential movements induce excessive stress concentrations on the pipeline. Plastics pipes fail as a consequence of such movements, though their flexibility should make them less vulnerable than rigid pipes. In order to evaluate the displacement, bending moment, shear force, vertical soil resistance at soil pipe interface under these conditions, innovative experimental techniques were developed and these are described in this paper. The soil resistance on a pipe section is characterised by the load-displacement behaviour of the embedded pipe section subjected to lateral displacement, vertical displacement, axial displacement along the axis of the pipe and rotation about the pipe axis. A mathematical analysis to complement the laboratory studies is developed and presented by treating the pipelines as a beam on elastic foundation. The magnitude and location of the maximum bending moments arising from yielding of the heavy structure is examined. The experimental observations of the behaviour of pipes subjected to such differential ground movement are compared with the results from the theoretical predictions. The provision of rocker pipe joints that entertain a permitted rotation helps to redistribute the adverse bending moments to acceptable levels and thereby alleviate distress in the pipeline. The paper gives results that demonstrate theoretically and experimentally the appropriateness of the use of flexibly <b>jointed</b> rocker <b>pipes</b> to prevent such failures. Field examples of the adoption of such joints is also presented and discussed culminating with the expression of the need for rational design procedures for pipeline foundations including rocker pipes to be incorporated into codes of practice such as EN 1295 is emphasised...|$|R
