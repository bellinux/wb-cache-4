Multiple parameters were set to determine this. The first <b>set</b> <b>parameter</b> observed interaction-mediated departures, which are defined as scenarios wherein one species leaves its position due {{to the arrival of}} a more dominant individual. The proportion of interaction-mediated departures was the lowest for V. mandarinia. Another measured parameter was attempted patch entry. Over the observed time, conspecifics (interactions with the same species) resulted in refused entry far more than heterospecifics (interactions with different species). Lastly, fights between these hornets, Pseudotorynorrhina japonica, Neopegoschkevitschii species, and Lethe sicelis were observed, and once more V. mandarinia was the most dominant species. In 57 separate fights, one loss was observed to Neopegoschkevitschii, giving V. mandarinia a win rate of 98.3%. Based on interaction-mediated departures, attempted patch entry, and interspecific fights, V. mandarinia is the most dominant species.|$|E

50|$|Through {{the use of}} the Test-Step List, one can model simple {{sequences}} of test steps that do not need to execute in parallel, such as setting signals (Set channel), ramping signals (Ramp channel), setting parameters (<b>Set</b> <b>parameter),</b> and waiting (Wait). Requests for the expected test results can be made within the test sequence to evaluate the system under test as it runs. It is also possible to place subautomatons in the Test-Step List, which in turn contain automatons and sequences, resulting in hierarchical Test-Step Lists. The test sequences can also be combined with other modelling methods, allowing for a great deal of complexity (or simplicity) in one's test. Test sequences can also be combined and parallelized with other modeling methods.|$|E
