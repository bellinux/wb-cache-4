Analyses show that the new continuum model follows traffic flow anisotropy principle, and the following insights can be gotten: (1) the bigger the difference of the preceding region representative <b>safe</b> <b>driving</b> awareness coefficient minus the following region representative <b>safe</b> <b>driving</b> awareness coefficient is, the less the probability of the wrong-way travel (the negative velocity) problem in the new continuum model is; (2) when the preceding region representative <b>safe</b> <b>driving</b> awareness coefficient {{is not less than}} the following region representative <b>safe</b> <b>driving</b> awareness coefficient, there is no wrong-way travel problem in the new continuum model, and vice versa...|$|R

40|$|By {{the year}} 2030 it is {{estimated}} that one in five licensed drivers in the United States will be over the age of 65. Driving allows engagement in the community for shopping, banking, maintaining social connections, and accessing health care. However, age-related decline can impact many of the cognitive processes and physical abilities necessary for <b>safe</b> <b>driving</b> performance. Exercise has beneficial effects on specific cognitive processes and physical function, many of which are related to <b>safe</b> <b>driving</b> performance. Tai Chi exercise is known to benefit cognitive and physical function and may influence <b>safe</b> <b>driving</b> performance. The aims of this observational study were to: 1) examine relationships between Tai Chi exercise habits, cognitive processes and physical function related to <b>safe</b> <b>driving</b> performance, 2) compare cognitive processes and physical function related to <b>safe</b> <b>driving</b> performance to normative reference values, and 3) explore potential predictors of <b>safe</b> <b>driving</b> performance. Fifty-eight current Tai Chi practitioners (mean age = 72. 9), with a median of greater than three years of Tai Chi practice were recruited from community Tai Chi classes and Tai Chi events. Participants completed a study packet describing self-reported Tai Chi and non-Tai Chi exercise habits, driving habits, self-report measures of dispositional mindfulness (Mindful Attention Awareness Scale, MAAS) and overall well-being (Vitality Plus Scale, VPS), personal history, and health history. Investigator-administered study measures included the DrivingHealth InventoryTM, digit span tests, the Driving Scenes Test, and the Right Foot Tapping test. Statistically significant correlations were found between several study measures. Compared to normative reference values participants performed better on several cognitive and physical measures, and on the MAAS and the VPS measures. Small to large effect sizes were calculated. The strongest predictor of <b>safe</b> <b>driving</b> performance was the digit span backward. Tai Chi exercise has the potential to positively impact cognitive processes and physical function related to <b>safe</b> <b>driving</b> performance through aerobic exercise mechanisms, development of mindfulness, and beneficial influence on overall vitality. The results of this study support the need for further investigation of Tai Chi exercise as a strategy to maintain <b>safe</b> <b>driving</b> performance in older adults...|$|R

40|$|The {{combination}} of continuously-acting high level controllers and control allocation techniques allows various <b>driving</b> <b>modes</b> {{to be made}} available to the driver. The <b>driving</b> <b>modes</b> modify the fundamental vehicle performance characteristics including the understeer characteristic and also enable varying emphasis to be placed on aspects such as tire slip and energy efficiency. In this study, control and wheel torque allocation techniques are used to produce three <b>driving</b> <b>modes.</b> Using simulation of an empirically validated model that incorporates the dynamics of the electric powertrains, the vehicle performance, longitudinal slip and power utilization during straight-ahead driving and cornering maneuvers under the different <b>driving</b> <b>modes</b> are compared. The three <b>driving</b> <b>modes</b> enable significant changes to the vehicle behavior to be induced, allowing the responsiveness of the car to the steering wheel inputs and the lateral acceleration limits to be varied according to the selected <b>driving</b> <b>mode.</b> Furthermore, the different <b>driving</b> <b>modes</b> {{have a significant impact on}} the longitudinal tire slip, the motor power losses and the total power utilization. The control and wheel torque allocation methods do not rely on complex and computationally demanding online optimization schemes and can thus be practically implemented on real fully electric vehicles.

Thirteen empirical studies reporting associations between cognitive, sensory, motor and physical factors and either self-reported crashes, state crash records or on-road driving measures were identified. Measures of attention, reaction time, memory, executive function, mental status, visual function, and physical function variables were associated with driving outcome measures. Self-monitoring was also identified as a factor that may moderate observed effects by influencing driving behavior. We propose that three enabling factors (cognition, sensory function and physical function/medical conditions) predict driving ability, but that accurate self-monitoring of these enabling factors is required for <b>safe</b> <b>driving</b> behaviour...|$|R

There {{is a lack of}} empirical evidence to confirm these claims for <b>safe</b> occupational <b>driving.</b> This phenomenological study attempted to fill this knowledge gap in the electric utility industry where employees must drive in all weather conditions to restore power to customers. The conceptual framework for the study was based on leadership and motivation theories of Burns and Maslow. The research questions explored the influence of (a) TL on <b>safe</b> <b>driving</b> performance improvement in organizations and (b) emotional intelligence (EI) on leaders 2 ̆ 7 efficiency to improve <b>safe</b> <b>driving</b> performance in organizations. These questions were addressed using a 14 -item in-depth, open-ended interview questionnaire by a convenience sample of 18 management and 12 union-represented personnel drawn from 5 U.

The findings suggested that (a) TL influenced <b>safe</b> <b>driving</b> performance through these leaders 2 ̆ 7 idealized influence, inspirational motivation, and intellectual stimulation; and (b) EI ineffectively and unreliably influenced <b>safe</b> <b>driving</b> improvement, but it improved organizational trust through the leaders 2 ̆ 7 empathy and drivers 2 ̆ 7 empowerment.

40|$|The primary {{function}} of navigation {{system is to}} provide route search and road guidance for <b>safe</b> <b>driving</b> for drivers. However, the existing route search system provides a simple service that looks up the shortest route using a <b>safe</b> <b>driving</b> DB without considering different road characteristics {{for the safety of}} the drivers. In order to maintain the <b>safe</b> <b>driving,</b> rather than searching the shortest path, a navigation system, in which the danger areas and/or the dangerous time zones have been considered, is required. Therefore, in this paper we propose a strategy of searching a navigation path to avoid danger areas for <b>safe</b> <b>driving</b> by using the A * algorithm. In the strategy, when evaluating the path-specific fitness of the navigation nodes, different heuristic weights were assigned to different types of risk areas. In particular, we considered three kinds of danger areas, such as accident-prone sections where accidents occur frequently, school zones, and intersection regions, as well as the time slots when the probability of danger is high. From computer simulation, the results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can provide the way to avoid danger areas on the route searching an...|$|R
