A week later she gives a talk on William Dean Howells for the Arch√© club. She closes out February with a talk on Whistler.

5000|$|The Judge {{noted that}} some people in Norfolk were opposed to the law, and chided her for 'the indiscreet freedom with which you <b>spoke</b> of the <b>colored</b> race in general'. 'Such {{opinions}} I regard as manifestly mischievous.' he said. The Church officials, he said, were allowed to instruct the children because religious instruction is necessary for black people. Black literacy, however, is dangerous. He described the law as a [...] "matter of self-defense against Northern anti-slavery agitators who clog the mail with anti-slavery pamphlets. to be distributed among Southern Negroes to induce them to cut our throats," [...] and who [...] "scattered pocket handkerchiefs around with anti-slavery engravings to work upon the feelings and ignorance of our negroes, who otherwise would remain comfortable and happy". He also admonished her for speaking directly and honestly in her own defense instead of hiring an attorney, which would have allowed her case to have been presented in a [...] "far more favorable light'. Her 'bold and open opposition', he said, [...] "is a matter not to be slightly regarded' and [...] "something more substantial is required in this case" [...] " ...|$|R

6000|$|We {{asked him}} what he thought, of Mr. Gibson's {{practice}} of coloring his statues, and he quietly and slyly said that he himself had made wax figures in his earlier days, but had left off making them now. In short, he objected to the practice wholly, and said that a letter of his on the subject had been published in the London [...] "Athenaeum," [...] and had given great offence to some of Mr. Gibson's friends. It appeared to me, however, that his arguments did not apply quite fairly to the case, for he seems to think Gibson aims at producing an illusion of life in the statue, whereas I think his object is merely to give warmth and softness to the snowy marble, and so bring it a little nearer to our hearts and sympathies. Even so far, nevertheless, I doubt whether the practice is defensible, and I was glad to see that Powers scorned, at all events, the argument drawn from the use of color by the antique sculptors, on which Gibson relies so much. It might almost be implied, from the contemptuous way in which Powers <b>spoke</b> of <b>color,</b> that he considers it an impertinence on the face of visible nature, and would rather the world had been made without it; for he said that everything in intellect or feeling can be expressed as perfectly, or more so, by the sculptor in colorless marble, as by the painter with all the resources of his palette. I asked him whether he could model the face of Beatrice Cenci from Guido's picture so as to retain the subtle expression, and he said he could, for that the expression depended entirely on the drawing, [...] "the picture being a badly colored thing." [...] I inquired whether he could model a blush, and he said [...] "Yes"; and that he had once proposed to an artist to express a blush in marble, if he would express it in picture. On consideration, I believe one to be as impossible as the other; the life and reality of the blush being in its tremulousness, coming and going. It is lost in a settled red just as much as in a settled paleness, and neither the sculptor nor painter can do more than represent the circumstances of attitude and expression that accompany the blush. There {{was a great deal of}} truth in what Powers said about this matter of color, and in one of our interminable New England winters it ought to comfort us to think how little necessity there is for any hue but that of the snow.|$|R
