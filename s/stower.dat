2500|$|The {{buddy system}} is {{expected}} to provide a level of redundancy within the pair of divers, as a safety backup in case of any equipment failure. Within the overall buddy pair almost all equipment {{can be seen as}} part of a combined [...] "redundant system": two tanks, two depth gauges/ dive computers, two lights, two knives or line-cutters, – even two brains. During the dive the measurement instruments (gauges, dive computers, compass etc.) are available to cross check one another, a second set of life support equipment (i.e. gas supply) is there as a backup in case of a failure in one of the divers' systems. [...] Sometimes a single special-purpose but non-critical piece of equipment is shared by the buddy team, like a single deployable surface marker buoy on which to ascend and mark the team’s position or a single underwater metal detector. [...] The one key thing however, that a buddy team always shares together is a dive plan - and the responsibilities of executing it. [...] A key principle drummed into scuba divers is “plan the dive and dive the plan”. [...] Before a dive a buddy team agree on a plan, which aside from the basic parameters of the dive itself – e.g. [...] depth, course, time, who leads and who follows, - [...] also includes the objectives of the dive: is it general sightseeing, is it the way the divers intend to view a wreck, is it photography, is it hunting a type of game. In technical diving these objectives often become much more complex and very specific – penetration of a particular part of a cave to a particular point. Many diving objectives require allocation of specific roles and responsibilities. [...] For example, in lobster hunting on the west coast of America, buddy teams often split into the assigned roles of hunter and game-catcher, and <b>stower</b> and catchbag-carrier, and the overall dive success is highly dependent on the teamwork of the buddies carrying out their assigned roles.|$|E
