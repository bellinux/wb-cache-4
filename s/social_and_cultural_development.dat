25|$|In February 2007 the {{government}} unveiled its new buyback-contract formula, which significantly extended {{the length of}} the contracts to as long as 20 years. The buy-back scheme is a formula used by the Iranian government to attract foreign investment. Following the end of the Iran–Iraq War in 1988, Iran faced a major problem: it needed foreign investment if it did not want to lose its vital income from the oil and gas industry, yet its revolutionary ideology and Constitution forbid granting “concessions”. A compromise solution was found in 1989 with the First Five-Year Economic, <b>Social</b> <b>and</b> <b>Cultural</b> <b>Development</b> Plan. Under Note 29 of the said plan, the Iranian government is allowed to employ “buybacks” in its effort to meet the industrial and mineral needs in connection with exports, production and investment. Put in laymen terms, a buy-back transaction is a method of trade where plants, machinery, production equipment and technology is supplied (by a domestic or foreign private firm), in exchange for the goods that will be produced directly or indirectly by means of such facilities.|$|E

2500|$|It {{should be}} noted that {{contrary}} to popular perception, self-determination does not necessarily imply secession, separate nationhood, or even autonomy. [...] It simply refers to the right of all peoples to freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>development.</b> The exercise of this right can result in a variety of outcomes, ranging from political independence to full integration within an existing state.|$|E

2500|$|Kidder, Jennings, and Shook {{referred}} to Kaminaljuyu's artifacts {{as representative of}} {{what they called a}} [...] "Middle Culture" [...] which they believed represented the earliest phase of complex <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>development</b> in Mesoamerica. This reflected their conclusion about the great antiquity of developments at Kaminaljuyu and their belief that Kaminaljuyu was primordial for its cultural and social innovations. Since their work, investigations chiefly undertaken by scholars from the New World Archaeological Foundation on the southern Pacific coast of Mexico have greatly altered this view, deepening in time the incipience of complex social and cultural events in Mesoamerica. Cultures of this phase had a stable agricultural community organized probably as a simple chiefdom.|$|E

2500|$|This conference {{contained}} Tzigara' artistic credo: {{he believed}} that art was an objective reflection of <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>development,</b> identifying the Westernization process, the proclamation of the 1881 Kingdom and later events with a profound transformation of Romania. However, Tzigara suggested, these efforts did not yet find a suitable answer in the artistic field, that is {{the birth of a}} specifically Romanian art phenomenon and the proper conservation of artistic legacies: he deplored the destruction of old Bucharest townhouses and their replacement with Westernized villas; he commended the restoration of Horezu Monastery in its original Brâncovenesc style, but criticized those who introduced Gothic revival elements at Tismana, Bistrița or Arnota; lastly, he expressed support for the [...] "healthy" [...] Neo-Brâncovenesc style of Ion Mincu and criticized muralist Octavian Smigelschi for his work on the Sibiu Cathedral. The conference included ample praise of Carol I as a patron of conservation, and nods in the direction of Carol's French architect, André Lecomte du Nouÿ.|$|E
2500|$|On September 23, Montreal and Toronto mayors Gérald Tremblay and David Miller {{laid out}} their demands for urban municipalities, {{describing}} cities' current financial problems {{as a national}} issue, saying that cities have become the country's economic, <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>development</b> engines and need appropriate support, and that they need better [...] "fiscal tools" [...] to continue their role as Canada's economic engines or the country will suffer. They listed Homelessness, traffic gridlock, crowded buses and overstretched police departments as {{just a few of}} the symptoms, that [...] "These problems are too big and too important to be solved on the backs of property taxpayers" [...] and that [...] "in order to remain competitive, transport goods efficiently and attract new talent, our cities require quality infrastructure, affordable housing and first-rate recreational and cultural facilities". Jean Perrault, president of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities and mayor of Sherbrooke, Quebec, has stated that things like the Federal Gas Tax Fund were an important federal commitment, but that more is needed to tackle cities' overwhelming infrastructure needs.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to the {{formation}} of the Malaysia, two commissions of enquiry visited North Borneo, along with neighbouring Sarawak, to establish the state of public opinion there regarding merger with Malaya (and Singapore). The commission was mandated to address self-determination of the people of Sabah, i.e., {{the right of the people}} of Sabah to freely determine their own political status and freely pursue their own economic, <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>development.</b> The first commission, usually known as the Cobbold Commission was established by the Malayan and British governments and was headed by Lord Cobbold, along with two representatives of Malaya and Britain (but neither of the territories under investigation). The Commission found that 'About one third of the population of each territory [...] strongly favours early realisation of Malaysia without too much concern over terms and conditions. Another third, many of them favourable to the Malaysia project, ask, with varying degrees of emphasis, for conditions and safeguards. The remaining third is divided between those who insist upon independence before Malaysia is considered and those who would strongly prefer to see British rule continue for some years to come'. The Commission published its report on 1 August 1962 and had made several recommendations. Unlike in Singapore, however, no referendum was ever conducted in North Borneo and Sarawak.|$|E
