5|$|G. juniperina subsp. juniperina – is {{endemic to}} Western Sydney, {{restricted}} to clay soils from Blacktown west to Penrith and Marsden Park and north to Pitt Town. It {{is listed as}} a vulnerable species on Schedule 2 of the Threatened <b>Species</b> <b>Conservation</b> Act 1995 in New South Wales. Its habitat is threatened by housing development, road upgrading, inappropriate fire regimes, weed invasion, rubbish dumping and trampling either by people or cars. It grows as a spreading shrub that is 0.5–1.5m (1.5–5ft) high.|$|E
5|$|The {{numbers of}} green and golden bell frogs are {{estimated}} to have declined by more than 30% in the past 10 years. It is listed as globally and nationally vulnerable, and as endangered under the New South Wales Threatened <b>Species</b> <b>Conservation</b> Act, 1995. Although it is only classified as vulnerable at national level, the National Frog Action Plan classifies the green and golden bell frog as endangered. In contrast to Australia, the frogs are abundant in New Zealand and classified as feral and unprotected.|$|E
5|$|The California condor {{conservation}} project {{may be one}} of {{the most}} expensive <b>species</b> <b>conservation</b> projects in United States history, costing over $35million, including $20million in federal and state funding, since World War II. As of 2007 the annual cost for the condor conservation program was around $2.0 million per year. However, nesting milestones have been recently reached by the reintroduced condors. In 2003, the first nestling fledged in the wild since 1981. In March 2006, a pair of California condors, released by Ventana Wildlife Society, attempted to nest in a hollow tree near Big Sur, California. This was the first time in more than 100 years that a pair of California condors had been seen nesting in Northern California.|$|E

5|$|Other hunting traditions then follow, again {{rooted in}} religion. The warriors of the Kuru tribe in Africa commit a sacred act {{in which they}} copulate with the ground in belief that it will make the Earth fertile and produce animals for the hunt, and a stag hunt in France, rooted in ancient pagan beliefs of the Gauls, is blessed by a mass before the hunt takes place, during which the hunters and dogs chase and {{ultimately}} kill a fleeing stag. In a fox hunt, the Wild Fox Association sabotages the hunting efforts by serving wine laced with a laxative to the hunters and distracting the dogs with an Afghan bitch in heat. Their efforts are then connected to <b>species</b> <b>conservation,</b> and to exemplify that hunters are truly concerned in wildlife conservation, Argentine hunters capture an Andean condor to sell to a zoo. A collage of other conservation efforts is shown, including the tagging of white rhinoceroses, grizzly bears and elephants, which are shot with morphine darts. Argentinian deer and elephant seals are physically subdued and marked. Tourists on Africans safaris then come to view the conservation efforts, which the narrator claims to have seemingly negated the animals' violent instincts. This deception is demonstrated with the mauling of a tourist named Pit Dernitz by lions.|$|E
5|$|The {{turquoise}} parrot {{was once}} common across the Sydney region, and particularly abundant between the localities of Parramatta and Penrith. It dramatically declined in numbers between 1875 and 1895, although rare sightings in western Sydney and the Blue Mountains {{were recorded in}} the mid-twentieth century. The turquoise parrot was trapped for the aviary trade and used as pie-filling. Almost all of its preferred habitat, the Cumberland Plain, across western Sydney, had disappeared with development. Over half the woodland in New South Wales, and 80% across Australia has been cleared, and the remaining habitat is fragmented. A key issue is removal of mature eucalypts with resulting loss of hollows available for nesting. The species is thus listed as a Vulnerable species under Schedule 2 of the New South Wales Threatened <b>Species</b> <b>Conservation</b> Act, 1995 because of habitat destruction (TSC Act). Fire-burning regimes may be resulting in the regeneration favouring shrubs rather than grasses, which are the preferred food source for the species. Feral cats and foxes are a threat, particularly to nesting birds and young.|$|E

40|$|Southern Nevada’s unique {{landscapes and}} landforms provide habitat for a {{diversity}} of plant and wildlife <b>species</b> of <b>conservation</b> concern including many locally and regionally endemic species. The high population density and urbanization of the Las Vegas metro-politan area {{is the source of}} many local and regional stressors that affect these species and their habitats: nitrogen deposition; solar and wind energy and water development; recreation, insects and disease; livestock, wild horse, burro, and elk grazing; invasive species; and altered fire regimes. Global stressors also affect these species and include climate change and CO 2 enrichment.

30|$|When {{defining}} LoCs, it {{is necessary}} to differentiate between <b>species</b> of <b>conservation</b> concern and those species that are considered ‘common’ in the agro-environment. Common species are considered to be widely distributed, to occupy different habitats and to have large population sizes [58]. <b>Species</b> of <b>conservation</b> concern may be either protected by EU law, nationally or regionally. However, species occurring in and adjacent to agro-ecosystems may be rare, endangered or threatened without being protected by a regulatory act [59, 60]. Many of these species are covered by Red Lists, either regionally, nationally, at EU level [61] or even globally [62]. Consequently, the level of protection or endangerment may not be uniform across the EU and individual Member States may not accept an EU-wide threshold for environmental harm (the LoCEU-wide) for a particular <b>species</b> of <b>conservation</b> concern.|$|R
40|$|Results of the odonatological {{survey in}} the Neretva River Basin in South Herzegovinakarst region of Bosnia and Herzegovina {{conducted}} from April to August 2013 are presented. The area had been pre-assessed as insufficiently known {{in term of}} its Odonata fauna, but believed to be important habitat for several <b>species</b> of <b>conservation</b> concern, particularly Coenagrion ornatum, Ceriagrion tenellum, Caliaeschna microstigma, Lindenia tetraphylla and Cordulegaster heros. Moreover, freshwater habitats of the region are increasingly threatened due to climate change and the habitat destruction due to infrastructure and hydroenergy production projects. The focus {{of the study was}} set on the streams and rivers in Neretva, Trebižat, Trebišnjica and Bregava river valleys, Hutovo blato wetland, Mostarsko blato, Dabarsko and Fatničko polje. The survey resulted in 482 Odonata records of 49 species from 52 surveyed localities. Notable results include new distribution data on <b>species</b> of <b>conservation</b> concern, particularly six new localities of C. ornatum, nine of C. microstigma and five of C. heros.

25|$|Limited {{historical}} {{information is available}} on frogs in Yanga National Park, but historical and recent surveys have recorded a total of 12 species of frogs from three families within the park. This includes the southern bell frog (Litoria raniformis) which is listed as endangered under the Threatened <b>Species</b> <b>Conservation</b> Act. The southern bell frog was once widespread and abundant throughout south-eastern Australia, but since the early 1980s its population and distribution {{have been reduced to}} a critical level. As there is limited historical and frog information from this area, it is not known when the southern bell frog populations began to decline within the area. However, it has been identified that the southern bell frog is vulnerable to habitat loss, fragmentation and degradation, altered flooding regimes, drought, predation by introduced fish and predation by other introduced species such as feral pigs and foxes.|$|E
