25|$|The loss of {{red blood}} cell {{elasticity}} {{is central to the}} pathophysiology of sickle-cell disease. Normal {{red blood cell}}s are quite elastic, which allows the cells to deform to pass through capillaries. In sickle-cell disease, low oxygen tension promotes red blood cell <b>sickling</b> and repeated episodes of <b>sickling</b> damage the cell membrane and decrease the cell's elasticity. These cells fail to return to normal shape when normal oxygen tension is restored. As a consequence, these rigid blood cells are unable to deform as they pass through narrow capillaries, leading to vessel occlusion and ischaemia.|$|E

25|$|Sometimes sports {{injuries}} can be {{so severe}} that they lead to death. In 2010 48 youths died from sports injuries. The leading causes of death in youth sports are sudden cardiac arrest, concussion, heat illness and external <b>sickling.</b> Cardiac-related deaths are usually due to an undiagnosed cardiovascular disorder.

25|$|An {{example of}} a harmful {{mutation}} is sickle-cell disease, a blood disorder in which the body produces an abnormal type of the oxygen-carrying substance hemoglobin in the red blood cells. One-third of all indigenous inhabitants of Sub-Saharan Africa carry the gene, because, in areas where malaria is common, there is a survival value in carrying only a single sickle-cell gene (sickle cell trait).

25|$|One of the {{earliest}} clinical manifestations is dactylitis, presenting as early as six months of age, and may occur in children with sickle-cell trait. The crisis can last up to a month. Another recognised type of sickle crisis, acute chest syndrome, is characterised by fever, chest pain, difficulty breathing, and pulmonary infiltrate on a chest X-ray. Given that pneumonia and <b>sickling</b> in the lung can both produce these symptoms, the patient is treated for both conditions. It can be triggered by painful crisis, respiratory infection, bone-marrow embolisation, or possibly by atelectasis, opiate administration, or surgery. Hematopoietic ulcers may also occur.|$|E

Injuries can result from improper technique, poorly fitting pointe shoes, and lack of effective cushioning and accessories. Some types of injuries are prevented by adhering to proper technique such as correct upper-body positioning, maintaining straight knees when required, keeping body weight centered over the box of the shoes, and avoiding <b>sickling.</b> Problems dealing with technique can be easily fixed by proper training and one-on-one interactions with the dance instructor to improve the dancer's technique.|$|E

2500|$|Immediately after observing Dr. Adams' 12-hour autopsy, Dr. Baden said, [...] "Preliminary {{findings}} indicate {{the boy did}} not die from <b>sickle</b> cell trait, nor did he die from natural causes." [...] Dr. Baden has said repeatedly that <b>sickle</b> trait by itself does not cause death. [...] He explained a [...] "sickle cell crisis" [...] is a <b>sickle</b> cell disease—not the same as <b>sickle</b> cell trait. [...] By itself, the <b>sickle</b> cell trait is not harmful.

40|$|The {{response}} of <b>sickle</b> cells with varying water content to alterations in oxygen tension has been studied. Cells that were severely dehydrated while <b>sickled</b> retained the characteristic <b>sickled</b> morphology even after prolonged reoxygenation. When the cell water content was increased {{by reduction of}} the suspending medium osmolality, the cells unsickled. Cells that were dehydrated before deoxygenation were unable to assume the spiculated morphology typical of sicked cells. This was true both for high mean cell hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) discoid <b>sickle</b> cells and for irreversibly <b>sickled</b> cells. When such cells were resuspended in hypotonic medium before deoxygenation, they <b>sickled</b> with the characteristic morphology of <b>sickle</b> cells with normal MCHC. The morphological behavior of Ca-loaded <b>sickled</b> cells as well as irreversibly <b>sickled</b> cells showed a major influence of increased hemoglobin concentration and extremely high internal viscosity.

50|$|<b>Sickle</b> cell {{genes of}} African origin have been {{detected}} in Europe, mostly in the Mediterranean region. The <b>sickle</b> cell trait is associated with resistance to malaria. Individuals with one copy of the <b>sickle</b> cell gene, heterozygotes, have higher resistance to malaria than individuals with no <b>sickle</b> cell genes. In regions affected by malaria, the fertility of <b>sickle</b> cell heterozygotes will be higher than average. Individuals with two copies of the <b>sickle</b> cell gene, homozygotes, {{will be affected by}} <b>sickle</b> cell disease and historically have had lower than average fertility. The <b>sickle</b> cell trait is thus an example of heterozygote advantage which is subject to balancing selection. When the <b>sickle</b> cell trait is introduced into a region affected by malaria, balancing selection will, on one hand, act to increase the frequency of the trait to counter malaria. On the other hand, if the frequency of the trait in the population becomes high enough so that homozygotes with <b>sickle</b> cell disease become common, balancing selection will act to limit the spread of the trait. Therefore, in regions affected by malaria, the <b>sickle</b> cell trait is maintained at intermediate frequencies relative to the incidence of malaria.|$|R

The risk of sudden death in boot camp environments for people with sickle trait has long been recognized in military services.

40|$|Increased {{leukocyte}} adhesion to {{vascular endothelium}} contributes to vaso-occlusion in <b>sickle</b> cell disease. Since nitric oxide bioavailability is decreased in <b>sickle</b> cell disease and nitric oxide may inhibit leukocyte adhesion, we investigated whether stimulation of NO-signaling pathways {{can reduce the}} adhesive properties of neutrophils from <b>sickle</b> cell disease individuals (<b>sickle</b> cell diseaseneu). <b>sickle</b> cell diseaseneu presented greater adhesion in vitro to both fibronectin and ICAM- 1 than control neutrophils. Co-incubation of <b>sickle</b> cell diseaseneu with the nitric oxide-donor agents, sodium nitroprusside and dietheylamine NONOate (DEANO), and the guanylate cyclase stimulator, BAY 41 - 2272, all significantly reduced the increased adhesion to fibronectin/ICAM- 1. Oxadiazolo[4, 3 -a]quinoxalin- 1 -one, a guanylate cyclase inhibitor, reversed sodium nitroprusside/DEANO-diminished adhesion to fibronectin, implicating cGMP-dependent signaling in this mechanism. Interestingly, intracellular cGMP was significantly higher in neutrophils from <b>sickle</b> cell disease individuals on hydroxyurea (<b>sickle</b> cell diseaseHUneu). Accordingly, <b>sickle</b> cell diseaseHUneu adhesion to fibronectin/ICAM- 1 was significantly {{lower than that of}} <b>sickle</b> cell diseaseneu.

2500|$|In people {{heterozygous}} for HgbS (carriers of <b>sickling</b> haemoglobin), the polymerisation {{problems are}} minor, because the normal allele {{is able to}} produce over 50% of the haemoglobin. In people homozygous for HgbS, the presence of long-chain polymers of HbS distort {{the shape of the}} red blood cell from a smooth doughnut-like shape to ragged and full of spikes, making it fragile and susceptible to breaking within capillaries. [...] Carriers have symptoms only if they are deprived of oxygen (for example, while climbing a mountain) or while severely dehydrated. The sickle-cell disease occurs when the sixth amino acid, glutamic acid, is replaced by valine to change its structure and function; as such, sickle-cell anemia is also known as E6V. Valine is hydrophobic, causing the haemoglobin to collapse on itself occasionally. The structure is not changed otherwise. When enough haemoglobin collapses on itself the red blood cells become sickle-shaped.|$|E
