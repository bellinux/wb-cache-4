Considering the coupling effects caused by a mass eccentricity, the static balance condition and measure sequence for each gimbal axis are obtained. A novel <b>static</b> <b>unbalance</b> test approach is proposed after analyzing the dynamic model of the measured gimbal axis. This approach is to drive the measured gimbal axis to do sinusoidal reciprocating motion in a small angle and collect its drive currents in real time. Then the <b>static</b> <b>unbalance</b> of the measured gimbal axis can be obtained by the current multi-cycle integration. Also a measuring system using the proposed approach has been developed. A balanced simulator is used to verify the proposed approach by the load and repeatability tests.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, a {{new type}} of {{vibration}} structure (i. e. swing frame) of vertical dynamic balancing machine is designed, which is based on the analysis of traditional double-plane vertical dynamic balancing machine’s swing frame. The <b>static</b> <b>unbalance</b> and couple unbalance can be separated effectively by using the new dynamic balancing machine with the new swing frame. The modal and harmonic responses are analyzed by using the ANSYS 7. 0. By comparing the finite element modal analysis with the experimental modal analysis, the natural frequencies and vibration modes are found out, which can provide the dynamics direction for designing vertical dynamic balancing machine. The new dynamic balancing machine can measure <b>static</b> <b>unbalance</b> and couple unbalance directly, and the influence between them is faint. The practical result indicates that the new vertical dynamic balancing machine is suitable for inertial measurement of flying objects, and can overcome the shortcomings of traditional double-plane vertical dynamic balancing machines, in which the effect of plane-separation is inferior. The vertical dynamic balancing machine with the new vibration structure can be widely used in the future application...|$|E

40|$|Reaction {{wheels are}} {{rotating}} devices {{used for the}} attitude control of spacecraft. However, reaction wheels also generate undesired disturbances {{in the form of}} vibrations, which may have an adverse effect on the pointing accuracy and stability of spacecraft (optical) payloads. A disturbance model for reaction wheels was developed at Moog Bradford by combining empirical and theoretical models. The empirical data is obtained from a highly accurate reaction wheel characterization test setup from the European Space Agency and includes disturbance signals of ball bearings transmitted through the structures of the reaction wheel assembly. The theoretical model is derived from the equation of motion of a rigid rotor and a disc supported by two ball bearings including <b>static,</b> dynamic <b>unbalances,</b> structural modes and gyroscopic effects of the wheel rotor. To fully model the disturbance signature of the wheel, the bearing stiffness is formulated as a function of ball pass frequency and the flexibility of the supporting structural items like the reaction wheels housing are included. Finally, the empirical model is added into the theoretical model as excitations to form a full disturbance model for reaction wheels. The resulting combined model is then validated by tests on different types of Moog Bradford reaction wheels. The validated disturbance model is used to evaluate the pointing performance of spacecraft as well as to predict micro-disturbance performance for future reaction wheel designs...|$|R
40|$|PaperPg. 113 - 129. Rotor {{unbalance}} {{remains one}} of the leading causes of deterioration and vibration of rotating machinery; but, if physical weight corrections can be made, many machines can be successfully balanced in-place with considerable savings in downtime and labor costs. In-place balancing can, however, pose some unique problems, and a prime concern is the time, expense, and wear and tear to simply start and stop the machine for trial data. Therefore, this paper is presented to provide guidelines for recognizing and overcoming some of the more common in-place balancing problems so that the number of balance runs can be kept to a minimum. Vibration analysis techniques are presented as the first step to verify that the problem is truly unbalance and not looseness, weakness, distortion, resonance, misalignment, eccentricity, or other problems which could be mistaken for unbalance. Problems such as repeatability, rotor sag, stratification, thermal distortion, load effects, rotor speed and other variables which can influence rotor balance are discussed. Measurement techniques and common sources of measurement error are also presented. The importance of identifying the type of rotor <b>unbalance</b> (<b>static,</b> couple, quasi-static, or dynamic) is presented along with a review of common single- and two-plane balancing procedures with emphasis on their suitability for in-place balancing.

40|$|Disturbances in {{reaction}} wheels have been long a crucial aspect for many scientific observation missions. An accurate and reliable disturbance model {{to understand and}} evaluate the influence of reaction wheel disturbances to the spacecraft is critically needed. Several reaction wheel disturbance models have been developed over time, using both empirical and theoretical approaches [1][2]. These models are able to capture the main features of disturbances such as ball bearing vibrations, unbalance of the rotor and the resonances of the structures. However, because the disturbance measurement equipment was limited in both stiffness and sensitivity, the empirical model output was not effective. In addition, the empirical model algorithm did not include structural resonances. This paper presents an improved disturbances measurement process and a reliable disturbance model by combining an empirical and a theoretical disturbance model. The empirical model is obtained from several wheel types (18 Nms – 45 Nms) at Moog-Bradford using a microvibration test based on a dedicated reaction wheel characterization table at ESA. With {{the state of the}} art micro-vibration test facility, the empirical data has a good accuracy to be used to derive an empirical model. The empirical model also includes the transmissibility of vibration sources through up to two wheel structural resonances in all six disturbance forces and moments. The theoretical disturbance model is derived from the equation of motion of a rigid rotor and disc supported by two ball bearings. This model formulates the <b>static</b> and dynamic <b>unbalances</b> of the wheel and the structural modes including gyroscopic effects of the rotor. Finally, the vibrations from ball bearings, which were obtained by the empirical model, are added to the theoretical model to form a combined disturbance model.

In this paper we present a methodology of using artificial neural networks (ANN) and frequency-domain vibration analysis to detect and classify common types of unbalances in rotating machines.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This research work involved the prediction of the fatigue life of an automotive rear suspension twistbeam assembly fitted to a vehicle travelling over a customer correlated durability route. This was achieved by making use of the integrated concepts of scaling and superposition of linear static finite element analysis being driven by experimental load data - the so called 'quasi-static time domain' approach. A study of the free body diagram of the twistbeam resulted in an indeterminate load set of some 24 components, with experimental data indicating that a state of <b>static</b> <b>unbalance</b> existed. Subsequent to developing a matrix-based generalised method ofload cell calibration to confum the foregoing, a modal technique was developed to partition the experimental data into a static load set, causing elastic deformations, and a rigid load set, imparting rigid body accelerations. The semi-independent characteristics of the twistbeam necessitated the coupling of large structural displacements with inertia relief. This required extensive modifications to the current techniques {{and led to the}} development and use of a three dimensional functional response matrix in place of the conventional two dimensional one. Recommendations concerning appropriate finite element boundary conditions were also formulated to handle these effects. Finally, the limitations of the uniaxial fatigue model were revealed under the application of a set of tools for analysing the biaxiality and mobility of the maximum absolute principal stress...|$|E

40|$|Design for {{prevention}} of aeroelastic instability (that is, the critical speeds leading to aeroelastic instability lie outside the operating range) {{is an integral}} part of the wing design process. Availability of the sensitivity derivatives of the various critical speeds with respect to shape parameters of the wing could be very useful to a designer in the initial design phase, when several design changes are made and the shape of the final configuration is not yet frozen. These derivatives are also indispensable for a gradient-based optimization with aeroelastic constraints. In this study, flutter characteristic of a typical section in subsonic compressible flow is examined using a state-space unsteady aerodynamic representation. The sensitivity of the flutter speed of the typical section with respect to its mass and stiffness parameters, namely, mass ratio, <b>static</b> <b>unbalance,</b> radius of gyration, bending frequency, and torsional frequency is calculated analytically. A strip theory formulation is newly developed to represent the unsteady aerodynamic forces on a wing. This is coupled with an equivalent plate structural model and solved as an eigenvalue problem to determine the critical speed of the wing. Flutter analysis of the wing is also carried out using a lifting-surface subsonic kernel function aerodynamic theory (FAST) and an equivalent plate structural model. Finite element modeling of the wing is done using NASTRAN so that wing structures made of spars and ribs and top and bottom wing skins could be analyzed. The free vibration modes of the wing obtained from NASTRAN are input into FAST to compute the flutter speed. An equivalent plate model which incorporates first-order shear deformation theory is then examined so it can be used to model thick wings, where shear deformations are important. The sensitivity of natural frequencies to changes in shape parameters is obtained using ADIFOR.

40|$|In a {{previous}} paper, the dynamic behaviour of a Jeffcott rotor was {{studied in the}} presence of pure <b>static</b> <b>unbalance</b> and nonlinear elastic restoring forces. The present paper extends the analysis to a rigid rotor with an axial length such as to make the transverse moment of inertia greater than the axial one. As in the previous investigation, the elastic restoring forces are assumed to be nonlinear and the effects of couple unbalance are also included but, unlike the Jeffcott rotor, the system exhibits six degrees-of-freedom. The Lagrangian coordinates were fixed so as to coincide with the three coordinates of the centre of mass of the rotor and the three angular coordinates needed in order to express the rotor''s rotations with respect to a reference frame having its origin in the centre of mass. The precession motions of such a rotor turn out to be cylindrical at low angular speeds and exhibit a conical aspect when operating at higher speeds. The motion equations of the rotor were written with reference to a system that was subsequently adopted for the experimental analysis. The particular feature of this system was the use of a steel wire (piano wire) for the rotor shaft, suitably constrained and with the possibility of regulating the tension of the wire itself, in order to increase or reduce the nonlinear character of the system. The numerical analysis performed with integration of the motion equations made it possible to point out that chaotic solutions were manifested only when the tension in the wire was given the lowest values – i. e. when the system was strongly nonlinear – {{in the presence of}} considerable damping and rotor unbalance values that were so high as to lose any practical significance. Under conditions commonly shared by analogous real systems characterised by poor damping, where the contribution to nonlinearity is almost entirely due to elastic restoring forces, the analysis pointed out that precession motions may be manifested with a periodic character, whether synchronous or not, or a quasi-periodic character, but in no case is the solution chaotic...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} work presents series of {{investigations into the}} structural, dynamic and aeroelastic behaviour of composite wings. The study begins with a literature review where the development of aeroelastic tailoring and specific applications of the technology are discussed in detail. A critique of methods for the determination of cross-sectional rigidity properties follows for beams constructed of laminated and thin-walled materials. Chordwise stiffness is shown {{to be an important}} parameter that must be considered as it has a significant effect on the amount of bending-torsion coupling present in a beam and, as a consequence, on the value of torsional rigidity. The free vibration characteristics of such beams are then examined using the dynamic stiffness matrix method. Natural frequencies and mode shapes of various beams are studied using the fibre angle, (3, and the bending-torsion coupling which is measured (in this study) by the non-dimensional parameter 'If, as design variables. The results show that 'If has only a marginal effect on the natural frequencies of composite beams (wings) but can significantly modify the mode shapes of such beams. It can be used to decouple modes which are geometrically (inertially) coupled {{in the same way as}} mass balancing but without a weight penalty. It can also be used to abate the unfavourable coupling introduced by sweep angle. Classical flutter and divergence of swept and unswept uniform cantilever wings are investigated using laminated flat beams (plates) and thin-walled beams of rectangular and biconvex cross-sections. Various parameters, such as, the fibre angle, (3, the coupling parameter, 'If, the angle of sweep, A, the <b>static</b> <b>unbalance,</b> xu, and the non-dimensional ratio of the fundamental (uncoupled) bending to fundamental torsional frequency, ffih/ffiu, are varied and their subsequent effects on aeroelastic stability are investigated. The importance of torsional rigidity GJ on the flutter of composite wings is shown to be substantial in contrast with 'If, which is generally the most important parameter to be considered when the objective is that of increasing the divergence speed. Modal interchanges in the free vibration and flutter of laminated composite wings are shown to be primarily responsible for behaviour not experienced with metallic wings, in particular the effect of wash-in and wash-out on flutter. The most intriguing features of these investigations, however, are those which show that models adequate for the analysis of composite wings may be based on two parameters, the frequency ratio ffih/ffiu and the coupling parameter If/. Some results are confirmed by independent optimisation studies. Finally, a preliminary investigation is carried out into the flutter suppression and gust alleviation of a laminated composite wing by the use of active controls. The results show that by using an active control in an optimum trailing edge position the gust response of a wing can be significantly alleviated without compromising the already optimised flutter speed by the use of aeroelastic tailorin...|$|E
