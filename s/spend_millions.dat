5|$|Discussions {{regarding}} a potential SANDAG {{purchase of the}} road began in October 2010. On July 29, 2011, SANDAG agreed to purchase the lease of the freeway from South Bay Expressway LLC; even though a study suggested that the agency might have to <b>spend</b> <b>millions</b> of dollars to maintain and repair parts of the highway. Objections raised to the purchase during the negotiation phase included needing a loan {{from the federal government}} of $1.5 million to complete the purchase, and a possible increase in traffic through Lemon Grove. The sale of the franchise rights until the year 2042 was finalized on December 16, 2011, at a price of $341.4 million, and $10.2 million in additional fees, with $254 million from TransNet sales tax revenue, some of it to be repaid with toll revenue. SANDAG claimed at the time that they would reduce the tolls to attract increased use and decrease traffic on I-805, which would mean that additional lanes would not need to be constructed on that route. Despite this, the operator decided to increase tolls instead even with the low demand for using the road; the San Diego Union-Tribune criticized the decision. in mid-2011, it cost $4 to drive the entire toll portion of the road.|$|E

25|$|In 1881, {{the newly}} crowned Russian Emperor Alexander III {{appointed}} Ivan Vsevolozhsky {{director of the}} St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres. In 1885 the new director prompted the inspection of the Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre by architects who found the building to be unsafe. Rather than <b>spend</b> <b>millions</b> of roubles on renovations, the director ordered that both the ballet and opera companies be relocated to the Imperial Mariinsky Theatre of St. Petersburg, much {{to the chagrin of}} the orchestra and opera singers who found the theatre's acoustics to be weaker. In honor of the relocation to the new theatre, a lavish gala performance was planned for February 1886, which included the Petipa/Minkus work Les Pilules magiques (The Magic Pills). The work included three danced tableaux: the first took place in a subterranean cave inhabited by sorceresses, while the second included various card games brought to life through dance. The third and final tableau was known as The Kingdom of the Laces in which a Grand divertissement of national dances from Belgium, England, Spain and Russia was performed.|$|E

25|$|The dynasty Erwin {{established}} in 1893 began to crumble in 1953 when Abney Mills acquired the Erwin Mill No. 1 and Erwin Mill No. 2 from the Duke family. Production and {{life at the}} mill remained {{the same as the}} city of Durham and Duke University sprouted up around aging factory. Employees continued to emerge victorious in the labor battle, signing new labor agreements in both 1956 and 1957, which prolonged the generous rights granted to workers in the prior decade. In 1962, the mill changed hands once again after Burlington Industries of Greensboro, North Carolina bought the mill and cut production in half. Working conditions, which had historically been above average, deteriorated during this period and were highlighted in a Duke Chronicle article that went as far as comparing the mill to a “concentration camp.” Burlington Industries had done little to spur production at the mill, and there was little reason to, as modern factories in Asia and Central America were cheaper to operate and therefore stole business than traditional textile mills. Burlington did, however, <b>spend</b> <b>millions</b> of dollars to make improvements to both of the mills. The final year of textile production at the original Erwin Mill was in 1986, after 103 years of operation.|$|E

Plants that are imported to Florida are subject to classification as [...] "Restricted" [...] or [...] "Prohibited", but a new designation is being considered [...] "Not Authorized Pending Plant Risk Analysis", to allow scientists to assess what damage exotic plants may cause to the South Florida environment. A nonproft organization named The Florida Exotic Pest Plant Council lists exotic species as belonging in Category I: [...] "altering native plant communities by displacing native species, changing community structures or ecological functions, or hybridizing with natives"; and Category II: [...] "increased in abundance or frequency but have not yet altered Florida plant communities to the extent shown by Category I". More than 100 species {{have been placed in}} Category I, but a few have been singled out for the potential to cause the most destruction based on how rapidly they reproduce, their displacement of native flora by crowding, shading, or fire, excellent adaptations to conditions in the Everglades, and the potential to spread (or evidence that they have spread) into remote areas of the Everglades.|$|E
