5000|$|In 1924, Western Electric {{had settled}} on 24 {{frames per second}} (90 feet per minute) as the {{standard}} film speed for both the sound-on-disc and optical sound systems it was developing. Western Electric's ERPI division dominated the theater hardware market when the sound revolution finally got underway, so its new standard speed was universally adopted by Fox {{and all the other}} studios as each began making sound films. (See the Fleischer cartoon Finding His Voice (1929), credited to Mr. W. E. Erpi.) As a consequence, Case's tests and DeForest's early Phonofilms, shot at about 21 frames per second, gave speakers and singers laughably high-pitched [...] "helium voices" [...] if they were run on a standard <b>sound</b> <b>projector.</b> The Library of Congress and other film archives have printed new copies of some early Phonofilms, modifying them by periodically duplicating frames and correspondingly [...] "stretching" [...] the soundtracks to make them compatible with standard projectors and telecine equipment.|$|E
50|$|After Joseph McNabb died in 1949, Percy {{was made}} the {{president}} of Bell & Howell. He was instrumental in leading the company {{during a period of}} financial success and growth. During his leadership, Percy expanded Bell & Howell, raising revenues 32-fold and the number of employees 12-fold, and listing the company on the New York Stock Exchange. While continuing to manufacture movie cameras and movie and <b>sound</b> <b>projectors</b> for military, commercial, and home use, in the late 1940s the company diversified into the production of microfilm. It later entered the rapidly expanding markets of information services as well.|$|R

5000|$|The Acousmonium is a {{specialised}} sound reinforcement system {{consisting of}} between 50 and 100 loudspeakers, {{depending on the}} character of the concert, of varying shape and size. The system was designed specifically for the concert presentation of musique-concrète-based works but with the added enhancement of sound spatialisation. Loudspeakers are placed both on stage and at positions throughout the performance space [...] and a mixing console is used to manipulate the placement of acousmatic material across the speaker array, using a performative technique known as sound diffusion [...] Bayle has commented {{that the purpose of the}} Acousmonium is to [...] "substitute a momentary classical disposition of sound making, which diffuses the sound from the circumference towards the centre of the hall, by a group of <b>sound</b> <b>projectors</b> which form an 'orchestration' of the acoustic image" [...]|$|R
5000|$|Some virtual {{surround}} systems work by {{directing a}} strong beam of sound to reflect {{off the walls}} of a room so that the listener hears the reflection at a higher level than the sound directly from the loudspeaker. One example of this technology is a commercially available http://www.cambridgemechatronics.com/technology/audioDigital <b>Sound</b> <b>Projector</b> by Cambridge Mechatronics (formerly 1 Ltd). It employs 40 micro drivers and 2 woofers as well as projection technology to control the direction of the sound. The micro drivers' sound is focused into groups of [...] "beams" [...] that reflect off the room's walls. The center channel's sound is projected directly to the listening position. Another example is S-Logic marketed by a German headphones manufacturer Ultrasone. With this technology (which may also be considered a hybrid of HRTF and reflection-based methods), decentralized transducer positioning is used to spread sound over the outer ear in an attempt to mimic sound heard over speakers.|$|E
50|$|The redoubt opened as a {{military}} museum in 1977, {{and is now the}} largest military museum in south east England. It contains military collections of The Royal Sussex Regiment, which moved to the museum in 1983, The Queen's Royal Irish Hussars (see also The Queen's Royal Hussars), which moved in 1988, Eastbourne Borough's Military Collection and the founding collection, the Sussex Combined Services. In addition the museum also features displays {{on the history of the}} redoubt and a number of temporary exhibitions and displays. Among the artefacts that the museum possesses and displays is General Hans-Jürgen von Arnim's Steyr Automobile 1500A Afrika Korps Staff Car, which the Royal Sussex Regiment captured in Tunisia in May 1943, a Russian bugle rescued from the ill-fated Charge of the Light Brigade, a uniform of the Desert Rats worn at the Battle of El Alamein in 1942, and a Gulf War camp of the Queen's Royal Irish Hussars. 2015's temporary exhibition, Treasure, explores what treasure can be and includes a 15th-century Book of Hours, 1940s <b>sound</b> <b>projector</b> (invented locally)and Roman Coin Horde recovered from Beachy Head.|$|E
50|$|Staff and {{students}} often {{worked together to}} build or improve college facilities during this period. Their work included formation of the Tom Graham Cricket Oval in 1931, and the 1930 relocation by students using horses and tractors, of a timber grandstand, erected in 1927 on a sports ground {{near the site of}} the present War Memorial Swimming Pool, to a more appropriate location overlooking the planned new oval. In the early 1930s the Gymnasium was lined with silky-oak and walnut milled and installed by students. In 1935 this building was extended in length, new dressing rooms were constructed either side of the re-erected stage, and the interior was lined to match the existing hall. Used variously as a gymnasium, theatre, cinema (a cinematograph projector was installed in 1927, and replaced by a Movietown <b>Sound</b> <b>Projector</b> in 1931), assembly hall, recreation hall, chapel, and currently as a lecture room, the building was re-located in 1978 to a site between the inner and outer ring roads on {{the western edge of the}} campus.|$|E

5000|$|Newark, New Jersey {{was among}} the first public school systems to {{incorporate}} <b>sound</b> movie <b>projectors</b> in their classrooms in 1930. During the early years, projectors were often sold with films initially, until the national total reached a thousand by 1936. Until many technical problems were fixed (the best 16mm projectors were manufactured after 1933), ERPI sold both 16mm and 35mm formats.|$|R
40|$|International {{audience}} 3 D movies {{provide an}} improved immersion {{in terms of}} visual perception. As for the associate audio channels, {{most of them are}} mixed for the conventional format of multichannel 5. 1 . It should be considered that today there are various ways of listening to 5. 1 audio content, either over loudspeaker arrays (for instance ITU standard 5. 1 set-up), or over headphones. Recently <b>sound</b> <b>projectors</b> were introduced, in order to render surround sound with compact equipments. The choice of the solution to render multichannel audio has obviously an impact on the perceived quality of the sound. In addition, this latter will also depend on whether a visual content is presented in combination with the audio content. This paper will re-examine these issues in the new context of 3 D video. The perceived quality of the spatial sound will be assessed by a listening test for a set of audiovisual excerpts of a 3 D movie...|$|R
40|$|Projecte final de carrera fet en col. laboració amb School of Electrical Engineering (KTH) For many years, the {{surround}} sound effect {{could only be}} fully experienced by setting up several speakers, which required considerable wiring for installation in a typical room. Digital sound projectors, {{one of the most}} sought-after state-of-the-art solutions, use an array of small speakers enclosed in a box to provide surround by creating virtual sound sources around the listener. This thesis presents a DSP implementation of a simple digital <b>sound</b> <b>projector</b> based on a uniform linear array of thirty loudspeakers. Surround is produced by controlling separate beams of sound. These are reflected off the walls and arrive at the listener’s position from the desired directions. Due to hardware constrains, the bandwidth of the sound is limited. In order to estimate the direction of the sound at the listener, two techniques based on estimating the time difference of arrival (TDOA), Classical Cross-Correlation (CC) and Cross-Correlation with the Source Signal (CSS), are compared. Objective test results show that the CSS technique is more robust than CC under noisy environments, while both techniques behave similarly in quiet conditions. Subjective and objective results show that this implementation of a <b>sound</b> <b>projector</b> is successful, even if front virtual channels are better perceived by the listener than the rear channels...|$|E
40|$|An exact {{study of}} {{radiation}} of an acoustic field due to radial/axial vibrations of a baffled cylindrical piston, eccentrically positioned within a fluid-filled thin cylindrical elastic shell, into an external fluid medium is presented. This configuration, {{which is a}} realistic idealization of a liquid-filled cylindrical acoustic lens with a focal point inside the lens when used as a <b>sound</b> <b>projector,</b> is of practical importance with a multitude of possible applications in underwater acoustics and ocean engineering. The formulation utilizes the appropriate wave field expansions along with the translational addition theorems for cylindrical wave functions to develop a closed-form solution {{in the form of}} an infinite series. Numerical results reveal the key effects of excitation frequency, cap angle, radiator position (eccentricity), dynamics of the elastic shell, and cap surface velocity distribution on sound radiation...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} cod, Gadus morkua (L.), and haddock, Melanogrammus aeglefinus (L.), to {{discriminate}} changes in sound direction and amplitude was studied using a cardiac conditioning technique. In one experiment {{it was found}} that the masking effect of noise transmitted from one <b>sound</b> <b>projector</b> on the ability of the fish to detect a tone (60 - 380 Hz) transmitted from another projector was reduced by 7 dB when the angle between the projectors was 450 or greater. It was also shown that the fish could be conditioned to a change in the direction of a pulsed tone switched between two projectors. The fish were able to discriminate changes in sound amplitude of 1 * 3 - 0 / 5 dB at frequencies between 50 and 380 Hz. The results are discussed in relation to sound localization in fish...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- An {{underwater}} <b>sound</b> <b>projector</b> {{has been}} recently developed for operation {{over a decade}} long frequency range. The output of the projector has been designed for 10 kHz to 100 kHz operation on an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The transducer is resonant at 100 kHz but {{has been designed to}} deliver high sound pressure levels without impedance or phase instabilities. The transducer features the f i rs t successful s tacking of 1 - 3 piezocomposite materials. The selection of the 1 - 3 piezocomposite materials has resulted in the mode-free sound output while the stacking arrangement permits acoustic operation with twice the sound output at half the resonance frequency of a single layer. The stacking is done mechanically in series and electrically in parallel with the center electrode as the positive plane. Furthermore, the center electrode has been segmented into four individual elements such that combinations of the sectors offer the ability to access nine different apertures. I...|$|E
40|$|As a {{consequence}} of pool drawdown each fall and winter to enhance flood storage, numerous fish are lost through the bottom sluices of Allegheny Reservoir (located on the western border of Pennsylvania and New York). The sudden release of pressure accompanying the passage of these fish from a deep zone of the reservoir into the tailrace {{can result in a}} substantial fish kill. The conditions under which fish are lost apparently are enhanced when the pool level is low and discharge is high. In an effort to reduce these losses, underwater broadcasts of recorded sound effects were tested. The <b>sound</b> <b>projector</b> was a low-frequency transducer mounted above the bottom sluices on the upstream face of the dam. While the sound broadcasts were being evaluated, the Corps of Engineers maintained a higher winter pool at the project to test the effect of controlled flow releases on ice formation at downriver locations. Although the underwater sound broadcasts were not effective, maintenance of a higher winter pool resulted in a marked reduction in the fish losses...|$|E
40|$|Laser {{consolidation}} (LC) is a {{computer-aided manufacturing}} process that builds a functional net-shape part {{directly from a}} CAD model, {{without the use of}} moulds or dies. The folded shell projector (FSP) is a compact flextensional underwater <b>sound</b> <b>projector</b> developed by DRDC-Atlantic for low frequency sonar applications. The radiating surface of the FSP is a thin-walled shell of complex shape that challenges conventional manufacturing technologies. In this study, several versions of the FSP were designed using DRDC-Atlantic's MAVART finite element code. NRC-IMTI refined the laser consolidation process and successfully manufactured the complex shells from IN- 625 and Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloys. The laser consolidated net-shape shells are metallurgically sound and exhibit excellent surface finish, dimensional accuracy and mechanical properties. Field tests of FSP prototypes demonstrated that the shells met their design goals of resonant frequency and source level. Other manufacturing methods for building the shells (hydro-forming and Ni vapor deposition) were also explored. However, at the moment, the laser consolidation process is the only manufacturing technology capable of making the FSP shell to the required tolerances. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E

5000|$|This period saw the {{development}} of active sonar (ASDIC) and its integration into a complete weapons system by the British, {{as well as the}} introduction of radar. During the period, there was a great advance due to the introduction of electronics for amplifying, processing, and displaying signals. In particular, the [...] "range recorder" [...] was a major step that provided a memory of target position. Because the propellers of many submarines were extremely loud in the water (though it doesn't seem so from the surface), range recorders were able to gage the distance from the U-boat by sound. This would allow mines or bombs around that area to be detonated. New materials for <b>sound</b> <b>projectors</b> were developed. Both the Royal Navy and the U.S. Navy fitted their destroyers with active sonars. In 1928, a small escort ship was designed and plans made to arm trawlers and to mass-produce ASDIC sets. Depth sounders were developed that allowed measurement by moving ships and an appreciation obtained of the properties of the ocean affecting sound propagation. The bathythermograph was invented in 1937, which was soon fitted to ASW ships.|$|R
