5|$|The underpowered engines {{made the}} fighter sluggish, and the hydro-skis {{were not as}} {{successful}} as hoped; they created violent vibration during takeoff and landing, despite the <b>shock-absorbing</b> oleo legs they were extended on. Work on the skis and legs improved this situation somewhat, but {{they were unable to}} resolve the sluggish performance. The Sea Dart proved incapable of supersonic speed in level flight with the J34 engines; not helping was its pre-area rule shape, which meant higher transonic drag.|$|E
5|$|Falls can {{be avoided}} by {{installing}} grab bars in bathrooms and handrails on stairways; removing tripping hazards such as throw rugs; or installing window guards and safety gates {{at the top and}} bottom of stairs around young children. Playgrounds with <b>shock-absorbing</b> surfaces such as mulch or sand also prevent head injuries. Child abuse prevention is another tactic; programs exist to prevent shaken baby syndrome by educating about the dangers of shaking children. Gun safety, including keeping guns unloaded and locked, is another preventative measure. Studies on the effect of laws that aim to control access to guns in the United States have been insufficient to determine their effectiveness preventing number of deaths or injuries.|$|E

25|$|The basic {{configuration}} {{was similar to}} earlier gliders such as the Stamer Lippisch Zögling and the Grunau IX, but the SG 38 was an entirely new design. Improvements included enlarged tail surfaces for better stability, a separate skid mounted on <b>shock-absorbing</b> springs, and an updated seat for the pilot.|$|E
25|$|The {{first factor}} is {{compression}} of the navicular bone under the DDF tendon {{and the back}} of the small pastern bone. Repeated compression in this area can cause cartilage degeneration, with the cartilage flattening and gradually becoming less springy and <b>shock-absorbing.</b> It may also begin to erode. Cartilage degeneration is common in navicular horses, usually along the flexor surface. This finding, and the associated biochemical changes, have led some researchers to conclude that there are elements in navicular disease common to osteoarthritis, and to suggest similar therapeutic regimes.|$|E

2500|$|The North American 2.5-litres were {{fundamentally}} different from their European counterparts. Due to federal regulations, some modifications were required. Most noticeable from the outside were the 'America' bumpers, with the typical rubber accordions in them. Furthermore, these bumpers had thick (and heavy) <b>shock-absorbing</b> material inside them and in addition, they were mounted to the vehicle on shock absorbers. To accommodate these shock absorbers, the 'America'-bodies were slightly different from the European ones. Other changes relative to the European model were: ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{features}} an egg-shaped crew capsule nicknamed the [...] "blast bucket". It is shaped to deflect blasts and bullets {{and act as}} a roll-cage if the vehicle flips. The four occupants sit back to back in a diamond arrangement {{so that they can}} see hazards from all directions, a suggestion from troops in the field. It also moves the occupants away from the wheels, which are typically what sets off a land mine. The Ultra AP includes race car technology from NASCAR engineers like multipoint safety harnesses and <b>shock-absorbing</b> seats mounted on Skydex, which is used to cushion the outfield walls of baseball stadiums. It also uses the latest in bulletproof glass and the newest light-weight armor technology.|$|E
2500|$|The match {{takes place}} on a thick rubber mat that is <b>shock-absorbing</b> to ensure safety. [...] A large outer circle between 32 and 42 feet in {{diameter}} that designates the wrestling area is marked on the mat. The circumference line of that circle is called the boundary line. The wrestling area {{is surrounded by a}} mat area or apron (or protection area) that is at least five inches in width that helps prevent serious injury. The mat area is designated by the use of contrasting colors or a [...] line, {{which is part of the}} wrestling area and included in bounds. The wrestlers are within bounds when any part of either wrestler is on or inside this boundary line.|$|E
2500|$|On 16 May 1977, New York Airways' {{commercial}} S-61-L, N619PA, {{suffered a}} static rollover onto its starboard {{side at the}} heliport {{on top of the}} Pan Am Building while boarding passengers. The accident killed four boarding passengers and one woman on the street. 17 additional passengers and the three flight crew members were uninjured. The landing gear collapse was a result of metal fatigue in the helicopter's main landing gear <b>shock-absorbing</b> strut assembly, which caused the helicopter to tip over without warning. The accident resulted in the permanent closure of the Pan Am Building heliport. [...] As the heliport was closed, the wreckage was removed by disassembling it and taking the assemblies down to street level using the building's freight elevators. The airframe was taken to Cape Town, South Africa, where it was rebuilt, certified and returned to service as the first S61 used in the Ship-Service Role off the shores of the Western Cape by the company [...] "Court Helicopter" [...] which was later amalgamated with CHC.|$|E
2500|$|Decking apart, the {{fuselage}} was a conventional spruce and plywood rectangular box structure, though wide at 42 in (1.066 m) {{even for a}} side-by-side seater. External longitudinal stiffeners ran along the sides. Access to the cabin was easy, with saloon car-type doors on either side and there was generous (10 cu ft or 0.92 m3) luggage space behind the seats. [...] Most flight controls were gathered on a central console, so that with double rudder bars and a T-shaped control column, the Bee could be flown from either seat. The cabin was glazed with Rhodoid (cellulose acetate). The main undercarriage wheels were {{in line with the}} wing leading edge, but largely within {{the fuselage}}, with only about 60% of the diameter showing below. Their <b>shock-absorbing</b> legs were also inside the fuselage. This arrangement had been used on very small aircraft such as the English Electric Wren, but it meant the Bee had a narrow undercarriage track despite some toe-out. At the rear, the fuselage extended below the rudder for ease of handling. The tailplane and tabbed elevators were {{on the top of the}} fuselage proper, so the elevators were split to allow rudder movement. Control surfaces were not balanced.|$|E
2500|$|The mat {{can be no}} {{thicker than}} four inches nor thinner than a mat with the <b>shock-absorbing</b> qualities of a [...] hair-felt mat. Inside the outer circle is usually an inner circle about 10 feet in diameter, {{designated}} {{by the use of}} contrasting colors or a [...] line, although this is no longer specified by the NCAA Wrestling Rules and Interpretations. Wrestlers are encouraged to stay {{near the center of the}} mat within the inner circle, or else they risk being penalized for stalling (that is, deliberately attempting to slow down the action of the match). Each wrestler begins action at one of two one-inch starting lines inside the inner circle that is three feet long. Two one-inch lines close the ends of the starting lines and are marked red for the wrestler from the visiting team and green for the wrestler from the home team. The two starting lines are 10inches apart from each other and form a rectangle in the middle of the wrestling area. This rectangle designates the starting positions for the three periods. Additional padding may be added under the mat to protect the wrestlers, especially if the wrestlers are competing on a concrete floor. All mats that are in sections are secured together.|$|E
2500|$|The Parachute Drop was {{patented}} by retired U.S. Naval Commander James H. Strong and Stanley Switlik, who {{were inspired by}} primitive parachute practice towers {{he had seen in}} the Soviet Union. [...] The Soviet Union had been using simple wooden towers to train paratroopers since the 1920s, and despite the dangers of the Soviet design, which used just a single guide cable and sometimes found the jumper colliding with the structure, the towers were employed for recreational use as well. Strong designed a safer version which included eight guide wires in a circle surrounding the parachute. In 1936, Strong secured a U.S. patent for his design, and he built several test platforms at his home in Hightstown, New Jersey in 1936 and 1937. The military platforms suspended a single rider in a harness and offered a few seconds of freefall after the release at the top, before the chutes opened to slow the fall. Civilians showed a great deal of interest in trying out the ride for themselves, and Strong was quick to turn his invention to non-military use as well, making some design changes in the process: a seat that could hold two, a larger parachute for a slower drop, the metal ring which held the parachute permanently open, and <b>shock-absorbing</b> springs to ease the final landing.|$|E
2500|$|Some riders {{ride with}} the stirrup more [...] "home," [...] or shoved toward the heel. This is seen {{most often in}} sports such as polo and eventing, where the speed and sudden changes of {{direction}} of the former, and the great change in terrain and solid fences of the latter, make the rider {{more likely to be}} jarred loose from the saddle and increases the risk of losing a stirrup. However, this placement actually puts the stirrup on the arch of the foot, in a weaker position that leads to tension in the leg, stiffness in the knee and decreases the flexibility of the ankle, and therefore the <b>shock-absorbing</b> ability of the rider; paradoxically increasing the risk of a fall. [...] Additionally, it increases the chance that the rider's foot will become stuck in the stirrup during a fall, a very dangerous situation. This placement is often counterproductive and should not be used if it is not an absolute necessity. [...] The [...] "home" [...] position has some value in saddle bronc riding, as a lost stirrup will almost inevitably result in the rider being thrown from the bucking horse, but because riders are thrown from the horse at a high rate even under normal circumstances, this event also has a high rate of riders being hung up in their stirrups and injured in the process.|$|E

50|$|While the Cub's {{engine was}} largely exposed, {{providing}} much drag, the Champ reduced drag by a cowling completely enclosing the engine. The Champ also provided gentler, <b>shock-absorbing</b> oleo-strut landing gear, countering the bouncy landings of the Cub's rubber-bungee suspension, while apparently offering less drag.|$|E
5000|$|As Captain America, he {{possesses}} the original, indestructible, vibranium alloy shield used by his predecessor, {{as well as}} a Kevlar/Nomex blend, <b>shock-absorbing</b> costume. He often carries several conventional weapons such as knives, guns - mostly a Colt 1911-A1 [...]45 and a P08 Luger - and grenades.|$|E

50|$|The Kurir has a fixed, {{tailwheel}} undercarriage. The two tall, long-stroke, <b>shock-absorbing</b> main legs {{mounted on}} the upper fuselage sides just forward of the cabin have supplementary bracing; each carries a wheel fitted with brakes. Alternatively, skis can be fitted. At least one was configured as a floatplane.|$|E

50|$|The basic Ka-115 {{is powered}} by a Pratt & Whitney Canada/Klimov PW206K/2 engine that drives a coaxial rotor system, {{equipped}} with rotor de-icing. The Ka-115 features a large five-door cabin with large windows and a skid undercarriage. The cabin is fitted with vibration and noise suppression, heating and ventilation systems, and comfortable <b>shock-absorbing</b> crew and passenger seats.|$|E
5000|$|The spines of {{sea urchins}} are {{composed}} of mesocrystals of calcite nano-crystals (92%) in a matrix of non-crystalline calcium carbonate (8%). This structure makes the spines hard but also <b>shock-absorbing,</b> which special property makes them effective defences against predators. [...] Mesocrystals also appear in the shells of some eggs, coral, chitin, and the shells of mussels.|$|E
50|$|Depending on {{a variety}} of factors (including weight, running surface and shoe durability), runners should replace their shoes every 300-700 miles to allow {{adequate}} mid-sole cushioning. A change in running surfaces can also help prevent stress fractures. However, it is also argued that cushioning in shoes actually causes more stress by reducing the body's natural <b>shock-absorbing</b> action, increasing the frequency of running injuries.|$|E
50|$|The Army Combat Boot (Hot Weather) (ACB (HW)) is a tan-colored, {{hot weather}} combat boot made with moisture-resistant, rough-side-out cattlehide leather and nylon duck upper with two {{drainage}} eyelets {{on the inner}} arch. The soling system of this boot consists of a <b>shock-absorbing</b> direct attach poly-ether polyurethane midsole, with an abrasion-resistant, slip-resistant rubber outsole. It has a combination eyelet and speed-lace lacing system.|$|E
5000|$|The 2007 Mitsubishi Lancer {{is built}} around Mitsubishi’s {{next-generation}} RISE unibody design (GS platform). The RISE body structure disperses energy loads during side and rear crashes and controls distortion, enhancing occupant protection and also protecting the fuel system during a rear impact. The highly rigid structure makes extensive use of high-tension steel. It features straight [...] "front side members" [...] with an octagonal [...] "cross-section" [...] and a three-leg support structure, as well as increased application of both high-strength (590Mpa) and ultra-high strength (980MPa) steel. Compared to the previous-generation Lancer, torsional rigidity has been increased by 56 percent, and bending rigidity is up by 50 percent. The side pillars, roof joints and cross-car structure increase collision protection. A collapsible front chassis crossmember and a device to help prevent brake-pedal retraction during a collision contribute to better impact energy management. The pedestrian impact protection has also been increased, with new <b>shock-absorbing</b> hood, cowl and fender structures and <b>shock-absorbing</b> hood hinges.|$|E
50|$|Unlike adult bikes, children's trikes do {{not always}} have {{pneumatic}} tires, having instead wheels of solid rubber or hollow plastic. While this may add to {{the weight of the}} tricycle and reduces the <b>shock-absorbing</b> qualities, it eliminates the possibility of punctures. Pull brakes are rarely fitted to front-drive trikes, but the child can slow the trike down by resisting the forward motion through the pedals.|$|E
5000|$|The A-3 was {{originally}} {{powered by a}} [...] M-11 five-cylinder air-cooled radial engine. On later models this {{was replaced by a}} [...] AI-14R radial mounted on a <b>shock-absorbing</b> tubular frame. A removable cowling covers the oil tank and pipes for the lubrication system. The twin fuel tanks are concealed within the hull {{on either side of the}} cabin. Fuel caps are located in wells in the deck.|$|E
50|$|For light {{aircraft}} {{a type of}} landing gear which is economical to produce is a simple wooden arch laminated from ash, as used on some homebuilt aircraft. A similar arched gear is often formed from spring steel. The Cessna Airmaster {{was among the first}} aircraft to use spring steel landing gear. The main advantage of such gear is that no other <b>shock-absorbing</b> device is needed; the deflecting leaf provides the shock absorption.|$|E
50|$|The 500 series design {{features}} <b>shock-absorbing</b> landing skid struts, a turboshaft engine mounted at a 45-degree angle {{toward the rear}} of the cabin pod, a fuel tank cell under the floor and the battery in the nose. The engine exhaust port is located {{at the end of the}} cabin pod underneath the tailboom. It has a short-diameter main rotor system and a short tail, giving it agile control response and is less susceptible to weather-cocking.|$|E
5000|$|The Motor Wheel had a 2 {{cycle engine}} which {{produced}} 1HP {{and had two}} flywheel magnetos, bronze bearings and a float feed carburetor. The complete kit came with a wheel, hub tire, <b>shock-absorbing</b> spring sprocket holder, wheel sprocket and chain, handlebar controls for choke, throttle and engine shutoff, three quart gas tank and gas line, and all necessary fittings to adapt the engine and rear wheel unit to any 26" [...] bicycle.|$|E
50|$|The JG.10 had fixed, {{conventional}} landing gear, its mainwheels on bent axles with rearward drag struts, all {{hinged to}} the central fuselage underside. Vertical oleo struts from {{the ends of the}} axles were attached to the forward wing spars; the track was 3.0 m. A vertical tube extending from the extreme rear of the fuselage carried a small castering tailwheel below a <b>shock-absorbing</b> spring. The end of the extension was supported by a small V-strut to the lower fuselage.|$|E
