2500|$|According to Lassalle, wages cannot {{fall below}} <b>subsistence</b> <b>wage</b> level because without subsistence, laborers {{will be unable}} to work. [...] However, {{competition}} among laborers for employment will drive wages down to this minimal level. This follows from Malthus' demographic theory, according to which population rises when wages are above the [...] "subsistence wage" [...] and falls when wages are below subsistence. Assuming the demand for labor to be a given monotonically decreasing function of the real wage rate, the theory then predicted that, in the long-run equilibrium of the system, labor supply (i.e. population) will rise or fall to the number of workers needed at the <b>subsistence</b> <b>wage.</b>|$|E
2500|$|As English {{political}} economist David Ricardo noticed, {{this prediction}} {{would not come}} true {{as long as a}} new investment, technology, or some other factor causes the demand for labor to increase faster than population: in that case, both real wages and population would increase over time. The demographic transition (a transition from high birth and death rates to low birth and death rates as a country industrializes) changed this dynamic in most of the developed world, leading to wages much higher than the <b>subsistence</b> <b>wage.</b> [...] Even in countries which still have rapidly expanding populations, the need for skilled labor in certain occupations causes some wages to rise much faster than in others.|$|E
60|$|Now {{this society}} is the direct {{product of an}} organic necessity, impelling every member of it to {{a course of action}} which tends to the good of the whole. Each bee has its duty and none [25] has any rights. Whether bees are {{susceptible}} of feeling and capable of thought is a question which cannot be dogmatically answered. As a pious opinion, I am disposed to deny them more than the merest rudiments of consciousness.* But it is curious to reflect that a thoughtful drone (workers and queens would have no leisure for speculation) with a turn for ethical philosophy, must needs profess himself an intuitive moralist of the purest water. He would point out, with perfect justice, that the devotion of the workers to a life of ceaseless toil for a mere <b>subsistence</b> <b>wage,</b> cannot be accounted for either by enlightened selfishness, or by any other sort of utilitarian motives; since these bees begin to work, without experience or reflection, as they emerge from the cell in which they are hatched. Plainly, an eternal and immutable principle, innate in each bee, can alone account for the phenomena. On the other hand, the biologist, who traces out all the extant stages of gradation between solitary and hive bees, as clearly sees in the latter, simply the perfection of an automatic mechanism, hammered out by the blows of the struggle for existence upon the progeny of the former, during long ages of constant variation.|$|E

2500|$|The Poor Law Commissioners' Report of 1834 {{called the}} Speenhamland System a [...] "universal system of pauperism". The system allowed employers, {{including}} farmers and the nascent industrialists of the town, to pay below <b>subsistence</b> <b>wages,</b> because the parish {{would make up}} the difference and keep their workers alive. So the workers' low income was unchanged and the poor rate contributors subsidised the farmers.|$|R
6000|$|At the {{opposite}} pole {{of the social}} scale to that about which shareholding is most apparent, is a second necessary and quite inevitable consequence of the sudden transition that has occurred from a very nearly static social organization to a violently progressive one. This second consequence of progress is {{the appearance of a}} great number of people without either property or any evident function in the social organism. This new ingredient is most apparent in the towns, it is frequently spoken of as the Urban Poor, but its characteristic traits are to be found also in the rural districts. For the most part its individuals are either criminal, immoral, parasitic in more or less irregular ways upon the more successful classes, or labouring, at something less than a regular bare <b>subsistence</b> <b>wage,</b> in a finally hopeless competition against machinery that is as yet not so cheap as their toil. It is, to borrow a popular phrase, the [...] "submerged" [...] portion of the social body, a leaderless, aimless multitude, a multitude of people drifting down towards the abyss. Essentially it consists of people who have failed to [...] "catch on" [...] to the altered necessities the development of mechanism has brought about, they are people thrown out of employment by machinery, thrown out of employment by the escape of industries along some newly opened line of communication to some remote part of the world, or born under circumstances that give them no opportunity of entering the world of active work. Into this welter of machine-superseded toil there topples the non-adaptable residue of every changing trade; its members marry and are given in marriage, and it is recruited by the spendthrifts, weaklings, and failures of every superior class.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not a penny," [...] replied Trefusis for him promptly. [...] "A man {{cannot be}} a Christian in this country. I have tried it {{and found it}} {{impossible}} both in law and in fact. I am a capitalist and a landholder. I have railway shares, mining shares, building shares, bank shares, and stock of most kinds; and a great trouble they are to me. But these shares do not represent wealth actually in existence; they are a mortgage on the labor of unborn generations of laborers, who must work to keep me and mine in idleness and luxury. If I sold them, would the mortgage be cancelled and the unborn generations released from its thrall? No. It would only pass {{into the hands of}} some other capitalist, and the working class would be no better off for my self-sacrifice. Sir Charles cannot obey the command of Christ; I defy him to do it. Let him give his land for a public park; only the richer classes will have leisure to enjoy it. Plant it at the very doors of the poor, so that they may at last breathe its air, and it will raise the value of the neighboring houses and drive the poor away. Let him endow a school for the poor, like Eton or Christ's Hospital, and the rich will take it for their own children as they do in the two instances I have named. Sir Charles does not want to minister to poverty, but to abolish it. No matter how much you give to the poor, everything except a bare <b>subsistence</b> <b>wage</b> will be taken from them again by force. All talk of practicing Christianity, or even bare justice, is at present mere waste of words. How can you justly reward the laborer when you cannot ascertain the value of what he makes, owing to the prevalent custom of stealing it? I know this by experience. I wanted to pay a just price for my wife's tomb, but I could not find out its value, and never shall. The principle on which we farm out our national industry to private marauders, who recompense themselves by black-mail, so corrupts and paralyzes us that we cannot be honest even when we want to. And the reason we bear it so calmly is that very few of us really want to." ...|$|E

At its most extreme, workers are in [...] "debt bondage": they must work to pay off a debt at such punitive interest rates that it may never be paid off.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss the impact of {{malnutrition}} {{on the distribution of}} abilities and income in a simple overlapping generations framework. Workers are distributed uniformly over a low-ability and a high-ability range. If workers earn below <b>subsistence</b> <b>wages,</b> the probability that their children will have low abilities is higher than with above <b>subsistence</b> <b>wages</b> due to the malnutrition resulting from low incomes. Using a nested Ethier production function we find that there is an optimal share of low-ability workers in the economy which maximizes output. Due to the intergenerational propagation of low abilities resulting from malnutrition, economies may however get trapped in sub-optimal equilibria with too large shares of low-ability workers. Distributing food coupons financed by taxes of the parent generation to the offspring of these low-ability workers will increase the likelihood that they will be in the high-ability range, permanently increasing output for future generations. Using a numerical example, we show that this type of redistributive policy is welfare improving if the parent generation alive during the initiation of the policy is reimbursed for their loss in utility due to taxes. ...|$|R

50|$|From a Marxist perspective, a {{labour supply}} is a core {{requirement}} in a capitalist society.

Low-level samurai could be paid as little as a <b>subsistence</b> <b>wage</b> and worked as guards, messengers and clerks. Positions within the class were largely hereditary and talented samurai could not rise above a few social steps beyond their birth.|$|E

This paper presents a 'rational reconstruction' of Cantillon's system and the relation between real wages and employment within it.

These results are contrasted with a model of Cantillon by Hans Brems. ...|$|R

50|$|Surplus labour can be {{used instead}} of capital in the {{creation}} of new industrial investment projects, or it can be channeled into nascent industries, which are labour-intensive in their early stages. Such growth does not raise the value of the <b>subsistence</b> <b>wage,</b> because the supply of labor exceeds the demand at that wage, and rising production via improved labour techniques has the effect of lowering the capital coefficient.Although labour is assumed to be in surplus, it is mainly unskilled. This inhibits growth since technical progress necessary for growth requires skilled labor. But should there be a labor surplus and a modest capital, this bottleneck can be broken through the provision of training and education facilities.The utility of unlimited supplies of labour to growth objectives depends upon the amount of capital available at the same time. Should there be surplus labour, agriculture will derive no productive use from it, so a transfer to a non agriculture sector will be of mutual benefit. It provides jobs to the agrarian population and reduces the burden of population from land. Industry now obtains its labour. Labour must be encouraged to move to increase productivity in agriculture. To start such a movement, the capitalist sector will have to pay a compensatory payment determined by the wage rate that people can earn outside their present sector, plus a set of other amounts includes the cost of living in the new sector and changes in the level of profits in the existing sector. The margin capitalists may have to pay is as much as 30 per cent above the average <b>subsistence</b> <b>wage,</b> WW1 in figure which represents the capitalist sector is shown by N; OW is the industrial wage. Given the profit maximization assumption, employment of labor within the industrial sector is given by the point where marginal product is equal to the rate of wages, i.e. OM.|$|E
