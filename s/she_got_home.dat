2500|$|Arfwedson {{found it}} [...] "absolutely exhausting" [...] {{to portray the}} condition. She {{admitted}} {{it was hard to}} get out of character because when <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> she would be learning lines for the following day. To avoid feeling manic herself, she would socialise, meditate and do yoga to forget about Zosia. The storyline had positive outcomes for viewers. People with the condition contacted the actress to credit her portrayal with saving their lives. Arfwedson said she found it [...] "quite moving" [...] to think she was making a difference in real life.|$|E
2500|$|On April 3, 2002, Maria St. John filed {{a lawsuit}} in Los Angeles Superior Court accusing Manson of {{providing}} her adult daughter, Jennifer Syme, with cocaine and instructing her to drive while under the influence. After attending a party at Manson's house, Syme was given a lift home; Manson claims she was taken home by a designated driver. After <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> she got {{behind the wheel of}} her own vehicle and was killed when she crashed it into three parked cars. Manson is reported to have said there were no alcohol or other drugs at the party. St. John's lawyer asked [...] " [...] there were no drinks, no drugs, why would she need a designated driver?" ...|$|E
60|$|The mystery was solved when <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> {{and found}} a letter from Edith {{awaiting}} her.|$|E
60|$|The farther <b>she</b> <b>got</b> from <b>home</b> the shabbier {{her gown}} seemed {{and the more}} {{impossible}} her coat and hat. At last, as we were leaving Minneapolis {{on our way to}} Osage she leaned her tired head against me and sobbed out a wild wish to go home.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{see that}} there is any call for a scene," [...] said Mrs. March firmly. [...] "The poor woman has just <b>got</b> here, and <b>she</b> thinks <b>she</b> has <b>got</b> <b>home.</b> <b>She</b> might as well think so if it is of any comfort to her. You'd better leave her here." ...|$|R
30|$|She {{developed}} a chronic headache in September 2009. This {{had started the}} night after a work dinner, at which she emphasises that she only had one alcoholic drink. Towards {{the end of the}} evening, she suddenly started slurring her speech, and a senior colleague persuaded her to go home. She has absolutely no memory of her journey back to (she presumes) Charing Cross station, perhaps a 5 minute walk. She seems to have brought a train ticket as judged by her own credit card account (even though she holds a season ticket to Dartford), and found herself in Dover at 3 am with no intervening memory. <b>She</b> <b>got</b> a taxi <b>home,</b> but then had to be looked after by a friend as her parents were abroad. She was quite unable to move for a full day. It is of great interest that several of her colleagues (who had never hitherto been interested in her welfare) phoned her at home to ensure that <b>she</b> had <b>got</b> <b>home</b> safely.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{probably}} from the children's uncle," [...] she said excitedly, when <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>home.</b> [...] "Oh, Marilla, I {{wonder what he}} says about them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "--By the wind, sir--that it's a mercy <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> at all. Oh dear, yes. Yes. It {{was by the}} wind, Mr. Redlaw. By the wind." ...|$|E
60|$|A {{very new}} basket phaeton stood {{glittering}} at Annie's door when <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>home,</b> and Mrs. Wilmington {{put her head}} out of the open parlour window.|$|E
50|$|While {{she was in}} Paris {{she visited}} a lot of art {{galleries}} Visiting the Galleries she discovered Kinetic Art {{and because of this}} she likes to work with Multi-Media. She spent some time working with a Jazz concert controlling lighting and projections that would change according to the music. When Grobet returned to Mexico, she decided that she wanted to focus on photography, after <b>she</b> <b>got</b> back <b>home</b> <b>she</b> decided to burn all of her old work and start over.|$|R
5000|$|Hammerich made {{trouble in}} Tokyo again. Jutlandia was {{sent out to}} do {{humanitarian}} work - any kind of humanitarian work - {{not to be in}} an idle standby position. There was no need for her anymore for military purposes, so <b>she</b> <b>got</b> sent <b>home</b> as an ambulance again. She departed for Yokosuka on 16 August to transfer her last patients, then she was made ready in a Yokohama shipyard for the trip home. She departed from Tokyo on 29 August with 229 patients and released P.O.W.s on board ...|$|R
60|$|When <b>she</b> <b>got</b> back <b>home</b> <b>she</b> {{unwrapped}} her {{packages and}} showed her purchases to Louisa. But Louisa neither looked at them nor spoke to Mary Isabel. Mary Isabel tossed her head and went to her own room. Her draught of freedom had stimulated her, {{and she did not}} mind Louisa's attitude half as much as she would have expected. She read Tom's letter over again to fortify herself and then she dressed her hair in a fashion she had seen that day in town and pulled out all the little curls on her forehead.|$|R
60|$|Nothing moved Anne in the least. Her {{mind was}} made up. She {{would not go}} to school to Mr. Phillips again; she told Marilla so when <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>home.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope he {{was none}} {{the worse for}} it," [...] said the {{sporting}} character who had been telling Staveley just now how she had cried when <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> that night.|$|E
60|$|When <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> she was hurried up {{at once to}} her mother's room,--and {{there she}} found her father, alone. 'This is your game, is it?' said he, looking down at her.|$|E
50|$|Later that evening, <b>she</b> <b>got</b> {{underway}} for <b>home.</b> After a non-stop {{voyage of}} 17 days, {{she arrived in}} San Diego on 16 February. She moved to Long Beach on the 23d to replace a cracked screw and departed that port on the 27th {{to return to the}} western Pacific. She reached Subic Bay on 15 March.|$|R
50|$|After {{taking on}} {{supplies}} and fuel at Oran, <b>she</b> <b>got</b> underway for <b>home</b> on 6 September. Following a quick overhaul at Norfolk, the escort carrier set her course for Panama; transited the Canal; {{and arrived at}} San Diego on 26 October. There, she embarked two air squadrons for transportation to Hawaii and departed the west coast on 29 October 1944.|$|R
60|$|When Mrs. McKeon {{found the}} letter on her return, she was greatly vexed; {{but she could}} do nothing; she couldn't go to Ballycloran and fetch Feemy by force. The {{falsehood}} with which the letter concluded was not altogether disbelieved; but still she felt by no means certain that her former suspicions were not true, and if so, perhaps it was better for all parties that Feemy should be at home. She determined to call at Ballycloran when Feemy might be supposed to have settled herself, and content herself for the present with hearing from the girl who came for the clothes that <b>she</b> had <b>got</b> <b>home</b> safe.|$|R
60|$|When <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>home,</b> {{she found}} Mary Bold in the drawing-room {{with the child}} in her lap. She rushed forward and, {{throwing}} herself on her knees, kissed the little fellow till she almost frightened him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Huldy was a gal of spirit, and she despised the talk, but it {{made her}} drefful uncomfortable; and when <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> at night she {{sat down in the}} mor-nin'-glory porch, quite quiet, and didn't sing a word.|$|E
60|$|When <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> to her lodgings {{that evening}} she {{reflected}} {{with something like}} surprise upon her half-day's employment, and decided that it showed nothing more nor less than that Capes was a really very interesting person indeed.|$|E
60|$|It {{was a fair}} green {{evening in}} June. She was seated in the garden, in the rustic chair which stood under the laurel-bushes--made of peeled oak-branches that came to Melbury's {{premises}} as refuse after barking-time. The mass of full-juiced leafage on the heights around her was just swayed into faint gestures by a nearly spent wind which, even in its enfeebled state, did not reach her shelter. All day she had expected Giles to call--to inquire how <b>she</b> had <b>got</b> <b>home,</b> or something or other; {{but he had not}} come. And he still tantalized her by going athwart and across that orchard opposite. She could see him as she sat.|$|R
50|$|White Marsh {{remained}} at Leyte until 14 July when <b>she</b> <b>got</b> underway for <b>home.</b> <b>She</b> stopped at Eniwetok on 21 July, loaded cargo and passengers, resumed her voyage, {{and arrived at}} Oahu on 29 July. She remained there only overnight and, the next day, got underway for the West Coast. The ship reached San Francisco on 29 July and was receiving repairs there when Japan capitulated in mid-August.|$|R
50|$|In late September 1962, Paine and {{his wife}} Ruth separated, Ruth asked him to have his {{personal}} belongings {{moved out of the}} house by the time <b>she</b> <b>got</b> back <b>home</b> from traveling around the United States that summer. According to Michael, it was not he, but Ruth who pushed to legally end their marriage. As their divorce made its way through the legal system until it ended in 1970, the Paines continued to see films at the theater together, and their Madrigal singing as a couple continued. Michael kept his own apartment in Arington, Texas, while Ruth remained with Lynn and Christopher in the Irving home. In the end, the divorce was amicable, and Michael kept a very favorable view of Ruth.|$|R
6000|$|... "The Pretty Poll! <b>She</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> safe, was sold, {{and is now}} in the West-India trade. There is a {{handsome}} balance, amounting to some fourteen hundred dollars, in the owners' hands, coming to you from prize-money and wages." ...|$|E
60|$|So Polly {{made her}} moan, {{and by the}} time <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>home,</b> was just in the mood to go to bed and cry herself to sleep, as girls have a way of doing when their small affliction becomes unbearable.|$|E
60|$|Poor Mrs. Bold, when <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> from Ullathorne on {{the evening}} of Miss Thorne's party, was very unhappy and, moreover, very tired. Nothing {{fatigues}} the body so much as weariness of spirit, and Eleanor's spirit was indeed weary.|$|E
60|$|The fat pony jogged {{over the}} bridge in Lynde's Hollow and along the Green Gables lane. Marilla's face was rather grim. It was ten miles from East Grafton and Davy Keith seemed to be possessed {{with a passion for}} {{perpetual}} motion. It was beyond Marilla's power to make him sit still and she had been in an agony the whole way lest he fall {{over the back of the}} wagon and break his neck, or tumble over the dashboard under the pony's heels. In despair she finally threatened to whip him soundly when <b>she</b> <b>got</b> him <b>home.</b> Whereupon Davy climbed into her lap, regardless of the reins, flung his chubby arms about her neck and gave her a bear-like hug.|$|R
60|$|The girls {{said all}} they could to comfort her, and they succeeded in a great degree; {{but they could not}} bring her to talk of Martin. She shuddered {{whenever}} his name was mentioned, and they began to fear that Barry's threat would have the intended effect, and frighten her from the match. However, they kindly talked of other things--of how impossible it was that she should go back to Dunmore House, and how comfortable and snug they would make her at the inn, till <b>she</b> <b>got</b> a <b>home</b> for herself; of what she should do, and of all their little household plans together; till Anty, when she could forget her brother's threats for a time, seemed to be more comfortable and happy than she had been for years.|$|R
50|$|In the Sunday food {{section of}} the Minneapolis Star and Tribune (December 1, 1974 issue), food editor Mary Hart {{featured}} Lansky and the cookbook. This inspired Lansky and her husband Bruce, who had worked in sales and marketing, to start a publishing company. Meadowbrook Press (named after Meadowbrook Lane where the couple lived) was created to sell Feed Me I'm Yours nationally. When the couple's marriage ended in the early 1980s, however, so did the business partnership; in the divorce settlement, her husband got the business, while <b>she</b> <b>got</b> their lake-front <b>home.</b>|$|R
60|$|When <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> {{she ran to}} {{seek out}} her godmother, and, after having thanked her, {{she said she could}} not but heartily wish she might go next day to the ball, because the King's son had desired her.|$|E
6000|$|And when <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> she {{was obliged}} {{to say to her}} daughter, [...] "I am not well, my dear; I must go and lie down. Attend to your papa. Leave me in quiet. I shall take no dinner." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{tell your}} mother you've been sick," [...] he said. There {{was no need to}} ask that. When <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>home,</b> the child crept away under the parlour sofa, like a sick little animal, and was a long time before she crawled out.|$|E
50|$|On 26 November, the {{salvage tug}} arrived in Subic Bay but {{remained}} only until the 30th when she embarked upon a voyage which {{took her to}} Thailand and Singapore. Beaufort returned to Subic Bay on 2 January 1981. She operated out of that port until 6 April when <b>she</b> <b>got</b> underway for <b>home.</b> The ship stopped at Guam on 12 April but continued her voyage east on the 13th. Beaufort reentered Pearl Harbor on 28 April and remained there until 8 June when she resumed operations in the Hawaiian Islands.|$|R
5000|$|The ship paused {{there to}} refuel and to embark {{passengers}} for transportation to the United States. <b>She</b> <b>got</b> underway for <b>home</b> on 25 April, sailed into San Francisco Bay on 12 May, and shortly thereafter entered a shipyard for alterations and repairs. Her repairs and shakedown were completed on 26 June, and she resumed cargo operations. The ship got underway on 8 July, shaped {{a course for}} the Marshalls, and during the next month delivered cargo to both Eniwetok and Kwajalein. Auriga was then routed to Espiritu Santo to pick up more cargo.|$|R
6000|$|Little Bilham sat staring before him; then he {{sprang up}} as if his friend's penetration, {{recurrent}} and insistent, made him really after all too nervous. [...] "No--she isn't now. It isn't in the least," [...] he went on, [...] "Chad's fault. He's really all right. I mean {{he would have been}} willing. But she came over with ideas. Those <b>she</b> had <b>got</b> at <b>home.</b> They had been her motive and support in joining her brother and his wife. She was to SAVE our friend." ...|$|R
