5|$|His {{international}} breakthrough {{came at the}} 2001 Wimbledon Championships where a 19 {{year old}} Federer faced the four-time defending champion and all-time Grand Slam leader Pete Sampras. The teenage Swiss <b>stunned</b> <b>the</b> seven time Wimbledon champion and #1 seed in a dramatic five set epic to reach the quarterfinals. In the quarters he faced Englishman Tim Henman, eventually losing in an overtime fourth set tiebreaker. Federer's breakthrough at Wimbledon signaled the record breaking dominance he would display at the All England Club {{over the next two}} decades.|$|E
5|$|Shiloh was the costliest {{battle in}} American history {{to that point}} and the {{staggering}} 23,746 total casualties <b>stunned</b> <b>the</b> nation. Briefly hailed a hero for routing the Confederates, Grant was soon mired in controversy. The Northern press castigated Grant for shockingly high casualties, and accused him of drunkenness during the battle, contrary to the accounts of officers and others {{with him at the}} time. However, Grant's victory at Shiloh ended any chance for the Confederates to prevail in the Mississippi valley or regain its strategic advantage in the West.|$|E

5|$|Surrounded, he {{told his}} men to die as martyrs, and opened fire. His {{defiance}} and manner of his death (which <b>stunned</b> <b>the</b> traditional leadership) electrified the Palestinian people. Thousands forced their way past police lines at the funeral in Haifa, and the secular Arab nationalist parties invoked his memory as the symbol of resistance. It was the largest political gathering ever to assemble in mandatory Palestine.|$|E
5|$|After {{withdrawing}} from the Commonwealth Games squad, Kydd took a four-month hiatus from the sport in order to recover from injury and regain motivation. She married fiancée Garth in April 2006, and though widely known by her maiden name, decided to take on her husband's surname. Kydd began the process of re-signing with the Kestrels for the 2006 season, and returned to training with the club with March 2006, but <b>stunned</b> <b>the</b> team when she defected to more successful rival Melbourne Phoenix only {{three weeks before the}} start of the season. The defection caused notable antagonism between the traditional rivals with Kydd's former coach, Jane Searle and several teammates expressing shock at the suddenness of the switch.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, the American Psychiatric Association listed {{homosexuality}} in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) as {{a mental}} disorder. A large-scale study of homosexuality in 1962 {{was used to}} justify inclusion of the disorder as a supposed pathological hidden fear {{of the opposite sex}} caused by traumatic parent–child relationships. This view was widely influential in the medical profession. In 1956, however, the psychologist Evelyn Hooker performed a study that compared the happiness and well-adjusted nature of self-identified homosexual men with heterosexual men and found no difference. Her study <b>stunned</b> <b>the</b> medical community and made her a hero to many gay men and lesbians, but homosexuality remained in the DSM until 1973.|$|E

5|$|<b>Stunned,</b> <b>the</b> {{remaining}} Chili Peppers, {{who had no}} suitable {{replacement for}} Frusciante, hired Arik Marshall to play the remaining dates after being forced to reschedule. Upon returning to Hollywood, the band placed {{an ad in the}} L.A. Weekly for open guitar auditions, which Kiedis considered to be a waste of time. After several months of unsuccessfully looking for a suitable guitarist, drummer Chad Smith suggested Dave Navarro. He had always been the band's first choice, but had been too busy following the 1991 breakup of Jane's Addiction. Navarro eventually accepted the position after productive jam sessions.|$|E
5|$|General Trưởng was {{recalled}} to Saigon on 19 March {{to brief}} Thiệu on his withdrawal plan. The general developed two contingency plans: The first was predicated on government control of Highway 1, {{which would be}} utilized for two simultaneous withdrawals from Huế and Chu Lai to Da Nang; The second course presupposed PAVN interdiction of the highway {{and called for a}} withdrawal into three enclaves: Huế, Da Nang, and Chu Lai. This was to be only an interim measure, however, since the forces that withdrew to Huế and Chu Lai would then be sea-lifted to Da Nang by the navy. The president then <b>stunned</b> <b>the</b> general by announcing he misinterpreted his previous orders: The old imperial capital of Huế was not to be abandoned. Making matters worse, Trưởng discovered that his force was to be reduced by the removal of the Marine Division.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Roberts <b>stunned</b> <b>the</b> racing {{world when}} he left Yamaha after more than 25 years {{to start his own}} {{motorcycle}} company. Roberts had grown weary of battling over the direction he felt the Yamaha team needed to pursue. Basing his new company in England {{to take advantage of the}} Formula 1 industry, Roberts built a three-cylinder, two-stroke engine with the engineering assistance of Tom Walkinshaw Racing. He decided to take advantage of rules allowing lighter weights for three-cylinder motorcycles after observing the agility and handling advantage of Spencer's Honda NS500 during the 1983 season. Unfortunately, by the time the motorcycle had been developed, tire technology had improved to the point where any advantage over four-cylinder bikes had been negated. The motorcycle did manage to win a pole position with rider Jeremy McWilliams taking the top qualifying position at the 2002 Australian Grand Prix against the new breed of 990cc four-stroke MotoGP motorcycles.|$|E

5|$|Understanding {{that they}} could not hold out against the might of the British Empire indefinitely, Kruger hoped for a {{solution}} at the earliest opportunity. The triumvirate wrote to Colley on 12 February that they were prepared to submit to a royal commission. Colley liaised by telegraph with Gladstone's Colonial Secretary Lord Kimberley, then wrote to Kruger on 21 February that if the Boers stopped fighting he would cease hostilities and send commissioners for talks. Kruger received this letter on 28 February and readily accepted, but by now it was too late. Colley had been killed at the Battle of Majuba Hill the day before, another decisive victory for the Boers under Smit. This progressive humiliation of the Imperial forces in South Africa by a ragtag collection of farmers, to paraphrase Meintjes and the historian Ian Castle, <b>stunned</b> <b>the</b> Western world.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{withdrawal}} to Singapore the 8th Division was deployed {{to defend the}} island's north-west coast. Due to the casualties suffered in Johore most of the division's units were at half-strength. The commander of the Singapore fortress, Lieutenant General Arthur Ernest Percival, believed that the Japanese would land on the north-east coast of the island and deployed the near full-strength British 18th Division to defend this sector. The Japanese landing on 8 February {{took part in the}} Australian sector, however, and the 8th Division was forced from its positions after just two days of heavy fighting. The division was also unable to turn back the Japanese landing at Kranji and withdrew to the centre of the island. After further fighting in which the Commonwealth forces were pushed into a narrow perimeter around the urban area of Singapore, Percival surrendered his forces on 15 February. Following the surrender 14,972Australians were taken prisoner, though some escaped on ships. These escapees included Major General Bennett, who was found by two post-war inquiries to have been unjustified in leaving his command. The loss of almost a quarter of Australia's overseas soldiers, and the failure of the Singapore Strategy that had permitted it to accept the sending of the AIF to aid Britain, <b>stunned</b> <b>the</b> country.|$|E
5|$|Rain and fog {{were heavy}} {{throughout}} {{the morning of}} July 6, and visibility was limited for the emplaced troops. Just after daybreak, 13 North Korean T-34 tanks were spotted stopped at the bridge. Following them were two columns of infantry. The American forces originally believed {{that they might be}} survivors of Task Force Smith until they realized the forces were deploying in numbers too great, and began preparing to attack the unsuspecting North Koreans. The battalion's commander ordered mortar fire on the North Korean forces, causing them to disperse as the lead tank began firing on the positions of A Company, on a hill southwest of the road. Mortar fire destroyed a truck, but a round from a North Korean tank <b>stunned</b> <b>the</b> artillery observer and no one took his place in the confusion, ending the American mortar attack. North Korean forces immediately began advancing on A Company's position, but the company was not able to return fire effectively, with fewer than half of its soldiers using their weapons. For several minutes only squad and platoon leaders shot back {{while the rest of the}} soldiers hid in their foxholes. Within fifteen minutes, B Company was able to return fire effectively, and by this time the North Korean forces had advanced steadily toward 1st Battalion's position. Later examinations found many American soldiers' weapons were assembled incorrectly or were dirty or broken. The Americans had nothing with which to fight the tanks, and were unable to do anything to stop them.|$|E
