40|$|In {{the past}} decade, many European farmers have adopted less-intensive {{production}} methods replacing external inputs with local resources and farmers‘ skills. Some have developed closer relations with consumers, {{also known as}} short food-supply chains or agro-food relocalization. Through both these means, farmers can gain more of the value that they have added to food production, as well as greater incentives for more sustainable methods and/or quality products, thus linking environmental and economic sustainability. These systemic changes encounter difficulties indicating two generic needs—for <b>state</b> <b>support</b> <b>measures,</b> and for larger intermediaries to expand local markets. The UK rural county of Cumbria provides a case study for exploring those two needs. Cumbria farmers have developed greater proximity to consumers, {{as a means to}} gain their support for organic, territorially branded and/or simply 'local‘ food. This opportunity has been an incentive for practices which reduce transport distances, energy costs and other inputs. Regional authorities have provided various support measures for more closely linking producers {{with each other and with}} consumers, together developing a Cumbrian food culture. Going beyond the capacity of individual producers, farmer-led intermediaries have maintained distinctive product identities in larger markets including supermarket chains. Although Cumbria‘s agro-food relocalization initiatives remain marginal, they counteract the 1990 s trend towards delocalization, while also indicating potential for expansion elsewhere...|$|E
40|$|There is {{a problem}} of {{development}} of import substitution and strengthening of food security which solution is impossible without modern and innovative means of agriculture. In this regard the investment activity necessary for ensuring reproduction processes has the main significance. The question of instruments promoting high efficiency of investment processes of agricultural enterprises is still not solved. The aim of the research is development of theoretical issues, methodical and practical recommendations about increasing the efficiency of investment activity of agricultural enterprises. Conducting the research the concept “efficiency of investment activity of agricultural enterprises” is specified and the technique of its assessment is investigated. This approbation on various levels of national economy (for the Nizhny Novgorod Region, the Volga Federal District of Russian Federation) has shown that further activization of investment processes on the basis of improvement of state mechanism of investment regulation is necessary. However, enhancement of investment activity management at the enterprises is also required.

The sharp fall in new vehicle registrations in January (40 %) confirmed {{the impact of the}} economic crisis on the Italian car market, causing a major alert for the potential consequences on this sector’s employment. The alarming situation of the car sector has led all EU governments to approve both industry support measures and demand incentives for consumers. The latter, in particular, are motivated by the downward trend in consumer purchase of durable goods, mainly attributed to both income level and increasing uncertainty. In the early weeks of 2009, car firms have temporarily shut down some of their facilities while the parking lots for the storage of new vehicles are full of unsold cars. The present article briefly describes the Italian and global car market, with an eye to the more-or-less induced, technological developments.

Such evaluation would be necessary not only to see what is given and how the money are spent, but to have a complete frame and to fully argue the programming of support in the future by respective institutions.

It is noted that the innovative sphere exists and develops independently as such in the Russian Federation. Purposes / tasks.

Methodology. Methods of the economic and statistical analysis. Theoretical base of the article comprise the national and foreign researchers’ works in the field of innovation management, technological management, and that of the companies’ and economical general development. Results. Poorly positive dynamics of patents growth in comparison with a volume of R&D costs is established in this researching. Almost similar dependence between dynamics of innovative goods and services sales growth in comparison with technological innovations costs was discovered in analysis. The received total integrated estimates of dynamic level of the RF innovative economic development during the period from 1998 to 2015 proved the existence of poorly positive tendency of such dynamics growth. To coordinate companies’ interests of development with innovative environment opportunities, the scheme of interaction among innovative organizations and the companies within a full innovative cycle is off ered. Conclusions / importance. The carried-out analysis of Russian innovative sphere shows that despite the <b>state</b> <b>support</b> <b>measures</b> which has been taken in recent years, it stagnates and exerts the insufficient impact on economy and society in general. Poorly positive dynamics of patents growth compared to R&D costs, and also similar dependence of innovative goods and services sales growth depending on technological innovations costs is also revealed.

This paper focuses on single-graph as an effective model to represent information and its related graph mining techniques. In frequent pattern mining in a single-graph setting, {{there are two main}} problems: <b>support</b> <b>measure</b> and search scheme. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for constructing <b>support</b> <b>measures</b> that brings together existing minimum-image-based and overlap-graph-based <b>support</b> <b>measures.</b> Our framework is built on the concept of occurrence / instance hypergraphs.

In particular, we show that the existing minimum-image-based <b>support</b> <b>measure</b> is an upper bound of the MI measure, which is also linear-time computable and results in counts that are close to number of instances of a pattern. Although the MVC measure is NP-hard, it can be approximated to a constant factor in polynomial time.
