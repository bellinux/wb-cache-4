25|$|As Sydney rapidly expanded, {{following}} World War II, Carlingford underwent rapid urbanisation. James Ruse Agricultural High School, {{established in}} 1959, {{is a testament}} to the agricultural history of Carlingford as well as the rapid pace of urbanisation; which soon made the school, and its large farm, <b>somewhat</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> anomaly amongst the 1970s and 1980s housing which dominate the suburb. More recently, in the 1990s, the government policy of urban consolidation has seen the development of high-density units and apartment blocks around the town centre and the train station. There have also been redevelopments of older houses into medium-density townhouses, and duplex housing.|$|E
25|$|As {{tensions}} between the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as fears of further rebellion in British North America, grew in the late 18th century, the British reinforced the defences of their colonies according to a plan drawn up in the 1790s by Gother Mann. The ramparts around the Upper Town cliff and four martello towers (still extant) on the Plains of Abraham were completed before 1812. A citadel was {{a key part of}} Mann's design, but no fort was built because the cost was deemed prohibitive. That opinion finally shifted following the War of 1812; Régiment| accessdate=18 January 2015}} as part of a wider improvement of Canada's defences coordinated by the Duke of Richmond, then Governor-in-Chief of British North America, the existing star fort was built between 1820 and 1850 under the direction of Lieutenant Colonel Elias Walker Durnford of the Royal Engineers. Intended to secure Quebec City against the Americans and serve as a refuge for the British garrison in the event of attack or rebellion, the Citadelle incorporated a section of the French enceinte of 1745 and the layout was based on Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban's design for an arms, munitions, and supplies depot, as well as a barracks. That, though, was <b>somewhat</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> anachronism {{by the time of the}} fort's completion, in comparison to other contemporary European military architecture.
