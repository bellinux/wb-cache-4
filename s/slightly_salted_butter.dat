Mrs Slocombe is the Senior of the Ladies Department and known for her unusual hair colours, such as lime green, purple or orange. Throughout the series, her husband was alluded to have either left Mrs. Slocombe, or was {{possibly}} arrested by the Fraud Squad. In Grace and Favour, it was revealed Mrs Slocombe's husband, Cecil, had walked out on her one morning (to buy <b>slightly</b> <b>salted</b> <b>butter</b> at Sainsbury's) and ended up a successful land developer. In one episode she accepts what she thinks is a marriage proposal from Mr. Humphries, implying that she is now divorced from Mr Slocombe.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of added lyophilized butter serum on the heat stability of milk was investigated. The addition of lyophilized serum from <b>salted</b> <b>butter</b> to unconcentrated skimmed milk (SM) reduced the heat coagulation time (HCT) at, {{and increased the}} pH of, the maximum in the pH-HCT profile and caused disappearance of the minimum. NaCl had similar effects on the heat stability of SM as lyophilized <b>salted</b> <b>butter</b> serum, whereas lyophilized serum from unsalted butter had little effect. The addition of lyophilized <b>salted</b> <b>butter</b> serum to concentrated skimmed milk (CSM) also shifted the pH of maximum heat stability to a higher value and, at certain concentrations, increased the maximum HCT; similar effects were obtained on addition of NaCl, but lyophilized serum from unsalted butter had little effect. These {{results suggest that the}} effects of lyophilized serum from <b>salted</b> <b>butter</b> on the heat stability of SM or CSM are due primarily to the presence of a high level of NaCl in this serum...|$|R

40|$|The {{search for}} methods of buttermaking that would yield a uniform product of good keeping quality {{led to the}} {{introduction}} of cream pasteurization and the ripening of the treated cream with selected cultures of bacteria. At about the time this procedure was developed, evidence began to accumulate which indicated that <b>salted</b> <b>butter</b> made from sweet cream deteriorated less on holding than <b>salted</b> <b>butter</b> made from ripened cream and, eventually, the influence of acid on certain types of chemical deterioration in butter was definitely established. The conflict between a high acidity in the cream and good keeping quality in the resulting butter has necessitated drastic changes in the methods of using butter culture in the manufacture of <b>salted</b> <b>butter.</b> Over the years, in an attempt to avoid certain types of deterioration in the butter, there has been a gradual lowering of the cream acidity at churning. Most butter plants in the United States now use a relatively low acidity in the cream. The general procedure is to hold the mixture of cream and butter culture at a low temperature in order to avoid significant increases in acidity...|$|R

40|$|The {{distribution}} of <b>salt</b> in <b>butter</b> is of importance from the standpoints of uniformity of composition and color, {{distribution of}} moisture and deterioration through action of micro-organisms. Various investigators, using macro-methods of analysis, {{have studied the}} distribution of <b>salt</b> in <b>butter,</b> particularly in connection with controlling the composition and preventing certain color defects. The information obtained is very useful, {{but it is not}} adequate in considering the relationship of salt to bacterial changes in butter. The retarding effect of salt on the activity of many micro-organisms is generally recognized, and various investigators (8) have· noted that addition of <b>salt</b> to <b>butter</b> limits the action of bacteria in it. However, butter containing relatively high percentages of salt sometimes undergoes bacterial spoilage...|$|R

Normal (<b>salted)</b> <b>butter</b> may also be appropriate for camp use, but unsalted butter or lard may not be, due to their shorter shelf life.|$|R
50|$|Nonnevot is a Limburgian pastry {{dating back}} to the 17th century. Hailing from the town of Sittard the pastry has {{traditionally}} been associated with carnival (Limburgian: Vastelaovend), but is nowadays sold year-round in regional bakeries. Its name: nonnevot, or nun's buttocks, comes from the knotted shape of the pastry, resembling the knot {{on the back of a}} nun's tunic.

50|$|Although {{there are}} many ways to prepare and compose the dish, a classic recipe would call for the {{following}} ingredients: <b>salted</b> <b>butter,</b> bell peppers, shallots, Spanish onions, garlic, potatoes, tomatoes, chickpeas, chili pepper, harissa, celery, cinnamon, black peppercorn, carrots, turnips and squash. The idea is for the dish to contain many vegetables and a variety of Mediterranean ingredients.

2500|$|All {{categories}} of butter {{are sold in}} both salted and unsalted forms. Either granular salt or a strong brine are added to <b>salted</b> <b>butter</b> during processing. In addition to enhanced flavor, the addition of salt acts as a preservative. The amount of butterfat in the finished product is a vital aspect of production. In the United States, products sold as [...] "butter" [...] must contain at least 80% butterfat. In practice, most American butters contain slightly more than that, averaging around 81% butterfat. European butters generally have a higher ratio—up to 85%.|$|R
