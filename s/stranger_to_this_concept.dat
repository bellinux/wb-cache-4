40|$|Business incubators, as {{recognised}} {{in their}} contemporary form, {{have a history}} {{dating back to the}} 1970 s in the United Kingdom and the USA. South Africa is no <b>stranger</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>concept</b> of business incubation either: Since the 1980 s the Small Business Development Corporation (SBDC) operated business “hives” as clusters of small enterprises. Business incubators are support facilities that empower and stimulate small-entrepreneurial businesses – from the financially vulnerable start-up period, until the time that the fledgling company is ready to operate more autonomously. Business incubators provide, as part of their services, affordable space, financial-management services, sound business advice and other development services. Incubation stimulates the development of small-entrepreneurial businesses and, to this end, helps stimulate the economy. Thus, for South Africa to invest in the development of small growing businesses, is to invest directly in its larger economy and to address its own development challenges like employment-creation, income-generation and the alleviation of poverty. It is in this context that this study discusses the development challenges of one of the rural areas in South Africa, Oudtshoorn, and aims to provide a viable strategy of business incubation for this area, in anticipation that in future lessons can be drawn from this and applied to other rural areas. Oudtshoorn is a town in the Klein Karoo, in the Western Cape Province of South Africa. The strongest sectors in Oudtshoorn’s economy are agriculture and tourism. These two sectors should provide the basis for an empowering business incubator to strengthen and enhance smaller businesses in the town. The study focuses on the development challenges of South Africa and, in particular, a rural town such as Oudtshoorn, the importance of investing in small entrepreneurial businesses so as to strengthen the country’s economy. the nature an significance of a business-incubation strategy for the Oudtshoorn area. Background literature on South Africa’s development challenges was collated as well as information gathered on small-business support and incubation in particular. Literature was retrieved from local institutions as well as national and international sources. Case studies of incubators in South Africa and in other countries were included to enhance the understanding of the importance of business incubation. In addition, the researcher’s close networks with the Oudtshoorn municipality, the local Red Door office and the different role-players in the small-business support sphere allowed for an in-depth assessment of support for such an incubation project and the critical obstacles it may encounter en rout...|$|E
