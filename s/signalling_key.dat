40|$|Abstract Downstream A 3 {{receptor}} signalling {{plays an}} important role in the regulation of cell death and proliferation. Therefore, it is important to determine the molecular pathways involved through A 3 receptor stimulation. The phosphatidylinositide- 3 -OH kinase (PI 3 K) /Akt and the Raf/ mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK/ERK) kinase (MEK) /mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways have central roles in the regulation of cell survival and proliferation. The crosstalk between these two pathways has also been investigated. The focus of this review centres on downstream mediators of A 3 adenosine receptor <b>signalling.</b> <b>Key</b> words adenosine.

The stimuli that signalled the multiple-schedule components were {{located on a}} second <b>key</b> (<b>signal</b> <b>key),</b> and a changeover delay prevented reinforcement of signal key-peck—operant key-peck sequences.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} are reported that challenge {{the interpretation of}} previous results with the signal-key procedure, in which the discriminative stimuli are located on a response key different from the key associated with the operant response requirement. Experiment 1 replicated the procedure of Keller (1974), and found that contrast effects on the operant key occurred reliably for only one of four subjects. High rates to the <b>signal</b> <b>key</b> initially occurred for only one subject, but modifications of the procedure produced substantial rates to the <b>signal</b> <b>key</b> for all subjects. In all cases, however, signal-key behavior was greatly reduced {{by the addition of}} a changeover delay which prevented reinforcement within 2 seconds of the last peck to the <b>signal</b> <b>key,</b> suggesting that signal-key pecking was maintained primarily by adventitious reinforcement. Experiment 2 modified the signal-key procedure by using three response keys, so that the discriminative stimuli on the <b>signal</b> <b>key</b> controlled different responses during all phases of training. With this modification, reliable contrast effects on the operant key occurred for all subjects, suggesting that the failure to find contrast in previous studies has been due to the confounding of changes in the discrimination requirements with changes in relative rate of reinforcement. The results challenge the additivity theory of contrast, and suggest that “elicited” behavior plays a minor role, if any, in the determination of contrast effects in multiple schedules...|$|R

The HHP 1 T-DNA insertion mutant (hhp 1 - 1) showed a higher sensitivity to ABA and osmotic stress than the wild-type (WT), as revealed by the germination rate and post-germination growth rate. The induced expression of stress-responsive genes (RD 29 A, RD 29 B, ADH 1, KIN 1, COR 15 A, and COR 47) was more sensitive to exogenous ABA and osmotic stress in hhp 1 - 1 than in the WT.

Comparing {{how this is}} achieved by native and non-native speakers of English sheds light on the generalisability of genre findings across users of the same language and can inform lecturer training and lecture comprehension courses. The markers were extracted from the British Academic Spoken English corpus and the Corpus of English as a Lingua Franca in Academic Settings combining corpus-based and corpus-driven methods. They were quantified and classified for their ‘interactive orientation’ to the listeners (e. g. note), speaker (e. g. I want to emphasize) or content (e. g. the important point is) (Deroey, 2013). Identifying important points is arguably a key aspect of effective lecture delivery and comprehension and interactivity is also widely advocated.

Research using germ-free mice (mice raised without any exposure to microorganisms) has provided some of the most persuasive evidence for a role of these bacteria in gut-brain <b>signalling.</b> <b>Key</b> findings show that the microbiota is necessary for normal stress responsivity, anxiety-like behaviors, sociability, and cognition. Furthermore, the microbiota maintains central nervous system homeostasis by regulating immune function and blood brain barrier integrity. Studies have also found that the gut microbiota influences neurotransmitter, synaptic, and neurotrophic signalling systems and neurogenesis. The principle advantage of the germ-free mouse model is in proof-of-principle studies and that a complete microbiota or defined consortiums of bacteria can be introduced at various developmental time points. However, a germ-free upbringing can induce permanent neurodevelopmental deficits that may deem the model unsuitable for specific scientific queries that do not involve early-life microbial deficiency. As such, alternatives and complementary strategies to the germ-free model are warranted and include antibiotic treatment to create microbiota-deficient animals at distinct time points across the lifespan. Increasing our understanding of the impact of the gut microbiota on brain and behavior has the potential to inform novel management strategies for stress-related gastrointestinal and neuropsychiatric disorders...|$|E

We propose that transduction of the stretch signal involves alteration of intracellular calcium signalling, including changes in transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) isoform expression. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the effect of prolonged mechanical (tonic) stretch in vitro on humanmyometrial smoothmuscle cell calcium signalling and TRPC expression. Cells were cul-tured from myometrial biopsies, obtained from women undergoing elective Caesarean section at term, grown on FlexiplatesTM and subjected to 25 % tonic mechanical stretch for 1, 4 and 14 h. Time-matched control cells were not stretched. Mechanical stretch (14 h) increased basal calcium entry and cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) -induced calcium/Mn 21 entry (P < 0. 05) in Fura- 2 loaded cells. The calcium selectivity of CPA-thapsigarin induced inward currents, measured by patch clamp electrophysiology, was also increased in stretched cells compared with control cells (P < 0. 05). Real time PCR and Western blot data demonstrated that TRPC 3 and TRPC 4 mRNA and TRPC 3 protein expression were increased by stretch (P < 0. 05), respectively. These data support the hypothesis that uterine stretch modulates uterine growth and contractility in pregnancy via alterations in calcium <b>signalling.</b> <b>Key</b> words: cell signalling/ion channels/pregnancy/smooth muscle/uteru...|$|E
40|$|Invasive {{migration}} of carcinoma cells {{is a prerequisite}} for the metastatic dissemination of solid tumours. Numerous mechanisms control the ability of cancer cells to acquire a motile and invasive phenotype, and subsequently degrade and invade the basement membrane. Several genes that are up-regulated in breast carcinoma are responsible for mediating the metastatic cascade. Recent studies have revealed that the NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T-cells) is a transcription factor that is highly expressed in aggressive breast cancer cells and tissues, and mediates invasion through transcriptional induction of pro-invasion and migration genes. In the present paper we demonstrate that NFAT promotes breast carcinoma invasion through induction of GPC (glypican) 6, a cell-surface glycoprotein. NFAT transcriptionally regulates GPC 6 induction in breast cancer cells and binds to three regulatory elements in the GPC 6 proximal promoter. Expression of GPC 6 in response to NFAT signalling promotes invasive migration, whereas GPC 6 silencing with shRNA (small-hairpin RNA) potently blocks this phenotype. The mechanism by which GPC 6 promotes invasive migration involves inhibition of canonical β-catenin and Wnt signalling, and up-regulation of non-canonical Wnt 5 A signalling leading to the activation of JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) and p 38 MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase). Thus GPC 6 is a novel NFAT target gene in breast cancer cells that promotes invasive migration through Wnt 5 A <b>signalling.</b> <b>Key</b> words: breast cancer, cancer invasion, glypican, nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), transcription factor...|$|E

When the signal was on a second, <b>signal</b> <b>key,</b> operant responding was suppressed during the signal and substantial pecking of the <b>signal</b> <b>key</b> occurred. The sum of <b>signal</b> <b>key</b> and operant key pecks far exceeded the operant baseline rate of responding.

Experiment II assessed the importance of signal location when shock rather than food was the US. Suppression of operant key pecking was unaffected by signal location. Experiment III assessed the relative effectiveness of visual and auditory stimuli (clicks) as signals for food and shock, and found that all combinations of signal and US were equally effective in suppressing operant key responding.

We evaluated whether or not CCN 2 would interact with BMP- 2, and examined the combination effect of CCN 2 with BMP- 2 (CCN 2 -BMP- 2) on the proliferation and differentiation of chondrocytes. Immunoprecipitation-western blotting analysis, solid-phase binding assay and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy showed that CCN 2 directly interacted with BMP- 2 with a dissociation constant of 0. 77 nM as evaluated by SPR. An in vivo study revealed that CCN 2 was co-localized with BMP- 2 at the pre-hypertrophic region in the E 18. 5 mouse growth plate. Interestingly, CCN 2 -BMP- 2 did not affect the BMP- 2 /CCN 2 -induced phosphorylation of p 38 MAPK but caused less phosphorylation of ERK 1 / 2 in cultured chondrocytes. Consistent with these results, cell proliferation assay showed that CCN 2 -BMP- 2 stimulated cell growth to a lesser degree than by either CCN 2 or BMP- 2 alone, whereas the expression of chondrocyte marker genes and proteoglycan synthesis, representing the mature chondrocytic phenotype, was increased collaboratively by CCN 2 -BMP- 2 treatment in cultured chondrocytes. These findings suggest that CCN 2 may regulate the proliferating and differentiation of chondrocytes by forming a complex with BMP- 2 as a novel modulator of BMP <b>signalling.</b> <b>Key</b> words: chondrocytes, CCN family 2 /connective tissue growth factor (CCN 2...|$|E
40|$|Freshly {{harvested}} barley {{seeds are}} considered as dormant {{since they do}} not germinate at temperatures above 20 C. This dormancy is broken during dry storage. Molecular regulation of dormancy was in-vestigated using cDNA-AFLP to identify transcripts differentially expressed in dormant and non-dormant embryos. Transcript patterns in embryos from dry dormant and non-dormant seeds and from both seeds imbibed for 5 h at 30 C, a temperature at which dormancy is expressed, were compared. Thirty-nine Transcript-Derived Fragments (TDF) that were repro-ducibly differentially expressed among treatments were identified, and 25 of these were cloned and sequenced. Among these, eight transcripts were ob-served to be differentially expressed during after-ripening, seven of which decline, probably due to post-maturation degradation. HV 13 B, TDF identified as having homology to fructose- 6 -phosphate- 2 -kinase/ fructose- 2, 6 -biphosphatase, may {{have a role in}} the maintenance of dormancy in barley and probably in other cereals. During the first 5 h of imbibition, there was expression of 24 TDF which was apparently independent of dormancy, revealing putative epi-genetic regulation.

However, the cellular mechanisms involved are unclear in humans. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH This {{study examined the}} effects of serelaxin in co-cultures of human primary endothelial cells (ECs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) on cAMP and cGMP <b>signalling.</b> <b>KEY</b> RESULTS Stimulation of HUVECs or human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs) with serelaxin, concentration-dependently increased cGMP accumulation in co-cultured SMCs {{to a greater extent than}} in monocultures of either cell type. This was not observed in human umbilical artery endothelial cells (HUAECs) that do not express the relaxin receptor, RXFP 1. Treatment of ECs with L-NGnitro arginine (NOARG; 30 μM, 30 min) inhibited serelaxin-mediated (30 nM) cGMP accumulation in HUVECs, HCAECs and cocultured SMCs. In HCAECs, but not HUVECs, pre-incubation with indomethacin (30 μM, 30 min) also inhibited cGMP accumulation in SMCs. Pre-incubation of SMCs with the guanylate cyclase inhibitor ODQ (1 μM, 30 min) had no effect on serelaxinmediated (30 nM) cGMP accumulation in HUVECs and HCAECs but inhibited cGMP accumulation in SMCs. Serelaxin stimulation of HCAECs, but not HUVECs, increased cAMP accumulation concentration-dependently in SMCs. Pre-incubation of HCAECs with indomethacin, but not L-NOARG, abolished cAMP accumulation in co-cultured SMCs, suggesting involvement of prostanoids. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS In co-cultures, treatment of ECs with serelaxin caused marked cGMP accumulation in SMCs and with HCAEC also cAMP accumulation. Responses involved EC-derived NO and with HCAEC prostanoid production. Thus, serelaxin differentially modulates vascular tone in different vascular beds...|$|E

40|$|Background and Purpose: Cyclical {{phosphorylation}} and dephosphorylation {{of a key}} residue {{within the}} C-terminal domain of the activated type 5 metabotropic glutamate (mGlu 5) receptor is believed to cause the synchronous, oscillatory changes in inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate and Ca 2 + levels observed {{in a variety of}} cell types. Here, we have attempted to better define the kinase and phosphatase enzymes involved in this modulation. Experimental Approach: Ca 2 + and [3 H]inositol phosphate ([3 H]IPx) measurements in astrocyte preparations have been used to evaluate the effects of pharmacological inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) and protein phosphatase activities and small interfering RNA-mediated specific PKC isoenzymic knock-down on mGlu 5 receptor <b>signalling.</b> <b>Key</b> Results: Ca 2 + oscillation frequency or [3 H]IPx accumulation in astrocytes stimulated by mGlu 5 receptors, was concentration-dependently decreased by protein phosphatase- 1 / 2 A inhibition or by PKC activation. PKC inhibition also increased [3 H]IPx accumulation two- to threefold and changed the Ca 2 +response into a peak-plateau response. However, selective inhibition of conventional PKC isoenzymes or preventing changes in [Ca 2 +]i concentration by BAPTA-AM loading was without effect on mGlu 5 receptor-stimulated [3 H]IPx accumulation. Selective knock-down of PKCδ was without effect on glutamate-stimulated Ca 2 + responses; however, selective PKCε knock-down in astrocytes changed Ca 2 + responses from oscillatory into peak-plateau type. Conclusion and Implications: These data confirm the acute regulation of mGlu 5 receptor signalling by protein kinases and protein phosphatases and provide novel data pinpointing the isoenzymic dependence of this regulation in the native mGlu 5 receptor-expressing rat cortical astrocyte. These data also highlight a potential alternative mechanism by which mGlu 5 receptor signalling might be therapeutically manipulated...|$|E

Despite increasing studies on the action of silymarin and its major active constituent, silybin in their therapeutic properties against insulin resistance, diabetes and hyperlipidaemia in vitro and in vivo, the mechanism underlying silymarin action remains unclear. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACHC 57 BL/ 6 mice were fed high-fat diet (HFD) for 3 months to induce obesity, insulin resistance, hyperlipidaemia and fatty liver. These mice were then continuously treated with HFD alone or mixed with silymarin at 40 mg/ 100 g for additional 6 weeks. Biochemical analysis was used to test the serum lipid and bile acid profiles. FXR and NF-κB transactivities were analysed in liver using a gene reporter assay based onquantitative RT-PCR. KEY RESULTSSilymarin treatment ameliorated insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia and inflammation, and reconstituted the bile acid pool in liver of diet-induced obesity. Associated with this, silybin and silymarin enhanced FXR transactivity. Consistently, in HepG 2 cells, silybin inhibited NF-κB signalling, which was enhanced by FXR activation.

The establishment of Europol was in essence a political decision and to a large extent the agency has remained a political construct.

The research model she develops for this purpose consists of eras (the pre-Convention, Convention and post-Convention era), clusters (legal basis, objective, competence, tasks, governance and control) and criteria (necessity, consistency, balance and transparency). The three-dimensional model is perfectly suited for a doctoral thesis based on a compilation of peer-reviewed publications (seven in total). This booklet presents the main conclusions, as well as the policy epilogue.

RA synovial fibroblasts (RASF) actively contribute to inflammation and joint destruction in this chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease. In the current study, we investigated the influence of cigarette smoke on the inflammatory and matrix-destructive properties of RASF. Furthermore, the functional role of Sirtuin 6 (SIRT 6) in the regulation of the signalling induced by cigarette smoke or by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) was elucidated. We demonstrated that stimulation with cigarette smoke extract (CSE) enhances the pro-inflammatory and matrix-destructive potential of RASF by inducing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 8 (IL 8) and the matrix-destructive enzyme matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP 1), but not of IL 6 and MMP 3. Moreover, we could show that the expression of MMP 1 is specifically regulated by SIRT 6. Treatment of RASF with CSE or TNFα increased the levels of SIRT 6. The expression of SIRT 6 was also enhanced in vivo in synovial tissues of RA smokers and in joints of mice exposed to cigarette smoke. Silencing of SIRT 6 specifically increased basal as well as CSE- and TNFα-induced production of MMP 1, demonstrating that SIRT 6 {{plays an important role}} in restricting MMP 1 expression. In conclusion, the upregulation of SIRT 6 in RASF under CSE or TNFα stimulation functions as a counterregulatory mechanism attenuating the production of the matrix-destructive enzyme MMP 1.

In this case, wavelet analysis is often very effective because it provides a simple approach for dealing with local aspects of a <b>signal.</b> <b>Key</b> words: Fourier analysis, Wavelet analysi...|$|R
40|$|We analyze a code-division {{multiple}} access technique where information is optically encoded by manipulating the coherence between {{a pair of}} transmitted <b>signals.</b> <b>Key</b> features are intrinsic security, operation of the receiver at only the bit rate of a single channel, and reconfiguration without switching optical delays, which are considerable advantages compared to previously proposed CDMA schemes. Experimental results demonstrating the basic operation of the scheme are presented. The performance limitations are calculated and novel implementations are proposed...|$|R

The phase plane analysis via the critical lines tool allowed to delimit analytically {{the holes in the}} chaotic attractor and to follow their evolution. In addition, the results of the statistical NIST tests for pseudo-randomness showed to be successful and significantly improved after an under-sampling of the output <b>signal.</b> <b>Key</b> words Lozi map, chaotic map, Random Numbe...|$|R
