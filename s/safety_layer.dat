5000|$|The 1718 Transportation Act {{also made}} a felony of {{returning}} goods for a fee, revealing that by then, receiving had already been widely taken to the next stage: returning goods to their owner, for a fee, instead of selling them in the second-hand market. Thieves could act as go-betweens themselves, but go-betweens could raise some suspicions, while relying on receivers added a <b>safety</b> <b>layer</b> against effective prosecution. Victims of theft were often willing to pay, {{in order to get}} back their goods without further troubles. In addition to that, for many centuries, prosecution in England was entirely at the expense (of personal money, time and effort) of the prosecutor. Therefore, also considering the difficulty of actually prove receiving in courts, common people, especially shopkeepers, often preferred compounding, feeling that prosecuting was not worth it. This gave a considerable advantage to receivers.In order to effectively act as go-betweens for compounding, or brokers, fences needed to personally know thieves or have ways to easily interact and bargain with them for a common benefit about compounding: nobody was {{in a better position to}} do so than thief-takers. Thief-takers grew increasingly notorious in England as a reward was introduced by the Crown for each successfully condemned criminal. Some of them, such as Anthony Dunn, publicly referred to as [...] "pretended Thiefe-taker" [...] in a 1707 document, used their social power as thief-takers as an advantage for receiving. Thief-takers were usually so involved with thieves and gangs of thieves that they could easily condemn them for the reward, or use this power to intimidate and command thieves to do their biddings: in exchange of clemency or protection from capture or condemnation, they could have thieves to steal under their command. Indeed, thief-takers could act as direct instigators, supporting their thieves with intelligence or offering them shelter at need (when convenient), and then act as receivers with the stolen goods. Through parallel occupations, receivers could feed their own business.|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} the work of this Cand. scient. thesis has been placed upon {{understanding}} and developing a concept for using digital communication in safety-critical applications. It is increasingly common to use programmable technology in a safety-critical control system. These new software-based components are in many cases replacing existing hard-wired and analogue components that have safety-critical functions. Implementing these software-based safety-critical systems require more in-depth methods and concepts than what traditionally has been used in software engineering. I have concentrated my studies around problems concerned with using fieldbus technology between the subsystems in a software-based safety-critical system. During the work on this thesis I have had to acquire a substantial amount of knowledge about subjects not previously covered in my studies. I have gained knowledge about industrial process control systems, safety-critical systems, international IEC standards for safety systems, various fieldbus technologies, coding theory and hardware related programming. The basic knowledge required to appreciate the contents of this thesis is presented as background information in the introductory chapters. One of the main goals of this thesis has been to analyse and find out if it is possible to implement a safe communications protocol for Foundation Fieldbus fulfilling the stringent requirements of a SIL 3 application. My studies are based on a concept of a general communication protocol called a "Safety Layer. " A <b>safety</b> <b>layer</b> defines methods for increasing the probability of detecting errors that may occur between two communicating fieldbus devices. The safety layer’s objective is to make the transmission "safer" between two nodes in a fieldbus network. This involves enabling the communication parties to determine that messages have the right value, they are sent in the correct sequence and to the right time and have correct origin/destination. In my thesis I have further developed the basic idea behind the <b>safety</b> <b>layer</b> in a general sense so that it can in principle be used on top of any communication protocol to provide safe communication. This study has furthermore been extended with an implementation of a <b>safety</b> <b>layer</b> prototype for Foundation Fieldbus. The purpose of this implementation is to demonstrate how Foundation Fieldbus can be made safer and that the concept and ideas of the general <b>safety</b> <b>layer</b> are feasible. The protocol incorporates a method for enabling two-way communication between two function blocks and new CRCs for improved error detection. The choice of generator polynomials for these CRCs has been based on probabilistic considerations. The <b>safety</b> <b>layer</b> also specifies a communication mode that sanctions transmissions of amounts of data larger that the maximum allowed transmission unit. The implementation of the <b>safety</b> <b>layer</b> is unique in its kind. Similar work has never before been done for Foundation Fieldbus. I do not assume any liability for any accidents, loss or damage caused as a result of any errors or omission in this thesis...|$|E

40|$|In the future, system {{engineers}} of railway {{control systems}} {{have to consider}} digital communication between components more than ever. The number of communicating systems rises steadily, while the offer of commercial off the shelf products for digital transmission networks is also growing. Safety protocols {{be included in the}} architecture in order to guarantee that safety-critical systems could be used on unsafe transmission channels. Safety layers have to detect different types of message errors to grant functional safety. It is highly recommended to prove the specification of a safety protocol with model checking methods to ensure a correct specification. The safety reaction on such errors must be a safe state, which usually stops the communication service until the system is reinitialised or reset by an operator. Therefore a safe communication reduces the fault tolerance against arbitrary transmission errors and lowers the reliability of the communication architecture. To improve the fault tolerance against message errors it is necessary to use a reliable message transmission service before the safety check is executed. A reliable transmission service can be included in the <b>safety</b> <b>layer,</b> in the upper protocol layer of the grey channel or in both layers. A naive combination of fault-tolerance mechanisms in the grey channel and safety layers will not necessarily increase the overall fault-tolerance: if, for example, lost messages in the grey channel lead to retransmissions after timeouts, the message eventually passed to the receiving <b>safety</b> <b>layer</b> may be out-dated and therefore has to be discarded. As a consequence, it is necessary to perform analyses whether the design of safety related communication architectures is safe and reliable.

Case studies of industrial sized communication architectures evaluate this new approach. Besides, the analysis results are used to improve the design...|$|E

A <b>safety</b> supervision <b>layer</b> between the application layer and {{the operating system}} interface is discussed. It {{is an attempt to}} detect operating system and hardware faults in an end-to-end way. Standard POSIX system calls are wrapped by procedures that provide fault detection features. Furthermore, potentials of an additional watchdog module on top of the operating system interface are analyzed. Applications that use the <b>Safety</b> Supervision <b>Layer</b> are notified of detected faults and deal with them by providing specific handlers to bring the fail-safe system to its safe state. The goal of the presented layer is to encapsulate the operating system and hardware layers a safety-critical application resides on, in order to detect faults produced by those and bring the system to a safe state. Advantages of such an attempt are portability, lower time-to-market, higher cost efficiency in building fail-safe systems and – most important – reduced error detection latency compared to usual periodic supervision approaches.

Unfortunately, {{this is not the case}} because each uses its own distinct trajectory predictor and conflict detection algorithm with time frames that overlap. In fast-time simulations, TSAFE made a conflict prediction after an Autoresolver resolution for the same flight pair about 1 percent of the time and for the maneuvered flight about 2 percent of the time. Extending the threshold for predicted time to loss of separation at which Autoresolver could issue maneuvers from the baseline of 8 minutes to 12 minutes reduced the frequency of these cases by at least half with fewer resolutions and less delay and fuel burn while maintaining zero losses of separation. By comparison, increasing the horizontal separation standard for Autoresolver maneuvers from 7 nautical miles to 10 and 12 nautical miles had little to no effect. I...|$|R

The safety analyses addressed system architecture, hardware failure probability, proof test interval, diagnostic coverage, and human error probability.

The performance of the method is validated in outdoor field tests by implementation in real-time on a quadrotor UAS. We demonstrate that the performance of TCM is better than that of a traditional background subtraction technique, as well as a method that employs the Epipolar Constraint Method. Unlike background subtraction, TCM does not generate false alarms due to parallax when a stationary object is at a distance other than that of the background.

This risk of hypoglycemia is a major concern for patients, families, and physicians. The need for an automated system that can alert in the event of severe hypoglycemia is evident. In engineering systems, where there is a risk of malfunction of the primary control system, alert and safety mechanisms are implemented in layers of protection. This concept has been adopted in the proposed system that integrates a hypoglycemia prediction algorithm with a global position system (GPS) locator and short message service such that the current glucose value with the rate of change (ROC) and the location of the subject can be communicated to a predefined list. Furthermore, if the system is linked to the insulin pump, it can suspend the pump or decrease the basal insulin infusion rate to prevent the pending event. The system was evaluated on clinical datasets of glucose tracings from the DexCom Seven® system.

40|$|Traditional type 1 {{diabetes}} therapies {{are prone}} to show poor glucose regulation especially in the postprandial period owing to both physiological and technological limitations. Although a closed-loop controller for glucose regulation has to be tuned to minimize the postprandial excursion and avoid late hypoglycemia, the intrinsic limitations of the problem lead to a trade-off between postprandial peak and late hypoglycemia risk. This paper reveals through an intensive in-silico study with multiple controller tuning combinations that a novel <b>safety</b> <b>layer</b> for glucose controllers, the so-called SAFE loop (Revert et al., 2013), not only reduces the hypoglycemia events but also allows reducing the postprandial glucose excursion, thus breaking the implicit trade-off present in single controllers. The SAFE outer loop monitors the estimated amount of insulin on board, and modifies the control action if it is close to a unique constraint which can be adjusted with clinical criteria. A very challenging test scenario is here implemented including the rate of blood glucose appearance from intakes of mixed meals, diurnal and day-to-day time-varying metabolic changes, inherent drawbacks in sensor and actuator, and other realistic conditions. The results show a significant reduction of hypoglycemia events when SAFE is added, regardless the closed-loop glucose controller, together with a potential postprandial response improvementResearch {{in this area is}} partially supported by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation through grant DPI 2010 - 20764 -C 02, the Government of Catalonia trough grant SGR 00523, and the Argentinean Government (ANPCyT PICT- 2011 - 0888 and 2012 - 0037, CONICET PIP 112 - 2011 - 00361 and UNLP 1164).

WBA is used to identify gaps in the existing safety layers of the railway crossing. Subsequently the gaps can be categorised. To illustrate the layers and their existing gaps the Swiss Cheese Theory has been chosen. In parallel the current status of safety layers is described. The layers identified this way will contribute to the development of MoSiS. In addition to existing layers new layers can be developed and then be added to MoSiS. A comprehensive portfolio of safety layers will be available. It will then be possible to close gaps systematically. Alternative safety concepts – here for a railway crossing as an example – are expected as a result. Further analysis is planned regarding the following questions: Can layers be exchanged? Is it possible to abandon some layers completely without reducing safety? How do new layers that enhance the ratio between safety and economy have to look like? The final result shall be that a portfolio of existing safety layers in the railway system is known and described.

An overview of industrial automation software in general and in the scope of Svenska Kraftnät introduces the subject of software related issues. The thesis focuses on selected properties, which are important for software development to improve the robustness of industrial automation software. Among others, timing is essential due to its importance in real-time applications. An example case of the nuclear power plant Forsmark in Sweden illustrates problems correlated with timing issues and makes the lack of an overall system modelling (including timing) evident. A review of the relevant industrial standards for software development in industrial applications provides a background for various aspects of software compliance to safety requirements. Special attention lies on the standards IEC 61131 and IEC 61499 for industrial software development and their programming and execution model. The presented RTFM framework defines a concurrent model of execution based on tasks and resources together with a timing semantics that was designed from the outset for the development of embedded real-time systems. It can serve as a scheduling and resource management for the run-time environments of industrial applications, while addressing the aforementioned issues. Mappings from the functional layer (IEC 61499 function block networks) and <b>safety</b> <b>layer</b> (PLCopen safety function blocks) to RTFM show the applicability and possibility of using IEC 61499 as an overall, distributed, and hierarchical model. A discussion on options for future work presents choices to pursue {{the second half of the}} PhD studies. Formal methods for program specification and verification open up an interesting path to further increase the robustness of industrial automation software.

40|$|Abstract—Fault {{detection}} determines faultexistence and detecting time. This paper discusses two layered {{fault detection}} methods {{to enhance the}} reliability and <b>safety.</b> Two <b>layered</b> fault detection methods consist of fault detection methods of component level controllers and system level controllers. Component level controllers detect faults by using limit checking, model-based detection, and data-driven detection and system level controllers execute detection by stability analysis which can detect unknown changes. System level controllers compare detection results via stability with fault signals from lower level controllers. This paper addresses fault detection methods via stability and suggests fault detection criteria in nonlinear systems. The fault detection method applies tothe hybrid control unit of a military hybrid electric vehicleso that the hybrid control unit can detect faults of the traction motor...|$|R

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} security of web sites {{and includes a}} practical part about security of cloud services. There are described techniques of web sites security at this paper. Web sites use for its operation the HTTP protocol and more secure web pages use the HTTPS protocol, which also includes a security layer called SSL or TLS. Since the web application can never be safer than the protocol that is used, all the protocols and layers are further discussed in this thesis. Especially their characteristics {{from the perspective of}} safety, principles of their functioning, their security weaknesses and recommendations in order to reduce risks and increase their safety are closer clarified. The theoretical part continues in disquisition of encryption, related to security layers. Then in the same context, it describes the major certification authorities. The next section analyzes the security of cloud computing. The reader learns about the security risks in connection {{with the use of the}} cloud, about standards and legislation. At the end of the theoretical part, trends in the security of cloud computing that we can expect in the coming years are discussed. In the practical part, there could be found attacks against web applications that use both HTTP and HTTPS. Each attack is described in terms of principle and defense techniques against it. This thesis also includes recommendations for proper use of <b>safety</b> <b>layers</b> SSL and TLS which are used on secure web applications. The largest and best known providers of cloud computing from the perspective of securing their services are compared. In this area of IT, there are no borders, so that the world's biggest players are also the biggest in the Czech Republic. Both corporate and private cloud services are explained. For each service, there is a technical description of its security and a preview of safety policy of the organization that operates this service...|$|R
