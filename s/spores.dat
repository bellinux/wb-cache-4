5|$|Gymnopilus flavus, despite also {{appearing}} on land near the Mediterranean, can be differentiated from G.maritimus as it lives among grass, especially Dactylis glomerata, {{and it has}} distinctly smaller <b>spores,</b> typically measuring 5 to 6 by 3.5 to 4.2μm. G.pseudofulgens, also collected in Italy, shows two major morphological differences: it produces smaller mushrooms, and <b>spores</b> that are of a different shape with smaller warts. G.decipiens, another species that grows on sandy soil, again has <b>spores</b> that are markedly different. The American species G. arenicola also favours sandy soil, but has significantly smaller <b>spores</b> than G.maritimus. Two other species of Gymnopilus found around the Mediterranean are G.corsicus and G.spadiceus. G.corsicus has no veil remnants on the stem, and <b>spores</b> that do not turn red in Melzer's reagent or Lugol's iodine, and so can easily be differentiated from G.maritimus. G.spadiceus shows several similarities to G.maritimus, but grows only on pine wood and has rectangular <b>spores.</b>|$|E

5|$|The <b>spores</b> of Myxogastria are haploid, mainly {{round and}} measure between 5µm and 20µm, rarely up to 24µm in diameter.

The typical colour of the spore mass becomes {{visible through the}} structure, since the <b>spores</b> themselves are not pigmented. In some species, especially of the genus Badhamia, the <b>spores</b> produce lumps. The colour, shape and diameter of <b>spores</b> are important characteristics for identifying species.|$|E

5|$|Adiantum viridimontanum largely reproduces asexually by {{branching}} {{rather than}} sexually through <b>spores.</b> While wind-blown <b>spores</b> {{can result in}} sexual reproduction for the species, most <b>spores</b> probably fall within a relatively short radius of the plant. In addition, reproduction through spore dispersal requires the spore to land in suitable conditions for generating a gametophyte, typically in bright sunlight on thin serpentine soils. These requirements allow A.viridimontanum to colonize recently disturbed sites on ultramafic outcrops, where bedrock has been exposed and competing plants have been removed. The populations appear stable, with the long life of individuals compensating for low recruitment rates.|$|E
5|$|Although it has {{not been}} shown {{experimentally}} if the <b>spores</b> can survive the passage through an animal's digestive tract, the regular presence of Cyathus on cow or horse manure strongly suggest that this is true. Alternatively, the hard outer casing of peridioles ejected from splash cups may simply disintegrate over time, eventually releasing the <b>spores</b> within.|$|E
5|$|Both asexual {{and sexual}} <b>spores</b> or sporangiospores are often {{actively}} dispersed by forcible ejection from their reproductive structures. This ejection ensures exit of the <b>spores</b> from the reproductive structures {{as well as}} traveling through the air over long distances. Specialized mechanical and physiological mechanisms, as well as spore surface structures (such as hydrophobins), enable efficient spore ejection. For example, {{the structure of the}} spore-bearing cells in some ascomycete species is such that the buildup of substances affecting cell volume and fluid balance enables the explosive discharge of <b>spores</b> into the air. The forcible discharge of single <b>spores</b> termed ballistospores involves formation of a small drop of water (Buller's drop), which upon contact with the spore leads to its projectile release with an initial acceleration of more than 10,000g; the net result is that the spore is ejected 0.01–0.02cm, sufficient distance for it to fall through the gills or pores into the air below. Other fungi, like the puffballs, rely on alternative mechanisms for spore release, such as external mechanical forces. The bird's nest fungi use the force of falling water drops to liberate the <b>spores</b> from cup-shaped fruiting bodies. Another strategy is seen in the stinkhorns, a group of fungi with lively colors and putrid odor that attract insects to disperse their <b>spores.</b>|$|E

5|$|Coprinellus disseminatus resembles C.impatiens, {{but may be}} {{distinguished}} by its slightly larger fruit body, somewhat deliquescent gills, and tendency to fruit in smaller groups on the ground, rather than on or around rotting wood. Also, C.disseminatus has smaller <b>spores</b> than C.impatiens, typically 6.6–9.7 by 4.1–5.8μm. C.eurysporus is similar to C.disseminatus but usually grows in groups on fallen branches, and has broader <b>spores</b> that measure 8.3–10.3 by 6.7–8.4µm. C.hiascens usually grows in small dense clumps, has narrower <b>spores</b> (typically 9–11 by 4.5–5.5μm, and produces smaller fruit bodies.|$|E
5|$|Cyathus olla has -shaped <b>spores</b> with {{dimensions}} of 10–146–8µm. In 1927, George Willard Martin examined the microscopic features of {{various members of}} the Nidulariaceae family, including Cyathus olla. He noted that in this species, the basidia—spore-bearing cells—are club-shaped or cylindrical and have long stems, and they sometimes have a clamp connection at the basal end of the structure. Basidia typically hold between two and four sessile <b>spores</b> that are directly attached to the basidium, rather than via a sterigma. Revealed only after the spore is separated, a temporary apiculus marks the point of attachment. The <b>spores</b> are generally separated from the basidia when the latter collapse and gelatinize; this basidial breakdown typically occurs simultaneously with a gelatinization of cells lining the inside wall of the peridiole. After separating from the basidia the outer wall of the <b>spores</b> may thicken, although they generally do not increase in size.|$|E
5|$|Distinctive {{features}} of Ramaria botrytis include its large size, the orange, reddish, or purplish branchlets, striate <b>spores</b> with dimensions averaging 13.8 by 4.7µm, and a weak amyloid staining {{reaction of the}} stem tissue. R.rubripermanens has reddish terminal branches, a stout form, and striate <b>spores,</b> but may be distinguished from R.botrytis by its much shorter <b>spores.</b> Other species with which R.botrytis may be confused include: R.formosa, which has branches that are pinker than R.botrytis, and yellow-tipped; R.caulifloriformis, found in the Great Lakes region of the United States, whose branch tips darken with age; R.strasseri, which has yellow to brown branch tips; R.rubrievanescens, which has branches in which the pink color fades after picking or in mature fruit bodies; and R.botrytoides, which is most reliably distinguished from R.botrytis by its smooth <b>spores.</b> The European species R.rielii, often confused with R.botrytis and sometimes considered synonymous, can be distinguished by microscopic characteristics: R.reilii lacks the clamped hyphae of R.botrytis, its <b>spores</b> are longer and wider, and they have warts instead of striations. The North American species R.araiospora, though superficially similar to R.botrytis, has several distinguishing characteristics: it grows under hemlock; it has reddish to magenta branches with orange to yellowish tips; it lacks any discernible odor; it has warted, somewhat cylindrical <b>spores</b> averaging 9.9 by 3.7µm; and it has non-amyloid stem tissue. Uniformly colored bright pink to reddish, R.subbotrytis has <b>spores</b> measuring 7–9 by 3–3.5µm.|$|E
40|$|<b>Spore</b> {{formation}} in Saccharomyces cerevisiae involves the sequential deposition of multiple <b>spore</b> wall layers between the prospore membranes that surround each meiotic product. The Smk 1 p mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase plays {{a critical role}} in <b>spore</b> formation, but the proteins that interact with Smk 1 p to regulate <b>spore</b> morphogenesis have not been described. Using mass spectrometry, we identify Gsc 2 p as a Smk 1 p-associated protein. Gsc 2 p is a 1, 3 -β-glucan synthase subunit involved in synthesizing an inner <b>spore</b> wall layer. We find that 1, 3 -β-glucan synthase activity is elevated in smk 1 mutants, suggesting that SMK 1 negatively regulates GSC 2. Although deposition of the two inner <b>spore</b> wall layers is normal in smk 1 mutants, deposition of the outer layers is aberrant. However, eliminating GSC 2 activity restores normal deposition of the third <b>spore</b> wall layer in smk 1 mutants, indicating that negative regulation of GSC 2 by SMK 1 is important for <b>spore</b> wall deposition. Our findings suggest a model for the coordination of <b>spore</b> wall layer deposition in which Smk 1 p facilitates the transition between early and late phases of <b>spore</b> wall deposition by inhibiting a <b>spore</b> wall-synthesizing enzyme important for early phases of <b>spore</b> wall deposition...|$|R

40|$|The {{peptidoglycan}} cortex of endospores of Bacillus {{species is}} required for maintenance of <b>spore</b> dehydration and dormancy, {{and the structure of}} the cortex may also allow it to function in attainment of <b>spore</b> core dehydration. A significant difference between <b>spore</b> and growing cell peptidoglycan structure is the low degree of peptide cross-linking in cortical peptidoglycan; regulation of the degree of this cross-linking is exerted by d,d-carboxypeptidases. We report here the construction of mutant B. subtilis strains lacking all combinations of two and three of the four apparent d,d-carboxypeptidases encoded within the genome and the analysis of <b>spore</b> phenotypic properties and peptidoglycan structure for these strains.

The <b>spore</b> peptidoglycan of a dacB dacF double mutant was very highly cross-linked, and this structural modification resulted in a failure to achieve normal <b>spore</b> core dehydration and a decrease in <b>spore</b> heat resistance.

5|$|Mature {{specimens}} of Battarrea phalloides roughly resemble the typical agaric mushroom stature of stem and cap. However, {{rather than a}} cap with gills, this species has a spore sac atop the stem. When young, the fruit body is roughly spherical and completely encased in an outer wall (exoperidium) that later splits in a circumscissile fashion (along a circular or equatorial line), the lower wall forming a volva and the upper part forming scales that cover the inner wall. The upper part rolls upward and backward and eventually falls away in one piece, exposing a spore sac lined with a narrow ring of capillitium and <b>spores.</b> The <b>spores</b> are sticky. As these are carried away by the wind, the drying action of the latter cause {{the edges of the}} peridium to shrivel and roll up more, exposing more <b>spores.</b> This is continued until the upper half of the peridium has shriveled and blown away and there remains only a few <b>spores,</b> which may be washed away by rain.|$|E
