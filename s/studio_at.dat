5|$|After {{production}} concluded on Harlem Nights, Bakshi {{wanted to}} distinguish himself artistically by producing a film in which live action and animated characters would interact. Bakshi began writing the screenplay for Hey Good Lookin while editing Coonskin, and storyboarding a proposed series for ABC.

Several African American animators, including graffiti artists, were hired by Bakshi's <b>studio,</b> <b>at</b> a time when black animators were not widely employed by major animation studios. Following controversy over the film Coonskin, some black animators left Bakshi's studio in embarrassment, resulting in production problems for Hey Good Lookin.|$|E

5|$|As a child, Szabó {{wanted to}} be a doctor like his father. By the age of 16, however, he had been {{inspired}} by a book by Hungarian film theorist Béla Balázs to become a film director. Upon graduation from high school, he became one of 11 applicants out of 800 who were admitted to the Academy of Theatrical and Cinematic Arts. At the Academy, he studied with the famous director Félix Máriássy, who became something of a father figure to Szabó. Among his classmates were Judit Elek, Zsolt Kézdi-Kovács, Janos Rozsa, Pál Gábor, Imre Gyöngyössy, Ferenc Kardos, and Zoltán Huszárik. While at the Academy, Szabó directed several short films, culminating in his thesis film, Koncert (1963), which won a prize at the International Short Film Festival Oberhausen. Thanks to János Herskó, head of the Hunnia Film <b>Studio</b> <b>at</b> which he apprenticed, Szabó was given his first opportunity to direct a feature film at the age of 25, rather than being required to spend ten years working as an assistant director.|$|E
5|$|His first {{mainstream}} {{success was}} the 1976 album Oxygène. Recorded {{in a makeshift}} <b>studio</b> <b>at</b> his home, the album sold an estimated 12million copies. Oxygène was followed in 1978 by Équinoxe, and in 1979, Jarre performed to a record-breaking audience {{of more than a}} million people at the Place de la Concorde, a record he has since broken three times. More albums were to follow, but his 1979 concert served as a blueprint for his future performances around the world. Several of his albums have been released to coincide with large-scale outdoor events, and he is now perhaps as well known as a performer as he is as a musician.|$|E
5|$|In March 2004 Kelly {{performed}} across North America, including New York, Boston, Chicago, Seattle, and Los Angeles.

Foggy Highway was a second bluegrass-oriented album for Kelly, credited to Paul Kelly and the Stormwater Boys and issued in 2005. It peaked at No.23 on the ARIA albums charts. The line-up {{for the majority of the}} tracks was Kelly, Mick Albeck (fiddle), James Gillard (bass guitar), Rod McCormack (guitar), Ian Simpson (banjo), and Trev Warner (mandolin).

5|$|Jackson had {{initially}} desired {{to become a}} horse racing jockey or entertainment lawyer, with plans to support herself through acting. Despite this, she was anticipated {{to pursue a career}} in entertainment, and considered the idea after recording herself in the <b>studio.</b> <b>At</b> age seven, Jackson performed at the Las Vegas Strip at the MGM Casino and began acting in the variety show The Jacksons in 1976. The year after, she was selected to have a starring role as Penny Gordon Woods in the sitcom Good Times. She later starred in A New Kind of Family before joining the cast of Diff'rent Strokes, portraying Charlene Duprey for two years. Jackson also played the recurring role of Cleo Hewitt during the fourth season of Fame, but expressed indifference towards the series. When Jackson was sixteen, she was arranged a contract with A Records and began recording her debut album with the assistance of her father, working with a number of songwriters and producers such as René Moore, Angela Winbush and Bobby Watson.|$|E
5|$|Kirkland cites his {{assistant}} director Matthew Nastuk {{as a big}} influence on the episode. He became heavily involved with the animation because {{he had grown up}} in New Jersey, where the Thomas Edison National Historical Park that Homer and Bart visit is located. To help make the museum look as authentic as possible, Kirkland and Nastuk visited it and took a large number of photographs that they brought back to the animation <b>studio.</b> <b>At</b> one point in the episode, Homer writes complex math formulas on a chalkboard. The producers wanted them to be actual formulas, so writer David X. Cohen got in contact with a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who were able to provide them.|$|E
5|$|Make Way for Ducklings, {{published}} in 1941, was McCloskey's second book {{and was the}} winner of the Caldecott Medal in 1942. In his acceptance speech, McCloskey explained his motivation for the story. While attending the Vesper George Art School in the early 1930s, he would spend time in the Public Garden feeding the ducks. After some time away, he returned to Boston to paint a mural and created a draft of the book after inspiration from May Massee. To better illustrate the story, McCloskey spent time at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, visited an ornithologist, and eventually brought home for models six ducklings to live in his <b>studio</b> <b>at</b> 280 West 12th Street, apartment 4C, in New York's West Village.|$|E
