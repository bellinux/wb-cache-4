25|$|Epitope spreading, {{also known}} as {{determinant}} spreading, is another common way in which autoimmunity can occur which uses the molecular mimicry mechanism. Autoreactive T cells are activated de novo by self epitopes released secondary to pathogen-specific T cell-mediated bystander damage. T cell responses to progressively less dominant epitopes are activated {{as a consequence of}} the release of other antigens secondary to the destruction of the pathogen with a homologous immunodominant sequence. Thus, inflammatory responses induced by specific pathogens that trigger pro-inflammatory Th1 responses have the ability to persist in genetically susceptible hosts. This may lead to organ-specific autoimmune disease. Conversely, epitope spreading could be due to target antigens being physically linked intracellularly as members of a complex to <b>self</b> <b>antigen.</b> The result of this is an autoimmune response that is triggered by exogenous antigen that progresses to a truly autoimmune response against mimicked <b>self</b> <b>antigen</b> and other antigens. From these examples, it is clear that the search for candidate mimic epitopes must extend beyond the immunodominant epitopes of a given autoimmune response.|$|E

Autoimmunity is evoked when this tolerance to <b>self</b> <b>antigen</b> is broken. Tolerance within an individual is normally evoked as a fetus. This is known as maternal-fetal tolerance where B cells expressing receptors specific for a particular antigen enter the circulation of the developing fetus via the placenta.|$|E

In 2007 low MHC diversity was attributed a role in disease susceptibility in the Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii), native to the isolated island of Tasmania, such that an antigen of a transmissible tumor, involved in devil facial tumour disease, appears {{to be recognized as}} a <b>self</b> <b>antigen.</b> To offset inbreeding, efforts to sustain genetic diversity in populations of endangered species and of captive animals have been suggested.|$|E

In this study, we utilized a pharmacologic inhibitor that blocks T cell egress from the lymphoid tissues, antibiotics, and germ-free animals to examine the role of commensal and <b>self</b> <b>antigens.</b> The results suggest that T cell proliferation under lymphopenic conditions is a heterogeneous process triggered by both exogenous commensal and endogenous <b>self</b> <b>antigens...</b>|$|R
50|$|During {{maturation}} in {{the bone}} marrow, B cells are tested for interaction with <b>self</b> <b>antigens,</b> which is called negative selection. If the maturing B cells strongly interact with these <b>self</b> <b>antigens,</b> they undergo death by apoptosis. Negative selection is important to avoid the production of B cells that could cause autoimmune diseases. They can avoid apoptosis by modifying the sequence of light chain V and J genes (components of the antigen receptor) so {{that it has a}} different specificity and may not recognize <b>self</b> <b>antigens</b> anymore. This process of changing the specificity of the immature B cell receptor is called receptor editing.|$|R

2500|$|One {{essential}} way galectins regulate apoptosis is {{to control}} {{positive and negative}} selection of T cells in the thymus.

T cell death is also necessary to kill activated and infected T cells after an immune response. This is also mediated by galectin-1 and galectin-9. Galectin-1 binds many proteins on the T cell surface, but specifically CD7, CD43 and CD45 are involved in apoptosis.|$|E
2500|$|Molecular mimicry {{has been}} {{characterized}} {{as recently as the}} 1970s as another mechanism by which a pathogen can generate autoimmunity. Molecular mimicry is defined as similar structures shared by molecules from dissimilar genes or by their protein products. Either the linear amino acid sequence or the conformational fit of the immunodominant epitope may be shared between the pathogen and host. This is also known as [...] "cross-reactivity" [...] between <b>self</b> <b>antigen</b> of the host and immunodominant epitopes of the pathogen. An autoimmune response is then generated against the epitope. Due to similar sequence homology in the epitope between the pathogen and the host, cells and tissues of the host associated with the protein are destroyed {{as a result of the}} autoimmune response.|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which T cells are tolerized to <b>self</b> <b>antigens</b> are unknown (1 - 3). It is known that most T lymphocytes only react to foreign antigens presented {{in the context of}} determinants encoded within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) ~ (4). One possible explanation for the existence of MHC restrictions is that such T lymphocytes do not recognize nominal (i. e. non-MHC encoded) antigens per se, but rather recognize an antigenic complex composed of nominal antigen plus an MHC-encoded determinant. From this perspective, T cell tolerance to nominal <b>self</b> <b>antigens</b> could not result from the deletion of T cell clones that recognize and bind <b>self</b> <b>antigens</b> directly, but would have to result from the deletion of clones with specificity for complexes composed of nominal <b>self</b> <b>antigens</b> + self-MHC (5). Thus, T cell tolerance to nominal <b>self</b> <b>antigens,</b> like T cell reactivity to nominal foreign antigens, would be MHC restricted. In contrast, if individual T ceils express two distinct recognition specificities, one for nominal antigens and one for MHC determinants, it is conceivable that T cells might be tolerized by recognition of nominal antigen...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: It is {{well known}} that {{oxidative}} stress can induce production of free radicals that can modify proteins. The hy-pothesis presented here is that the target antigens in autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes mellitus, are not normal self proteins but rather self proteins that have been altered by free radicals, produced as a result of oxidative stress in the target cells. The observation that disease often occurs only in a single tissue, even when other tissues contain the same an-tigen, could be explained if both the presence of the antigen and severe oxidative stress is required, before tissue destruc-tion occurs. Furthermore, the cyclic nature of tissue destruction and problems with detecting robust high affinity autoreac-tivity to <b>self</b> <b>antigens</b> may be easier to understand if we presume that pathological autoreactivity is targeting redox-modified <b>self</b> <b>antigens,</b> while assays to unmodified self only measure its cross-reactivity to normal <b>self</b> <b>antigens.</b> BACKGROUND Autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM 1) are believed to result from the failure of immu-nological tolerance to protein <b>self</b> <b>antigens.</b> It has been pro-posed that alterations in <b>self</b> <b>antigens</b> could initiate the proc-ess of autoimmunity [1, 2].

In vivo, IgE-binding <b>self</b> <b>antigens</b> are able to elicit strong type I reactions in sensitized individuals and, {{in the case of}} human manganese superoxide dismutase, to elicit eczematous reactions on healthy skin areas of patients suffering from atopic eczema. The reactions against <b>self</b> <b>antigens</b> sharing structural homology with environmental allergens can be plausibly explained by molecular mimicry between common B cell epitopes. For the second class of IgE-binding <b>self</b> <b>antigens</b> without sequence homology to known allergens, it is still unclear if the structures are able to induce a B cell switch to IgE production, or if the reactivity is due to sequence similarity shared with not yet detected environmental allergens. However, in all cases, cross-reactivity is never complete, indicating either a lower affinity of IgE antibodies to self allergens than to the homologous environmental allergens or the presence of additional B cell epitopes {{on the surface of the}} environmental allergens, or both. Increasing evidence shows that self allergens could play a decisive role in the exacerbation of long-lasting atopic diseases. However, the only observation supporting a clinical role of IgE-mediated autoreactivity is confined to the fact that IgE levels against <b>self</b> <b>antigens</b> correlate with disease severity. 2007 S.

2500|$|Autoimmunity {{can thus}} be defined simply as {{exceptions}} to the tolerance [...] "rules." [...] By doing this, an immune response is generated against self-tissue and cells. These mechanisms are known {{by many to be}} intrinsic. However, there are pathogenic mechanisms for the generation of autoimmune disease. Pathogens can induce autoimmunity by polyclonal activation of B or T cells, or increased expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I or II molecules. There are several ways in which a pathogen can cause an autoimmune response. A pathogen may contain a protein that acts as a mitogen to encourage cell division, thus causing more B or T cell clones to be produced. Similarly, a pathogenic protein may act as a superantigen which causes rapid polyclonal activation of B or T cells. Pathogens can also cause the release of cytokines resulting in the activation of B or T cells, or they can alter macrophage function. Finally, pathogens may also expose B or T cells to cryptic determinants, which are <b>self</b> <b>antigen</b> determinants that have not been processed and presented sufficiently to tolerize the developing T cells in the thymus and are presented at the periphery where the infection occurs.|$|E

5000|$|The {{recognition}} of a mature T cell to this <b>self</b> <b>antigen</b> should not induce an immune response. During thymic selection occurring in the thymus, only a thymocyte TCR that recognizes either class I or class II MHC molecule plus peptide should survive positive selection. However, there is death by apoptosis of thymocytes that do not interact with MHC molecules or have high-affinity receptors for self MHC plus <b>self</b> <b>antigen</b> a process referred to as negative selection. Therefore, the process {{of positive and negative}} selection means fewer self-reactive mature T cells will leave the thymus and lead to autoimmune problems.|$|E

40|$|Autoimmune {{diseases}} are often marked by autoantibodies binding to <b>self</b> <b>antigens.</b> However, many healthy persons also manifest autoantibodies that bind to <b>self</b> <b>antigens,</b> known as natural autoantibodies. In order to characterize natural autoantibodies present at birth, we used an antigen microarray (antigen chip) to analyze informatically (with clustering algorithms and correlation mapping) the natural IgM, IgA, and IgG autoantibody repertoires present in 10 pairs of sera from healthy mothers and the cords of their newborn babies. These autoantibodies {{were found to}} bind to 305 different, mostly self, molecules. We report that in utero, humans develop IgM and IgA autoantibodies to relatively uniform sets of self molecules. The global patterns of maternal IgM autoantibodies significantly diverged from those at birth, although certain reactivities remained common to both maternal and cord samples. Because maternal IgG antibodies (unlike IgM and IgA) cross the placenta, maternal and cord IgG autoantibodies showed essentially identical reactivities. We found that some <b>self</b> <b>antigens</b> that bind cord autoantibodies were among the target <b>self</b> <b>antigens</b> associated with autoimmune diseases later in life.

There are millions of B and T cells created in the bone marrow and thymus, respectively. Each of these lymphocytes express specificity to a particular epitope, or the part of an antigen to which B cell and T cell receptors recognize and bind. There is a large diversity of epitopes recognized and, as a result, it is possible for some B and T lymphocytes to develop with the ability to recognize self. B and T cells are presented with <b>self</b> <b>antigen</b> after developing receptors while they are still in the primary lymphoid organs. Those cells that demonstrate a high affinity for this <b>self</b> <b>antigen</b> are often subsequently deleted so they cannot create progeny, which helps protect the host against autoimmunity.

50|$|This clonal {{deletion}} of T {{cells in}} the thymus cannot eliminate every potentially self-reactive T cell; T cells that recognize proteins only found at other sites in the body or only at certain times of development (e.g. after puberty) must be inactivated in the periphery.

We studied the autoimmune potential of T lymphocytes immunologically ignorant of viral <b>antigens</b> acting as <b>self</b> <b>antigens</b> {{and whether the}} host defense molecule IFN-gamma could stimulate these cells to cytotoxic competency. For this purpose, we produced double transgenic mice expressing pancreatic IFN-gamma as well as lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) nucleoprotein (NP) or glycoprotein (GP) antigen. 100 % of the NP+/IFN-gamma+ mice became diabetic before 2 mo of age, while none of the NP single transgenic littermates and only 10 % of IFN-gamma single transgenic littermates did. Strikingly, NP+/IFN-gamma+ mice spontaneously developed cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity on LCMV-infected targets and vaccinia virus-NP-infected ones without prior LCMV infection but NP+/IFN-gamma- mice did not, which indicates specific sensitization to the viral antigen by IFN-gamma. These results suggest that lymphocytes ignorant of <b>self</b> <b>antigens</b> can be activated by IFN-gamma released after immunologic stimulation such as viral infection.

50|$|The MiHAs {{bound to}} a MHC {{presented}} {{on a cell}} surface may {{be recognized as a}} self peptide or not recognized by either CD8+ or CD4+ T cells. The lack of recognition of a T cell to this <b>self</b> <b>antigen</b> is the reason why allogeneic stem cell transplantation for an HLA matched gene or a developing fetus’s MiHAs during pregnancy may not be recognized by T cells and marked as foreign leading to an immune response. Although B cell receptors can also recognize MHCs, immune responses seem to only be elicited by T cells. The consequences of an immune response are seen in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) when the peptides encoded by polymorphic genes differ between the recipient and the donor T cells. As a result, the donor T cells can target the recipients cells called graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Although graft or bone marrow rejection can have detrimental effects, there are immunotherapy benefits when cytotoxic T lymphocytes are specific for a <b>self</b> <b>antigen</b> and can target antigens expressed selectively on leukemic cells in order to destroy these tumor cells referred to as graft-versus- leukemia effect (GVL).|$|E
