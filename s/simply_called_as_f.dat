40|$|Abstract — In the {{wireless}} networks, {{there is the}} problem of spectrum inefficiency and spectrum scarcity. The above problems can be solved by introducing the cognitive radio (CR) technology. Cognitive radio can be <b>simply</b> <b>called</b> <b>as</b> intelligent radio that self-detects the available channels in {{the wireless}} spectrum. The CR networks have the functionalities such as spectrum sharing, spectrum sensing, spectrum mobility and spectrum management. In this paper, we discuss the spectrum mobility in the CR networks (CRN), Spectrum handoff mechanism using fuzzy logic. For the channel representation, it is essential to discuss the artificial neural networks (ANN) concept. In this paper we addressed the fuzzy logic concept to solve the spectrum handoff issues in CR network...|$|R
