25|$|The steppe {{has long}} been {{depicted}} as the typical Russian landscape. It is a broad band of treeless, grassy plains, interrupted by mountain ranges, extending from Hungary across Ukraine, southern Russia, and Kazakhstan before ending in Manchuria. Most of the Soviet Union's <b>steppe</b> <b>zone</b> was located in the Ukrainian and Kazakh republics; the much smaller Russian steppe is located mainly between those nations, extending southward between the Black and Caspian Seas before blending into the increasingly desiccated territory of the Republic of Kalmykia. In a country of extremes, the <b>steppe</b> <b>zone</b> provides the most favorable conditions for human settlement and agriculture because of its moderate temperatures and normally adequate levels of sunshine and moisture. Even here, however, agricultural yields are sometimes adversely affected by unpredictable levels of precipitation and occasional catastrophic droughts. The soil is very dry.|$|E

25|$|The Sintashta culture {{emerged from}} the {{interaction}} of two antecedent cultures. Its immediate predecessor in the Ural-Tobol steppe was the Poltavka culture, {{an offshoot of the}} cattle-herding Yamnaya horizon that moved east into the region between 2800 and 2600 BCE. Several Sintashta towns were built over older Poltovka settlements or close to Poltovka cemeteries, and Poltovka motifs are common on Sintashta pottery. Sintashta material culture also shows the influence of the late Abashevo culture, a collection of Corded Ware settlements in the forest <b>steppe</b> <b>zone</b> north of the Sintashta region that were also predominantly pastoralist. Allentoft et al. (2015) also found close autosomal genetic relationship between peoples of Corded Ware culture and Sintashta culture.|$|E
25|$|Long {{associated}} with traditional images of Russian landscape and cossacks on horseback are the steppes, which are treeless, grassy plains. Although they covered only 15 percent of Soviet territory, the steppes were home to roughly 44 {{percent of the}} population. They extend for 4,000 kilometers from the Carpathian Mountains in the western Ukrainian Republic across most of the northern portion of the Kazakh Republic in Soviet Central Asia, between the taiga and arid zones, occupying a relatively narrow band of plains whose chernozem soils {{are some of the}} most fertile on earth.

25|$|Syria {{is located}} in Southwestern Asia, north of the Arabian Peninsula, at {{the eastern end of}} the Mediterranean Sea. It is bordered by Turkey to the north, Lebanon and Israel to the west and southwest, Iraq to the east, and Jordan to the south. It {{consists}} of mountain ranges in the west and a steppe area inland. In the east is the Syrian Desert and in the south is the Jabal al-Druze Range. The former is bisected by the Euphrates valley. A dam built in 1973 on the Euphrates created a reservoir named Lake Assad, the largest lake in Syria. The highest point in Syria is Mount Hermon (2,814 m; 9,232ft) on the Lebanese border. Between the humid Mediterranean coast and the arid desert regions lies a semiarid <b>steppe</b> <b>zone</b> extending across three-quarters of the country, which receives hot, dry winds blowing across the desert. Syria is extensively depleted, with 28 percent of the land arable, 4 percent dedicated to permanent crops, 46 percent utilized as meadows and pastures, and only 3 percent forest and woodland.|$|E

500|$|With the {{disintegration}} of the Golden Horde after the death of Öz Beg Khan in 1341, both Poland and Hungary started to expand towards the <b>steppe</b> <b>zone</b> in the 1340s. Casimir III of Poland invaded the Principality of Halych already in 1340. Two 14th-century chronicles—one by John of Küküllő and the other by an anomymous Minorite friar—say that King Louis I of Hungary dispatched Andrew Lackfi, Count of the Székelys, to lead an army of Székely warriors against the Mongols who had made raids in Transylvania. Lackfi and his army inflicted a crushing defeat upon a large Mongol army on 2 February 1345. The Székelys again invaded the [...] "land of the Tatars" [...] in 1346. According to both chronicles, the Mongols withdrew as far as the Dniester after their defeats. Archaeological research shows that forts were erected at Baia, Siret, Piatra Neamț and Târgu Trotuș in the late 1340s.|$|E

40|$|The paper evaluates {{technical}} {{solutions and}} two main tapes of index-based insurance: area yield insurance and weather-based index insurance regarding their efficiency in reducing climatic risks of Russian {{farms in the}} <b>steppes</b> <b>zone.</b> The analysis considers area yield insurance at two levels of aggregation - oblast and rayon (county) level. Weather-based index insurance products are drawn up by combining two weather parameters - daily precipitation and daily average air temperature. We employ yield and weather data of an experimental station in the Central Volga Russia for the period from 1979 to 2000. In addition experts' assessments are used to specify alternative levels of production technology and respective yield distributions for the considered region. To assess utilityefficiency of the defined insurance products a programming model were formulated for 22 states of nature and 3 levels of the decision-maker risk aversion. The model estimation results show that area yield insurance based on oblast and rayon yields stabilize farm income mostly efficiently. The weather-based index insurance follows immediately after. So, both index-based insurance types provide the considered farm with a higher utility than farm yield insurance with deductibles. This points at a high potential of index-based insurance as an instrument reducing climatic risk of Russian farms situated in the <b>steppes</b> <b>zone.</b> Risk-management instruments, climatic risk, index-based crop insurance, utility efficiency programming model, Russia, Risk and Uncertainty,...|$|R

30|$|The {{temperate}} and <b>steppe</b> <b>zones</b> of East Europe are a breadbasket for a {{large part}} of Northern Eurasia (Swinnen et al. 2017). However, under pressure of growing population, the nations of these zones will need to invest in climate-smart agricultural techniques to sustain or continue to improve agricultural yields and livestock production given forecasted climate change. “Climate-smart” agricultural systems are resilient to climate change and offer carbon and GHG emissions mitigation potential without compromising productivity, food security, and the livelihoods of those working in the agricultural sector. So far, Iizumi and Ramankutty (2016) found that statistically significant increases in wheat yields in Ukraine were explained by improved agro-climatic conditions, i.e., warmer and longer growing seasons, and not by management strategies.|$|R
