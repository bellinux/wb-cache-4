25|$|During a tag team {{match on}} April 3, 1983 {{he was injured}} by Dynamite Kid; two days later, {{he was forced to}} vacate the NWA World Junior Heavyweight title after it became clear that he would need time off to recuperate. However, once the {{determined}} Tiger Mask recovered, he regained his NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship by defeating Kuniaki Kobayashi on June 2, 1983, making him a simultaneous NWA/WWF Jr. champion for the second time. By 1983, however, Sayama <b>started</b> <b>feeling</b> dissatisfied as he hated the politics behind-the-scenes. As a result, he announced his retirement from active competition on August 12, 1983. It was a shock to the wrestling world, as Tiger Mask was going to retire while he {{was at the top of}} his game and as the holder of two Junior Heavyweight Championships. Both titles were declared vacant, as he became a trainer to martial arts fighters.|$|E
25|$|In interviews, Zevon {{described}} a lifelong phobia {{of doctors and}} said he seldom received medical assessment. Shortly before playing at the Edmonton Folk Music Festival in 2002, he <b>started</b> <b>feeling</b> dizzy and developed a chronic cough. After a period of suffering with pain and shortness of breath, Zevon was encouraged by his dentist to see a physician; {{he was diagnosed with}} pleural mesothelioma, a cancer that affects the pleura, a thin membrane around the lungs and chest lining. Although Zevon never revealed where he may have been exposed to asbestos, his son, Jordan, suggests that it came from Zevon's childhood, playing in the attic of his father's carpet store in Arizona. Refusing treatments he believed might incapacitate him, Zevon instead began recording his final album, The Wind, which includes performances by close friends including Bruce Springsteen, Don Henley, Jackson Browne, Timothy B. Schmit, Joe Walsh, David Lindley, Billy Bob Thornton, Emmylou Harris, Tom Petty, Dwight Yoakam, and others. At the request of the music television channel VH1, the documentarian Nick Read was given access to the sessions; his cameras recorded a man who retained his mordant sense of humor, even as his health was deteriorating.|$|E

500|$|The {{recording}} sessions {{ran from}} January to March 2005, {{with only two}} and a half weeks being spent on the acoustic record. Forty tracks were recorded – fifteen of them acoustic – with half of them ending on the final track list. Studio 606 was not finished as the band moved in, and the bandmembers even helped with the final stages of construction, [...] "hammering, stuffing insulation — doing whatever to speed the process." [...] Eight of the rock songs were last-minute compositions done after the acoustic record was finished, as [...] "Dave <b>started</b> <b>feeling</b> that it was better than the rock record." [...] The songs were recorded on analog tape—which was reused over and over due to a tape shortage and a desire to save money—before being transferred to Pro Tools for overdubs, editing and mixing. Raskulinecz mixed the rock songs, while Elliot Scheiner mixed the stereo and 5.1 versions of the acoustic sides.|$|E
500|$|Kemper {{then left}} the scene in Hallett's car, driving eastward, leaving California and through Nevada and Utah. He arrived in Pueblo, Colorado and, after not hearing any news on the radio about the murders {{of his mother and}} Hallett, found a phone booth and called the police. He confessed to the murders of his mother and Hallett, but the police did not take his call seriously and told him to call back at a later time. Several hours later, Kemper called again asking to speak to an officer he {{personally}} knew. Kemper then confessed to that officer of killing his mother and Hallett, and waited in his car for the police to arrive, arrest him and take him into custody, where he then also confessed to the murders of the six students. When asked after his arrest what motivated him to turn himself in, Kemper said: [...] "The original purpose was gone... It wasn't serving any physical or real or emotional purpose. It was just a pure waste of time... Emotionally, I couldn't handle it much longer. Toward the end there, I <b>started</b> <b>feeling</b> the folly of the whole damn thing, and at the point of near exhaustion, near collapse, I just said to hell with it and called it all off." ...|$|E

500|$|MercyMe's {{lead singer}} Bart Millard wrote [...] "Word of God Speak" [...] while touring {{in support of}} their single [...] "I Can Only Imagine". The travel was exhausting, and Millard commented in an {{interview}} that, {{on one of the}} nights on tour, he [...] "went to bed just really frustrated... It <b>started</b> <b>feeling</b> like everything I was saying was the same. I just thought, I have nothing else to say. So I went to bed with that on my mind". After falling asleep, Millard woke up {{early in the morning and}} wrote several lines to the song in his journal before going back to sleep. Several weeks later, he was searching through his journal and found the notes again; when he went to the band's studio, he showed the notes to his producer, Pete Kipley. The two finished the lyrics to the song in less than thirty minutes, and recorded the piano track the same night; they also brought in someone to compose a string track for the song. Millard wanted [...] "Word of God Speak" [...] to contain only piano, avoiding the big production that could assure the song success on the radio, as he felt the simple production would mirror the lyrics.|$|E
500|$|The {{time period}} of {{recording}} was a high-point in musical style for both Joey and Johnny, though they directed their sound towards {{different styles of}} music: Joey's inspiration by pop music became evident in his writing, while Johnny's keenness of hard-rock guitar riffs are apparent in much of his performing on the album. Johnny thought that this did not result well for the band's sound, saying: [...] "I knew going in {{that this was not}} going to be the type of album I wanted. It really could have used another two of three punk songs...All I [...] want to do is keep our fans happy and not sell out. I'm fighting within the band. They are trying to [...] go lighter, looking for ways to be more commercial. I'm against the band for doing that." [...] Joey countered Johnny's point of preventing the band from selling out by explaining: [...] "By Road to Ruin [...] End of the Century, I was doing the majority of the songwriting. I <b>started</b> <b>feeling</b> that the Ramones were faceless; there were no individual identities in the band." [...] He went on to say that this method worked well in the beginning of their career, but would later annoy Joey since [...] "everything [...] wrote, the band would take credit for." ...|$|E
500|$|In the anime {{adaptation}} of Rurouni Kenshin, Watsuki's designs were {{combined with the}} voice talents of voice actress Mayo Suzukaze. She said that she <b>started</b> <b>feeling</b> like Kenshin after years of work as his voice, but says that providing the voice for his character {{was one of her}} best experiences. In producing the English dub version of the series, Media Blasters considered following suit, with Mona Marshall considered a finalist to voice Kenshin. Richard Hayworth was eventually selected for the role, giving Kenshin's character a more masculine voice in the English adaptation. Marshall was also selected to voice the younger Kenshin during flashback scenes. Clark Cheng, Media Blasters dub script writer, said that localizing Kenshin's unusual speech was a difficult process. His use of de gozaru and oro were not only character trademarks that indicated his state of mind, but important elements to the story. However, neither is directly translatable into English, and in the end the company chose to replace de gozaru with [...] "that I did," [...] "that I am," [...] or [...] "that I do." [...] Kenshin's signature oro was replaced with [...] "huah" [...] to simulate a [...] "funny sound" [...] that had no real meaning. Daryl Surat of Otaku USA said that the grammar in Kenshin's dialogue in the Media Blasters dub and subtitles resemble the grammar in the dialogue of Yoda, a character in Star Wars.|$|E

It was obviously the saddest time of my life but those last weeks were maybe some of the most beautiful. It {{gave me a chance to}} say thank you and goodbye. After a while I realised how lucky I was to do that. It's far harder if a parent is taken away before you have that time together. So his death put cricket in perspective for me. It's just a game – and a very simple game if you keep your mind straight.|$|E

Pu Tong Seal increased the size of a food storage unit known as “Beam” by sitting inside during the construction, and having it built as tall as he was, because of dissatisfaction with the previous size. His subjects from a particular administered unit (part of the province) believed that this “Beam” was too large for them to use as a measurement for collecting crops from each household of the surrounding villages, so they made a secret plan. They arranged a big feast in honor of Pu Tong Seal with many delicacies.

[...] After several years, Ibrahim became a young man. He still could not believe that his people were worshipping the statues. He laughed whenever he saw them entering the temple, lowering their heads, silently offering the statues the best of their food, crying and asking forgiveness from them.

[...] On September 25, 2010, the Rangers placed Redden on waivers in part due to the defenceman's declining play. The move also allowed the Rangers to fit under salary cap.

The album contained one of the many songs that Whitley had a hand in writing in his years at Tree Publishing, [...] "It's All Coming Back to Me Now". Also on the album was a remake of Lefty Frizzell's classic standard [...] "I Never Go Around Mirrors," [...] and the song became a huge hit at Whitley's concerts.
