5|$|The {{currency}} {{of the islands}} during Venetian rule was the Venetian lira, as in Venice. There was a special issue for the Islands; the observe <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> has the complete or shertened inscription CORFU/CEFALONIA/ZANTE in three lines. The reserve depicts the winged and haloed lion of Saint Marc in a front view, holding {{the book of the}} Gospel in his fore-paws. The Ionian Islands formed part of the Venetian maritime trade route to the Orient.|$|E
5|$|The {{grounds of}} Taunton Castle include the Somerset County Museum and The Castle Hotel, which {{incorporates}} the Castle Bow archway. Together with the municipal buildings {{they form a}} three-sided group of buildings just beyond the Castle Bow archway from Fore Street. The centre of the square {{is used as a}} car park, and a plain brick edifice of Mecca Bingo hall makes up the west <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|Beringia {{received}} more moisture and intermittent maritime cloud cover {{from the north}} Pacific Ocean {{than the rest of}} the Mammoth steppe, including the dry environments on either <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Moisture occurred along a north-south gradient with the south receiving the most cloud cover and moisture due to the airflow from the North Pacific. This moisture supported a shrub-tundra habitat that provided an ecological refugium for plants and animals. In this Beringian refugium, eastern Beringia's vegetation included isolated pockets of larch and spruce forests with birch and alder trees. This environment supported large herbivores that were prey for Beringian wolves and their competitors. Steppe bison (Bison priscus), Yukon horse (Equus lambei), woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius), and Wild yak (Bos mutus) consumed grasses, sedges, and herbaceous plants. Caribou (Rangifer tarandus) and woodland muskox (Symbos cavifrons) consumed tundra plants, including lichen, fungi, and mosses.|$|E
5|$|The first {{street in}} Elba was Manilla Street. Company houses were {{constructed}} on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{station is}} a side {{platform}} station with a passenger bridge crossing {{at the north}} and exits to both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
50|$|At {{the eastern}} end of Mexican Street there is a small granite culvert with early granite kerbing and {{channeling}} located on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
5|$|More {{problematic}} {{are those}} {{cases where the}} movement of the Sun at different times and seasons causes light and shadow interactions with petroglyphs. A widely known example is the Sun Dagger of Fajada Butte at which a glint of sunlight passes over a spiral petroglyph. The location of a dagger of light on the petroglyph varies throughout the year. At the summer solstice a dagger can be seen through the heart of the spiral; at the winter solstice two daggers appear to either <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> It is proposed that this petroglyph was created to mark these events. Recent studies have identified many similar sites in the US Southwest and Northwestern Mexico. It has been argued that the number of solstitial markers at these sites provides statistical evidence that they were intended to mark the solstices. The Sun Dagger site on Fajada Butte in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico, stands out for its explicit light markings that record all the key events of both the solar and lunar cycles: summer solstice, winter solstice, equinox, and the major and minor lunar standstills of the moon’s 18.6 year cycle. In addition at two other sites on Fajada Butte, there are five light markings on petroglyphs recording the summer and winter solstices, equinox and solar noon. Numerous buildings and interbuilding alignments of the great houses of Chaco Canyon and outlying areas are oriented to the same solar and lunar directions that are marked at the Sun Dagger site.|$|E
5|$|On {{the east}} coast are Goat Cave and Clamshell Cave. The latter is 10m high, about 6m wide at the entrance, and some 45m long, and on one <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> the ridges of basalt stand out like the ribs of a ship. Near this cave is the {{pyramidal}} rock islet of Am Buachaille ('The Herdsman'), a pile of basalt columns seen fully only at low tide. Other outlying rocks include Eilean Dubh to the north-west {{and a series of}} skerries stretching for half a kilometre to the south-west. On the southwest shore are Boat Cave and Mackinnon's Cave (named after a 15th-century abbot of Iona), which has a tunnel connecting it to Cormorant Cave. These caves lie to the south-west and can be accessed from the bay of Port an Fhasgaidh at low tide. In 1945 a mine exploded near Boat Cave, causing damage to the cliff face which is still visible. Mackinnon's Cave is 107 metres long.|$|E
5|$|The {{smartphone}} considerably reduces its predecessor's sizes, measuring 4.3 by 2.4 by 6 inches (10.92, 6.09 and 15.24 centimeters, respectively). The Bold 9700 has a 624MHz {{processor and}} a 256MB Flash memory. The device uses a 2.44 inch HVGA (approximately 6.1cm) non-touch LCD display at {{a resolution of}} 480×360 pixels. The resolution of the display was {{compared to that of}} HTC Magic, as it has also HVGA quality. The model changes its predecessor's trackball to an optical trackpad, with simple functionalities such as swiping the thumb to move it and press it to make a selection. This change prevented problems including the accumulation of dust behind the trackball. Similarly to previous BlackBerry models, BlackBerry 9700 has a 35-key QWERTY-type physical keyboard, which is smaller than that of Bold 9000. On the top of the device, there are two buttons that respectively lock or mute it; on the right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> rubberized keys are found, which can either control the audio volume or the music player; further down, there is a camera shutter key. Cosmetic changes including the addition of a leatherette battery cover were carried out in order to appeal both sexes.|$|E

25|$|It is {{frequent}} {{that the}} geostrophic conditions develop between a well-defined pair of pressure high and low; {{or that a}} major geostrophic stream is flanked by several higher- and lower-pressure regions at either <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> (see images).|$|E
25|$|Shophouses are urban terraced buildings, i.e. {{standing}} {{right next to}} each other along a street, with no gap or space in between buildings (in similar vein as a terraced house). Frequently, a single wall separates the shophouses on either <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

25|$|To {{assemble}} with a z-clip, attach one <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> {{to one of}} the anchors. Deflect {{the spring}} until {{the other side of the}} clip can be placed in the other anchor. The deflection develops a spring load on the component, which maintains very good contact. In addition to the mechanical attachment that the z-clip provides, it also permits using higher-performance thermal interface materials, such as phase change types.|$|E
25|$|In 1954, {{the whole}} area around it was {{declared}} a national park, with further expansion later on. In addition, in June 2007 it was recognised by UNESCO as a World Heritage site.
