5|$|The {{family was}} arrested and imprisoned, first in their home at Tsarskoye Selo and later at residences in Tobolsk and Yekaterinburg in Siberia. Maria {{attempted}} to befriend her guards both at Tsarskoye Selo and Tobolsk and soon learned their names and details about their wives and children. Unaware of her danger, she commented at Tobolsk {{that she would be}} happy to live there indefinitely if only she could take a walk outside without being guarded continuously. <b>Still,</b> <b>she</b> was aware that she was being watched constantly. Maria and her sister Anastasia burned their letters and diaries in April 1918 because they feared their possessions would be searched.|$|E
5|$|The Secret River is a {{story of}} Magical realism, {{blending}} real life and fantasy. Young Calpurnia is an aspiring poet living in rural Central Florida during the Great Depression. Hard times have come to her people; the animals have disappeared, her father is unable to catch fish to sell, and everyone in the community is too weak from hunger to work. Calpurnia bravely leaves home with her little dog, Buggy-Horse, to find the secret river that her neighbor Mother Albirtha has told her about. She intends to catch fish for her father to sell in his shop. When she finds the river she politely asks it to allow her to catch some fish and uses her creativity, and the pink ribbons from her hair, to catch them. On her way home, an owl, a bear and a panther each challenge her, and she has to give away some of her catch to get home. She also shares some fish with Mother Albirtha and takes the rest to her father, who gives them to the starving people in return for future payment. Strengthened by the fish, people begin working again. When the crisis is past Calpurnia searches for the river again, but cannot find it, as she no longer really needs it. <b>Still,</b> <b>she</b> realizes nothing is lost to us forever, and the book ends with one of her poems, expressing this sentiment:Secret River is in my mind.|$|E

25|$|Establishing the {{existence}} of a precontract between Catherine and Dereham would have had the effect of terminating Catherine's royal union, but it also would have allowed Henry to annul their marriage and banish her from Court, in poverty and disgrace, without having to execute her. Yet <b>still</b> <b>she</b> steadfastly denied any precontract, maintaining that Dereham had raped her.|$|E
25|$|Between 4 and 5 November 1821, gales hit the British coasts {{and many}} vessels were damaged or lost.

25|$|General Goddard {{left the}} Downs on 26 February 1789 {{under the command}} of Captain Thomas Foxall. She reached Diamond Harbour (Calcutta) on 26 June. On her homeward leg, she touched in at Saugor on 27 November and Madras on 27 December. From there she reached St Helena on 18 March 1790. On 14 May she ran aground near the Brisou (Grange Chine), at the Isle of Wight.

25|$|In {{many ways}} Avance resembled the first {{state-owned}} icebreaker of Finland, Murtaja, although her bow was of improved Swedish design which increased her icebreaking capability. The {{angle of the}} stem, {{the first part of}} the ship to encounter and break the ice, was 22 degrees. <b>Still,</b> <b>she</b> was of the same outdated European design as Murtaja and thus had similar problems in difficult ice conditions. Her coal stores were also located too far in the front, resulting in an unfavourable trim at full load. Despite her shortcomings Avance was found out to be suitable for service within the archipelago.|$|E
25|$|Galgo {{arrived late}} to the {{unsuccessful}} Walcheren Expedition, which took place between 30 July and 9 August 1809. She missed the bombardment of Ramakins. On 13 August {{she was part of}} a squadron under Sir Home Riggs Popham that pushed up the West Scheld, but saw no action. This is the only mention of Galgo in dispatches from the campaign published in the London Gazette. Clearly, Galgos part in the campaign was minimal, though she may have fired her rockets at the bombardment of Flushing. <b>Still,</b> <b>she</b> was among the myriad vessels listed as qualifying for the prize money from the campaign.|$|E
25|$|In April and May the Spithead and Nore mutinies broke out. Grampus {{was one of}} {{the vessels}} caught up in the disorder, and is named in the {{proclamation}} read out on 10 June. The exact date of her arrival at Sheerness, the date of her joining the mutiny, and the date of her crew returning to duty are not known. <b>Still,</b> <b>she</b> was at Sheerness by 16 May. At the time, Grampus was preparing for a voyage to the West Indies. After the reading of the Proclamation on 10 June, the crews of a number of vessels sought to abandon the mutiny. On Grampus a fight broke out between loyalists and mutineers, a fight that the mutineer faction won. Under some reports, the mutineers abandoned her.|$|E

25|$|Hayes's {{replacement}} was Lieutenant George Lemprière, and she {{was stationed}} in the Channel. The great gale of 8–9 November 1800 caught Redbridge and several other vessels in St Aubyn's Bay, Jersey. Redbridge, which managed to get to sea, was widely {{believed to have been}} lost. <b>Still,</b> <b>she</b> arrived in Spithead on Wednesday 12 November, though without her guns, which she had thrown overboard to lighten her. She went into harbour to effectuate repairs. Havick, , the hired armed cutter Lion, and a Guernsey privateer were driven ashore. Havick was so badly damaged that she was abandoned as a wreck. The other three vessels were refloated. The hired armed brig Telegraph too got out to sea and was saved though she lost her mast.|$|E
25|$|Her {{progress}} stagnated in 2007 as {{she failed}} to clear higher than 4.50m. <b>Still,</b> <b>she</b> took third place at the USA Outdoors and competed at the 2007 World Championships, where she achieved her season's best of 4.50m in qualifying. She started 2008 with a big personal best indoors in Jonesboro, improving 12cm with a clearance of 4.72m. She was again the runner-up at the USA Indoors, this time behind Jennifer Stuczynski. At the 2008 IAAF World Indoor Championships in Valencia, Spain, she was eliminated once again at the qualifying stage. She set her sights on making the team for the 2008 Beijing Olympics and had podium finishes at the Reebok Grand Prix and the Adidas Track Classic. However, she came fourth at the 2008 United States Olympic Trials, being beaten by the less-established April Steiner Bennett and Erica Bartolina.|$|E
25|$|On {{arriving}} to the Wind Music Island, Lyra is notified by Tangle {{that the music}} eons in this island were once created by fairies, who also used to live there.

But <b>still</b> <b>she</b> have known her fairy roots yet, as Tangle keeps it from her. After finding all three keys, Lyra returns to the Clockmaker's house and finishes her mission there.

25|$|Unfortunately Consuelo Vanderbilt had no {{interest}} in the duke, being secretly engaged to an American, Winthrop Rutherfurd. Her mother cajoled, wheedled, begged, and then, ultimately, ordered her daughter to marry Marlborough. When Consuelo – a docile teenager whose only notable characteristic at the time was abject obedience to her fearsome mother – made plans to elope, she was locked in her room as Alva threatened to murder Rutherfurd. <b>Still,</b> <b>she</b> refused. It was only when Alva Vanderbilt claimed that her health was being seriously and irretrievably undermined by Consuelo's stubbornness and appeared to be at death's door that the malleable girl acquiesced. Alva made an astonishing recovery from her entirely phantom illness, and when the wedding took place, Consuelo stood at the altar reportedly weeping behind her veil. The duke, for his part, gave up the woman he reportedly loved back in England and collected US$2.5million (approximately US$67.7 million in 2015 dollars) in railroad stock as a marriage settlement. Consuelo's father built a mansion for her in London, Sunderland House in Curzon Street.|$|E
25|$|Different {{versions}} of Gaspar's legend relate different episodes in his piratical career. One {{of the most}} famous involves a Spanish (or Mexican) princess Gaspar had captured. Allegedly named Useppa, she consistently rejected the pirate's advances until he threatened to behead her if she would not submit to his lust. <b>Still</b> <b>she</b> refused, and he killed her in a rage (or alternately because his crew demanded her death). The captain instantly regretted the deed and took her body to a nearby island, which he named Useppa in her honor, and buried her himself. Some versions identify the lady with Josefa de Mayorga, daughter of Martín de Mayorga, viceroy of New Spain from 1779 to 1782, and contend that the island's name evolved over time. Similarly, Sanibel Island {{is said to have been}} named by Gaspar's first mate, Roderigo Lopez, after his lover whom he had left back in Spain. Empathizing with his friend's plight, Gaspar eventually allowed Lopez to return home, and even trusted him with his personal log.|$|E
