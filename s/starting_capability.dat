40|$|This licentiate thesis {{describes}} the modeling and measurements {{performed with the}} aim of developing design guidelines for Line Start Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors, LSPMSMs. LSPMSMs can offer higher efficiency than standard induction motors used in the industry today, especially for small motor sizes. The increase in efficiency results in lower environmental impact and reduced electricity cost. The LSPMSM has, however, several drawbacks, among the most important is the reduced <b>starting</b> <b>capability</b> compared to induction motors. Furthermore, the rotor construction is complex and the added cost of magnet material makes the LSPMSM a comparably expensive motor type. The design of a LSPMSM is a trade-off between <b>starting</b> <b>capability</b> and steady state performance. The thesis discusses these trade-offs and the models that {{can be used as a}} basis for design and optimization. The models make use of different motor parameters, and a number of measurement methods for measuring these parameters are described and compared. Among these is a step response adapted measurement method that provides most of the parameters of interest. The development and setup of a brake bench for measuring both start-up and steady state performance is presented. Furthermore the start-up behavior and steady-state performance is calculated using measured parameters. The calculated performance is compared to measured performance and found to correlate well for nominal operating conditions. Thus, design guidelines can be based on the models proposed.

40|$|Both {{numerical}} {{and experimental}} studies {{were conducted to}} evaluate the performance of an omni-flow wind turbine designed to provide renewable electricity {{on the top of}} urban buildings like skyscrapers. The numerical approach was based on Finite Volume Method (FVM) and the turbulence flow was studied with several commonly used Reynolds-averaged Navier???Stokes turbulence models. The results of the study were evaluated with the wind tunnel test results over a range of tip speed ratios. The numerical results showed the effect of blade number on both power output and <b>starting</b> <b>capability.</b> Although both the power and torque coefficient were improved significantly by the optimisation of the blade number, there was only a slight change when the blade number was greater than twenty. The results from wind tunnel testing also showed excellent <b>starting</b> <b>capability</b> with a starting wind velocity as low as 1. 6 m/s. A numerical simulation was also conducted for the wind turbine working under non-uniform flow conditions. The numerical results have shown that the peak power coefficient of such a wind turbine under non-uniform flow, was lower than that under the uniform flow. Additionally, the applied thrust on a blade was subject to frequent and periodical changes. However, the effect of the change of thrust in magnitude and frequency was not significant. Therefore the omni-flow wind turbine has the potential to meet the challenge of unpredictable wind velocity and direction {{as a consequence of the}} urban environment...|$|E
40|$|Small wind {{turbines}} that operate in low-wind environments {{are prone to}} suffer performance degradation as they often fail to accelerate to a steady, power-producing condition. The behaviour during this process is called “starting behaviour” {{and it is the}} subject of this present work. This thesis evaluates potential benefits that can be obtained from the improvement of starting behaviour, investigates, in particular, small wind turbine starting behaviour (both horizontal- and vertical-axis), and presents aerofoil performance characteristics (both steady and unsteady) needed for the analysis. All of the investigations were conducted using a new set of aerodynamic performance data of six aerofoils (NACA 0012, SG 6043, SD 7062, DU 06 -W- 200, S 1223, and S 1223 B). All of the data were obtained at flow conditions that small wind turbine blades have to operate with during the startup - low Reynolds number (from 65000 to 150000), high angle of attack (through 360 ◦), and high reduced frequency (from 0. 05 to 0. 20). In order to obtain accurate aerodynamic data at high incidences, a series of CFD simulations were undertaken to illustrate effects of wall proximity and to determine test section sizes that offer minimum proximity effects. A study was carried out on the entire horizontal-axis wind turbine generation system to understand its starting characteristics and to estimate potential benefits of improved starting. Comparisons of three different blade configurations reveal that the use of mixed-aerofoil blades leads to a significant increase in <b>starting</b> <b>capability.</b> The improved <b>starting</b> <b>capability</b> effectively reduces the time that the turbine takes to reach its power-extraction period and, hence, an increase in overall energy yield. The increase can be as high as 40...|$|E

40|$|The black <b>start</b> <b>capability</b> {{is vital}} for microgrids, which can {{potentially}} improve {{the reliability of the}} power grid. This paper proposes a black start strategy for microgrids based on a parallel restoration strategy. Considering the characteristics of distributed generations (DGs), an evaluation model, which is used to assess the black <b>start</b> <b>capability</b> of DGs, is established by adopting the variation coefficient method. Thus, the DGs with good black <b>start</b> <b>capability,</b> which are selected by a diversity sequence method, are restored first in parallel under the constraints of DGs and network. During the selection process of recovery paths, line weight and node importance degree are proposed under the consideration of the node topological importance and the load importance as well as the backbone network restoration time. Therefore, the whole optimization of the reconstructed network is realized. Finally, the simulation results verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the strategy...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{includes}} {{an investigation of}} the <b>starting</b> <b>capability</b> of a high efficiency synchronous motor for direct on-line industrial applications. The approach is to use a hybrid rotor concept to achieve the starting properties of an induction motor and the steady state performance of a synchronous reluctance motor. The hybrid motor rated at 20 kW is compared and evaluated against a same size induction motor in aspect to parameter variations. Simulations showed that the rotor losses can be reduced by 80 % in the best case. The total motor losses decrease by 20 - 30 %. This gain in efficiency will improve the efficiency class of the motor from IE 3 to IE 4. Furthermore, the results from this thesis hopes to raise the interest in investigation of new line-start, high efficiency motors further...|$|E

For this purpose a simulation model and a test bench setup were used. With this new motor design a measured efficiency enhancement at rated load from 89. 3 % up to 92. 0 % was achieved, corresponding to a loss reduction of about 27. 6 %. For the chosen 4 kW four pole motor the efficiency rating was improved from IE 3 to IE 4.

40|$|Aerojet is {{currently}} executing two Strutjet propulsion contracts: one a Rocket Based Combined Cycle (RBCC) engine for a NASA-Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) Advanced Reusable Transportation Technology (ARTT) program, the second a Dual Mode Ram/Scramjet engine for a USAF Wright Laboratories Storable Fuel Scramjet Flow Path Concepts program. The engines employed in both programs operate at supersonic and low hypersonic speeds and use inlets employing forebody external and sidewall compression. Aerojet has developed and validated a successful design methodology applicable to these inlet types. Design features include an integrated vehicle forebody, external side compression struts, strut sidewall and throat bleed, a throat shock trap, and variable geometry internal contraction. Computation Fluid Dynamic (CFD) predictions and test data show these inlets allow substantially increased flow turning angles over other designs. These increased flow turning angles allow shorter and lighter engines than current designs, {{which in turn}} enables higher performing vehicles with broad operating characteristics. This paper describes the designs of two different inlets evaluated by the NASA-MSFC and USAF programs, discusses the results of wind tunnel tests performed by NASA-Lewis Research Center, and provides correlations of test data with CFD predictions.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effect of turbine <b>starting</b> <b>capability</b> on overall energy-production capacity. The investigation was performed through the development and validation of matlab /Simulink models of turbines. A novel aspect of this paper is that the effects of load types, namely resistive heating, battery charging, and grid connection were also investigated. It was shown that major contributors to improved starting performance are aerodynamic improvements, reduction of inertia, and simply changing the pitch angle of the blades. The first two contributors can be attained from an exploitation of a “mixed-airfoil” blade. The results indicate that starting ability has a direct effect on the duration that the turbine can operate and consequently its overall energy output. The overall behavior of the wind turbine system depends on the load type, these impose different torque characteristics for the turbine to overcome and lead to different power production characteristics. When a “mixed-airfoil” blade is used the annual energy production of the wind systems increases with the exception of resistive heating loads. Net changes in annual energy production were range of − 4 % to 40 % depending on the load types and sites considered. The significant improvement in energy production strongly suggests that both the starting performance and load types should be considered together in the design process...|$|E

The development of this project is to control the 3 phase induction motor by using Arduino Uno controller and also using Simulink in MATLAB.

Voltage sensor is used as to detect any changes that are supplied from the motor driver to the induction motor as to ensure that the voltage that is supplied to a constant voltage value to the induction motor. This method is known as voltage control. The measured voltage is then compared with the desired reference voltage.

40|$|The {{authors have}} {{completed}} {{a study in}} which they investigated {{the use of a}} rich combustor to aid in cold starting spark-ignition engines fueled with either neat ethanol or neat methanol. The rich combustor burns the alcohol fuel outside the engine under fuel-rich conditions to produce a combustible product stream that is fed to the engine for cold starting. The rich combustor approach significantly extends the cold <b>starting</b> <b>capability</b> of alcohol-fueled engines. A design tool was developed that simulates the operation of the combustor and couples it to an engine/vehicle model. This tool allows the user to determine the fuel requirements of the rich combustor as the vehicle executes a given driving mission. The design tool was used to design and fabricate a rich combustor for use on a 2. 8 L automotive engine. The system was tested using a unique cold room that allows the engine to be coupled to an electric dynamometer. The engine was fitted with an aftermarket engine control system that permitted the fuel flow to the rich combustor to be programmed as a function of engine speed and intake manifold pressure. Testing indicated that reliable cold starts were achieved on both neat methanol and neat ethanol at temperatures as low as {minus} 20 C. Although starts were experienced at temperatures as low as {minus} 30 C, these were erratic. They believe that an important factor at the very low temperatures is the balance between the high mechanical friction of the engine and the low energy density of the combustible mixture fed to the engine from the rich combustor...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{studies as}} well as {{simulations}} have been performed on the Back-to-Back starting schemes low frequency-, partial frequency-, and soft -start-up. A Back-to-Back configuration of two synchronous machines {{has been established in}} the laboratory, upon which parameter estimation and start-up experiments have been performed. Extensive parameter estimation was conducted in order to replicate the laboratory machines in the simulation model as accurately as possible. This was done in order to verify the validity of the simulation model. Studies into the effects of inductance interconnecting the machines were made in the laboratory and in the simulation model. Effects of resistance and inertia were studied in the simulation model. It is concluded that the simulation model appears to be as reliable as is its input parameters. Discrepancies were found in line voltages, due to faulty implementation of field current replication. Full scale simulations using Motorformer parameters were performed in the simulation model, featuring low frequency- and soft -staring. The effects of an interconnecting cable were studied. It is concluded that low frequency starting appears to be most reliable and least violent starting method. However, it might be limited by the availability of a turbine. This is not the case for soft starting, which has a lower <b>starting</b> <b>capability</b> and is more violent to the motor damper- and field windings. Low frequency startig is the recommended starting method of the ones studied. Dynamic short circuit simulations were done on a fixed speed LNG-facility. The fixed speed alternative appears to be more stable when responding to a short circuit. This is because the motors contribute to upholding the voltage during a fault by delivering reactive power to the short circuit, and because the motors do not loose all torque as is the case for LCI drives when the voltage dip exceeds 20 $%$. Further work is needed in up-scaling the experiments. A sophisticated simulation model should be established and its validity tested on the up-scaled experiments. Preliminary custom design of machines should be initiated depending on what starting scheme is chosen. Custom machine parameters should then be used in full scale simulation using the more sophisticated model. </p...|$|E
