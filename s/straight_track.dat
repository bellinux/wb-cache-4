5|$|In the Avon Valley to {{the east}} of Bath the classic {{geographical}} example of a valley with all four forms of ground transport is found: road, rail, river, canal. The canal passes the remains of a loading dock, once used for Bath Stone from the quarries on Bathampton Down, which was carried down a <b>straight</b> <b>track</b> to the canal over the Dry Arch rock bridge (demolished in 1958 to allow double-decker buses to use the A36). Next, the canal passes the waterwheel-powered Claverton Pumping Station, which pumped water from the River Avon into the canal. The building was completed in 1810 and the pump was working by 1813.|$|E
5|$|The {{intensification}} trend {{picked up}} {{again the next}} day with a fairly rapid drop in the storm's central pressure as it entered the southeastern Caribbean Sea, a region typically unfavorable for intensification. Hurricane Emily's winds increased in reaction, briefly bringing the storm to Category 4 strength early on July15. During the day, the storm's strength fluctuated greatly, dropping to a Category2 storm and then rebuilding to Category4. On July16, Emily strengthened considerably, making it the strongest hurricane ever on record to form in the month of July with peak winds of 160mph (260km/h), the earliest known Category 5 in the Atlantic basin. Initially at this point Emily was thought to have peaked as a Category4 storm, but the post-storm analysis showed it was indeed a Category5 hurricane. The storm weakened slightly as it continued westward, and remained a Category4 while passing south of Jamaica and, on July17, the Cayman Islands. Hurricane Emily continued on its nearly <b>straight</b> <b>track</b> to the west-northwest, weakening somewhat but remaining at Category4 until striking Cozumel just before mainland landfall at Playa del Carmen at 06:30UTC on July18. Sustained winds were 135mph (215km/h), and the eyewall passed directly over Cozumel.|$|E

5|$|There {{has also}} been a surge in the demand for Hester’s jerseys within the Chicago area {{sporting}} stores. Also, Hester was invited to throw the ceremonial opening pitch and sing Take Me Out to the Ball Game at the Chicago Cubs' 2007 home opener. Along with teammates Rex Grossman and Tommie Harris, Hester appeared on the February 2007 issue of Sports Illustrated for Kids. His reputation {{has also been}} bolstered by EA Sports' Madden NFL 08, where Hester's perfect 100 speed rating made him the fastest player in the game's history. Hester also appeared in a promotional video for the game. He appeared in commercials for Under Armour in 2008 and 2009. In 2013, Hester outran a cheetah in a race sponsored by National Geographic at Busch Gardens Tampa. The competition consisted of Hester running back and forth on a <b>straight</b> <b>track</b> to simulate laps, while the cheetah ran in a similar but separate track.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{departing from}} the station, the train made a slight left turn {{leading into the}} {{transfer}} track section before beginning to climb the [...] lift hill. Once {{at the top and}} after going through a pre-drop, the train made a sharp [...] left-hand drop back to the ground. Then, the train goes back up, through an Immelmann followed by a slight downward right turn before entering an air-time hill (this was the first of three near-miss points with the Hungarian Horntail train when the roller coasters duelled). Next, the train dropped back down turning left slightly leading into a second Immelmann. After a downward right helix and a short section of <b>straight</b> <b>track,</b> the train goes through the second former near-miss point with the other train, a vertical loop. After the loop and another section of <b>straight</b> <b>track,</b> the train made a right turn leading into the third and final former near-miss element which was a corkscrew. Then, the train made a left turn followed by a small drop leading into another section of <b>straight</b> <b>track</b> before entering the final element in the coaster layout, another corkscrew. The train then made a left turn into the final brake run. Following a left turn, the train returned to the station where riders unloaded and the next riders load.|$|E

500|$|The journal proved {{influential}} {{from the}} start. Although not initially using {{a process of}} peer review, Crawford asked his friends to read through submissions that he was unsure about. As well as seeking to shape and define the discipline, Antiquity sought to spread news of archaeological discoveries to a wider public, thereby being more accessible than pre-existing scholarly journals. This resulted in Crawford receiving letters from proponents of various pseudo-archaeological ideas, such as the ley line theory of Alfred Watkins; he filed these letters under a section of his archive titled [...] "Crankeries" [...] and was annoyed that educated people believed such ideas when they were demonstrably incorrect. He refused to publish an advert in Antiquity for The Old <b>Straight</b> <b>Track</b> by Watkins, who became very bitter towards him. In 1938, Crawford served as President of the Prehistoric Society; in this position he instigated a series of excavations, inviting the German archaeologist Gerhard Bersu—persecuted in Germany by the Nazi authorities—to move to England to oversee the excavation of Little Woodbury.|$|E
500|$|On August 13, 1882, {{the first}} {{passenger}} train {{passed through the}} Black Canyon. The editor of the Gunnison Review-Press rode {{in one of the}} observation cars; he remarked that the canyon was [...] "undoubtedly the largest and most rugged canyon in the world traversed by the iron horse. We had often heard of the scenery of this canyon, but no one can have the faintest conception of its grandeur and magnificence until they have made a trip through it. It is a narrow gorge with walls of granite rising in some places to a height of thousands of feet…Throughout its entire length there is probably not {{a quarter of a mile}} of <b>straight</b> <b>track</b> on it. It is a serpentine road in every respect and the curves are frequent and sharp. In hundreds of places the walls of granite are perpendicular and in many places the road bed is blasted out in the side of the walls of rock which overhang the track." [...] He went on to proclaim, [...] "Another such a feat of railroad engineering probably can not be found in the world, and there is probably no section of Colorado or of the whole country where such a varied and interesting lot of scenery can be found." ...|$|E
2500|$|Other {{things being}} equal, a train {{is harder to}} pull around a curve than it is on <b>straight</b> <b>track</b> because the wagons – {{especially}} bogie (2 axle) wagons – try to follow the chord of the curve and not the arc. To compensate for this, the gradient should {{be a little less}} steep the sharper the curve is; the necessary grade reduction is assumed to be given by a simple formula such as 0.04 per cent per [...] "degree of curve", the latter being a measure of curve sharpness used in the United States. On a 10-degree curve (radius 573.7 feet) the grade would thus need to be 0.4% less than the grade on <b>straight</b> <b>track.</b>|$|E

50|$|Early funiculars {{used two}} {{parallel}} <b>straight</b> <b>tracks,</b> four rails, with separate station platforms for each vehicle. The tracks are laid with sufficient {{space between them}} for the two cars to pass at the midpoint. The wheels of the cars are usually single-flanged, as on standard railway vehicles.

2500|$|Another problem arises {{because of}} the {{geometry}} of the tonearm. Master recordings are cut on a recording lathe where a sapphire stylus [...] moves radially across the blank, suspended on a <b>straight</b> <b>track</b> and driven by a lead screw.

Various mechanisms were devised in attempts to compensate, {{with varying degrees of}} success. See more at phonograph.|$|E
2500|$|A {{kinematic}} description {{deals with}} the geometry of motion, {{without reference to the}} forces causing it, so the analysis begins with a description of the geometry of a wheel set running on a <b>straight</b> <b>track.</b> [...] Since Newton's Second Law relates forces to accelerations of bodies, the forces acting may then be derived from the kinematics by calculating the accelerations of the components. [...] However, if these forces change the kinematic description (as they do in this case) then the results may only be approximately correct.|$|E
50|$|The Final Environmental Impact Statement, {{released}} in 2013, selected a route further east with Dean Street station as a downtown stop instead. The FEIS included {{the possibility of}} using the Whittenton Branch, but a station would have been built at Dana Street several blocks {{to the north of the}} Oak Street location, where the <b>straighter</b> <b>track</b> geometry would be more favorable for the construction of full-length high-level platforms.|$|R
50|$|Steel belts {{helps to}} move the {{finished}} product or raw material. Steel Belt also help in parcel sorting systems, transporting of bottles, bulk loads, bricks, machinery parts and the like. <b>Straight</b> <b>tracking,</b> high abrasion resistance, and dynamic fatigue strength are crucial when transporting bulky material or unit load.

5000|$|In the 1870s the PRR began {{exploring}} ways {{to improve}} rail access between New Jersey and New York (see New York Tunnel Extension).

2500|$|The best-known {{locomotives}} {{were those}} on the Denver, South Park & Pacific, and they rostered fairly large Mason Bogies, mostly of 2-6-6 and 2-8-6 wheel arrangements, and {{had a lot of}} success with them. [...] Some of these locomotives were later sold to the Burlington and Northwestern Railway, a CB subsidiary in Iowa. Another problem with the Fairlie design showed itself in Colorado, the surprisingly poor tracking of the powered bogie. It would both hunt, or wander, when on <b>straight</b> <b>track,</b> yet provide more resistance to turning when it hit curvature than might be thought. This manifested itself in much greater wear on wheels and track than might have been expected.|$|E
2500|$|The {{potential}} energy at maximum axle yaw {{may be increased}} by including an elastic constraint on the yaw motion of the axle, {{so that there is}} a contribution arising from spring tension. [...] Arranging wheels in bogies to increase the constraint on the yaw motion of wheelsets and applying elastic constraints to the bogie also raises the critical speed. [...] Introducing elastic forces into the equation permits suspension designs which are limited only by the onset of gross slippage, rather than classical hunting. The penalty to be paid for the virtual elimination of hunting is a <b>straight</b> <b>track,</b> with an attendant right-of-way problem and incompatibility with legacy infrastructure.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the days}} of steam-hauled expresses, one {{particular}} part of the Main South Line gained an element of fame. [...] Mail was carried as well as passengers, {{and the process of}} delivering and receiving mail at stations during the journey would often delay the express. [...] For this reason, when locomotive drivers hit the relatively flat, <b>straight</b> <b>track</b> of the Canterbury Plains approaching Christchurch, they would seek to run as fast as possible and try to make up as much lost time as they could. [...] Many claims were made of passing the official New Zealand rail speed record of [...] set by a Vulcan railcar in trials, and the line {{came to be known as}} the [...] "racetrack".|$|E
50|$|In the United States, {{a simple}} {{expansion}} (simplex) {{version of the}} type was used only on the Southern Pacific and Union Pacific Railroads.

40|$|Noise and {{vibration}} {{from moving}} trains are important environmental issues affecting residents near railway lines. Modelling the dynamic behaviour of tracks {{is important to}} develop a good understanding about the physics which is essential to providing solutions. A large number of models {{have been reported in}} the literature on the dynamics behaviour of tracks. Most of these focus on <b>straight</b> <b>tracks</b> with less attention paid to curved tracks. This is mainly attributed to the higher complexity associated with modelling of curved <b>tracks</b> compared to <b>straight</b> ones. However, curved tracks are reported to have more problems and this increases the need for research on these tracks. In this paper a curved track is formulated as a beam on elastic foundation and is analysed using a matrix approach. The beam is discretised using straight beam elements which are formulated as Euler-Bernoulli beams. The paper presents results describing the dynamics of a curved track with a focus on forces transmitted to the track bed. Calculations are performed for harmonic moving loads. The track-bed forces are compared against those for <b>straight</b> <b>tracks.</b> The effects of curvature and loads frequency are also investigate...|$|R
30|$|The first type of wear {{is caused}} by pinned–pinned {{resonance}} of a track vibration, occurs mostly in <b>straight</b> <b>tracks</b> (indifferently on two rails), and in high rail of curves, especially in curves of greater radius, as consequence of the vibration of the rail bounded into two sleepers. This kind of corrugation may also appear in the track for light axle load traffic (less than 200  kN). Furthermore, in some circumstances, this defect is more evident in the correspondence of the sleepers [19].|$|R
