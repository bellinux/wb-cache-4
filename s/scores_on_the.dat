5|$|Kohlberg's {{scale is}} about how people justify {{behaviors}} and his stages are not a method of ranking how moral someone's behavior is. There should, however, be a correlation between how someone <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> scale and how they behave, and the general hypothesis is that moral behaviour is more responsible, consistent and predictable from people at higher levels.|$|E
5|$|In this {{double-blind}} RCT, the preterm infants {{were fed}} either control formula containing phospholipids derived from egg yolk lecithin with sphingomyelin at 13% of total phospholipid or a supplemented formula with milk-derived phospholipids containing 20% sphingomyelin. Infants fed the supplemented formula {{had significantly higher}} percentages of sphingomyelin in total plasma phospholipids after 4, 6, and 8 weeks of feeding compared to those fed the control formula. The infants fed the supplemented formula also showed improvements across multiple developmental measures at 18 months, with significantly better <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Behavior Rating Scale of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development II (BSID-II), the Fagan test (novelty preference rate), the latency of visual evoked potentials (VEP), and sustained attention test than in the control group.|$|E
5|$|The DEQ has {{collected}} water-quality {{data in the}} Rogue basin since the mid-1980s and has used it to generate <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Oregon Water Quality Index (OWQI). The index is meant to provide an assessment of water quality for general recreational uses; OWQI scores can vary from 10 (worst) to 100 (ideal). Of the eight Rogue basin sites tested during the water years 1997–2006, five were ranked good, one was excellent, and two—Little Butte Creek and Bear Creek, in the most populated part of the Rogue basin—were poor. On the Rogue River itself, scores varied from 92 at RM138.4 (RK222.7) declining to 85 at RM117.2 (RK188.6) but improving to 97 at RM11.0 (RK17.7). By comparison, the average OWQI score for the Willamette River in downtown Portland, the state's largest city, was 74 between 1986 and 1995.|$|E

The average <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 1994 {{modification}} of the SAT I were similar: 428 on the verbal and 482 on the math. SAT scores for admitted applicants to highly selective colleges in the United States were typically much higher.

Similarly, median <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> modified 1994 SAT for freshmen entering Yale University {{in the fall of}} 1995 were 670 (verbal) and 720 (math). For the majority of SAT takers, however, verbal and math scores were below 500: In 1992, half of the college-bound seniors taking the SAT were scoring between 340 and 500 on the verbal section and between 380 and 560 on the math section, with corresponding median scores of 420 and 470, respectively.|$|E
