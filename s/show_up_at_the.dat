5|$|At {{eight years}} old, James Dean {{lives with his}} estranged father Winton and mother Mildred in 1939 Santa Monica, California. When Mildred dies of cancer in 1940, Winton sends James on a train to Fairmount, Indiana, along with the coffin {{containing}} her body. Winton does not <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> funeral, leaving James to be raised by his aunt and uncle {{on a farm in}} Fairmount. Over the years, he becomes more curious about his father's decision to abandon him. He tries to impress him by sending him a package displaying his various athletic trophies in high school sports.|$|E
5|$|Leading up to Turning Point 2007, TNA {{officials}} {{began to}} suspect Scott Hall would not <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> event, as the last contact with him prior to the event was earlier that morning. TNA officials soon received word from Hall that {{he was suffering from}} food poisoning and {{would not be able to}} attend. As a result of the no-show, officials approached Samoa Joe and asked him to help take blame off the company for Hall's no-show and to help promote talent in TNA by giving an announcement before introducing Eric Young as Hall's replacement. Joe's announcement went five minutes longer than originally planned, which upset several individuals in TNA. At one point during his announcement, he asked a person off-screen if they were angry and to go ahead and fire him, as he did not care; this individual was the legitimate president of TNA, Dixie Carter. After the event went off the air, a heated exchange between Kevin Nash and Joe took place backstage. The next night, TNA held a meeting and announced that anyone unhappy with their job could void their contract with the company. Senshi was the only one who wished to void his contract. During the meeting, Joe apologized for his actions at the event.|$|E
5|$|Many {{people start}} to <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Quahog's Men's Club and Lois and her friends start to get annoyed. In order {{to get back at}} them, they enter the club. Everyone dances, except for Bonnie, because her husband is handicapped. Joe feels {{self-conscious}} about his disability, and decides to get surgery so that {{he will be able to}} walk again. When Joe comes out of the operation, he invites his friends to go do physical activities such as rock climbing, karate, and dance. Joe starts to not care about his friends and his wife, and finds three new jock friends that share his status. Lois and Peter are worried about Joe, and Lois suggests that Peter should find a new friend to replace him. Meanwhile, Joe realizes that he has outgrown Bonnie and leaves her. Desperate to get their friend back, Peter, Cleveland and Quagmire try to re-cripple Joe, failing miserably until Bonnie comes along with Joe's handgun and shoots (and misses) Joe's spine. Sick of waiting in pain, Joe takes the gun and shoots himself in the spine, re-crippling himself. They all then go to the Drunken Clam where Joe apologizes to Peter, Cleveland and Quagmire for how he acted and they all forgive him.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} events {{reported}} low spectator attendance despite having acceptable ticket sales. Preliminary competition and locally less popular sports failed to attract capacity crowd as expected. Organizers explained this was because blocks of seats were reserved or purchased by sponsors and partners who later did not <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> events.|$|E
25|$|During {{the postwar}} years, the Air National Guard {{was almost like}} a flying country club and a pilot could often <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> field, check out an {{aircraft}} and go flying. However, these units also had regular military exercises that kept up proficiency and in gunnery and bombing contests they would often score better than full-time USAF units.|$|E
25|$|However, {{he never}} did.

Seedman claimed they offered to have the mosque worshippers <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> local precinct house if the police left the scene; Rangel has said that he could not make such a promise, and did not.|$|E

25|$|The UEFA charged Feyenoord at a {{disciplinary}} hearing on 7 December 2006., fining the club 130,000 Euros and issuing a suspended penalty of playing two matches behind closed doors. The UEFA appealed and demanded Feyenoord to {{be excluded from}} competition and to be suspended for the first upcoming season they qualify for Europe. Van den Herik still remained in function, but the pressure grew. He did not <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> club anymore and left a lot of questions.|$|E
25|$|Rosette became French in 1933. She went {{to school}} in Paris, first at the girls primary school , then at the rue de Montmorency, not far from Le Marais, where a large {{concentration}} of Jews resided. In 1941, the family left Paris for Lyon, situated in the zone libre, because of the restrictions targeting the Jewish community, {{and in particular the}} obligation for any Jewish person to be registered. The family did not comply to this legal obligation and did not <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> police station on the Saint Ours road, fleeing in the direction of Lyon instead.|$|E

McLaughlin would go on to great fame in the 1970s as leader of the Mahavishnu Orchestra.|$|E
25|$|On September 24 at In Your House 3 in Saginaw, Michigan, Diesel and Michaels {{challenged}} the reigning WWF Tag Team Champions Owen Hart and Yokozuna. The match had a winner-take-all stipulation, as {{in addition to}} the tag belts Diesel's WWF World Heavyweight Championship and Michaels' recently won Intercontinental Championship were also on the line. When Hart did not <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> event, he was replaced by Davey Boy Smith. In the course of the match, Hart arrived at ringside, entered the ring and was pinned by Diesel for the win and the title, making him and Michaels holders of all three major WWF championships. The reign did not last long, however, as Hart and Yokozuna had the titles returned to them the next night on Raw due to Hart not being an official part of the match when he was pinned.|$|E
25|$|Coming {{up to the}} 2011 World Championships in Daegu, Vlašić isn't the {{favourite}} at all. With 2,00 m, she's not {{leading the}} world rankings and Russia long time rival Anna Chicherova has all the expectations for the win, thanks to a Russian record of 2,07 m. Italy's Antonietta Di Martino is also in a good shape coming to the Worlds, having (as Vlašić) jumped 2,00 m outdoors but did better indoors with an Italian record of 2,04 m. Moreover, Vlašić was not sure to <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> championships due ton an injury at her left leg. However, during the championships, she showed great form and managed to clear 2,03 m and earn silver medal, not being far to clear 2,05 and create history {{to become the first}} high jumper to win 3 consecutives world titles. Anna Chicherova beats the Croatian on countbacks, while Antonietta Di Martino has to settle for the bronze with 2,00 m.|$|E

25|$|Although it was {{defeated}} and suffered heavy losses, Mackay Force's actions at Vevi gained two {{days for the}} retreat and regrouping of Allied forces to the south. Despite this, {{by the time the}} Allied resistance at Klidi collapsed, the Greek 20th and 12th Divisions had yet to complete their withdrawal, and subsequently found themselves defending their resistance positions on the Mount Siniatsiko line (passes of Kleisoura, Vlasti and Siatista) in very disadvantageous terms. The Dodecanese Regiment, the most combat-worthy of the 20th Division's units, was scattered during the westward withdrawal, due to misunderstandings with the British who undertook their transport on lorries as the Regiment’s commander chose not to <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> scheduled rendezvous with Battalion I and III, and remained as the reserve of the 20th Division {{for the remainder of the}} war. The bulk of the 20th Division was still straggling westward towards Mt. Siniatsiko when the German LSSAH brigade made contact with the main defensive line at Kleisoura in the evening on 13 April.|$|E
25|$|Two {{weeks before}} the Bislett Games, which Saidy {{considered}} important in the Olympic preparations, {{it was reported that}} the injury was healed, and that Saidy would compete in both the 100 and the 200 metres. One week later, however, the reports were countered. Having not recovered fully from the injury, Saidy stated that he would compete no earlier than late June. His eyes were still fixed on the main goal for the 2008 season, the 2008 Summer Olympics. In Beijing he competed at the 100 metres sprint and placed 3rd in his heat after Derrick Atkins and Andrey Yepishin in a time of 10.37 seconds. He qualified for the second round in which he improved his time to 10.14 seconds. However, he was unable to qualify for the semi finals as he finished in 4th place of his heat after Usain Bolt, Darvis Patton and Francis Obikwelu. He also took part in the 200 metres individual, finishing second in his first round heat, with a time of 20.54 seconds. With 20.45 seconds in the second round he placed third in his heat and he qualified for the semi finals, however he did not <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> start of the race.|$|E
25|$|Barty Crouch Sr. {{makes his}} first {{appearance}} in the series at the Quidditch World Cup in Goblet of Fire. Crouch accuses Harry, Ron and Hermione of attempting to set off the Dark Mark, and when Winky is found to have Harry's wand, he angrily dismisses Winky, as the house-elf is supposed to look after his son, who is always under an Invisibility Cloak. Voldemort and his servant Peter Pettigrew <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Crouch family home and put Crouch Sr. under the Imperius Curse, freeing Crouch Jr from the Imperius Curse placed on him by his father and thus allowing him to rejoin Voldemort. Crouch continues to appear in public at first {{and is one of}} the five judges at the Triwizard Tournament. However, worried that Crouch will fight off the Imperius Curse, Voldemort later keeps him imprisoned within the house and has him communicate exclusively through supervised owl post. Later in the book, Crouch, who has escaped from his home, meets Harry and Viktor Krum in the Forbidden Forest and begs to see Dumbledore. However, Harry, while on his way to inform Dumbledore of the events, unwittingly alerts Crouch Jr, in the disguise of Mad-Eye Moody, to his father's presence. Crouch Jr immediately goes to the Forest, kills his own father, transfigures the body into a bone, and buries it on the Hogwarts grounds.|$|E

Not only were Regina and Nemenyi reported to have had an affair in 1942, but Nemenyi made monthly child support payments to Regina and paid for Bobby's schooling until his own death in 1952. Nemenyi had lodged complaints with social workers, saying {{he was concerned about}} the way that Regina was raising Bobby, to the point that, on at least one occasion, Nemenyi broke down in tears. Later on Bobby told the Hungarian chess player Zita Rajcsányi that Paul Nemenyi would sometimes <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> family's Brooklyn apartment and take him on outings.|$|E
