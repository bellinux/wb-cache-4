25|$|A-arm {{suspension}} (short upper arm, long lower arm) with coils {{was used}} at the front and <b>swing</b> <b>axle</b> suspension with semi-trailing arms, Panhard rods and a transverse semi-elliptical leaf spring was {{used at the}} rear.|$|E
25|$|One year later, {{a revised}} model, called the 6C 2300 B was presented. In this version {{the engine was}} placed in a {{completely}} newly designed chassis, with individual front suspension and rear <b>swing</b> <b>axle,</b> and hydraulic brakes. The 6C-2300 was produced in 760 copies with rigid axles and 870 copies of the B-model.|$|E
2500|$|The Corvair second {{generation}} arrived for model year 1965, {{noted for its}} lack of a [...] "B" [...] pillar and a new fully independent suspension replacing the original <b>swing</b> <b>axle</b> rear suspension. [...] The Corvair used coil springs at each wheel.|$|E
2500|$|Further {{improvements}} to the suspension followed with the 1500 included longer <b>swing</b> <b>axles</b> and a lowered spring mounting point ...|$|R
50|$|Suspension was by <b>swing</b> <b>axles</b> in {{the rear}} and MacPherson {{suspension}} in the front. Coil springs were used with hydraulic telescopic shock absorbers.|$|R
50|$|The Country Buggy {{was based}} on an Australian-made Type 1 {{platform}} with engine, gearbox and front axle from the Type 1. The rear <b>swing</b> <b>axles</b> had reduction gears from a 1st generation Volkswagen Transporter (1950-1967).|$|R
2500|$|The first-generation Corvair {{featured}} a rear engine + <b>swing</b> <b>axle</b> design {{similar to that}} of the Renault Dauphine and Volkswagen Beetle [...] a design which eliminates universal joints at the wheels and keeps the rear wheels perpendicular to the half-shafts. The design can allow rear tires to undergo large camber angle changes during fast cornering due to side g-forces causing [...] "rebound" [...] camber and decreasing the tread contact with the road surface, leading to a loss of rear wheel grip and oversteer—a dynamically unstable condition where a driver can lose control and spin. [...] The problem is most severe with rear-engine <b>swing</b> <b>axle</b> combinations because of the greater inertial mass over the rear wheels and the higher center of gravity during rebound camber conditions. [...] The additional high weight of a station wagon body also exacerbates the tendency. [...] Oversteer is exacerbated by deceleration during cornering due to increased side g-force and lightened load on rear tires (lift-off oversteer). Understeer is common in front-engine cars, due to more weight, and inertia, on the front tires. Both conditions are dangerous when a car is driven at its cornering limits.|$|E
2500|$|The Corvair's {{powerplant}} was {{an overhead}} valve aluminum, air-cooled [...] flat-six (later enlarged, first to 145 {{and then to}} 164 cubic inches). The first Corvair engine produced [...] Power peaked with the 1965–66 turbocharged [...] Corsa engine option. The first generation model's <b>swing</b> <b>axle</b> rear suspension, invented and patented by engineer Edmund Rumpler, offered a comfortable ride but raised safety concerns associated with the car's handling stability, and was replaced in 1965 with a fully independent rear suspension similar to the Corvette Sting Ray.|$|E
2500|$|For 1964 {{significant}} engineering changes occurred, {{while the}} model lineup and styling remained relatively unchanged. The engine displacement was increased from [...] {{by an increase}} in stroke. The base engine power increased from , and the high performance engine increased from [...] The Spyder engine rating remained at [...] despite the displacement increase of the engine. 1964 saw an improvement in the car's <b>swing</b> <b>axle</b> rear suspension {{with the addition of a}} transverse leaf spring along with softer rear coil springs designed to diminish rear roll stiffness and foster more neutral handling. Spring rates could now be softer at both ends of the car compared to previous models. The heavy duty suspension was no longer optional, although all models now had a front anti-roll bar as standard. Brakes were improved with finned rear drums. The remaining pickup, the Rampside, was discontinued at the end of the model year.|$|E
2500|$|... front it {{consisted}} of double wishbones, with a thick sheet steel (4mm) upper wishbone, lever-arm Houdaille hydraulic dampers, longitudinal torsion bars, and lower location through a transverse leaf spring; {{at the rear of}} <b>swing</b> <b>axles</b> and radius arms, with a transverse leaf spring and longitudinal torsion bars.|$|R
50|$|Further {{improvements}} to the suspension followed with the 1500 included longer <b>swing</b> <b>axles</b> and a lowered spring mounting pointfor more negative camber and a wider rear track. The wider, lower stance gave an impressive skid pad result of 0.87g average.This put the Spitfire head and shoulders over its competition in handling.|$|R
50|$|Like the Astra it {{featured}} a rear-mounted 322 cc air-cooled engine mounted under {{the floor at}} the rear and all-round independent suspension with <b>swing</b> <b>axles</b> at the rear. Drive was by chain to the rear wheels through a three-speed motorcycle gearbox with floor-mounted change lever. The brakes were hydraulically operated.|$|R
2500|$|The Subaru Rex {{represented}} {{a fresh start}} designwise, sharing little of its appearance with the Subaru 360, although they were mechanically the same and shared a rear-engine layout. The Rex also retained the 360/R-2's rear <b>swing</b> <b>axle.</b> The appearance of the new Rex {{was similar to the}} new larger platform, the Subaru Leone. The Rex originally featured the same water-cooled 356cc EK34 two-stroke engine as used in the R-2, and was available only as a two-door sedan. In February 1973 a four-door sedan was added, and a three-door [...] "Van" [...] was added in February 1974. The Van was registerable as a commercial vehicle, allowing for considerable savings in taxes and fees. The EK34 engine came with a [...] single carburetor on the Custom L, Super L, and other trim levels down to Standard, or a [...] double carburetor for the sporty GSR. The TS (Touring Sport) received a [...] iteration. The GSR was also somewhat lower than its counterparts, due to radial tires being fitted.|$|E
2500|$|The Friskysprint was a {{prototype}} sports racing car {{built at the}} Meadows factory and said {{to be capable of}} [...] Press reports stated that on production versions the front suspension and probably the chassis and running gear would be made at the Vickers–Armstrongs (Aircraft) factory at South Marston. The prototype was finished in the American national racing colours of white with a blue stripe. It featured two bucket seats and a three-cylinder air-cooled [...] Excelsior engine mounted transversely in the frame with final drive by roller chain. Unlike all other Friskys, the rear axle was full width and fitted with a differential. The car was also independently sprung using a <b>swing</b> <b>axle</b> layout. It was expected to sell for between £675 and £750 including purchase tax. The Friskysprint never reached production and Gordon Bedson who designed and built the prototype left to join Lightburn in Australia the following spring to produce the Zeta Sports. The Friskysprint and Zeta Sports had some similarities in styling but were otherwise unconnected and despite Lightburn advertising to the contrary, Giovanni Michelotti was not involved in the design of either car.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} the 1950 season, {{a further}} updated version known as the 159 was produced, which was used for the 1951 season. This version had {{reworked}} rear suspension, the old <b>swing</b> <b>axle</b> was replaced with a De-Dion axle and the engine produced around [...] at 9600 rpm. In order to achieve this power however, the simplistically designed engine had been simply been fitted with larger superchargers over time. This fact, combined with the rich mixture required to burn methanol in the engine resulted in extremely poor fuel economy - the 159 achieved [...] miles to the gallon, compared to the Talbot-Lagos of the time, which delivered 10 miles to the gallon. The British Grand Prix at Silverstone was the first Formula One Grand Prix not won by an Alfa primarily because Fangio and Farina both had to stop twice simply to re-fuel their cars – and the Ferrari of José Froilán González did better on fuel and would go on to win the race, with Fangio second. Still, the Alfa had the edge on performance and with wins in Switzerland, France and Spain, Fangio won his first of five championships that year. For their second-to-last World Championship race (until 1979), the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, Alfa Romeo introduced a new evolution version known as the 159M, the [...] "M" [...] standing for Maggiorata ("enlarged").|$|E
50|$|Most modern {{vehicles}} have {{independent front suspension}} (IFS). Many vehicles {{also have}} an independent rear suspension (IRS). IRS, as the name implies, has the rear wheels independently sprung. A fully independent suspension has an independent suspension on all wheels. Some early independent systems used <b>swing</b> <b>axles,</b> but modern systems use Chapman or MacPherson struts, trailing arms, multilink, or wishbones.|$|R
5000|$|The {{independent}} front suspension used a transverse mounted {{leaf spring}} mounted above the wheel centre line. The hubs were located with the spring mounts {{at the top and}} control arms at the bottom. [...] The rear suspension used a live axle on semi-elliptic leaf springs, a conventional system neither as advanced nor as troublesome as the 3/20's <b>swing</b> <b>axles.</b>|$|R
50|$|The DAF 66 was {{introduced}} {{as a successor}} to the 55. It featured new, boxy styling of the front, and a new rear-axle design. The two drive belts now powered a differential, and the axle was changed from a swingaxle design to a leaf-sprung de Dion-axle. It was a major improvement over the (tricky) handling of the <b>swing</b> <b>axles</b> of the earlier 33, 44 and 55 models.|$|R
2500|$|The {{production}} car changed little from the prototype, although the full-width rear bumper was dropped {{in favour of}} two part-bumpers curving round each corner, with overriders. Mechanicals were basically stock Herald with the notable addition of front disc brakes. The engine was an [...] four-cylinder with a pushrod OHV cylinder head and two valves per cylinder, mildly tuned for the Spitfire, fed by twin SU carburettors. Also from the Herald came the {{rack and pinion steering}} and coil-and-wishbone front suspension, and at the rear a single transverse-leaf <b>swing</b> <b>axle</b> arrangement. This ended up being the most controversial part of the car: it was known to [...] "tuck in" [...] and cause violent over steer if pushed too hard, even in the staid Herald. In the sportier Spitfire (and later the six-cylinder Triumph GT6 and Triumph Vitesse) it led to severe criticism. Known fixes for this include things like camber compensators (essentially a single leaf spring suspended beneath the vertical links), or simply achieving more negative camber to the rear wheels can help the handling become more manageable. The body was bolted to a much-modified Herald chassis, the outer rails and the rear outriggers having been removed; little of the original Herald chassis design was left, and the Spitfire used structural outer sills to stiffen its body tub.|$|E
50|$|Wishbone and {{multi-link}} {{allow the}} engineer {{more control over}} the geometry, to arrive at the best compromise, than <b>swing</b> <b>axle,</b> MacPherson strut or swinging arm do; however the cost and space requirements may be greater. Semi-trailing arm is in between, being a variable compromise between the geometries of swinging arm and <b>swing</b> <b>axle.</b>|$|E

50|$|The 190 SL {{presented}} an attractive, more affordable {{alternative to the}} exclusive Mercedes-Benz 300 SL, sharing its basic styling, engineering, detailing, and fully independent suspension. While both cars had double wishbones in front and <b>swing</b> <b>axles</b> at the rear, the 190 SL {{did not use the}} 300 SL's purpose-built W198 tubular spaceframe. Instead, it was built on a shortened monocoque R121 platform modified from the W121 small saloon.|$|R
50|$|The Tatra T11 had {{its engine}} and gearbox in unit, {{bolted to the}} front of a tubular {{backbone}} with propeller shaft enclosed, that also doubled as the chassis. Bolted {{to the rear of the}} backbone is a final drive unit that, using an assembly of gears, not only changes the direction and speed of the drive, but facilitate the movement of <b>swing</b> <b>axles</b> without the need for flexible drive joints.|$|R
5000|$|The car {{featured}} a Siemens and Halske-built [...] overhead valve W6 engine, with three banks of paired cylinders, all {{working on a}} common crankshaft. Producing , it was mounted {{just ahead of the}} rear axle. The engine, transmission, and final drive were assembled together and installed as a unit. The rear <b>swing</b> <b>axles</b> were suspended by trailing leaf springs, while the front beam axle was suspended by leading leaf springs.|$|R

50|$|The Bungartz Butz was {{available}} in two basic versions: the Butz Cabrio-Limousine and the Butz Touren-Wagen. Both versions were two-seaters. The Butz had a plywood body covered in artificial leather and fitted with metal wings. The available colour schemes were either silvery gray, dark blue, sea green or beige, with black wings, wheel rims and chassis. Also available for the Butz was a special small trailer with backbone chassis and <b>swing</b> <b>axles.</b>|$|R
50|$|Looking {{to improve}} the {{handling}} of the Austin 7, in 1933 Leslie Ballamy (1904 - 1991) split the front beam <b>axle</b> into twin <b>swing</b> arms that pivoted from a central joint. It is for this simple innovation that Ballamy became renowned. Soon afterwards, he put into production his <b>swing</b> <b>axles</b> for the Austin and the Ford 8, 10 and V8 models. Ballamy also converted more up-market cars such as Allard, Bugatti, Delage and Bentley.|$|R
50|$|Glas {{produced}} {{three models}} on the Goggomobil platform: the Goggomobil T sedan, the Goggomobil TS coupé, and the Goggomobil TL van. The engine was an air-cooled, two-stroke, two-cylinder unit originally displacing 250 cc, but later available in increased sizes of 300 cc and 400 cc. It had an electric pre-selective transmission built by Getrag and a manual clutch. The engine {{was behind the}} rear wheels. Suspension was independent all round using coil springs with <b>swing</b> <b>axles.</b>|$|R
