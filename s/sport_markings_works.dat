There {{are dozens of}} Leica books and collector’s guides, notably the three-volume Leica, an Illustrated History by James L. Lager. Early or rare cameras and accessories can have very high prices. For instance, an anonymous buyer won a bidding battle for a rare 1923 Leica camera that sold for 2.6 million euros ($2.8 million) at an auction in Vienna. Notably, Leica cameras <b>sporting</b> military <b>markings</b> are highly valued; this started a market for refurbished Soviet copies with fake markings.|$|R

In this variation, the Bamfs are mute, naked, {{seemingly}} self-aware troublemakers who are depicted defacing school property in various ways. However, it later becomes uncertain whether the creatures infesting the school are Bamfs at all, an alien zoologist commenting that although the staff believe them to be [...] "interdimensional gremlins" [...] (i.e., Bamfs), they actually are not. The character is about to reveal what he believes to be the nature of the Bamfs when he is cut off, leaving the revelation for a later date; it is to note, however, that the Bamfs in this instance look more like the real Nightcrawler and <b>sport</b> body <b>markings</b> similar to his live action movie incarnation.|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn this chapter, {{the authors}} present the key {{stages of the}} {{reconstruction}} process, focusing on certain difficult points. They consider the analysis of color images {{with the aim of}} automatically selecting the playing surface. The region of interest (ROI) of a sporting scene is, naturally, the playing area. This playing area may often be characterized both as a region with a relatively uniform shade and as the largest quasi-connected component of the image under consideration. They concern the extraction of markings on the playing field using Hough transforms. For <b>sporting</b> scenes, pitch <b>markings</b> are often made up of straight and ellipse arc segments, and the Hough transform is ideally suited to characterizing these simple geometric primitives. They consider the matching of primitives extracted from images with those used in the model of the scene...|$|R
25|$|The first {{extensive}} Jewish emigration from Western Europe to Poland {{occurred at}} the time of the First Crusade in 1098. Under Bolesław III (1102–1139), the Jews, encouraged by the tolerant regime of this ruler, settled throughout Poland, including over the border in Lithuanian territory as far as Kiev. Bolesław III recognized the utility of Jews in the development of the commercial interests of his country. Jews came to form the backbone of the Polish economy. Mieszko III employed Jews in his mint as engravers and technical supervisors, and the coins minted during that period even bear Hebraic <b>markings.</b> Jews <b>worked</b> on commission for the mints of other contemporary Polish princes, including Casimir the Just, Bolesław I the Tall and Władysław III Spindleshanks. Jews enjoyed undisturbed peace and prosperity in the many principalities into which the country was then divided; they formed the middle class in a country where the general population consisted of landlords (developing into szlachta, the unique Polish nobility) and peasants, and they were instrumental in promoting the commercial interests of the land.|$|R
40|$|Many {{traits in}} animals reduce {{the rate of}} attack from {{visually}} hunting predators, including camouflage, warning signals and mimicry. In addition, some animal markings may reduce the likelihood that an attack ends in successful capture. These might include dazzle markings, high-contrast patterns that make the estimation of speed and trajectory difficult. However, until now, no study has experimentally tested whether some markings may achieve such an effect. We developed a computer ‘game’ where human ‘predators’ have to capture computer-generated prey moving across a background. In two experiments, we find that although uniform camouflaged targets were among the hardest to capture, so were a range of high-contrast conspicuous patterns, such as bands and zigzags. Prey were also more difficult to capture against more heterogeneous than uniform backgrounds, and at faster speeds of movement. As such, we find the first experimental evidence that conspicuous patterns, {{similar to those found}} {{in a wide range of}} real animals, make the capture of moving prey more challenging. Various anti-predator <b>markings</b> may <b>work</b> prey during motion, and some animals may combine such dazzle patterns with other functions, such as camouflage, thermoregulation, sexual and warning signals...|$|R
40|$|The vast {{majority}} of species within the lanternshark genus Etmopterus harbour complex luminescent markings on their flanks, whose functional significance has long remained obscure. Recent studies, however, suggest these enigmatic photophore aggregations {{to play a role}} in intraspecific communication. Using visual modelling based on in vivo luminescence measurements from a common lanternshark species, we show that etmopterid flank <b>markings</b> can potentially <b>work</b> as a medium range signal for intraspecific detection/recognition. In addition, using molecular phylogenetic analyses, we demonstrate that the Etmopterus clade exhibits a greater than expected species richness given its age. This is not the case for other bioluminescent shark clades with no (or only few) species with flank markings. Our results therefore suggest that etmopterid flank markings may provide a way for reproductive isolation and hence may have facilitated speciation in the deep-sea...|$|R
50|$|The term Arabeske is {{used here}} as a poetic metaphor, not only to {{describe}} florid decoration, but also, in Schlegel's terms, to suggest a fluid, organic system of fragments that transcends artificial Classical forms. Schumann employs modified rondo form to encompass a short ABACA rondo form, with the gently lyrical main section A, two more intense episodes B (Florestan) and C, and a beautifully pensive Epilog (Eusebius). The piece moves lithely between contrasting moods, and seems to conclude with a gentle recapitulation of the opening material. The poignant postlude that follows comes as an exquisite surprise. Schumann's original metronome <b>markings</b> for this <b>work</b> {{appear to have been}} too fast. Clara Schumann later revised them as Leicht und zart (crotchet =126), Minore I (crotchet =112), and Minore II (crotchet =120).|$|R
5000|$|S. splendidus {{is one of}} {{only two}} {{vertebrate}} species known to have blue colouring because of cellular pigment, the other being the closely related psychedelic mandarin (S. picturatus). The name [...] "cyanophore" [...] was proposed for the blue chromatophores, or pigment-containing and light-reflecting cells. In all other known cases, the colour blue is structural, as it comes from thin-film interference from piles of flat, thin and reflecting purine crystals. The mandarinfish has a body shape similar to a goby, though this is the only resemblance between the two. The vivid coloration sports a bright blue background, with swirly orange stripes and a blue-greenish face with bold blue stripes. The large pelvic fins are used for 'walking' on the seafloor and are often mistakenly seen as the pectoral fins. The real pectorals are located almost at the center and are nearly transparent, with a tinge of bright blue. Stripes continue onto the second dorsal fin, the anal fins and on part of the tail, the rest of which is striped in vibrant orange and blue. The dorsal fin, which is exceptionally tall in males, has a striking orange-and blue design as well. The eyes are usually red with black pupils. Different varieties <b>sport</b> different <b>markings</b> and colors. The green mandarin is the fish that has been described. The red mandarin is the same species, but its pelvic fins and what would be orange is red. In some rare cases, the entire dragonet is red with black stripes. The spotted mandarin is light gray-green with black, pink and blue spots. Mandarinfish are reef dwellers, preferring sheltered lagoons and inshore reefs. While they are slow-moving and fairly common within their range, they are not easily seen due to their bottom-feeding habit and their small size (reaching only about 6 cm). They feed primarily on small crustaceans and other invertebrates.|$|R
50|$|Salt-making in {{and around}} Greatham (between Hartlepool and Billingham) had been {{important}} in Roman and medieval times, and salt was also produced on Wearside from the 1580s, but by the 16th century the industry had been eclipsed by South Shields on the Tyne. In 1894 the industry returned to Greatham {{with the establishment of}} the Greatham Salt and Brine Company by George Weddell. The works was later purchased by the famous salt-making company Cerebos in 1903. By the mid-20th century, Cerebos was owned by the food conglomerate Rank Hovis McDougall, and the factory closed in 2002. During the 20th century the extraction of salt on the north bank of the River Tees by aqueous hydraulic means resulted in a number of underground salt cavities that are completely impervious to gas and liquids. Consequently, these cavities are now used to store both industrial gases and liquids by companies which are members of the Northeast of England Process Industry Cluster (NEPIC). Today the Huntsman Tioxide is based close to Greatham, operating one of the world's largest chemical plants for the manufacture of titanium dioxide which is the brilliant white pigment used in paints, Polo mints, cosmetics, UV sunscreens, plastics, golf balls and <b>sports</b> field line <b>markings.</b>|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{analysis}} of dynamic <b>markings</b> in 140 <b>works</b> representing three musical periods (Classical, early Romantic, late Romantic) is reported. We tested {{the hypothesis that}} minor-mode music from the Romantic period {{is more likely to}} exhibit louder dynamic levels than minor-mode music from the Classical period. This hypothesis was motivated by the theory that in the Romantic period, in addition to conveying sadness, the minor mode was more likely to be used to convey affects that are associated with higher dynamic levels, such as seriousness, passion or aggression. Our analysis showed no absolute differences regarding the notated dynamic levels of the minor-mode pieces. However, regardless of the musical mode, pieces from the earlier period exhibited higher dynamic levels than pieces from the later periods. This effect is attributable to a decrease in dynamics for major-mode pieces in later musical periods, while minor-mode pieces do not show a change in dynamics over time. Using the mean dynamic level for each period as a reference, these observations are consistent with the theory that Romantic music is more likely than Classical music to employ the minor mode to represent or convey affects that are associated with higher dynamic levels...|$|R
40|$|This book {{is made up}} of four related poetic sequences: ???Vast Lakes,??? ???The Dream-Hack,??? ???Boom Visions,??? and {{sections}} 1 & 2 of ???Diary of a Hive Mind,??? here residing as the ???Pretext??? and ???Envoi. ??? The {{common thread}} among these four sequences is an exploration of the inner workings of a reader???s perceptions of voice, subjectivity and authorship. The hive-mind concept, as used in this work, refers both to the author and to language itself???each interacting with the other, simultaneously passive and active, subject and object. The reader enacts a third layer of interpretation, synthesizing the interplay between speaker and language, into the real. As a token of trust and sincerity, the author has left bare the procedural <b>markings</b> of the <b>work.</b> All pages are images of original documents as created In the moment, complete with typos, cross-outs, and other imperfections. In this way, the work attempts to move outside the category of literary art, to reconnect with another sense of art???art as ritual, as a happening, as the generative power in the world???distinct (though not separate) from the impressions (letters, paint, data, DNA) it leaves behind...|$|R
40|$|This {{portfolio}} of original compositions {{is made up}} of six works, two electroacoustic and four acoustic. Firstly a Piano suite for solo piano, composed of four different short works, exploring different themes and modes based on eight synthetic scales. Cello and cello is a work for two cellos, exploring the sometimes-dual nature of the mind and yourself. Composed in two movements and with the intention of having a slight theatrical aspect to it. An electroacoustic work, Kaffeine is a composition based around the process of coffee making and the effects it has on people who drink it. Made purely from samples collected from a home coffee machine using a digital recorder. Piaonics is another electroacoustic piece, this one focusing on subtle aspects of the pianos timbre. Two sets of synthetic scales where made, each of the notes in the synthetic scale where sampled on a grand piano to get the best quality samples. Pleonasm is an exploratory work for Viola, clarinet and cello. The work has aleotoric aspects to it, wherein parts don’t always start or finish together and sometimes have different tempo <b>markings.</b> The final <b>work</b> in the portfolio is the classical symphony in E minor, written as an exercise to competently write in the style of a traditional classical symphony. The work is in four movements, fast, slow, fast, fast and takes inspiration from Haydn, Prokofiev and Mahler...|$|R
40|$|Displacement is the act {{by which}} fluid {{is forced to}} move by an object {{floating}} or submerged in it. During {{the course of a}} bath, the bather continuously affects the water he/she displaces, creating water distortions that visually contort and fragment the bather. Our human senses cannot fully digest all these nuances made from one simple splash. We are essentially blind to these beautiful milliseconds save {{through the use of a}} camera. In studying my photographic references, I have been able to discern different types of water formations. The complexity of rendering water is its own struggle. More than a few paintings have failed; the water distortion, no matter how exact it is photographically, is still a huge challenge to translate believably into paint. I predominately use two mediums: oil paint and pastel. The ephemeral nature of a splash translates well in pastel, with its thin layers of dusty pigment sitting precariously on the paper 2 ̆ 7 s surface. The properties of oil paint are also incredibly well suited for the subject matter. Its viscous properties are ideal for rendering flesh, and the use of wet media to portray wetness has its own metaphoric appeal. Displacement 2 ̆ 7 s general meaning is the movement of something from its usual or correct place. My work involves placing private intimate scenes in a public setting. I give the viewer permission to publicly take a voyeuristic look into my private life. While the private act of bathing is displaced to a public setting, the visual language that describes this act can be displaced to describe alternative concepts beyond water and flesh. The markings I make that signal water often take on other I associations. Water distortions can become more than water over a surface; they can merge with the bather 2 ̆ 7 s flesh to create deformities. Distorted thumbs can become phallic. Water streaks along the body can become scars and <b>markings.</b> In <b>works</b> that rely on grids and multiples, images from separate scenes are placed together, leading to different readings as a whole than each individual piece would warrant alone. In psychoanalysis, displacement is the transfer of emotion from the original focus to another less threatening object or person. My work is influenced by my unique experience concerning gender and marriage roles. Recently, some emotionally charged family events called into question stereotypes and cliches commonly associated with these roles. In a marriage, can a spouse take ownership of the other 2 ̆ 7 s sexuality? Do the stereotypical ideas of masculinity/active force and femininity/passive entity apply to marriage today as they did in my parents 2 ̆ 7 generation? I acknowledge there are no definite answers to these questions, neither generically nor personally. As this definition of displacement implies, my artwork can serve as the less threatening object onto which I can transfer my emotions. Within my work, I can control my image and that of my husband. I can put my husband in submissive poses, using his image to question the dominating-male stereotype. I can put myself in submissive and objectifying poses, observing my own propensity for submission. I can publicly display my body 2 ̆ 7 s image and be vulnerable to public criticism or praise, while in a small way taking ownership of my sexuality. I can also obscure sexuality through the use of cropping images, letting flesh and body parts become more androgynous. Each definition of displacement manifests itself through the process, working method, subject and psychology of my work. I focus on one experience: the intimate, every-day experience of bathing. While my paintings and drawings are about the act itself, I also use the bather/water relationship to reference conditions of my personal life transcending the bathing process. After three years, I am still very much engaged, challenged and intrigued by water and flesh. I would have never guessed coming into this program, that I would find such rich and diverse subject matter within the small confines of my humble bathroom...|$|R
