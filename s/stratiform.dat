5|$|Rainbands are {{cloud and}} {{precipitation}} areas which are significantly elongated. Rainbands can be <b>stratiform</b> or convective, and are generated by differences in temperature. When noted on weather radar imagery, this precipitation elongation {{is referred to}} as banded structure. Rainbands in advance of warm occluded fronts and warm fronts are associated with weak upward motion, and tend to be wide and <b>stratiform</b> in nature.|$|E
5|$|Cold fronts may feature narrow {{bands of}} {{thunderstorms}} and severe weather, and may on occasion be preceded by squall lines or dry lines. Warm fronts are usually preceded by <b>stratiform</b> precipitation and fog. The weather usually clears quickly after a front's passage. Some fronts produce no precipitation and little cloudiness, {{although there is}} invariably a wind shift.|$|E
5|$|Convective rain, or showery precipitation, occurs from {{convective}} clouds (e.g., cumulonimbus or cumulus congestus). It falls as showers with {{rapidly changing}} intensity. Convective precipitation falls over a certain {{area for a}} relatively short time, as convective clouds have limited horizontal extent. Most precipitation in the tropics appears to be convective; however, {{it has been suggested}} that <b>stratiform</b> precipitation also occurs. Graupel and hail indicate convection. In mid-latitudes, convective precipitation is intermittent and often associated with baroclinic boundaries such as cold fronts, squall lines, and warm fronts.|$|E
5|$|Weather fronts {{mark the}} {{boundary}} between two masses of air of different temperature, humidity, and densities, and {{are associated with the}} most prominent meteorological phenomena. Strong cold fronts typically feature narrow bands of thunderstorms and severe weather, and may on occasion be preceded by squall lines or dry lines. Such fronts form west of the circulation center and generally move from west to east; warm fronts form east of the cyclone center and are usually preceded by <b>stratiform</b> precipitation and fog. Warm fronts move poleward ahead of the cyclone path. Occluded fronts form late in the cyclone life cycle {{near the center of the}} cyclone and often wrap around the storm center.|$|E
5|$|In {{areas where}} the heavy {{rainfall}} {{is associated with a}} wind shift, the wet season is known as the monsoon. Rainfall in the wet season is mainly due to daytime heating which leads to diurnal thunderstorm activity within a pre-existing moist airmass, so the rain mainly falls in late afternoon and early evening in savannah and monsoon regions. Further, much of the total rainfall each day occurs in the first minutes of the downpour, before the storms mature into their <b>stratiform</b> stage. Most places have only one wet season, but areas of the tropics can have two wet seasons, because the monsoon trough, or Intertropical Convergence Zone, can pass over locations in the tropics twice per year. However, since rain forests have rainfall spread evenly through the year, {{they do not have a}} wet season.|$|E
5|$|The Itcha Range is the {{smallest}} shield volcano in the Anahim Volcanic Belt in terms of area covered. Unlike the Rainbow and Ilgachuz ranges, the Itcha Range is composed of small coalescing volcanic units rather than a <b>stratiform</b> volcanic pile. It is, in many respects, similar to the small alkaline shields found in Kenya and Ethiopia along the East African Rift. About 60% of the shield is exposed while roughly 40% of it remains buried under glacial drift deposits. This suggests that the Itcha Range was glaciated repeatedly during the Pleistocene epoch. Glacial striae on polished surfaces {{of some of the}} oldest volcanic rocks {{in the eastern part of}} the shield and the local presence of drift deposits throughout the stratigraphy indicate that glaciation and volcanism were contemporaneous through much of the volcanic history of the Itcha Range.|$|E
5|$|The left {{edge of the}} {{conveyor}} belt is sharp due to higher density air moving in from the west forcing a sharp slope to the cold front. An area of <b>stratiform</b> precipitation develops poleward of the warm front along {{the conveyor}} belt. Active precipitation poleward of the warm front implies potential for greater development of the cyclone. A portion of this conveyor belt turns to the right (left in the Southern Hemisphere), aligning with the upper level westerly flow. However, the western portion of this belt wraps around the northwest (southwest in the Southern Hemisphere) side of the cyclone, which can contain moderate to heavy precipitation. If the air mass is cold enough, the precipitation falls {{in the form of}} heavy snow. Theory from the 1980s talked about the presence of a cold conveyor belt originating north of the warm front and flowing along a clockwise path (in the northern hemisphere) into the main belt of the westerlies aloft, but there has been conflicting evidence {{as to whether or not}} this phenomenon actually exists.|$|E
25|$|Cirrostratus {{is a thin}} non-convective <b>stratiform</b> ice crystal veil that {{typically}} gives rise to halos caused by refraction of the sun's rays. The sun and moon are visible in clear outline.Cirrostratus often thickens into altostratus ahead of a warm front or low-pressure area.|$|E
25|$|The species fractus shows {{variable}} instability {{because it}} can be a subdivision of genus-types of different physical forms that have different stability characteristics. This subtype can be in the form of ragged but mostly stable <b>stratiform</b> sheets (stratus fractus) or small ragged cumuliform heaps with somewhat greater instability (cumulus fractus). When they form at low altitudes, <b>stratiform</b> and cumuliform genus-types can be torn up into shreds by brisk low level winds that create mechanical turbulence against the ground. Fractus clouds can form in precipitation at low altitudes, with or without brisk or gusty winds. They are closely associated with precipitating cloud systems of considerable vertical and sometimes horizontal extent, so they are also classified as accessory clouds under the name pannus (see section on supplementary features).|$|E
25|$|Anvil crawler lightning, {{sometimes}} called Spider lightning is created when leaders propagate through horizontally-extensive charge regions in mature thunderstorms, usually the <b>stratiform</b> regions of mesoscale convective systems. These discharges usually begin as intracloud discharges originating within the convective region; the negative leader end then propagates {{well into the}} aforementioned charge regions in the <b>stratiform</b> area. If the leader becomes too long, it may separate into multiple bidirectional leaders. When this happens, the positive end of the separated leader may strike the ground as a positive CG flash and/or crawl {{on the underside of}} the cloud, creating a spectacular display of lightning crawling across the sky. Ground flashes produced in this manner tend to transfer high amounts of charge, and this can trigger upward lightning flashes and upper-atmospheric lightning.|$|E
25|$|The ore {{materials}} are trapped within a fumarole field or a black smoker field {{when they are}} expelled into the ocean, cool, and precipitate sulfide minerals as <b>stratiform</b> sulfide ore. Some deposits show evidence of formation via deposition of sulfide via replacement of altered volcanosedimentary rocks and may also form by invasion of sulfur-rich brines into unconsolidated sediments.|$|E
25|$|Clouds of this {{structure}} have both cumuliform and <b>stratiform</b> characteristics {{in the form}} of rolls, ripples, or patches. They generally form as a result of limited convection in an otherwise mostly stable airmass topped by an inversion layer. If the inversion layer is absent or higher in the troposphere, increased convective activity may cause the cloud layers to develop tops {{in the form of}} turrets consisting of embedded cumuliform buildups. The stratocumuliform group is divided into cirrocumulus (high-level), altocumulus (mid-level), and stratocumulus (low-level).|$|E
25|$|It is now {{believed}} {{that many of}} the Schumann resonances transients (Q bursts) are related to the transient luminous events (TLEs). In 1995 Boccippio et al. showed that sprites, the most common TLE, are produced by positive cloud-to-ground lightning occurring in the <b>stratiform</b> region of a thunderstorm system, and are accompanied by Q-burst in the Schumann resonances band. Recent observations reveal that occurrences of sprites and Q bursts are highly correlated and Schumann resonances data can possibly be used to estimate the global occurrence rate of sprites.|$|E
25|$|Frontal and {{cyclonic}} lift {{occur when}} stable air is forced aloft at weather fronts and around centers of low pressure. Warm fronts associated with extratropical cyclones tend to generate mostly cirriform and <b>stratiform</b> clouds {{over a wide}} area unless the approaching warm airmass is unstable, in which case cumulus congestus or cumulonimbus clouds will usually be embedded in the main precipitating cloud layer. Cold fronts are usually faster moving and generate a narrower line of clouds which are mostly stratocumuliform, cumuliform, or cumulonimbiform depending on {{the stability of the}} warm air mass just ahead of the front.|$|E
500|$|This also forces {{temperature}} {{differences across}} warm fronts to be broader in scale. [...] Clouds {{ahead of the}} warm front are mostly <b>stratiform,</b> and rainfall gradually increases as the front approaches. [...] Fog can also occur preceding a warm frontal passage. [...] Clearing and warming is usually rapid after frontal passage. [...] If the warm air mass is unstable, thunderstorms may be embedded among the <b>stratiform</b> clouds ahead of the front, and after frontal passage thundershowers may continue. [...] On weather maps, the surface location of a warm front is marked with a red line of semicircles pointing {{in the direction of}} travel.|$|E
500|$|Cold fronts may feature narrow {{bands of}} {{thunderstorms}} and severe weather, and may on occasion be preceded by squall lines or dry lines. Warm fronts are usually preceded by <b>stratiform</b> precipitation and fog. The weather usually clears quickly after a front's passage. Some fronts produce no precipitation and little cloudiness, {{although there is}} invariably a wind shift.|$|E
500|$|Rainbands {{in advance}} of warm {{occluded}} fronts and warm fronts are associated with weak upward motion, and tend to be wide and <b>stratiform</b> in nature. [...] In an atmosphere with rich low level moisture and vertical wind shear, narrow, convective rainbands known as squall lines generally in the cyclone's warm sector, ahead of strong cold fronts associated with extratropical cyclones. [...] Wider rain bands can occur behind cold fronts, which {{tend to have more}} <b>stratiform,</b> and less convective, precipitation. [...] Within the cold sector north to northwest of a cyclone center, in colder cyclones, small scale, or mesoscale, bands of heavy snow can occur within a cyclone's comma head precipitation pattern with a width of [...] to [...] [...] These bands in the comma head are associated with areas of frontogensis, or zones of strengthening temperature contrast. [...] Southwest of extratropical cyclones, curved flow bringing cold air across the relatively warm Great Lakes can lead to narrow lake effect snow bands which bring significant localized snowfall.|$|E
500|$|In the southwest, around Bantry Bay and the {{mountains}} of Macgillicuddy's Reeks, {{is an area of}} substantially deformed, but only lightly metamorphosed, Devonian-aged rocks. This partial ring of [...] "hard rock" [...] geology is covered by a blanket of Carboniferous limestone over the centre of the country, giving rise to a comparatively fertile and lush landscape. The west-coast district of the Burren around Lisdoonvarna has well-developed karst features. Significant <b>stratiform</b> lead-zinc mineralisation is found in the limestones around Silvermines and Tynagh.|$|E
500|$|Warm fronts {{mark the}} {{position}} on the Earth's surface where a relatively warm body of air has displaced colder air. The temperature increase {{is located on the}} equatorward edge of the gradient in isotherms, and lies within broader low pressure troughs than is the case with cold fronts. Warm fronts move more slowly than do the cold fronts because cold air is denser, and harder to displace from the Earth's surface. This causes temperature differences across warm fronts to be broader in scale. The warm air mass overrides the cold air mass and temperature changes occur at higher altitudes before those at the surface. [...] Clouds ahead of the warm front are mostly <b>stratiform</b> and rainfall gradually increases as the front approaches. Fog can also occur preceding a warm front passage. Clearing and warming is usually rapid after the passage of a warm front. If the warm air mass is unstable, mixing of the warm moist air will produce thunderstorms that are embedded among the <b>stratiform</b> clouds ahead of the front, and after frontal passage, thundershowers may continue. On weather maps, the surface location of a warm front is marked with a red line of half circles pointing in the direction of travel.|$|E
500|$|There {{are three}} main genera {{in the family}} of high clouds: cirrus, cirrocumulus, and cirrostratus. Cirrostratus clouds {{commonly}} produce halos because they are composed almost entirely of ice crystals. Cirrocumulus and cirrostratus are sometimes informally referred to as [...] "cirriform clouds" [...] because of their frequent association with cirrus. They are given the prefix [...] "cirro-", but this refers more to their altitude range than their physical structure. Cirrocumulus in its pure form is actually a high cumuliform genus, and cirrostratus is <b>stratiform,</b> like altostratus and lower based sheet clouds.|$|E
500|$|A rainband is a {{cloud and}} {{precipitation}} structure {{associated with an}} area of rainfall which is significantly elongated. [...] Rainbands can be <b>stratiform</b> or convective, and are generated by differences in temperature. [...] When noted on weather radar imagery, this precipitation elongation {{is referred to as}} banded structure. [...] Rainbands within tropical cyclones are curved in orientation. [...] Tropical cyclone rainbands contain showers and thunderstorms that, together with the eyewall and the eye, constitute a hurricane or tropical storm. [...] The extent of rainbands around a tropical cyclone can help determine the cyclone's intensity.|$|E
500|$|For thunderstorms, outflow {{tends to}} {{indicate}} {{the development of a}} system. [...] Large quantities of outflow at the upper levels of a thunderstorm indicate its development. [...] Too much outflow in the lower levels of a thunderstorm, however, can choke off the low-level inflow which fuels it. [...] Squall lines typically bow out the most, or bend the most convex outward, at the leading edge of low level outflow due to the formation of a mesoscale high-pressure area which forms within the <b>stratiform</b> rain area behind the initial line. [...] This high-pressure area is formed due to strong descending motion behind the squall line, and could {{come in the form of}} a downburst.|$|E
500|$|Cumulus {{clouds are}} a genus of free-convective low-étage cloud {{along with the}} related limited-convective {{cumuliform}} or stratocumuliform cloud stratocumulus. These clouds form from ground level to [...] at all latitudes. Stratus clouds are also low-étage. In the middle étage are the alto clouds, which consist of the limiited-convective cumuliform or stratocumuliform cloud altocumulus and the <b>stratiform</b> cloud altostratus. Middle-étage clouds form from [...] to [...] in polar areas, [...] in temperate areas, and [...] in tropical areas. The high-étage clouds are all cirriform, one of which, cirrocumulus, is also cumuliform of limited convection or stratocumuliform. The other clouds in this étage are cirrus and cirrostratus. High-étage clouds form [...] in high latitudes, [...] in temperate latitudes, and [...] in low, tropical latitudes. Cumulonimbus clouds, like cumulus congestus, extend vertically rather than remaining confined to one étage.|$|E
500|$|<b>Stratiform</b> (a broad {{shield of}} {{precipitation}} {{with a relatively}} similar intensity) and dynamic precipitation (convective precipitation which is showery in nature with large changes in intensity over short distances) occur {{as a consequence of}} slow ascent of air in synoptic systems (on the order of cm/s), such as in the vicinity of cold fronts and near and poleward of surface warm fronts. Similar ascent is seen around tropical cyclones outside of the eyewall, and in comma-head precipitation patterns around mid-latitude cyclones. A wide variety of weather can be found along an occluded front, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage is associated with a drying of the air mass. Occluded fronts usually form around mature low-pressure areas. What separates rainfall from other precipitation types, such as ice pellets and snow, is the presence of a thick layer of air aloft which is above the melting point of water, which melts the frozen precipitation well before it reaches the ground. If there is a shallow near surface layer that is below freezing, freezing rain (rain which freezes on contact with surfaces in subfreezing environments) will result. Hail becomes an increasingly infrequent occurrence when the freezing level within the atmosphere exceeds [...] above ground level.|$|E
500|$|Isaac Cline was {{the first}} to {{investigate}} rainfall distribution around tropical cyclones in the early 1900s. [...] He found that a larger proportion of rainfall falls in advance of the center (or eye) than after the center's passage, with the highest percentage falling in the right front quadrant. [...] Father Viñes of Cuba found that some tropical cyclones have their highest rainfall rates in the rear quadrant within a training (non-moving) inflow band. [...] Normally, as a tropical cyclone intensifies, its heavier rainfall rates become more concentrated around its center. [...] Rainfall is found to be heaviest in tropical cyclone's inner core, whether it be the eyewall or central dense overcast, within a degree latitude of the center, with lesser amounts farther away from the center. Most of the rainfall in tropical cyclones is concentrated within its radius of gale-force (34knots/39mph/63km/h) winds. [...] Rainfall is more common near the center of tropical cyclones overnight. [...] Over land, outer bands are more active during the heating of the day, which can act to restrict inflow {{into the center of the}} cyclone. [...] Recent studies have shown that half of the rainfall within a tropical cyclone is <b>stratiform</b> in nature. [...] The chart to the right was developed by Riehl in 1954 using meteorological equations that assume a gale radius of about , a fairly symmetric cyclone, and does not consider topographic effects or vertical wind shear. [...] Local amounts can exceed this chart by a factor of two due to topography. [...] Wind shear tends to lessen the amounts below what is shown on the table.|$|E
2500|$|Non-convective <b>stratiform</b> clouds {{appear in}} stable airmass {{conditions}} and, in general, have flat sheet-like structures that can form at any altitude in the troposphere. [...] Very low <b>stratiform</b> cloud results when advection fog is lifted above surface level during breezy conditions. [...] The <b>stratiform</b> group is divided by altitude range into the genera cirrostratus (high-level), altostratus (mid-level), stratus (low-level), and nimbostratus (multi-level).|$|E
2500|$|The apron zone is {{generally}} more oxidised, with <b>stratiform,</b> laminated sulfidic sediments, similar to SEDEX ores, and {{is generally}} manganese, barium and hematite enriched, with cherts, jaspers and chemical sediments common.|$|E
2500|$|This is a flat or {{sometimes}} ragged non-convective <b>stratiform</b> type that sometimes resembles elevated fog. [...] Only very weak precipitation can fall from this cloud (usually drizzle or snow grains), although heavier rain or snow may fall through a stratus layer from a higher precipitating cloud deck. When a low <b>stratiform</b> cloud contacts the ground, {{it is called}} fog if the prevailing surface visibility is less than 1 kilometer, although radiation and advection types of fog tend to form in clear air rather than from stratus layers. [...] If the visibility increases to 1 kilometer or higher {{in any kind of}} fog, the visible condensation is termed mist.|$|E
2500|$|The Red Dog {{area has}} the world's largest known zinc deposits: the four at Red Dog {{as well as}} Anarraaq and Su-Lik, {{respectively}} [...] northwest. They are <b>stratiform</b> massive sulfide bodies hosted in Carboniferous black shale and altered carbonates.|$|E
2500|$|VMS {{deposits}} have {{an ideal}} {{form of a}} conical area of highly altered volcanic or volcanogenic sedimentary rock within the feeder zone, which is called the stringer sulfide or stockwork zone, overlain by a mound of massive exhalites, and flanked by <b>stratiform</b> exhalative sulfides known as the apron.|$|E
2500|$|These {{deposits}} {{are also}} sometimes called volcanic-hosted massive sulfide (VHMS) deposits. The density generally is 4500kg/m3. They are predominantly <b>stratiform</b> accumulations of sulfide minerals that precipitate from hydrothermal fluids on {{or below the}} seafloor {{in a wide range}} of ancient and modern geological settings. In modern oceans they are synonymous with sulfurous plumes called black smokers.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the initial}} {{passage of a}} squall line, light to {{moderate}} <b>stratiform</b> precipitation is also common. A Bow echo is frequently seen on {{the northern and southern}} most reaches of squall line thunderstorms (via satellite imagery). This is where the northern and southern ends curl backwards towards the middle portions of the squall line, making a [...] "bow" [...] shape. Bow echoes are frequently featured within supercell mesoscale systems.|$|E
2500|$|Of the <b>stratiform</b> group, {{high-level}} cirrostratus comprises two species. [...] Cirrostratus nebulosus has {{a rather}} diffuse appearance lacking in structural detail. [...] Cirrostratus fibratus is a species made of semi-merged filaments that are transitional {{to or from}} cirrus. Mid-level altostratus and multi-level nimbostratus always have a flat or diffuse appearance and are therefore not subdivided into species. Low stratus is of the species nebulosus except when broken up into ragged sheets of stratus fractus (see below).|$|E
2500|$|Both Jupiter and Saturn have {{an outer}} cirriform cloud deck {{composed}} of ammonia, [...] an intermediate <b>stratiform</b> haze-cloud layer made of ammonium hydrosulfide, [...] and an inner deck of cumulus water clouds. Embedded cumulonimbus {{are known to}} exist near the Great Red Spot on Jupiter. The same category-types can be found covering Uranus, and Neptune, but are all composed of methane. [...] Saturn's moon Titan has cirrus clouds believed to be composed largely of methane. The Cassini–Huygens Saturn mission uncovered evidence of polar stratospheric clouds and a fluid cycle on Titan, including lakes near the poles and fluvial channels {{on the surface of}} the moon.|$|E
2500|$|Cloud cover {{has been}} seen on most other planets in the solar system. Venus's thick clouds are {{composed}} of sulfur dioxide (due to volcanic activity) and appear to be almost entirely <b>stratiform.</b> They are arranged in three main layers at altitudes of 45 to 65km that obscure the planet's surface and can produce virga. No embedded cumuliform types have been identified, but broken stratocumuliform wave formations are sometimes seen in the top layer that reveal more continuous layer clouds underneath. [...] On Mars, noctilucent, cirrus, cirrocumulus and stratocumulus composed of water-ice have been detected mostly near the poles. [...] Water-ice fogs have also been detected on Mars.|$|E
2500|$|High clouds form at altitudes of [...] in {{the polar}} regions, [...] in the {{temperate}} regions and [...] in the tropics. [...] All cirriform clouds {{are classified as}} high and thus constitute a single genus cirrus (Ci). Stratocumuliform and <b>stratiform</b> clouds in the high altitude range carry the prefix cirro-, yielding the respective genus names cirrocumulus (Cc) and cirrostratus (Cs). [...] When limited-resolution satellite images of high clouds are analysed without supporting data from direct human observations, it becomes impossible to distinguish between individual forms or genus types, which are then collectively identified as high-type (or informally as cirrus-type even though not all high clouds are of the cirrus form or genus).|$|E
