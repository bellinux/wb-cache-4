25|$|In reptiles, {{sound is}} {{transmitted}} to the inner ear by the stapes (<b>stirrup)</b> <b>bone</b> of the middle ear. This is pressed against the oval window, a membrane-covered opening {{on the surface of}} the vestibule. From here, sound waves are conducted through a short perilymphatic duct to a second opening, the round window, which equalizes pressure, allowing the incompressible fluid to move freely. Running parallel with the perilymphatic duct is a separate blind-ending duct, the lagena, filled with endolymph. The lagena is separated from the perilymphatic duct by a basilar membrane, and contains the sensory hair cells that finally translate the vibrations in the fluid into nerve signals. It is attached at one end to the saccule.|$|E

In this paper, three examples of process development for biocompatible materials are discussed. Pilot scale production of {{a replica of the}} smallest human bone (<b>stirrup</b> <b>bone)</b> made by mu-MIM of Titanium is shown. Microstructure and properties of the material are investigated. As a second example, the development of mu-MIM technology for Nickel-Titanium parts with phase transformation temperatures in the range of body temperature for biomedical applications is presented. As a third example, micro-structuring of metallic surfaces for metal-based implants by mu-MIM is evaluated. Results on the development of moulding and sintering 316 L stainless steel substrates using blends of micron and nano sized powders are shown. Repetitive micro surface patterns that were obtained in the form of protruding hemispheres showed improved bioactivity compared to non-structured tissue control samples...|$|E
40|$|The two-photon photopolymerization of resins by focused {{laser light}} in {{principle}} enables the fabrication of structures with details below the diffraction limit. However, the method {{can be highly}} susceptible to aberrations, which hinders the fabrication of structures that are larger than, e. g., the working distance of the microscope objective. Here, two-photon polymerization is extended to the fabrication of macroscopic structures by making use of medium numerical-aperture microscope objectives. By introducing a substrate holder movable in the axial direction {{it is possible to}} keep the focusing conditions constant and to fabricate very large structures with heights that are not limited by the working distance of the objective. Moreover, the constant focusing conditions enable us to quantify spherical aberrations by experimental mapping of the optical point-spread function, which manifests itself in the shape of singe photo-polymerized voxels. By monitoring such shapes it is possible to minimize aberrations. Effective aberration control enables us to fabricate large but detailed biomedical scaffolds with interconnected pores, e. g., {{in the shape of a}} human <b>stirrup</b> <b>bone...</b>|$|E

For that the research will be carried out experimental studies comparing variations dash angled towards the shear strength of reinforced concrete beams. In this study will be made of 3 pieces slanted stirrups variations, ie sloping concrete beams cross bar welded middle (B 2), sloping concrete beams cross bar latches satandar 135 ° (B 3), concrete beam welding sloping top corner stirrups (B 4) and 1 piece of concrete beams without cross bar that serves as a control beam (B 1) with dimensions of beams used 100 x 200 x 2200 mm, the tests performed by a single point loading {{in the middle of the}} span. Based on the results of the 3 variations slanted stirrups, stirrups with slanting beam welding center (B 2) was able to withstand the load Pu = 44. 72 KN, shear force Vu = 22. 84 KN and beam capacity rose 15. 81 %, sloping beams with stirrups standard hooks (B 3) capable of withstanding the load Pu = 53. 625 KN, shear force Vu = 27. 29 KN and capacities up 38. 89 % beams, welded beams with stirrups sloping top corner (B 4) capable of withstanding the load Pu = 54. 580 KN, shear force Vu = 27. 87 KN and beam capacity rose 41. 88 % of the beam without using stirrups...|$|R

25|$|The stapes (<b>stirrup)</b> ossicle <b>bone</b> of {{the middle}} ear transmits {{vibrations}} to the fenestra ovalis (oval window) {{on the outside of the}} cochlea, which vibrates the perilymph in the vestibular duct (upper chamber of the cochlea). The ossicles are essential for efficient coupling of sound waves into the cochlea, since the cochlea environment is a fluid–membrane system, and it takes more pressure to move sound through fluid–membrane waves than it does through air; a pressure increase is achieved by the area ratio of the tympanic membrane to the oval window, resulting in a pressure gain of about 20 from the original sound wave pressure in air. This gain is a form of impedance matching – to match the soundwave travelling through air to that travelling in the fluid–membrane system.|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{the scope of the}} micro metal {{injection}} moulding (micro-MIM) technology has expanded from iron-based materials to a considerable range of functional materials for medical applications. In this presentation, four examples of process development for biocompatible materials are discussed. The development of the micro-MIM technology for Nickel-Titanium (NiTi) parts with phase transformation temperatures in the range of 37 deg C for biomedical applications is presented. Micro tensile test specimens were injection moulded and sintered using various processing parameters. Following a range of optimisation steps concerning moulding and sintering, relative densities of 98 % along were obtained. As a second example, micro-structuring of metallic surfaces for metal-based implants by micro-MIM were evaluated. Results on the development of moulding and sintering 316 L stainless steel micro structured components using blends of micron and nano sized powders are shown. Micro surface patterns made of hexagonally arranged hemispheres with a diameter between 6 and 50 micrometer showed improved bioactivity compared to non-structured tissue control samples. As third and fourth application example implant components made of Ti and Ti-alloys are presented. The pilot scale production of a replica of the <b>stirrup</b> <b>bone</b> made by micro-MIM of Ti is shown. Microstructure and properties of the material were investigated. Additionally the development of a Ti-alloy heard valve is presented. The heart valve represents a control of the blood stream in the heart muscle. Therefore it is necessary to take the streamlined design of the final geometry of the injection moulding tool into account in order to avoid blood damages. The intention of these investigations was to demonstrate the applicability of the micro- MIM production regarding precision and reproducibility of the process and to show the processibility of different biocompatible materials for medical applications, especially implants...|$|E
