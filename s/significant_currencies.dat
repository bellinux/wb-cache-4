From 2007 to 2008, the decline in the U.S. dollar against other <b>significant</b> <b>currencies</b> was also considered as a significant reason for the oil {{price increases}}, as the dollar lost approximately 14% of its value against the Euro from May 2007 to May 2008.|$|E
40|$|World {{currency}} network constitutes one of {{the most}} complex structures that is associated with the contemporary civilization. On a way towards quantifying its characteristics we study the cross correlations in changes of the daily foreign exchange rates within the basket of 60 currencies in the period December 1998 [...] May 2005. Such a dynamics turns out to predominantly involve one outstanding eigenvalue of the correlation matrix. The magnitude of this eigenvalue depends however crucially on which currency is used as a base currency for the remaining ones. Most prominent it looks {{from the perspective of a}} peripheral currency. This largest eigenvalue is seen to systematically decrease and thus the structure of correlations becomes more heterogeneous, when more <b>significant</b> <b>currencies</b> are used as reference. An extreme case in this later respect is the USD in the period considered. Besides providing further insight into subtle nature of complexity, these observations point to a formal procedure that in general can be used for practical purposes of measuring the relative currencies significance on various time horizons. ...|$|E

A central {{finding is that}} these episodes are very divergent and can be usefully classified, {{on the basis of}} cluster analysis, in three groups. A majority of cases is characterised by internal adjustment, exhibiting slowing domestic demand growth. In some cases, the adjustment was mainly external, facilitated by an exchange rate depreciation but without economic slowdown. Finally, some cases involved a crisis-like combination of a severe slowdown and a <b>significant</b> <b>currency</b> depreciation. Using a multinomial logit, we find that this classification of episodes helps improve the predictability of current account adjustment. external imbalances, current account adjustment, cluster analysis, multinomial logit...|$|R

However, a certain conceptual inflexibility arises when the distinction is applied to complex social situations. This article examines the main approaches to inclusion/exclusion in the sociological tradition, systems theory and the theory of new inequalities. On this basis, five interrelated situations of inclusion and exclusion are constructed: self-inclusion/self-exclusion, inclusion by risk/exclusion by danger, compensatory inclusion, inclusion in exclusion and sub-inclusion. They are illustrated with specific examples to refine an analytical approach to problems of inclusion and exclusion, {{with a view to}} contributing to sociological analysis and to assessing the consequences of public and private decisions...|$|R
50|$|Firstly, {{liability}} dollarization (see Domestic liability dollarization) is {{one main}} reason against floating exchange rate. It {{refers to the}} situations where liabilities are denominated in foreign currencies (usually denominated in US dollar) while assets are in the local currency. Consequently. liability dollarization is also used interchangeably with currency mismatch. Under this currency mismatch, an unexpected depreciation of local currency would deteriorate bank and corporation's balance sheets, and the shrink in asset relative to foreign currency debts would threaten {{the stability of the}} financial system in local country. In countries with <b>significant</b> <b>currency</b> mismatches, the balance sheet effect is quite substantial, ignoring the high exchange rate volatility can prove to be very costly. This could provide an argument for sterilized foreign market intervention.|$|R

The empirical findings suggest that membership in a currency union should benefit Africa as much as it does the rest of the world. In addition, for both samples, we find evidence that (1) there is a <b>significant</b> <b>currency</b> union trade-generating effect; (2) currency unions are associated with trade creation and increased price comovements among member countries; and (3) the duration of currency union membership matters for trade: longer duration brings about greater benefits, and vice versa, however with some diminishing returns. ...|$|R

40|$|Foreign {{currency}} denominated debt as {{an influence}} of exchange rate pressure during the 2008 global crisis is explored across 58 countries. Countries with higher ratios of foreign currency denominated debt to total international debt experienced <b>significant</b> <b>currency</b> depreciation during the global crisis. Predicted values of foreign currency denominated indebtedness are obtained based on country characteristics by employing a double censored tobit model estimation technique. Comparison of actual to predicted values {{just prior to}} the crisis demonstrates whether or not countries are over-indebted. According to our analysis, over-indebted countries experienced higher rates of exchange rate depreciation in the global crisis of 2008. Additionally, oil exporters, countries with strong financial linkages with the US and net importers experienced significant depreciation. International reserve accumulation before the crisis is associated with currency appreciation during the crisis. However, this result is insignificantly estimated...|$|R

Our main conclusion is that, even though the problem {{has to be taken}} seriously, its order of magnitude should not be exaggerated. Only a few sectors are at significant risk: public debts of Greece and Portugal, financial sectors of Greece, Ireland and Luxembourg. In particular, the consequences for the non- financial private sector should be manageable.

40|$|We review {{some aspects}} of {{financial}} dollarization in Russia, applying the main relevant theories to analyze the dynamics of several dollarization indicators. An econometric model of the short run dynamics of deposit and loan dollarization is estimated for the last decade. We find that ruble appreciation was the main driver of the de-dollarization that occurred then and of the later episode of renewed dollarization. We estimate the overall (and sectoral) currency mismatches of the Russian economy. The results show a gradual improvement of the net foreign currency position of the public sector, where we have seen significant accumulation of international reserves by the Bank of Russia and repayment of government debt.

40|$|While the {{importance}} of currency movements to industry competitiveness is theoretically well established, {{there is little evidence}} that currency risk impacts US industries. Applying a conditional asset pricing model to 36 US industries, we find that all industries have a <b>significant</b> <b>currency</b> premium that adds about 2. 47 percentage points to the cost of equity and accounts for approximately 11. 7 % of total risk premium in absolute value. Cross-industry variation in the currency premium is explained by foreign income, industry competitiveness, leverage, liquidity, and other industry characteristics, while its time variation is explained by US aggregate foreign trade, monetary policy, growth opportunities, and other macro variables. The results indicate that methodological weakness, not hedging, explains the insignificant industry currency risk premium found in previous work, thus resolving the puzzle that currency risk premium is important at the aggregate stock market level, but not at the industry level.

40|$|Whilst {{the term}} ecotour was first coined {{half a century}} ago, it did not gain <b>significant</b> <b>currency</b> in the {{academic}} tourism literature until the 1990 s (Weaver and Lawton 2007). Though a much contested concept in a technical sense, it has found considerable favour in political debate, albeit often in ways which do not mesh well with scholarly definitions (Weaver and Lawton 2007). In recent years, a number of parallel or similar terms have also gained in popularity. These include product-based concepts such as nature-based tourism, management-based concepts such as sustainable tourism, and socially based concepts such as responsible tourism.

40|$|Before the crisis, {{cross-border}} {{funding in}} foreign currencies strongly acceler-ated. Foreign currency lending to house-holds {{and to other}} unhedged borrowers was prevalent, implying <b>significant</b> <b>currency</b> risks for the borrowers as well as credit and funding risks for the lenders. When the crisis erupted in 2008, large vulnerabilities {{in the form of}} excessive leverage and foreign cur-rency loans were exposed. On the one hand, cross-border net lending turned negative and new loan syndications dropped sharply. On the other hand, weakening currencies inflated loan instalments and caused financial diffi-culties for unhedged borrowers. These problems have stressed the necessity for measures to strengthen local currency funding and lending by developing domestic capital markets as well as by encouraging long-term savings and investments. 1 This paper is structured as follows: Section 1 summarizes the benefits of developed capital markets.

40|$|The Australian {{economy has}} gone through a number of {{significant}} reforms and structural changes during the past few decades. The overall impact of these reforms on the economy has been positive as indicated by the strong growth. Due to rising demand in the domestic market and <b>significant</b> <b>currency</b> depreciation, the economy was also able to withstand the Asian financial crisis of 1997 - 98. This paper examines some of the main factors that have contributed to economic growth and growth in productivity in Australia. The paper also considers issues such as the rising current account deficit and house borrowing which can slow down the rate of economic growth in Australia. The paper argues that the most recent economic growth has been largely reliant on rising domestic demand. The household saving ratio during 2002 and 2003 has been negative indicating that the economic growth at least in the short-term would have to be fulled by export growth.

The focus of this investigation is on preparedness of mainstream primary school teachers in implementing inclusive education policy in the Nongoma circuit. The lack of teachers prepared to provide quality inclusive teaching to learners and the limitations of existing support structures both impact on inclusion. Through a questionnaire an effort was made to ascertain teachers’ preparedness for inclusive education in the Nongoma circuit. This measure was utilized to determine the extent to which teachers are prepared for the implementation of inclusive education in the classroom. It was also used to describe the nature of training provided by District Based Support Team in an advancement of inclusive education practices in the classroom.

40|$|Albeit with {{different}} conceptualisations, the engagement between universities and external communi- ties continues to gain <b>significant</b> <b>currency.</b> While the emphasis {{has been on}} more socio-economic relevance {{in a period of}} significant financial constraints and a changing clientele, a more significant area of engagement has been on promoting the scholarship of engagement towards regional/local development. The praxis and outcomes of community engagement continues to be surrounded by strong debate on issue such as its impact on the core functions of the university, teaching and research. This article sheds light on the community engagement practices from a case-study university in Africa. Using Ernest Boyer’s proposed scholarship of engagement model as a framework, findings provide evidence that, different contextual specificities affect the way university-community engagement practices evolve. The methodology involved an analysis of primary and secondary data collected through interviews with policy and academic staff. The article concludes with an argument that the success of university-community engagement in fostering social and economic development significantly relates to how much the practices of engagement is foregrounded in the universities’ core policy and practice. But also on how much academic scholarship draws on engagement activities. The challenge lies in ensuring this balance. Norwegian Research Development Agency, NORAD.

The authors suggest these developments are significant and worthy of careful scholarly attention, drawing on the disciplines and expertise of both criminology and theology and religious studies, to the mutual enrichment of both. Through such cross-disciplinary engagement a richer picture is possible in which the significance of religion {{in a number of areas}} of policing policy and practice may be both recognised and seen to be interrelated. One immediate consequence is suggested: a different context of interpretation for police engagement with faith communities for the purposes of counterterrorism – the one area of policing where religion emerges as a theme in scholarly study.
