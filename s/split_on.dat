40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of {{magnitude}} of <b>split</b> size <b>on</b> short-term post-split returns as well as {{the effect of}} <b>split</b> announcement <b>on</b> post-split returns, using stocks data from Shanghai Stock Exchange. The study uses OLS model to test for the relationship, controlling for stock characteristics and the market effect. The main regression models find positive significant effect of <b>split</b> size <b>on</b> post-split returns, but no significant effect of <b>split</b> announcement <b>on</b> post-split returns. The results from robustness checks reject the positive significance of <b>split</b> size <b>on</b> returns. One possible explanation for the significance in the main regression is that the outlier points created biases in OLS model. Overall, this study finds no significant effect of <b>split</b> size <b>on</b> short-term post-split returns nor that of <b>split</b> announcement <b>on</b> returns...|$|R

5|$|Despite the loss, Weaver still {{believed}} the Populist cause would triumph. He {{agreed to be}} nominated one last time for his old 6th district House seat on a Democratic-Populist fusion ticket. As he had ten years earlier, Republican John Lacey defeated Weaver. In 1900, Weaver attended a convention of fusionist Populists in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, the party having <b>split</b> <b>on</b> the issue of cooperation with the Democrats. The fusionists backed Bryan, the Democratic nominee, but he lost again to McKinley, this time by a greater margin. The following year, Weaver was elected to office {{for the last time}} as the mayor of his hometown, Colfax, Iowa.|$|E
5|$|During the Croatian War of Independence, Mukos {{was part}} of a {{tactical}} group tasked with enforcing a naval blockade of the city of <b>Split.</b> <b>On</b> 14 November 1991, Croatian Navy commandos disabled the vessel with an improvised torpedo, leaving the vessel drifting and abandoned by her crew. The crippled ship was then tugged away by Croatian locals to the nearby island of Šolta. She was subsequently repaired and entered service with the Croatian Navy as Šolta. As of 2014, Šolta remains in service with the Croatian Coast Guard, {{an integral part of the}} navy.|$|E

No other significant changes occurred until February7, 1929, when the five districts were re-organized into three (Krasnogvardeysky, Psekupsky, and Shovgenovsky). When North Caucasus Krai was <b>split</b> <b>on</b> January10, 1934, Adyghe Autonomous Oblast was subordinated {{to the newly}} created Azov-Black Sea Krai.

However, they decided to separate in 1988, and were divorced two years later; Horton later blamed the <b>split</b> <b>on</b> their devotion to their work rather than on their marriage.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Pulos and Hutt's work, {{researchers}} were <b>split</b> <b>on</b> {{the mode of}} inheritance of white and whether it was deleterious (harmful). Recent research has discovered several possible genetic pathways to a white coat, so disparities in these historical findings may reflect the action of different genes.

Therefore, it remains to be proven whether all equine dominant white mutations cause embryonic lethality in the homozygous state.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} Zeeman {{splitting}} in lateral quantum dots that are defined in GaAs-AlGaAs het- erostructures {{by means of}} split gates. We demonstrate a non-linear dependence of the <b>splitting</b> <b>on</b> magnetic field and its substantial variations from dot to dot and from heterostructure to het- erostructure. These phenomena are important {{in the context of}} information processing since the tunability and dot-dependence of the Zeeman splitting allow for a selective manipulation of spins. We show that spin-orbit effects related to the GaAs band structure quantitatively explain the ob- served magnitude of the non-linear dependence of the Zeeman splitting. Furthermore, spin-orbit effects result in a dependence of the Zeeman <b>splitting</b> <b>on</b> predominantly the out-of-plane quantum dot confinement energy. We also show that the variations of the confinement energy due to charge disorder in the heterostructure may explain the dependence of Zeeman <b>splitting</b> <b>on</b> the dot position. This position may be varied by changing the gate voltages which leads to an electrically tunable Zeeman splitting...|$|R

Many questions remain in the basal relationships among endopterygote orders, particularly the Hymenoptera.|$|E
5|$|The Sivakasi {{municipality}} {{was established}} in 1920.

It was promoted to a second-grade municipality in 1978, first-grade in 1978, selection-grade in 1998 and special-grade in 2013. Over the decades after independence, Sivakasi grew as an industrial town specialising in firecracker, match and printing industries.

5000|$|It is also {{possible}} to define a k-d tree with points stored solely in leaves. This form of k-d tree allows a variety of split mechanics other than the standard median split. The midpoint <b>splitting</b> rule selects <b>on</b> {{the middle of the}} longest axis of the space being searched, regardless of the distribution of points. This guarantees that the aspect ratio will be at most 2:1, but the depth is dependent on the distribution of points. A variation, called sliding-midpoint, only <b>splits</b> <b>on</b> the middle if there are points {{on both sides of the}} split. Otherwise, it <b>splits</b> <b>on</b> point nearest to the middle.

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{emerged into}} the Atlantic Ocean {{from the west}} coast of Africa on September12. The wave moved westward across the Atlantic basin with minimal deep convection. By September23, it reached the eastern Pacific Ocean and began increasing in shower and thunderstorm activity over the next few days. While located near Acapulco another burst in convection occurred on September25, likely due to interaction with the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Around that time, the National Hurricane Center began Tropical Weather Outlooks (TWOs) on the system, which is information issued every six hours on significant areas of disturbed weather and their potential for development out to 48hours. The tropical wave <b>split</b> <b>on</b> September26, with the northern portion moving northwestward near the southwestern coast of Mexico. By September27, the system had organized deep convection and was producing tropical storm force winds, but data from scatterometers indicated that it lacked a closed circulation. Although TWOs issued on September27 predicted a high probability for development, the chances for tropical cyclogenesis was decreased later that day, due to the system's close proximity to land.|$|E
5|$|ACLU {{leadership}} was <b>split</b> <b>on</b> whether to purge its leadership of communists. Norman Thomas, John Haynes Holmes, and Morris Ernst were anti-communists {{who wanted to}} distance the ACLU from communism; opposing them were Harry Ward, Corliss Lamont and Elizabeth Flynn who rejected any political test for ACLU leadership. A bitter struggle ensued throughout 1939, and the anti-communists prevailed in February 1940, when the board voted to prohibit anyone who supported totalitarianism from ACLU leadership roles. Chairman Harry Ward immediately resigned, andfollowing a contentious six-hour debateElizabeth Flynn was voted off the ACLU's board. The 1940 resolution was {{considered by many to}} be a betrayal of its fundamental principles. The resolution was rescinded in 1968, and Flynn was posthumously reinstated to the ACLU in 1970.|$|E
5|$|After {{four hours}} of negotiations, the {{agreement}} was signed by Croatian Defence Minister Gojko Šušak and deputy commander of the JNA's 5th Military District Lieutenant Colonel General Andrija Rašeta in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, on 2 January 1992. It was the 15th ceasefire agreement signed {{since the start of}} the Croatian War of Independence on 31 March 1991. The ceasefire generally held after it took effect on 3 January at 18:00 hours. The main exception was in the Dubrovnik area, where the JNA held positions around the city of Dubrovnik and in nearby Konavle until July 1992. That area was not included in the UN peacekeeping deployment schedule. On 4 January, the Yugoslav Navy retreated from the Lora naval base near <b>Split.</b> <b>On</b> 5 January, Major General Imra Agotić, commander of the ZNG, noted 84 ceasefire violations by the Serb side.
