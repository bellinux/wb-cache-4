The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the correlation between the adiponectin gene single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 45 T/G and long-term oxidative stress in type II diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM) patients with carotid athero-sclerosis. Patients with T 2 DM were divided into non-carotid atherosclerosis and carotid atherosclerosis groups, which were then subsequently divided into TT and TG + GG groups according to the adiponectin SNP 45 T/G genotypes. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, TaqMan probe quanti-tative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), PCR-TaqMan, color Doppler and other methods were used to determine the adipo-nectin levels, gene polymorphisms, acquired mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) A 3243 G <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> <b>mutation</b> rates and the carotid intima-media thickness. The <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> <b>mutation</b> rate of acquired mtDNA A 3243 A/G in the T 2 DM carotid atherosclerosis group was significantly higher compared with the group without carotid atherosclerosis. In addition, the acquired mtDNA A 3243 A/G <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> <b>mutation</b> rate in the T 2 DM carotid atherosclerosis group with the adiponectin gene SNP 45 TT genotype was significantly lower compared with the SNP 45 TG/GG genotype group. T 2 DM combined with carotid atherosclerosis was associated with long-term oxidative stress. In addition, adiponectin gene SNP 45 T/G was associated with increased mtDNA A 3243 A/G somatic mutation rates in T 2 DM patients with carotid atherosclerosis. Therefore, adiponectin gene polymorphisms may lead to diabetes atherosclerosis through oxidative stress...|$|E

40|$|Alcohol {{dehydrogenase}} (alcohol: NAD oxidoreductase, E. C. 1. 1. 1. 1.) mutants of Chinese hamster <b>somatic</b> <b>cells</b> {{were isolated}} as resistant to allyl alcohol (ALLR). The ALLR phenotypes of the mutant clones were reproducible with high fidelity and stable over long intervals {{of growth in}} the absence of the selecting drug. Several mutants, Adh- 1, Adh- 2, Adh- 9 and Adh- 13, resistant to allyl alcohol were characterized. They have between 15 and 40 % of the alcohol dehydrogenase activity of the wild-type cell lines. Cell-cell hybridization experiments using Adh- 1 and wild-type Chinese hamster cells indicate that resistance to allyl alcohol is recessive to the wild-type allele. This phenotype is therefore a useful marker to analyze gene segregation of <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> <b>mutations</b> and to study the expression of the genes involved in the metabolism of ethanol in mammalian cells...|$|R

Amplifying a polymorphic portion of the X chromosome-linked phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) gene after selective digestion of the active X chromosome with a methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme gave results fully concordant with standard Southern blotting of DNA samples from normal (polyclonal) polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) as well as clonal PMN from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and polycythemia vera (PCV).

GPA variant frequencies were determined for 11 WRN patients and for 10 heterozygous family members who collectively carry 10 different WRN mutations. Genetic instability as measured by GPA Ø/N allele loss variant frequency was significantly increased, and this increase was strongly age-dependent in WRN patients. GPA Ø/N allele loss variants were also significantly elevated in heterozygous family members, thus providing the first evidence for in vivo genetic instability in heterozygous carriers in an autosomal recessive genetic instability syndrome. Our results and comparable data on other human genetic instability syndromes allow {{an estimate of the}} level of genetic instability that increases the risk of human bone marrow dysfunction or neoplasia...|$|E

The frequent activation of the RET proto-oncogene has been recently demonstrated in human thyroid carcinomas of the papillary histotype and in the TPC- 1 human papillary thyroid carcinoma cell line (Fusco et al., 1987 a; Grieco et al., 1990; Bongarzone et al., 1989; Ishizaka et al., 1990; Jhiang et al., 1992). The RET proto-oncogene encodes for receptortype tyrosine-kinase proteins (Takahashi & Cooper, 1987; Takahashi et al., 1988; Tahira et al., 1990).

40|$|Benzene is a {{recognized}} hematotoxin and leukemogen, but its mechanisms {{of action in}} humans are still uncertain. To provide insight into these processes, we carried out a cross-sectional study of 44 healthy workers currently exposed to benzene (median 8 -hr time-weighted average; 31 ppm), and unexposed controls in Shanghai, China. Here we {{provide an overview of}} the study results on peripheral blood cell levels and <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> <b>mutation</b> frequency measured by the glycophorin A (GPA) gene loss assay and report on peripheral cytokine levels.

In contrast, peripheral cytokine levels (interleukin- 3, interleukin- 6, erythropoietin, granulocyte colonystimulating factor, tissue necrosis factor-a) in a subset of the most highly exposed workers (n = 11) were similar to values in controls (n = 11), suggesting that benzene does not affect these growth factor levels in peripheral blood.

40|$|Cell cloning by {{limiting}} dilution in 96 -well microtiter plates has been employed to isolate colonies of human T-lympho-cytes {{resistant to the}} purine analogue, 6 -thioguanine (TG). These colonies show stability of the TG-resistant (TG 1) phenotype, lack hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl trans-ferase (HPRT) activity and thus {{appear to be the}} result of in vivo <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> <b>mutation</b> events. In order to employ this T-lymphocyte cloning assay for quantitative determination of the in vivo TGr mutant frequency in humans, we have defined the optimal conditions for T-cell colony formation with both nonselected and TG-selected cells. The parameters investigated include medium, serum, amount of the mitogen phytohaemagghitinin, amount of T-cell growth factor (TCGF) and the number of irradiated feeder or accessory ceils. Under the optimal conditions, the fraction of positive wells is pro-portional to the number of cells plated per well with both nonselection and TG selection conditions. T-cell cloning ef-ficiencies therefore are independent of inoculum size. There was some evidence for a decline in TGr mutant cell cloning at densities> 2 X 104 cells per round-bottom well, possibly due to metabolic cooperation between wild-type and mutant cells. The conditions defined in this study appear to provide a quantitative measurement of the in vivo TGr mutant fre-quency in human T-lymphocytes...|$|E

40|$|Because of a {{possible}} etiologic link between mutations and carcinogenesis, we compared fibroblasts derived from skin biopsies of several patients with hereditary cutaneous malignant melanoma and the dysplastic nevus syndrome for sensitivity to the mutagenic and/or cytotoxic effect of broad-spectrum simulated sunlight and of a UV mimetic carcinogen, 4 -nitroquinoline 1 -oxide (4 NQO). The genetic marker was resistance to 6 -thioguanine; loss of colony-forming ability was the assay for cytotoxicity. All five strains tested were more sensitive than normal to the killing effect of 4 NQO (slopes of survival curves were 2 - to 3 -fold steeper), but only one strain was hypersensitive to killing by Sun Lamp radiation. Two strains were tested for mutagenicity. The response of each to the mutagenic action of these agents corresponded to its response to cell killing. Both strains were hypermutable after exposure to 4 NQO, but only one showed a higher than normal frequency of mutants induced by simulated sunlight. The finding that nonmalignant fibroblasts from patients with a hereditary variant of malignant melanoma are abnormally susceptible to carcinogen-induced mutations suggests that hypersensitivity to mutagens contributes to risk of melanoma in patients. It also supports the <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> <b>mutation</b> hypothesis for the origin of cancer...|$|E

A <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> <b>mutation</b> assay which determines variant erythrocytes lacking expression of an allelic form of the sialoglycoprotein, glycophorin A, was applied to samples from children before and after receiving potentially genotoxic therapy. Fifty-six children who had received treatment for their malignancy, 15 with malignancy but prior to treatment and 43 control children were assessed {{for the presence of}} Nø and NN mutant variant red cells. Control children had mean (s. d.) Nø and NN variant frequencies (Vf) of 9. 5 (7. 0) and 5. 8 (3. 3) x 10 (6) erythrocytes respectively. Comparison between pre-treatment and control groups demonstrated that prior to chemotherapy, patients with paediatric malignancy do not have mutant frequencies significantly different from the normal population. Children who had received chemotherapy, with or without radiotherapy, showed a significant elevation of both Nø and NN variants over 10 years from the end of treatment. Exposure of children to radiotherapy or known chemical mutagens leads to an increased frequency of variant erythrocytes which is probably the result of in vivo somatic cell mutations.

40|$|<b>Somatic</b> <b>cell</b> <b>mutation</b> {{frequency}} in vivo {{was measured in}} individuals with high cancer risk who were from ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) families. The assay for somatic mutation measures the frequency of variant erythrocytes which are progeny of erythroid precursor cells with mutations that result {{in a loss of}} gene expression at the polymorphic glycophorin A (GPA) locus. Samples from 14 of 15 A-T homozygotes showed high frequencies of GPA gene expression-loss variant cells with normal expression of only one of the two alleles at the GPA locus (i. e., GPA hemizygous variant cells). The mean elevation of the frequency of hemizygous variant cells over those in normal controls and unaffected family members was 7 - 14 -fold. A-T homozygotes also showed an increase in the frequency of cells in which one allele at the GPA locus had lost expression and in which the remaining allele was expressed at a homozygous level (i. e., GPA homozygous variant cells). Family members who are obligate A-T heterozygotes did not appear to have a significantly elevated frequency of GPA hemizygous or homozygous variant cells. These indications of elevated in vivo frequencies of variant erythrocytes in A-T homozygotes support a causal link between susceptibility to somatic mutation and susceptibility to cancer...|$|E

Even though nucleoside-free culture conditions were used methotrexate was not lethal to lymphocytes plated into micro-wells at greater than 10 (2) cells/well. HPLC analysis of supernatants from wells plated initially with 10 (4) cells/well in 100 microM methotrexate revealed the presence of micro-molar levels of hypoxanthine and thymidine by the 5 th and 8 th day of culture respectively. When lymphocytes were plated at {{less than or equal}} to 10 (2) cells/well in nucleoside free medium, methotrexate was cytotoxic and micro-molar levels of thymidine together with hypoxanthine protected lymphocytes cultured under these conditions from toxicity. Modulation of nucleic acid antimetabolite cytotoxicity by nucleosides and bases has been recognised for some years. Nucleoside free culture conditions have been advocated for studying cellular sensitivity to antifolates to avoid such interfering factors.

These 37 individuals with gpa outlier Vf are significantly older (p 3 ̆c 0. 001) than {{the remainder of the}} larger study population from which they were drawn reflecting a highly significant increase in the prevalence of these individuals in the population beyond age 40 years. A study of hprt mutant frequencies (Mf) in the peripheral blood T-lymphocytes of 27 of these individuals, together with 15 matched control individuals with unremarkable gpa Vf, was undertaken to determine if these subjects also displayed elevated mutation frequencies at this independent locus indicative of globally elevated somatic mutation. The hprt Mf in these 27 subjects (geometric mean 11. 5 × 10 − 6 (dispersion interval 5. 8 × 10 − 6 to 22. 8 × 10 − 6)) was not significantly different from that observed in the 15 controls (geometric mean 12. 1 × 10 − 6 (dispersion interval 5. 7 × 10 − 6 to 25. 5 × 10 − 6)). These Mf are higher than typically reported values reflecting the older age distribution of these individuals (arithmetic mean age±SD 53 ± 12 and 50 ± 16 years for the subjects and controls, respectively). Taken together, these data suggest that several genetic mechanisms may be responsible for producing the gpa outlier Vf observed in these subjects. The observation that hprt Mf were not increased indicates that the majority did not arise by a genome-wide increased rate of somatic mutation detectable at both loci. The fixation and subsequent expansion of `jackpot 2 ̆ 7 mutations at the gpa locus occurring early in embryonic/fetal development also {{does not appear to be}} a predominant mechanism. Some cases may result from a stable over-representation of gpa variant cells, perhaps associated with a marked age-dependent decrease in the number of contributing erythroid stem cells in the bone marrow. The subset that displays elevated allele-loss with duplication Vf involving both gpa alleles may represent individuals with increased rates of somatic recombination. Elevations arising by this mechanism are not detected in the hprt assay, but could be confirmed using an autosomal locus in vivo <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> <b>mutation</b> endpoint such as the hla-a assay. Of primary biological significance, these results demonstrate that genetic/stochastic processes leading to the loss of heterozygosity of somatic cells occur ubiquitously in humans and in some individuals this level of somatic mosaicism can approach a frequency of 10 − 3 at the gpa locus in erythroid lineage cells...|$|E

In the present work, we have performed monochromatic UV irradiation for evaluating the action spectrum of sunlight in genotoxicity. Third instar larvae in petri dishes were irradiated by monochromatic UV light at a wavelength between 310 and 360 nm.

40|$|Our present {{understanding}} of two-stage carcinogenesis encompasses almost {{four decades of}} research. Evidence for chemical promotion or cocarcinogenesis was first provided by Berenblum, who reported that a regimen of croton oil (weak or noncarcinogenic) applied alternately with small doses of benzo(a) pyrene (BP) to mouse skin induced {{a larger number of}} tumors than BP alone. Subsequently, Moltram found that a single subcarcinogenic dose of BP followed by multiple applications of croton oil could induce a large number of skin tumors.

The initiation stage in mouse skin requires only a single application of either a direct-acting carcinogen or a procarcinogen and is essentially an irreversible step which as data suggests probably involves a <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> <b>mutation.</b> The promotion stage in mouse skin can be accomplished by a wide variety of weak or noncarcinogenic agents and is initially reversible later becoming irreversible.

In monoclonal tumors, one of the polymorphic alleles was selectively digested after additional digestion with Hpa II, a methylation sensitive enzyme, whereas in polyclonal tissue both were decreased to a similar extent. Normal thyroid tissue from all patients showed a polyclonal pattern. Of the 18 tumors studied, 12 were solitary thyroid nodules, and 6 were obtained from multinodular goiters (MNG). The following were monoclonal: 6 / 6 follicular adenomas, 2 / 2 follicular carcinomas, and 1 / 1 anaplastic carcinoma. Two of the three papillary carcinomas showed intermediate patterns, possibly due to contaminating effects of stromal tissue present {{in most of these}} neoplasms. Of the six nodules from MNG, four were polyclonal. The two largest gave a distinct monoclonal pattern. Most solitary thyroid tumors are monoclonal, supporting a <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> <b>mutation</b> model of thyroid neoplasm formation. Nodules from MNG are largely hyperplastic, although monoclonal neoplasms do occasionally arise within these glands. The specific somatic mutations leading to clonal expansion and determination of tumor phenotype are presently unknown...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the risks of}} exposure to ethylene oxide (EO) at current permissible levels and at past higher levels, an inception cohort of sterilizer operators and supervisors from the Central Processing Department (CPD), respiratory therapists, and engineers exposed to EO were identified at the McMaster University Medical Centre. A comparison group from Nutrition Services (NUTR) were matched with the CPD workers {{on the basis of}} sex, age, and smoking habit. The present report is based on genetic test results for the 94 CPD and matched NUTR workers only. Statistical analysis based on the mean SCE frequency in the top 5, top 10, and all cells (50 cells scored per individual) and high frequency cells (HFC) based on the 95 th percentile for nonsmoking control subjects showed a direct association with current smoking but not with EO exposure. Similarly, statistical analysis of the <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> <b>mutation</b> (SCMT) variant frequencies did not demonstrate an association with EO exposure, nor with smoking. Regression analysis indicated that sex was the only other covariate that significantly affected SCE. Age was weakly associated with SCMT. A statistically significant interaction between occupational exposure and smoking habits was observed only for the mean SCE frequency of the top 5 and top 10 cells when the 11 current CPD/NUTR pairs were not included. Thus, this interaction should be interpreted with caution...|$|E
40|$|Summary The {{assessment}} of chromosomal mutations in children may {{provide information about}} aetiology and risk of second malignancies. A <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> <b>mutation</b> assay which determines variant erythrocytes lacking expression of an allelic form of the sialoglycoprotein, glycophorin A, was applied to samples from children before and after receiving potentially genotoxic therapy. Fifty-six children who had received treatment for their malignancy, 15 with malignancy but prior to treatment and 43 control children were assessed {{for the presence of}} N 0 and NN mutant variant red cells. Control children had mean (s. d.) N 0 and NN variant frequencies (Vf) of 9. 5 (7. 0) and 5. 8 (3. 3) x 106 erythrocytes respectively. Comparison between pre-treatment and control groups demonstrated that prior to chemotherapy, patients with paediatric malignancy do not have mutant frequencies significantly different from the normal population. Children who had received chemotherapy, with or without radiotherapy, showed a significant elevation of both N 0 and NN variants over 10 years from the end of treatment. Exposure of children to radiotherapy or known chemical mutagens leads to an increased frequency of variant erythrocytes which is probably the result of in vivo somatic cell mutations. The long term implications have yet to be determined. The improved survival of children with malignancies over the last 30 years is clearly the result of more intensive treatmen...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Reviewing {{the past}} and the present status of {{personalized}} medicine, the hope and promise from several years ago was critically compared to what is really achieved to tailor the drug treatment according to the patient’s individuality. The basis for consideration is what we know about the variant of the disease the patient is suffering from, and about the mechanisms influencing the plasma concentration-time profile, such as activity of metabolizing enzymes and transporters. In cancer treatment, drugs are currently selected regarding molecular properties of the cancer tissue, eg, expressing receptors such as HER 2 receptor. Currently diagnostic tests are available allowing to detect <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> <b>mutations</b> that can be used to guide drug selection. Unfortunately, tumor heterogeneity and developing resistance by further mutations may limit the success of the therapy determined by molecular diagnostics. The present status can be described that in drug kinetics we know the influencing factors and we understand the mechanisms. However, only in a few cases the genetic background is the main determinant of kinetic variability, and environmental and other factors have an additional important role. Therefore, much more has to be done before we can translate the accumulating knowledge into a benefit for the patient. Only then, we can speak about personalized medicine...|$|R
40|$|Idiopathic {{ventricular}} tachycardia is a generic term {{that describes the}} various forms of ventricular arrhythmias that occur in patients without structural heart disease {{and in the absence of}} the long QT syndrome. Many of these tachycardias are focal in origin, localize to the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT), terminate in response to beta blockers, verapamil, vagal maneuvers, and adenosine, and are thought to result from cAMP-mediated triggered activity. DNA was prepared from biopsy samples obtained from myocardial tissue from a patient with adenosine-insensitive idiopathic {{ventricular tachycardia}} arising from the RVOT. Genomic sequences of the inhibitory G protein Galphai 2 were determined after amplification by PCR and subcloning. A point mutation (F 200 L) in the GTP binding domain of the inhibitory G protein Galphai 2 was identified in a biopsy sample from the arrhythmogenic focus. This mutation was shown to increase intracellular cAMP concentration and inhibit suppression of cAMP by adenosine. No mutations were detected in Galphai 2 sequences from myocardial tissue sampled from regions remote from the origin of tachycardia, or from peripheral lymphocytes. These findings suggest that <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> <b>mutations</b> in the cAMP-dependent signal transduction pathway occurring during myocardial development may be responsible for some forms of idiopathic ventricular tachycardia...|$|R
