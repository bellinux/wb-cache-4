However, since fiscal <b>stabilization</b> <b>policies</b> appear to be unavoidable for political reasons, the paper secondly discusses on which institutional level such policies should be located.

25|$|Unions {{felt that}} during World War II the National War Labor Board had unfairly held wages {{below the level}} of {{inflation}} while doing little to rein in corporate profits. The American Federation of Labor (AFL) and Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) as well as independent labor unions were determined to avoid a similar outcome under the new Wage Stabilization Board. On December 20, 1950, a United Labor Policy Committee (ULPC) composed of representatives of the AFL, CIO, the Railway Labor Executives' Association (a group of railway labor unions) and the International Association of Machinists formed to influence the WSB's deliberations on wage <b>stabilization</b> <b>policy.</b> The group demanded a yearly cost-of-living adjustment for all contracts, productivity pay increases linked to company profit margins, and price controls. But the WSB's public and corporate representatives were in agreement that the board should only focus on wages, and strictly control wages to keep inflation in check.|$|E

They explain their belief that the Washington Consensus has advocated narrow goals for development (with a focus on price stability) and prescribed too few policy instruments (emphasizing monetary and fiscal policies), and places unwarranted faith {{in the role of}} markets. The new framework focuses on real stability and long-term sustainable and equitable growth, offers a variety of non-standard ways to stabilize the economy and promote growth, and accepts that market imperfections necessitate government interventions. Policy-makers have pursued stabilization goals with little concern for growth consequences, while trying to increase growth through structural reforms focused on improving economic efficiency. Moreover, structural policies, such as capital market liberalization, have had major consequences for economic stability. This book challenges these policies by arguing that <b>stabilization</b> <b>policy</b> has important consequences for long-term growth and has often been implemented with adverse consequences. The first part of the book introduces the key questions and looks at the objectives of economic policy from different perspectives. The third part presents a similar analysis for capital market liberalization.|$|E

2500|$|Krugman {{had argued}} in The Return of Depression Economics that Japan {{was in a}} {{liquidity}} trap in the late 1990s, since the central bank could not drop interest rates any lower to escape economic stagnation. The core of Krugman's policy proposal for addressing Japan's liquidity trap was inflation targeting, which, he argued [...] "most nearly approaches the usual goal of modern <b>stabilization</b> <b>policy,</b> which is to provide adequate demand in a clean, unobtrusive way that does not distort the allocation of resources." [...] The proposal appeared first in a web posting on his academic site.

2500|$|The US {{economic}} history {{is rife with}} unwelcomed financial crises. Frederic S.

Monetary policymakers have turned their attention to financial stability in order to mitigate the damage incurred during shocks. This is due to another outcome from failing to satisfy the principle is the existence of [...] "a multiplicity of bounded equilibria in which output and inflation respond to nonfundamental—sunspot—disturbances". Crises are typically unpredictable and uncontrollable due to the vast number of factors involved, which prompts the necessity for improved crisis <b>stabilization</b> <b>policy.</b> The Federal Reserve essay points out a couple cases, such as the Stock Market Crash of 1987 and the September 11 terrorist attack, in which the Federal Reserve had prevented even worse crises from arising by providing the liquidity essential to keeping the markets from crashing. The Federal Reserve’s quick response to stabilizing crises was made possible due to the improvement of monetary policy.|$|E
2500|$|In general, {{liberalism}} opposes socialism when socialism {{is understood}} to mean an alternative to capitalism based on state ownership {{of the means of}} production. American liberals doubt that bases for political opposition and freedom can survive when all power is vested in the state, as it was under state-socialist regimes. In line with the general pragmatic, empirical basis of liberalism, American liberal philosophy embraces the idea that if substantial abundance and equality of opportunity can be achieved through a system of mixed ownership, then {{there is no need for}} a rigid and oppressive bureaucracy. Some liberal public intellectuals have, since the 1950s, moved further toward the general position that free markets, when appropriately regulated, can provide better solutions than top-down economic planning. Economist Paul Krugman argued that in hitherto-state-dominated functions such as nation-scale energy distribution and telecommunications, marketizations can improve efficiency dramatically. He also defended a monetary policy—inflation targeting—saying that it [...] "most nearly approaches the usual goal of modern <b>stabilization</b> <b>policy,</b> which is to provide adequate demand in a clean, unobtrusive way that does not distort the allocation of resources". (These distortions are of a kind that war-time and post-war Keynesian economists had accepted as an inevitable byproduct of fiscal policies that selectively reduced certain consumer taxes and directed spending toward government-managed stimulus projects—even where these economists theorized at a contentious distance from some of Keynes's own, more hands-off, positions, which tended to emphasize stimulating of business investment.) Thomas Friedman is a liberal journalist who, like Paul Krugman, generally defends free trade as more likely to improve the lot of both rich and poor countries.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to add to current debates on the {{efficiency}} of economic <b>stabilization</b> <b>policies</b> through an analysis of the conception of business cycles developed by Minsky in his earliest work at the end of the 1950 s. The argument is developed in three steps. First, how Minsky's conception of business cycles is influenced by the nonlinear models with floors and ceilings developed by Hicks in the 1950 s is discussed. These models provide a relevant theoretical framework for Minskyan analysis of <b>stabilization</b> <b>policies</b> which act as 'thwarting systems' and whose purpose is to counteract and contain the naturally explosive amplitude of economic fluctuations. They allow a better understanding of his theory of financial instability. Contrary to the generally widespread interpretation, the Minskyan Financial Instability Hypothesis cannot be reduced to an endogenous and financial conception of economic fluctuations founded only on the behavior of private economic agents: public authorities, through their <b>stabilization</b> <b>policies,</b> also play a central role in explaining the form of business cycles (Section 2). Second, the central role played by banks in Minsky's analysis of fluctuations is highlighted. We emphasize that the behavior of banks is guided essentially by a permanent quest for profit opportunities in the tradition of such authors as Tobin and Schumpeter. This feature is crucial for understanding Minsky's conception of business cycles since it provides an explanation for how banks' behaviors undermine the efficiency of <b>stabilization</b> <b>policies,</b> and therefore the form of economic fluctuations (Section 3). The third step (Section 4) is an assessment of the relevance of Minsky's approach for understanding recent pre- and post-crisis <b>stabilization</b> <b>policies...</b>|$|R
