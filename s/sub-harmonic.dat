40|$|Harmonic {{analysis}} in power systems {{is a challenge}} that is always evolving due to a constantly changing power grid. Advances in power electronics {{have led to the}} installation of many new non-linear power loads, such as power converters, arc furnaces and motor drive systems, which in turn change the existing infrastructure and inject new types of harmonics. This study analyzes a static Kramer drive system for its harmonic behavior. The system is broken down component-by-component and analyzed. The {{analysis in}}cludes classical harmonics of integer multiple of the fundamental frequency as well as <b>sub-harmonics</b> and interharmonics. This paper shows that there are significant harmonic issues in a static Kramer drive that are likely to be present in similar drive systems. Due to the unknown frequencies at which interharmonics and <b>sub-harmonics</b> arise it is difficult to estimate the magnitude and phase of these harmonics. It is proposed that state estimation techniques such as digital filtering coupled with windowing techniques can be used to properly pinpoint the frequency components, magnitudes and phases of harmonics, interharmonics and <b>sub-harmonics</b> in the motor drive systems. Once identified, the harmonics, interharmonics and <b>sub-harmonics</b> can be eliminated by means of passive filtering or self-tuning active filtering. The optimal methods of estimation of harmonics, interharmonics and <b>sub-harmonics</b> will be both developed analytically and through the means of simulation with the use of CAD tools such as PSCAD and MATLAB. The development of the optimal techniques for estimation of harmonics, interharmonics and <b>sub-harmonics</b> for that static Kramer drive will aid in estimation of harmonics, interharmonics and <b>sub-harmonics</b> in similar motor drive systems...|$|R

The SM-BDFIG is coupled to a variable speed wind turbine, and its rotor circuit is connected to a 3 -phase rectifier feeding Li-ion batteries. A mathematical model, using Fourier expansion, is developed to define the <b>sub-harmonics</b> created by the time harmonics of the rotor currents irrespective of any other space or time harmonics due to winding distribution, unbalanced grid phases, or presence of harmonics in the grid voltages. The effect of {{the positive and negative}} sequence harmonics on the performance of the generator is then presented, showing the speed ranges within which these <b>sub-harmonics</b> are most effective, as well as the speed ranges within which these <b>sub-harmonics</b> are least effective. The obtained results help to design a SM-BDFIG with less harmonic distortion, hence improving its performance in wind energy conversion systems...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Variable speed drives (VSD) are {{adhered to}} {{induction}} motors {{in most of}} the present industrial applications. And since the world has become more conscientious to energy saving, inverters established them selves in domestic buildings and industry. Square wave inverters generate dominant harmonics of the 5 th, 7 th, 11 th and 13 th order. Inverters based on PWM strategy produce much higher harmonic order depending on the frequency modulation ratio. The presence of any sub-synchronous harmonics (<b>sub-harmonics)</b> is usually unheeded probably to their ineffective magnitude. The work in this paper is to investigate the effects of low frequencies on the performance of induction motors running near rated peed. Low frequencies are superimposed on the motor by a second inverter cascaded with the main inverter. The results shown in this paper manifest the significant effects of <b>sub-harmonics</b> on the speed stability of induction motors. The results obtained also show that <b>sub-harmonics</b> can adversely affect the motor performance even if they are present with small amplitudes. This work is expected to lead to the notion of using low frequency injection in speed control of induction motors...|$|R
40|$|With a {{wide range}} of power electronics-related {{applications}} in power systems, harmonic currents are increasing at an alarming rate which has greatly deteriorated the power quality in electrical power networks. Moreover, some of electronic controlled equipments used in power systems, such as cycloconverters, produce <b>sub-harmonics,</b> a type of waveform distortion, which can severely degrade the power system performance. Therefore, they must be closely monitored. Moreover, Fast Fourier Transform cannot accurately analyze waveforms containing <b>sub-harmonics</b> because the synchronization of the sampling procedure to subharmonics is practically infeasible. The detection of subharmonics requires a different approach from that used for harmonics analysis. In most analysis methods the voltage waveform {{is expected to be a}} pure sinusoid with a given frequency and amplitude. Standard tools of harmonic analysis based on the Fourier transform assume that only harmonics are present in the investigated signal and the periodicity intervals are fixed, while periodicity intervals in the presence of interharmonics and <b>sub-harmonics</b> can be variable and very long. Two novel approaches to analyze non-stationary signals are shown in this paper. The first is the “Root-Music” harmonic retrieval method that is an example of high-resolution eigenstructure-based method, the second is a numerical method based on moving average...|$|R

This signal is used as input of ANN, which estimate the influence of that signal in quadrature components. Using this information, corrections can be made in quadrature components then the real value of phasor of the fundamental component is estimated. The performance of the proposed algorithm was compared with classical methods such as DFT, using one and two cycles, and LES. The results showed that the proposed method is accurate and fast.

40|$|Removing some {{sections}} of the stator yoke in a permanent magnet brushless machine can be beneficial for reducing punching waste and simplifying motor manufacture. However in some cases, restricting the possible flux paths in this way will have a detrimental impact on the torque and air-gap harmonics. This paper discusses the potential implications of modular stator core arrangements and presents the air-gap flux density harmonics and winding factors for potential slot/pole combinations. FEA simulations are presented to support the analytical calculations. The analysis suggests that the performance reduction from using a modular stator is minimal {{when the number of}} slots and poles are similar but drops off substantially when this is not the case. A modular core stator will increase the MMF <b>sub-harmonics</b> due to the magnet field but can reduce the <b>sub-harmonics</b> due to the armature if a single layer winding is used.

40|$|The {{extensive}} {{usage of}} composite materials in modern industrial applications implies a great {{range of possible}} structural failure modes for which the structure has to be frequently and thoroughly inspected. Nonlinear guided wave inspection techniques have been continuously gaining attention during the last decade. This is primarily due to their sensitivity to very small sizes of localised damage. A number of complex transformation phenomena take place when an elastic wave impinges on a nonlinear segment, including the generation of higher and <b>sub-harmonics.</b> Moreover, the transmission and reflection coefficients of each wave type become amplitude dependent.
