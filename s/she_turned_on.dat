25|$|After being dumped by Sandman and Scorpio in ECW, {{she once}} again resurfaced in WCW, first {{appearing}} on the January 22, 1996 episode of WCW Monday Nitro as one of many women who stood in the aisle and waved as Hulk Hogan and Randy Savage came to the ring. On the February 5 episode of Nitro <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> Savage during his match with Chris Benoit and rejoined Flair, Arn Anderson, Brian Pillman, and Benoit in the then-current incarnation of the Four Horsemen. Miss Elizabeth also managed the stable.|$|E
25|$|After WrestleMania, The Dudley Boyz began a {{feud with}} The Holly Cousins. During this time, Dudley began a {{relationship}} with Molly Holly, {{which led to the}} Dudleys turning on him and putting Holly through a table. On June 14, 2001, Dudley was given his first opportunity at a World Heavyweight Championship, in a losing effort against Stone Cold Steve Austin. During The Invasion, Dudley remained loyal to WWF, despite being an ECW Original. It was during The Invasion that his relationship with Molly came to an end when <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> him, aligning herself with The Alliance.|$|E
2500|$|When Rick and Scott Steiner {{started to}} team in 1989 a female fan (Robin Green) started {{following}} them around, professing {{her love for}} the cute and dorky Rick. Steiner's brother Scott and their manager Missy Hyatt began to have suspicions after the woman suddenly changed to a new vampy look. When the woman tripped Scott in the ring, causing him and Rick to lose to champions The Fabulous Freebirds, it briefly caused dissension among the brothers. In the end, <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> the Steiners, adopting the name Woman and vowed that the brothers would meet their [...] "doom" [...] at Halloween Havoc 1989 but never made it clear who or what “Doom” was.|$|E

2500|$|In January 1996, Miss Elizabeth {{returned}} to wrestling as manager for Savage. A month later <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> Savage by helping Ric Flair defeat him at SuperBrawl VI {{and then became}} Flair's co-manager in the Four Horsemen along with Woman. She later turned against the Four Horsemen and joined the New World Order (nWo) alongside Hogan, but seemed to still care deeply for her ex-husband, and eventually joined his side when he too joined the nWo months later. In June 1998, she parted ways with Savage once again by joining Hogan's side of the nWo: nWo Hollywood. Then, she accompanied Eric Bischoff {{on his way to}} the ring for the next few months, and derided Savage. Savage coldly reminded her that he [...] "got over her a long time ago" [...] and didn't need her.|$|E
2500|$|On June 15, 1944, Santa Fe {{participated in}} {{landings}} on Saipan, Guam, and Tinian (Operation Forager) {{as a part}} of the U.S. Fifth Fleet under the overall command of Vice Admiral Raymond A. Spruance. [...] On June 19, Japanese carrier aircraft began attacking the Fifth Fleet which remained close to the beachhead on orders from Spruance. [...] Wright concurred that this controversial decision was the correct one given the importance of protecting the landing force. During the ensuing Battle of the Philippine Sea, Santa Fe's anti-aircraft guns helped to protect the fleet during these enemy air attacks while American naval aviators counter-attacked the Japanese fleet. [...] Later, on June 20, Santa Fe ignored possible Japanese submarine activity when <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> her lights to help guide returning American aircraft back to their carriers during highly hazardous night landings. [...] After air strikes on Pagan Island, Santa Fe returned to Eniwetok for reprovisioning.|$|E
2500|$|On the November 26, 2005 {{episode of}} Impact!, Gayda made her debut lashing out at Jeff Jarrett. Jarrett {{was shocked and}} frightened by Gayda's {{unexpected}} appearance and soon ordered her backstage. He was heard saying, [...] "It's not what you think." [...] After being pushed by Jarrett, Gayda slapped him and then went after his valet, Gail Kim. The following week, Gayda came out again to confront Jarrett. After pushing and slapping, the two had to be pulled apart by officials. At Turning Point, {{the same thing happened}} in the main event match, but Gayda was restrained by officials. On the December 31 show, Don West tracked down Gayda for an interview. She said her being there {{had nothing to do with}} a love affair, but rather that Jarrett had promised her a spot on the TNA Roster, but while she was stuck at home, <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> the television to see Kim in her place. She said she had a big secret about Jarrett that TNA Management would love to hear, but did not reveal what it was.|$|E

2500|$|In January 1996, Savage brought Elizabeth {{with him}} into WCW as his manager once again, but <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> Savage {{in his last}} title loss to Flair. Thereafter, Flair claimed that Elizabeth {{had given him a}} sizable amount of Savage's money, taken in their divorce settlement, which Flair used to set up a [...] "VIP section" [...] at Monday Nitro events. Flair and Savage {{continued}} to feud until June 1996, when the overall landscape of WCW changed. At Bash at the Beach, the New World Order (nWo) was formed when Hulk Hogan turned on Savage, Sting, and Lex Luger and joined [...] "The Outsiders", a tag team of former WWF wrestlers Kevin Nash and Scott Hall. After their inception, one of their main enemies became Savage himself, {{who was one of the}} leaders of the WCW crusaders against the nWo. Savage threatened Hogan for months, often being attacked by the nWo. At Halloween Havoc, Savage finally faced Hogan for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, but lost when The Giant interfered and hit him with a chokeslam. Savage left WCW following the event, when he was unable to reach a new deal with the company.|$|E
2500|$|Michaels and Jannetty were {{supposed}} to feud following the breakup, but Jannetty left the federation for personal reasons after being suspended by the WWF, due to an incident outside a Tampa night club that occurred on January 25, 1992. [...] He was arrested with charges of resisting arrest with force, cocaine possession and possession of drug paraphernalia, forcing the feud to be abandoned at least temporarily. While Jannetty was away, Michaels began developing his “Heartbreak Kid” heel persona including getting Sherri Martel as his manager. Michaels also won the WWF Intercontinental Championship from The British Bulldog. On the October 31, 1992 (taped October 12, 1992 in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan) edition of WWF Superstars, Michaels was in the ring posing before a match, admiring himself in a mirror that Sherri brought to the ring. To everyone’s surprise, Jannetty came down {{through the crowd and}} entered the ring. Jannetty attacked Michaels, grabbed the mirror and tried to hit Michaels with it. But instead Michaels pulled Sherri in front of himself so that she got hit with the mirror instead. This led to Sherri being hospitalized from the glass shards (only in storyline terms) when Sherri returned from her “recovery” <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> Michaels and actually backed Jannetty in his unsuccessful attempt to take the Intercontinental title away from Michaels at the 1993 Royal Rumble. After the loss, Jannetty once again left the WWF.|$|E
2500|$|Performed by the Four Freshmen, [...] "Their Hearts Were Full of Spring" [...] (1961) was a {{particular}} favorite of the Beach Boys. Brian explained: [...] "My mom turned me on to them. <b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> the radio and goes, 'Hear that song? This is called 'Day By Day' by the Four Freshmen.' And I listened and I went 'Oh, I love it, Mommy! I love it!' ... We went in [...] and she said you can take records into these little booths and play them {{to see if you}} wanted to buy them. ... You know how you sit in a sauna bath and the sweat will come out? That's what that whole experience in that room started to be. I purged all kinds of bullshit and picked up the Freshmen. It was magic. Total magic." [...] By deconstructing their arrangements of pop standards, Brian educated himself on jazz harmony. Lambert notes, [...] "If Bob Flanigan helped teach Brian how to sing, then Gershwin, Kern, Porter, and the other members of this pantheon helped him learn how to craft a song." [...] Wilson continued: [...] "I learned them bar by bar. I'd go to my hi-fi set and I'd play a little bit. Then I'd stop and try to figure it out, back and forth, back and forth, until I figured the whole song out." ...|$|E
