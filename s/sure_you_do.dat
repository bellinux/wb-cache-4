60|$|Lau. [To AUR.] If {{my uncle}} know us, we are ruined; {{therefore}} be <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not speak.|$|E
60|$|But be <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> die nevertheless. Do your work, {{and finish}} it. If {{you know how}} to begin, you will know when to end.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no! You mustn't say that. If {{you wish}} to be kind to me--and I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> wish it--don't think bitterly of Philip." ...|$|E
60|$|CANDIDA. Yes, dear: I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> But never mind: I shan't misunderstand.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> Poor old man! If <b>you</b> had <b>done</b> what {{he asked}} you I wonder whether his affection would have lasted {{as it has}} done." ...|$|R
6000|$|Ant. Why, <b>sure,</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not put {{yourself}} {{and me to}} all this trouble for a dry come-off; by this hand-- [...] [Taking it.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Selfish!' cried Tom. 'You {{have acted}} nobly. To love her as I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> {{and yet in}} {{consideration}} for her state of dependence, not even to disclose--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> me no {{more than}} justice,’ said I; ‘and I shall think it quite {{unnecessary}} to dwell {{on any of these}} passing circumstances in my report to the Vicomte.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> {{nothing you}} oughtn't." [...] Mr. Longdon kept the {{photograph}} {{and continued to}} look at it. [...] "Her mother told me about her--promised me I should see her next time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To be <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> What {{should a}} young fellow like <b>you</b> <b>do</b> ashore {{for half a}} year together? If a man had not a wife, he soon wants to be afloat again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mr Nickleby,' said brother Charles, 'you did {{not violate}} the {{confidence}} I placed in you, or take an unworthy advantage of it. I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And is that Lord Fitzjocelyn's {{definition}} of a narrow mind?' said Isabel. 'It sounds like faith and love. Are <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not make it yourself, Miss Ponsonby?' ...|$|R
6000|$|O'Con. Then, upon my word, I'll {{have the}} Rising Sun put down, and the Angel shall give {{security}} for his good behaviour; {{but are you}} <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> nothing to quit scores with them? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Be <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> Massa Vincent. You ride about a great deal, dat fellow bery like {{take a shot}} at {{you from}} behind tree. Don't you go near dat plantation, or sure enuff trouble come." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> me no {{more than}} justice," [...] said I; [...] "and I shall think it quite {{unnecessary}} to dwell {{on any of these}} passing circumstances in my report to the Vicomte." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't be sad, Dodo; kiss baby. What are you {{brooding}} over so? I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> everything, and a {{great deal}} too much. You should be happy now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, bravo!" [...] cried I. [...] "I laid a trap for you there, Mr. Denman. Now I {{need not}} ask you; I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not tell this prying stranger." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It shall all be made {{right in}} the morning," [...] said his wife. [...] "But are <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not take {{anything}} that disagreed with you while you were away?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> {{not wish}} to drive me away from Brampton," [...] she continued, in the same low voice, [...] "when I have found a place to earn my living near-near Uncle Jethro." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not, Madame Goesler. Nor do I {{think that}} anybody does. It is too absurd for belief from {{beginning}} to end. Good-bye. Perhaps I shall see you when the debate is over." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are you quite <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> it willingly?" [...] queried his tormentor, adding, [...] "another little half-turn, please, Simon; and you, Mistress Meg, if {{he begins}} to faint, just prick him in the thigh with your knife." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> When <b>you</b> said 'Sion hill' I {{recollect}} I {{thought of}} the Methodists directly. I couldn't have {{thought of the}} Methodists, if you hadn't said 'Sion hill.' It stands to reason." ...|$|R
60|$|DEARTH. It's nothing; I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> would <b>do</b> {{the same}} for us.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> And {{now what}} have you got to say?" [...] Here there was another shrug of the shoulders. [...] "I suppose you think because you are a rich man that <b>you</b> may <b>do</b> {{whatever}} <b>you</b> please. But you'll have to learn the difference. You must be exposed, Sir." ...|$|R
6000|$|When {{they had}} gone some {{distance}} on the road home, the girl turned {{to her husband and}} said: 'Till you step inside the house, be <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not look back, whatever you may hear or see.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Of course I {{have been}} very cruelly circumstanced. Everybody must see that. I'm <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> mamma. The long and short of it is this;--if I give up my engagement, will he take us abroad for a year?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{told you}} what I should like to do for you. See that the {{conditions}} come about promptly in which I may, do it. Are you <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> everything to satisfy Mrs. Dallow?" [...] Mr. Carteret continued.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am quite}} <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>did,</b> {{but it is}} no good our following; the side roads are so cut up by ruts that we should break a spring before we had gone a hundred yards. No, we will stop and look at this fellow who is unhorsed, Mark." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can easily}} believe it. You thought me then devoid of every proper feeling, I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> The turn of your countenance I shall never forget, {{as you said}} that I could not have {{addressed}} you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you don't}} {{tell me what}} there is in it, I don't see what we are to <b>do.</b> I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not give {{yourself}} the trouble of coming up here from Hamworth merely with the object of telling us {{that you are going}} to hold your tongue." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I'm {{not quite}} so <b>sure.</b> <b>You</b> <b>do</b> go as {{straightforward}} as most on 'em; but I ain't quite sure but {{that there are a}} few twists and twirls. What do you suppose he wants to be at?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank'ee, old fellow, I'm <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> Come, Wilkinson, {{give us your}} hand. It's {{better to}} have it all out at once. I wish you'd had more luck, and there's an end of it. It's all luck, you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|Wild. Jealousy! Why <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> {{not think}} me a pagan, an infidel? But the company's broke up, you see. Am I to wait upon you home, {{or will you}} be so kind {{to take a hard}} lodging with me to-night? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{you just}} now told {{the gentleman who}} {{examined}} you on the other side, that <b>you</b> were quite <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not witness two deeds {{on the day he}} named,--the 14th of July. Now, seeing that you doubt your own memory, going back over so long a time, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> wish to correct that statement?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> were {{of use to}} me," [...] cried Emma. [...] "I {{was very}} often {{influenced}} rightly by you--oftener than I would own at the time. I am very <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> me good. And if poor little Anna Weston is to be spoiled, {{it will be the}} greatest humanity in <b>you</b> to <b>do</b> as much for her as <b>you</b> have <b>done</b> for me, except falling in love with her when she is thirteen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Really, mother, the way {{the best}} of women speak of each other is lamentable. You say I should be better married, and then you take for granted that every marriageable woman in the {{neighbourhood}} is trying to kidnap me. I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not take my father by force in that way." ...|$|R
