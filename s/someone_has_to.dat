500|$|The {{producers}} cast {{relatively unknown}} British actors for the series. Scottish actress Lindsay Duncan, who was cast as Servilia, {{believed that she}} and other UK actors [...] "can do old, can do classic, and you believe it." [...] She also said that because of long distances, [...] American actors or those of other nationalities were avoided: [...] "Transporting actors from [...] to Rome {{on a regular basis}} does not look good for the budget. We're quite cheap." [...] Stamp described Servilia as [...] "the great love of [...] Caesar's life, his mistress and by all counts the only woman he truly loved." [...] Irish actor Ciarán Hinds was cast as Caesar. Hinds first thought it was [...] "silly" [...] to be offered the part, but then [...] "you think it's quite an honour to be chosen to play it. And then you think, 'Oh shit I've got to do it', and then, well, 'I suppose <b>someone</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> do it!'"

Bale {{said he was}} confident in his choice to return in the role because of the positive response to his portrayal in Batman Begins. He continued training in the Keysi Fighting Method and performed many of his own stunts, but did not gain as much muscle {{as in the previous}} film because the new Batsuit allowed him to move with greater agility. Bale described Batman's dilemma as whether [...] " [...] something that has an end. Can he quit and have an ordinary life? The kind of manic intensity <b>someone</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> have to maintain the passion and the anger that they felt as a child, takes an effort after a while, to keep doing that. At some point, you have to exorcise your demons." [...] He added, [...] "Now you have not just a young man in pain attempting to find some kind of an answer, you have somebody who actually has power, who is burdened by that power, and is having to recognize the difference between attaining that power and holding on to it." [...] Bale felt Batman's personality had been strongly established in the first film, so it was unlikely his character would be overshadowed by the villains, stating: [...] "I have no problem with competing with someone else. And that's going to make a better movie." ...|$|E

The Hare and the joke itself were used to illustrate the hassles of a Soviet lishenets in a 1929 issue of a satirical magazine Chudak. Mikhail Melnichenko, in an article about Soviet political jokes cites a 1926 private collection, which renders the joke in a more gruesome form, where [...] the Hare is scared of the rumor that all camels are taken hostages by Cheka and shot (a reference to the Red Terror). A similar parable was told by a 13th-century Persian poet and Sufi Jalal ad-Din Rumi, it which a person was scared to be taken for a donkey and skinned.|$|E
