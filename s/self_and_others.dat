50|$|In TFP, {{hypothesized}} {{mechanisms of}} change derive from Kernberg's developmentally based theory of Borderline Personality Organization, conceptualized {{in terms of}} unintegrated and undifferentiated affects <b>and</b> representations of <b>self</b> <b>and</b> <b>other.</b> Partial representations of <b>self</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> are paired <b>and</b> linked by an affect in mental units called object relation dyads. These dyads are elements of psychological structure. In borderline pathology, the lack of integration of the internal object relations dyads corresponds to a 'split' psychological structure in which totally negative representations are split off/segregated from idealized positive representations of <b>self</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> (seeing people as all good or all bad). The putative global mechanism of change in patients treated with TFP is the integration of these polarized affect states <b>and</b> representations of <b>self</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> into a more coherent whole.|$|R

40|$|Although many {{examples}} exist for shared neural representations of <b>self</b> <b>and</b> <b>other,</b> {{it is unknown}} how such shared representations interact {{with the rest of}} the brain. Furthermore, do high-level inference-based shared mentalizing representations interact with lower level embodied/simulation-based shared representations? We used functional neuroimaging (fMRI) and a functional connectivity approach to assess these questions during high-level inference-based mentalizing. Shared mentalizing representations in ventromedial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate/precuneus, and temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) all exhibited identical functional connectivity patterns during mentalizing of both <b>self</b> <b>and</b> <b>other.</b> Connectivity patterns were distributed across low-level embodied neural systems such as the frontal operculum/ventral premotor cortex, the anterior insula, the primary sensorimotor cortex, and the presupplementary motor area. These results demonstrate that identical neural circuits are implementing processes involved in mentalizing of both <b>self</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>and</b> that the nature of such processes may be the integration of low-level embodied processes within higher level inference-based mentalizing...|$|R

25|$|Person-positivity bias is the {{tendency}} to evaluate an object more favorably the more the object resembles an individual human being.

With regards to the optimistic bias, when people compare themselves to an average person, whether someone of the same sex or age, the target continues to be viewed as less human and less personified, which will result in less favorable comparisons between the <b>self</b> <b>and</b> <b>others.</b>|$|E

500|$|Each {{season of}} Buffy the Vampire Slayer (often {{simplified}} as Buffy) presents an overall story arc which episodes tie into, {{as well as}} a specific manifestation of evil known as the Big Bad. As noted by Buffy scholar Roz Kaveney, episodes in the fourth season address authority, order, and the estrangement from the <b>self</b> <b>and</b> <b>others</b> as Buffy and her friends take on new roles after high school. An ongoing theme in the series is Buffy's complex relationship to her destiny as the current Slayer and how she uniquely expresses this role, and this plot element is further explored in season four in general, and in the episode [...] "Restless" [...] in particular.|$|E
500|$|Early {{experiences}} with caregivers gradually {{give rise to}} a system of thoughts, memories, beliefs, expectations, emotions, and behaviours about the <b>self</b> <b>and</b> <b>others.</b> This system, called the [...] "internal working model of social relationships", continues to develop with time and experience. Internal models regulate, interpret, and predict attachment-related behaviour in the self and the attachment figure. As they develop in line with environmental and developmental changes, they incorporate the capacity to reflect and communicate about past and future attachment relationships. They enable the child to handle new types of social interactions; knowing, for example, that an infant should be treated differently from an older child, or that interactions with teachers and parents share characteristics. This internal working model continues to develop through adulthood, helping cope with friendships, marriage, and parenthood, all of which involve different behaviours and feelings. The development of attachment is a transactional process. Specific attachment behaviours begin with predictable, apparently innate, behaviours in infancy. They change with age in ways that are determined partly by experiences and partly by situational factors. As attachment behaviours change with age, they do so in ways shaped by relationships. A child's behaviour when reunited with a caregiver is determined not only by how the caregiver has treated the child before, but on the history of effects the child has had on the caregiver.|$|E
500|$|Buffy studies scholar Roz Kaveney {{states that}} estrangement from the <b>self</b> <b>and</b> <b>others</b> {{is the primary}} theme of the fourth season. To {{illustrate}} the absolute search for identity, the series writers created Adam, who is more truly alone than is anyone else. He is a creature assembled from a man, vampires, demons, and cutting edge cybernetic technology. Adam {{was not the first}} re-animated corpse to be presented in the series. [...] "Some Assembly Required" [...] in the second season also had a Frankenstein monster-like creation and [...] "Beauty and the Beasts" [...] in the third includes references to Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde; both touch on the misuse or abuse of science. Adam is a clear reference to Frankenstein's monster, who in the novel Frankenstein (1818) tells his creator that he is the [...] "Adam of your labours". Mary Shelley wrote the novel to highlight the problems progress, science, and industry create for humanity. Throughout the action, the monster constantly asks what he is and why he was created. Likewise, Adam escapes from 314 and makes his way out into the world, and much like Frankenstein's monster, he finds a little boy and asks the boy who and what he (Adam) is, then murders and dissects him. Adam is a curious character, seeking the truth and pontificating on what he has learned, even if he gained the knowledge through heartless violence. Whedon wanted Adam to be inquisitive and introspective, directing George Hertzberg to [...] "find the stillness" [...] in the character. Roz Kaveney notes that Hertzberg's [...] "flawed but impressive performance" [...] includes Adam's interesting idiosyncrasy of pausing each time he speaks, as if he is creating meaning with his own words and must consider the implications of what he is saying. Author Nikki Stafford connects Adam's need to learn about the world around him to Frankenstein's monster: Adam must understand why other people are here and why he has emotions, a peculiarity of his creation as Dr. Walsh never encouraged others to question her. One Buffy studies writer draws comparisons between Dr. Walsh and Victor Frankenstein, both of whom build monsters out of body parts [...] "to compensate for human vulnerability". The moral of Shelley's novel is that what science can accomplish is not necessarily what it should.|$|E
40|$|Traditionally, metaphysical {{notions of}} <b>self</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> presuppose a dualism that {{underlies}} much of Western philosophy. This dualism is opposed by accounts of <b>self</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> in recent continental philosophy and classical Chinese philosophy, which I compare. I argue that the self is seen in continental and Chinese thought as embedded in (ethical) relations and language, and not as transcendent or prior in the metaphysical sense to them. I argue for this by focussing on three themes: <b>self</b> <b>and</b> language, <b>self</b> as relational <b>and</b> embedded in the world or contextual environment, <b>and</b> <b>self</b> <b>and</b> the particular <b>other.</b> These three themes show that the complexity and dynamic of the self-other relation is much more realistically conveyed by continental and classical Chinese thought than by the traditional metaphysical account...|$|R
40|$|Empathy is intersubjective in that {{it connects}} us mentally with others.
