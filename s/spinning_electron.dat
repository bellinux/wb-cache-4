40|$|In {{the present}} work, we develop {{a method to}} {{calculate}} the anomalous velocity of a <b>spinning</b> <b>electron.</b> From Dirac equation, the relationships among the expectation values of the Pryce's mass-center operator, the position operator, the spin operator and the canonical momentum operator are investigated. By requiring that the center of mass for the classical <b>spinning</b> <b>electron</b> {{is related to the}} expectation value of the Pryce's mass-center operator, one can obtain a classical expression for the position of the electron. With the classical equations of motion, the anomalous velocity of a <b>spinning</b> <b>electron</b> can be easily calculated. It is shown that two factors contribute to the anomalous velocity: one is dependent on the selection of the Pryce's mass-center operators and the other is a type-independent velocity expressed by the rotational velocity and the Lorentz force.

40|$|Abstract Various {{aspects of}} the C-metric {{representing}} two rotating charged black holes accelerated in opposite directions are summarized and its limits are considered.

When the acceleration vanishes the usual electromagnetic magic field of the Kerr–Newman black hole with gravitational constant set to zero arises. Properties of the accelerated discs and the fields produced are studied and illustrated graphically. The charges at the rim of the accelerated discs move along spiral trajec-tories with the speed of light. If the magic field has some deeper connection with the field of the Dirac electron, as is sometimes conjectured because of the same gyro-magnetic ratio, the “accelerating magic field ” represents the electromagnetic field of a uniformly accelerated <b>spinning</b> <b>electron.</b> It generalizes the classical Born’s solution for two uniformly accelerated monopole charges...|$|E
