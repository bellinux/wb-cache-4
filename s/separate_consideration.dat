Application of the inferior pedicle approach affords a greater degree of nipple-areola complex elevation, but makes difficult emplacing the breast implant, and the subsequent contouring of the breast. Application of the medial pedicle approach preserves breast sensation with a reliable venous and arterial vascular supply, and avoids the technical and procedural limitations of the superior pedicle and the inferior pedicle approaches.|$|E

They proceed by tracing the {{consequences}} of certain assumptions; leaving for <b>separate</b> <b>consideration</b> whether the assumptions are true or not, and if not exactly true, whether they are a sufficiently near approximation to the truth. The reason is obvious. Since {{it is only in}} questions of pure number that the assumptions are exactly true, and even there only so long as no conclusions except purely numerical ones are to be founded on them; it must, in all other cases of deductive investigation, form a part of the inquiry, to determine how much the assumptions want of being exactly true in the case in hand. This is generally a matter of observation, to be repeated in every fresh case; or if it has to be settled by argument instead of observation, may require in every different case different evidence, and present every degree of difficulty, from the lowest to the highest. But {{the other part of the}} process—namely, to determine what else may be concluded if we find, and in proportion as we find, the assumptions to be true—may be performed once for all, and the results held ready to be employed as the occasions turn up for use.

40|$|The {{application}} of high energy lasers for material processing requires a high beam quality. This is e. g. {{determined by the}} image quality of the optical elements used for beam guidance and shaping. Until now, {{in the design of}} the optical elements several influencing parameters that occur during laser processing have been largely neglected. Reasons for this are the limited knowledge on the operational performance of optical elements for high power lasers (up to 25 kW) and the difficult measurement of the occurring deformations and displacements. Responsible for the deterioration of the desired image properties of the optical elements are, on the one hand, manufacturing inaccuracies, and, on the other hand, statical, dynamical, and thermal forces. Statical forces result from the mounting of the optical components and the applied coolant pressure. Dynamical forces can occur due to vibrations of the mechanical components of the beam guidance and fluctuations of the coolant pressure. The abs orption of a small part of the incident laser radiation leads to a heat-up of the optical element, resulting in a time and space-dependent deformation of the optics. The statical, dynamical, and thermal deformations and displacements occur simultaneously. A systematic analysis of the operational behavior requires a <b>separated</b> <b>consideration</b> of these parameters. Only such a proceeding can lead to a valuation of the influencing parameters. Using holographic interferometry, such a <b>separated</b> <b>consideration</b> of the different influences becomes possible.

We find that the subthreshold swing of the voltage transfer characteristic is governed by two <b>separate</b> <b>considerations</b> - {{the ability of the}} charges to correlate together through dipolar interactions and amplify the active torque, versus the active pull-in forces that drive an abrupt phase transition and close the air gap between the tip of the cantilever and the drain. For small sized relays, dipolar and short-range Van Der Waals 'sticking' forces dominate, while for longer cantilevers the capacitive energy acquires a major role. The individual pull-in and pull-out phases demonstrate a remarkably low subthreshold swing driven by the capacitive forces, sharpened further by dipolar correlation. The sharp switching, however, comes at the expense of strong hysteresis as the metastable and stable states interchange along the forward and reverse phases of the voltage scan.

40|$|Abstract—The {{architecture}} optimization of a three {{degrees of}} freedom (3 -DOF) planar cable-driven parallel manipulator (CDPM) with multiple objectives has been implemented by means of GA approach in this paper. Firstly, the kinematics and statics issues of the CDPM are addressed, which allows the generation of the feasible workspace restricted by both the cable length limits and tension bounds. Then, the optimal designs {{with respect to the}} feasible workspace with <b>separated</b> <b>considerations</b> of dexterity and stiffness performances are carried out to obtain the architectural parameters of the manipulator. The simulation results illustrate that the separated optimizations result in reverse variation tendencies of the design parameters. In order to deal with such problem, the multi-objective optimal design for a mixed performance index is accomplished afterwards. The optimization results demonstrate the compromise effects of the proposed multi-objective function, and the results are valuable in designing a planar 3 -DOF CDPM.

60|$|More {{discredit}} than {{he deserved}} fell upon Mr. Gladstone for this obnoxious defect. In announcing {{the commission of}} inquiry four years before, Lord John as prime minister had expressly said that {{the improvement of the}} universities should be treated as a subject by itself, and that the admission of dissenters ought to be reserved for future and <b>separate</b> <b>consideration.</b> Writing to Mr. Gladstone (Jan. 1854) he said, 'I do not want to stir the question in this bill,' but he would support a proposal in a separate bill by which the halls might be the means of admitting dissenters. Mr. Gladstone himself professed to take no strong line either way; but in a parliamentary case of this kind to take no line is not materially different from a line in effect unfriendly. Arthur Stanley pressed him as hard as he could. 'Justice to the university,' said Mr. Gladstone in reply, 'demands that it should be allowed to consider the question for itself.... Indeed, while I believe that the admission of dissenters without the breaking up of the religious teaching and the government of the university would be a great good, I am also of opinion that to give effect to that measure by forcible intervention of parliament would be a great evil. Whether it is an evil that must some day or other be encountered, the time has not yet, I think, arrived for determining.' The letter concludes with a remark of curious bearing upon the temper of that age. 'The very words,' he says to Stanley, 'which you have let fall upon your paper--"Roman catholics"--used in this connection, were enough to burn it through and through, considering we have a parliament which, were the measure of 1829 not law at this moment, would I think probably refuse to make it law.'

Multi-dimensional consequentialists believe that an act's deontic status depends on more than one aspect. They may, for instance, believe that the sum total of wellbeing produced by an act {{and the degree to which}} the wellbeing is equally distributed in the population affect the act's deontic status independently of each other.

Wellbeing and equality are two <b>separate</b> <b>considerations</b> that cannot be merged into some novel entity that accurately reflects both intuitions.

40|$|In recent years, lots of {{research}} effort {{was spent on}} the integration of process planning and job-shop scheduling. Various integrated process planning and scheduling (IPPS) models and solution approaches have been proposed. The previous and existing research approaches are able to demonstrate the feasibility of implementing IPPS. However, most of them assumed that setup time is negligible or {{only part of the}} processing time. For machined parts, the setup for each operation includes workpiece loading and unloading, tool change, etc. For setup that depends only on the operation to be processed (sequence-independent), it is applicable to adopt the assumption of not considering setup in IPPS. For setup that depends on both the operation to be processed and the immediately preceding operation (sequence-dependent), it is an oversimplification to adopt such assumption. In such cases, the setup time varies with the sequence of the operations. The process plans and schedules constructed under such assumption are not realistic or not even feasible. In actual practice, therefore, the setup time should be separated from the process time in performing the IPPS functions. In this thesis, a new approach is proposed for IPPS problems with setup time consideration for machined parts. Inseparable and sequence-dependent setup requirements are added into the IPPS problems. The setup times are separated from the process times and they vary with the sequence of the operations. IPPS is regarded as NP-hard problem. With the <b>separated</b> <b>consideration</b> of setup times, it becomes even more complicated. An Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) approach is proposed to handle this complicated problem. The system is constructed under a multi-agent system (MAS). AND/OR graph is used to record the set of feasible production procedures and sequences. The ACO algorithm computes results by an autocatalytic process with the objective to minimize the makespan. Software agents called “artificial ants” traverse through the feasible routes in the graph and finally construct a schedule. A setup time parameter is added into the algorithm to influence the ants to select the process with less setup time. The approach is able to construct a feasible solution with less setup time. Experimental studies have been performed to evaluate the performance of MAS-ACO approach in solving IPPS problems with <b>separated</b> <b>consideration</b> of setup times. The experimental results show that the MAS-ACO approach can effectively handle the problem. published_or_final_versionIndustrial and Manufacturing Systems EngineeringMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R
