40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} rules in place in {{selected}} countries to limit risk concentrations in the credit portfolio. The paper focuses {{on a number of}} issues suggested by international organizations for countries and bank supervisors to consider in imposing standards for risk diversification in the credit portfolio. The issues reviewed for each country are the large exposure limits, the definition of credit exposure (including application on a consolidated basis), and the definition of a group of related borrowers. The paper concludes that most of the countries reviewed set limits on large exposures for banks and define a related group of borrowers in line with recommended international standards. The major differences identified among countries include how to determine the credit exposure, the application of the exposure limits on a consolidated basis, and whether to impose limits on exposure to a specific sector.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to find out how XBRL will affect big audit companies. Purpose is to find out first of all, why audit companies are involved in developing XBRL and secondly, what are the main outcomes of XBRL for these companies. Also, the value-added of XBRL for other information process participants from audit companies' perspective is discussed. The specific point of view of audit companies in relation to XBRL is little researched in the past and thus, there is no ready-made theory to be tested. Instead, theoretical part presents previous research that suggests and helps to understand potential implications of XBRL for audit companies. In addition, theory about effective capital markets and information efficiency is utilized. The study is exploratory in nature as audit companies' point of view in relation to XBRL has not received much attention in the literature so far. Qualitative data was gathered through semi-structured interviews with professionals from audit companies that represent different countries and knowledge areas. Interviewees' answers to the first research question, what are the underlying reasons for audit companies to be involved in developing XBRL, revealed that audit companies are involved in developing XBRL because of the reputational gains. They also need to understand XBRL well in order to be able to provide assurance on XBRL documents and consulting services for their clients. As XBRL is predicted to change financial reporting practices, it is perceived to be natural for audit companies to be involved in its development. To be involved in innovations was also considered important. Related to the second research question, to whom is XBRL mainly developed for and its value-added for information process participants, the interviewees saw that XBRL benefits mostly authorities and users of financial information such as analysts. Answering the third research question, what are the main outcomes of XBRL for audit companies, requires that four background factors are taken into account. First factor is whether reporting in XBRL is made mandatory or not in a given country. Without a mandate, XBRL is not likely to have great implications for any function. Second, for what purposes XBRL is used (for example filing financial statements, tax filings or <b>supervisory</b> <b>reporting)</b> determines which functions are affected by it. For example, banks use XBRL and they may need consulting and risk services offered by audit companies. Third, the history and structure of audit firms differ which means that same aspects of XBRL are dealt with in different functions. Lastly, the characteristics of the reporting firm have to be considered. If companies choose to implement XBRL deeper into their accounting systems, then they must have effective internal controls and it also enables more effective way to analyze information...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} {{the role of}} guarantees on loan interest rates {{before and during the}} recent financial crisis in Italian firm financing. The paper improves on existing literature by distinguishing between real and personal guarantees. Further, the paper investigates the potential different role of guarantees in the bank-borrower relationship during the recent financial crisis. This paper draws from individual Italian bank and firm data taken from the Banks’ <b>Supervisory</b> <b>Reports</b> to the Bank of Italy and the Central Credit Register over the period 2006 - 2009. Our analysis demonstrates that collateral affects the cost of credit of Italian firms by systematically reducing the interest rate of secured loans, while personal guarantees increase it. These effects are amplified during the crisis. Furthermore, guarantees are a more powerful instrument for ex-ante riskier borrowers than for safer borrowers. Indeed, riskier borrowers obtain significantly lower interest rates on secured loans than interest rate they would be charged on unsecured loans. ...|$|R
40|$|I {{study the}} design of optimal {{compensation}} schemes in a repeated principal-supervisoragent hierarchy. While the principal observes a noisy signal about agent’s effort and the supervisor’s report, the agent and supervisor can perfectly observe each other’s actions. In a repeated setting, this allows the employees to punish each other without error for shirking. The optimal compensation schemes are designed to trade off incentives {{to work in the}} current period against inducing the most severe punishments following a deviation. On the equilibrium path, optimal schemes provide incentives for the agent by compensating for favorable <b>supervisory</b> <b>report,</b> and off the equilibrium path by inducing severe minmax punishments. In contrast, in a static setting the likelihood ratios (the informational content of performance measures) shape the optimal schemes. Thus repeated interaction generates compensation policies that would not be optimal in a static setting. Collusion-proofness, the idea that the supervisor and the agent could collude and coordinate to select an equilibrium that is more favorable to them, if it exists, is a particular concern. Under certain conditions, I find that the equilibrium under optimal compensation schemes is also collusion-proof...|$|R

Among {{the objectives of the}} programme are to enable students to follow the academic system based on their academic ability and to develop their potential skill through experience at work place. Based on the 1998 School to Career Report and the consecutive 1999 and 200 Pilot Project <b>Supervisory</b> <b>Reports</b> it was generally found that the programme has been well received by the parties directly involved in the programme.

40|$|Objective: Supervised {{experience}} is a crucial element {{in the education of}} trainee sport psychologists (TSPs). Insight into the issues that are raised in supervision is relevant for the development of educational programs. The {{purpose of this study was}} to gain insight into supervisory issues of TSPs. Design: A mixed methods design was employed. Method: 369 supervision questions from fourteen TSPs were collected from written <b>supervisory</b> <b>reports.</b> The supervision questions were initially rated on the supervisory issues described by Loganbill, Hardy, and Delworth (1982) and Rabinowitz, Heppner, and Roehlke (1986). Inter-rater agreement and occurrence of issues were calculated. An alternative model for supervision questions of TSPs was developed through inductive and deductive analyses. Results: For most of the supervisory issues described by Loganbill et al. (1982) and Rabinowitz et al. (1986) the inter-rater agreement and occurrence was low. An alternative model was developed consisting of two higher-order categories ('Know-how' and 'Professional development'), six lower-order categories ('Intake', 'Treatment plan', 'Execution', 'Reflections', 'Working principles' and 'Coping with dilemmas') and 19 separate themes. Conclusions: The supervisory issues proposed by Loganbill et al. (1982) and Rabinowitz et al. (1986) do not fully capture the learning needs for supervision as formulated by the TSPs studied. Our alternative model provides an overview of supervision questions of TSPs. The developed model may contribute to the quality of trainees' learning in supervision by helping both trainees and supervisors prepare for supervision, and by helping sport psychology educators to offer efficacious curricula and learning experiences. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Building on {{conservation}} of resources theory, we cast resource depletion as a novel explanatory mechanism to explain why employees’ experience of psychological contract violation results in harm to third parties outside the employee-organization exchange dyad. This resource-based perspective extends and complements the dominant social exchange perspective which views employee reactions to psychological contract violation as targeting {{the source of the}} violation – the organization. The present paper reports on three studies. Study 1 conducted an experiment with 109 participants and established the main effect of psychological contract violation on resource depletion. Study 2, using survey data from 315 medical employees and their immediate supervisors, found that after controlling for the social exchange mechanism (i. e., revenge cognitions toward the organization), resource depletion mediated the indirect effects of psychological contract violation on <b>supervisory</b> <b>reports</b> of employees’ interpersonal harming toward coworkers and decision-making vigilance for clients. Further, we found that organizational and professional identification played opposing moderating roles in the effects of violation on resource depletion and consequently behavioral outcomes, such that these mediated relationships were stronger when organizational identification was high, and weaker when professional identification was high. Study 3 replicated all the results obtained in Studies 1 and 2 with time-lagged data from 229 medical employees across three measurement points. The findings confirm that resource depletion is a more effective explanation of the consequences of violation on third parties than revenge cognitions, although both are useful in predicting organization-directed outcomes (i. e., civic virtue and organizational rule compliance) ...|$|R

However, Congquin, a listed company, failed to issue a SBR in its 1998 annual report. This study specifically investigates {{the usefulness of the}} SBR by examining the stock market reaction to Congquin's SBR omission. The study also examines the <b>Supervisory</b> Board's <b>reporting</b> process and users' perceived usefulness of the SBR through interviews with directors, supervisory board members and senior executives of 16 {{listed companies}}. Discussions were also held with financial analysts, regulatory officials and academics. Our event study suggests that the absence of the SBR in Congquin's 1998 annual report caused a negative market reaction suggesting that investors had considered the SBR and the Supervisory Board important and were discouraged by the problems manifested by the absence of the SBR. Our interviews reveal that the usefulness of the SBR depends on the role that the Supervisory Board plays in corporate governance. If the Supervisory Board is an honoured guest, a friendly advisor, or a censored watchdog, {{it is unlikely that the}} SBR will convey much useful information. By contrast, if the Supervisory Board acts as an independent watchdog, then the SBR would be useful. Given the fact that the Supervisory Board in most of the companies that participated in the interviews fell into the first three categories, there remains a strong need to improve the usefulness of the SBR and strengthen the functioning of the Supervisory Board.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{concerned}} {{with the lack of}} information regarding school- based instructional supervision practices in Saudi Arabian public secondary schools, with specific attention paid to the perceptions of instructional supervision held by teachers. Therefore, the main aim {{of this study was to}} examine what secondary teachers perceive as effective instructional supervision and to examine the current state of school-based instructional supervisory practices and procedures in Saudi Arabian public secondary schools from the perceptions of headteachers, teachers, and district education officers. Specific research questions focused on the respondents' perceptions of and preferences for the focuses and practices of school-based instructional supervision, supervisory personnel, staff development programmes relevant to instructional supervision, and desired changes for improvement supervision practices. A survey design was utilised for this study. Data for the study were collected through questionnaires and interviews. The questionnaires were completed by 272 teachers and in-depth interviews were conducted with 33 participants (18 teachers, 10 headteachers, and 5 district education officers), thus yielding a total of 305 participants. The findings reveal supervision practices were marred by questionable practices associated with victimisation, intimidation, inconsistency, confusion, and biases. The supervisors lacked the necessary supervisory skills, were not serious about their supervisory roles, and, consequently, they were not taken seriously by teachers. In addition, the findings of this study indicate that instructional supervision are characterised by conflicting role expectations that cause stress and mistrust for teachers and instructional supervisors and that the development of clearly written policies on instructional supervision is an area needing the greatest attention. Among the proposed changes for the improvement of supervision practices, based on the findings of the study, were (a) encouraging supervisors to be objective and teacher-friendly; (b) encouraging headteachers to take the leading role in school-based supervision by developing interest in supervision, allowing themselves to be supervised by other members of the teaching staff, and getting involved in classroom teaching to become acquainted with ongoing classroom events; (c) providing appropriate rewards and incentives to teachers who receive good <b>supervisory</b> <b>reports</b> or take initiatives to facilitate their professional learning; and (d) fostering collaboration and teamwork among teachers and instructional supervisors.

Furthermore, we analyze the strategies those shipyards implement to survive the crisis. The concern of this research is both qualitative and quantitative. Hence, we calculate a complete set of financial ratios adopting a specific methodology for financial statement analysis, taking into account 2006 - 2013 financial years. That data is integrated with other information retrieved from companies annual report (i. e. the notes to the accounts, management <b>reports</b> and <b>supervisory</b> board <b>reports).</b> This study finds out that both companies suffer financial health and they do not register a satisfactory level of profitability, as well as a low rate of liquidly because of an excessive reliance on current liabilities. However, the key strategies to succeed are ongoing investments in state-of-the-art plant and machinery, an increasing use of equity (even though it is eroded by losses), along with steadily investments in R&D, trademarks, licenses and international nautical fairs...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the topics of}} (1) high level control of underwater vehicles; (2) identification of a class of finite-dimensional multiple degree of freedom (DOF) coupled dynamical plant models for underwater vehicles; and (3) nonlinear control of underwater vehicles based upon fully coupled dynamical plant models. The problem of high-level control of underwater vehicles is addressed {{with the development of}} a new supervisory control system. The <b>reported</b> <b>supervisory</b> control system is currently deployed on three underwater vehicles. Results with a field-deployed autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) were given as working examples to demonstrate capabilities of our mission controller. The second problem —identification of a class of coupled dynamical plant models — is addressed by a review of these models and their experimental validation on the JHUROV underwater vehicle. First, we review the derivation of the general coupled nonlinear 6 -DOF finite-dimensional approximate dynamical model for a sub-merged body. The dynamical model of underwater vehicles is then expressed in thre...|$|R

Laws and regulations concerning corporate governance and their enforcement have been drastically improved during these years. The new legal and regulatory framework includes Corporate Governance Guidelines issued in 2003, directives related to audit and accounting standards and practices issued in and after 2003 by the Capital Markets Board of Turkey (CMB), a new Banking Law, and directives issued by the Banking Regulatory and <b>Supervisory</b> Agency. This <b>report</b> summarizes the finding of the fourth survey and provides an insight into the impact of the regulatory changes on disclosure. The data collected are used for further research by CGFT researchers, to analyze the relationship between disclosure and transparency, disclosure and performance, and disclosure and firm characteristics. ...|$|R
