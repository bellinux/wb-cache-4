5|$|Pierre Gaultier de Varennes, <b>sieur</b> de La Vérendrye, {{visited the}} Red River Valley in the 1730s to help open {{the area for}} French {{exploration}} and trade. As French explorers entered the area, a Montreal-based company, the North West Company, began trading with the Métis. Both the North West Company and the Hudson's Bay Company built fur-trading forts; the two companies competed in southern Manitoba, occasionally resulting in violence, until they merged in 1821 (the Hudson's Bay Company Archives in Winnipeg preserve {{the history of this}} era).|$|E

5|$|<b>Sieur</b> de La Vérendrye {{built the}} first fur trading post on the site in 1738, called Fort Rouge. French trading {{continued}} at this site for several decades {{before the arrival of}} the British Hudson's Bay Company after France ceded the territory following its defeat in the Seven Years' War. Many French and later British men who were trappers married First Nations women; their mixed-race children hunted, traded, and lived in the area. They gradually developed as an ethnicity known as the Métis because of sharing a traditional culture.|$|E
5|$|Before European {{settlement}} of North America, Minnesota was populated by a subculture of Sioux called the Dakota people. As Europeans settled the east coast, Native Americans {{moved away from}} them causing migration of the Anishinaabe (also known as Ojibwe) and other Native Americans into the Minnesota area. The first Europeans in the area were French voyageur fur traders who arrived in the 17th century and began using the Grand Portage to access trapping and trading areas further inland. Late that century, Anishinaabe migrated westward to Minnesota, causing tensions with the Dakota people. Explorers such as Daniel Greysolon, <b>Sieur</b> du Lhut, Father Louis Hennepin, Jonathan Carver, Henry Schoolcraft, and Joseph Nicollet mapped out the state.|$|E
5|$|Further {{exploration}} of Indiana {{led to the}} French establishing an important trade route between Canada and Louisiana via the Maumee and Wabash rivers. The French built a series of forts and outposts in Indiana as a hedge against the westward expansion of the British colonies from {{the east coast of}} North America and to encourage trade with the native tribes. The tribes were able to procure metal tools, cooking utensils, and other manufactured items in exchange for animal pelts. The French built Fort Miamis in the Miami town of Kekionga (modern Fort Wayne, Indiana). France assigned Jean Baptiste Bissot, <b>Sieur</b> de Vincennes, as the first agent to the Miami at Kekionga.|$|E

5|$|Morton {{was elected}} to Mar's office and proved {{in many ways the}} most {{effective}} of James's regents, but he made enemies by his rapacity. He fell from favour when Frenchman Esmé Stewart, <b>Sieur</b> d'Aubigny, first cousin of James's father Lord Darnley and future Earl of Lennox, arrived in Scotland and quickly established himself as the first of James's powerful favourites. Morton was executed on 2 June 1581, belatedly charged with complicity in Darnley's murder. On 8 August, James made Lennox the only duke in Scotland. The king, then fifteen years old, remained under the influence of Lennox for about one more year.|$|E
5|$|René-Robert Cavelier, <b>Sieur</b> de La Salle (1643–87) was a French explorer. In 1682, La Salle led a canoe {{expedition}} {{to explore the}} Mississippi River basin. The expedition landed to hunt, when one of their members went missing. The armorer Pierre Prudhomme was assumed captured by Chickasaw Indians. La Salle decided to stay and search for the missing member. La Salle had a stockade built and named it Fort Prudhomme, after their lost man. This was the first structure built by the French in Tennessee. Days later, the missing member found his way back. Prudhomme had lost his way while hunting. The expedition reached {{the mouth of the}} Mississippi River on April 6, 1682.|$|E

5|$|The first European outpost within modern Indiana was Tassinong, a French {{trading post}} {{established}} in 1673 near the Kankakee River. French explorer René-Robert Cavelier, <b>Sieur</b> de La Salle {{came to the}} area in 1679, claiming it for King Louis the XIV of France. La Salle came to explore a portage between the St. Joseph and Kankakee rivers, and Father Ribourde, who traveled with La Salle, marked trees along the way. The marks survived to be photographed in the 19th century. In 1681, La Salle negotiated a common defense treaty between the Illinois and Miami nations against the Iroquois.|$|E
5|$|French {{exploration}} in Minnesota is known have {{begun in the}} 17th century with explorers like Radisson, Groseilliers, and Le Sueur. After France signed a treaty {{with a number of}} tribes to allow trade in the area, French settlements began to appear. Trader Daniel Greysolon, <b>Sieur</b> du Lhut explored the western area of Lake Superior helping to advance trade and leading to the establishment of Fond du Lac (part of modern Duluth, which was named after du Lhut). Roman Catholic priest Louis Hennepin, captured by the Sioux in 1680 while exploring North America with famed explorer La Salle, discovered and named Saint Anthony Falls. The next account of an expedition into Minnesota's interior was that of Captain Jonathan Carver of Connecticut who reached Saint Anthony Falls in 1766. In the later 18th century trader Peter Pond explored the Minnesota River valley noting significant European settlement in the region in addition to the natives.|$|E
5|$|In 1717, François-Marie Picoté de Belestre {{established}} {{the post of}} Ouiatenon (modern Lafayette, Indiana) to discourage the Wea from coming under British influence. In 1732, François-Marie Bissot, <b>Sieur</b> de Vincennes, established a similar post near the Piankeshaw in the town that still bears his name. Although the forts were garrisoned by men from New France, Fort Vincennes was the only outpost to maintain a permanent European presence until the modern day. Jesuit priests accompanied many of the French soldiers into Indiana {{in an attempt to}} convert the natives to Christianity. The Jesuits conducted missionary activities, lived among the natives and learned their languages, and accompanied them on hunts and migrations. Gabriel Marest, one of the first missionaries in Indiana, taught among the Kaskaskia as early as 1712. The missionaries came to have great influence among the natives and {{played an important role in}} keeping the native tribes allied with the French.|$|E

5|$|Seventy years later, the French {{explorer}} Samuel de Champlain {{reported that}} the StLawrence Iroquoians and their settlements had disappeared altogether from the StLawrence valley. This {{is believed to be}} due to outmigration, epidemics of European diseases, or intertribal wars. In 1611 Champlain established a fur trading post on the Island of Montreal, on a site initially named La Place Royale. At the confluence of Petite Riviere and St. Lawrence River, it is where present-day Pointe-à-Callière stands. On his 1616 map, Samuel de Champlain named the island Lille de Villemenon, in honour of the <b>sieur</b> de Villemenon, a French dignitary who was seeking the viceroyship of New France. In 1639 Jérôme Le Royer de La Dauversière obtained the Seigneurial title to the Island of Montreal {{in the name of the}} Notre Dame Society of Montreal to establish a Roman Catholic mission to evangelize natives.|$|E
5|$|The Natchez revolt, or the Natchez Massacre, was {{an attack}} by the Natchez people on French colonists near present-day Natchez, Mississippi, on November29, 1729. The Natchez and French had lived {{alongside}} {{each other in the}} Louisiana colony {{for more than a decade}} prior to the incident, mostly conducting peaceful trade and occasionally intermarrying. After a period of deteriorating relations, however, Natchez leaders were provoked to revolt when the French colonial commandant, <b>Sieur</b> de Chépart, demanded land from a Natchez village for his own plantation near Fort Rosalie. They plotted their attack over several days and managed to conceal their plans from most of the French; those who overheard and warned Chépart of an attack were considered untruthful and were punished. In a coordinated attack on the fort and the homesteads, the Natchez killed almost all of the Frenchmen, while sparing most of the women and African slaves. Approximately 230 colonists were killed overall, and the fort and homes were burned to the ground.|$|E
5|$|The St. Joseph Valley {{was long}} {{occupied}} by Native Americans. One {{of the earliest}} known groups to occupy what would later become northern Indiana was the Miami tribe. Later, the Potawatomi moved into the region, utilizing the rich food and natural resources found along the river. The Potawatomi occupied this region of Indiana until {{most of them were}} forcibly removed in the 1840s. The South Bend area was so popular because its portage was the shortest overland route from the St. Joseph River to the Kankakee River. This route was used for centuries, first by the Native Americans, then by French explorers, missionaries and traders. The French explorer René-Robert Cavelier, <b>Sieur</b> de La Salle, the first white European to set foot in what is now South Bend, used this portage between the St. Joseph River and the Kankakee River in December 1679.|$|E

5|$|The first {{conflict}} between the French and the Natchez took place in 1716, when the Governor of Louisiana, Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, <b>sieur</b> de Cadillac, passed through Natchez territory and neglected to renew the alliance with the Natchez by smoking the peace calumet. The Natchez reacted to this slight by killing four French traders. Cadillac sent his lieutenant Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville to punish the Natchez. He deceived the Natchez leaders by inviting them to attend a parley, where he ambushed and captured them, and forced the Natchez to exchange their leaders for the culprits who had attacked the French. A number of random Natchez from the pro-British villages were executed. This caused French–Natchez relations to further deteriorate. As part {{of the terms of}} the peace accord following this First Natchez War, the Natchez promised to supply labor and materials {{for the construction of a}} fort for the French. The fort was named Fort Rosalie, and it was aimed at protecting the French trade monopoly in the region from British incursions.|$|E
5|$|The ships {{carried a}} total of nearly 300people, {{including}} soldiers, artisans and craftsmen, sixCatholic missionaries, eightmerchants, and over a dozen women and children. Shortly after their departure, France and Spain ceased hostilities, and Louis was no longer interested in sending La Salle further assistance. Details of the voyage were kept secret so that Spain would not learn about it. La Salle's naval commander, the <b>Sieur</b> de Beaujeu, resented La Salle's keeping their destination until the party was well underway. The discord between the two intensified {{when they reached the}} island of Santo Domingo and quarreled over where to anchor. Beaujeu sailed {{to another part of the}} island, allowing Spanish privateers to capture the St. François, which had been fully loaded with supplies, provisions, and tools for the colony.|$|E
5|$|James VI was crowned King of Scots {{at the age}} of 13 {{months on}} 29 July 1567. He was brought up as a Protestant, while the country was run by a series of regents. In 1579 the Frenchman Esmé Stewart, <b>Sieur</b> d'Aubigny, first cousin of James' father Lord Darnley, arrived in Scotland and quickly {{established}} himself as the closest of the then 13-year-old James's powerful male favourites; he was created Earl of Lennox by the king in 1580, and Duke of Lennox in 1581. Lennox was distrusted by Scottish Calvinists and in August 1582, in {{what became known as the}} Ruthven Raid, the Protestant earls of Gowrie and Angus imprisoned James and forced Lennox to leave Scotland. After James was liberated in June 1583, he assumed increasing control of his kingdom. Between 1584 and 1603, he established effective royal government and relative peace among the lords, assisted by John Maitland of Thirlestane, who led the government until 1592. In 1586, James signed the Treaty of Berwick with England, which, with the execution of his mother in 1587, helped clear the way for his succession to the childless Queen Elizabeth I of England. He married Anne of Denmark in 1590, daughter of Frederick II, the king of Denmark; she bore him two sons and a daughter.|$|E
