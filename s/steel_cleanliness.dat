50|$|For VIM-VAR steels, {{the surface}} of the cooled {{electrodes}} must be ground to remove surface irregularities and impurities before the next vacuum remelt. Then the ground electrode is placed in a VAR furnace. In a VAR furnace the steel gradually melts drop-by-drop in the vacuum-sealed chamber. Vacuum arc remelting further removes lingering inclusions to provide superior <b>steel</b> <b>cleanliness</b> and further remove gases such as oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen. Controlling the rate at which these droplets form and solidify ensures a consistency of chemistry and microstructure throughout the entire VIM-VAR ingot. This in turn makes the steel more resistant to fracture or fatigue. This refinement process is essential to meet the performance characteristics of parts like a helicopter rotor shaft, a flap actuator on a military jet or a bearing in a jet engine.|$|E

50|$|Blast {{cleaning}} is {{the most}} commonly used method for preparation of steel surfaces. This effectively removes rust, scale, slats, etc., from the surface and produces an industrial grade cleaning and a rough surface finish. The roughness of the steel achieved after blasting is referred to as profile, which is measured in micrometers or mils. Commonly used to profile ranges for FBE coatings are 37 to 100 micrometers (1.5 to 4 mils). Profile increases the effective surface area of the <b>steel.</b> The <b>cleanliness</b> achieved is assessed to ISO 8501-1 grades: these originated from a set of photographic slides in a Swedish standard (SIS) showing exemplars of the common terminology of white-metal, near white-metal, etc. Typically, SA 2½ is used for pipelines (equivalent to NACE N°2).|$|R
40|$|During {{the cold}} {{reduction}} of steel sheet in a rolling mill, rolling oils {{are used for}} lubrication to provide the desired steel surface. Rolling oil formulations consist largely of mineral oils, glycerides and/or synthetic esters, fatty acids, emulsifiers and additives. These oils are generally used as 2 - 5 % emulsions and will be subjected to high temperature and pressure during use. This results in chemical changes within the oil that can affect <b>steel</b> surface <b>cleanliness</b> after annealing. It is advantageous to have rolling oils that are stable but easily removed during annealing and leaving a minimal amount of residues. Thus {{in the field of}} rolling mill technology the surface quality of rolled product and stability of rolling oils are critical in the selection of lubricants. Additionally, production cost and environmental impact are also critical in the selection of lubricants. In this study, the performance of vegetable-based rolling oils was investigated by recording the FTIR spectra of the oils using Horizontal Attenuated Total Reflectance, an internal reflection accessory, before and after systematic heat treatment. Evidence was found that the vegetable-based oils degraded on heating and the spectroscopic analysis indicated that this was due to rearrangement of unsaturated components from a cis to a trans configuration.

Such improvements to these processes and the resulting level of <b>steel</b> <b>cleanliness</b> at Baosteel are summarised in the present paper. Ladle slag reduction lowers FeOzMnO in the slag to below 5 %, decreasing steel reoxidation by the slag.

Two new methods for the ultrasonic evaluation of steel melt cleanliness are suggested. These methods use a measured value such as attenuation and a complex theoretical description of acoustic wave theory to produce the size distribution of inclusions. One of the methods depends upon the estimation of particle distribution parameters and the measurement of a general attenuation value. The other, relies on the detection of individual particles, via the scattered ultrasonic energy, below the classically defined reso-lution limit of particle diameter d ≥ λ/ 2. The difference between detection of this nature and resolving is defined and demonstrated using several scaled up experiments along with water modeling.

40|$|Manganese-containing oxysulphides {{can be used}} to {{minimise}} the {{detrimental effects}} of oxide inclusions and to improve mechanical properties of steel products, like ductility, fatigue strength and machinability. The effective utilization of Mn-containing oxysulphide inclusions requires an accurate control on their characteristics, e. g. chemistry, microstructure, size distribution and morphology. Therefore a deep understanding of their formation and behaviour during desulphurisation, deoxidation and alloying is necessary for a complete manipulation of Mn-containing oxysulphide inclusions. In {{the first part of the}} research, the desulphurisation and inclusion behaviour of stainless steel refining were investigated by using CaO-Al 2 O 3 based top slags. Although a relatively lower sulphide capacity was obtained for an optimised CaO-Al 2 O 3 slag (50 % CaO, 40. 4 % Al 2 O 3, 4. 3 % SiO 2, 2. 1 % Fe 2 O 3, 1. 7 % TiO 2 and 0. 6 % MgO) compared to current CaO-SiO 2 -CaF 2 slag, an equivalent desulphurisation efficiency and an improved <b>steel</b> <b>cleanliness</b> were obtained with this optimised CaO-Al 2 O 3 slag. Based on these results, the substitution of current CaO-CaF 2 based slag with CaO-Al 2 O 3 based slag for stainless steel refining was discussed and evaluated. In the second part of the work, the interfacial reaction between molten steel and Mn/FeMnSi alloys at the early stages of deoxidation/alloying were studied with a metal suction method. A layer of Fe solidified around the cold alloy immediately after alloy addition. While enclosed by this Fe shell, the alloy was partially molten due to its low melting temperature. The oxysulphide inclusions were formed at the Mn-rich side of the interface, while an inclusion free zone was detected in the Fe-rich side close to the interface. Based on experimental findings and theoretical calculations, the mechanisms governing the Fe/Mn (or Fe/FeMnSi) interdiffusion and the inclusion free zone formation were proposed. Steel alloying, such as Mn, Al, FeSi and FeMn additions to the liquid steel with different oxygen and sulphur content was also simulated with a confocal scanning laser microscope combined with a special addition device. The effects of the sulphur and oxygen content in liquid iron, as well as that of the deoxidant type on the formation of oxides/oxysulphides were investigated. The inclusion behaviour on the liquid iron surface, i. e. the interaction after inclusion formation, the dissolution during the high temperature iso-thermal holding and growth during the cooling were observed. This part of the work contributes to the optimisation (or manipulation) of deoxidation/alloying operations to control the formation and characteristics of Mn-containing inclusions.

40|$|The {{flow pattern}} has widely been {{recognized}} {{to have an}} impact on the exogenous non-metallic inclusion generation in the gating system and mold flux entrapment in the uphill teeming process. Thus, a well-controlled flow pattern during the teeming process can improve the quality of ingots and further increase the yield during steel production. The current study focused on investigating and optimizing the flow pattern of steel in the gating system and molds to improve <b>steel</b> <b>cleanliness</b> during the initial filling moment. A mathematical model considering a trumpet was initially compared to a reduced model only considering part of the runner channel. Thereafter, the influence of swirl blades implemented at the bottom of the vertical runner on the improvement of initial filling conditions in the molds was investigated in a model considering the entire mold system including a trumpet. The effects of a swirl blade orientation on a swirling flow were further discussed. The simulation results, when utilizing swirl blades, were also verified by plant trials performed at Scana Steel. In addition, a new novel swirling flow generation component, TurboSwirl, was studied in a model considering the entire mold system including a trumpet. The model was based on modifications of the refractory geometry at the elbow of the runners near the mold without the usage of an inserted flow control device in the gating system. Owing to its great potential for improving the flow pattern of steel during the initial filling moment, the effect of TurboSwirl on <b>steel</b> <b>cleanliness</b> was also studied. The results showed that the initial filling conditions during the uphill teeming process can be improved by using a swirl blade or a TurboSwirl in the gating system. This makes it possible to further decrease the initial position of mold powder bags. In addition, it reduces the possibilities of exogenous non-metallic inclusion generation in the gating system as well as mold flux entrapment in the mold during the uphill teeming process. However, the utilization of swirl blades created a considerable amount of droplets when steel entered the molds during the first couple of seconds, which also was verified by the plant trials. The introduction of TurboSwirl showed a greater potential than a swirl blade due to a more evenly distributed swirling flow. The DPM model adopted in the simulations revealed that the TurboSwirl can improve <b>steel</b> <b>cleanliness</b> by increasing the non-metallic inclusion collision rate both with respect to Stokes and turbulent collisions.

Cracking on the bend faces of steel is a major defect, which usually causes rejection of the sufficient volumes of steel. Crack resistance during deep drawing, depends of multiple metallurgical factors. Some of these parameters are: steel chemistry and thickness, microstructure and cleanliness, strength level and degree of restraint, etc. In some cases, cracks also initiated, upon bending a sheared or burned edge.

SAMPLING PROCEDURE To characterize steel susceptibility to cracking, samples of processed plates were collected from the outside, inside and middle wrap of the processed coils. "Hard way " test coupons (long axis of samples is parallel to the rolling direction) were made in accordance to the General Requirements for Steel, Sheet, Carbon, and High Strength, Low-Alloy, Hot-Rolled grades of steel (ASTM A 568 /A 56 SH- 91 a) [4, 5, 6]. The 100 -ton hydraulic press was used for bending the specimen. Samples were bent ‘flat-on-self, or until crack appeared on the upper bent surface. The maximum diameter of the bend at the point of cracking for each specimen measured, and then DT_RATIO (the bend diameter / coil gage- 0 is the best), were calculated, as a measure of the bendability. Two samples of each bent coupon, representing the edge and quarter location across the coil width, analyzed for <b>steel</b> <b>cleanliness.</b> <b>Steel</b> <b>cleanliness</b> rated in accordance with Method A, ASTM E- 45.

40|$|Deposited with {{reference}} to the publisher’s open access archiving policy, available at [URL] quantitative method for assessing the influence of <b>steel</b> <b>cleanliness</b> on the fatigue life of rolling bearing raceways is presented. The approach systematically accounts for the effect of the highly variable stress state within raceways. Finite element analysis is used to determine the stress state in the bearings. A fracture mechanics model for the safe stress amplitude as a function of inclusion size is employed from Lewis and Tomkins. The size and number of large inclusions in a large volume of steel are estimated by the Generalised Pareto Distribution. These three elements are combined to determine the failure probability of the raceway in an example rolling bearing. A sensitivity analysis to the various microstructural input parameters is conducted. It is found that the size distribution of the larger inclusions is {{the most important factor in}} controlling the fatigue resistance of rolling bearings, and that residual stresses must be considered to produce realistic predictions.

40|$|To stay {{competitive}} in the steel industry, steelmakers are utilizing different production methods to reduce production cost without compromising {{on the quality of}} their products. In steelmaking, the production process plays a significant role on the <b>steel</b> <b>cleanliness.</b> Recent increasing demands on the cleanliness level therefore require optimization of production process to meet the requirement. Often, the types and distribution of non-metallic inclusions in steel determines the <b>steel</b> <b>cleanliness.</b> In order to optimize the production process, complete assessment of the non-metallic inclusions in the steel is necessary, leading to implementation of measures to control and/or remove non-metallic inclusions in the steel. The present study was performed to investigate the cleanliness level of steel bars produced from a high frequency induction furnace (HF) route at Uddeholms AB. Experimental studies were carried out and characteristics such as number, composition, size distribution and morphology of non-metallic inclusions were investigated. Total oxygen and total nitrogen content were also measured for indirect assessment. Further, the production operations at the HF were observed and evaluated to determine their influence on the inclusion characteristics. The characteristics obtained were compared with characteristics of inclusions in steel bars produced from an electric arc furnace production (EAF) route at Uddeholms AB and a competitor producer sample. The results showed that the level of cleanliness varies from different production routes and is hence dependent on the process at each production route. The number, maximum and mean size of inclusions were found to be higher in the HF route compared to the other routes. More so, there were differences in the types of oxide inclusions observed from each process route. However, sulphide inclusions exhibit similar characteristics from the different process routes. Further, the compositions of oxide inclusions observed from the HF route were found to be closely related to the steel chemistry. More importantly, the types of inclusions formed in the HF route were found to be sensitively affected by the extent of aluminium and calcium contents in the steel. Thus, the oxide inclusion types in the HF samples could be traced to the extent of different additions and operations such as deoxidation and calcium treatment that were carried out during the steelmaking process...|$|E

Image analysis of the spout eyes during degassing was performed were the spout eyes area was measured every 10 ’th second and compared to total visible slag surface. Resulting mean values correlated with N and H removal and oxidization of Al, which was found to be an indicator of the degree of stirring. Inclusions in rolled plate, made from charges with variated blowing procedure, were classified according to SS 11 11 16 and it was found that rinse stirring during the latter half of degassing is beneficial for inclusion removal. Results from test charges have been compared to other vacuum degassed charges during 2010 and it was concluded that a high degree of gas stirring is beneficial for H, N and S removal. For the particular steel studied, toughness was not seen to depend on inclusions. Validerat; 20110126 (anonymous...|$|E

Nonmetallic inclusions of sizes smaller than 15 µm are hard to remove, as they are difficult to float. They are easily carried by the flow of steel melt into the mold and adversely affect the <b>steel</b> <b>cleanliness.</b> It is suggested that a gas curtain made of small bubbles of argon {{can be used to}} capture and remove these inclusions in the tundish, thus avoiding their transport into the mold. A 1 : 3 scale physical model of tundish of the continuous casting unit of ArcelorMittal plant, in Vitória, Brazil, was built to investigate the effects of gas flow, shape and positioning of the gas curtain inside the tundish, on the efficiency of removal of inclusions. The results suggest that the gas bubbling inside the tundish can be effective in inclusion removal. The efficiency is dependent upon the location of argon bubbling.

The inclusion {{formation and}} the inclusion interaction behavior immediately after the alloying and/or deoxidation were observed in situ. The inclusions were characterized based on both the in situ observation and the quenched sample. The effect of the sulphur and oxygen content in liquid iron, {{as well as that}} of the deoxidant type on the formation of oxides/oxysulfides is discussed taking consideration of the thermodynamics of the system. The inclusion behavior on the liquid iron surface, i. e., the interaction after its formation, the dissolution during the high temperature iso-thermal holding, and growth during the cooling was investigated. The dissolution of Mn(O,S) inclusions at 1843 K (1570 °C) was found to be driven by Mn diffusion through the inclusion/liquid iron boundary layer, and its growth during cooling was significantly affected by Marangoni flow. status: publishe...|$|E

The phenomenon is manifested through dark etching regions, 30 and 80 ° white etching bands as well as white etching areas, the latter often forming intricate defects {{commonly referred to as}} butterflies. Their presence depends on testing conditions such as contact pressure, temperature, number of revolutions and <b>steel</b> <b>cleanliness.</b> Microstructural inspection demonstrates that precipitate shearing, dissolution, cell and nanocrystal formation as well as matrix/inclusion debonding may take place throughout bearing life.

40|$|In common {{metallographic}} laboratory practice, object distributions in discontinuous multi-phase microstructures {{are characterized}} by incident light optical or scanning electron microscopy micrographs of polished planar microsections. Precipitation or dispersion particle hardened metal alloys and steel inclusions (e. g.

The area and from it the volume fraction of these objects can be taken directly from such micrograph series, simplest by applying digital image analysis.

40|$|The use of TurboSwirl {{to obtain}} an {{improved}} <b>steel</b> <b>cleanliness</b> during filling of an ingot was numerically studied by VOF and DPM models. It was found that a radius-reduced TurboSwirl or a proper tapered mold entrance nozzle with an adequate developed region for steel flow can {{reduce the risk of}} mold flux entrapment in a mold. The ingot casting process can create highly turbulent conditions inside the mold during the initial stages of casting. Since the TurboSwirl generates much calmer filling conditions it can promote separation of large nonmetallic inclusions. The TurboSwirl also collects large inclusions (200 [*]μm) towards the axis of rotation, which should promote agglomeration. In addition, the residence time for inclusions of small sizes can be prolonged, increasing chance of agglomeration, which indirectly promotes their separation from steel. Moreover, the average turbulent dissipation rate in an ingot casting swirl setup is about 40 % higher than that in a no swirl setup. This further facilitates the agglomeration of inclusions before they enter the mold. The removal of nonmetallic inclusions is thus enhanced because of an increasing inclusion collision rate due to both Stokes collisions and turbulent collisions, while maintaining a calm flow inside the mold...|$|E
40|$|Steel reoxidation in the tundish has a {{significant}} influence on the <b>steel</b> <b>cleanliness</b> and therefore on the mechanical properties of the final product. In the present work, the steel reoxidation by two types of gunning mass (GM), viz. magnesia- and alumina-based GM, and two types of tundish slag, viz. lime–alumina–silica and lime–alumina slags, has been investigated. The evolution of the steel composition during the test was analyzed and predicted based on thermodynamic and kinetic considerations. The calculated steel composition agrees well with measured values, when assuming the mass transfer in slag phase limits the reoxidation reactions. The oxidation capacity of the gunning mass and tundish slag is quantified by calculating the oxygen amount supplied from the GM and the slag to the steel phase. It was found that compared to alumina GM, magnesia GM exhibits a stronger oxidation capacity due to its higher content of reducible oxides (10 wt pct SiO 2 + 6 wt pct FeO). Compared to lime–alumina–silica tundish slag, lime–alumina slag (with more FeO + MnO contents) provides more oxygen to the molten steel in the present experimental conditions and consequently shows a stronger oxidation capacity. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{requirement}} for {{high quality steel}} especially high <b>steel</b> <b>cleanliness</b> has increased in recent years due to the rapid development of new technologies such as thin strip casting and new products such as ultra low carbon steel for deep drawing quality, which require high <b>steel</b> <b>cleanliness.</b> This {{has led to the}} development of the role of the tundish to enhance the removal of inclusions from steel. Two mathematical models have been developed to investigate the effect of various operating parameters on the removal efficiency of inclusions in a tundish. The first model was applied to predict the removal efficiency of the particle in a tundish without gas injection. Both models assumed that the fluid flow in the tundish consists of three regions; plug flow, mixed flow and dead flow region. In the plug flow region of flrst model, it was assumed that the removal efficiency of the particle was governed by Stoke rising velocity. The removal of partide in the mixed flow region was assunried to follow the kinetics of the flrst-order law. The dead region was not involved in the partide transfer process. The second model was devebped to predwt the rennoval effidency of particles in a tundish bubbled by gas. The transfer process of partk^le in the plug and dead flow region were assumed similar to the first model. In the mixing region, it was assumed that the removal of particles mainly occurs due to the adhesion of indusion to bubbles. The flotation rate of the partide therefore was assumed to be governed by collision efficiency between particles and bubbles. Cold model experiments were carried out to validate the proposed mathematical models. It was found that, the results from the first mathematical model were in good agreement with the results obtained from cold model experiments for a tundish without gas injection. Both mathematical and cold model experimental results showed that the efficiencies of particle removal in a tundish slightly increased with increasing fluid depth and decreased with increasing casting rate. It was also found that the removal efficiency of the particles was greatly dependent on the particle size. As predicted by the mathematicat model for removal of particles in a tundish bubbled by gas, the renrwival efficiency of partides in tfie tundish increased with increasing gas flow rates injected in tundish. Cold nrKXiel experiments showed the similar pattern wifri this mathematical prediction.

40|$|<b>Steel</b> <b>cleanliness</b> as a {{function}} of stirring practice during vacuum degassing treatment have been investigated in industrial studies at the steel plants of SSAB Special Steels in Oxelösund and Uddeholm AB in Hagfors. The cleanliness was examined with regards to the contents of sulphur, nitrogen and large inclusions (> 10 µm). The stirring practice during the vacuum degassing treatment has been studied with respect to time, namely by shortening the vacuum degassing treatment time from 24 to 15 minutes. Furthermore, the effect of the stirring intensity was studied by measuring the open eye zone using camera recordings. The focus has been to study the effect of a shortened vacuum degassing time as well as a controlled stirring intensity on the <b>steel</b> <b>cleanliness.</b> Moreover, study the effect of subsequent induction stirring, after vacuum degassing, on the amount of inclusions. By taking steel and slag samples taken before and after the vacuum degassing treatment, the different stirring practices could be investigated. It should be noted that all heats reached the desired composition regardless of the treatment time and stirring practice. The results from the trials at SSAB Special Steels showed that the stirring practice during vacuum degassing {{have an effect on the}} total number of inclusions. The strong argon stirring during vacuum degassing with visible open eyes resulted in an average increase of 400 % of the total amount of inclusions > 10 µm. However, no difference between a vacuum degassing time of 24 or 15 minutes was seen with respect to the increased amount of inclusions, denitrogenization or desulphurization. During the subsequent induction stirring, which was softer with no open eyes, the effect of the stirring practice was unclear due to overlapping confidence intervals. An average decrease of 65 % of the total amount of inclusions > 10 µm was seen for the heats  with non-overlapping confidence intervals. Based on these results it can be suggested that the use of a soft induction stirring after the vacuum degassing treatment as a possible process change to reach lower amounts of large inclusions. The stirring intensity during the vacuum degassing treatment was measured as the average ladle eye size during the trials at Uddeholm AB. This, due to that stronger stirring results in larger ladle eye zone. The results show that the amount of smaller inclusions ( 22. 4 μm). Moreover, the denitrogenization and desulphurization was not affected by the changed stirring intensity during vacuum degassing. It was also found that the average ladle eye size did not correlate to the logged average argon flow.   QC 20150522 </p...|$|E
