It becomes symptomatic only in a homozygote state and when present in association with other conditions like beta-thalassaemia, alpha-thalassaemia, HbE and HbH. Majority of the centres in India use conventional methods for diagnosis of haemoglobinopathies, which includes clinical and family history, complete blood counts (CBC), red cell indices, RDW, HbA 2, HbF estimation, <b>sickling</b> <b>test</b> and Hemoglobin electrophoresis. The limitations of these tests include identification of Hemoglobin (Hb) variants with same electrophoretic mobility (HbQ, HbG, HbD), in diagnosis of HbS traits and where low quantity of HbS is associated with negative <b>sickling</b> <b>test</b> and diagnosing certain compound heterozygous states (HbS – beta thalassaemia, HbS – HbD disease).

40|$|Introduction: Present study {{relates to}} the results of {{clinical}} examination of 10 patients with sickle hemoglobin. Material and Methods:All the patients belonged to TharuChaudhary community of Nepal. The patients were clinically examined. <b>Sickling</b> <b>test</b> was done using Sodium metasulphite. Hemoglobin agarose gel electrophoresis was done at alkaline pH. Total hemoglobin was estimated by cyanhemoglobin method. Results: <b>Sickling</b> <b>test</b> was positive in all the patients. In addition, electrophoresis revealed detection of HbS in all the patients. Four of 10 patients had homozygous sickle cell disease (βglobin genotype SS). Five other patients had heterozygous sickle cell trait (βglobin genotype AS). Another patient had double heterozygous sickle cell β+thalassemia; high level of fetal hemoglobin (16. 4 %) was also detected in this patient. Discussion: Capillary thromboses might have resulted in minor infarcts, resulting in pain in chest and abdomen. Conclusion:The patients belonged to mid-western region of Nepal; this region is infested with vivax malaria. High frequency of malaria in this region might have resulted in biological advantage for sickle hemoglobin patients...|$|E

40|$|Background: Sickle cell {{disease is}} one of the most common {{inherited}} blood disorders. Universal screening and early intervention have significantly helped to reduce childhood mortality in high-resource countries. However, persons living in low-resource settings are often not diagnosed until late childhood when they present with clinical symptoms. In addition, confirmation of disease in affected individuals in the urgent care setting is limited in both high- and low-resource areas, often leading to delay in treatment. All of the current diagnostic methods rely on advanced laboratory systems and are often prohibitively expensive and time-consuming in low-resource settings. To address this need, the <b>Sickle</b> SCAN ™ <b>test</b> has been developed to diagnose sickle cell disease and sickle cell trait at the point of care without electricity or advanced equipment. Methods: This study was conducted to evaluate and validate the diagnostic accuracy of the <b>Sickle</b> SCAN ™ <b>test,</b> a novel point of care <b>test</b> for <b>sickle</b> cell disease. Thus, we describe the laboratory testing and clinical validation of the <b>Sickle</b> SCAN ™ <b>test</b> in individuals> 1 year of age using capillary blood. The <b>Sickle</b> SCAN ™ <b>test</b> was created using advanced, qualitative lateral flow technology using capillary blood to identify the presence of hemoglobin A, S, and C allowing for detection of results with the naked eye. Results: Laboratory testing using venous blood demonstrated 99 % sensitivity and 99 % specificity for the diagnosis of HbSS, HbAS, HbSC, HbAC, and HbAA. Seventy-one subjects underwent capillary blood sampling at the point of care for further validation. This test detected the correct A, S, and C presence with an overall diagnostic accuracy of 99 % at the bedside. Conclusion: The <b>Sickle</b> SCAN ™ <b>test</b> has the potential to significantly impact the diagnosis and treatment for sickle cell disease worldwide as well as enhance genetic counseling at the point of care. Further validation testing will be conducted in newborns in resource-poor settings in upcoming studies...|$|R

40|$|Although {{sickling}} and {{solubility tests}} and peripheral blood film methods are today available for {{sickle cell disease}} screening in Uganda, their reliability and ease of applicability have not been determined. This study was therefore carried out to determine the reliability of sickling and solubility tests and peripheral blood film method for screening for SCD in Uganda. This was descriptive laboratory based study which was carried out at Makerere University College of Health Sciences. The 200 samples from children aged between 6 months and five years were independently analyzed using sickling and solubility tests and peripheral blood film method. Hemoglobin electrophoresis cellulose acetate {{was used as the}} gold standard. Sickling and solubility tests had sensitivities of 65. 0 % and 45. 0 % respectively and peripheral film had 35. 0 %. Sickling, solubility and peripheral film had specificities of 95. 6 %, 90. 0 % and 96. 7 % respectively. Sickling had diagnostic accuracy of 92. 5 %, solubility (85. 5 %) and peripheral film (90. 5 %). Sickling had a Cohen’s Kappa of 0. 6, solubility 0. 3 and peripheral film 0. 4. <b>Sickling</b> <b>test</b> had turn around time (TAT) of 38 minutes, solubility 70 minutes and peripheral 44 minutes. In conclusion, the <b>sickling</b> <b>test</b> was more reliable and easier to perform than solubility test and peripheral blood film method.

40|$|Objectives: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the prevalence, gender differences, and time trends of sickle cell trait in Beirut, Lebanon. Another objective was to describe a new screening technique for sickle cell trait carriers. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study carried out at a private laboratory in the southern suburb of Beirut, Lebanon between 2002 and 2014. The <b>sickling</b> <b>test</b> was carried out for each patient using two methods: the classical “sodium metabisulfite sickling test”, and the new “sickling test method” used in the private lab.  As a confirmatory test, haemoglobin electrophoresis was run on a random sample of 223 cases who were found to be positive using the two sickling tests.   Results: A total of 899 cases were found to be positive for the sickle cell trait out of 184, 105 subjects screened during the 12 -year period, prevalence = 0. 49 % (95 % CI: 0. 46 – 0. 52). Among the total sample, females were found to have higher prevalence, where no time trend over the studied period was noted.  The haemoglobin electrophoresis method confirmed the results of this new <b>sickling</b> <b>test</b> technique among the random sample of the 223 cases.   Conclusion: We found that the prevalence of sickle cell trait is lower as compared to other Arab countries, higher in females, with no significant time trend. The sickle cell test was found to be an accurate, simple and cheap test which could be easily added as a requirement to the pre-marital testing to screen for sickle cell trait carriers...|$|E
40|$|Background: Sickle Hemoglobin is {{the most}} common {{pathological}} hemoglobin mutation worldwide which forms sickle shape or elongated forms on deoxygenation. According to malaria hypothesis, there is resistance against malaria by the heterozygous carrier state. There is spread of Hb S allele from the highly malarial regions to most other regions worldwide. The study was conducted as Sickle Hemoglobin has been frequently seen in our institute. Materials and Methods: This study was conducted in the department of pathology, Maharajgunj medical campus, Tribhuwan University Teaching hospital, from January 2011 to January 2013. All the relevant data were obtained from the archives of the department. Hemoglobin electrophoresis was performed by Cellulose Acetate Electrophoresis at alkaline pH Method. <b>Sickling</b> <b>test</b> was done using sodium dithionite. Results: A total of 35 cases were diagnosed as sickle cell disorder. The male: female ratio was 2. 5 : 1 with the commonest age group 11 - 20 years (42. 8 %). Sixty percent showed hemoglobin between 6 - 8 gm/ dl. Tharu, Chaudhary and Tharu, Rana (91. 3 %) were the commonest ethnic group with both sickle cell anemia and trait. Lama, Neupane and Baral suffered only from trait. Mean corpuscular volume ranged from 82 to 94 fL. On peripheral blood smear reversible and irreversible sickle cells were present in 88. 56 % of cases and 11. 42 % were devoid of sickle cells. <b>Sickling</b> <b>test</b> was positive in all cases. On cellulose acetate electrophoresis 22 (62. 85 %) cases had Hb S, Hb F and Hb A 2 or HbS and Hb A 2 where as 13 (37. 1 %) showed Hb S, Hb A and Hb A 2 variants. Conclusion: The commonest ethnic group of Tharus(91. 3 %), Chaudhary and Rana are from Terai region of Nepal which is a malarial zone.

40|$|The {{clinical}} assessment ofa new therapeutic agent in {{sickle cell anaemia}} isnotoriously difficult because patients with this disorder are liable to undergo crises and remissions, often for no clear reason.

40|$|AbstractThe {{management}} of misaligned paternity findings raises important controversy worldwide. It has mainly, however, {{been discussed in}} the context of high-income countries. Genetic and genomics research, with the potential to show misaligned paternity, are becoming increasingly common in Africa. During a genomics study in Kenya, a dilemma arose over testing and sharing information on paternal sickle cell disease status. This dilemma may be paradigmatic of challenges in sharing misaligned paternity findings in many research and health care settings. Using a deliberative approach to community consultation to inform research practice, we explored residents' views on paternal testing and sharing misaligned paternity information. Between December 2009 and November 2010, 63 residents in Kilifi County were engaged in informed deliberative small group discussions, structured to support normative reflection within the groups, with purposive selection to explore diversity. Analysis was based on a modified framework analysis approach, drawing on relevant social science and bioethics literature. The methods generated in-depth individual and group reflection on morally important issues and uncovered wide diversity in views and values. Fundamental and conflicting values emerged around the importance of family interests and openness, underpinned by disagreement on the moral implications of marital infidelity and withholding truth. Wider consideration of ethical issues emerging in these debates supports locally-held reasoning that paternal <b>sickle</b> cell <b>testing</b> should not be undertaken in this context, in contrast to views that testing should be done with or without the disclosure of misaligned paternity information. The findings highlight the importance of facilitating wider testing of family members of affected children, contingent on {{the development and implementation of}} national policies for the {{management of}} this inherited disorder. Their richness also illustrates the potential for the approach adopted in this study to strengthen community consultation...|$|R
40|$|Hypertonus of {{masseter}} {{and chest}} wall muscle in one patient following intravenous suxamethonium is reported. Subsequent investigations including electromyography and muscle biopsy with in vitro pharmacological testing failed to reveal any abnormality {{to account for}} the response. The clinical problems presented to the anaesthetist when suxamethonium-induced hypertonus occurs are discussed. The relationship between a hypertonic reaction to suxamethonium and neuromuscular disease (including myotonic disorders and the malignant hyperpyrexia myopathy) is considered. Muscle hypertonus following i. v. suxamethonium is a rare and unexpected phenomenon. This abnormal reaction to suxamethonium presents the anaesthetist with the initial problems of securing an airway and maintaining adequate pulmonary ventilation as tris-mus and respiratory muscle spasm may jeopardize the patient's life. Also, there is the possibility that the reaction is the first clinical manifestation of malignant hyperpyrexia, the mortality of which is greater than 60 % (Britt and Kalow, 1970). Failure of skeletal muscle to relax after suxamethonium is considered by many to justify terminating the anaesthetic (Cody, 1968; Arens and McKinnon, 1971; Ryan, 1973 a). Thus the development of an abnormal reac-tion to suxamethonium merits subsequent investiga-tion to elucidate a cause for the response. Hypertonus following suxamethonium may occur in patients with myotonic disorders (Kaufman, 1960; Paterson, 1962; Thiel, 1967; Cody, 1968), and it is known to occur in patients with other neuromuscular disorders including the malignant hyperpyrexia myopathy. CASE REPORT A 26 -year-old Negro woman was admitted to the Birmingham Maternity Hospital with a history of spontaneous rupture of the membranes at a gestational age of 29 weeks. Despite rest and sedation, she went into labour and proceeded rapidly to the normal vaginal delivery of a 1. 3 -kg baby girl. The placenta was retained and the duty anaesthetist was asked to provide anaesthesia for its removal. The patient was noted to have a negative <b>sickle</b> cell <b>test</b> and a haemo-globin concentration of 14. 8 g % at her last visit t...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 73 - 77) Sickle cell anemia {{is one of}} {{the most}} common long term illnesses of black children. It is an incurable illness which is serious at any age but often fatal during childhood. Approximately one black person in twelve carries the sickle cell trait and the sickle cell anemia is thought to occur in one in five hundred births (44). Sickle cell anemia has been called the "neglected disease???. Until this year, there have been limited efforts to screen and educate the black community about the nature of the genetic disease. Since the disease is as yet incurable, prevention is the only present medical alternative. This thesis was concerned with the measurement of present knowledge of the sickle cell disease in a black community with the expectation that the findings would be of value in future program planning. The hypothesis of the study asked if people who came in for <b>sickle</b> cell screening <b>tests,</b> at a local Health Center, were significantly more knowledgeable about the disease than other groups of persons who used the services of the same Health Center, A questionnaire was administered to a total population of one hundred persons. Both of the sample groups were black and of a low socio-economic background, the results of the statistical analysis revealed that no significant differences in knowledge existed between the two groups. The hypothesis was therefore rejected. Findings of the study showed that the groups studied did not know the difference between the sickle cell trait and the sickle cell anemia; they were unfamiliar with the symptoms of sickle cell anemia, and they believe that people with sickle cell anemia do not live long. It was recommended on that basis of the study that massive educational programs be implemented in the community and the schools in conjunction with sickle cell screening programs and genetic counseling...|$|R
40|$|Sickle cell disease (SCD) is {{a severe}} {{autosomal}} recessive blood disorder that affects around 1 in 500 African Americans in the United States. Approximately, 1 in 12 African Americans are carriers of sickle cell trait (SCT). The high prevalence of sickle cell trait carriers {{highlights the importance}} of having education and trait testing available for individuals, particularly those, who are of childbearing age. Misconceptions and misinformation about sickle cell disease and sickle cell trait can be the reason for an individual to not be motivated to get <b>sickle</b> cell trait <b>testing.</b> This study was created to provide education to the African American community. A pre-post survey research design was used to evaluate 1) knowledge acquisition and retention among study participants who received genetic counseling in the barbershop and beauty salon; and 2) the feasibility of delivering a health education module on sickle cell disease in barbershops and salons in the African American community. As a result of this project, knowledge of sickle cell disease, concern over trait testing, and attitudes toward receiving genetic counseling in a non-clinical setting were evaluated. The data collected suggested that there was significant knowledge gain in 7 of the 9 knowledge questions administered with a p-value < 0. 05. Concern about trait testing remained low for both the pre and post questionnaires. Attitude about trait testing and genetic counseling remained high for both the pre and post questionnaires as well, resulting in an overall supportive attitude about trait testing and genetic counseling. The mean amount of knowledge gain overall knowledge questions were evaluated using a paired t-test with significance (p< 0. 05). Overall knowledge gain had a significance of (p< 0. 001). The public health relevance from {{the results of this study}} can inform development of health education materials on genetic disorders common in the African American community. Medical and public health professionals can use the insights gained from this study to provide better education and outreach to the community through non-clinical settings in the community...|$|R
2500|$|The People's Party II, a {{community}} activist organization that eventually became the Houston Chapter of the Black Panther Party was originally led by Carl Hampton - a charismatic speaker {{who organized the}} PPII at 2800 Dowling Street {{in the spring of}} 1970 to address police brutality and corruption towards Black and Brown people in the community. Hampton died after being shot without provocation by police from a top of a church on July 26, 1970. Carl Hampton's contribution to the Third Ward Community was the Rainbow Coalition that included The MAYO group - a Mexican community activist group - and The John Brown Revolutionary League, a group of White community activists. These groups worked together to bring about positive changes in their working class communities by supporting each other's [...] "survival" [...] programs. Programs included free childcare, free food giveaway, free fumigation for poor people, assisting the elderly in the community and free <b>sickle</b> cell anemia <b>testing.</b> Charles Boko Freeman became the PPII/local Black Panther Party Chairman. [...] Party activity continued until membership dropped in late 1974 and early 1975 due to constant police repression. In the 1960s and 1970s many families in the Third Ward relocated to racially integrated suburbs; racial integration allowed many Blacks to move to the suburbs, therefore the Third Ward lost some of its population with decades of neglect and economic traffic. Despite the relocations the Almeda Road commercial corridor remained busy. Kent Hadnot, {{the executive director of the}} Third Ward Redevelopment Council, said in a 2000 Houston Press article that blockbusting beginning in the 1970s began to drive homeowners and business owners away from the Third Ward and into suburbs such as Missouri City. The construction of Texas State Highway 288, which offered a quicker alternative into Downtown, caused Almeda Road's commercial properties to decline. Many children of Third Ward area business owners, educated in universities, had no desire to work in their parents' businesses, reducing the employee base of the Third Ward businesses. The 1980s oil bust hurt the economy of the Third Ward and the nearby Almeda Road commercial corridor.|$|R
40|$|Objections: In April 2010, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) {{approved}} mandatory <b>testing</b> for <b>sickle</b> cell trait {{status for}} all student athletes participating in Division I sports. Children's Sickle Cell Program at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh offered genetic testing and counseling to all student athletes participating in Division I athletes at the University of Pittsburgh and Duquesne University. Methods: In addition, {{to assess the}} knowledge of sickle cell trait among the student athletes, along with the effect of genetic counseling, student athletes were asked {{to participate in a}} survey. A short survey was provided to the student athletes prior to their genetic counseling, with a short survey provided following the genetic testing (See Appendix A for IRB consent form and Appendix B for questionnaires). Results: Between the two Division I programs at the University of Pittsburgh and Duquesne University, 122 student athletes were tested of which, one athlete was diagnosed with sickle cell trait. Among the 122 student athletes tested, 80 participated in the surveys. Among those who participated, 57 (71 %) were Caucasian, 16 (20 %) were African American, and the remaining athletes were of mixed or other ethnic backgrounds. Prior to the genetic counseling session, 11 % of the student athletes answered that they had never heard of sickle cell disease or sickle cell trait. Following the genetic counseling session, 89 % of the student athletes had a good understanding of sickle cell trait, with 15 % showing that they learned something from the genetic counseling session. Conclusions: Based on the data obtained from this study, student athletes may not have a good understanding of the testing that is mandated by the NCAA. Therefore, genetic counseling is strongly recommended to all student athletes prior to the carrier status testing. Implications for Public Health: Many issues surround the NCAA ruling mandating <b>sickle</b> cell trait <b>testing.</b> However, many are not focusing on the importance of the impact genetic testing has on an individual, particularly this age range involved. Genetic counseling needs to be considered when requiring these student athletes to undergo genetic <b>testing</b> for <b>sickle</b> cell trait...|$|R
40|$|Each year 15 - 20 {{infants with}} {{sickle cell disease}} and 600 infants with trait are born in western Pennsylvania with no {{significant}} decrease in annual incidence. A 2006 study by Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh's Comprehensive Hemoglobinopathy Program surveying African-American women in the prenatal setting found that these women have a high perception {{of the severity of}} sickle cell disease and the importance of sickle cell trait screening but a low perceived susceptibility to sickle cell disease. The current research was designed as a qualitative follow-up study to assess African-American community members' attitudes and knowledge of <b>sickle</b> cell, prenatal <b>testing,</b> and newborn screening, to characterize barriers to education and awareness of newborn screening and sickle cell, and to determine if a community-based intervention could be developed to improve awareness of these topics. Four focus groups were conducted with 35 participants at the Kingsley Association in a predominantly African-American community of Pittsburgh. Participants were recruited from the Healthy Black Family Project. Transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis and demographic information was compiled from a pre-discussion survey. Qualitative analysis has demonstrated that participants fall into one of three knowledge categories: the unaware, those with accurate but incomplete information, and those with misinformation. Participants have an understanding of sickle cell disease course. However, inheritance of sickle cell and the personal risk to have children or family members with the condition is not well understood. Participants have knowledge of the methods and indications for prenatal testing and value prenatal testing for the opportunities for choice and awareness. Risks of prenatal testing were identified as miscarriage as well as personal and family stress. Newborn screening was believed to be beneficial for preparation and treatment. Barriers to education and awareness of sickle cell and newborn screening were classified as personal, familial, and societal. The public health significance of this work is the identification of community members who are eager to decrease the prevalence of sickle cell in their community and the potential to design community discussion groups which address genetics topics and provide African-Americans with the tools to communicate with family and physicians about risk for sickle cell...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} my work {{to develop}} point-of-care diagnostic tools to measure hemoglobin concentration and diagnose sickle cell disease. In {{an effort to}} set design parameters for point-of-care hemoglobin analyzers, I assessed the variability of hemoglobin, platelet count, and {{white blood cell count}} and differential in successive drops of fingerprick blood. The average percent coefficient of variation in successive drops of fingerprick blood was up to 7 times higher than in venous controls. Fluctuations in blood parameters with increasing volume of fingerprick blood are within instrument variability for volumes equal to or greater than 60 – 100 μL. These data suggest caution when using measurements from a single drop of blood. Anemia is most common in regions of the world least able to afford effective diagnostics, and affects more than 60 % of children under five years old in much of sub-Saharan Africa. Current methods to measure hemoglobin suffer from a high per-test cost or low accuracy. This thesis describes a method to measure hemoglobin concentration by performing spectroscopy of blood spotted on paper using a custom, portable reader. I assess the accuracy using chromatography paper in a U. S. laboratory and in a Malawi hospital. I assess the accuracy using nitrocellulose paper in the laboratory and in oncology patients at Lyndon B. Johnson hospital in Houston, TX, with 89 % of samples within ± 1 g/dL of a reference standard. This method for measuring hemoglobin concentration costs <$ 0. 01 per <b>test.</b> <b>Sickle</b> cell disease is caused by a mutation in the hemoglobin molecule and leads to severe anemia, pain, and decreased immune function. It is estimated that 75. 5 % of babies with sickle cell disease are born in sub-Saharan Africa, where there are few resources to diagnose and treat the disease. Additionally, high-resource settings need a rapid diagnostic capable of identifying patients with sickle cell disease upon presentation to the emergency room. This thesis describes a new competitive lateral flow test capable of distinguishing sickle cell disease from sickle cell trait and normal blood using < 10 μL of blood from a fingerprick with 98 % accuracy (90 % sensitivity and 100 % specificity for identifying sickle cell disease) ...|$|R
