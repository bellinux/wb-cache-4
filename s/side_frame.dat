50|$|The <b>side</b> <b>frame</b> of the bogie {{was usually}} of bar construction, with simple horn guides attached, {{allowing}} the axle boxes vertical movements between them. The axle boxes had a cast-steel equaliser beam or bar resting on them. The bar had two steel coil springs placed {{on it and}} the bogie frame rested on the springs. The effect was to allow the bar {{to act as a}} compensating lever between the two axles and to use both springs to soften shocks from either axle. The bogie had a conventional bolster suspension with swing links carrying a spring plank.|$|E

However the flow does not display a single frequency, as one notices several peaks for both flows in Fig. 1. The time series of the vorticity data at indicated locations are shown in the left hand <b>side</b> <b>frames.</b> While the flow past a circular cylinder displays a single dominant peaks with side bands in the spectrum (shown on the right hand <b>side</b> <b>frames),</b> the flow inside LDC clearly demonstrates multiple peaks. This property has been explored thoroughly for the LDC in [17] to explain the roles of multiple POD modes.|$|R
50|$|The {{frame of}} the loom was cast iron. There were two <b>side</b> <b>frames</b> cast as single pieces. The three cross tails were {{machined}} for an accurate assembly. The great arched rail at the top supports the healds. The front and back cross rails bifurcate at each side to give a larger binding surface.|$|R
5000|$|A {{fail-safe}} {{cooling system}} with a dual speed electric fan was put in place, along with a coil-on-plug ignition system. Larger dual piston brake calipers {{were added to the}} front, requiring 16 inch wheels to be standard. A Watt's linkage was added to the rear suspension. Fuel lines were moved to the passenger <b>side</b> <b>frame</b> rail. A coded ignition key (known as Passive Anti-Theft System, or [...] "PATS") system was introduced and a 72 amp/hour battery replaced the previous 58. Other minor changes included a redesigned engine cover and the power steering fluid reservoir being moved {{to the front of the}} engine.|$|E
50|$|The Second Series {{ran from}} 1947 to 1972. The ejector-rod {{was longer and}} had a groove in its knurled tip; a three-inch-barrel variant was offered, with a yet longer ejector-rod. The {{cylinder}} latch was smooth, and the trigger spur serrated. The right <b>side</b> <b>frame</b> screw has no locking pin, and the rear half of the front sight is a serrated ramp. The grip panels were plastic in 1947, but were changed back to wood starting in 1955 (first with a silver-tone Colt medallion, and later a gold-tone). An optional hammer shroud was available from the factory to prevent the hammer from catching on clothing.|$|E

50|$|To {{celebrate}} 40 {{years in}} industry, Ube Industries donated this {{building to the}} city of Ube in 1937 to commemorate its founder Yūsaku Watanabe. The complex was designed around a fan shape with the backstage areas at the pinch point of the fan radiating in turn out to the stage, auditorium and entrance plaza. Six free-standing concrete finned columns (three to each <b>side)</b> <b>frame</b> the main entrance and represent each of the six affiliated companies who donated money for the building. Originally the tiles on the three concentric circles of the main façade had a salt-glazed finish in burnt carmine, but during restoration work in 1994 they were replaced with reductive fired tiles in burnt umber. The exposed concrete columns were also painted at that time.|$|E
50|$|Early in 1864, the {{commander}} of the Army of the Cumberland, Major General George H. Thomas, was seeking a light-weight, easy-to-haul and erect pontoon bridge to move his troops across unfordable rivers and streams. Knowing the limitations of the two systems used by the armies in the Western Theater, he had folding pontoons developed. A similar idea had been instigated by his predecessor William S. Rosecrans earlier in the war, but had not been adopted. Captain William E. Merrill, Thomas's chief engineer, improved on Rosecrans's prototype, making it lighter and stronger. He replaced the pins that held individual sections together with hinges so that the <b>side</b> <b>frame</b> sections folded together instead of separating. The new design yielded a portable boat that was lightweight, small enough to carry on a standard supply wagon, and easier to construct in the field. It was also strong enough to support horse-drawn artillery and fully loaded wagons.|$|E
50|$|Damon Hall stands facing east {{toward the}} {{principal}} intersection of Hartland village. It is fronted {{to the east}} by Durphy Road, which forms {{the west side of}} small triangular green with Quechee Road and Skunk Hollow Road (VT 12), with US 5 running east and south from the green's southeast corner. The hall is a 1-1/2 story masonry structure, built out of brick with concrete trim, and set on a concrete foundation. It is covered by a dormered hip roof with a modillioned cornice. The main entrance is set in the east-facing short <b>side,</b> <b>frame</b> by pilasters and Tuscan columns which support an entablature and modillioned gable. On either side are two sash windows, which have shared concrete lintels and sills. The building corners are articulated by brick piers, which rise to a band of corbelling and a stringcourse of projecting brick. The building interior is dominated by a central auditorium, with stage at the far end and balcony at the near end. Town offices are housed in corner rooms on the second floor, with additional rooms behind the stage on both floors.|$|E

50|$|Bronck Farm 13-Sided Barn is a {{historic}} barn located at Coxsackie in Greene County, New York. It was built about 1832 and is a 13 <b>sided</b> <b>frame</b> structure with a hipped roof surmounted by an octagonal cupola. It has an overall diameter of 70 feet and the one story interior is open in plan. It is related to, but listed separately from the Bronck House.|$|R
50|$|The {{two members}} of the ABDeh 6/6 class each had a pair of {{passenger}} car bodies connected together, and three twin axle bogies. Each body was mounted, at its outer end, on an outer bogie, via two <b>side</b> <b>frames.</b> At each body's other end, that body was connected, in combination with the other body, to a central Jacobs bogie, in each case via a central pedestal.|$|R
50|$|The {{bolster plate}} {{is mounted on}} top of the press bed and is a large block of metal upon which the bottom portion of a die is clamped; the bolster plate is stationary. Large presses (like the ones used in the {{automotive}} industry) may be equipped die cushions integrated in the bolster plate to apply blank holder or counter draw forces. This is necessary when a single acting press is used for deep drawing. The ram / slide is the moving or reciprocating member that the upper die is mounted to. Ram or Slide guidance is a critical element to assure long die life between die maintenance. Different types of slide guides are available, 4 point V-Gibs or 6 point square gibs on smaller presses and 8 point full length slide guides on larger straight <b>side</b> <b>frame</b> presses. With the dies and material be fed into the die between the bolster and slide, good press designs must account for plastic deformation, other wise known as defection when frame design and loads are considered.|$|E
50|$|Modern era supermodifieds run {{a radical}} offset chassis {{that is up}} to 18 in. {{to the left of}} center. The engine and {{driveline}} components themselves are mounted in a specially-fabricated area placed outside the left <b>side</b> <b>frame</b> rails. The engine is thus a stressed member of the chassis. This allows weight distribution to favor the left side (often as much as 70%) and thereby aid cornering around the left-hand turns of an oval track. The giant wings, (generally 24 sq ft' max), mounted on the roll cage of the cars bear a resemblance to those found on sprint cars and serve a similar purpose, designed to produce down force and allow them to make tight turns at high speed. The west coast style cars of ERA and SMRA run a fixed wing, whereas the cars of the east generally run a wing mounted to the suspension or chassis by pneumatic struts. The racing slick tires used on a supermodified are among the widest used in pavement oval racing.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{contains}} {{results of}} a comprehensive research and development programme aimed at an evaluation of static strength of a GRP railway bogie of a new advanced design. The works were carried out {{as one of the}} essential phases of the implementation of a EUREKA project EUROBOGIE, which is aimed at development of advanced vehicle bogies and has a great potential to lead to more efficient movement of freight and passengers with lower environmental impact. The GRP bogie design consists of three main load carrying parts, namely two quite massive longitudinal <b>side</b> <b>frames</b> connected by a central transom plate which are manufactured in a single moulding operation using the resin transfer moulding (RTM) method. Since the component is unusually thick, all parameters of the RTM method have to be well balanced. One of the critical issues in the design and manufacture is the connection area of the transom with the <b>side</b> <b>frames.</b> Therefore, testing of this subcomponent was {{an important part of the}} bogie development. Results of the experimental programme provided necessary feedback for the optimization of the manufacture technology...|$|R
