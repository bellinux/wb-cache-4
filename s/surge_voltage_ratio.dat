40|$|Abstract: Random {{wound stator}} {{windings}} in motors, operating in utility and industrial plants, {{have been reported}} to suffer from premature failures. Although several failure mechanisms exist, dissection of failed stators show some of these failures have been caused by exposure to fast rise-time <b>voltage</b> <b>surges</b> coming from inverter drives. Partial discharges may occur between turns during fast rise-time <b>voltage</b> <b>surges.</b> Previously, the relationship between Discharge Inception Voltage (DIV) and rise-time has been characterized for magnet wire insulation samples and stators of various designs under laboratory conditions. As well, DIV and surge environment measurements performed in the field on motors suspected to exhibit stator winding problems related to <b>surge</b> <b>voltages</b> have been carried out. In this paper, the influence of ambient humidity on DIV for a magnet wire insulation sample is studied. The results are discussed in relation to DIV curves obtained on stators with confirmed problems in regards to withstanding the <b>surge</b> <b>voltage</b> environment applied during normal operation. The paper presents and discusses the results of the experiments and does not attempt to put forward a theoretical model for discharge behaviour under surge conditions in random wound stators...|$|R
40|$|<b>Surge</b> <b>voltage</b> {{distribution}} {{across a}} power transformer winding due to appearance of very fast rise transient overvoltages (VFTO) such as lightning surges consists of high voltage oscillations and the voltage distribution {{along the length}} of the winding can be highly non-uniform. In order to make the voltage distribution more uniform {{along the length of}} winding under these conditions, a method has been explored as an alternate to the conventional methods that are being used presently. This method consists of providing suitably designed metal oxide varistors (metal oxide surge absorbers) across sections of winding. The voltage - current characteristic of metal oxide varistor (MOV) is given by V = KIβ, where K and β are the constants of MOV. Experimental investigations have been carried out on a transformer model winding with MOVs provided across fifty percent and hundred percent of winding length to investigate <b>surge</b> <b>voltage</b> performance of these types of windings for appearance of lightning overvoltage (full impulse voltages) at line terminal of the model winding. Transformer windings with α values 5. 6, 11. 8 and 18. 9 have been analyzed. The oscillographic records obtained with presence of identical MOVs (MOVs having similar characteristic constants K and β) or non-identical MOVs (MOVs having different K value and similar β) across transformer winding sections show appreciable reduction in <b>surge</b> <b>voltages</b> across sections of winding as compared to that obtained without MOVs...|$|R
