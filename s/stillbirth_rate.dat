40|$|This paper {{considers}} a largely unknown public-health {{practice in the}} United States: the use of lead pipes to distribute household tap water. Municipalities first installed lead pipes during the late nineteenth century. In 1897, {{about half of all}} American municipalities used lead water pipes. Using data from 1900 Massachusetts, this paper compares infant death <b>rates</b> and <b>stillbirth</b> <b>rates</b> in cities that used lead water pipes to rates in cities that used non-lead pipes. In the average town in 1900, the use of lead pipes increased infant mortality and <b>stillbirth</b> <b>rates</b> by 25 to 50 percent. However, the effects of lead water lines varied across cities, and depended on the age of the pipe and the corrosiveness of the associated water supplies. Age of pipe influenced lead content because, over time, oxidation formed a protective coating on the interior of pipes. As for corrosiveness, acidic water removed more lead from the interior of pipes than did non-acidic water. Consequently, infant death <b>rates</b> and <b>stillbirth</b> <b>rates</b> in Massachusetts towns employing old lead lines, and non-acidic water supplies, were no higher than in towns employing non-lead pipes. But in cities using new pipes and distributing acidic water, lead pipes increased infant mortality <b>rates</b> and <b>stillbirth</b> <b>rates</b> three- to fourfold. ...|$|R

5000|$|The modern brachycephalic Persian {{has a large}} rounded {{skull and}} {{shortened}} face and nose. This facial conformation makes the breed prone to breathing difficulties, skin and eye problems and birthing difficulties. Anatomical abnormalities associated with brachycephalic breeds can cause shortness of breath. Malformed tear ducts causes epiphora, an overflow of tears onto the face, which is common but primarily cosmetic. It {{can be caused by}} other more serious conditions though. Entropion, the inward folding of the eyelids, causes the eyelashes to rub against the cornea, and can lead to tearing, pain, infection and cornea damage.

Access to basic neonatal resuscitation to 90 % off newborns is suggested to prevent 192 000 deaths per year alone. The aim of this assignment is to summarize the literature from low- and middle income countries which evaluate the effect of learning programs in neonatal resuscitation on mortality. Methods: Studies was identified by search in Ovid Medline and by reading reference list of existing reviews on the topic. Result: Eleven studies were found. Ten were before and after intervention studies and one was a RCT. All measure the effect of either Helping Babies Breath (HBB), Essential Newborn Care (ENC) or Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP). Ten of 11 showed reduction in mortality or <b>stillbirth</b> <b>rate.</b> Both HBB, ENC and NRP had effect on mortality in some studies.

Relations between obstetric care, particularly intrapartum interventions and perinatal outcomes, are less well understood, however. OBJECTIVE: To investigate effects of obstetric, paediatric, and demographic factors on <b>rates</b> of hospital <b>stillbirths</b> and neonatal mortality. METHODS: Cross sectional data on all 65 maternity units in all Thames Regions, 1994 - 1996, covering 540 834 live births and stillbirths. Hospital level analyses investigated associations between staffing rates (consultant/junior paediatricians, consultant/junior obstetricians, midwives), facilities (consultant obstetrician/anaesthetist sessions, delivery beds, special care baby unit, neonatal intensive care unit cots, etc), interventions (vaginal births, caesarean sections, forceps, epidurals, inductions, general anaesthetic), parental data (parity, maternal age, social class, deprivation, multiple births), and birthweight standardised <b>stillbirth</b> <b>rates</b> and neonatal mortality. RESULTS: Unifactorial analyses showed consistent negative associations between measures of obstetric intervention and <b>stillbirth</b> <b>rates.</b> Some measures of staffing, facilities, and parental data also showed significant associations. Scores for interventional, organisational, and parental variables were derived for multifactorial analysis to overcome the statistical problems caused by high intercorrelations between variables.

Patients and methodsData from vital registrations during the time period from January 1, 2001 through to December 31, 2004 in Taiwan were used. Stillbirth was defined as fetal death with more than 20 completed weeks’ gestational age (GA) or with birth weight more than 500  g if the GA was not known. ResultsThere were a total of 8481 stillbirths identified nationwide between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2004. The <b>stillbirth</b> <b>rate</b> was nine per 1000 total births in the study period, and the proportionate decline was nearly 48. 8 % in the most recent decade.

40|$|The {{experiment}} involved {{observations of}} 2, 514 Holstein-Friesian cows {{to determine the}} effects of environmental factors (cow’s age, calving season, weight and sex of calves, housing system) and genetic factors on gestation length in dairy cattle and the correlation between gestation length and other reproductive traits (calving ease, <b>stillbirth</b> <b>rates</b> and placental expulsion). Genetic parameters were estimated based on the sires of calved cows (indirect effect) and the sires of live-born calves (direct effect). The following factors were found to contribute to prolonged gestation: increasing cow’s age, male fetuses and growing fetus weight. Optimal gestation length was determined in the range of 275 – 277 days based on calving ease and <b>stillbirth</b> <b>rates.</b> The heritability of gestation length was estimated at 0. 201 – 0. 210 by the direct effect and 0. 055 – 0. 073 by the indirect effect.

A similar pattern was observed in <b>stillbirth</b> <b>rates.</b> CONCLUSIONS [...] Restriction of oxygen in sick newborn infants cannot be the sole cause of the interruption in fall of first day neonatal mortality as <b>stillbirth</b> <b>rates</b> were also affected. The timing of onset and {{the course of the}} deviation is not consistent with the oxygen restriction hypothesis. Further investigation is needed to identify a factor affecting both fetal and newborn survival between 1950 and 1980...|$|R
50|$|Worldwide in 2015 {{there were}} about 2.6 million {{stillbirths}} that occurred after 28 weeks of pregnancy (about 1 for every 45 births). They occur most commonly in the developing world, particularly South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. In the United States for every 167 births there is one <b>stillbirth.</b> <b>Rates</b> of <b>stillbirth</b> in the United States have decreased by about 2/3rds since the 1950s.|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims: Stillbirth {{is one of}} {{the most}} common adverse {{outcomes}} of pregnancy, accounting for half of all perinatal mortality. Each year approximately 4 million stillbirths are reported, with 97 % occurring in developing countries. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the <b>stillbirth</b> <b>rate,</b> exploring the risk factors and causes of stillbirth and suggest policies to reduce it. Settings and Design: A retrospective study of stillbirth among all deliveries over 5 years at North Bengal Medical College, a referral tertiary care teaching hospital in a rural background. The <b>stillbirth</b> <b>rate</b> and its trend were defined and the probable causes and risk factors were identified. Results: <b>Stillbirth</b> <b>rate</b> is 59. 76 / 1000 live births, and Perinatal Mortality 98. 65 / 1000 births. Of the still births, 59. 72 % were fresh and 40. 27 % were macerated. Among the causes of stillbirths, poor antenatal attendance and low socioeconomic status were important; other risk factors included prematurity, PIH, birth asphyxia, poor intrapartum care including prolonged and obstructed labour. In 23 % cases, the cause remained unexplained. Conclusion: In addition to poor antenatal care, low socioeconomic condition, poor referral service, suboptimal intrapartum care in health facilities including tertiary centre were mainly responsible for majority of still births which could have been prevented. We speculate that upgrading the existing health system performance, particularly high quality intrapartum care by skilled health personnel, will reduce stillbirths substantially in our institut...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. This study aims to {{identify}} triggers of stillbirth {{in the study}} setting and to make suggestions to reduce the prevalence. Method. A three-year retrospective case-control study of stillbirths at Ekiti State University Teaching Hospital. Results. The <b>stillbirth</b> <b>rate</b> was 33 per 1000 births. Based on Baird-Pattinson classification of the primary obstetric causes of stillbirth, adverse intrapartum events, hypertensive diseases, and unexplained intrapartum fetal deaths were topmost causes of stillbirths. In comparison with the controls, other identified predictors of SB were grand multiparity (p = 0. 016), delays in seeking medical care and/or in receiving treatment (p = 0. 0001), wrong initial diagnosis (p = 0. 0001), inadequate intrapartum monitoring (p = 0. 0001), and inappropriate clinical management (p = 0. 0001). Conclusion. <b>Stillbirth</b> <b>rate</b> remains high in our setting. Elimination of obstacles to accessing care, effective management of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, updated health facilities, improved dedication to duty, and retraining of health workers will reduce the prevalence...|$|E
40|$|It is {{estimated}} that everyday 7000 women worldwide have their pregnancy end with a stillbirth, however, research and data collection on stillbirth remains underfunded. This stillbirth case series audit investigates an apparent rise in stillbirths at a Sydney tertiary referral hospital in Australia. A retrospective case series of singleton stillbirths from 2005 - 2010 was conducted at Westmead Hospital. Stillbirth was defined as per the Perinatal Society of Australia and New Zealand classification as a death of a baby before or during birth, from the 20 th week of pregnancy onwards, or a birth weight of 400 grams or more if gestational age is unknown. A total of 215 singleton stillbirths were identified in a cohort of 28 109, a rate of 7. 6 per 1000 singleton births. There was {{a significant increase in}} annual <b>stillbirth</b> <b>rate</b> at our institution; the rate exceeded both Australian national and state singleton stillbirth rates. After pregnancy terminations over 20 weeks were excluded from the data, there was no statistical change in the <b>stillbirth</b> <b>rate</b> over time. Congenital anomalies (27 %) and unexplained antepartum death (15 %) remained as major causes; fetal growth restriction (17 %) was also identified as an increasingly important cause, particularly in preterm gestations. Termination of pregnancy after 20 weeks was found to be the cause of rising <b>stillbirth</b> <b>rate</b> at our institution. Local and national data collection on stillbirth should be standardised and should include differentiation of termination of pregnancy as a separate entity so as to accurately assess stillbirth to target appropriate research and resource allocation...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAbstractBackgroundPrevious {{studies have}} shown that {{socioeconomic}} position is inversely associated with stillbirth risk, but the impact on national rates in Europe is not known. We aimed to assess the magnitude of social inequalities in <b>stillbirth</b> <b>rates</b> in European countries using indicators generated from routine monitoring systems. MethodsAggregated data on the number of stillbirths and live births for the year 2010 were collected for three socioeconomic indicators (mothers’ educational level, mothers’ and fathers’ occupational group) from 29 European countries participating in the Euro-Peristat project. Educational categories were coded using the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) and analysed as: primary/lower secondary, upper secondary and postsecondary. Parents’ occupations were grouped using International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO- 08) major groups and then coded into 4 categories: No occupation or student, Skilled/ unskilled workers, Technicians/clerical/service occupations and Managers/professionals. We calculated risk ratios (RR) for stillbirth by each occupational group as well as the percentage population attributable risks using the most advantaged category as the reference (post-secondary education and professional/managerial occupations). ResultsData on <b>stillbirth</b> <b>rates</b> by mothers’ education were available in 19 countries and by mothers’ and fathers’ occupations in 13 countries. In countries with these data, the median RR of stillbirth for women with primary and lower secondary education compared to women with postsecondary education was 1. 9 (interquartile range (IQR) : 1. 5 to 2. 4) and 1. 4 (IQR: 1. 2 to 1. 6), respectively. For mothers’ occupations, the median RR comparing outcomes among manual workers with managers and professionals was 1. 6 (IQR: 1. 0 – 2. 1) whereas for fathers’ occupations, the median RR was 1. 4 (IQR: 1. 2 – 1. 8). When applied to the entire set of countries with data about mothers’ education, 1606 out of 6337 stillbirths (25  %) would not have occurred if <b>stillbirth</b> <b>rates</b> for all women were the same as for women with post-secondary education in their country. ConclusionsData on stillbirths and socioeconomic status from routine systems showed widespread and consistent socioeconomic inequalities in <b>stillbirth</b> <b>rates</b> in Europe. Further research is needed to better understand differences between countries in the magnitude of the socioeconomic gradient...|$|R
50|$|Abbreviated Summary: Crossbred cows were {{significantly}} below Holstein sired cows for 305-d EBV for milk yield, but were above Holstein for fat and protein yields. Crossbred cows and heifers became pregnant sooner after each calving, had higher non-return rates, fewer services, and shorter gestation lengths than purebred Holsteins. Crossbred heifers and cows had lower <b>stillbirth</b> <b>rates</b> due to having smaller calves and slightly better calving ease.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} population-based <b>stillbirth</b> <b>rates</b> and {{to determine}} whether the timing and maturity of the stillbirths suggest a high proportion of potentially preventable deaths. Design: Prospective observational study. Setting: Communities in six low-income countries (Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Zambia, Guatemala, India, and Pakistan) and one site in a mid-income country (Argentina). Population. Pregnant women residing in the study communities. Methods: Over a five-year period, in selected catchment areas, using multiple methodologies, trained study staff obtained pregnancy outcomes on each delivery in their area. Main outcome measures. Pregnancy outcome, stillbirth characteristics. Results: Outcomes of 195 400 deliveries were included. <b>Stillbirth</b> <b>rates</b> ranged from 32 per 1 000 in Pakistan to 8 per 1 000 births in Argentina. Three-fourths (76 %) of stillbirth offspring were not macerated, 63 % were = 37 weeks and 48 % weighed 2 500 g or more. Across all sites, women with no education, of high and low parity, of older age, and without access to antenatal care were at significantly greater risk for stillbirth (...|$|R
