Surveillance for Rotavirus Infections in Hospitalized Kids (<b>SHRIK)</b> is a European prospective observational study conducted to assess the burden related to Rotavirus gastroenteritis (RVGE) in these children. METHODS: Patients less than 5 years visiting emergency rooms for AGE (U-AGE), who were hospitalized (H-AGE) or who developed RVGE 48 hours after hospitalization (N-AGE) {{were included in the}} study over a year. A stool sample was collected for every child and analyzed by ELISA. RESULTS: Results are presented for patients enrolled in France. A total of 755 eligible patients with AGE were included (357 for U-AGE, 372 for H-AGE and 26 for N-AGE). Among them, the proportion of RVGE was 49. 1 % (n= 114) for U-AGE and 64. 4 % (n= 186) for H-AGE. Most cases of RVGE (89 %) involved children less than 2 years. GERV were frequently more severe than GEA non related to Rotavirus (NRVGE), according to the Vesikari scale, (68. 4 % against 41. 9 %, P< 0. 0001). Oral rehydration was performed for nearly 50 % of RVGE patients before coming to hospital, versus 36. 2 % for NRVGE (P< 0. 002). All RV-positive strains were genotyped: the most frequent strains were G 1 P[8] (U-AGE, 42 %; H-AGE, 46 %) and G 9 P[8] (U-AGE, 38 %; H-AGE, 31 %). CONCLUSION: <b>SHRIK</b> study followed up all GEA visiting emergency room or requiring hospitalization for one year and showed that the burden of Rotavirus disease is high with a ratio over 70 % of all hospital GEA during the winter peak...|$|E
