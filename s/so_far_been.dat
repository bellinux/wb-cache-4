5|$|As {{the sole}} viral protein {{on the surface}} of the virus, the Envelope protein is a major target for HIV vaccine efforts. Over half of the mass of the trimeric {{envelope}} spike is N-linked glycans. The density is high as the glycans shield the underlying viral protein from neutralisation by antibodies. This is one of the most densely glycosylated molecules known and the density is sufficiently high to prevent the normal maturation process of glycans during biogenesis in the endoplasmic and Golgi apparatus. The majority of the glycans are therefore stalled as immature 'high-mannose' glycans not normally present on secreted or cell surface human glycoproteins. The unusual processing and high density means that almost all broadly neutralising antibodies that have <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>been</b> identified (from a subset of patients that have been infected for many months to years) bind to or, are adapted to cope with, these envelope glycans.|$|E

5|$|Fossil {{tracks are}} rare and no burrows under the sea-floor have <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>been</b> {{found in the}} Burgess Shale. These {{absences}} {{have been used to}} support the idea that the water near the sea-floor was anoxic. However {{it is possible that the}} water just above the sea-floor was oxygenated while the water in the sediment below it was anoxic, and also possible that there simply were no deep-burrowing animals in the Burgess Shale. Some fossils, such as Marrella, are almost always the right way up, which suggests they were not transported far if at all. Others, such as Wiwaxia, are often at odd angles, and some fossils of animals with shelly or toughened components very rarely contain remains of soft tissues. This suggests that the distances over which corpses were transported may have varied between genera, although most were buried where they had lived.|$|E
5|$|The French squadron, {{commanded}} by Contre-amiral Pierre César Charles de Sercey, had left their base on Île de France in July, cruising off Ceylon and Tranquebar before sailing eastwards.

After raiding the shipping at Banda Aceh on 1 September the squadron sailed eastwards to attack Penang. On 8 September, while the French were removing supplies from a captured British merchant ship east of Banda Aceh, two large sails were spotted. These were HMS Arrogant and HMS Victorious, sent to drive off the French before they could attack the scattered British shipping and ports in the region.|$|E
5|$|The {{station has}} two {{entrance}}s and exits. The main station entrance and ventilation building {{consists of four}} escalators and an elevator {{on the west side}} of Hudson Boulevard between 33rd and 34th Streets.

The elevator is located south of 34th Street in Hudson Park, while the escalator entrance is located further east, closer to the boulevard. At the time of construction, the ventilation building was designed so developers could built on top of it later.

5|$|Back in England, {{early in}} 1262, Edward fell {{out with some}} of his former Lusignan allies over {{financial}} matters. The next year, King Henry sent him on a campaign in Wales against Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, with only limited results. Around the same time, Simon de Montfort, who had been out of the country since 1261, returned to England and reignited the baronial reform movement. It was at this pivotal moment, as the King seemed ready to resign to the barons' demands, that Edward began {{to take control of the}} situation. Whereas he had <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>been</b> unpredictable and equivocating, from this point on he remained firmly devoted to protecting his father's royal rights. He reunited with some of the men he had alienated the year before – among them his childhood friend, Henry of Almain, and John de Warenne, Earl of Surrey – and retook Windsor Castle from the rebels. Through the arbitration of King LouisIX of France, an agreement was made between the two parties. This so-called Mise of Amiens was largely favourable to the royalist side, and laid the seeds for further conflict.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before its}} closure, there was {{interest}} in retaining the canal for its amenity value. The Stroudwater Canal Society, which {{later became the}} Cotswold Canals Trust, was formed in 1972. Following initial hostility from the Proprietors, {{who had not been}} stripped of their powers when the canal had closed, agreement was reached and work began on restoration of the waterway. The project gained popularity, and in 2003, a bid was made to the Heritage Lottery Fund for £82 million to restore both the Stroudwater Navigation and the Thames and Severn Canal. The project had to be split into smaller parts, and only the first phase has <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>been</b> funded in this way, when a grant of £11.9 million was confirmed in 2006. With match funding, this was to enable the section from 'The Ocean' at Stonehouse to Wallbridge to be reopened, together with the Wallbridge to Brimscombe Port section of the Thames and Severn.|$|E

Ben Roberts-Smith was awarded the Victoria Cross for Australia on 23 January 2011 for actions in the Shah Wali Kot Offensive, part of the War in Afghanistan. Daniel Keighran was awarded the Victoria Cross for Australia on 1 November 2012 for his actions during the Battle of Derapet in Oruzgan Province, Afghanistan, on 24 August 2010. A posthumous award was made to Corporal Cameron Baird for actions in Afghanistan in 2013. A Canadian version has been cast that was originally to be awarded to the Unknown Soldier at the rededication of the Vimy Memorial on 7 April 2007.

5|$|The CFL re-gained {{relative}} {{stability in the}} 2000s, mostly thanks to enforcement of a salary cap, stricter standards of ownership, and increasingly lucrative television contracts negotiated with Canadian networks. The league has remained solely focused on its Canadian operations, with expansion efforts focused on returning a stable team to Ottawa. The first attempt at a replacement for the Rough Riders, the Ottawa Renegades, played from 2002 to 2005; in its last season, despite league resistance but without any other buyers, the Gliebermans purchased the franchise, then gave {{it back to the}} league, which suspended it prior to the 2006 season. After an extended delay due to stadium problems in Ottawa, the Ottawa Redblacks, who own the Rough Riders' history and trademarks, launched in 2014 and have <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>been</b> a success under the ownership of Jeff Hunt's consortium. Further expansion has been limited to one-off games such as Touchdown Atlantic and Northern Kickoff in more distant Canadian markets.|$|E
5|$|The {{virus has}} been {{identified}} in the pulmonary nodules of African elephants {{as far back as}} the 1970s. The first recognised fatal case of EEHV in an Asian elephant was identified at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., in 1995; testing on stored tissue samples was able to identify a number of earlier deaths as being due to the same virus. These cases have <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>been</b> identified as early as 1983. Since this date, there have been a total of 54 more cases in North America and Europe, nine of which were successfully treated. The May 2009 deaths of two calves at Whipsnade Zoo were not included in this calculation. This gives a fatality rate of over 80% among known symptomatic disease cases. In cases where antiviral medication was applied, treatment was effective in about one in three cases. As of 2005, there were twelve cases where famciclovir had been used, eight of which were fatal. As a fraction of the overall population, it has been calculated that of the 78 Asian elephants born in captivity in North America between 1978 and 2007, 19 are known to have died of EEHV, and five more were successfully treated with antiviral medication.|$|E
5|$|During Roman times, Volubilis {{was a major}} {{producer}} of olive oil. The remains of buildings dedicated to olive pressing are still readily visible, as are {{the remains of the}} original presses and olive mills. One such building has been reconstructed with a full-size replica of a Roman olive press. Olive oil was central {{to the life of the}} city, as it was not just a foodstuff but was also used for lamps, bathing and medicines, while the pressed olives were fed to animals or dried out and used as fuel for the bathhouses. For this reason, even some of the grandest mansions had their own olive presses. Fifty-eight oil-pressing complexes have <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>been</b> discovered in Volubilis. They housed a standard set of elements: a mill, used to crush the olives, a decantation basin to catch the oil from pressed olives, and a press that comprised a counterweight, a prelum or cross-bar and the wooden supports within which the prelum was fixed. The olives were first crushed into a paste, then put into woven baskets that were subjected to pressing. The olive oil ran out into the decantation basin, to which water was periodically added to make the lighter oil float to the surface. This was then scooped out of the basin and poured into amphorae. There is also substantial evidence of the city being a lively commercial centre. No fewer than 121 shops have been identified so far, many of them bakeries, and judging from the number of bronzes found at the site it may also have been a centre for the production or distribution of bronze artworks.|$|E
