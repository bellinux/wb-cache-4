40|$|An {{extensive}} two- and three-dimensional {{analysis of}} air flow in a POLARIS ® 2200 Microlithography Cluster spin coater was conducted using FLuENTTM Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software. To supplement this analysis, direct measurement of air flow velocity was also performed using a Dantec ® Hot Wire Anemometer. Velocity measurements were made along two major planes {{across the entire}} flow field in the spin coater at various operating conditions. {{it was found that}} the flow velocity at the spin coater inlet is much lower than previously assumed and quite nonuniform. Based on this observation, a pressure boundary condition rather than a velocity boundary condition was used for subsequent CFD analysis. A comparison between calculated results and experimental data shows that the 3 D model accurately predicts the air flow field in the spin coaler. An added advantage of this approach is that the CFD model can be easily generated from the mechanical design database and used to analyze the effect of design changes. The modeled and measured results show that the flow pattern in the spin bowl is affected by interactions between the spinning wafer, exhaust flow, and the gap between the <b>spin</b> <b>head</b> and surrounding baffle. Different operating conditions such as spin speed, inlet pressure, and exhaust pressure were found to generate substantially different flow patterns. It was also found that backflow of air could be generated under certain conditions...|$|E

50|$|Cotton candy, {{also known}} as Candy Floss, {{is a form of}} spun sugar. Typical {{machines}} used to make cotton candy include a <b>spinning</b> <b>head</b> enclosing a small bowl into which granulated sugar is poured. Colored sugar or separate sugar and food coloring are used to provide color. Heaters near the rim of the head melt the sugar, which is squeezed out through tiny holes by centrifugal force, and the molten sugar solidifies in the air and is caught in a larger bowl which totally surrounds the <b>spinning</b> <b>head.</b> After the product builds up on the inside walls of the larger bowl, a stick, cone, or hands are inserted, upon which the sugar strands are gathered.|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} is to create the {{fundamental}} knowledge needed to develop more efficient machines and novel processes that can potentially decrease the number of process steps {{by a factor of}} 2 to 3 in short staple yarn manufacturing. Currently, the process sequence for short staple yarn manufacturing involves about ten individual steps. To develop more efficient machines and novel processes that can significantly shorten the processing line, we are currently conducting research in the following two interrelated areas: (1) To analyze the motion dynamics of fiber clumps and particles in an airflow field, especially the effect of flow pattern and barrier arrangements on fiber opening, trash removal, self-leveling, nep formation, and fiber loss in opening, cleaning and carding; and (2) To develop a single-step process (Card-Spinning) to incorporate multiple <b>spinning</b> <b>heads</b> into a carding unit. This will require a fundamental analysis and understanding of web uniformity monitoring, measurement, and regulation, web division, and feeding of web ribbons into yarn <b>spinning</b> <b>heads</b> positioned at {{the front end of the}} card. Since the start of the project in May 1998, we have conducted a state-of-the-art literature survey on airflow in yarn processing, card web uniformity monitoring and control, fiber web transport, and high speed yarn spinning. Literature on current processing machinery has also been studied. We have met with industrial partners to discuss the interactions necessary to make the project successful. Studies are underway on experimental and theoretical analysis of air flow, web uniformity detection, and <b>spinning</b> <b>head</b> design...|$|R
50|$|A {{recurring}} {{problem with}} the format was damage to the videotape caused by prolonged friction of the <b>spinning</b> video drum <b>heads</b> against a paused videotape. The drum would rub oxide off the tape or the tape would wrinkle; when the damaged tape was played back, a horizontal line of distorted visual image would ascend in the frame, and audio would drop out. Manufacturers attempted to minimise this issue with schemes in which the tape would loosen around the <b>spinning</b> <b>head</b> or the <b>head</b> would stop <b>spinning</b> after resting in pause mode for a pre-determined period of time.|$|R

Power moves comprise full-body spins and rotations that give the illusion of defying gravity.

These Power moves are acrobatic moves that require momentum, speed, endurance, strength, and control to execute. The breaker is generally supported by his upper body while the rest of his body creates circular momentum. Some examples are the windmill, swipe, back <b>spin,</b> and <b>head</b> <b>spin.</b> Some power moves are borrowed from gymnastics and martial arts.|$|R

50|$|The molten sugar solidifies {{in the air}} and {{is caught}} in a larger bowl which totally {{surrounds}} the <b>spinning</b> <b>head.</b> Left to operate for a period, the cotton-like product builds up on the inside walls of the larger bowl, at which point machine operators twirl a stick or cone, around the rim of the large catching bowl, gathering the sugar strands into portions which are served on stick or cone, or in plastic bags. As the sugar reserve bowl empties, the operator recharges it with more feedstock. The product is sensitive to humidity, and in humid summer locales, the process can be messy and sticky.|$|R
