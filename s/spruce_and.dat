5|$|Hygrophorus olivaceoalbus creates mycorrhizae with conifers. In the West Coast of the United States, {{associations}} are most common with Sitka spruces and giant redwoods. In the Rocky Mountains it associates with Engelmann <b>spruce</b> <b>and</b> blue <b>spruce,</b> <b>and</b> in northeast North America with hemlocks. It usually favours acidic and chalky ground with mosses in higher altitudes {{as well as}} conifer forests and occasionally mixed forests. The fruit bodies are often found singly, but may also grow in clusters.|$|E
5|$|Coniferous trees such {{as black}} spruce, white <b>spruce,</b> <b>and</b> balsam fir {{dominate}} the native vegetation. The largest deciduous tree is white birch; species of lesser stature include alder, cherry and mountain ash. Of introduced tree species, sycamore maple is most abundant and Norway maple is common. Blue spruce, common horsechestnut, European beech and littleleaf linden {{are among the}} other non-native species grown.|$|E
5|$|The forested {{sections}} {{fall into}} three major climatic zones. The west and northwest {{are dominated by}} <b>spruce</b> <b>and</b> fir and the southwest by redcedar and hemlock; the areas east of the Continental Divide are a combination of mixed pine, spruce, fir and prairie zones. The cedar-hemlock groves along the Lake McDonald valley are the easternmost examples of this Pacific climatic ecosystem.|$|E

5|$|In {{the summer}} the {{fieldfare}} frequents mixed woodland of birch, alder, pine, <b>spruce</b> <b>and</b> fir, often near marshes, moorland or other open ground. It does not avoid {{the vicinity of}} humans and {{can be seen in}} cultivated areas, orchards, parks and gardens. It also inhabits open tundra and the slopes of hills above the tree line. In the winter, groups of fieldfares are chiefly found in open country, agricultural land, orchards and open woodland. They are nomadic, wandering wherever there is an abundance of berries and insects. Later in the year they move on to pastureland and cultivated fields.|$|E
5|$|Plants {{and animals}} include those {{generally}} common to Central Europe. Beeches, oaks, and other deciduous trees constitute {{one-third of the}} forests; conifers are increasing {{as a result of}} reforestation. <b>Spruce</b> <b>and</b> fir trees predominate in the upper mountains, while pine and larch are found in sandy soil. There are many species of ferns, flowers, fungi, and mosses. Wild animals include roe deer, wild boar, mouflon (a subspecies of wild sheep), fox, badger, hare, and small numbers of the Eurasian beaver. The blue cornflower was once a German national symbol.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{treecreeper}} is {{the most}} widespread member of its genus, breeding in temperate woodlands across Eurasia from Ireland to Japan. It prefers mature trees, and in most of Europe, where it shares its range with short-toed treecreeper, {{it tends to be}} found mainly in coniferous forest, especially <b>spruce</b> <b>and</b> fir. However, where it is the only treecreeper, as in European Russia, or the British Isles, it frequents broadleaved or mixed woodland in preference to conifers.|$|E

5|$|The lower {{areas of}} the {{wilderness}} area are covered by a taiga forest of Scots pine. Less common trees include downy birch, goat willow, aspen and rowan. Logging {{in the past has}} mostly occurred in the southern part ("Kessi"), a large proportion of Vätsäri's forests being old-growth forests. The barren soil makes for poor growth conditions and most of the ground vegetation in the forests is subshrubs. One area with limestone rock features green spleenwort. The reserve is located in an area between a western and eastern vegetation zones, giving rise to unique combinations of species, such as Siberian <b>spruce</b> <b>and</b> red cottongrass.|$|E
5|$|Wind also limits tree growth. On coasts and {{isolated}} mountains, {{the tree line}} is often much lower than in corresponding altitudes inland and in larger, more complex mountain systems, because strong winds reduce tree growth. High winds scour away thin soils through erosion, as well as damage limbs and twigs. When high winds knock down or uproot trees, the process is known as windthrow. This is most likely on windward slopes of mountains, with severe cases generally occurring to tree stands that are 75years or older. Plant varieties near the coast, such as the Sitka <b>spruce</b> <b>and</b> sea grape, are pruned back by wind and salt spray near the coastline.|$|E
5|$|Barbeyella minutissima is a slime mould {{species of}} the order Echinosteliales, and the only {{species of the}} genus Barbeyella. First {{described}} in 1914 from the Jura mountains, its habitat is restricted to montane <b>spruce</b> <b>and</b> spruce-fir forests of the Northern Hemisphere, {{where it has been}} recorded from Asia, Europe, and North America. It typically colonises slimy, algae-covered logs that have lost their bark and have been partially to completely covered by liverworts. The sporangia are roughly spherical, up to 0.2mm in diameter, and supported by a thin stalk up to 0.7mm tall. After the spores have developed, the walls of the sporangia split open into lobes. The species is one of the smallest members of the Myxogastria and is considered rare.|$|E

40|$|The use {{of remote}} sensing to discriminate, measure, and map forest damage is evaluated. TM spectal coverage, a helicopter-mounted radiometer, and {{ground-based}} surveys were utilized {{to examine the}} responses of the <b>spruces</b> <b>and</b> firs of Camels Hump Mountain, Vermont to stresses, such as pollution and trace metals. The basic spectral properties of vegetation are described. Forest damage at the site was estimated as 11. 8 - 76. 0 percent for the <b>spruces</b> <b>and</b> 19 - 43. 8 percent for the balsam firs. Shifts in the spectra of the conifers in particular in the near IR region are analyzed, and variations in the mesophyll cell anatomy and pigment content of the <b>spruces</b> <b>and</b> firs are investigated. The relations between canopy moisture and damage is studied. The TM data are compared to aircraft data and found to be well correlated...|$|R

5|$|Following {{the end of}} {{the last}} glacial period, Indiana's {{topography}} was dominated by <b>spruce</b> <b>and</b> pine forests and was home to mastodon, caribou, and saber-toothed cats. While Northern Indiana had been covered by glaciers, Southern Indiana remained unaltered by the ice's advance, leaving plants and animals that could sustain human communities. Indiana's earliest known inhabitants were Paleo-Indians. Evidence exists that humans were in Indiana as early as the Archaic stage (8000–6000 BC). Hunting camps of the nomadic Clovis culture have been found in Indiana. Carbon dating of artifacts found in the Wyandotte Caves of Southern Indiana shows humans mined flint there as early 2000 BC. These nomads ate quantities of freshwater mussels from local streams, as shown by their shell mounds found throughout southern Indiana.|$|E
5|$|Other Mycenas that {{resemble}} M.adscendens include M.alphitophora and M.stylobates. The former is distinguished from M.adscendens by a stem base {{that is not}} swollen or disc-like, the latter by its larger and sturdier fruit body and lack of granules on the cap. A poorly known Japanese species, M.cryptomeriicola, is similar to M.adscendens, but has non-amyloid spores and lacks clamps. M.nucicola is most reliably distinguished from M.adscendens by microscopic characteristics: M.nucicola has four-spored basidia, clamp connections are rare in the hyphae of the gill tissue, and the spores are less broad (typically 4.2–5µm). The Finnish species M.occulta grows on the decaying needles of Norway <b>spruce</b> <b>and</b> Scots pine. It differs from M.adscendens in that its gills do not form a pseudocollarium, it lacks clamps in the hyphae and cells of the hymenium, and the terminal cells in its cap cuticle are densely covered with protuberances.|$|E
5|$|Shoshone National Forest has {{virtually}} all the original animal and plant species that were there when white explorers such as John Colter and Jim Bridger first visited the region. The forest {{is home to the}} Grizzly bear, cougar, moose, tens of thousands of elk as well as the largest herd of bighorn sheep in the U.S. The streams in the forest are considered to have some of the best game species fishing opportunities in the U.S. including Yellowstone cutthroat trout. More than 1,300 miles of hiking trails, 32 campgrounds and adjacent forests and parklands provide numerous recreational opportunities. There are four wilderness areas within the forest, protecting {{more than half of the}} managed land area from development. From sagebrush plains through dense <b>spruce</b> <b>and</b> fir forest to craggy mountain peaks, Shoshone National Forest has a rich biodiversity rarely matched in any protected area.|$|E

50|$|In the Prairie Provinces, the spruce cone maggot (Delia anthracina Czerny), which Rose and Lindquist {{designated}} as Hylemya anthracina (Czerny), attacks cones of white, Engelmann, <b>and</b> black <b>spruces,</b> <b>and</b> {{in some years}} may destroy the entire seed crop. The spruce cone-axis midge (Dasineura rachiphaga) and cone maggots (Pegohylemia) were also found to be damaging white <b>spruce</b> cones <b>and</b> seed near Fairbanks.|$|R
5|$|Suillus brevipes is a {{mycorrhizal}} fungus, and {{it develops}} a close symbiotic {{association with the}} roots of various tree species, especially pine. The underground mycelia form a sheath around the tree rootlets, and the fungal hyphae penetrate between the cortical cells of the root, forming ectomycorrhizae. In this way, the fungus can supply the tree with minerals, while the tree reciprocates by supplying carbohydrates created by photosynthesis. In nature, it associates with two- and three-needle pines, especially lodgepole and ponderosa pine. Under controlled laboratory conditions, the fungus {{has been shown to}} form ectomycorrhizae with ponderosa, lodgepole, loblolly, eastern white, patula, pond, radiata, and red pines. In vitro mycorrhizal associations formed with non-pine species include Pacific madrone, bearberry, western larch, Sitka <b>spruce,</b> <b>and</b> coast Douglas-fir. Fungal growth is inhibited by the presence of high levels of the heavy metals cadmium (350ppm), lead (200ppm), and nickel (20ppm).|$|E
5|$|Yellowstone {{forests are}} {{dominated}} by the lodgepole pine and are eventually replaced by other tree species after 80 to 100years as a forest matures. In Yellowstone, a very short growing season due to high altitude and relatively poor soils allows the lodgepole pine to reach ages approaching three hundred years before other trees such as Engelmann <b>spruce</b> <b>and</b> subalpine fir become established. The lodgepole pines found throughout the Yellowstone Plateau high country grow in uninterrupted dense stands averaging similar ages in various groupings. Though trees normally found in more mature forests do occur, they are not found in large stands as in other forests in the Rocky Mountains. By the 1980s much of the lodgepole pine forests in Yellowstone were between 200 and 250years old and approaching {{the end of their}} lifecycle.|$|E
5|$|Many birds call Adams home or a {{stopover}} {{on their}} migration routes. Songbirds include three species of chickadee, two kinglets, several thrushes, warblers, sparrows, and finches. One unique songbird {{to the high}} elevations is the gray-crowned rosy finch, who can be found far up the mountain, well above the tree line. Raptors {{that live in the}} forest and meadows include Accipiters, red-tailed hawks, golden and bald eagles, ospreys, great horned owls, and falcons. The many snags around the mountain provide forage and nesting habitat for the many species of woodpeckers that live there including the hairy woodpecker, downy woodpecker, and white-headed woodpecker. Jays such as the Steller's jay and gray jay are common and the gray jay is an especially familiar character, as they will boldly investigate campers and hikers. Another familiar character of the higher elevation forests is the Clark's nutcracker with its distinctive call. Swallows and swifts are frequently seen flying just above the water of lakes and some larger streams. Common mergansers and several other species of water birds can be found on many of the lakes as well. The American dipper with its unique way of bobbing about along streams and then ducking into the water is a common sight. Several grouse species, the sooty, <b>spruce,</b> <b>and</b> ruffed grouse and the white-tailed ptarmigan, call the forests and the lower slopes of the mountain home.|$|E

5|$|The {{climate of}} Adams {{gives it a}} large amount of {{diversity}} within its forests. On the west side, down in the lower valleys, grand fir and Douglas fir dominate the forest with Western hemlock and Western red cedar as well. On the east side, Douglas fir and ponderosa pine are dominant with some patches of dense lodgepole pine. Western hemlock and Western red cedar also occur, but are limited to creek and river bottoms. Grand fir is present on sites with better moisture retention. At middle elevations on the west side, grand fir is increasingly replaced by Pacific silver fir and noble fir; and on the east side, lodgepole becomes much more prevalent. Above a certain elevation, lodgepole pine also appears in areas on the west side as well. As elevation increases further, the forest changes again with subalpine fir, Engelmann <b>spruce,</b> <b>and</b> mountain hemlock becoming the dominant tree species on all sides of the mountain. Eventually, the last trees to disappear from the mountainside are the highly cold tolerant whitebark pine and mountain hemlock. Other conifers, 18 species in all, that play a lesser role than the dominant species are Western white pine, Sitka spruce, Western larch, Pacific yew, Alaska cedar, and mountain juniper. Adams is also home to many hardwoods as well including the tree species big leaf maple, Oregon white oak, quaking aspen, black cottonwood, and red alder. Large shrubs/small trees include the dwarf birch, Suksdorf’s hawthorn, California hazelnut, bitter cherry, vine maple, Douglas maple, and blue elderberry and contribute to a vibrant fall display.|$|E
25|$|Oak grows widely {{all over}} the United States, and <b>spruce</b> <b>and</b> birch grow in New York, among many places in the United States. However, no oak, spruce, or birch pollen grains {{were found in the}} control sample, and neither spruce nor birch trees were found growing near the body dump site.
