5|$|Aristotle (384–322 BC) {{studied at}} Plato's Academy in Athens, {{remaining}} {{there for about}} 20 years. Like Plato, he sought universals in his philosophy, but unlike Plato he backed up his views with detailed and systematic observation, notably of {{the natural history of}} the island of Lesbos, where he spent about two years, and the marine life in the seas around it, especially of the Pyrrha lagoon in the island's centre. This study made him the earliest scientist whose written work survives. No similarly detailed work on zoology was attempted until the sixteenth century; accordingly Aristotle remained highly influential for <b>some</b> <b>two</b> thousand years. He returned to Athens and founded his own school, the Lycaeum, where he taught for the last dozen years of his life. His writings on zoology form about a quarter of his surviving work. Aristotle's pupil Theophrastus later wrote a similar book on botany, Enquiry into Plants.|$|E

5|$|Blue {{wildebeest}} fossils {{dating back}} <b>some</b> <b>two</b> {{and a half}} million years ago are common and widespread. They have been found in the fossil bearing caves at the Cradle of Humankind north of Johannesburg. Elsewhere in South Africa they are plentiful at such sites as Elandsfontein, Cornelia and Florisbad. The earliest fossils of the black wildebeest were found in sedimentary rock in Cornelia in the Orange Free State and dated back about eight hundred thousand years. Today, five subspecies of the blue wildebeest are recognised while the black wildebeest has no named subspecies.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1920s, after {{spending}} <b>some</b> <b>two</b> years in Medan {{with the daily}} Sinar Soematra, Andjar returned to Batavia and in 1929 helped establish the magazine Doenia Film, a Malay adaptation of the Dutch-language magazine Filmland; although an adaptation, Doenia Film also contained original coverage of the domestic theatre and film industry. At the time, the cinema of the Indies was becoming established: the first domestic film, Loetoeng Kasaroeng (The Lost Lutung), was released in 1926, and four additional films were released in 1927 and 1928. Andjar wrote extensively regarding local cinematic and theatrical productions; for example, the Indonesian film critic Salim Said writes Andjar inspired the marketing for 1929's Njai Dasima, which emphasised the exclusively native cast. In 1930 Andjar left Doenia Film {{and was replaced by}} Bachtiar Effendi.|$|E
5|$|It is {{difficult}} to reconcile {{the records of the}} Irish annals with Norse sources such as the Orkneyinga Saga but it is likely that Norwegian and Gallgáedil Uí Ímair warlords fought for control for much of period from the 9th to the 12th centuries. In 990 Sigurd the Stout, Earl of Orkney took command of the Hebrides, a position he retained for most of the period until he was killed at the Battle of Clontarf in 1014. There is then a period of uncertainty but it is possible that Sigurd's son Thorfinn the Mighty became ruler circa 1035 until his own death <b>some</b> <b>two</b> decades later.|$|E
5|$|O'Connell {{was born}} to {{distinguished}} lawyer Charles O'Connell in 1849 in Ennis, County Clare, Ireland, <b>some</b> <b>two</b> years {{after the death of}} his famed grand-uncle Daniel O'Connell. Young O'Connell attended Belvedere College, a Jesuit school in Dublin, but was called home at the deaths of his mother and sister in a coach accident. This tragic event was later judged to be the source of O'Connell's sense of the impermanence of the world. After the funeral, he was transferred without enthusiasm to Clongowes Wood College where he studied the classics for three years. O'Connell signed on with the Royal Navy as a midshipman. He travelled around Cape Horn to California in 1868.|$|E

5|$|Olaf and Thorgerd lived happily {{together}} at Hoskuldstead for some time.

Olaf's ever-increasing wealth caused jealousy from Hoskuld's wife Jorunn. Around the same time Olaf and Thorgerd had a daughter, Thurid. Hjardarholt was renowned for its rich decorations; <b>some</b> <b>two</b> decades later, the skald Úlfr Uggason composed the famous poem Húsdrápa, about certain mythological scenes illustrated {{on the walls of}} Olaf's hall.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{research}} on the Wirral has identified a possible landing site for the Norse and Scots. This is a feature called Wallasey Pool. This is {{in the north of}} the Wirral near the River Mersey. The pool is linked to the river by a creek which, before it was developed into modern docks, stretched inland <b>some</b> <b>two</b> miles, was, at high tide over 20 feet deep and was surrounded by a moss or mere which is now known as Bidston Moss. In addition to this landing site a Roman Road leads from the area of Bidston to Chester. Following the route of this road would take an invading force through the area the battle {{is believed to have been}} fought. Landscape survey has identified a likely position for Bruna's burh. This survey places the burh at Brimstage approximately 11 miles from Chester.|$|E

The U-977, which crew was also heading to Argentina seeking for asylum, was also accused of sinking Bahia. However, military investigations carried out by both US and Brazilian Navies, concluded that the cruiser had been indeed sunk due to the above described gunnery accident.|$|E
