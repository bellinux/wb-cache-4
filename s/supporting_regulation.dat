Teachers are likely to hold beliefs about teaching and learning and use of ICT tools which are additional instruments considered in the teaching and learning practice. The increase in ICT development gives wide opportunities in its use to improve the learning performance. The study aims to find out a realistic picture of the teaching-learning constraints of teachers in the use of ICT especially those with certain beliefs in its use. It is the qualitative research using triangulation method. This study involved physics teachers, principals, and physics students from Indonesia and Philippines. The result showed that almost all physics teachers in Indonesia and Philippines belief that ICT has many benefits to enhance learning. The <b>supporting</b> <b>regulation</b> from school management is needed to encourage the teacher to use ICT in their learning activities...|$|E
40|$|The Menkes disease protein (ATP 7 A or MNK) is a P-type transmembrane ATPase {{that regulates}} {{translocation}} of cytosolic copper ions across intracellular membranes of compartments along the secretory pathway. In this study, {{we show that}} endogenous MNK in cultured cell lines is localized to the distal Golgi apparatus and translocates to the plasma membrane in response to exogenous copper ions. This transport event is not blocked by expression of a dominant-negative mutant protein kinase D, an enzyme implicated in regulating constitutive trafficking from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to the plasma membrane, whereas constitutive transport of CD 4 is inhibited. In contrast, protein kinase A inhibitors block copper-stimulated MNK delivery to the plasma membrane. Expression of constitutively active Rho GTPases such as Cdc 42, Rac 1 and RhoA reveals a requirement for Cdc 42 in the trafficking of MNK, to the cell surface. Furthermore, overexpression of WASp inhibits anterograde transport of MNK, further <b>supporting</b> <b>regulation</b> by the Cdc 42 GTPase. These findings define a novel step in TGN-to-plasma membrane traffic required to export MNK to the cell surface. Faculty of ScienceNo Full Tex...|$|E

After waiting more than five years finally the regulation of witness and victim protection was legitimated this regulation is expected to give safety to the witness and the victim. But, can this regulation well function to protect the witness especially the witness of corruption case. And what is the implementation problem? Method, in this legal research used normative legal focused on norms and supported by secondary data as main data. Source of data consisted of primary legal material including various legal regulation and also secondary material using various books related to corruption, witness and victims and library research. The results of this research showed that the regulation is not yet effective to protect witness in corruption case, this is because so many things, such as there is no <b>supporting</b> <b>regulation</b> and no organization to protect them. Otherwise in the reality, this rule meets so. many problems.

40|$|This study {{contributes}} to {{understandings of the}} construction of the carbon economy (termed carbonomics) and its effects on the evolution of the contemporary industrial landscape. Starting from a supranational level, this paper demonstrates how neo-institutional theory provides insights to understand the ways by which countries can craft their carbonomics policy architectures. In particular, this paper broadens the application of the neo-institutional theory of organisational practices to a country-level analysis in order to understand their attempts to reduce global atmospheric pollution. By summarising the carbon policy and regulations of major developed and developing countries which together have contributed more than 75 % of global emissions, this study aims to explore how they incorporate the global carbonomics institutions in their carbon policy architectures. Three selected countries are studied to reveal different roadmaps, albeit with some considerable degrees of similarity, for designing and implementing their climate policies to curb emissions. The case studies also shed light on which highly polluting industry sectors have been affected by the carbon policies in various jurisdictions. Because each policy and its <b>supporting</b> <b>regulation</b> entail compliance costs and promulgate certain rules to be followed, the impact of carbon policies must be taken into consideration into future research examining contemporary industrial organisation as the world moves into a low carbon economy. ...|$|E
40|$|Consumers {{and governments}} are {{increasingly}} {{interested in the}} safety, authenticity and quality of food commodities. This has driven attention towards non-invasive sensing techniques used for rapid analyzing these commodities. This paper {{provides an overview of}} the state of the art in, and available alternatives for, food assurance based on non-invasive sensing techniques. The main food quality traits of interest using non-invasive sensing techniques are sensory characteristics, chemical composition, physicochemical properties, health-protecting properties, nutritional characteristics and safety. A wide range of non-invasive sensing techniques, from optical, acoustical, electrical, to nuclear magnetic, x-ray, biosensor, microwave and terahertz, are organized according to physical principle. Some of these techniques are now in a period of transition between experimental and applied utilization and several sensors and instruments are reviewed. With continued innovation and attention to key challenges, such non-invasive sensors and biosensors are expected to open up new exciting avenues in the field of portable and wearable wireless sensing devices and connecting with mobile networks, thus finding considerable use in a wide range of food assurance applications. The need for an appropriate regulatory framework is emphasized which acts to exclude unwanted components in foods and includes needed components, with sensors as part of a reassurance framework <b>supporting</b> <b>regulation</b> and food chain management. The integration of these sensor modalities into a single technological and commercial platform offers an opportunity for a paradigm shift in food reassurance...|$|E

The formulation of an intelligent testing strategy (ITS) that allows safety assessment across materials is required to overcome the current need of testing each nanomaterial on a case-by-case basis. By taking into consideration the research landscape, the available tools and the stakeholders involved, the ITS-NANO consortium developed a stepping-stone based research framework which can, when implemented, deliver the information required for flexible and broadly acceptable ITS and risk assessment (RA) protocols. It was identified that in order to derive this knowledge, there needs to be research emphasis on linking physicochemical identifiers to exposure and hazard identifiers, and attention should be given to a number of key cross-cutting issues have been identified which, among other things, include development of standards, dose metrics, high throughput techniques, modelling and integration into regulatory frameworks. Finally, the developed approach must be coherent and continuously updatable, supporting the unified framework required to ensure that we acquire sufficient, rigorously validated knowledge formulation of a robust reliable ITS and RA as quickly as possible. •A research framework that allows the fastest safety assessment across materials. •A stepping-stone based research framework allowing stakeholders to identify position. •Focus on establishing links between physicochemical, exposure and hazard identifiers. •Highlighting cross-cutting key issues dose metrics, high throughput and modelling. •Resulting in a coherent and continuously updatable framework <b>supporting</b> <b>regulation.</b> JRC.

40|$|Public {{initiative}} and referendum voting outcomes provide an opportune {{setting in which}} to study the demand for publicly provided goods and services, such as environmental quality and public education. In the first essay, I use census block group level voting outcomes on California statewide ballot propositions from 2006 to 2012 to test whether the relationship between voter support and income depends on a proposition's fiscal implications or the local availability of private substitutes. Support is modestly increasing in income when the proposition {{is associated with a}} regulatory change in the context of environmental protection. When propositions are tax or bond-funded, however, I find evidence of a convex or U-shaped relationship between median income and the share of votes in favor, consistent with the combined effects of a low tax burden on poor households and a low marginal utility of wealth among rich households. In the context of public education funding, I further find that the positive marginal effect of income at high income levels is moderated in block groups with greater availability of private substitutes, namely a greater density of nearby private schools. Individuals can express their preferences for public goods, and environmental protection in particular, both as voters by <b>supporting</b> <b>regulation</b> or as consumers by choosing favorable alternatives, thus providing a unique opportunity to compare consumer and voter behavior within the same individual and regarding the same issue. In the second essay, I examine the relationship between willingness to pay a premium for products that avoid a controversial technology associated with environmental risks or externalities, with willingness to vote in favor of a ban or mandatory labeling of the technology. Based on a survey on genetically modified food, I find that the majority of respondents make consumer and voter choices that can be explained by a standard utility maximization framework. However, certain respondent characteristics are correlated with inconsistent choice patterns. In particular, low-income voters appear to be overly supportive of regulation relative to their private willingness to pay. Voters who are uncertain about the safety of genetically modified food also tend to be more in favor of mandatory labeling than their consumer choices would imply. While the first two essays consider the relationship between income and demand for environmental protection at a micro level, there are also much broader implications of this relationship. At the country level, higher GDP is often associated with stricter pollution regulation, which may imply a disproportionate amount of production of pollution-intensive goods in less wealthy countries. The hypothesis that countries with relatively strict pollution regulation {{will be more likely to}} import pollution intensive goods from countries with weaker or absent regulation is intuitively appealing and has found moderate support in a number of empirical studies. While these studies focus on the regulation of manufacturing industries, the underlying theoretical argument applies equally to the agricultural sector. The third essay assesses whether cross-country differences in pesticide regulation can induce such "pollution haven'' effects. In particular, I estimate the impact of the international phaseout of methyl bromide on trade flows in agricultural products. I find robust evidence that cross-country differences in allowed methyl bromide usage affect trade flows, and show that the effect varies in magnitude and significance across commodities, largely in line with their baseline reliance on MeBr. The results do not suggest that countries granted exemptions from the phaseout for particular commodities, on the basis of such reliance, gained an unfair competitive advantage...|$|E

40|$|Aims: To {{establish}} {{how frequently}} {{different types of}} stakeholders were cited in the UK media debate about e-cigarette regulation, their stances towards different forms of e-cigarette regulation, and what rationales they employed in justifying those stances. Methods: Quantitative and qualitative content analyses of 104 articles about e-cigarette regulation published in eight UK and three Scottish national newspapers between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2014. Results: Reporting on e-cigarette regulation grew significantly (p< 0. 001) throughout the sample period. Governments and regulatory bodies were the most frequently cited stakeholders and uniformly <b>supported</b> <b>regulation,</b> while other stakeholders did not always <b>support</b> <b>regulation.</b> Arguments for e-cigarette regulation greatly outnumbered arguments against regulation. Regulating purchasing age, restricting marketing and regulating e-cigarettes as medicine were broadly supported, while stakeholders disagreed about prohibiting e-cigarette use in enclosed public spaces. In rationalising their stances, supporters of regulation cited child protection and concerns {{about the safety of}} e-cigarette products, while opponents highlighted the potential of e-cigarettes in tobacco cessation and questioned the evidence base associating e-cigarette use with health harms. Conclusions: In the UK between 2013 and 2014, governments and tobacco control advocates frequently commented on e-cigarettes in UK-wide and Scottish national newspapers. Almost all commentators <b>supported</b> e-cigarette <b>regulation</b> but there was disagreement about whether e-cigarette use should be allowed in enclosed public spaces.
