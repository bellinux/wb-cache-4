[...] "Push on," [...] echoed Reuben and Lawrence {{and some}} of the other men; but some grumbled at the hardships they had to endure, and the <b>short</b> <b>allowance</b> <b>of</b> <b>provisions,</b> while the Indians threatened to desert them.|$|E

What I was goin' to tell ye was, that his {{circumstances}} were a trifle worse than ours, for he was full four thousand miles from the nearest land, and with <b>short</b> <b>allowance</b> <b>of</b> <b>provisions</b> on board." ...|$|E
60|$|As regards Bligh, it is {{sufficient}} {{to say that he}} performed {{one of the most remarkable}} boat-voyages on record. In an overloaded and open boat, on the <b>shortest</b> <b>allowance</b> <b>of</b> <b>provision</b> compatible with existence, through calm and tempest, heat and cold, exposed to the attacks of cannibals and to the reproaches of worn-out and mutinous men, he traversed 3618 miles of ocean in forty-one days, and brought himself and his followers to land, with the exception of one man who was killed by the natives. In this achievement he displayed those qualities of indomitable resolution and unflagging courage which ultimately raised him to high rank in the navy. But we leave him now to trace those incidents which result from the display of his other qualities-- ungovernable passion, overbearing impetuosity, and incomprehensible meanness.|$|R

I'll tell you what education is - To be tumbled out of doors, neck and crop, and put upon the <b>shortest</b> <b>allowance</b> <b>of</b> everything except blows. That's what I call education.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For my part, I am glad {{we are to}} be put on a <b>short</b> <b>allowance</b> <b>of</b> gunpowder, {{and that}} {{crackers}} are forbidden, they are such a nuisance, burning holes in clothes, frightening horses, and setting houses afire," [...] said sober Fred from the gate, where he and several other fellows were roosting socially together.|$|R
60|$|Accordingly, {{after they}} had been {{pronounced}} guilty by the unanimous voice of the jury, and after the judge had consulted earnestly with {{some members of the}} privy council, Malines and Morris were condemned to a fortnight's imprisonment on <b>short</b> <b>allowance</b> <b>of</b> the poorest food, and the other criminals to the same for a week.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{you observe}} is fery true, Tonal'," [...] said the trader, {{with a serious}} air, [...] "it might have been worse. There {{was a bit of}} the barrel went past my head that fery nearly put me on a <b>short</b> <b>allowance</b> <b>of</b> life. But come with me to the store an' we will choose a better one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly not. That is {{the very}} thing that we mus'n't do. For {{anything}} we know, there may be natives about; and some of us might get stuck full of their arrows before we could get out of range. This will be good news, {{and there will be no}} longer any need for your being kept on <b>short</b> <b>allowance</b> <b>of</b> water." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{business}} of the day, with a particular detail {{of which it is}} unnecessary to trouble the reader, was gone through according to the established form, and the sermon pronounced upon the occasion {{had the good fortune to}} please even the critical David Deans, though it was only an hour and a quarter long, which David termed a <b>short</b> <b>allowance</b> <b>of</b> spiritual provender.|$|R
25|$|Aside {{from his}} pay, Bacon as an {{overseer}} {{was given an}} <b>allowance</b> <b>of</b> <b>provisions</b> for a year which included six hundred pounds of pork, two barrels of wheat flour and all the corn meal he wanted.

6000|$|Every {{one took}} care that Miss Caprice {{should not have}} time to change her mind. The whole house was soon in a bustle, for Prue ruled supreme. Mr. Yule fled from the din of women's tongues, the bridegrooms were kept on a very <b>short</b> <b>allowance</b> <b>of</b> bride, and Sylvia and Jessie were almost invisible, for milliners and mantua-makers swarmed about them till they felt like {{animated}} pin-cushions. The last evening came at length, and Sylvia was just planning an escape into the garden when Prue, whose tongue wagged as rapidly as her hands worked, exclaimed-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{it will do}} you all good, if you get on <b>short</b> <b>allowance</b> <b>of</b> wine, for a time. I can't think why {{men want}} to sit, after dinner, and drink bottle after bottle of port wine. It is all very well to say that {{everyone}} does it, {{but that is a}} very poor excuse. Why should they do it? Women don't do it, and I don't see why men should. I hope the time will come when it is considered just as disgraceful, for a man to drink, as it is for a woman.|$|R
60|$|In {{obedience}} to this summons the clerk {{got off the}} high stool (to which he had communicated a high polish by countless gettings off and on), and presented himself in Mr Nickleby's room. He was a tall man of middle age, with two goggle eyes whereof one was a fixture, a rubicund nose, a cadaverous face, and a suit of clothes (if the term be allowable when they suited him not at all) much the worse for wear, very much too small, and placed upon such a <b>short</b> <b>allowance</b> <b>of</b> buttons that it was marvellous how he contrived to keep them on.|$|R
60|$|During {{all this}} time our larder had been well {{supplied}} by Blondin with fresh fish from the lake, and by the Indians with haunches of reindeer and moose, or elk, venison. They also brought us beaver-meat, the tails of which were considered the best portions. Bear's-meat was offered us, {{but we did not}} relish it much, possibly from prejudice; but we would have been glad of it, doubtless, if reduced to <b>short</b> <b>allowance.</b> <b>Of</b> course wild-fowl of all kinds were plentiful, and many of these were shot by Lumley and myself, as well as by our men.|$|R
60|$|But Will Ward {{could not}} be thus induced to eat. He was really ill, and before night was in a high fever. You may be sure that Dr Brooke, as every one now called him, {{did his best to}} help the little sufferer, but, of course, he could do very little, for all the {{medicines}} which he had prepared had been put into the long-boat, and, in a small open boat with no comforts, no medicines, and on <b>short</b> <b>allowance</b> <b>of</b> food, little could be done, except to give the boy a space of the floor on which to lie, to shield him from spray, and to cover him with blankets.|$|R
5|$|When {{the miserable}} Wretch hath worn out the Charity of his Friends, and {{consumed}} the Money, which he hath raised upon his Cloaths, and Bedding, and hath eat his last <b>Allowance</b> <b>of</b> <b>Provisions,</b> he {{usually in a}} few Days grows weak, for want of Food, with the symptoms of a hectick Fever; and when {{he is no longer}} able to stand, if he can raise 3d to pay the Fee of the common Nurse of the Prison, he obtains the Liberty of being carried into the Sick Ward, and lingers on for about a Month or two, by the assistance of the above-mentioned Prison Portion <b>of</b> <b>Provision,</b> and then dies.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Well, I had had {{twelve or}} {{fifteen years of}} {{knocking}} about first. I came here some nine months before you; I had had one crop before you came. I chose this place, because, having served last in a little corvette, I knew I should feel more at home where I had a constant opportunity of knocking {{my head against the}} ceiling. Besides, it would never do for {{a man who had been}} aboard ship from his boyhood to turn luxurious all at once. Besides, again; having been accustomed to a very <b>short</b> <b>allowance</b> <b>of</b> land all my life, I thought I’d feel my way to the command of a landed estate, by beginning in boxes.’ ...|$|R
60|$|I {{dare say}} my two companions on this little wreck {{had the same}} {{indifference}} on this subject, as I felt myself. I heard no prayer, no appeal to God for mercy, nothing indeed from any of us, {{to show that we}} thought at all on the subject. Hunger gave me a little trouble, and during the second night I would fall into a doze, and wake myself up by dreaming of eating meals that were peculiarly grateful to me. I have had the same thing happen on other occasions, when on <b>short</b> <b>allowance</b> <b>of</b> food. Neither of the blacks said anything on the subject of animal suffering, and the one that was lost, went out, as it might be, like a candle.|$|R
60|$|Captain Cuttle, perplexed by no such meditations, guarded Florence to her room, {{and watched}} at {{intervals}} upon the charmed ground outside her door--for such it truly was to him--until he felt sufficiently easy {{in his mind}} about her, to turn in under the counter. On abandoning his watch for that purpose, {{he could not help}} calling once, rapturously, through the keyhole, 'Drownded. Ain't he, pretty?'--or, when he got downstairs, making another trial at that verse of Lovely Peg. But it stuck in his throat somehow, and he could make nothing of it; so he went to bed, and dreamed that old Sol Gills was married to Mrs MacStinger, and kept prisoner by that lady in a secret chamber on a <b>short</b> <b>allowance</b> <b>of</b> victuals.|$|R

"I {{would not}} miss seeing you for worlds," [...] wrote Sir Lionel; [...] "and {{although}} I {{have been ordered}} to Constantinople with all the immediate haste which your civil-service grandees always use in addressing us military slaves, it shall go hard with me but I will steal a fortnight from {{them in order to}} pass it with you at Jerusalem. I suppose I shall scarce know you, or you me; but when you see an old gentleman in a military frock, with a bald head, a hook nose, and a rather <b>short</b> <b>allowance</b> <b>of</b> teeth, you may then be sure that you look upon your father. However, I will be at Z----'s Hotel--I believe they honour the caravansary with that name--as soon as possible after the 14th." ...|$|R
60|$|Hunger of {{any sort}} is {{a hard thing to}} bear, {{especially}} when the sufferer has a youthful appetite, and Polly was kept on such a <b>short</b> <b>allowance</b> <b>of</b> happiness for six months, that she got quite thin and interesting; and often, when she saw how big her eyes were getting, and how plainly the veins on her temples showed, indulged the pensive thought that perhaps spring dandelions might blossom o'er her grave. She had no intention of dying till Tom's visit was over, however, and as the time drew near, she went through such alternations of hope and fear, and lived in such a state of feverish excitement, that spirits and color came back, and she saw that the interesting pallor she had counted on would be an entire failure.|$|R
60|$|My {{departure}} is uncertain, but I do {{not think}} it will be till after harvest. I will be on very <b>short</b> <b>allowance</b> <b>of</b> time indeed, if I do not comply with your friendly invitation. When it will be I don't know, but if I can make my wish good I will endeavour to drop you a line some time before. My best compliments to Mrs. Burness; I should be equally mortified should I drop in when she is abroad, but of that, I suppose, there is little chance. What I have wrote, heaven knows. I have not time to review it, so accept of it in the beaten way of friendship. With the ordinary phrase, and perhaps rather more than the ordinary sincerity, I am, dear Sir, ever yours, R. B.|$|R
60|$|The pond {{was indeed}} {{swarming}} with these ferocious reptiles, which were constantly thrusting their ugly snouts {{above the surface}} and then disappearing with a flourish of their powerful tails. During the rainy season this lake was much larger, and afforded ample room for its inhabitants; but {{at the height of}} the dry season, which it was at this time, there was little water, and it was much overstocked. When alligators are thus put upon <b>short</b> <b>allowance</b> <b>of</b> water, they frequently bury themselves in the wet mud, and lie dormant for a long time, while the water continues to retire and leaves them buried. But when the first shower of the rainy season falls, they burst open their tomb, and drag their dry bodies to the lake or river, on whose margin they went to sleep.|$|R
60|$|For {{fourteen}} {{souls to}} be tossed {{about on the}} wide and stormy sea, during many weeks, it might be months, in a small open boat, crowded together and cramped, without sufficient covering, and on <b>short</b> <b>allowance</b> <b>of</b> food, was indeed a dreary prospect, even for the men--how much more so for the delicate child who shared their trials and sufferings? Captain Dunning's heart sank within him when he thought of it; but he knew how great an influence the conduct and bearing of a commander has, in such circumstances, on his men; so he strove to show a smiling, cheerful countenance, though oftentimes he carried a sad and anxious heart in his bosom. To the doctor and Tim Rokens alone did he reveal his inmost thoughts, {{because he knew that}} he could trust them, and felt that he needed their advice and sympathy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Leaves! {{what are}} leaves, child? {{there are no}} leaves at sea. If you wish to know {{whether it is a}} dead calm or not, try a mould candle,--your dips flaring too much,--and then you may be certain whether there is or is not any wind. If you were in a {{latitude}} where the air was so still that you found a difficulty in stirring it to draw it in in breathing, you might fancy it a calm. People are often on a <b>short</b> <b>allowance</b> <b>of</b> air in the calm latitudes. Here, again, look at that water! It is like milk in a pan, with no more motion now than there is in a full hogshead before the bung is started. On the ocean the water is never still, let the air be as quiet as it may." ...|$|R

60|$|I {{was pretty}} busy now; up at {{five in the}} morning, and home at nine or ten at night. But I had {{infinite}} satisfaction in being so closely engaged, and never walked slowly on any account, and felt enthusiastically that the more I tired myself, the more I was doing to deserve Dora. I had not revealed myself in my altered character to Dora yet, because she was coming to see Miss Mills in a few days, and I deferred all I {{had to tell her}} until then; merely informing her in my letters (all our communications were secretly forwarded through Miss Mills), that I had much to tell her. In the meantime, I put myself on a <b>short</b> <b>allowance</b> <b>of</b> bear's grease, wholly abandoned scented soap and lavender water, and sold off three waistcoats at a prodigious sacrifice, as being too luxurious for my stern career.|$|R

Now, you know me, Michael. I live for my calculations; I live for my manifold and ever-changing views of life; pens and paper and the productions of the popular press are to me as important as food and drink; and my life was growing quite intolerable when, in the confusion of that fortunate railway accident at Browndean, I made my escape. They must think me dead, and are trying to deceive the world for the chance of the tontine." ...|$|R

60|$|Leaving {{them they}} spent a wretched night {{on the shores of}} a lake, deluged with rain and tormented with sandflies and mosquitoes--the former being perhaps the {{greatest}} pests of the country. Soon the guides grew tired of their mode of travelling, and the <b>allowance</b> <b>of</b> <b>provisions</b> had to be still further reduced. Fearing that they might run short altogether, Mackenzie ordered Reuben and his son to fall behind, bury some pemmican in reserve for their return, and make a fire over the spot to conceal the fact that it had been dug into. They were now on two-thirds <b>of</b> their regular <b>allowance.</b> Soon afterwards they came to a river too deep to ford, but one of their guides swam across and brought over a raft that lay on the other side.
