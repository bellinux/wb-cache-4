500|$|Although the PRIA {{limited the}} number of horses that could be adopted in any one year by a <b>single</b> <b>adopter</b> to four, it allowed the BLM to make {{exceptions}} to the limit. [...] In the mid-1980s, the BLM had placed for adoption over 20,000 horses to large scale adopters, and thousands of the horses were slaughtered. [...] In March 1987, the Animal Protection Institute sued the Department of the Interior, arguing that BLM was {{turning a blind eye}} to [...] "adopters" [...] who obtained horses with the intent to slaughter. In Animal Protection Institute v. Hodel, 671 F. Supp. 695 (1987), the United States District Court for the District of Nevada held that BLM could not ignore the intent of adopters. The decision was upheld by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in Animal Protection Institute v. Hodel, 860 F.2d 920 (1988). In 1988, the BLM terminated the large scale adoption program. [...] In 1997, the Animal Protection Institute and BLM signed an out-of-court settlement under which BLM would require individuals to sign an affidavit stating they had no intent to sell the animal for slaughter or for use as rodeo stock. The settlement also required BLM to establish rules requiring horse slaughterhouses to maintain paperwork on horses for no less than one year and to report any horses to which clear title was not established. BLM also agreed to no longer permit adoption by proxy or power of attorney. But the district court refused to enforce this settlement in 2000, leaving the issue unresolved.|$|E
5000|$|Single persons will {{no longer}} be {{eligible}} to adopt Chinese children, although they were previously allowed to by the CCAA. [...] In fact, approximately one-third of all children adopted from China in the past were adopted by single parents. [...] This restriction is due, in part, to the belief that the child will be without a parent if the <b>single</b> <b>adopter</b> dies. [...] Chinese law has always precluded homosexual individuals or couples from adopting children.|$|E

500|$|The {{adoption}} {{requirements and}} policies for adopting children {{have made it}} harder for foster families and potential adoptive families to adopt. Before a family can adopt, they must go through state, county, and agency criteria. [...] Adoption agencies' criteria express the importance of age of the adoptive parents, {{as well as the}} agency's desire for married couples over <b>single</b> <b>adopters.</b> [...] Adoptive parents also have to deal with criteria that are given by the birth parents of the adoptive child. The different criteria for adopting children makes it harder for couples to adopt children in need, but the strict requirements can help protect the foster children from unqualified couples.|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{three key}} conservation practices adoption behavior for 266 farmers in eastern Washington. Results revealed (1) that multiple practice adopters contrast more sharply with non-adopters than do <b>adopters</b> of a <b>single</b> practice, and (2) <b>single</b> practice <b>adopters</b> differ more from zero practice adopters than from other farmers.

40|$|Previous {{studies of}} mobile payment (m-payment) {{services}} have primarily {{focused on a}} <b>single</b> group of <b>adopters.</b> This study identifies {{the factors that influence}} an individual’s intention to use m-payment services and compares groups of current users (adopters) with potential users (non-adopters). A research model that reflects the behavioral intention to use m-payment services is developed and empirically tested using structural equation modeling on a data set consisting of 529 potential users and 256 current users of m-payment services in Thailand. The results show that the factors that influence current users’ intentions to use m-payment services are compatibility, subjective norms, perceived trust, and perceived cost. Subjective norms, compatibility, ease of use, and perceived risk influenced potential users’ intentions to use m-payment. Subjective norms and perceived risk had a stronger influence on potential users, while perceived cost had a stronger influence on current users, in terms of their intentions to use m-payment services. Discussions, limitations, and recommendations for future research are addressed...|$|R
30|$|Harvesting costs {{per unit}} volume for similar sized trees are {{typically}} higher in partial harvesting operations, especially on steep slopes and in mixed-species stands when different species {{have to be}} sorted and marketed separately (Pausch 2005). These higher costs are partially due to reduced efficiency of logging when only small amounts are harvested in a <b>single</b> operation. Early <b>adopters</b> also may incur higher costs and time delays when hiring and training specialized logging contractors. The necessary investments into infrastructure, including the development and maintenance of road systems, {{may also be a}} financial barrier to managing alternative silviculture, especially for landowners with smaller properties. Similarly, compared to conventional approaches, the proper implementation of alternative silvicultural approaches may result in higher personnel costs due to the higher skill level required, as well as more frequent site visits to assess progress, mark trees, and develop and supervise the implementation of often more complicated management prescriptions. Another economic concern with partial harvesting may be the risk of physical damage to the retained growing stock. This issue is of special concern in difficult terrain and when large-crowned species are felled or species with little decay resistance are left behind (Nill et al. 2011).|$|R
