50|$|Similarly, for non-mechanical {{solid state}} {{switching}} (i.e., a transistor), large voltage drops across an unactivated <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>switch</b> can destroy the component in question (either instantaneously or through accelerated wear and tear).|$|E
50|$|Depending on {{the load}} {{that is to}} be controlled, {{different}} modules must be used. For incandescent lamp loads, a lamp module or wall switch module can be used. These modules switch the power using a TRIAC <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>switch</b> and are also capable of dimming the lamp load. Lamp modules are almost silent in operation, and generally rated to control loads ranging from approximately 40 to 500 watts.|$|E
50|$|As {{switching}} time only specifies an end value of 90% of the settled/final {{value of the}} RF signal, settling time is often highlighted in <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>switch</b> performance where the need for accuracy and precision is more critical. Settling time is measured to a level closer to the final value. The widely used margin-to-final value of settling time is 0.01 dB (99.77% of the final value) and 0.05 dB (98.86% of the final value). This specification is commonly used for GaAs FET switches {{because they have a}} gate lag effect caused by electrons becoming trapped {{on the surface of the}} GaAs.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{switches}} typically used in switch matrices: Coaxial Electromechanical <b>Switches</b> and <b>Solid</b> <b>State</b> <b>Switches,</b> also known as electronic switches.

This paper describes baseline experiments on arc fault management through the use of <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>switching.</b> Direct current testing on series arcs and on parallel arcs across carbonized paths suggests that in some cases, an arc event can be actively managed.

5000|$|Water level sensing switch type - Pressure {{switches}} {{are fully}} enclosed, usually inside the pump body, making them immune to obstructions or floating debris in the sump basin. Float switches, particularly the types {{attached to the}} end of a short length of flexible electrical cable, can get tangled or obstructed, especially if the pump is prone to movement in the basin due to torque effects when starting and stopping. Pressure switches are typically factory set and not adjustable, while float switches can be adjusted in place to set the high and low water levels in the sump basin. There is a <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>switch</b> utilizing field-effect technology, which will turn on and off the pump through use of an internal switch and a piggyback plug.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A novel {{method to}} produce a fast high voltage solid states switch using Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBTs) is {{presented}} for discharge-pumped gas lasers. The IGBTs are connected in series to achieve a high voltage rating. An avalanche transistor is used as the gate driver. The fast pulse generated by the avalanche transistor quickly charges the large input capacitance of the IGBT, resulting in a switch out of a fast high-voltage pulse. The switching characteristic of fast-high voltage <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>switch</b> has been estimated in the multi-stage series-connected IGBT with the applied voltage of several tens of kV.

Parasitic array antennas mainly consist {{of one or}} few active antenna elements which are surrounded by passive elements. The parasitic reactances of the passive elements can be controlled either by electronic tuning or switching. Doing this in a suitable way different antenna patterns can be produced. The presented circular switched parasitic array (CSPA) antennas consist of a circular array of passive monopoles and one active monopole in the center. The circumferential monopoles can be switched between a reflecting and a non-reflecting state by means of either micro-relay <b>switches</b> or <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>switches.</b> In the reflecting state, high currents can be expected on the monopoles and the attached switching circuits.

40|$|A {{semiconductor}} <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>switch</b> {{has been}} constructed and {{tested in the}} prototype extraction kicker pulse generator of CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [1]. The switch is made of 10 modified 4. 5 kV, 66 mm symmetric GTO's (also called FHCT-Fast High Current Thyristor), connected in series. It holds off a d. c. voltage of 30 kV and conducts a 5 µs half-sine wave current of 20 kA with an initial di/dt of 10 kA/µs. Major advantages of the switch are the extremely low self-firing hazard, no power consumption during the ready-to-go status, instantaneous availability, simple condition control, very low noise emission during soft turn-on switching and easy maintenance. However, the inherent soft, relatively slow turn-on time is a non negligible part of the required rise time and this involves adaptation of generator components. A dynamic current range of 16 is achieved with variations in rise time, which stay within acceptable limits. Important generator improvements have been made with the series diodes and freewheel diodes. A more efficient droop compensation circuit is being studied. It is directly connected in series with the freewheel diode stack and maintains an acceptable flattop variation of 5 % of the magnet current during 90 µs.

40|$|The {{aspect to}} be {{investigated}} during this contract was an electron-beam triggered diamond switch {{to be used in}} high power modulators. Today's high power modulators require higher voltage switches than those developed to date. Specifically, the proposed 1 TeV linear collider, the NLC/ILC at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC), consists of two linacs with 6600 X-Band klystrons powered by 3300 high power modulators. These modulators require switches capable of handling 80 kV, switching 8 kA with pulse durations ranging from 2 ps (linac) to 6 {micro}s (pre-linac) with switching times < 50 ns at pulse repetition frequencies up to 180 Hz. In addition the large number of switches and other components dictate a pulse to pulse jitter of < 10 ns and a mean time between failures of at least 50, 000 hours. The present approach is to use hydrogen filled thyratrons. While these switches meet the voltage and conduction current requirements they lack the required reliability (pulse to pulse jitter) and lifetime. Research to improve these aspects is in progress. A <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>switch</b> inherently offers the required reliability and lifetime. However, Si-based switches developed to date are limited to about 5 kV and several must be stacked in series to deliver the required voltage. This further increases the already large parts count and compromises reliability and lifetime. A monolithic, <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>switch</b> capable of meeting all the requirements for X-Band modulators would be ideal.

40|$|The {{transient}} temperature of <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> power <b>switches</b> is investigated using thermal resistance network modelling and experimental testing. The {{ability of a}} heat sink mounted {{to the top of}} the device to reduce the {{transient temperature}} is assessed. Transient temperatures for heat pulses of up to 100 ms are of most interest. The transient temperature distribution inside a typical stack-up of a <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> power <b>switch</b> is characterised. The thermal effects of adding a heat sink {{to the top of the}} device are then assessed. A variety of heat sink thicknesses and materials are evaluated. Components of the device stack-up are varied in order to assess their affect on the effectiveness of the heat sink in reducing the device temperature. Thermal networks are successfully applied to model the transient heat conduction inside the stack-ups. This modelling technique allowed a good understanding of the thermal behaviour inside the stack-up and heat sink during the transient period.

In {{the initial}} systems, points were still used but they handled only a low current {{which was used}} to control the high primary current through a <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>switching</b> system. Soon, however, even these contact breaker points were replaced by an angular sensor of some kind - either optical, where a vaned rotor breaks a light beam, or more commonly using a Hall effect sensor, which responds to a rotating magnet mounted on the distributor shaft. The sensor output is shaped and processed by suitable circuitry, then used to trigger a switching device such as a thyristor, which switches a large current through the coil.|$|R

Older systems required mechanical switching systems which were susceptible to environmental problems. At any one time no more than two consecutive segments under the tram should actually be live.
