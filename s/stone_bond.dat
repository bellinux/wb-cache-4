50|$|The {{school is}} {{situated}} on the Domaine Latour de Freins in Brussels. The building was erected by the architect Henri Maquet in 1890. The U shaped building takes {{full advantage of the}} available sunlight and the Flemish neo-renaissance shape, typical for the period, allies brick masonry with white and blue <b>stone</b> <b>bonds,</b> and a natural slated roofing. The property comprises a wooded park with a surface area of 62,800m2.|$|R
50|$|The kitchen {{structure}} {{consists of}} a central rectilinear planned core covered by a gable roof. A simple lean-to roof covers the semi-enclosed verandah space to the west. No verandah exists {{to the east of}} the structure; however, remains of floor framing indicate that such a structure may once have existed {{on this side of the}} kitchen. A fire place and associated chimney constructed from <b>stone</b> <b>bonded</b> with lime and loam adjoins the northern end of the kitchen.|$|R
50|$|A {{distinct}} {{quality of}} this church was {{its use of}} Silay red bricks and coral <b>stones</b> <b>bonded</b> together by lime mixed in duck eggs as a binder. The materials were taken from Guimaras Island. The church was built by Filipinos forced to work under the polo system during the Spanish regime. The unpopular practice required Filipino males from age 16 to 60 to render free labor constructing churches, roads, bridges and other infrastructure {{for a total of}} forty days during the year.|$|R
50|$|The Vestiges of the Gallo-Roman Wall are a {{landmark}} of Roman military heritage, signifying {{the culture of}} the Gallo-Romans in the city of Grenoble. Only the <b>stone</b> <b>bonding</b> remains today but the vestiges of one watchtower can be seen at the Musée de l'Ancien Évêché. The rest of the wall was demolished during the many expansion periods of the city, as it was torn down by the inhabitants of the city for building materials and to make space for new developments.|$|R
50|$|Around 1 km {{south from}} Kačanik, at the {{decreased}} area up tomaximum 684 meters above the sea level, {{at the site}} known as the 'Vranjak'remains of a fortress have been recorded, whereas, a wall of up to1.7 m wide and 2.5-3m height was recorded. The wall was constructedby the use of local <b>stones</b> <b>bonded</b> with lime mortar and positioned abovethe natural rocks. Whereas, up in the hill, {{the wall of the}} fortress is preservedin line of 50-60 m length, that follows the contours of the hill.The fortress communicates through a slope with the Llanishta village.|$|R
50|$|A <b>bonding</b> <b>stone,</b> in looks, are {{somewhat}} {{akin to the}} Trigger Stone worn by King Macaan. However, unlike the Trigger Stone - which is purple, the <b>bonding</b> <b>stone</b> is a deep red. In its inert form, it {{takes the form of}} a prism-shaped diamond but, during its use, the <b>bonding</b> <b>stone</b> is split into two halves. One half is placed onto a person's forehead, while the other is placed onto the forehead of a wyvern, creating a bond between beast and rider. The only example of such a stone being used during the course of Broken Sky's story is by Ryushi to bond himself with his wyvern, Araceil.|$|R
50|$|The house {{listed in}} the 1890 {{inspection}} {{is believed to have}} been built in 1889, replacing an earlier slab hut that was built some 400 metres in from the Nanango road. The building, constructed of horizontal hardwood slabs and weatherboards, had a front verandah, was sheltered by a gabled roof clad in shingles and included a detached kitchen to the rear, connected via a walkway. King utilised <b>stone</b> <b>bonded</b> with lime and loam to construct a fireplace and chimney, and an underground water tank adjacent to the walkway. The space underneath the kitchen was used as a cellar, to store home made wine, jam and preserves, from produce grown on the property. A large mound of spent carbide close to the house indicates the use of this material for lighting.|$|R
5000|$|... 1999 [...] - [...] An {{excavation}} {{is undertaken}} by English Heritage {{consisting of two}} trenches, one through the eastern wall and interior and one through the southern wall. [...] The eastern wall was noticeably robbed but found to be of <b>stone,</b> <b>bonded</b> by clay, with a rubble core. [...] The excavation discovered that the floor was made of sandy clay or else this {{formed the basis for}} a later earthen floor, and that it was cobbled in the western portion of the interior. [...] Finds recovered included some ironwork, modern glass, an animal bone, one Roman Sestertius of Emperor Hadrian dating from AD 125 - 138 and pottery (some pre-Roman, but mostly 2nd/3rd century AD). [...] The archaeologists were able to confirm that the milecastle was of narrow wall construction. [...] The milecastle was noted to have been damaged by ploughing.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper aims at {{presenting}} a digital correlation technique {{to capture the}} full-field displacement thanks to a high-speed camera of a full scale structure tested on a shaking table. The challenges are both the measurements at a full scale to visualize damages versus the resolution of pictures and the dynamical loading that requires {{a large number of}} pictures. The final goal is {{a better understanding of the}} seismic behavior of timber-framed structures with infill to help at modeling such structures and predicting their seismic vulnerability. For this purpose, results of shake table tests carried out on a full-scale one-story timber-framed house filled with <b>stones</b> <b>bonded</b> by an earth based mortar are presented and discussed. DIC full-field measurements allow deriving displacements and accelerations on shear walls as well as lateral forces applied on them. The experimental results presented herein allow analyzing the influence of bracing and might be used to propose optimized aseismic constructions based on cheap technological solutions. These results demonstrate the seismic-resistant behavior of timber-framed structures with infill and constitute a key issue for the promotion of such constructions in developing countries...|$|R
5000|$|The tower, {{which is}} {{surrounded}} by much older earthworks, consisted of three floors and a vaulted cellar.

5000|$|Countertop {{components}} fabricated out {{of granite}} {{and other natural}} stones are sometimes reinforced with metal rods inserted into grooves cut into {{the underside of the}} <b>stone,</b> and <b>bonded</b> in place with various resins. This procedure is called [...] "rodding" [...] by countertop fabricators. Most commonly, these rods will be placed near sink cutouts to prevent cracking of the brittle stone countertop during transportation and installation. [...] Data published by the Marble Institute of America shows that this technique results in a 600% increase in the deflection strength of the component.|$|R
50|$|In a more narrow sense, binders are liquid or dough-like {{substances}} that harden by a chemical or physical process and bind fibres, filler powder and other particles added into it.

50|$|The {{village of}} Nikadin (Nicodemus), {{nowadays}} a suburban {{part of the}} town of Ferizaj, is situated only 2 kilometers south from the town, sited in a spacious and fertile countryside. During the 1960s, superficial traces of a Roman villa complex have been recorded here. Nevertheless, during gardening carried out in front of a house, accidentally a remarkable sarcophagus lid was unearthed, a rare and unique for the region of Kosovo. A sarcophagus is a funeral receptacle for a corpse, most commonly carved from marble or limestone. The sarcophagus lid discovered here is carved in marbled limestone {{in the shape of a}} house roof and decorated on the sides with anthropomorphic human bust, while on the front of the lid,decorated with floral motifs. The sarcophagus lid was carved during the end of the 3rd or the beginning of the 4th century AD. The accidental discovery of the lid, lead towards the rescue excavation investigation (2007) carried out in form of trial trenches. The results of this archaeological research were unexpected, while a small unknown early Christian church (4th -6th century AD) was unearthed (though very damaged). Taking into account that, the church wasconstructed by <b>stones</b> <b>bonded</b> with lime mortar, but the most interesting discoveries were the spolia (the re-use of earlier building material or decorative sculpture on new monuments) of the Roman date.|$|R

50|$|Installing {{flexible}} stone veneers {{is typically}} done by cutting the sheet using long nose tin snips and then adhering to a substrate using various adhesives. Because the flexible stone veneer sheets are waterproof {{they can be}} used in most wet locations. These materials hold up to most indoor/outdoor environments other than extreme low freezing conditions. Like real stone these flexible stone veneers can also be sealed using wood or <b>stone</b> sealers to <b>bond</b> and protect the surface while bringing out the colors.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the bond}} {{behaviour}} of masonry elements made of tuff <b>stone</b> and <b>bonded</b> with {{different types of}} FRP fabrics (glass, carbon, basalt) has been investigated through an experimental campaign. Tuff is a natural stone representing a very common base material {{for the construction of}} masonry buildings in Southern Italy and many Mediterranean areas. Two series of specimens have been tested: 1) single blocks and 2) prisms made of three blocks and two mortar joints. The tests have been carried out according to a single-lap shear scheme according to a push-pull set-up. Presence of a plastering was also investigated for both series. The experimental results have been examined in terms of both debonding load and local stress transfer phenomena in order to evidence the performance of the different fibres and the effect of both mortar joints and plastering...|$|R
5|$|The pillars {{that support}} {{the roof of the}} mantapa are {{monolithic}} shafts from the base up to the neck of the capital. Therefore, the height of the mantapa and the overall size of the temple were limited by the length of the stone shafts that the architects were able to obtain from the quarries. The height of the temple was also constrained by the weight of the superstructure on the walls and, since Chalukyan architects did not use mortar, by the use of dry masonry and <b>bonding</b> <b>stones</b> without clamps or cementing material.|$|R

40|$|A {{measure of}} the {{durability}} of Portland cement, lime mortars suitable for heritage stone masonry was obtained by testing small stack bonded masonry specimens for flexural bond strength, stress-strain under compression and freeze-thaw resistance. The bond strength of the mortar to Ohio stone was generally very poor in contrast to Nepean <b>stone.</b> The poor <b>bond</b> also caused relatively high initial deformation under compressive load. Loss of bond was also {{the most common form}} of failure observed during the freeze-thaw tests. Additional factors probably affecting the freeze-thaw resistance of the mortar are air entrainment, carbonation and the higher than expected lime content in the lime putty...|$|R

40|$|A {{new method}} of the {{superfinishing}} is investigated, {{in which the}} cutting ability of diamond stone is controlled by changing the strength of electrolytic in-process dressing. Water-solution type coolant and metal <b>bonded</b> <b>stone</b> are used to employ the electrolytic dressing. As work materials, a carbon steel S 45 C, a bearing steel SUJ 2 and alumina are used. The results obtained are as follows. It is effective for control of electrolytic dressing to change the operating time of electrolysis or the ratio of on-time to off-time in electric pulse. As the dressing becomes stronger, the cutting ability of stone improves and the metal removal rate becomes larger. As the dressing becomes weaker, the cutting ability of stone is lost and then the surface roughness of workpiece becomes smaller. The cutting ability of stone which has been lost in finishing operation can be regenerated again applying the strong electrolysis. This in-process dressing method {{makes it possible to}} obtain the intended finishing performances of metal removal rate and surface roughness, and to finish several work materials of different machinability using a same kind of stone...|$|R
