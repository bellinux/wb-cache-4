5|$|Falle had no role models. She {{began writing}} poetry about suicide and wearing black clothing. She acted out by {{stealing}} cars and using drugs recreationally. She {{started out with}} <b>soft</b> <b>drugs</b> and {{then moved on to}} using psychedelic mushrooms and LSD. Her associates in these criminal activities, who came from similarly dysfunctional backgrounds, provided her with a sense of belonging that she no longer found at home. Falle's mother had a series of boyfriends who abused her and made the house unsafe, so Falle ran away from home. She slept at friends' houses, on their couches and in tents in their backyards, concealing her presence from her friends' parents.|$|E
25|$|Legal distinctions {{are made}} in the Opium Law between drugs with a low risk of harm and/or addiction, called <b>soft</b> <b>drugs,</b> and drugs with a high risk of harm and/or addiction, called hard drugs. <b>Soft</b> <b>drugs</b> include hash, marijuana, {{sleeping}} pills and sedatives, while hard drugs include heroin, cocaine, amphetamine, LSD and ecstasy. Policy has been to largely tolerate the sale of <b>soft</b> <b>drugs</b> while strongly suppressing the sale, circulation and use of hard drugs, effectively separating it into two markets. Establishments that have been permitted to sell <b>soft</b> <b>drugs</b> under certain circumstances are called coffee shops. Laws established in January 2013 required visitors of coffee shops to be Dutch residents, but these laws were only applied in Zeeland, North Brabant and Limburg after much local criticism. Possession of a soft drug for personal use in quantities below a certain threshold (5 grams of cannabis or 5 cannabis plants) is tolerated, but larger quantities or posession of hard drugs may lead to prosecution. Prosecution for possession, trade and (in some rare cases) use are typically handled by the muncipal government except where large-scale criminal activity is suspected.|$|E
40|$|In {{his control}} balance theory Charles Tittle {{maintained}} that under favorable conditions unbalanced control ratios {{will lead to}} different forms of deviance. The type of deviance chosen is argued {{to depend on the}} degree of the control imbalance and the desirability the offense presents as a method of altering the imbalance. Utilizing a sample of homeless street youth this study examined if different types of control balance ratios were associated with hard and <b>soft</b> <b>drug</b> use. The findings revealed that control balance surpluses and control balance deficits were both related to hard and <b>soft</b> <b>drug</b> use but that these relationships were significantly stronger for hard drug use. Further, provocation and self-control were significant predictors of hard but not <b>soft</b> <b>drug</b> use while drug using peers predicted <b>soft</b> <b>drug</b> use but not hard drug use. Parental drug use, perceptions of risk, and values supportive of illegal behavior predicted both forms of drug use. Results are discussed and directions for further research and theoretical refinement are offered. ...|$|R

5000|$|In 2006, Heideroosjes made {{international}} news {{by making a}} song with the mayor of Maastricht, Gerd Leers. In this song called [...] "Dope man" [...] they mock the Dutch <b>soft</b> <b>drug</b> policy, which in their eyes is hypocritical. A few weeks later the Dutch minister of Justice, Piet Hein Donner, recorded a rap song with rapper Meester G responding to 'Dope man' by defending his <b>soft</b> <b>drug</b> policy.

25|$|One {{controversial}} issue which has dominated Maastricht politics {{for many years}} and which has also affected national and international politics, is the city's approach to <b>soft</b> <b>drugs.</b> Under the pragmatic Dutch soft drug policy, a policy of non-enforcement, individuals may buy and use cannabis from 'coffeeshops' (cannabis bars) under certain conditions. Maastricht, like many other border towns, has seen a growing influx of 'drug tourists', mainly young people from Belgium, France and Germany, who provide a large amount of revenue for the coffeeshops (around 13) in the city centre. The city government, most notably ex-mayor Leers, have been actively promoting drug policy reform {{in order to deal with}} its negative side effects.|$|E
25|$|Proponents of gedoogbeleid {{argue that}} such a policy {{practices}} more consistency in legal protection than without it. Opponents of the Dutch drug policy either call for full legalization, or argue that laws should penalize morally wrong or deviant behavior, whether enforceable or not. In the Dutch courts, however, {{it has long been}} determined that the institutionalized non-enforcement of statutes with well defined limits constitutes de facto decriminalization. The statutes are kept on the books mainly due to international pressure and in adherence with international treaties. A November 2008 poll showed that a 60% majority of the Dutch population support the legalisation of <b>soft</b> <b>drugs.</b> The same poll showed that 85% supported closing of all cannabis coffeeshops within 250 meters walking distance from schools.|$|E
25|$|GreenLeft values {{individual}} {{freedom and the}} rule of law. The party wants to legalise <b>soft</b> <b>drugs.</b> It wants to protect civil rights on the Internet by extending constitutional protection for free communication to email and other modern technologies. It also favours a reform of copyright to allow non-commercial reproduction and the use of open-source software in the public sector. In the long term, it seeks to abolish the monarchy and create a republic. It also favours a reduction {{of the size of the}} government bureaucracy, for instance by decreasing the number of Dutch ministries and abolishing the Senate. Finally, GreenLeft favours liberal immigration and asylum policies. It wants to empower victims of human trafficking by giving them a residence permit and it wants to abolish the income requirements for marriage migration.|$|E
25|$|Criminal {{investigations}} into more serious forms {{of organized crime}} mainly involve drugs (72%).

50|$|Loteprednol {{etabonate}} {{was developed}} using retrometabolic drug design. It is a so-called <b>soft</b> <b>drug,</b> meaning its structure was {{designed so that}} it is predictably metabolised to inactive substances. These metabolites, Δ1-cortienic acid and its etabonate, are derivatives of cortienic acid, itself an inactive metabolite of hydrocortisone.|$|R
50|$|The gedoogbeleid or {{tolerance}} policy {{gave rise}} to coffeeshop licensing which meant {{that as long as}} coffeeshops did not sell hard drugs, they were allowed to operate. Coffeeshops were not allowed to operate in certain cities near the borders of Germany and Belgium because it was felt <b>soft</b> <b>drug</b> use might raise crime there.|$|R
25|$|When {{analysing}} the Dutch model, both disadvantages and advantages can {{be drawn}} when comparing the results with other countries. On a moral argument, tolerating <b>soft</b> <b>drugs</b> {{can be seen as}} the defeat of the government against hedonism. Additionally, decades of growing and perfecting cannabis and hashish has resulted in increased levels of the main active hallucinogenic constituent tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), as levels have doubled, making the derived products more powerful, and therefore requiring less to achieve the desired effect. The coffee shop will lose its license if it caught selling to minors. Though there was a slight increase of use at the beginning, the rates balanced out some years later. The presence of coffee shops does not translate in public urge for experimentation. In fact, most people that did not consume drugs before the enhancement of the policy continue not to use them.|$|E
25|$|Notably {{absent from}} toleration of drugs is its production, {{particularly}} {{the cultivation of}} weed. This {{has led to a}} seemingly paradoxical system where coffee shops are allowed to buy and sell <b>soft</b> <b>drugs</b> but where production is nearly always punished. Because coffee shops have to get their goods from somewhere, criticism has been raised over the years against continued prosecution of soft drug producers. It was first challenged in court in 2014 when a judge found two people guilty of producing weed in large quantities but refused to punish them. A breakthrough occurred in early 2017, when a slight majority in the House of Representatives allowed for a law to pass that would partly legalize production of weed. In late 2017, the newly formed coalition announced that they would seek to implement an experimental new system in certain cities where coffee shops could legally acquire weed from a state-appointed producer.|$|E
25|$|There are varying rules {{within these}} categories, {{for example the}} amount possessed, the role played in the {{transaction}} and {{the intent of the}} goods. Regarding coffee shops, the line between law and practice thins. A coffee shop is a heavily controlled business establishment where individuals can purchase a personal dose of <b>soft</b> <b>drugs</b> in the form of joints, pastry, drinks and packages. In theory illegal, these shops must abide by governmental and local regulations, as well as meet the AHOJ-G criteria, an acronym for: No Advertising, Hard drugs, Nuisance of any kind, Jongeren (minors under 18), and a limit of five grams per transaction. Additionally, the maximum stock at any time is five hundred grams. Local governments may impose additional rules, such as closing times, zoning (coffee shops may not be close to schools), and parking restrictions. The rationale behind coffee shops is to keep citizens away from the hard drugs scene, bringing them to a safe, social, and regulated environment.|$|E
40|$|AbstractInclusion of {{metabolic}} {{considerations in}} the drug design process leads to significant development {{in the field of}} chemical drug targeting and the design of safer drugs during past few years which is a part of an approach now designated as Retro metabolic drug design (RMDD). This approach represents systematic methodologies that integrate structure–activity and structure–metabolism relationships and are aimed to design safe, locally active compounds with an improved therapeutic index. It embraces two distinct methods, chemical delivery systems and a <b>soft</b> <b>drug</b> approach. Present review recapitulates an impression of RMDD giving reflections on the chemical delivery system and the <b>soft</b> <b>drug</b> approach and provides a variety of examples to embody its concepts. Successful application of such design principles has already been applied to a number of marketed drugs like esmolol; loteprednol etc., and many other candidates like beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, alkylating agents, antimicrobials etc., are also under investigation...|$|R
25|$|The {{drug policy}} of the Netherlands is marked by its {{distinguishing}} between so called <b>soft</b> and hard <b>drugs.</b> An often used argument is that alcohol, which is claimed by some scientists as a hard drug, is legal and a <b>soft</b> <b>drug</b> can't be more dangerous to society if it's controlled. This may refer to the Prohibition in the 1920s, when the U.S. government decided to ban all alcohol. Prohibition created a golden opportunity for organized crime syndicates to smuggle alcohol, {{and as a result}} the syndicates were able to gain considerable power in some major cities.|$|R
40|$|Empirically, {{teenagers}} who use alcohol or marijuana in one period {{are more likely}} to use hard drugs in the future. This pattern can be explained by a causal effect of <b>soft</b> <b>drug</b> consumption on future consumption of hard drugs (i. e., state dependence between drugs or stepping-stone effects) or by unobserved characteristics that make people more likely to use both <b>soft</b> and hard <b>drugs</b> (i. e., correlated unobserved heterogeneity). I estimate a dynamic discrete choice model of alcohol, marijuana and hard drug use over multiple years, and separately identify the contributions of state dependence and unobserved heterogeneity. I find modest-sized but statistically significant “stepping-stone ” effects from <b>softer</b> to harder <b>drugs</b> that are largest among the youngest individuals in my sample. This study also suggests that alcohol, marijuana and hard drugs are complements in utility...|$|R
500|$|Morrison's lyrics on Moondance {{deal with}} themes of spiritual renewal and redemption. It {{departed}} from Astral Weeks discursive, stream-of-consciousness narratives as the singer balanced his spiritual ideas with more worldly subject matter, which biographer Johnny Rogan felt offered the record {{a quality of}} [...] "earthiness". As a counterpart to Astral Weeks, AllMusic critic Jason Ankeny believed it [...] "retains the previous album's deeply spiritual thrust but transcends its bleak, cathartic intensity" [...] by rejoicing in [...] "natural wonder". According to Christgau, the essence of Morrison's spirit was, much like the African-American music that inspired him, [...] "mortal and immortal simultaneously: {{this is a man}} who gets stoned on a drink of water and urges us to turn up our radios all the way into the mystic." [...] His [...] "giddy" [...] preoccupation with [...] "natural wonder" [...] on the album was a product of the new approach to composition and the mellow feel of his new band, Harrington said. In his opinion, the record's exuberant spirit and theme of self-affirmation were partly inspired by the singer having [...] "settled into a life of domestic bliss". Musicologist Brian Hinton argued that Morrison was celebrating a [...] "natural alternative" [...] in his music after quitting <b>soft</b> <b>drugs</b> around this time because they had impeded his productivity.|$|E
2500|$|In recent years, under mayor Gerd Leers, Maastricht {{launched}} a campaign against drug-related problems. Leers instigated a controversial plan to relocate some of the cannabis coffee shops—where the purchase of <b>soft</b> <b>drugs</b> in limited quantities is tolerated—from the city centre to the outskirts, {{in an attempt to}} stop foreign buyers from causing trouble in the downtown area. Although the so-called [...] "coffee corner plan" [...] has not been entirely abandoned, the new mayor Onno Hoes has given priority to the Dutch government's approach of limiting entrance to 'coffee shops' to Dutch adults only, and to tackle the problem of drug runners in cooperation with the city of Rotterdam (where the majority of drug runners are from).|$|E
2500|$|On 27 November 2003, the Dutch Justice Minister Piet Hein Donner {{announced}} that his government was considering rules under which coffeeshops {{would only be}} allowed to sell <b>soft</b> <b>drugs</b> to Dutch residents {{in order to satisfy}} both European neighbors' concerns about the influx of drugs from the Netherlands, {{as well as those of}} Netherlands border town residents unhappy with the influx of [...] "drug tourists" [...] from elsewhere in Europe.
