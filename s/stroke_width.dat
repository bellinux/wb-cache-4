25|$|The mixed-case {{alphabet}} {{now called}} Series E Modified, {{which is the}} standard for destination legend on freeway guide signs, originally existed in two parts: an all-uppercase Series E Modified, which was essentially similar to Series E, except for a larger <b>stroke</b> <b>width,</b> and a lowercase-only alphabet. Both parts were developed by the California Division of Highways (now Caltrans) for use on freeways in 1948–1950.|$|E
25|$|Transport Medium and Motorway Permanent were {{developed}} for the Anderson Committee and appeared on the first motorway signs. The other two typefaces are similar but have additional <b>stroke</b> <b>width</b> in the letters to compensate for light backgrounds. These typefaces {{are the only ones}} permitted on road signs in the UK. Although signs containing other typefaces do appear occasionally in some places, they are explicitly forbidden in government guidelines, and are technically illegal.|$|E
25|$|Typographers have {{developed}} a comprehensive vocabulary for describing the many aspects of typefaces and typography. Some vocabulary applies only to a subset of all scripts. Serifs, for example, are a purely decorative characteristic of typefaces used for European scripts, whereas the glyphs used in Arabic or East Asian scripts have characteristics (such as <b>stroke</b> <b>width)</b> that may be similar in some respects but cannot reasonably be called serifs {{and may not be}} purely decorative.|$|E
50|$|The styling of Arabic glyphs {{comes from}} Times New Roman, which have more varied <b>stroke</b> <b>widths</b> than the Latin, Greek, Cyrillic glyphs {{found in the}} font. Arial Unicode MS uses {{monotone}} <b>stroke</b> <b>widths</b> on Arabic glyphs, similar to Tahoma.|$|R

30|$|While {{examining}} SWT histograms {{of several}} SWT images, {{we came across}} some interesting observations. SWT histograms corresponding to true text are usually steeper, more compact, and edgier {{as opposed to the}} non-text histograms, which are typically wider and ascend in a more continuous fashion (see Figure  6). Our empirical observations seem to be reasonable since the text usually contains equal <b>stroke</b> <b>widths.</b> On the other hand, non-text regions contain more SWT noise; therefore, <b>stroke</b> <b>widths</b> are more evenly distributed over the whole spectrum.|$|R
25|$|Sans serif (lit. without serif) designs {{appeared}} relatively {{recently in}} the history of type design. The first, similar to slab serif designs, was shown in 1816 by William Caslon IV. Sans serif fonts are commonly but not exclusively used for display typography such as signage, headings, and other situations demanding legibility above high readability. The text on electronic media offers an exception to print: most web pages and digitized media are laid out in sans serif typefaces because serifs often detract from readability at the low resolution of displays. Many have minimal variation in <b>stroke</b> <b>width,</b> creating the impression of a minimal, simplified design.|$|E
500|$|Kis's typefaces {{were in the}} {{tradition}} of Dutch and German printing developed over the previous century that would later be called the [...] "Dutch taste" [...] (goût hollandois), a term originating from the writings of Pierre Simon Fournier in the next century. This developed the influence of French typefounding such as the typefaces engraved by Claude Garamond with a smooth, even structure and 'e' with a level cross-stroke, by increasing the <b>stroke</b> <b>width,</b> boosting the x-height (height of lower-case letters) and reducing the length of the descenders to achieve a noticeably darker colour on the page.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} an {{off-line}} Japanese signature verification using a pattern matching method. An annoying problem encountered in off-line signature verification using a pattern matching is that variation of signature <b>stroke</b> <b>widths</b> and a registered signature {{selected from a}} set of reference samples affect the verification performance. In this paper, we propose a modified pattern matching method, which is independent of <b>stroke</b> <b>widths,</b> and an appropriate selection method of a registered signature to solve this problem. These methods were experimentally compared with a conventional pattern matching method and a random selection method of a registered signature. Experimental {{results showed that the}} proposed methods improve the verification performance. 1...|$|R

40|$|Because most {{degraded}} {{documents are}} created by people, the preferences individuals have in relation to degraded documents are quite important. Their preferences may {{determine whether or not}} the documents they created are appropriate for machines. The goal {{of this study was to}} find relationships between preference and several parame-ters of a scanner degradation model. It was found that the difference in binarization threshold and the difference in edge displacement caused by the degradation both had strong linear relationships to preference. The width of the point spread function did not show such a relationship. These relationships were counterintuitive because degraded characters with thicker <b>stroke</b> <b>widths</b> than the original were preferred to those that had <b>stroke</b> <b>widths</b> closer to the original character. 1...|$|R

30|$|The left {{column in}} Figure  4 depicts the {{original}} image (a), its gradient SWT image (c), and counter-gradient SWT image (e). We’ll {{refer to them}} as SWT + and SWT −, respectively. Each color in the SWT image corresponds to a particular stroke width; therefore, pixels sharing the same <b>stroke</b> <b>widths</b> are represented with the same color. If we carefully observe both SWT images, we can see that SWT + is more compact and contains less colors compared to SWT −. This is reasonable since SWT + corresponds to the actual text with uniform <b>stroke</b> <b>widths.</b> On the other hand, SWT − corresponds to non-text areas with randomly distributed ‘strokes’. However, {{if we look at the}} right column in Figure  4, the distinction between SWT + and SWT − is not so clear anymore. But still, the given assumption holds for the central region with text ‘ROžA’.|$|R
2500|$|Since the {{introduction}} of the Macintosh in 1984, Apple adopted a new corporate font called Apple Garamond. It was a variation of the classic Garamond typeface, both narrower and having a taller x-height. Specifically, ITC Garamond (created by Tony Stan in 1977) was condensed to 80% of its normal width. Presumably, Apple felt that the existing ITC Garamond Condensed, at 64%, was too narrow. Bitstream condensed the font, subtly adjusted the <b>stroke</b> <b>widths,</b> and performed the hinting required to create the font, which was delivered to Apple as the Postscript font [...] "apgaram".|$|R
5000|$|Scotch Roman typefaces are a serif font, {{suitable}} for both body text and large text such as headings. De Vinne described Scotch Roman as [...] "a small, neat, round letter, with long ascenders, and not noticeably condensed or compressed." [...] They {{can be classified}} as [...] "modern" [...] from their large ball terminals, horizontal serifs, sharply vertical axis and high stroke contrast. Nonetheless, Scotch Romans {{have a number of}} differences from the styles of Bodoni and Didot that are often held to typify the modern genre: the serifs, while very broad and flat, remain bracketed, apertures are frequently narrow, and <b>stroke</b> <b>widths</b> tend to be slightly more modulated.|$|R

50|$|Uniquely for Adobe's {{professional}} typefaces, a {{basic set}} of Utopia's styles has been open-sourced by Adobe, {{allowing it to}} be used for free. This comprises regular, italic, bold and bold italic styles of the regular size, with 229 glyphs for each, including ligatures but not small capitals. Adobe donated the Utopia typeface (in the form of PostScript Type 1 files) to the X Consortium, for use in the X Window System, a popular graphical environment for Unix workstations. Conversions of the Type 1 files to ttf and otf files have also been made. This release is designed for use at small text sizes, with a large x-height and quite thick <b>stroke</b> <b>widths.</b> Adobe retains rights to the Utopia name, and prohibits modified fonts from being redistributed without the name being changed.|$|R

5000|$|The {{ancestor}} of Bookman Old Style is Miller & Richard's [...] "Old Style", cut by Alexander Phemister. Often described as [...] "modernised old style", it is a redesign of [...] "true old-style" [...] serif faces from {{the eighteenth century}} such as Caslon. Like them, it has sloping top serifs and an avoidance of abrupt contrasts in <b>stroke</b> <b>widths.</b> The lower-case letters are quite wide and the x-height (height of lower-case letters) is quite large. Widely resold and pirated, it became a standard typeface and helped to create a genre {{of a wide range}} of loose revivals and adaptations of the Caslon design, visible in the wide-spreading arms of the T and the sharp half-arrow serifs on many letters. (Ronaldson Old Style by Alexander Kay (1884) was another, as was Phemister's own later Franklin, created after he had emigrated.) ...|$|R
