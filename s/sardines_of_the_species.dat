40|$|Temporal {{variation}} in the fatty acid (FA) composition of stomach contents <b>of</b> Iberian <b>sardines</b> was compared to the relative contribution to dietary carbon made by different prey types for Wsh from two areas <b>of</b> Portugal. <b>The</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> FA content <b>of</b> <b>the</b> diet on <b>sardine</b> muscle FA composition was also studied, aiming at (1) analysing if FA biomarkers {{can be used as}} a complementary technique for <b>the</b> study <b>of</b> <b>sardine</b> diet and (2) to relate spatial and temporal variations of prey FA content with sardine condition and reproduction. Significant spatial differences in <b>the</b> FA composition <b>of</b> <b>sardine</b> diet occurred with concentrations of n- 3 polyunsaturated FA, namely eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA, 20 : 5 n- 3] and linolenic acid 18 : 3 n- 3, being signifcantly higher in <b>the</b> diet <b>of</b> <b>sardines</b> from <b>the</b> west coast, whilst <b>the</b> diet <b>of</b> <b>sardines</b> from <b>the</b> south coast was richer in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), namely the carnivory biomarker oleic acid 18 : 1 n- 9. These results are in agreement with the higher contribution made by diatoms and dinoflagellates to <b>the</b> diet <b>of</b> <b>sardines</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> west coast. Spatial {{variation in}} sardine dietary FA was also detected in their muscle composition, specifically for EPA, and the eicosapentaenoic/docosahexaenoic acid and (n- 3) /(n- 6) ratios, which were higher in sardines from the west coast. No difference in FA composition was detected between sexes, and the seasonal variability in sardine total FA concentration was primarily related to <b>the</b> seasonality <b>of</b> spawning. <b>Sardines</b> accumulate high concentrations <b>of</b> FAs during <b>the</b> resting stage <b>of</b> reproduction when <b>the</b> feeding intensity is similar or lower to that observed during the spawning season. Additionally, sardines show a high selective retention of MUFA and polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) throughout the year except at <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spawning season, when these FAs are largely invested in <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gonads. Therefore, temporal and regional diVerences of prey environments are strong enough to be reflected in fish body composition, namely on <b>the</b> accumulation <b>of</b> essential FAs, which can have a strong impact on reproduction success for this species...|$|R
