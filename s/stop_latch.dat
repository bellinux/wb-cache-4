5000|$|The Type 30 carbineor cavalry rifle (...) is a {{modified}} version made 300 mm (11.8 in) shorter than the infantry model (the carbine's barrel measures 480 mm (18.9 in) against 790 mm (31.1 in) for the standard infantry issue). Intended to equip cavalry troops with a modern carbine. Differences other than the shorter barrel and stock from the standard infantry rifle is that it lacked a handguard over the barrel, rear sight ladder only went up to 1,500 meters (compared to the rifles 2,000 meters), front sight had protection guards on each side, slight changes to the bolt <b>stop</b> <b>latch</b> and the sling swivels were moved {{to the left side}} of the gun to prevent the bolt from digging into the cavalry trooper's back. The pre-production version lacked a bayonet.|$|E
5000|$|Latch gate : A block {{inside the}} channel of the handles <b>stopping</b> the <b>latch</b> from {{impacting}} the blade.|$|R
40|$|Built-in safety {{mechanism}} for tractor-trailer "fifth-wheel" coupling keeps rig together in case kingpin failure. Modified coupling utilizes all standard components, such as two wear plates, kingpin, and kingpin latch. It is modified by adding semicircular lip to top wear plate, matching semicircular slot to bottom wear plate, and two <b>latching</b> <b>stop</b> mechanisms...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the example}} {{presented}} here the first delay line {{affiliated with the}} start signal contains cells of D-flip-flops with delay [...] which are initially set to transparent. During the transition of the start signal through one of those cells, the signal is delayed by [...] {{and the state of}} the flip-flop is sampled as transparent. The second delay line belonging to the stop signal is composed of a series of non-inverting buffers with delay [...] Propagating through its channel the <b>stop</b> signal <b>latches</b> the flip-flops of the start signal's delay line. As soon as the stop signal passes the start signal, the latter is stopped and all leftover flip-flops are sampled opaque. Analogous to the above case of the oscillators the wanted time interval [...] is then ...|$|R
5000|$|In general a tapped {{delay line}} {{contains}} a number of cells with well defined delay times [...] Propagating through this line the start signal is delayed. The state of the line is sampled {{at the time of}} the arrival of the stop signal.This can be realized for example with a line of D-flip-flop cells with a delay time [...] The start signal propagates through this line of transparent flip-flops and is delayed by a certain number of them. The output of each flip-flop is sampled on the fly. The <b>stop</b> signal <b>latches</b> all flip-flops while propagating through its channel undelayed and the start signal cannot propagate further. Now the time interval between start and stop signal is proportional to the number of flip-flops that were sampled as transparent.|$|R
50|$|When a {{turn-off}} {{negative voltage}} signal {{is applied to}} the MOSFET connected to the cathode, it turns off and transfers all the current away from the cathode (N-emitter of the NPN transistor in the thyristor) into the base gate via MOSFET connected to the gate of the thyristor. This <b>stops</b> regenerative <b>latching</b> process and results in a fast turn-off. Both the MOSFET connected to the cathode and MOSFET connected to the gate of the thyristor are not subjected to high-voltage stresses irrespective of the magnitude of the voltage on the ETO, due to the internal structure of the thyristor containing a P-N junction. The drawback of connecting a MOSFET in series is that it has to carry the main thyristor current and it also increases the total voltage drop by about 0.3 to 0.5V and its corresponding losses. Similar to a GTO, the ETO has a long turn-off tail of current {{at the end of the}} turn-off and the next turn-on must wait until the residual charge on the anode side is dissipated through the recombination process.|$|R
50|$|As {{the card}} was being read and {{positioned}} for printing, a ‘mechanical bail’ driven by large steel cams would raise 60 geared ‘lifter bars’ which engaged 60 ‘racks’ which engaged 60 ‘intermediate gears’, which drove 60 ‘print wheels’. (You {{can see the}} maintenance problem with 60 of just about everything). The lifter bars were then lowered under spring tension by the ‘mechanical bail’ {{in time with the}} reading of the punched card. Using the impulse from the ‘contact roll’ / ‘card brush’ / ‘wire contact relay’ circuitry, a ‘push rod’ would <b>latch</b> (<b>stop)</b> the individual ‘lifter bar’ on its downward motion with the character to be printed correctly positioned on the print wheel and facing 1 of 60 ‘print hammers’. An ‘alignment bail’ would then seat itself in between the teeth of the ‘print wheels’ to perform vertical alignment.|$|R
