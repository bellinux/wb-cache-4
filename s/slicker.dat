5|$|The changes seen {{in series}} VII were {{seen by some}} as a disappointment; while much <b>slicker</b> and higher-budget in appearance, the shift away from {{outright}} sitcom and into something approaching comedy drama was seen as a move in the wrong direction. Furthermore, the attempt to shift back into traditional sitcom format for series VIII was greeted with a response that was similarly lukewarm. There was criticism aimed at the decision to resurrect the entire crew of Red Dwarf, as it was felt this detracted from the series' central premise of Lister being the last human being alive. There are other critics who feel that series VII and VIII are no weaker than the earlier series, however, and the topic is the subject of constant fervent debate among the show's fanbase.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Slickers</b> {{centred on}} Derrick Crooks, {{who had been}} one of the {{founding}} members of The Pioneers along with his brother Sydney. In the mid-1960s, The <b>Slickers</b> consisted of the Crooks brothers and Winston Bailey. Derrick was the only constant member, with Abraham Green joining the Crooks brothers at the time [...] "Johnny Too Bad" [...] was recorded. The <b>Slickers</b> have often been wrongly assumed to simply be an alias for The Pioneers due to their similar vocal stylings. The <b>Slickers</b> toured the United Kingdom and United States on the back of the success of [...] "Johnny Too Bad", and continued until 1979, when they recorded the Breakthrough album, before splitting up.|$|R
25|$|Many changes {{occurred}} in the series after the first 12 issues; the use of newsprint was abandoned in favor of <b>slicker</b> paper with higher color intensity. Artist Michael Golden was also replaced. Murray left when changes in editorial policies took place. Don Daley took over and wanted to include superheroes and not continue the series in real-time.

25|$|Soul music {{dominated}} the U.S. R chart in the 1960s, and many recordings crossed {{over into the}} pop charts in the U.S., Britain and elsewhere. By 1968, the soul music genre had begun to splinter. Some soul artists developed funk music, while other singers and groups developed <b>slicker,</b> more sophisticated, {{and in some cases}} more politically conscious varieties. By the early 1970s, soul music had been influenced by psychedelic rock and other genres, leading to psychedelic soul. The United States saw the development of neo soul around 1994. There are also several other subgenres and offshoots of soul music.|$|E
25|$|Walt Disney's last {{script for}} the strip {{appeared}} May 17, 1930. Gottfredson's first {{task was to}} finish the storyline Disney had started on April 1, 1930. The storyline was completed on September 20, 1930, and later reprinted in comic book form as Mickey Mouse in Death Valley. This early adventure expanded the cast of the strip which to this point only included Mickey and Minnie. Among the characters who had their first comic strip appearances in this story were Clarabelle Cow, Horace Horsecollar, and Black Pete {{as well as the}} debuts of corrupted lawyer Sylvester Shyster and Minnie's uncle Mortimer Mouse. The Death Valley narrative was followed by Mr. <b>Slicker</b> and the Egg Robbers, first printed between September 22 and December 26, 1930, which introduced Marcus Mouse and his wife as Minnie's parents.|$|E

500|$|Reflecting on Bacon's {{tendency}} to revisit subject matter, Meades observed that [...] "Bacon's auto-plagiarism in areas other than portraiture had less deleterious consequences. Nonetheless the 1988 version (or near copy) {{of the great}} 1944 Crucifixion Triptych is the lesser work: it is <b>slicker,</b> more polished and it evinces a greater ease with paint. The backgrounds are now elaborated, defined and bereft of the garish, grating poison orange of 1944." [...] The art critic James Demetrion found that despite these differences, the second version still achieves the power and impact of the first.|$|E

500|$|DJ Hero 2 {{was well}} {{received}} by critics, who felt {{the game was}} a significant improvement in both gameplay, presentation, and song selection from its predecessor.

Keza MacDonald of Eurogamer believed that DJ Hero 2 was [...] "much <b>slicker,</b> clearer and more tasteful" [...] with changes in presentation and interface that quickly allows the players to jump into the game. Ben Kuchera of Ars Technica called the title [...] "the best kind of sequel" [...] as it retained the best features of DJ Hero and added further improvements atop of those. Matt Wales of IGN noted that the early difficulty levels of the game were much more suited to beginners [...] "to make for a more convincing DJing experience, without sacrificing that all-important accessibility".|$|E

The interspersion of thoroughly heavy metal sections within the otherwise widescreen rock of 'Grand Unification Pt I' and 'Sleep Well Tonight' encapsulates this perfectly". One Day Son, This Will All Be Yours showed the band expanding their sound and pushing further into both lighter and heavier territories, {{with a mixture of}} more melodic soundscapes and heavier metallic styles. According to Q magazine, [...] "The intricate instrumental passages, multi-tracked vocal harmonies and pounding riffs hint at Muse-scale ambition and intellect". The Sun described One Day Son, This Will All Be Yours sound as [...] "heavier, <b>slicker</b> and as focused as ever, tracks such as '99' and 'We Apologise For Nothing' embrace an epic, panoramic sound that sweeps you off your feet. It’s aggressive but emotive, with heaps of melody among the huge riffs." ...|$|E

500|$|By 1999, the duo {{was well}} into the {{recording}} sessions for its second album, which had begun a year earlier. The 2001 release of Discovery took on a <b>slicker</b> and distinctly synthpop-oriented style, initially stunning fans of Daft Punk's previous material in Homework. The group states that the album was conceived {{as an attempt to}} reconnect with a playful, open-minded attitude associated with the discovery phase of childhood. This accounts for the heavy use of themes and samples from the late '70s to early '80s era on the album. The album reached No. 2 in the United Kingdom, and its single, [...] "One More Time", was a major club and mainstream hit that nearly topped the UK Singles Chart. The song is well known for being heavily autotuned and compressed. The song and album created a new generation of fans mainly familiar with the second Daft Punk release. The singles [...] "Digital Love" [...] and [...] "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger" [...] were also very successful in the UK and on the United States dance chart. [...] "Digital Love" [...] was subsequently covered by the bands Kodaline and Hellogoodbye. The song [...] "Face to Face" [...] hit No. 1 on the USA club play charts. A 45-minute excerpt from a Daftendirektour performance recorded at Birmingham, UK in 1997 was also released in 2001, titled Alive 1997. The year 2003 saw the release of the feature-length animated film, [...] Daft Punk produced the film under the supervision of Leiji Matsumoto, who is their childhood hero.
