Also, the potential saving in chlorine dioxide was assessed. The enzyme treatment was performed on pulp containing some black liquor since the operating conditions were close to the conditions used in the <b>storage</b> <b>tower</b> in Fibria, identified as the most suitable point for application. The greatest differences in kappa number and hexenuronic acid content were observed after the X stage. Whereas, in brightness were observed after the Z stage. The effluent properties from the X stage were higher with the enzyme treatments. Also, the enzymes allowed chlorine dioxide consumption in the bleaching stage to be reduced. The control pulp contained twice as much adsorbable organic halides (AOX) and exhibited twice more brightness reversion than did the enzyme-treated samples.

40|$|To {{obtain a}} more {{realistic}} appraisal of the potential efficiency of xylanases in the industrial bleaching, the influence of pH {{and the presence of}} black liquor (measured as COD) on the bleaching efficiency of two commercial xylanases was studied at high temperature. These pH’s, CODs, and temperatures are close to those used in the <b>storage</b> <b>tower</b> of the B fiber line in Jacareı´ unit of Fibria (Brazil). The pulp samples obtained after each bleaching stage were analyzed for kappa number, brightness, viscosity, and hexenuronic acid content, and so were the effluents for COD, TOC, color, turbidity, and pH after the enzymatic stage. On the basis of the results, the xylanases were found to increase pulp brightness in the treatment involving the most unfavorable conditions (viz. high COD and pH). However, an initial COD above 9 kgO 2 t- 1 and/or a pH higher than 9. 5 detracted from their bleaching efficiency. The effect on the kappa number and hexenuronic acids content of the pulp was apparent immediately after the enzymatic stage, and the most marked increase in brightness was observed after the chlorine dioxide stage.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: A 1993 large {{water-borne}} {{outbreak of}} Salmonella typhimurium infections in Gideon, Mo, {{a city of}} 1100 with an unchlorinated community water supply, was investigated to determine the source of contamination {{and the effectiveness of}} an order to boil water. METHODS: A survey of household members in Gideon and the surrounding township produced information on diarrheal illness, water consumption, and compliance with the boil water order. RESULTS: More than 650 persons were ill; 15 were hospitalized, and 7 died. Persons consuming city water {{were more likely to be}} ill (relative risk [RR] = 9. 1, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 2. 9, 28. 4), and the attack rate increased with increased water consumption. S. typhimurium was recovered from samples taken from a city fire hydrant and a water <b>storage</b> <b>tower.</b> Persons in 31 % (30 / 98) of city households had drunk unboiled water after being informed about the boil water order, including 14 individuals who subsequently became ill.

40|$|Lecturepg. 49 A {{case history}} is {{presented}} pertaining to piping vibrations {{in a medium}} consistency paper pulp pumping system at a large North American integrated pulp and paper mill that ultimately resulted in pipe rupture. The system was designed to transfer pulp at 12 percent oven-dry consistency (12 percent fiber- 88 percent water by mass) from a washer stage to a <b>storage</b> <b>tower</b> through nearly 700 ft of 20 in diameter pipe. Testing and analyses were performed on the system to diagnose the problem and develop a solution to reduce the piping vibrations and prevent further failures. Initial tests on the system indicated the piping had pressure pulsations of between 50 psi and 100 psi peak-to-peak which were exerting a shaking force of approximately 15, 000 lb to 30, 000 lb peak-to-peak at each seventeen 90 degree elbows in the piping system. The frequencies of the major pressure pulsations were at 1. 3 Hz and 3. 8 Hz, which corresponds to the one-quarter and three-quarter (closed-open piping system) standing pressure waves in the piping system. These forces produced by the pulsation caused the piping system to respond at the natural frequencies of the pipe and support structure at each section of the pipe system. Attempts to reduce the amplitudes at the standing wave frequencies with attenuators (valve or shear plates) {{at the end of}} the pipeline were not successful due to the natures of the pulp and flow pulsation problems. Some success was achieved by changing the standing wave (acoustic) frequency with the addition of gas to the pulp in order to change the bulk density, but this was deemed an impractical solution. The problem was diagnosed as an interaction between the control system and the piping system. The source of the pulsation energy was traced to the control valve location immediately downstream of the centrifugal pump. Strouhal vortex shedding frequencies were generated at the exit of the control valve ball which excited acoustic standing waves in this particular piping system and amplified the pressure pulsations. Evidence is presented that shows that the pulsation amplitude was dependent upon the valve ball position and motion; therefore, the valve was removed and an alternate method of system control with a different mechanism was used that eliminated the source of the harmful pulsations. The authors present application guidelines intended to assist the reader in evaluating pipe system designs for potential of standing wave excitation. The Strouhal vortex energy from the control valve is discussed. Also, the calculation of acoustic velocity is covered including the effects of temperature, entrained air, and pulp consistency...|$|E
