25|$|Despite {{how much}} energy he put into this venture, which {{he hoped would}} bring him some {{commercial}} success, Kees found time to produce a fine series of collages. He even had two more one-man shows in New York City as well as shows in San Francisco, including an impressive installation at the California Palace of the Legion of Honor. He had also exchanged his film camera for a <b>still</b> <b>camera,</b> and began taking the photographs that would illustrate the book Nonverbal Communication (Berkeley:, University of California Press, 1956), which he wrote with Jurgen Ruesch, psychiatrist and semiotician. Many of these photographs would qualify as art photography as well as scientific data.|$|E
500|$|Like Crazy {{was filmed}} over four weeks—the first three in Los Angeles {{and the last}} in London. The {{production}} budget was $250,000, which included the cost of airfares for the cast and crew. The film was shot on a Canon EOS 7D <b>still</b> <b>camera</b> with cinema lenses, mounted on a rig constructed by cinematographer John Guleserian. He chose the 7D for its portability and the ease it provided for shooting improvised scenes, where he found other cameras too cumbersome. Guleserian said {{that many of the}} film's scenes were shot [...] "really far away from our characters [...] really tight close ups" [...] due to the technological limitations of the camera, but he noted that this added to the tone of the film.|$|E
500|$|The film's {{images were}} stored on a 1GB image card that {{was capable of}} holding {{approximately}} 100 frames of animation. Eight roving camera teams—each team including a lighting cameraman, an assistant, a lighting electrician and a set dresser to deal with any art department issues—worked with the animators to set up shots. Each camera team had a [...] "lighting station" [...] workstation—comprising an Apple G4 computer and a monitor to assist in checking lighting and framing—to view TIFF file versions of the camera's images. Once a shot was approved, the computer was removed and the animators were left to shoot the scene using their <b>still</b> <b>camera</b> and [...] "grabber" [...] computer/camera system to check their work. The film's story department head Jeffrey Lynch explained that the scenes were developed initially from storyboards created by a team, saying: [...] "We shot {{as close to a}} 1:1 film ratio [...] as we could because {{there was no time for}} reshoots. We did most of our experimentation in the storyboard process—as many ways as needed—to get the scene how we wanted it. There was no coverage, as there would be for a live-action film." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- The use {{of digital}} video <b>cameras</b> and digital <b>still</b> <b>cameras</b> is {{becoming}} widespread. Digital video cameras differ from digital <b>still</b> <b>cameras</b> {{in a number}} of respects. Digital video cameras capture approximately thirty frames per second and are optimized to capture a large amount of moving images, but sacrifice image quality. <b>Still</b> digital <b>cameras</b> are less expensive because they have far less processing power and memory capacity than digital video cameras. Even with these limitations, some <b>still</b> digital <b>cameras</b> are also capable of capturing sequential images, such as a burst image. Accordingly, what is needed is a method and system for interactively creating a VIDEO from one or more still images...|$|R

500|$|The {{film was}} {{originally}} {{supposed to have}} been shot on film, though a last-minute change by the studio helped introduce a different technology. In 1997, during pre-production on Henry Selick's feature, Monkeybone, the film's cinematographer Pete Kozachik was looking for a type of filming that would streamline the process of integrating stop-motion characters with pre-filmed live actors. After finishing Monkeybone, Kozachik continued to test cameras for a practical means of shooting feature animation digitally. In early 2003, the production unit was not interested in digital capture for stop motion; the team was instead prepping the movie for a film shoot. Two weeks before filming was to begin, Kozachik and visual effects consultant Chris Watts came up with a solution using digital still cameras that was deemed viable by Warner Bros. senior vice president of physical production and visual effects Chris DeFaria. The production then became digital. After testing a dozen different models, Kozachik opted for a basic digital <b>still</b> <b>camera,</b> the Canon EOS-1D Mark II, an off-the-shelf model that was outfitted with adapters to allow the use of Nikon prime lenses (14mm-105mm). Kozachik spoke about why he chose the camera, saying: [...] "One reason I went with this particular camera is that its image chip is just about the same size as Super 35 film negative, so we could use Nikon lenses and treat them like regular 35mm cine lenses and get the same effect—the same depth of field and angle of coverage. I knew {{that we were going to}} be fighting to make this look like a 'real' movie because we weren't shooting on film, so I wanted to at least have the optics look like movie optics." ...|$|E

50|$|A {{half-frame camera}} is a camera using a film format at half the {{intended}} exposure format. A common variety is the 18&times;24 mm format on regular 135 film. It is the normal exposure format on 35mm movie <b>cameras.</b> For <b>still</b> <b>cameras</b> using the 35mm film, the usual format is 24&times;36 mm, so <b>still</b> <b>cameras</b> taking 18&times;24 mm exposures are called half-frame cameras.|$|R
5000|$|Systems using regular <b>still</b> <b>cameras</b> {{mounted on}} RC {{helicopters}} (Photogrammetry) are also possible, and cost around €25,000. Systems that use <b>still</b> <b>cameras</b> with balloons are even cheaper (around €2,500), but require additional manual processing.

2500|$|The movie {{camera is}} a type of {{photographic}} camera which takes a rapid sequence of photographs on recording medium. In contrast to a <b>still</b> <b>camera,</b> which captures a single snapshot at a time, the movie camera takes a series of images, each called a [...] "frame". This is accomplished through an intermittent mechanism. The frames are later played back in a movie projector at a specific speed, called the [...] "frame rate" [...] (number of frames per second). While viewing, a person's eyes and brain merge the separate pictures together to create the illusion of motion.|$|E

Before {{beginning}} a final half-lap unique fly, pilot Doug Hurley paused the shuttle by firing thrusters {{for a moment and}} during this time the space station changed its orientation by rotating 90 degrees to the right. That gave Atlantis crew a good opportunity to take <b>still</b> <b>camera</b> photographs and shoot video of station areas not normally documented in previous shuttle fly-arounds. The images are expected to help experts on the ground to get additional information on the station's conditions. The half-lap fly around which began around 7:30 UTC was completed about 25 minutes later.|$|E

2500|$|Revelers {{and vendors}} who usually {{frequent}} Mardi Gras on Galveston Island have {{concerns that the}} admission fee will bring fewer attendees along with financial uncertainty when the Park Board sold admission tickets prior to the 2008 season. The March 5, 2011 Knights of Momus Parade attracted 20,000 revelers within the Strand while the crowd estimate during the entire Mardi Gras season is 250,000. Vendors and Downtown Galveston businesses have reported a drop in their sales despite the promoter bringing more live music, parades, and added security which includes metal detectors and bag checks. As a downside, Yaga's Entertainment Inc. incorporated {{the rules and regulations}} modeled on Mardi Gras DFW – including a prohibition on professional video and <b>still</b> <b>camera</b> equipment within the Strand Entertainment District because of the production of live entertainment from national touring or band acts. Ticket sales for the first weekend of the 2012 season dropped to 30% during the first weekend despite the numerous complaints [...] vented at Yaga's Entertainment, Inc. - Dean stated that the admission charge will remain indefinitely until the existing 5-year contract with the City of Galveston is up for renewal. Admission pricing at the entry gates averaged $17 where discounted $8 tickets were available from the Yaga's Entertainment Inc. website (www.YagasPresents.com). Decreased ticket revenue was also attributed to the cold temperatures and high winds on the first weekend, and heavy precipitation on the second weekend - changes for the 2013 season would include contingency planning where events can be rescheduled by time shifts.|$|E
2500|$|Vincent {{was also}} spotted mid-air by Deryl Stone, a Chief Ranger for the National Park Service. Stone {{reported}} seeing Vincent grab his parachute after landing and run {{to a nearby}} car, which quickly drove away. However, authorities were able to detain two men on the ground who had been videotaping the jump. Stone said 37-year-old Ronald Carroll and 27-year-old Robert Weinzetl, both St. Louis residents, were found with a wireless communication headset and a video camera, {{as well as a}} <b>still</b> <b>camera</b> with a telephoto lens. The two were also charged with two misdemeanors: disorderly conduct and commercial photography in a national park. Vincent later turned himself in and initially pleaded not guilty to the charges against him. However, he eventually accepted a guilty plea deal in which he testified against Carroll and Weinzetl, revealing that the two consented to recording the jump during a meeting of all three on the day before his stunt occurred. Federal magistrate judge David D. Noce ruled on January 28, 1993, that Carroll had been involved in a conspiracy and was guilty of both misdemeanor charges; the charges against Weinzetl had been dropped by federal attorneys. In his decision, Noce stated, [...] "There are places in our country where the sufficiently skilled can savor the exhilaration and personal satisfaction of accomplishing courageous and intrepid acts, of reaching dreamed-of heights and for coursing dangerous adventures," [...] but added that other places are designed for [...] "the exhilaration of mere observation and for the appreciation of the imaginings and the works of others. The St. Louis Arch and the grounds of the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial are in the latter category." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Stephen Shore's [...] "Factory: Andy Warhol," [...] "Andy and I {{were hanging}} around together. I had an {{apartment}} on the Lower East Side, where I had haircutting salons. Hundreds of people would come, and I’d be cutting someone's hair. Andy came. When he first started making films, he made films about what a person was famous for," [...] Billy, whose real name was William Linich Jr., and {{was the son of}} a barber, recalled. [...] "I was famous for giving haircuts, so he said, [...] "Would you let me do a film of you doing haircuts?" [...] I had covered my entire apartment in silver foil and painted everything silver. Andy said, [...] "Well, I just got a new loft would you do to it what you’ve done to your apartment?" [...] I said, [...] "Oh, sure, let's do it." [...] So, I started doing it. I was a technician— I’d been a light designer for [...] the Judson Church. I also worked for some off-Broadway theater and avant-garde dance companies. I installed all the lighting at the Factory, all the sound systems." [...] In return for making over his loft, Warhol gave Name a new role within the Factory. [...] "I was into light and sound before, but not photography," [...] Name said. [...] "Andy had a <b>still</b> <b>camera,</b> but he had gotten the Bolex. He was going to start to do films, and he gave me the Pentax and said, [...] "Here, Billy, you do the still photography; I’m going to start making films." [...] I became the in-house photographer and was sort of like the foreman. Eventually I moved in." [...] Name and Warhol eventually became lovers, but the romantic aspect of their relationship slowly dissolved into mutual loyalty and admiration.|$|E

40|$|Digital <b>still</b> <b>cameras</b> {{have been}} widely adopted for close range {{photogrammetry}} and machine vision applications. Due to the advantages of on board storage of digital images, portability and rapid data processing, digital <b>still</b> <b>cameras</b> have virtually replaced medium format film cameras for measurement tasks such as structural monitoring and industrial metrology. As for any photogrammetric application, {{the accuracy of the}} derived object data is dependent on the accuracy of the camera calibration, amongst many other factors. For photogrammetric applications in which accuracy is not of paramount importance or the object is larger than a few metres in size, use of a simple model of lens distortion in conjunction with the collinearity equations is sufficient. However, the combination of very close ranges and the large distortions typically associated with the lenses used with digital <b>still</b> <b>cameras</b> requires an extended lens model to account for variation of distortion within the object space. The fidelity of the calibration model becomes particularly important where stringent tolerances are set, for example in aerospace inspection tasks. This paper reviews previous research into distortion variation and outlines an investigation of the modelling of this systematic error. The calibration procedure, utilising a straight line calibration range, is described. Experimental results for Kodak DCS 420 and DCS 460 digital <b>still</b> <b>cameras,</b> including an assessment of the effect and repeatability of the distortion variation, are presented. 1...|$|R
