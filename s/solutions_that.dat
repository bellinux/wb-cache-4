5|$|An ancient {{solution}} to a flow problem is a curve whose evolution can be extrapolated backwards for all time, without singularities. All of the self-similar <b>solutions</b> <b>that</b> shrink or stay the same size rather than growing are ancient solutions in this sense; they can be extrapolated backwards by reversing the self-similarity transformation that they would undergo by the forwards curve-shortening flow. Thus, for instance, the circle, grim reaper, and Abresch–Langer curves are all ancient solutions.|$|E

40|$|Peleg (1986) and Tadenuma (1992) provide two {{well-known}} ax-iomatic {{characterizations of}} the core on the domain of balanced TU games. Peleg’s characterization says that the core is the only <b>solution</b> <b>that</b> satisfies non-emptiness, individual rationality, super-additivity, and a reduced game property introduced by Davis and Maschler (1965). Tadenuma’s characterization says that the core is the only <b>solution</b> <b>that</b> satisfies non-emptiness, individual rationality and a reduced game property introduced by Moulin (1985). In this note, we investigate {{what happens when the}} domain is restricted to the class of convex TU games. In particular, we show that (i) the core is not the only <b>solution</b> <b>that</b> satisfies Peleg’s four axioms and anonymity; (ii) the core is the only <b>solution</b> <b>that</b> satisfies Peleg’s four axioms, anonymity, and additional three axioms; and (iii) the core is not the only <b>solution</b> <b>that</b> satisfies Tadenuma’s three axioms and anonymity. ...|$|R

The audio system generates engine sounds inside the vehicle through the audio system.

5|$|The {{number of}} {{distinct}} solutions {{can also be}} identified with Burnside's Lemma. For a solution, the set of equivalent solutions which can be reached using these operations (excluding relabeling), form an orbit of the symmetric group. The number of essentially different solutions is then the number of orbits, which can be computed using Burnside's lemma. The Burnside fixed points are <b>solutions</b> <b>that</b> differ only by relabeling. Using this technique, Jarvis/Russell computed the number of essentially different (symmetrically distinct) solutions as 5,472,730,538.|$|E

According to the Cayley–Hamilton theorem, pA(A) = 0, that is, the result of substituting the matrix itself into its own characteristic polynomial yields the zero matrix.|$|E
5|$|This is a {{dissection}} puzzle {{similar to}} a Tangram, and the treatise describing it was found in more complete form in the Archimedes Palimpsest.

Dr. Netz calculates that the pieces can be made into a square 17,152 ways. The number of arrangements is 536 when <b>solutions</b> <b>that</b> are equivalent by rotation and reflection have been excluded.

Porosity and brittleness were the primary problems, and the <b>solutions</b> <b>that</b> developed included the use of hydrogen, argon, and helium as welding atmospheres. During the following decade, further advances allowed for the welding of reactive metals like aluminum and magnesium. This in conjunction with developments in automatic welding, alternating current, and fluxes fed a major expansion of arc welding during the 1930s and then during World War II. In 1930, the first all-welded merchant vessel, M/S Carolinian, was launched.|$|E
5|$|Operational design {{management}} involves {{the management of}} individual design projects and design teams. Its goal is to achieve the objectives set by strategic {{design management}}. Success of good design management can be measured by {{evaluating the quality of}} operational design management outcomes. It includes the selection and management of design suppliers and encompasses the documentation, supervision, and evaluation of design processes and results. It deals with personal leadership, emotional intelligence, and the cooperation with and management of internal communications. Regular management functions, tools, and concepts can often be applied to the management of design on the operational level. It is implemented to achieve specific design objectives and manage the judgment of design proposals. It can help to build brand equity through the consistent creation and implementation of high-quality design <b>solutions</b> <b>that</b> best fit the brand identity and desired consumer experience, in the most efficient way. Depending on the type of company and industry, the following job titles are associated with this role: operational design manager, senior designer, team leader, visual communication manager, corporate design coordinator, and others.|$|E
5|$|The two {{roots of}} any {{quadratic}} equation {{may be of}} three possible types: two different real numbers, two identical real numbers (i.e., a degenerate double root), or a pair of complex conjugate roots. The first case corresponds to the usual situation; each pair of roots corresponds {{to a pair of}} <b>solutions</b> <b>that</b> are related by circle inversion, as described below (Figure6). In the second case, both roots are identical, corresponding to a solution circle that transforms into itself under inversion. In this case, one of the given circles is itself a solution to the Apollonius problem, and the number of distinct solutions is reduced by one. The third case of complex conjugate radii does not correspond to a geometrically possible solution for Apollonius' problem, since a solution circle cannot have an imaginary radius; therefore, the number of solutions is reduced by two. Interestingly, Apollonius' problem cannot have seven solutions, although it may have any other number of solutions from zero to eight.|$|E

5|$|When {{the time}} came {{for the company to}} develop a new broiler, it turned to its {{equipment}} manufacturer, Nieco, and St. Louis, Missouri-based Duke Manufacturing. Burger King's goal was to maintain the company's trademark flame broiling method while allowing more product options on a flexible cooking platform. The <b>solutions</b> <b>that</b> Nieco and Duke devised met that goal by using control features during cooking. The cooking methods employed by the two manufacturing companies vary in their methods; Nieco employed two chains, one that maintained a single speed and cooking temperature, and another that had a flexible speed setting and variable temperature control. Duke's solution utilizes an oven that cooks according to preset parameters for time and temperature, one heterogeneous product batch at a time. The first batch-style broiler was introduced in April 1999 and was tested in-store in central Wisconsin during the summer of 1999.|$|E
