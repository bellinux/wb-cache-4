50|$|Although after World War I and the Polish-Bolshevist War Poland {{inherited}} a sizeable arms industry, the Polish Army also had large stocks of military equipment. As domestic orders for new weaponry dwindled, Polish arms industry {{tried to find}} new clients abroad, mostly in Romania, Yugoslavia and Turkey. Simultaneously, the Polish Army also tried to sell surplus war materiel to those states, both {{as a means of}} obtaining funds for further modernisation of the armed forces, and as a means of strengthening Poland's political influence in Central Europe. Initially the private companies tried to compete on their own while the government's efforts were directed by head of Army Administration Office, Gen. Mieczysław Norwid-Neugebauer. The private companies tried to join forces by forming a Section of Military Industry (Sekcja Przemysłu Wojennego, SPW) lobbying group as part of the Metal Industry Exporters Union, but European markets of early 1920s were filled with surplus rifles, bullets and artillery pieces and the <b>sales</b> <b>drive</b> brought little effects.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} how short-sale {{constraints}} affect asset price and market efficiency. We consider a fully rational expectations equilibrium model, in which investors trade for two reasons, to share risk and {{to speculate on}} private information, but they face short-sale constraints. Short-sale constraints limit both types of trades, and thus reduce the allocational and informational efficiency of the market. Limiting short <b>sales</b> <b>driven</b> by risk-sharing simply shifts the demand for the asset upwards and consequently its price. We show that {{in the presence of}} information asymmetry, limiting short <b>sales</b> <b>driven</b> by private information increases the uncertainty about the asset as perceived by uninformed investors, which reduces the demand for the asset. When this information effect dominates, short-sale constraints actually cause asset prices to decrease and price volatility to increase. Moreover, we show that shortsale constraints can give rise to discrete price drops accompanied by increases in volatility when the uncertainty perceived by uninformed investors surges in certain states...|$|R
5000|$|The Steelman is a six-wheel {{shaft drive}} loco of 450 to 750 bhp. The first Steelman {{utilised}} the Rolls-Royce DV8TCA rated at 608 bhp at 1800 rpm and utilised a 2-speed [...] "warm change" [...] Wiseman transfer gearbox, giving the loco {{a top speed}} of 40 mph. The follow-on 4 locos - 3 with the Rolls-Royce DV8N (445 bhp) at 52tons and one with the DV8TCE (650 bhp) at 60tons - had re-designed bodywork and single speed transfer gearboxes. All five went to the British Steel Corporation. Rolls expected to develop 2-axle versions to replace the Sentinel models but the sale of Class 14 locos from BR adversely affected the market and without the volume of sales, higher unit costs precluded further development. Following Rolls-Royce's exit from loco building Thomas Hill took over the design, though resistance to it from Thomas Hill (senior) prevented it being offered until long after he'd retired, hence the regressive [...] "Titan" [...] design. The first two TH Steelman locos were built for ICI in 1984, and a <b>sales</b> <b>drive</b> within British Steel Ravenscraig resulted in their taking both the original 60Ton Steelman and the last of the production batch, which had meantime been the Varlen USA demonstrator and returned. Subsequently, Ravenscraig bought 2 new Steelman 60T 6w's using the Cat 3412, which power unit was also installed into a 75ton version for ARC Whatley Quarry.|$|E

EVE Online players are able to donate the game's in-game currency, which will be converted into real-world money and given to the Red Cross, and players of select Facebook games by Zynga, such as FarmVille and CityVille, can purchase special in-game items, whose profits would go to helping support the Japanese relief effort. 36 hours in, Zynga has collected approximately $1.35 million. ScrewAttack announced that all profits made from their game, Texting of the Bread, would go to the American Red Cross. NEXON Corporation announced that all profits made from specific in-game items for sale in their games, such as MapleStory, will go to the relief effort. American developer and publisher PopCap Games, in partnership with the Red Cross, discounted its entire line of iOS games and pledged to donate all proceeds to relief efforts.

40|$|A {{groundbreaking}} {{guide to}} increasing sales and profits by reestablishing {{the primacy of}} marketing, from three leading experts. Why are some companies {{able to focus on}} the important points, while others fight internal battles, obsess over trivia, and let opportunities pass them by? According to Hulbert, Capon, and Piercy, when companies succeed it is often because every single person in every department [...] from Sales to Human Resources to Finance [...] has one paramount goal: to win and keep customers. Many of today's companies, however, have not heeded this crucial message. When they falter, it is often {{due to the fact that}} different departments report to different executives: then short-term goals like <b>sales</b> <b>drive</b> out the long-term necessity of marketing. Despite lip service to the contrary, the marketing departments of most companies often fail to reach their most important customers. Drawing on their combined experience of three-quarters of a century advising corporations, Hulbert, Capon, and Piercy argue that marketing must be dragged out of the marketing department. Indeed, it must become the top priority of the CEO, who automatically sets the tone for the entire company. The solution, the authors demonstrate, is to integrate the marketing imperative into every function of a corporation: finance, operations, sales, R&D, customer service, and human resources. This total marketing strategy has proven hugely successful for companies such as Intel, Canadian Pacific Hotels, Safeway, and Toyota. Total Integrated Marketing provides an essential framework for designing and managing change so that companies can outperform their rivals. Containing a wealth of marketing tips and innovations easily adapted to any business, this is essential reading for all managers concerned about the future of their companies...|$|E
40|$|The {{literature}} on Object-Oriented software development processes {{has proposed a}} lifecycle which is often found to {{be at odds with}} the established software engineering processes of organizations. In particular, more established software engineering processes at higher CMM (Capability Maturity Model) levels often have deep roots in the ‘Waterfall ’ lifecycle Some of these mature processes might be evolving into legacy processes. The emerging Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK) is more appropriate than the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) as a course of study for potential project managers of software projects. PMBOK has a tendency to emphasize scope management and task decomposition, while SWEBOK focus on requirements analysis and architectural design. Recent developments in Object-Oriented software engineering assert that an emphasis on requirements rather than scope, and on architecture rather than tasks leads to superior software development processes. Specifically, organizations should not demand detailed fixed scope, cost and schedule plans {{at the beginning of a}} significant software development effort. There is a lesson to be learn from the building industry, which allocates up to half of the overall development time to architectural design, and does not create a controlled project environment until the construction phase. When developing e-commerce applications, requirements analysis and system architecture remain critical, but they should be expanded to a broader context. The business plan replaces a project plan in e-commerce; marketing (and even <b>sales)</b> <b>drive</b> requirements analysis; and architectural design should be broadened to include infrastructure design. E-commerce system design encompasses system-wide issues, including hardware, networks, purchased components and partnerships, as well as interfaces with back-end fulfillment and collection capabilities...|$|E

40|$|The {{demands on}} {{accountability}} within marketing investments are increasing. These demands have developed <b>sales</b> <b>driven</b> marketing, where {{the focus is}} on accurate key-figures such as ROI, return on investment, and CPA, cost per acquisition. Traditionally, companies have been satisfied knowing that they had a certain amount of visitors via their ad. However, the growing requirements of measurement have moved the focus to the actual profit that a specific ad generated. Marketing departments are more and more asked to show what each marketing channel brings back to the firm in terms of revenue. The purpose of this thesis has been to create a deeper understanding of <b>sales</b> <b>driven</b> marketing and its influence on search engine marketing. To achieve this, a qualitative single-case study was made on a marketing bureau based in Sollentuna, Sweden. The collection of empirical data was made by direct observations and a face-to-face interview with the business developer of the bureau. This thesis highlights the potential for companies to utilize a more cost-effective way of advertising. The conclusions {{of this study indicate that}} companies in general are appreciating this new way of marketing since it is more beneficial for them to use.
