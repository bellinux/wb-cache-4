40|$|Oronasal fistula (ONF) is the commonest {{complication}} {{associated with}} cleft palate surgery. The main symptoms associated with ONF are nasal regurgitation of food matter and hypernasality of voice. Repair of cleft palate under tension {{is considered to}} be the main reason of ONF though vascular accidents and infection can also be the cause. Most of the ONFs are situated in the hard palate or at the junction of hard and <b>soft</b> <b>palate.</b> <b>Repair</b> of ONF depends on its site, size and mode of presentation. A whole spectrum of surgical procedures starting from small local flaps to microvascular tissue transfers have been employed for closure of ONF.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} longitudinally {{the effect}} of infant orthopedics (IO) on dentofacial cephalometric variables in unilateral cleft lip and palate (UCLP) patients from 4 to 6 years of age. DESIGN: Prospective two-arm randomized controlled clinical trial in three cleft palate centers in The Netherlands (Dutchcleft trial). PATIENTS: Fifty-four children with complete UCLP. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were divided randomly into two groups. Half of the patients (IO+) had IO until surgical closure of the soft palate {{at the age of}} +/- 52 weeks; the other half (IO-) received no intervention. MEAN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cephalometric values representing soft tissue, hard tissue, and dental structures, measured on lateral headfilms made at 4 and 6 years of age. RESULTS: In the IO+ group, 21 patients were analyzed; in the IO- group, 20 patients were analyzed at age 4 and 22 at age 6. No differences were found between IO+ and IO-, except for two measurements: The interincisal angle was larger and the mentolabial angle was smaller in the IO+ group. CONCLUSIONS: For infants with UCLP whose surgical management included <b>soft</b> <b>palate</b> <b>repair</b> at 12 months and delayed hard palate closure, cephalometric outcomes at ages 4 and 6 provide no indication for the type of IO used in this study...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Surgical {{techniques}} to obtain adequate <b>soft</b> <b>palate</b> <b>repair</b> in cleft palate patients {{elaborate on the}} muscle repair; however, there is little available information regarding the innervation of muscles. Improved insights into the innervation of the musculature will likely allow improvements in the repair of the cleft palate and subsequently decrease the incidence of velopharyngeal insufficiency. We performed a literature review focusing on recent advances {{in the understanding of}} soft palate muscle innervation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The Medline and Embase databases were searched for anatomical studies concerning the innervation of the soft palate. RESULTS: Our literature review highlights the lack of accurate information about the innervation of the levator veli palatini and palatopharyngeus muscles. It is probable that the lesser palatine nerve and the pharyngeal plexus dually innervate the levator veli palatini and palatopharyngeus muscles. Nerves of the superior-extravelar part of the levator veli palatini and palatopharyngeus muscles enter the muscle form the lateral side. Subsequently, the lesser palatine nerve enters from the lateral side of the inferior-velar part of the levator veli palatini muscle. This knowledge could aid surgeons during reconstruction of the cleft musculature. The innervation of the tensor veli palatini muscle by a small branch of the mandibular nerve was confirmed in all studies. CONCLUSION: Both the levator veli palatini and palatopharyngeus muscles receive motor fibres from the accessory nerve (through the vagus nerve and the glossopharyngeal nerve) and also the lesser palatine nerve. A small branch of the mandibular nerve innervates the tensor veli palatini muscle. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Knowledge about these nerves could aid the cleft surgeon to perform a more careful dissection of the lateral side of the musculature...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Background. Measurement of {{functional}} outcomes related to different methods of <b>soft</b> <b>palate</b> reconstruction {{is necessary to}} determine efficacy of surgical intervention after resection for oropharyngeal cancer. Methods. Speech data were collected across 4 evaluation times for 4 groups of patients (2 groups consisted of patients with half the <b>soft</b> <b>palate</b> resected followed by conventional reconstruction; 2 groups consisted of patients with half {{or more of the}} <b>soft</b> <b>palate</b> resected followed by reconstruction with an adhesion or the <b>soft</b> <b>palate</b> insufficiency <b>repair</b> (SPIR). Results. Sixty-two patients were included. Speech was pre-served when conventional reconstructive procedures were used to close smaller defects.

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} and compare mandibular morphology and spatial position in children with complete unilateral cleft lip and palate (UCLP) treated at two different cleft centers (Hannover and Brussels) following different surgical treatment protocols. Patients: A total of 62 Caucasian children (40 boys, 22 girls) with nonsyndromic complete unilateral cleft lip and palate (UCLP) were evaluated by means of conventional cephalometric analysis at approximately the age of 10 years. Data of both cleft groups were compared with a control, noncleft group (n = 40) matched according to age and sex. Interventions: The Hannover children with cleft (n = 36) underwent lip repair at a mean age of 5. 83 ± 1. 16 months. The hard and soft palates were closed at a mean age of 29. 08 ± 4. 68 and 32. 25 ± 4. 29 months, respectively. The Brussels children with cleft (n = 26) were treated according to the Malek surgical protocol with <b>soft</b> <b>palate</b> <b>repair</b> at a mean age of 3. 04 ± 0. 20 months and simultaneous lip and hard palate repair at a mean age of 6. 15 ± 0. 68 months. Results: Statistical analysis (analysis of variance with post hoc Tukey's test) showed a significant (p =. 001) smaller mandibular ramus length (Co-Go) in the Brussels cleft group, compared with the control group. The Hannover-Brussels comparison data revealed that the S-N-B angle was significantly (p =. 047) less in the Brussels cleft group. Conclusions: The influence of surgical procedures in patients with UCLP might not be restricted to the maxilla but could influence mandibular spatial position to the cranial base. Because of these positional changes of the mandible, both cleft groups showed facial balance. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Cleft palate affects {{almost every}} {{function}} of the face except vision. Today a child born with cleft palate with or without cleft lip {{should not be considered}} as unfortunate, because surgical repair of cleft palate has reached a highly satisfactory level. However for an average cleft surgeon palatoplasty remains an enigma. The surgery differs from centre to centre and surgeon to surgeon. However there is general agreement that palatoplasty (soft palate at least) should be performed between 6 - 12 months of age. Basically there are three groups of palatoplasty techniques. One is for hard palate repair, second for <b>soft</b> <b>palate</b> <b>repair</b> and the third based on the surgical schedule. Hard palate repair techniques are Veau-Wardill-Kilner V-Y, von Langenbeck, two-flap, Aleveolar extension palatoplasty, vomer flap, raw area free palatoplasty etc. The soft palate techniques are intravelar veloplasty, double opposing Z-plasty, radical muscle dissection, primary pharyngeal flap etc. And the protocol based techniques are Schweckendiek&#x 2032;s, Malek&#x 2032;s, whole in one, modified schedule with palatoplasty before lip repair etc. One should also know the effect of each technique on maxillofacial growth and speech. The ideal technique of palatoplasty is the one which gives perfect speech without affecting the maxillofacial growth and hearing. The techniques are still evolving because we are yet to design an ideal one. It is always good to know all the techniques and variations so that one can choose whichever gives the best result in one&#x 2032;s hands. A large number of techniques are available in literature, and also every surgeon incorporates his own modification to make it a variation.

40|$|Background: Children with a cleft in the <b>soft</b> <b>palate</b> have {{difficulties}} with speech, swallowing, and sucking. Despite successful surgical repositioning of the muscles, optimal function {{is often not}} achieved. Scar formation and defective regeneration may hamper the functional recovery of the muscles after cleft <b>palate</b> <b>repair.</b> Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study is to investigate the anatomy and histology of the <b>soft</b> <b>palate</b> in rats, and to establish an in vivo model for muscle regeneration after surgical injury. Methods: Fourteen adult male Sprague Dawley rats were divided into four groups. Groups 1 (n = 4) and 2 (n = 2) were used to investigate the anatomy and histology of the <b>soft</b> <b>palate,</b> respectively. Group 3 (n = 6) was used for surgical wounding of the <b>soft</b> <b>palate,</b> and group 4 (n = 2) was used as unwounded control group. The wounds (1 mm) were evaluated by (immuno) histochemistry (AZAN staining, Pax 7, MyoD, MyoG, MyHC, and ASMA) after 7 days. Results: The present study shows that the anatomy and histology of the <b>soft</b> <b>palate</b> muscles of the rat is largely comparable with that in humans. All wounds showed clinical evidence of healing after 7 days. AZAN staining demonstrated extensive collagen deposition in the wound area, and initial regeneration of muscle fibers and salivary glands.

40|$|Objectives: During cleft <b>palate</b> <b>repair,</b> velopharyngeal {{sphincter}} reconstruction {{is still}} a challenge to plastic surgeons. To improve results of surgical treatment of cleft palate and secondary velopharyngeal incompetence, a carefully designed modified procedure for palatoplasty is presented. Materials and Methods: Thirty patients with incomplete cleft palate corrected by this procedure from April 2003 to October 2007 were included. A u-shaped incision {{was made in the}} anterior palate to separate bipedicle flap based on the greater palatine arteries of both sides. After complete dissection of the nasal and palatal mucosa, palatal muscles were carefully dissected from the posterior edge of the bones of the hard palate, wherein the well-mobilised flap receded backward spontaneously and elongated the <b>soft</b> <b>palate.</b> After suturing the nasal mucosa in the midline, the dissected palatal muscles of both sides were sutured together in the anterior third of the <b>soft</b> <b>palate.</b> On suturing the nasal mucosa and the palatal muscles, the <b>soft</b> <b>palate</b> became elongated and the oral mucosa was seen receding backward spontaneously to cover the anterior part of the <b>soft</b> <b>palate.</b> Results: All corrected patients showed good results, with no recurrence, no post-operative fistulae, with accepted speech pattern and no need for further pharyngoplasty. The line of the sutured nasal mucosa and the palatal muscles became covered by the healthy non-sutured oral mucosa and the <b>soft</b> <b>palate</b> became elongated, with narrowing of the vellopharyngeal isthmus after this technique. Conclusion: The designed flap allows covering of sutured nasal mucosa and palatal muscles with a healthy unsutured oral mucosa and elongates the <b>soft</b> <b>palate.</b> Thus, there was no incidence of post-operative fistula and no need for further pharyngoplasties...|$|R
40|$|Muscle repair is {{a crucial}} {{component}} of palatoplasty but {{little is known about}} muscle regeneration after cleft <b>palate</b> <b>repair.</b> We hypothesized that the formation of new myofibers is hampered by collagen accumulation after experimental injury of the <b>soft</b> <b>palate</b> of rats. One-millimeter excisional defects were made in the <b>soft</b> <b>palates</b> of 32 rats. The wound area was evaluated after 3, 7, 28, and 56 days using azocarmine G and aniline blue to stain for collagen and immunohistochemistry to identify myofibroblasts and to monitor skeletal muscle differentiation. To evaluate age effects, 16 unwounded animals were evaluated at 3 and 56 days. Staining was quantified by image analysis, and one-way ANOVA was used for the statistical analysis. At day 56, the area percentage of collagen-rich tissue was higher in the injured palatal muscles (46. 7 +/- 6. 9 %) than in nonwounded controls (15. 9 +/- 1. 0 %, p < 0. 05). Myofibroblasts were present in the injured muscles at days 3 and 7 only. The numbers of proliferating and differentiating myoblasts within the wound area were greater at day 7 (p < 0. 05), but only a few new myofibers had formed by 56 days. No age effects were found. The results indicate that surgical wounding of the <b>soft</b> <b>palate</b> results in muscle fibrosis. Although activated satellite cells migrated into the wound area, no new myofibers formed.

In food processing, palatal elevation was less frequent and its displacement was smaller during inspiration than expiration. In stage II transport, the <b>soft</b> <b>palate</b> was elevated less frequently during inspiration than expiration.

40|$|Introduction: The <b>soft</b> <b>palate</b> is the {{posterior}} fibro-muscular {{portion of the}} palate, with a main role in velopharyngeal closure which assists in the normal functions of sucking, swallowing and pronunciation. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate variations in the morphology of <b>soft</b> <b>palate</b> in normal subjects. Materials and Methods: In this descriptive-analytical study 169 digital lateral cephalograms were selected from normal Iranian subjects (94 women and 75 men), with age ranges of 15 - 20 and 21 - 35, referring to a private oral radiology center in Isfahan. Morphology of the <b>soft</b> <b>palate</b> on lateral cephalograms was examined and classified into 6 types. In addition, the <b>soft</b> <b>palate</b> lengths in each type and differences in relation to age and gender were evaluated. Data were analyzed by t-test, chi-squared test and one-way ANOVA (p value > 0. 05). Results: The morphology of the <b>soft</b> <b>palate</b> was classified into 6 types. Type 1 (leaf-shaped) was the most prevalent. There was a significant difference in the shape of the <b>soft</b> <b>palate</b> between males and females (p value = 0. 02). The mean length of the <b>soft</b> <b>palate</b> in men was more than that in women (p value = 0. 03). In addition, the <b>soft</b> <b>palate</b> length in type 3 (butt-like(was significantly shorter than that in other types (p value < 0. 05).

So far, these muscles have been analyzed sepa-rately and the whole structure of the <b>soft</b> <b>palate</b> has been described very vaguely. The {{purpose of this study}} was to describe the structure of <b>soft</b> <b>palate</b> collectively. Study Design: Human cadaver dissection. Methods: Anatomical dissection was performed on 20 Korean, formalin-fixed cadavers (13 men and 7 women). The heads were randomly assigned to either dissection groups, medial-to-lateral (10 heads) or posterior-to-anterior (10 heads). Results: Fibro-fatty layer was located in the oral side of the <b>soft</b> <b>palate</b> and became thick and dense along the midline. The levator veli palatini was distributed on the nasal side of the <b>soft</b> <b>palate.</b> The average vertical distance from the top of pal-atopharyngeal arch to the levator veli palatini was 12. 36 5. 2 mm. The palatopharyngeus was also spread out widely and filled the palatopharyngeal arch. The periosteum of the hard palate became the fascia of the <b>soft</b> <b>palate,</b> which was merged with the aponeurosis of the tensor veli palatini in the midline. The Passavant’s ridge was located between the levator veli palatini and palatopharyngeus, inserting onto the aponeurosis. The palatoglossus was very thin and embedded in the palato-glossal arch. Conclusion: The muscles of the <b>soft</b> <b>palate</b> are intermingled with each other in the fibro-fatty layer. Comprehensive ana...|$|R

40|$|Palatal lift {{appliances}} {{are used}} when the <b>soft</b> <b>palate</b> is anatomically normal but dysfunctional and patients suffer from speech problems while surgical correction is not possible. The aim of these prostheses is lifting <b>soft</b> <b>palate</b> to its normal level {{in order to}} achieve palatopharyngeal competence. The prostheses are designed based on maximum retention to keep <b>soft</b> <b>palate</b> in new position without prosthesis displacement. Various methods of constructing these appliances are mentioned and discussed in this article...|$|R
40|$|Oral submucous {{fibrosis}} (OSMF) is {{a chronic}} insidious disease affecting mucosa and submucosa of oral cavity and <b>soft</b> <b>palate.</b> The present study aimed {{to evaluate the}} morphology of <b>soft</b> <b>palate</b> in normal individuals and OSMF patients using lateral cephalometry and to compare and correlate these variants of <b>soft</b> <b>palate</b> with different stages of OSMF. 100 subjects {{were included in the}} study, who were divided into two groups. Group I included 50 subjects with clinical diagnosis of OSMF and Group II included 50 normal subjects (control group). Using digital lateral cephalometry, velar length and width were measured and soft palatal patterns were categorized based on You et al. ’s classification. Leaf and rat-tail patterns of <b>soft</b> <b>palate</b> were predominant in control group, whereas butt and crook shaped variants were more in study group. Anteroposterior (A-P) length of <b>soft</b> <b>palate</b> was significantly greater in stage I OSMF, while superoinferior (S-I) width was greater in stage III OSMF. Interestingly, a negative correlation was observed in staging of OSMF and A-P dimensions. As the staging of OSMF advances, the A-P length of <b>soft</b> <b>palate</b> decreases, but S-I width increases...|$|R
40|$|Squamous cell {{carcinoma}} infrequently {{occurs at the}} <b>soft</b> <b>palate.</b> Although various methods {{can be used for}} reconstruction of <b>soft</b> <b>palate</b> defects that occur after resecting squamous {{cell carcinoma}}, it is difficult to obtain satisfactory results {{from the perspective of the}} functional restoration of the <b>soft</b> <b>palate.</b> A combination of bilateral palatal mucomuscular flap for the oral side and superiorly based posterior pharyngeal flap for the nasal side were performed on two patients who were diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the <b>soft</b> <b>palate</b> in order to reconstruct the <b>soft</b> <b>palate</b> defects after surgical resection. After surgery, the patients were followed-up for a mean period of 11 months. The flaps were well maintained in both patients. The donor site defects were epithelialized and completely recovered. Additionally, no recurrence of the primary sites was shown. Slight hyponasality was observed in the voice assessments that were conducted 6 months after surgery. No food regurgitation or aspiration was observed in the swallowing tests. We used a combination of bilateral palatal mucomuscular flap and superiorly based posterior pharyngeal flap to reconstruct the <b>soft</b> <b>palate</b> defects that occurred after resecting the squamous cell carcinomas. We reduced the donor site complications and achieved functionally satisfactory outcomes...|$|R

Young modulus values range from 585 Pa at the posterior free edge of the <b>soft</b> <b>palate</b> to 1409 Pa where the <b>soft</b> <b>palate</b> attaches to the maxilla. These properties are useful when quantifying the effects of corrective orthopedic devices such as the Hotz Plate on cleft lip.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Elongated <b>soft</b> <b>palate</b> is {{a common}} upper airway anomaly in brachycephalic dogs. The {{scientific}} literature considering this pathology in nonbrachycephalic dogs is limited. The {{aim of this study}} was to estimate the importance of the elongated <b>soft</b> <b>palate</b> in nonbrachycephalic dogs (n = 10), carrying out, at the same time, a comparison with selected brachycephalic dogs (n = 19), on the effect of carbon dioxide laser staphylectomy. The selected population had only elongated <b>soft</b> <b>palates</b> and no other disorders. The surgery was rapid and uncomplicated; no suture material was used. The comprehensive recovery was significant (P < 0. 0001) : 68. 4 % of brachycephalic dogs and 100 % of nonbrachycephalic dogs had complete recovery. The incomplete recovery in older brachycephalic dogs matched a more advanced pathologic phase. This study suggests that, in the case of high respiratory tract alteration and poor exercise tolerance, it is imperative to consider in differential diagnosis the elongated <b>soft</b> <b>palate</b> in nonbrachycephalic breeds, too; their clinical signs are less severe and frequently underestimated. The surgical treatment has a favorable prognosis when the only alteration is elongated <b>soft</b> <b>palate.</b> The carbon dioxide laser has been confirmed as an useful option for staphylectomy in dogs.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the speech in {{subjects}} with cleft lip and palate, in whom three methods of the hard palate closure were used. One hundred and thirty-seven children (96 boys, 41 girls; mean age = 12 years, SD = 1. 2) with complete unilateral cleft lip and palate (CUCLP) operated by a single surgeon with a one-stage method were evaluated. The management of the cleft lip and <b>soft</b> <b>palate</b> was comparable in all subjects; for hard <b>palate</b> <b>repair,</b> three different methods were used: bilateral von Langenbeck closure (b-vL group, n = 39), unilateral von Langenbeck closure (u-vL group, n = 56) and vomerplasty (v-p group, n = 42). Speech was assessed: (i) perceptually for the presence of a) hypernasality, b) compensatory articulations (CAs), c) audible nasal air emissions (ANE) and d) speech intelligibility; (ii) for the presence of compensatory facial grimacing, (iii) with clinical intra-oral evaluation and (iv) with videonasendoscopy. A total rate of hypernasality requiring pharyngoplasty was 5. 1 %; total incidence post-oral compensatory articulations (CAs) was 2. 2 %. The overall speech intelligibility was good in 84. 7 % of cases. Oronasal fistulas (ONFs) occurred in 15. 7 % b-vL subjects, 7. 1 % u-vL subjects and 50 % v-p subjects (P 0. 1). In conclusion, the speech after early one-stage repair of CUCLP was satisfactory. The method of hard <b>palate</b> <b>repair</b> affected the incidence of ONFs, which, however, caused relatively mild and inconsistent speech errors...|$|R
