5|$|An {{official}} groundbreaking at {{the school}} was held on September 23, 2005, with <b>school</b> <b>board</b> <b>members</b> Nancy Petsuch, Greg Marvel, and San Ramon Mayor H. Abram Wilson in attendance. The construction of the school was divided into two phases. The first phase, which involved site grading, utilities, and paving, commenced in May 2005 and was completed by January 2006; the second phase, which involved constructing buildings, landscaping and creation of ball fields, commenced in February 2006 and was completed by August 2007. In a December 2006 meeting, the City Council of the City of San Ramon approved {{the construction of a}} performing arts center and aquatics center for joint-use between the city and the SRVUSD. Total construction took 16 months, five months less than predicted.|$|E
5|$|Combs {{created a}} merit system for state {{government}} workers, ensuring that officials {{could not be}} hired or fired for political reasons. This provision attracted more well-qualified people to public service careers. Such careers were made even more attractive when, in 1962, the state courts declared that the salaries of state employees, the amounts of which were specified in the state constitution, could be adjusted for inflation. Combs demanded that state employees stick strictly to the rules governing their offices. In one instance, Combs ordered a state audit of Carter County superintendent Heman McGuire, who was known to use his office for political gain. While Combs {{did not have the}} authority to remove McGuire directly, the audit showed McGuire's misappropriation of funds and abuse of power. The state school board investigated these findings and removed the county <b>school</b> <b>board</b> <b>members</b> from office; the replacement board members then ousted McGuire.|$|E
25|$|Audit In January 2009, the Pennsylvania Auditor General {{conducted}} a performance {{audit of the}} school district. Findings of irregularities were reported to the <b>school</b> <b>board</b> <b>members</b> and the school administration.|$|E

25|$|The {{district}} {{is divided into}} three regions for school board electoral purposes. There are three school board seats in each region. <b>School</b> <b>board</b> <b>members</b> serve four-year terms with no compensation. There are no term limits.

25|$|The School Board Chair for the Newfound Area School District is Jeff Levesque of Groton. The current <b>school</b> <b>board</b> <b>members</b> are Don Franklin of Hebron, Sue Cheney of Alexandria, Vincent Migliore of Bridgewater, Benjamin LaRoche of Bristol, and Christine Davol of New Hampton.

25|$|Over {{a period}} of several months in 2007–2008, JCPS {{developed}} a diversity plan based upon social economic and minority status (income of parents), a plan suggested by <b>school</b> <b>board</b> <b>members</b> Steve Imhoff and Larry Hujo in 2002. These changes conformed with the concurring opinion of Justice Kennedy. This plan is in place as of 2017.|$|E

25|$|All {{eight of}} the Dover <b>school</b> <b>board</b> <b>members</b> who were up for {{re-election}} on November 8, 2005, were defeated {{by a set of}} challengers who opposed the teaching of intelligent design in a science class.

25|$|In 1991 Dallas ISD {{officials}} {{proposed that}} Hotchkiss Elementary School reopen as a neighborhood {{school during the}} 1992-1993 school year. The Montessori program previously at Hotchkiss would be moved to Dealey Elementary School. The proposed attendance zone for Hotchkiss was a triangular area bounded by Fair Oaks Avenue, Northwest Highway, and White Rock Creek. The proposed Hotchkiss neighborhood would relieve Kramer, Pershing, Preston Hollow, and Dan D. Rogers schools. In 1992 federal judge Barefoot Sanders blocked the reopening of Hotchkiss, so <b>school</b> <b>board</b> <b>members</b> filed an appeal with the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.|$|E
25|$|The District {{had been}} battling its staff {{annually}} over summer lay-offs and this, {{coupled with the}} pay equity concept in vogue at the time (“Comparable Worth”) came to a boil when their contract expired in summer, ’81. Right {{in the middle of}} the strike was held election for three <b>School</b> <b>Board</b> <b>members.</b> As well as walking picket lines daily, members endorsed incumbent Joe Canciamilla (now a member of the State Assembly) and newcomer Dana Hunt (a county sheriff and union member). Their election was pivotal in settling a strike that gained a contract with wage increases that exceeded the CoLA, redressed imbalances in the male-female hourly rate inequities and provided lay-off protections for summer workers.|$|E

25|$|In 1908, {{upon the}} death of John M. Davies, Fuller became only the second Webster Parish school superintendent, a {{position}} that he retained for the last twelve years of his life. At the time the superintendent ran in a parishwide plebiscite, from which the <b>school</b> <b>board</b> <b>members</b> made the final selection. Fuller narrowly led in the election with 35 {{percent of the vote}} and was chosen by the board after it was deemed that his principal opponent lacked the educational credentials to be superintendent. Fuller was succeeded as superintendent by E. S. Richardson, a Webster Parish native and a former superintendent in neighboring Bienville Parish, who later became the president of Louisiana Tech University in Ruston.|$|E
25|$|The {{campaigns of}} {{intelligent}} design proponents seeking curricular challenges have been disruptive, divisive and expensive for the affected communities. In pursuing {{the goal of}} establishing intelligent design {{at the expense of}} evolution in public school science classes, intelligent design groups have threatened and isolated high school science teachers, <b>school</b> <b>board</b> <b>members</b> and parents who opposed their efforts. The campaigns run by intelligent design groups place teachers in the difficult position of arguing against their employers while the legal challenges to local school districts are costly, diverting funding away from education and into court battles. For example, {{as a result of the}} Dover trial, the Dover Area School District was forced to pay $1,000,011 in legal fees and damages for pursuing a policy of teaching the controversy.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, {{the school}} board voted to close three schools, Clearlake middle school, Gardendale Elementary Magnet School, and South Lake {{elementary}} school prompting a large public outcry. The school board proposed the closings and limited public input by holding required public meetings during the 2012 holiday season. The Board did not hold any of the required meetings with the capital oulay committee as required by an interlocal agreement with several municipalities. The Brevard Board of County Commissioners, City of Cocoa, and City of Titusville ccondemend the decision in official letters sent to Superintedent Brian Bingelli and the board. The Board of County Commissioners voted to file a lawsuit against {{the school board}} 3-2, however a minimum of 4 votes were required to initiate the lawsuit per county ordinance. In March 2013, a group of parents and community leaders initiated {{a lawsuit against the}} board, claiming a racial bias in the decision to close the three schools. The Board of County Commissioners publicly supported the lawsuit and started a dispute resolution process as well on their own behalf. A political action committee (PAC) was formed to oppose the current <b>school</b> <b>board</b> <b>members</b> in future elections and vowed to effect a change in leadership.|$|E
