5|$|The three {{arrive in}} Fairhope, Pennsylvania where Tommy and Jeffrey are living. The agents talk to Tommy and {{conclude}} that <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on.</b> They soon discover that their car will not start. Back at her apartment, Scully is visited by Gabe Rotter (Brian Poth), a potential suitor of Harrison's. He presents Scully with {{the corpse of}} Spanky. Scully does an ad hoc necropsy and concludes that the cat bit its stomach open {{to try to get}} something out. She also discovers a cavity, where it appears something had lived inside the cat.|$|E
25|$|Early in {{the morning}} {{somebody}} wakens me, I open my eyes and that's when my roommate from the Mexico Olympic Games says, 'Get up, Monie was killed by Arab terrorists'. I knew him as a joker but that sounded too serious, so without thinking much, in my pyjamas, I went to the entrance door of the apartment, opened it and looked around. I have seen guards from the village and they were speaking to somebody that {{was standing in the}} entrance to apartment number one. I have noticed his dark skin and the hat and I listened, still without being afraid or thinking that something is very dangerous for me, and the guards are asking the permission to let the Red Cross enter apartment one and provide some aid to a wounded person and the man, he refuse. They said, 'Why should you be inhumane ?', and the man replied something like either, the Jews or the Israelis 'are not humane either.' At that point I understood that <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> and I closed the door.|$|E
500|$|Between 1971 and 1973, reserves, public {{recreation}} {{areas and}} drainage sites were {{set aside in}} western Hamersley, and facilities were erected in quick succession – the 1st Hamersley Scout Group in 1973, the colonial-style Holy Cross Anglican Church in 1974, and a community hall at Aintree Street in 1975. Residents in the region were at this time {{on the fringe of}} Perth's suburban area, relying on partly built main roads, distant shopping centres and overstretched local facilities for several years after the suburb's construction. A locally produced fortnightly newspaper, the Hamersley Gazette, started in early 1973 by Peter Flanigan, from his home in Manton Court, covering the suburbs of Carine, Hamersley, Warwick and Greenwood, with the open aim of helping to form community associations and campaign for better facilities. A July 1973 article, for example, lamented that [...] "work on Erindale Road appears to have come to a standstill... great piles of dirt and unmade road surfaces bear testimony to the fact that <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on,</b> or should be going on, but this one is taking a very long time." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sheldrake debated {{biologist}} Lewis Wolpert on {{the existence}} of telepathy in 2004 at the Royal Society of Arts in London. Sheldrake marshalled evidence for telepathy while Wolpert argued that telepathy fits Irving Langmuir's definition of pathological science and that the evidence for telepathy has not been persuasive. Reporting on the event, New Scientist said [...] "it was clear the audience saw Wolpert as no more than a killjoy. (...) There are sound reasons for doubting Sheldrake's data. One is that some parapsychology experimenters have an uncanny knack of finding the effect they are looking for. There is no suggestion of fraud, but <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on,</b> and science demands that it must be understood before conclusions can be drawn about the results".|$|E
2500|$|There were {{allegations}} in a dossier that several matches, including eight at Wimbledon, were under suspicion of being fixed by professional gambling syndicates after bookmakers noted unexpected spikes in betting patterns. The dossier, released on the Sunday {{prior to the}} first day of play, had been commissioned by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), Women's Tennis Association (WTA), International Tennis Federation (ITF), and four Grand Slams earlier in the year, and was compiled by bookmakers. An official said, [...] "If you look at a tournament, you might see one match for £23,000 , one for £27,000, one for £36,000 and one for £4.5m. It doesn’t take a genius to work out that <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> in the last one." [...] Betting on Wimbledon matches was popular in 2007, with over £420m wagered on bets.|$|E
2500|$|Activist Joyce Shepard of Bayside, New York of the Citizens Action Committee for Change {{tried to}} {{highlight}} the issue of abused women. She contacted Hevesi's office to investigate. Hevesi issued a critical report on the Giuliani administration. On April 17, 1997, she was at New York City Hall with both Giuliani and Hevesi side by side. They promised more space for victims of domestic abuse. Despite all the promises nothing happened. She went undercover to expose the shortcomings of the shelter system. She criticized both Hevesi and Giuliani. After she was quoted by the Village Voice, Hevesi reportedly phoned her and told her: [...] "Don't you ever call my office about anything again!". The comptroller's office didn't deny the call took place. But a spokesman stated the office is open to anyone who thinks <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> we should know about.|$|E
60|$|Miss Rowly {{felt that}} <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> before her {{which she could}} not understand. Anything of this man's saying which she could not fathom {{must be at least}} dangerous; so she {{determined}} to spoil his purpose, whatever it might be.|$|R

50|$|The {{idea of a}} Pan-European Picnic came up at one {{of these}} gatherings on 30 June 1989 in the garden of Old Vigadó Restaurant. Subsequently Filep started {{organizing}} it with a few colleagues. She risked her job and her freedom. Even though her employers suspected <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> they did not ask questions.|$|R
2500|$|The second Test {{witnessed}} a controversy when the Australian team {{was accused of}} having taken help from the dressing room in using the Umpire Decision Review System (DRS). Australia's captain Steve Smith admitted to having looked {{in the direction of}} the dressing room for assistance when he was given out leg before wicket (lbw) off Umesh Yadav when he was on 28 by the on-field umpire Nigel Llong, who, immediately intervened to send him back and denying a referral. India's captain Virat Kohli, in his post-match interview, accused the team of having done that on at least three occasions; once as Smith was declared lbw, and twice as he batted, which he stated to having pointed out to the umpires. As the controversy broke out, Australia's Peter Handscomb tweeted admitting to have [...] "referred" [...] Smith to [...] "look at the box". Picking on Smith having played down the incident terming it a [...] "brain fade", Kohli said, [...] "Honestly, if someone makes a mistake while batting, for me, personally, that's a brain fade. ... But if <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> for three days, then that's not a brain fade, as simple as that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Poirot {{is leaving}} the London Underground at Piccadilly Circus when he passes an old acquaintance, the Countess Vera Rossakoff, on the escalators, going in the {{opposite}} direction. She insists that they meet and when asked to suggest a place, responds [...] "In Hell…"! Poirot is puzzled {{but it is the}} unflappable Miss Lemon who coolly informs him it is the name of a new London nightclub and books him a table for that night. The club is in a basement and is decorated in styles of hell as represented by different cultures. It even has a large black, vicious-looking hound at the entrance called Cerberus. Rossakoff introduces him to Professor Liskeard who advised her on the decorations (although he is ashamed of the gaudy results), and to Dr Alice Cunningham, a practitioner of psychology who is engaged to Rossakoff's son, currently working in America. Alice and Poirot do not get along. She is coldly interested in criminal tendencies and finds Rossakoff's kleptomania interesting, but to Poirot's chagrin, she does not seem at all interested in the legendary detective! His questioning of her manner of dress with her heavy coat and pocketed skirt instead of a more feminine style of clothing does not go down well. However, Alice does find an individual called Paul Varesco fascinating. He is a good-looking lounge lizard with a very dubious reputation and she spends time dancing with him, questioning him incessantly about incidents in his childhood which could have contributed to his personality. Poirot recognises a young Scotland Yard detective in the crowd in evening dress and feels that <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on...</b>|$|E

6000|$|She paused, and I {{could see}} that she suffered--suffered horribly. There was in her eyes a hunted look, which no man can, unmoved, see in the eyes of his beloved. I was about to interrupt, when her father's eyes, glancing round with a fierce determination, met mine. I stood silent, almost spellbound; so also the other men. <b>Something</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> before us which we did not understand! ...|$|R
60|$|Feeling {{that the}} child was in good hands, I hurried away, for I saw <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> upon the hill-top. When I got to the hill-top, I was shocked to find some people tossing an old woman in a blanket. I begged them to stop; but one of the men, who, I found, was a Welchman, by the name of Taffy, told me the old lady liked it.|$|R

60|$|To me {{it seems}} not only advisable, but necessary, that the utmost {{discretion}} be observed by all our little group, at all events for the present. There {{seems to be}} some new uneasiness in the Blue Mountains. There are constant meetings of members of the Council, but no formal meeting of the Council, as such, since the last one at which I was present. There is constant coming and going amongst the mountaineers, always in groups, small or large. Teuta and I, who have been about very much on the aeroplane, have both noticed it. But somehow we--that is, the Voivode and myself--are left out of everything; but we have not said as yet a word on the subject to any of the others. The Voivode notices, but he says nothing; so I am silent, and Teuta does whatever I ask. Sir Colin does not notice anything except the work he is engaged on--the planning the defences of the Blue Mouth. His old scientific training as an engineer, and his enormous experience of wars and sieges--for he was for nearly fifty years sent as military representative to all the great wars--seem to have become directed on that point. He is certainly planning it all out in a wonderful way. He consults Rooke almost hourly on the maritime side of the question. The Lord High Admiral has been a watcher all his life, and very few important points have ever escaped him, so that he can add greatly to the wisdom of the defensive construction. He notices, I think, that <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> outside ourselves; but he keeps a resolute silence.|$|E
60|$|The clanking {{sound came}} nearer, {{and in the}} ghostly grey of the dawning we could make out long files of men, some fifty or so in all, slowly {{creeping}} up the stair. They were now at the half-way standing place that rested on the great flying arch; and here, perceiving that <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> above, they, to our great gain, halted {{for three or four}} minutes and consulted, then slowly and cautiously advanced again.|$|R
