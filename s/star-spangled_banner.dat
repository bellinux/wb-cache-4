5|$|The Baltimore Beltway {{was first}} planned in 1949 by Baltimore County; the state {{eventually}} {{took over the}} project and it {{became part of the}} Interstate Highway System planned in 1956. The length of the route from MD 2 south of Baltimore clockwise to U.S. Route 40 (US40) northeast of the city opened in stages from 1955 to 1962, providing an Interstate bypass of Baltimore. It was the first beltway in the United States to be built as part of the Interstate Highway System. Plans were made to finish the remainder of the route, with a diversion to the Windlass Freeway and the Patapsco Freeway, opened in 1973, following the cancellation of a more outer route that was to partly follow what is today MD702 (Southeast Boulevard). The Outer Harbor Crossing over the Patapsco River, which was dedicated to Francis Scott Key, who wrote The <b>Star-Spangled</b> <b>Banner,</b> and its approaches were finished in 1977, completing the route around Baltimore. The approaches to the bridge were originally two lanes to accommodate a tunnel that was originally proposed to run under the river; in subsequent years, they were upgraded to a four-lane configuration compliant with Interstate Highway standards, allowing for this portion of route to be signed as I-695 rather than MD695. There are future plans for I-695 that include high-occupancy toll lanes to ease traffic. In addition, the northeastern interchange with I-95 has been reconstructed to accommodate express toll lanes that were added to I-95 (completed in 2014, but construction is in progress in 2016 to remove I-695's carriageway crossovers here).|$|E

25|$|From there, {{the use of}} {{military}} rockets spread throughout the western world. At the Battle of Baltimore in 1814, the rockets fired on Fort McHenry by the rocket vessel HMS Erebus were the source of the rockets' red glare described by Francis Scott Key in The <b>Star-Spangled</b> <b>Banner.</b> Rockets were also used in the Battle of Waterloo.|$|E
25|$|The {{dedication}} {{ceremony was}} simple. Father Thomas McGuigan of St. Patrick's Catholic Church provided an invocation. Dr. McGee spoke briefly, followed by Dr. Cox. A poem by Rudyard Kipling was read, and then 15-year-old Klotho McGee (Dr. McGee's daughter) unveiled the monument as the 7th Cavalry Band played the The <b>Star-Spangled</b> <b>Banner.</b> Mrs. McLean delivered a lengthy address as {{the highlight of}} the ceremony. An Army chaplain gave a benediction, and a bugler from Fort Myer played Taps.|$|E

25|$|Following the War of 1812, America {{began to}} assert a newfound sense of {{national}}ism. America began {{to rally around}} national heroes such as Andrew Jackson and patriotic feelings emerged in such works as Francis Scott Key's poem The <b>Star-Spangled</b> <b>Banner.</b> Under the direction of Chief Justice John Marshall, the Supreme Court issued a series of opinions reinforcing {{the role of the}} national government. These decisions included McCulloch v Maryland and Gibbons v Ogden; both of which reaffirmed the supremacy of the national government over the states. The signing of the Adams-Onis Treaty helped to settle the western border of the country through popular and peaceable means.|$|E
25|$|After singing The <b>Star-Spangled</b> <b>Banner,</b> {{while the}} {{opposing}} team is being introduced, members of the student section take out {{a copy of the}} student-run newspaper, The University Daily Kansan, and wave the paper in front of their faces, pretending to be reading it in an effort to show lack of interest in {{the opposing team}}. After the opponents are introduced, a short video is shown, detailing the history and the accomplishments of Kansas basketball. As the Jayhawks are introduced, the students rip up their newspapers and throw the confetti pieces of paper in the air as celebration. Whatever confetti remains is typically thrown in the air after the first basket made by the Jayhawks.|$|E
25|$|Kentucky {{has been}} {{on the front lines of}} the debate over {{displaying}} the Ten Commandments on public property. In the 2005 case of McCreary County v. ACLU of Kentucky, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the decision of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals that a display of the Ten Commandments in the Whitley City courthouse of McCreary County was unconstitutional. Later that year, Judge Richard Fred Suhrheinrich, writing for the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in the case of ACLU of Kentucky v. Mercer County, wrote that a display including the Mayflower Compact, the Declaration of Independence, the Ten Commandments, the Magna Carta, The <b>Star-Spangled</b> <b>Banner,</b> and the national motto could be erected in the Mercer County courthouse.|$|E

When completed with the speech, Lehman removed the flagpole that had blocked entrance to the roadway in front of 2,000 people, including 500 guests from the LISPC. Flags were raised and the <b>Star-Spangled</b> <b>Banner</b> was played by a band. Lehman noted that this is the end of isolation for Long Island, but concerned if the city could afford maintenance as control of the Grand Central would be turned over from the LISPC to the city. The governor and state officials moved out to Mineola after the ceremony, where Lehman headed off for Albany, the rest went for a dinner. However, the first segment of the Northern State was opened, nine years after first proposed.|$|E
25|$|The American labor {{movement}} had been celebrating its May Day holiday since the 1890s {{and had seen}} none of the violence associated with the day's events in Europe. On May 1, 1919, the left mounted especially large demonstrations, and violence greeted the normally peaceful parades in Boston, New York, and Cleveland. In Boston, police tried to stop a march that lacked a permit. In the ensuing melee both sides fought for possession of the Socialists' red flags. One policeman was stabbed and killed. William Sidis was arrested. Later a mob attacked the Socialist headquarters. Police arrested 114, all from the Socialist side. Each side's newspapers provided uncritical support to their own the next day. In New York, soldiers in uniform burned printed materials at the Russian People's House and forced immigrants to sing the <b>Star-Spangled</b> <b>Banner.</b>|$|E
25|$|On May 5, 1960 Allen {{began her}} long {{partnership}} with Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic in a concert performance of Four Saints in Three Acts.

25|$|Yoshiki's second solo {{classical}} tour commenced in Osaka Castle Hall on December 5, 2016 {{with three}} {{days at the}} Tokyo International Forum on December 6, 7 and 8, a performance at Hong Kong’s AsiaWorld-Expo scheduled for December 29 and Carnegie Hall, New York on Jan 12 and 13. The Carnegie Hall performances included the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra. The Tokyo concerts in December were an acclaimed success but the Hong Kong Concert on December 29 had to be canceled {{two hours before the}} show. The cancellation was due to an oversight by the promoter in applying for the entertainment license necessary to perform the show. However the date was fulfilled on the following day, December 30, by Yoshiki performing for free with ticket holders being refunded, the first time ever for a major music artist to do such a thing in Hong Kong. The concerts in Carnegie Hall on January 12 and 13 were successful sellout shows. Yoshiki also included in the show a surprise performance of The <b>Star-Spangled</b> <b>Banner</b> after a heartfelt speech about his personal pursuit of the American Dream.|$|E
25|$|The Morgan State University Choir {{is one of}} the nation’s {{most prestigious}} {{university}} choral ensembles and was led {{for more than three decades}} by the late Dr. Nathan Carter, celebrated conductor, composer, and arranger. The groups that are subdivisions of the critically acclaimed choir include the University Choir, which is over 140 voices strong, and The Morgan Singers (approximately 40 voices). While classical, gospel, and contemporary popular music comprise the majority of the choir’s repertoire, the choir is noted for its emphasis on preserving the heritage of the spiritual, especially in the historic practices of performance. The Morgan State University Choir has performed for audiences throughout the United States and all over the world—including The Bahamas, Virgin Islands, Canary Islands, Canada, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Their most recent international appearance was in Saint Petersburg, Russia, at the invitation of Maestro Yuri Temirkanov, music director and conductor for the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. In Russia, the Choir performed in the 5th International Festival Arts Square and was received enthusiastically by their Russian audiences. The Choir has appeared at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., and at the Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall in New York City on numerous occasions, performing and premiering works such as John Corigliano’s “Poem On His Birthday,” “Too Hot to Handel” arranged by Broadway composers Bob Christianson and Gary Anderson and Hannibal Lokumbe’s “African Portraits”, led by music director Leonard Slatkin, as part of the Kennedy Center’s African Festival. One of the Choir’s most historic moments came with the opportunity to sing under the baton of Robert Shaw, conducting the Orchestra of St. Luke's and joined by Jessye Norman and others in Carnegie Hall’s One Hundredth Birthday Tribute to Marian Anderson. A major milestone and historical movement occurred during the 1996–1997 season with the sounds of the “Silver Anniversary” concert being broadcast into households throughout the state of Maryland. The concert won three Emmy Awards for Maryland Public Television (MPT). MPT continues to air this hallmark performance during select sections of their membership drives. In 1993, the choir joined actor James Earl Jones in a performance of the <b>Star-Spangled</b> <b>Banner</b> at the 1993 Major League Baseball All-Star Game at Oriole Park at Camden Yards, broadcast on CBS.|$|E

500|$|Besides {{making the}} flag that {{inspired}} Francis Scott Key to compose {{the words to}} the United States National Anthem, Pickersgill is also remembered for her humanitarian contributions to society, evident in her decades-long presidency of the Impartial Female Humane Society, which eventually evolved into the Pickersgill Retirement Community of Towson, Maryland. [...] She is also remembered for her house, known as the <b>Star-Spangled</b> <b>Banner</b> Flag House and later renamed the Flag House and <b>Star-Spangled</b> <b>Banner</b> Museum, which stands {{at the corner of}} East Pratt Street and Albemarle Street in eastern downtown Baltimore and is a National Historic Landmark.|$|E
500|$|Pickersgill's one {{surviving}} child, Caroline (1800-1884), married John Purdy (1795-1837). [...] The couple {{apparently had}} no surviving children, {{because in a}} letter written late in her life to the daughter of George Armistead, Purdy called herself [...] "widowed and childless." [...] She had become somewhat destitute late in life, {{and in the same}} letter requested some financial assistance, but also provided some history about her mother and the making of the <b>Star-Spangled</b> <b>Banner</b> flag.|$|E
500|$|Pickersgill died in 1857 and {{was buried}} in the Loudon Park Cemetery in {{southwest}} Baltimore, where her daughter erected a monument for her, and where some civic-minded organizations later erected a bronze plaque. [...] The house where Pickersgill lived for 50 years, at the northwest corner of Albemarle [...] and East Pratt Streets in downtown Baltimore, became known as the <b>Star-Spangled</b> <b>Banner</b> Flag House in 1927. [...] The house was saved through the efforts of many preservation-minded citizens who were motivated by the Centennial Celebrations of 1914.|$|E

[...] Writers for the series wrote into Animaniacs stories that happened to them; the episodes [...] "Ups and Downs," [...] "Survey Ladies," [...] and [...] "I Got Yer Can" [...] were episodes based on true stories that happened to Rugg, Deanna Oliver, and Stoner, respectively.

American General CEO Joe Kelley performed the ceremonial pre-game coin toss to determine first possession.

500|$|Greg Garrett, an English {{professor}} at Baylor University, saw the song {{as an effort}} to [...] " [...] to growing interests in doing justice—and calling to attention American failures in that regard", noting that the regimes in South America had been supported by the United States because of their anti-communist positions, even though their tactics were in opposition to the democratic values that [...] "America claims to champion around the world". Lisa Hand of the Sunday Independent noted the influence of America on the track, remarking, [...] " [...] does not confine itself simply to the music, but also extends to some of the lyrics. However, far from being a tribute to the <b>star-spangled</b> <b>banner,</b> the words highlight the political untruths and ambiguities which exist within the U.S. 'Mothers of the Disappeared' and 'Bullet the Blue Sky' both {{take a hard look at}} the American involvement in South America". Richard Harrington of The Washington Post described the song as [...] "a simple lament of great beauty and sadness pleading for the realization that ideological battles about right and left obscure the more important issue of right and wrong."

500|$|Forty-five {{thousand}} spectators {{came to see}} the Piccards off on October 23, 1934, at 6:51am, {{about two}} hours behind schedule. Jeannette piloted the reconditioned Century of Progress, and the couple took along their pet turtle, Fleur de Lys. After a brief pre-launch ceremony, during which the Piccards received a bouquet from their sons and a small band played The <b>Star-Spangled</b> <b>Banner,</b> they lifted off from Ford Airport, assisted by airmen on the ground who pushed the gondola. Jean changed the flight path and shortened the flight time because of cloudy skies, which reduced the amount of scientific work they were able to do. Jeannette made [...] "unplanned and impulsive maneuvres" [...] and the Piccards failed to make complete records of their actions during the flight.

They reached [...] or about [...] up, travelled for eight hours on a journey over Lake Erie, and landed about [...] away from Dearborn, near Cadiz, Ohio. She had to choose a landing on elm trees, realizing that meant the Century of Progress would never fly again. The balloon separated from the gondola and was ripped. Jean sustained small fractures to his ribs, left foot, and ankle. According to Jeannette's description in Time magazine: [...] "What a mess! I wanted to land on the White House lawn." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics and}} musical {{notation}} of the anthem {{are given in}} the second appendix of the Act on National Flag and Anthem. As for the sheet music itself, it displays a vocal arrangement with no mention of tempo {{and all of the}} lyrics in hiragana. The anthem is composed in 4/4 (common time) in the Dorian mode. The Act on National Flag and Anthem does not detail how one should show respect during performances of [...] "Kimigayo". In a statement made by Prime Minister Obuchi, the legislation will not impose new regulations on the Japanese people when it comes to respecting the flag or anthem. However, local government bodies and private organizations sometimes suggest or demand certain protocols be followed. For example, an October 2003 directive by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government required teachers to stand during the national anthem at graduation ceremonies. While standing, the teachers are required to sing [...] "Kimigayo" [...] while facing the Hinomaru. United States military personnel are required by regulations to render honors with a hand salute, or when in civilian dress, to place their right hand over their heart when [...] "Kimigayo", The <b>Star-Spangled</b> <b>Banner,</b> or any other national anthem is performed. The Act on National Flag and Anthem also does not dictate when or where [...] "Kimigayo" [...] should be played. The anthem, however, is commonly played at sporting events inside of Japan, or at international sporting events where Japan has a competing team. At sumō tournaments, [...] "Kimigayo" [...] is played before the awards ceremony.|$|E
