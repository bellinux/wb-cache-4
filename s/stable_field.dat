40|$|Purpose: To {{compare the}} mean intraocular pres-sure (IOP), peak IOP and {{percentage}} reduction in IOP {{in the first}} live years following trabeculectomy between the patients with progressed visual field loss and the patients with <b>stable</b> visual <b>fields.</b> Material and methods: Thirty-six eyes of 36 patients were followed for five years after their first trabeculectomy with tonometry and automated perimetry (Octopus 500 EZ, program Gl). The rate of change of the visual field was measured by linear regression analysis of the mean sensitivity value (dB 9) of each field test versus time (month). Based on the statistical significance of {{the slope of the}} regression line (Spear man p value of the correlation coefficient less than 0. 05), patients were divided into two groups: with significant negative slope of the regression line (group with progressed visual field loss) and with non-significant slope of the regression line (group with <b>stable</b> visual <b>field).</b> The mean IOP values and percentage of IOP reduction {{at the end of each}} of the first live years after surgery were compared between the group with progressed field loss and group with <b>stable</b> <b>fields</b> by using Mann-Whitney U test. Results: Patients with progressed visual field loss had higher mean IOP, higher peak IOP and less reduction in pressure after the operation than patients with <b>stable</b> visual <b>field.</b> The mean IOP at end of the two year postoperative period was significantly higher in patients with progressed visual field loss (21. 98 ± 3. 38 mmHg) than in those with <b>stable</b> <b>fields</b> (17. 48 ± 4, 80 mmHg). The mean percentage reduction in IOP at the end of two year postoperative peri­od was significantly less in patients that showed progression of field loss (21. 84 %) than in those with <b>stable</b> <b>fields</b> (41. 0 %). Conclusion: Prognosis for further field loss seems to be better if postoperative pressure is at lower levels and greater percent reduction of IOP is obtained after surgery. The data that predict better prognosis is the mean postoperative IOP value of approximately 18 mmHg or less resulting from at least 35 % of IOP reduction...|$|R
