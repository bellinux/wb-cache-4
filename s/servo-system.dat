40|$|The double-gimbal control moment gyro (DGCMG) {{demands that}} the gimbal {{servosystem}} should have fast response and small overshoot.

40|$|Friction in {{mechanical}} <b>servo-systems</b> can severely limit {{the performance of}} high precision positioning and tracking. In this literature survey control methods are discussed which improve the performance of mechanical <b>servo-systems</b> with friction. The control techniques can be divided in non-model-based and model-based techniques. Non-model-based compensation techniques, like PD-control and PID-control are often used to compensate mechanical <b>servo-systems</b> with friction. These techniques do not offer prospects for high performance, due to the variation in the friction force. In order to cope with friction variations, model-based control techniques, like adaptive control tech-niques seem a good alternative. However in literature there is little consensus how to model friction. Robust nonlinear friction compensation is a promising technique, because the technique claims to be robust for friction variations. In literature simple tracking problems with a single mass are considered. Some descriptions dir;cuss specific systems with a particular friction model and a suitable control technique which improves the system performance. Real-life tracking and positioning problems in-volve higher-order dynamics. A comparison with other techniques is not often made. Th...|$|R

40|$|An {{adaptive}} {{neural network}} control problem is addressed for a class of nonlinear hydraulic servo-systems with time-varying state constraints. In view of the low precision problem of the traditional hydraulic <b>servo-system</b> which {{is caused by the}} tracking errors surpassing appropriate bound, the previous works have shown that the constraint for the system {{is a good way to}} solve the low precision problem. Meanwhile, compared with constant constraints, the time-varying state constraints are more general in the actual systems. Therefore, when the states of the system are forced to obey bounded time-varying constraint conditions, the high precision tracking performance of the system can be easily realized. In order to achieve this goal, the time-varying barrier Lyapunov function (TVBLF) is used to prevent the states from violating time-varying constraints. By the backstepping design, the adaptive controller will be obtained. A radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is used to estimate the uncertainties. Based on analyzing the stability of the hydraulic <b>servo-system,</b> we show that the error signals are bounded in the compacts sets; the time-varying state constrains are never violated and all singles of the hydraulic <b>servo-system</b> are bounded.
