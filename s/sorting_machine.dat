25|$|In the United States, {{banknotes}} last {{an average}} of three years until they are no longer fit for circulation, after which they are collected for destruction, usually recycling or shredding. A banknote is removed from the money supply by banks or other financial institutions because of everyday wear and tear from its handling. Banknote bundles are passed through a <b>sorting</b> <b>machine</b> that determines whether a particular note needs to be shredded, or are removed from the supply chain by a human inspector if they are deemed unfit for continued use – for example, if they are mutilated or torn. Counterfeit banknotes are destroyed unless they are needed for evidentiary or forensic purposes.|$|E
25|$|The Mint {{could not}} find a {{suitable}} metal which was sufficiently different in colour to the existing coins and which would not tarnish. This last point was thought to be important because the new coin would be the most valuable coin in general circulation in the world (about £8.40 in today's values). It therefore had to be a different shape; various methods had been used overseas to overcome this problem but none were without drawbacks. A hole through the coin did unacceptable things to the Queen's head (which is a legal requirement on British coins), and wavy-edged, flat-edged or square coins could not be used in the coin-handling machinery which was then coming into increasing use in industry, banking and vending. To be used in a vending or <b>sorting</b> <b>machine</b> a coin would have to roll under gravity and be capable of being measured without being presented in a special way, in other words it needed a constant breadth at whichever angle it was measured.|$|E

Small packages are bagged at the east/west boundary {{and a series of}} conveyor belts, called bullfrogs on the mezzanine. All small packages are sent to a series of <b>sorting</b> <b>machines.</b> The small package sort contains 14 <b>sorting</b> <b>machines,</b> including primary and secondary levels of <b>sorting</b> <b>machines.</b> Small packages are organized and sent to inductors to place small packages on a conveyor of machines. The small packages are read in a tunnel and diverted into their appropriate bags. Once bags are filled, they are placed on a conveyor belt to be sent to the outbound area to be loaded and the full bag is replaced by an empty bag.|$|R
