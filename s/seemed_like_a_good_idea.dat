Lubin Manufacturing Company had been known to produce films similar to other popular ones; film historian Kemp R. Niver observed that [...] "if it <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea,</b> and other film producers were making money, 'Pop' Lubin simply appropriated the title and remade or duped the motion picture." [...] Siegmund Lubin filed a copyright for the film on July 25, 1904. The finished product comprised 600 feet (182 m) of film.|$|E

At the premiere, Destination: Atlantis was on display, featuring behind-the-scenes props {{from the film}} and information on the legend of Atlantis with video games, displays, laser tag, and other attractions. The Aquarium of the Pacific also loaned a variety of fish for display within the attraction.

2500|$|The {{track was}} {{produced}} by Wilson, who intended to encapsulate {{the feel of the}} Drifters' version of [...] "On Broadway". The instrumental was made on April 6, 1965 at United Western Recorders, requiring 44 takes before Wilson could deem a satisfactory performance. Problems had arisen from the tempo and guitar part in the introduction, which fatigued Wilson, engineer Chuck Britz, and the dozen-plus session players. The song did not appear to have lyrics or a title at this juncture, and Wilson can be heard calling the song [...] "Oh Yeah" [...] and [...] "You're Grass and I'm a Power Mower". Wilson remembers: [...] "When we got into the studio with Chuck, he said that he wanted Carl’s twelve-string guitar in the intro to sound more direct. I didn’t know what that meant. 'Can he play it in the booth?' Chuck said. I had never thought about that before, but it <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea.</b> Carl was standing next to me in the booth and all the other musicians were out in the studio. I conducted it like an orchestra." ...|$|E
