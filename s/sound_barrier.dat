5|$|On 1 June 1956, a {{production}} Victor XA917 flown by test pilot Johnny Allam inadvertently exceeded {{the speed of}} sound after Allam let the nose drop slightly at a high power setting. Allam noticed a cockpit indication of Mach 1.1 and ground observers from Watford to Banbury reported hearing a sonic boom. The Victor maintained stability throughout the event. Aviation author Andrew Brookes has claimed that Allam broke the <b>sound</b> <b>barrier</b> knowingly to demonstrate the Victor's superiority to the earlier V-bombers. The Victor was the largest aircraft to have broken the <b>sound</b> <b>barrier</b> at that time.|$|E
5|$|Almost every fighter {{project in}} the postwar era {{immediately}} applied the concept, which started appearing on production fighters in the late 1940s. Avro engineers explored swept-wing and tail modifications to the CF-100 known as the CF-103, which had proceeded to wooden mock-up stage. The CF-103 offered improved transonic performance with supersonic abilities in a dive. However, the basic CF-100 continued to improve through this period, and the advantages were continually eroded. When a CF-100 broke the <b>sound</b> <b>barrier</b> on 18 December 1952, interest in the CF-103 waned.|$|E
5|$|From the Pearblossom Highway exit {{south of}} Palmdale to its {{northern}} terminus at Route 395 near Inyokern, SR 14 {{has been designated}} the Aerospace Highway. Between Pearblossom Highway and Avenue S, there is a vista point overlooking Lake Palmdale, which features a historic plaque that honors aviation accomplishments including the space shuttle, breaking the <b>sound</b> <b>barrier</b> and the speed record. The freeway passes the Los Angeles/Kern County line at Avenue A, and continues to run north through Rosamond and Mojave. In Rosamond, the highway passes close to Edwards Air Force Base, which was often used {{as one of the}} main landing strips for NASA's Space Shuttle, and as the base for the X-15 and many other air and spacecraft.|$|E

5|$|The Victor {{has been}} {{described}} as an agile aircraft, atypical for a large bomber aircraft; in 1958, a Victor had performed several loops and a barrel roll during practices for a display flight at Farnborough Airshow. Manoeuvrability was greatly enabled by the light controls, quick response of the aircraft, and the design of certain flight surfaces such as the infinitely-variable tail-mounted airbrake. The Victor was designed for flight at high subsonic speeds, although multiple instances have occurred in which the <b>sound</b> <b>barrier</b> was broken. During development of the Victor B.2, the RAF had stressed the concept of tactical manoeuvrability, which led to much effort in development being given to increasing the aircraft's height and range performance.|$|E
5|$|After {{one long}} run in The Heiress, Richardson {{appeared}} in another, RCSherriff's Home at Seven, in 1950. He played an amnesiac bank clerk who fears {{he may have}} committed murder. He later recreated the part in a radio broadcast, and in a film version, which was his sole venture into direction for the screen. Once he had played himself into a role in a long run, Richardson felt able to work during the daytime in films, and made two others in the early 1950s beside the film of the Sherriff piece: Outcast of the Islands, directed by Carol Reed, and David Lean's The <b>Sound</b> <b>Barrier,</b> released in 1951 and 1952 respectively. For the latter he won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor. With his characteristic liking for switching between modern roles and the classics, his next stage part was Colonel Vershinin in Three Sisters in 1951. He headed a strong cast, with Renée Asherson, Margaret Leighton and Celia Johnson as the sisters, but reviewers found the production weakly directed, and some felt that Richardson failed to disguise his positive personality when playing the ineffectual Vershinin. He did not attempt Chekhov again {{for more than a}} quarter of a century.|$|E
5|$|East of US131, M-6 crosses over Division Avenue {{and enters}} Gaines Township {{through a series}} of <b>sound</b> <b>barrier</b> walls as the freeway ramps merge back into the main lanes. This area had the highest traffic counts in 2011 at 55,236vehicles per day. Near Kalamazoo Avenue, the freeway passes through an area with retail {{businesses}} and movie theaters {{on each side of the}} interchange; to the northeast is East Kentwood High School. On the approach to the East Paris Avenue underpass, M-6 curves first to the northeast and then back to the southeast, passing near one of Steelcase's office buildings, the pyramid-shaped Corporate Development Center. The freeway begins to curve to the northeast as it crosses into Caledonia Township, with an interchange for M-37 (Broadmoor Avenue) and an overpass for 60th Street. M-6 curves around the southeast side of the Gerald R. Ford International Airport in Cascade Township. As the South Beltline nears I-96, it crosses 48th Street next to the Thornapple Pointe Golf Course. The carriageway splits into ramps for each direction of I-96, the ramps to eastbound I-96 crossing over the Thornapple River in the process. This interchange marks the eastern terminus of the Paul B. Henry South Beltline Freeway. The entire length of the freeway is listed on the National Highway System, a system of roads important to the nation's economy, defense and mobility.|$|E

40|$|First, {{in order}} to check {{the effect of the}} multi-diffraction and {{interference}} <b>sound</b> <b>barriers</b> that have been put into practical use for roads, we installed a device shown in Fig. 2 {{to the top of the}} upright <b>sound</b> <b>barriers</b> in an elevated Shinkansen section and checked the Shinkansen noise reduction effect. The device was installed on a section 200 m long. For comparison purposes, we also attached 200 m-long sound absorbing material to other side <b>barrier</b> walls. The <b>sound</b> absorbing material used is a polyester type that is usually attached on <b>sound</b> <b>barriers</b> of the Shinkansen. We measured noise at the 25 m point in sections with multi-diffraction and interference-type noise reduction devices, in sections with sound absorbing materials and in sections with no devices/ materials. That was done by measuring the A-weighted sound pressure level, which is the 25 m point sound pressure level adjusted to actual auditory sense (hereinafter “noise level”) ...|$|R
