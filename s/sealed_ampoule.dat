50|$|As {{indicated}} in the methodology description, when the IMC method of inserting a <b>sealed</b> <b>ampoule</b> is used, {{it is not possible}} to capture heat flow during the first ca. 40 minutes while the specimen is slowly being brought to the set temperature. In this mode therefore, IMC is best suited to studying processes which start slowly or occur slowly at a given temperature. This caveat also applies to the time before insertion—i.e. time elapsed between preparing a specimen (in which a rate process may then start) and starting the IMC insertion process (Charlebois et al. 2003). This latter effect is usually minimized if the temperature chosen for IMC is substantially higher (e.g. 37 °C) than the temperature at which the specimen is prepared (e.g. 25 °C).|$|E

50|$|A {{graphic display}} {{of a common}} type of IMC data is shown in Fig. 2. At the top is a plot of {{recorded}} heat flow (μ W=μ J/s) vs. time from a specimen in a <b>sealed</b> <b>ampoule,</b> due to an exothermic rate process which begins, accelerates, reaches a peak heat flow and then subsides. Such data are directly useful (e.g. detection of a process and its duration under fixed conditions) but the data are also easily assessed mathematically to determine process parameters. For example, Fig. 2 also shows an integration of the heat flow data, giving accumulated heat (J) vs. time. As shown, parameters such as the maximum growth (heat generation) rate of the process, and the duration time of the lag phase before the process reaches maximum heat can be calculated from the integrated data. Calculations using heat flow rate data stored as computer files are easily automated. Analyzing IMC data in this manner to determine growth parameters has important applications the life sciences (Applications (Biology and Medicine)). Also, heat flow rates obtained at a series of temperatures {{can be used to}} obtain the activation energy of the process being evaluated (Hardison et al. 2003).|$|E
50|$|For {{both the}} {{practical}} application and {{scientific study of}} chalcogenide glasses, glass purity is of utmost importance. Varying levels of trace impurities, even at levels of a few parts per million can alter the spectroscopic behavior of a glass. Similarly, impurities are a major concern for optical components. Impurities in the raw materials and hence in the resulting glass, contribute {{to the loss of}} power through an optical component, whether it {{is in the form of}} a long glass fiber or an infrared window. These impurities contribute to the optical loss through absorption and scattering as well as serving as nucleation sites for crystallization.Although high purity raw elements are now commercially available, with 99.9999% purity routine for many metals, even this level of purity is often not sufficient, particularly for optical fiber applications.More of a concern are commercially available chalcogenide compounds such as germanium sulfide, gallium sulfide or arsenic sulfide. Although these may have been synthesized from high purity elements, the conversion process itself can readily introduce oxide, water or organic impurities. It is not unheard of to find for example, commercial gallium sulphide contaminated with 45% or more gallium oxide through incomplete reaction of the precursors during production.The conventional method for producing chalcogenide glasses is through the use of <b>sealed</b> <b>ampoule</b> melting. In this technique the required glass precursor materials are sealed under vacuum in a silica ampoule, melted, and then quenched to form a glass within the ampoule. The requirement for the sealed atmosphere is dictated by the volatile nature of many of the precursors which if melted in open atmosphere can result in large compositional changes or complete removal of components with low vapour pressures. This process also has the effect of trapping any impurities in the precursors within the glass as thus the precursor purity limitsthe ultimate quality of the glass that is produced. In addition, impurities can be transferred to the glass from the ampoule walls.The closed nature of the process leads to tightly controlled quality. In addition to the open and closed systems for glass melting,chalcogenide chemical vapour deposition is emerging as a method to produce high quality chalcogenide glass, in both thin film and bulk glass form. Gallium lanthanum sulfide glasses use essentially non-volatile components La2S3, La2O3 and Ga2S3 to form the basic glass with glass modifiers added as needed. This allows melting in an open atmosphere, under a flowing inert gas, typically argon. Batches of the compounds are prepared in a nitrogen-purged glovebox, placed in a vitreous carbon crucible and transferred to a silica tube furnace in a sealed vessel. Melting is typically at 1150 °C for 24 hours. The molten gallium sulfides fluxed the lanthanum compounds and incorporated them into the melt at temperatures much lower than their respective melting points. The viscosity of the melt is low enough, at approximately 1 poise to allow full mixing without the need for a rocking furnace which is required for melting in an ampoule. The melt is normally quenched to glass by pushing it into a water cooled jacket. An advantage of melting in an open atmosphere is the ability of volatile impurities to boil off and be carried away, a significant advantage over sealed systems. For example, no SH- impurity is observed in the absorption spectra of Ga-La-S glasses, compared to very significant quantities in sulphide glasses melted by the <b>sealed</b> <b>ampoule</b> technique.|$|E

Extensive outgassing at high temperature under dynamic vacuum significantly reduces that amount. It was found that an important and often dominant source of residual gases is the source material. Considerable quantities of gases, usually carbon oxides, can be produced even by trace amounts of impurities (solid oxides) present in the original source materials.
