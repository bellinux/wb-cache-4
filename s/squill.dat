The west side of the island is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and the seas around Papa Stour are a Special Area of Conservation. The traditional Shetland Pony is still bred.|$|E
5|$|Since {{classical}} {{times and}} possibly much earlier, hundreds of {{species of plants}} have provided drugs to treat {{a wide range of}} conditions. Dioscorides's De Materia Medica, written by 70 AD, listed some 600 medicinal plants and around 1000 drugs made from them, including substances known to be effective such as aconite, aloes, colocynth, colchicum, henbane, opium and <b>squill.</b> The book remained a standard reference for nearly two thousand years, and was the basis of the European pharmacopoeia {{until the end of the}} 19th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{coastline}} is {{well known}} for its colourful flowers including sea aster, sea <b>squill,</b> sea thrift, common sea-lavender, bell and common heather. The Scottish primrose is found only on the coasts of Orkney and nearby Caithness and Sutherland. Although stands of trees are generally rare, a small forest named Happy Valley with 700 trees and lush gardens was created from a boggy hillside near Stenness {{during the second half of}} the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|The steep {{walls of}} the gorge support some rare fauna and flora, {{including}} species unique to the gorge. There are a total of 24 rare plant species and two unique trees: the Bristol and Wilmotts's whitebeams. Other notable plants include Bristol rock cress, Bristol onion, spiked speedwell, autumn <b>squill</b> and honewort. Because of its steep sides, there are {{many parts of the}} gorge on which trees cannot grow, making way for smaller plants. The gorge is also home to rare invertebrate species. The gorge has a microclimate around 1 degree warmer than the surrounding land. The steep south-west facing sides receive the afternoon sunlight, but are partially sheltered from the prevailing winds. When winds come from the Bristol Channel in the north west they may be funnelled into the gorge, creating harsh and wet conditions.|$|E
25|$|The {{area is a}} {{haven for}} seabirds such as fulmar, petrel, cormorant, shag, redshank, {{guillemot}} and razorbill, while the weathered rock formations host a number of plants including sea spleenwort, hare's-foot trefoil, vernal <b>squill,</b> sea fescue and frog orchid.|$|E
25|$|The present garden {{follows a}} layout {{established}} by Mellon. Each flower bed is planted {{with a series}} of Littleleaf lindens and Kennedy saucer magnolias bordered by low hedges of boxwood and American Holly. The outer edge of the flower bed facing the central lawn are edged with boxwood. Perennial flowering plants include delphinium, hollyhock, lavender, and roses. Many seasonal flowers are interspersed to add nearly year round color. Spring blooming bulbs planted in the rose garden include jonquil, daffodil, fritillaria, grape hyacinth, tulips, chionodoxa and <b>squill.</b> Summer blooming annuals change yearly. In the fall chrysanthemum and flowering kale bring color until early winter.|$|E

500|$|De Materia Medica (Latin {{name for}} the Greek work Περὶ ὕλης ἰατρικῆς, Peri hules iatrikēs, both meaning [...] "On Medical Material") is a {{pharmacopoeia}} of herbs and the medicines that {{can be obtained from}} them. The five-volume work describes many drugs known to be effective, including aconite, aloes, colocynth, colchicum, henbane, opium and <b>squill.</b> In all, about 600 plants are covered, along with some animals and mineral substances, and around 1000 medicines made from them.|$|E
500|$|In 1803, Johann Centurius von Hoffmannsegg and Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link {{transferred}} the species to the genus Scilla, and in 1849 Christian August Friedrich Garcke transferred {{it to the}} genus Endymion (now a synonym of Hyacinthoides); it is still widely known as [...] "Scilla non-scripta" [...] or [...] "Endymion non-scriptus". In 1934, Pierre Chouard {{transferred the}} species to its current placement in the genus Hyacinthoides. Scilla was the original Greek name for the sea <b>squill,</b> Drimia maritima; Endymion is a character from Greek mythology; Hyacinthoides means [...] "like a hyacinth".|$|E
500|$|According to Herodotus and Plutarch, Agariste dreamed, a {{few nights}} before Pericles' birth, that she had borne a lion. Interestingly, legends say that Philip II of Macedon had a similar dream before {{the birth of his}} son, Alexander the Great. One {{interpretation}} of the dream treats the lion as a traditional symbol of greatness, but the story may also allude to the unusually large size of Pericles' skull, which became a popular target of contemporary comedians (who called him [...] "Squill-head", after the <b>squill</b> or sea-onion). Although Plutarch claims that this deformity was the reason that Pericles was always depicted wearing a helmet, this is not the case; the helmet was actually the symbol of his official rank as strategos (general).|$|E
60|$|The star-group, of the <b>squills,</b> garlics, and onions, {{has always}} caused me great wonder. I cannot {{understand}} why its beauty, and serviceableness, {{should have been}} associated with the rank scent which has been really among the most powerful means of degrading peasant life, and separating it from that of the higher classes.|$|R

50|$|The {{subfamily}} {{contains many}} popular spring-flowering garden bulbs, such as hyacinths (Hyacinthus), grape hyacinths (Muscari), bluebells (Hyacinthoides) and <b>squills</b> (Scilla). Other members are summer- and autumn-flowering, including Galtonia and Eucomis ('pineapple lilies'). Most are native to Mediterranean climate zones and neighboring {{areas in the}} Mediterranean Basin and South Africa. Others are found in Central Asia, the Far East and South America.|$|R
500|$|The {{landscape}} in Shetland {{is marked by}} the grazing of sheep and the harsh conditions have limited {{the total number of}} plant species to about 400. [...] Native trees such as rowan and crab apple are only found in a few isolated places such as cliffs and loch islands. [...] The flora is dominated by Arctic-alpine plants, wild flowers, moss and lichen. Spring <b>squill,</b> buck's-horn plantain, Scots lovage, roseroot and sea campion are abundant, especially in sheltered places. [...] Shetland mouse-ear (Cerastium nigrescens) is an endemic flowering plant found only in Shetland. It was first recorded in 1837 by botanist Thomas Edmondston. [...] Although reported from two other sites in the nineteenth century, it currently grows only on two serpentine hills on the island of Unst. The nationally scarce oysterplant is found on several islands and the British Red Listed bryophyte Thamnobryum alopecurum has also been recorded.Listed marine algae include: Polysiphonia fibrillosa (Dillwyn) Sprengel, Polysiphonia atlantica Kapraun and J.Norris, Polysiphonia brodiaei (Dillwyn) Sprengel, Polysiphonia elongata (Hudson) Sprengel, Polysiphonia elongella.

500|$|The Avon Gorge {{has been}} {{designated}} as a Site of Special Scientific Interest because it supports some rare fauna and flora, including species unique to the gorge. There are a total of 24 rare plant species and two unique trees: the Bristol and Wilmotts's whitebeams. Other notable plants include Bristol Rock-cress, Bristol onion, Spiked Speedwell, Autumn <b>Squill</b> and Honewort. Other areas along the river which have this designation include Bickley Wood, Cleeve Wood, Hanham for its large population of Bath Asparagus (Ornithogalum pyrenaicum). Stidham Farm near Keynsham contains at least At least [...] of Pleistocene terrace-gravels, consisting of limestone clasts mainly, but also with Millstone Grit, Pennant Sandstone, flint and chert clasts. The site is of considerable importance for studies relating to the possible glaciation of the area, and of the terrace stratigraphy, particularly as {{it is one of}} only two accessible terrace deposits {{in this part of the}} Avon valley. Newton St Loe SSSI is also listed for geological reasons as it represents the only remaining known exposure of fossiliferous Pleistocene gravels along the River Avon. In conjunction with other sites within the wider area, they have aided the development of a scientific understanding of the history of early glaciation within South West England.|$|E

50|$|The soil about Navarino is {{of a red}} colour, and is {{remarkable}} {{for the production of}} an abundance of <b>squills,</b> which are used in medicine. The rocks, which show themselves in every direction through a scanty but rich soil, are limestone, and present a general appearance of unproductiveness round the castle of Navarino; and the absence of trees is ill compensated by the profusion of sage, brooms, cistus, and other shrubs which start from the innumerable cavities of the limestone.|$|R
5000|$|Ammoniacum {{is closely}} related to {{asafoetida}} and galbanum (from which, however, it differs in yielding no umbelliferone) both in regard to the plant which yields it and its putative therapeutical effects. Internally it is used in conjunction with <b>squills</b> in bronchial affections. In asthma and chronic colds it is found useful, but it has no advantages over a number of other substances of more constant and active properties (Sir Thomas Richard Fraser). Only the [...] "tear ammoniacum" [...] is official.|$|R

5000|$|The {{leaves are}} green, strap-like, and grow in pairs. The flowers are borne {{in early spring}} in racemes up to about [...] high. The six tepals are joined at the base to form a tube to about half their length. Like members of the genus Chionodoxa, the bases of the stamens are {{flattened}} and closely clustered {{in the middle of}} the flower; however, unlike Chionodoxa, they are joined to form a cup or corona. In the related genus Scilla (<b>squills),</b> the stamens are not flattened or clustered together. Seeds are borne in three-parted capsules. After the seed ripens in early summer, the plants become dormant until the next spring.|$|R
