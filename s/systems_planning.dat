40|$|Abstract. The {{objective}} of power <b>system</b> <b>planning</b> {{is to meet}} the requirements of the customers of the power supply bureau in a region. In addition, a good <b>system</b> <b>planning</b> is helpful to the construction, operation and power supply of a power system. Using a simulation tool is much more convenient than relying on experience or the pure analysis in theory for power <b>system</b> <b>planning.</b> In this paper a method of <b>system</b> <b>planning</b> by simulation is discussed through a certain case. Based on the results of experiments, it is shown that this is an efficient way to make a power <b>system</b> <b>plan...</b>|$|R
40|$|School <b>system</b> <b>planning</b> {{involves}} {{decisions of}} where {{to build a new}} school, close or expandan existing school. It is important for community members {{to be involved in the}} school <b>system</b> <b>planning</b> process so that the process will be credible, legitimate and equitable. In the Lesser Antilles of the Caribbean, school <b>system</b> <b>planning</b> seems to be silo in nature and is dominated by the Ministry of Education administrators. Likewise in Grenada, school <b>system</b> <b>planning</b> is spearheaded by the Ministry of Education administrators and the ruling government. This thesis examines opportunities and barriers for community members to participate in school <b>system</b> <b>planning</b> in the parish of Saint George in Grenada, a small Caribbean island in the West Indies. A mixed method approach was used in this thesis where a case study was the main strategy of inquiry employed by the researcher. The data collection methods include: questionnaire, semi-structured interview, document analysis and field observation. The research clearly showed that school <b>system</b> <b>planning</b> is silo, lacks community involvement and is ad-hoc in nature with no formal structure for operation. Citizens as well as government officials (participants) are willing to be part of the planning process and they are cognizant of the many opportunities that could be utilized for engagement but realized that the bureaucratic structure of the government hinders their participation. Nevertheless they unanimously stated that school <b>system</b> <b>planning</b> should be more participatory in nature as there are numerous benefits to be realized from such a process.

40|$|In China, {{the rapid}} {{construction}} of ultra-high-voltage (UHV) transmission lines promotes interregional resource optimizing configuration and interregional power <b>system</b> <b>planning.</b> This paper analyzes external environment of interregional power <b>system</b> <b>planning</b> from geographical, technical, and policy environments. Then, the paper takes the minimum system investment cost as the optimization objective and constructs the optimization model of interregional power <b>system</b> <b>planning</b> considering carbon emissions trading (CET) {{and renewable energy}} quota mechanism (REQ). Finally, this paper sets base scenario, carbon emissions trading scenario, renewable energy quota mechanism scenario, and comprehensive scenario for case simulation. The results show that interregional power <b>system</b> <b>planning</b> could connect power grids in different regions, enlarge wind power consumption space, and relieve the inconformity problem between power resource and load demand. CET and REQ can increase the installed proportion of clean energy and reduce carbon dioxide emissions, {{but the cost of}} transmission lines construction and system reserve will increase correspondingly. The optimization effect of REQ on power <b>system</b> <b>planning</b> is better than CET. When they are both introduced, the power structure will reach the best, carbon dioxide emissions will achieve the minimum, and comprehensive benefits will become more balanced...|$|R
40|$|Dyke <b>system</b> <b>planning</b> {{has emerged}} as a {{technical}} solution to the natural occurring floods {{in many parts of the}} developing world, such as the Mekong Delta. The paper applies the theory of integrated flood management to understand the inherent planning process in the system, the established institutional structures and the social perceptions of the dyke system. The paper draws on personal interviews and secondary documents to understand the dyke <b>system</b> <b>planning</b> taking Can Tho City as a case study. The paper discusses the dyke <b>system</b> <b>planning</b> to understand its social reflections in the shallow - average flooded areas in Can Tho City to address contradictory perceptions between techno-centric planners and livelihood-centered local people in flood control to improve life of rural people. The paper reveals the neglectfulness of the social aspects such as participation, local knowledge and experiences of local people in the dyke <b>system</b> <b>planning.</b> The dyke <b>system</b> <b>planning</b> has mainly focused on hydrological and technological aspects to control floods, to protect and develop agricultural production rather than to meet the livelihood needs of rural people. The dyke systems have produced disadvantages for water environment while advantages of floods have been gradually disappeared overtime...|$|R
