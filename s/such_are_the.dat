5|$|Microbes are {{important}} in human culture and health in many ways, serving to ferment foods, treat sewage, produce fuel, enzymes and other bioactive compounds. They are essential tools in biology as model organisms, and have been put to use in biological warfare and bioterrorism. They are a vital component of fertile soils. In the human body microorganisms make up the human microbiota including the essential gut flora. They are the pathogens responsible for many infectious diseases, and as <b>such</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> target of hygiene measures.|$|E
5|$|Sodium is an {{essential}} element for all animals and some plants. Sodium ions are the major cation in the extracellular fluid (ECF) and as <b>such</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> major contributor to the ECF osmotic pressure and ECF compartment volume. Loss {{of water from the}} ECF compartment increases the sodium concentration, a condition called hypernatremia. Isotonic loss of water and sodium from the ECF compartment decreases the size of that compartment in a condition called ECF hypovolemia.|$|E

25|$|Car parks {{which serve}} {{shopping}} centres {{can be built}} adjacent to the centre for easier access at each floor between shops and parking. One example is Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, USA, which has two large car parks attached to the building, at the eastern and western ends. A common position for car parks within shopping centres in the UK is on the roof, around the various utility systems, enabling customers to take lifts straight down into the centre. Examples of <b>such</b> <b>are</b> <b>The</b> Oracle in Reading and Festival Place in Basingstoke.|$|E
25|$|Cities, like municipalities, are {{composed}} of barangays, which can range from urban neighborhoods (such as Brgy. 9, Santa Angela in Laoag), to rural communities (such as Brgy. Iwahig in Puerto Princesa). Barangays are sometimes grouped into officially defined administrative (geographical) districts. Examples of <b>such</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> cities of Manila (16 districts), Davao (11 districts), Iloilo (seven districts), and Samal (three districts: Babak, Kaputian and Peñaplata). Some cities such as Caloocan, Manila and Pasay even have an intermediate level between the district and barangay levels, called a zone. However, geographic districts and zones are not political units; there are no elected city government officials in these city-specific administrative levels. Rather they only serve to make city planning, statistics-gathering other administrative tasks easier and more convenient.|$|E

The rest is carried off by the Awash, which runs out in the saline lacustrine district {{along the border with}} Djibouti; by the Shebelle River and the Jubba, which flow southeast through Somalia, though the Shebelle fails to reach the Indian Ocean; and by the Omo, the main feeder of the closed basin of Lake Turkana.|$|E

25|$|In South African waters, the wrecks {{of ships}} or aircraft, and any {{associated}} cargo, debris or artifact more than 60 {{years old and}} are protected by the National Heritage Resources Act number 25 of 1999 (NHRA). The law of salvage and finds {{does not apply to}} historical shipwrecks, which are considered by the NHRA to be archaeological material, and as <b>such</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> property of the state, administered by SAHRA in trust for the nation, and may not be disturbed in any way except under the terms of a permit issued by the South African Heritage Resources Agency (SAHRA). There are severe penalties for contravening the Act, including heavy fines and jail terms. All members of the South African Police Services, and Customs and Excise officers may act as Heritage Inspectors in terms of the Act, with powers of search, confiscation and arrest. Historical wrecks may be visited provided that the sites are not disturbed or interfered with and no artifacts are removed or damaged.|$|E
25|$|I {{think that}} in no country in the civilized world is less {{attention}} paid to philosophy than in the United States... Nevertheless {{it is easy to}} perceive that almost all the inhabitants of the United States conduct their understanding in the same manner, and govern it by the same rules; that is to say, that without ever having taken the trouble to define the rules of a philosophical method, they are in possession of one, common to the whole people. To evade the bondage of system and habit, of family maxims, class opinions, and, in some degree, of national prejudices; to accept tradition only as a means of information, and existing facts only as a lesson used in doing otherwise, and doing better; to seek the reason of things for one's self, and in one's self alone; to tend to results without being bound to means, and to aim at the substance through the form; – <b>such</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> principal characteristics of what I shall call the philosophical method of the Americans... most of the operations of the mind, each American appeals to the individual exercise of his own understanding alone.|$|E

However, completion of the construction work {{did not result in}} an end to the difficulties for those involved in its operations. The easiest landing is at Riston's Gully, which intersects the rock near the tower. An unaided landing has been described as [...] "like climbing up the side of a bottle". A system of ropes attached to a derrick was installed to assist these dangerous operations. Statistics compiled for the two decades from 1881–1890 showed Skerryvore as having been the stormiest part of Scotland. There were a total of 542storms lasting 14,211hours during that period. One keeper lost his hearing for several weeks, after a lightning strike had thrown him through the entrance door.|$|E
500|$|In addition, Holder {{believes}} that a further 14 cohortes, which are attested under Trajan, immediately before Hadrian's rule, but not during or after it, probably continued in existence, giving a total of 381 units and 225,000 effectives. The discrepancy between the two scholars is due to: (i) Interpretation of units with the same name and number, but attested in different provinces in the same period. Spaul tends {{to take a more}} cautious approach and to assume <b>such</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> same unit moving base frequently, while Holder tends to regard them as separate units which acquired the same number due to duplicated (or even triplicated) seriation. (ii) Assumptions about how many cohortes were equitatae. Spaul accepts only those cohortes specifically attested as equitatae i.e., about 40% of recorded units. Holder estimates that at least 70% of cohortes contained cavalry contingents by the early 2nd century ...|$|E
500|$|Still, a {{wide range}} of {{viewpoints}} exist. The view that animals have moral rights (animal rights) is a philosophical position proposed by Tom Regan, among others, who argues that animals are beings with beliefs and desires, and as <b>such</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> [...] "subjects of a life" [...] with moral value and therefore moral rights. Regan still sees ethical differences between killing human and non-human animals, and argues that to save the former it is permissible to kill the latter. Likewise, a [...] "moral dilemma" [...] view suggests that avoiding potential benefit to humans is unacceptable on similar grounds, and holds the issue to be a dilemma in balancing such harm to humans to the harm done to animals in research. In contrast, an abolitionist view in animal rights holds that there is no moral justification for any harmful research on animals that is not to the benefit of the individual animal. Bernard Rollin argues that benefits to human beings cannot outweigh animal suffering, and that human beings have no moral right to use an animal in ways that do not benefit that individual. Another prominent position is that of philosopher Peter Singer, who argues that there are no grounds to include a being's species in considerations of whether their suffering is important in utilitarian moral considerations. Malcolm Macleod and collaborators argue that most controlled animal studies do not employ randomization, allocation concealment, and blinding outcome assessment, and that failure to employ these features exaggerates the apparent benefit of drugs tested in animals, leading to a failure to translate much animal research for human benefit.|$|E
