A full outline of {{the various types of}} MRF operations is given by the Institute of Wastes Management (IWM 2000). This review concentrates on MRFs used to sort and process sourcesegregated household and commercial waste, the most common type.

40|$|The {{perioperative}} {{management of}} patients with inflammatory bowel disease is challenging given the altered immune system that results {{from a variety of}} biologic and immunomodulator therapies. Clinicians are often faced with challenges and complicated equations when deciding on the type and dose of medication. To understand the effect of these medications and review the evidence regarding the management of these medications in the perioperative setting, a PubMed-based literature search (January 1, 1960, through April 1, 2011) was conducted using the following search terms: perioperative management, risk, outcome, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, aminosalicylates, glucocorticoids, purine analogues, cyclosporine, methotrexate, biologic therapy, infliximab, and thromboembolism. The 414 articles identified were <b>manually</b> <b>sorted</b> <b>to</b> exclude those that did not address perioperative risk, outcomes, and medications in the abstracts, yielding 84 articles for review. Additional references were obtained from the citations within the retrieved articles. This review surveys the findings of the selected articles and presents guidelines and resources for perioperative medication management for patients with inflammatory bowel disease undergoing surgery...|$|R

40|$|Coastal plastic {{pollution}} {{is a common}} problem in many coastal regions in Malaysia. Arising from environmental concern {{and at the same}} time supporting waste to wealth program, the best way to overcome coastal plastic {{pollution is}} by recycling. However, due to photo degradation and nature of the surroundings, the characteristics of coastal plastic waste are differ from land plastic waste that drives for further research in determining the characteristics of coastal plastic waste and discovering its potential value. The objectives of this study are to improve the characteristics of mechanical properties of coastal plastic waste by heterogeneous recycling, to compare the mechanical properties of heterogeneous coastal plastic waste with the commercial plastic and to study the potential value of heterogeneous coastal plastic waste. Polypropylene (PP) and Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), two types of plastic waste which are highly abundant at the coastal region for its great consuming in food and beverages packaging and containers are used as sample. Samples are collected, cleaned and <b>sorted</b> <b>manually</b> according <b>to</b> the types and crushed into small flakes. PP and PET are mixed by volume composition of 0 %, 3 %, 5 %, 7 % and 10 % of PET before undergo extrusion process. Under extrusion process, the plastic is extruded to strands and then pelletized to produce a single-polymer plastic. Then, plastic is moulded into testing specimen according to standard measurement, ASTM D 638 - 05 and tested in term of its mechanical properties- tensile strength, elongation at break and elastic modulus- by using Universal Testing Machine. From analysis of obtained result, the mechanical properties of mixed heterogeneous coastal plastic waste are poor compared to homogeneous recycling except for elastic modulus. However, at 7 % composition of recycle PET, it shows the optimum mixing ratio which gives better of mechanical properties. Homogeneous recycled plastic has the close and almost similar mechanical properties as the commercial plastic and have the potential to be utilized in some application as in producing household items. Varying the mechanical testing and blending polymers with plastic additives can be applied in further research for improvement of mechanical characteristics of recycled materials...|$|R

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of color sorting on reducing aflatoxin levels in shelled apricot kernels was assessed. Naturally-contaminated kernels were submitted to an electronic optical sorter or blanched, peeled, and <b>manually</b> <b>sorted</b> <b>to</b> visually identify and sort discolored kernels (dark and spotted) from healthy ones. The samples {{obtained from the}} two sorting approaches were ground, homogenized, and analysed by HPLC-FLD for their aflatoxin content. A mass balance approach {{was used to measure}} the distribution of aflatoxins in the collected fractions. Aflatoxin B 1 and B 2 were identified and quantitated in all collected fractions at levels ranging from 1. 7 to 22, 451. 5 µg/kg of AFB 1 + AFB 2, whereas AFG 1 and AFG 2 were not detected. Excellent results were obtained by manual sorting of peeled kernels since the removal of discolored kernels (2. 6 %– 19. 9 % of total peeled kernels) removed 97. 3 %– 99. 5 % of total aflatoxins. The combination of peeling and visual/manual separation of discolored kernels is a feasible strategy to remove 97 %– 99 % of aflatoxins accumulated in naturally-contaminated samples. Electronic optical sorter gave highly variable results since the amount of AFB 1 + AFB 2 measured in rejected fractions (15 %– 18 % of total kernels) ranged from 13 % to 59 % of total aflatoxins. An improved immunoaffinity-based HPLC-FLD method having low limits of detection for the four aflatoxins (0. 01 – 0. 05 µg/kg) was developed and used to monitor the occurrence of aflatoxins in 47 commercial products containing apricot kernels and/or almonds commercialized in Italy. Low aflatoxin levels were found in 38 % of the tested samples and ranged from 0. 06 to 1. 50 μg/kg for AFB 1 and from 0. 06 to 1. 79 μg/kg for total aflatoxins...|$|R

In many places of the country pilot projects have been launched to test the technology and logistics of sorting, collecting, processing and utilizing biodegradable municipal waste separated by residents. Separate collection of biodegradable municipal waste in Kroměříž was launched as a pilot project in 1992. Despite all the residents’ education, the management of Biopas is not satisfied with the quality of biodegradable waste separation; problems occur especially in the residential area. Biodegradable waste separated by residents, due to its unacceptable amount of impurities, is transported to the landfill Kuchyňky near the village Zdounky 10 km distant but detailed data on the amount of impurities in separate biodegradable municipal waste were missing.
