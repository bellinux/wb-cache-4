40|$|This report {{describes}} {{development of}} micro-fabricated piezoelectric ultrasonic motors and bulk-ceramic piezoelectric ultrasonic motors. Ultrasonic motors offer {{the advantage of}} low speed, high torque operation {{without the need for}} gears. They can be made compact and lightweight and provide a holding torque in the absence of applied power, due to the traveling wave frictional coupling mechanism between the rotor and the stator. This report covers modeling, simulation, fabrication and testing of ultrasonic motors. Design of experiments methods were also utilized to find optimal motor parameters. A suite of 8 mm diameter x 3 mm tall motors were machined for these studies and maximum <b>stall</b> <b>torques</b> as large as 10 ^(- 3) Nm, maximum no-load speeds of 1710 rpm and peak power outputs of 27 mW were realized. Aditionally, this report describes the implementation of a microfabricated ultrasonic motor using thin-film lead zirconate titanate. In a joint project with the Pennsylvania State University Materials Research Laboratory and MIT Lincoln Laboratory, 2 mm and 5 mm diameter stator structures were fabricated on 1 micron thick silicon nitride membranes. Small glass lenses placed down on top spun at 100 - 300 rpm with 4 V excitation at 90 kHz.

50|$|A blocked rotor test is {{conducted}} on an induction motor. It {{is also known}} as short circuit test, locked rotor test or <b>stalled</b> <b>torque</b> test. From this test, short circuit current at normal voltage, power factor on short circuit, total leakage reactance, and starting torque of the motor can be found. The test {{is conducted}} at low voltage because if the applied voltage was normal voltage then the current through the stator windings would be high enough to overheat the windings and damage them. The blocked rotor torque test is not performed on wound-rotor motors because the starting torque can be varied as desired. However, a blocked rotor current test is conducted on squirrel cage rotor motors.|$|R

50|$|The winding {{specifications}} affect motor performance the most. Changing {{the number}} of turns per slot or the diameter of magnet wire produces results that differ greatly from each other. Environmental temperature affects the magnetic forces of magnets and the winding resistance, and so indicates changes in motor performance. Changing anisotropic magnets from wet to dry results in decreasing <b>stall</b> <b>torques</b> and increasing no-load speed due to the magnetic force being weakened. Magnets are held in a housing for their full capability, while using a thin-wall housing will result in magnetic force leaking through the housing wall. That is where magnet yokes are used to prevent magnetic leakage, thus maintaining the full capacity of the magnets. Phase refers to positional relations between the center line of each polar magnet and the switching position of commutator segments and brushes. Lagging in phase causes inefficiency, electrical noise, and shortened life. To avoid these situations, improved motors are assembled with forward brush-shifting that offsets the armature reaction during load operation to keep them on neutral electrically.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{external}} torque on the F 1 -ATPase rotary molecular motor are studied {{from the viewpoint}} of recent advances in stochastic thermodynamics. This motor is modeled in terms of discrete-state and continuous-state stochastic processes. The dependence of the discrete-state description on external torque and friction is obtained by fitting its transition rates to a continuous-angle model based on Newtonian mechanics with Langevin fluctuating forces and reproducing experimental data on this motor. In this approach, the continuous-angle model is coarse-grained into discrete states separated by both mechanical and chemical transitions. The resulting discrete-state model allows us to identify the regime of tight chemomechanical coupling of the F 1 motor and to infer that its chemical and mechanical efficiencies may reach values close to the thermodynamically allowed maxima near the <b>stalling</b> <b>torque.</b> We also show that, under physiological conditions, the F 1 motor is functioning in a highly-nonlinear- response regime, providing a rotation rate a million times faster than would be possible in the linear-response regime of nonequilibrium thermodynamics. Furthermore, the counting statistics of fluctuations can be obtained in the tight-coupling regime thanks to the discrete-state stochastic process and we demonstrate that the so-called fluctuation theorem provides a useful method for measuring the thermodynamic forces driving the motor out of equilibrium. © 2010 World Scientific Publishing Company.

The research objective was to evaluate the capabilities of specific actuator motor and gearbox assemblies under various design basis loading conditions. The testing was performed using the motor-operated valve load simulator, a test fixture that simulates the stem load profiles a valve actuator would experience when closing a valve against flow and pressure loadings. The authors tested five typical motors (four ac motors and one dc motor) with three gearbox assemblies at conditions a motor might experience in a power plant, including such off-normal conditions as operation at high temperature and reduced voltage. The authors also determined {{the efficiency of the}} actuator gearbox. The testing produced the following significant results: all five motors operated at or above their rated torque during tests at full voltage and ambient temperature; for all five motors (dc as well as ac), the actual torque loss due to voltage degradation was greater than the torque loss predicted using common methods; startup torques in locked rotor tests compared well with <b>stall</b> <b>torques</b> in dynamometer-type tests; the methods commonly used to predict torque losses due to elevated operating temperatures sometimes bounded the actual losses, but not in all cases; the greatest discrepancy involved the prediction for the dc motor; running efficiencies published by the manufacturer for actuator gearboxes were higher than the actual efficiencies determined from testing, in some instances, the published pullout efficiencies were also higher than the actual values; operation of the gearbox at elevated temperature did not affect the operating efficiency...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 This study {{investigates the}} {{feasibility}} of a micro-scale tidal hydrokinetic generator to power autonomous oceanographic instrumentation, with emphasis on turbine design and performance. This type of "micropower" system is intended to provide continuous power {{on the order of}} 20 Watts. System components are reviewed and include turbine, electrical generator, gearbox, controller, converter, and battery bank. A steady-state model predicts system energy storage and power output in a mixed, mainly semidiurnal tidal regime with peak currents of 1. 5 m/s. Among several turbine designs reviewed, a helical cross-flow turbine is selected, due to its self-start capability, ability to accept inflow from any direction, and power performance. Parameters impacting helical turbine design include radius, blade profile and pitch, aspect ratio, helical pitch, number of blades, solidity ratio, blade wrap ratio, strut design, and shaft diameter. The performance trade-offs of each are compared. A set of three prototype-scale turbines (two three-bladed designs, with 15 % and 30 % solidity, and a four-bladed design with 30 % solidity and higher helical pitch) and several strut and shaft configurations were fabricated and tested in a water flume capable of flow rates up to 0. 8 m/s. Tests included performance characterization of the rotating turbines from freewheel to <b>stall,</b> static <b>torque</b> characterization as a function of azimuthal angle, performance degradation associated with inclination angles up to 10 ° from vertical, and stream-wise wake velocity profiles. A four-bladed turbine with 60 ° helical pitch, 30 % solidity, and circular plate "end cap" provided the best performance; this design attained efficiency of 24 % in 0. 8 m/s flow and experienced smaller performance reductions for tilted orientations relative to other variants. Maximum turbine efficiency increased with increased flume velocity. A free-vortex model was modified to simulate the helical turbine performance. Model results were compared to experimental data for various strut design and inflow velocities, and performance was extrapolated to higher flume velocities and a full-scale turbine (0. 7 m 2 relative to 0. 04 m 2 in flume tests). The model predicts experimental trends correctly but deviates from experimental values for some conditions, indicating the need for further study of secondary effects for a high chord-to-radius ratio turbine...|$|R
50|$|Motor {{performance}} {{depends on}} three {{elements such as}} voltage across terminals, resistance across terminals, and magnetic force. These are influenced directly by such factors as voltage and type of power supply, number of turns per winding slot and diameter of magnetic wire, environmental temperature, type of magnet, flux yoke andphase. If only the voltage of the power supply changes, the change in motor performance is {{in direct proportion to}} that change in voltage. Unlike the constant-voltage power supply, the power supply with resistance will have a voltage drop due to its internal resistance, causing the stall current and, therefore, the <b>stall</b> <b>torque</b> to drop with the speed line bottomed to the left.|$|E
50|$|Each motor {{ships with}} a torque based {{performance}} chart showing {{the relationship between}} torque and speed, {{which is the most}} important performance indicator for a motor. The no-load speed is the number of rotations per minute of the motor shaft when voltage is applied between the terminals with no load to the motor. No-load current is the current discharged when voltage is applied between the terminals with no load to the motor. <b>Stall</b> <b>torque</b> is when the motor rotation stalls upon increasing the load to the rotating motor, while stall current is when the motor rotation stalls upon increasing the load to the rotating motor. The physics formula E = M (electrical energy input equals mechanical energy output) demonstrates the conservation of energy principle at work in a Mabuchi motor (voltage x current) divided by (efficiency expressed as a percentage) equals (speed in revolutions per minute x torque mN.m g.cm).|$|E
50|$|Series wound {{electric}} motors respond to increased load by slowing down; the current increases and the torque rises {{in proportion to}} the square of the current since the same current flows in both the armature and the field windings. If the motor is stalled, the current is limited only by the total resistance of the windings and the torque can be very high, and there is a danger of the windings becoming overheated. The counter-EMF aids the armature resistance to limit the current through the armature. When power is first applied to a motor, the armature does not rotate. At that instant, the counter-EMF is zero and the only factor limiting the armature current is the armature resistance. Usually the armature resistance of a motor is low; therefore the current through the armature would be very large when the power is applied. Therefore the need can arise for an additional resistance in series with the armature to limit the current until the motor rotation can build up the counter-EMF. As the motor rotation builds up, the resistance is gradually cut out. The speed-torque characteristic is an almost perfectly straight line between the <b>stall</b> <b>torque</b> and the no-load speed. This suits large inertial loads as the speed will drop until the motor slowly starts to rotate and these motors have a very high stalling torque.|$|E

50|$|Even {{with the}} benefit of the one-way stator clutch, a {{converter}} cannot achieve the same level of efficiency in the coupling phase as an equivalently sized fluid coupling. Some loss is due to the presence of the stator (even though rotating as part of the assembly), as it always generates some power-absorbing turbulence. Most of the loss, however, is caused by the curved and angled turbine blades, which do not absorb kinetic energy from the fluid mass as well as radially straight blades. Since the turbine blade geometry is a crucial factor in the converter's ability to multiply torque, trade-offs between torque multiplication and coupling efficiency are inevitable. In automotive applications, where steady improvements in fuel economy have been mandated by market forces and government edict, the nearly universal use of a lock-up clutch has helped to eliminate the converter from the efficiency equation during cruising operation. The maximum amount of torque multiplication produced by a converter is highly dependent on the size and geometry of the turbine and stator blades, and is generated only when the converter is at or near the stall phase of operation. Typical <b>stall</b> <b>torque</b> multiplication ratios range from 1.8:1 to 2.5:1 for most automotive applications (although multi-element designs as used in the Buick Dynaflow and Chevrolet Turboglide could produce more). Specialized converters designed for industrial, rail, or heavy marine power transmission systems are capable of as much as 5.0:1 multiplication. Generally speaking, there is a trade-off between maximum torque multiplication and efficiency - high stall ratio converters tend to be relatively inefficient below the coupling speed, whereas low stall ratio converters tend to provide less possible torque multiplication.|$|E

A functional dynamometer and thermodynamic apparatus were constructed once the model was confirmed to be within the experimental uncertainty. Results of the experiments show that the experimental turbine at 65 PSI has a speed of approximately 27, 000 RPM and a measured <b>stall</b> <b>torque</b> of 0. 1279 N&# 8208;m. 65 PSI is an important data point because that data set is the cut&# 8208;off from laminar to turbulent flow.
