40|$|A {{new phase}} [PtIn 6](GeO 4) 2 O, a filled variant of [PtIn 6](GaO 4) 2, and the solid {{solution}} [PtIn 6](GaO 4) 2 -x(GeO 4) xOx/ 2 (0 < x < 2) were prepared and characterized. Single-crystal structure refinements show that [PtIn 6](GeO 4) 2 O is isotypic with the mineral, <b>sulfohalite</b> Na 6 FCl(SO 4) 2, and crystallizes {{in the space}} group Fmm (Z = 4) with a = 1006. 0 (1) pm. The building units of [PtIn 6](GeO 4) 2 O are isolated [PtIn 6] 10 + octahedra and (GeO 4) 4 - tetrahedra, and the isolated O 2 - ions occupy the centers of the In 6 octahedra made up of six adjacent PtIn 6 octahedra. The lattice parameter of the solid solution [PtIn 6](GaO 4) 2 -x(GeO 4) xOx/ 2 (0 < x < 2) varies gradually from a = 1001. 3 (1) pm at x = 0 to a = 1006. 0 (1) pm at x = 2, {{and the color of}} the solid solution changes gradually from black (x = 0) to red (x = 1) to yellow (x = 2). The cause for the gradual color change was examined by performing density functional theory electronic structure calculations for the end members [PtIn 6](GaO 4) 2 and [PtIn 6](GeO 4) 2 O. Our analysis indicates that an oxygen atom {{at the center of a}} In 6 octahedron cuts the In 5 p/In 5 p bonding interactions between adjacent [PtIn 6] 10 + octahedra thereby raising the bottom of the conduction bands, and the resulting quantum dot effect is responsible for the color change...|$|E
