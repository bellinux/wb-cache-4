40|$|Purpose of {{this paper}} The {{transportation}} of hazardous materials exposes to major risk aspects {{not only for the}} personnel involved in transportation but for the environment as well. In view of this, the research aimed to identify various categorical risks that are to be identified, analysed and mitigated accordingly. As {{for the safety of the}} material and the transport, such factors as the flow, structure and volume of the material need to be examined continuously (Verma, 2009). The evaluation of the risk factors is thus essential for the safety of hazardous materials and its transportations. Design/methodology/approach The proposed methodology follows with a comprehensive literature review of identifying the various hazardous materials and their degree of hazard-ness and then analysing the safety measures through an industry focused case study approach. Findings The research develops an initial framework as well as measures of <b>safety</b> aspects <b>in</b> <b>handling</b> hazardous material transportations. The research identified some gaps <b>in</b> following <b>safety</b> aspects while Transporting Hazardous Materials in developing countries mainly from the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries logistical operations. Research limitations/implications (if applicable) The research is therefore limited to the GCC region. Further, an in-depth understanding of <b>safety</b> aspects <b>in</b> <b>handling</b> hazardous material would help the logistics industry, in providing better proactive safety mechanism among the Logistics Service Providers (LSPs). Practical implications (if applicable) : The transportation of hazardous materials has always been existing as a critical business because of the magnitude of any mismanagement and operations. This can be attributed to the fact that it not only affects the environment but also the driver 2 ̆ 7 s /employees life at risk. In view of this the research contributes to both the theory and practice of material handling, transportation and logistics. Paper Type: Research pape...|$|R

40|$|In the United States alone {{there are}} 100 {{million gallons of}} {{high-level}} nuclear wastes (HLWs) in various chemical forms awaiting eventual disposal in geologic repositories.

For this reason, one of the criteria for selecting HLW glass compositions has been chemical durability against attack by ground water. While the effects of radiation on chemical durability have therefore been studied extensively, little consideration has been given to the possibility that self-irradiation of HLW glasses may lead to modes of chemical decomposition which render them unstable even in the absence of exposure to ground water.

40|$|Determination of the glomerular {{filtration}} rate (GFR) {{is generally considered}} {{as the most important}} parameter of quantifying renal function. The GFR is determined as renal or plasma clearance of an ideal filtration marker which is freely filtered by the kidney, does not undergo metabolism, tubular secretion or absorption. Markers that fulfil these demands are inulin, 51 Cr-EDTA, 99 mTc-DTPA, labelled or unlabelled contrast media. The renal clearance of inulin is the classic reference method for estimation of the GFR. This method is however not practical for routine clinical purposes. Radionucleids have therefore been used as alternative filtration markers since the 60 s. Drawbacks related to radiation exposure especially in children and pregnant women and the <b>safety</b> <b>in</b> <b>handling</b> radiolabelled markers have led to an increasing interest in using non-radioactive markers. The development of simple and reliable methods to determine the concentration of contrast media in plasma and urine, such as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and X-ray fluorescence analysis have made this possible.

40|$|The end of {{the cold}} war has {{resulted}} in excess PCMs from nuclear weapons and associated production facilities. Consequently, the US government has undertaken studies to determine how best to manage and dispose of this excess material. The issues include (a) ensurance of domestic health, environment, and <b>safety</b> <b>in</b> <b>handling,</b> storage, and disposition, (b) international arms control agreements with Russia and other countries, and (c) economics. One major set of options is to convert the PCMs into glass for storage or disposal. The chemically inert characteristics of glasses make them a desirable chemical form for storage or disposal of radioactive materials. A glass may contain only plutonium, or it may contain plutonium along with other radioactive materials and nonradioactive materials. GMODS is a new process for the direct conversion of PCMs (i. e., plutonium metal, scrap, and residues) to glass. The plutonium content of these materials varies from a fraction of a percent to pure plutonium. GMODS has the capability to also convert other metals, ceramics, and amorphous solids to glass, destroy organics, and convert chloride-containing materials into a low-chloride glass and a secondary clean chloride salt strewn.

The quantity of digested DNA, the concentrations of the probe in the hybridization step and the concentration of the anti-body conjugate for the detection process were optimized. The improvements from the original protocol for the DIG System were {{an increase in the}} concentration of the labeled probe in the hybridization step and in the concentration of the anti-digoxigenin-AP conjugate in the detection process.
