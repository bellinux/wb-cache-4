40|$|Abstract- An {{acoustic}} wave actuated microgenerator for power system applications in mobile phone was design, fabricated, and characterized. We used the {{acoustic wave}} of human voices or speakerphone {{by way of}} an electromagnetic transducer to produce electrical power for charging or to run a portable electronic device. The proposed microgenerator is composed of a planar coil, a <b>suspension</b> <b>plate</b> with supporting beams and a permanent magnet. In this paper, the dynamic response of the suspension structure and the variation of the induced magnetic flux were characterized by using commercial finite element analysis and Ansoft Maxwell EM 3 D software, respectively. The electroplating nickel and silicon bulk micromachining techniques were used to fabricate the <b>suspension</b> <b>plate</b> and planar coil, and by integrating a permanent magnet as well as wafer to wafer adhesion bonding to accomplish the microgenerator assembly. The experimental results shown the typical microgenerator with a planar dimension of 3 mm × 3 mm, the maximum induce-voltage 0. 24 mV was generated at the driving frequency of 470 Hz. The dynamic response of microgenerator can be designed to meet a specific acoustic driving frequency {{to increase the efficiency}} of energy harvesting. I...|$|E

40|$|Presence of {{mycoplasma}} {{organisms in}} tissue culture systems and virus pools {{was detected by}} titration of the contaminated material on agarose-suspended BHK 21 / 13 S cells. The use of this method permitted isolation of mycoplasmas {{which could not be}} detected by standard assay methods. Mycoplasma colonies at concentrations ranging from 104 to 106 colony-forming units/ml in agarose-BHK 21 / 13 S media could be distinguished from virus plaques, and the two populations of microorganisms could be easily disassociated either by electron microscopy or by biological methods. All isolated mycoplasmas were identified in growth inhibition tests as belonging to the GDL group.

40|$|Abstract. The {{object of}} this work was to obtain the Ni+MoS 2 {{composite}} electrocoatings by in situ co-deposition of molybdenum(IV) sulfide particles (< 2 µm) and nickel from a <b>suspension</b> <b>plating</b> bath. Physical and chemical characterization of the coatings was carried out using SEM, EDS, and XRD methods. The chemical composition of these coatings of a diphase structure (Ni, MoS 2) {{was found to be}} dependent on the current density and temperature of electrodeposition. The optimal electrochemical conditions for embedding of the maximum amount of 26. 4 wt. % of MoS 2 into the crystalline nickel matrix, were experimentally determined. The co-deposition process of MoS 2 particles and metallic nickel was discussed based on the adsorption mechanism. Such porous Ni+MoS 2 composite coatings can be proposed as electrode material for hydrogen electroevolution...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of rat transitional epithelial cells grown on conventional nonpermeable surfaces was compared with development on permeable collagen supports. On glass or plastic surfaces, cells grew as expanding monolayer sheets. Once confluent, growth continued with a bilayer being formed {{in most areas}} and apical cells being continuously sloughed off. Although most cells were interconnected by desmosomes, and junctional complexes were formed, no other indications of differentiation were observed. After 2 - 3 wk of growth, division stopped and cell death ensued. In contrast, single-cell <b>suspensions</b> <b>plated</b> on collagencoated nylon disks reassociated into multicellular islands and commenced growth.

40|$|Three {{different}} aeration {{plates are}} used to study their effect on gas holdup and flow regime transition in fiber <b>suspensions.</b> The aeration <b>plates</b> differ by their open-area ratios (A= 0. 57 %, 0. 99 %, and 2. 14 %), where the hole diameter remains the same {{while the number of}} holes increase. Experiments are performed using three different Rayon fiber lengths (L= 3, 6, and 12 mm) over a range of superficial gas velocities (Ug⩽ 18 cm/s) and fiber mass fractions (0 ⩽C⩽ 1. 8 %) in a 15. 24 cm dia semi-batch bubble column. Experimental results show that the aeration plate with A= 0. 99 % produces the highest gas holdup in an air-water system and low fiber mass fraction <b>suspensions,</b> and the <b>plate</b> with A= 2. 14 % yields the lowest gas holdup in these systems. In medium fiber mass fraction <b>suspensions,</b> the <b>plate</b> with A= 0. 57 % produces slightly higher gas holdup values, while the other two plates yield similar results. The effect of the aeration plate open area on gas holdup diminishes at high fiber mass fractions (C⩾ 1. 2 %). All aeration plates generate homogeneous, transitional, and heterogeneous flow regimes over the range of superficial gas velocities for air-water and low fiber mass fraction suspensions. However, the aeration plate with A= 2. 14 % enhances the flow regime transition, i. e., the superficial gas velocity at which transitional flow appears is lower. Additionally, the fiber mass fraction at which pure heterogeneous flow is observed is lower when A= 2. 14 %...|$|R
