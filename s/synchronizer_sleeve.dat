40|$|The Dual Clutch Transmission (DCT) is a {{relatively}} new kind of transmission which shows increased efficiency and comfort compared to manual transmissions. Its construction is much like two parallell manual transmissions, where the gearshifts are controlled automatically. The gear-shift of a manual transmission involves a synchronization process, which synchronizes and locks the input shaft to the output shaft via the desired gear ratio. This process, which means transportation of a <b>synchronizer</b> <b>sleeve,</b> is performed by moving the gear shift lever which is connected to the sleeve. In a DCT, there is no mechanical connection between the gear-shift lever and the sleeve. Hence, an actuator system, controlled by a control system, must be used. This report includes modelling, control system design and simulation results of a DCT synchronization process. The thesis work is performed at GM Powertrain (GMPT) in Trollhättan. At the time of this thesis, there is no DCT produced by GM, and therefore the results and conclusions rely on simulations. Most of the used system parameters are reasonable values collected from employees at GMPT and manual transmission literature. The focus of the control design is to achieve a smooth, rather than fast, movement of the <b>synchronizer</b> <b>sleeve.</b> Simulations show that a synchronization process can be performed in less than 400 ms under normal conditions. The biggest problems controlling the sleeve position occur if there is a large amount of drag torque affecting the input shaft. Delay problems also worsen the performance a lot. An attempt to predict the <b>synchronizer</b> <b>sleeve</b> position is made and simulations shows advantages of that. Some further work is needed before the developed control software can be used on a real DCT. Investigations of sensor noise robustness and the impact of dogging forces are the most important issues to be further investigated. Implementation of additional functionality for handling special conditions are also needed...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{developments}} of {{pure electric vehicles}} have shown that pure electric vehicles equipped with two-speed or multi-speed gearbox possess higher energy efficiency by ensuring the drive motor operates at its peak performance range. This article presents the design, analysis, and control of a two-speed automatic mechanical transmission for pure electric vehicles. The shift actuator {{is based on a}} motor-controlled camshaft where a special geometric groove is machined, and the camshaft realizes the axial positions of the <b>synchronizer</b> <b>sleeve</b> for gear engaging, disengaging, and speed control of the drive motor. Based on the force analysis of shift process, the parameters of shift actuator and shift motor are designed. The drive motor’s torque control strategy before shifting, speed governing control strategy before engaging, shift actuator’s control strategy during gear engaging, and drive motor’s torque recovery strategy after shift process are proposed and implemented with a prototype. To validate the performance of the two-speed gearbox, a test bed was developed based on dSPACE that emulates various operation conditions. The experimental results indicate that the shift process with the proposed shift actuator and control strategy could be accomplished within 1 [*]s under various operation conditions, with shift smoothness up to passenger car standard...|$|E
5000|$|A Toploader {{transmission}} is a manually shifted {{three and four}} speed gearbox introduced in 1963 by the Ford Motor Company to replace the BorgWarner T-10. It was used in most Fords and Mercurys from 1964 until 1973 {{as well as some}} foreign models. Officially designated the 3.03 three speed or Ford design four speed. The 3.03 is the centerline distance between counter shaft and mainshaft. The Toploader got its name {{from the fact that the}} access plate to the inner workings was located on the top of the main case as opposed to the side, a convention used on most gearboxes such as the Ford Dagenham or GM's Saginaw or Muncie. This feature increased the rigidity of the case significantly. Distinguishing the three speed from the four is as simple as counting the fasteners on the top plate. The four speed has ten; the three, nine. Both the three and four speed top loader gearboxes were designed to function in constant mesh, due to <b>synchronizer</b> <b>sleeves</b> being used instead of sliding gears, and be fully synchronized, with the exception of reverse. Forward gears are helical-type while reverse gear including the exterior of the first and second <b>synchronizers</b> <b>sleeve</b> are spur-type gears. This {{transmission is}} also known as the Tremec T-170, HEH, or RUG depending on the year(s) of production. [...] At some point in the early 70's production was moved to Mexico and the name was changed to Tremec.|$|R
40|$|A {{computational}} {{model of the}} gearshifting mechanism may speed up {{the development of a}} new gearboxes. However, such model should be verified against other models as well as validated against experiments to ensure reasonable accuracy. In this contribution, results from the previous developed mathematical model of a generic synchronizer (gearshifting mechanism) against the model developed at Scania is presented. The mathematical model is based on constrained Lagrangian formalism (CLF) and the generic synchronizer is consist of engaging <b>sleeve,</b> <b>synchronizer</b> ring and the gearwheel with dimensions relevant to that of a heavy truck...|$|R
40|$|Robust and {{efficient}} synchronizers are keys elements to ensure good gear shift in heavy vehicles. In {{order to improve}} existing as well as develop new synchronizers, efficient simulation tools are needed. In this contribution, a mechanical system with 5 degrees of freedom modelling a generic synchronizer consisting of engaging <b>sleeve,</b> <b>synchronizer</b> ring and gearwheel are considered. Due {{to the design of}} the different components and their interactions the synchronizing process is described in terms of different steps or phases; presynchronization, main synchronization, blocker transition and engagement. The four main phases are further divided into sub-phases. To study the whole process in a unified manner, Constrained Lagrangian Formalism (CLF) {{turns out to be a}} suitable method in which the interactions between components (<b>sleeve,</b> <b>synchronizer</b> ring and gearwheel) are described by unilateral or/and bilateral constraints imposed on generalized coordinates of the system during different phases. Using CLF a mathematical model of a generic synchronizer is developed and represented by the system of differential-algebraic equations. Kinematics and kinetics of the generic synchronizer are modelled for each sub-phase. The sleeve is considered as a master and the gearwheel is considered as a slave. The statement of the dynamics problem for a generic synchronizer is given and the numerical algorithm is implemented in Matlab for solving the differential-algebraic equations resulting from CLF. The generic synchronizer computational model is adapted to available experimental setup and validated using obtained measurement data. Sensitivity of the synchronization time is studied varying the cone angle, coefficient of dry friction and sleeve force. Effect of driveline vibrations on synchronization performance is also studied...|$|R
40|$|Transmission {{systems for}} {{passenger}} {{cars and trucks}} are equipped with synchronizer mechanism. It has {{a great impact on}} driving comfort and transmission efficiency. A synchronizer mechanism as a key component of a transmission system must be able to prevent gears from shocking and reduce the noise. Gear shifting improvement with respect to smooth, quick and energy efficient synchronizer's performance is still an important issue for automotive industry. This contribution studies the kinematics and dynamics of a generic <b>synchronizer</b> consisting of <b>sleeve,</b> blocker ring and gearwheel constituting a mechanical system with a set of time-varying constraints describing frictional contacts between system's components. The dynamic response is modelled using constrained Lagrangian formalism. Pareto optimization problem is stated and optimized the rate of the applied sleeve force, coefficient of friction and cone angle are found to attain a minimal synchronization time as well as speed difference between sleeve and gearwheel. One outcome of the study is that the obtained Pareto solution is characterized by the minimal admissible value of the cone angle of the synchronizer...|$|R
