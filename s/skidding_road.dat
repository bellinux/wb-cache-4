40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an analysis of the position and density of a secondary road network in the group-selection management system. The research was conducted in the economic unit Prosara in the north west of the Republic of Srpska. The network of <b>skid</b> <b>roads</b> in the analyzed sections was recorded using the GPS devices Garmin GPS 60 and Garmin Map 62 st, and the analysis software package used was ESRI ArcInfo 10. 1. Adhering to the general guidelines, the slope of <b>skid</b> <b>roads</b> was analyzed within six predefined intervals: 0 - 12 %, 12 - 16 %, 16 - 20 %, 20 - 30 %, 30 - 40 % and over 40 %. Relative openness with a secondary road network was determined for a maximum distance between the <b>skid</b> <b>roads</b> of 130 m and it ranged from 82. 62 % to 96. 37 %. Such openness was classified as very good and excellent. Together with all factors related to stand and terrain characteristics, it appears that in all the compartments, the density of the secondary network of <b>skid</b> <b>roads</b> is adequate for the application of a skidder with a winch, without extending above the maximum length of the winch rope. Out of the total length of analyzed <b>skid</b> <b>roads,</b> 24 % is within an appropriate slope interval for a planned conversion to truck roads, whereas 37 % is the maximum slope from the ecological point of view. The average terrain slope for the whole analyzed area is 26. 4 %.

Therefore, good {{harvesting}} plans must be created and then followed by refining to expedite forest sustainability. In reality, forest harvesting operation always cause ecological damage. It can not be avoided, but can be minimized. Log skidding as one element of the harvesting operations need to be controlled to decrease residual stand and soil damages. An investigation on residual stand damage, ground exposure, soil displacement and cost on controlled skidding was carried out at one logging company in Jambi in 2001. The objective of the investigation is to find out information about residual stand damage, ground exposure, soil displacement and cost on controlled skidding which could be useful for managing sustainable forest. The investigation results revealed that: (1) the averages of residual stand damage, ground exposure, top soil displacement, productivity, and cost on controlled skidding were 11. 3 %, 8. 6 %, 17. 720 cm/ 10 m <b>skidding</b> <b>road,</b> 23. 886 m 3 -hm/hour and Rp 12. 740 /m 3 -hm, respectively while those averages on conventional skidding were 20. 2 %, 12. 2 %, 22. 160 cm/ 10 m <b>skidding</b> <b>road,</b> 30. 996 m 3 -hm/hour and Rp 10, 080 /m 3 -hm, respectively; (2) controlled skidding can decrease 8. 9 % of residual stand damage: 3, 6 % of the degree of ground exposure; 4. 44 cm/ 10 m road skidding of level of top soil displacement; (3) controlled skidding system increase the cost of Rp 2, 660 /m 3 -hm because the productivity of the system is lower than the conventional one.

Average consumption of fuel and lubricant is 17. 43 mL x tree– 1, on the plots 20. 27 mL x tree– 1, average consumption of lubricant per tree on <b>skid</b> <b>roads</b> is 9. 4 mL x tree– 1, on the plots 11 mL x tree– 1. The higher consumption of fuel and lubricant on the plots with selective thinning is the consequence of the longer time needed for the conversion per tree, compared to that in clear felling The consumption of fuel per unit area on the <b>skid</b> <b>roads</b> (clear felling) is 22. 9 L x ha– 1, on the plots (selective thinning) 7. 6 L x ha– 1.

Šumarski list br. 3 – 4, CXXXIV (2010), 103 - 114 Harvesting phases of felling and processing were time-separated from skidding. Research was conducted using time and work study method. Time consumption of each work component was measured by snap-back chronometry method. Lenght of <b>skid</b> <b>roads</b> was gradually measured on uniform slope segments by GPS. Coordinates of points, where the longitudal slope changes, were recorded by GPS as well. Slope of each individual segment was calculated using the difference in altitude of slope change points and the related lenght. While skidding, the tractor was travelling exclusively by two <b>skid</b> <b>roads</b> (figure 4 and table 1). Average skid slope is expressed in percents, in the direction of loaded tractor travel. Average slope of recorded turns was calculated by weighting the related slope with the travel lenght. Average skidding distance was calculated as an average of recorded loaded trevel lenghts of each turn. Load records are shown in table 2. Significant difference in average load on skid trail 1 (5. 043 m 3) and on skid trail 2 (3. 715 m 3) is evident. By each turn difference in productivity of <b>skidding</b> on <b>skid</b> <b>road</b> 1 and <b>skid</b> <b>road</b> 2 increases by 1. 328 m 3. During the research 75. 650 m 3 of beech wood asortments, and 115. 994 m 3 of fir wood asortments were <b>skidded</b> on <b>skid</b> <b>road</b> 1. On <b>skid</b> <b>road</b> 2 18. 607 m 3 of beech wood asortments an 44. 549 m 3 of fir wood asortments were skidded. By multiplying achieved volumes with density of fresh beech wood (1, 07 t/m 3) and fresh fir wood (0, 98 t/m 3) average load masses on <b>skid</b> <b>road</b> 1 (5. 122 t) and on <b>skid</b> <b>road</b> 2 (3. 739 t) were calculated. Variable times (travel loaded and unloaded by <b>skid</b> <b>roads</b> and landing, line pulling and winching) were analysed by mathematical and statistical methods (figure 6, figure 7 and figure 8). All other effective times were regarded as fixed and calculated as averages of recorded time (figure 11). During the research average daily output of 36. 40 m 3 /day was achieved with average total time consuption of 404, 59 min/day. The said total time consumption makes 84. 59 % of legal working time (480 min). With full utilisatin of legal working time, at the same organization of work, the productivity would increase by 15. 41 %. During the research the tractor accomplished 76. 46 % of total time as efective time with delay time of 23. 54 %. In effective time per turn, for skidding distance of 500 m, fixed times take 17. 36 min and variable times take 18. 97 min. Effective time per turn, for skidding distance of 500 m, is 36. 34 min. With determined allowance time factor of 1, 22 total time is 44. 42 min. Average travel speed on <b>skid</b> <b>roads</b> is 3. 56 km/h for unloaded tractor and 3. 50 km/h for loaded tractor. Average travel speed on landing is 4. 65 km/h for unloaded tractor and 4. 93 km/h for loaded tractor, on average distance of 65 m. Average speed of line pulling is 0. 97 km/h and average speed of winching is 0. 86 km/h. Standard time of <b>skidding</b> on <b>skid</b> <b>road</b> 1 ranges from 5. 32 min/m 3 (100 m) to 13. 17 min/m 3 (1000 m) with average load of 5. 04 m 3. For skkiding on <b>skid</b> <b>road</b> 2 standard time ranges from 7. 22 min/m 3 (100 m) to 17. 88 min/m 3 (1000 m) with average load of 3. 72 m 3. Daily output ranges from 90. 27 m 3 /day for skkidnig distance of 100 m to 36. 45 m 3 /day for skidding distance of 1000 m, when skkiding on <b>skid</b> <b>road</b> 1, and from 66. 50 m 3 /day to 26. 85 m 3 /day when <b>skidding</b> on <b>skid</b> <b>road</b> 2 for the same distances. For skidding distances from 100 m to 1000 m skidding cost ranges from 31. 83 kn/m 3 to 78. 83 kn/m 3, for <b>skid</b> <b>road</b> 1 and from 43. 20 kn/m 3 to 107. 01 kn/m 3 for <b>skid</b> <b>road</b> 2. Timberjack 240 C tractor belongs to a group of highly-efficient special forest timber skidding machines. The principle of load size effect, as one of the key factors of timber skidding, on skidding productivity in different skidding distances has been proven by this detailed research. Hence, by increasing the load volume the productivity of this tractor is significantly increased, thus lowering the cost per unit, in this case by 26. 34 %. Considerably lower timber skidding cost when skidding down the slope should be {{regarded as one of the}} capital elements in planning and construction of secondary forest network...|$|R
