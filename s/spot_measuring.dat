Setting: Gait laboratory, Fukui University Hospital, Japan. Subjects: Fourteen normal volunteers. Outcome measures: A computerized gait analysis system with two forceplates and a light source <b>spot</b> <b>measuring</b> device was used. Gait measurement in each subject was performed on three different days. Results: The gait parameters measured on three different days were significantly different, particularly step length, stride length, velocity, the components of floor-reaction forces and hip motion. In these parameters, intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC (1, 1) was not high (range 0. 05 - 0. 71). However, there was a high correlation between these parameters and velocity and high repeatability was obtained following compensation for velocity (ICC (1, 1), range 0. 73 - 0. 97). In contrast, compensation of parameters whose measurement was not significantly different before compensation did not improve ICC (1, 1). Variability of all parameters was acceptable, however CV (an index of variability) improved significantly after compensation compared with that before compensation in six of 15 parameters. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that low repeatability in gait parameters should be considered even when the gait of normal subjects is measured on different days. A high repeatability and more acceptable variability were obtained when the data were compensated for velocity...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Obtaining {{reliable}} and reproducible two-color microarray gene expression data {{is critically important}} for understanding the biological significance of perturbations made on a cellular system. Microarray design, RNA preparation and labeling, hybridization conditions and data acquisition and analysis are variables difficult to simultaneously control. A useful tool for monitoring and controlling intra- and inter-experimental variation is Universal Reference RNA (URR), developed {{with the goal of}} providing hybridization signal at each microarray probe location (<b>spot).</b> <b>Measuring</b> signal at each spot as the ratio of experimental RNA to reference RNA targets, rather than relying on absolute signal intensity, decreases variability by normalizing signal output in any two-color hybridization experiment. Results Human, mouse and rat URR (UHRR, UMRR and URRR, respectively) were prepared from pools of RNA derived from individual cell lines representing different tissues. A variety of microarrays were used to determine percentage of spots hybridizing with URR and producing signal above a user defined threshold (microarray coverage). Microarray coverage was consistently greater than 80 % for all arrays tested. We confirmed that individual cell lines contribute their own unique set of genes to URR, arguing for a pool of RNA from several cell lines as a better configuration for URR as opposed to a single cell line source for URR. Microarray coverage comparing two separately prepared batches each of UHRR, UMRR and URRR were highly correlated (Pearson's correlation coefficients of 0. 97). Conclusion Results of this study demonstrate that large quantities of pooled RNA from individual cell lines are reproducibly prepared and possess diverse gene representation. This type of reference provides a standard for reducing variation in microarray experiments and allows more reliable comparison of gene expression data within and between experiments and laboratories. </p...|$|E

Ez a problémafelvetés vezetett a korábbi szakirodalomban már többször említett, az elterjedési térképeken ábrázolt Hajdúböszörmény közigazgatási területéhez tartozó Pródi-halom lelőhely behatóbb vizsgálatához. A halom légvonalban körülbelül 20 km-re délkeletre helyezkedik el Polgár-Csőszhalomtól, egy korábbi ártéri sziget keleti végében. A közel 4 m magas domb környezetének felszínét sűrűn borítják egy feltehetően Árpád-kori templom szétszántott, a mezőgazdasági művelés által folyamatosan pusztított maradványai. A topográfiai megfigyelések eredményeinek ellenőrzésére 2007 -ben a Pródi-halmon kis léptékű kutató ásatást végeztünk. A késő neolitikus leletek mellett bronzkori, római császárkori szarmata és Árpád-kori emlékek kerültek napvilágra. A körvonalazott régészeti előzmények után végzett magnetométer felmérés eredményeként a Pródi-halom körül többszörös körárok-rendszer képe bontakozott ki. A 2008 -as felmérés és a halom környékén végzett többszöri helyszíni szemle alapján rekonstruálhatóvá vált a kiemelkedéstől nyugati irányban, mintegy 550 – 600 m hosszan húzódó egykori újkőkori település. Ennek foltja lényegében követi a kelet–nyugati dombhát 92, 5 m-es szintvonala által körülhatárolt területet, így közel 7 – 8 ha kiterjedésűre becsülhető. Ezen belül az egykori rondella területe nagyjából 3 – 3, 5 ha területet foglalhatott el. 			 | 				Research history Following the 1989 – 2007 {{excavations}} at Polgár-Csőszhalom {{it became}} {{increasingly clear that}} this late neolithic site in the Upper Tisza Region consisted of a horizontal settlement and an adjacent tell that {{was surrounded by a}} system of circular ditches and palisades. The sheer extent of the horizontal settlement, as well as its relation to the habitation mound may be considered unique within the prehistoric cultural context of the Great Hungarian Plain. Studying the broader environment of this site looked especially promising in reconstructing the micro-regional function and economic relations of this settlement during the Late Neolithic. This approach to the problem inspired focused research at the site of Pródi-halom in the outskirts of Hajdúböszörmény often mentioned in the literature and identified in site distribution maps. This settlement mound is located some 20 km southeast of Polgár-Csőszhalom as the crow flies. It occupies the eastern end of what was an island within the Tisza floodplain (Fig. 1). It was János Makkay who first directed attention to Pródi-halom in 1957, due to its possible contacts with settlement blocks of the Herpály culture that may have had connections with settlements in the Berettyó-region during the Late Neolithic. Within the framework of a brief review of research history, he also directed attention to the forgotten fact that the renowned archaeologists Flóris Rómer and József Hampel had already carried out excavations at this spot in 1882. In the 1987 register of late neolithic settlements in the Upper Tisza Region, this site was classified as belonging to the Herpály culture {{on the basis of the}} aforementioned publication by J. Makkay although it is located some 45 – 50 km north of the settlement block of the Herpály culture itself. Moreover it has been hypothesized that this site may be classified within the category of tell-like settlements. In spite of these efforts, detailed studies of this mound began only more than a century after the 1882 excavations. This may in part be explained by some disturbing topographic phenomena. Among others, the surface around the almost 4 m tall mound was littered by rubble originating from a church tentatively dated to the 11 th century, continuously destroyed by tillage. Quantities of human bone brought to light during plowing bear witness to the burials in the churchyard. Hair-rings dated to the Period of the Árpád Dynasty (11 – 13 th century) recovered on the eastern slope of the mound may also be related to this medieval complex. These phenomena already indicate that under such circumstances excavations aimed at verifying prehistoric strata may run into difficulties. Recent archaeological research at the site Excavations 1. Upper strata (Period of the Roman Empire and Middle Ages) Being aware of the history of this mound, including numerous disturbances by previous excavations the 12 × 2 m test trench oriented east-west was not opened on the top but near the northwestern foot of the mound (Fig. 2. 1 – 2). Three graves came to light in the eastern end, while Grave 1 found in the southeastern corner reached beyond the test trench and had to be followed by the excavations. An incomplete skeleton oriented northwest was recovered at a depth of 84 cm (Fig. 3). An S-shaped hair-ring was found on the chest of the deceased (Fig. 4). Remains of a wooden coffin could be observed near the legs covering a surface of approximately 45 cm in length. Coffin nails and the fragment of a coffin clasp were recovered in the proximity of these finds. It may be hypothesized, however, that the remains of the coffin did not belong to this skeleton but to a later burial that disturbed the lower grave. Grave 2 was located some 2 m east of this spot at a depth of 92 cm. It contained no grave goods (Fig. 3. 2). Grave 3 was found by yet another 2 m toward the east. It reached partially into the southern wall of the test trench. The deceased was oriented west lying on her left side in a contracted position (Fig. 3. 3). The first two of these three burials (Graves 1 – 2) could be dated with great certainty. The S-shaped hair-ring found in Grave 1 is typical of the Period of the Árpád Dynasty, more exactly its phase that predated the mid 13 th-century Mongol-Tartar invasion. The rite identified in the case of Grave 2 points toward the same period. It may be reasonable to hypothesize therefore that we encountered graves from the churchyard dated to the Period of the Árpád Dynasty. The rite observed in the third grave, however, differs from those of the two previously discussed burials. On the basis of analogous-looking burials observed at Csőszhalom it may be identified as the probable burial of a late neolithic woman. In addition, Sarmatian shards representing the Period of the Roman Empire were also found in the upper strata of the mound. An oval feature with diameters measuring 160 × 150 cm and of a depth of 195 cm must have served as a Sarmatian refuse pit. 2. Late neolithic trench While the test trench was opened randomly, without particular planning, it revealed a surprise of great archaeological importance. A “V”-shaped ditch of approximately 10 m width could be recognized at a depth of 170 – 180 cm below the original surface (Fig. 2. 2). The ditch itself could be followed down to a depth of 250 cm in a 1 m wide band at the northern section of the test trench. On that level, however, ground water made excavations difficult, therefore the position of the ditch was clarified by a series of stratigraphic bore samples. A combination between the image obtained by a subsequent magnetic survey carried out in 2008 and the excavation profile superposed on it shows that the test trench intersected with the northwestern segment of a major circular ditch system. The find material brought to the surface from the test trench at Pródi-halom was quite homogeneous. It consisted of a relatively great quantity of pot shards and animal bones. This fragmentary artifactual assemblage may be associated with a single major event detectable at the bottom of the prehistoric ditch. It originates from a fill rich in organic material. It seems therefore that the ditch ceased to exist within the framework of some conscious activity as had also been observed in the case of the ditch system recovered at Polgár-Csőszhalom. Even the types of ceramics and their decorations correspond to the late neolithic stylistic realm identified at the tell sites of Csőszhalom and Berettyóújfalu-Herpály (Figs 5 – 6). On the other hand, a variety of painted ware is missing from the ceramic material of the test trench opened at Pród. To some extent, this paucity may be attributed to poor preservation both in terms of high fragmentation and destructive soil conditions. Flaked and ground stone assemblages The artifactual assemblage brought to light from the prehistoric ditch at the site of Pródi-halom contained nine flaked and two ground stone artifacts (Fig. 7). Among the flaked tools only two types of raw material were represented: four were made from obsidian, while five were fashioned from Volhynian flint. Given the geographical location of the site, the use of local lithic sources would be out of the question. The nearest sources of such raw material are located in the southern reaches of the Tokaj foothill zone at a distance of some 50 – 60 km from the site under discussion here (Fig. 8). Magnetometric survey Following the aforementioned antecedents, a magnetometric survey carried out in 2008 revealed the image of a multiple circular ditch system (Figs 9 – 10). It is suggested here that the concentric ditches are formed by two major structural units. 1. The double external ditch formed an enclosure of some 170 – 180 m in diameter with estimated widths of 2 – 3 m. In spite of some disturbance, traces of several renovations and corrections may be observed in the southern section of this double ditch. For example at one point the double ditch is trebled. On the other hand no opening could be identified in this system that could have been interpreted as a “gate”. 2. The inner part of the enclosure was 90 – 100 m in diameter, surrounded by a 6 – 8 m ditch, and another inner ditch that measured only 1 – 2 m in width. The larger outer ditch of this system was interrupted by four “gates” that correspond to the main directions of the compass. Three of these were clearly recognizable in the magnetometric images. The width of these “entrances” may be estimated as 6 – 8 m. The narrower, inner ditch may be – with great likelihood – interpreted as the foundation ditch of a palisade system. These two phenomena seem to have formed part of a “rotunda”-like construction that consisted of a ditch and an inner fortification. 3. Four smaller and a large homogeneous spots were discovered at the eastern edge of the innermost area within this enclosure. The interpretation of these features has posed problems (Fig. 11). The very regular southernmost <b>spot</b> <b>measuring</b> 9 × 7 m may be considered the trace of a previously dug test square possibly opened by F. Rómer and J. Hampel in 1882. A number “ 3 ” shaped anomaly in the magnetic map may correspond to the foundations of a church or some other building. When mirrored around a northeast-southwest axis of symmetry, this shape forms the outline of a building measuring approximately 28 × 18 m. It is evident that this problem can be clarified only by additional excavations. It seems likely that the walls of this tentatively identified building were quarried that resulted in a new fill that cannot be sensed at a 1 × 1 m resolution grid system. Sonar measurements carried out on the eastern edge of the mound covered a square of 30 × 8 m. This method, however, yielded no results. The remaining two north-south and east-west spots may possibly result from grave robbing. Summary of research carried out at the site 1. It is evident that the best formal parallel to the circular ditch/palisade system detected at Pródi-halom is known from Polgár-Csőszhalom. Detailed observations and verifying excavations at that site complex delineated an inner tell and an external horizontal settlement whose social functions must have differed. This observation has been supported by archaeological observations. It is surprising that the external ditches at both Csőszhalom and Pródi-halom form enclosures of nearly identical diameters, 180 – 190 m and 170 – 180 m respectively. Meanwhile, the enclosure surrounded by the inner ditch differed, measuring 70 – 75 m and 90 – 100 m. This means that the inner area of possible social function was significantly larger at Pródi-halom. In summary, however, it may be said that the concentric ditch and palisade system observed at Pródi-halom and Csőszhalom show close relations to “earthworks” (Rondel, Circular ditched enclosure, and Einhegung, Kreisgrabenanlage etc.) known from Transdanubia (Western Hungary) and similar features dated to the Lengyel culture in Central Europe. 2. As already mentioned, repeated field surveys in the environs of Pródi-halom revealed a 550 – 600 m long section of a late neolithic horizontal settlement located west of the mound. Remains of this settlement actually follow an elevated bank whose height may be defined by following the 92. 5 m contour line and whose area may be estimated as 7 – 8 hectares (Fig. 12). The rondella once must have covered approximately 3 – 3. 5 hectares within this territory. The double settlement structure identified at Pród (consisting of an external, horizontal component and a mound) thus corresponds to the complex late neolithic settlement identified at Polgár-Csőszhalom. The only difference is that while the rondella stands at the western end of the settlement in the case of Polgár-Csőszhalom, in the case of Pród it is located in the eastern section. It is also likely that a major tell-like artificial mound had once stood in the center of the Pródi-halom enclosure, but it may since have been destroyed. This means that the settlement of Polgár-Csőszhalom is no more without parallels. In fact, it may be predicted that the traces of additional such earthen structures will be discovered at Csőszhalom type settlements in the Upper Tisza Region. Meanwhile, similarly to Lengyel culture rondellas, the circular ditch and palisade systems discovered at Csőszhalom and Pródi-halom also carried symbolic and sacral meanings. This may mean that there is an underlying similarity in the cognitive characteristics of these two cultural units. The cultural affiliation of Pródi-halom between the sites of Berettyóújfalu-Herpály and Polgár-Csőszhalom would be impossible to identify on the basis of the ceramic assemblage alone. The circular ditch and palisade system may be considered more diagnostic from this point of view, indicating a definite connection to Csőszhalom. 3. The lithic raw materials encountered as well as the technological observations place this assemblage clearly within the archaeological context of the Late Neolithic. The important roles played by type 1 Carpathian obsidian and Volhynian flint, as well as their local manufacturing are well-known phenomena at settlements in the region. The occurrence of these raw materials at the settlement of Pródi-halom may be best explained by connections with the Carpathian foothill region where type 1 Carpathian obsidian may be found and roads lead towards the Dniester river valley across the passes of the North-eastern Carpathians. 4. Even this short field project has reconfirmed documentary sources that mention the church of Pród village that had dated back to the early Period of the Árpád Dynasty. Although the remains of the church itself remain unknown, the two contemporaneous graves found at the site make its existence very likely. The mound itself was inhabited during the Bronze Age and the Sarmatian Period as well. Meanwhile no trace of a village datable to the Period of the Árpád Dynasty and late Middle Ages was found. These will have to be localized during subsequent extensive field surveys and excavations of large scale. The name of the village Pród (provod) occurs first in the written sources in 1067 and existed till the end of the 16 th century. ...|$|E

We then use this formula to price caps and swaptions by choosing the parameters of the scalar di#usion to approximate the arbitrage-free dynamics of the underlying forward or swap rate. We apply this method to two classes of models: one in which the jumps in all forward rates are Poisson under the <b>spot</b> <b>measure,</b> and one in which the jumps in each forward rate are Poisson under its associated forward measure. Numerical examples demonstrate the accuracy of the approximations. # 403 Uris Hall, Graduate School of Business, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, pg 20 @columbia. edu. + Department of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, nm 187 @columbia. edu 1 Intro ductio This paper dev elops formulas for pricing caps and swaptions in jump-di#usion LIBOR market models.

40|$|There {{are some}} {{significant}} differences between the way seismologists and geologists typically look at faulting from large earthquakes. Seismologists tend to analyze waveform data which can usually resolve structures on the order of tens of kilometers; possibly down to one kilometers there is very good near-field data. Also, the derived physically properties are averaged over this scale length. Although it is difficult to resolve small scale features, seismologic studies have the advantage of seeing all depths of the fault. In contrast fault zone geologists can make direct observations of the fault zone structures and properties, which are quite different from the remote sensing techniques of seismolo-gists. Geologists tend to look at structures on the scale of microns to meters when examining the cores obtained from drilling into faults. These observations are <b>spot</b> <b>measure...</b>|$|R

40|$|A crystal of hen {{egg white}} {{lysozyme}} was analyzed {{by means of}} energy dispersive X ray Laue diffraction with white synchrotron radiation at 2. 7 A resolution using a pnCCD detector. From Laue <b>spots</b> <b>measured</b> in a single exposure of the arbitrarily oriented crystal, the lattice constants of the tetragonal unit cell could be extracted with an accuracy of about 2. 5. Scanning across the sample surface, Laue images with split reflections were recorded at various positions. The corresponding diffraction patterns were generated by two crystalline domains with a tilt of about 1 relative to each other. The obtained results demonstrate {{the potential of the}} pnCCD for fast X ray screening of crystals of macromolecules or proteins prior to conventional X ray structure analysis. The described experiment can be automatized to quantitatively characterize imperfect single crystals or polycrystal...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{propose a}} {{cognitive}} vision-based {{system for the}} intelligent monitoring of tokamaks during plasma operation, based on multi-sensor data analysis and symbolic reasoning. The practical purpose is to detect and characterize in real time abnormal events such as hot <b>spots</b> <b>measured</b> through infrared images of the in-vessel components {{in order to take}} adequate decisions. Our system is made intelligent by the use of a priori knowledge of both contextual and perceptual information for ontology-driven event modeling and task-oriented event recognition. The system is made original by combining both physics-based and perceptual information during the recognition process. Real time reasoning is achieved thanks to task-level software optimizations. The framework is generic and can be easily adapted to different fusion device environments. This paper presents the developed system and its achievements on real data of the Tore Supra tokamak imaging system...|$|R

40|$|Spot {{measurements}} of methane emission rate (n = 18 700) by 24 Angus steers fed mixed rations from GrowSafe feeders were made over 3 - to 6 -min periods by a GreenFeed emission monitoring (GEM) unit. The data were analysed to estimate daily methane production (DMP; g/day) and derived methane yield (MY; g/kg dry matter intake (DMI)). A one-compartment dose model of spot emission rate v. {{time since the}} preceding meal was compared with the models of Wood (1967) and Dijkstra et al. (1997) and the average of <b>spot</b> <b>measures.</b> Fitted values for DMP were calculated from the area under the curves. Two methods of relating methane and feed intakes were then studied: the classical calculation of MY as DMP/DMI (kg/day); and a novel method of estimating DMP from time and size of preceding meals using either the data for only the two meals preceding a spot measurement, or all meals for 3 days prior. Two approaches were also used to estimate DMP from spot measurements: fitting of splines on a 'per-animal per-day' basis and an alternate approach of modelling DMP after each feed event by least squares (using Solver), summing (for each animal) the contributions from each feed event by best-fitting a one-compartment model. Time since the preceding meal was of limited value in estimating DMP. Even when the meal sizes and time intervals between a spot measurement and all feeding events in the previous 72 h were assessed, only 16. 9 % {{of the variance in}} <b>spot</b> emission rate <b>measured</b> by GEM was explained by this feeding information. While using the preceding meal alone gave a biased (underestimate) of DMP, allowing for a longer feed history removed this bias. A power analysis taking into account the sources of variation in DMP indicated that to obtain an estimate of DMP with a 95 % confidence interval within 5 % of the observed 64 days mean of <b>spot</b> <b>measures</b> would require 40 animals measured over 45 days (two spot measurements per day) or 30 animals measured over 55 days. These numbers suggest that spot measurements could be made in association with feed efficiency tests made over 70 days. Spot {{measurements of}} enteric emissions can be used to define DMP but the number of animals and samples are larger than are needed when day-long measures are made...|$|R

40|$|A {{method is}} {{developed}} {{for evaluating the}} displacement field around {{the tip of a}} crack in a plate under plane stress or strain conditions by executing a number of measurements in this area through the scanning electron microscope. Several spots were created around the crack tip by using the electron beam of the SEM, which were used as reference points. A theory was developed which yields the components of the in-plane displacements and their differences from the coordinates of the reference <b>spots</b> <b>measured</b> through SEM. The method presents the advantage that its results are independent of the exact position of the crack tip and therefore it is suitable for performing measurements very close to this tip. Experimental evidence with plexiglas plates showed the validity of the method for defining the displacement field as well as the values of crack opening displacements and the stress intensity factor. © 1988 Chapman and Hall Ltd...|$|R
40|$|The Voyager 1 {{infrared}} spectrometer (IRIS) data and two recently compiled data sets (Voyager imaging mosaics and measurements of Io's thermal emission from the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility) are correlated. These data {{were used to}} refine the correlation between dark spot optical properties (albedo and color) and thermal emission, to examine this correspondence on a satellite-wide scale, and to identify additional hot spots {{not included in the}} IRIS inventory. The results suggest the hot spots are liquid sulfur lava lakes, for the following reasons: (1) the melting point of sulfur is 390 K, and the model hot spot temperatures range from approximately 200 to 450 K; (2) the albedos and color of the dark <b>spots,</b> <b>measured</b> from the global mosaics, are consistent with laboratory measurements for liquid sulfur; (3) high resolution images of the dark features show morphologies suggestive of lava lakes; and (4) this hypothesis provides a simple and direct explanation for why dark spots are hot on Io...|$|R
