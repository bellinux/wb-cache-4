40|$|Acute {{idiopathic}} peripheral {{facial paralysis}} (Bell's palsy) {{is the most common}} disorder of the facial nerve. Most patients recover completely, although some have permanent disfiguring facial weakness. Many studies have attempted to identify an infectious etiology for this disease. Although the cause of Bell's palsy remains unknown, recent studies suggest a possible association with Herpes Simplex Virus- 1 (HSV- 1) infection. In this case-control study we investigated the presence of DNA of HSV in the saliva of 26 patients with Bells palsy in first and <b>second</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> disorder compared to normal population who were matched in sex, age, as well as history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension and labial herpes. In the case group 3 and 7 patients had positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HSV in first and <b>second</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> disease respectively compared to 4 in controls. It means that there was not any relationship between Bell's palsy and HSV in saliva either in first or in <b>second</b> <b>week.</b> Two and 6 of positive results from the sample <b>of</b> first and <b>second</b> <b>weeks</b> were from patients with severe (grade 4 - 6) Bell's palsy.
