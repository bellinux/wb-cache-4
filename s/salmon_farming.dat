25|$|Salmon are carnivorous. They are fed a meal {{produced}} from catching other wild {{fish and other}} marine organisms. <b>Salmon</b> <b>farming</b> leads to a high demand for wild forage fish. Salmon require large nutritional intakes of protein, and farmed salmon consume more fish than they generate as a final product. To produce one pound of farmed salmon, products from several pounds of wild fish are fed to them. As the <b>salmon</b> <b>farming</b> industry expands, it requires more wild forage fish for feed, {{at a time when}} 75% of the world's monitored fisheries are already near to or have exceeded their maximum sustainable yield. The industrial-scale extraction of wild forage fish for <b>salmon</b> <b>farming</b> affects the survivability of the wild predator fish which rely on them for food.|$|E

40|$|Background Pathogens {{are growing}} threats to wildlife. The {{rapid growth of}} marine <b>salmon</b> <b>farms</b> {{over the past two}} decades has {{increased}} host abundance for pathogenic sea lice in coastal waters, and wild juvenile <b>salmon</b> swimming past <b>farms</b> are frequently infected with lice. Here we report the first investigation of the potential role of <b>salmon</b> <b>farms</b> in transmitting sea lice to juvenile sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). Methodology/Principal Findings We used genetic analyses to determine the origin of sockeye from Canada 2 ̆ 7 s two most important salmon rivers, the Fraser and Skeena; Fraser sockeye migrate through a region with <b>salmon</b> <b>farms,</b> and Skeena sockeye do not. We compared lice levels between Fraser and Skeena juvenile sockeye, and within the <b>salmon</b> <b>farm</b> region we compared lice levels on wild fish either before or after migration past farms. We matched the latter data on wild juveniles with sea lice data concurrently gathered on farms. Fraser River sockeye migrating through a region with <b>salmon</b> <b>farms</b> hosted an order of magnitude more sea lice than Skeena River populations, where there are no farms. Lice abundances on juvenile sockeye in the <b>salmon</b> <b>farm</b> region were substantially higher downstream of farms than upstream of farms for the two common species of lice: Caligus clemensi and Lepeophtheirus salmonis, and changes in their proportions between two years matched changes on the fish farms. Mixed-effects models show that position relative to <b>salmon</b> <b>farms</b> best explained C. clemensi abundance on sockeye, while migration year combined with position relative to <b>salmon</b> <b>farms</b> and temperature was one of two top models to explain L. salmonis abundance. Conclusions/Significance This is the first study to demonstrate a potential role of <b>salmon</b> <b>farms</b> in sea lice transmission to juvenile sockeye salmon during their critical early marine migration. Moreover, it demonstrates a major migration corridor past farms for sockeye that originated in the Fraser River, a complex of populations that are the subject of conservation concern...|$|R

25|$|Economic {{troubles}} {{caused by}} a collapse of the Faroese fishing industry in the early 1990s brought high unemployment rates of 10 to 15% by the mid-1990s. Unemployment decreased in the later 1990s, down to about 6% {{at the end of}} 1998. By June 2008 unemployment had declined to 1.1%, before rising to 3.4% in early 2009. In December 2014 the unemployment was 3.2%. Nevertheless, the almost total dependence on fishing and fish farming means that the economy remains vulnerable. One of the biggest private companies of the Faroe Islands is the <b>salmon</b> <b>farming</b> company Bakkafrost, which is the largest of the four <b>salmon</b> <b>farming</b> companies in the Faroe Islands and the eighth biggest in the world.|$|E

25|$|Sea cages {{can attract}} {{a variety of}} wild predators which can {{sometimes}} become entangled in associated netting leading to injury or death.

25|$|Global wild {{fisheries}} {{are believed}} to have peaked and begun a decline, with valuable habitat such as estuaries in critical condition. The aquaculture or farming of piscivorous fish, like salmon, does not help solve the problem because they need to be fed products from other fish. Studies have shown that <b>salmon</b> <b>farming</b> has major negative impacts on wild salmon, as well as the forage fish that need to be caught to feed them.|$|E
25|$|Salmon {{aquaculture}} is a {{major contributor}} to the world production of farmed finfish, representing about US$10billion annually. Other commonly cultured fish species include: tilapia, catfish, sea bass, carp and bream. <b>Salmon</b> <b>farming</b> is significant in Chile, Norway, Scotland, Canada and the Faroe Islands; it is the source for most salmon consumed in the United States and Europe. Atlantic salmon are also, in very small volumes, farmed in Russia and the island of Tasmania, Australia.|$|E

25|$|Another form {{of salmon}} production, which is safer but less controllable, {{is to raise}} salmon in {{hatcheries}} until they {{are old enough to}} become independent. They are released into rivers in an attempt to increase the salmon population. This system is referred to as ranching. It was very common in countries such as Sweden, before the Norwegians developed <b>salmon</b> <b>farming,</b> but is seldom done by private companies. As anyone may catch the salmon when they return to spawn, a company is limited in benefiting financially from their investment.|$|E
25|$|Farming in {{freshwater}} for {{king salmon}} uses net cages placed in rivers, using techniques {{similar to those}} used for sea-farmed salmon. Freshwater raceways are located in several Canterbury rivers such as the Clutha and Waimakariri Rivers. In the 1990s, a unique form of freshwater <b>salmon</b> <b>farming</b> was developed in hydroelectric canals in the Mackenzie Basin. Young salmon are enclosed in pens in the Ohau and Tekapo canals. The Tekapo site, fed by fast cold waters from the Southern Alps, is the highest salmon farm in the world, 677 metres above sea level.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, {{infectious}} salmon anemia (ISAv) {{was discovered}} in Norway in an Atlantic salmon hatchery. Eighty percent of {{the fish in the}} outbreak died. ISAv, a viral disease, is now a major threat to the viability of Atlantic <b>salmon</b> <b>farming.</b> It is now the first of the diseases classified on List One of the European Commission’s fish health regime. Amongst other measures, this requires the total eradication of the entire fish stock should an outbreak of the disease be confirmed on any farm. ISAv seriously affects salmon farms in Chile, Norway, Scotland and Canada, causing major economic losses to infected farms. As the name implies, it causes severe anemia of infected fish. Unlike mammals, the red blood cells of fish have DNA, and can become infected with viruses. The fish develop pale gills, and may swim close to the water surface, gulping for air. However, the disease can also develop without the fish showing any external signs of illness, the fish maintain a normal appetite, and then they suddenly die. The disease can progress slowly throughout an infected farm and, in the worst cases, death rates may approach 100 percent. It is also a threat to the dwindling stocks of wild salmon. Management strategies include developing a vaccine and improving genetic resistance to the disease.|$|E

40|$|Coastal {{aquaculture}} is a globally expanding enterprise. Currently, 1200 <b>salmon</b> <b>farms</b> {{operate in}} coastal Norway, yet {{their capacity to}} aggregate and subsequently modify wild fish distributions is poorly known. Aggregations of wild fish at 9 farms and 9 control locations were counted on 3 separate days in June to August 2007. On each sampling occasion, 6 counts were made at 5 distinct depth-strata at each farm and control location. Wild fish were 1 to 3 orders of magnitude more abundant at farms than at control sites, depending on the location. Gadoid fish (Pollachius virens, Gadus morhua and Melanogrammus aeglefinus) dominated farm-associated assemblages and were present across {{a wide range of}} sizes, from juveniles to large adults. Estimated total farm-aggregated wild fish biomass averaged 10. 2 metric tonnes (t) per farm across the 9 farms (range: 600 kg to 41. 6 t). Applied across the geographical range of Norway’s 1200 <b>salmon</b> <b>farms,</b> our estimates indicate that <b>salmon</b> <b>farms</b> attract and aggregate over 12000 t of wild fish into a total of just 750 ha of coastal waters on any given day in summer. Possible consequences of these persistent, substantial aggregations of wild fishes at farms include a heightened potential for the transfer of pathogens from <b>salmon</b> <b>farms</b> to wild fish and among adjacent <b>salmon</b> <b>farms,</b> and altered availability of wild fish to fisheries. Restrictions on fishing in the immediate surrounds of <b>salmon</b> <b>farms</b> may avoid farms acting as ecological traps, particularly for species with depressed populations such as G. morhua, which are highly attracted to farms...|$|R
