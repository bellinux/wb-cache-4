They are abundant in the Arctic, about 140 species being known from that zone. The Antarctic scallop, Adamussium colbecki, lives under the sea ice {{at the other end}} of the globe, where the subzero temperatures mean that growth rates are very slow. The giant mussel, Bathymodiolus thermophilus, and the giant white clam, Calyptogena magnifica, both live clustered around hydrothermal vents at abyssal depths in the Pacific Ocean. They have chemosymbiotic bacteria in their gills that oxidise hydrogen sulphide, and the molluscs absorb nutrients synthesized by these bacteria. The saddle oyster, Enigmonia aenigmatica, is a marine species that could be considered amphibious.

In these habitats, the distribution and growth of this alga appear {{to be related to}} hard water rich in calcium ions. To characterize the eco-physiological properties of this calciphilic red alga, we examined the effects of long-term and short-term Ca 2 + depletion on photosynthetic growth of the thallus and on the phycobilisome. Long-term culture experiments suggested that higher Ca 2 + concentrations (> 50 mgL− 1) were required to sustain thallus growth and pigmentation of cells. In short-term Ca 2 +-depletion treatments, fluorescence derived from phycoerythrin (PE) fluctuated, although the absorption spectra of the thalli did not change. After 30 min of Ca 2 + depletion, the fluorescence lifetime of PE became markedly longer, indicating that the energy transfer from PE to phycocyanin (PC) was suppressed. The fluorescence lifetime of PE returned to its original value within a short time after 4 h of Ca 2 + depletion, however, energy transfer from PE to PC was still suppressed. This suggested that the excitation energy absorbed by PE was quenched during prolonged Ca 2 + depletion. The efficient energy transfer from PC and allophycocyanin were unchanged during these treatments...|$|R
40|$|A {{model of}} an {{atmospheric}} bubbling fluidized bed combustor operated with high-volatile solid fuel feedings is presented. It aims at {{the assessment of}} axial burning profiles along the reactor and of the associated temperature profiles, relevant to combustor performance and operability, The combustor {{is divided into three}} sections: the dense bed, the splashing region and the freeboard. Three combustible phases are considered: volatile matter, relatively large non-elutriable char particles and fine char particles of elutriable size. The model takes into account phenomena that assume particular importance with high-volatile solid fuels, namely fuel particle fragmentation and attrition in the bed and volatile matter segregation and postcombustion above the bed. An energy balance on the <b>splashing</b> <b>zone</b> is set up, taking into account volatile matter and elutriated fines postcombustion and radiative and convective heat fluxes to the bed and the freeboard. Results from calculations with a high-volatile biomass fuel indicate that combustion occurs to comparable extents in the bed and in the splashing region of the combustor. Due to volatile matter segregation with respect to the bed, a significant fraction of the heat is released into the splashing region of the combustor and this results in an increase of the temperature in this region. Extensive bed solids recirculation associated to solids ejection/falling back due to bubbles bursting at bed surface promotes thermal feedback from this region to the bed of as much as 80 - 90 % of the heat released by afterburning of volatile matter and elutriated fines. Depending on the operating conditions a significant fraction of the volatile matter may burn in the freeboard or in the cyclone. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Hydrocarbons are {{the most}} common form of energy used to date. The {{activities}} involving exploration and exploitation of large oil and gas fields are constantly in operation and have extended to such hostile environments as the North Sea. This enforces much greater demands on the materials which are used, and the need for enhancing the endurance of the existing ones which must continue parallel to the explorations. Due to their ease in fabrication, relatively high mechanical properties and low costs, steels {{are the most}} widely favoured material for the construction of offshore platforms. The most critical part of an offshore structure prone to failure are the welded nodal joints, particulary those which are used within the vicinity of the <b>splash</b> <b>zones.</b> This is an area of high complex stress concentrations, varying mechanical and metallurgical properties in addition to severe North Sea environmental conditions. The main are of this work has been concerned with the durability studies of this type of steel, based on the concept of the worst case analysis, consisting of combinations of welds of varying qualities, various degrees of stress concentrations and the environmental conditions of stress corrosion and hydrogen embrittlement. The experiments have been designed to reveal significance of defects as sites of crack initiation in the welded steels and the extent to which stress corrosion and hydrogen embrittlement will limit their durability. This has been done for various heat treatments and in some experiments deformation has been forced through the welded zone of the specimens to reveal the mechanical properties of the welds themselves to provide data for finite element simulations. A comparison of the results of these simulations with the actual deformation and fracture behaviour has been done to reveal the extent to which both mechanical and metallurgical factors control behaviour of the steels in the hostile environments of high stress, corrosion, and hydrogen embrittlement at their surface...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Steel {{chains are}} used for many {{maritime}} floating structures including floating production storage and offloading platforms (FPSOs) used in the offshore oil and gas industry. Different components of the mooring systems may be damaged by storm waves and by material deterioration but this process is faster for chains located in the <b>splash</b> <b>zones.</b> A main cause of the damage is the breakage of the mooring chain of the system due to impulsive tension which is produced by large buoy motion and the abrasion between the chain links. Since protection of chains is notoriously difficult by painting or cathodic protection, design {{is based on an}} allowance which accounts for diameter loss due to both corrosion and wear. Metal loss due to corrosion and wear affects the serviceability and reliability of mooring lines and failure due to these factors has serious environmental consequences. Data on metal loss due to corrosion and wear are scarce in literature and usually do not differentiate between these two factors. This research aims to fill in the wear part of this knowledge gap. For this purpose, a test rig was designed by the author and built in the Engineering laboratory of the University of Newcastle. The function of this rig is to cause wear in a 5 -link chain set being held in tension by applying an axial force together with restricting the movement of end links and moving the middle link in an oscillatory motion. The study sheds light on how different factors such as axial force, prior corrosion, wetness conditions, number of wear cycles and amplitude of movement affect the wear rate of the interlink areas of chain links. Measurements conducted include the chain mass loss and bar diameter reduction in the inter-link areas. The study shows a non-linear increase in mass loss of chains during tests with a slightly higher rate during the first 10, 000 to 12, 000 cycles. Also the non-linear effect of axial load on wear rate is shown by performing tests under different axial loads applied on chain sets. Although prior corrosion in marine environment causes mass loss in chains, the wear rate of corroded and un-corroded chains have similar trends. Furthermore, testing in wet conditions showed a significant decrease in wear rate of chains. These main results along with other outcomes of this research are a first attempt in documenting the metal loss of model mooring chains in order to estimate the service life of chains in actual mooring conditions for the prediction of optimum timeframe to change a chain section of a mooring line after some years of service...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} a 1. 1 MW {{fluidized}} bed combustor is modeled. A literature study is performed on aspects which determine {{the characteristics of}} the combustor. A model is set up and calculations for the design of the Fluidized Bed Combustor (FBC) are performed. Characteristics are calculated for the Fluidized Bed (FB) and Freeboard Zone (FBZ). Matlab is used to perform simulations and generate specific parameters for the design of the FBC. The report starts with an introduction on the FBC, from the sustainable and technological point of view. In Chapter 1 a short overview of the history of biomass is given, from where the link to the FBC design is made. The general aspects of a FBC are stated. Chapter 2 shows the results of the literature study. In particular attention is paid to the formation of greenhouse gasses, which {{play an important role in}} power generation and thus in FBC’s. Possibilities to reduce these pollutants are mentioned. It is explained why the formation of thermal NOX is primarily dependent on the temperature and stoichiometry. In the model the formation of thermal NOX is neglected, since the reaction temperature is too low to generate significant amounts of NOX. Fuel NOX seems to contribute in a larger amount to the NOX formation, but the contribution is still unsignificant in the model. The formation of Carbon Monoxide (CO) plays a more important role. This formation is directly related to the mixing of fuel and air at sufficient temperature. To reduce the CO formation, an optimal air to fuel ratio and a greater residence time are suggested. In Chapter 3 the design of the model is presented. This chapter starts with the outcome of the literature study, where the principles of the FBC are described. After that, a list of assumptions is presented. The overview of the assumptions is specified and worked out for the different reactor zones in the FBC: the Fluidized Bed, the <b>Splashing</b> <b>Zone</b> and the Freeboard Zone. Chapter 4 elaborates on the air speed in the FBC. The air speed affects important running characteristics such as the behavior of the sand particles in the bed, the burning efficiency and the formation of greenhouse gasses. It is also an important parameter for the determination of the dimensions of the FB and FBZ. This chapter concludes with a section including numeric values and results of the calculations are presented, which in turn are used for the calculations on the combustor model. The complete model is presented in Chapter 5. Detailed calculations on the model are explained, starting with the combustion reactions. This model description includes molar ratio’s, caloric values and mass flows. Furthermore specific energy balances are shown for each section of the combustor. Finally, the wall losses are defined.

40|$|Graduation date: 2003 We have a poor {{understanding}} of the biotic communities in zero-order basins, drainages extending from ridgelines to the initiation of first-order streams. This study describes baseline plant and amphibian composition in unmanaged zero-order basins in the Oregon Coast Range. Specifically, I studied: i) the spatial distribution and diversity of species, including riparian-associates; and ii) the dominant environmental, spatial and geomorphic gradients in species composition The results of this research have implications for riparian management in steep, forested landscapes in the Pacific Northwest. The composition of tree and shrub layers in zero-order basins was more similar to upland areas than to larger-order riparian areas. Douglas-fir, western hemlock, and western red cedar had highest basal areas; bigleaf maple had highest hardwood density. Convergent areas (areas collecting surface flow) had significantly lower relative densities than surrounding slopes. I identified 138 forest floor herb, shrub, and seedling tree species in zero-order basins. Gradient analysis and empirical modeling suggested that the composition of forest floor plant assemblages was associated with environmental parameters related to geomorphic position and overstory characteristics, such as distance from basin center, basin aspect and overstory relative density. Vegetation types, developed using classification, followed similar environmental patterns. Vegetation types were useful in clarifying environmental gradients acting on groups of plant species, and in delineating the lateral extent of geomorphic and fluvial influences. Riparian-associated vegetation types were mostly restricted to valley floors and lower slope areas. Geomorphic and lateral surfaces were drivers of environmental gradients in zero-order basins; plant species composition followed these geomorphic gradients. Surfaces close to basin center ("inner gorges"), including valley centers, <b>splash</b> <b>zones,</b> and lower slope areas, supported the highest plant species diversity and most distinct plant assemblages. The spatial distribution patterns of amphibian species and assemblages were characterized along longitudinal and lateral gradients, and relative to three geomorphic surfaces (valleys, headmost areas and slopes), and empirical species-habitat models were developed. I identified eight amphibian species in zero-order basins (865 total captures), and analyzed data for six. Headmost areas supported a distinctive upland amphibian assemblage, while valley floors had the highest riparian amphibian diversity. Captures of three riparian species were higher in valley surfaces, within S m {{of the center of}} zero-order basins, while captures of three upland species were highest in areas 2 - 5 m from center. Upland-associated species were captured two times farther from basin centers than riparian-associated species. The best predictors of amphibian captures in empirical models were geomorphic, stability/ disturbance, moisture and overstory parameters. Ordination and indicator species analysis facilitated characterization of amphibian species assemblages within geomorphic surface zones, and suggested spatial compression of habitats and species in zero-order basins, in comparison to broader spatial extents in larger basins. Plant and amphibian assemblages in unmanaged zero-order basins were most similar to each other in their lateral and geomorphic spatial patterning, including the importance of inner gorge areas for support of diverse communities. Plant species were strongly associated with geomorphic position parameters, while amphibians had stronger ties to discrete microhabitat elements such as moisture levels and large substrate. Amphibians appeared to have a more distinctive assemblage in headmost areas than plant species. Results suggest that assemblages of plants and amphibians in these basins are distinct from both larger-order riparian assemblages and from vegetation in surrounding hillslopes. Riparian management designs could take these spatial patterns and habitat associations into account to maintain the ecological integrity of headwater communities. The longitudinal and lateral extents of landscape areas managed to minimize risk to persistence of zero-order basin plant and amphibian assemblages would need to incorporate both fluvial and hillslope disturbance regimes, and microhabitat features associated with them...|$|R
