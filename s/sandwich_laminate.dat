40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a series of tensile pull off tests on Composite T-joints as part of a {{comprehensive}} test programme undertaken {{under the auspices of the}} EUCLID RTP 3. 21 project on “Survivability, Durability and Performance of Naval Composite Structures”. The tests have been developed to evaluate joints suitable for use with large composite superstructures i. e. a hangar on a frigate type warship. To assess the performance of these joints under quasi-static and dynamic loading, test procedures have been developed using both shock table facilities and conventional servo-hydraulic test machines. The test procedures are fully complementary to ensure that test results can be directly compared. Test results established that the joint failed within the interface between the base <b>sandwich</b> <b>laminate</b> and the joint overlaminate. As joint assembly is a secondary process this is to be anticipated. Both the dynamic and quasi-static test results showed similar tensile loading performances; for quasi-static testing core shear failure immediately preceded joint failure, whereas no core failure was noted for the dynamic tests.

40|$|Metal/polymer/metal <b>sandwich</b> <b>laminates</b> show {{a rising}} rate {{in a variety}} of applications, for {{instance}} in automotive and aircraft industry. Due to the dissimilarity between the metal skin sheets and the polymer core, characterizing the forming potential of such laminates is a necessity. In this study, steel skin sheets and polypropylene-polyethylene copolymer as core sheet – called <b>sandwich</b> <b>laminates</b> - were used. They were produced in a roll bonding process using an adhesive agent. One major research point in IMET is investigating the effect of core and skin thicknesses on the forming behavior and mechanical properties of the <b>sandwich</b> <b>laminates.</b> Forming behavior is evaluated using deep drawing in addition to determining the forming limit curves (FLC). Bonding strength is evaluated by lap shear tests. More-over, the durability of the steel/polymer joints are evaluated under hydrothermal ageing conditions following heating/cooling regime cycles. Basically, the mechanical properties were determined using tensile testing. The adhesion test results show good adhesion strength and a cohesive failure mode. The lap shear strength after ageing shows no remarkable deterioration. The deep drawability of the <b>sandwich</b> <b>laminates</b> depends on the thicknesses of the layers and their volume fraction. With increasing the core thickness, the limiting drawing ratio (LDR) decreases and the probability of wrinkling in the flange area and cracking is higher as well.

40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{approach}} {{in how to}} design a composite <b>sandwich</b> <b>laminate,</b> {{that is to be}} used for an open wheeled race car with a monocoque chassis. The composite sandwich design of the monocoque must be in accordance with the 2013 Formula SAE regulations. The composite <b>sandwich</b> <b>laminate</b> is to be used in a preliminary monocoque design based on the Revolve NTNU’s 2013 student race car, the KA Aquilo R. The composite materials for the monocoque’s sandwich structure are HexPly 6376 and Rohacell 110 WF, which were available to Revolve NTNU in 2013. An effort has been attempted to identify the specific requirements for the composite laminate in the 2013 FSAE rules. In summary, a representative sandwich layup of the monocoque, in a 500 x 200 mm panel, must satisfy the requirements concerning bending stiffness and strength, through physical three point bending test. And a representative layup must also resist specified penetration forces from a 25 mm in diameter cylindrical bar. The two select composite sandwich layups for the preliminary monocoque, [0 / 45 /s] with 25 mm core thickness and [0 / 45 /s] with 35 mm core thickness, has been assessed by analytical calculations, FEA simulations and physical testing. In addition, an FEA simulation has been carried out to compute the torsional stiffness of the preliminary monocoque with the select layups, for comparison with the KA Aquilo R’s tubular steel space frame chassis. The final results from the physical three point bending tests were approximately in coherence with the analytical calculations and FEA analysis. And also the select sandwich layups were well within the penetration requirements after the physical testing. In regards to torsional stiffness, the preliminary monocoque had almost 40...|$|E

Two dimensional (21)) partial differential equations (PDEs) of such a laminate are obtained by imposing plane-strain conditions of elasticity. The fundamental dependent variables are so selected in this formulation that they satisfy the continuity of displacements and transverse interlaminar stresses at the laminate interface through the thickness. The set of governing PDEs are transformed into a set Of Coupled first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) in thickness direction by assuming Suitable global orthogonal trigonometric functions for the fundamental variables satisfying the boundary conditions.

This replacement is already occurring in several industrial sectors, from building to automotive. However, the nautical field seems reluctant in embracing this innovation; reasons might be found in the lack of technical references describing the bio-composite boat construction methods and the durability of the yacht within time.

40|$|This study {{involves}} an experimental and analytical investigation of low-velocity impact phenomenon in sandwich composite structures. The analytical solution of a three-dimensional finite-geometry multi-layer specially orthotropic panel subjected to static and transient transverse loading cases is presented. The governing equations of the static and dynamic formulations {{are derived from}} Reissner's functional and solved by enforcing the continuity of traction and displacement components between adjacent layers. For the dynamic loading case, the governing equations are solved by applying Fourier or Laplace transformation in time. Additionally, the static solution is extended to solve the contact problem between the <b>sandwich</b> <b>laminate</b> and a rigid sphere. An iterative method is employed to determine the sphere's unknown contact area and pressure distribution.

Low-velocity impact tests were conducted to characterize the type and extent of the damage observed in a variety of sandwich configurations with graphite/epoxy face sheets and foam or honeycomb cores.

The objective of this research program is to experimentally and computationally determine the static and fatigue response for two methods of repair to an E/Glass-Epoxy <b>sandwich</b> <b>laminate.</b> The proposed methods of repair are a scarf and overlap patch. A series of tests was carried out on square composite sandwich panels under direct tension and rectangular sandwich panels under four-point flexure. The performance of the repaired panels was compared against undamaged panels to establish a baseline comparison for the methods of repair. Computational models were constructed, which incorporated a non-linear material response subroutine, to model damage initiation and propagation and its effects on the structural integrity of a repaired panel. The material subroutine accurately predicted the mode and location of damage initiation and propagation under static and fatigue loading. It also provided excellent agreement with the global effects of damage observed during the static and fatigue tests. Both methods of repair proved to perform in an excellent manner under static and fatigue loading. Negative R ratio fatigue loading, however, was found to have a much greater effect than positive R ratio fatigue loading on the initiation and propagation of damage and the endurance of the panels. The scarf repair demonstrated a slightly higher endurance to fatigue loading than the overlap repair for both positive and negative R ratio loading.

40|$|Many large {{composite}} structures are manufactured using sandwich laminates to achieve high specific bending strength and stiffness. Examples include wind turbine blades, where self-weight becomes increasingly important as blade size increases. Resin infusion of three-dimensional sandwich laminates {{can result in}} complex resin flow paths, and subsequent defect formation, which are difficult to predict. The core material used for sandwich construction and its interaction with liquid resins may also influence the formation of defects, {{and in the case}} of balsa this effect can be used to reduce defect severity. In order to evaluate the effect of cored <b>sandwich</b> <b>laminate</b> construction on the formation of defects, this thesis concentrates on the characterisation of commonly used core materials and their interaction with liquid resin under high vacuum conditions. It also considers two numerical flow-modelling packages which are shown to be effective at the prediction of flow front convergence for monolithic laminate, but over-estimate defect severity when modelling air- permeable cored laminates. For balsa core, experiments indicate that the available pore space can act as sink for trapped air, which can aid the reduction of defects where multiple flow fronts converge due to the complexity of flow in sandwich laminates. Empirical data for air absorption and desorption rates in balsa core were obtained using a custom-designed experiment. Using these data a theoretical model was developed that can indicate available pore space, which can inform optimum processing conditions, such as time under vacuum. The diffusion coefficients obtained for air absorption and desorption in balsa are very similar, and lie in the middle of published ranges for hard woods at around 2 x 10 - 7 m 2 /s. The methodology developed for this research project represents actual behaviour of air absorption/desorption during resin infusion, whilst other techniques do not, merely measuring diffusion of air through a sample not allowing for finite pore space. In consequence, infusion strategies can be planned more precisely because core/resin interaction is better understood. Knit line defect formation could be predicted with greater accuracy with suitably modified flow-modelling programs. Vestas Technologies, EPSR...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 105 - 109) In tapered closeouts designs, the <b>sandwich</b> <b>laminate</b> is transitioned to a solid laminate, {{with high}} compressive strength, {{by eliminating the}} core. Tapered closeouts {{are found to be}} prone to fatigue failure by delamination. The delaminations initiate at the region where the upper and lower facesheet meet to form a solid laminate, due to the presence of voids or resin rich areas. These cracks then grow along the facesheet-core interfaces and lead to fatigue failure by delamination. Improving the fatigue life of sandwich closeouts requires {{a better understanding of the}} stresses and the damage growth mechanisms. The goal of this study is to elucidate the deformation mechanisms, load transfer, and interface stresses in the tapered close out section of a sandwich. The investigation of sandwich closeouts were performed using finite element analyses (FEA). The effects of geometry and facesheet to core stiffness on the deformation and stresses in the closeout regions are presented. The symmetry of the taper geometry and the interaction of the facesheet and core local deformation at the closeout regions are shown to provide anisotropic shear-bending coupling and shear-extension coupling. Large facesheet-core interfacial shear and normal stresses arise at the closeout region due to the localized bending at this region. The preliminary investigations also showed that the gradient in the geometry of the core leads to gradients in deformation and stress in the region. To compensate for stiffness reduction in the core geometry, use of functionally graded material (FGM) for the cores at the closeout locations are investigated. FGM cores with various gradations in the elastic modulus of the core along the closeout region were analyzed. The results indicate that increasing the core modulus at the tapered closeout apex region is effective in reducing the local deformations. However, these increases lead to small increases in stress. The increase in stress in the FGM core is not a significant concern, because in FGMs increasing stiffness can also lead to increase in strength. Decreasing the core modulus at the closeout apex regions was found to be most effective in reducing the stresses. However, such a design has large localized deformations and reduced structural stiffness. The analyses indicate that a FGM material with decreasing inplane modulus, but increasing out of plane and shear modulus will be an optimum choice for the core material at the closeout location...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{knitting}} technology with advanced fibres such as glass, carbon and aramid, to produce near-net-shape fabrics has {{in recent years}} received increasing interest from the composite materials community. Knitted fabrics have the potential of being used in engineering structures with complex shapes {{in conjunction with a}} suitable liquid moulding technique, such as Resin Transfer Moulding (RTM), due to their excellent drapeability and manufacturability. During previous studies in textile reinforced composites, an intimate relationship between the fabric architecture and the damage development has been demonstrated. In this work, the quasi-static tensile loading deformation behaviour and the relation between the fabric architecture and damage development have been studied for a weft knitted glass fabric. Tensile properties have been examined and the failure mechanisms have been identified experimentally by analysing the damage process in-situ with a camera and by studying fracture surfaces using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The acoustic emission technique was used to support the microscopic analysis. The work has investigated the tensile properties and failure mechanisms of three knitted fabric reinforced composite laminates reinforced with a Milano weft knitted glass fabric. The three composites were (i) a single layer of fabric reinforcing epoxy resin, (ii) a single knitted fabric layer sandwiched between 0 ° glass fibre unidirectional plies (again with the glass reinforcing epoxy resin), and (iii) the same knitted glass fabric but this time used as the reinforcement in commercially produced high fibre volume fraction composites (using the RTM technique). The variation of mechanical properties with angle (from wale to course) has been measured for the single layer of the fabric reinforcing epoxy resin by orientating the wale direction of the fabric at different angles. Mechanical properties have been measured for each angular orientation and comparisons were made between them, especially with regard to the planes of final failure. The single layer composites failed as soon as the first damage was initiated. Hence, to investigate damage accumulation, a novel technique was employed to manufacture a <b>sandwich</b> <b>laminate,</b> which consisted in placing a single knitted fabric layer between 0 ° glass fibre unidirectional plies. The success of this method is that the accumulation of damage in the knitted architecture was allowed to be studied and some characteristics of crack initiation and crack propagation could be related to the fabric geometry and structure. Experiments on these model transparent materials have been complemented by tests on two types of commercial knitted fabric composite manufactured by the RTM process. Characterization of these materials under tensile loading has been carried out for monotonic and cyclic loading and the results have been compared with those found for the single layer and the sandwich model material. Various failure mechanisms such as cracking at loop cross-over points, resin matrix cracking, fibre bundle debonding and tensile fracture of fibre bundles in failed specimens were observed. The behaviour of the commercial RTM specimens has been discussed {{in the light of the}} results obtained from the model single layer and sandwich specimens...|$|E

40|$|A higher-order bending {{theory is}} derived for <b>laminated</b> {{composite}} and <b>sandwich</b> beams thus extending the recent { 1, 2 }-order theory to include third-order axial effect without introducing additional kinematic variables. The present theory is of order { 3, 2 } and includes both transverse shear and transverse normal deformations. A closed-form {{solution to the}} cylindrical bending problem is derived and compared with the corresponding exact elasticity solution. The numerical comparisons {{are focused on the}} most challenging material systems and beam aspect ratios which include moderate-to-thick unsymmetric composite and <b>sandwich</b> <b>laminates.</b> Advantages and limitations of the theory are discussed...|$|R
40|$|A simple C 0 isoparametric {{finite element}} {{formulation}} {{based on a}} higher-order displacement model {{for the analysis of}} symmetric and unsymmetric, composite, and <b>sandwich</b> <b>laminates</b> subjected to a thermal gradient across the thickness is presented. The displacement model accounts for the nonlinear distribution of in-plane displacement components through the plate thickness, and the theory requires no shear correction coefficients. The nine-noded quadratic Lagrangian two-dimensional element is used with five and nine degrees of freedom per node. The accuracy of the formulation is verified by analyzing sample problems available in literature. Numerical results are presented in nondimensional form for symmetric, antisymmetric, and cross-ply laminates, both thick and thin...|$|R
40|$|The dynamic {{instability}} of composite and <b>sandwich</b> <b>laminates</b> with interfacial slips is studied in this paper. An efficient {{finite element model}} recently developed by the authors {{is used for the}} purpose. The plate model is based on a refined higher-order shear deformation theory, where the transverse shear stresses are continuous at the layer interfaces with stress free conditions at plate top and bottom. A linear spring-layer model is used to model the interfacial slips by introducing in-plane displacement jump at the interfaces. Some interesting new results are presented in this paper, which are useful to understanding of the behavior of laminated composite materials. Anupam Chakrabarti and Abdul Hamid Sheik...|$|R
