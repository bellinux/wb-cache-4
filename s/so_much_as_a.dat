5|$|During {{the pulp}} era, {{explicit}} sexuality {{of any kind}} was rare in genre science fiction and fantasy. For many years, the editors who controlled what was published {{felt that they had}} to protect the adolescent male readership that they identified as their principal market. Although the covers of some 1930s pulp magazines showed scantily clad women menaced by tentacled aliens, the covers were often more lurid than the magazines' contents. In such a context, writers like Edgar Pangborn, who featured passionate male friendships in his work, were exceptional; almost until the end of their careers, including <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> kiss would have been too much. Implied or disguised sexuality was as important as that which was openly revealed. As such, genre SF reflected the social mores of the day, paralleling common prejudices; This was particularly true of pulp fiction, more so than literary works of the time.|$|E

It also is concerned with helping clients achieve their highest potential.|$|E
25|$|The outer part of {{the double}} coat should be {{straight}} and wiry in texture, never soft, silky, curly, wavy, or woolly {{as might be expected}} in the Kerry Blue Terrier. The coat should lie flat against the skin, and, though having some length, should never be so long as to hide the true shape of the dog. There are longer hairs on the legs, but never <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Wire Fox Terrier or Schnauzer. That means {{you have to have the}} coat trimmed often which can be expensive.|$|E

25|$|However, in {{the postwar}} years Smith was a {{mainstay}} of Warwickshire cricket right up to his retirement {{at the end of}} 1930. During this period, he not only kept wicket consistently, but also advanced <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> batsman that he scored 1,303 runs in 1922 and 1,477 at over 31 an innings in 1925. In that season, he played a brilliant unbeaten innings of 139 out of 392 for one against Sussex and was unlucky that Jack Hobbs' presentation may have denied him a chance for Cricketer of the Year nomination by Wisden.|$|E
25|$|By the 1949 season, Gladwin had {{developed}} <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> batsman {{that he made}} 124 against Nottinghamshire and scored over 900 runs. However, he did not maintain this standard and only made one score over fifty in his last six seasons. However, as a bowler, Gladwin was always {{near the top of}} the averages until he retired in 1958 – though the return of England's pace bowling to more reasonable strength meant that he was out of the running for a Test berth during the 1950s. At times, owing to Derbyshire's shortage of spin, Gladwin actually bowled off-breaks when conditions were favourable.|$|E
25|$|In forming {{their view}} of Attila's people, the Romans tapped into attitudes {{inherited}} from the Greeks. These were the vilest creatures imaginable. They came from the North and everyone knew that the colder the climate was, the more barbaric the people were. They knew nothing of metal, had no religion and lived like savages, without fire, eating their food raw, living off roots, and meat tenderized by placing it under their horses' saddles. They had no buildings, of course, not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> reed hut, indeed, they feared {{the very idea of}} venturing under a roof.|$|E

25|$|In 1947, Deming was {{involved}} in early planning for the 1951 Japanese Census. The Allied powers were occupying Japan, and he {{was asked by the}} United States Department of the Army to assist with the census. He was brought over at the behest of General Douglas MacArthur, who grew frustrated at being unable to complete <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> phone call without the line going dead due to Japan's shattered post-war economy. While in Japan, his expertise in quality control techniques, combined with his involvement in Japanese society, brought him an invitation from the Japanese Union of Scientists and Engineers (JUSE).|$|E
25|$|Before 1809, Eugène never led <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{regiment}} into battle, yet Napoleon entrusted {{him with}} {{command of the}} Army of Italy. To prepare his stepson Eugène for the role, the emperor advised him how to defend Italy in many detailed letters. He wrote that if the Austrians invaded in superior numbers, the viceroy was {{to give up the}} Isonzo River line and fall back to the Piave River. The emperor noted that the Adige river was a particularly important strategic position. Napoleon did not believe Austria would attack in April, and in any case, did not wish to provoke his enemy by concentrating his armies. Therefore, Eugène's army remained somewhat dispersed.|$|E
25|$|On 28 July 1847, Whyte {{recorded}} {{the neglect of}} his fellow passengers, who 'within reach of help' 'were to be left enveloped in reeking pestilence, the sick without medicine, medical skill, nourishment, or <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> drop of pure water'. However, conditions on other Irish emigrant ships were still worse. Two Canadian priests who visited the Ajax described the holds of other vessels {{where they had been}} 'up to their ankles in filth. The wretched emigrants crowded together like cattle and corpses remain long unburied'. Whyte contrasted this with the condition of German immigrants arriving at Grosse Isle. These were all free of sickness, 'comfortably and neatly clad, clean and happy'. The Times also commented on the 'healthy, robust and cheerful' Germans.|$|E

25|$|The {{political}} and social assumptions underlying the early Robin Hood ballads have long been controversial. It has been influentially argued by J. C. Holt that the Robin Hood legend was cultivated in the households of the gentry, {{and that it would}} be mistaken to see in him a figure of peasant revolt. He is not a peasant but a yeoman, and his tales make no mention of the complaints of the peasants, such as oppressive taxes. He appears not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> revolt against societal standards as an embodiment of them, being generous, pious, and courteous, opposed to stingy, worldly, and churlish foes. Other scholars have by contrast stressed the subversive aspects of the legend, and see in the medieval Robin Hood ballads a plebeian literature hostile to the feudal order.|$|E
25|$|In the {{subsequent}} year, the social psychologist Gerhard Vinnai (University of Bremen), came to similar conclusions. When writing his work Hitler – Scheitern und Vernichtungswut (2004; “Hitler – Failing and rage of destruction”), Vinnai had a psychoanalytic point of depart; he first subjected Hitler’s book Mein Kampf a depth psychological interpretation {{and tried to}} reconstruct how Hitler had processed his experiences in World War I {{against the background of}} his childhood and youth. But similar to Dorpat, Vinnai explains the destructive potential in Hitler's psyche not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of early childhood experiences, but rather due to trauma that Hitler had suffered as a soldier in World War I. Not only Hitler, but a substantial part of the German population was affected by such war trauma. Vinnai then leaves the psychoanalytical discourse and comments on social psychological questions, such as how Hitler’s political world view could have emerged from his trauma and how this could appeal to large numbers of people.|$|E
25|$|The use of sidestick {{controller}} {{had been}} discounted for three main reasons: it took too much {{space on the}} starboard console; {{it was difficult for}} an instructor pilot to monitor his pupil as it was a force transducer; and it would mean that <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> minor right arm injury would jeopardise the mission. The adoption of a tilted seat was ruled out during development since it would have elevated the pilot's knees, causing a reduction in available panel space, and would also cause the high-g neck and shoulder strain injuries that were common amongst F-16 pilots. The standard practice of providing a second seat for conversion training, by means of reduced fuel or avionics was shunned by IAI. They designed the two-seater as the base model which was then adapted into a single-seater, leaving ample space for avionics growth. It was intended that the first 30 production aircraft would be two-seaters to aid service entry.|$|E

25|$|The Ivy Mike test on November 1, 1952 was a {{complete}} success, {{but it was not}} <b>a</b> weapon <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> experiment to verify the Teller and Stanislaw Ulam's design. Years of work was still required to produce a usable weapon.|$|R

25|$|National glory {{returned}} in 2002–03 when Bayern achieved its fourth double {{by winning the}} Bundesliga with the second largest gap ever to the runner-up and a straight 3–1 win over 1. FC Kaiserslautern in the cup final. However, the whole season was overshadowed by Bayern's unceremonious exit from the Champions League in the first group stage, without <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> single win in six matches. The following season, the team, enhanced with the €19 million acquisition of Dutch striker Roy Makaay from Deportivo de La Coruña, overcame at least this hurdle, but even an underperforming Real Madrid in crisis managed to eliminate the Reds in the round of 16. Bayern itself was not reaching any consistent form all year and even the formerly sturdy defence proved highly vulnerable. In the end, the club's second-placed finish in the league was not descriptive of Bayern's strength but rather of inconsistent performances by its competitors. The cup elimination by second division Alemannia Aachen was symptomatic for a season in which the team showed not a single convincing performance. Even the newcomers Michael Ballack and 2002 World Cup-winning defender Lúcio could not make a difference.|$|E

As Chaney noted, it [...] "wasn't a number <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> musical celebration of New Directions' championship status", but it nevertheless received an [...] "A−" [...] grade from her and from Slezak.

500|$|In 1941, St Andrew's {{suffered}} 20 direct {{hits from}} Luftwaffe bombing, which destroyed {{the roof of}} the Kop, badly damaged the Railway End, and forced the team to play elsewhere. It was therefore a surprising choice of venue for a wartime international match between England and Wales; on safety grounds, spectators were required to purchase tickets in advance, and numbers were limited to 25,000. Three months later, the Main Stand, which was being used as a temporary National Fire Service station, burned down, destroying the club's records and equipment – [...] "not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> lead pencil was saved from the wreckage" [...] – when a fireman mistook a bucket of petrol for water when intending to damp down a brazier.
