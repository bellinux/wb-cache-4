3000|$|... {{design of}} the {{resulting}} luminaire: the aggregation of the basic modules needed to create the suspended, the free-standing and the task-light luminaire was coupled with the power supply into a package. A supporting system was designed to assembly the different components and to guarantee the mechanical resistance. It was also conceived to allow the OLED modules to be individually tilted. For the <b>suspended</b> <b>luminaire,</b> for instance, each module can allow a tilting of up to 180 °: the user can hence decide the final ‘look’ of the luminaire, {{as well as its}} actual photometric distribution of the light output (direct, indirect, or any intermediate combinations).|$|E
2500|$|The {{defining}} {{features of}} the building is a [...] corrugated, perforated aluminum screen wall system across its southern façade which forms a distinctive jutting prow. [...] With a 40% open area, the screen wall sits three {{feet in front of}} an expansive glazed curtain wall and provides shading of the upper level reading room while allowing natural daylight to enter the space. [...] The shading system allows a reduced dependence on artificial lighting and protects the Library’s collection from harmful solar exposure. To take full advantage of the location's potential for unobstructed natural light, clerestory windows and translucent, insulated fiberglass panels on the north provide illumination from the sun on all sides. Lighting design firm MCLA validated light levels in the large, open room through a detailed analysis. The lighting designers developed an electric lighting system based primarily on the T5 linear fluorescent with a 3500-Kelvin color temperature—the lamp preferred by the client for energy and maintenance efficiency. Special fixtures are cantilevered from the tall stacks for vertical illumination on the books, and <b>suspended</b> <b>luminaires</b> are mounted over reading tables and workstations.|$|R

These include, for example, office <b>luminaires</b> <b>suspended</b> from the ceiling and emitting light upwards and downwards.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} two experiments {{concerning the}} effects of variations in lighting quality on office worker performance, health, and well-being. Experi-ment 1 had four experimental conditions: a regular array of fully direct recessed parabolic luminaires; direct/indirect luminaires with no control; direct/indirect luminaires with a switchable desk lamp; and, workstation-specific direct/indirect luminaires with control over the direct portion. Experiment 2 contrasted two conditions with no individual lighting control: a regular array of recessed prismatic lensed <b>luminaires,</b> and <b>suspended</b> direct/indirect <b>luminaires.</b> Particip-ants considered the direct/indirect systems to be more comfortable than the direct-only systems, with a further increase in comfort associated with individual control in Experiment 1. There were no simple main effects of lighting quality {{on the performance of}} any task, although the expected changes in performance associated with task visibility, practice, and fatigue were found. Interactions between lighting quality and time suggested that having a degree of individual control of lighting tended to maintain motivation and vigilance over the day. 1...|$|R
30|$|This paper {{presented}} the ODALINE project, {{a research project}} whose main output was concerned with the development and manufacturing {{of a family of}} OLED luminaires based on concepts of modularity and flexibility. The research team worked through a multidisciplinary approach, which allowed addressing various aspects such as: lighting requirements; formal, geometrical and constructive features; photometric properties through primary and secondary optical systems purposely designed; power supply performances, also for the control of the light output. Basically, a single OLED unit (OLED model LG 6 S 1, manufactured by LGChem) was selected for the project and aggregated so as to create a basic module (consisting of an array of 6 units). Further aggregations of the basic module allowed creating a <b>suspended</b> <b>luminaire</b> (6 modules), a free-standing luminaire (4 modules) and a task-light (1 module). These luminaires are suitable for different indoor applications with are characterized by different lighting requirements: they can be combined in different ways to guarantee the minimum illuminance and uniformity values over the considered work planes. The application to a number of spaces (conference and office rooms, train coaches, healthcare rooms) was explored through a set of Dialux simulations.|$|E
30|$|Results of {{the project}} ‘ODALINE’ (OLED Devices Application in Luminaires for Interior and Exterior lighting) are presented. A team of {{academic}} and industrial partners worked together to design and manufacture a family of OLED luminaires. The project went through the following phases: i) analysis of the state-of-the-art of OLED technology; ii) identification of scenarios and application fields for OLED-based lighting systems and definition of requirements and performances expected for each scenario; iii) definition {{of the concept of}} new OLED lighting systems and development of their preliminary design; iv) executive design and manufacturing of some prototypes. After the identification of the most suitable OLED unit and of the application scenarios, the concept of the new luminaires was conceived: the luminaires rely on a suitable aggregation of a base module (consisting of an array of 6 OLED units, measuring 30 cm ∗ 20 cm) to provide systems with enhanced properties in terms of high efficiency, high quality light and flexibility as the luminaires can be combined to respond to different lighting tasks for indoor environmental applications. Final output of the research project was the manufacturing of three prototypes: a <b>suspended</b> <b>luminaire</b> (6 basic modules), a free-standing luminaire (4 basic modules) and a task lighting luminaire (1 module). The power supply system, consistently with the general concept, was developed for a single module rather than for the whole luminaire. Its architecture was conceived to allow the control of the luminaire (switching on/off, dimming) through the DALI digital protocol. Furthermore, some secondary optics were conceived and designed to concentrate the Lambertian light output and to increase the utilization factor of the flux.|$|E
50|$|The French {{windows to}} the garden terrace were full height and oak framed, with small glazing panels. Heavy plain {{curtains}} were hung on {{what appear to be}} plain tubular rails, probably of brass.The stair hall shows a similar approach to finishes and furnishings. The stair itself is of oak with high quality joinery as in all Prior's buildings. The twisted oak balustrade echos the form of the twisting chimneys outside. Oak panelling was used in the billiard room and included Prior's usual use of built in facilities. Ceiling treatments were generally simple, in white distemper. Lighting fittings were typical of the Arts and Craft Movement with a range of ceiling and wall lighting fittings, generally with <b>luminaires</b> <b>suspended</b> by chains with glass shades.|$|R
