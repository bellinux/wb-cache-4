30|$|In this {{connection}} {{it is interesting}} to note that the public authorities of the EU did not themselves take steps to ensure compliance with the (minimal) sustainability criteria the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) sets for biofuels, but actually relied on <b>stakeholder</b> <b>platforms</b> consisting of business organizations and NGOs to implement voluntary schemes for certifying “sustainable” biofuels (Richardson 2014). Thus the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) created in 2010 a voluntary add-on to the existing RSPO standard to enable producers to comply with the EU’s sustainability criteria (RSPO-RED). Similar schemes have been set up by other <b>stakeholder</b> <b>platforms</b> like Bonsucra (sugarcane-based biofuels from Brazil) or the Roundtable for Sustainable Biofuels. In 2012, the European Commission recognized several of these voluntary certification schemes. It can be argued that the public authorities in the EU have passed the practical responsibility for ensuring compliance with their sustainability criteria onto the private sector. Although ‘reformist’ NGOs like the Worldwide Fund for Nature are generally willing to participate in such <b>stakeholder</b> <b>platforms,</b> more radical environmental organizations like Friends of the Earth tend to keep aloof from them (Schouten et al. 2012). Radical NGOs point out that, by their very nature, certification schemes cannot deal with ILUC effects. Even if the certification standard went beyond the quite minimal EU criteria, it would still be unable to capture such effects (Richardson 2014).|$|E

40|$|The Andean {{highlands}} {{are home}} to some of the poorest rural households in South America. Native potato varieties and local knowledge for their cultivation and use are unique resources possessed by farmers in these areas. As the forces of globalization and market integration penetrate the Andes, they present both challenges and opportunities for farmers there. This paper reports on how the Papa Andina Regional Initiative is promoting the use of collective action to reduce poverty in the Andes, by developing market niches and adding value to potatoes, particularly the native potatoes grown by poor farmers. Since 1998, Papa Andina has worked with partners in Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru to stimulate pro-poor innovation within market chains for potato-based products. Market chain actors (including small-scale potato producers, traders, and processors), researchers, and other service providers have engaged in innovation processes via two principal tools for facilitating collective action: the Participatory Market Chain Approach (PMCA) and <b>Stakeholder</b> <b>Platforms.</b> The PMCA fosters commercial, technological, and institutional innovation through a structured process that builds interest, trust, and collaboration among participants. <b>Stakeholder</b> <b>Platforms</b> provide a space for potato producers, other market chain actors, and service providers to come together to identify their common interests, share knowledge, and develop joint activities. The PMCA and <b>Stakeholder</b> <b>Platforms</b> have empowered Andean potato farmers by expanding their knowledge of markets, market agents, and business opportunities. Social networks built up among producers, market agents, and service providers have stimulated commercial innovation, which in turn has stimulated technical and institutional innovation. These innovations have allowed small farmers to market their potatoes on more favorable terms and other market chain actors to increase their incomes. This paper describes experiences with collective action in Bolivia, Ecuador, and Peru, via the PMCA and <b>Stakeholder</b> <b>Platforms.</b> Based on these experiences, a number of lessons are formulated for using collective action to stimulate innovation, market access, and poverty reduction in other settings.

Through focus group discussions with farmers and other stakeholders, different forage species were selected by farmers to be planted on their farms. Farmers evaluated the performance and impact of the different forages they planted in 2008 and made further choices on which to plant in following years. The results of the initial evaluation process revealed that there were preferences for certain forage species from the various options they tried in their farms. During the second year, the farmers were encouraged to plant the forage species of their preference for further fodder development. Through the activities of the <b>stakeholder</b> <b>platforms</b> successful fodder species and the processes which led to their uptake have been scaled out to new kebeles and farmers in the three woredas.

This paper analyzes a project designed to strengthen the ability of smallholders to innovate in ways that improved the returns to fodder use in Ethiopia. The paper applies an innovation systems perspective to the innovation process as a means of describing the contribution of a project-driven multi-stakeholder platform. A number of key lessons were gleaned from our research. Participatory selection of technologies that addressed farmers' priority problems and demonstrating tangible economic benefits were found to be effective in winning the trust of farmers and drawing the attention of a wider group of stakeholders. The benefits from the technologies needed to carry limited risk and accrue early economic gains to be attractive to farmers. Linking forage technologies with a range of value chain issues in livestock enterprises was essential for successful adoption of forage technologies by farmers. Engaging diverse actors in <b>stakeholder</b> <b>platforms,</b> including local decision makers, along the dairy/fattening value chain was found to be instrumental in turning the wealth of knowledge surrounding fodder technologies and practices into action and creating immediate benefits to poor livestock keepers. On the other hand we found that nurturing collective capacity of a network of organizations and individuals was a major challenge for small projects with limited mandate and resources. For sustainability, organizations with a long term commitment and strong decision-making power need to play a leading role in facilitating innovation processes. An effective agricultural innovation system requires a cadre of professionals with a new skill set and mind set (markets, agribusiness, rural institutions, rural microfinance, facilitation, system analysis, conflict management, etc.). This implies the need for research and development organizations to re-skill, and the need for the reform of university curricula to include skills in agribusiness, communication and partnership facilitation.

He outlines the approach followed in the project - trying {{to strike a balance between}} the technological and institutional angles. The project helps groups of stakeholders - farmers, private sector, dairy coops, the government - get together in 'innovation platforms' where they can develop joint actions that address livestock fodder problems. Initially the project went with a traditional approach, focusing on technologies. As the process evolved, other issues came in, more actors joined the platforms, and the technologies - growing improved fodder - acted more as a catalyst for people to come together to discuss a wide range of other issues (dairying, health, etc). Fodder proved to be a useful 'engine' for the group to identify a much wider range of issues to address - along the whole value chain. He explains that this type of work facilitating <b>stakeholder</b> <b>platforms</b> is "not trivial.

40|$|Xanthomonas wilt is {{currently}} the major biotic threat to banana production in East and Central Africa (ECA). The recommended management options for the disease include destruction of infected plants, disinfecting tools used in the plantation, using clean planting materials, early removal of male buds and quarantine measures. These efforts to control the disease have produced partial success and the disease has continued to encroach into previously disease-free areas and to resurge in areas {{where it had been}} controlled. One of the major challenges to sustainable management of the disease has been poor understanding by stakeholders of the factors influencing disease spread. Current research efforts aim to provide additional information on disease epidemiology, fine tune existing cultural control practices, identify resistant and wilt escaping genotypes and develop a field detection tool. Development activities that aim at effective mobilization of stakeholders along the value chain for sustainable management of the disease (including use of farmer field schools (FFS) and learning and experimenting approaches for farmers (LEAFF)) have been evaluated and or implemented in ECA. In this paper, we discuss the different regional research and development efforts for the management of BXW. New research directions for sustainable management of BXW in ECA are suggested, including development of resistant banana cultivars through genetic engineering; exploring the potential use of endophytes as biological control agents; and studying modelling factors influencing BXW dynamics. Persistent challenges to managing BXW include: insufficient knowledge of the disease epidemiology critical for developing management strategies, inadequate mobilization and sensitization of the key <b>stakeholder</b> <b>platforms</b> along the production-consumption chain, ineffective surveillance methods leading to untimely actions, and lack of healthy BXW resistant seed. There is therefore need for continued research efforts and innovative approaches to effectively mobilize all stakeholders along the banana value chain. Peer Revie...|$|E

After a session of the the November 2010 Fodder Adoption Project (FAP) workshop in Laos, we recorded 'notes' of three world cafe hosts who collated cross-project lessons (from Ethiopia, Syria, and Vietnam) on three issues: Innovation approaches, feed assessment, and scaling out. Here Ranjitha Puskur of ILRI reports on the lessons on innovation approaches that have been tried in the project. The collective learning by the group revealed that the countries practiced diverse approaches and processes; however these approaches seem to work well {{when there is a}} good balance between technologies and the process, there are good market opportunities, and the approach is 'hybridized' with the value chains approach. She points out that these approaches are quite complex and facilitation intensive, who brokers this facilitation is a key factor that influences the outcomes.

She raised one other significant issue: monitoring and evaluation. We talk of 'innovation capacity building' as something we do in such projects, but what do we mean by this, and how do we capture the unintended benefits of projects that employ such innovation approaches?

40|$|There is {{a growing}} global concern about future water supplies. Growing demands from agriculture, {{industry}} and urban growth are streching available water supplies while pollution is undermining {{the quality of the}} resource base. Physical data available indicate that in South Africa, full utilisation of water resources has been reached and even exceeded {{in many parts of the}} country. Now looming is the complete depletion of the overall conventional water resources of the country, which is likely to occur in about 30 years should the efficiencies of water utilisation by different water user sectors not be dramatically improved. Even if a state may have expertise and resources to tackle the looming water problems, a contemporary debate rooted in the neo-liberal democratic thinking argues that the state, because of the inherent shortcomings of its traditional instruments, is not able (any more) to solely solve the economic and social problems it may identify. In order to prevent unwanted developments, it is either necessary to look for alternative instruments or to lower the aspirations of central-state control. This has resulted in trying a flexible repertoire of policy responses including democratisation of resource management. It is anticipated that democratisation of resource management would increase the range of possible solutions and consequently increase social resilience by diversifying governing capabilities. In this instance, stakeholder participation has emerged as an alternative and desirable approach to natural resource management since including civil society in the process of governance logically entails the acceptance of diversity. South Africa, like many other countries, has embraced stakeholder participation in the processes of natural resource management. The new participatory approaches however, contrast the historically simple processes of collective initiatives among more homogenous groups who shared common concerns within a familiar geographical zone. In the new resource management approaches, 'participation' has come to include complex interaction of layers of diverse actors, who make decisions over a large variety of complex ecosystems. Stakeholders participation has brought with it varying models of institutional forms and terminologies which include Participatory Natural Resource Management (NMRM), Co-Management and (Multi) <b>Stakeholder</b> <b>Platforms</b> (MSPs) and other variants - (Multi) Stakeholder Processes, (Multi) Stakeholder Partnerships, (Multi) Stakeholder Dialogues. These new institutional forms promise a considerable shift in the manner in participatory natural resources management is undertaken. Notwithstanding, Multi-Stakeholder participatory approaches are still an unknown theoretical and management territory. Little is known about the potential of establishing institutional designs based on participatory approaches at levels as high as catchments. Furthermore, water itself presents stakeholders with diverse and extreme challenges, ranging from multiple uses, seasonal and spatial variability, to drought and flood disaster situations. For this reason, this study was undertaken to examine the benefits and the challenges of pursuing Multi-Stakeholder Participatory approach in the management of water resources at catchment level. Catchment Management Forums (CMFs), in South Africa's water resource management arena, represented a form of MSPs that constituted the unit of analysis for this study. This research has taken a critical examination of the central issues relating to the emergence and operations of this version of South Africa's MSPs. The study targeted two CMFs in the historically marginalised areas of the Eastern Cape Province - the Mthatha Catchment Management Forum (Mthatha CMF) and the Kat Catchment Management Forum (Kat CMF). Using a combination of research methods and an institutional analysis approach, the study findings unearthed insights, dilemmas and possibilities of considerable relevance to the wider context of developing economies. Evidence examined in this thesis has shown that while the rationale behind MSP approach to water resource management is appealing, several factors create barriers between the ideology and grounded reality especially in developing countries. First, achieving a 'common ground' that facilitates internal collaboration and coherence among participants is highly elusive. This is attributed to the contrast that exists between the general nature of the lifeworlds of two contrasted groups of stakeholders -Organisational Stakeholders (representatives of organisations) and Community Stakeholders (representatives from community groups and villages) who are the fundamental constituents of an MSPs. The absence of a 'common ground', vividly demonstrated in one study area - Mthatha catchment, 1 ed to the absence of a shared vision, resulting in varying interpretations of the purpose of the MSP among participants. Second, the examination of the institutionalisation processes revealed that the 'institutional arrangements' as exhibited by CMFs were not appropriate for the anticipated task of these institutions. The study revealed that non-statutory MSPs were hampered by their archaic institutional arrangements, including unstructured administration, lack of mandate and absence of financial support, which rendered the management of complex water regimes that obtained at catchment level a far-fetched objective. Based on the exploration of MSPs that emerge and function as the two studied CMFs, the multi-stakeholder participatory approach is faced with daunting challenges in developing countries. Major argument being that policy formulation regarding stakeholder participation at catchment level, did not match legal and administrative requirements to support these institutions. Based on experiences from Kat catchment, which was fundamentally a community-based MSP, this thesis argues that the success for MSP approaches might lie in enabling grassroot participants to build their own institutions that handle issues according to their own priorities. These can then be further integrated horizontally and vertically into larger associations that transcend individual villages or common customs neighbourhoods to create a web-like institutional framework. The Mthatha case revealed that when confronted with multiple local stakeholders with sanctioned right to press for their needs, actors need not only a platform for dialogue, but also the mandate to act on their voices. Actors need specified property rights, sufficient funds to effect the decisions and government support to produce results...|$|E

40|$|Orchards are {{perennial}} cultures, and, {{especially in}} organic fruit production {{it is essential}} to design and manage orchards in a way which favours beneficials such as insect predators and parasitoids over pests and diseases. As landscape-dominating crops their management affects overall biodiversity in the agricultural landscape. Increasing plant biodiversity and habitats {{in such a way that}} beneficials are favoured is called Functional Agro-Biodiversity (FAB). The value of FAB for reducing pesticide use in fruit production is generally acknowledged, and many growers try to increase it. However, they lack situation-specific information about how to drive and assess biodiversity to optimize FAB. ECOORCHARD is therefore combining several approaches: (i) identifying and sharing innovative methods already implemented by fruit growers to increase FAB in EU countries; (ii) assessing simple methods for farmers to monitor FAB; (iii) quantifying the effect of FAB-boosting flower strips. The different on-farm sites, scientific trials and a web-based <b>stakeholder</b> <b>platform</b> to collect and share information are important elements to bring the collected experiences and scientific results very directly to the organic fruit growers.

40|$|Abstract—Due to the {{increasing}} security demands in mobile devices, the Trusted Computing Group (TCG) formed a dedicated Mobile Phone Working Group (MPWG) to address these security needs. MPWG recently released a Trusted Mobile Phone Reference Architecture (TCG-MPRA) specification that integrates well-known security concepts (TPM, isolation, Integrity Measurement and Verification (IMV), etc.) from the trusted PC universe, tailored for mobile phones. The business needs of the mobile phone industry mandate 4 different <b>stakeholders</b> (<b>platform</b> owners) : device manufacturer, cellular service provider, general service provider, and the end-user. The specification requires separate trusted and isolated operational domains (Trusted Engines) for each stakeholder. Although the TCG MPWG does not explicitly prescribe a specific technical realization of these trusted engines, a general consensus is use of established (Trusted) Virtualization concepts from corresponding PC architectures. However, we will demo another isolation technique specifically crafted for mobile platforms that respects their resource limitations. We achieve this goal by realizing the MPWG specification by leveraging SELinux which provides a generic domain isolation concept at the kernel level. In addition to utilizing SELinux to realize mobile phone specific (isolated) operational domains, we are also able to seamlessly integrate the important IMV concept into our SELinux-based Trusted Mobile Phone architecture. In our demo we will present a hardware prototype, representing a generic mobile phone, implementing the TCG MPWG specification. First, we will “Securely Boot” our TC-aware SELinux kernel out of a hardware Mobile Trusted Module (MTM). Next, we will show how easy and efficient we can realize the 4 isolated Trusted Engines. The value of the Trusted Engines and the fundamental IMV principle will be demonstrated through successful mitigation of two automatic Linux cell-phone worms.

40|$|Currently, {{in many of}} {{the highly}} {{productive}} lowland areas of East and South-east Asia a trend to further intensification and diversification of agricultural land use can be observed. Growing economies and urbanization also increase the claims on land and water by non-agricultural uses. As a result, decisions related to the management and planning of scarce resources become increasingly complex. Technological innovations at the field/farm level are necessary but not sufficient ¿ changes in resource use at regional scale will also be essential. To support decision-making in such situations, we advocate a multi-scale modelling approach embedded in a sound participatory process. To this end, the Integrated Resource Management and Land use Analysis (IRMLA) Project is developing an analytical framework and methods for resource use analysis and planning, for four sites in Asia. In the envisaged multi-scale approach, integration of results from field, farm, district and provincial level analysis is based on interactive multiple goal linear programming (IMGLP), farm household modelling (FHM), production ecological concepts and participatory techniques. The approach comprises the following steps: (i) inventory/quantification of current land use systems, resource availability, management practices and policy views, (ii) analysis of alternative, innovative land use systems/technologies, (iii) exploration of the opportunities and limitations to change resource use at regional scale under alternative future scenarios, (iv) modelling decision behaviour of farmers and identification of feasible policy interventions, and (v) synthesis of results from farm to regional level for negotiation of the most promising options by a <b>stakeholder</b> <b>platform.</b> In the current paper, the operationalisation of dual-scale analysis is illustrated by the outputs (development scenarios, promising policy measures and innovative production systems) from various component models for the case study Ilocos Norte, Philippines.
