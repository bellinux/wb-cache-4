25|$|Michael Faraday, in {{his essay}} The Chemical History of a Candle (1860), {{suggested}} that the raisins in <b>Snap-dragon</b> act like miniature wicks. The concept {{is similar to that}} of burning brandy on top of Christmas puddings – the brandy is burning, but is not burning at a high enough temperature to consume the raisins. Nevertheless, children often burnt their little hands or mouths playing this game, which may have led to the practice mostly dying out in the early 20th century. In some families, this tradition continues to be practiced and enjoyed even into the 21st century.|$|E
25|$|The liquid used in <b>Snap-dragon</b> was {{typically}} brandy, although similar flammable liquors {{could also be}} used. Traditionally, raisins were the treat to be snatched; William Sandys specifies Málaga raisins. Other treats, however, could also be used. Of these, almonds were the most common alternative or addition, but currants, candied fruit, figs, grapes, and plums also featured. Salt could also be sprinkled in the bowl. The low bowl {{was typically}} placed {{in the middle of}} a table to prevent damage from the inevitable splashes of burning brandy. In one variation a Christmas pudding is placed in the centre of the bowl with raisins around it.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the mid-19th}} century <b>Snap-dragon</b> was firmly entrenched as a Christmas parlour game, {{and it is in}} this sense that it is {{referenced}} in 1836, in Charles Dickens' The Pickwick Papers [...] and in 1861, in Anthony Trollope's novel Orley Farm.|$|E
2500|$|There {{were several}} other traditions {{surrounding}} {{the game of}} <b>Snap-dragon.</b> Mary F.

[...] In the short story Master Sandy's Snapdragon by Elbridge S. Brooks, <b>Snap-dragon</b> is played in the royal household of James I of England.

2500|$|The first {{reference}} to <b>Snap-dragon</b> explicitly as a parlour game is in Francis Grose's Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue (1811): [...] "Christmas gambol: raisins and almonds {{being put into}} a bowl of brandy, and the candles extinguished, the spirit is set on fire, and the company scramble for the raisins." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Snap-dragon</b> (also {{known as}} Flap-dragon, Snapdragon, or Flapdragon) was a parlour game popular from about the 16th century. It was played during the winter, {{particularly}} on Christmas Eve. Brandy was heated {{and placed in}} a wide shallow bowl; raisins were placed in the brandy which was then set alight. Typically, lights were extinguished or dimmed to increase the eerie effect of the blue flames playing across the liquor. The aim of the game was to pluck the raisins out of the burning brandy and eat them, at the risk of being burnt. Samuel Johnson's Dictionary of the English Language (1755) describes it as [...] "a play in which they catch raisins out of burning brandy and, extinguishing them by closing the mouth, eat them". According to an eighteenth-century article in Richard Steele's Tatler magazine, [...] "the wantonness of the thing was to see each other look like a demon, as we burnt ourselves, and snatched out the fruit." [...] <b>Snap-dragon</b> was played in England, Canada, and the United States, but there is insufficient evidence of the practice in Scotland, or other countries.|$|E
2500|$|The words <b>snap-dragon</b> and flap-dragon {{can refer}} to the game, the raisins used in the game, or the bowl with brandy and raisins. Other senses of flap-dragon are that of {{something}} worthless or trivial, as in [...] "A Flap-dragon for your service, Sir!" [...] from William Congreve's The Way of the World, and [...] "a contemptuous term for a Dutchman or German". In The Winter's Tale, Shakespeare {{used it as a}} verb, to describe a moment when a ship at sea is instantly swallowed up by a storm.|$|E
60|$|Kitty {{rose and}} dressed herself, {{and sat at}} the window, and watched the morning come into the garden below: first, a tremulous flush of the heavens; then a rosy light on the silvery roofs and gables; then little golden aisles among the lilacs and hollyhocks. The tiny flower-beds just under her window were left, with their <b>snap-dragons</b> and larkspurs, in dew and shadow; the small dog stood on the threshold, and barked uneasily when the bell rang in the Ursulines' Chapel, where the nuns were at matins.|$|R
2500|$|In the English play Lingua (1607) the {{practice}} is said to come from classical antiquity: [...] "when Hercules had killed the flaming dragon of Hesperia with the apples of that orchard, he made this fiery meat; in memory whereof he named it Snapdragon." [...] Brooks' Master Sandy's Snapdragon suggests another mythical origin, relating the fire of <b>snap-dragons</b> to Saint George and the dragon. Chambers suggests that it hearkens back to druidic fire-worship. According to the Oxford English Dictionary entry for flapdragon, [...] "the original sense [...] may have been identical with a dialectal sense of snapdragon, viz. a figure of a dragon's head with snapping jaws, carried about by the mummers at Christmas; but of this there is no trace in our quots".|$|R
2500|$|Snap-dragons {{were also}} {{described}} in Isaac D'Israeli's The Curiosities of Literature (17911823). [...] However, {{at this time}} it was not a parlour game but a drinking game, with the snap-dragons being [...] "small combustible bodies fired at one end and floated in a glass of liquor, which an experienced toper swallowed unharmed, while yet blazing." [...] Sandys cites a related variant of <b>Snap-dragon</b> where a lit candle end is placed in a cup of ale or cider; the aim is to quaff the liquor without singeing one's face.|$|E

60|$|The Menton inn {{was one of}} {{the rare}} {{pleasant}} corners of the old order; it was an inn of an unusual prosperity, much frequented by visitors from Shaphambury, and given to the serving of lunches and teas. It had a broad mossy bowling-green, and round about it were creeper-covered arbors amidst beds of <b>snap-dragon,</b> and hollyhock, and blue delphinium, and many such tall familiar summer flowers. These stood out against a background of laurels and holly, and above these again rose the gables of the inn and its signpost--a white-horsed George slaying the dragon--against copper beeches under the sky.|$|E
60|$|He bore {{a strange}} kind of {{appetite}} to <b>snap-dragon</b> {{and to the}} livid snuffs of a burning candle {146a}, which he would catch and swallow with an agility wonderful to conceive; and by this procedure maintained a perpetual flame in his belly, which issuing in a glowing steam from both his eyes, {{as well as his}} nostrils and his mouth, made his head appear in a dark night like the skull of an ass wherein a roguish boy hath conveyed a farthing-candle, to the terror of his Majesty's liege subjects. Therefore he made use of no other expedient to light himself home, but was wont to say that a wise man was his own lanthorn.|$|E
60|$|The schoolroom set, with Tom and Aubrey, {{came home}} soon after, and tongues went fast {{with stories of}} roast-beef, plum-pudding, and blind-man's-buff.

60|$|But {{the ghosts}} are kept {{standing}} over their flames, {{the spirit is}} becoming exhausted, and the raisins will be burnt. At <b>snap-dragon,</b> too, the ghosts here had something to do. The law {{of the game is}} this--a law on which Marian would have insisted had not the flames been so very hot--that the raisins shall become the prey of those audacious marauders only who dare to face the presence of the ghost, and to plunge their hands into the burning dish. As a rule the boys do this, clawing out the raisins, while the girls pick them up and eat them. But here at Noningsby the boys were too little to act thus as pioneers {{in the face of the}} enemy, and the raisins might have remained till the flames were burnt out, had not the beneficent ghost scattered abroad the richness of her own treasures.|$|E

60|$|And Peregrine Orme {{looked on}} from a distance, {{thinking}} of it all. That {{he should have been}} stricken dumb by the beauty of any girl was surprising even to himself; for though young and almost boyish in his manners, he had never yet feared to speak out in any presence. The tutor at his college had thought him insolent beyond parallel; and his grandfather, though he loved him for his open face and plain outspoken words, found them sometimes almost too much for him. But now he stood there looking and longing, and could not summon courage to go up and address a few words to this young girl {{even in the midst of}} their sports. Twice or thrice during the last few days he had essayed to speak to her, but his words had been dull and vapid, and to himself they had appeared childish. He was quite conscious of his own weakness. More than once, during that period of the <b>snap-dragon,</b> did he say to himself that he would descend into the lists and break a lance in that tourney; but still he did not descend, and his lance remained inglorious in its rest.|$|E
60|$|Rudimentary organs in the {{individuals}} {{of the same}} species are very liable to vary in the degree of their development and in other respects. In closely allied species, also, {{the extent to which the}} same organ has been reduced occasionally differs much. This latter fact is well exemplified in the state of the wings of female moths belonging to the same family. Rudimentary organs may be utterly aborted; and this implies, that in certain animals or plants, parts are entirely absent which analogy would lead us to expect to find in them, and which are occasionally found in monstrous individuals. Thus in most of the Scrophulariaceae the fifth stamen is utterly aborted; yet we may conclude that a fifth stamen once existed, for a rudiment of it is found in many species of the family, and this rudiment occasionally becomes perfectly developed, as may sometimes be seen in the common <b>snap-dragon.</b> In tracing the homologies of any part in different members of the same class, nothing is more common, or, in order fully to understand the relations of the parts, more useful than the discovery of rudiments. This is well shown in the drawings given by Owen of the leg bones of the horse, ox, and rhinoceros.|$|E
60|$|It lay saddest, our {{travellers}} thought, {{upon the}} little circular garden near Durham Terrace, where every brightness of fall flowers abounded,--marigold, coxcomb, <b>snap-dragon,</b> dahlia, hollyhock, and sunflower. It was a substantial and hardy efflorescence, and they fancied that fainter-hearted plants would have pined away in that garden, where the little fountain, leaping {{up into the}} joyless light, fell back again with a musical shiver. The consciousness of this latent cold, of winter only held in abeyance by the bright sun, was not deeper even in the once magnificent, now neglected Governor's Garden, where there was actually a rawness {{in the late afternoon}} air, and whither they were strolling for the view from its height, and to pay their duty to the obelisk raised there to the common fame of Wolfe and Montcalm. The sounding Latin inscription celebrates the royal governor-general who erected it almost as much as the heroes to whom it was raised; but these spectators did not begrudge the space given to his praise, for so fine a thought merited praise. It enforced again the idea of a kind posthumous friendship between Wolfe and Montcalm, which gives their memory its rare distinction, and unites them, who fell in fight against each other, as closely as if they had both died for the same cause.|$|E
60|$|It was a {{pleasant}} thing to see Mr. Pickwick in {{the centre of the}} group, now pulled this way, and then that, and first kissed on the chin, and then on the nose, and then on the spectacles, and to hear the peals of laughter which were raised on every side; but it was a still more pleasant thing to see Mr. Pickwick, blinded shortly afterwards with a silk handkerchief, falling up against the wall, and scrambling into corners, and going through all the mysteries of blind-man's buff, with the utmost relish for the game, until at last he caught one of the poor relations, and then had to evade the blind-man himself, which he did with a nimbleness and agility that elicited the admiration and applause of all beholders. The poor relations caught the people who they thought would like it, and, when the game flagged, got caught themselves. When they all tired of blind-man's buff, there was a great game at <b>snap-dragon,</b> and when fingers enough were burned with that, and all the raisins were gone, they sat down by the huge fire of blazing logs to a substantial supper, and a mighty bowl of wassail, something smaller than an ordinary wash-house copper, in which the hot apples were hissing and bubbling with a rich look, and a jolly sound, that were perfectly irresistible.|$|E
60|$|I will briefly mention {{some other}} cases of bud-variation {{to show how}} many plants {{belonging}} to many orders have varied in their flowers; and many others might be added. I have seen on a <b>snap-dragon</b> (Antirrhinum majus) white, pink, and striped flowers on the same plant, and branches with striped flowers on a red-coloured variety. On a double stock (Matthiola incana) I have seen a branch bearing single flowers; and on a dingy-purple double variety of the wall-flower (Cheiranthus cheiri), a branch which had reverted to the ordinary copper colour. On other branches of the same plant, some flowers were exactly divided across the middle, one half being purple and the other coppery; {{but some of the}} smaller petals towards the centre of these same flowers were purple longitudinally streaked with coppery colour, or coppery streaked with purple. A Cyclamen (11/55. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1867 page 235.) has been observed to bear white and pink flowers of two forms, the one resembling the Persicum strain, and the other the Coum strain. Oenothera biennis has been seen (11/56. Gartner 'Bastarderzeugung' s. 305.) bearing flowers of three different colours. The hybrid Gladiolus colvilii occasionally bears uniformly coloured flowers, and one case is recorded (11/57. Mr. D. Beaton in 'Cottage Gardener' 1860 page 250.) of all the flowers on a plant thus changing colour. A Fuchsia has been seen (11/58. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1850 page 536.) bearing two kinds of flowers. Mirabilis jalapa is eminently sportive, sometimes bearing on the same root pure red, yellow, and white flowers, and others striped with various combinations of these three colours. (11/59. Braun 'Ray Soc. Bot. Mem.' 1853 page 315; Hopkirk 'Flora Anomala' page 164; Lecoq 'Geograph. Bot. de l'Europe' tome 3 1854 page 405; and 'De la Fecondation' 1862 page 303.) The plants of the Mirabilis, which bear such extraordinarily variable flowers in most, probably in all, cases, owe their origin, as shown by Prof. Lecoq, to crosses between differently coloured varieties.|$|E
