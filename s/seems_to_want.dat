25|$|Western {{criticism}} of Hu, particularly regarding human rights, exposes his hypersensitivity to social stability {{but does not}} lay as much emphasis on his fresh commitment to address China’s multi-faceted social problems. Hu’s pragmatic, non-ideological agenda had two core values—maintaining social stability to further economic development and sustaining Chinese culture to enrich national sovereignty. In domestic policy, he <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> more openness to the public on governmental functions and meetings. Recently, China's news agency published many Politburo Standing Committee meeting details. He also cancelled many events that are traditionally seen as communist extravagances, such as the lavish send-off and welcoming-back ceremonies of Chinese leaders when visiting foreign lands. Furthermore, the Chinese leadership under Hu also focused on such problems as the {{gap between rich and}} poor and uneven development between the interior and coastal regions. Both party and state seem to have moved away from a definition of development that focuses solely on GDP growth and toward a definition which includes social equality and environment effects.|$|E
25|$|In {{the years}} 2000s, Italian {{nationalism}} {{seems to have}} gained a moderate support by the society, in particular during important days such as the National Day Festa della Repubblica (Republic day) and the Anniversary of the Liberation. The President of the Republic Carlo Azeglio Ciampi has often praised patriotism among Italians by mentioning in his speeches national events including Risorgimento or Resistenza, and national symbols like the Flag of Italy and the National Anthem, although he <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> to stress self-confidence rather than nationalism. In 2011, the 150th Anniversary of Italian Unification showed a moderately renewed interest in Italian nationalism among the society. Nationalist ideologies are often present during Italian anti-globalisation protests. Today, Italian nationalism is mainly supported by right-wing political parties including Brothers of Italy-National Alliance who has gained nine seats in the Italian Parliament in the last general election, and by far-right-wing political parties like The Right or Tricolour Flame. Nonetheless, in recent times Italian nationalism has been occasionally embraced {{as a form of}} banal nationalism by liberal parties like Forza Italia, centrist parties like the Union of the Centre or even by centre-left parties like the Democratic Party.|$|E

500|$|However, the {{response}} was not exclusively positive. In The Independent on Sunday, columnist Lucy Ellmann criticised both what she saw as the unchanging nature of the characters and Flannery's concentration on friendship rather than family. [...] "What's in the water there anyway? These are the youngest grandparents ever seen! Nothing has changed about them since 1964 except a few grey hairs... It's quite impressive that anything emotional could be salvaged from this nine-part hop, skip and jump through the years. In fact we still hardly know these people – zooming from one decade to the next has a distancing effect," [...] she wrote of the former point. And of the latter, [...] "Peter Flannery <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> to suggest that friendships are the only cure for a life blighted by deficient parents. But all that links this ill-matched foursome in the end is history and sentimentality. The emotional centre of the writing is still in family ties." ...|$|E
500|$|On the contrary, Girlschool's {{change of}} musical style in 1984 and their sudden predilection for the US market were not well {{received}} by the British press and by their fans at home. The change of attitude and image, exemplified by the music video for [...] "Running Wild" [...] on rotation on MTV, which showed the girls playing with heavy make-up, combed hair and fancy costumes, imitating a trendy American glam outfit, alienated the love of British fans, whose perception of the band was still that of roughneck companions to Motörhead, instead of competitors of Mötley Crüe and Ratt. In the time span of two years, Girlschool passed from headliner act to having serious difficulty to find a gig in the UK: [...] "Nobody <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> us in Britain anymore", confessed McAuliffe to journalist Malcolm Dome in 1984. The return of Girlschool {{to the sound of}} their beginnings came too late to win back the large fan base of their heyday and the band fell to cult status already in the late 1980s.|$|E
500|$|Kenneth Silber from Space.com {{was very}} {{negative}} towards the episode, saying, [...] "This episode conveys {{a strong sense}} of a writer, director and actors merely going through the motions, collecting their sizable paychecks while running out the clock on the season and series. The plot is not compelling, the agents themselves seem not to take it seriously, and the doppelgangers around whom the action revolves are little more than ciphers." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one star out of five. The two wrote, [...] "'Fight Club' is a marker for a series that <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> to die now, please. [...] it's tonally one of the most atypical episodes the series ever made, conceived in spite and self-loathing and sheer exhaustion." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a largely negative review and awarded it one star out of four. Vitaris criticized the use of Kathy Griffin and asserted, [...] "the guest cast {{is one of the worst}} ever. [...] Griffin [...] simply is not up to the task; she can not differentiate Betty and Lulu at all [...] and she reads every line as if she were still on her cancelled sitcom." [...] i09 reviewer Cyriaque Lama named [...] "The Kathy Griffin Twins" [...] the tenth [...] "Most Ridiculous X-Files Monsters of the Week", and derided her performance as the Templeton twins. In 2016, in a ranking of all episodes of the series from best to worst, Vulture.com named [...] "Fight Club" [...] the worst episode of the series.|$|E

2500|$|Loneliness, if only as {{representing}} {{a lack of}} communication, is recurrent through Lain.

2500|$|Prentiss and McCabe {{often find}} {{themselves}} working on behalf of two rival clients, {{one of whom is}} often the shadier side of the Labour Government, often called their [...] "Downing Street Retainer". This is usually something of an inconvenience as Prentiss is met by Archie Hilditch (Tony Gardner, Alex Lowe), a faceless member of the Government, in a deserted location (such as Frank Dobson's campaign headquarters), and told he needs to ruin the popularity of the organisation that he has spent half the programme building up. For example, in one episode they're employed by the government to increase the popularity of the European Union, while also being employed by the Eurosceptic newspaper The Sun to increase sales. It is probably a good thing in the end, as the firm relies on these payments since neither Prentiss nor McCabe <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> to do any real work.|$|E
2500|$|Dirk de Vos {{suggests}} that van der Weyden wished to evoke a life sized, carved relief filled with polychrome figures, and thus elevate his painting {{to the level}} of grand scale sculpture. The work's corners are filled with carved gilded tracery, with the presentation of living figures on a stage intended as a tableau vivant, or sculptural group, the latter of which is created through the sense of condensed movement within a single instant. Mary faints and is supported by St John who rushes to her assistance. The man on the ladder lowers Christ's body is already reinforced by Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus, both of whom <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> to carry it {{to the right of the}} pictorial space. Nicodemus's movement transforms the weeping Magdalene into a statue frozen in time. De Vos writes: [...] "Time seems to have solidified into a composition. And what a composition. Interplay of undulating lines, swaying poses and counterposes of figures have rightly been compared to technique of counterpoint in polyphonic music." ...|$|E
2500|$|These two poets {{have often}} been {{compared}} to each other. [...] To some extent this is because they were good friends and slightly older {{than most of the}} other leading members of their generation, as well as sharing similar career-paths, but they also seemed to share a similar approach to poetry. [...] Their poems often have a rarefied quality and tend not to deal with [...] "particulars", readily identifiable people and places. [...] However, they did differ in many respects as exemplified by the titles they gave to their published lectures on Spanish poetry. [...] At Johns Hopkins, Salinas published a collection called Reality and the Poet in Spanish Poetry, whereas Guillén’s Norton lectures were called Language and Poetry. [...] Both devoted single lectures to Góngora and San Juan de la Cruz and the comparisons between them are instructive. [...] Salinas <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> to show us the poetic reality behind or beyond appearances, to educate us into how to see whereas Guillén gives us an account of the thoughts and sense-impressions going through his own mind: [...] the reader is a viewer of this process not a participant in it. [...] Vicente Aleixandre recalled visiting Salinas and finding him at his desk with his daughter on one knee and his son on the other and stretching out a hand clutching a pen to shake hands with his visitor. [...] Although he was also devoted to his family, Guillén probably worked in a secluded study.|$|E

2500|$|Barnes's verse play The Antiphon (1958) {{is set in}} England in 1939. Jeremy Hobbs, in {{disguise}} as Jack Blow, has brought his family together at their ruined ancestral home, Burley Hall. His motive is never explicitly stated, but he <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> to provoke a confrontation {{among the members of}} his family and force them to confront the truth about their past. His sister Miranda is a stage actress, now [...] "out of patron and of money"; her materialistic brothers, Elisha and Dudley, see her as a threat to their financial well-being. Elisha and Dudley accuse their mother Augusta of complicity with their abusive father Titus Hobbs. They take advantage of Jeremy's absence to don animal masks and assault both women, making cruel and sexually suggestive remarks; Augusta treats this attack as a game. Jeremy returns with a doll house, a miniature version of the house in America where the children grew up. As she examines it, he charges her with making herself [...] "a madam by submission," [...] since she failed to prevent Titus from orchestrating Miranda's rape by [...] "a travelling Cockney thrice [...] age." [...] The last act finds Miranda and Augusta alone together. Augusta, at once disapproving and envious of her daughter's more liberated life, exchanges clothes with her daughter and wants to pretend she is young again, but Miranda refuses to enter into this play. When Augusta hears Elisha and Dudley driving away, she blames Miranda for their abandonment and beats her to death with a curfew bell, falling dead at her side from the exertion.|$|E
