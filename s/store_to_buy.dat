She was connected to the Carmen Del Estrada case by the killer's MO: a rope with a bamboo stick attached was found around her neck.|$|E
25|$|Many {{countries}} have a smoking age. In many countries, including the United States, most European Union member states, New Zealand, Canada, South Africa, Israel, India, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica and Australia, {{it is illegal}} to sell tobacco products to minors and in the Netherlands, Austria, Belgium, Denmark and South Africa {{it is illegal to}} sell tobacco products to people under the age of 16. On 1 September 2007 the minimum age to buy tobacco products in Germany rose from 16 to 18, {{as well as in the}} United Kingdom where on 1 October 2007 it rose from 16 to 18. Underlying such laws is the belief that people should make an informed decision regarding the risks of tobacco use. These laws have a lax enforcement in some nations and states. In China, Turkey, and many other countries usually a child will have little problem buying tobacco products, because they are often told to go to the <b>store</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> tobacco for their parents.|$|E

500|$|The SCLC's {{goals were}} {{to fill the}} jails with protesters to force the city {{government}} to negotiate as demonstrations continued. However, not enough people were arrested to affect {{the functioning of the}} city and the wisdom of the plans were being questioned in the black community. The editor of The Birmingham World, the city's black newspaper, called the direct actions by the demonstrators [...] "wasteful and worthless", and urged black citizens to use the courts to change the city's racist policies. Most white residents of Birmingham expressed shock at the demonstrations. White religious leaders denounced King and the other organizers, saying that [...] "a cause should be pressed in the courts and the negotiations among local leaders, and not in the streets". Some white Birmingham residents were supportive as the boycott continued. When one black woman entered Loveman's department <b>store</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> her children Easter shoes, a white saleswoman said to her, [...] "Negro, ain't you ashamed of yourself, your people out there on the street getting put in jail and you in here spending money and I'm not going to sell you any, you'll have to go some other place."

2500|$|Fox {{initially}} {{had doubts}} if Star Wars would emerge successful. The Other Side of Midnight {{was supposed to}} be the studio's big summer hit, while Lucas' movie was considered the [...] "B track" [...] for theater owners nationwide. While Fox requested Mann's Chinese Theatre, the studio promised that the film only needed two weeks. Fearing that the film would fail, Lucas had made plans to be in Hawaii with his wife Marcia. Having forgotten that the film would open that day, he spent most of Wednesday in a sound studio in Los Angeles. When Lucas went out for lunch with Marcia, they encountered a long line of people along the sidewalks leading to Mann's Chinese Theatre, waiting to see Star Wars. He was still skeptical of the film's success despite Ladd and the studio's enthusiastic reports. While in Hawaii, it was not until he watched Walter Cronkite discuss the gigantic crowds for Star Wars on the CBS Evening News that Lucas realized he had become very wealthy (Francis Ford Coppola, who needed money to finish Apocalypse Now, sent a telegram to Lucas's hotel asking for funding). Even technical crew members, such as model makers, were asked for autographs, and cast members became instant household names; when Ford visited a record <b>store</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> an album, enthusiastic fans tore half his shirt off.|$|E

David gradually built this inheritance into his own much larger inventory of plantations. He eventually owned 25 plantations, which included Homewood, Lansdowne, and Buena Vista. Consequently, David Hunt became one of the twelve millionaires in the Natchez area in the antebellum era.|$|R

He hired salesmen and delivery drivers to service on the wholesale accounts, and purchased horses and wagons to make deliveries. By 1888, Sexton decided to close his four retail stores and focus solely on his Chicago wholesale customers. He expanded the State Street store by renting {{the rest of the}} building.|$|R

5000|$|OVAs {{originated}} {{during the}} early 1980s. As the VCR became a widespread fixture in Japanese homes the Japanese anime industry grew to behemoth proportions. Demand for anime became massive, {{so much so that}} consumers would willingly go directly <b>to</b> video <b>stores</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> new animation outright. While people in the United States use the phrase [...] "direct-to-video" [...] as a pejorative for works that could not make it onto television or movie screens, in Japan the demand was so great that direct-to-video became a necessity. Many popular and influential series such as Bubblegum Crisis (1987-1991) and Tenchi Muyo! (1992-2005) were released directly to video as OVAs.|$|R
