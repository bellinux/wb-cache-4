5|$|Félix Trinidad {{was born}} in Fajardo, Puerto Rico, to a Puerto Rican family. During his {{childhood}} {{the family moved to}} Cupey Alto, a subdivision of San Juan, Puerto Rico, where he grew up. His future wife, Sharon Santiago, lived in Cupey and first met Trinidad in the home of her neighborhood friend, a classmate of Trinidad's. Trinidad pursued a relationship with Santiago, including an attempt to impress her with his red Ford Mustang. He continued to press for her affection and, with the help of Santiago's neighbor, Trinidad was able to win her over. Early on, Santiago's mother thought that Trinidad was related to her daughter's friend, but <b>she</b> <b>realized</b> <b>the</b> true situation when she visited the friend's house and he acted nervous in her presence. Santiago's father objected to the relationship because Trinidad was an athlete; at the time many athletes had a negative public image. Santiago became rebellious, but Trinidad eventually won her family's trust. The couple was married four years after they began dating and have had four daughters. Trinidad has a fifth daughter, named Alondra Nicole, from another relationship.|$|E
25|$|The Ingham, under Captain Ezekiel Jones, was {{dispatched}} to the Texas coast to monitor the situation and on 14 June, near Brazos Santiago, Montezuma fired on Ingham and the fire was returned. There is some discrepancy {{as to whether the}} Mexican warship was trying to evade battle once <b>she</b> <b>realized</b> <b>the</b> identity of the ship she had fired on, but Captain Jones did not allow Montezuma to evade the battle. Eventually the Mexican schooner ran aground and Ingham broke off the battle, having fired 13 guns. These became the first conflict between Mexican and United States forces and are considered by some historians as the first broadside of the Texas Revolution. The following day General Martin Cos ordered the release of the Marthas passengers.|$|E

In 1977 she formed L'Association Thailandaise des Professeurs de Francais (The Association of Thai Professors Teaching French Language) {{to act as}} the center for meeting and exchanging experiences of – and improving – the teaching of French language in Mattayom and university classes. She was President of the association between 1977 and 1981, when she became its honorary president {{for the rest of}} her life. Her assistance to the association took many forms, including in publishing journals to distribute the latest knowledge, writing her own articles in journals, and supporting teachers' seminars, research abroad and study in higher education.|$|E

"A Dream" [...] {{was one of}} the few {{songs in}} which DeBarge member, sister Bunny DeBarge played a role as both its {{songwriter}} and its lead vocalist while her four brothers (Mark, Randy, El and James DeBarge) sung in the background. The song talked of a woman's dose of reality when <b>she</b> <b>realizes</b> <b>the</b> happiness <b>she</b> thought she felt with a suitor wasn't real, recalling how at one point she and her lover [...] "danced to a melody" [...] of a song, then when [...] "the music stops", <b>she</b> <b>realizes</b> <b>the</b> dream is [...] "haunting (her) again".|$|R

500|$|After the wedding, Cane {{recalled}} {{a phone call}} he had with his [...] "Uncle Langley" [...] regarding their con with Jill and Katherine. Afterward, Langley was revealed to be the long deceased Phillip Chancellor III in June 2009; Cane was in fact not Jill's son but someone hired by Phillip. Lily and Cane separated upon this revelation, but soon reunited upon her diagnosis with ovarian cancer. Her uterus was taken out during surgery, but the doctors were able to harvest two of her eggs; they decided {{to start a family}} with Mackenzie Browning (Clementine Ford) acting as their surrogate mother. Browning became pregnant with twins. Afterward, an immigration officer arrested Cane and planned to deport him, as he was not truly Phillip. Since he was present for the birth of his children, Charlie and Mattie in June 2010 and helped Lily overcome cancer he was not deported. Cane was then blackmailed by the crime family he turned to in Australia, and embezzled money from Tucker McCall's (Stephen Nichols) company with the help of Sofia Dupre (Julia Pace Mitchell). Cane's biological father, Colin Atkinson (Tristan Rogers), then came to Genoa City in December 2010 to help Blake Joseph blackmail Cane. Colin then became engaged to Jill much to Cane's dismay. Cane then tried to stop their wedding but was shot in the chest by Blake on the church steps; he died afterward, leaving Lily devastated. Lily then began believing she was receiving afterlife messages from Cane and sought professional help. After seeing Cane several times, Lily realized he wasn't a figment of her imagination; it was then revealed in May 2011 that the man shot at the church wasn't Cane, but his identical twin brother, Caleb, who was scheming with Colin to kidnap Charlie and Mattie. However, Cane continued to act as Caleb to stop the plot with Colin and later his mother, Genevieve (Genie Francis). When Lily found out about the entire conspiracy, she refused to forgive Cane and divorced him. After Colin tried to kidnap her children, Lily began to forgive Cane and let him protect her. When Cane threatened to return to Australia, Lily let him back into her life. Later, they reunited when <b>she</b> <b>realized</b> <b>the</b> cause of all the secrets: to take down Colin. Cane proposed to her again and they married in Provence, France in February 2012. Genevieve stays in town, and Cane constantly rejects her for everything she has done. Cane and Lily then go to work at Jabot Cosmetics, where Cane is interim CEO. Tyler Michaelson (Redaric Williams) becomes smitten with Lily and the two develop an attraction, making Cane jealous. Lily and Tyler share a kiss, but she turns him down and returns to Cane.|$|E
2500|$|<b>She</b> <b>realized</b> <b>the</b> {{need for}} the {{establishment}} of laws. Some argue that Catherine used the Enlightenment as a way of placing [...] "her rule on firm philosophic foundations and providing a national guide for the moral leadership of Europe." [...] Others say she used her laws for purely practical reasons. She established a civil law code in January 1774 and a criminal code {{during the second half of}} the 1770s, but never finished a unitary code. [...] She drew heavily in the Nakaz from the latest continental jurisprudence but ignored references to natural law.|$|E
2500|$|Moulton's {{imagination}} was fostered {{during her}} childhood. Her parents {{clung to the}} strictest Calvinistic principles. Games, dances, romances, were forbidden; and, as playmates were few, the child lived {{in a world of}} fancy. [...] "I was lonely," [...] she said, [...] "and I sought companions. What was there to do but to create them?" [...] Indeed, before she was eight years old, her active mind was creating a world of its own in a little unwritten play, which it pleased her fancy to call a Spanish drama, and with which she spent all summer, filling it with personages. The rigid Calvinism of the family had undoubtedly a very stimulating effect on the emotions of the sensitive child, and to its far-reaching influence may be ascribed the tinge of melancholy found in many of her pages. As a child, Moulton also exhibited a great vitality, especially when she was not burdened with the terrors of [...] "damnation". Running {{in the face of a}} great wind was one of her joys, and <b>she</b> <b>realized</b> <b>the</b> reverse of such emotion in listening to the sound of the wind through an outer keyhole, which seemed to her the calling of trumpets, the crying of lost souls.|$|E

2500|$|It {{eventually}} became {{too difficult for}} Krasner to support herself as a waitress due to the Great Depression. In order to provide for herself, she joined the Works Progress Administration's Federal Art Project in 1935. She worked on the mural division {{as an assistant to}} Max Spivak. Her job was to enlarge other artists' designs for large-scaled public murals. Since murals were created to be easily understood and appreciated by the general public, the abstract art Krasner produced was undesirable for murals. While Krasner was happy to have a job, she was dissatisfied since she did not like working with [...] figurative images created by other artists. Throughout the late 1930s and early 1940s, she created gouache sketches in the hopes of one day creating an [...] abstract mural. As soon as one of her proposals for a mural was approved for the WYNC radio station, the Works Progress Administration turned into [...] War Services and all art had to be created for war propaganda. She continued working for War Services by creating collages for the war effort which were displayed in the windows of nineteen department stores in Brooklyn and Manhattan.> She was very involved with the Artists Union during her employment with the WPA but {{was one of the first}} to quit the organization when <b>she</b> <b>realized</b> <b>the</b> communists were taking it over. By being part of this organization, she was able to meet more artists in New York City and enlarge her network.|$|E
