5000|$|The {{principle}} {{behind the}} <b>fuse</b> <b>plug</b> {{is that the}} majority of water that overflows a dam's spillway can be safely dammed except in high flood conditions. The <b>fuse</b> <b>plug</b> may be a sand-filled container, a steel structure or a concrete block. Under normal flow conditions the water will spill over the <b>fuse</b> <b>plug</b> and down the spillway. In high flood conditions, where the water velocity may be so high that the dam itself may be put in danger, the <b>fuse</b> <b>plug</b> simply washes away, and the flood waters safely spill over the dam.|$|R
50|$|In an {{intermediate}} type, normal level {{regulation of the}} reservoir {{is controlled by the}} mechanical gates. If inflow to the reservoir exceeds the gate's capacity, an artificial channel called either an auxiliary or emergency spillway that is blocked by a <b>fuse</b> <b>plug</b> dike will operate. The <b>fuse</b> <b>plug</b> is designed to over-top and wash out in case of a large flood, greater than the discharge capacity of the spillway gates. Although it may take many months to restore the <b>fuse</b> <b>plug</b> and channel after such an operation, the total damage and cost to repair is less than if the main water-retaining structures had been overtopped. The <b>fuse</b> <b>plug</b> concept is used where it would be very costly to build a spillway with capacity for the probable maximum flood.|$|R

30|$|The {{importance}} of floodplain constriction by bridge structures is fairly well understood and various works have investigated these effects or calculated bridge scour at abutments in the floodplain (Kouchakzadeh and Townsend 1997). Additionally, {{there have been}} studies which describe the use of <b>fuse</b> <b>plugs</b> for flood mitigation (Jaffe and Sanders 2001; Pugh 1985; Schmocker et al. 2013). <b>Fuse</b> <b>plugs</b> allow access to floodplains during high flow events, {{and work on the}} assumption that increased floodplain access will result in non-local attenuation, i.e. attenuation of the flood wave away from the <b>fuse</b> <b>plug.</b> However, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, prior research investigating the impacts of floodplain constriction (other than bridge structure constriction) on scour has not been published.

5000|$|The Electrical Installations Committee {{which was}} convened in 1942 {{as part of}} the Post War Building Studies {{programme}} determined, amongst other things, that the ring final circuit offered a more efficient and lower cost system which would safely support a greater number of sockets.
