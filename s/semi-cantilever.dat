25|$|A cabin {{monoplane}} of <b>semi-cantilever,</b> high-wing configuration, the TS-1 {{was designed}} to minimise the use of strategic materials, utilising mostly wood {{in the construction of}} its remarkably streamlined airframe, and being powered by two readily available Shvetsov M-11 radial engines. Parts of the Lavochkin La-5 aircraft were also used, along with undercarriage parts from the Ilyushin Il-2. The aircraft was equipped with a fixed, conventional taildragger undercarriage, and a twin-fin tail was also utilised.|$|E
2500|$|The wing was {{a fabric}} covered <b>semi-cantilever</b> braced with steel tube struts, and had solid spruce spars and stamped Alclad ribs with Alclad sheet wrapped over leading edge. A fuel tank is mounted within each wing near the root. Rudder and {{elevators}} were welded chrome-moly steel tubing. 116" [...] track undercarriage is fitted with oleo-pneumatic shock obsorbers and Bendix brakes, and is braced {{to the front}} struts and lower longerons.|$|E
2500|$|The 160 was a high-wing monoplane. [...] The wing was a <b>semi-cantilever</b> structure, {{with two}} {{parallel}} bracing struts {{on each side}} from the lower fuselage to the wing just inside the central engines, straight-edged in plan with taper on the trailing edge only and rounded tips. It was fitted with interconnected Handley Page slots and ailerons as well as split flaps. It was powered by six four-cylinder inverted inline air-cooled Train 4T engines, each producing [...] driving three blade, variable-pitch propellers. The engines were mounted on the wing underside, housed in long, narrow cowlings intended to mimic those around the [...] Hispano-Suiza 12Ydrs water-cooled V-12 engines of the full scale aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|Both types were corrugated-aluminium-skinned in the Junkers style. [...] The high wings were <b>semi-cantilevers,</b> {{unsupported}} {{apart from}} pairs of parallel struts from the fuselage bottom {{edge to the}} wing close to the fuselage. The main legs of the fixed, tailwheel undercarriage were attached at the same wing points as the struts and joined laterally by inverted V bracing. [...] The fuselage was flat-sided, with wide windows to the passenger cabin under the wing. [...] This was accessed via a portside door, aft {{of which was a}} smaller door into a baggage compartment. The two crew members sat in a cabin in front of the wings, accessed by a rooftop hatch. [...] The tail was conventional, with a braced tailplane.|$|R
2500|$|The V59 and V61 {{were both}} twin float seaplanes, {{essentially}} identical {{apart from their}} engines and designed to carry four or five passengers. The V59 was powered by a [...] BMW IV 6-cylinder water cooled inline and the V61 by a much more powerful, [...] Bristol Jupiter 9-cylinder radial. They were metal aircraft both in frame and covering, low wing monoplanes of the <b>semi-cantilever</b> kind with external bracing between the upper fuselage and wing and further support from below via the flat topped floats. The wings were straight tapered with rounded tips. [...] The fuselage was flat sided and bottomed, with windows down the side and with a braced tailplane mounted on top of it. [...] The rudder extended well below the keel.|$|E
2500|$|Thanks to its sturdy {{wing and}} thin airfoil section, the D.XII {{maintained}} the excellent high-speed dive {{characteristics of the}} earlier Pfalz D.III. Like most contemporary fighters, however, the D.XII had an abrupt stall and a pronounced tendency to spin. Furthermore, pilots consistently criticized the D.XII for its long takeoff run, heavy controls, and [...] "clumsy" [...] handling qualities in the air. Rate of roll, in particular, {{appears to have been}} deficient. [...] Landings were difficult because the D.XII tended to float above the ground and the landing gear was weak. Ground crews disliked the extensive wire bracing of the two-bay wings, which required more maintenance than the Fokker D.VII's <b>semi-cantilever</b> wings. Evaluations of captured aircraft by Allied pilots were similarly unfavorable.|$|E
2500|$|The 161 was an {{all-metal}} monoplane with a high, <b>semi-cantilever</b> wing, braced on {{each side}} {{by a pair of}} parallel struts between the lower fuselage and the wing near the first outboard engine. The engines were mounted on a constant chord central section but the outer panels were tapered, with ailerons interconnected to Handley Page slots near the wing tips. [...] The trailing edges carried split flaps. [...] The flying boat's wing stabilizing floats retracted vertically to the outer engine cowlings. [...] The tail unit was of the twin endplate fin type with the tailplane, mounted with marked dihedral, on a fuselage pedestal and externally braced from below. The D-shaped fins were fixed to the tailplane a little below their horizontal mid-lines and were also lightly braced, with struts between them and the upper tailplane surfaces.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the full}} company name (Rohrbach Metall-Flugzeugbau) makes clear, all Rohrbach {{aircraft}} were all-metal, including their duralumin skinning. The Robbe was a monoplane {{with a high}} wing described {{at the time as}} a <b>semi-cantilever</b> structure, meaning that there were no rigid wing struts but that it retained external bracing with flying wires to the wings from the lower fuselage. The wings were mounted with 5Â° of dihedral. In plan they were straight tapered, with unswept leading edges and blunt tips. Internally the wings were built around single box spars, assisted by leading edge and trailing edge boxes. The edge boxes also served as fuel tanks. At this time there were still doubts about the repairability of metal aircraft, so the Robbe's two-part wing was designed to be easy to inspect internally by the removal of the edge boxes and all parts were replaceable. [...] The wing skin was riveted to the ribs.|$|E
2500|$|The all-wood Handasyde was a high-wing <b>semi-cantilever</b> monoplane, with parallel-chord wings {{that had}} {{slightly}} tapered tips. [...] The wings were built up around two spars {{and covered with}} 1mm plywood from the rear spar at mid-chord forward; on each side a lift strut linked the wing at about 1/3 span to the fuselage lower longeron. [...] The wing was then fabric covered, with a wire-supported scalloped trailing edge. It carried narrow ailerons outboard. [...] The fuselage was rectangular in cross section, tapering more in elevation than in plan. [...] There were no fixed stabilisers at the rear, only an all moving rudder and undivided elevator. [...] Both these surfaces were hinged to provide aerodynamic balance. [...] The single cockpit was over the wing and towards the trailing edge, with some instruments built into the wing surface. Ahead of the wing the fuselage was short, with the air-cooled 750 cc Douglas flat-twin driving a two-bladed propeller. [...] The diminutive undercarriage had thin and small diameter wheels (12 in or 305mm) on a single axle mounted on short vertical extensions from the lower longerons.|$|E
2500|$|Like the H.P.17 it used a D.H.9A engine, {{fuselage}} and empennage, but {{fitted with}} {{an entirely new}} wing. [...] The H.P.20 was a high-wing monoplane, using a thick wing with a straight leading edge but taper on the trailing edge. [...] It was a <b>semi-cantilever</b> structure bolted to a small cabane on the fuselage and braced to the lower fuselage longerons {{with a pair of}} steeply rising struts on each side. The heaviness of early cantilever wing structures is shown by a comparison of the loaded weight of the H.P.20 (6,500lb) with that of the loaded standard biplane DH.9A (4,645lb including fuel for over 5 hours of flight and a 460lb bomb load). The undersurface was flat and the front edge cropped to allow the full span slats, when closed, to form the true leading edge. [...] The slats were hinged ahead of the wing and at their leading edges; their rotation formed the slots. In addition, slots opened in front of the ailerons when they were lowered. [...] This was done via a groove in the wing {{just in front of the}} aileron hinge, narrowing towards the top surface.|$|E
2500|$|The Prefect, {{like the}} Grunau Baby, was a single-seat fabric-covered wooden glider. It had {{high-mounted}} <b>semi-cantilever</b> straight-tapered wings, {{with a single}} wing bracing strut on each side, {{from the base of}} the fuselage to the wing spar. The span was 150mm (6in) greater than that of the Grunau Baby, and the tips enclosed the outer ends of the ailerons. Mid-chord airbrakes were fitted just outboard of the wing strut ends, extending above and below the wing. The fuselage was flat sided, and tapered from the trailing edge of the wing to a very small fin bearing a large, aerodynamically-balanced and slightly reshaped rudder that extended down to the keel. The straight-tipped tailplane, mounted on the top of the fuselage and braced from below, had a strongly swept leading edge and was placed with its trailing edge at the fin's leading edge, so that the elevators lacked the large cut out for rudder movement seen on the earlier glider. The open cockpit was better enclosed at the sides and had a small windscreen; for access, the cockpit sides and windscreen were removed as a single piece. [...] Slingsby also added a [...] single-wheel undercarriage in addition to the earlier nose skid, placed below mid-chord.|$|E
50|$|The Do X was a <b>semi-cantilever</b> monoplane. The Do X had an all-duralumin hull, {{with wings}} {{composed}} of a steel-reinforced duralumin framework covered in heavy linen fabric, covered with aluminum paint.|$|E
50|$|The Timm T-840, a {{development}} of the unbuilt but similar T-800 was an advanced design for its day, featuring a tricycle undercarriage and <b>semi-cantilever</b> high wing for easy access, together {{with a combination of}} Handley Page slots with slotted flaps and ailerons.|$|E
50|$|As per the Me 321, the Me 323 had massive, <b>semi-cantilever,</b> {{high-mounted}} wings {{which were}} braced from the fuselage {{out to the}} middle of the wing. To reduce weight and to save on aluminum, much of the wing was made of plywood and fabric, while the fuselage was of metal tube construction with wooden spars and covered with doped fabric, with heavy bracing in the floor to support the payload.|$|E

50|$|The Koolhoven F.K.48 was an {{airliner}} {{built in the}} Netherlands in 1934 for KLM. It was a conventional, <b>semi-cantilever</b> high-wing monoplane, powered by two engines mounted on the wing leading edges. The undercarriage was of fixed, tailskid type with divided main units. The fuselage was of welded steel tube construction, covered in fabric, which was oval in cross section at the nose, transitioning to a rectangular cross-section for the passenger cabin. The wings were wooden structures skinned in plywood.|$|E
50|$|The Phi-Phi was an all wood parasol monoplane. Its wing {{section was}} {{thick enough to}} allow for <b>semi-cantilever</b> construction, {{supported}} centrally by two pairs of cabane struts and two steeply rising lift struts from the lower fuselage longerons, though there were a pair of drag wires from nose to wing tip. The wing plan was unusual compared with the straight edges of most of its competitors, with a gently curving leading edge, elliptical tips and straight trailing edge. It had the highest aspect ratio (13.6) of all the Itford gliders. The tip-mounted ailerons were horn balanced, again unusual.|$|E
5000|$|The {{fuselage}} {{was built}} up as a Pratt truss frame formed mainly from Duraluminum tubing and fittings with welded Chrome-moly tubing reinforcing highly stressed areas {{and covered in}} fabric.The wing was a fabric covered <b>semi-cantilever</b> braced with steel tube struts, and had solid spruce spars and stamped Alclad ribs with Alclad sheet wrapped over leading edge. A fuel tank is mounted within each wing near the root. Rudder and elevators were welded chrome-moly steel tubing. 116" [...] track undercarriage is fitted with oleo-pneumatic shock obsorbers and Bendix brakes, and is braced to the front struts and lower longerons.|$|E
50|$|In 1931, {{work began}} on a {{replacement}} for Stinson's SM-8 Junior four-seat light aircraft. The new design, the Model R, while based on the SM-8, had a shorter fuselage and a revised cabin. While the aircraft's undercarriage retained the basic tailwheel undercarriage layout of the SM-8, the split-axle mainwheels of the earlier aircraft were replaced by a <b>semi-cantilever</b> design, in which the mainwheels and shock-absorber units were enclosed in streamlined fairings attached to a short stub wing, which was also used to carry wing bracing struts. The aircraft had a fabric covered, welded steel-tube fuselage, while the wings were of mixed construction, with spruce spars and steel ribs, covered by fabric.|$|E

50|$|The A.S.39 was a high-wing, <b>semi-cantilever,</b> strut-braced (on {{the outer}} panels) {{monoplane}} with wooden wings and tail unit and an all-metal monocoque fuselage. It had a fixed, divided type landing gear and tailwheel. The observation aircraft had {{a crew of}} three: pilot, observer and radio operator. The A.S.39 had a unique crew configuration with the observer accommodated in the nose with clear-vision windows on three sides and the pilot's compartment raised to allow passage to the radio operator's compartment. Four small 130 hp Pobjoy Niagara V seven-cylinder air-cooled radial engines were mounted on the wings. This maximized propwash over the wing giving extra lift at low speed. The wings could be folded for storage when used on an aircraft carrier.|$|E

50|$|The {{fuselage}} {{was built}} around a rectangular steel tube structure. This was aluminium skinned around the engine, upper decking and extreme tail, and fabric covered over plywood elsewhere. The single cockpit was well aft of the wings and could be open or enclosed. The tailplane was wooden and plywood plus fabric covered, but the fin and control surfaces were fabric covered steel frames. The control surfaces were horn balanced and the tail plane incidence could be trimmed in flight. The fin, too, was directionally adjustable, but only on the ground. The undercarriage was fixed, with <b>semi-cantilever</b> faired legs from the leading edge stubs braced high up the legs and inwards to the fuselage bottom with faired struts. The optionally spatted wheels were oleo damped and had differential brakes. There was a sprung tailskid.|$|E

50|$|Despite the {{all-metal}} requirement, the Romano R16 initially flew with a wing {{of mixed}} construction which was originally {{built for the}} rather similar Romano R.6 civil passenger aircraft. It is not known if the intended wing, all-metal and expected to be lighter, ever replaced it. On each side the high wing was in two parts, with a rectangular inner section attached {{to the top of}} the fuselage. The outer panels were straight tapered to rounded tips. The wing had two wooden box spars and spruce ribs and was entirely plywood covered. The centre section, over 40% of the span, was braced at its outer ends with a pair of parallel steel wing struts between the wing spars and the lower fuselage longerons, so that the R.16's wing was a <b>semi-cantilever</b> one. High aspect ratio ailerons occupied the whole outer panel trailing edge and camber changing flaps filled those of the centre section.|$|E

5000|$|The Bagshot {{was built}} to Air Ministry Specification F.4/24 in December 1924. This called for a large twin-engined fighter {{aircraft}} with a crew of three (pilot and two gunners), a maximum speed of 125 mph and a landing speed of 50 mph. [...] Initially {{the details of the}} required armament were not specified. Frank Barnwell's design to meet this requirement, the Bagshot, was a high-wing all-metal monoplane with an unusual triangular-section fabric-covered steel-tube fuselage with two upper longerons and a single lower member. The pilot sat in line with the wing's leading edge, with one gun position in the nose and another just behind the wing. The two-spar wing had a steel primary structure and duralumin nose ribs and end-members, and was a <b>semi-cantilever,</b> being braced by a pair of diagonal struts on each side. The legs of the fixed undercarriage met the wing at the same place as the struts and had an axle fairing of airfoil section, contributing some lift.

40|$|Abstract. When the {{scaffold}} construction method is applied on long-span steel trussed arch bridges, reasonable {{setting of the}} temporary pier elevation has significant influence on assembly linearis and safety assembly of long-span steel trussed arch bridges with <b>semi-cantilever.</b> In this paper, {{in accordance with the}} manufacturing linearis steel trussed beam bridge and steel truss beam linearis changing during building process, the calculation of temporary pier elevation was studied systematically, and practical function was deduced. Then, the method was applied to a long-span steel trussed arch bridge. The obtained result by in-situ assembly and dismantling presents that: 50 mm preserved method is considered in this paper, which can provide convenience for removing the temporary pier. At the same time, the rationality and reliability of the presented approach are verified. It also can provide reference for similar bridge construction...|$|E
