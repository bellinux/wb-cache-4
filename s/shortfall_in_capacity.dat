5000|$|By {{the late}} 1930s {{the company was}} in {{financial}} difficulties and had shrunk to a shadow of its former self, employing only 60 workers. The company {{was in the process}} of being taken over by the Bank of California in 1940 when businessman Charles E. Moore, with the financial support of the Six Companies, took a controlling interest. Moore soon managed to contract with the US Navy for the building of some torpedo tube mounts, and shortly thereafter he secured a contract for the building of twelve triple expansion marine steam engines. [...] By 1942, with the US government's wartime Emergency Shipbuilding Program getting underway, it became clear that a large number of new marine engines would be needed to power the new ships. Since there was a <b>shortfall</b> <b>in</b> <b>capacity</b> to produce modern steam turbines, it was realized that most of the new Liberty ships would have to be fitted with older and slower reciprocating steam engines instead. Admiral Vickery contacted Moore to ask if he could double the original order of 12 engines, to which Moore is reported to have responded that it would be as easy to tool up for a hundred as for a dozen. The company was then contracted to build 118 triple expansion steam engines for the Liberty ships.|$|E
5000|$|The Netherlands {{experienced}} {{an extended period}} of decarceration from 1947 until 1974. [...] Beginning in 1975 however, this trend changed. In approximately the last thirty years since, the incarceration rate in the Netherlands has sextupled. Despite this increase, of the 155,270 sanctions imposed by Dutch courts, only 21,480 or approximately 14% resulted in unsuspended prison sentences in 2000. This data alone however may not support the assertion that the country is more punitive than in the past. Incarceration rates alone, particularly in the Netherlands, are a poor indicator of a country’s purported move towards more punitive sentencing. Measuring changes in prison capacity alone is an insufficient measure of punitiveness in the Netherlands because these numbers do not accurately represent the incarceration needs of the Dutch. Notably, in the 1970s Dutch prisons operated at full capacity. Incarceration rates were kept artificially low in this era because the Dutch declined to construct the required number of prisons to suit the demands imposed by their criminal justice system. This problem was alleviated on the front-end by dismissing three-quarters of all recorded offenses. Furthermore, there was no guarantee the convicted would ever spend any time in prison, even when prosecutors did not dismiss the offense and the offender was subsequently convicted and sentenced to prison. Individuals were still sent to prison {{even in the absence of}} capacity. To remedy this <b>shortfall</b> <b>in</b> <b>capacity,</b> the Netherlands established waitlists for prisons. If the prison incarcerated more perilous offenders than the convicted, then the convict was placed on a waitlist until their crime was deemed sufficiently severe. The reason behind these waitlists was purely practical: the Dutch simply did not have enough available space in their prisons. These waitlists were not developed for rehabilitative reasons. In fact, prison sentences were voided if the convicted spent too long on the waitlist. Over 5,000 unsuspended prison sentences were voided in 1995 alone due to a lack of space in prisons.|$|E

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{potential}} for real-time inter-modal substitution to reduce flight traffic and reduce delays in situations {{where there is a}} temporary severe <b>shortfall</b> <b>in</b> airport <b>capacity</b> or airport closure. Two schemes are discussed in this paper. One is that airlines cancel short-haul flights and rebook passengers on surface transport modes in cases when the delay savings from reduced flight traffic is greater than the costs and increased travel time associated with the surface mode. We demonstrate an optimization model that chooses which flight to cancel, and which flight to be substituted with ground transportation. As a second scheme, alternative hubs are selected among nearby airports and surface transportation links hub, alternative hub airports, and other spoke airports. Further study is needed to compare these two schemes for a real case. Zhang, Hansen 3 1...|$|R

40|$|In {{excess of}} 1, 000 million tyres are {{manufactured}} worldwide every year. The average tyre lasts for approximately 50, 000 kilometres before {{it must be}} replaced. Each year in the UK approximately 37 million tyres {{reach the end of}} their useful life. The used tyre, which is almost identical to the replacement, then requires disposal. As the volume of road traffic increases alternative disposal routes are required to take up the resulting <b>shortfall</b> <b>in</b> <b>capacity.</b> SITA Tyre Recycling operate an incinerator in the West Midlands which solely burns scrap tyres. The plant receives a significant proportion of UK scrap tyre waste stream as well as reject tyres from manufacturers. The main waste stream generated is disposed to landfill. The objective of this research was to determine if the waste had potential for recycling which would reduce the burden on landfill and possibly generate revenue through the sale of products. By developing methods to sample and characterise the waste stream it was found to consist of multiple phases that could be individually treated to generate valuable products. Products based on carbon and steel were derived from the combusted rubber and bead wire respectively. Detailed examination of the carbon phase using a range of techniques revealed that many compounds used in the manufacture of the tyre rubber were highly dispersed in a carbon dominated matrix. The success of physical separation processes was limited by the difficulties associated with liberation of the valuable carbon from contaminating elements. The post-combustion steel was found to have an unacceptable sulphur concentration, which was mainly associated with surface coatings of the carbon phase. Through the application of traditional attrition scrubbing the surface coatings were removed and a reduced sulphur content steel product generated. Pilot scale trials were used to generate large samples for industrial assessment and process optimisation purposes...|$|E

40|$|Overview The {{demand for}} amphibious {{capabilities}} in the Indo-Asia-Pacific region reflects the operational and strategic {{challenges faced by}} the U. S. Marine Corps and Australian Defence Forces. Both nations have indicated the importance of deepening their strategic partnership, yet {{there has been a}} lack of clarity around the desired outcomes for and priority among the variety of cooperative activities. Recognizing that the demand for amphibious capabilities in the Indo-Asia-Pacific region will likely continue to exceed the current capacity of any one nation, the CSIS International Security Program sought to explore the strategic and operational utility of various models for combined amphibious forces. The study first provides an overview of existing and projected ADF and USMC amphibious capability and capacity. Using data gathered from interviews with U. S. and Australian subject matter experts, the study examines two potential force options along five dimensions: range/duration, responsiveness, scale, breadth, and force protection. These options are evaluated against three mission sets varying in complexity. As the United States continues to face <b>shortfalls</b> <b>in</b> amphibious <b>capacity</b> and as Australia continues to advance its capabilities, this report provides a framework and recommendations through which to align strategic interests and advance a shared vision for combined amphibious operations...|$|R
40|$|The UK policy {{framework}} {{for the development of}} sustainable communities, dating from the late 1990 ’s, has involved substantial changes in the working practices of urban development practitioners. The achievement of sustainable outcomes requires a range of professions, organisations, groups and individuals to work towards shared goals. Thus an emphasis on multi-agency and participatory working has become an integral component of the development of sustainable communities. Initial slow progress gave rise to a review of <b>shortfalls</b> <b>in</b> institutional <b>capacity,</b> and deficits <b>in</b> the generic skills required to enable effective multi-agency working were revealed. The policy response to these perceived deficits included initiatives to provide targeted information and training resources – at both a national and regional level – to urban development professionals and communities. This paper discusses research conducted at a regional level to develop a set of on-line resources focussed on the enhancement of generic skills. The research has addressed a wide range of conceptual and practical difficulties: the nature of generic skills; the capacity of online learning to address contextual skills; and the difficulties of integrating on-line learning into everyday working practices.

40|$|The {{suitability}} of Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) {{as a source}} of peaking plant <b>capacity</b> <b>in</b> South Africa is examined in this research report. The report examines the current state of CAES technology including examples of operational and planned facilities. It further evaluates the potential challenges and benefits of the use of CAES in South Africa. A high level proposal for plant design capacity is documented, and potential costs for construction thereof are estimated. The cost of a CAES plant is compared to generating options using the Levelised Cost of Energy (LCOE) method. The study proposes that by 2018 additional peaking plant capacity will be required and that a CAES plant able to provide additional capacity up to 3 500 MW would help to alleviate the potential shortfall which may be experienced at this time. The report further proposes conversion of underground mines for use as air receivers for high pressure storage of large volumes of compressed air required for CAES. The research report concludes that CAES presents a feasible solution to the potential future <b>shortfall</b> <b>in</b> peaking plant <b>capacity</b> <b>in</b> South Africa, and that site identification and construction of a suitable storage cavern presents the main obstacle to the implementation of this technology...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. The Sacramento region {{is prone to}} flooding disasters. This thesis uses an optimization model to recommend where to preposition and/or expand warehouses, health-care personnel, ramp space, and transportation vehicle capacity. Adequate prepositioning helps evacuate the emergency population (EP), supply commodities to affected population (AP) that stays back in the affected areas (AAs), and transport other displaced population (DP) to the relief locations (RLs) for shelter. The goal is to minimize the expected number of EP and AP casualties, and then to maximize the DP transported to RL shelters, both during the first 72 hours after a flood disaster. We model a network of eight AAs and ten RLs, four flooding scenarios of different severity, and several budget levels for expansion of the initially prepositioned resources. We find that the RLs that the Federal Emergency Relief Agency (FEMA) has already selected have enough warehouse space to support the AP. This model recommends minor investment in additional health-care providers and emergency rescue vehicles for the EP. On the other hand, we observe a <b>shortfall</b> <b>in</b> mass housing <b>capacity</b> for the DP, even after fully expanding the capacity of existing facilities...|$|R
40|$|The South African {{government}} is introducing a poverty-reduction policy that will supply households with a monthly 50 kWh “Free Basic Electricity (FBE) ” subsidy. We show that FBE distorts the energy choices of poor households by {{encouraging them to}} cook with electricity, whereas alternatives such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) can deliver a similar cooking service {{at a much lower}} cost to society. An alternative energy scheme, such as providing households with clean energy credits equivalent in value to the FBE’s cost, could deliver additional energy services worth at least 6 % of total household welfare (and probably much more) at no additional public cost; those benefits are so large that they would cover the entire cost of LPG fuel needed to implement the scheme. The analysis is extremely sensitive to the coincidence of electric cooking with peak power demand on the South African grid and to assumptions regarding how South Africa will meet its looming <b>shortfall</b> <b>in</b> peak power <b>capacity.</b> One danger of FBE is that actual peak coincidence and the costs of supplying peak power could be much less favorable than we assume, and such uncertainties expose the South African power system to potentially very high costs of service...|$|R
40|$|Background: Accurate data on {{the health}} status, health {{behaviour}} and {{access to health care}} of asylum seekers is essential, but such data is lacking in many European countries. We hence aimed to: (a) develop and pilot-test an instrument {{that can be used to}} compare and benchmark the country health information systems (HIS) with respect to the ability to assess the health status and health care situation of asylum seekers and (b) present the results of that pilot for The Netherlands (NL) and Germany (DE). Materials and Methods: Reviewing and adapting existing tools, we developed a Health Information Assessment Tool on Asylum Seekers (HIATUS) with 50 items to assess HIS performance across three dimensions: (1) availability and detail of data across potential data sources; (2) HIS resources and monitoring capacity; (3) general coverage and timeliness of publications on selected indicators. We piloted HIATUS by applying the tool to the HIS in DE and NL. Two raters per country independently assessed the performance of country HIS and the inter-rater reliability was analysed by Pearson's rho and the intra-class correlation (ICC). We then applied a consensus-based group rating to obtain the final ratings which were transformed into a weighted summary score (range: 0 - 97). We assessed HIS performance by calculating total and domain-specific HIATUS scores by country as well as absolute and relative gaps in scores within and between countries. Results: In the independent rating, Pearson's rho was 0. 14 (NL) and 0. 30 (DE), the ICC yielded an estimated reliability of 0. 29 (NL) and 0. 83 (DE) respectively. In the final consensus-based rating, the total HIATUS score was 47 in NL and 15 in DE, translating into a relative gap <b>in</b> HIS <b>capacity</b> of 52 % (NL) and 85 % (DE) respectively. <b>Shortfalls</b> <b>in</b> HIS <b>capacity</b> <b>in</b> both countries relate to the areas of HIS coordination, planning and policies, and to limited coverage of specific indicators such as self-reported health, mental health, socio-economic status and health behaviour. The relative gap in the HIATUS component "data sources and availability" was much higher in Germany (92 %) than in NL (28 %). Conclusions: The standardised tool (HIATUS) proved useful for assessment of country HIS performance in two countries by consensus-based rating. HIATUS revealed substantial limitations <b>in</b> HIS <b>capacity</b> to assess the health situation of asylum seekers in both countries. The tool allowed for between-country comparisons, revealing that <b>capacities</b> were lower <b>in</b> DE relative to NL.

40|$|Implementing a new speech {{generating}} device (SGD) {{can be a}} confronting and resource-intensive {{process for}} families. Around the world <b>shortfalls</b> <b>in</b> service <b>capacity</b> compromise both {{the quality and quantity}} of in-person support that many families of children with a new SGD are able to access. In this mixed-methods study, parents’ learning needs when faced with unfamiliar SGD technology were investigated, using Jarvis’ Existential Learning Theory (2004) as a conceptual framework. Additionally, the impact of telepractice on parent learning outcomes was explored. The project presented here comprised two phases. In Phase 1 I explored 7 parents’ experiences of learning to implement SGD technology at home, and 13 speech-language pathologists’ (SLPs’) experiences of supporting this. Phase 1 data analysis revealed a range of themes concerning the experiences of support for families with a new SGD. Themes from Phase 1 were used to develop a telepractice learning and support package for families, which for Phase 2 of the study was trialled in a multiple baseline pilot (n = 3), and an additional case study. Outcome measures tracked frequency of device use at home, and also analysed SGD vocabulary output and parents’ use of aided language modelling during scheduled practice sessions. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with parents at the end of the study, to probe their opinions about the program. Quantitative outcomes from Phase 2 showed a unique profile of skill development for each family over the course of the study. The follow-up interviews with parents also highlighted the importance of personalised teaching and intervention strategies. The findings of Phases 1 and 2 fit with the diversity seen in Jarvis’ existential learning model, and emphasise the importance of taking the individual characteristics of learners into account. Results also highlighted the need for ongoing support of families with a new SGD, beyond the initial establishment period. Access is restricted to staff and students of the University of Sydney.

40|$|South Africa is {{currently}} experiencing a <b>shortfall</b> <b>in</b> electricity generation <b>capacity.</b> To fund {{the construction of}} new generation capacity, the price of electricity supplied to municipalities by Eskom will have to increase by between 24. 8 % and 25. 9 % per annum {{for the next three years}} (Creamer, 2010). This exponential increase in electrical prices will have a detrimental effect on South Africa’s economy. Solar water heaters are seen as one of the most cost effective renewable energy options available in South Africa. In view of the expected high growth in the market for solar heating equipment, an apparent lucrative opportunity exists to increase the domestic capability for the design and manufacturing of solar water heating systems or components. In the technical analysis the different solar water heating systems were investigated as well as low-cost water heating systems. Of the low-cost water heating systems the Household Water Mixer were considered the best with an annual saving of R 2149. 85. An indirect system with flat plate collectors was considered the best solar water heating system currently available on the market. The payback model revealed that this system has a payback period of 3 years. There is a lucrative opportunity to enter the solar water heating market, but it appears to be as a distributor and installer of these systems rather than the manufacturing of these systems.
