500|$|Roberts {{performed}} [...] "Yo-Yo" [...] at London's G-A-Y nightclub on 24 September 2011. She pre-recorded {{a performance}} of [...] "Yo-Yo" [...] for UK television programme The Alan Titchmarsh Show during the same taping as {{a performance of}} [...] "Lucky Day". The taping came after deciding [...] "Yo-Yo" [...] would be released as the third single from the album, with Roberts saying, [...] "I absolutely love performing Yo-Yo, it's my favourite one to do [...] <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> really close to Yo-Yo. I feel like I lose myself when I'm performing it". After {{the release of the}} single, Roberts performed on The Album Chart Show during a special dedicated to her, performing three tracks: [...] "Yo-Yo", [...] "Beat of My Drum" [...] and [...] "Sticks + Stones". Roberts also performed the song on British chat show Loose Women and on the Digital Music Awards.|$|E

500|$|Le Guin {{described}} {{coming of}} age as the main theme of the book, and wrote in a 1973 essay that she chose that theme since she was writing for an adolescent audience. She stated that [...] "Coming of age... {{is a process that}} took me many years; I finished it, so far as I ever will, at about age thirty-one; and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> rather deeply about it. So do most adolescents. It's their main occupation, in fact." [...] She also said that fantasy was best suited as a medium for describing {{coming of age}}, because exploring the subconscious was difficult using the language of [...] "rational daily life". The coming of age that Le Guin focused on included not just psychological development, but moral changes as well. Ged needs to recognize the balance between his power and his responsibility to use it well, a recognition which comes as he travels to the stone of Terrenon and sees the temptation that that power represents.|$|E
500|$|Limp Bizkit {{was leading}} ShipRocked 2015 cruise from February 2 to 6. Other bands present were Chevelle, Black Label Society, P.O.D., Sevendust among others. But some {{days before the}} event, Borland took to Instagram to express his discontent, posting a photo of his luggage with a caption reading: [...] "Can't wait to see me some roided out tribal tattooed spray tanned Jell-O shot filled bohunks do their best drunk MMA {{impressions}} in the top deck mosh pit." [...] Speaking to NME, Borland moved to clarify the comments, saying [...] "When I first read {{the description of the}} cruise I realised {{it is what it is}} and I thought I'd have some fun with it...I'll retract everything if I don't see a big muscly frat boy moshing in the pit. I think that is going to happen though <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> safe. I'm turning 40 next week and I think it's funny that I'm spending the last week of my [...] on ShipRocked. It's funny to me. It's a joke with truth in it. I just don't want our fans to get all butthurt and thinking I'm criticising them, because I'm not." ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike EastEnders, E20 uses {{incidental}} music, which Scott Matthewman of The Stage said {{makes it}} feel like an episode of Hollyoaks, a Channel 4 soap opera targeted at a teen audience. A remix of the EastEnders theme tune was created for the series, {{with members of the}} public submitting remixes in a competition held on the BBC website. The competition opened on 11 November 2009 and was officially launched on 13 November by Annie Mac on her BBC Radio 1 show. More than 250 entries were submitted. They were reduced to four and judged by Sathe, Santer, Keillor, original theme tune composer Simon May, and BBC Radio 1Xtra's DJ Ace. The winner, 21-year-old Carl Darling, was announced on 4 December 2009. He said [...] "I was very excited to hear that my track was chosen by such an eclectic judging panel. And to spend time in the BBC studios and walking around the Square was phenomenal. I have grown up hearing Simon May's original theme tune and watching Albert Square and the iconic Queen Vic, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> very privileged {{to be a part of}} EastEnders: E20 history!" [...] Darling explained that he wanted to keep all the [...] "essential features" [...] of the original theme, but to make a grimy drum and bass version.|$|E

500|$|Grey is {{the protagonist}} and {{focal point of}} the series. She has been called [...] "intelligent, compassionate, hard-working, oftentimes outspoken, easily distracted, and indecisive" [...] by Grey's Anatomy executives. Pompeo says she is unaware if her {{character}} knows how to have fun, adding: [...] "All of my scenes with [...] are the same—we're either breaking up or having sex." [...] Her personality has evolved over the past few seasons from depressed, to happy and [...] "fixed". Pompeo said to Good Morning America, [...] "I am so incredibly lucky to have Patrick , to have the chemistry that we do, we have an amazing relationship, and it's like any other relationship, you have your ups and downs. But we work it out, and we've found a way to do this for this long and still get along, and make it work and believe in what we're doing." [...] Pompeo told Entertainment Weekly: [...] "It's awkward with Patrick [...] because he's like my brother. As soon as the camera is off, I'm like, 'Is your hand on my butt?' But there are millions of girls who have been waiting for this, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> an obligation to the fans." [...] Rhimes used the dog [...] "Doc", which Meredith and Derek shared, as a metaphor of their relationship during the second season. She characterizes Grey as doing what she thinks is right: ...|$|E

"I don't put out {{a record}} every year so I can see what others are doing and learn from that and see things that are happening. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> that a good record from me never defines 2011 -- it should be totally {{timeless}} {{and be able to}} live in any era. I think I've done that with this one. It's different at times [...] but I don't think it's a huge departure from anything I've ever done. And I think my fans who have been there since Endtroducing will really like this one." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rowling has said, [...] "I've taken horrible liberties with {{folklore}} and mythology, but I'm quite unashamed about that, because British {{folklore and}} British mythology {{is a totally}} bastard mythology. You know, we've been invaded by people, we've appropriated their gods, we've taken their mythical creatures, and we've soldered them all together to make, what I would say, {{is one of the}} richest folklores in the world, because it's so varied. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> no compunction about borrowing from that freely, but adding a few things of my own." ...|$|E

Flea {{commented on the}} induction by saying, [...] "It's always been {{easy for me to}} pooh-pooh these awards– the [...] Hall of Fame too. But I inducted Metallica a couple of years ago, and it was really a beautiful thing to see as all these people were being inducted. It made me love it. I love halls of fame anyway– the Basketball Hall of Fame, the Baseball Hall of Fame. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> grateful for the recognition of what we have done and for the hope and potential of what we'll continue to do." ...|$|E
2500|$|While Kellett {{states that}} [...] "Many in {{attendance}} applaud his efforts," [...] she also provides the following qualification: [...] "But others criticize the author, claiming his book contains factual errors and misstatements. Members {{of the local}} Jewish community say it's simply one-sided." [...] She quotes Tali Ariav of the Hillel Jewish Student Center on the Iowa campus, who stated: [...] "'I am an Israeli so of course I served in the military, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> emotionally involved, but I feel every person, every American, every thinker needs to think twice about Carter's opinion, because it's not right' ..."

2500|$|Jordan Thomas, BioShock 2s {{creative}} director, {{said that}} the first concern with a sequel to BioShock was [...] "where do you go with this? How do you bring people back to an experience and terrify them and shock {{them in a way}} that they’re not expecting, but also fulfill the many expectations they’re projecting onto it?" [...] Early on, Thomas decided that it couldn't be a BioShock game without the city of Rapture, and that there were many unseen locations and untold stories that could remained with the setting. The developers wanted to bring some of the mystery back to the location of Rapture, and maintain a balance of surprising old players while introducing the setting to newcomers. Thomas and environmental artist Hogarth De La Plante agreed that the setting of Rapture was fertile ground for new ideas, and that as they were both veterans of the original game, they were excited to add never-before-seen parts of the city and push the artistic style they had developed. [...] "Any idea was out on the table at that point, and I think nobody has played BioShock more than the developers that made it, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> like in one respect we are a pretty good litmus test for whether it’s still an interesting place or not," [...] La Plante recalled. [...] "And if that doesn’t bore us and we’re the people that played it for thousands upon thousands of hours, then I think we have a pretty good perspective on how interesting that location really is." ...|$|E
