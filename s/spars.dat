5|$|At the outset, the U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, and USCG {{agreed to}} recruit and to train the members of their {{respective}} women's reserves together, using existing Navy facilities. For recruiting purposes, the <b>SPARS</b> would utilize the Offices of the Naval Officer Procurement. Their first recruiting efforts got underway in December 1942, but they were hampered somewhat {{by the absence of}} SPAR recruiting personnel. Their absence resulted from the agreement between the Navy and the USCG, whereby the <b>SPARS</b> would receive its first personnel by transfer from the WAVES. A total of 15 WAVE officers and 153 WAVE enlisted women requested and were discharged from the WAVES to become the first <b>SPARS.</b> Eventually, SPAR officers were assigned to most of the Naval Officer Procurement offices. The recruiting information about <b>SPARS</b> was disseminated with WAVES publicity materials and it was also done separately. But it became apparent that the job of selling the <b>SPARS</b> included selling the USCG as well.|$|E
5|$|In their off-duty hours, <b>SPARS</b> contributed {{time and}} effort to many {{community}} and wartime causes. Some became active nurse's aides, some rolled bandages for the Red Cross, others donated blood to blood banks, some visited service men in convalescent hospitals, and others collected gifts for the men overseas. Many of them were also involved in the March of Dimes campaigns, and war chest and war bond drives. Both officers and enlisted were awarded ribbons and medals based on their service, and some were acknowledged for their outstanding contributions to the <b>SPARS</b> and the country. In general, <b>SPARS</b> looked upon their service favorably, and many of them found a form of kinship in having {{been a part of the}} nation's military forces during wartime. With the surrender of Japan in August 1945, the USCG demobilization effort began, and the <b>SPARS</b> were gradually discharged. They were separated from the service on a point system, and on the basis of their jobs. However, many <b>SPARS</b> were reassigned to the personnel separation centers to help with demobilization (women and men reservists) and they were not separated until it was completed. The Women's Reserve of the USCG (<b>SPARS)</b> was inactivated on 25 July 1947.|$|E
5|$|The <b>SPARS</b> were {{assigned}} to every USCG district except Puerto Rico, and served in Hawaii and Alaska as well. Most officers held general duty billets, which included administrative and supervisory assignments. Other officers served as communication officers, supply officers, barracks, and recruiting officers. The bulk of the enlisted women performed clerical and stenographic duties. In smaller numbers, the enlisted personnel were found in practically every other billet, from baking pies to rigging parachutes and driving jeeps. A select group of SPAR officers and enlisted personnel were also assigned {{to work with the}} Long Range Aid to Navigation at monitoring stations in the Continental United States. Better known under the acronym LORAN, it was a top-secret radio navigation system developed for ships at sea and long-range aircraft. The first monitoring station staffed by <b>SPARS</b> was at Chatham, Massachusetts. Chatham {{is believed to have been}} (at the time) the only all female-staffed station of its kind in the world. The <b>SPARS</b> peak strength was approximately 11,000 officers and enlisted personnel. Commodore J. A. Hirschfield, USCG, said the <b>SPARS</b> volunteered for duty when their country needed them, and they did their jobs with enthusiasm, efficiency, and with a minimum of fanfare. To honor the <b>SPARS,</b> two USCG cutters were given their name.|$|E
500|$|<b>Sparring</b> {{takes three}} forms: three-step <b>sparring,</b> {{one-step}} <b>sparring,</b> and free <b>sparring.</b> Three-step <b>sparring</b> and one-step <b>sparring</b> {{are similar to}} equivalent exercises in ITF and WTF schools, but free <b>sparring</b> is different, having {{more in common with}} traditional karate <b>sparring.</b> Rhee Taekwon-Do free <b>sparring</b> is unscored, unarmoured, and usually 'non-contact' in principle.

2500|$|<b>Sparring</b> (gyeorugi 겨루기 or matseogi 맞서기) - <b>sparring</b> {{includes}} variations such as free-style <b>sparring</b> (in which competitors <b>spar</b> {{without interruption}} for several minutes); 7-, 3-, 2-, and 1-step <b>sparring</b> (in which students practice pre-arranged <b>sparring</b> combinations); and point <b>sparring</b> (in which <b>sparring</b> is interrupted and then resumed after each point is scored) ...|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} {{varieties}} of this <b>spar</b> dash such as Canterbury <b>spar,</b> sharp-dash, sharpstone dash, thrown dash, pebble stucco, Derbyshire <b>Spar,</b> Yellow <b>spar,</b> golden gravel, black and white, and also sunflower.|$|R
5|$|Although the <b>SPARS</b> {{no longer}} exist as a {{separate}} organization, the term is sometimes informally used for a female Coast Guardsman; however, {{it is not an}} officially sanctioned term.|$|E
5|$|In August 1943, {{recruiting}} {{policies were}} changed to permit <b>SPARS</b> to marry {{men of the}} USCG without having to resign. The USCG would continue to accept applicants who were married to men in the Army, Navy, or Marine Corps, but would not accept {{a woman who was}} already married to an enlisted man or an officer serving in the USCG. However, women could join the <b>SPARS</b> if their husbands were enrolled as temporary members of the reserve. In November 1943, the marriage policy with respect to recruits was changed further to permit women who were wives of cadets, warrant officers, or enlisted men of the USCG to enlist or be commissioned in the <b>SPARs.</b> The ban remained on women whose husbands were commissioned officers in the USCG with the rank of ensign or above.|$|E
5|$|The United States Coast Guard (USCG) Women's Reserve, {{better known}} by the acronym <b>SPARS,</b> was the World War II women's branch of the USCG Reserve. It was {{established}} by the U.S. Congress and {{signed into law by}} the President Franklin D. Roosevelt on 23 November 1942. This authorized the acceptance of women into the reserve as commissioned officers and at the enlisted level, effective {{for the duration of the}} war plus six months. The purpose of the law was to release officers and men for sea duty and to replace them with women at shore stations. Dorothy C. Stratton was appointed director of the Women's Reserve (<b>SPARS),</b> with the rank of lieutenant commander and was later promoted to captain. She had been the Dean of Women on leave from Purdue University, and an officer in The United States Naval Reserve (Women's Reserve), better known under the acronym WAVES for Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service. Stratton is credited with creating the nautical name of <b>SPARS.</b>|$|E

5|$|Although the USCG officially {{opened its}} doors to African-American women in October 1944, {{it was not until}} March 1945 that the first five women were {{accepted}}; they were the only African-American women to serve in the <b>SPARS.</b> Although the Women's Army Corps (WAC) accepted African-American women from its inception, the U.S. Navy's Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service (WAVES) only began accepting African-American women in October 1944, with fewer than 100 of them serving in the WAVES, and the U.S. Marine Corps Women's Reserve never opened its ranks to African-American women. The five African-American women who served in the <b>SPARS</b> were: Olivia Hooker, D. Winifred Byrd, Julia Mosley, Yvonne Cumberbatch, and Aileen Cooke.|$|E
5|$|At first, {{according}} to agreement, the <b>SPARS</b> enlisted personnel received their indoctrination training {{on college campuses}} operated for such by the U.S. Navy. In March 1943, the USCG decided to establish its own training center for the indoctrination of enlisted recruits. The site selected was the Palm Beach Biltmore Hotel, Palm Beach, Florida. Beginning in late June, all enlisted personnel received their indoctrination and specialized training there. Some 70 percent of the enlisted women who received recruit training also received some specialized training. Yeoman and storekeepers represented the largest share, but many <b>SPARS</b> were {{given the opportunity to}} train in other fields. In January 1945, the training of enlisted personnel was transferred from Palm Beach to Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn, New York.|$|E
5|$|Mermaid and Loire joined {{battle at}} 07:00, and the {{artillery}} exchange became close and furious after a boarding attempt by Loire was foiled by the helmsman of the British ship. Both ships took severe damage, Mermaid knocking away {{several of her}} opponent's <b>spars,</b> but suffering in turn from the musketry of the soldiers still aboard the Loire. At 09:15, the French vessel lost another spar, and Newman determined to rake his opponent. As he attempted to complete this manoeuvre, a shot from Loire brought down Mermaid's mizzenmast, making her unmanageable and disabling a number of her guns. Seeing an opportunity to escape, the battered Loire disengaged, making significant distance before Newman's crew could clear {{the wreckage of the}} mast. High winds further hampered Mermaid's repair efforts by tearing away several sails and <b>spars</b> and drowning the ship's carpenter when he was blown overboard. By the time Mermaid was ready for action once more, Loire had escaped.|$|E
50|$|The {{next level}} of kumite is {{freestyle}} one-step <b>sparring</b> (jiyu ippon kumite). This type of kumite, and its successor—free <b>sparring,</b> have been documented extensively by Nakayama and are expanded upon by the JKA instructor trainee program, for those clubs under the JKA. Freestyle one-step <b>sparring</b> is similar to one-step <b>sparring</b> but requires the karateka to be in motion. Practicing one-step <b>sparring</b> improves free <b>sparring</b> (jiyu kumite) skills, and also {{provides an opportunity for}} practicing major counter-attacks (as opposed to minor counter-attacks). Tsutomu Ohshima states that freestyle one-step <b>sparring</b> is the most realistic practice in Shotokan Karate, and that it is more realistic than free <b>sparring.</b>|$|R
50|$|Adult bulls <b>spar</b> in play, {{dominance}} interactions, {{or actual}} fights. A bull approaches another, lowing, with his horns down, {{and waits for}} the other bull {{to do the same}} thing. When <b>sparring,</b> the bulls twist their horns from side to side. If the <b>sparring</b> is for play, the bull may rub his opponent's face and body during the <b>sparring</b> session. Actual fights are violent but rare and brief. Calves may also <b>spar</b> in play, but adult females rarely <b>spar</b> at all.|$|R
50|$|In addition, {{there are}} {{training}} exercises including form <b>sparring</b> (kata kumite), focus stance <b>sparring</b> (kime dachi kumite), free exercise (jiyū undō), and free <b>sparring</b> (jiyū kumite).|$|R

Bond follows Largo and his yacht to the Bahamas, where he <b>spars</b> with Blush and Largo.|$|E
5|$|All {{versions}} of the Su-25 have a metal cantilever wing, of moderate sweep, high aspect ratio and equipped with high-lift devices. The wing consists of two cantilever sections attached to a central torsion box, forming a single unit with the fuselage. The air brakes are housed in fairings {{at the tip of}} each wing. Each wing has five hardpoints for weapons carriage, with the attachment points mounted on load-bearing ribs and <b>spars.</b> Each wing also features a five-section leading edge slat, a two-section flap and an aileron.|$|E
5|$|Marty (Eddie Jones) is {{a former}} boxer, now {{a high school teacher}} and boxing trainer/manager who had {{previously}} coached a fighter to a title shot, only to have the fighter leave him just before the fight. Marty and his business partner Diane (Diane Tayler) arrive at the gym where Tommy <b>spars</b> to scout his sparring partner. The fighter's manager instructs Tommy to make his fighter look good, but after he suffers a low blow, Tommy knocks the fighter out with one punch. The manager and the gym's owner angrily order Tommy from the gym but Marty and Diane chase after him, inviting him to train with Marty.|$|E

25|$|A {{detailed}} {{investigation by}} the NTSB showed that the wing's lower <b>spar</b> cap had extensive stress fatigue and had fractures through the lower <b>spar</b> cap, vertically up the <b>spar</b> web and into the upper <b>spar</b> cap. The lower wing skin also found signs of fatigue in the area adjacent to the cracked <b>spar</b> cap. An examination of two other similar aircraft showed that the area of cracking was hidden from view by other fuselage structure.|$|R

5|$|The replica {{standing}} mizzen {{is built}} to this shorter measurement and stepped {{in the hold}} on the keelson, as is the model in the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich. There {{is a difference between}} the height of the mizzen fore-and-aft spar in the contemporary painting of Earl of Pembroke before the naval refit of 1768 by Luny (below) and its position on the replica in the photographs, compared to the height of the lowest <b>spars</b> on the fore and mainmasts.|$|E
5|$|Visible {{changes from}} the XF-104 to {{production}} {{versions of the}} Starfighter include a longer fuselage (to accommodate the J79 engine and extra internal fuel) and a forward-retracting nose landing gear (except two-seat versions) to increase clearance for the downward-ejecting seat. A ventral fin for increased stability was added during the YF-104A test program. Inlet shock cones and a fuselage spine fairing between the canopy and fin that housed fuel piping were further added features. Production aircraft would also feature a redesigned fin structure using stainless steel <b>spars</b> to eliminate the flutter problem.|$|E
5|$|Although {{only the}} lower {{fittings}} of the rigging survives, a 1514 inventory {{and the only}} known contemporary depiction of the ship from the Anthony Roll {{have been used to}} determine how the propulsion system of the Mary Rose was designed. Nine, or possibly ten, sails were flown from four masts and a bowsprit: the foremast and mainmast had two and three square sails respectively; the mizzen mast had a lateen sail and a small square sail and the bonaventure mizzen had at least one lateen sail, and possibly also a square sail, and the bowsprit flew a small square spritsail. According to the Anthony Roll illustration (see top of this section), the yards (the <b>spars</b> from which the sails were set) on the foremast and mainmast were also equipped with sheerhooks, twin curved blades sharpened on the inside, that were intended to cut an enemy ship's rigging during boarding actions.|$|E

5|$|Despite its {{radical and}} unusual shape, the {{airframe}} was built along traditional lines. Except {{for the most}} highly stressed parts, the whole structure was manufactured from standard grades of light alloy. The airframe was broken down {{into a number of}} major assemblies: the centre section, a rectangular box containing the bomb-bay and engine bays bounded by the front and rear <b>spars</b> and the wing transport joints; the intakes and centre fuselage; the front fuselage, incorporating the pressure cabin; the nose; the outer wings; the leading edges; the wing trailing edge and tail end of the fuselage; the wings were not sealed and used directly as fuel tankage, but carried bladders for fuel in the void spaces of the wings; and there was a single swept tail fin with a single rudder on the trailing edge.|$|E
5|$|Development of the I-212, {{one such}} variant, began in 1947 as a twin-engined, all-metal, two-seat jet fighter. The round, {{streamlined}} fuselage was optimized to reduce drag and house the {{considerable amount of}} equipment and fuel required by the VVS. It had mid-mounted straight laminar flow wings and the engine nacelles were mounted {{in the middle of}} the wing, with the wing <b>spars</b> continued by banjo rings around the engines. The cruciform tail unit was swept at 45°. To save weight, the main load-bearing structures of the airframe were constructed from V-95 aluminum alloy and high-strength steel. Elektron (a magnesium alloy) was used for many components and castings. The aircraft used a tricycle undercarriage with the main wheels retracting into the fuselage. Hydraulically actuated air brakes were fitted either side of the rear fuselage.|$|E
5|$|During {{the two-year}} {{life of the}} officer {{indoctrination}} program, about 930 women completed the training and were commissioned as SPAR officers. In late 1944, the USCG determined that this complement was sufficient for its needs and discontinued the program. However, to replace the officers who had gone overseas, and those separated from the <b>SPARS,</b> the officer candidate school was later reopened for one last class. The candidates were all former enlisted personnel, who received their indoctrination at the USCG training station, Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn, New York. The USCG strived to recruit officer candidates who already had some civilian training or work experience of the type {{that could be used}} without further training. As result, only about one third of the officers received any specialized training. However, the specialized training programs produced 203 communications officers, and 106 pay and supply officers, prior to its discontinuance in November and December 1944.|$|E
