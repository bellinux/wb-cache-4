40|$|Thermal spray is a {{group of}} continuous, line of sight, {{deposition}} methods, where usually particles (1 - 50 mu m) are melted and accelerated, through either a combustion or a plasma flame. The molten droplets impinge on a substrate and rapidly solidify to form thin layers ("splats"). Among these techniques, plasma spraying is particularly fit for spraying ceramics and applied in many industrial applications on metallic surfaces. However, it has seldom been used for spraying glasses and even less to coat ceramic substrates, in particular traditional ones. In this paper, layered refractory ceramics coatings on <b>sintered</b> <b>refractories</b> have been deposited to improve the substrate resistance to molten glass. Some examples of plasma sprayed high-performance or waste glasses applied on porcelanized stoneware and porous single-firing bodies are presented, too. The coatings have been subsequently thermally treated and microstructural, chemical, mechanical analysis have been carried out both on as-sprayed and treated samples. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Plasma-sprayed ceramic {{coatings}} were manufactured on <b>sintered</b> alumina-mullite <b>refractory</b> bricks {{to improve}} their chemical resistance to molten glass. Mullite and alumina powders were employed. Graded layered coatings were designed and produced, to reduce the thermal expansion mismatch with the substrate: in all cases, the upper layer consisted in pure alumina (very resistant to chemical attack); alumina-mullite intermediate layers were added to match the low thermal expansion of the porous substrates. Plasma-sprayed coatings definitely improved both the abrasion resistance and the chemical resistance to long-time (8 h at 1400 degrees C) contact with molten glass, since the coating preserved its original microstructure. However, in thermal shock tests, some transverse cracks appeared; thus, thermal cycling tests in presence of molten glass indicated that, after a few cycles, the glass can penetrate down to these cracks. The tested samples were studied by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) ...|$|R
40|$|Microwave {{processing}} {{is emerging}} as an innovative and highly effective material processing method offering many advantages over conventional methods, especially for sintering applications. It is recognized for its various advantages, such as: time and energy saving, rapid heating rates, considerably reduced processing cycle time and temperature, fine microstructures and improved mechanical properties which lead to better product performance. Major constraints in conventional <b>sintering</b> of <b>refractory</b> material such as tungsten and its alloys are high sintering temperatures and long soaking times which cause abnormal grain growth and lead to poor mechanical properties. They get further aggravated at smaller (submicron and nano) tungsten powder sizes. This study describes recent research findings; W- 18 Cu and W- 7 Ni- 3 Cu alloys have been successfully con-solidated using microwave heating which resulted in an overall reduction of sintering time of up to 80 %.

One of the most relevant mechanical properties for evaluating thermal shock damage resistance is the energy of fracture. In order to obtain this property, a stable crack growth regimen must be achieved throughout the test. In this paper, three-point bending tests are analyzed to determine how machine stiffness influences load point displacement rates. Understanding the differences between recorded and adjusted displacement rates is important in determining the stability of crack growth.

40|$|Abstract. Results {{about the}} {{vitrification}} of several hazardous iron-rich industrial wastes (from productions of Zn and Cu metals, {{as well as}} EAFD and MSWA) and the usage of obtained glasses for synthesise of sintered glass-ceramics are summarises. It is shown that the appropriated method of sinter-crystallization mainly depends on the crystallization trend of used glasses. When the parent composition is characterised by formation of a moderate amount of crystal phase low temperature sintering with short crystallization step in the interval 800 - 900 oC can be used. In addition, attractive granite-like building glass-ceramic {{can be obtained by}} mixing fine and coarse glass frits and “free ” <b>sintering</b> in <b>refractory</b> moulds at 1000 - 1050 oC. Contrary, when intensive phase formation carries out the crystallization inhibits the sintering resulting in specimens with scarce degree of densification. However, in some cases a secondary densification process occurs at temperatures near to the eutectic ones, leading to well sintered samples with higher crystallinity and improved mechanical properties. It is also highlighted that the preventing of Fe 2 +oxidation by using inert atmosphere during the heat-treatments leads to a decreasing of sintering temperature, finer crystalline structure and additional enhancement of the mechanical properties...|$|R
40|$|An {{inexpensive}} containerless processing technique {{based on}} aerodynamic levitation {{has been developed}} for high temperature studies on ceramics. A spherical sample of about 0. 5 cm diameter levitates in an upward stream of inert gas in a flared graphite nozzle which also acts as a susceptor and heat's the sample by radiation to a maximum temperature of 2200 °C. The highest heating and cooling rates are 8 and $ 200 ^oC s^{- 1 }$, respectively. Solidification studies in this apparatus on the system $Al_ 20 _ 3 -BaO$ suggest that the eutectic between barium hexaaluminate phase-I and $BaAl_ 20 _ 4 $ occurs at less than 28. 7 mol% BaO instead of the currently accepted value of 32 mol%.

However, the risk of generating high poisonous Cr drives the researchers to find Cr-free refractories for copper industry.

40|$|Electric current activated/assisted {{sintering}} (ECAS) techniques, such as electrical discharge sintering (EDS) or resistive sintering (RS), {{have been}} intensively investigated {{for longer than}} 50 years.

The system alternates or combines direct resistive sintering (DRS) and indirect resistive sintering (IRS). Electrical insulation of the die has been achieved through the insertion of a film made of alumina fibers between the graphite die and the graphite punches, which are protected from the alumina fiber film by a graphite foil. This system localized the electric current directly through the sample (conductive materials) as in DRS and EDS, or through the thin graphite foil (non-conductive materials) as in IRS, and is the first system capable of being used under EDS or RS conditions independently combining current concentration/ localization phenomena...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{presented}} {{study is}} to evaluate utilization potential of the fly ash which is the main residue from the coal combustion thermal-plants. Decades long high production of fly ash represents extreme hazard for the environment. The storage problem of this waste material is also alerting. Thus, recycling and reapplication of fly ash in construction materials industry is the only economic solution. The well-known examples of fly-ash reapplication as a component in cement, mortar, concrete, bricks and tiles are not enough in means of reusing extreme amounts of this waste material. Therefore, new applications in ash-based composites have to be developed: eco-ceramic materials and <b>sintered</b> materials for <b>refractory</b> performances. In this investigation, characterization of three different fly ash capacities was used as base for further fly ash utilization possibilities analysis. Accent was on {{the investigation of the}} fly ash mineralogical and chemical composition. Thermal stability of crystalline phases was investigated with DTA. Macro-performance was correlated with the microstructure of fly ash studied by means of XRD and SEM analysis. Furthermore, content of trace elements, physico-chemical characteristics and leaching toxicity tests were carried out. Comparing the properties of investigated fly ashes with standard values, it could be presumed that fly ash originating from Serbian power plants can be potentially useful for high value products - eco-ceramic and refractory/sintered materials manufacturing. Key words: fly ash, microstructure, potential reusing, eco-ceramic, sintering.

40|$|Concretes whose {{structure}} and final properties are shaped during thermal pre-treatment or during life-service at elevated temperatures {{can be applied}} as construction material for thermal insulation and/or refractory linings in high-temperatureoperating plants. Refractory concretes designed with waste raw materials show satisfying performances in comparison with standard concretes. Sintering initiates microstructural changes within concrete. Concrete microstructure further develops with increasing temperature. Change progression can be monitored by means of destructive and non-destructive tests: either by investigating change of compressive strength or apparent porosity of concrete samples. Destructive tests, in this study, were applied in compressive strength investigation, while non-destructive tests were performed for results comparison. Experiment has been conducted on corundum (standard) concrete and recycled bauxite (experimental) concrete. Samples underwent thermal treatment from 110 to 1500 °C. Macroperformance of the final refractory concrete was correlated to the microstructural change detected by means of XRD and SEM analysis. Creep testing was conducted to prove sintering process. Results showed that recycled concrete has equal if not better properties in comparison with standard refractory concrete {{and can be used}} as thermoinsulation or refractory material. The results presented in this paper contribute to the idea of including other testing methods (i. e. nondestructive methods) in investigation of microstructural changes and <b>sintering</b> process of <b>refractory</b> concrete. At the same time results of this investigation highlight advantages of application of secondary raw materials in design of refractory materials. Although recycled aggregate concrete showed lower compressive strength and higher porosity than commercial concrete {{it should be noted that}} both porosity and compressive strength are within satisfying value range for high-temperature application, i. e. these concretes will not be used as structural materials but as thermal insulation linings. In such application refractoriness is the property which is more important than strength. Considering the fact that compressive strength is above 50 MPa (and above 20 MPa at 1500 °c) these concretes should be able to withstand load induced by other constructive parts of furnace and slag. Refractoriness test showed that bauxite-based recycled concrete is highly resistible on increasing temperatures and creep test showed initiation of sintering process. Corundum concrete can be used for temperature above 1500 °c. Due to the satisfying performances it is concluded that recycled concrete can be equally used as standard concrete. Even though it has slightly lower properties, accent should be on the financial and ecological benefit found in using of recycled material and savings of energy and natural resources...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. A vehicle flying at hypersonic speeds, i. e. at speeds greater than Mach 4, {{needs to be able}} to withstand the heat arising from friction and shock waves, which can reach temperatures of up to 3000 oC. The current project focuses on producing thermal protection systems based on ultra high temperature ceramic (UHTC) impregnated carbon-carbon composites. The carbon fibres offer low mass and excellent resistance to thermal shock; their vulnerability is to oxidation above 500 oC. The aim of introducing HfB 2, a UHTC, as a coating on the fibre tows or as particulate reinforcement into the carbon fibre preform, was to improve this property. The objectives of this project were to: i) identify a low temperature synthesis route for group IV diborides, ii) produce a powder fine enough to reduce the difficulties associated with <b>sintering</b> the <b>refractory</b> diborides, iii) develop sol-gel coating of HfB 2 onto carbon fibre tows iv) improve the solid loading of the particulate reinforcement into the carbon fibre preform, which should, in turn, increase the oxidation protection. In order to achieve the above set objectives, fine HfB 2 powder was synthesized through a low temperature sol gel and boro/carbothermal reduction process, using a range of different carbon sources. Study of the formation mechanism of HfB 2 revealed an intermediate boron sub-oxide and/or active boron formation that yielded HfB 2 formation at 1300 oC. At higher temperatures the formation of HfB 2 could be via intermediate HfC formation and/or B 4 C formation. Growth mechanism analysis showed that the nucleated particles possessed screw dislocations which indicated that the formation of HfB 2 was not only through a substitution reaction, but there could have been an element of a precipitation nucleation mechanism that lead to anisotropic growth under certain conditions. The effect of carbon sources during the boro/carbothermal reduction reaction on the size of the final HfB 2 powders was analysed and it was found that a direct relation existed between the size and level of agglomeration of the carbon sources and the resulting HfB 2 powders. A powder phenolic resin source led to the finest powder, with particle sizes in the range 30 to 150 nm. SPS sintering of the powder revealed that 99 % theoretical density could be achieved without the need for sintering aids at 2200 oC. Sol-gel coatings and slurry impregnation of HfB 2 on carbon fibres tows was performed using dip coating and a ‘squeeze–tube’ method respectively. Crack free coatings and non-porous matrix infiltration were successfully achieved. The solid loading of the fine HfB 2 into the carbon fibre preform was carried out through impregnation of a HfB 2 / phenolic resin / acetone slurry using vacuum impregnation. Although the sub-micron Loughborough (LU) powders were expected to improve the solid loading, compared to the commercially available micron sized powders, due to the slurry made from them having a higher viscosity because of the fine particle size, the solids loading achieved was consequently decreased. Optimisation of the rheology of the slurry with LU HfB 2 still requires more work. A comparison of the oxidation and ablation resistance of the Cf-HfB 2 composites prepared with both commercial micron sized HfB 2 powder and Loughborough sub-micron sized HfB 2 powder, each with similar level of solid loading, was carried out using oxyacetylene torch testing. It was found that the composite containing the finer, Loughborough powders suffered a larger erosion volume than the composite with the coarser commercial powders indicating that the former offered worse ablation and oxidation resistance than the latter. A full investigation of the effect of solids loading and particle size, including the option of using mixtures of fine and coarse powders, is still required...|$|R
