25|$|As {{aircraft}} {{began to}} travel faster, aerodynamicists {{realized that the}} density of air began to change as it {{came into contact with}} an object, leading to a division of fluid flow into the incompressible and compressible regimes. In compressible aerodynamics, density and pressure both change, which is the basis for calculating the speed of sound. Newton was the first to develop a mathematical model for calculating the speed of sound, but it was not correct until Pierre-Simon Laplace accounted for the molecular behavior of gases and introduced the heat capacity ratio. The ratio of the flow speed to the speed of sound was named the Mach number after Ernst Mach, {{who was one of the}} first to investigate the properties of supersonic flow which included <b>Schlieren</b> <b>photography</b> techniques to visualize the changes in density. William John Macquorn Rankine and Pierre Henri Hugoniot independently developed the theory for flow properties before and after a shock wave. Jakob Ackeret led the initial work on calculating the lift and drag on a supersonic airfoil. Theodore von Kármán and Hugh Latimer Dryden introduced the term transonic to describe flow speeds around Mach 1 where drag increases rapidly. Because of the increase in drag approaching Mach 1, aerodynamicists and aviators disagreed on whether supersonic flight was achievable.|$|E

In young puffballs, the internal contents, the gleba, is white and firm, but turns brown and powdery as the spores mature. [...] The gleba contains minute chambers that are lined with hymenium (the fertile, spore-bearing tissue); the chambers collapse when the spores mature. Mature puffballs release their powdery spores through the ostiole when they are compressed by touch or falling raindrops. A study of the spore release mechanism in L.pyriforme using high-speed <b>schlieren</b> <b>photography</b> determined that raindrops of 1mm diameter or greater, including rain drips from nearby trees, were sufficient to cause spore discharge. The puffed spores are ejected from the ostiole at a velocity of about 100cm/second to form a centimeter-tall cloud one-hundredth of a second after impact. A single puff like this can release over a million spores.|$|E

An increasing trend for the uptake of gaseous automotive fuels has driven the need for a better understanding of all aspects of fuel delivery processes.

40|$|We report {{experimental}} {{studies on the}} combustion of lean hydrogen-nitrous oxide-ammonia-air mixtures. This project is {{in support of the}} waste tank safety assessment for the storage facility at Hanford, WA. This study focuses on combustion limits, pressure histories, and flame speeds of flammable gas mixtures characteristic of this facility. A facility was constructed to study the lean combustion characteristics of mixtures containing ammonia. This facility consists of a gas-handling system, a remotely-controlled 400 -liter pressure vessel, a vacuum system capable of pumping and disposing of the unburned ammonia, and a data acquisition system. A total of 208 experiments were conducted for this study. All experiments were performed using air as a primary oxidizer. Separate experiments were carried out for binary and ternary mixtures containing air, hydrogen, ammonia, hydrogen-nitrous oxide, ammonia-hydrogen, and ammonia-nitrous oxide. Other experiments examined quaternary mixtures of ammonia-nitrous oxide-hydrogen-air. Mixtures were burned under quiescent and turbulent conditions and, in some cases, with an inert substitute (nitrogen) for the nitrous oxide. The pressure and temperature were recorded in the tank throughout the combustion events. A <b>schlieren</b> video <b>photography</b> system was used to observe flame propagation and measure flame speeds. The final equilibrium pressures were also measured in the experiments. The results demonstrate that nitrous oxide is inert in lean mixtures of hydrogen-air-nitrous oxide and reactive in lean mixtures of ammonia-air-nitrous oxide. For mixtures of hydrogen-nitrous oxide-ammonia-air, the reactivity of the nitrous oxide depends on the hydrogen-ammonia ratio. A correlation between the adiabatic, constant-pressure, flame temperature of the mixture and the reactivity threshold of the nitrous oxide is proposed. It was found that the nitrous oxide began reacting when the adiabatic flame temperature was between 1100 and 1300 K. It was found that for flame temperatures above this threshold, presence of nitrous oxide affects the flammability limit, the pressure history, and the flame speed. ...|$|R

Analysis revealed that equivalence ratio affects unequal diffusion instability via varying the Lewis number, Le; increased temperature can delay both types of instabilities in the majority of tests by promoting combustion rate and changing density ratio; pressure variation has minor effect on unequal diffusion instability but is responsible for enhancing hydrodynamic instability, particularly for stoichiometric and near-stoichiometric flames...|$|R

The University of Missouri [...] Columbia has recently developed an experimental test {{stand for the}} purposes of studying the interaction of shock waves with plasmas in ambient air. An exploding-wire-triggered shock tube is used to produce the shock wave for interaction with plasma in air. For the plasma source, an exploding wire discharge has been confined in a cylindrical geometry to form a freely propagating toroid-shaped plasma. The initial plasma is formed by discharging a 11 [micro]F, 4. 4 kJ capacitor bank through a thin wire. This discharge is then forced to expand toward a secondary discharge region which further heats and energizes the plasma. The confining geometry coupled with the secondary heating produces a multi-millisecond duration toroidal air plasma, or TAP.

In prelim•inary experiments, pure gases are erupted from small reservoirs. The gases used are Freon 12 and Freon 22, two gases of high molecular weight and high density that are good analogs of heavy and particulate-laden volcanic gases; nitrogen, a moderate molecular weight, moderate density gas for which the thermodynamic properties are well known; and helium, a low molecular weight, lowdensity gas that {{is used as a}} basis for comparison with the behavior of the heavier gases and as an analog of steam, the gas that dominates many volcanic eruptions.

Thrbulent flame curvature has also been studied using planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF) images. Spherically expanding flames propagating at constant pressure have been employed to determine the unstretched laminar burning velocity {{and the effect of}} flame stretch, quantified by the associated Markstein lengths. Methane-air mixtures at initial temperatures between 300 and 400 K, and pressures between 0. 1 and 1. 0 MPa have been studied at equivalence ratios of 0. 8, 1. 0 and 1. 2. Values of unstretched laminar burning velocity are correlated as functions of pressure, temperature and equivalence ratio. Two definitions of laminar burning velocity and their response to stretch due to curvature and flow strain are explored. Experimental results are compared with two sets of modeled predictions; one model considers the propagation of a spherically expanding flame using a reduced mechanism and the second considers a one dimensional flame using a full kinetic scheme. Data from the present experiments and computations are compared with those reported elsewhere. Comparisons are made with iso-octane-air mixtures and the contrast between fuels lighter and heavier than air is emphasized. Flame instability in laminar flame propagation become more pronounced at higher pressures, especially for lean and stoichiometric methane-air mixtures. Critical Peclet numbers for the onset of cellularity have been measured and related to the appropriate Markstein number. Analyses using flame photography clearly show the flame to accelerate as the instability develops, giving rise to a cellular flame structure. The underlying laws controlling the flame speed as cellularity develops have been explored. PMS images have been analysed to obtain the distributions of burned and unburned gas in turbulent flames. These have enabled turbulent burning velocities to be derived for stoichiometric methane-air at different turbulent r. m. s. velocities and initial pressures of 0. 1 MPa and 0. 5 MPa. A variety of ways of defining the turbulent burning velocity have been fruitfully explored. Relationships between these different burning velocities are deduced and their relationship with the turbulent flame speed derived. The deduced relationships have also been verified experimentally. Finally, distributions of flame curvature in turbulent flames have been measured experimentally using PMS and PLIF. The variance of the distribution increases with increase in the r. m. s. turbulent velocity and decrease in the Markstein number. Reasons for these effects are suggested...|$|R

40|$|Summary. [...] Axially-symmetrical, supersonic, fully-expanded jets of {{diameter}} about 0. 75 in. and of Mach number 1. 40 issuing into {{an atmosphere}} at rest were investigated by <b>schlieren</b> and shadow <b>photography</b> and by pressure traversing. The {{development of the}} jets was found to depend critically {{on the strength of}} the shock waves in the core of the jet at the nozzle exit. With strong shock waves present the jet spread very rapidly and was very unsteady. The jet did in some cases break up into large eddies of {{the same size as the}} diameter of the jet. When no disturbances were present in the core of the jet the spreading was far more gradual and the jet showed only slight unsteadiness. The turbulent mixing region of the first part of the jet with strong shock waves was investigated in detail by pitot tubes. The first inch was found to correspond to a two-dimensional half-jet. The velocity profiles were similar and well represented by the error integral. The rate of spreading was only half the value for low-speed flow. By integrations across. the mixing region the entrainment and-the loss of kinetic energy were determined. These quantities were found to agree well with the values estimated by assuming an error-integral velocity profile. 1. Introduction.

The work differed from previous investigations by using an actual injection system. The feasability of using a double pass schlieren technique in a working engine was tested on a small three-inch bore high speed diesel engine, with a mirror on top of the piston and a window in the cylinder head. This optical system allows the different phases of the cylinder charge (i. e., the air and the liquid, vapour and burning fuel) to be identified, and greatly facilitates study of the total penetration of the fuel spray, air swirl, combustion and scavenging. processes. The knowledge and experience obtained in the prosecution of this work showed that it was feasible to apply this system to a large medium speed engine. Although difficulties with piston tilt and oil passing up the bore and obscuring the piston mirror were encountered, methods to overcome these were found, as also was a method of mounting the sensitive schlieren mirror, so that the engine vibrations were minimized. Application to the large engine meant major design modifications to allow a quartz dndow to be fitted into the cylinder head. Experiments were carried out using various optical arrangements to change the range and sensitivity of the schlieren system in order to distinguish all the phases of tuel distribution. Electronic instrumentation was developed which allowed measurement of transient cylinder and injection system conditions during direct and <b>schlieren</b> high speed <b>photography</b> tests. From the cold bomb work an equation is proposed [...] . This allows the prediction of unevaporated spray penetration from an actual injection system taking into account nozzle upstream conditions and changes in length to diameter ratio. The large engine work shows that no appreciable air movement exists. Fuel spray penetration is radically affected by evaporation in hot gas but·the vapour continues to penetrate as a spray. The penetration of tpe vapour is identical to that of a spray without evaporation thus the proposed equation also predicts the total penetration of a hot gas. Using this equation a concept of combustion is proposed in which the fuel spray is deliberately allowed to impinge upon the piston 0 as opposed to the accepted theory of non-impingement. A 12 1 / 2 -inch bore engine using this form of combustion has demonstrated that an improvement in efficiency can be obtained {{at the same time as}} substantial reductions in mechanical loading of the injection system...|$|R
