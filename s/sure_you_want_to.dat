2500|$|Norris {{circulated}} {{the cartoon}} to bloggers based in Seattle, Washington. She sent {{a copy of}} her illustration to Dan Savage, who posted it on his blog on April 22. On April 23, she was interviewed by Dave Ross of KIRO, a local Seattle radio station. Norris responded to a question [...] "Are you <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do this?", and said [...] "Yeah, I want to water down the targets ... as a cartoonist I just felt so much passion about what had happened, I wanted to counter Comedy Central’s message about feeling afraid." [...] The motivation for the protest was not simply to defend the South Park creators, but also to support the {{right to free speech}} under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. She also said, [...] "it's a cartoonist's job to be non-PC." [...] On her website, Norris stated that the idea was not to disrespect Islam, but to support everybody's freedom of expression.|$|E
2500|$|So Jason Clarke is my {{public defender}} {{at the time}} and he's warning me. He's saying, [...] "Lindsey don't take drug court. I'm telling you, you won't make it." [...] He's told me this like three or four times. I'm adamant. I'm saying, [...] "I'm taking drug court." [...] Because all I know is I get to get out of jail. It's all I know. I don't know {{anything}} else about it. So I go to plead into drug court. My dad's in the court room. Judge Barton was on the bench that day instead of Judge Williams. She was gone. My dad's done Judge Barton's accounting for probably the past 15 years and they're very good friends. So (Judge Barton) sees me come in and he pulls me up to the bench and he's like, [...] "Don't do this. Don't take drug court. Are you <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do this?" [...] He asked me three or four times. Judge Barton's trying to talk me out of taking drug court. That I would not do well. I wouldn't make it. He didn't think it was what I should do.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{bittersweet}} {{moment in}} Cobb's life reportedly {{came in the}} late 1940s, when he and sportswriter Grantland Rice were returning from the Masters golf tournament. Stopping at a Greenville, South Carolina, liquor store, Cobb noticed that {{the man behind the}} counter was none other than [...] "Shoeless" [...] Joe Jackson, who had been banned from baseball almost 30 years earlier following the Black Sox scandal. But Jackson did not appear to recognize him, and after making his purchase an incredulous Cobb asked, [...] "Don't you know me, Joe?" [...] "I know you", replied Jackson, [...] "but I wasn't <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> speak to me. A lot of them don't." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1933, the Jacksons {{moved back}} to Greenville, South Carolina. After first opening a {{barbecue}} restaurant, Jackson and his wife opened [...] "Joe Jackson's Liquor Store", which they operated until his death. One of the better known stories of Jackson's post-major league life took place at his liquor store. Ty Cobb and sportswriter Grantland Rice entered the store, with Jackson showing no sign of recognition towards Cobb. After making his purchase, the incredulous Cobb finally asked Jackson, [...] "Don't you know me, Joe?" [...] Jackson replied, [...] "Sure, I know you, Ty, but I wasn't <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> know me. A lot of them don't." ...|$|R

[...] Londo starts laughing but explains that it's not because her idea is a joke; the proposal is so revolutionary that it's leaving him lightheaded in anticipation.|$|E
5000|$|First thing (after all) was {{to print}} T-shirts. We printed T-shirts (at Apple's expense) that said [...] "The power to cancel your very best" [...] on the front.

5000|$|Decker searched out, asked, {{and later}} met with and paid an assassin to murder Decker's sister.

So you <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> go through with it?' Decker replied, 'I am absolutely, positively, 100 percent sure,'" [...] then Decker handed over the money." [...] The assassin was an undercover detective wearing a recording device.|$|E

6000|$|... "Now, Mr Croft," [...] {{said the}} young lady, a very decided flush coming into her face, [...] "that is going too far. You {{have no right}} to accuse me of such a thing. I am not going to help in your love affairs, but I don't intend to be mean about it, either. Miss March asked me to bring that list, and at first I wouldn't do it, for I knew, just as well as I know anything, that you {{expected}} her to come to you with it, and I was very <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> see her more than the paper. I refused two or three times, but she said, at last, that if I didn't take it, she'd send it by some one in the house; so I just picked it up and brought it right along.

5000|$|Complaints of {{plagiarism}} of the 1986 Argentinian film Man Facing Southeast {{were made}} by its director, Eliseo Subiela. Subsequently, Gene Brewer and others connected with the K-PAX film were sued in November 2001. The complaint was later withdrawn as the trial stretched over time and Subiela didn't {{have enough money to}} keep the litigation going. Subiela claimed until his death in late 2016 that his film was plagiarized by the makers of K-PAX.

5000|$|The song is superficially {{about the}} protagonist mocking {{a woman with}} a severe {{hangover}} for her intoxicated escapades around town, making numerous social and verbal faux pas while high on alcohol and drugs ("But now you just can't remember / All the things you said / And you're not <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> know / I'll give you one hint, honey / You sure did put on a show!") The song makes late 1970s cultural references to such nouveaux riche fads as Elaine's Restaurant and Halston. At one point, Joel {{said in an interview that}} the song was actually about himself (that he was the one who [...] "had to be a big shot".) ...|$|E
5000|$|In his book, Greatest Team Ever: The Dallas Cowboys Dynasty of the 1990s, author Norm Hitzges {{chronicled the}} Herschel Walker trade. [...] Four games into the 1989 season, Jimmy Johnson, then {{head coach of}} the Dallas Cowboys, {{came up with the idea}} to trade Walker while on a morning jog with his staff. Johnson felt the Cowboys were so terrible that only a {{blockbuster}} trade could help them. He briefly considered trading wide receiver Michael Irvin to the Los Angeles Raiders, but Raiders owner Al Davis essentially talked Johnson out of the trade by saying, [...] "You <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do that? Who is going to catch passes for you?" [...] Johnson felt that Walker was the only remaining bargaining chip they had.|$|E
5000|$|Dance with Me was {{recorded}} at Redondo Pacific Studios in Redondo Beach, California with record producer Thom Wilson, who was initially hesitant {{to work with}} T.S.O.L. because of their violent reputation: [...] "I was very apprehensive about it," [...] he recalled in 1998, [...] "People said to me, 'Are you <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do this? They beat people up. However, {{he found that the}} band members took the recording process seriously and worked hard, the lone quirk being singer Jack Grisham's insistence on sitting while he recorded his vocal tracks. Wilson engineered and mixed the recordings, and they were mastered at K Disc. Paintings by artist Mark Wassman were used for the front and back cover, while photos for the back cover and insert were taken by photographers Glen E. Friedman and Edward Colver.|$|E

5000|$|The {{official}} {{music video}} for [...] "Blame It on Me" [...] {{was directed by}} Rob Brandon. It was first released onto YouTube on 11 August 2014 at a total length of three minutes and forty-four seconds. The video begins with a Ford pickup full of criminals driving past Ezra, who is carrying his guitar in its case, and a Japanese man. The man asks Ezra in Japanese, [...] "Are you <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> follow the yellow brick road?" [...] and then walks away without Ezra giving a response. The rest of the video features Ezra having a very bad day, including his guitar case blowing open and his guitar falling out into the road before it is {{run over by a}} police car, getting tackled by a rugby team, hit with a sucker dart fired from a toy pistol by a child, defecated on by a bird and winding {{up in the middle of}} a gunfight between police officers and the aforementioned criminals.

500|$|In an {{interview}} with XXL magazine, rapper Fat Joe claimed that he helped produce the track while working with producer Scott Storch. He stated: [...] "I'm pretty sure the world don't know we actually produced Candy Shop together. I produced it with him (Storch) ...

500|$|The {{band was}} {{surprised}} at the length of [...] "A Farewell to Arms" [...] and [...] "Clenching the Fists of Dissent" [...] running over ten minutes, and wondered if their fans would [...] "be able to get their heads around" [...] what the band was doing.
