5|$|Coward spelled {{his first}} name with the diæresis ("I didn't put the dots over the 'e' in Noël. The {{language}} did. Otherwise it's not Noël but Nool!"). The press and many book publishers failed to follow <b>suit,</b> <b>and</b> his name was printed as 'Noel' in The Times, The Observer and other contemporary newspapers and books. The papers of Noël Coward are held in the University of Birmingham.|$|E
5|$|Felix Cedeno, a 31-year-old American, sued 20th Century Fox for $2.25 million, {{after he}} was filmed {{as part of a}} scene where a live chicken fell out of Borat's {{suitcase}} on the subway. Cedeno later dropped the <b>suit,</b> <b>and</b> received nothing.|$|E
5|$|In 1998 {{the festival}} {{was once again}} struck with severe floods and storms, and again some festival goers {{departed}} early – but those who stayed were treated to performances from acts such as Pulp, Robbie Williams and Blur. Tony Bennett, however, overcame the messy environment in an immaculate white <b>suit</b> <b>and</b> tie. 1998 {{was also the first}} year that attendance officially broke the 100,000 mark.|$|E

5|$|On June 30, Goldwater {{received}} {{the endorsement of}} moderate Senator Everett Dirksen of Illinois after traveling to the Midwest to gain delegates. Dirksen's support further deflated the Stop Goldwater movement, as the Senator had criticized Goldwater's earlier vote against the Civil Rights Act, but concluded upon further review {{that he was only}} being consistent with his views. Richard Nixon followed <b>suit</b> <b>and</b> endorsed Goldwater two days later.|$|E

The combination of instability, equipment, neutral buoyancy and resistance to movement by the inertial and viscous effects of the water encumbers the diver.

5|$|A mutant {{criminal}} {{recruited by}} the Brotherhood in a prison truck, Juggernaut is incredibly strong, fast and, once he gains momentum, he is nearly unstoppable. The film's version of Juggernaut is depicted as a mutant and his relation to Charles Xavier was never mentioned. Matthew Vaughn cast Jones, who he met producing the Guy Ritchie gangster movies where Jones begun his acting career. The actor {{had to go through}} a four-hour make-up process to portray Juggernaut, which included a muscle <b>suit</b> <b>and</b> a prostethic chin. The costume tried to retain the bullet-shaped helmet of the comics without going excessively over the top.|$|E
5|$|Among Sophocles' {{earliest}} innovations was {{the addition}} of a third actor, which further reduced the role of the chorus and created greater opportunity for character development and conflict between characters. Aeschylus, who dominated Athenian playwriting during Sophocles' early career, followed <b>suit</b> <b>and</b> adopted the third character into his own work towards the end of his life. Aristotle credits Sophocles with the introduction of skenographia, or scenery-painting. It was not until after the death of the old master Aeschylus in 456 BC that Sophocles became the pre-eminent playwright in Athens.|$|E

5|$|Batman and Robin {{begin to}} have crime {{fighting}} relationship problems because of Ivy's seductive ability with Robin, but Bruce convinces Dick to trust him. Ivy is then able to contact Robin once more; she kisses him but fails to kill him due to Robin wearing rubber lips. Meanwhile, Barbara discovers the Batcave, where an AI version of Alfred reveals he has made Barbara her own suit. Barbara dons the <b>suit</b> <b>and</b> becomes Batgirl. Robin and later on Batman become trapped, but are rescued by Batgirl, who reveals her identity.|$|E
5|$|During the {{subsequent}} battle, the Na'vi suffer heavy casualties, including Tsu'tey and Trudy; but are rescued when Pandoran wildlife unexpectedly join {{the attack and}} overwhelm the humans, which Neytiri interprets as Eywa's answer to Jake's prayer. Jake destroys a makeshift bomber before it can reach the Tree of Souls; Quaritch escapes from his own damaged aircraft, wearing an AMP <b>suit</b> <b>and</b> breaks open the avatar link unit containing Jake's human body, exposing it to Pandora's poisonous atmosphere. Quaritch prepares to slit the throat of Jake's avatar, but Neytiri kills Quaritch and saves Jake from suffocation.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert brought <b>suit,</b> <b>and</b> after The Gondoliers {{closed in}} 1891, he withdrew the {{performance}} rights to his libretti, vowing to write no more operas for the Savoy. Gilbert next wrote The Mountebanks with Alfred Cellier and the flop Haste to the Wedding with George Grossmith, and Sullivan wrote Haddon Hall with Sydney Grundy. Gilbert eventually won the lawsuit and felt vindicated, but his actions and statements had been hurtful to his partners. Nevertheless, the partnership {{had been so}} profitable that, after the financial failure of the Royal English Opera House, Carte and his wife sought to reunite the author and composer.|$|E

5|$|However, this outward {{dullness}} concealed a sharp {{mind and}} great administrative talent. He operated mainly {{behind the scenes}} and cultivated {{an image of a}} colourless bureaucrat – for example, he was the only Bolshevik leader who always wore a <b>suit</b> <b>and</b> tie. In 1928 Molotov replaced Nikolai Uglanov as First Secretary of the Moscow Communist Party and held that position until 15 August 1929. In a lengthy address to the Central Committee in 1929, Molotov told the members the Soviet government would initiate a compulsory collectivisation campaign to solve the agrarian backwardness of Soviet agriculture.|$|E
5|$|In 1998 {{he made an}} {{unlikely}} but successful appearance at a mud-soaked Glastonbury in an immaculate <b>suit</b> <b>and</b> tie. Bennett also published The Good Life: The Autobiography of Tony Bennett in 1998. A series of albums, often based on themes (such as Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Billie Holiday, blues, or duets), has met with good acceptance; Bennett has won eleven more Best Traditional Pop Vocal Performance or Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album Grammys in the subsequent years, most recently for the year 2016. Bennett has sold over 50 million records worldwide during his career.|$|E

To prevent the now-dubbed X Parasites from spreading beyond SR388 and the space station orbiting above it, Samus sets the station to crash into the planet, during which she contends with the SA-X, an X Parasite that was born from her infected Power Suit pieces and possesses all of her abilities.|$|E
