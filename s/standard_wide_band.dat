The achievement of the method is demonstrated through its application, using the carbon fibers to perform this conductivity variation. Monopole antenna presents a large impedance bandwidth of 123 % with an interesting gain. Measurement and simulation present a good agreement. I. I N T R O D U C T I O N With the rapid development of communication <b>standards,</b> <b>wide</b> <b>band</b> antennas are needed. Several authors have suggested widening monopole antenna bandwidth by resistive loading continually [1, 2]. This kind of resistive distribution leads to a very wide bandwidth but damages significantly antenna gain and its efficiency becomes very low. Antenna characteristics could be improved by modifying the resistive profile. In this paper, we propose to use a variable conductivity along the antenna length applying an optimized profile which gives a broadband impedance bandwidth, a stable radiation pattern, a stable gain level over a large bandwidth especially in the horizontal plane and a higher radiation efficiency. The values of conductivity used is achieved by using various materials such as copper and specially carbon fibers fo r which we can easily tune its conductivity by modifying the concentration of carbon nanofibers [3]. The main aim {{is to find a}} compromise between a large impedance bandwidth at - 5 dB of reflection coefficient and a good efficiency. So, a new broadband monopole antenna is presented working in the VHF-UHF band. Simulation results and measurements are presented in order to illustrate the characteristics of the proposed antenna...|$|R
40|$|Communications in {{coal mines}} are poor by general {{industry}} standards, and generate significant risks in {{the lack of}} information available from underground areas. Mines often employ multiple incompatible systems for communication. This report concludes that there is no technical barrier to the upgrading of coal mine communications to equivalent standards of those used by general commercial and industrial organisations. The greatest needs are for a system that has a common <b>standard,</b> has <b>wide</b> <b>band</b> capacity, and allows for easy connectivity for sub-networks which are customised for specific applications. Mines are vulnerable in times of emergency, as traditional communications systems may fail. A new emergency communication system LAMPS {{has the potential to be}} integrated into a mine communications network, but still retains functionality following a major incident in the mine. An improved communications system would allow real time risk assessment to be carried out at the mine, and the requirements for monitoring, assessment and decision making have been investigated for some common hazards. These include ventilation issues, strata control and emergency response. This would incorporate the latest technologies in safety management and real time risk assessment, using computerbased assessment, assisted decision making, and virtual reality. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{interpretation}} of optical conductivity {{in the normal}} and superconducting states is considered {{in the frame of}} the <b>standard</b> Isotropic Single <b>wide</b> <b>Band</b> (ISB) model using the theory proposed by Nam. The exact analytical inversion of the normal state Nam equations is performed and applied for the recovery of the reliable information from the experimental data. The Allen formula is derived in the strong coupling approximation and the phenomenological "generalised" Drude formula in a high temperature approximation. It is shown, that the reconstruction of the shape of the spectral function from the normal state optical data at T>Tc is not unique. A novel adaptive method of the exact numerical inversion of the superconducting state equations is presented. It is shown that, the fine structure of the spectral function can be recovered from optical data in the case of s-wave pairing symmetry. In contrast, in the d-wave case the resulting image is approximately the convolution of the input electron-boson interaction function and the wide Gauss distribution function. A simplified visual accessibility procedure is proposed for ''by eye`` analyses of the optical reflectivity of the ISB metals with s- and d- pairing symmetry.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study of}} Distributed Cognitive Power Allocation for multicarrier based Ultra <b>Wide</b> <b>Band</b> (UWB) wireless systems in a point to point configuration {{as a way of}} reducing the coexistence interference for low power emission wireless systems in close proximity, as well as combating the increased path loss and fading at longer range by means of a Distributed Cognitive Power Allocation (DCPA) scheme. The Multiband Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (MB-OFDM) <b>standard</b> for Ultra <b>Wide</b> <b>Band</b> (UWB) wireless data communication is used as the basis in this research. A novel gradient power allocation is developed for channel sharing and partitioning among multiple user with no direct information exchange. A novel game strategy is used to assist the gradient power allocation and guide the behaviour of the homogenous users in order to acquire their target data rate. We show the superiority of our game based approach in terms of convergence and power efficiency through the comparison between our Game based and iterative water-filling based approaches. The strength of our scheme is also gained from a theoretical proof of convergence (demonstrating of the existence of a Nash Equilibrium). Performance analysis is carried out for both frequency selective and frequency none selective channels. Also, performance is evaluated for both interference dominated and noise dominated environments, where the severe interference is caused by the homogenous systems deployed in close vicinity. It is shown that the achievable target date rate is largely constrained by the interference while the performance is not impaired by frequency selective channel in terms of convergence and convergent speed. The methodology is adapted for an extended range scenario, where the protection of the licensed user (Primary user) is taken into consideration as well as the target data rate requirement. A new performance measure called the Power Impact Factor is used to quantify the impact of the power allocation scheme compared with the FCC spectrum mask. This measure is used to quantify the interference generated by cognitive UWB devices in relation to the existing agile services. ...|$|R
