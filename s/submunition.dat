2500|$|The treaty allows {{certain types}} of weapons with submunitions {{that do not have}} the {{indiscriminate}} area effects or pose the same unexploded ordnance risks as the prohibited weapons. These must contain no more than nine submunitions, and no <b>submunition</b> may weigh less than [...] Each <b>submunition</b> must have the capability to detect and engage a single target object and contain electronic self-destruct and self-deactivation devices. Weapons containing submunitions which each weigh at least [...] are also excluded. Australia, which supports the treaty, stated that the convention does not prohibit the SMArt 155 artillery shell that it has bought, which releases two self-guided self-destructing submunitions.|$|E
2500|$|The treaty allows {{certain types}} of weapons with submunitions {{that do not have}} the {{indiscriminate}} area effects or pose the same unexploded ordnance risks as cluster munitions. Permitted weapons must contain fewer than ten submunitions, and each must weigh more than , and each <b>submunition</b> must have the capability to detect and engage a single target object and contain electronic self-destruct and self-deactivation mechanisms. Weapons containing submunitions which all individually weigh at least [...] are also excluded. A limited number of prohibited weapons and submunitions can be acquired and kept for training in, and development of, detection, clearance and destruction techniques and counter-measures.|$|E
5000|$|Some 270 million cluster <b>submunitions</b> {{were dropped}} on Laos in the 1960s and 1970s; {{approximately}} {{one third of}} these <b>submunitions</b> failed to explode and continue to pose a threat today.|$|R
50|$|Hezbollah fired 4,407 <b>submunitions</b> into civilian-populated {{areas of}} {{northern}} Israel in 113 separate strikes, using Chinese made Type-81 122mm rockets, and Type-90 <b>submunitions.</b> These attacks killed one civilian and wounded twelve.|$|R
50|$|The MAT-120 cargo bomb is a Spanish-{{produced}} cluster munition, {{fired from}} a 120mm calibre mortar produced by Instalaza SA. The {{main body of the}} round holds dual-purpose anti-tank/anti-personnel <b>submunitions.</b> The MAT-120 <b>submunitions</b> are unique in that to prevent the dangers of unexploded duds, there is a double redundant feature the manufacture refers to as self-destruction and self-sterilization. This prevents unexploded MAT-120 <b>submunitions</b> from laying around becoming de facto landmines, dangerous to both combatants and non-combatants.|$|R
2500|$|Throughout {{four days}} of combat, {{including}} the initial breach of Iraqi lines and the battles of Al Busayyah and Medina Ridge, the unit conducted one of the US Army's largest artillery bombardments {{since the second world}} war. All totaled, 4-27 FA fired 588 M26 [...] "cluster bomb" [...] rockets into Iraqi forces and inflicted several thousand casualties in advance of 1st AD's armored assault. To put the scale of this bombardment in perspective, each rocket contained 644 DPICM bomblet submunitions, for a total of 378,672 warheads. Which is why US service members nickname these barrages [...] "steel rain." [...] While in practice many targets received multiple salvos and the submunitions had a 2–5% dud rate, if each rocket had been spaced out to maximize <b>submunition</b> blast radius, then the barrage would have theoretically [...] "sanitized" [...] a target area up to 49 square kilometers.|$|E
2500|$|Textron Systems {{announced}} on 13 September 2004 that its BLU-108 Sensor Fuzed <b>Submunition</b> was successfully dropped at Eglin Air Force Base from the DRS Sentry HP Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), resulting in multiple target hits. The test demonstrated {{the capability of}} weaponizing small, FCS Class II-category UAVs to engage multiple target threats. The U.S. Air Force's UAV Battle Lab sponsored the Sentry HP UAV/BLU-108 drop test, with participation by the USAF Sensor Fuzed Weapon (SFW) Project Office at Eglin AFB, Florida and the U.S. Army's Aviation & Missile Research Development & Engineering Center (AMRDEC) at Redstone Arsenal, Alabama. Lt. Col. Richard Mountain, the Sensor Fuzed Weapon Squadron Commander at Eglin AFB, stated, [...] "The cooperation between the various Air Force organizations and Army Lab at Redstone Arsenal, along with the BLU-108 submunition's adaptability to other carriers, ensured the UAV demonstration would be a success. The BLU-108 brings {{a great deal of}} proven capability to the war fighter." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{treaty was}} opposed {{by a number}} of {{countries}} that produce or stockpile significant quantities of cluster munitions, including China, Russia, the United States, India, Israel, Pakistan and Brazil. The U.S. has acknowledged humanitarian concerns about the use of cluster munitions, but insisted that the proper venue for a discussion of cluster munitions was the forum attached to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, which includes all major military powers. The U.S. has further stated that the development and introduction of [...] "smart" [...] cluster munitions, where each <b>submunition</b> contains its own targeting and guidance system as well as an auto-self-destruct mechanism, means that the problematic munitions are being moved away from in any case. In 2006, Barack Obama voted to support a legislative measure to limit use of the bombs, while his general election opponent John McCain and his primary opponent Hillary Clinton both voted against it. According to the Pentagon's 2008 policy, cluster munitions are actually humane weapons. [...] "Because future adversaries will likely use civilian shields for military targets – for example by locating a military target on the roof of an occupied building – use of unitary weapons could result in more civilian casualties and damage than cluster munitions," [...] the policy claims. [...] "Blanket elimination of cluster munitions is therefore unacceptable due not only to negative military consequences but also due to potential negative consequences for civilians." ...|$|E
50|$|Another, now {{withdrawn}} from service, was the JP233, a <b>submunitions</b> {{system in which}} an aircraft would fly over the target runway and a mixture of penetrating and anti-personnel <b>submunitions</b> would be dispensed to both crater the runway and impede repair work. The <b>submunitions</b> could be armed with delayed-fuses, meaning that workcrews {{run the risk of}} death or bodily injury as they worked on runway repair. After the UK signed an international accord banning cluster mines, the JP233 was retired.|$|R
50|$|Guided and unguided scatter munitions and <b>submunitions</b> {{have also}} been developed: a single {{artillery}} shell containing a number of smaller munitions designed to attack a tank. A six-gun battery {{might be able to}} fire several hundred <b>submunitions</b> in a minute or two.|$|R
40|$|<b>Submunitions</b> should exhibit optimum {{terminal}} {{performance at}} target end when released from certain pre-determined height. Selection of an optimum {{height of release}} of the <b>submunitions</b> depends on the terminal parameters like forward throw, remaining velocity, impact angle and flight time. In this paper, the effects of initial firing conditions and height of release on terminal performance of <b>submunitions</b> discussed in detail. For different height of release, the relation between range and forward throw is also established & validated {{for a number of}} firing altitude and rocket configurations...|$|R
50|$|After the <b>submunition</b> is {{released}} it opens a parachute. While slowly descending, the <b>submunition</b> rotates, scanning the area below with an infra-red sensor and a millimeter wave radar.|$|E
50|$|The rocket can {{be fitted}} with {{various types of}} warheads {{including}} anti-armour/personnel <b>submunition,</b> blasting, fuel air explosive (FAE), and high-explosive (HE). The ZDB-2 blasting warhead is loaded with steel balls and prefabricated fragments. The SZB-1 <b>submunition</b> warhead is designed to destroy large area targets such as armour formation and infantry troops. When the SZB-1 <b>submunition</b> warhead detonates, around 500 bullets are expelled under high pressure.|$|E
50|$|The M93 uses both seismic and {{acoustic}} {{sensors to}} track and identify potential targets near the mine. Once the mine detects a suitable target in range, the mine turns to face the target and elevates the <b>submunition</b> launcher to the correct angle. The <b>submunition</b> is then fired {{in the direction of}} the target using a gas generator. An infra-red sensor on the <b>submunition</b> scans the ground as it travels, searching for the target. When the target is detected the <b>submunition</b> triggers a Misznay Schardin effect warhead that projects a 450 gram tantalum slug, along with a number of smaller fragments downwards towards the target in a top attack.|$|E
50|$|Several {{successful}} live-fire {{tests were}} conducted in 1989, and production was scheduled for 1994; however, pre-production samples tested in 1993 gave poor results with only nine out of 42 <b>submunitions</b> hitting their targets. Fixes were applied and further testing resulted in 11 hits from 13 <b>submunitions.</b>|$|R
50|$|The CBU-24 {{cluster bomb}} {{consists}} of a SUU-30 dispenser unit containing a payload of 665 tennis ball-sized BLU-26 or BLU-36 fragmentation <b>submunitions,</b> also known as bomblets. Once dropped from the delivery aircraft, the CBU-24 casing breaks open in-flight and releases the individual <b>submunitions,</b> scattering them over a large area.|$|R

5000|$|The M898 155 mm SADARM {{shell is}} {{fired from a}} normal 155 mm {{artillery}} gun, with a nose-mounted M762/M767 fuse set to burst at 1,000 m above the target to release two SADARM submunitions. Once the <b>submunition</b> is ejected from the projectile, an initial ram-air parachute opens, to de-spin and slow the <b>submunition.</b> A second [...] "vortex ring" [...] parachute then deploys, to slowly spin the <b>submunition,</b> suspending it at approximately 30° from the vertical. As it spins, its sensors sweep a decreasing spiral track beneath the <b>submunition</b> to scan an area about 150 m in diameter. The sensors consist of a millimeter-wave radar, a passive millimeter-wave radiometer and an infrared telescope. A magnetometer is used as an aid in arming and aiming.When the <b>submunition</b> detects a target, its 1.5 kg LX-14 explosive charge is detonated, to project an explosively formed penetrator that has enough energy to penetrate the thin top armor of most main battle tanks up {{to a range of}} around 152 m. If the <b>submunition</b> reaches the ground before it finds a target it self-destructs. However, exact penetration power is not listed, being classified in nature.|$|E
50|$|EFPs {{have been}} adopted as warheads {{in a number of}} weapon systems, {{including}} the CBU-97 and BLU-108 air bombs (with the Skeet <b>submunition),</b> the M303 Special Operations Forces demolition kit, the M2/M4 Selectable Lightweight Attack Munition (SLAM), the SADARM <b>submunition,</b> the Low Cost Autonomous Attack System, and the TOW-2B anti-tank missile.|$|E

50|$|Designed {{to break}} up large {{mechanized}} formations, the M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) fires missiles carrying BAT <b>submunitions</b> to the targeted formation. The BAT <b>submunitions</b> are dispensed over the target area. The “wings”, tail fins and retarders (parachutes) are deployed on each BAT. The four “wings” have directional microphones on each tip.|$|R
50|$|Most anti-armor munitions contain shaped charge warheads {{to pierce}} the armor of tanks and armored {{fighting}} vehicles. In some cases, guidance {{is used to}} {{increase the likelihood of}} successfully hitting a vehicle. Modern guided <b>submunitions,</b> such as those found in the U.S. CBU-97, can use either a shaped charge or an explosively formed penetrator. Unguided shaped-charge <b>submunitions</b> are designed to be effective against entrenchments that incorporate overhead cover. To simplify supply and increase battlefield effectiveness by allowing a single type of round to be used against nearly any target, <b>submunitions</b> that incorporate both fragmentation and shaped-charge effects are produced.|$|R
50|$|After the <b>submunition</b> is {{released}} it opens two winglets. While descending, the <b>submunition</b> rotates, scanning the area below with multi-frequency infra-red sensors that compares the detected vehicles with a programmable target database.The submunitions each contain a high-penetration EFP warhead for use against even heavy armoured armoured fighting vehicles like main battle tanks.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{a cluster}} weapon every {{component}} in this submunitions dispenser {{has been designed}} so that it cannot leave active, unexploded submunitions. For example, a <b>submunition</b> cannot detonate without a correct launch indication. If a faulty <b>submunition</b> was to be launched from the pod and by some unlikely event become active on the ground, the internal system has been designed so that the <b>submunition</b> cannot detonate for any reason, since it didn't receive a correct launch indication. There are many other design features resulting in that no active unexploded ordnance is left. The details about exactly how this is achieved are all classified.|$|E
50|$|Each <b>submunition</b> is {{designed}} to detonate and damage or destroy targets within the weapon's footprint by explosion, concussion and fragmentation effects. While most BLU-26 submunitions explode on impact, {{they can also be}} set for air-burst or fixed-period delayed detonation. The BLU-36 <b>submunition</b> has a random time-delay fuse and will detonate at some point after impact.|$|E
