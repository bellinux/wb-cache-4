40|$|Abstract- This {{study is}} testing {{the effects of}} fibre length on tensile {{strength}} and strain on the stem of klutuk banana fibre <b>specimen</b> with length <b>of</b> fiber are variation of 10 cm, 7 cm, 5 cm and 3 cm. The results showed that composite fibres stem of banana with tensile strenght test result is <b>specimen</b> <b>of</b> 10 cm (25. 38 N/mm 2), <b>specimen</b> <b>of</b> 7 cm (14, 47 N/mm 2), <b>specimen</b> <b>of</b> 3 cm (17, 27 N/mm 2) and <b>specimen</b> <b>of</b> 5 cm (12, 08 N/mm 2).

The conclusions {{of this study are}} (1) the length of the stem of banana fibres in composite will further improve the tensile strenght on an existing specimen, by not being influenced by other factors, (2) The length of the stem of banana fibres will be increasingly small elongation that occurred compared with shorter fibres, and (3) the length of the stem of banana fibres are the higher values of the strain that occurs...|$|R

5|$|Past {{surveys are}} suspect, as Grimm (1981) and Hubricht (1985) no longer believe that Novisuccinea ovalis even occurs in Novisuccinea chittenangoensis habitat at Chittenango Falls. They surmise, rather, that earlier {{reported}} <b>specimens</b> <b>of</b> Novisuccinea ovalis were instead immature Novisuccinea chittenangoensis. However, {{a review of}} photographic records showed shells of Novisuccinea ovalis that were collected at the Falls when the type <b>specimens</b> <b>of</b> Novisuccinea chittenangoensis were collected. Apparently, Novisuccinea ovalis occurred {{at or near the}} Falls historically but is no longer encountered there or is only located in adjacent habitats. Therefore, relative comparisons between the two species' abundance is problematic and confusing.|$|E

5|$|A phylogenetic {{study of}} South American Armillaria species {{concluded}} that A.luteobubalina is in a lineage that includes A.montagnei, {{and these are}} sister to a lineage containing A.paulensis, a species known from a single specimen collected in São Paulo, Brazil. Although they are very similar, <b>specimens</b> <b>of</b> A.luteobubalina have smaller spores than Argentinian <b>specimens</b> <b>of</b> A.montagnei, and their distinctness is well-supported with phylogenetic analysis. Based on analysis of pectic enzymes, A.luteobubalina {{is closely related to}} A.limonea, a species found in New Zealand; this result corroborates phylogenetic analyses reported in 2003 and 2006. Molecular analysis of 27 collections of A.luteobubalina from southwest Western Australia and one from Traralgon revealed four distinct polymorphic groups. The genetic variety suggests it is native to Australia.|$|E
