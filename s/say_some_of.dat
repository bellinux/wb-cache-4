500|$|Like Amir, {{the protagonist}} of the novel, Hosseini was born in Afghanistan and left {{the country as a}} youth, not {{returning}} until 2003. Thus, he was frequently questioned about the extent of the autobiographical aspects of the book. In response, he said, [...] "When I <b>say</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> it is me, then people look unsatisfied. The parallels are pretty obvious, but... I left a few things ambiguous because I wanted to drive the book clubs crazy." [...] Having left the country {{around the time of the}} Soviet invasion, he felt a certain amount of survivor's guilt: [...] "Whenever I read stories about Afghanistan my reaction was always tinged with guilt. A lot of my childhood friends had a very hard time. Some of our cousins died. One died in a fuel truck trying to escape Afghanistan [...] Talk about guilt. He was one of the kids I grew up with flying kites. His father was shot." [...] Regardless, he maintains that the plot is fictional. Later, when writing his second novel, A Thousand Splendid Suns (then titled Dreaming in Titanic City), Hosseini remarked that he was happy that the main characters were women as it [...] "should put the end to the autobiographical question once and for all".|$|E

2500|$|Following the Millwood trade, the Rangers signed Rich Harden to a 1-year deal. The {{contract}} {{includes a}} mutual 2nd year option. Michael Young told the media his new teammate [...] "…has the best {{stuff in the}} league. I didn't <b>say</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the best stuff. I mean the best stuff I've seen." [...] Harden was not offered arbitration by his former club, the Cubs, so Texas did not lose a draft pick to sign the type A free agent.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first period}} {{occurred}} in the 1950s when Sun Ra's music evolved from big band swing into the outer-space-themed [...] "cosmic jazz" [...] {{for which he was}} best known. Music critics and jazz historians <b>say</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> his best work was recorded during this period and it is also some of his most accessible music. Sun Ra's music in this era was often tightly arranged and sometimes reminiscent of Duke Ellington's, Count Basie's, or other important swing music ensembles. However, there was a strong influence from post-swing styles like bebop, hard bop, and modal jazz, and touches of the exotic and hints of the experimentalism that dominated his later music. Notable Sun Ra albums from the 1950s include Sun Ra Visits Planet Earth, Interstellar Low Ways, Super-Sonic Jazz, We Travel the Space Ways, The Nubians of Plutonia and Jazz In Silhouette.|$|E
2500|$|Gibson {{originally}} {{announced that}} he would use two old languages without subtitles and rely on [...] "filmic storytelling". Because the story of the Passion is so well-known, Gibson felt the need to avoid vernacular languages in order to surprise audiences: [...] "I think it's almost counterproductive to <b>say</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> these things in a modern language. It makes you want to stand up and shout out the next line, like when you hear 'To be or not to be' and you instinctively say to yourself, 'That is the question.'" [...] The script was written in English by Gibson and Benedict Fitzgerald, then translated by William Fulco, S.J., a [...] professor at Loyola Marymount University, into Latin and reconstructed Aramaic. Gibson chose to use Latin instead of Greek, which was the lingua franca of that particular part of the Roman Empire at the time, since there is no source for the Koine Greek spoken in that region. The street Greek spoken in the ancient Levant region of Jesus' day is not the exact Greek language used in the Bible. Fulco sometimes incorporated deliberate errors in pronunciations and word endings when the characters were speaking a language unfamiliar to them, and some of the crude language used by the Roman soldiers was not translated in the subtitles.|$|E
2500|$|Henry Mitchell — Age 32, [...] Dennis' {{father is}} a workaday {{aerospace}} engineer. Henry seems to understand Dennis more than his wife does, especially in affairs of the heart. One example was when a furious Dennis stormed in, saying, [...] "Wimmin can <b>say</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the stupidest things!"; Henry knowingly said to Alice, [...] "Margaret." [...] Another time, while Dennis was watching Gina, he confided to his dad, [...] "There's somethin' about Gina that I can't figger out." [...] Henry wisely advised his son, [...] "Wait." [...] Again, Henry and Alice overhear Dennis tell Gina that she [...] "smelled better than a plateful of peanut butter samwiches". Henry remarks, [...] "The ultimate compliment." [...] Like his creator Hank Ketcham, Henry served in the US Navy; his position was [...] as a quartermaster (Helmsman) 2nd class on a battleship. Sometimes, he and Alice will get into arguments (which even show his chauvinistic side at times); however, they remain devoted to each other. Among his hobbies are golf, taking naps, fishing, and playing the ukulele and singing old songs with George Wilson. A running gag is that Henry often plays the straight man dupe — either resulting from Dennis's pranks, or because of his own foolishness; once he tried to save money on a Christmas tree by cutting one down in the country — and ended up paying $20.00 ($10.00 for a fine and $10.00 for the owner charging him for the tree).|$|E
