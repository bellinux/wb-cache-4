40|$|Estimation {{mainly for}} {{two classes of}} popular <b>models,</b> <b>single-index</b> and {{partially}} linear <b>single-index</b> <b>models,</b> is studied in this paper. Such models feature nonstationarity. Orthogonal series expansion is used to approximate the unknown integrable link functions in the models and a profile approach is used to derive the estimators. The findings include the dual rate of convergence of the estimators for the <b>single-index</b> <b>models</b> and a trio of convergence rates for the partially linear <b>single-index</b> <b>models.</b> A new central limit theorem is established for a plug-in estimator of the unknown link function. Meanwhile, a considerable extension to a class of partially nonlinear <b>single-index</b> <b>models</b> is discussed in Section 4. Monte Carlo simulation verifies these theoretical results.

Medical indices, such as the well-known Body Mass Index (BMI), Charleson Comorbidity Index, etc., have been used extensively in research and clinical practice, for the quantification of risks in individual patients. However, {{the development of these}} indices is challenged; and primarily based on heuristic arguments. Statistically, most medical indices can be expressed as a function of a linear combination of individual variables and fitted by <b>single-index</b> <b>model.</b> <b>Single-index</b> <b>model</b> represents a way to retain latent nonlinear features of the data without the usual complications that come with increased dimensionality. In my dissertation, I propose a <b>single-index</b> <b>model</b> approach to analytically derive indices from observed data; the resulted index inherently correlates with specific health outcomes of interest. The first part of this dissertation discusses the derivation of an index function for the prediction of one outcome using longitudinal data. A cubic-spline estimation scheme for partially linear single-index mixed effect model is proposed to incorporate the within-subject correlations among outcome measures contributed by the same subject. A recursive algorithm based on the optimization of penalized least square estimation equation is derived and is shown to work well in both simulated data and derivation of a new body mass measure for the assessment of hypertension risk in children. The second part of this dissertation extends the <b>single-index</b> <b>model</b> to a multivariate setting. Specifically, a multivariate version of <b>single-index</b> <b>model</b> for longitudinal data is presented. An important feature of the proposed model is the accommodation of both correlations among multivariate outcomes and among the repeated measurements from the same subject via random effects that link the outcomes in a unified modeling structure. A new body mass index measure that simultaneously predicts systolic and diastolic blood pressure in children is illustrated. The final part of this dissertation shows existence, root-n strong consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimators in multivariate <b>single-index</b> <b>model</b> under suitable conditions.

40|$|AbstractThe {{empirical}} likelihood {{method is}} especially useful for constructing confidence intervals or regions of parameters of interest. Yet, the technique cannot be directly applied to partially linear <b>single-index</b> <b>models</b> for longitudinal data {{due to the}} within-subject correlation. In this paper, a bias-corrected block empirical likelihood (BCBEL) method is suggested to study the models by accounting for the within-subject correlation. BCBEL shares some desired features: unlike any normal approximation based method for confidence region, the estimation of parameters with the iterative algorithm is avoided and a consistent estimator of the asymptotic covariance matrix is not needed. Because of bias correction, the BCBEL ratio is asymptotically chi-squared, and hence it can be directly used to construct confidence regions of the parameters without any extra Monte Carlo approximation that is needed when bias correction is not applied. The proposed method can naturally be applied to deal with pure <b>single-index</b> <b>models</b> and partially linear models for longitudinal data.

40|$|AbstractOne of {{the most}} {{difficult}} problems in applications of semi-parametric partially linear <b>single-index</b> <b>models</b> (PLSIM) is the choice of pilot estimators and complexity parameters which may result in radically different estimators. Pilot estimators are often assumed to be root-n consistent, although they are not given in a constructible way. Complexity parameters, such as a smoothing bandwidth are constrained to a certain speed, which is rarely determinable in practical situations. In this paper, efficient, constructible and practicable estimators of PLSIMs are designed with applications to time series. The proposed technique answers two questions from Carroll et al. [Generalized partially linear <b>single-index</b> <b>models,</b> J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 92 (1997) 477 – 489]: no root-n pilot estimator for the single-index part of the model is needed and complexity parameters can be selected at the optimal smoothing rate.
