Premier Jiang met with demonstrators outside the legislature on March 22 but stated that the executive branch {{had no intention of}} dropping the trade pact. At a press conference on March 23, President Ma restated his resolve in passing the trade pact and affirmed he did not act according to orders from Beijing.|$|E

500|$|Shunsuke Kosugi of Musica {{called the}} use of {{electronic}} beats on the album [...] "excellent", praised them as [...] "detailed" [...] and [...] "precise", and noted how they stirred up nostalgic feelings that [...] "pulled at the heartstrings". Kosugi {{felt that there was}} a uniformity to the beats on the album, and stressed that listeners <b>should</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> the work as a whole to experience this properly. Reviewers for So-en praised the album for Yamaguchi's vocals and Sakanaction's atypical band sound, feeling that listening to the album created a [...] "floating feeling like being in space". They further praised Yamaguchi's [...] "unique" [...] lyrical worldview, and the high level of perfection found in the recordings.|$|E
500|$|Molotov, like Stalin, was pathologically mistrustful of others, {{and because}} of it, much crucial {{information}} disappeared. As Molotov once said [...] "One <b>should</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> them, but {{it is necessary to}} check up on them. The intelligence officer can lead you to a very dangerous position... There are many provocateurs here, there, and everywhere." [...] Molotov continued to claim, in a series of published interviews, that there never was a secret territorial deal between Stalin and Hitler during the Nazi-Soviet Pact. Like Stalin, he never recognised the Cold War as an international event. He saw the Cold War as, more or less, the everyday conflict between communism and capitalism. He divided the capitalist countries into two groups, the [...] "smart and dangerous imperialists" [...] and the [...] "fools". Before his retirement, Molotov proposed establishing a socialist confederation with the People's Republic of China (PRC); Molotov believed socialist states were part of a bigger, supranational entity. In retirement, Molotov criticised Nikita Khrushchev for being a [...] "right-wing deviationist".|$|E
500|$|Al Jean {{described}} the film's message as being [...] "a man <b>should</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> his wife". In addition, the film parodies two major contemporary issues, religion and environmentalism. The theme of environmentalism is present throughout the film: in Homer's polluting of Lake Springfield, Green Day's cameo, Lisa's activism and her romance with Colin. The villainous Russ Cargill {{is head of}} the Environmental Protection Agency. Reviewer Ed Gonzalez argued the plot was a satire of the government's reaction to the effects of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans. Ian Nathan of Empire magazine criticized this focus, believing it gave the film an [...] "overt political agenda [...] border on [...] ". James D. Bloom of Muhlenberg College commented on the [...] "explicitness" [...] of the film's [...] "intellectual agenda", on this issue, shown particularly through Lisa. He wrote that the film's first post-opening credits scene, which sees Green Day fail in an attempt to engage their audience {{on the issue of the}} environment, [...] "sets in motion a plot expressly built around cultural agenda-setting" [...] and [...] "reflection on timely 'issues'." ...|$|E

500|$|Songs {{from the}} album have been sampled {{frequently}} by hip hop producers and artists, including Black Moon, who sampled [...] "A Divine Image", and DJ Shadow, who sampled the luminous piano line from [...] "The Human Abstract" [...] on his 1996 song [...] "Midnight in a Perfect World". English hip hop producer Metabeats called Songs of Experience {{one of his}} favorite sources for sampling music and said of the album in an interview for Hip Hop Connection: [...] "You could sample everything on this record, and I think everyone already has. Axelrod is pretty much a sound library in himself – the quality is amazing." [...] American musician John McEntire ranked it third on his list of top-five albums and called it [...] "early crate-digger stuff. Great, funky rhythm-section playing, crazy, overblown string arrangements." [...] In a 2000 interview for The Wire, rapper and producer Mike Ladd spoke of the album recording [...] "London", deeming it [...] "crazy stuff" [...] that deviated from the one-dimensional rhythm loops of contemporary hip hop production. He went on the say, [...] "this is definitely the kind of stuff I'm planning to do for the next album, incorporate more fusion elements and stuff like that. This is a really good production. I like it because it's little parts with gaps, which I don't normally have. Somebody told me I <b>should</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> [...] This is one I'm definitely going to buy I'd like to do more stuff with complicated melodies, everybody playing together, drum breaks, things like that." ...|$|E
500|$|Tanya Remekie of Rap-Up {{felt that}} the album {{contains}} a [...] "show-stopping event as Sasha Fierce and Bey come out to play". She finished her review by writing that the [...] "Broadway-fashioned narration of her life story, told through song and dance.. shares her magical story." [...] During {{a review of the}} album, the writers of People magazine rated it with three-and-a-half out of four stars and wrote that it [...] "offers nicely subdued versions of her hits", further describing the show as a [...] "magic". Another writer of the same publication praised the album, writing that [...] "You'll get to know Beyoncé like never before". Similarly, a writer of Eye Weekly called the album [...] "extraordinary", before adding that it is [...] "the chance to experience her (Beyoncé) up close and personal". A writer of Us Weekly said that to see Beyoncé's [...] "fiereceness", people <b>should</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> her album I Am... Sasha Fierce or buy the DVD I Am... Yours: An Intimate Performance at Wynn Las Vegas to see the live experience. Allmusic's Andy Kellman awarded I Am... Yours: An Intimate Performance at Wynn Las Vegas a rating of four out of five stars, describing it as a [...] "theatrical production worthy of Vegas, with Beyoncé and her large backing band energetically rolling [...] ". He noted that [...] "what makes I Am...Yours stand apart from a typical live-album cash-in is the mostly unexpected covers that are weaved into the set." [...] Kellman finished his review by writing, [...] "As live albums go, this is not quite destined {{to be one of those}} all-time classics; a couple missing songs and a little too much talk aside, however, the fans couldn't ask for more." ...|$|E

2500|$|Amberian Dawn {{classified}} {{themselves as}} [...] "melodic, dramatic and powerful metal with female classical vocals," [...] and ex-lead singer Heidi Parviainen has called their music [...] "fast tempo, guitar driven metal with purely classical female vocals", while several other sources classify them as symphonic power metal, which the band has agreed sums it up, but {{also points out}} that there are many different styles that vary from song to song. In a September 2010 interview, Seppälä defines their music: [...] "Amberian Dawn's music is melodic metal, and the roots lie in the Metal and Rock music of the 70s and 80s and maybe {{a little bit of the}} '90s. There are a lot of technical skills within the band, so everyone who's not scared of serious guitar and keyboard shredding <b>should</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> our music." ...|$|E
