25|$|During {{the trial}} of David Westerfield in 2002 for the kidnap and murder of Danielle van Dam, Grace made it clear on Larry King Live that <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> guilty, but she got some facts wrong. For example, she said he had steam-cleaned his RV, but no {{evidence}} was introduced that he had. Dr. Henry Lee pointed out {{that if he had}} done so, they wouldn't have found the fingerprints and the bloodstain on the carpet. It should be noted, however, that David Westerfield was convicted of kidnapping and murdering Danielle van Dam.|$|E
25|$|Harris's site {{attracted}} few visitors, {{and caused}} no concern until March 1998. Klebold gave the web address to Brooks Brown, a former friend of Harris. Brown's mother had filed numerous complaints with the Jefferson County Sheriff's office concerning Harris, as <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> dangerous. The website contained numerous death threats directed against Brown: Klebold {{knew that if}} Brooks accessed the address, he would discover the content and inform his parents, and likely the authorities would be notified. After Brown's parents viewed the site, they contacted the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office. The investigator Michael Guerra was told about the website. When he accessed it, Guerra discovered numerous violent threats directed against the students and teachers of Columbine High School. Other material included blurbs that Harris had written about his general hatred of society, and his desire to kill those who annoyed him.|$|E

After Maimai became beautiful from the spring water, he murdered everyone from his village and killed Mai because he felt ugly in her presence. He is Princess Yuri's younger brother, and has the same soul symbol as she has. Soul Symbol: Beauty. Similarly to Maora from The Gentlemen's Alliance Cross, his physical appearance is drastically different dressing as a girl: he has a girly round eye shape and a delicate feminine neck as opposed to his masculine appearance.|$|E

But {{as soon as they}} start a family she realizes that {{something}} is missing in their relationship, that he's never really there. It also shows that lives that seem perfect on paper might not be so perfect in reality." [...] Actress Audrey Giacomini portrays Jeanne at fifteen.|$|E
500|$|Mark {{returned}} during [...] "Episode 6646", {{which focused}} on an eclipse. Kate was left questioning whether she had really seen him. Brewer said that her character would be torn when Mark returns, as she had moved on with Mason Turner (Taylor Glockner) and Mark's reappearance [...] "just throws it all out of whack". When asked whether Kate and Mark's reunion would be bittersweet, McGregor explained [...] "Brennan and Kate definitely have chemistry and their parting was not because they {{had fallen out of}} love. But things are different now and Kate has a new boyfriend. When Brennan tells her he still loves her it's hard because <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> dead and had let go of him." ...|$|E

500|$|The couple put {{together}} an act and began booking it at small midwestern theaters. When an offer came for an engagement in Harwich Port, Massachusetts, some 2,000 miles from Kansas City, they were pleased to get it because of its proximity to their ultimate goal, the vaudeville houses of New York City. [...] To get to Massachusetts they bought a used car and borrowed five dollars from Edna's mother, {{but by the time}} they arrived in St. Louis they had only fifty cents. [...] Skelton asked Edna to collect empty cigarette packs; <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> joking, but did as he asked. [...] He then spent their fifty cents on bars of soap, which they cut into small cubes and wrapped with the tinfoil from the cigarette packs. [...] By selling their products for fifty cents each as fog remover for eyeglasses, the Skeltons were able to afford a hotel room every night as they worked their way to Harwich Port.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Bart {{is delighted}} at having Laura babysitting him and {{attempts}} to impress her. She later asks {{him to come to}} his treehouse, as she has important news. She tells him she is dating Jimbo Jones, which upsets Bart. When Laura invites him over to the household, Bart, in an attempt to break the pair up, prank-calls Moe's Tavern, giving his name as [...] "Jimbo Jones", and telling Moe where he lives. Mistakenly believing Jimbo {{was the one who had}} been pranking Moe throughout the entire series, he races into the Simpson house with a kitchen knife looking for Jimbo, causing Jimbo to cry and plead for his life. Afterwards, Laura breaks up with him for not being the tough [...] "outlaw" [...] <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was.</b> Laura tells Bart that she would date him if he were old enough to grow a mustache and the episode ends with the pair laughing after prank-calling Moe again.|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} {{directed}} by James Foley, who worked with Madonna in her music video for [...] "Live to Tell", produced by David Naylor and Sharon Oreck, and Michael Ballhaus {{was in charge of}} the photography. The video was shot on location over three days in Staten Island, New York and Manhattan. Staten Island was chosen on Foley's suggestion as it was where he grew up: [...] "We talked about wanting to tap into a working-class environment, because by that time she had done 'Material Girl' and 'Like a Virgin' and other stuff that was very glamorous and stylized. She wanted to do something a bit more grounded and 'drama'." [...] Actor Alex McArthur was signed to play Madonna's boyfriend and the father of her child in the video. Madonna had spotted McArthur in a small role as a naive youth in the 1985 film Desert Hearts, and <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a natural to play her mechanic boyfriend. [...] "I was out in the garage working on my Harley," [...] said McArthur, [...] "I answered the phone and a voice said, 'Hi, this is Madonna. I would like you to be in my next video.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Michael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps {{said that}} the {{relationship}} [...] "hasnâ€™t worked out or caught fire through the writing, or with the fans watching on-screen!" [...] In August 2012, Victor and Sharon married a second time, and when he disappeared shortly after, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> abandoning her. Sharon later burned their prenuptial agreement, and took over this company. Talking about the situation, Case stated that the writers {{could have done this}} storyline [...] "a million other ways" [...] without [...] "marrying him [...] ". In another interview, she spoke thoroughly of the relationship, labeling it incestuous. She stated: [...] "Sometimes controversial storylines can work because you're bringing attention to a controversial issue that the nation is trying to decide on. But this was not one of those things. Everybody is universally against incest! It was just so upsetting to the audience. Whenever the actors went to do , the fans would bring it up. Literally, every actor in the building was coming up to me, giving me feedback that they were getting about it!" [...] When asked if the marriage was about [...] "daddy issues", Case said: [...] "That's usually the case in a story like that, but I don't think it's one most people want to watch!" [...] Victor later returned home and annulled their second marriage. During an interview with The Province, Michael Muhney, who portrays Victor's son Adam, said that Victor and Sharon's marriage was [...] "almost like an inside joke".|$|E
500|$|In 1961, O'Hara portrayed Kit Tilden in {{the western}} The Deadly Companions, Sam Peckinpah's feature-film debut. Playing against {{stereotype}} as the strong, aggressive redhead, she plays a character who is vulnerable to rape and violence from men. The plot involves her traveling across Apache territory with an ex-Sergeant (Keith) to bury her young son to be buried next to his father in the desert. Malone considered her character in the film to be [...] "radically underdeveloped". While O'Hara acknowledged that Peckinpah later [...] "reached icon status as a great director of westerns", <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> [...] "just awful" [...] and [...] "one of the strangest and most objectionable people I had ever worked with". Later that year she starred in The Parent Trap, {{one of her most}} popular films, opposite a young Hayley Mills. O'Hara credits Mills for the success of the film, remarking that [...] "she really did bring two different girls to life in the movie" [...] and wrote that [...] "Sharon and Susan were so believable that I'd sometimes forget myself and look for the other one when Hayley and I were standing around the set". Malone notes that this was the film that she [...] "made a transition from comely maiden to trendy mother", one which received some of the best critical plaudits of her career. O'Hara was subsequently involved in a legal dispute with Walt Disney, backed by the Screen Actors Guild, over billing for the film. She never worked for Disney again.|$|E
500|$|At last, the {{two girls}} {{stand in front of}} the Wizard. He turns out to be not quite as terrifying as they thought ("A Sentimental Man"). He {{promises}} Elphaba that he will grant her request if she proves herself. Madame Morrible appears; she is the Wizard's new [...] "Press Secretary". She gives Elphaba an ancient book of spells, called the [...] "Grimmerie," [...] which only the magically gifted can read. Elphaba is asked to try a levitation spell on the Wizard's monkey servant, Chistery. However, the spell doesn't go the way Elphaba plans when Chistery sprouts wings, and she realizes that the Wizard is the one behind the suppression of the Animals. Elphaba has been tricked, and instead of just performing the spell on one monkey, she actually performed the spell on all of them. Elphaba realizes that the Wizard is not who <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> - he has no powers; he is merely a charlatan who cannot read the Grimmerie. He offers her and Glinda everything they've ever wanted if they will help him, but Elphaba is unable to comply. She runs away, and in order to prevent the truth from getting out, Madame Morrible spreads reports that Elphaba is [...] "wicked," [...] not to be trusted, and claims that Elphaba is the one behind the animal mischief. This only reaffirms Elphaba's belief that she must not let anyone hold her down; she must go on her own to do what's best for her. She performs a spell on a broom and flies. ("Defying Gravity").|$|E
50|$|The movie {{begins with}} an {{introduction}} from Teresa Stamper giving an interview about her ex-husband Paul Stamper and how he caught her when she wasn't looking and that <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a charmer.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Montgomery stared; <b>she</b> evidently <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> jesting; but <b>she</b> {{presently}} {{saw that}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not, and the complication of her feelings became painful.

60|$|On the Yonkers basis {{they became}} more intimate, more personal, and Dan {{told her about}} Ponkwasset Falls and his mother and sisters; {{he told her about}} his father, and she said she should like to see his father; <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> must <b>be</b> like her father.|$|R
500|$|In 1955, O'Hara {{made her}} fourth picture with Ford, The Long Gray Line, which she {{considered}} being [...] "by {{far the most}} difficult" [...] due to declining relations with John Ford. John Wayne had originally intended co-starring, but due to a conflicting schedule O'Hara recommended Tyrone Power in replacement. Malone notes that the Irish accents by O'Hara and Power are overdone, {{and that there is}} little trace of a Donegal accent in it. The film production marked the lowest point of O'Hara's relationship with Ford, and each day he would greet her with [...] "Well, did Herself have a good shit this morning?". He would ask the crew if she was in a good mood, and if that was the case, he would say [...] "then we're going to have a horrible day" [...] and vice versa. He would provoke her by telling her to [...] "move her fat Irish ass". Their relationship deteriorated further when O'Hara reportedly saw him kissing an actor on set, and Ford knew that <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a closeted homosexual. In The Magnificent Matador, O'Hara played a spoiled, wealthy American who {{falls in love with a}} brooding, tormented, about-to-retire matador (Anthony Quinn) in Mexico. Ava Gardner, who was dating a bullfighter in real life, Luis Miguel DominguÃ­n, and Lana Turner were considered for O'Hara's part of Karen Harrison. The film was panned by the critics. One of her best-known roles came later year, playing Lady Godiva in Lady Godiva of Coventry. Contrary to what Universal claimed to the press, O'Hara was not nude in the film, wearing a [...] "full-length body leotard and underwear that was concealed by my long tresses".|$|E
500|$|After {{it became}} known that Billy, not Cane, fathered Chloe's {{daughter}} Delia, journalist Michael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps praised the storyline that involved Chloe, Lily, Billy and Cane as [...] "one of soaps all-time best quadrangle story arcs". Jeevan Brar of TV Buzz noted the popularity that Chloe and Billy (a couple that fans have named [...] "Chilly") generated, writing, [...] "A lot of fans saw that pairing end way too quickly {{to make way for}} the ill-fated Billy & Mac redux." [...] Referring to the love triangle between Chance, Chloe and Heather, Nekeeta Borden (also writing for Zap2it) said, [...] "All things considered, will Chance and Chloe survive Hurricane Heather?" [...] In another article, Borden heavily criticized the writing for Chloe's character. She wrote, [...] "Initially I hated the pint-sized minx when she first planted her stilettos in Genoa City and on Lilyâ€™s face a few years back, but lately I've come to realize how much I miss the scheming, sassy Chloe of old [...] The pairing with [...] killed poor Chloe dead. She, like Phyllis Newman (Michelle Stafford), is not meant to be some happy housewife, married to a boy scout. Chloe needs a sparring partner and partner-in-crime. She is way too much woman to be cheated on by someone like Chance." [...] Also unfavorable of the relationship was Sara Bibel of Xfinity, who wrote that [...] "Chance and Chloe never had much chemistry. [...] She was attracted to him because <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a safe, dependable guy who would not cheat on her", describing Chance as [...] "the anti-Billy" [...] in Chloe's eyes.|$|E
2500|$|A {{story is}} {{recorded}} of NÃ­ MhÃ¡ille chiding her son TÃ­oboÃ­d {{in the course}} of an attack on Kinturk Castle, when <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> shirking the battle: [...] "An ag iarraidh dul i bhfolach ar mo thÃ³in atÃ¡ tÃº, an Ã¡it a dtÃ¡inig tÃº as?" [...] ("Are you trying to hide in my arse, the place that you came out of?"). She is also recorded as saying with regard to her followers [...] "go mb'fhearr lÃ©i lÃ¡n loinge de chlann Chonraoi agus de chlann Mhic an FhailÃ­ nÃ¡ lÃ¡n loinge d'Ã³r" [...] (that she would rather have a shipload of Conroys and MacAnallys than a shipload of gold).|$|E
6000|$|Should {{she tell}} her grandfather? Something instinctively said No; {{that the first}} word from him which showed Moses <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{detected}} would at once send him off with those wicked men. [...] "He would never, never bear to have this known," [...] she said. Mr. Sewell?--ah, that was worse. She herself shrank from letting him know what Moses had been doing; she {{could not bear to}} lower him so much in his eyes. He could not make allowances, <b>she</b> <b>thought.</b> <b>He</b> <b>is</b> good, to <b>be</b> sure, but <b>he</b> <b>is</b> so old and grave, and doesn't know how much Moses has been tempted by these dreadful men; and then perhaps he would tell Miss Emily, and they never would want Moses to come there any more.|$|R
50|$|Without explanation, Webb ceased {{producing}} his webcast talk show, {{with the}} last show being recorded on April 13, 2007. Subsequently, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> reported missing by his sister, who stated she had not talked to him since April 13. Webb's sister told Seattle's KOMO 4 News that <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> might <b>be</b> in danger.|$|R
50|$|The story {{continues}} {{from the previous}} episode, when Lynette confronted Tom after <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> having an affair. They both misunderstood each other, but the situation is immediately resolved when Lynette realizes that Porter {{is the one who}} is having sex with Anne. Lynette and Tom ask Porter to end the relationship via the phone, but Porter refuses, fearing that Mr. Schilling might pick up the phone. During a PTA meeting, Anne asks the parents to become chaperons to the school prom. Lynette goes to the restroom and while Anne talks to her there, Lynette loses her temper and attacks Anne. Anne later confesses to Porter that she is pregnant. Porter decides to flee with Anne {{at the end of the}} episode.|$|R
2500|$|Hal Wallis {{also saw}} the American Scott's test and {{recognized}} her potential. In a meeting, Wallis told Scott, [...] "If I could, I would put you under contract.", {{but she did not}} believe him. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> as powerful as Warner and was [...] "prevaricating". Unknown to Scott, years of infighting between Jack Warner and Wallis were about to climax. Under acrimonious circumstances, Wallis left Warner Bros. for Paramount Pictures. On the day that Scott was scheduled to leave for New York, she read about it in Variety, but she spent several months in New York before Feldman telegraphed her in August 1944â€”Wallis wanted to sign her to a contract.|$|E
2500|$|To bolster his {{increasing}} popularity, MGM frequently paired {{him with}} well-established female stars. Joan Crawford asked {{for him as}} her co-star in Dance, Fools, Dance (1931). He built his fame and public visibility in such movies as A Free Soul (1931), in which he played a gangster who shoved the character played by Norma Shearer; Gable never played a supporting role again. The Hollywood Reporter wrote [...] "A star in the making has been made, one that, to our reckoning, will outdraw every other star... Never have we seen audiences work themselves into such enthusiasm as when Clark Gable walks on the screen". He followed that with Susan Lenox (Her Fall and Rise) (1931) with Greta Garbo, and Possessed (1931), in which Crawford (then married to Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.) and he steamed up the screen. Adela Rogers St. Johns later dubbed Gable and Crawford's real-life relationship as [...] "the affair that nearly burned Hollywood down". Louis B. Mayer threatened to terminate both their contracts, {{and for a while}} they kept apart. Gable shifted his attentions to Marion Davies. However, Gable and Garbo disliked each other. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a wooden actor, while he considered her a snob.|$|E
2500|$|As a demonstration, Pinker {{asks the}} reader to {{surrender}} only his or her imagination to his words for a few moments. He says that he can cause {{the reader to}} think some [...] "very specific thoughts". Pinker gives a few immediate examples; he notes how the [...] "normally grayish body" [...] of a male octopus suddenly becomes striped when selecting a female to mate with, cherries jubilee on a white suit, wine on an altar cloth, and how immediately applying club soda to the white suit or altar cloth works well to remove the stains from the fabrics. In his next mention, Pinker notes a Tad and Dixie scene: [...] "When Dixie {{opens the door to}} Tad, she is stunned, because <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> dead," [...] says Pinker. [...] "She slams it in his face and then tries to escape. However, when Tad says, 'I love you,' she lets him in. Tad comforts her, and they become passionate, When Brian interrupts, Dixie tells a stunned Tad that she and Brian were married earlier that day. With much difficulty, Dixie informs Brian that things are nowhere near finished between her and Tad. Then she spills the news that Jamie is Tad's son. 'My what?' says a shocked Tad." ...|$|E
50|$|Mika later makes a cameo {{appearance}} in Justirisers Episode 35, when she injured Shouta because <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a stalker.
