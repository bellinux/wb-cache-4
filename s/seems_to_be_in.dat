5|$|Alucard {{appears in}} , {{a chapter of}} the Lords of Shadow reboot series. It is {{revealed}} that this version of Alucard was originally Trevor Belmont, the son of Gabriel and Marie Belmont, conceived before Gabriel {{was turned into a}} vampire and became the dark lord Dracula. Trevor grew up not knowing of his true origin until the Brotherhood of Light reveals to him who his parents were. Believing that his father Gabriel murdered his mother in cold blood, he decides to pursue him in the hopes of destroying him and bringing peace to the land. After infiltrating the castle, Trevor successfully fights his way to the throne room, where he confronts Dracula without letting on that he is his son, or telling Dracula his name. Although Trevor puts up a valiant effort, in the end he is defeated and stabbed in the heart with his own Combat Cross. Dying and gazing at the Mirror of Fate he finally realizes the truth of what really happened to Gabriel and feels sorry for him, calling him his father. Dracula, confused, gazes at the mirror as well and learns who Trevor was all along. Remorseful and horrified for killing his own son who had been unknown to him the entire time, Dracula desperately tries to bring him back to life by giving him his blood, which <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> vain. Dracula mourns over his loss, and places Trevor in a coffin with the name Alucard, since he never learned his son's real name. Many years later Alucard awakens, with pale white skin, white hair, and glowing orange eyes. He meets up with Dracula and his own son, Simon. Alucard tries to finish what he started, angry that his father turned him into a vampire. Dracula asks Alucard to join him in remaking the world and destroying the brotherhood, but Alucard refuses. Dracula proceeds to attack Simon for being a Belmont, wishing to end the Belmont bloodline due to his hatred of his past life. Alucard and Simon manage to defeat Dracula, and part ways as Dracula's castle crumbles.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} {{mention of}} Billy Beldham <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> {{a reference to}} two players called Beldum (sic) who represented Farnham Cricket Club in its earliest known match at Odiham on Tuesday, 13 August 1782. The source provides a scorecard. Farnham, who won, included J. Wells (probably James Wells), G. Beldum (almost certainly Beldham's elder brother George) and Beldum (no initial), who scored 1 and 16. If the latter was Billy Beldham, as is possible, {{he would have been}} 16 at the time and so this was his first known match.|$|E
25|$|The {{appearance}} before Caiaphas. Jesus is guarded by two soldiers. Caiaphas' servant has {{one hand on}} Jesus' shoulder and raises the other hand as if to hit him. A third soldier wears a turban and <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> charge of the other two. According to the Gospel of John (the event is not mentioned in other accounts) Jesus was first brought before Annas and after a brief questioning of him (John 18:19-23) {{was sent to the}} home of Caiaphas where some members of the Sanhedrin were gathered and the first trial of Jesus took place (Matt. 26:57-68).|$|E

Currently some of the etymologies are being referenced to an Urdu dictionary, so {{it should be noted that}} Gujarati's singular masculine o corresponds to Urdu ā, neuter ũ groups into ā as Urdu has no neuter gender, and Urdu's Persian z is not upheld in Gujarati and corresponds to j or jh. In contrast to modern Persian, the pronunciation of these loans into Gujarati and other Indo-Aryan languages, as well as that of Indian-recited Persian, <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> line with Persian spoken in Afghanistan and Central Asia, perhaps 500years ago.|$|E

25|$|Sometimes {{perpetual}} check {{can even}} save the draw {{in a very}} simplified ending. In Keres–Eliskases, Noordwijk 1938, (diagram at right), Black <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> desperate straits: he can win either of White's pawns, but then the other will queen, leaving White with a theoretical win in the queen versus rook ending. However, the players agreed to a draw after 56...Rb6+! 57. Kc1 Rh6! Because of continuous checks and mate threats from Black's rook, White will never have time to queen either pawn. For instance, 58.Kd1 Kd3 59.Ke1 Ke3 60.Kf1 Kf3 61.Kg1 Rg6+! 62.Kh2 Rh6+! 63.Kg1 Rg6+ 64.Kf1 Rh6! 65.Ke1 Ke3 66.Kd1 Kd3 67.Kc1 Kc3 68.Kb1 and now Black even has a choice of draws: (a) 68...Rb6+ 69.Ka2 Ra6+! or (b) 68...Rh1+ 69.Ka2 Rh2+ 70.Ka3 Rh1! 71.Ka4 Kc4 72.Ka5 Kc5 73.Ka4 (forced) Kc4 etc.|$|E
25|$|The biblical {{description}} of God's descent <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> {{conflict with the}} statement shortly after that God spoke to the Israelites from Heaven. While biblical scholars argue that these passages are from different sources, the Mekhilta argues that God had lowered the heavens and spread them over Sinai, and the Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer argues that a hole was torn in the heavens, and Sinai was torn away from {{the earth and the}} summit pushed through the hole. 'The heavens' could be a metaphor for clouds and the 'lake of fire' could be a metaphor for the lava-filled crater. Several bible critics have indicated that the smoke and fire reference from the Bible suggests that Mt Sinai was a volcano; despite the absence of ash. Other bible scholars have suggested that the description fits a storm especially as the Song of Deborah seems to allude to rain having occurred at the time. The biblical record notes the uniqueness of the event by stating that God spoke directly to the Israelite nation as a whole.|$|E
25|$|I find it {{amazing that}} he wrote this in the time period he did. It's very prophetic, it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> line with a more modern {{understanding}} of Jesus that readers of The Course in Miracles and Marianne Williamson are {{a large part of}} vocalizing. But even fundamentalists would enjoy this book… being how it is written from the opinion of 80 different points of view, many of which do proclaim him the Son of God. Ultimately, any view can be thoughtfully stimulating because the people of any opinion have personalities and background given that support why they view Jesus with their perspective. The overall impression I received from this beautiful prose is the beauty and message of Jesus, the devotion, admiration, gratitude and love inspired by him, and the grace which he exuded with confident compassion. And whether he was God, man, a combination of both that we all are potentially, or a combination we can only idolize with an envious self-debasing distorted form of humility, this book shows him to be nothing less than relevant to our comprehension.|$|E

25|$|Nofekh (נֹפֶךְ = in the masoretic text) / Anthrax (in the Septuagint) - while Anthrax {{simply means}} coal (presumably here {{referring}} to the colour of burning coal), the Vulgate here has Carbunculus, {{referring to the}} Carbuncle, which was red. Philo of Alexandria, when writing about this stone, says that it was red. He <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> agreement with Josephus, the LXX, and the Jerusalem Targum, the latter {{saying that it is}} כדכדנא, explained by Saadia Gaon as meaning karkand, a red variety of precious stone. Nofekh appears to be a loan word; it may derive from the Egyptian term m-f-k-t, referring to Malachite or Turquoise, both of which are a greenish blue; it may instead derive from lupakku, a term appearing in the Amarna letters, referring to a mineral of unknown colour which was sent in tribute to Akhnaten from Ashkalon. In classical rabbinical literature there is some debate between whether Nofekh was red or greenish blue; Exodus Rabbah and the second Jerusalem Targum favour it being red, while the Babylonian Targum and first Jerusalem Targum favour it being green.|$|E
500|$|The {{common toad}} <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> decline {{in part of}} its range, but overall is listed as being of [...] "least concern" [...] in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

It has long been associated in popular culture and literature with witchcraft.|$|E

As their leader, Stovepipe Bill, led them against a military raid, he sang the verses followed by the gang singing the chorus. Two years later, The Knickerbocker remarked, [...] "At this present moment, a certain ubiquitous person <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> {{the way of the}} whole people of these United States simultaneously."

500|$|Other {{characteristics}} of the painting are the unadorned dress, in which the eyes and hands have no competition from other details, the dramatic landscape background in which the world <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> a state of flux, the subdued colouring, and the extremely smooth nature of the painterly technique, employing oils laid on much like tempera and blended on the surface so that the brushstrokes are indistinguishable.

[...] The perfect state of preservation {{and the fact that}} there is no sign of repair or overpainting is rare in a panel painting of this date.|$|E
500|$|The {{expression}} [...] "asteroid belt" [...] {{came into}} {{use in the}} very early 1850s, although it is hard to pinpoint who coined the term. The first English use <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the 1850 translation (by E. C. Otté) of Alexander von Humboldt's Cosmos: [...] " [...] and the regular appearance, about the 13th of November and the 11th of August, of shooting stars, which probably form part of a belt of asteroids intersecting the Earth's orbit and moving with planetary velocity". Another early appearance occurred in Robert James Mann's A Guide to the Knowledge of the Heavens: [...] "The orbits of the asteroids are placed in a wide belt of space, extending between the extremes of [...] ". The American astronomer Benjamin Peirce seems to have adopted that terminology and to have been one of its promoters.|$|E

Both otter and frog seem to be extending their ranges to higher altitudes. The common toad cannot be legally sold or traded in the United Kingdom but there is a slow decline in toad numbers and it has therefore been declared a Biodiversity Action Plan priority species.
