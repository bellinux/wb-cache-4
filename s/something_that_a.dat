He also commended Liu Bei for appointing Huang Quan as a general after the latter's surrender, but remarked that Liu's actions were not sufficient to highlight Huang's virtues – <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> benevolent man should do. He provided {{an example of how}} King Wu of the Zhou dynasty paid homage to two officials known for their loyalty to the Shang dynasty – Bi Gan and Shang Rong – after he succeeded in overthrowing the Shang regime.|$|E

By the way, scat is <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> {{lot of people}} don't understand, and they begin {{to believe that the}} first scat numbers was ever done, was done by one of my {{hometown}} boys, Louie Armstrong. But I must take the credit away, since I know better. The first man that ever did a scat number in history of this country was a man from Vicksburg, Mississippi, by the name of Joe Sims, an old comedian. And from that, Tony Jackson and myself, and several more grabbed it in New Orleans. And found it was pretty good for an introduction of a song.|$|E
25|$|This is <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> Muslim {{gynecologist}} {{can tell}} you {{if you need to}} or not… There used to be a lady who used to do this for women, or, I mean, young girls. She is expected to cut only the tip of the sexual sensitive part in the girl, so that she is not hypersexually active. This is the purpose... you see in societies where circumcision of girls is completely prohibited, hypersexuality takes over the entire society, and a woman is not satisfied with one person, or two, or three. This, God forbid, is now happening even in Muslim societies where they prohibit circumcision. They use a mistake in practice to prohibit the tradition, and they end up causing a lot of damage on the extreme side of the sexual life of the woman.|$|E

25|$|In the 20th century, {{however, the}} Dutch colonial policy towards the East Indies changed and {{moved from the}} liberalist to neoliberalist {{point of view of}} how to deal with {{imperial}} possessions. The trend showed the desire to guard the rights of the natives and implement a better protection of colonies against outside threat. With this idea, the Netherlands began a program of greater integration in the Dutch East Indies. It was based primarily on the humanitarian idea of offering help and guidance to achieve peace and order. This was due to the assumption that subjects of the empire were not mature enough to build their own state or politics, and the mother country felt the obligation to educate them in the sphere and set an example. The new policy was called Assimilation and aimed to create a unity between Eastern and Western Dutchmen. The new harmony would be joined politically and nationally disregarding racial differences which could not weaken it. This however would mean the granting of political autonomy to the dependent Indonesia, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> large number of Dutchmen did not agree with primarily because of economic reasons. This cultural and national synthesis was never realized in as much as strong nationalistic feelings in the Dutch East Indies, and European affairs soon ripped the plan apart.|$|E
500|$|Striving {{to persevere}} {{is not merely}} <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> thing does in {{addition}} to other activities it might happen to undertake. Rather, striving is [...] "nothing but the actual essence of the thing" [...] (Ethics, part 3, prop. 7). Spinoza also uses the term conatus to refer to rudimentary concepts of inertia, as Descartes had earlier. Since a thing cannot be destroyed without the action of external forces, motion and rest, too, exist indefinitely until disturbed.|$|E

Jack McBrayer, who plays NBC page Kenneth Parcell, {{in regards to the}} environmental theme, said [...] "It's something that is relatable and is <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> lot of people are doing. Everybody is on board with greening up the place and being more environmentally friendly in real life. Every now and then people need to be reminded of things that can be done."

500|$|This {{approach}} was also adopted in Comptroller of Income Tax v. ACC (2010). The Court of Appeal held it is trite law that a quashing order will not lie unless a public authority has done <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> court can quash or, in other words, deprive of legal effect. It observed that [...] "a decision need {{not in itself}} have a direct legal effect or consequence {{before it can be}} quashed. A decision which operates as a prerequisite to or a step in a process capable of altering rights, interests or liabilities may also be the subject of a quashing order." [...] The Court eventually concluded that, [...] "a quashing order will only lie against decisions which have some form of actual or ostensible legal effect, whether direct or indirect. A mere opinion clearly does not fall within this category." ...|$|E
500|$|The lyrical themes on {{the album}} deal with issues of spirituality, morality, and self-examination. Vedder said, [...] "I think there's a little self-examination in those songs, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> {{lot of my friends}} are going through too, as they {{approach}} 30." [...] Ament said, [...] "In some ways, it's like the band's story. It's about growing up." [...] The lyrics of [...] "Hail, Hail" [...] refer to two people in a troubled relationship struggling to hold it together. Vedder has said that he wrote the song [...] "Off He Goes" [...] about himself and how he is a [...] "shit friend," [...] adding, [...] "I'll show up and everything's great and then all of the sudden I'm outta there..." [...] "Lukin" [...] is about the [...] "pretty intense stalker problem," [...] Vedder faced during the mid-1990s. [...] "Around the Bend" [...] was written by Vedder as a lullaby that Irons could sing to his son.|$|E
500|$|Recording {{sessions}} for the album {{took place at}} the following recording studios—4220 Studios, Conway Recording Studios, and East West Studios in Hollywood, Instrument Zoo Studios in Miami, Jungle City Studios and Oven Studios in New York City, Record One in Sherman Oaks, and Westlake Studios in Los Angeles. Nas worked with several musicians, including Amy Winehouse, Mary J. Blige, James Poyser, Anthony Hamilton, Miguel, Large Professor, and Hal Ritson, among others. For the album, Nas wanted the production to complement his lyrics' nostalgic themes with 1980s hip hop influences. He primarily worked with hip hop producers No I.D. and Salaam Remi, a frequent collaborator of Nas. Remi said that he wanted his production [...] "to be <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> mumble-mouth rapper can’t rap on. You better have something to say and be speaking up." [...] Along with producer Swizz Beatz, No I.D. and Nas related to the latter's lyrics concerning divorce during the recording sessions. During the sessions, Nas recorded the song [...] "No Such Thing as White Jesus" [...] with singer Frank Ocean and producer Hit Boy, who misplaced the track while sorting through music he had produced for Jay-Z and Kanye West's album Watch the Throne (2011). Although he later recovered it, the song was not included on Life Is Good.|$|E

[...] "It's something that we're doing for people who care to figure it out and follow it, but it's not <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> viewer has to consider when they watch the show." [...] Abrams also revealed that the seemingly unrelated frogs which have the Greek letter Phi (Φ) imprinted on their back appeared in promos for the show have significance {{within the context of the}} series, saying [...] "it's part of the code of the show." [...] The glyph code was cracked by an editor at the technology site Ars Technica, who discovered it to be a simple substitution cipher used to spell out a single thematic word for each episode; for example, the pilot episode's eight glyphs spell out the word [...] "observer". Whether there is a further second-order code to be solved remains to be seen. Additionally, the glyphs are representative of some of the means by which Walter solves a case (such as the moth/butterfly from [...] "Johari Window", the seahorse strain of DNA from [...] "The Bishop Revival"). In [...] "Jacksonville", behind Walter as he speaks to Olivia about her treatment where the nootropic Cortexiphan was first studied as a trial, each of the glyphs is clearly visible on the daycare wall. An episode-by-episode key to the various glyphs was made available on Fringepedia.|$|E
