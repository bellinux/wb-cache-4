5|$|In {{addition}} to the graves, several buildings stood within the cemetery.

A smaller grubenhaus – a type of sunken building – which {{is thought to have}} been used as a mortuary chapel was located close by in the central area of the cemetery. An Iron Age roundhouse had also once been located within the north-west quadrant but was no longer standing at the time the cemetery was laid out. All of these buildings would have <b>stood</b> <b>on</b> the crest of a ridge, and would have been especially prominent to travelers arriving from the south.|$|E

5|$|The 37mm M5 gun had a {{manually}} operated breechblock. The tank commander doubled as loader, {{like many other}} tanks of the time. There was no turret basket in the M2A4 light tank; the commander <b>stood</b> <b>on</b> the right side, while the gunner <b>stood</b> <b>on</b> the left side. The commander turned the turret onto {{the general direction of}} target. The gunner would then bring the target into the M5 telescopic sight. The M20 combination mount had 20° of traverse; this could either be by a handwheel driving the rack and pinion traverse gear mechanism or pressure on the gunners shoulder rest overcoming the friction in the mechanism. Depression and elevation of the gun was either through a geared mechanism or, with the gears disengaged, free through movement of the gunner's shoulder rest.|$|E
