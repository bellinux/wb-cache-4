60|$|Never was {{popularity}} more unalloyed than Vetranio's.

Munificent without assumption, successful without pride, he obliged {{with grace and}} shone with <b>safety.</b> <b>People</b> enjoyed his hospitality, for they {{knew that it was}} disinterested; and admired his acquirements, for they felt that they were unobtrusive. Sometimes (as in his dialogue with the Cynic) the whim of the moment, or the sting of a sarcasm, drew from him a hint at his station, or a display of his eccentricities; but, as he was always the first soon afterwards to lead the laugh at his own outbreak, his credit as a noble suffered nothing by his infirmity as a man. Gaily and attractively he moved in all grades of the society of his age, winning his social laurels in every rank, without making a rival to dispute their possession, or an enemy to detract from their value.|$|E

50|$|In Northern Ireland, {{towns and}} cities have long been {{segregated}} along ethnic, religious and political lines. Northern Ireland's two main communities are its Irish nationalist-republican community (who mainly self-identify as Irish or Catholic) and its unionist-loyalist community (who mainly self-identify as British or Protestant). Ghettos emerged in Belfast during the riots that accompanied the Irish War of Independence. For <b>safety,</b> <b>people</b> fled to areas where their community was the majority.

5000|$|Location {{of housing}} is a {{determinant}} of a person's {{access to the}} job market, transportation, education, healthcare, and <b>safety.</b> <b>People</b> residing in neighborhoods with high concentrations of low-income and minority households experience higher mortality risks, poor health services, high rates of teenage pregnancy, and high crime rates. These neighborhoods also experience higher rates of unemployment, and {{lack of access to}} job networks and transportation, which prevents households from fully gaining and accessing employment opportunities. The result of isolation and segregation of minority and the economically disadvantaged is increased racial and income inequality, which in turn reinforces segregation. In 2014, the Child Opportunity Index measures very high to very low opportunity comparing race and ethnicity in the 100 largest US metropolitan areas in the US to compare inequalities and residential segregation.|$|E

50|$|A lava bench is a {{volcanic}} landform with a horizontal surface raised above {{the level of}} the surrounding area. They are created when molten lava travels away from {{a volcanic}} vent and expands an old shoreline. This is the process that creates new land in the ocean that life can eventually grow on. The Hawaiian islands are an example of land that was formed this way, and the Big Island is currently still expanding due to lava benches. The Kilauea Volcano releases lava that flows down the slope of the volcano and eventually encounters the ocean; this lava flow hardens when it comes into contact with the significantly cooler water of the ocean and forms an unstable lava bench. Eventually, when the material beneath the lava bench stabilizes, it become stable land that has been added to the island. If a newly formed lava bench rests on sediments, it may pose hazards due to its extremely unstable structure. Oftentimes, these benches are so unstable that they collapse into the sea, exposing the water to the hot lava on the interior of the bench and releasing acres of land into the ocean. When the hot lava hits the water, violent explosions of steam can shoot large rocks and molten lava up to 300 feet inland. These collapses are extremely dangerous because they can happen without warning, and anyone or anything on the bench will be caught in the collapse. For <b>safety,</b> <b>people</b> are advised not to walk on lava benches because of their unstable nature, and they must maintain a safe distance from the lava bench.|$|E

This predisposition is known as hindsight bias. However, putting hindsight bias aside, one should consid-er the discussion in the media raised by the recent Ger-manwings Flight 9525 air accident from a medical point of view. The probability that aircrafts are used to assist suicide is exceedingly low. We have recently estimated that suicide accounts for about 0. 3 % of fatal accident cases in general aviation, which would be approximately 8 cases in the USA between 2003 - 2012 (1); but this figure {{is likely to be}} even lower in commercial air transport.

30|$|Psychological safety {{refers to}} a shared belief held by members {{of a team that}} the team is a safe place for {{interpersonal}} risk taking (Carroll and Edmondson 2002; Edmondson 1999; for a review see Edmondson and Lei 2014). It involves but goes beyond interpersonal trust and mutual respect. For example, in a team {{with a high level of}} psychological <b>safety</b> <b>people</b> will not be rejected for making a mistake. The team climate is characterized by a sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass or punish someone for admitting failures or insecurities. Although psychological safety can be studied at the individual, team, and organizational level, some findings suggest that psychological safety is essentially a team-level phenomenon: Edmondson and Lei (2014), for instance, report significant differences in the interpersonal climate of psychological safety between teams within the same organization.|$|E
40|$|Patient safety {{has been}} the buzzword for {{numerous}} initiatives in the past decade, {{but much of the}} focus has been on hospital care, where the risk for medication errors, falls, iatrogenic in-fections, wrong-site surgery, and other incidents of patient harm is high. But in fact, ambulatory care settings are where patients—those with cancer perhaps more than others—receive the majority of their health care. This article highlights high-risk areas of oncology practice and offers strategies for enhanc-ing patient safety. Creating a culture of patient safety is not done by going through a checklist, although assessing your office systems in light of risk is important (see “Practice Assessment ” in the Ad-ditional Resources box).

It also tries to examine the impact of these unethical practices on their respective employee performance, their employee relations, company credibility, and on the society. Lessons can be learned from these experiences and preventive measures can be applied across international borders to improve business conduct in other developing economies.

Hence the brand reputation of Toyota’s was crashed.

40|$|Original title: Gelukkig in een verpleeghuis? Life in Dutch {{residential}} {{nursing and}} care homes is changing. The number of frail older {{persons in the}} Netherlands is increasing. Older people are increasingly living independently for longer, and only the most frail older persons move to a nursing or care home. Media reports about the care provided in these nursing and care homes are not always universally positive and, {{partly as a result}} of those reports, Dutch people are concerned about the quality of care and the lives of residents. To compile this report, SCP researchers conducted extensive interviews with more than 950 residents of Dutch nursing and care homes located throughout the country. They asked residents about their experiences and opinions regarding the quality of their lives (happiness, loneliness, meaning of life) and the quality of the care they receive (privacy, autonomy, being treated with respect, <b>safety).</b> <b>People</b> with severe dementia could of course not be interviewed independently, and in the report ‘Older people in nursing and care homes’ (‘Ouderen in verpleeghuizen en verzorgingshuizen’), this latter group are described by their family members and carers.
