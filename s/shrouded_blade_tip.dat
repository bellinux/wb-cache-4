40|$|Gas turbine {{compressor}} and turbine <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> clearance (i. e., the {{radial distance}} between the <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> of an axial compressor or turbine and the containment structure) is a major contributing factor to gas path sealing, and can significantly affect engine efficiency and operational temperature. This paper details {{the creation of a}} generic but realistic high pressure turbine tip clearance model that may be used to facilitate active tip clearance control system research. This model uses a first principles approach to approximate thermal and mechanical deformations of the turbine system, taking into account the rotor, <b>shroud,</b> and <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> components. Validation of the tip clearance model shows that the results are realistic and reflect values found in literature. In addition, this model has been integrated with a gas turbine engine simulation, creating a platform to explore engine performance as tip clearance is adjusted. Results from the integrated model explore the effects of tip clearance on engine operation and highlight advantages of tip clearance management...|$|R

40|$|To {{clarify the}} {{behavior}} of the <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> vortices of a wind turbine equipped with a brimmed-diffuser shroud, called a &# 8220;Wind-Lens turbine&# 8221;, we conducted a three-dimensional numerical simulation using a large eddy simulation (LES). Since this unique wind turbine consists of not only rotating blades but also a diffuser shroud with a broad-ring brim at the exit periphery, the flow field around the turbine is highly complex and unsteady. Previously, our research group conducted numerical simulations using an actuator-disc approximation, in which the rotating blades were simply modeled as an external force on the fluid. Therefore, the detailed flow patterns around the rotating <b>blades</b> and the <b>shroud,</b> including the <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> vortices, could not be simulated. Instead of an actuator-disc approximation, we used a moving boundary technique in the present CFD simulation to simulate the flow around a rotating blade in order to focus especially on <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> vortices. The simulation results showed a pair of vortices consisting of a <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> vortex and a counter-rotating vortex which was generated between the <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> and the inner surface of the diffuser. Since these vortices interacted with each other, the <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> vortex was weakened by the counter-rotating vortex.

40|$|According to {{the theory}} {{presented}} by the authors, the tip clearance loss of an unshrouded centrifugal impeller is attributed to two parts; one is the drag due to the leakage flow through the <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> clearance {{and the other is}} the pressure loss to support the fluid in the thin annular clearance space between the <b>shroud</b> and the <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> against the pressure gradient in the meridional plane without blades. The former is proportional to the leakage flow or the contraction coefficient α of leakage flow. The authors have conducted performance tests of an impeller with sixteen backward leaning blades in three configurations of the <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> : round edge, sharp square edge and edge with an end plate. The experimental tip clearance effects can be predicted by the theory assuming α= 0. 91, 0. 73 and 0. 53, respectively, and if the tip clearance ratio at the impeller exit is 0. 1, the impeller efficiency is improved by 1. 5 percent by reducing α from 0. 91 to 0. 53...|$|R
40|$|A ring fan is a {{propeller}} fan that applies an axial-flow impeller with a ring-shaped <b>shroud</b> on the <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> side. In this study, the entire flow {{field of the}} ring fan is simulated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD); {{the accuracy of the}} CFD is verified through a comparison with the aerodynamic characteristics of a {{propeller fan}} of current model. Moreover, the aerodynamic noise generated by the fan is predicted {{on the basis of the}} wake characteristics. The aerodynamic characteristic of the ring fan based on CFD can represent qualitatively the variation in the measured value. The main flow domain of the ring fan is formed at the tip side of the <b>blade</b> because <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> vortex is not formed at that location. Therefore, the relative velocity of the ring fan is increased by the circumferential velocity. The sound pressure levels of the ring fan within the frequency band of less than 200 Hz are larger than that of the propeller fan. In the analysis of the wake characteristics, it revealed that Karman vortex shedding occurred in the main flow domain in the frequency domain lower than 200 Hz; the aerodynamic noise of the ring fan in the vortex shedding frequency enlarges due to increase in the relative velocity and the velocity fluctuation...|$|R

40|$|Ring fan is a {{propeller}} fan that applies an axial-flow impeller with a ring-shaped <b>shroud</b> on the <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> side. The fan has been expected {{not only to}} improve the aerodynamic characteristics but also to reduce the aerodynamic noise. In this study, the influence of wake on aerodynamic noise of a ring fan has been discussed by comparison with {{the characteristics of a}} current {{propeller fan}}. The blade rotating noise was assumed for the mechanism of the discrete frequency noise in the ring fan. Moreover, the theory for the estimation of the blade rotating noise based on the wake characteristics has been proposed. The overall noise level of the ring fan was decreased 3 dB than that of the propeller fan due to the discrete frequency noise in the first harmonics. As a result of CFD analysis, it is considered that the discrete frequency noise was generated from the blade surface of the impeller by the periodic pressure fluctuation synchronizing with the blade passing frequency. According with measured flow patterns, the relative velocity of the ring fan became slightly high than the propeller fan whereas the velocity fluctuation of the ring fan decreased approximately 71 % than that of the propeller fan in the near wake. From results of the estimation based on the proposed theory of the aerodynamic noise, it can be considered that the discrete frequency noise of the ring fan was decreased by the perturbation of the jet-wake flow in the wake...|$|R

The wingtips varied in taper ratio (1. 0, 0. 6, and 0. 3) and in sweep angle (0, 20, 30, 35, and 45 deg). The wingtips were tested separately (wingtip only configuration) and while mounted on a semi-span wing. The quarter-chord sweep angle of the wing was varied from 30 deg forward sweep, to unswept, to 30 deg. aft sweep.

A numerical study for a highly loaded transonic compressor rotor has been conducted to understand the effect of varying the location of <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> winglet on the performance of the rotor. Two kinds of tip winglet were designed and investigated. The effects of <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> winglet on the compressor overall performance, stability and tip flow structure were presented and discussed.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a joint computational and experimental {{investigation into the}} heat transfer to unshrouded turbine <b>blade</b> <b>tips</b> suitable for use in high bypass ratio, large civil aviation turbofan engines. Both the heat transfer to the <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> and the over-tip leakage flow over the <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> are characterised, as each has a profound influence on overall engine efficiency. The study {{is divided into two}} sections; in the first, computational simulations of a very large scale, low speed linear cascade with a flat <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> were conducted. These simulations were validated against experimental data collected by Palafox (2006). A thorough assessment of turbulence models and minimum meshing requirements was performed. The standard k-ω and standard k-ϵ turbulence models significantly overpredicted the turbulence levels within the tip gap. The other models were very similar in performance; the SST k-ω and realisable k-ϵ models were found to be the most suitable for the flow environment. The second section documents the development and testing of a novel hybrid <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> design, the squealet tip, which seeks to combine the known benefits of winglet and double squealer tips. The development of the external geometry was performed primarily through engine-representative CFD simulations at a range of tip gaps from 0. 45 % to 1. 34 % blade chord. The squealet tip was found to have a similar aerodynamic sensitivity to tip clearance as a baseline double squealer tip, with a tip gap efficiency exchange rate of 2. 03, although this was 18 % greater than the alternative winglet tip. The squealet tip displayed higher predicted stage efficiency than the winglet tip over the majority of the range of tip clearances investigated, however. The overall heat load was reduced by 14 % compared with the winglet tip but increased by 28 % over the double squealer tip, primarily due to the change in wetted surface area. The predicted local heat transfer coefficients were similar across all geometries. A realistic internal cooling plenum and an array of <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> cooling holes were subsequently added to the squealet tip geometry and the cooling configuration refined by the selective sealing of cooling holes. Film cooling performance was largely assessed by the predicted adiabatic wall temperature distributions. A viable cooling scheme which reduced the cooling air requirement by 38 % was achieved, compared to the initial case which had all cooling holes open. This was associated with just a 7 % increase in <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> heat flux and no penalty in peak temperature on the <b>blade</b> <b>tip.</b> Film cooling air ejected from holes on the blade suction side was swept away from the <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> region, making the squealet rim at the crown of the blade particularly challenging to cool. It was demonstrated that this region could be cooled effectively by ballistic cooling from holes located on the <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> cavity floor, although this was expensive in terms of the mass flow rate of cooling air required. The computational results were reinforced with experimental data collected in a transonic linear cascade. Downstream aerodynamic loss measurements were taken for a linearised version of the squealet tip design without cooling at nominal tip gaps of 0. 45 %, 0. 89 % and 1. 34 % blade chord, which was compared to similar data taken by O’Dowd (2010) for flat and winglet tips. The squealet was seen to have a similar aerodynamic loss to the flat tip and a reduced loss compared with the winglet tip. Full surface heat transfer measurements were taken for the uncooled squealet tip, at tip gaps of 0. 89 % and 1. 34 % blade chord, and for two configurations of the cooled squealet tip, at a tip clearance of 0. 89 % blade chord. The qualitative similarity between the measured heat transfer distributions and the those predicted by the engine-representative CFD simulations was good. A CFD simulation of the uncooled linear cascade environment at the 1. 34 % <b>blade</b> chord <b>tip</b> clearance was performed using a single blade with translationally periodic boundary conditions. The predicted size of the over-tip leakage vortex was smaller than had been measured, resulting in a large underprediction in the magnitude of the downstream area-averaged aerodynamic loss. The magnitudes of the predicted <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> Nusselt number distribution were similar to those produced by the engine-representative CFD simulations and lower than that measured experimentally. Differences {{in the shape of the}} Nusselt number distribution were observed in the vicinity of regions of separated and reattaching flow, but other salient features were replicated in the computational data. The squealet tip has been shown to be a promising, viable unshrouded <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> design with an aerodynamic performance similar to the double squealer tip but is more amenable to film cooling. It is significantly lighter than a winglet tip and incurs a reduced thermal load. The squealet tip design can now be developed into a <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> geometry for use in real engines to provide an alternative to <b>shrouded</b> turbine <b>blades</b> and current unshrouded <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> designs. A commercial CFD solver, Fluent 6. 3, was shown to capture <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> heat transfer and over-tip leakage flow sufficiently well to be a useful design guide. However, the sensitivity of the flow structure (and hence, heat transfer) in the forward part of the <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> cavity suggests that physical testing cannot be eliminated from the design process entirely.

The concept developed opti-mizes a datum blade by means of profiled endplates at the tip, reducing fan noise by changing the tip leakage flow behaviour.

Within the STAR (Smart Twisting Active Rotor) hover test, an active twist rotor was tested in the rotor preparation hall at DLR Braunschweig. The rotor blades were actuated with frequencies of 1 /rev – 5 /rev and peak torsion amplitudes of up to 2 °. This paper describes aerodynamic results from the hover test based on time-resolved stereoscopic PIV measurements at the forward <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> position. Continuous time series of flow fields behind the <b>blade</b> <b>tips</b> were evaluated to investigate the young <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> vortices between 3. 56 ° and 45. 74 ° of vortex age. For the unactuated baseline case, the vortex trajectory, <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> scattering, and temporal development of the peak axial and swirl velocity are discussed. The effects of the active twist actuation on the <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> vortices are examined for the 1 /rev and 3 /rev actuation frequencies. The variation of the vortex trajectories is dominated by the <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> deflection for the 1 /rev actuation, and by the torsion of the <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> for the 3 /rev actuation. The 3 /rev actuation reduces the initial peak swirl velocity by up to 35 % compared to the baseline case. The actuation with the control phase angles 225 ° – 315 ° achieves a strong variation of the vortex trajectories with a vertical deviation of up to 2. 6 %R below the rotor tip path plane.

This thesis investigates two concepts, the adaptive blade root and the adaptive <b>blade</b> <b>tip,</b> allowing direct adaptive shape control of the main rotor areas that are the main sources of helicopter noise and vibration.

40|$|An {{important}} {{challenge facing}} {{the design of}} turbodynamic ventricular assist devices (VADs) intended for long-term support is the optimization of the flow path geometry to maximize hydraulic performance while minimizing shear-stress-induced hemolysis and thrombosis. For unshrouded centrifugal, mixed-flow and axial-flow blood pumps, the complex flow patterns within the <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> clearance between the lengthwise upper surface of the rotating impeller blades and the stationary pump housing have a dramatic effect on both the hydrodynamic performance and the blood damage production. Detailed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses were performed in this study to investigate such flow behavior in <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> clearance region for a centrifugal blood pump representing a scaled-up version of a prototype pediatric VAD. Nominal flow conditions were analyzed at a flow rate of 2. 5 L/min and rotor speed of 3000 rpm with three <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> clearances of 50, 100, and 200 microm. CFD simulations predicted {{a decrease in the}} averaged tip leakage flow rate and an increase in pump head and axial thrust with decreasing <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> clearances from 200 to 50 microm. The predicted hemolysis, however, exhibited a unimodal relationship, having a minimum at 100 microm compared to 50 microm and 200 microm. Experimental data corroborate these predictions. Detailed flow patterns observed in this study revealed interesting fluid dynamic features associated with the <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> clearances, such as the generation and dissipation of tip leakage vortex and its interaction with the primary flow in the blade-blade passages. Quantitative calculations suggested the existence of an optimal <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> clearance by which hydraulic efficiency can be maximized and hemolysis minimized...|$|R
