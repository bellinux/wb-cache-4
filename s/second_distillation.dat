In this paper the fate of quinoxyfen residues from vine to wine and in their processing products was studied. After the last of four applications at the recommended rate, 0. 38 mg/kg of residue was found on the grapes, which is under the legal limit fixed in Italy (0. 5 mg/kg). The degradation rate was according to a pseudo-first-order kinetics (r = 0. 964) and the half-life was 7. 24 days. Vinification was carried out with and without maceration. During the vinifications without maceration < 50 % of the residues passed from the grapes to the musts. Separation of the lees (8 %) from the must by centrifugation caused no detectable residues in centrifuged must. At the end of fermentation with and without maceration no quinoxyfen residues were determinable in the wine. No effect on the alcoholic or malolactic fermentation was observed even in the presence of higher quinoxyfen concentrations than those found in the grapes at harvest time. During fermentation, the yeasts partially degraded the pesticides and completly adsorbed them. Bacteria, on the other hand, do not have any degradative effect on the pesticides. The raisins obtained by sun-drying did not contain any residues, whereas those obtained by oven-drying show the same amount of residues as in the fresh grapes. During the sun-drying process the fruit weight decreased by a factor of 4; the decrease in the oven-drying was equivalent. Samples of dregs and liquid lees, fortified with high levels of quinoxyfen, were double-distilled.

The <b>second</b> is a <b>distillation</b> residue from refining of cyclohexanol.

Typically, SO, removal efficiency can be increased from less than 80 % to over 90 %. AGS is currently being used at several public utility plants to bring the existing scrubbers into compliance. The unused portion of AGS is incinerated in the adipic manufacturing plant boilers as a waste disposal and energy recovery enhancement. An ion exchange process is used to remove metals as a pretreatment. A portion of the AGS stream is also used to convert a waste distillation residue from cyclohexanol manufacture into a clean boiler fuel.

Carbolic acid is produced in the <b>second</b> fraction of <b>distillation</b> and is often distilled into what {{is referred to as}} [...] "carbolic oil".Commercial creosote will contain substances from six groups. The two groups occur in the greatest amounts and are the products of the distillation process—the [...] "tar acids", which distill below 205 °C and consist mainly of phenols, cresols, and xylenols, including carbolic acid—and aromatic hydrocarbons, which divide into naphthalenes, which distill approximately between 205° and 255 °C, and constituents of an anthracene nature, which distill above 255 °C. The quantity of each varies based on the quality of tar and temperatures used, but generally, the tar acids won't exceed 5%, the naphthalenes will make up 15 to 50%, and the anthracenes will make up 45% to 70%. The hydrocarbons are mainly aromatic; derivatives of benzene and related cyclic compounds such as naphthalene, anthracene, phenanthrene, acenapthene, and fluorene. Creosotes from vertical-retort and low temperature tars contain, in addition, some paraffinic and olefinic hydrocarbons. The tar-acid content also depends on the source of the tar—it may be less than 3% in creosote from coke-oven tar and as high as 32% in creosote from vertical retort tar. All of these have antiseptic properties. The tar acids are the strongest antiseptics but have the highest degree of solubility in water and are the most volatile; so, like with wood-tar creosote, phenols are not the most valued component, as by themselves they would lend to being poor preservatives. In addition, creosote will contain several products naturally occurring in coal—nitrogen-containing heterocycles, such as acridines, carbazoles, and quinolines, referred to as the [...] "tar bases" [...] and generally make up about 3% of the creosote—sulfur-containing heterocycles, generally benzothiophenes—and oxygen-containing heterocycles, dibenzofurans. Lastly, creosote will contain a small number of aromatic amines produced by the other substances during the distillation process and likely resulting from a combination of thermolysis and hydrogenation. The tar bases are often extracted by washing the creosote with aqueous mineral acid, although they're also suggested to have antiseptic ability similar to the tar acids.|$|R
