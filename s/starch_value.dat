A 38 % crude protein diet was fed to the fish at 3 % body weight per day (p. w. d- 1) during the toxicity and 5 % during the recovery period. The protein value (PV) increased as the BLCO concentration increased up to 75 µlg- 1 at recovery phase and vis-versa at toxicity phase. This {{could be due to}} immune response mechanism which eventually dropped at recovery phase. The <b>starch</b> <b>value</b> (SV) and unsaponification values (USPV) were not affected, the saponification value (SPV) only increased between 25. 00 and 0. 0 µlg- 1 and declined at 75 µlg- 1.

Of the four tissues values (PV, SV, SPV and USPV) of fish tested, only the USPV was not significantly different (P> 0. 05) among the fish injected with the different concentrations of BLCO. The 0 and 25 µlg- 1 has the same effect on mortality rate. Similar mortality values of the fish recorded with the 25 µlg- 1 BLCO and the control suggests that this oil dosage was probably inadequate to alter the mortality rates of C. gariepinus juveniles.

Soy sauce was one of fermentation liquid products which had flavor and aroma as meat, and had high nutrition value. The aims of the research were (i) to analyze nutrition value in seeds, koji and moromi including carbohydrate, proteins and lipids and (ii) to know the potency of L. leucocephala as raw material in production of soy sauce by fermentationmethod with Aspergillus oryzae as inoculums. Fermentation was one of soy sauce production processes that involved two steps: (i) the solid stage fermentation and (ii) the brine fermentation. L. leucocephala was fermented with A. oryzae for 3 - 5 days to produce koji. Koji was soaked in salt solution 20 % (1 : 5 b/v) then it was fermented for 30 days to produce moromi. Nutritional values in L. leucocephala seeds, koji, and moromi was analyzed, i. e. carbohydrate (sugar reduction and starch), protein, and lipids. Moromi filtrate was added by spices to Leucaena sauce. Finally, preferable Leucaena sauce was tested including flavor, aroma, and color. Preferable data was analyzed by non-parametric statistic; it was Friedman Test and followed Wilcoxon Ranking Method.

40|$|Starch is {{the largest}} {{constituent}} in diets for pigs and its structure is considered {{to have a great}} impact on the rate of starch digestion. Despite several works showing starch is digested at varying rates in vitro, limited information exist on the characterization of single feedstuffs commonly utilized in pig nutrition through a predicted glycemic index (pGI) approach. Our objectives were: (1) to assess the variability of in vitro starch digestibility of cereal grains as a mean of screening samples by involving a pGI approach, (2) to investigate the role of heat processing and amylose level on pGI and (3) to investigate relationships among pGI, chemical variables and Englyst starch fractions. For this purpose, 137 samples of cereal grains [normal and low-amylose and heat processed (NA, LA and HP, respectively) ] were evaluated using an in vitro method based on the Englyst-assay for nutritional classification of starch and a non-linear model was used to fit starch digestibility data. Starch digestion potential greatly differed among cereal grains (P< 0. 05). Consequently, pGI values differed (P< 0. 05), ranging from 15. 9 for sorghum to 106. 9 for HP rice. In general, higher pGI scores were recorded for HP and LA cereals than respective NA counterparts (P< 0. 05). Differences (P< 0. 05) were measured both in the rate of starch digestion (ranging from 0. 017 /min for NA maize to 0. 182 /min for HP rice) and in the starch digestible fractions. In particular, rapidly digestible starch (RDS) ranged from 119 g/kg dry matter (DM) for sorghum to 704 g/kg DM for HP rice, whereas resistant starch (RS) ranged from 32 g/kg DM for HP barley to 275 g/kg DM for sorghum. The loading plots of principal component (PC) analysis revealed significant relationships between pGI and variables of interest, showing that both chemical compositions and starch fractions could affect the pGI. In particular, the PC analysis conducted on all samples revealed that pGI was positively related with glucose and RDS (P< 0. 05) and negatively related to crude lipid, slowly digestible starch and RS (P< 0. 05) contents.

40|$|In the agro-food industry, {{there is}} an {{increasing}} demand for non-destructive, fast and cost-efficient methods for the objective determination of product quality. Several parameters influence {{the quality of a}} product, while the importance of each of these parameters may vary amongst people. Optical measurement techniques are often used because of their non-destructive nature. However, the robust determination of both chemical and physical quality attributes remains difficult. In this work, a non-destructive determination of quality was performed using laser scatter imaging. This technique allows to obtain more information on both the absorption and scattering of light, by retrieving spatial information. The bulk optical properties (bulk absorption coefficient, bulk scattering coefficient and scattering anisotropy factor) are used to characterize absorption and scattering properties. The absorption of light is related to the chemical composition of a product, like present pigments, water or sugars. Scattering of light is more related to the physical structure, possibly allowing to retrieve more information on physical quality attributes, like firmness, tenderness or porosity. Optical properties of light were derived from the obtained scatter images using a data-based modelling technique, possibly allowing a better prediction of product quality. This approach was tested in two case studies, apples and bovine meat, selected because of their economic importance for Belgium. First, a hyperspectral laser scatter imaging (HLSI) system was developed. A combination of a supercontinuum laser with monochromator was used to illuminate samples with monochromatic light in the 550 nm to 1000 nm range, while a CCD camera was used to take images of the diffuse reflectance glow spots. From this glow spots, a diffuse reflectance profile with the light intensity relative to the distance from the point illumination was obtained. Models were constructed to optimize the detector size and the source-detector distance, estimating different quality parameters of Braeburn apples. A detector size of 0. 82 mm was found to be adequate for the estimation of all parameters, including the <b>starch</b> <b>value,</b> firmness, SSC and Streif index. Different source-detector distances were found to be of importance for predicting different quality traits. Photons exiting the sample closer to the point illumination, which have interacted less with the sample, were more important for SSC prediction, while the prediction of physical parameters like firmness relied on photons which had more interaction with the sample. Moreover, using variable selection, the wavelength regions of pigment and water absorption were found to be most informative. A classification of apples into ripeness classes based on these models was possible, with a misclassification rate of 12. 5 %. Nevertheless, these models still used mixed information, including both the effects of absorption and scattering. Using the double integrating spheres (DIS), the golden standard method for determining bulk optical properties (BOP), the interaction of light with both apple and bovine meat samples was studied. Both the apple skin and cortex were studied separately during maturation of bi-colored (Braeburn and Kanzi) and green cultivars (Greenstar). The bulk absorption coefficient µa of the skin showed features of anthocyanins at 550 nm, chlorophyll at 678 nm and water at 970 nm, 1200 nm and 1450 nm, while the µa of the cortex showed an overall lower absorption attributed to carotenoids, chlorophyll and water. During maturation of apples, an increase in the absorption by anthocyanins was observed in the red cultivar’s skin, while a decrease in absorption by chlorophyll was observed in the cortex. Both the bulk scattering coefficient µs and anisotropy factor g of the skin were significantly higher in comparison to the cortex. Both skin and cortex were found to be highly forward scattering with anisotropy factors above 0. 9 in the entire wavelength range between 500 nm and 1850 nm. During maturation, no clear evolutions in the anisotropy factor were observed, while µs decreased in the fruit cortex. It was hypothesized that the shape and size of the scattering particles hardly changed during maturation. The DIS analysis showed changes in the optical properties of apple during maturation. This indicates that the non-destructive estimation of BOP could be beneficial in determining apple quality. To go from scatter images towards an estimation of the optical properties, a data-based model was used. To train this model, a set of optical phantoms with known optical properties was measured using the HLSI system. These diffuse reflectance measurements, in combination with the BOP from the DIS, were used as an input for a metamodel, linking the BOP to diffuse reflectance profiles. The metamodel showed a good performance for a set of validation phantoms, with an R 2 V of 0. 9977 and 0. 957 in combination with an RMSEV of 0. 20 cm- 1 and 3. 21 cm- 1, for respectively µa and µs’. Nevertheless, at wavelengths with extreme BOP values, the predictions were less accurate. The prediction of apple BOP showed an expected course for the µa spectra, with absorption features of anthocyanin, chlorophyll and water. However, an incomplete separation between µa and µs’ was obtained, as µs’ still showed some distinct absorption features. Nevertheless, at wavelengths with low absorption, the estimation of µs’ was according to expectations. In addition, the same evolutions in BOP as found with the DIS setup were also found with the non-destructive HLSI technique. Though, no clear relation was obtained between apple quality and the estimated BOP. Possibly, the low variability of both SSC and firmness during maturation, together with a high variability amongst apples from the same harvest day, could have complicated the prediction models. Moreover, still mostly information on the changes of apple pigments was used in the models. Next, two bovine muscles were measured using the DIS as well. Both the longissimus lumborum (LL) and the biceps femoris (BF) were considered, while the BF was further divided into an outer and inner part, due to two-toning. Clear absorption features of myoglobin, mainly oxymyoglobin at 544 nm and 582 nm, and water were found in the µa spectra. A higher absorption of myoglobin was found in the BF samples, while also a higher µs and a lower g was found in this muscle compared to the LL. The inner and outer BF showed significant scattering differences, possibly related to an increased degree of protein denaturation in the inner BF. During wet aging, when meat tenderness increases, a decrease in the measured g was noticed in both muscle samples. When measuring muscle samples using spatially resolved spectroscopy, anisotropic light scattering by the present muscle fibers should be accounted for. By measuring muscle samples with different initial fiber orientations, it was shown that muscle fibers can change the shape of the diffuse reflectance glow spots from circular to a rhombus shape. This effect was mainly present in the samples with the muscle fibers running parallel to the measurement surface. Moreover, the rhombus’ major axis orientation was related to the distance from the point of illumination. Close to the point illumination the major axis orientation was found to be perpendicular to the muscle fibers, while at larger distance a 90 ° shift occurred, aligning the major axis with the muscle fibers. In these samples with muscle fibers parallel to the measurement surface, the fiber orientation could be predicted based on the fitted rhombuses, with an R 2 P of 0. 993 and RMSEP of 3. 95 °. These results show the importance of the 3 D fiber orientation when measuring diffuse reflectance signals. Moreover, this 3 D fiber orientation could possibly be determined using the obtained diffuse reflectance signals. The prediction of muscle BOP values using the metamodel also showed similarities with the DIS measurement. Clear absorption features of oxymyoglobin and water were present, while the absorption by metmyoglobin was observed as well, related to the ticker samples measured using HLSI. A thicker sample allows a gradient of myoglobin forms to exist, relative to different depths inside the sample. Again, larger µa and µs’ values were observed for the inner BF samples, while both the outer BF and LL samples showed lower values for µs’. During wet aging, a significant increase was obtained for the µs’ of the LL muscle. Moreover, due to the non-destructive nature of HLSI, measurements were possible through the plastic vacuum pack. Due to the lack of oxygen inside the vacuum pack, mainly deoxymyoglobin with an absorption peak around 557 nm was present. Measurements on the exact same sample during wet aging, through the vacuum pack, also showed an increase in µs’ of the LL muscle. As the changes in meat tenderness were most prominent in the LL muscle, it was suggested that the increase in meat tenderness could explain the observed increase in µs’ for this muscle. Finally, a limited number of wavelengths were selected to design a multispectral hand-held measurement device. Four laser diode modules emitting at wavelengths of 533. 3 nm, 674 nm, 800. 7 nm and 981. 1 nm, were selected and mounted around a CCD camera. Using shutters, the laser light of the different modules was guided onto the sample sequentially. Again, a metamodel was built by measuring a set of liquid optical phantoms {{with a wide range of}} both µa and µs’. In validation, the metamodel showed an R 2 V of 0. 9724 and 0. 9377 in combination with an RMSEV of 0. 56 cm- 1 and 5. 13 cm- 1 for µa and µs’ respectively. However, for the prediction of apple and pear samples, with and without the skin, an incomplete separation between absorption and scattering properties was obtained, mainly at wavelengths with high absorption values. Nevertheless, the estimation with the HLSI and multispectral device agreed for the apple samples. Moreover, fruit samples of different density showed different µs’ values. Like this, Golden Delicious apples had the lowest density, while the highest µs’ values were obtained. Based on the obtained results, it was concluded that laser scatter imaging shows potential for the non-destructive monitoring of product quality. The technique can be of added value for applications in which both the evolution of chemical composition and microstructure are of importance. Moreover, the spatial measurements could be useful in characterizing the 3 D structure of anisotropic products. Nevertheless, still improvements in the modelling and setup configuration could be introduced before evolving towards measurements in the field or on-site. A first step was made by the introduction of a multispectral, portable and low-cost measurement device. This type of optical measurements could be beneficial in the entire agro-food industry, as the estimation of BOP and the spatial nature of the measurements offers perspectives for monitoring product quality. nrpages: 183 status: publishe...|$|E

No differences were observed between defoliated and non-defoliated pines in hydraulic parameters, except for a higher vulnerability to embolism at pressures below - 2  MPa in roots of defoliated pines. No differences were found between defoliation classes in branch PLC. Total NSC (TNSC, soluble sugars plus <b>starch)</b> <b>values</b> decreased during drought, particularly in leaves. Defoliation reduced TNSC levels across tree organs, especially just before (June) and during (August) drought. Root rot infection by the fungal pathogen Onnia P. Karst spp. was detected but it {{did not appear to be}} associated to tree defoliation. However, Onnia infection was associated with reduced leaf-specific hydraulic conductivity and sapwood depth, and thus contributed to hydraulic impairment, especially in defoliated pines. Infection was also associated with virtually depleted root starch reserves during and after drought in defoliated pines. Moreover, defoliated and infected trees tended to show lower basal area increment. Overall, our results show the intertwined nature of physiological mechanisms leading to drought-induced mortality and the inherent difficulty of isolating their contribution under field conditions...|$|R
40|$|In {{an attempt}} to reduce the costs and turn around times {{experienced}} with outsourcing starch analysis in finished feed products, the company decided {{to invest in a}} NIR instrument to carry out such analyses in house. The particular instrument purchased by the company comes with a build in calibration for specific finished feed products and the main objective of this investigation was to evaluate whether the instrumentation and build in calibration gives reliable analyses of a finished poultry feed. The results obtained showed that : - The NIR results obtained have a positive bias compared to the theoretical (formulation specified value) and also to the value obtained by enzymatic starch analysis. - Despite the positive bias, the <b>starch</b> <b>values</b> were well within the allowable limits - Repeatability measurements on the data generated by two different analysts showed that while the percentage relative standard deviations obtained (< 1. 0 percent) were well within the company specifications of percentage RSD < 5. 0 percent, the inter sample repeatability showed small, but significant variation. - The results for intermediate precision showed that there is no statistically significant difference between the results obtained by two different analysts, nor was there any difference in the results of the same samples analysed at different time periods. - Reproducibility could not be evaluated {{due to the lack of}} another instrument within the company that were similarly set up as the instrument used for the investigation. This investigation has shown that, given the restrictions enforced by the build incalibration of the NIR instrument, the use of NIR for the analyses of the finished feed product is valid, but will require that careful attention be paid to data collection procedures...|$|R

40|$|The {{production}} of resistant starch from non-conventional sources using an extruder was studied. Starch was isolated from unripe banana and mango fruits, commercial corn starch {{was used for}} comparison pur-poses. Moisture, ash and fat content were higher in non-conventional starch sources than in corn starch, but corn starch presented a lower protein and dietary fibre content than banana and mango starches. Amylose content was higher in banana and mango starches than in corn starch. Besides, mango had the smallest granule size (5 – 10 m). Extruded mango had the lowest solubility which may be related with the granule size, {{and in the case}} of the swelling, extruded products from corn starch had the highest values, a pattern that may be due to the amylose/amylopectin ratio, because corn starch had the lowest amylose content of the starches studied. Extruded products from mango presented a resistant starch (RS) content that decreased when the screw speed increased, for banana <b>starch,</b> the RS <b>values</b> from the extruded products was similar at 30 rpm and 65 rpm, and at 40 rpm it was the highest.

The options included: the use of harvested duckweed biomass as an animal feed, anaerobic digestion of duckweed for methane production, and fermentation of biomass for ethanol production. Duckweed feed quality was determined using feed analysis reports and results from digestibility studies (in vitro fermentation). The performance of the anaerobic digestion process was determined by monitoring pH, VS, TS, NH 4 -N, VFAs, and alkalinity.

40|$|Due to the {{character}} of the original source materials and the nature of batch digitization, quality control issues may be present in this document. Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Seven improved sorghum hybrids and two commercial hybrids were tempered and steam flaked. The flakes were evaluated for hardness, bulk density, flake durability, in vitro digestibilities, starch properties, and other physical/chemical properties. The flakes from the waxy grain were large, more resistant to breakage, and attractive in appearance. The waxy flakes also had the most unique starch pasting properties. Overall, the waxy flakes had the highest quality. The white food type sorghums produced flakes with superior appearance to commercial red and white sorghums. The floury sorghum produced inferior flakes high in fragility and low in test weight. The hard food type sorghum produced small, uniform flakes that were very hard. Tempering of sorghum reduced the amount of energy used, improved flake strength, reduced dust, improved the appearance of the flakes significantly, and increased the bulk density of flakes for all non waxy sorghums. However, the waxy sorghum flake bulk density decreased slightly with increased tempering moisture. Addition of a selected grain conditioner (< 15 x normal rate) during tempering did not effect pericarp structure and/or increase water absorption by the kernel when viewed with the ESEM. Sulfurous acid and 2 -mercaptoethanol caused significant disruption of the sorghum pericarp and endosperm when viewed with the ESEM. The use of these chemicals could enhance efficiency of the sorghum processing. The in vitro digestibility and enzyme susceptible <b>starch</b> <b>values</b> {{had a great deal of}} variability and there were no significant differences found between flakes prepared from the varieties. The pasting properties of the different sorghum flakes were significantly affected by tempering and endosperm type. This suggests that it may be possible to utilize starch viscosity changes to monitor steam flaking. The flake breakage and durability tests appeared to be good quality control tests for steam flaking. However, there are many aspects of steam flaking that are not well understood. Further research is needed to evaluate endosperm differences among sorghum hybrids and lines and their effects on digestibility and processing...|$|R

The highest cold viscosity (CV) was obtained at 13. 18 g. 100 g- 1 moisture, 86. 87 °C and 30 rpm due to increased rupture of starch granules caused by processing at lower moisture condition. Peak viscosity (PV) values were higher than CV values which indicated that the processing {{was not able to}} destroy completely the molecular integrity of the starch granules.
