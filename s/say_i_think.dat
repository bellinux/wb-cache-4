500|$|In an {{interview}} with WisPolitics.com, Thompson commented that he had more experience than any other candidate in the race, and that only Democrat Bill Richardson came close. He believed that his experience, combined with his efforts in Iowa would make up for his lack of funds. Thompson proclaimed to Pajamas Media {{that he would be}} [...] "shocked" [...] if he did not win the straw poll, and in his own personal analysis of the race, commented: [...] "I wouldn't say Romney's in trouble, but I'd <b>say</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it's going to be between Romney and myself." [...] In late July 2007, at a Des Moines coffee shop, with an audience of 40, Thompson said: [...] "I wouldn't be doing this if I didn't think I could win." ...|$|E
500|$|Comedy Central {{originally}} ordered {{only six}} episodes of South Park {{for the first}} season's initial run. However, when the show {{proved to be a}} success, they requested an additional seven, the first ones of which creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone had to produce quickly. [...] "Pinkeye" [...] was the first of those new seven episodes to be produced. It was also the first South Park Halloween episode. The script was written by Parker, Stone and writer Philip Stark, and was directed by Parker and Stone, who made the pinkeye a major element of the plot because they associate the illness with the elementary school experience. Parker said, [...] "Pinkeye is just such a huge part of your life when you're in third grade. Pinkeye is the thing every third grader gets and it's just such a bizarre thing." [...] In writing the episode, Parker said he wanted to convey his belief that Halloween is a positive holiday, especially for children: [...] "Halloween's a great thing. That was part of what we wanted (to <b>say).</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> kids having this kind of mythology is great." ...|$|E
500|$|The My Little Pony toys {{have been}} {{collected}} mainly by women {{who grew up with}} the toys during the 1980s and 1990s, before Hasbro revived the toy series with its Friendship Is Magic line. Bonnie Zacherle, the original creator of the franchise, noted that the toys and show were originally conceived to appeal to preschool children of both genders, and considers it a [...] "good thing" [...] for the adult fandom to have the same appreciation of the show as the collectors. According to Summer Hayes, author of six books about My Little Pony toy collections and organizer of the annual My Little Pony collectors' fair, some of these collectors appreciated the attention of the brony community. Hayes said that the brony community has participated in the toy fair, and that other collectors resent the sudden popularity of Friendship Is Magic. She said that that these earlier fans and collectors had thought; [...] "...what about us? We've been here forever, and nobody seemed to care. But now that there are all these guys in their 20s that are crazy about it, it's suddenly important and it means something." [...] Hayes also said, [...] "To the bronies, I <b>say,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> My Little Pony is awesome, so more power to you".|$|E

500|$|Casey Luskin of the Discovery Institute, which {{promotes}} intelligent design, contested this, saying, [...] "the problem for their logic is that ID {{is not an}} arbitrary explanation, because we have much experience with intelligent agents producing the type of informational complexity we see in nature." [...] Columnist Jeff Jacoby wrote in The Boston Globe that intelligent design [...] "isn't primitivism or Bible-thumping or flying spaghetti. It's science." [...] This view of science, however, {{was rejected by the}} United States National Academy of Sciences. Peter Gallings of Answers in Genesis, a Young Earth Creationist ministry said [...] "Ironically enough, , in addition to mocking God himself, are lampooning the Intelligent Design Movement for not identifying a specific deity—that is, leaving open the possibility that a spaghetti monster could be the intelligent designer... Thus, the satire is possible because the Intelligent Design Movement hasn’t affiliated with a particular religion, exactly the opposite of what its other critics claim!" [...] Mark Coppenger, a pastor who teaches at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, commented, [...] "I'm happy to <b>say</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> FSM hurts the evolutionists' program since, by mocking the Christian tradition... it reinforces the correct impression that there is genuine contempt for biblical faith in that camp... Besides, the parody is lame, and there are few things more encouraging than cheap shots from one's opponents." ...|$|E

2500|$|On March 27, 2007, Malakar sang No Doubt's [...] "Bathwater" [...] {{wearing a}} fauxhawk made from {{multiple}} ponytails. The style {{was called the}} [...] "ponyhawk" [...] by host Ryan Seacrest. While singing, Malakar hesitated {{with some of the}} words to the song. Simon Cowell remarked, [...] "Sanjaya, I don't think it matters anymore what we <b>say</b> ... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> you are in your own universe and if people like you, good luck." [...] The following night, host Seacrest walked out on stage wearing a wig with the same hairstyle, parodying Malakar.|$|E

2500|$|John O'Hara {{wrote in}} the New York Times; [...] "The most {{important}} author living today, the outstanding author {{since the death of}} Shakespeare, has brought out a new novel. The title of the novel is Across the River and Into the Trees. The author, of course, is Ernest Hemingway, the most important, the outstanding author out of the millions of writers who have lived since 1616." [...] Tennessee Williams, in The New York Times, wrote: [...] "I could not go to Venice, now, without hearing the haunted cadences of Hemingway's new novel. It is the saddest novel in the world about the saddest city, and when I <b>say</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it is the best and most honest work that Hemingway has done, you may think me crazy. It will probably be a popular book. The critics may treat it pretty roughly. But its hauntingly tired cadences are the direct speech of a man's heart who is speaking that directly for the first time, and that makes it, for me, the finest thing Hemingway has done." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the episode, Ziva tells {{a witness}} {{that she and}} Tony shared a hotel room, and that she took the couch so she wouldn't have to hear Tony whine about his back. Tony in turn tells McGee that he took the couch. Ziva asks him why he lied and he returns the question. There was much {{speculation}} {{on the part of}} fans about whether the characters might have shared more than was divulged, but Weatherly said in response, [...] "The truth of what happened is probably something that can be discovered inside the episode itself. If you really listen to what they <b>say,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it is pretty clear what happened: Nothing." [...] He clarified that Tony and Ziva had [...] "a tremendous amount of fun" [...] in Paris and that, [...] "Ziva had more fun with Tony than she {{thought she was going to}} have, which maybe shocked her a little bit, because she was so angry at him after he killed her boyfriend last year." [...] Cote de Pablo added, [...] "Michael has his views of what happened in Paris. I have mine. We haven't discussed it. But all I can say is it was good." [...] Shortly afterwards, Glenn Diaz from BuddyTV reported that the cast was divided on whether or not the characters should be allowed to progress beyond [...] "unfulfilled sexual tension".|$|E
2500|$|The duo had not {{expected}} to star in a film at this point of their careers, with Mitchell stating that [...] "it probably came much earlier than {{we thought we would}} do a film. [...] It landed very fortuitously on our doormat." [...] At first, Mitchell and Webb were not considered for the roles of Harry and Karl, but O'Connor changed his mind [...] "it became clear they could do these parts really well. [...] And we thought, well, wouldn't it be great to do our first movie with people we know, because we really admire and enjoy working with them". Unlike most other Mitchell and Webb projects, Olivia Colman does not have a main part in the film. O'Connor explained that [...] "Olivia was part of the development and did some read-throughs with us. [...] I guess our feeling was that because of the relationship between [...] and Olivia in Peep Show, to have taken that same relationship, {{it would have been a}} really weird thing for the audience. [...] I must <b>say</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> she'd have been great in the part, she was great in the read-throughs, I just thought we couldn't have done that." [...] Mitchell admitted, the day before the film's release, that he [...] "really got into" [...] his role as Harry.|$|E
6000|$|... "What selfishness," [...] I answered, as lightly as I could. [...] "Arthur {{must go back}} to town to-night, he <b>says.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that {{we ought}} all {{to spend the day}} together, don't you? I rather thought that you young people would have been off somewhere {{directly}} after breakfast." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "True, Jack," [...] I replied, seriously, [...] "I {{confess that}} I have lied; but I {{did not mean}} to. I assure you I had no notion of what <b>I</b> was <b>saying.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> was bewitched. All your {{nonsense}} rolled out, as it were, without my will. Indeed, I {{did not mean to}} tell lies. Yet I confess, to my shame, that I did. There is some mystery here, which I can by no means fathom." ...|$|R

"I {{shall not}} marry Lord Roehampton," [...] said Adriana with some determination, [...] "and {{if he has}} condescended to think of marrying me," [...] she continued, [...] "as Lady Montfort <b>says,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> his motives are so obvious that if I felt for him any {{preference}} it would be immediately extinguished." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{season was}} not without confrontation, as O'Neal in one team meeting said, [...] "I have {{something}} to <b>say.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> Kobe is playing too selfishly for us to win." [...] O'Neal felt pressure to be leader of the team and was upset with Bryant's shot selection. Teammate Ron Harper helped mediate the differences between O'Neal and Bryant. According to Jackson, [...] "Kobe didn't have a selfish agenda; he just felt that {{the way he had}} been playing was the best way he could contribute. Gradually, he's seen there is a different way to contribute that incorporates more of the team." [...] Upon arriving to the Lakers that season, Winter said he was stunned to discover the level of hatred O'Neal expressed toward Bryant. [...] "There was a lot of hatred in [...] heart ... Kobe just took it and kept going." [...] O'Neal regularly expressed to management that he did not believe the team could win a championship with Bryant. Winter observed that O'Neal influenced the entire team against Bryant. Winter thought that Bryant {{made it a point to}} get the ball to O'Neal that year, but O'Neal did not appreciate what Bryant was doing to help him. During that season's All-Star Game, Bryant did not participate in the Slam Dunk Contest and a matchup against Vince Carter, following Jackson's request to pass on individual accomplishments to keep the focus on the team. During All-Star warm-ups, O'Neal mimicked Bryant's crossover dribble but threw the ball into the stands to accentuate Bryant's turnovers. O'Neal said it was an inside joke between Kobe and him. Jackson and Winter relied on the triangle offense to heal the relationship between O'Neal and Bryant. The coaches believed that the offense was so structured that the relationship between the two players would be smoother on the court. The coaches would also tell the team they did not see the selfishness in Bryant that the players saw. Winter even put together a video for O'Neal to show that Bryant was playing his role correctly.|$|E
