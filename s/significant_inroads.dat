Another sizable portion of the electorate's populace adhered to the old faith, supported by Wittelsbach-funded Jesuits. The supporters of both sides committed atrocities of their own: in the city of Cologne, the mere rumor of Gebhard's approaching army caused rioters to murder several people suspected of sympathizing with the Protestant cause.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MBA) -University of Natal, Durban, 2003. The HIV/AIDS {{epidemic}} affects everyone, every individual, every family, every social institution, every organisation {{and indeed}} every business, big or small. Although {{there are indications}} that HIV infection may be spreading faster among the underprivileged sectors of the population (poor, marginalised, uneducated, etc.), so far the toll among the urban young adult population has been higher. In South Africa it is estimated that as many as 1 000 people, mostly young people, are infected every day. The HIV/AIDS epidemic poses one of the greatest challenges to business development in Africa. The epidemic claims some of the best business leaders, managers and a great number of workers {{at all levels of the}} production system. HIV-related absenteeism, loss of productivity and the cost of replacing workers lost to AIDS threaten the survival of a number of businesses and industrial sectors in the increasingly competitive world market. HIV/AIDS does not affect only workers. By claiming a large part of the urban population with disposable income and by impoverishing families and communities, it also effects the market base of African business. It is clear that no one sector alone can make a <b>significant</b> <b>inroad</b> in the fight against the epidemic. A true partnership involving the government, the private sector and the community is essential to face the problem. The business community is realising that its very survival depends on how effectively it joins forces with other partners, how well it understands the legal issues, current statistics and economic impact of HIV/AIDS to face the problem.

To explore whether these instruments should continue to be accepted in lieu of cash retentions, this paper examines the autonomy principle and its exceptions (both common law and statutory).

For a bank guarantee or unconditional performance bond to function as a risk allocation device (as well as a security), an intended beneficiary will need to routinely implement certain safeguards.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{considers a}} suite of search problems in which agents {{are trying to find}} goals in minimum expected time. Unlike search in data structures in which time is measured by a number operations, search in metric spaces measures time by units of distance and has received much less attention. In particular, search strategies that attempt to minimize expected search time are only available for a handful of relatively simple cases. Nonetheless many relevant search problems take place in metric spaces. This dissertation includes several concrete examples from navigation and surveillance that would have previously only been approachable by much more ad hoc methods. We visit these examples along the way to establishing relevance to a much larger set of problems. We present a policy that is an extension of Whittle's index heuristic and is applicable under the following assumptions. * The location of goals are independent random variables. " The agents and goals are in a length space, i. e., a metric space with continuous paths. * The agents move along continuous paths with bounded speed. " The agents' sensing is noiseless. We demonstrate the performance of our policy by applying it to a diverse set of problems for which solutions are available in the literature. We treat each of the following problems as a special case of a more general search problem: " search in one-dimensional spaces such as the Line Search Problem (LSP) and Cow Path Problem (CPP), " search in two-dimensional spaces such as the Lost in a Forest Problem (LFP) and problems of coverage, " problems in networks such as the Graph Search Problem (GSP) and Minimum Latency Tour Problem (MLTP), and " dynamic problems such as the Persistent Patrol Problem (PPP) and Dynamic Traveling Repairperson Problem (DTRP). On each of these we find that our policy performs comparably to, and occasionally better than, the accepted solutions developed specifically for these problems. As a result, we believe that this dissertation contributes a <b>significant</b> <b>inroad</b> into a large space of search problems that meets our assumptions, but that remains unaddressed. by Thomas.

[...] This was principally because opposition to the National Republicans was fragmented, exemplified by the Free Bridge Party and the Anti-Masonic Party, the latter of which in particular siphoned off significant numbers of Democratic votes in the 1832 election. [...] Despite attempts by both the National Republicans and the Democrats to woo the Anti-Masons into their fold, neither was able to. [...] Morton was mildly anti-Mason, but Henshaw was a Freemason, and Morton apparently did not recognize the potential power of the Anti-Masons despite their significant electoral showing. [...] As a result, the Democrats lacked the voting strength to unseat the National Republicans. [...] The Democrats were also splintered in 1832 and 1833, when the Working Men's Party drew support by attacking both of the larger parties for their lack of attention to labor issues. [...] Morton was sufficiently disheartened by his repeated failures that he considered abandoning his quest for the governorship in 1832; Henshaw convinced him to soldier on. [...] In 1831 Morton broke ranks with his friend John Calhoun over the latter's support for nullification, which Morton believed was based on his support for slavery.

It was published in a special issue of Telematics & Informatics (30 : 3, 232 - 241) themed, ‘Radio and New Participatory Journalisms around the World: Understanding Convergence in News Cultures’, edited by Dr Last Moyo of the University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa. The study sought to explore new media uses by ‘pirate’ radio stations and their audiences, and the potential impact such uses have in democratizing citizen participation in radio news and storytelling. It contributes to my wider ongoing research into media-based storytelling in the digital age., As an empirically driven study (using qualitative in-depth interviews with audiences in Zimbabwe), the paper contributes towards the ‘de-Westernisation’ of scholarly accounts of how audiences are adapting to processes of convergence and digitisation and also offers insights for cross-cultural comparative research. The study offers alternative insights and perspectives into the question of radio reception in the era media convergence. It empirically demonstrates that any meaningful critique of emerging digital ‘storytelling’ techniques and cultures in radio must be grounded in particular socio-political and economic contexts. It is this point that radio stations broadcasting into Africa will need to take into consideration if their digital transmission platforms are to make <b>significant</b> qualitative <b>inroads</b> in the African communicative space., The findings of this study were initially presented at two international events: at the ‘Joburg Radio Days Annual Conference’, University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa (27 - 29 July 2011), and at a roundtable on ‘Putting Communication for Development Research into Use’ organized by the University of Sussex’s Institute of Development Studies (2 - 5 March 2012), where I was an invited speaker...|$|R

In the region of forty people attended the various auditions at the Primrose Hill studios of Lawlor's company, Water Music Productions. A failure to find a suitable vocalist left the band on hold until 1993, when they came across vocalist Ray Wilson, who had been in a road traffic accident and required a lift to make the gig he was performing later that evening.

50|$|The 3rd District envelops {{the greater}} part of New Haven County, {{surrounding}} the city of New Haven, the district's population center. Long representing the New Haven area in the House, the 3rd District was once limited to the city itself and the inner-most suburbs. Due to Connecticut's generally stagnant population growth, and actual depopulation within New Haven, since the reapportionment, the 3rd District now also includes the entirety of the Naugatuck Valley, a crucial component of the former 5th district. While the district does take in some of Connecticut's prime shoreline real estate, in communities such as Guilford, most of the coastal towns in the 3rd are eminently middle-class, like Milford and Stratford. The district also notably encompasses the core area of Connecticut's large Italian-American community, from the area around Wooster Street in New Haven (home of world-renowned pizzerias Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana and Sally's Apizza) to the very Italian neighborhood of Town Plot in Waterbury, Connecticut. Many in New Haven's Italian community have since departed for the surrounding suburbs, but the string of towns stretching down the Naugatuck valley from Waterbury ranks among the heaviest concentrations of Italian Americans in the country, and East Haven and West Haven both have Italian populations approaching 50% of each town's population. The state's largest Portuguese-American community, in Naugatuck, is also located in the 3rd District. The New Haven area retains an overwhelmingly Democratic heritage for the most part, although Republicans have made <b>significant</b> successful <b>inroads</b> in the ethnic communities of the suburbs. While historically Democratic, however, many of the voters here are somewhat socially conservative, especially in the Naugatuck Valley, although many years of representation by steadfast liberals may have eroded any advantage a challenger could have derived. Waterbury, Connecticut's 5th largest city, is a Democratic but very conservative city, where many of the Italian, Irish, and Lebanese voters have become increasingly comfortable voting for Republicans. After long remaining {{the focal point of the}} old 5th District, Waterbury was placed largely in the new 5th; yet, the considerably Republican and Italian neighborhood of Town Plot excised and lopped onto the 3rd, to the dismay of 5th District Republicans.|$|R
