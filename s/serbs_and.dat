5|$|Religious {{affiliation}} is diverse: Macedonians, <b>Serbs</b> <b>and</b> Vlachs {{are mainly}} Orthodox, while Albanians, Turks and Roma (Gypsies) are usually Muslim, although there exists an almost {{equal number of}} Orthodox Romani.

5|$|A second {{attempt to}} revive the plan arose from talks between Kinkel and French foreign {{minister}} Hervé de Charette on 28 June. They proposed establishing zones of separation to enforce a ceasefire, monitoring the RSK's external borders, specific guarantees {{for the safety of}} Croatian <b>Serbs</b> <b>and</b> implementating confidence-building measures by economic cooperation between Croatia and the RSK. The initiative, however, did not gain ground when the RSK refused to negotiate.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} Graz agreement, {{negotiated}} by Bosnian <b>Serbs</b> <b>and</b> Bosnian Croats aiming to partition Bosnia and Herzegovina in early May, proclaimed {{cessation of hostilities}} between the two groups, heavy fighting broke out between the HVO and the VRS in June, in eastern Herzegovina (Operation Jackal), and in the Sava River basin (Operation Corridor 92), {{in the north of}} Bosnia and Herzegovina.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years of Basil I's reign, Arab raids on the coasts of Dalmatia were {{successfully}} repelled, and the region once again came under secure Byzantine control. This enabled Byzantine missionaries to penetrate to the interior and convert the <b>Serbs</b> <b>and</b> the principalities of modern-day Herzegovina and Montenegro to Orthodox Christianity. An attempt to retake Malta ended disastrously, however, when the local population sided with the Arabs and massacred the Byzantine garrison.|$|E

5|$|Once {{the first}} part was completed, Smederevo Fortress quickly became an {{important}} connection between the Balkans and central Europe. Shortly after it was built, the city reached its peak importance as a religious, commercial, and trade center, at which point it was populated mainly by <b>Serbs</b> <b>and</b> colonies of merchants, primarily from Dubrovnik. Around the same time, the relics of Saint Luke the Evangelist, who became {{the patron saint of}} Smederevo, were brought and stored in the church in the fortress.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the occupation, {{the most}} recent Yugoslav census had been taken in 1931. This census used {{language}} as the primary criterion, and counted all speakers of Serbo-Croatian as one group, rather than recognising distinct Serb, Croat, Bosnian Muslim, Macedonian and Montenegrin nationalities. Aligning data on religious affiliation with the linguistic data {{has been used by}} scholars to determine approximate numbers of <b>Serbs</b> <b>and</b> Croats in the 1931 census, by counting those of the Roman Catholic denomination as Croats.|$|E
5|$|The Goražde {{printing}} house {{was one of}} the earliest among the <b>Serbs</b> <b>and</b> the first in the territory of present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina. It was founded by Božidar Ljubavić near the town of Goražde in 1519, in the early period of Ottoman rule over the region. It produced three Orthodox religious books, including the Goražde Psalter, with its last book printed in 1523. The next {{printing house}} would not be opened in Bosnia and Herzegovina until {{the second half of the}} 19th century.|$|E

5|$|The Macedonian period also {{included}} events of momentous religious significance. The {{conversion of the}} Bulgarians, <b>Serbs</b> <b>and</b> Rus' to Orthodox Christianity permanently changed the religious map of Europe and still resonates today. Cyril and Methodius, two Byzantine Greek brothers from Thessaloniki, {{contributed significantly to the}} Christianization of the Slavs and in the process devised the Glagolitic alphabet, ancestor to the Cyrillic script.|$|E
5|$|The Ustaše {{began to}} impose the new laws on the Serb {{population}} of the NDH. On 28 May, a group of ten young Ustaše students from the University of Zagreb arrived in Trebinje and began removing signs written in the Cyrillic script used by Serbs. On 1 June, in several towns and villages in eastern Herzegovina, Serbs were shot and businesses belonging to Serb merchants and others were seized. On that day, the Ustaše students in Trebinje shot nine <b>Serbs</b> <b>and</b> arrested another fifteen, apparently due to their links to the inter-war Chetnik Association. Differences began to appear between the brutal treatment of Serbs by the Ustaše and the more careful approach of the other NDH authorities such as the Home Guard, who {{were aware of the}} potential danger created by Ustaše methods. In early June, the NDH authorities began operations to confiscate weapons from the population, meeting with immediate resistance. On 1 June, the residents of the village of Donji Drežanj, near Nevesinje, refused to co-operate with weapons collectors. In response, the Ustaše killed a number of <b>Serbs</b> <b>and</b> burned their homes.|$|E
5|$|The battle also {{affected}} the <b>Serbs</b> <b>and</b> the Croats, who {{were forced to}} acknowledge the supremacy of the Byzantine Emperor after 1018. The borders of the Byzantine Empire were restored to the Danube {{for the first time}} since the 7th century, allowing Byzantium to control the entire Balkan peninsula from the Danube to the Peloponnese and from the Adriatic Sea to the Black Sea.|$|E

5|$|The {{conflict}} between <b>Serbs</b> <b>and</b> Croats spread to eastern Slavonia in early 1991. On 1 April, Serb villagers around Vukovar and other towns in eastern Slavonia began to erect barricades across main roads. The White Eagles, a Serbian paramilitary {{group led by}} Vojislav Šešelj, moved into the Serb-populated village of Borovo Selo just north of Vukovar. In mid-April 1991, Armbrust shoulder-launched anti-tank missiles were fired at Borovo Selo. According to one version of the event, missiles were fired at agricultural machinery that served as barricades. According to a second version, three missiles were fired at houses inhabited by Serbs. There were no casualties, but the attack aggravated and deepened ethnic tensions. On 2 May, Serb paramilitaries ambushed two Croatian police buses in the centre of Borovo Selo, killing 12 policemen and injuring 22 more. Three Serbs were also killed. The Battle of Borovo Selo represented the worst act of violence between the country's <b>Serbs</b> <b>and</b> Croats since the Second World War. It enraged many Croatians {{and led to a}} surge of ethnic violence across Slavonia.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} {{the city has been}} {{strongly}} influenced by people of different nations and religions, namely by Austrians, Croats, Czechs, Germans, Hungarians, Jews, <b>Serbs</b> <b>and</b> Slovaks (in alphabetical order).

5|$|The planned Pecheneg {{attack from}} the north also failed, as the Pechenegs quarrelled with admiral Lekapenos, who refused to {{transport}} them across the Danube to aid the main Byzantine army. The Byzantines were not aided by <b>Serbs</b> <b>and</b> Magyars either: the Magyars were engaged in Western Europe as Frankish allies, and the Serbs under Petar Gojniković were reluctant to attack Bulgaria because Michael of Zahumlje, an ally of Bulgaria, had notified Simeon of their plans.|$|E
5|$|The region {{underwent}} major {{demographic changes}} following the Second World War, when its ethnic German inhabitants were expelled {{and replaced with}} settlers from elsewhere in Yugoslavia. In the last Yugoslav census in 1991, the Vukovar municipality, which included the town and surrounding villages, was recorded as having 84,189 inhabitants, of whom 43.8 percent were Croats, 37.5 percent were <b>Serbs</b> <b>and</b> the remainder were members of other ethnic groups. The town's population was 47 percent Croat and 32.3 percent Serb.|$|E
5|$|Comparing folk tales, {{there are}} {{similarities}} between the ala and the Russian Baba Yaga. The aforementioned motif of a stepdaughter coming to an ala’s house in a forest is recorded among Russians too– there a stepdaughter comes to Baba Yaga’s house and feeds her “livestock”. Similar are also the motifs of an ala (by <b>Serbs)</b> <b>and</b> Baba Yaga (by Russians) becoming godmothers to children whom they later eat because the children discover their secret. In the Serbian example, the mother of an ala’s godchild speaks with the ala, and in the Russian, the godchild speaks with Baba Yaga.|$|E
