25|$|The {{creation}} science {{texts and}} curricula that first {{emerged in the}} 1960s focused upon concepts derived from a literal interpretation of the Bible and were overtly religious in nature, most notably linking Noah's flood in the Biblical Genesis account to the geological and fossil record in a system termed flood geology. These works attracted little notice beyond the schools and congregations of conservative fundamental and Evangelical Christians until the 1970s when its followers challenged {{the teaching of evolution}} in the public schools and other venues in the United States, bringing it {{to the attention of the}} public-at-large and the scientific community. Many <b>school</b> <b>boards</b> <b>and</b> lawmakers were persuaded to include the teaching of creation science alongside evolution in the science curriculum. Creation science texts and curricula used in churches and Christian schools were revised to eliminate their Biblical and theological references, and less explicitly sectarian versions of creation science education were introduced in public schools in Louisiana, Arkansas, and other regions in the United States.|$|E
25|$|In the mid 70s the {{situation}} with Lakota language instruction improved on the Rosebud Reservation where the Lakota Language and Culture department was established at the Sinte Glešká University under the chairmanship of Ben Black Bear, Jr., who promoted standardization of orthography and curricula. He employed college level textbooks and orthography developed by the Colorado University Lakota Project (CULP). A few years later Black Bear was replaced as a chair of the department by Albert White Hat who discontinued {{the use of the}} consistent phonemic orthography and the Colorado University textbooks. In 1992 White Hat published an elementary level textbook and promoted it as the only teaching material for schools of all levels in Rosebud. White Hat established his own orthography, one that is very diacritic heavy and impractical. This had a detrimental impact on the quality of instruction in Rosebud and resulted in almost complete disintegration of Lakota language teaching infrastructure in Rosebud, because <b>school</b> <b>boards</b> <b>and</b> administrators gradually lost trust in the effectiveness of Lakota language teachers and classes. By 2015, only one Rosebud school offered Lakota language classes and there were only 2 Lakota language teachers.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} notable effects of the {{adoption}} of the Charter was to greatly expand the scope of judicial review, because the Charter is more explicit with respect to the guarantee of rights and the role of judges in enforcing them than was the Bill of Rights. The courts, when confronted with violations of Charter rights, have struck down unconstitutional federal and provincial statutes and regulations or parts of statutes and regulations, as they did when Canadian case law was primarily concerned with resolving issues of federalism. The Charter, however, granted new powers to the courts to enforce remedies that are more creative and to exclude more evidence in trials. These powers are greater than what was typical under the common law and under a system of government that, influenced by Canada's parent country the United Kingdom, was based upon Parliamentary supremacy. As a result, the Charter has attracted both broad support from a majority of the Canadian electorate and criticisms by opponents of increased judicial power. The Charter only applies to government laws and actions (including the laws and actions of federal, provincial, and municipal governments and public <b>school</b> <b>boards),</b> <b>and</b> sometimes to the common law, not to private activity.|$|E

25|$|Leading {{constitutional}} law scholar Erwin Chemerinsky {{participated in the}} same symposium, exploring how this decision would be understood and applied by school officials, <b>school</b> <b>boards,</b> <b>and</b> lower court judges. He suggested that the opinion was misguided and—from a First Amendment perspective—highly undesirable, arguing that the decision cannot be justified under existing First Amendment principles, {{that it could be}} seen as authorizing punishment of students for speech that is deemed distasteful or offensive, even just juvenile. However, he noted Justice Alito's concurring opinion, which suggests that the majority opinion might be exceedingly narrow and based on a very unusual factual context; Chemerinsky noted that if Justice Alito's opinion is seen as defining the scope of the holding, then the case establishes only the power of schools to punish speech encouraging illegal drug use rather than giving school officials great discretion to punish student speech. Thus, despite the fact that Morse v. Frederick is consistent with decisions from the Supreme Court and lower federal courts over the last two decades, his hope is that Chief Justice Roberts's majority opinion will be read through the prism of Justice Alito's concurring opinion, thereby having little effect on the already very limited First Amendment rights of students.|$|E

In December 2006, a school board trustee in London, Ontario attended a London Knights game and was shocked by the fighting and by the crowd's positive reaction to it.

500|$|The basic {{legislative}} proposals of the [...] "Stanley plan," [...] the Washington Post reported, were {{worked out}} at a secret meeting on July 2 in the United States House Committee on Rules hearing room in the United States Capitol. At the meeting were Abbitt, Byrd, Gray, Smith, Tuck, Stanley, and seven Southside state legislators. The group agreed to a five-point legislative program: 1) No public school integration would be tolerated in Virginia; 2) School districts which integrated would lose state funding; 3) The state law permitting school districts to be sued would be repealed; 4) The power to assign students to schools would {{be taken away from}} local <b>school</b> <b>boards</b> <b>and</b> transferred to the governor; and 5) The governor would have the power to close any school district which integrated. Despite the group's many public statements supporting local control of schools, Tuck later remarked {{that the purpose of the}} plan was to prevent integration anywhere in Virginia: [...] "If they [...] won't stand with us then I say make 'em. We cannot compromise. ... If you ever let them integrate anywhere the whole state will be integrated in a short time." [...] Byrd in particular was a vocal supporter of the school closing proposal, and helped draft the other proposals in the plan.|$|E
500|$|The school closure {{portion of}} the Stanley plan was not {{challenged}} until after it was invoked, and no school closures occurred until September 1958. In August 1958, federal courts were nearing decisions on the integration of school systems in Charlottesville, Norfolk, and Warren County. On September 4, Governor Almond stripped all local <b>school</b> <b>boards</b> <b>and</b> school district superintendents throughout the state of their authority to assign pupils, and ordered the school boards of the three jurisdictions to refuse to assign any black students to white schools. A day later, a federal court ordered the immediate integration of Warren County public schools. On September 11, invoking the Stanley plan's school closure provisions, Governor Almond closed the Warren County public school system. Charlottesville schools were closed on September 17, and Norfolk schools closed September 30. Parents of African American students immediately sued to have the school closure laws invalidated. On January 18, 1959, the Supreme Court of Virginia held in Harrison v. Day, that the school closing law violated Section 129 of the Virginia constitution (which required the state to [...] "maintain an efficient system of public free schools throughout the State."). The very same day, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia held in James v. Almond, that the school closing statute violated the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.|$|E
