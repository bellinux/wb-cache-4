Senator Keating was defeated in the 1964 election, but Senator Roman Hruska of Nebraska took up Keating's cause as a new member of the Subcommittee on Constitutional Amendments.|$|E
5|$|The ISA has its {{constitutional}} basis in Article 149 of the Constitution, which sanctions preventive detention {{and allows for}} laws passed by the legislature against subversion to override the Articles protecting the personal liberties of the individual. Specifically, Article 149(1) declares <b>such</b> <b>legislation</b> to be valid notwithstanding any inconsistency with five of the fundamental liberty provisions in the Constitution, including Article 9. Thus, detentions under the ISA cannot be challenged {{on the basis of}} deprivation of these rights.|$|E
5|$|Elliott {{embarked}} for Australia on the RMS Orontes on 15 May 1919, {{sharing a}} cabin {{with an old}} friend, Brigadier General Gordon Bennett. They arrived back in Melbourne on 28 June, and his AIF appointment was terminated the following day. He contested the federal election {{as a candidate for}} the Nationalist Party of Australia on 13 December 1919. He achieved the greatest popular vote of any Victorian candidate for the Senate. Moreover, he repeated this success at the 1925 election. Although not naturally suited to life in the federal parliament, he made significant contributions, and was outspoken in his efforts to assist returned servicemen, particularly those with whom he had served. This outspokenness often took the form of arguing in the Senate in relation to the new legislation being brought before it, when <b>such</b> <b>legislation</b> involved the defence forces. At other times, he would personally champion the cause of those men who had been in his battalion.|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} {{response to}} the strike and riot became a political football between the Republican leadership of Indianapolis, and the Democratic leadership of the state. The refusal by the city police to battle the strikers was met with approval by Mayor of Indianapolis, Republican Samuel Shank. Shank informed Governor Samuel Ralston that the strike was growing beyond what he could control and insisted the Governor should take responsibility {{for dealing with the}} situation. Shank asked Ralston to call a special session of the Indiana General Assembly to end the strike through a compulsory arbitration law, but Ralston refused because he thought it unlikely that the General Assembly could agree to <b>such</b> <b>legislation</b> in a timely manner. Ralston believed Shank was undermining the police effort and told him to order the city police back into action, but Shank refused. Ralston then bypassed the mayor and requested that County Sheriff, Democrat Theodore Porttens, bring in county police to reestablish order.|$|E
5|$|This amendment, {{as well as}} the Fourteenth, is {{undoubtedly}} self-executing, without any ancillary legislation, so far as its terms are applicable to any existing state of circumstances. By its own unaided force and effect, it abolished slavery and established universal freedom. Still, legislation may be necessary and proper to meet all the various cases and circumstances to be affected by it, and to prescribe proper modes of redress for its violation in letter or spirit. And <b>such</b> <b>legislation</b> may be primary and direct in its character, for the amendment is not a mere prohibition of State laws establishing or upholding slavery, but an absolute declaration that slavery or involuntary servitude shall not exist in any part of the United States.|$|E
5|$|Already the Sejm of the Kingdom of Poland has a {{great impact}} on the king's powers. From 1505 the king could not pass laws himself without the {{approval}} of the sejm, this being forbidden by Polish szlachta privilege laws like nihil novi. According to the nihil novi constitution, a law passed by the sejm had to be agreed by the three estates (stany sejmujące; the king, the senate and deputies from the sejm proper - the lower chamber). There were only few areas in which the king could pass legislation without consulting the sejm: on royal cities, peasants in royal lands, Jews, fiefs and on mining. The three estates of the sejm had the final decision in legislation on taxation, budget and treasury matters (including military funding), foreign policy (including hearing foreign envoys and sending diplomatic missions) and ennoblement. The sejm received fiscal reports from deputy treasurers, and debated on most important court cases (the sejm court), with the right of amnesty. The sejm could also legislate {{in the absence of the}} king, although <b>such</b> <b>legislation</b> would have to be accepted by the king ex post.|$|E

Institute of Medicine (IOM) convened by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) found {{out that there are}} {{cardiovascular}} effects from exposure to secondhand smoke. An epidemiology report says that the risk of coronary heart disease is increased to around 25-30% when one is exposed to secondhand smoke.

50|$|However, others coercive {{legislations}} like Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958 (AFSPA), the Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA, 1968), {{and economic}} counterpart of the act, Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act (COFEPOSA) enacted on December 13, 1974 to prevent smuggling and black-marketing in foreign exchange is still enforce. Controversial successors to <b>such</b> <b>legislations</b> include the National Security Act (1980), Terrorism and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA, 1985-1995), and the Prevention of Terrorism Act (POTA, 2002), criticized for authorizing excessive powers for {{the aim of}} fighting internal and cross-border terrorism and political violence, without safeguards for civil freedoms.|$|R
5|$|The Parliament and Council {{have been}} {{compared}} to the two chambers of a bicameral legislature. However, there are some differences from national legislatures; for example, neither the Parliament nor the Council have the power of legislative initiative (except {{for the fact that}} the Council has the power in some intergovernmental matters). In Community matters, this is a power uniquely reserved for the European Commission (the executive). Therefore, while Parliament can amend and reject legislation, to make a proposal for legislation, it needs the Commission to draft a bill before anything can become law. The value of such a power has been questioned by noting that in the national legislatures of the member states 85% of initiatives introduced without executive support fail to become law. Yet it has been argued by former Parliament president Hans-Gert Pöttering that as the Parliament does have the right to ask the Commission to draft <b>such</b> <b>legislation,</b> and as the Commission is following Parliament's proposals more and more Parliament does have a de facto right of legislative initiative.|$|E
5|$|With no presidential ambitions left, Kennedy {{formed a}} good {{relationship}} with Democratic President Bill Clinton upon the latter taking office in 1993, despite his having initially backed former fellow Massachusetts Senator Paul Tsongas in the 1992 Democratic presidential primaries. Kennedy floor-managed successful passage of Clinton's National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993 that created the AmeriCorps program, and despite reservations supported the president on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). On the issue Kennedy cared most about, national health insurance, he supported but was not much involved in formation of the Clinton health care plan, which was run by First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and others. It failed badly and damaged the prospects for <b>such</b> <b>legislation</b> for years to come. In 1994, Kennedy's strong recommendation of his former Judiciary Committee staffer Stephen Breyer played a role in Clinton appointing Breyer to the U.S. Supreme Court. During 1994 Kennedy became the first senator with a home page on the World Wide Web; the product of an effort with the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, it helped counter the image of Kennedy as old and out of touch.|$|E

50|$|The tax law of many {{countries}} includes provisions aiming at preventing abuse. Tax authorities try to challenge fictitious or artificial transactions {{and try to}} combat tax evasion. Transactions which are only carried out to receive a tax benefit shall be prevented. Furthermore, transactions whose primary intention is tax allowance should be prohibited. If a transaction is considered as harmful tax avoidance under an anti-avoidance legislation, the tax burden is calculated as if the abuse had not occurred.

One of its fundamental aims was to act as a revising chamber by scrutinizing or amending bills, which had been passed by the House of Representatives.
