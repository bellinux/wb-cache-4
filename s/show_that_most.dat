Alkaline hydrolysis experiments <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> of the phenolic acids are present as bound forms {{and only a}} small portion can be detected as free compounds. Hops, and beer made with it, contain 8-prenylnaringenin which is a potent phytoestrogen. Hop also contains myrcene, humulene, xanthohumol, isoxanthohumol, myrcenol, linalool, tannins and resin. The alcohol 2M2B is a component of hops brewing.|$|E

5|$|Fruit flies (Drosophila), {{because of}} the large array of {{techniques}} available for studying their genetics, have been a natural subject for studying the role of genes in brain development. In spite of the large evolutionary distance between insects and mammals, many aspects of Drosophila neurogenetics {{have been shown to be}} relevant to humans. The first biological clock genes, for example, were identified by examining Drosophila mutants that showed disrupted daily activity cycles. A search in the genomes of vertebrates revealed a set of analogous genes, which were found to play similar roles in the mouse biological clock—and therefore almost certainly in the human biological clock as well. Studies done on Drosophila, also <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> neuropil regions of the brain are continuously reorganized throughout life in response to specific living conditions.|$|E
5|$|Giant impacts {{are thought}} to have been common in the early Solar System. Computer {{simulations}} of a giant impact have produced results that are consistent with the mass of the lunar core and the present angular momentum of the Earth–Moon system. These simulations also <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> of the Moon derived from the impactor, rather than the proto-Earth. More recent simulations suggest a larger fraction of the Moon derived from the original Earth mass. Studies of meteorites originating from inner Solar System bodies such as Mars and Vesta show that they have very different oxygen and tungsten isotopic compositions as compared to Earth, whereas Earth and the Moon have nearly identical isotopic compositions. The isotopic equalization of the Earth-Moon system might be explained by the post-impact mixing of the vaporized material that formed the two, although this is debated.|$|E

5|$|In a {{range of}} studies, {{participants}} have been requested to answer general knowledge questions, each of which had two possible answers, and also to estimate their chances of answering each question correctly. If the participants had a sufficient degree of self-knowledge, their level of confidence in regard to each answer they gave would be high for the questions they answered correctly and lower for the ones they answered wrong. However, this generally is not the case. Many people are overconfident; indeed, studies <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> people systematically overestimate their own abilities. Moreover, people are overconfident {{about their ability to}} answer questions that are deemed to be hard but underconfident on questions that are considered easy.|$|E
5|$|Queens are polyandrous, {{meaning that}} queens will mate more than once; queens mate with one to nine males during a nuptial flight, and the {{effective}} number of mates per queen ranges from 1.0 to 11.4. Studies <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> queen ants will only mate {{with one or}} two males. If the number of available male mates increases, the number of effective matings per queen decreases. Colonies are polygynous, meaning that a colony may house multiple queens; there are on average one to four queens per colony, and in multiple-queen colonies, the egg-laying queens are unrelated to one another. Based on a study, 11 of the 14 colonies tested were polygynous (78.57%), showing that this is common in jack jumper colonies. When the queen establishes a nest after mating, she will hunt for food to feed her young, making her semi-claustral. Nests can hold as few as 500 ants or as many as 800 to 1,000. Excavated nests typically have populations ranging from 34 to 344 individuals. Jack jumper ant workers are gamergates, having the ability to reproduce in colonies with or without queens.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} African Americans in the {{territory}} during this period was quite small but not insignificant. Newcomers continued to bring slaves with them, but there were many free blacks as well, some working as servants and some as completely independent pioneers. Information about the black immigrants during the earlier periods is sparse, but records do <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> of those at Fort Snelling were slaves. Records from 1850 indicate a population of 39 free blacks {{out of a total}} population of 6,077 citizens {{in the territory}} (which excluded Native American tribes). Before the 1840s these free persons could often expect to be treated equal to other racial groups. By the time Minnesota had achieved statehood, however, blacks had been disenfranchised and schools were segregated. Despite this, {{from the start of the}} Minnesota Territory in 1848 the leadership was predominantly antislavery thus ending the practice in this era.|$|E

5|$|As most meat ant colonies {{rarely have}} a second queen, polydomy is not always {{associated}} with polygyny, although the two are frequently associated with each other because polygynous colonies reproduce by budding. This means that the ecological factors that promote polydomy and polygny both differ. Studies <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> meat ants are produced by a single, inseminated queen due to {{the high level of}} relatedness in all but one tested colonies. Colonies that are not closely related are the result of colony fusion (meaning that two unrelated and separate colonies form a single entity). Meat ants also show nest fidelity: in polydomous colonies, workers from different nests will always mingle with others from different nests but never return to a nest they do not originate from. Instead, they return to the nest they enclosed in. This means that colonies may only homogenise through brood transfer. As discussed before, nestmates from different nests will always be aggressive towards each other, but this is due to a number of factors: genetic and spatial distance in nests can correlate with the level of aggression exhibited by the ants. However, they exhibit more aggression to ants of different species from adjoining territories. They are also aggressive to conspecific ants from distant colonies, suggesting that environmental cues {{play a vital role in}} nestmate recognition. An example is that background odours in a particular environment may impair ants from identifying their own nestmates, and may need to make more attempts to determine an ant's identity.|$|E
5|$|The Nile {{crocodile}} has {{a reputation}} as the biggest killer of large animals, including humans, on the African continent. It is widely distributed, found in many habitats and cryptically coloured. From a waiting position with only its eyes and nostrils above the water, it can lunge at drinking animals, fishermen, bathers, or people collecting water or washing clothes. Once seized and dragged into the water, there is little chance for the victim to escape. Analysis of attacks <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> take place during the breeding season or when crocodiles are guarding nests or newly hatched young. Although many attacks go unreported, there are estimated to be over 300 per year, 63% of which are fatal. Wild saltwater crocodiles in Australia carried out 62 confirmed and unprovoked attacks causing injury or death between 1971 and 2004. These animals have also caused fatalities in Malaysia, New Guinea, and elsewhere. They are highly territorial and resent intrusion into their territories by other crocodiles, humans, or boats such as canoes. Attacks may come from animals of various sizes, but the larger males are generally responsible for fatalities. As their size increases, so does their need for larger mammalian prey; pigs, cattle, horses, and humans are all within the size range they seek. Most of the people attacked were either swimming or wading, but in two instances they were asleep in tents.|$|E

25|$|When {{a coastal}} {{environment}} is in sediment deficit, anthropogenic sediment nourishment {{is one way}} in which a balanced sedimentary budget can be maintained. This type of coastal erosion management has been adopted all over the world in order to preserve and protect. An example of this is at Mount Maunganui beach in the North Island of New Zealand which had been experiencing erosion, resulting in coastal dune retreat of almost 20 metres. When ongoing dredging {{at the entrance to the}} Tauranga Harbour began, it was decided that the sediment removed would be used to re-nourish the Mt. Manganui beach. The sediment was deposited in the nearshore zone promoting beach accretion by offshore berm emplacement. Results <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> of the 80,000m3 of sediment added to the nearshore zone made it to ashore to re-nourish the beach and even out the past sediment deficit. Nourishment of a coast can be regarded as a fast fix option to reversing a sediment deficit; however, it is important that nourishment is on-going in order to ensure the sedimentary budget remains balanced.|$|E
25|$|The {{cells in}} which all these DNA {{alterations}} accumulate are difficult to trace, but two recent lines of evidence suggest that normal stem cells may be the cells of origin in cancers. First, there exists a highly positive correlation (Spearman’s rho = 0.81; P < 3.5 × 10−8) between {{the risk of developing}} cancer in a tissue and the number of normal stem cell divisions taking place in that same tissue. The correlation applied to 31 cancer types and extended across five orders of magnitude. This correlation means that if the normal stem cells from a tissue divide once, the cancer risk in that tissue is approximately 1X. If they divide 1,000 times, the cancer risk is 1,000X. And if the normal stem cells from a tissue divide 100,000 times, the cancer risk in that tissue is approximately 100,000X. This strongly suggests that the main reason we have cancer is that our normal stem cells divide, which implies that cancer originates in normal stem cells. Second, statistics <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> human cancers are diagnosed in aged people. A possible explanation is that cancers occur because cells accumulate damage through time. DNA is the only cellular component that can accumulate damage over the entire course of a life, and stem cells are the only cells that can transmit DNA from the zygote to cells late in life. Other cells cannot keep DNA from the beginning of life until a possible cancer occurs. This implies that most cancers arise from normal stem cells.|$|E
