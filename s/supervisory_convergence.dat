40|$|Purpose – To {{describe}} the 5 th May 2006 ECOFIN conclusions on <b>supervisory</b> <b>convergence</b> {{and explain why}} they represent a new departure for European financial services work. Design/methodology/approach – The article outlines the 6 th 2006 ECOFIN conclusions relating to <b>supervisory</b> <b>convergence.</b> It then reviews EU developments relating to <b>supervisory</b> <b>convergence</b> from the 2001 Lamfalussy Process onwards as context for the conclusions. Finally, {{in the light of}} the review and the description of the conclusions it draws some conclusions about the likely implications for further developments in the EU in relation to EU <b>supervisory</b> <b>convergence.</b> Findings – The principal findings are that <b>supervisory</b> <b>convergence</b> is likely to increase due to enhanced political backing with member state finance ministries and regulators taking a leading role. Research limitations/implications – As this is the first paper on the ECOFIN conclusions there is considerable scope for ongoing research to establish the extent to which the predictions in the paper prove to be justified by future developments. Practical implications – The ECOFIN conclusions represent a departure from EU financial services work focused on a legislative programme, the Financial Services Action Plan, to a programme focusing on improving cross-border relationships between supervisors. This has important implications for the key European actors and gives a strong role to national finance ministries and supervisors. The practical implications will be enhanced cooperation between national supervisors on a cross-border basis. The paper argues for strong financial services industry involvement in this. Originality/value – The value of the paper is twofold – Its primary value is as the first academic analysis of the ECOFIN conclusions and as a predictor of their likely influence on EU institutional balance in the financial services area. Secondly it is a useful review of the main developments with regard to EU <b>supervisory</b> <b>convergence</b> over the five years 2001 - 2006 – something which, to be the best of my knowledge, has not previously been carried out in the academic literature.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to find out whether integration of the non-euro states in the banking union, with its strengths and its weaknesses, is the right solution for those Member States. According to the opinions of many experts, banking union will strengthen the economic integration process. In addition, Member States outside the euro area have doubts about "equal rights and obligations for all Member States" within the banking union. With all {{the pros and cons of}} related banking union (the legal right to exit, making decisions, the degree of responsibility of <b>supervisory</b> <b>convergence,</b> coverage), most experts are in favor of joining the union banking by the non-euro area Member States. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{relevance}} to emerging economies of three major financial reforms following the global financial crisis of 2007 - 2009 : (1) the improved capital requirements intended {{to reduce the risk}} of bank failure ("Basel III"), (2) the improved recovery and resolution regimes for global banks, and (3) the development of supervisory colleges of cross-border financial institutions to improve <b>supervisory</b> cooperation and <b>convergence.</b> The paper also addresses the implications of these regulatory reforms for Asian emerging markets...|$|R

40|$|In 2015, the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) Economic Community was {{formally}} established and its {{aim was to}} achieve, among other things, an integrated securities market within ASEAN. Before the formal establishment of the ASEAN Economic Community, in 2009, {{with a view to}}wards achieving the objective of securities integration, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand adopted the ASEAN Disclosure Standards, a set of harmonized disclosure standards for issuers making cross-border initial public offerings (IPOs). These participating Member States also entered into a framework for the expedited review for cross-listings. However, more than 5 years later, there is no documented use of the ASEAN Disclosure Standards; cross-border IPOs and cross-listings remain rare. This article is a study of cross-border IPOs of issuers in, and cross-listings within, the participating Member States during the 2010 – 2014 period, with a view to obtaining insights on how issuers access capital markets. These insights are relevant to the broader questions about the long-term viability of ASEAN’s regulatory policies of promoting integration through harmonization of minimum standards along with limited mutual recognition. This article compares the ASEAN approach with the EU Prospectus Directive and the Trans-Tasman Mutual Offering Framework. This article argues that to move to a truly pan-ASEAN equity offering, there needs to be, at a minimum, a greater <b>supervisory</b> and enforcement <b>convergence...</b>|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to review current trends in reforms of the {{supervisory}} architecture in European Union (EU) countries. Design/methodology/approach – Against the background of the debate on the advisability of further centralizing prudential supervision in the EU this paper develops a study of applied institutional economics, analyzing the financial supervisory architecture of each of the 27 EU countries and assesses their degree of institutional convergence. The paper investigate whether the recent wave of reforms are leading to a convergence of the national architectures. Findings – While the degree of <b>supervisory</b> <b>convergence</b> is low, there is no single superior model of bank supervision. Originality/value – The paper contributes to the debate on convergence of supervisory architectures in EU member countries.

40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the recent financial crisis, the European legislator has strictly recommended the introduction of deeper forms of intervention to the European Authorities, also re-distribuiting the relations between the latter and the national sectoral authorities. In this renewed context, there is also a significant change {{in the way in which}} domestic control bodies - now linked to the inputs of the European Authorities in terms of modus operandi - intervene in the market in order to ensure their stability and equilibrium. However, significant differences in the relationships between the various national market-specific Authorities in the market and the corresponding European Authorities are still alive; in this respect, it is worth mentioning that Europan Authorities do not actually reflect a uniform disciplinary framework (with obvious consequences on the content and the modalities of the actions that can be take into account). There is therefore a difference in the relationship between the national authorities and the intermediaries involved in the their sphere of action. Moreover, if it is true that in the medium to long-term perspective, a broader transfer of powers from the national authorities to the European ones (in view of a more complete definition / determination of the supervisory policies) will take place it is very likely that this event will occur only after the definition of the single rule book, which presumably will be followed by a strengthening of the <b>supervisory</b> <b>convergence</b> and a stronger role of ESMA, as suggested by its recent documents...|$|E
40|$|The post-crisis {{financial}} services regulatory overhaul, and, particularly, {{the creation of}} the European System of Financial Supervision (ESFS) and the Banking Union mechanisms, has increased the complexity of the EU’s financial supervisory architecture. In this new system, financial supervision is carried out by a network of interconnected financial supervisors, with different mandates and subject to various accountability structures, operating at both the Member State and EU levels and bound by a regime of cooperation duties. An efficient cooperation among and within the various levels of this complex supervisory architecture is critical for the good functioning of the EU’s financial system. This paper identifies and analyses key supervisory cooperation challenges in the single market for {{financial services}}, and assesses whether the EU legal and regulatory frameworks effectively address them. The paper argues that, despite the advancement of EU financial services integration and <b>supervisory</b> <b>convergence</b> that the post-crisis regulatory overhaul has brought, there are important legal and regulatory obstacles to an efficient supervisory cooperation in the EU; these source, primarily, from the following: first, the lack of clarity and precision of the EU’s regime on supervisory cooperation duties; secondly, the limited applicability of the ESFS’s mediation mechanisms to supervisory cooperation disputes; and, thirdly, the tensions between transnational mandates of financial supervision and national accountability structures and mandates. The paper also examines the threats that Brexit and the EU’s political crisis pose to EU financial integration and supervisory cooperation...|$|E
40|$|The Lamfalussy {{process was}} {{implemented}} from early 2001, following {{the report of}} the Committee of Wise Men on the Regulation of European Securities Markets, chaired by Alexandre Lamfalussy. Four years on, this paper concludes that, while {{it is too early to}} assess progress in areas such as implementation and enforcement (Levels 3 and 4 of the Lamfalussy process), significant progress has been made in implementing the proposals contained in the original Lamfalussy Report. Preparation of EU legislation affecting securities markets is now more transparent, with better involvement of external stakeholders and enhanced political cooperation between all the institutions (Commission, Council and European Parliament). This has resulted in an improvement in the quality of legislation and an acceleration of the legislative process. The use of implementing measures will make it easier and faster to adapt Community legislation in the future. The process is also encouraging regulatory and <b>supervisory</b> <b>convergence.</b> Nevertheless, this paper suggests further improvements that could be made in areas such as consultation, including better involvement of consumers; timetables for transposing measures into national law; focusing more on general rules and principles in framework legislation (Level 1) and avoiding over-prescription in implementing measures (Level 2); achieving more consistent implementation across member states (Level 3); further strengthening political accountability; and strengthening efforts to foster greater understanding of the Lamfalussy process.

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to analyze the {{implementation}} process of Basel II so to understand whether {{and to what extent}} national discrepancies might cause problems of competitive neutrality and thus invalidate the significant level of harmonization in capital adequacy regulation which was successfully achieved by Basel I. To achieve this result, this work looks at three different issues. The first paper looks at the negotiation process of an international soft law agreement and tries to understand whether it is able to explain its implementation results in terms of the actual degree of compliance across different countries. A game theory coordination model is suggested as a theoretical answer to this question, while the two Basel Accord cases are used to test the model empirically. The appreciation of the circumstances that led to the two Accords is proved as indicative of the reasons behind the widespread adoption of the Basel I Accord as opposed to the piecemeal implementation of Basel II. The {{aim of the}} second paper is then focus on the actual implementation of Basel II and to analyze how its second Pillar is likely to impact the banking industry in Europe. It finds evidence of a piecemeal implementation of Pillar II rules across Member States (MSs) which, in turn, is able to cause an alteration of the level playing field among banks depending on the country they are incorporated in,. It concludes that there is a clear case for further harmonization not only by reducing the extent of national discretions at the regulatory level, but more importantly in building up further arrangements for <b>supervisory</b> <b>convergence</b> and coordination. With the third paper the attention is finally drawn to possible problems of competitive neutrality arising from the fact that under Basel II "standardized" banks' level of capital is indirectly determined by rating agencies. Being their predictions often inconsistent one with the other, banks can in principle enact regulatory arbitrage strategies. And despite minimum standards are required by means of a common recognition process, the consistency of national authorities' assessment is still not guaranteed and banks might thus be provided with undue regulatory capital relief. A more institutional answer is needed if Europe wants in real fact to ensure competitive neutrality across MSs...|$|E
