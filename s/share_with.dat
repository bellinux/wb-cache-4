Studies of their life-history traits, behavior and ecology help understanding of primate evolution, since they are thought to share similarities with ancestral primates.|$|E

5|$|Australian Cattle Dogs {{have been}} {{successful}} in a range of dog sports including weight pulling, flyball and schutzhund. The breed is particularly suited to activities that a dog can <b>share</b> <b>with</b> its owner such as canicross, disc dog, and skijoring or bikejoring. It is an effective hiking companion because of its natural endurance, its general lack of interest in hunting, and preference for staying by its owner's side. Most Australian Cattle Dogs love the water and are excellent swimmers. It is not a hyperactive breed, and once one has had its exercise, it is happy to lie at its owner's feet, or to rest in its bed or crate while keeping an ear and eye open for signs of pending activity. The Australian Cattle Dog is an adaptable dog that can accept city or indoor living conditions, if its considerable exercise and companionship needs are met.|$|E

5|$|Frogs have three-chambered hearts, {{a feature}} they <b>share</b> <b>with</b> lizards. Oxygenated {{blood from the}} lungs and de-oxygenated blood from the respiring tissues enter the heart through {{separate}} atria. When these chambers contract, the two blood streams pass into a common ventricle before being pumped via a spiral valve to the appropriate vessel, the aorta for oxygenated blood and pulmonary artery for deoxygenated blood. The ventricle is partially divided into narrow cavities which minimizes the mixing of {{the two types of}} blood. These features enable frogs to have a higher metabolic rate and be more active than would otherwise be possible.|$|E

For if he had not done this, he would never have been received by him, on account of the many crimes which he had committed. It is said that he obeyed readily, manifesting in his conduct a genuine and pious fear of God.|$|E

5|$|In January 1998, Olav Nils Sunde {{announced}} that he would establish a low-cost airline following the opening of the new airport. The company would be led by CEO Morten Andersen, who previously had been CEO of Norway Airlines, and the lawyer Stein Øxseth. Sunde would own 92% of the company through his shipping company Larvik Scandi Line, while Andersen and Øxseth would own 4% each. The company would be a brand extension of Sunde's shipping company Color Line. The company aimed at a 15–20% market <b>share,</b> <b>with</b> 1.4 million passengers annually. It was the first low-cost airline in Norway. The company launched tickets down to NOK 500 each way, and sold cheap tickets without demanding that the traveler be away during a weekend.
