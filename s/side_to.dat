They were the first English <b>side</b> <b>to</b> travel by {{aeroplane}} to a domestic away match, when they visited Newcastle United on 19 April 1957, and the first First Division <b>side</b> <b>to</b> play a match on a Sunday, when they faced Stoke City on 27 January 1974. On 26 December 1999, Chelsea became the first British <b>side</b> <b>to</b> field an entirely foreign starting line-up (no British or Irish players) in a Premier League match against Southampton.|$|E

5|$|Almost 24 {{hours after}} the dramatics in Barcelona, a crowd of 500,000 people turned up {{on the streets of}} Manchester to greet the United players, who paraded through the city in an open-top bus. As champions of Europe, Manchester United were invited to play in the Intercontinental Cup against Brazilian side Palmeiras in Tokyo.

5|$|Birmingham {{became the}} first English club <b>side</b> <b>to</b> take part in European {{competition}} when they played their first group game in the inaugural Inter-Cities Fairs Cup competition on 15 May 1956; {{they went on to}} reach the semifinal where they drew 4–4 on aggregate with Barcelona, losing the replay 2–1. They were also the first English club <b>side</b> <b>to</b> reach a European final, losing 4–1 on aggregate to Barcelona in the 1960 Fairs Cup final and 4–2 to A.S. Roma the following year. In the 1961 semifinal they beat Internazionale home and away; no other English club won a competitive game in the San Siro until Arsenal managed it more than 40 years later. Gil Merrick's side saved their best form for cup competitions. Though opponents in the 1963 League Cup final, local rivals Aston Villa, were pre-match favourites, Birmingham raised their game and won 3–1 on aggregate to lift their first major trophy. In 1965, after ten years in the top flight, they returned to the Second Division.|$|E

The nostrils, eyes and ears are elevated above {{the top of the}} flat head enabling them to remain above {{the surface of the water}} when the animal is floating. Valves seal the nostrils and ears when it is submerged. Unlike other reptiles, crocodilians have hearts with four chambers allowing complete separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood.|$|E

5|$|Gromoboi {{suffered}} 87 {{dead and}} 170 wounded; {{far more than}} Rossias 44 dead and 156 wounded. This was attributable to Rossias captain's policy of ordering the gun crews for his quick-firing guns on the engaged <b>side</b> <b>to</b> lie down and those on the unengaged <b>side</b> <b>to</b> go below, {{in contrast to the}} Gromoboi keeping her light guns manned at all times. Gromoboi was hit fifteen times on the starboard side of her hull and seven times on her port side, plus other hits in her funnels, boats and decks. She also suffered a fire caused by the ignition of excess propellant charges. Despite this number of hits, she was not badly damaged because her waterline belt was not penetrated. She was repaired within two months by the rudimentary facilities available at Vladivostok.|$|E

5|$|Invitations {{to enter}} the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, a {{football}} tournament set up to promote industrial trade fairs, were extended to the city hosting the trade fair rather than to clubs. Some cities entered a select team including players {{from more than one}} club, but Aston Villa, the other major club based in the city of Birmingham, rejected the opportunity to field a combined team. Thus Birmingham City became the first English club <b>side</b> <b>to</b> play in European competition when they played their first match in the 1955–58 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup on 15 May 1956. They were also the first English club <b>side</b> <b>to</b> reach a European final, the 1960 Fairs Cup final, in which they met Barcelona. The home leg, a goalless draw, was played on 29 March 1960 and the away leg, which Barcelona won 4–1, some six weeks later. In the semifinal of the 1961 Fairs Cup Birmingham beat Internazionale home and away; no other English club beat them in a competitive match in the San Siro until Arsenal did so in the Champions League over 40 years later.|$|E
