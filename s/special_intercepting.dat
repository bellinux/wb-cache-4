5000|$|The system <b>intercepts</b> <b>special</b> {{characters}} in cooked mode and interprets special meaning from them. [...] Backspace, delete, and Control-D are typically used to enable line-editing for the input to the running programs, and other control characters such as Control-C and Control-Z {{are used for}} job control or associated with other signals. The precise definition {{of what constitutes a}} cooked mode is operating system-specific.|$|R
5000|$|The concept {{behind the}} {{littoral}} combat ship, {{as described by}} former Secretary of the Navy Gordon R. England, is to [...] "create a small, fast, maneuverable and relatively inexpensive member of the DD(X) family of ships." [...] The ship is easy to reconfigure for different roles, including anti-submarine warfare, mine countermeasures, anti-surface warfare, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, homeland defense, maritime <b>intercept,</b> <b>special</b> operations, and logistics. Due to its modular design, the LCS {{will be able to}} replace slower, more specialized ships such as minesweepers and larger assault ships.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the morning}} of 27 January 2004, a {{commando}} of the Grupo Aeromóvil de Fuerzas Especiales (GAFE), the Mexican Army <b>Special</b> Forces, <b>intercepted</b> Torres Félix at a rural community known as La Tula, just outside the city of Culiacán, Sinaloa. To avoid the capture of their boss, at least 30 of Torres Félix's gunmen confronted the GAFE soldiers as the drug lord fled {{to one of his}} many safe houses in Culiacán. But Torres Félix was later arrested at Colinas de San Miguel neighborhood in Culiacán. That same afternoon, the Army transferred the drug lord to Mexico City and handed him over to the PGR. Prior to his arrest, Torres Félix was widely {{regarded as one of the}} top leaders of the Sinaloa Cartel, and the right-hand man of [...] "El Mayo" [...] Zambada. He operated in the southern parts of Sinaloa and oversaw drug trafficking shipments through Baja California Sur and the United States. Following the arrest, his brother Manuel Torres Félix took his position in the cartel and became one of the most trusted men of El Mayo Zambada.|$|R
40|$|The article {{analyzes}} the known systems {{and methods of}} protection of confidential talks in the car, {{on the basis of}} this analysis revealed their major shortcomings and proposed new promising systems, in which either there are not the drawbacks, or their impact on the promising systems is minimized. The publication presents descriptions of two proposed perspective systems, their principles and implementation schemes. In addition, to assess the effectiveness of the proposed systems, the article presents the results of experiments, carried out using <b>special</b> equipment to <b>intercept</b> the acoustic information in a simulation of the confidential negotiations in the car with protection of the proposed systems and without it...|$|R
40|$|Superconducting YBaCuO {{thin films}} were {{equipped}} with a special arrangement of antidots (holes) of 1 micron radius in order to guide the stream of magnetic flux moving in (or out of) the sample. The flux distribution and its dynamics were visualized using real-time magneto-optical imaging. It is clearly demonstrated that one-dimensional antidot arrays strongly facilitate propagation of magnetic flux. We also demonstrate a possibility to alter the direction of flux motion in a controlled way by <b>special</b> arrangement of <b>intercepting</b> antidot arrays. Our resolution was sufficient for observation of flux in particular antidots, which allows a more detailed dynamic analysis of such systems.

40|$|In the 2015 Pb-Pb {{collision}} {{run of the}} LHC, {{the power}} of the secondary beams emitted from the interaction point by the bound-free pair production process reached new levels while the propensity of the bending magnets to quench is higher at the new magnetic field levels. This beam power is about 70 times greater than that contained in the luminosity debris and is focussed on a specific location. As long foreseen, orbit bumps were introduced in the dispersion suppressors around the highest luminosity experiments to mitigate the risk by displacing and spreading out these losses. An experiment designed to induce quenches and determine the quench levels and luminosity limit was carried out to assess the need for <b>special</b> collimators to <b>intercept</b> these secondary beams...|$|R
5000|$|In his May 2006 {{confirmation}} {{hearing before the}} Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, U.S. Coast Guard Commandant Thad Allen described Project Scorpion as [...] "an archetypal national-level collaborative partnership with DHS, DOJ, and DOD counterparts under Coast Guard leadership to identify, track and <b>intercept</b> <b>special</b> interest aliens with possible terrorist or affiliate ties before they arrive in the U.S. via maritime means.". [...] As well as being a tool for 'intercepting persons deemed as threats' outside the United States, Admiral Allen noted the importance of Project Scorpion {{as part of the}} wider U.S. Coast Guard Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA), pursuing the acquisition of data on the global environment which may have bearing on threats and vulnerabilities to U.S. ports.|$|R
5000|$|Yalova, {{central city}} of the Yalova Province is at the {{northern}} coast. Most district centers of the province are in the coastal area of the peninsula. The peninsula is named after Armutlu district. Gölcük, a town in Kocaeli Province, {{best known for the}} Turkish Navy's main naval base with shipyard and the Ford Otosan automobile plant, is located at the northern gulf of the peninsula. Also on the northern coastline between Gölcük and Yalova, Karamürsel is located in Kocaeli Province. Historically, it was an important Ottoman naval base and during the Cold War era, the town hosted a United States naval air station, which operated a <b>special</b> antenna to <b>intercept</b> Soviet Union radio transmissions. West of Yalova, Çınarcık is located, a well-known seaside resort.|$|R
5|$|Alipate {{was signed}} by the Saskatchewan Roughriders in 1989 but {{released}} {{prior to the start}} of the regular season. Nevertheless, he rejoined the team and played in 17 regular season games that year. Alipate benefited from a slew of linebacker injuries, and he finished the season as one of only two linebackers on the Roughriders who avoided injury in 1989. In a Week 17 win against the Calgary Stampeders, Alipate blocked a punt on <b>special</b> teams and <b>intercepted</b> Tom Porras to be named the CFL's Defensive Player of the Week. Alipate made 31 tackles and three fumble recoveries during his rookie season and was named the Roughriders' nominee for the Rookie of the Year award. Alipate recovered a fumble during the West Division Final, setting up a touchdown drive. The Roughriders went on the upset the championship-favorite Edmonton Eskimos 32–21 to become division champions. The Roughriders won the 77th Grey Cup 43–40 against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats. In 1990, Alipate played in all 18 regular season games for the Roughriders and made 35 tackles.|$|R
5000|$|Black Adam {{appears in}} the Justice League Action episode [...] "Shazam Slam", voiced by Gary Cole. He first appears where he invades the Rock of Eternity. After the Wizard summons Billy Batson, Black Adam uses a <b>special</b> orb to <b>intercept</b> the {{lightning}} bolt that transforms Billy into Shazam. Upon imprisoning Billy, Black Adam tosses the Wizard out of the Rock of Eternity. Black Adam then unleashes the Brothers Djinn onto the Earth. With help from Batman, the Wizard was able to free Billy Batson where he became Shazam and defeated. Shazam then banishes Black Adam to the farthest reaches of the galaxy. Later on, Black Adam returns where he helps the remaining Brothers Djinn Abnegazar, Rath, and Nyorlath fight Superman, Wonder Woman, John Constantine, Green Arrow, Plastic Man, and Swamp Thing. The tide is turned when Batman arrives as Billy Batson transforms into Shazam where the Justice League defeats Black Adam, Abnegazar, Rath, and Nyorlath. The four of them were then thrown into a portal where John Constantine sent them someplace to where Batman couldn't get the answer to from John Constantine.|$|R
5000|$|Shazam (referred to as [...] "The Wizard") {{appears in}} the Justice League Action episode [...] "Classic Rock," [...] voiced by Carl Reiner. He is first seen when his former student Black Adam breaks into the Rock of Eternity. The Wizard summons Billy Batson so that Shazam can fight him. When Billy Batson quotes Shazam, Black Adam uses a <b>special</b> sphere to <b>intercept</b> the powers before {{capturing}} Billy, freeing the Brothers Djinn, and casting the Wizard out. While on patrol in Gotham City, Batman comes across the Wizard fighting some creatures sent by Black Adam and helps him. The Wizard reluctantly asks Batman {{to help him get}} to the Rock of Eternity in order to free Billy Batson. While Batman fights Black Adam, the Wizard tells Billy Batson to focus hard enough so that the orb can break enough for Billy to become Shazam. Once that is successful, Billy Batson becomes Shazam to help fight Black Adam while the Wizard regains his powers. Once Black Adam is defeated, the Wizard uses his magic to send Black Adam to the farthest reaches of the galaxy.|$|R
50|$|During the 1942-1943 Winter Offensive, {{intelligence}} was always concerning convoys with {{particular emphasis on}} US-UK lanes. During 1943, when U-boat operations moved to a defensive Battle of the Atlantic Campaign Climax, a distinct type of message began to be exchanged, which eventually became commonplace, i.e. Allied contact and attack reports. Defense situations reports, became remarkable for their length and new editions. Reports of distant areas, like the Caribbean became more common. By Winter 1943-44, and the resumption of an offensive war against Allied convoys (Battle of Atlantic Final Years) brought back convoy messages. With the difficulties of finding convoys to attack, and with the Allies now reading all communications that the Kriegsmarine sent, concurrently, with daily allied operations, new types of intelligence messages including direction finding (Direction finding) (Radio direction finder) on positions of Allied units and <b>special</b> reports from <b>intercept</b> parties aboard U-boats became more prominent. Particular concerns included Allied location devices, the positions of U.S. Navy Escort carrier groups (In an attempt to ensure that U-boats surface safely). Attempts were made to evaluate new kinds of underwater sounds, particularity related to ASDIC, search buoys and countering devices for acoustic torpedo.|$|R
40|$|The 2015 Pb-Pb {{collision}} {{run of the}} LHC operated at a {{beam energy}} of 6. 37 Z TeV. The power of the secondary beams emitted from the interaction point by the bound-free pair production (BFPP) process reached new levels while the propensity of the bending magnets to quench is higher at the new magnetic field levels. This beam power is about 70 times greater than that contained in the luminosity debris and is focussed on a specific location. As long foreseen, orbit bumps were introduced in the dispersion suppressors around the highest luminosity experiments to mitigate the risk of quenches by displacing and spreading out these losses. Because the impact position and intensity of these secondary beams is well known and can be tracked easily with the Beam Loss Monitors (BLMs), the BFPP 1 beam (208 Pb 81 + ions), {{which is the most}} intense, provides a tool to accurately measure the steady state quench limit of the LHC main dipoles. At the moment the exact quench limit is not known, but this knowledge is important to assess the need for <b>special</b> collimators to <b>intercept</b> these secondary beams. This note describes the procedure and preliminary results of a test conducted on the main dipole in cell 11 left of IP 5, using the BFPP 1 beam to provoke a quench of this magnet...|$|R
5000|$|Modern U.S. frigates mainly perform anti-submarine warfare for {{carrier and}} expeditionary strike groups and provide armed escort for supply convoys and {{merchant}} shipping. They {{are designed to}} protect friendly ships against hostile submarines in low to medium threat environments, using torpedoes and LAMPS helicopters. Independently, frigates are able to conduct counterdrug missions and other maritime interception operations. As {{in the case of}} destroyers, frigates are named after U.S. Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard heroes. As of autumn 2015, the U.S. Navy has retired its most recent class of frigates, and expects that by 2020 the Littoral Combat Ships (LCS) will assume many of the duties the frigate had with the fleet. The LCS is a class of relatively small surface vessels intended for operations in the littoral zone (close to shore). It was [...] "envisioned to be a networked, agile, stealthy surface combatant capable of defeating anti-access and asymmetric threats in the littorals". They have the capabilities of a small assault transport, including a flight deck and hangar for housing two helicopters, a stern ramp for operating small boats, and the cargo volume and payload to deliver a small assault force with fighting vehicles to a roll-on/roll-off port facility. The ship is easy to reconfigure for different roles, including anti-submarine warfare, mine countermeasures, anti-surface warfare, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, homeland defense, maritime <b>intercept,</b> <b>special</b> operations, and logistics, all by swapping mission-specific modules as needed. The LCS program is still relatively new as of 2015 with only a few active ships, but the navy has announced plans for up to 32 ships. (See: List of littoral combat ships) The navy has announced that a further 20 vessels to be built after that will be redesignated as 'frigates'.|$|R
