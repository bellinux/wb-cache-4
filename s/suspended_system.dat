40|$|An electromagnetically <b>suspended</b> <b>system</b> can be {{regarded}} as a typical second order mass-spring-damping system. The system dynamic response and stability are somehow related to its PID (proportional, integral and derivative) controller feedback parameters. Although the integral feedback is largely used to eliminate its offset errors at lower frequency, the actual stiffness and damping coefficients related to PD control are vital for the accurate prediction of the <b>suspended</b> <b>system</b> responses during design stage. Numerous studies have attempted to estimate these coefficients directly or indirectly without much success. The problem is due to the frequency-dependent nature of the active magnetic bearing (AMB) system i. e. time lags in sensors, digital signal processing, amplifiers, filters, eddy current and hysteresis losses in the electromagnetic coils. This paper seeks to address this problem, by proposing a one-axis electromagnetic suspension system to simplify the measurement requirements and eliminate the possibility of control force cross-coupling capabilities. This would lead to a better understanding and a design platform for optimal vibration control strategy of <b>suspended</b> <b>system.</b> This is achieved by injecting Schroeder Phased Harmonic Sequences (SPHS), a multi-frequency test signal, to persistently excite all possible <b>suspended</b> <b>system</b> modes. By treating the system as a black box, the parameter estimation of the “actual ” stiffness and damping coefficients in the frequency domain are realised experimentally. The digitally implemented PID controller also facilitated changes on the feedback gains, and this allowed numerous system response measurements with their corresponding estimated stiffness and damping coefficients...|$|E

However, large scale production of Cyanobacteria is not economically feasible due to high cost involved in separation of biomass. In this context, different attachment systems have been developed for the growth of Cyanobacteria on a solid support. In this study, a simple and economical attachment system using polystyrene foam for growth of Cyanobacteria has been presented.

The amoebae perceived all the <b>suspended</b> <b>systems</b> to be unfavourable for growth, despite being challenged {{with high levels of}} prey, and as a consequence they exhibited a starvation response. However, the response differed between species, with A. castellanii producing characteristic cysts and H. vermiformis producing round bodies.

An important issue in ‘elevatoring ’ is to transport passengers with minimal residual motion once the elevator has reached its destination floor.

The experimental measurements {{presented in this paper}} have been performed at the Low Frequency Facility, a high finesse optical cavity 1 cm long suspended to a mechanical seismic isolation system like the one of the VIRGO gravitational wave antenna. Because of the radiation pressure between the two mirrors of the cavity, the dynamic behavior of the system is characterized by the optical spring stiffness.

A single-channel controller is also investigated. If the base structure were rigid, a collocated control strategy based on feedback of the equipment absolute velocity reduces the vibration transmission by skyhook damping. In this study, the vibrating base is flexible so that no rigid ground is available to react the secondary forces off. The direct velocity feedback (DVFB) control implemented here is shown to be very stable, however, so that high control gains could be applied. Effective damping ratios of up to 600 % in the modes of the <b>suspended</b> <b>system</b> could be introduced by the two control channels. The passive isolation performance is thus dramatically improved by the two-channel controller: the heave mode is reduced by up to 40 dB, whereas the amplitude of the pitching mode is attenuated up to 26 dB. The experimental results also show a global improvement in the vibration caused by the resonances of the base plate over the frequency range of control [0 – 200 Hz]. The control effect decreases with frequency {{as a consequence of}} the increasing efficiency of the passive isolation. It is also shown that if the feedback gains are equal for the two control channels, the control effect is the same as adding equal damping terms to the two modal responses of the mounted equipment. Finally, the control is shown to be robust to changes in the plate support dynamics, since adding masses at various positions on the base plate did not destabilize the system...|$|E
40|$|Aeroponics, {{the process}} of growing plants {{suspended}} in air without soil or media, provides clean, efficient, and rapid food production. Crops can be planted and harvested year-round without interruption, and without contamination from soil, pesticides, and residue. Aeroponic systems also reduce water usage by 98 percent, fertilizer usage by 60 percent, and eliminate pesticide usage altogether. Plants grown in aeroponic systems {{have been shown to}} absorb more minerals and vitamins, making the plants healthier and potentially more nutritious. The <b>suspended</b> <b>system</b> also has other advantages. Since the growing environment can be kept clean and sterile, the chances of spreading plant diseases and infections commonly found in soil and other growing media are greatly reduced. Also, seedlings do not stretch or wilt while their roots are forming, and once the roots are developed, the plants can be easily moved into any type of growing media without the risk of transplant shock. Lastly, plants tend to grow faster in a regulated aeroponic environment, and the subsequent ease of transplant to a natural medium means a higher annual crop yield. For example, tomatoes are traditionally started in pots and transplanted to the ground at least 28 days later; growers using an aeroponic system can transplant them just 10 days after starting the plants in the growing chamber. This accelerated cycle produces six tomato crops per year, rather than the traditional one to two crop cycles. These benefits, along with the great reduction in weight by eliminating soil and much of the water required for plant growth, illustrate why this technique has found such enthusiastic support from NASA. Successful long-term missions into deep space will require crews to grow some of their own food during flight. Aeroponic crops are also a potential source of fresh oxygen and clean drinking water, and every ounce of food produced and water conserved aboard a spacecraft reduces payload weight, decreasing launch costs and freeing room for other cargo...|$|E

This paper presents {{an investigation into the}} removal of these compounds using photocatalysis with UV/Ti 0 ₂. Our focus was on the performance of immobilised Ti 0 ₂, due to its simplicity in terms of recovery and reuse compared to the Ti 0 ₂ particles in the suspension form. The influence of adding another oxidant (i. e., hydrogen peroxide) and presence of natural organic matter (i. e., humic acid) was also investigated. It was found that for the same UV exposure area, immobilisation of the Ti 0 ₂ particles led to a slower rate of degradation when compared with the suspended Ti 0 ₂ system; total degradation of geosmin and MIB at concentrations of <SO 0 ng/L each required more than 60 minutes in the immobilised Ti 0 ₂ photoreactor, compared to less than 30 minutes in the suspended Ti 0 ₂ photoreactor. This result is likely due to the presence of a greater number of UV-activated Ti 0 ₂ particles in the <b>suspended</b> <b>system,</b> as a result of sample mixing, than in the immobilised system. Addition of hydrogen peroxide improved the degradation performance of the immobilised Ti 0 ₂ system only at H₂ 0 ₂ concentrations exceeding 120 mg/L, {{despite the fact that the}} corresponding UV/hydrogen peroxide process alone exhibited significant degradation of geosmin and MIB. It was also found that low humic acid concentrations (up to 1. 4 mg/L) had positive impact on the degradation rates for both geosmin and MIB, but higher concentrations yielded a negative effect. At 9. 3 mg/L humic acid the degradation rates of geosmin and MIB were decreased by 40 % and 80 %, respectively. These results suggest that significant improvements in the photocatalytic efficiency will be required to potentially utilise immobilised Ti 0 ₂ photoreactors for taste and odour removal in drinking water treatment applications...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1999 The Wiggins-Holmes {{extension}} of the generalized Melnikov method (GMM) is applied to weakly damped parametrically excited cross waves with surface tension in a long rectangular wave channel {{in order to determine}} if these cross waves are chaotic. The Lagrangian density function for surface waves with surface tension is simplified by transforming the volume integrals to surface integrals and by subtracting the zero variation integrals. The Lagrangian is written in terms of the three generalized coordinates (or, equivalently the three degrees of freedom) that are the time-dependent components of the velocity potential. A generalized dissipation function is assumed to be proportional to the Stokes material derivative of the free surface. The generalized momenta are calculated from the Lagrangian and the Hamiltonian is determined from a Legendre transformation of the Lagrangian. The first order ordinary differential equations derived from the Hamiltonian are usually suitable for the application of the GMM. However, the cross wave equations of motion must be transformed in order to obtain a <b>suspended</b> <b>system</b> for the application of the GMM. Only three canonical transformations that preserve the dynamics of the cross wave equations of motion are made because of an {{extension of}} the Herglotz algorithm to nonautonomous systems. This extension includes two distinct types of the generalized Herglotz algorithm (GHA). The system of nonlinear nonautonomous evolution equations determined from Hamilton's equations of motion of the second kind are averaged in order to obtain an autonomous system. The unperturbed system is analyzed to determine hyperbolic saddle points that are connected by heteroclinic orbits The perturbed Hamiltonian system that includes surface tension satisfies the KAM nondegeneracy requirements; and the Melnikov integral is calculated to demonstrate that the motion is chaotic. For the perturbed dissipative system with surface tension, the Melnikov integral is identically zero implying that a higher dimensional GMM is necessary in order to demonstrate by the GMM that the motion is chaotic. However, numerical calculations of the largest Liapunov characteristic exponent demonstrate that the perturbed dissipative system with surface tension is also chaotic.

40|$|Atherosclerosis is {{a disease}} in which low density lipoproteins (LDL) {{accumulate}} in the arterial wall due to an inflammatory response, which is triggered by the oxidation of LDL molecules that are already present in the arterial wall. Progression of atherosclerotic plaques involves many components which includes, macrophages, monocytes, LDL, oxidized-LDL, cytokines etc. Clinical data is scarce {{for the long term}} evolution of plaques, therefore, mathematical models provide an alternative to enhance our knowledge in predicting and analyzing the complex processes in the advancement of atherosclerosis. In this thesis, we study different simplified mathematical models and analyse the long term behavior of evolution of plaques. One model we studied, consisted of ordinary differential equations that could be coupled and decoupled to the blood flow. Another model was also developed, which consisted of partial differential equations and that treats the artery wall as a moving boundary problem. The ordinary differential equations (ODE) model consisted of nonlinear coupled equations for oxidized-LDL, monocytes, macrophages, foam cells and radius of the artery (which can also be translated into an equation for endothelial shear stress). The model is distinguished by model A which is decoupled to the blood flow and model B, which is coupled to blood flow. The model B we call in thesis to be self-consistent system. Both models are time dependent and do not take account of geometry of the artery. Both these models have many parameters, which affect the growth of concentrations in time. A bifurcation analysis was therefore presented in this thesis to understand the impact of varying parameters on the system. For this purpose, a complete codimension two bifurcation analysis was carried out and singularities in the system were discussed. We found that the system, model A, can also have a codimension three bifurcation point (the degenerate Bogdanov-takens point). In model A, bistability and multistability was found to depend on the value of the parameter e. The parameter e is the ingestion rate of oxidized-LDL particles by macrophages in the equation for oxidized-LDL. The regions of stable and unstable equilibria and limit cycles were depicted with the two parameter diagrams. These regions were presented for cases with ingestion rate vs. LDL intake and shear stress vs. LDL intake. A threshold value dcrit was found for the LDL particles beyond which occlusion of the plaque seems inevitable. Two other critical parameter values for ingestion rates were also found. These values bcrit and ecrit were presented along with the Hopf curve as a function of parameters (d;b) and (s;d), which constitute a critical curve in the system. In model B, the multistability was disappeared and the attachment of blood flow profile stabilized the dynamics of the artery. For understanding the long term response of the <b>suspended</b> <b>system</b> in model B, we have carried out a slow-fast system analysis. This shows that the stable healthy state of (0;M 0; 0;R 0) may be perturbed for short amount of times, but ultimately the <b>suspended</b> <b>system</b> always comes to a stationary point. This all depends on the values of parameters d;b;e. The reduction in radius was found to be proportional to cholesterol intake parameter. For longer times, the radius goes quasi-static suggesting the results to be physically viable. A complex time dependent moving endothelium model was also presented in an axi-symmetric setting {{in order to understand the}} role played by the geometry in the problem. To this end, the Navier-Stokes equations for blood flow were coupled with the convection-diffusion equation for LDL in lumen and a diffusion equation for oxidized-LDL in intima. These equations were coupled to a common boundary (the endothelium) and solved to study the long term effects of recirculation on LDL. The flux of low-density lipoproteins across the endothelium was shown to depend rather strongly on wall shear stress. For the limiting case of Poiseuille flow additional numerical simulations were performed. LDL concentrations and plaque volume were compared with the full model results. It was shown that recirculation leads to larger plaque volumes and is hence detrimental to plaque evolution. Our computations suggest that recirculation leads predominantly to a broader plaque. Comparison with Poiseuille flows also revealed that assuming a Poiseuille flow renders results that compare well with solutions of the full Navier-Stokes model. This implies that a good estimate of plaque progression can be obtained at less expense. It also validates results obtained in ODE model in which Poiseuille flow was implicitly assumed. For a better mechanical understanding of remodeling of the artery, the stress strain analysis may also be carried out. For this purpose, fluid-structure interaction (FSI) technique should be applied to the axisymmetric model we proposed. For a quantitative and realistic model the clinical data is vital to understand the growth of plaques. Such data will remain indispensable to construct increasingly realistic models and to obtain precise values of the model parameters, such that qualitatively predictive models can be realized in near future. Future close collaboration between clinical researchers and applied mathematicians will therefore be essential for progress in the this field.

40|$|Mountain bike {{suspension}} {{systems have}} been designed to improve riding performance and comfort for the cyclist. Additionally, a suspension system may reduce fatigue, energy expenditure, and enhance time trial performance. It has also been proposed, however, that using a rear suspension system on a mountain bike may be detrimental to the cyclist, causing the cyclist’s energy to be dissipated via the rear suspension system. Prior to undertaking the current research, a survey into mountain bike suspension systems was conducted to establish rider preferences, as well as their perceptions of suspension systems and riding styles. The resulting responses - that the majority of cross-country cyclists chose to ride a bike with front suspension only (a hardtail bike), despite the significant advantages that a fully <b>suspended</b> <b>system</b> has to offer – aided in the decision to address the unanswered questions that remain in this area of research. This thesis presents an investigation into mountain bike suspension systems and their effect on rider performance, quantifying the dynamic loads exerted on the bike frame and rider. Both the psychological and physiological effects of using a rear suspension system on cross-country cycling are additional considerations of this study. An initial laboratory experiment was completed to investigate the effects of rear wheel dynamics on a rough track with a high impact frequency and the consequent impact this terrain has on rider performance, comparing a full suspension and hardtail bike. Further testing was conducted on a rolling road rig, specifically designed for the purpose of the current research, which more closely represented the conditions encountered by a cyclist on a cross-country track. Testing was conducted on the rolling road rig on both a flat road and rough track, examining the interaction forces between the bike and rider. Greater resistance was experienced by cyclists when cycling on the rolling road rig compared to the roller rig which equated to the resistance encountered when cycling uphill or into a headwind. The mechanical results from both rigs were compared to dynamic simulations as a means of validating and comparing the mechanical results. An additional series of tests was carried out on an indoor track which had a similar terrain to that of the rolling road rig. This set of tests placed fewer restrictions on the cyclist as only physiological data was collected using unobtrusive portable measurement devices, and provided further results to illuminate correlations or discrepancies between the roller rig and rolling road rig experiments. The experimental rolling road rig results indicated that, when cycling on a smooth surface, the hardtail bike offered no significant physiological advantage to the cyclist; however, more power was required by the rider to pedal the fully suspended bike. This was also advocated by the simulation results. Conversely, it was highlighted that the fully suspended bike provided a significant advantage to the rider compared to the hardtail bike when cycling on extremely rough terrain on the roller rig. This was the case across the simulation results, mechanical measurements, physiological measurements and psychological measurements. Similarly, the indoor track tests indicated that cycling on a fully suspended bike provided significant advantages to a cyclist in terms of rider performance. On the contrary, the experimental rolling road rig results on a rough surface demonstrated that no significant difference was apparent between cycling on either the hardtail or fully suspended bike. This result suggests that, when a rider encounters added resistance to cycling, as is the case when cycling uphill, there is less of an advantage for a fully suspended bike even on rough terrain.

Ambient vibration tests were performed in order to estimate the dynamic characteristics of the lower vibration modes of the bridge. Structural identification is carried out by means of a manual tuning procedure based on finite element models of increasingly accuracy. The analysis allows to improve the description of boundary conditions and mechanical interaction between the bridge components. Results from local dynamic testing are used to estimate the traction on the cables and to assess the integrity of the <b>suspending</b> <b>system</b> of the bridge...|$|R
