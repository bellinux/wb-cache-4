5|$|In {{spring and}} early summer, migrant birds {{including}} the little gull, black tern, Temminck's stint and garganey may pass through {{on their way to}} breed elsewhere. In the autumn, birds arrive from the north; some, such as whimbrels, curlew sandpipers and little stints, just pausing for a few days to refuel before continuing south, others staying for the winter. Offshore, great and Arctic skuas, northern gannets and black-legged kittiwakes may pass close by in favourable winds. Large numbers of ducks winter along the coast, including many Eurasian wigeons, Eurasian teals, mallards and gadwalls, goldeneyes and northern pintails. Red-throated divers are usually on the sea, and brent geese feed on sea lettuce and other green algae.

40|$|Birds use song to {{communicate}} with conspecifics, and song can influence both intra-sexual competition and inter-sexual mate choice. Some birds produce repertoires consisting of hundreds of songs while others produce a single song type. For species with a single-song repertoire, there are varying levels of inter-individual variation which can {{be the result of}} environmental, genetic, and physiological factors. Male <b>Snow</b> <b>Buntings</b> (Plectrophenax nivalis) typically produce a single song type, and while syllable sharing occurs between individuals, many researchers have anecdotally noted the individuality of each male 2 ̆ 7 s song. To investigate this long-held assertion, we performed a detailed bioacoustic analysis of male <b>Snow</b> <b>Buntings</b> recorded in the Canadian Arctic. We use canonical discriminant analysis to provide quantitative evidence confirming that male <b>Snow</b> <b>Buntings</b> sing individually distinctive songs. Furthermore, we present the first evidence that some <b>Snow</b> <b>Buntings</b> exhibit inter-annual variation in song structure; while songs remain consistent within each year, two males changed their song type between years. Inter-individual variation in song content can have important behavioral implications, because it facilitates individual recognition and can affect individual fitness...|$|R

French and Italian wines were served, as well as mead and local beers. The dishes were made only according to French recipes. The royal court with all its innovations exerted a broad influence {{over the rest of}} aristocratic residences and noble palaces across Poland. French cuisine was in fashion and many families willingly employed French cooks and pâté makers. In the mid-18th century on Polish tables appeared the French champagne. Also, among the most influential in that period were Lithuanian, Jewish, German and Hungarian cuisine, not to mention Armenian, which arrived in Poland before the 17th century along with many settlers especially in the south-eastern part of the Commonwealth. Signature dishes of the Western Asia reached Polish tables thanks to the Armenian trade and cultural exchange with Poland's neighbor - the Ottoman Empire. Rare delicacies were brought to royal court as gifts from sultans and royal envoys. The strongest influences were noted in the cities of Lwów, Kraków, Kamieniec Podolski and Zamość due to many Armenians living there permanently. Also, because of the close contact with the Ottoman Empire, coffee (kawa) and boza became popular.|$|E

Nº 18 A (2001) : 93 - 95 Relatório da Série N. º: Ciências Biológicas e Marinhas = Life and Marine Sciences; Resumo: It {{has been known for}} many decades that <b>Snow</b> <b>Buntings</b> occur with some regularity in the Azores archipelago in winter, with flocks numbering up to 20 individuals on occasion. The majority of records are from the islands of Corvo and Faial. The origin and fate of these individuals is unknown and it is unclear whether the regular occurrence of such groups represents a wintering strategy, or rather, whether these birds have been blown off the course of their usual migration route. Seven individuals from a flock of ten <b>Snow</b> <b>Buntings</b> known to have been present on the island of Faial between 20 th March and early May 2000 were trapped on March 30 th 2000. Plumage characteristics indicated they were of the Greenland P. n. nivalis race. Measurements of body mass indicated that the fat reserves of these individuals were similar to those of <b>Snow</b> <b>Buntings</b> wintering in Scotland U. K. at the same time of year, just prior to departure to the breeding grounds. However the calculated potential flight range of the individuals from Faial varied from 500 km to 1. 800 km, averaging 1. 150 km for females and 1. 640 km for males. Whilst these average ranges would be sufficient to make continental landfall if the birds followed an easterly route, such a heading is considered improbable, given their racial characteristics. The calculated energy reserves would be insufficient to sustain continuous flight on a northerly course to continental landfall. The presence of potentially suitable breeding habitat on the neighbouring island of Pico is highlighted...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{was the first to}} {{investigate}} element concentrations in feathers of both nestling and adult <b>snow</b> <b>buntings</b> in the Arctic environment of Adventdalen. Significant differences in concentrations between nestling- and adult feathers were found, but a clear age-dependent accumulation could not be observed among nestlings, 1 year old- and 2 years or older birds. However, external contamination of adult samples could possibly mask internal accumulation. P, K, Na, Mg, Zn, Se, Rb and Hg was present in highest concentrations in nestlings, {{while the rest of the}} examined elements were present in highest concentrations in feathers of adults. No significant effect on accumulation was discovered for sex. As nestlings hatch and develop in Adventdalen, while adults complete their annual molt in the area, feathers of both groups are considered appropriate to assess local pollution. Compared to reference concentrations in other passerine birds, coal-associated elements were mostly present in lower or equal concentrations in feathers of <b>snow</b> <b>buntings</b> from Adventdalen. Al and Co differs from the other elements, as their concentrations for comparison are higher. Hence, element concentrations in feathers of <b>snow</b> <b>buntings</b> from this area, do not reflect emissions associated with coal industry to a large extent. As toxicological implications were not a main focus of this study, the results primarily report a status regarding element concentrations in nestling and adult <b>snow</b> <b>buntings</b> in Adventdalen. However, based on comparison with reference levels in other passerine species, high concentrations of Al in adults and high concentrations of Co, Se and Zn in nestling and adults could give cause for concern. Follow-up studies using other tissues and/or organs are strongly recommended to verify and further investigate the role of age and sex in accumulation of elements in <b>snow</b> <b>buntings.</b> Such analysis combined with environmental analysis could also provide a better basis for a conclusion regarding environmental exposure, and hence, emissions from the coal power plant located in Longyearbyen. High concentrations of Al in adults, in addition to high concentrations of Co, Se and Zn in nestlings and adults, require further examinations to verify levels and examine if they are of toxicological significance for the birds...|$|R

In this study I have examined if this pattern is reflected in their spring migration as well if there is a differential timing between the age classes for males. I also examined if there is a connection between wingspan and arrival time at Umeå delta for each sex and between the sexes. To make this study possible I captured and banded <b>snow</b> <b>buntings</b> during spring at Umedeltat field station and combined my data with 2012 ’s data of banded <b>snow</b> <b>buntings</b> from the same station. There was a significant difference in mean capture dates between males and females, with males arriving 1. 6 days earlier. There was also a significant difference in mean capture dates between older and younger males, older males arriving 2. 7 days earlier. When I examined the wingspan for the sexes I looked at it for each year. During 2017 there was a trend for females that those with longer wingspan arrived earlier than females with shorter wingspan. During 2012 there was a significant correlation; females with longer wingspan arrived earlier than those females with shorter wingspan. There was no correlation between males each year. I also found that in 2017 the mean captures dates for males was later than in 2012. In contrast mean capture dates for females was earlier 2017 than in 2012. My data strongly indicate that protandry is present in <b>snow</b> <b>buntings</b> as well as wingspan may have greater importance for females during their migration than males...|$|R
