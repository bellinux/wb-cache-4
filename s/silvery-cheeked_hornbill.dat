50|$|<b>Silvery-cheeked</b> <b>hornbills</b> are {{residents}} of the tall evergreen forests of East Africa from Ethiopia to South Africa. In Zimbabwe it is threatened by habitat destruction and its presence in South Africa is marginal, but it remains locally fairly common, especially in the northern and central parts of its range.|$|R
50|$|Huge great {{trees are}} noted in older suburbs like Avondale and Greendale. In Mutare, a site near the Botanical Gardens has {{a row of}} 26 giant trees {{in various states of}} health. In many places, the trees are home to {{hundreds}} of epiphytic orchids, and are a favourite vantage perch for many species of large birds including augur buzzard, bat hawks, pied crows, and <b>silvery-cheeked</b> <b>hornbills.</b>|$|R
50|$|Kenya has cheetahs (with an {{observation}} building), warthog, and a deck {{with a view}} of some springbok, lesser kudu, common eland, scimitar-horned oryx, and gray crowned cranes that roam across an African plain. saddle-billed storks and southern ground-hornbills make up the wetland-themed exhibits {{on the opposite side of}} the walkway. A bomas area, with huts to simulate a Kenyan village has lappet-faced vultures housed with white-necked ravens, Aldabra tortoises, bateleur eagles, red-flanked duikers, and blue duikers are worked into small exhibits. The walk-through Scrubland Aviary is home to several species of birds, including a white-cheeked turaco, white-faced whistling ducks, cattle egrets, a bare-faced go-away-bird, marbled ducks, lilac-breasted roller, taveta weavers, superb starlings, and a white-headed buffalo weaver, as well as side exhibits for red ruffed lemurs and <b>silvery-cheeked</b> <b>hornbills.</b>|$|R
50|$|Tropical House - The {{tropical}} {{house was}} first opened in 2004, and (including the foyer which houses the bat exhibit) covers 1100 mÂ². This area {{is home to}} a variety of tropical plants, three ponds containing goldfish and koi, a butterfly house, <b>silvery-cheeked</b> <b>hornbill</b> enclosure and a variety of free roaming animals including; common marmosets, chattering lory, black-winged lory, white-cheeked turaco, diamond dove and many more.|$|E
50|$|The trumpeter {{hornbill}} (Bycanistes bucinator) is a medium-sized hornbill, with length between 58 and 65 cm, {{characterized by a}} large grey casque on the bill, smaller in females. The eyes are brown or red, with pink surrounding skin. Body mass is between 0.45 and 1 kg. It is similar to <b>silvery-cheeked</b> <b>hornbill.</b> Distinguishing features include an all-black back, white belly and white underwing coverts (in flight, wings present white tips), and red facial skin.|$|E
50|$|The <b>silvery-cheeked</b> <b>{{hornbill}}</b> (Bycanistes brevis) {{is a large}} {{species of}} hornbill found in Africa. It measures 75 to 80 cm in length, and has a very large cream-colored casque on the beak. The head is silver-grey {{and the rest of}} the plumage is iridescent black, except for the white rump, lower back, thighs, vent and tip of the outer tail-feathers. The sexes are similar except the female has a smaller casque and reddish skin around the eyes.|$|E
40|$|<b>Silvery-cheeked</b> <b>hornbills,</b> Ceratogymna brevis, live {{in social}} groups whose members {{communicate}} with each other by harsh quacking calls. We investigated whether the rate of calling depends on the size of a group, its sex ratio, and what activity the birds are engaged in. We also looked at how the rates of calling and patterns of activity changed throughout the day. Our observations consisted of three-minute focal watches and scanning observations at three different times of day, over six days. We found a significant correlation between group size and calling rate, but no relationship between calling rate and sex ratio. The birds called significantly more in the morning and evening than during midday, a pattern that we attribute to the sharing of information at the roosting site. There was significantly more calling during flight than during other activities such as feeding and preening, and {{no significant difference between the}} relative amounts of time the hornbills spent on different activities at different times of day. We conclude that calling is a mechanism of information transfer between group members, for example about food availability and the presence of predators...|$|R
5000|$|A few {{highland}} {{bird species}} reach their southernmost occurrence here, namely the Chirinda apalis (type locality), Swynnerton's robin, a globally threatened monotypic genus, stripe-cheeked greenbul (A. m. disjunctus), moustached warbler (M. m. orientalis), white-tailed flycatcher and yellow-bellied waxbill. [...] Wide-ranging African species include crowned eagle, trumpeter and <b>silvery-cheeked</b> <b>hornbills,</b> both breeders, Livingstone's turaco, lemon dove, green pigeon, owls, nightjars, bee-eaters, pygmy kingfisher, yellow-streaked (P. f. dendrophilus) and sombre greenbuls, yellow-throated (S. r. alacris), Barratt's (B. b. priesti) and broad-tailed warblers, olive and black-fronted bushshrikes, Cape batis, sunbirds and firefinches. Various bird races were first described from this location: a strikingly coloured race of red-necked spurfowl (P. a. swynnertoni), a fulvous-coloured race of wailing cisticola (C. l. mashona), {{a race of}} bar-throated apalis (A. t. arnoldi), the smallish, dusky and streaky-throated Swynnerton's thrush (T. o. swynnertoni) which is endemic to the Eastern Highlands, and a race of olive sunbird (C. o. sclateri). The forest is situated too low for orange thrush, Roberts's warbler, malachite or bronze sunbirds, and too high for yellow-spotted nicator, white-eared barbet or grey waxbill. Crested guineafowl however inhabits its lower elevations and green malkoha recently populated the forest from lower altitudes. Blue-mantled flycatchers occupy the lower altitudes or fringing thickets, but remain segregated from white-tailed flycatchers which occupy the forest proper or higher canopy.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the start}} of 2013 the park was home to over 200 species, which includes; amazon parrot, capybara, Chilean flamingo, cockatoo, Cuban crocodile, eastern green mamba, Egyptian fruit bat, Gila monster, koi, kookaburra, lory, macaw, Mandarin duck, Nile crocodile, {{northern}} white-cheeked gibbon, pink-backed pelican, reindeer, <b>silvery-cheeked</b> <b>hornbill,</b> skunk, spiny turtle, smooth-coated otter, tiger and Vietnamese pheasant. Since then the park has grown even more and the following section gives you a rough idea of the current holdings for the park from the main animal groups - ...|$|E
50|$|Various upland birds {{recorded}} as prey include the 177 g Namaqua sandgrouse (Pterocles namaqua), the 350 g rock pigeon (Columba livia), the 84 g laughing dove (Streptopelia senegalensis), the 169 g Senegal coucal (Centropus senegalensis), the 49 g scaly-throated honeyguide (Indicator variegatus) and {{several species of}} hornbill, {{ranging in size from}} the 139 g northern red-billed hornbill (Tockus erythrorhynchus) to the 1235 g <b>silvery-cheeked</b> <b>hornbill</b> (Bycanistes brevis). Among passerines, the most frequently taken are likely to be corvids, which are often favored by Bubo owls from around the world due to their large size, relatively open nests and frequently easy-to-find, communal nocturnal roosts. To date the cape crow (Corvus capensis) and pied crow (Corvus albus) are the corvids reported in dietary studies but in Ethiopia thick-billed ravens (Corvus crassirostris), which at 1500 g are possible the heaviest corvid species in the world, mobbed them vigorously and seemed to consider them a primary threat. Smaller passerines are by no means ignored. White-eyes are among the more frequently taken smaller passerines, with the 10.9 g African yellow white-eye (Zosterops senegalensis) being the smallest identified avian prey species, although penduline tits (Anthoscopus ssp.) (thus far unidentified to species) are likely to be even smaller. The largest bird to be hunted to Verreaux's eagle-owl is {{complicated by the fact that}} they often take relatively small nestlings of larger species, such as ostriches (Struthio camelus) and grey crowned cranes (Balearica regulorum). The only avian prey items successfully attacked larger than other types of birds of prey (reviewed later) are likely bustards. Most predation records have reported on relatively small bustards, namely northern (Afrotis afraoides) and southern black korhaans (Afrotis afra), which average only 745 g and 690 g, respectively. Larger species of bustard thought to be threatened by Verreaux's eagle-owl are the 4790 g Denham's bustard (Neotis denhami) and the 8430 g kori bustard (Ardeotis kori), although it is not clear whether adults (especially males) are attacked in the latter species.|$|E
