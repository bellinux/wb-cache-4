25|$|The {{permit for}} the {{overhaul}} was found, {{but not the}} other permit stating that the pump must not be started under any circumstances due to the missing safety valve. The valve was in a different location from the pump and therefore the permits were stored in different boxes, as they were sorted by location. None of those present were aware that {{a vital part of}} the machine had been removed. The manager assumed from the existing documents that it would be safe to <b>start</b> <b>Pump</b> A. The missing valve was not noticed by anyone, particularly as the metal disc replacing the safety valve was several metres above ground level and obscured by machinery.|$|E

When we first saw him in Paris soon after the war finished he was a novice, not a roadman at all. He had come to the big city to ride in the final of the famous Médaille race at the Vélodrome d'Hiver. When he arrived at the Vélodrome d'Hiver, he had no soigneur, no dressing gown, nobody to hold him up at the <b>start,</b> <b>pump</b> his tyres or adjust his position to suit the high, frightening bankings. He was lonely — but courageous. And guess who was his principal victim — Antonio Maspes! ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{scaling up}} of a {{hydrothermal}} oxidation (HTO) facility {{depends on the}} development of simulation tools. In this way, a new approach to simulate the reactor thermal behavior during a nonstationary regime such as the start, stop, or emergency stop of the unit is developed. A numerical procedure of nonstationary temperature profile simulation in the reactor is described in order to predict the reactor thermal behavior. This new model is validated from experimental data obtained with a quasi-adiabatic reactor, which allows one to follow the temperature profile evolution along the reactor during the HTO process. Performances of the numerical procedure are tested with the simulation of three kinds of real nonstationary conditions: facility <b>start,</b> <b>pump</b> defect, and waste concentration dilution [...] ...|$|E

When the narrator exhausts the fuel reserve {{of the truck}} stop's gas station, a fuel tanker arrives to replenish the fuel cisterns. When the narrator is at a point of collapsing, he is relieved by the counterman, who <b>starts</b> <b>pumping</b> gas for his [...] "shift". The narrator says {{that he will have}} to show the girl how to handle a fuel pump, and that she had better stop being so dainty. The narrator thinks to himself that perhaps this will last only until the trucks rust and fall apart, but he then has a grim vision of forced assembly lines churning out new generations of trucks, and the trucks doing great efforts such as draining the Okefenokee Swamp and paving much of the wild backcountry, where much of the world, maybe even the oceans, will be flattened out and remade in its new masters' image. The story ends as a pair of planes fly overhead, and the narrator laments [...] "I wish I could believe there are people in them".|$|R

50|$|The {{amount of}} milk {{produced}} {{depends on how}} often the mother is nursing and/or pumping: the more the mother nurses her baby or pumps, the more milk is produced. It is beneficial to nurse when the baby wants to nurse rather than on a schedule. A Cochrane review {{came to the conclusion}} that a greater volume of milk is expressed whilst listening to relaxing audio during breastfeeding, along with warming and massaging of the breast prior to and during feeding. A greater volume of milk expressed can also be attributed to instances where the mother <b>starts</b> <b>pumping</b> milk sooner, even if the infant is unable to breastfeed.|$|R

After three hours of being clinically dead, the dogs' blood was returned to their circulatory systems, and the animals were revived by delivering an electric shock to their hearts.

40|$|Objective: We {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the basal rate and bolus doses {{in children and adolescents}} at the <b>start</b> of insulin <b>pump</b> therapy and after 1 year of use. Patients and Methods: Case records from 29 children and adolescents were examined. All <b>pumps</b> were <b>started</b> with rapid-acting insulin (Humalog). Patients were aged 13. 1 ± 3. 9 years, with a diabetes duration of 5. 4 ± 4. 1 years at <b>pump</b> <b>start.</b> Sixteen <b>pumps</b> were <b>started</b> for high hemoglobin A 1 c (HbA 1 c;> 8. 8 %, 73 mmol/mol) and 13 for other reasons. Results: Basal rates declined in both groups by 20 % at 3 days after <b>pump</b> <b>start.</b> The bolus doses were reduced by 25 – 30 % when the indication was high HbA 1 c and by 15 % in the others. After 1 year, {{there was a significant difference}} in the basal rate between age groups. The 3 – 9 -year-old age group had higher basal rates during the late evening (10 : 00 PM– 12 : 00 AM), while the 15 – 21 -year-old age group had higher basal rates in the early morning (3 : 00 AM– 7 : 00 AM). Conclusions: Insulin doses are reduced considerably when <b>starting</b> with a <b>pump</b> in pediatric practice. Younger children needed higher basal rates late in the evening (reversed dawn phenomenon), while older teenagers seem to need an increase in the morning, which may correspond to a true dawn phenomenon...|$|R

25|$|Many trains {{arrived at}} Exeter from the Bristol and Exeter Railway very late. Because the South Devon line was only {{equipped}} with a telegraph that linked the stations, the engines had to <b>start</b> <b>pumping</b> for when the timetable said that the trains were due to enter their section and then keep pumping until the train eventually passed. This meant that the engines pumped for {{twice as long as}} was necessary and meant that much more coke was consumed than would have been the case if pumping had only been undertaken when the train was actually ready to be run. The engine houses were connected to the telegraph system on 2 August 1848 but a lack of trained staff meant that it was not fully used.|$|R

No one was hurt or killed, since the bridge was closed for renovation and the sinking took some time. All of the sinking was captured on film and shown on live TV.

40|$|This project {{analyses}} {{both the}} economical and political concerns {{related to the}} fact that Ghana has just recently <b>started</b> <b>pumping</b> oil.

The economical analysis will provide a basis for the political analysis, which will investigate the political concerns regarding policies made and implemented in Ghana, that are made to ensure a sustainable economical development. The research concludes that the outlook for the Ghanaian economy is in general positive.
