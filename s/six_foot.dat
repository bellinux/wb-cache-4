5|$|A new keep was built, {{probably}} in the 13th century. This {{took the form of}} a polygonal shell keep, with fourteen triangular buttresses supporting <b>six</b> <b>foot</b> (1.8 m) thick walls. The inner bailey was strengthened with new stone walls, 20 to 30 feet (6 to 9 m) tall on top of the earlier earth banks, the walls and keep being built of flint and rubble. The castle was manned during this period by a castle-guard system, in which lands were given out to local lords in return for their providing knights and soldiers to serve at the castle.|$|E
5|$|<b>Six</b> <b>foot</b> (2m) waves {{along the}} {{coastline}} of Saint Mary's County, with Point Lookout State Park suffering $3million in damages (2003USD, ($ USD). In the county, 2,500wharves and piers were destroyed, with another 1,000moderately damaged, resulting in $10.25million in monetary damage (2003USD, ($ USD). The storm surge destroyed {{the bridge to}} Saint George Island by {{a few hours after}} the hurricane made landfall, and the flooding covered much of the island for a week. There, 20homes were destroyed. Shore revetments experienced $53.4million in damage (2003USD, ($ USD). Throughout Saint Mary's County, residential damage amounted to about $17million (2003USD, ($ USD) with about $1.5million to commercial buildings (2003USD, ($ USD). The damage was caused primarily by the storm surge, though the winds produced minor to moderate damage, the worst effects in the state from winds. In the county, the winds blew off the roof of a home and downed 70trees, leaving 27,092 without power.|$|E
25|$|Dixon {{headed to}} New York City and {{enrolled}} in the Frobisher School to study drama. As an actor, Dixon's physical appearance became a problem – he was <b>six</b> <b>foot</b> three inches tall but only weighed 150 pounds, making for a very lanky appearance. One producer remarked that because of his appearance Dixon would not succeed as an actor, but he complimented Dixon for his intelligence and attention to detail and recommended that Dixon put his love for the stage into scriptwriting. Despite the compliment, Dixon returned home to North Carolina in shame.|$|E

25|$|Originally from Toronto, {{he began}} {{studying}} at the University of Texas in 1972 and ranked {{sixth in the}} shot put at the NCAA Men's Outdoor Track and Field Championship the next year. Muscular in build and standing at <b>six</b> <b>foot</b> six inches tall (1.98m), he improved to fourth place at the following year's competition. During his time competing for the college's Texas Longhorns athletic team he earned All-American honours three times: outdoors in 1973–1974, and indoors in 1974. He began competing internationally in 1975 and {{won a gold medal}} at the 1975 World University Championships in Athletics before gaining a silver medal at the Pan American Games. In addition to this, he took national level honours with a win in the discus at the Canadian Athletics Championships.|$|E
25|$|Following {{defeat at}} the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651, Charles II escaped and headed north into Shropshire and Staffordshire with several companions {{including}} Lord Derby and Henry, Lord Wilmot. A reward of £1000 was offered for {{the capture of}} the King. It {{is likely that the}} King and anyone helping him would have been executed for treason, if caught. The King had a distinctive appearance: very dark and <b>six</b> <b>foot</b> two inches tall (1.88 m). Furthermore, there were cavalry patrols specifically tasked with finding the King. At this time it was illegal for Catholics to travel more than five miles away from their homes without a pass from the Sheriff of the County. Helping the King would therefore be hazardous.|$|E
25|$|In 1988, Mark Rucker {{directed}} a realistic production at Shakespeare Santa Cruz, starring J. Kenneth Campbell as Titus, Molly Maycock as Tamora, Elizabeth Atkeson as Lavinia, and an especially well-received performance by Bruce A. Young as Aaron. Campbell presented Titus {{in a much}} more sympathetic light than usual; for example, he kills Mutius by accident, pushing him so that he falls against a tree, and his refusal to allow Mutius to be buried was performed as if in a dream state. Prior to the production, Rucker had Young work out and get in shape so that {{by the time of the}} performance, he weighed 240lbs. Standing at <b>six</b> <b>foot</b> four, his Aaron was purposely designed to be the most physically imposing character on the stage. Additionally, he was often positioned as standing on hills and tables, with the rest of the cast below him. When he appears with the Goths, he is not their prisoner, but willingly enters their camp in pursuit of his baby, the implication being that without this one weakness, he would have been invincible.|$|E

25|$|The footage {{was shot}} by Eric Saarinen, who was on stage taking {{pictures}} of the crowd, and Baird Bryant, who climbed atop a bus. Saarinen was unaware of having caught the killing on film. This was discovered {{more than a week}} later when raw footage was screened in the New York offices of the Maysles Brothers. In the film sequence, lasting about two seconds, a two-meter (<b>six</b> <b>foot)</b> opening in the crowd appears, leaving Bredehoft in the center. Hunter enters the opening from the left. His hand rises toward the stage, and the silhouette of a revolver is clearly seen against Bredehoft's light-colored dress. Passaro is seen entering from the right and delivering two stabs with his knife as he parries Hunter's revolver and pushes him off-screen; the opening then closes around Bredehoft. Passaro was reported to have stabbed Hunter five times in the upper back, although only two stabs are visible in the footage. Witnesses also reported Hunter was stomped on by several Hells Angels while he was on the ground. The gun was recovered and turned over to police. Hunter's autopsy confirmed he was high on methamphetamine when he died. Passaro was arrested and tried for murder in the summer of 1971, but was acquitted after a jury viewed concert footage showing Hunter brandishing the revolver and concluded that Passaro had acted in self-defense.|$|E
25|$|In the Maroons' {{first season}} of {{operation}} they finished second {{last in the}} league. However, the new Forum was selling out and, {{with the addition of}} players Nelson Stewart, Babe Siebert and Bill Phillips, success came quickly. In a single year, the Maroons went from having their worst record in franchise history to their best. In only their second season of operation, Montreal won their first Stanley Cup. The NHL playoffs that year were a two-game total-goals format. Montreal won the opening series over the Pittsburgh Pirates 6–4, then upset the favored Ottawa Senators 2–1. In the NHL playoff final, Montreal defeated Ottawa to advance to the Stanley Cup final, against the Victoria Cougars of the Western Hockey League. In the last Stanley Cup final involving two different leagues, Montreal defeated Victoria three games to one. Contributing to the victory was rookie, and future Hall of Fame member, Nels Stewart, who scored six of the Maroons' ten goals in the series. Stewart won the Hart Trophy for most valuable player. While not a smooth skater, Stewart compensated with size (at <b>six</b> <b>foot</b> one and 195 pounds, he was a giant compared to other players of that era), toughness (amassing 119 penalty minutes), and shooting (scoring 34 of Montreal's 91 goals during the season). Stewart's 34 goals remained an NHL record for rookies until the 1970–71 season. During this era, a team's best players often played the entire game with substitutions only made for injuries.|$|E

[...] His resplendent diplomat's uniform, {{which he used}} on all occasions, shone brightly with gold brocade and included a high collar with white gloves, even in the tropical heat. [...] Such fashion was calculated {{to give him a}} larger-than-life presence, symbolic of the enormous empire he represented.

5000|$|The message [...] "John is <b>six</b> <b>feet</b> tall" [...] is an {{assertion}} involving truth that commits the speaker to its factuality, whereas the reified statement [...] "Mary reports that John is <b>six</b> <b>feet</b> tall" [...] defers such commitment to Mary. In this way, the statements can be incompatible without creating contradictions in reasoning. For example, the statements [...] "John is <b>six</b> <b>feet</b> tall" [...] and [...] "John is five feet tall" [...] are mutually exclusive (and thus incompatible), but the statements [...] "Mary reports that John is <b>six</b> <b>feet</b> tall" [...] and [...] "Paul reports that John is five feet tall" [...] are not incompatible, {{as they are}} both governed by a conclusive rationale that either Mary or Paul is (or both are), in fact, incorrect.|$|R

500|$|Few {{details are}} known about Smart's time at St Luke's Hospital for Lunatics. He was {{admitted}} to St Luke's on 6 May 1757 as a [...] "Curable Patient". It is possible that Smart was confined at Newbery's behest over old debts and a poor relationship that existed between the two; Newbery had previously mocked Smart's immorality in A Collection of Pretty Poems for the Amusement of Children <b>six</b> <b>Foot</b> High. Regardless of Newbery's exact reasons, there is evidence suggesting that Newbery's admittance of Smart into the mental asylum was not based on madness. To have Smart admitted, Newbery probably provided a small bribe, although bribes were against St Luke's policy.|$|E

[...] His teaching salary was not sufficient to finance this, so he spent the summer of 1904 selling a one volume encyclopaedia in the newly settled areas around Rapid City, Manitoba. [...] Besides providing him with the income he required—he was a patient, effective salesman and later boasted that he was never thrown off of a farm—the job gave the now 21-year-old Brownlee his first glimpse of Western Canada. [...] Returning to Ontario at the summer's end, he enrolled at Victoria College at the University of Toronto.|$|E
