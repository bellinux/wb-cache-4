Single c-codons or pairs were substituted in the gB sequence of constructs which were used for transfection and selection of stable transfectants. Analysis of gB expression products revealed that single <b>substitutions</b> <b>of</b> cIII or cIV, but neither single nor double <b>substitutions</b> <b>of</b> cI or/and cII prevented gB dimerization. All substituted gB derivatives were, however, no longer processed by proteolytic cleavage. After deletion of the membrane anchor domain, correct proteolytic processing was again observed for anchorless gB forms. <b>Substitutions</b> <b>of</b> cI or cI/cII in secretory gB appeared to interfere with disulfide linkage between gB cleavage fragments.

Indeed, humans deficient for DNA polymerase (pol) η have decreased <b>substitutions</b> <b>of</b> A·T base pairs in variable and switch regions.

B cells from Polh-/- mice produced normal amounts of IgG, indicating that pol η does not affect class switch recombination. Similar to their human counterparts, variable and switch regions from Polh-/- mice had fewer <b>substitutions</b> <b>of</b> A·T base pairs and correspondingly more mutations of C·G base pairs, which firmly establishes a central role for pol η in hypermutation. Notably, the location and types <b>of</b> <b>substitutions</b> differ markedly from those in Msh 6 -/- clones, which also have fewer A·T mutations.

5|$|Alcohol {{detoxification}} or 'detox' for alcoholics is {{an abrupt}} stop of alcohol drinking {{coupled with the}} <b>substitution</b> <b>of</b> drugs, such as benzodiazepines, that have similar effects to prevent alcohol withdrawal. Individuals who are only at risk of mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms can be detoxified as outpatients. Individuals at risk of a severe withdrawal syndrome {{as well as those}} who have significant or acute comorbid conditions are generally treated as inpatients. Detoxification does not actually treat alcoholism, and it is necessary to follow up detoxification with an appropriate treatment program for alcohol dependence or abuse to reduce the risk of relapse. Some symptoms of alcohol withdrawal such as depressed mood and anxiety typically take weeks or months to abate while other symptoms persist longer due to persisting neuroadaptations. Alcoholism has serious adverse effects on brain function; on average it takes one year of abstinence to recover from the cognitive deficits incurred by chronic alcohol abuse.|$|E
