50|$|Amongst {{the first}} {{structures}} {{to be built}} at Camden Park was a <b>slab</b> and <b>bark</b> hut, {{referred to as the}} 'miserable hut' by Governor Macquarie. Located to the immediate North of the Belgenny Farm complex, the area thought to have been the site of this and other huts was the subject of an archaeological dig in 2009.|$|R
50|$|The Wausau Street Railway Company built a {{pavilion}} at {{this site}} in 1908 as an attraction to encourage residents to take the trolley eight miles down from Wausau. This first pavilion was built of timbers, logs and <b>slabs</b> of <b>bark,</b> with burlap curtains in case of rain. This rustic structure burned in 1911 and was replaced with the current building.|$|R
2500|$|Early {{buildings}} were constructed of timber <b>slabs</b> and stringy <b>bark,</b> later wattle and daub became common. Plentiful sandstone {{in the area}} led to significant buildings being constructed of that material.|$|R
50|$|In cultivation, {{they are}} best {{accommodated}} on tree fern or cork <b>bark</b> <b>slabs</b> mounted bare root and given high humidity and abundant water and feeding year round, and moderate shade. They prefer moderate to warm temperatures.|$|R
50|$|The edible cambium can be {{collected}} by scraping <b>slabs</b> of removed <b>bark.</b> The resulting shavings can be eaten immediately, {{or can be}} dried and pressed into cakes for preservation. The bark {{also serves as a}} source of tannin for tanning.|$|R
50|$|Breeding {{takes place}} between May and January, peaking in September and October. The nest is usually {{built in a}} recess in a tree trunk or behind a loose <b>slab</b> of <b>bark,</b> but is {{sometimes}} in a tangle of creepers, the sheath of a palm frond, banana bunch or an abandoned farm implement. It is cup-shaped and composed of twigs and dry grasses, lined with fine rootlets. Up to four eggs are laid and incubation lasts about two weeks with the young fledging and leaving the nest in fifteen to twenty days.|$|R
60|$|Jimmy pushed two {{or three}} letters {{into his pocket and}} sat down on a cedar log. If Margaret meant to cook his breakfast, he {{imagined}} she would do so and he was satisfied to watch her. For one thing, she knew her job, and Jimmy liked to see all done properly. She did not bother him for things; she seemed to know where they were. After a time, she put the trout and some thin light cakes on a <b>slab</b> of <b>bark,</b> and Jimmy remarked that the fish were an appetizing golden brown.|$|R
50|$|Due {{to the age}} and intactness of the place, in {{particular}} the house clad in iron <b>bark</b> <b>slabs</b> and pit-sawn timbers and the mature trees of the garden, Gracemere Homestead {{has the potential to}} yield information through historical and archaeological research that will contribute to an improved understanding of Queensland's history.|$|R
5000|$|After {{clearing}} of the rainforest, {{the area}} was used mostly for dairy farms. The first white settler was John Blow. His original house was built from split timber <b>slabs,</b> with a <b>bark</b> roof. However, as his circumstances improved, he built a new home, [...] "Willow Glen" [...] which still stands today.|$|R
50|$|Many {{archaeological sites}} found contain {{scattered}} stone artefacts from old campsites, and scarred trees from which traditional people removed <b>slabs</b> of <b>bark</b> to make canoes, containers and shields. The artefact scatters are found because erosion {{of some sort}} has exposed the implements which were covered with sediment. The scarred trees are often on the creek bank, fence line or road reserve where they escaped the clearance process. Both site types exhibit traces of the hunting and gathering lifestyle of pre-contact Victoria, and are a fragile and non-renewable historical resource. Aboriginal sites are protected under the Aboriginal Heritage Act 2006.|$|R
50|$|The main {{land uses}} were grazing and agriculture, and tented {{accommodation}} on stock routes {{was replaced by}} <b>slab</b> and <b>bark</b> huts, then by more permanent buildings providing homes, housing, smithies, and hotels. Pambula had five licensed hotels by 1856 and the foundation stone for the courthouse was laid in 1860. Pambula was proclaimed a town in 1885. In 1888, gold was discovered and villages grew up around the mines at nearby Yowaka River and Pipeclay Creek. This created a boom in the town, {{but in the early}} 20th century production of gold ceased and the prosperity of the town went into a decline.|$|R
60|$|Nasmyth {{said nothing}} {{for a minute or}} two, for he felt {{compassionate}} as well as a trifle confused. He had, in fact, already discovered that there are occasions when a young woman is apt to show greater self-possession and look facts in the face more plainly than a man. Then he set to work furiously with a branch which he tore from the fallen tree, ripping off rough <b>slabs</b> of <b>bark,</b> {{and in the course of}} half an hour had constructed a shelter about the base of a cedar. It, at least, kept the rain off when Violet sat under it.|$|R
50|$|Like {{most of the}} German {{settlers}} on the Logan River reserve, the Krugers {{erected a}} <b>slab</b> and <b>bark</b> hut as their first dwelling, and concentrated on clearing the scrub, fencing the land and planting their first crop, which probably was maize. Within a few years the farm had proved viable, and the family was able to erect a larger and more substantial residence. According to a local tradition, the present farmhouse was built in 1871, the year Mrs Auguste Ernestine Kruger (née Raedel), Christian's daughter-in-law, was born. However, {{it is also possible}} the house was built , after Christian Kruger acquired title to the land.|$|R
25|$|The Upper Sin Aikst trained dogs {{to drive}} deer toward the Columbia River, where hunters in canoes shot them with bow and arrow. The Sin Aikst used the {{distinctive}} Sturgeon-nosed canoe; about 15–17 feet (4.5–5 meters) long with a cedar frame covered by large <b>slabs</b> of pine <b>bark,</b> riding {{low in the}} water with downward-sloping tips to reduce wind resistance.|$|R
5|$|Silver birch wood is pale in colour with no {{distinct}} heartwood {{and is used}} {{in making}} furniture, plywood, veneers, parquet blocks, skis, kitchen utensils and in turnery. It makes a good firewood that produces a good heat when burnt but is quickly consumed by the flames. <b>Slabs</b> of <b>bark</b> are used for making roof shingles and wooden footwear. Historically, the bark was used for tanning. Bark can be heated and the resin collected; the resin is an excellent waterproof glue and useful for starting fires. The thin sheets of bark that peel off young wood contain a waxy resin and are easy to ignite even when wet. The dead twigs are also useful as kindling for outdoor fires.|$|R

50|$|After their {{experiences}} on the Hunter River, the settlers selected the higher ground for their farms, erecting their first houses (apparently <b>slab</b> and <b>bark)</b> {{on the low}} ridge above the South Pine River where St Peter's Anglican School is now situated. Fearing attack from Aborigines, their houses were loop-holed for rifles and located within sight of each other. These precautions proved unnecessary, for {{at the request of}} Thomas Gray and other settlers in the area between Cabbage Tree Creek and Caboolture, a detachment of Native Police was stationed at Sandgate from 1858 to 1862. Under the command of Lieutenant Frederick Wheeler, the Native Police eliminated Aboriginal resistance to white settlement in the Pine Rivers, Cabbage Tree Creek and Caboolture districts by the early 1860s.|$|R
50|$|Washoe {{people are}} the only Great Basin tribe whose {{language}} is not Numic, so they {{are believed to have}} inhabited the region prior to neighboring tribes. The Kings Beach Complex that emerged about 500 CE around Lake Tahoe and the northern Sierra Nevadas are regarded as early Washoe culture. The Martis complex may have overlapped with the Kings Beach culture, and Martis pit houses gave way to conical <b>bark</b> <b>slab</b> houses of historic Washoe culture.|$|R
50|$|By November 1843, {{when the}} Commissioner of Crown Lands for New South Wales visited Jondaryan, the site {{included}} 3 huts reputedly built by James Chatman, a convict carpenter who accompanied Henry Coxen on the trek from Yarrundi to Jondaryan. At {{this time there}} were just 7 residents at the station, but by the following year that number had doubled. The Commissioner of Crown Lands records for 1844 indicate {{that the number of}} huts on the site had decreased to 2, but 4 stables had been erected by that time and work began on the first house at Jondaryan. Chatman, who had obtained a ticket-of-leave in March 1844, was again employed to build what was believed to be a rudimentary <b>slab</b> or <b>bark</b> structure. However, the ironstone ridge on which this house was built attracted lightening strikes during storms and in late 1844 it was decided to erect a new residence 2 miles upstream, where the present homestead now stands. It was constructed from sturdy iron <b>bark</b> <b>slabs</b> and floors, and remained in use as the main house at Jondaryan until 30 December 1937 when it was destroyed by fire. The kitchen, which remains on site, is the only surviving part of the original house. At much the same time that this house was being built, other slab structures were erected to support the workings of the station, including a small shearing shed and yard.|$|R
60|$|Nor {{was this}} all. Its summit was flat, {{and in the}} midst of it stood a huge tree. Even had it not been for the fruit which hung from its branches, the aspect of that tree must have struck the {{beholder}} as uncanny, even as horrible. The bark on its great bole was leprous white; and from its gaunt and spreading rungs rose branches that subdivided themselves again and again, till at last they terminated in round green fingers, springing from grey, flat <b>slabs</b> of <b>bark,</b> in shape not unlike that of a human palm. Indeed, from a little distance this tree, especially if viewed by moonlight, had the appearance of bearing on it hundreds or thousands of the arms and hands of men, all of them stretched imploringly to Heaven.|$|R
5000|$|Landsborough {{was named}} for the British born {{explorer}} William Landsborough {{who was the first}} European to cross Australia north to south. The earliest European settlers arrived in the area in 1871. Originally called Mellum Creek ("mellum" [...] is an Aboriginal word for [...] "volcano"), it dates from 1871 when Isaac Burgess erected a <b>slab</b> hut with <b>bark</b> roof as [...] "port of call" [...] for Cobb and Co coaches stopping for refreshments and a change of horses.|$|R
50|$|By 1877, when a {{property}} inspection was undertaken {{to ascertain whether}} the Mayes family were honouring their lease requirements, improvements to the property were reported. These included the erection of the 1872 hut, described as a two roomed house with bark roof, along with outbuildings including a kitchen <b>slab</b> with <b>bark</b> roof, and a water hole. A well was built near an already established water-hole popular with the local aboriginal community on the Kingston Road border of the house, providing water for the house prior {{to the construction of}} tanks. One of the daughters of John and Emily, Ruth, was drowned in the well. Extensive fencing and clearing of the land was evident in the 1877 inspection, orange trees were planted and cattle had been introduced. The original entrance to the property was via a sliprail on the Kingston Rd fence.|$|R
50|$|The land {{on which}} Frelighsburg is located was {{originally}} inhabited by the Abenaki.Frelighsburg was established as a colony in the late 1790s by American Loyalists, including pioneer Abram Freligh, a physician of German origin who lived in Clinton, New York. The sawmill built by his son in 1839, and several other buildings dating from the nineteenth century are considered historical monuments. Prior to being named Frelighsburgh it was named Conroy's Mills, after another mill owner and Slab City because of the great quantities of sawdust and <b>slabs</b> (slang for <b>bark)</b> that were there.|$|R
60|$|Carroll {{turned and}} left him. He was afraid to stand still and think, but action was a relief. It was some time before he {{returned}} with several strips of fabric cut from the tent curtain, and the neatest splints he could extemporise from <b>slabs</b> of stripped-off <b>bark,</b> and the next half-hour was a trying one to both of them. Sometimes Vane assisted him with suggestions--once he reviled his clumsiness--and sometimes he lay silent with his face awry and his lips tight set; but at length it was done, and Carroll stood up, breathing hard.|$|R
50|$|Mesquite lizards in Mexico and the {{southern}} United States have been found hibernating in groups of 2-8 in cracks or under <b>slabs</b> of <b>bark</b> in mesquite trees. Common collared lizards spend about 6 months hibernating, almost always solitarily, though pairs of juvenile females have been observed within the same hibernacula. They use the undersides of rock slabs as hibernacula, digging a small chamber in the dirt just large enough for their bodies with a small tunnel for outside access. Adults use larger rock slabs, dig deeper chambers, and have longer tunnels than juveniles. Perhaps the most extreme example {{is seen in the}} viviparous lizard, the most northern of all lizards. They can burrow into the soil, go under leaf litter, or use shelters like rocks as hibernacula. Although the air temperature in West Siberia can drop to −10 °C, the soil temperature at the depths where these lizards hibernate remains higher than −10 °C. This enables them to survive the harshest temperatures of any lizard.|$|R
50|$|The first whaling station, for shore whaling, was {{established}} in the area by John Raine in 1828. Local Aboriginal people were employed in the whaling industry. In 1834 the Imlay brothers, Alexander, George and Peter, set up a whaling station at Snug Cove. Nearby they built a small <b>slab</b> and <b>bark</b> hut, the first-known building erected at Eden. Sketches of the hut were made by Sir Oswald Brierly in 1842 and by Captain Owen Stanley from HMS Rattlesnake in 1843. In around 1860 Davidson commenced a partnership with the Solomon family of Eden-Monaro. Initially the prevalent orcas were seen by the partnership as a nuisance. But the boat crews employed, Yuin aboriginals, refused to kill orcas, and a new policy encouraged collaboration between whalers and the killer whales; the killer whales would trap humpback whales that entered Twofold Bay, the whales would then be harpooned, and the orcas rewarded with prize pieces of the humpback carcasses.|$|R
60|$|The {{settlement}} {{was not an}} especially cheerful spot, consisting as it did {{of three or four}} log-houses roofed with cedar shingles which their owners had split, a store, and a frame hotel covered in with galvanized iron, though <b>slabs</b> of <b>bark</b> had been largely used as well. They, however, rested there several days, and they needed it, while the hearts of most of them sank a trifle at the contemplation of the journey home. They had set out light, but the store was crammed with provisions, which the freighter, who had somehow brought them there, had abandoned all hope of taking farther. It was evident they must each go back with a load which a man unaccustomed to the packing necessary in that country could scarcely carry a mile, and the hardiest prospector among them shrank from crossing the divide with such a burden. The thing, however, had to be done, and on the night before their departure they were arranging their packs in the store when the man who kept it pointed to a pile of bags and cases in a corner.|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} carried out in some {{selected}} sawmills in Kajola Local Government Area of Oyo State to assess the volume of wood waste generated in their various forms during log conversion into sawn timber. Ten (10) sawmills were randomly selected in the area for the study and in each sawmill, ten (10) logs were sampled for conversion making a total of one hundred (100) logs. Some of the logs sampled included Melicia exceisa, Terminalia superba, Ceiba petandenra, Annogeisus leiocarpus and Danieila oliverii. Through and through sawing method was used for the logs conversion. Before conversion, input volume were determined while volume of lumber recovered, percentage of lumber recovery, volume of sawdust, <b>slabs</b> and <b>bark</b> were also determined. The result showed that Temidire sawmill had 80. 23 % which revealed the highest percentage of lumber recovery while Babameta sawmill had 70. 09 %, it gave the least percentage of lumber recovery. Correlation analysis revealed that there was high positive significant relationship between top girth, basal girth and input volume of logs while others have no significant relationship among the factors considered...|$|R
5000|$|The first {{settlement}} of Myall Creek (Dalby) occurred when Henry Stuart Russell built a <b>slab</b> and <b>bark</b> hut in 1846 {{for the use}} of Samual Stewart and his family. Stewart had been Russell's hut keeper at Cecil Plains for five years prior to moving to Myall Creek. A number of similar buildings were constructed in the same area over the following years. After several approaches to the New South Wales Government by residents (the separation of Queensland had not occurred), surveyor EO Moriaty was instructed to lie out a township of one square mile at Myall Creek. Due to a mistake in the flood levels however, the New South Wales Government did not accept this 1852 survey plan. In 1853, Captain Samuel Augustus Perry, Assistant Surveyor General was sent to resurvey the site for urban settlement. The nucleus of the township was laid out on the grid plan regulations adopted by Ralph Darling, Governor of New South Wales. It was Captain Perry who renamed the town [...] "Dalby".|$|R
50|$|Selector FW Cook {{constructed}} Cotswold Cottage {{in stages}} between 1888 {{and the late}} 1890s. The ruins of this place are important in demonstrating the transplantation and adaptation of traditional English stone construction techniques using local materials. Cook was a builder from the Cotswold district in England and at his Maroon property he used locally obtained iron <b>bark</b> <b>slabs,</b> stone and a mortar mix of clay and cow manure for {{the walls of the}} house. He used a range of flooring techniques and finishes, including stone paving, bitumen and floorboards hand-painted to resemble linoleum. The place contributes to our understanding of early house construction techniques employed by small-scale immigrant selectors in rural Queensland, especially the use of local and recycled materials, and to our understanding of past lifestyles.|$|R
5000|$|The {{composition}} of the outer walls of the house reveals {{the degree to which}} the designer strived to incorporate passive cooling mechanisms and his ability to creatively utilise available materials. The walls were four metres in height. Colin employed a continuous wall plate or tie beam at the heads of all windows and doors to create top and bottom wall plates. In the upper section were placed a series of ventilation openings. The availability of lengths of trees suitable for splitting slabs influenced this decision. Sections of the outer iron <b>bark</b> <b>slab</b> walls were arranged to ensure that joining studs in the wall would meet tie beams in the ceiling. This junction is noticeable along the top plate. Also, the verandah windows featured shelf-like sills that positioned earthenware flasks of cool water [...] "known as water monkeys" [...] to catch the slightest breeze.|$|R
50|$|Maidu housing, {{especially}} {{higher in}} the hills and the mountains, was largely semi-underground. These houses were sizable, circular structures twelve to 18 feet in diameter, whose floors were as much as three feet below ground level. Once {{the floor of the}} house was dug, a pole framework was built, then a covering of pine <b>bark</b> <b>slabs</b> upon which a heavy layer of earth was placed along the base of the structure. With a central fire in the house at ground level, a stone-lined pit and bedrock mortar to process foods, meals were always ready to feed the family. For summer dwelling, a different structure was built from cut branches tied together and fastened to sapling posts, then covered with brush and dirt. The summer shelters were built with the principal opening facing east to catch the rising sun, and to escape the heat of the afternoon.|$|R
5000|$|... :This {{gives some}} insight into the scope of Parliament's {{legislative}} jurisdiction over railways {{and the manner in which}} it is charged with the responsibility of weighing both the national and local socio-economic ramifications of its decisions. Moreover, it cannot be seriously questioned that Parliament may deal with biophysical environmental concerns touching upon the operation of railways so long as it is legislation relating to railways. This could involve issues such as emission standards or noise abatement provisions.:To continue with the example, one might postulate the location and construction of a new line which would require approval under the relevant provisions of the Railway Act. [...] That line may cut through ecologically sensitive habitats such as wetlands and forests. The possibility of derailment may pose a serious hazard to the health and safety of nearby communities if dangerous commodities are to be carried on the line. On the other hand, it may bring considerable economic benefit to those communities through job creation and the multiplier effect that will have in the local economy. The regulatory authority might require that the line circumvent residential districts in the interests of noise abatement and safety. In my view, all of these considerations may validly be taken into account in arriving at a final decision on whether or not to grant the necessary approval. To suggest otherwise would lead to the most astonishing results, and it defies reason to assert that Parliament is constitutionally barred from weighing the broad environmental repercussions, including socio-economic concerns, when legislating with respect to decisions of this nature.:The same can be said for several other subject matters of legislation, including one of those before the Court, namely navigation and shipping. Some provisions of the Navigable Waters Protection Act are aimed directly at biophysical environmental concerns that affect navigation. Sections 21 and 22 read:::21. No person shall throw or deposit or cause, suffer or permit to be thrown or deposited any sawdust, edgings, <b>slabs,</b> <b>bark</b> or like rubbish of any description whatever that is liable to interfere with navigation in any water, any part of which is navigable or that flows into any navigable water.::22. No person shall throw or deposit or cause, suffer or permit to be thrown or deposited any stone, gravel, earth, cinders, ashes or other material or rubbish that is liable to sink to the bottom in any water, any part of which is navigable or that flows into any navigable water, where there are not at least twenty fathoms of water at all times, but nothing in this section shall be construed so as to permit the throwing or depositing of any substance in any part of a navigable water where that throwing or depositing is prohibited by or under any other Act.:As I mentioned earlier in these reasons, the Act has a more expansive environmental dimension, given the common law context in which it was enacted. The common law proscribed obstructions that interfered with the paramount right of public navigation. Several of the [...] "works" [...] referred to in the Act do not in any way improve navigation. Bridges do not assist navigation, nor do many dams. Thus, in deciding whether a work of that nature is to be permitted, the Minister would almost surely have to weigh the advantages and disadvantages resulting from the interference with navigation. This could involve environmental concerns such as the destruction to fisheries, and all the Guidelines Order does then is to extend the ambit of his concerns.|$|R
