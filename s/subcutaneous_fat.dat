40|$|Background: The {{mechanisms}} that link the metabolic syndrome to increased cardiovascular risk are incompletely understood, especially in young people. We therefore examined whether the metabolic syndrome {{was associated with}} arterial stiffness and whether any such associations were independent of cardiopulmonary fitness and <b>subcutaneous</b> trunk <b>fat.</b> Methods: Cross-sectional analyses of data on 364 men and women aged 36 years from the Amsterdam Growth and Health Longitudinal Study (ninth follow-up measurement, year 2000). The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome was defined by a slightly modified National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) definition. Arterial stiffness was ultrasonically estimated by distensibility and compliance of the carotid, femoral, and brachial arteries and by the carotid elastic modulus. Results: The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in this young adult population was 18. 3 % in men and 3. 2 % in women. Individuals with the syndrome compared with individuals without risk factors had 11. 2 % and 17. 0 % less distensibility and 9. 0 % and 18. 2 % less compliance of the carotid and femoral arteries, respectively, and 15. 9 % higher carotid elastic modulus. After adjustment for cardiopulmonary fitness and <b>subcutaneous</b> trunk <b>fat,</b> the metabolic syndrome remained significantly associated with stiffness of the carotid but not the femoral artery. In addition, poor cardiopulmonary fitness and high <b>subcutaneous</b> trunk <b>fat</b> were associated with arterial stiffness, and this was independent of the metabolic syndrome.

Beef producers targeting the higher marbling specifications of some markets, but who have concerns over the poorer feed conversion efficiency and yield associated with higher marbling British breed cattle, use Limousin sires over British breed cows, or British breed sires over Limousin cows, in crossbreeding programmes that aim to achieve a balance between the different and conflicting production demands.|$|E
5|$|Two thick {{folds of}} skin {{encircle}} the body {{behind the front}} legs and before the hind legs. The rhino has a smaller fold of skin around its neck. The skin itself is thin, , and in the wild, the rhino appears to have no <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>fat.</b> Hair can range from dense (the most dense hair in young calves) to scarce, and is usually a reddish brown. In the wild, this hair is hard to observe because the rhinos are often covered in mud. In captivity, however, the hair grows out and becomes much shaggier, likely because of less abrasion from walking through vegetation. The rhino has a patch of long hair around its ears and a thick clump of hair {{at the end of}} its tail. Like all rhinos, they have very poor vision. The Sumatran rhinoceros is fast and agile; it climbs mountains easily and comfortably traverses steep slopes and riverbanks.|$|E
5|$|Almost all {{pinnipeds}} have fur coats, {{the exception}} being the walrus, {{which is only}} sparsely covered. Even some fully furred species (particularly sea lions) are less haired than most land mammals. In species that live on ice, young pups have thicker coats than adults. The individual hairs on the coat, known collectively as lanugo, can trap heat from sunlight and keep the pup warm. Pinnipeds are typically countershaded, and are darker colored dorsally and lighter colored ventrally, which serves to eliminate shadows caused by light shining over the ocean water. The pure white fur of harp seal pups conceals them in their Arctic environment. Some species, such as ribbon seals, ringed seals and leopard seals, have patterns of contrasting light and dark coloration. All fully furred species molt; phocids molt once a year, while otariids gradually molt all year. Seals have a layer of <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>fat</b> known as blubber that is particularly thick in phocids and walruses. Blubber serves both to keep the animals warm and to provide energy and nourishment when they are fasting. It can constitute as much as 50% of a pinniped's body weight. Pups are born with only {{a thin layer of}} blubber, but some species compensate for this with thick lanugos.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Asymmetric N G, N G -dimethylarginine (ADMA), an {{endogenous}} inhibitor of {{nitric oxide}} synthase, is {{regulated by the}} enzymatic participants of synthetic and metabolic processes, i. e., type I protein N -arginine methyltransferase (PRMT) and dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH). Previous reports have demonstrated that circulating ADMA levels can vary in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM). White adipose tissue expresses the full enzymatic machinery necessary for ADMA production and metabolism; however, modulation of the activities of adipose ADMA-related enzymes in T 2 DM remains to be determined. Methods A rodent model of T 2 DM using 11 - and 20 -week old Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats was used. The expression and catalytic activity of PRMT 1 and DDAH 1 and 2 in the white adipose tissues (periepididymal, visceral and <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>fats)</b> and femur skeletal muscle tissue were determined by immunoblotting, in vitro methyltransferase and in vitro citrulline assays. Results Non-obese diabetic GK rats showed low expression and activity of adipose PRMT 1 compared to age-matched Wistar controls. Adipose tissues from the periepididymal, visceral and <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>fats</b> of GK rats had high DDAH 1 expression and total DDAH activity, whereas the DDAH 2 expression was lowered below the control value. This dynamic of ADMA-related enzymes in white adipose tissues was distinct from that of skeletal muscle tissue. GK rats had lower levels of serum non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and triglycerides (TG) than the control rats. In all subjects the adipose PRMT 1 and DDAH activities were statistically correlated with the levels of serum NEFA and TG. Conclusion Activities of PRMT 1 and DDAH in white adipose tissues were altered in diabetic GK rats in an organ-specific manner, which {{was reflected in the}} serum levels of NEFA and TG. Changes in adipose ADMA-related enzymes might play a part in the function of white adipose tissue. </p...|$|R

5|$|An early trader, Emilian Basov, traded at Bering Island in 1743, {{collecting}} a {{large number}} of sea otter, fur seal, and blue Arctic fox furs. Basov made four trips to Bering Island and nearby Medny Island and made a fortune, inspiring many other traders. From 1743 to the founding of the Russian-American Company in 1799, over 100 private fur-trading and hunting voyages sailed from Kamchatka to North America. In total, these voyages garnered over eight million silver rubles. During {{the early part of this}} era, the ships would typically stop at the Commander Islands to slaughter and preserve the meat of Steller's sea cows, a defenseless sea mammal whose range was limited to those islands. They were hunted not only for food, but also for their skins, used to make boats, and their <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>fat,</b> used for oil lamps. By 1768, Steller's sea cow was extinct. As furs were depleted on nearby islands, Russian traders sailed farther east along the Aleutian chain. By the 1760s, they were regularly sailing to Kodiak Island. Notable Russian traders in the early years of the trade include Nikifor Trapeznikov (who financed and participated in 10 voyages between 1743 and 1768), Maksimovich Solov'ev, Stepan Glotov, and Grigory Shelikhov.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Several studies {{reported}} inverse associations between birth weight and central adiposity in adults. However, few studied investigated {{the contributions of}} different abdominal fat compartments. OBJECTIVE: We examined associations between birth weight and adult visceral and <b>subcutaneous</b> abdominal <b>fat</b> in the population-based Fenland study. DESIGN: A total of 1092 adults (437 men and 655 women) aged 30 - 55 y had available data on reported birth weight, standard anthropometric measures, and visceral and <b>subcutaneous</b> abdominal <b>fat</b> estimated by ultrasound. In a subgroup (n = 766), dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) assessment of total abdominal fat was performed. Linear regression models were used to analyze relations between birth weight and the various fat variables adjusted for sex, age, education, smoking, and body mass index (BMI). RESULTS: After adjustment for adult BMI, there was an inverse association between birth weight and total abdominal fat [B (partial regression coefficient expressed as SD/ 1 -kg change in birth weight) = - 0. 09, P = 0. 002] and visceral fat (B = - 0. 07, P = 0. 01) but not between birth weight and <b>subcutaneous</b> abdominal <b>fat</b> (B = - 0. 01, P = 0. 3). Tests for interaction showed that adult BMI modified the association between birth weight and visceral fat (P for interaction = 0. 01). In stratified analysis, the association between birth weight and visceral fat was apparent only in individuals with the highest BMI tertile (B = - 0. 08, P = 0. 04). CONCLUSIONS: The inverse association between birth weight and adult abdominal fat appeared to be specific to visceral fat. However, associations with birth weight were apparent only after adjustment for adult BMI. Therefore, we suggest that rapid postnatal weight gain, rather than birth weight alone, leads to increased visceral fat...|$|R

Objectives: We evaluated the association of adipocyte size of subcutaneous and omental adipose tissue with body composition and cardiovascular risk factors in Asian Indians. Methodology: Eighty (40 males and 40 females) non-diabetic adult subjects undergoing elective abdominal surgery were included. Pre-surgery evaluation included anthropometric measurements, % body fat by bioimpedance, abdominal fat area at L 2 – 3 level (computed tomography) and biochemical investigations (fasting blood glucose and insulin, lipids and hsCRP). During surgery, about 5 grams each of omental and subcutaneous adipose tissue was obtained for adipocyte size determination.

Aspiration of <b>subcutaneous</b> {{abdominal}} <b>fat</b> is {{a simple}} and fast method for detecting systemic amyloidosis; however, the sensitivity of this approach remains undetermined. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the accuracy of fat tissue aspiration for detecting systemic amyloidosis and the utility of this method in clinical practice. Methods. All consecutive patients with established and suspected systemic amyloidosis who attended our tertiary referral hospital between 1994 and 2004 underwent aspiration of <b>subcutaneous</b> abdominal <b>fat.</b> Congo red-stained tissue was assessed quickly in a single smear in a routine manner by a single observer, and was also assessed thoroughly in 3 smears by 2 independent observers. Results. One hundred twenty patients with established systemic amyloidosis were studied (38 with AA amyloidosis, 70 with AL amyloidosis, and 12 with ATTR amyloidosis). Routine (quick) assessment was associated with a sensitivity of 80 % (95 % confidence interval [95 % CI] 72 - 87 %). Sensitivity increased to 93 % (95 % CI 87 - 97 %) when 3 smears were thoroughly examined. The specificity of fat aspiration in 45 control subjects was 100 % (95 % CI 92 - 100 %). One hundred sixty-two patients for whom there was a clinical suspicion of systemic amyloidosis were screened for amyloidosis by fat tissue aspiration and biopsy of at least I other tissue. In 69 (43 %) of these 162 patients, a diagnosis of amyloidosis was established, and in 66 (96 %) of these patients, the results of fat tissue aspiration were positive. The clinical utility of fat tissue aspiration was greater than that of biopsy of the rectum. Conclusion. <b>Subcutaneous</b> abdominal <b>fat</b> aspiration is the preferred method for detecting systemic amyloidosis, with sensitivity of 80 % associated with use of a routine approach.
