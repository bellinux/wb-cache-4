500|$|From {{the surface}} of Amalthea, Jupiter would look enormous: 46 degrees across, it would appear roughly 92 {{times larger than the}} full moon. Because Amalthea is in {{synchronous}} rotation, Jupiter would not appear to move, and would not be visible from one side of Amalthea. The Sun would disappear behind Jupiter's bulk {{for an hour and a}} half each revolution, and Amalthea's short rotation period gives it just under six hours of [...] Though Jupiter would appear 900 times brighter than the full moon, its light would be spread over an area some 8500 times greater and it would not look as bright per <b>surface</b> <b>unit.</b>|$|E

500|$|Commonly {{referred}} to as [...] "pocket battleships" [...] due to their heavy armament, all three ships saw service in the non-intervention patrols during the Spanish Civil War in 1936–1938. They served as commerce raiders early in World War II; Admiral Graf Spee was scuttled outside Montevideo in December 1939 following the Battle of the River Plate. Deutschland conducted one cruise into the North Atlantic without significant success, before returning to Germany to be renamed Lützow. She and Admiral Scheer were also re-rated as heavy cruisers. She then participated in Operation Weserübung, where she was badly damaged by Norwegian coastal batteries and a British torpedo. After repairs, she was deployed to occupied Norway to operate against convoys to the Soviet Union. There she was joined by Admiral Scheer, which had completed the most successful raiding cruise conducted by a major <b>surface</b> <b>unit.</b> Both ships ultimately returned to German waters {{by the end of}} 1943, where they were sunk by British bombers in the final weeks of the war. Lützow was re-floated by the Soviet Navy and expended as a target in July 1947.|$|E

[...] The needed solvation parameters for different types of atoms (carbon (C), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), sulfur (S), etc.) are usually determined by a least squares fit of the calculated and experimental transfer free energies for a series of organic compounds.

Sailing on 26 February 1942 with the cruisers Houston, , , , HNLMS Java and ten destroyers, he met the Japanese support force under Admiral Takeo Takagi consisting of four cruisers and 13 destroyers {{in the late afternoon}} of 27 February 1942. As Japanese destroyers laid a smokescreen, the cruisers of both fleets opened fire. After one ineffective torpedo attack, the Japanese light cruisers and destroyers launched a second and sank the destroyer [...] HMS Exeter and the destroyer [...] were hit by gunfire, Electra sinking shortly after. At 17:30, Admiral Doorman turned south toward the Java coast, not wishing to be diverted from his main purpose of destroying the convoy.|$|E

In this notation, the <b>surface</b> <b>unit</b> cell is given as multiples of the nonreconstructed <b>surface</b> <b>unit</b> cell with the unit cell vectors a and b. For example, a calcite(104) (2×1) reconstruction means that the unit cell is twice as long in direction a and has the same length in direction b. If the unit cell is rotated with respect to the unit cell of the nonreconstructed surface, the angle phi is given in addition (usually in degree). This notation is often used to describe reconstructions concisely, but does not directly indicate changes in the layer symmetry (for example, square to hexagonal).|$|E

40|$|Even {{though the}} Early Noachian (EN) used in {{geologic}} mapping is undefined {{at the early}} end, it is often assumed in absolute chronologies to extend back to 4. 6 BYA. We explored this assumption by searching for evidence of buried impact basins, in the largest occurrences of Early Noachian terrain. The hypothesis is that if such basins exist, they indicate crust which must predate the <b>surface</b> <b>units</b> mapped as the oldest on Mars, and those units must then be less than 4. 6 BY old. Alternatively, if no such buried features are seen, then the <b>surface</b> <b>units</b> may represent crust {{of the same age}} below, which could in principle be as old as Mars. Here we show the former alternative is true. There must be crust older than the oldest mapped <b>surface</b> <b>units.</b> We also show that a number of Noachian terrains on Mars appear to have a common total (visible + buried) crater retention age. This might be either the age of the original (planet-wide?) crust of Mars, or may indicate crater saturation...|$|R
