5000|$|<b>Stripper</b> <b>plate</b> {{ejection}}—This ejection {{is preferred}} for components with larger areas. This system {{calls for an}} additional plate (stripper) between the core and cavity plates. To avoid flash, the <b>stripper</b> <b>plate</b> remains {{in contact with the}} cavity plate and a gap is maintained between the cavity and core plate. Visible ejection marks are usually not noted on components.|$|E

5000|$|An example {{would be}} a die that {{performs}} blanking of [...]030 in round paper gaskets without holes. This type of die would be created in one simple pass from a wire EDM after heat treating. The workpiece would then produce the punch and the die after the cut is complete. Additional work would then include adding a <b>stripper</b> <b>plate</b> to the punch plate after the punch has been mounted (on punch plate). At this point the pancake die is ready for production.|$|E
5000|$|Graeber's parents, {{who were}} in their forties when Graeber was born, were self-taught working-class intellectuals in New York. Graeber's mother, Ruth Rubinstein, had been a garment worker, and played the lead role in the 1930s musical comedy revue Pins & Needles, staged by the International Ladies’ Garment Workers’ Union. Graeber's father Kenneth, who was {{affiliated}} with the Youth Communist League in college, though he quit well before the Hitler-Stalin pact, participated in the Spanish Revolution in Barcelona and fought in the Spanish Civil War. He later worked as a <b>plate</b> <b>stripper</b> on offset printers. Graeber grew up in New York, in a cooperative apartment building described by Business Week magazine as [...] "suffused with radical politics." [...] Graeber has been an anarchist {{since the age of}} 16, according to an interview he gave to The Village Voice in 2005.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The present paper {{describes}} a knowledge-based system (KBS) developed for selection of progressivedie components to automate {{the design process}} of progressive dies in stamping industries. Design/methodology/approach: The production rule based KBS approach of Artificial Intelligence (AI) hasbeen utilized for constructing the proposed system. The system has been structured into seven KBS modules. Modules are user interactive and designed to be loaded in to the prompt area of AutoCAD. Findings: The output of system modules includes the type and proper dimensions of progressive die componentsnamely die block, die gages (front spacer and back gage), <b>stripper,</b> punches, punch <b>plate,</b> back plate, die-set andfasteners. The system has been designed {{in such a way}} that the expert advices imparted by its modules areautomatically stored in different output data files. These data files can be further utilized for automatic modelingof die components and die assembly. Research limitations/implications: Although the system is limited to the design of progressive dies only, yet itcan be extended further for the design of other types of dies also. Practical implications: The proposed system is ready for use in sheet metal industries for quick selection ofprogressive die components. The system can be implemented on a PC having AutoCAD software and thereforeits low cost of implementation makes it affordable by small and medium sized stamping industries. Originality/value: The proposed system is capable of accomplishing the time-consuming task of selection ofprogressive die components in a very short time period...|$|R
50|$|In {{the most}} common method of high-volume, {{continuous}} thermoforming of thin-gauge products, plastic sheet is fed from a roll or from an extruder into a set of indexing chains that incorporate pins, or spikes, that pierce the sheet and transport it through an oven for heating to forming temperature. The heated sheet then indexes into a form station where a mating mold and pressure-box close on the sheet, with vacuum then applied to remove trapped air and to pull the material into or onto the mold along with pressurized air to form the plastic to the detailed shape of the mold. (Plug-assists are typically used in addition to vacuum {{in the case of}} taller, deeper-draw formed parts in order to provide the needed material distribution and thicknesses in the finished parts.) After a short form cycle, a burst of reverse air pressure is actuated from the vacuum side of the mold as the form tooling opens, commonly referred to as air-eject, to break the vacuum and assist the formed parts off of, or out of, the mold. A <b>stripper</b> <b>plate</b> may also be utilized on the mold as it opens for ejection of more detailed parts or those with negative-draft, undercut areas. The sheet containing the formed parts then indexes into a trim station on the same machine, where a die cuts the parts from the remaining sheet web, or indexes into a separate trim press where the formed parts are trimmed. The sheet web remaining after the formed parts are trimmed is typically wound onto a take-up reel or fed into an inline granulator for recycling.|$|E
40|$|Plastic {{products}} can be manufactured by various processes. Injection moulding {{is one of}} the techniques used to produce plastic products by forcing the molten plastic material under pressure into a mould, where it is solidified and subsequently released by opening the two halves of the mould. Tool design and development is a specialized and critical area. This paper presents the conceptual design of plastic injection mould tool for inlet chamber of an air inflator, which is used for air filling for the dunnage bags. The material used for the production of the component is ABS (Acrylonitrile-Butadience-Styrene). The technique is incorporated to produce a good quality component considering the ease of manufacturability, assembly and positive ejection of the component with minimum possible time and cost. Designing of mould is carried out by using computer aided designing software Unigraphics. The tool is of two plate, single cavity, <b>stripper</b> <b>plate</b> ejection, cold runner (sprue feed system). Cooling system may not be essential as the component mass is less...|$|E
40|$|The project ”Design {{solution}} {{in the end}} stripper system for the Grate, to define {{the impact of the}} thermal properties” is about the design {{solution in}} the end stripping system that has been suggested to keep the clearance between the Grate conveyor and the tip of the end stripper more constant. In order to investigate the reason behind the varying clearance, the idea was to make measurements on different parameters in the system. Due to some difficulties in getting the measurement equipment in to the system without affecting the production, the measurements could not be done during the project time. For this project, much time where spent on collecting information and drawings, as well as interviewing employees at LKAB that has experience of working with the end stripping system, or in other way is familiar with the problem the system has caused. The collected information and drawings have formed the basis for a CAD model of the end stripping system, as well as a set of requirements that the new solution must meet. The design solution suggested in this work to define the impact of the thermal properties on the steering rod and thus the clearance, is an extension of the cooling duct and the heat insulation as well as a relocation of the attachment between the end <b>stripper</b> <b>plate</b> and the steering rod. The extension of the cooling duct resulted in an additional 500 millimetres of the steering rod, being cooled. After some minor changes in {{the upper part of the}} steering rod, could the heat insulation be extended by 553 millimetres. The efforts to move the attachment between the end stripping plate and the steering rod resulted in a decreased factor for the change in clearance, from 4, 2 to 2, 2. The extension of the cooling duct and the heat insulation was validated by inserting the new steering rod in the model for the system. To validate the durability of the components after the modifications, a FEM (Finite Element Method) -analyses was performed with Nastran as solver.
