5|$|The {{effect of}} Rupert's actions, {{even after his}} forces disengaged, was to force another delay in the Parliamentarian retreat; Essex spent much of 19 September looking after wounded {{soldiers}} and, when he finally managed to begin moving again, he was confronted with swampland and bog which further delayed him while the Royalists marched across the relatively open chalk downs above the Kennet. These hardships meant that the Royalists arrived at Newbury before Essex, with both armies <b>settling</b> <b>down</b> for the night outside the town, too exhausted to immediately fight.|$|E

5|$|After <b>settling</b> <b>down</b> at the landlady's house, Vanaja gets {{invited to}} play a game of ashta chamma (a leisurely game in rural towns of Andhra Pradesh) against the landlady. Knowing that losing isn’t the mistress’s forte, she {{deliberately}} gives up her game. This gesture, in turn, eventually secures her the landlady’s mentorship, first in music and then in dance. Vanaja excels at these art forms and seems to be on a steadily ascending path until the arrival of Shekhar (Karan Singh), the landlady's 23-year-old son, from the United States. Shekhar is a handsome, muscular young man who is running for an office in the local government. Sexual chemistry is ignited between Shekhar and Vanaja (still a minor at 15) when flirtation and sexual innuendo bloom.|$|E
5|$|In 1965 Árbenz {{participated in}} the Communist Congress in Helsinki. Soon afterwards, his {{daughter}} Arabella committed suicide in Bogota, an incident that badly affected Árbenz. Following her funeral, the Árbenz family remained indefinitely in Mexico City, while Árbenz himself {{spent some time in}} France and Switzerland, with the ultimate objective of <b>settling</b> <b>down</b> in Mexico. On one of his visits to Mexico, Árbenz contracted a serious illness, {{and by the end of}} 1970 he was very ill. He died soon after. Historians disagree as to the manner of his death: Roberto Garcia Ferreira stated that he died of a heart attack while taking a bath, while historian Cindy Forster wrote that he committed suicide. In October 1995, Árbenz's remains were eventually repatriated to Guatemala, accompanied by his widow María. The Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala awarded him with a posthumous decoration soon after.|$|E

5|$|After lunch, Morris was bowled for 62. Bradman joined Barnes and the Australian skipper {{played and}} missed {{a few times}} before <b>settling</b> <b>down.</b> Barnes responded to his captain's {{difficulties}} by manipulating the strike and shielding Bradman from Bedser. The Australian opener had little trouble against the leg trap Bedser set for him, scoring freely into the leg side and taking the shine off the second new ball. Generally however, Barnes also scored sedately after lunch, and after one extended period of defence, he drove Laker for four through the covers, eliciting a round of ironic applause. Barnes responded to the public gallery by placing {{his hand on his}} chest and bowing to the spectators. Barnes had started slowly, but accelerated after reaching his half-century. He reached 96 with Australia at 1/222 half an hour after tea. By this time, the pace of the pitch appeared to have slowed, making batting relatively easy.|$|E
5|$|Hindman, Sr. was an ensign in the 39th United States Infantry {{during the}} War of 1812. He was {{promoted}} to third lieutenant on January 11, 1814, and to second lieutenant on May 20 of the same year. He fought in the Battle of New Orleans, the final major battle of the war, and served on active duty until he resigned on June 30, 1816 due to health concerns. After leaving the army, Hindman, Sr. operated a military ferry on the Tennessee River {{and served as a}} lieutenant colonel in the 10th Territorial Militia Regiment for the Alabama Territory. In his dealings as a merchant, he met Lewis Ross. Hindman, Sr. was a frequent visitor at the Ross household, and it was there that he met Lewis' sister-in-law, Sallie Holt. After a brief courtship, the couple was married in Knoxville on January 21, 1819. After <b>settling</b> <b>down</b> in Rhea County, Tennessee, their first daughter was born in 1820. Three more children, Robert, Mary, and Sarah, were born after the family moved to Post Oak Springs. The family moved back to Knoxville in 1827.

5|$|In 875, the unwarlike and pleasure-loving Aghlabid emir Muhammad II ibn Ahmad (r. 864–875) died, and was {{succeeded by}} his more {{energetic}} brother, Ibrahim II (r. 875–902). The new Emir of Ifriqiya {{was determined to}} finally capture Syracuse. He appointed a new governor for the island, Ja'far ibn Muhammad, and sent a fleet from Ifriqiya to his assistance. Ja'far began his campaign in 877, raiding the Byzantine territories and occupying some outlying forts around Syracuse, before <b>settling</b> <b>down</b> to besiege the city. The Muslims, well supplied with siege weapons, launched incessant attacks on the city's defenders, but Syracuse received scant reinforcements from Constantinople, where {{the bulk of the}} imperial fleet was apparently occupied with carrying building materials for a sumptuous new church built by Emperor Basil. During nine months of siege, the Arabs gradually occupied the outer defences, and finally, on 21 May 878, stormed the city. The population was massacred or enslaved, and the city thoroughly looted over two months.|$|E
