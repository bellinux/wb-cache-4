[...] This was because, Grant writes, [...] "she had to spend an entire day reading 21 pages of dialogue, rattling off in quick succession 911-operator jargon, that would be cut and edited to fit the film... In film terms, that means Berry performed for 21 minutes straight with no breaks, not an easy feat for any actor." [...] Though she enjoyed working with Chestnut, Berry told Grant that it was difficult being unable to see her co-stars for most of the film: [...] "That was my constant challenge; to stay on such an emotional level , <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be on the same level as they [...] were. I used that feeling of frustration and of being stuck to fuel my character." ...|$|E
500|$|Class {{inequality}} in Swedish society {{was a strong}} and recurring theme in the Commission's findings. It appeared as a major motivator in the 289 personal narratives included in the report. These documents, of great research value and human interest today, were submitted by Swedes in Canada and the U.S. in response to requests in Swedish-American newspapers. The great majority of replies expressed enthusiasm for their new homeland and criticized conditions in Sweden. Bitter experiences of Swedish class snobbery still rankled after sometimes 40–50 years in America. Writers recalled the hard work, pitiful wages, and grim poverty {{of life in the}} Swedish countryside. One woman wrote from North Dakota of how in her Värmland home parish, she had had to earn her living in peasant households from the age of eight, starting work {{at four in the morning}} and living on [...] "rotten herring and potatoes, served out in small amounts <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not eat myself sick". She could see [...] "no hope of saving anything in case of illness", but rather could see [...] "the poorhouse waiting for me in the distance". When she was seventeen, her emigrated brothers sent her a prepaid ticket to America, and [...] "the hour of freedom struck" ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2010, Mo'Nique, {{the winner}} of the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, wearing a blue dress and gardenias in her hair, as McDaniel had at the {{ceremony}} in 1940, in her acceptance speech thanked McDaniel [...] "for enduring all that she had to <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not have to". Her speech revived interest in the whereabouts of McDaniel's plaque. In 2011, J. Freedom duLac reported in the Washington Post that the plaque had disappeared in the 1960s.|$|E
2500|$|In 1968, {{after the}} premiere of the {{international}} film Candy (1968), Cavett went to {{a party at the}} Americana Hotel, where those who had just seen the film were being interviewed for TV.. He later said [...] "When the interviewer, Pat Paulsen, got to me, he asked what I thought the critics would say about Candy. I said I didn't think it would be reviewed by the regular critics, {{that they would have to}} reconvene the Nuremberg Trials to do it justice. He laughed and asked what I had liked, and I said I liked the lady who showed me the nearest exit <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not be forced to vomit indoors." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the alleged}} {{members of the group}} of bombers, Ramiro Helmeyer, told police that Halvorssen was the leader. Helmeyer {{initially}} recanted his confession, claiming that the police [...] "tortured me <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> accuse Thor Halvorssen". Helmeyer was ultimately convicted of murder and sentenced to 30 years in prison. Helmeyer lost every appeal and took his case to the Supreme Court. In 1994, Halvorssen wrote a Wall Street Journal editorial stating that he had investigated Banco Latino for money laundering and for being a Ponzi scheme. Halvorssen was arrested in Caracas one day after a Banco Latino official asked him to come to Venezuela from New York for a meeting with the bank's chairman. Halvorssen was warned by a U.S. Treasury Department agent that the meeting with Banco Latino was a trap. Halvorssen went anyway and was arrested. Banco Latino {{went on to become the}} largest bank fraud in Venezuelan history. While serving his prison sentence for murder, in February 1998, Helmeyer changed his story to say the bombing campaign was financed by the Banco Latino by way of its president Gustavo Gómez López and now said that Halvorssen (who was supposedly investigating Banco Latino) was the key organizer. Helmeyer was a relative of the family that founded the Banco Latino.|$|E

6000|$|Then King Angus rose, {{and went}} forth from that place, {{and he went}} to the chamber of Sir Tristram.

Once apart from him, I was determined to keep apart; and we walked back, side by side, saying very little more by the way. Whether his spirits were elevated by the communication I had made to him, or by his having indulged in this retrospect, I don't know; but they were raised by some influence. He talked more at dinner than was usual with him; asked his mother (off duty, from the moment of our re-entering the house) whether he was not growing too old for a bachelor; and once looked at Agnes <b>so,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have given all I had, for leave to knock him down.|$|E
