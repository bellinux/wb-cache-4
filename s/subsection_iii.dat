We investigate the uptake and storage of inorganic carbon by cone-forming cyanobacteria from Yellowstone National Park using high-resolution stable isotope mapping of labeled carbon (H 13 CO 3 −) and immunoassays. Observations and incubation experiments in actively photosynthesizing enrichment cultures and field samples reveal {{the presence of}} abundant cyanophycin granules in the active growth layer of cones. These ultrastructurally heterogeneous granules rapidly accumulate newly fixed carbon and store 18 % of the total particulate labeled carbon after 120 mins of incubation. The intracellular distribution of labeled carbon during the incubation experiment demonstrates an unexpectedly large contribution of PEP carboxylase to carbon fixation, and a large flow of carbon and nitrogen toward cyanophycin in thin filamentous, non-heterocystous cyanobacteria. This pattern does not occur in obvious response to a changing N or C status. Instead, it may suggest an unusual interplay between the regulation of carbon concentration mechanisms and accumulation of photorespiratory products that facilitates uptake of inorganic C and reduces photorespiration in the dense, surface-attached communities of cyanobacteria from <b>Subsection</b> <b>III.</b> Academia Sinica (Beijing, China) (postdoctoral scholar award) National Science Council (China) (NSC 102 - 2116 -M- 006 - 018 -MY 2) National Science Council (China) (NSC 101 - 2116 -M- 001 - 007) Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Solomon Buchsbaum Fund...|$|E
40|$|There is an {{apparent}} power deficit {{relative to the}} ΛCDM prediction of the CMB spectrum at large scales, which, though not yet statistically significant, persists from WMAP to Planck data. Proposals that invoke some form of initial condition for the inflation {{have been made to}} address this apparent power suppression, albeit with conflicting conclusions. By studying the curvature perturbations of a scalar field in the FLRW universe parameterized by the equation of state parameter w, we find that the large-scale spectrum at the end of inflation reflects the super-horizon spectrum of the initial state. The large-scale spectrum is suppressed if the universe begins with the adiabatic vacuum in a super-inflation (w 0) era. In the latter case, there is however no causal mechanism to establish the initial adiabatic vacuum. On the other hand, as long as the universe begins with the adiabatic vacuum in an era with - 1 < w < 0, even if there exists an intermediate positive-pressure era, the large-scale spectrum would be enhanced rather than suppressed. We further calculate the spectrum of a two-stage inflation model with a two-field potential and show that the result agrees with that obtained from the ad hoc single-field analysis.

40|$|In Part I. of {{this work}} we have {{presented}} evidence that the measured relative phases of transversity amplitudes in piN->pipiN processes differ from those predicted by the unitary evolution law. We ascribed this difference to a non-unitary interaction of the produced final state rho_f(S) with a universal quantum environment in the Universe. This new kind of interaction must be a pure dephasing interaction. If the quantum environment {{is to be an}} integral part of the Nature then its dephasing interactions must be fully consistent with the Standard Model. In this work we impose on the dephasing interaction the requirements of the conservation of the identities and four-momenta of the final state particles, Lorentz symmetry, P-parity and the conservation of total angular momentum and isospin. From this consistency alone we find that in piN->pipiN the dephasing interaction must be a dipion spin mixing interaction. The theory predicts rho^ 0 (770) -f_ 0 (980) mixing in the S- and P-wave amplitudes in pi(-) p->pi(-) pi(+) n. The predicted moduli and relative phases are in agreement with experimental results. The spin mixing of S-matrix amplitudes to form new observable amplitudes is a new phenomenon beyond the Standard Model. It is our conjecture that the pure dephasing interaction describes the non-standard interaction of baryonic matter with dark matter and dark energy which we identify with the quantum environment.

The proper-time dependence of different contributions to the total energy is established. For systems characterized by a finite momentum cut-off, a freeze-out time can be defined after which the field propagation in rapidity space ends and the system decays into decoupled solitons, antisolitons and local vacuum fluctuations. Numerical simulations of field evolutions on a lattice for the (1 + 1) -dimensional Φ^ 4 model illustrate the general results and show that the freeze-out time and average multiplicities of kinks (plus antikinks) produced in this 'phase transition' {{can be obtained from}} simple averages over the initial ensemble of field configurations. An extension to explicitly include additional dissipation is discussed. The validity of an adiabatic approximation for the case of an overdamped system is investigated.

40|$|We {{investigate}} how the time {{dependence of the}} Hamiltonian determines the occurrence of Dynamical Localization (DL) in driven quantum systems with two incommensurate frequencies. If both frequencies are associated to impulsive terms, DL is permanently destroyed. In this case, we show that the evolution {{is similar to a}} decoherent case. On the other hand, if both frequencies are associated to smooth driving functions, DL persists although on a time scale longer than in the periodic case. When the driving function consists of a series of pulses of duration σ, we show that the localization time increases as σ^- 2 as the impulsive limit, σ→ 0, is approached. In the intermediate case, in which only one of the frequencies is associated to an impulsive term in the Hamiltonian, a transition from a localized to a delocalized dynamics takes place at a certain critical value of the strength parameter. We provide an estimate for this critical value, based on analytical considerations. We show how, in all cases, the frequency spectrum of the dynamical response can be used to understand the global features of the motion. All results are numerically checked.

This conjecture deals with the local behavior of a given curve, that is the number of solutions to an equation like the one above modulo a prime p.

40|$|The {{quantitative}} {{extraction of}} quark-gluon plasma (QGP) properties from heavy-ion data, {{such as its}} specific shear viscosity η /s, typically requires comparison to viscous hydrodynamic or "hybrid" hydrodynamics+transport simulations. In either case, one has to convert the fluid to hadrons, yet without additional theory input the conversion is ambiguous for dissipative fluids. Here, shear viscous phase-space corrections calculated using linearized transport theory are applied in Cooper-Frye freezeout to quantify the effects on anisotropic flow coefficients v_n(p_T) at both RHIC and LHC energies. Expanding upon our previous flow harmonics studies [1, 2], we calculate pion and proton v_ 2 (p_T), v_ 4 (p_T), and v_ 6 (p_T). Unlike in Ref. [1], we incorporate a hadron gas that is chemically frozen below a temperature of 175 MeV, and use hypersurfaces from realistic viscous hydrodynamic simulations. With additive quark model cross sections and relative phase-space corrections with p^ 3 / 2 momentum dependence, rather than the quadratic Grad form, we find at moderately high transverse momentum noticeably higher v_ 4 (p_T) and v_ 6 (p_T) for protons than for pions. In addition, the value of η /s deduced from elliptic flow data differs by nearly 50 % from the value extracted using the naive "democratic Grad" form of freeze-out distributions.

40|$|We {{report the}} results of certain {{integrations}} of quantum-theoretic interest, relying, in this regard, upon recently developed parameterizations of Boya et al of the n x n density matrices, in terms of squared components of the unit (n- 1) -sphere and the n x n unitary matrices. Firstly, we express the normalized volume elements of the Bures (minimal monotone) metric for n = 2 and 3, obtaining thereby "Bures prior probability distributions" over the two- and three-state systems. Then, as an essential first step in extending these results to n > 3, we determine that the "Hall normalization constant" (C_{n}) for the marginal Bures prior probability distribution over the (n- 1) -dimensional simplex of the n eigenvalues of the n x n density matrices is, for n = 4, equal to 71680 /pi^ 2. Since we also find that C_{ 3 } = 35 /pi, it follows that C_{ 4 } is simply equal to 2 ^{ 11 } C_{ 3 }/pi. (C_{ 2 } itself is known to equal 2 /pi.) The constant C_{ 5 } is also found. It too {{is associated with a}} remarkably simple decompositon, involving the product of the eight consecutive prime numbers from 2 to 23. We also preliminarily investigate several cases, n > 5, with the use of quasi-Monte Carlo integration.

También, el impacto de las políticas agrarias de los Países desarrollados sobre el Tercer Mundo 5, o el de la llamada ayuda o cooperación para el desarrollo 6, etc. La inquietud a que me refiero, en fin, ha dado paso a la marcada preocupación que me conduce a acercarme ahora a los crecientes problemas en los que, bajo el rótulo de acaparamiento de tierras o land grabbing, se están produciendo graves afectaciones de los Derechos Humanos, al ser éstos el objeto central de mis estudios, desde hace ya largos años 7. He de destacar que estas páginas responden a la {{necesidad}} que me ha surgido de tomar contacto con ese núcleo de problemas, que entiendo son de una gran complejidad 8 y requieren profunda elaboración y estudio interdisciplinario y, a ser posible, aportar algo a quienes, como yo, se encuentran en fases iniciales de indagación al respecto.

The dominion, use and exploitation {{of land and}} everything linked to it, {{especially with regard to}} access to water resources 1, have always been one of the main ambitions of the human race, with important effects on its history. This is how I have come to understand it and, personally, how it has led me to respectfully acknowledge its obvious importance, a respect that I emphasise when it comes to those who seek their subsistence – rarely easy – by contributing with their energy and care. Apart from this, however, to date it has not been the subject of my research. Yet, I must note that, from time to time, becoming more familiar with certain realities made me somewhat restless. This is the case of the oligopolies created around the world that deal with seeds 2 and fertilisers and herbicides, and the consequences deriving therefrom 3. And the same goes for the extremely high concentration of companies {{at the heart of the}} food supply chains 4. Furthermore, there is also the impact of the agricultural policies of the developed countries on those of the Third World 5 or the so-called aid or cooperation for development 6, etc. The restlessness I referred to earlier has now given way to a marked concern that leads me to approach the growing problems in which, under the label of land grabbing, are producing serious breaches of Human Rights, these having been the main aim of my studies for many years now 7. I must underscore the fact that these pages are a response to the need that has grown within me to make contact with those core issues, which I understand to be highly complex 8 and that require a deep examination and interdisciplinary study, and if possible that offer something to those who, like myself, find themselves in the initial phases of delving into the matter.

40|$|Abstract. The steam {{generators}} at Advanced Gas-Cooled Reactor (AGR) nuclear power {{stations in the}} UK are potentially life-limiting components. Enhancing the capability to monitor the {{steam generators}} {{has been identified as}} having the potential to provide key evidence in justifying the extension of the generating lifetime of the stations. It has been proposed to install new temperature measuring instrumentation to monitor reactor gas temperature and to provide additional data regarding steam generator operating conditions. The modification will be to introduce thermocouples to the bore of an intact steam generator tube to facilitate temperature measurement at or near to the locations of interest. The modified steam generator tube will be sealed at the feed header upstand. Between the upper surface of the superheater header tubeplate and the wall of the superheater header, the thermocouple bundle and sheath will be contained within a rigid stainless steel guide tube. The guide tube will be attached at both ends by welds, each forming a pressure boundary. At the tubeplate a weld will separate the bore of the sealed guide tube from the steam space within the superheater header; a weld between the guide tube and the superheater header will separate the steam space within the superheater header from atmosphere outside the header. In order to obtain a better design, three 3 -dimentional finite element models have been created using ABAQUS. A series of cyclic pressure, and start-up and shutdown thermal transient stress analyses have been carried out to provide stress values for structural integrity assessments to be conducted using ASME <b>III,</b> <b>Subsection</b> NH and R 5. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this task is to identify issues relevant to ASME Section <b>III,</b> <b>Subsection</b> NH [1], and related Code Cases that must be resolved for licensing purposes for VHTGRs (Very High Temperature Gas Reactor concepts {{such as those of}} PBMR, Areva, and GA); and to identify the material models, design criteria, and analysis methods that need {{to be added to the}} ASME Code to cover the unresolved safety issues. Subsection NH was originally developed to provide structural design criteria and limits for elevated-temperature design of Liquid Metal Fast Breeder Reactor (LMFBR) systems and some gas-cooled systems. The U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and its Advisory Committee for Reactor Safeguards (ACRS) reviewed the design limits and procedures in the process of reviewing the Clinch River Breeder Reactor (CRBR) for a construction permit in the late 1970 s and early 1980 s, and identified issues that needed resolution. In the years since then, the NRC and various contractors have evaluated the applicability of the ASME Code and Code Cases to high-temperature reactor designs such as the VHTGRs, and identified issues that need to be resolved to provide a regulatory basis for licensing. This Report describes: (1) NRC and ACRS safety concerns raised during the licensing process of CRBR, (2) how some of these issues are addressed by the current Subsection NH of the ASME Code; and (3) the material models, design criteria, and analysis methods that need to be added to the ASME Code and Code Cases to cover unresolved regulatory issues for very high temperature service...|$|R
40|$|The {{motility}} {{of certain}} gram-negative bacteria is mediated by retraction of type IV pili surface filaments, which {{are essential for}} infectivity. The retraction {{is powered by a}} strong molecular motor protein, PilT, producing very high forces that can exceed 150 pN. The molecular details of the motor mechanism are still largely unknown, while other features have been identified, such as the ring-shaped protein structure of the PilT motor. The surprisingly high forces generated by the PilT system motivate a model investigation of the generation of large forces in molecular motors. We propose a simple model, involving a small ensemble of motor subunits interacting through the deformations on a circular backbone with finite stiffness. The model describes the motor subunits in terms of diffusing particles in an asymmetric, time-dependent binding potential (flashing ratchet potential), roughly corresponding to the ATP hydrolysis cycle. We compute force-velocity relations in a subset of the parameter space and explore how the maximum force (stall force) is determined by stiffness, binding strength, ensemble size, and degree of asymmetry. We identify two qualitatively different regimes of operation depending on the relation between ensemble size and asymmetry. In the transition between these two regimes, the stall force depends nonlinearly on the number of motor subunits. Compared to its constituents without interactions, we find higher efficiency and qualitatively different force-velocity relations. The model captures several of the qualitative features obtained in experiments on pilus retraction forces, such as roughly constant velocity at low applied forces and insensitivity in the stall force to changes in the ATP concentration.

40|$|Current {{interest}} {{expressed by}} industry in HTGR plants, particularly modular plants with power {{up to about}} 600 MW(e) per unit, has prompted NRC to task PNNL with assessing the currently available literature related to codes and standards applicable to HTGR plants, the operating history {{of past and present}} HTGR plants, and with evaluating the proposed designs of RPV and associated piping for future plants. Considering these topics in the order they are arranged in the text, first the operational histories of five shut-down and two currently operating HTGR plants are reviewed, leading the authors to conclude that while small, simple prototype HTGR plants operated reliably, some of the larger plants, particularly Fort St. Vrain, had poor availability. Safety and radiological performance of these plants has been considerably better than LWR plants. Petroleum processing plants provide some applicable experience with materials similar to those proposed for HTGR piping and vessels. At least one currently operating plant - HTR- 10 - has performed and documented a leak before break analysis that appears to be applicable to proposed future US HTGR designs. Current codes and standards cover some HTGR materials, but not all materials are covered to the high temperatures envisioned for HTGR use. Codes and standards, particularly ASME Codes, are under development for proposed future US HTGR designs. A 'roadmap' document has been prepared for ASME Code development; a new <b>subsection</b> to section <b>III</b> of the ASME Code, ASME BPVC III- 5, is scheduled to be published in October 2011. The question of terminology for the cross-duct structure between the RPV and power conversion vessel is discussed, considering the differences in regulatory requirements that apply depending on whether this structure is designated as a 'vessel' or as a 'pipe'. We conclude that designing this component as a 'pipe' is the more appropriate choice, but that the ASME BPVC allows the owner of the facility to select the preferred designation, and that either designation can be acceptable...|$|R
40|$|Heavy Water Plant, Kota is {{the first}} {{indigenous}} heavy water plant built in India. The plant started operation in the year 1985 and it is approaching the completion of its originally stipulated design life. In view of the excellent record of plant operation for the past so many years, it has been planned to carry out various exercises for the life extension of the plant. In the first stage, evaluation of operation stresses was carried out for the process critical piping layouts and equipment, which are connected with 25 process critical nozzle locations, identified based on past history of the plant performance. Fatigue life evaluation {{has been carried out}} to fmd out the Cumulative Usage Factor, which helps in arriving at a decision regarding the life extension of the plant. The results of these exercises have been already reported separately vide BARC/ 200 I /E/O 04. In the second stage, seismic reevaluation of the plant has been carried out to assess its ability to maintain its integ:rity in case of a seismic event. The aim of this exercise is to assess the effects of the maximum probable earthquake at the plant site on the various systems and components of the plant. This exercise is further aimed at ensuring the adequacy of seismic supports to maintain the integrity of the system in case of a seismic event and to suggest some retrofitting measures, if required. Seismic re-evaluation of the piping of Heavy Water Plant, Kota has been performed taking into account the interaction effects from the connected equipment. Each layout has been qualified using the latest provisions of ASME Code Section <b>III,</b> <b>Subsection</b> ND wherein the earthquake loading has been considered as a reversing dynamic load. The maximum combined stresses for all the layouts due to pressure, weight and seismic loadings {{have been found to be}} well within the code allowable limit. Therefore, it has been concluded that during a maximum probable seismic event, the possibility of pipe rupture can be saf...|$|R
40|$|The Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP), {{which is}} an {{advanced}} high temperature gas reactor (HTGR) concept with emphasis on production of both electricity and hydrogen, involves helium as the coolant and a closed-cycle gas turbine for power generation with a core outlet/gas turbine inlet temperature of 900 - 1000 C. In the indirect cycle system, an intermediate heat exchanger is used to transfer the heat from primary helium from the core to the secondary fluid, which can be helium, nitrogen/helium mixture, or a molten salt. The system concept for the vary high temperature reactor (VHTR) can be a reactor based on the prismatic block of the GT-MHR developed by a consortium led by General Atomics in the U. S. or based on the PBMR design developed by ESKOM of South Africa and British Nuclear Fuels of U. K. This report has made an assessment on the issues pertaining to the intermediate heat exchanger (IHX) for the NGNP. A detailed thermal hydraulic analysis, using models developed at ANL, was performed to calculate heat transfer, temperature distribution, and pressure drop. Two IHX designs namely, shell and straight tube and compact heat exchangers were considered in an earlier assessment. Helical coil heat exchangers were analyzed in the current report {{and the results were}} compared with the performance features of designs from industry. In addition, a comparative analysis is presented between the shell and straight tube, helical, and printed circuit heat exchangers from the standpoint of heat exchanger volume, primary and secondary sides pressure drop, and number of tubes. The IHX being a high temperature component, probably needs to be designed using ASME Code Section <b>III,</b> <b>Subsection</b> NH, assuming that the IHX will be classified as a class 1 component. With input from thermal hydraulic calculations performed at ANL, thermal conduction and stress analyses were performed for the helical heat exchanger design and the results were compared with earlier-developed results on shell and straight tube and printed circuit heat exchangers...|$|R
40|$|The {{national}} security exception under Article XXI of GATT {{is a major}} exception to Members’ obligations under the WTO. However, it has been {{claimed to be a}} loophole to the WTO system, and it goes beyond the principles of general international law on lawful suspension of treaty obligations. Throughout the GATT 1947 and WTO practice, from early cases to the case US – Helms-Burton regarding the U. S. embargo against Cuba, it has not yet been resolved whether Article XXI could be subject to the WTO dispute settlement system. The subject matter of this thesis has significant importance today. Russia imposed counter sanctions on the EU, Norway, the United States, Australia and Canada, and banned the importation of listed agricultural products, raw materials and food from the targeted countries. By doing so, Russia violated its obligations under the WTO. However, Russia justified its measures stating that {{it is a matter of}} its ‘{{national security}} interests’. Economic sanctions have played a role in the trade arena as a tool for states’ foreign policy. The relationship between the WTO and national security remains still unresolved after nearly 70 years. The Russian unilateral justification for its counter sanctions, could make a potential case to the WTO panels or the Appellate Body on Article XXI of GATT. This thesis will discuss, whether the WTO panels and the Appellate Body should have a competence to investigate the national security exception Article XXI of GATT in a dispute, and second, whether they can assess the justification of economic sanctions taken under Article XXI(b) (iii) of GATT, and third, if so, how such assessment and interpretation of justification could be conducted. Forth, it will be reviewed whether the WTO should tolerate the unlimited invocation of Article XXI by Members. This thesis is faithful to legal dogmatic method. To understand the subject matter, the first part will shortly explain the main provisions of GATT and economic sanctions in the context relevant to this study, and then provide an overview of the WTO jurisdiction and its dispute settlement system in the light of state sovereignty, which is vital to bear in mind in the discussion of national security. In the second part, this thesis will study thoroughly Article XXI of the GATT, focusing on its most controversial <b>subsection</b> (b) (<b>iii).</b> To understand well the key issues, it is necessary to discuss in this part the historical background and the preliminary works of the security exception clause. This will be examined and assessed through the relevant cases on the invocation of the Article XXI, in the light of the presented varying interpretations and factual grounds. The third part will look at the WTO panels’ and the Appellate Body’s possible methods for interpreting ‘justification’ of economic sanctions taken under Article XXI(b) (iii) of GATT, both in the light of case history and principles of general international law, and will propose an alternative approach which could be applied arising national security related disputes.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of the {{proposed}} project {{is the development of}} validated nondestructive evaluation (NDE) techniques for in situ monitoring of ferritic-martensitic steels like Grade 91 9 Cr- 1 Mo, which are candidate materials for Generation IV nuclear energy structural components operating at temperatures up to ~ 650 {degree}C and for steam-generator tubing for sodium-cooled fast reactors. Full assessment of thermomechanical damage requires a clear separation between thermally activated microstructural evolution and creep damage caused by simultaneous mechanical stress. Creep damage can be classified as "negligible" creep without significant plastic strain and "ordinary" creep of the primary, secondary, and tertiary kind that is accompanied by significant plastic deformation and/or cavity nucleation and growth. Under negligible creep conditions of interest in this project, minimal or no plastic strain occurs, and the accumulation of creep damage does not significantly reduce the fatigue life of a structural component so that low-temperature design rules, such as the ASME Section <b>III,</b> <b>Subsection</b> NB, can be applied with confidence. The proposed research project will utilize a multifaceted approach in which the feasibility of electrical conductivity and thermo-electric monitoring methods is researched and coupled with detailed post-thermal/creep exposure characterization of microstructural changes and damage processes using state-of-the-art electron microscopy techniques, with the aim of establishing the most effective nondestructive materials evaluation technique for particular degradation modes in high-temperature alloys that are candidates for use in the Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) as well as providing the necessary mechanism-based underpinnings for relating the two. Only techniques suitable for practical application in situ will be considered. As the project evolves and results accumulate, we will also study the use of this technique for monitoring other GEN IV materials. Through the results obtained from this integrated materials behavior and NDE study, new insight will be gained into the best nondestructive creep and microstructure monitoring methods for the particular mechanisms identified in these materials. The proposed project includes collaboration with a national laboratory partner and the results will also serve as a foundation to guide the efforts of scientists in the DOE laboratory, university, and industrial communities concerned with the technological challenges of monitoring creep and microstructural evolution in materials planned to be used in Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems...|$|R
40|$|The genetic {{study of}} the C. elegans dauer {{developmental}} decision has served as an experimental paradigm for understanding how environmental cues influence organismal physiology through evolutionarily conserved neuroendocrine signaling mechanisms. My genetic characterization of the previously isolated daf- 28 (sa 191) mutant that enters dauer constitutively has revealed cell-nonautonomous roles of conserved stress signaling pathways-the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) and translational control mediated by eIF 2 [alpha] phosphorylation. While the cell-autonomous functions of these stress-responsive mechanisms in maintaining cellular homeostasis have been examined, their organismal effects on remodeling development and stress responses remain largely unexplored. Chapter II will highlight the hypotheses and approaches that led to identification of the PEK- 1 /PERK branch of the UPR, functioning {{in a pair of}} chemosensory neurons, as a novel regulator of the dauer developmental decision. Chapter III will examine the systemic effects of eIF 2 [alpha] phosphorylation, downstream of PERK/PEK- 1 activation, in the sensory nervous system on larval development and stress responses. Specifically, the identification of the C. elegans translational regulatory factors that function as molecular determinants of cellular and systemic sensitivity to eIF 2 [alpha] phosphorylation will be described. <b>Subsections</b> of Chapter <b>III</b> and IV will also highlight genes whose functions can modify the organismal effects of the UPR and eIF 2 [alpha] phosphorylation: these genes are involved in modulation of ER proteostasis or function in the dauer neuroendocrine pathways that interact with the UPR or eIF 2 [alpha] phosphorylation. Finally, we proceed to show that alterations in the neuronal eIF 2 [alpha] phosphorylation status may modulate sensory processing to influence diverse physiological outputs, mimicking the effects of starvation or unfavorable microbial environment. Collectively, results from my study indicate that modulation of the UPR and eIF 2 [alpha]-mediated translational control in the sensory nervous system confers substantial cell-nonautonomous effects on animal physiology. These findings underscore how molecular events underlying cellular homeostasis, which can be perturbed by fluctuating environmental and developmental conditions, may be co-opted to systemically reprogram organismal stress responses in C. elegans. by Warakorn Kulalert.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{activity}} is to provide simplified criteria {{which can be used}} in rapid feasibility assessments of the structural viability of very high temperature components in conceptual and early preliminary design phases for Generation IV reactors. The current criteria in ASME Code Section <b>III,</b> <b>Subsection</b> NH, hereafter referred to as NH, (and Code Case N- 201 for core support structures) are difficult and require a complex deconstruction of finite element analysis results for their implementation. Further, and most important, times, temperatures and some materials of interest to the very high temperature Generation IV components are not covered by the current provisions of NH. Future revisions to NH are anticipated that will address very high temperature Generation IV components and materials requirements but, until that occurs interim guidance is required for design activities to proceed. These simplified criteria are for design guidance and are not necessarily in rigorous compliance with NH methodology. Rather, the objective is for criteria which address the early design needs of very high temperature Generation IV components and materials. The intent is to provide simplified but not overly conservative design methods. When more rigorous criteria and methods are incorporated in NH, the degree of conservatism should obviously be reduced. These criteria are based on currently available information. Although engineering judgments {{have been made in the}} formulation of these criteria they are not intended to require additional development or testing prior to implementation as a tool for use in conceptual and early preliminary design. Appendices are provided herein that contain useful information. The simplified methods were developed specifically with Alloy 617 in mind; however, they could be applied for the same intended purpose for other materials such as 9 Cr- 1 Mo, Alloy 800 H, etc. However, supporting design curves, stress allowables, and isochronous curves may/were not available at this time for temperatures of approximately 1000 C. Appendix A is a brief summary of the Simplified Methods that follow. Appendix B contains charts and plots of allowable stress values for Alloy 617.

40|$|This Technical Review Report (TRR) {{summarizes}} the review findings for the Safety Analysis Report for Packaging (SARP) for the Model 9977 B(M) F- 96 shipping container. The content analyzed for this submittal is Content Envelope C. 1, Heat Sources, in assemblies of Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators or food-pack cans. The SARP under review, i. e., S-SARP-G- 00001, Revision 2 (August 2007), was originally {{referred to as}} the General Purpose Fissile Material Package. The review presented in this TRR was performed using the methods outlined in Revision 3 of the Department of Energy's (DOE's) Packaging Review Guide (PRG) for Reviewing Safety Analysis Reports for Packages. The format of the SARP follows that specified in Revision 2 of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's, Regulatory Guide 7. 9, i. e., Standard Format and Content of Part 71 Applications for Approval of Packages for Radioactive Material. Although the two documents are similar in their content, they are not identical. Formatting differences have been noted in this TRR, where appropriate. The Model 9977 Package is a 35 -gallon drum package design that has evolved from a family of packages designed by DOE contractors at the Savannah River Site. The Model 9977 Package design includes a single, 6 -inch diameter, stainless steel pressure vessel containment system (i. e., the 6 CV) that was designed and fabricated in accordance with Section <b>III,</b> <b>Subsection</b> NB, of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers Boiler & Pressure Vessel Code. The earlier package designs, i. e., the Model 9965, 9966, 9967 and 9968 Packages, were originally designed and certified in the 1980 s. In the 1990 s, updated package designs that incorporated design features consistent with new safety requirements, based on International Atomic Energy Agency guidelines, were proposed. The updated package designs were the Model 9972, 9973, 9974 and 9975 Packages, respectively. The Model 9975 Package was certified by the Packaging Certification Program, under the Office of Safety Management and Operations. Differences between the Model 9975 Package and the Model 9977 Package include: (1) The lead shield present in the Model 9975 Package is absent in the Model 9977 Package; (2) The Model 9975 Package has eight allowable contents, while the Model 9977 Package has a single allowable content. (3) The 6 CV of the Model 9977 Package is similar in design to the outer Containment Vessel of the Model 9975 Package that also incorporates a 5 -inch Containment Vessel as the inner Containment Vessel.
