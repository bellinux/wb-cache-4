50|$|In 1981, the McGuffins {{completed}} their first long distance journey together. They spent {{four and a}} half months backpacking the 2100 mile Appalachian Trail through 14 states from Georgia to Maine. Gary photographed their journey with a Pentax K1000 35mm camera and a 50mm lens. The only other photographic equipment he carried consisted of a tiny tripod which could be <b>screwed,</b> clamped or <b>balanced</b> on a variety of surfaces. With only seven rolls of 36-exposure Kodak slide film, Gary could only average 2 photographs a day to document the expedition. Using a system of small town post offices, they received new supplies and sent their photographs and writing journals back home. The long-distance journey confirmed their personal commitment to a life of exploration and adventure. The success of completing the Appalachian Trail led them dream bigger dreams together.|$|R
40|$|The Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) {{system is}} {{considered}} one of the leading technologies for waste heat recovery applications. In order to increase the overall efficiency, design improvements and optimization analyses are necessary. The expander is the key component to convert the thermal energy in useful work. Several volumetric and turbine expanders have been investigated. Among volumetric machines, scroll, twin-screw and vane-type expanders are the main technologies. Recently, a number of experimental studies on single screw expanders (SSE) have been carried out, demonstrating the feasibility of employing such machine as an ORC expander. The single screw configuration presents a number of advantages over twin <b>screw</b> including <b>balanced</b> loading of the main screw, long working life, high volumetric efficiency. In this paper, a detailed geometry-based multi-chamber model of a single screw expander is presented. The model is based on a rotation-dependent function that entirely describes the geometry of the engaging surface between the screw rotor and the starwheels. The computation of the swept volume at each angular step and the inlet conditions, enables the solution of the system of differential equations governing the thermodynamic problem. The level of details of the model, which includes heat transfer losses, oil-flooded mixing and leakage paths calculation, allows the investigation of the impact of design changes to the expander machine performance. The validation of the proposed model is realized with experimental data obtained from an ORC set up which employs a SSE and Solkatherm (SES 36) as working fluid. Test results have shown a maximum isentropic efficiency of 67 % at 3000 rpm. The model predicts the mass flow rate and the power output within ± 10 % and ± 15 % respectively...|$|R
50|$|Early watches used a {{solid steel}} balance. As {{temperature}} increased, the solid balance expanded in size, changing {{the moment of}} inertia and changing {{the timing of the}} watch. In addition, the hairspring would lengthen, decreasing its spring constant. This problem was initially solved through the use of the compensation balance. The compensation balance consisted of a ring of steel sandwiched to a ring of brass. These rings were then split in two places. The balance would, at least theoretically, actually decrease in size with heating to compensate for the lengthening of the hairspring. Through careful adjustment of the placement of the <b>balance</b> <b>screws</b> (brass or gold screws placed in the rim of the balance), a watch could be adjusted to keep time the same at both hot (100 °F) and cold (32°) temperatures. Unfortunately, a watch so adjusted would run slow at temperatures between these two. The problem was completely solved through the use of special alloys for the balance and hairspring which were essentially immune to thermal expansion. Such an alloy is used in Hamilton's 992E and 992B.|$|R
40|$|Conventional drug {{delivery}} systems {{are often not}} suitable for new protein based and other Therapeutic compounds produced by modern technology. Therefore an alternative Approach to deliver these drugs can be achieved through the skin {{in the form of}} transcutaneous {{drug delivery}} system. Modern medicine has responded with the development of methods to deliver drug transcutanously (through) the skin for therapeutic use as an alternative to traditional route including oral, intravascular, intramuscular, subcutaneous, and sublingual. Transcutaneous drug delivery has many theoretic and practical advantage and disadvantages, and such issues are often a concern for both clinicians and patients. Transcutaneous patches are flexible pharmaceutical preparations of varying sizes, containing one or more active ingredient, intended to be applied to the unbroken skin in order to deliver the active ingredient to the systemic circulation after passing through the skin barriers. A Transcutaneous patch or skin patch is a medicated adhesive patch that is placed on the skin to deliver a specific dose of medication through the skin and into the bloodstream. Often, this promotes healing to an injured area of the body. In this method, the drug enters the bloodstream directly through skin and it avoid first pass effect. Characterization of Transcutaneous patch are necessary because check it’s quality, size, time of onset & duration, adhesive property, thickness, weight of patch, moisture of content, uniformity & cutaneous toxicological studies. Their requirements for evaluation are HPLC, U. V. spectrophotometer, <b>screw</b> gauge, digital <b>balance,</b> desiccators, thin layer chromatography & K. C. Cell used...|$|R
5000|$|John Birch's guitar pickups had {{a unique}} {{construction}} {{compared to other}} pickups of the time. Normally, pickups use Alnico or Ceramic magnets, occasionally Samarium-Cobalt, as in Bill Lawrence's Fender SCN pickups, or even Neodymium, as in Q-Tuner's bass pickups. Birch used cobalt steel magnets, oversized {{to make up for}} their relative weakness as compared to Alnico. However, there are Magnum, Hyperflux, Multiflux and Biflux pickups with smaller Alnico magnets. (J1 Hyperflux/Biflux, J1 Magnum/Biflux and J2 Multiflux, built 1977, these guitars were all built shortly after John Diggins left JBG in 1977.) He also used much finer copper wire than most other pickups because finer wire allows more wire to be wound on the bobbins, which results in a more powerful sound. Finer than normal wire also accentuates high frequencies, though fine wire can have a [...] "thin" [...] sound if not compensated for in other ways, such as higher resistance, shorter coils, or more metal in the magnetic field to raise inductance. Also, he potted the pickups in black epoxy (the 1977 pickups with the alnico magnets were all potted with a cream-coloured epoxy) to fight microphonic feedback caused by unwanted vibrations of the copper wire. The epoxy keeps the wire from moving. The covers to the pickups were stainless steel. Finally, Birch used a row of 9 instead of 6 <b>balance</b> <b>screws</b> as polepieces to create a broader area for the pickup to sense the vibrating string. With Fender single coils or Gibson humbuckers, the strings each have an individual polepiece. However, if the player bends a string, that string can move over an area where there is no pole, and the sound will get weaker.|$|R
40|$|Twin-screw {{pumps are}} {{positive}} displacement machines. Two meshing screws connected by timing gears convey the fluid {{trapped in the}} screw chambers axially from suction to discharge and force it out against the back pressure. Because of the screw geometry, the circumferential pressure field around the <b>screws</b> is not <b>balanced,</b> resulting in net dynamic and static pressures applied on the rotors. The research work presented here aims at building and verifying a model to predict both: (1) the exciting lateral hydrodynamic forces produced by the unbalanced pressure field, and (2) the rotor response due to those forces. The model rests on the screw pump hydraulic models for predicting the pressure in the screw chambers {{as a function of}} the discharge pressure. These models are extended to predict the steady state dynamic pressure field {{as a function of the}} rotational angle of the rotor. The dynamic force resulting from the dynamic pressure field is calculated and applied to the rotor as a set of super-synchronous periodic forces. The structural model of the screw, although nonsymmetrical, was found to be accurately represented by an axisymmetric equivalent structure. The rotor response to the dynamic super-synchronous forces is calculated to predict the pump rotordynamic behavior. The work in this dissertation presents: (1) the axisymmetric structural model of the rotors (2) the proposed dynamic pressure model, (3) the screw pump rotor response, (4) the experimental validation of the dynamic pressure model and rotor response. The topic of twin-screw pump rotordynamics is absent from the literature. The original contribution of the work presented in this dissertation to the field of rotordynamics includes: (1) demonstrating the adequacy of an axisymmetric model for modeling the screw section, (2) developing a model for predicting the dynamic pressure field around the screws, (3) characterization of the dynamic forces (synchronous and its harmonics) applied at the screw pump rotors, (4) predicting the dynamic response of twin-screw pump rotors due to hydrodynamic forces, (5) measuring the axial dynamic pressure in two circumferential planes around the screws to verify pressure predictions, (6) measuring the dynamic response of twin-screw pump rotor...|$|R
5000|$|Modern (2007) watch balance {{wheels are}} usually made of Glucydur, a low thermal {{expansion}} alloy of beryllium, copper and iron, with springs of a low thermal coefficient of elasticity alloy such as Nivarox. [...] The two alloys are matched so their residual temperature responses cancel out, resulting in even lower temperature error. The wheels are smooth, to reduce air friction, and the pivots are supported on precision jewel bearings. Older balance wheels used weight screws around the rim to adjust the poise (balance), but modern wheels are computer-poised at the factory, using a laser to burn a precise pit in the rim to make them balanced. [...] Balance wheels rotate about 1½ turns with each swing, that is, about 270° to each side of their center equilibrium position. The rate of the balance wheel is adjusted with the regulator, a lever with a narrow slit on the end through which the balance spring passes. This holds {{the part of the}} spring behind the slit stationary. Moving the lever slides the slit up and down the balance spring, changing its effective length, and thus the resonant vibration rate of the balance. Since the regulator interferes with the spring's action, chronometers and some precision watches have ‘free sprung’ balances with no regulator, such as the Gyromax. Their rate is adjusted by weight <b>screws</b> on the <b>balance</b> rim. A balance's vibration rate is traditionally measured in beats (ticks) per hour, or BPH, although beats per second and Hz are also used. The length of a beat is one swing of the balance wheel, between reversals of direction, so there are two beats in a complete cycle. Balances in precision watches are designed with faster beats, because they are less affected by motions of the wrist. [...] Alarm clocks and kitchen timers often have a rate of 4 beats per second (14,400 BPH). Watches made prior to the 1970s usually had a rate of 5 beats per second (18,000 BPH). Current watches have rates of 6 (21,600 BPH), 8 (28,800 BPH) and a few have 10 beats per second (36,000 BPH). During WWII, Elgin produced a very precise stopwatch that ran at 40 beats per second (144,000 BPH), earning it the nickname 'Jitterbug'. [...] Audemars Piguet currently produces a movement that allows for a very high balance vibration of 12 beats/s (43,200 BPH). [...] The precision of the best balance wheel watches on the wrist is around a few seconds per day. The most accurate balance wheel timepieces made were marine chronometers, which by WWII had achieved accuracies of 0.1 second per day.|$|R
