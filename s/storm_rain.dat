A memoir attributed to one Joseph Deiner, who was {{claimed to have been}} present, appeared in the Vienna Morgen-Post of 28 January 1856. The night of Mozart's death was dark and stormy at the funeral, too, it began to rage and <b>storm.</b> <b>Rain</b> and snow fell at the same time, as if Nature wanted to shew her anger with the great composer's contemporaries, who had turned out extremely sparsely for his burial. Only a few friends and three women accompanied the corpse. Mozart's wife was not present. These few people with their umbrellas stood round the bier, which then taken via the Grosse Schullerstrasse to the St. Marx Cemetery. As the storm grew ever more violent, even these few friends determined to turn back at the Stuben Gate, and they betook themselves to the [...] "Silver Snake". Deiner, the landlord, was also present for the funeral. As Slonimsky (1960:12-14) notes, the tale was widely adopted and incorporated into Mozart biographies.|$|E
50|$|Suitable {{vehicles}} for Turner's imagination {{were found in}} shipwrecks, fires (such as the burning of Parliament in 1834, an event which Turner rushed to witness first-hand, and which he transcribed {{in a series of}} watercolour sketches), natural catastrophes, and natural phenomena such as sunlight, <b>storm,</b> <b>rain,</b> and fog. He was fascinated by the violent power of the sea, as seen in Dawn after the Wreck (1840) and The Slave Ship (1840).Turner's major venture into printmaking was the Liber Studiorum (Book of Studies), seventy prints that he worked on from 1806 to 1819. The Liber Studiorum was an expression of his intentions for landscape art. The idea was loosely based on Claude Lorrain's Liber Veritatis (Book of Truth), where Claude had recorded his completed paintings; a series of print copies of these drawings, by then at Devonshire House, had been a huge publishing success. Turner's plates were meant to be widely disseminated, and categorised the genre into six types: Marine, Mountainous, Pastoral, Historical, Architectural, and Elevated or Epic Pastoral. His printmaking was a major part of his output, and a museum is devoted to it, the Turner Museum in Sarasota, Florida, founded in 1974 by Douglass Montrose-Graem to house his collection of Turner prints.|$|E
50|$|William's {{accession}} {{to the throne}} fell into {{a time of great}} economic hardship. In April 1815, Mount Tambora erupted in Indonesia, which led to a long-term deterioration of global weather conditions. In {{the spring and summer of}} 1816 there was nowhere in Europe without a <b>storm,</b> <b>rain</b> or hail. In October the first snow fell in W√ºrttemberg. The year 1816 became known as the Year Without A Summer. In W√ºrttemberg, there were crop failures which gave rise to food prices. In the winter of 1816/1817, famine broke out. To alleviate the plight, the government fixed maximum prices for food, made exporting difficult and later banned it. Large amounts of grain were brought from outside the country. The famine was alleviated by the King and Queen, whose policies were aimed at long-term improvement in the economic situation of all social classes. William implemented agricultural reforms, while Catherine devoted her care to the poor. On November 20, 1818, William set up an Agricultural Academy in Hohenheim to radically improve general nutrition in the kingdom through teaching, experimentation and demonstration and, in so doing, laid the foundation for the University of Hohenheim. In the same year he set up the Cannstatter Volksfest, which was to take place annually on 28 September, a day after the king's birthday. William bought cattle and sheep from abroad for farmers to raise them in W√ºrttemberg and he was known for his Arabian stallions that formed part of the Marbach stud. Around the country, Catherine set up charities, which were controlled by a national charity in Stuttgart. Donations were received from the private property of the royal couple, by Catherine's mother the Tsarina, and by other members of the royal family. The W√ºrttembergische Landessparkasse (Wurttemberg State Savings Bank) was established on May 12, 1818, on Catherine's initiative. At the same time, a poor relief authority was set up in the Ministry of Interior. The completion of the Katharinenhospital in 1828 was initiated via a donation by Catherine in 1817.|$|E

50|$|Shri Ahichchhatra Parshvanath Atishaya Kshetra Digambar Jain Mandir is {{thousands}} years {{ancient and}} its reconstruction {{was done in}} the year 1975 and its ‚ÄòPanch Kalyanaka Mahotsava‚Äô was organized under the holy presence and guidance of Acharya Vimal Sagarji, Acharya Kunthu Sagarji and Acharya Shanti Sagarji in the year 1978. The 7 altars with 7 spires are there inside the courtyard of the temple. The description about these altars is as follows: - (i) The altar of ‚ÄòTikhal Wale Baba‚Äô is the first altar, which was built by Gods of heaven. Attractive Green colored emerald statue of principal deity Bhagwan Parshvanath is also established in this altar. Devotees believe that all desires are fulfilled and many difficulties are averted when we offer prayers devotionally to ‚ÄòTikhal Wale Baba‚Äô. The rock inscriptions is present inside this altar on which it is written that - ‚ÄúIt is that sacred land where Bhagwan Parshvanath did deep meditation and his opponent ‚ÄòKamath‚Äô tried to distract him by making <b>storm,</b> <b>rain</b> of hailstones happen at the place where Bhagwan Parshvanath was doing meditation. At this miraculous place only Dharnendra & Padmawati showed their devotion by spreading serpent hood over Shri Parshvanath at that time. Thus they tried to protect Bhagwan Parshvanath from the distraction of ‚ÄòSamvar Dev‚Äô. At this place only Tikhal Wale Baba is worshipped. At this place desires of thousands of devotees are fulfilled. Many sinners have started following the right path after doing repentance here. This altar is established on those walls only about which it is said that they were built by Gods of heaven themselves. The peace, which we get after viewing the idol, is indefinable & unforgettable.‚Äù (ii) On {{the left side of the}} sanctum of the temple the 6 feet high quite beautiful Padmasanastha idol of Bhagwan Mahaveer Swami is established on the first altar. The idol is endowed with calm and pleasing effect. (iii) The 5 feet high Padmasanastha idol of Bhagwan Parshvanath surmounted by 11 serpent hoods is established in the third altar of this temple and it looks quite attractive. (iv) The one beautiful ‚ÄòSamavsharan Mandir‚Äô is also built here which was reverenced under the guidance of Acharya 108 Shri Ajit Sagarji in the year 1990. The four exquisite idols of Bhagwan Parshvanath facing four sides are established in the center of the temple. The memories related to the first Samavsharan of Bhagwan Parshvanath and his first enlightening percept becomes alive when we take a view of this Samavsharan Mandir. (v) The 7 feet high Padmasanastha idol of Bhagwan Parshvanath surmounted with 11 serpent hoods is established in the next altar. This idol can be said as an example of excellence of art. (vi) There are three prominent idols present in this temple and these idols are carved on a stone slab. All the three idols are light brown in color. The idol of ‚ÄòPanch Balyati‚Äô is one among these and ‚ÄòKhadagasana‚Äô idol of Bhagwan Parshvanath surmounted by serpent hoods is installed in the center of the idol of ‚ÄòPanch Balyati‚Äô. The 3.5 feet high idol of Bhagwan Adinath is carved on a stone slab of this altar. The ‚ÄòYaksha‚Äô & ‚ÄòYakshini‚Äô are also being carved on both sides of idol of Bhagwan Adinath. The idol is quite artistic. The idols present in this altar are about one thousand years ancient. (vii) The black colored and with 7 serpent hoods endowed idol of Bhagwan Parshvanath is installed in last but artistic altar. The 2 artistic idols, discovered while excavating earth, are also installed in this altar. One idol among these is idol of ‚ÄòPanch Balyati‚Äô of ‚ÄòAshtadhatu‚Äô (Alloy of eight metals). The second idol is combined idol of Bhagwan Shantinath, Bhagwan Kunthunath & Bhagwan Arahanath and it is brown in color.|$|E
40|$|Research {{has proven}} that Shoreline Erosion {{is caused by}} excess water {{contained}} within the shore face. This Research presents an opportunity to control erosion by managing the near shore water table. Our Research on Bogue Banks North Carolina suggests that our buildings and other impervious surfaces collect and concentrate water from <b>storm</b> <b>rain</b> runoff into the surface water table and within the critical beach front water exit point. Presently our Potable Fresh Water is supplied from deep wells located beneath an impervious layer of Marl. After our use, the Waste water is drained into the Surface Aquifer, the combined waste and <b>storm</b> <b>rain</b> water raises the Surface Aquifer water table and produces Erosion. The Deep Aquifers presently supplying our Potable Water have an unknown recharge rate, with increasing reports of Salt Water intrusion. We believe our Vital Fresh water supply system should be modified to supply Reverse Osmosis treatment plants from shallow wells. This will lower the Surface Water Table. These Shallow wells, either horizontal or vertical, might be located within the beach front, adjacent to high erosion risk properties. Beach Drains and Reverse Osmosis Water systems are new and proven technologies. By combining these technologies we can reduce or reverse Shore Erosion, ensure a safe Potable Water supply, reduce requirements for periodic beach nourishment, reduce taxes and protect our property well into the Future.
