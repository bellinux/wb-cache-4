ARSS {{is located on the}} roof of the Biomedical Research Foundation of the Academy of Athens (37.9 N, 23.8 E) at an elevation of 130 m above mean sea level. The site is located close to the Athens city centre and 10 km from the sea. ARSS is equipped with a CIMEL CE318-NEDPS9 solar photometer for the retrieval of the aerosol optical depth at 8 wavelengths from 340 to 1640 nm, including polarization observations. The CIMEL instrument is a part of NASA's AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network). The data are processed on a daily basis and are available at AERONET's webpage along with aerosol inversion retrievals, useful for aerosol characterization purposes (e.g. classification of Saharan dust advection, smoke or volcanic ash episodes etc.). ARSS is additionally equipped with a UV-MFR instrument for radiation measurements in the UV spectral region. The instrumentation of IAASARS constitutes a state-of-the-art passive remote sensing suite for atmospheric research, the first one that ever operated in Athens with such specifications.|$|E

Initially n number of stations are placed in a rectangular area of width×length (w×l) in pairs of a transmitter and a receiver making sure that each receiver is in transmission range of its receptive transmitter and their coordinates are saved.

30|$|In this section, we {{compute the}} {{duration}} of time when channel is sensed busy by a station due to the activity of other stations around it in WMN. According to IEEE 802.11 MAC, {{there are two types}} of situation in busy time sensing: one is virtual carrier sense when network allocation vector (NAV) is set by stations during initial coordination (RTS/CTS) but NAV can only be set to stations within transmission ranges of both transmitter and receiver. The second type of busy time sensed due to physical carrier sense from the stations in transmission/carrier sense ranges of both transmitter and receiver. Busy time computation is simple when all stations are in single transmission range as in single-hop network and they can coordinate their transmission using RTS/CTS mechanism of CSMA carrier avoidance mechanism. But computing busy time becomes very challenging when there are stations in carrier sense range and their transmission can overlap on a <b>sensing</b> <b>station.</b>|$|E

Radiosondes are released twice daily from manned land-based weather stations, commonly located near population centers. Over remote land and oceanic regions, modellers commonly resort to previous 6 hour model predictions for initial conditions. As an alternative, satellite derived atmospheric soundings provide continuous spatial coverage at regular intervals irrespective of geographical location. With the recent installation of a remote <b>sensing</b> <b>station</b> at the Hong Kong University of Science & Technology for L-band polar orbiting satellites, comparison studies between radiosonde and satellite derived atmospheric soundings have been initiated. Microwave and infrared emission measurements from the NOAA- 12 polar orbiting satellite were processed with a TOVS (Tiros Operational Vertical Sounder) retrieval software package developed by the University of Wisconsin to derive temperature, dew point, wind direction and speed. Comparisons were conducted when both soundings were within 60 km ground distance and 1 hour of release from each other. Vertical profiles were constructed for 9 standard atmospheric levels from radiosonde and TOVS soundings over the South China Sea region, between January 16 - May 11, 1995. Wind speed profiles were consistently biased from the associated radiosonde profiles. Interestingly, the profiles maintained a similar shape throughout the vertical domain.

40|$|The runoff of {{suspended}} solids and nutrients from land {{into the nation}} 2 ̆ 7 s lakes and rivers can have severe impacts {{on the health of}} these systems and their uses. High-frequency environmental data from sensors can provide insight into fundamental biogeochemical processes that dictate water quality and provide regulators with valuable knowledge on how to manage critical resources. The goal of this research was to utilize sensor technology, telemetry hardware, cyberinfrastructure, and water quality models to create a sensing system that will allow the investigation of the fate and transport of dissolved oxygen, {{suspended solids}}, nutrients, and other water quality parameters throughout a watershed dominated by agricultural activity. Deploying these sensors at multiple locations along the stream enabled the investigation of these processes from the fine scale to the larger watershed scale. Results from this research addressed both fundamental science and resource management issues regarding water quality. Using high-frequency data, a dramatic diel cycle in dissolved oxygen was observed with nonlinear dynamics which was successfully modeled mathematically, and excursions in water quality criteria were observed. In addition, a diel pattern in turbidity was discovered with higher levels at night likely caused by bioturbation (i. e. nocturnal activity of bottom feeding fishes) which resulted in higher suspended solids loadings during nighttime. Furthermore, the QUAL 2 K model was successfully calibrated for water quality using sensor measurements and grab samples from volunteer, IOWATER data. Nutrient loading rates (nitrate-N, orthophosphate, and total dissolved solids) were estimated along the entire creek and were similar to other Iowa streams. Volunteer environmental data were found to be helpful in model calibration for some parameters (e. g. TSS and nitrate). The construction and operation of a sensing system in Clear Creek contributed to water quality science and engineering. Findings from the configuration and field testing of <b>sensing</b> <b>station</b> components such as water quality sensors, power systems and communication hardware will aid the design of future sensing systems and environmental observatories.

40|$|The central Sahara {{has one of}} {{the most}} extreme climates on Earth. During the {{northern}} summer months, a large low pressure system caused by intense solar heating develops over a huge, largely uninhabited expanse of northern Mali, southern Algeria and eastern Mauritania. This Saharan heat low plays a pivotal role in the West African Monsoon. Based on this, the interested French, British and German communities have decided to propose the FENNEC project which aims at (i) characterizing the Saharan atmospheric boundary layer, (ii) evaluating its representation in regional and global models, and (iii) improving "aerosol" products issued from space-borne observations. A key element of this programme was the organization of an international field campaign in June 2011 over the Saharan heat low region, which will include both ground-based and airborne detachments. The Special Observing Period component of FENNEC-France included the implementation of the SAFIRE Falcon 20 to conduct research on the atmospheric boundary layer and the dust cycle of the Sahara, the installation of a remote <b>sensing</b> <b>station</b> in southern Spain, equipped with a backscatter lidar and a sunphotometer, to study the transport of desert dust to Europe, as well as a couple of GPS stations installed in southern Morocco to investigate the moisture inflow from the Atlantic Ocean into the Sahara. For the first time, the ALADIN and AROME models (5 and 24 km grid spacing, respectively) have been implemented operationally to provide forecasts of dust events over the Sahara and parts of the Sahel in June 2011 to assist in planning for airborne operations. This effort was complemented by the forecasts made with the Meso-NH model (5 and 20 km resolution). During the SOP period, the ground-based, airborne and space-borne observations have documented the evolution of dynamic properties of thermodynamic and the atmospheric boundary layer Saharan Africa (Mauritania and Mali) during the installation phase of the Saharan heat low west of the continent as well as the increase in aerosol loading associated with the phase shift of the heat low from east to west. During this period, episodes of intense uplift of desert aerosols associated with various dynamic phenomena (fronts, "Mediterannean surges", "Atlantic inflow" of low-level jets, etc [...] .) have also been documented as well as the export of dust over the Atlantic Ocean.

A novel adaptive evolutionary algorithm (AEA) based on genetic algorithm (GA) to achieve an optimal sensor configuration for monitoring the cutting status closely related to the workpiece quality is proposed. Based on an understanding of the cutting principle, the minimal failure probability at minimum cost is the optimal target and the detectability and the false alarm rate are defined as the constraint conditions. The feasible region of solution is presented in decimal coding. The crossover operator and population size are adapted relative to the iterations estimated by a Markov model,which improve the convergence. The results of a case study have been found to agree well with the optimized results by AEA. The optimal scheme of AEA yields the minimal <b>sensing</b> <b>stations</b> while simultaneously attaining 99. 99 % system detectability and renders nearly 60 % decrease in sensor cost in comparison to the scheme of saturated sensing. ...|$|R

Most of existing deployment models of wireless sensor networks are generic and assume that sensors have a given detection range. This assumption does not fit pollutant concentrations sensing.

This offers greater advantages {{in terms of}} cost as often just a single sensor {{can be used for}} the purpose and this can be employed almost everywhere without <b>sensing</b> <b>stations</b> and has nominal operational costs. In a mobile sensing setup, the accurate knowledge of sampling locations may lead to a manifold increase in the costs.

This work, thus, aims at estimating spatially bandlimited fields from samples, corrupted with measurement noise, collected on sampling locations obtained from an autoregressive model on the intersample distances. The autoregressive model is used to capture the correlation between the intersample distances. In this setup of sampling at unknown sampling locations obtained from an autoregressive model on intersample distances, the mean squared error between the field and its estimated version has been shown to decrease as O($ 1 /n$), where $n$ is the average number of samples taken by the moving sensor.
