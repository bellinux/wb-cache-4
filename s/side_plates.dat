25|$|Work {{on a more}} {{advanced}} armoured fighter, conceived as an armoured version of the Sopwith Snipe, began early in 1918. The forward portion of the fuselage was a 605lb (275kg) box of armour plate, forming {{an integral part of}} the aircraft structure, protecting the pilot and fuel system, with a 0.315 in (8mm) front plate, a 0.433 in (11mm) bottom plate, 0.236 in (6mm) <b>side</b> <b>plates</b> and rear armour consisting of an 11-gauge and 6-gauge plate separated by an air gap. The rear (unarmoured) section of the fuselage was a generally similar structure to the Snipe’s, but flat sided, to match the forepart. The two-bay wings and tailplane were identical in form to those of the Snipe, but were strengthened to cope with the extra weight, while the fin and rudder were identical to the Snipe. The new aircraft used the same Bentley BR2 rotary engine as the Snipe, covered by an unarmoured cowling – the foremost armour plate forming the firewall.|$|E

The most common {{materials}} used for polishing wheels are wood, leather, canvas, cotton cloth, plastic, felt, paper, sheepskin, impregnated rubber, canvas composition, and wool; leather and canvas are the most common. Wooden wheels have emery or other abrasives glued onto them and are used to polish flat surfaces and maintained good edges. There are many types of cloth wheels. Cloth wheels that are cemented together are very hard and used for rough work, whereas other cloth wheels that are sewn and glued together are not as aggressive. There are cloth wheels that are not glued or cemented, instead these are sewed and have metal <b>side</b> <b>plates</b> for support. Solid felt wheels are popular for fine finishes. Hard roughing wheels can be made by cementing together strawboard paper disks. Softer paper wheels are made from felt paper. Most wheels are run at approximately 7500 surface feet per minute (SFM), however muslin, felt and leather wheels are usually run at 4000 SFM.|$|E

The Rock closed out the 20th-anniversary episode of Raw on January 14 {{with one of his}} famous [...] "Rock concerts", leading to a brawl with CM Punk. The following week on Raw, The Rock was attacked by The Shield. Vince McMahon then asserted that if The Shield attacked The Rock in his title match with CM Punk, Punk would be stripped of the WWE Championship. On January 27 at the Royal Rumble, Punk defeated The Rock after The Shield interfered. McMahon was about to strip Punk of the championship, however, at The Rock's request, he instead restarted the match. This culminated in The Rock defeating Punk to win his eighth WWE Championship, a win which marked The Rock's first WWE Championship reign in over ten years, and ending Punk's long reign as champion at 434 days. Punk received a title rematch with The Rock at Elimination Chamber, with the added stipulation that if The Rock was disqualified or counted out, he would lose the title, but Rock pinned Punk to retain the championship. The following night on Raw, The Rock unveiled the new WWE Championship during his championship celebration, with an entirely new center plate and his signature Brahma Bull logo on the <b>side</b> <b>plates.</b> The Rock then resumed his rivalry with John Cena, with Cena blaming his personal and professional troubles on his loss to The Rock the previous year. On April 7 at WrestleMania 29, Rock lost the WWE Championship to Cena, ending his reign at 70 days. Despite being advertised for the Raw after WrestleMania, where it was stated by SmackDown General Manager Booker T that The Rock was still entitled a re-match for the WWE Championship, The Rock did not appear because of a legitimate injury sustained during WrestleMania, in which his abdominal and adductor tendons tore from his pelvis. Johnson underwent surgery on April 23 to reattach the torn tendons.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this paper was the {{optimization}} design of heavy strength carriage for 50 t heavy-duty truck. Two optimization schemes B and C were provided based on original scheme A, which have different thickness of sole/side plate and main longitudinal girder and different number of strengthening ribs. ANSYS was used to do the finite element analysis of equivalent stress and elastic displacement of truck carriages. The equivalent stress of main longitudinal girder, soleplate and transverse bars of soleplate will increase when the soleplate’s thickness was reduced. The maximum of equivalent stress will increase 13 %~ 15 % with 1 mm reduction. When the thickness of <b>side</b> <b>plate</b> or the number of <b>side</b> <b>plate’s</b> strengthening ribs was reduced, the elastic displacement of <b>side</b> <b>plate</b> would increase. Scheme C fulfilled the requirement of structure strength, in which the elastic displacement increases in the allowable range and the lightening ratio was 12. 6 %. Scheme B didn’t fulfill the requirement of structure strength.

40|$|Background: Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) cement-augmented dynamic hip screws (DHS) {{have been}} used as a {{solution}} in unstable intertrochanteric fractures (ITF). Our aim was to investigate the complications in PMMA cement-augmented DHS. Methods: All patients who had received DHS plate osteosynthesis with or without PMMA cement augmentation from August 2005 to July 2009 in one medical center were retrospectively reviewed. The fractures were classified as unstable (31 -A 2. 2, 31 -A 2. 3 and 31 -A 3) {{on the basis of the}} Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Osteosynthesefragen classification. Inclusion criteria were patients older than 75 years, unstable ITF treated with cement-augmented DHS, and a minimum of 12 months of follow-up. Exclusion criteria were stable ITFs, incomplete chart records and imaging studies, loss to follow-up or death before bone union. Results: Three hundred twenty-one patients received DHS during the study period. Sixty-seven patients were included in the study (25 men and 42 women; mean age, 81. 2 years). The mean follow-up time was 40. 2 months, and the mean union time was 18. 5 weeks (12 - 40 weeks). No patient had a lag screw cut-out. Six patients had delayed union or nonunion with <b>side</b> <b>plate</b> failures, including <b>side</b> <b>plate</b> breakage in 1 patient, screw breakage in 3, screw pullout in 1, and recurrent <b>side</b> <b>plate</b> breakage and screw breakage in 1.

Conclusions:Cement-augmented DHS have a different failure mode than screw cutout in conventional DHS. Failures tended to be more related to delayed union, nonunion and resultant <b>side</b> <b>plate</b> construct failure...|$|R

2500|$|Problems arose during {{research}} in the 1950s and 1960s. For a while, engineers were faced with what they called [...] "chatter marks" [...] and [...] "devil's scratch" [...] in the inner epitrochoid surface. They discovered that the cause was the apex seals reaching a resonating vibration, and the problem was solved by reducing the thickness and weight of apex seals. Scratches disappeared after the introduction of more compatible materials for seals and housing coatings. Another early problem was the build-up of cracks in the stator surface near the plug hole, which was eliminated by installing the spark plugs in a separate metal insert/ copper sleeve in the housing, instead of plug being screwed directly into the block housing. Toyota found that substituting a glow-plug for the leading site spark plug improved low rpm, part load, specific fuel consumption by 7%, and also emissions and idle. A later alternative solution to spark plug boss cooling was provided with a variable coolant velocity scheme for water-cooled rotaries, which has had widespread use, being patented by Curtiss-Wright, with the last-listed for better air-cooled engine spark plug boss cooling. These approaches did not require a high-conductivity copper insert, but did not preclude its use.

30|$|The best {{treatment}} for unstable pertrochanteric fractures remains controversial. The diversity of fixation devices available {{for treatment of}} unstable pertrochanteric fractures illustrates the difficulties encountered in the actual treatment. Intramedullary devices have mechanical and biological advantages in such fractures [20]. The dynamic hip screw (DHS) remains the implant of choice because of its favourable results and low rate of non-union or hardware failure [2], but complication rates of the DHS are higher in unstable pertrochanteric fractures; despite {{the widespread use of}} the DHS, cut-out rates of 5 – 17  % {{have been reported in the}} literature [3, 6, 7, 8]. The DHS is often linked to a high incidence of therapeutic failure in patients with pertrochanteric fractures and a severe degree of osteoporosis [1, 11, 13]. Complications have been associated with cut-out of lag screw from femoral head predominantly, particularly in unstable pertrochanteric fractures [3, 21]. Most mechanical failures involve progressive varus deformity at the fracture site. This may increase tension on the <b>side</b> <b>plate</b> screws, leading to failure of screw–bone interface. The <b>side</b> <b>plate</b> pull-out has been reported in patients with severe osteoporosis [4, 11]. The majority of patients (n =  41) in the present study had osteoporosis, and only 4  % patients had fixation failure. No patient had a <b>side</b> <b>plate</b> pull-out in the present study, which may be attributed to the concept of a locking <b>side</b> <b>plate.</b> Strauss et al. [15] reported that the biomechanical advantages seen with helical blade fixation of the femoral head compared to sliding hip screw designs may be useful in managing fractures in patients with poor bone quality. We, as a consequence of this review, are also of the opinion that the dynamic helical hip system (DHHS) is a reliable alternative in stabilization of osteoporotic pertrochanteric fractures.|$|R
