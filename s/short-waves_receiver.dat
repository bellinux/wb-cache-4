5000|$|Though {{there has}} been no {{official}} confirmation (beyond a 1998 article in The Daily Telegraph which quoted a spokesperson for the Department of Trade and Industry as saying, [...] "These stations are what you suppose they are. People shouldn't be mystified by them. They are not for, shall we say, public consumption.") {{there is little doubt that}} most of these numbers stations are primarily used to send messages to spies and other clandestine agents (additional possible uses include communication with embassies when a crisis might dictate destruction of cryptographic equipment and as a backup to normal command systems in wartime). Other intended recipients of secret broadcasts have faster and easier-to-use equipment at their disposal. But number stations are ideal for spies in that they require no special equipment, beyond a <b>short-wave</b> <b>receiver.</b> Morse code skills, once a staple of spy training, are no longer required.|$|R

40|$|Short {{radio waves}} {{propagate}} in the ionosphere- randomly-inhomogeneous medium {{of the upper}} atmosphere. Gain control system {{is one of the}} important parts of a <b>short-wave</b> radio <b>receiver.</b> Frequently the received signal has a wide dynamic range. A conventional approach for this problem consists of using an automatic gain control. In that case the receiver's gain is automatically adjusted to maintain a constant level using averaging filters with different time constants. It is enough in most communication tasks. Solving tasks of radio waves propagation or ionospheric parameters investigation, it is necessary to predict mean level of radio signal absolute value of the received signal. In this case an adaptive gain control system can be useful. We proposed the method of developing self-learning gain control system. Self-learning neural network is used to estimate mean value of the signal amplitude. Input vector of the neural network consists of previous samples of the signal, the network output is estimated gain level for next several samples. Since <b>short-wave</b> radio <b>receiver</b> is a self-contained device, the self-learning gain control system based on the neural network was realized on programming logi...|$|R
50|$|The first AFRS {{stations}} established {{under the}} Central Pacific Command {{were set up}} on the Tarawa Atoll and islet of Makin, both located in the Gilbert Islands, in November 1943. Three more stations, on Kwajalein and Eniwetok in the Marshall Islands and one on Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands, went on the air in February 1944. Teams of military broadcast specialists were trained at AFRS' headquarters in Los Angeles to operate radio stations. Later, they traveled to Hawaii, where they picked up equipment and briefed on their assignment and local conditions, and then proceeded to their posts by whatever means they were able to travel. Some of the teams carried complete radio transmitting equipment: 50-watt transmitters, turntables, a tiny mixing console and several boxes of records. A few teams were provided with <b>short-wave</b> <b>receivers</b> so they could monitor AFRS newscasts from San Francisco. Each team usually consisted of an officer and five or six enlisted men. Upon reaching its destination, a team operated by whatever means they could. Electrical generators were often hard to acquire, and a station often had to provide its own independent power source. In the Central Pacific, once a station had been set up and broadcasting, locally based servicemen were trained to operate the outlet. Usually, after the team was sure that the station could be run by the local GIs, they returned to Honolulu for reassignment to another location. This connected conglomerate of military stations became known as the Pacific Ocean Network (PON).|$|R

5000|$|Kurzwellen {{is one of}} {{a series}} of works dating from the 1960s which Stockhausen {{designated}} as [...] "process" [...] compositions. These works in effect separate the [...] "form" [...] from the [...] "content" [...] by presenting the performers with a series of transformation signs which are to be applied to material that may vary considerably from one performance to the next. In Kurzwellen and three subsequent works (Spiral for a soloist, Pole for two, and Expo for three), this material is to be drawn spontaneously during the performance from short-wave radio broadcasts [...] While this separate treatment of the genetic rules for development had existed in Stockhausen's earlier compositions, the emphasis on the process of transformation and less specificity of what is to be transformed is taken further than ever before in Kurzwellen [...] The overall formal process is therefore fixed, whereas the sound materials are extremely variable [...] The processes, indicated primarily by plus, minus, and equal signs, constitute the composition and, despite the unpredictability of the materials, these processes can be heard from one performance to another as being [...] "the same" [...] While the use of radios in concert works dates back at least to 1942 with John Cage's Credo in Us, and Stockhausen may well have gotten the idea of using radios from Cage, their approaches could not have been more different. For Cage, the type of radio is a matter of indifference, since their purpose is merely to fill in prescribed time units with any sort of sound at all. Stockhausen, on the other hand, prescribed <b>short-wave</b> <b>receivers</b> because of their capability of bringing in broadcasts from far away, and for the rich variety of available sounds. These sounds are also not used indiscriminately: the performers are to search for and select only materials suitable for improvisational transformations [...]|$|R

Within Paris, opposition was isolated and slow to build. On August 2, de Gaulle was condemned to death for treason, in absentia, by Marshal Pétain's new government. [...] The first illegal demonstration in Paris against the Occupation took place on November 11, 1940, {{the anniversary of the}} end of the First World War, a day that usually featured patriotic ceremonies of remembrance. Anticipating trouble, the German authorities banned any commemoration and made it a regular school and work day. Nonetheless the students of Paris lycées (high schools) circulated handbills and leaflets calling for students to boycott classes and meet at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier beneath the Arc de Triomphe. The event was also announced on the 10th on the BBC. The day began quietly, as some 20,000 students laid wreaths and bouquets at the tomb and at the statue of Georges Clemenceau, on Place Clemenceau, by the Champs Élysées. This part of the day was tolerated by the French and German authorities. At midday, the demonstration became more provocative; some students carried a floral Cross of Lorraine, the symbol of de Gaulle's Free France. They were chased away by the police. At nightfall, the event became more provocative; some three thousand students gathered, chanting [...] "Vive La France" [...] and [...] "Vive l'Angleterre", and invading Le Tyrol, a bar popular with the Jeune Front, a fascist youth group, and scuffling with police. At 6:00 p.m., German soldiers arrived, surrounded the students, and closed the entrance of the metro stations. They charged the students with fixed bayonets, firing shots in the air. The Vichy government announced 123 arrests and one student wounded. The students arrested were taken to the prisons of La Santé, Cherche-Midi and Fresnes, where they were beaten, slapped, stripped, and made to stand all night in the pouring rain. Some students were threatened by soldiers pretending to be a firing squad. As a consequence of the demonstration, the Sorbonne University was closed, students were required to regularly report to the police, and the Latin Quarter was closely watched.|$|R
