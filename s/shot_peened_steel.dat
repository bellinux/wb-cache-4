5000|$|In the mid-1960s, Chrysler {{decided to}} adapt the 318 cu.in. small block V8 into a lightweight, high output engine equally suited for drag strip or street {{performance}} use. Its block was bored out to 4.04 in but 3.31 in stroke left unchanged, resulting in the 340 cu in (5.6 L). Anticipating higher loads resulting from racing operation, the engineers fitted a forged <b>shot</b> <b>peened</b> <b>steel</b> crankshaft instead of the cast nodular iron unit used in the 318. This also included shot peened and forged pushrods, connecting rods and pistons. A 4-barrel carburetor was mated to a high-rise, dual plane intake manifold feeding high-flow cylinder heads that are still considered among the best of that era. Its big ports used 2.02 in intake and 1.60 in exhaust valves. An aggressive cam was fitted {{to take advantage of}} the much better breathing top end. 1968 4-Speed cars got an even hotter cam, but it was discontinued for 1969, where both automatic and manual cars shared the same cam. The engine was equipped with hydraulic lifters and two bolt main bearing caps, leading some to initially underestimate the 340's potential. The '68-'71 340's compression ratio was 10.5:1, placing it near the limit of what was possible on pump gasoline during that era. The 340 also used additional heavy-duty parts, such as a double-row roller timing chain and sump-mounted windage tray. Power output was officially stated as [...] Gross for the 4 barrel.|$|E

In contrast to conventional methods using strain scanning here an alternative approach was chosen. Strain scanning experiments suffer {{from the fact that}} for through surface scanning experiments laborious corrections have to be applied in order to compensate the geometrical effects of the partly immersed gauge volume. Furthermore the lattice free strain parameters have to be known precisely for stress evaluation. In this project the experiments were carried out according to the well known sinψ-method of X-ray stress analysis [1]. The diffraction data were evaluated using the universal plot method [2, 3]. For the in-plane residual stress distribution of a <b>shot</b> <b>peened</b> <b>steel</b> the results clearly indicate that the chosen approach is practicable to determine the stress distribution non-destructively up to large depth by simply tilting the sample up to grazing incidence geometry. Within the project it became evident that an appropriate characterization of the neutron beam path is essential for the goodness of the evaluated residual stress data. By using a stress free annealed steel plate an optimal combination of the collimators in the primary and the diffracted beam path and the bending radius of the Si(004) -monochromator were established...|$|E

It is shown that masking gives rise to tensile surface residual stresses adjacent to the peened area. Peening of austenitic stainless steel produces surface martensite in amounts that depend upon the composition of the steel.

40|$|Nitriding and <b>shot</b> <b>peening</b> are surface {{treatments}} {{widely used}} to improve the fatigue strength of mechanical and structural components. Both treatments enhance the mechanical properties of the surface layer of material: nitriding mainly by means of chemical transformations and formation of a very hard case, <b>shot</b> <b>peening</b> mainly due to compressive residual stress field in the sub-surface layer of material. The combined application of nitriding and <b>shot</b> <b>peening</b> has not been adequately investigated in literature and the known data do not allow to define a general criterion to assess if and when <b>shot</b> <b>peening</b> application after nitriding can be useful. In this paper the effect of nitriding plus <b>shot</b> <b>peening</b> on fatigue strength of a low-alloy steel is investigated by means of experimental tests carried out on specimens containing a micro-hole, acting as a pre-crack. To analyse {{the role played by}} <b>shot</b> <b>peening</b> induced residual stresses, a series of specimens was heat-treated after <b>shot</b> <b>peening,</b> being the aim the partial removal of residual stresses without strongly modifying the mechanical properties of the surface layer of material. After a critical discussion of the results in terms of residual stress, micro-hardness trend and fatigue strength, an original fracture mechanics based approach is proposed to predict the threshold value of the stress intensity factor of nitrided and <b>shot</b> <b>peened</b> <b>steels.</b> The results are in good agreement with the experimental evidence...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Effects {{of surface}} defect {{size and the}} method used to obtain the defect itself on bending fatigue {{behaviour}} of nitrided and <b>shot</b> <b>peened</b> <b>steel</b> was studied. Two different series of 15 sandglass specimens with a microhole in the minimum section generated after nitriding and shot peening treatments were considered. In one series the microholes were obtained by controlled electro-erosion. In the other series microholes were obtained by indentation, much more invasive that electro-erosion, simulating a damage due to a mechanical impact or scratch on the surface material, common on real components during the life span. In both cases the microholes act as a pre-existent crack. The results show that defects obtained by indentation lead to a minor fatigue limit with respect of larger defects obtained by electro-erosion. This was interpreted as the modification of the residual stress field due to the mechanical indentation. On {{the basis of the}} results some consideration is formulated about generating micro-holes with one of the discussed ways...|$|E
40|$|Corrosion fatigue is {{a common}} failure {{mechanism}} in rock drilling components and many othermechanical parts subjected to cyclic loads in corrosive environments. A crucial part in the design ofsuch components resides {{in the selection of}} the right materials for the application, which ideallyinvolves testing and comparison of their performance under working conditions. The present work was performed with the purpose of designing a corrosion-fatigue testing methodthat would allow the designer to compare the performance of different materials exposed to corrosionfatigue, permitting also the comparison with results from dry fatigue testing. The method was designedfor rotating-bending machines. Two different steel grades were used during the work, one throughhardened and one case hardened. The effect of these heat treatments and of shot peening overcorrosion-fatigue behaviour were studied using the proposed method. It was proven that the testing speed has a strong impact on the fatigue life of steel. It was found that,at a fixed stress level, the case hardened and <b>shot</b> <b>peened</b> <b>steel</b> reached 3 X 10 ^ 6 cycles at 2300 rpm,while it failed at only 5 X 10 ^ 5 cycles with a testing speed of 500 rpm. A large beneficial influence of theshot peening was demonstrated. It was also observed that, at fixed testing speed, the shot peening onthe through hardened steel can increase its fatigue strength from 190 MPa to 600 MPa under corrosionfatigue. Many cracks were found at the surface of the shot peened parts, which are arrested near thesurface by the compressive stress layer from the shot peening. It was also found that, for the non-shotpeened parts, case hardening had a slightly higher corrosion-fatigue strength than the throughhardened. This might be a result of the compressive stresses from carburization, or due to the highercore toughness of this steel grade...|$|E
