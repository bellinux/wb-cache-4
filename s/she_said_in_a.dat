5|$|Kirchner had a rocky {{relationship}} with the United States. Several items from a US air force plane, such as drugs and GPS devices, were seized by Argentine officials, which caused a diplomatic crisis. US State Department spokesman Philip J. Crowley {{said that they were}} standard tools used in counter-terrorism tactics which were being taught to the Argentine police during the joint operation, and asked for the return of the seized materials. Kirchner blamed the whole country for the 2014 default, ruled by US judge Thomas P. Griesa. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cadena nacional ("national network") address that the US may be trying to oust her from power, or even assassinate her. She said this a few days after accusing the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant of similar assassination plans against her. The idea was rejected by opposition leader Elisa Carrió as a mere conspiracy theory.|$|E

[...] "I have stacks and stacks of letters from great directors saying I can't cast you because you don't mean anything to the studios. That's why I turned the boat toward comedy." ...|$|E

Winstead had not been involved in the hiring of Kilborn, and disagreed with him over what direction the show should take. [...] "I spent eight months developing and staffing a show and seeking a tone with producers and writers. Somebody else put him in place. There were bound to be problems. I viewed the show as content-driven; he viewed it as host-driven", <b>she</b> <b>said.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> 1997 Esquire magazine interview, Kilborn made a sexually explicit joke about Winstead. Comedy Central responded by suspending Kilborn without pay for one week, and Winstead quit soon after.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{constant}} media attention, Mukerji remains guarded {{about her}} personal life. Unlike many other celebrities, Mukerji limits her {{interactions with the}} media and is sometimes labelled a recluse; <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 2011 interview, [...] "Today actors have become more open with the media. But this has posed a problem for actors like me because if I don't do that, then I end up being called reclusive. So now I have changed myself and am easily approachable." [...] Mukerji has collaborated frequently and maintained a close friendship with actors Shah Rukh Khan and Aamir Khan, and filmmaker Karan Johar. The nature of Mukerji's relationship with filmmaker Aditya Chopra was the topic of fervent tabloid reporting in India, though she refused to publicly talk about it. On 21 April 2014, she married Chopra at a private ceremony in Italy. On 9 December 2015, {{she gave birth to}} their daughter, named Adira.|$|E

[...] In October 2017 a motion that she authored passed the board and resulted in Columbus Day being demoted as an official holiday in Los Angeles County and it being replaced with Indigenous Peoples Day. [...] <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> statement, [...] "This action is about publicly recognizing that America's ancestors, for centuries, oppressed certain minority groups. This is not about erasing history; I believe the full history and impact of Christopher Columbus should be taught to current and future generations. While we cannot change the past, we can realize the pain that millions suffered throughout our nation's history, as well as the tremendous achievements of the original inhabitants of our continent." ...|$|E

500|$|Dallas became {{involved}} in politics in the 1940s. [...] "My life {{in the outside world}} began after I was 40," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 1979 interview with The Philadelphia Inquirer.. In another interview that year, she said that she was not very interested in politics at the time; though she ran for city council in 1947 she only did so when mayoral candidate Richardson Dilworth assured her she would lose. [...] Democratic ward leaders asked her to run for City Council that year because, according to Dallas, [...] "they needed a woman and a Protestant, and they got two for one in me." [...] Dallas was one of two women the Democrats nominated that year. She was nominated in the 6th district which sent four members to City Council under the 1919 city charter. Her first campaign was unsuccessful; in those days, Republicans dominated the city's politics and in 1947 all four of their candidates for councilman in the 6th district were elected. Dallas placed sixth, second among the four Democrats nominated.|$|E
500|$|Gaven {{was born}} as Marcia Mitzman on February 28, 1959 in New York City, New York. She was raised {{with her two}} {{siblings}} {{in the village of}} Hastings-on-Hudson, New York by their mother Patricia Mitzman, who had previously had a career in art. Newt Mitzman, their father, directed [...] television specials and commercials for a living. Gaven went to Hackley Elementary School in Tarrytown, New York when she was young. At that time she was certain that she wanted to work in show business. As the result of a lie, she was able to study at the High School of Performing Arts even though the school was only open to inhabitants of New York City. She then became a drama major at the State University of New York at Purchase, though she did not get a degree. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 1987 interview with The New York Times that [...] "they kicked me out because I missed a major rehearsal", and she never applied for readmission since she had already made her first appearance on Broadway in Grease by then. While at Purchase, Gaven performed in student productions such as The Taming of the Shrew and Trumpets and Drums.|$|E
500|$|Michell {{attempted}} {{to be as}} faithful to the novel as possible, in particular avoiding what he felt was the polished, artificial feel of other period dramas set in the 19th-century. The director explained, [...] "I was desperately {{trying to make it}} feel like it could be happening in the next room. I tried to make it something which is absolutely about real people and not about dressing or hairstyles or carpet". Consequently, because he felt the realistic look of the age would make the film more dramatic, Michell chose to depict the actors without make-up, and disallowed them from looking too hygienic. Root commented about the film's natural look in an interview, [...] "I basically didn't wear any makeup , and my hair was obviously set in a very unflattering way... I suppose the lighting was quite harsh, as well. None of us looked good". <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> separate interview, [...] "I wanted to make Anne Elliot a somewhat plain woman who was not really miserable but had found a way to be content somehow, and yet emotions are buzzing around her all the time". Root believed the film's realistic depiction of the age was a key aspect of its appeal.|$|E

Love signed with Virgin Records to release it, and began recording it in France in 2003. America's Sweetheart {{was released in}} February 2004, and received mixed reviews from critics. Charles Aaron of Spin called it a [...] "jaw-dropping act of artistic will and a fiery, proper follow-up to 1994's Live Through This" [...] and awarded it eight out of ten stars, while The Village Voice said: [...] " [...] willing to act out the dream of every teenage brat who ever {{wanted to have a}} glamorous, high-profile hissyfit, and she turns those egocentric nervous breakdowns into art. Sure, the art becomes less compelling when you've been pulling the same stunts for a decade. But, honestly, is there anybody out there who fucks up better?" [...] The album sold less than 100,000 copies. Love has publicly expressed her regret over the record several times, reasoning that her drug issues at the time were to blame: [...] "America's Sweetheart was my one true piece of shit. It has no cohesive thread. I just hate it", <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 2014 interview.
