I think she met him in the late 1940s, through the bars of his jail cell in Jackson, Miss.—while visiting a cousin of hers who was on death row in the same jail.

40|$|Recent work on {{minority}} influence {{has led to}} a debate about whether majorities and minorities exercise different forms of influence. Nemeth (1986) has argued that consistent minorities induce different cognitive processes than do consistent majorities, with a resulting impact {{on the quality of the}} judgments rendered. Two experiments test his theory. In Experiment 1, <b>Ss</b> <b>heard</b> 3 tape-recorded lists of words and learned that either a minority or a majority differed in the category "first noticed. " This feedback occurred either once or over 3 trials. When exposure was once, recall was not affected by the source; when it was consistent, Ss exposed to the minority view recalled more words than those xposed to the majority view. In Experiment 2, Ss were exposed to a minority view that was either consistent over time or inconsistent over time. Ss exposed to a consistent minority had better recall than control Ss. Exposure to an inconsistent minority did not improve recall. The results offer support for the Nemeth (1986) formulation. For many years, research on social influence processes was dominated by the study of conformity.

40|$|Cytoplasmic ATP {{inhibits}} human erythrocyte glucose {{transport protein}} (GLUT 1) -mediated glucose transport in human {{red blood cells}} by reducing net glucose transport but not exchange glucose transport (Cloherty, E. K., D. L. Diamond, K. <b>S.</b> <b>Heard,</b> and A. Carruthers. 1996. Biochemistry. 35 : 13231 - 13239). We investigated the mechanism of ATP regulation of GLUT 1 by identifying GLUT 1 domains that undergo significant conformational change upon GLUT 1 -ATP interaction. ATP (but not GTP) protects GLUT 1 against tryptic digestion. Immunoblot analysis indicates that ATP protection extends across multiple GLUT 1 domains. Peptide-directed antibody binding to full-length GLUT 1 is reduced by ATP at two specific locations: exofacial loop 7 - 8 and the cytoplasmic C terminus. C-terminal antibody binding to wild-type GLUT 1 expressed in HEK cells is inhibited by ATP but binding of the same antibody to a GLUT 1 -GLUT 4 chimera in which loop 6 - 7 of GLUT 1 is substituted with loop 6 - 7 of GLUT 4 is unaffected. ATP reduces GLUT 1 lysine covalent modification by sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin by 40 %. AMP is without effect on lysine accessibility but antagonizes ATP inhibition of lysine modification. Tandem electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis indicates that ATP reduces covalent modification of lysine residues 245, 255, 256, and 477, whereas labeling at lysine residues 225, 229, and 230 is unchanged. Exogenous, intracellular GLUT 1 C-terminal peptide mimics ATP modulation of transport whereas C-terminal peptide-directed IgGs inhibit ATP modulation of glucose transport. These findings suggest that transport regulation involves ATP-dependent conformational changes in (or interactions between) the GLUT 1 C terminus and the C-terminal half of GLUT 1 cytoplasmic loop 6 - 7...|$|E

In 2004 the environmental issues ambush me. The song starts and ends in the dying world of trees and rivers. The poet’s words in both domains of justice are eerily prophetic.
