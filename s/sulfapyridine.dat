40|$|In {{an attempt}} to study in vivo the r 61 e of leukocytes in the {{curative}} action of sulfonamide drugs for infections, leukopenia was produced in rabbits by the administration of benzene.

Methods and Materials The experimental procedure consisted primarily of determining by daffy estimations the number of leukocytes in the circulating blood of rabbits receiving <b>sulfapyridine</b> simultaneously with injections of benzene, and also in other rabbits receiving benzene alone. The observations have been extended to include additional sets of animals, some of which received <b>sulfapyridine</b> alone, others received p-aminobenzoic acid together with benzene, and still others consisted of a normal untreated group. For comparative purposes, therefore, five groups of rabbits were employed, as follows: Group 1. Twenty-six rabbits received benzene alone.

Seven rabbits received <b>sulfapyridine</b> alone. Group 4. Six rabbits received p-aminobenzoic acid together with injections of benzene. Group 5. Eleven normal, untreated rabbits were also followed.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{mechanisms}} influencing the differences in attenuation of antibiotics between rivers. In this study, the natural attenuation of four antibiotics (azithromycin, clarithromycin, <b>sulfapyridine,</b> and sulfamethoxazole) during transport along the Thames River, UK, over a distance of 8. 3 km, and the Katsura River, Japan, over a distance of 7. 6 km was compared. To assist interpretation of the field data, the individual degradation and sorption characteristics of the antibiotics were estimated by laboratory experiments using surface water or sediment taken from the same rivers.

For sulfamethoxazole, the attenuation was limited in both rivers. Loss of <b>sulfapyridine</b> was attributed to both direct and indirect photolysis in the Thames River, but to only direct photolysis in the Katsura River.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Introduced in 1942, {{sulfasalazine}} (a conjugate of 5 -aminosalicylic acid (5 -ASA) and <b>sulfapyridine)</b> is {{the most}} prescribed medication used to treat "inflammatory" bowel disease (IBD.) Although controversial, there are increasingly compelling data that Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) may be an etiological agent in {{some or all of}} IBD. We have shown that two other agents used in the therapy of IBD (methotrexate and 6 -MP) profoundly inhibit MAP growth. We concluded that their most plausible mechanism of action is as antiMAP antibiotics. We herein hypothesize that the mechanism of action of 5 -ASA and/or <b>sulfapyridine</b> may also simply be to inhibit MAP growth. METHODOLOGY: The effect on MAP growth kinetics by sulfasalazine and its components were evaluated in bacterial culture of two strains each of MAP and M. avium, using a radiometric ((14) CO(2) BACTEC(R)) detection system that quantifies mycobacterial growth as arbitrary "growth index units" (GI). Efficacy data are presented as "percent decrease in cumulative GI" (%-DeltacGI). PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: There are disparate responses to 5 -ASA and <b>sulfapyridine</b> in the two subspecies. Against MAP, 5 -ASA is inhibitory in a dose-dependent manner (MAP ATCC 19698 46 %-DeltacGI at 64 microg/ml), whereas <b>sulfapyridine</b> has virtually no effect. In contrast, against M. avium ATCC 25291, 5 -ASA has no effect, whereas <b>sulfapyridine</b> (88 %-DeltacGI at 4 microg/ml) is as effective as methotrexate, our positive control (88 %-DeltacGI at 4 microg/ml). CONCLUSIONS: 5 -ASA inhibits MAP growth in culture. We posit that, unknowingly, the medical profession has been treating MAP infections since sulfasalazine's introduction in 1942. These observations may explain, in part, why MAP has not previously been identified as a human pathogen. We conclude that henceforth in clinical trials evaluating antiMAP agents in IBD, if considered ethical, the use of 5 -ASA (as well as methotrexate and 6 -MP) should be excluded from control groups...|$|E
