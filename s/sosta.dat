40|$|Air {{traffic demand}} has been {{increasing}} {{over the years and}} is still expected to grow. At airports where capacity is scarce, the current practice is to quantify it in terms of “slots” and is allocated, especially in Europe, following administrative procedures and best practices. The current slot allocation process is long, non optimised, and requires a large amount of communications among airspace users and slot coordinators. In this paper, we propose <b>SOSTA,</b> an integer linear programming model for optimisation of the slot allocation process on the European scale. In addition to applying all the regulations and best practices currently in use, <b>SOSTA</b> deals with all airports simultaneously, which may strongly increase the effectiveness of the early allocation phases. In an experimental analysis based on the real data of the busiest day in 2013 air traffic, we show the benefits of this simultaneous allocation, along with the capabilities of <b>SOSTA</b> and its extremely good computational performance...|$|E
40|$|Il contributo intende affrontare il tema del rapporto, spesso conflittuale, tra conservazione/riqualificazione della città storica e politiche della <b>sosta.</b> Tale relazione ha da sempre rivestito un ruolo determinante nella definizione delle politiche di intervento sulla città storica come testimonia l’ampio dibattito che nel corso del tempo ha visto confrontarsi gruppi portatori di interessi diversi e conflittuali a vario titolo coinvolti nella definizione e attuazione di politiche per la <b>sosta</b> nella città storica. In quest’ottica il contributo intende indagare e caratterizzare diversi approcci che nel tempo hanno caratterizzato l’implementazione di politiche per la <b>sosta</b> nelle città storiche fino agli anni Novanta. Successivamente, il contributo esamina le più recenti politiche per la <b>sosta</b> nelle città storiche cercando di evidenziarne le principali criticità e i principali punti di forza, approfondendo in particolare le politiche caratterizzate da approcci di tipo integrato. Tali politiche rivestono una particolare efficacia negli ambiti storici e determinano il passaggio dalla regolamentazione alla gestione della <b>sosta</b> sviluppando sinergie tra localizzazione delle attrezzature per la <b>sosta,</b> lo sviluppo della rete di trasporto pubblico, i disincentivi al trasporto automobilistico privato ai fini della conservazione e della riqualificazione della città storica. The paper {{focuses on}} the topic of the relationship, often conflict, between conservation/requalification of the {{historical}} city and parking policies. Such a relationship has always played a determining role in the definition of the requalification policies in the historical town, as noticed by the wide debate that, during the time, has been carried out by groups of various and conflicting stakeholders involved in the definition and implementation of parking policies in the historical city. Often with the generic term “parking” many heterogeneous types of parking are indicated, each of them requiring a different and appropriate approach, but in any case, the parking {{is the way in which}} private cars are used for the majority of the time. However, the incompatibility between private car traffic and historical centers is obvious. Not only for causes linked to the atmospheric pollution, traffic congestion and the consequent decrement of the life quality, but above all to the morphology of historical urban fabrics. These latter are grown having as reference not the car but the pedestrians and today they are, therefore, inadequate to support huge traffic flows. Basing on such considerations, the paper is aimed at deepening the different approaches that have characterized during the time the implementation of parking policies in the historical cities till the Nineties. Successively, a comprehensive review of the most recent parking policies in the historical cities is provided, trying to highlight their main strengths and weaknesses and deepening the integrate parking policies. These policies improve the development of synergies between the development of public transport network, the appropriate localization of the parking facilities, the disincentives to the private car transport and so on. In these experiences, parking management seems to be an effective and little expensive tool in order to orient the choice of the transports in urban areas. The positive impacts are high in the historical center, preventing the tourists and workers parking. In detail, the more recent experiences indicate as main criteria to follow for the parking policies in the historical town the avoiding of free, not restricted or with low pricing rates parking areas in sensible historical ambit since they increase the traffic flows. Parking areas, also for residents, near the street would be avoided if possible, since it creates difficulty to the traffic flows. Near attractive polarities it seems to be useful to realize parking for fast stops with progressive pricing rates to not encourage long time stops. Moreover, the participation of all the stakeholders is relevant for the implementation of parking management policies. Only satisfying such requirements the parking management can really stimulate the shift towards sustainable transport modalities, allowing a new use of the public urban historical space...|$|E

40|$|In {{the urban}} areas the {{mobility}} system is strategic for its working and it is composed {{of a series of}} territorial closely interrelated elements. Among these the parking {{is one of the most}} important and its organization is a key point of an appropriate planning of mobility: this importance is mainly due to its character of attractor of vehicular flows. The structure of large and medium sized Italian cities imposes many constraints to the creation and the use of parking areas for their impact on the urban livability; the problem is the organization of the whole city, the correct location of the areas and the opportunity to regulate the access to certain areas: in fact the programming of parking areas can have strong repercussions on the city. Another element can be considered: the choice to build parking areas in the center of the towns is in logical conflict with the traffic limiting policies, because the infrastructure, if built, can be used and the investment must be repaid; on the other hand, the decision that some sensitive areas should not be affected by parking infrastructure produces the necessity to strengthen other public services: the question is not only physical (space availability), but it is related with the distribution of opportunities and equipments, so if the center is better served by public transport, the periphery must be served by other infrastructures. As said, the choice of sites for parking&rsquo;s location and the determination of their operating characteristics can have strong impacts on the organization and the livability of the city itself; it follows the necessity of a close connection with the urban planning and an attention to the morphological characters of the different parts of the city. The tools for planning the mobility and, within it, the parking system, are several. The Urban Mobility Plan is the newest among them; it is a strategic tool because its effects are gathered on the system as a whole and it assumes an overall rationalization and development of networks and vehicles. The paper deepens the characters of this tool, starting from the legislative forecasts, and thereafter on the basis of case-studies. The first part analyses the notions connected with the urban structure, the mobility and the parking system. In the second step the prescriptive aspects are analyzed: the Urban Mobility Plan and the Urban Parking Program are deepen in relation with their main aspects and in relation whit the parking problems. The third part analyses two case-studies; the cases highlights the different application philosophy, in particular for the connection between urban areas and parking system. At least, in the fourth part, are analyzed techniques and tools for solving the parking&rsquo; problem, the different modalities for its organization and the management techniques aimed at encouraging more correct behaviors in relation to the different urban areas. Il sistema della mobilit&agrave; in area urbana &egrave; strategico per il funzionamento di qualunque citt&agrave;. Esso &egrave; composto da un sistema di parti e di funzioni interrelate strettamente con il territorio di riferimento; tra queste funzioni la <b>sosta</b> rappresenta un&rsquo;attivit&agrave; primaria e la sua organizzazione e pianificazione un punto nodale di una corretta pianificazione della mobilit&agrave;: questo a causa, principalmente, della sua caratteristica fondamentale, ossia l&rsquo;essere attrattore di flussi veicolari. La scelta dei siti dove localizzare le strutture per la <b>sosta</b> e la determinazione delle relative caratteristiche gestionali va effettuata con una particolare attenzione agli impatti sulla organizzazione e sulla vivibilit&agrave; della citt&agrave; stessa, il che si traduce in una stretta connessione con la pianificazione urbanistica e in una considerazione profonda dei caratteri morfologici delle diverse parti che compongono la citt&agrave;. Diversi sono gli strumenti di programmazione del sistema della mobilit&agrave; e, al suo interno, della <b>sosta.</b> Il Piano Urbano della Mobilit&agrave; &egrave; l&rsquo;ultimo nato tra questi ed &egrave; uno strumento prevalentemente strategico in quanto agisce sul sistema nel suo complesso ipotizzando una generale razionalizzazione ed evoluzione di reti e mezzi. L&rsquo;articolo approfondisce i caratteri di questo strumento, a partire dalle previsioni legislative ed in relazione a specifici casi applicativi. In particolare, la prima parte analizza i concetti che sono alla base delle relazioni tra citt&agrave;, mobilit&agrave; urbana e regolazione della <b>sosta.</b> Nella seconda parte si analizzano gli aspetti normativi, ossia il Piano Urbano della Mobilit&agrave;, anche in relazione ad uno strumento che lo ha preceduto e che era specificamente indirizzato alla programmazione delle infrastrutture per la <b>sosta,</b> il Programma Urbano dei Parcheggi. La terza parte analizza due casi di applicazione dello strumento, relativi alle citt&agrave; di Ferrara e Perugia con lo scopo di evidenziare le diverse opzioni che si aprono davanti al pianificatore nel momento in cui &egrave; necessario applicare lo strumento teorico ad una specifica realt&agrave; urbana. Infine, nella quarta parte, sono messe in evidenza alcune delle tecniche e degli strumenti utilizzabili per la risoluzione del problema della <b>sosta</b> in relazione ai tipi di <b>sosta,</b> alle diverse modalit&agrave; per la sua organizzazione e alle tecniche di gestione indirizzate a favorire comportamenti pi&ugrave; corretti in relazione ai diversi ambiti urbani...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Group-based {{social skills}} {{training}} (SST) has repeatedly been recommended as treatment of choice in high-functioning autism spectrum disorder (HFASD). To date, no sufficiently powered randomised controlled trial has been performed to establish efficacy and safety of SST {{in children and adolescents}} with HFASD. In this randomised, multi-centre, controlled trial with 220 children and adolescents with HFASD it is hypothesized, that add-on group-based SST using the 12 weeks manualised SOSTA–FRA program will result in improved social responsiveness (measured by the parent rated social responsiveness scale, SRS) compared to treatment as usual (TAU). It is further expected, that parent and self reported anxiety and depressive symptoms will decline and pro-social behaviour will increase in the treatment group. A neurophysiological study in the Frankfurt HFASD subgroup will be performed pre- and post treatment to assess changes in neural function induced by SST versus TAU. Methods/design The <b>SOSTA</b> – net trial is designed as a prospective, randomised, multi-centre, controlled trial with two parallel groups. The primary outcome is change in SRS score directly after the intervention and at 3 months follow-up. Several secondary outcome measures are also obtained. The target sample consists of 220 individuals with ASD, included at the six study centres. Discussion This study is currently one of the largest trials on SST in children and adolescents with HFASD worldwide. Compared to recent randomised controlled studies, our study shows several advantages with regard to in- and exclusion criteria, study methods, and the therapeutic approach chosen, which can be easily implemented in non-university-based clinical settings.

40|$|The {{formation}} {{and structure of}} the following Italian deverbal nouns is an open question in Italian word-formation research: (1 a) cammino, (1 b) ritegno, (1 c) riparto, (2 a) <b>sosta,</b> (2 b) classifica, (3 a) tema, (3 b) basta, (3 c) perquisa. While instances such as in (1) and (2) have, depending on the theoretical background, been analysed either as root conversion (cf. (1)) and conversion of the infinitival stem (cf. (2)) or as suffixation (cf. (1) and (2)), the spectrum of accounts for the instances in (3) includes, in addition, root conversion with analogical gender assignment (cf. (3 a) and (3 b)) as well as analogical backformation (cf. (3 c)). In the present contribution it is shown that the current conversion approaches as well as the suffixation approach are insufficient to explain the {{formation and}} structure of the nouns in (1) to (3). While the suffixation account is ruled out mainly for semantic and distributional reasons, it is shown thatthe existing conversionaccounts are, in principle, more plausible to account for the nouns in (1) and (2). However, as for the analogy-based conversion approaches, it is shown that only (3 c) is a proper analogy-driven formation. In contrast, type (3 b) will be shown to be an instance of root conversion remodelled by blocking. Moreover, in order to explain the formation {{and structure of the}} noun type instantiated by (3 a), an additionaltype of conversion has to be distinguished: (3 a) is shown – by the help of data from Old Italian– to be a synchronic remnant of an Old Italian conversion type: conversion of stem 2 of the Italian verbal stem space (terminology from Giraudo, Montermini e Pirrelli 2009), i. e. the stem on which also some Italian inflectional forms, as e. g. some of the present subjunctive forms are constructe...|$|E
