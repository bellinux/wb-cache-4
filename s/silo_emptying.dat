It {{is equipped with a}} flat bottom and it has a rectangular cross section. Moreover, it is entirely transparent for image processing purpose. First of all, a physical and mechanical characterization of wood granules (inert materials) was performed using a shear box testing. Then, <b>silo</b> <b>emptying</b> flows were generated. Flow regimes and flow rate were determined using spatiotemporal diagrams extracted from images of the free surface of the ensiled material. The same method was then used to measure the flow rate of discharging flows of soya, colza and rye seeds which were characterized in a previous study. For each material studied, the flow rate measured with this non intrusive method was successfully compared with a direct method consisting in weighing a volume of grains discharged during a unit time and with Berveloo's formula...|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} {{experimental}} study of segregation of granular matter in a quasi-two dimensional <b>silo</b> <b>emptying</b> out of an orifice. Size separation is observed when multi-sized particles are used with the larger particles found {{in the center of}} the silo in the region of fastest flow. We use imaging to study the flow inside the silo and quantitatively measure the concentration profiles of bi-disperse beads as a function of position and time. The angle of the surface is given by the angle of repose of the particles, and the flow occurs in a few layers only near the top of this inclined surface. The flowing region becomes deeper near the center of the silo and is confined to a parabolic region centered at the orifice which is approximately described by the kinematic model. The experimental evidence suggests that the segregation occurs on the surface and not in the flow deep inside the silo where velocity gradients also are present. We report the time development of the concentrations of the bi-disperse particles as a function of size ratios, flow rate, and the ratio of initial mixture. The qualitative aspects of the observed phenomena may be explained by a void filling model of segregation. Comment: 6 pages, 10 figures (gif format), postscript version at [URL]...|$|E

40|$|This {{report is}} the final part within my education, Industrial Engineering {{focusing}} on Industrial Logistics at Luleå University of Technology. The field of this thesis is route planning for sanding during winter season (which vehicle {{should be used for}} which road). The project has been accomplished in cooperation with Company C. The purpose of this thesis is to map the flow of sand from source to destination roads and also evaluate the different modes of transportation and vehicles for sanding. For every “go-around” an amount of 22, 3 ton sand is needed in the two areas that are studied within this report. In order to fulfill the purpose of the thesis the author has mapped the process of sand and evaluated different alternatives for distribution to terminals and for sanding the road network. In order to obtain a comparison of how different alternatives would affect the transportations and the costs, analysis with the load-distance method was made. According to Segerstedt (2009) the method of load-distance is very useful when finding the best location of a terminal. The analysis of the present situation and the results from the calculations shows potentials for great improvements of saving time when introducing truck for sanding instead of only tractors. Even cost for transportation will decrease with the combination of tractors and trucks because of the possibility for truck to collect the sand directly from Silo instead of different Terminals. As a recommendation Company C should try cooperate with the Purchaser about transportation of sand. It is possible to achieve a win-win situation if the routes can be changed a little bit. Suggestions in this report is to drive directly to terminal type 1 and 2 from source instead of drive to <b>silo</b> and <b>empty</b> the truck and then fill another truck that drives to terminals of type 1 and 2.

A total of 47 bags (23 alfalfa, 1 red clover, 23 whole−plant corn) were made, and losses were calculated on 39 of the silos. Dry matter (DM) density ranged from 160 to 270 kg/m 3. Dry matter density increased with DM content in hay crop silages on average 2. 9 kg/m 3 − % DM, whereas the effect in corn silage varied by bagging machine. Density decreased with increasing particle size at 4. 1 kg DM/m 3 per mm. The operator and the bagging machine setup both affected density. A wide range (0 % to 40 %) of DM losses was observed.

A solar chimney generates an upward draft of wind inside a tower and a shroud around the wind turbine. There are numerous <b>empty</b> <b>silos</b> on farms in the U.

The study is conducted through analytical/computational approach by employing the commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software. Computations are performed for five different geometric configurations consisting of a turbine, a cylindrical silo, and/or a venturi and/or a diffuser using the dimensions of typical silos and assuming Class 3 wind velocity. The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with the Boussinesq approximation and a two equation realizable k – ε model are employed in the calculations, and the turbine is modeled as an actuator disk. The power coefficient (Cp) and generated power are calculated for the five cases. Consistent with recent literature, it was found that the silos with diffusers increase the Cp beyond Betz’s limit significantly and thus the generated power. It should be noted that Cp is calculated by normalizing it by the turbine area swept by the wind.

40|$|During a {{storm in}} October 2002, wind induced ovalling {{vibrations}} were observed on several <b>empty</b> <b>silos</b> of a closely spaced group consisting of 8 by 5 silos {{in the port}} of Antwerp (Belgium). First, {{a thorough understanding of}} the fluid flow around the group is required to clarify the underlying mechanisms for the vibration. Since the configuration and orientation of the group drastically change the pressure distribution on the silos of the group, the flow regime around and within the silo group has been simulated for 7 angles of incidence between 0 and 90, leaving other parameters unchanged (e. g. spacing ratio, Reynolds number, [...] .). The flow regime shows similarities with the flow within tube arrays (e. g. heat exchangers) and the flow around rectangular cylinders. By a ‘one way coupling’ of static (time averaged) and dynamic (fluctuating) pressure loadings on the cylinder surfaces it is examined if the excitation of ovalling vibrations in the silo group is possible. Two probable causes of observable silo vibrations in the group are observed. The first, as a result of large static wind pressures and fluctuating drag and lift coefficients, might lead to rigid body motions of the statically deformed silos. The second, due to higher dynamic pressure oscillations, can excite ovalling oscillations in the third and fourth eigenmodes at the lee side of the group, corresponding with the lowest eigenfrequencies of the silos and the visually detected vibrations in 2002. Although it is shown by this ‘one way coupling’ that ovalling vibrations can be excited in the group, more advanced ‘two way coupled’ fluid-structure interaction simulations are required to determine the underlying mechanism inducing these aeroelastic deformations...|$|R
40|$|The Material Point Method (MPM) {{has been}} {{developed}} as a special finite element-based method for large deformation analysis, material flow and contact problems. When it comes to applications in soil, MPM can provide solutions where conventional FEM faces its limitations. Examples of geotechnical applications include landslides, <b>silo</b> filling and <b>emptying,</b> soil pushing and shoveling, as well as structure-soil penetration and installation problems (piles, anchors). In offshore geotechnics one can find several applications of the latter type where an MPM analysis can provide significant added value, such as for monopile penetration, (suction) anchor installation, spud can punch-through and trenching for pipelines and cables. In order to use MPM {{on a daily basis}} in practical applications, several numerical difficulties had to be overcome, such as inaccuracies, (numerical) instability, irregularities in strain and stress, contact formulation, boundary determination (applying boundary conditions), and last but not least, dealing with the required computing power. The latter is relevant, since MPM calculations are far more demanding than FEM calculations with a similar calculation grid. In this paper we highlight important numerical solutions that we have implemented for a practical use of MPM in geotechnical applications. Examples are the use of high-order elements and the Dual Domain Material Point method (DDMP) to smoothen strains and stresses, the use of an implicit integration scheme to stabilize calculations, the use of an augmented Lagrangian formulation to enhance the contact algorithm, and the use of dynamics and inertia to deal with local soil failure.

To clarify the cause and location of these wind induced vibrations, the spatial distribution of the aerodynamic pressures on the silo surfaces is determined in both 2 D and 3 D CFD (computational fluid dynamics) simulations of the highly turbulent wind flow around the silo group. The influence of the angle of incidence of the wind flow on the dynamic wind pressures is investigated by performing 2 D URANS (unsteady Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes) simulations. Linking of the aerodynamic pressures to dynamic properties of the silos reveals strong narrow band frequency peaks in the turbulent pressure coefficient spectra of the silos near the lee side corners {{of the group that}} match the structural natural frequencies of the observed ovalling modes. The importance of 3 D wake effects on the spatial distribution of aerodynamic pressures along the height of the silos is investigated with 3 D DDES (delayed detached eddy simulations). An important issue in the 3 D simulations is the application of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) at the inlet of the domain. The aerodynamic pressures on the silo surfaces are first investigated using the same procedure as for the 2 D results and afterwards by performing one way coupling calculations; i. e. by applying the 3 D aerodynamic pressures as transient external loads on a 3 D finite element model of the silos. Determination of modal kinetic and deformation energy of the structural response shows that even for a single silo in ABL flow the ovalling mode shapes with 3 and 4 circumferential wavelengths are dynamically excited, corresponding with the observed ovalling vibrations during the storm in 2002...|$|R
