5|$|Design of the PanzerI {{began in}} 1932 and mass {{production}} began in 1934. Intended {{only as a}} training tank to introduce the concept of armored warfare to the German Army, the PanzerI saw combat in Spain during the Spanish Civil War, in Poland, France, the Soviet Union and North Africa during the Second World War, and in China during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Experiences with the PanzerI during the Spanish Civil War helped shape the German Panzerwaffes' invasion of Poland in 1939 and France in 1940. By 1941, the PanzerI chassis design {{was used as the}} basis of tank destroyers and assault guns. There were attempts to upgrade the PanzerI throughout its <b>service</b> <b>history,</b> including by foreign nations, to extend the design's lifespan. It continued to serve in the Spanish Armed Forces until 1954.|$|E
5|$|On November 1, 2011, LOT Polish Airlines Flight 16, a 767-300ER, safely {{landed at}} Warsaw Frederic Chopin Airport in Warsaw, Poland after a {{mechanical}} {{failure of the}} landing gear forced an emergency landing with the landing gear up. There were no injuries, but the aircraft involved was damaged and subsequently written off. At {{the time of the}} incident, aviation analysts speculated that {{it may have been the}} first instance of a complete landing gear failure in the 767's <b>service</b> <b>history.</b> Subsequent investigation determined that while a damaged hose had disabled the aircraft's primary landing gear extension system, an otherwise functional backup system was inoperative due to an accidentally deactivated circuit breaker.|$|E

5|$|The advance {{continued}} {{throughout the}} month and by 29 April, No. 3 Commando crossed the Elbe {{and carried out}} an attack on Launenberg. No. 6 Commando led the assault, with Brigade Headquarters and No. 3 Commando following shortly behind them and established themselves on the high ground, before being clearing operations in Launenberg itself. By {{the end of the}} month all German opposition in the area had ceased and it marked the end of No. 3 Commando's offensive operations. On 7 May, when the Germans surrendered, No. 3 Commando was firmly established in Lübeck, where they began the next phase of their <b>service</b> <b>history</b> as occupation troops.|$|E
5|$|Because most of {{the newly}} formed {{regiment}} surrendered to British and German forces at the Battle of Fort Washington on November 16, 1776, the <b>service</b> <b>history</b> of the unit's surviving element is complex. Although modern and contemporaneous accounts of the battle convey the impression that it {{marked the end of}} the regiment as a combat entity, {{a significant portion of the}} unit continued to serve actively in the Continental Army throughout {{most of the}} remainder of the war. Elements of the regiment served with George Washington's Main Army and participated in the army's major engagements of late 1776 through 1778. Select members of the regiment were also attached to Col. Daniel Morgan's elite Provisional Rifle Corps at its inception in mid-1777. The Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment was reorganized in January 1779 and was stationed at Fort Pitt, headquarters of the Continental Army's Western Department, in present-day western Pennsylvania primarily to help in the defense of frontier settlements from raids by British-allied Indian tribes. The unit was disbanded with all other Additional and Extra Continental regiments during the reorganization of the Continental Army in January 1781. It was the longest serving Continental Army rifle unit of the war.|$|E
5|$|Typically {{operated}} {{from small}} aircraft carriers, large amphibious assault ships and simple forward operating bases, AV-8Bs {{have participated in}} numerous military and humanitarian operations, proving themselves versatile assets. U.S. Army General Norman Schwarzkopf named the USMC Harrier II as one of several important weapons in the Gulf War. The aircraft took part in combat during the Iraq War beginning in 2003. The Harrier II has served in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan since 2001, and was used in Operation Odyssey Dawn in Libya in 2011. Italian and Spanish Harrier IIs have taken part in overseas conflicts in conjunction with NATO coalitions. During its <b>service</b> <b>history,</b> the AV-8B has had a high accident rate, related to the percentage {{of time spent in}} critical take-off and landing phases. USMC and Italian Navy AV-8Bs are to be replaced by the Lockheed Martin F-35B Lightning II, with the former expected to operate its Harriers until 2025.|$|E

25|$|The first {{production}} P-36As {{were delivered}} to the 20th Pursuit Group at Barksdale Field in Louisiana in April 1938. The aircraft's <b>service</b> <b>history</b> was marred by numerous teething problems with the engine exhaust, skin buckling over landing gear, and weak points in the airframe, severely restricting the performance envelope. By the time these issues were resolved, the P-36 was considered obsolete and was relegated to training units and overseas detachments at Albrook Field in the Panama Canal Zone, Elmendorf Field in Alaska, and Wheeler Field in Hawaii.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{little is}} known about the G.I's <b>service</b> <b>history.</b> Idflieg records show only small numbers ever in service on the front at any one time (the most being five in October and six in December 1915).

25|$|By 1867, after barely 2½ {{years of}} service from the class, the Revenue Cutter Service decided to divest itself {{of most of the}} Pawtuxets as their engines were deemed too complicated.

The first three of the above-named vessels all subsequently sailed to Japan, apparently in merchant service. Kewanee, renamed Musashi, became involved in the war between the Japanese Emperor Kōmei and the Tokugawa Shogunate, and exploded off Yokohama in 1869. Ashuelot, as Takao, was destroyed the same year, while Kankakee, renamed Kawachi, was broken up after 1868.
