25|$|Family-based {{treatment}} (FBT) {{has been}} shown to be more successful than individual therapy for adolescents with AN. Various forms of family-based treatment have been proven to work in the treatment of adolescent AN including conjoint family therapy (CFT), in which the parents and child are seen together by the same therapist, and <b>separated</b> <b>family</b> therapy (SFT) in which the parents and child attend therapy separately with different therapists. Proponents of Family therapy for adolescents with AN assert that it is important to include parents in the adolescent's treatment.|$|E
2500|$|Monroe {{sold his}} small {{inherited}} Virginia plantation in 1783 to enter law and politics. He later fulfilled his youthful {{dream of becoming}} {{the owner of a}} large plantation and wielding great political power, but his plantation was never profitable. Although he owned much more land and many more slaves, and speculated in property, he was rarely on-site to oversee the operations. Overseers treated the slaves harshly to force production, but the plantations barely broke even. Monroe incurred debts by his lavish and expensive lifestyle and often sold property (including slaves) to pay them off. Overseers moved or separated slave families from different Monroe plantations in accordance with production and maintenance needs of each satellite plantation. One of Monroe's slaves named Daniel often ran away from his plantation in Albermarle County, to visit other slaves or <b>separated</b> <b>family</b> members. Monroe commonly referred to Daniel as a [...] "scoundrel" [...] and described the [...] "worthlessness" [...] of Daniel as a runaway slave. The practice of moving and separating slave families was common treatment of slaves in the South.|$|E

50|$|Colonialism and {{apartheid}} had a {{major impact}} on black and coloured women, since they suffered both racial and gender discrimination. Jobs were often hard to find. Many black and coloured women worked as agricultural or domestic workers, but wages were extremely low, if existent. Children suffered from diseases caused by malnutrition and sanitation problems, and mortality rates were therefore high. The controlled movement of black and coloured workers within the country through the Natives Urban Areas Act of 1923 and the pass laws <b>separated</b> <b>family</b> members from one another, because men could prove their employment in urban centres while most women were merely dependents; consequently, they risked being deported to rural areas.|$|E
