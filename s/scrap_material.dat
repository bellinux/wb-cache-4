25|$|The MNR quickly {{returned}} {{the station to}} use, as a visitor centre rather than an operational railway museum. Over the next year, the MNR spent £28,000 restoring the station buildings to wartime LNER condition, tidying the grounds and removing <b>scrap</b> <b>material</b> left by the former lessee. With additional investment, the station drive, damaged after decades of neglect, was professionally resurfaced, scrub growth {{was removed from the}} railway formation opening up the views of the Wensum Valley for walkers, and formation for the restoration of track was prepared. In 2010 it was repainted into MNR house colours.|$|E
500|$|From September 1947 to April 1969 {{there were}} 5 or more {{accidental}} surface water releases of tritium. [...] Tritium, a radioactive element which {{was found in}} <b>scrap</b> <b>material</b> from Rocky Flats, was therefore directed in to the Great Western Reservoir. [...] This was uncovered in 1973 and following this, urine samples were taken from people living or working near Broomfield who could have drank water from the reservoir. [...] The findings of the samples showed that those {{who were exposed to}} contaminated water had tritium concentrations near seven times higher than normal (4,300 picocuries per liter versus 600 picocuries per liter). [...] However, when the same group underwent urine sampling three years later, their tritium concentrations had returned to the standard.|$|E

500|$|The long-stemmed, blackish-brown or blackish-purple, barely {{translucent}} sporangia of Barbeyella are spherical, 0.15 to 0.2mm {{in diameter}} and together with the stem measure 0.3 to 0.7mm long. They are usually scattered on the substrate, but also often grouped in loose, large colonies. The hypothallus (the tissue upon which the sporangiophore rests) [...] has a diameter of at least 0.7mm. Although not visible on mosses, it has a reddish-brown color when growing on wood. The brownish-black stem is up to 0.1mm thick, thinning to 5µm towards the top and is filled with protoplasmatic <b>scrap</b> <b>material.</b> The columella – arising from the stem tip – matures at the upper end at roughly half {{the height of the}} sporangiophore into 7 to 13 simple or occasionally bifurcated, 1 to 4µm large, dark-brown capillitium strands. Usually individual, occasionally in pairs, these are firmly fused with the lobed segments of the peridium, which are round in cross-section. When the spores mature, the sporangium splits and empties into the peridium towards the base. This prevents the lobes of the peridium from detaching and provides spore dispersal over a longer period, similar to a dehiscing capsule. The sporangia are filled towards the top with plasmatic granules, which diminish increasingly towards the base. Depending {{on the size of the}} plasmatic granules, the sporangia appear [...] or smooth.|$|E
2500|$|Plaster mold casting is {{used when}} an {{excellent}} surface finish and good dimensional accuracy is required.

2500|$|Improvised {{firearms}} {{are most}} commonly encountered in regions with restrictive gun control laws. While {{popular in the}} United States in the 1950s, the [...] "zip gun" [...] has become less common because of the greater ease of obtaining firearms. In India, use of improvised country-made pistols is widespread, especially in the regions of Bihar and Purvanchal. The manufacture of these weapons has become a cottage industry, and the components are often manufactured from <b>scrap</b> <b>material,</b> such as gun barrels fashioned from truck steering wheels. In areas like South Africa, improvised firearms are more common. In a study of Zululand District Municipality, South Africa, {{it was found that}} most improvised firearms were crude, 12-gauge shotguns, with a simple pull and release firing mechanism; like the [...]22 rimfire cartridges shotgun shells also operate at low pressures, making them more suited for use in weak, improvised barrels. Even in the absence of ammunition, homemade powder can be used; such firearms were the subject of a crackdown in the People's Republic of China in 2008.|$|E

40|$|Increased use of {{secondary}} raw materials in metal production offers several benefits including reduced cost and lowered energy burden. The lower cost {{of secondary}} or <b>scrap</b> <b>materials</b> {{is accompanied by}} an increased uncertainty in elemental composition. This increased uncertainty for different scraps, if not managed well, results in an increased risk that the elemental concentrations in the final products fall outside customer specifications. Previous results show that incorporating this uncertainty explicitly into batch planning can modify the potential use of <b>scrap</b> <b>materials</b> while managing risk. Chance-constrained formulations provide one approach to uncertainty-aware batch planning; however, typical formulations assume normal distributions to represent the compositional uncertainty of the materials. Compositional variation in <b>scrap</b> <b>materials</b> {{has been shown to}} have a skewed distribution, and therefore, the performance of these models, in terms of their ability to provide effective planning, it may then be heavily influenced by the structure of the compositional data used. To address this issue, this work developed several approximations for skewed distributional forms within chance-constrained formulations. We explored a lognormal approximation based on Fenton’s method; a convex approximation based on Bernstein inequalities; and a linear approximation using fuzzy set theory. Each of these methods was formulated and case studies executed using compositional data from an aluminum remelter. Results indicate that the relationship between the underlying structure/distribution of the compositional data and how these distributions are formulated in batch planning can modify the use of secondary raw materials.
