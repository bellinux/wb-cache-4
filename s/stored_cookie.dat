50|$|When Microsoft {{designed}} Internet Explorer, the programmers made {{an explicit}} decision to <b>store</b> <b>cookies</b> and favorites as tiny individual files {{less than a}} kilobyte each, rather than storing this data as a single large consolidated file. Microsoft also stores shortcut files in the Recent profile folder, linking to recently opened files and folders.|$|R

2500|$|Evercookies, {{created by}} Samy Kamkar, are JavaScript-based {{applications}} which produce cookies {{in a web}} browser that actively [...] "resist" [...] deletion by redundantly copying themselves in different forms on the user's machine (e.g., Flash Local Shared Objects, various HTML5 storage mechanisms, window.name caching, etc.), and resurrecting copies that are missing or expired. Evercookie accomplishes this by <b>storing</b> the <b>cookie</b> data in several types of storage mechanisms that {{are available on the}} local browser. It has the ability to <b>store</b> <b>cookies</b> in over ten types of storage mechanisms so that once they are on one's computer they will never be gone. Additionally, if evercookie has found the user has removed any of the types of cookies in question, it recreates them using each mechanism available. Evercookies are one type of zombie cookie. [...] However, modern browsers and anti-malware software can now block or detect and remove such cookies.|$|R

25|$|Some users {{choose to}} disable cookies in their web browsers. Such an action can reduce some privacy risks, but may {{severely}} limit or prevent the functionality of many websites. All significant web browsers have this disabling ability built-in, with no external program required. As an alternative, users may frequently delete any <b>stored</b> <b>cookies.</b> Some browsers (such as Mozilla Firefox and Opera) offer {{the option to}} clear cookies automatically whenever the user closes the browser. A third option involves allowing cookies in general, but preventing their abuse. There are also a host of wrapper applications that will redirect cookies and cache data to some other location. Concerns exist that the privacy benefits of deleting cookies have been over-stated.|$|R

Some of LG's {{in-house}} applications have enhanced landscape modes intended {{to complement the}} 2:1 display; the camera app features shooting modes designed for use with square, 1:1 aspect ratio photos, and can display a camera roll sidebar when taking traditional 4:3 photos. The screen size also complements Android Nougat's native split-screen mode for running multiple apps at once.

50|$|On the World Wide Web, the {{internet}} footprint; {{also known as}} cyber shadow, electronic footprint, or digital shadow, is the information left behind {{as a result of}} a user's web-browsing and <b>stored</b> as <b>cookies.</b> The term usually applies to an individual person, but can also refer to a business, organization and corporation.|$|R

5000|$|Cookies are set {{using the}} [...] HTTP header, sent in an HTTP {{response}} from the web server. This header instructs the web browser to <b>store</b> the <b>cookie</b> and send it back in future requests to the server (the browser will, of course, ignore this header {{if it does not}} support cookies or has disabled cookies).|$|R
50|$|A zombie cookie is {{a cookie}} that is {{automatically}} recreated after being deleted. This {{is accomplished by}} <b>storing</b> the <b>cookie's</b> content in multiple locations, such as Flash Local shared object, HTML5 Web storage, and other client-side and even server-side locations. When the cookie's absence is detected, the cookie is recreated using the data stored in these locations.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to transmitting {{information to a}} Google server, the tracking code sets a first party cookie (If cookies are enabled in the browser) on each visitor's computer. This <b>cookie</b> <b>stores</b> anonymous information, called the ClientId. Before the launch of Universal Analytics, there were several <b>cookies</b> <b>storing</b> information such as whether the visitor {{had been to the}} site before (new or returning visitor), the timestamp of the current visit, and the referrer site or campaign that directed the visitor to the page (e.g., search engine, keywords, banner, or email).|$|R
5000|$|The {{tracking}} cookies, {{and especially}} third-party tracking cookies, {{are commonly used}} as ways to compile long-term records of individuals' browsing histories [...] a potential privacy concern that prompted European and U.S. lawmakers to take action in 2011.

50|$|In many cases, it is {{impractical}} {{to track}} all the sales generated by an advertisement. However, {{it is more}} easily tracked for full online transactions such as selling songs directly on the internet.

40|$|Now a days, {{internet}} {{marketing is}} on peak. Most {{of the companies}} use internet for marketing and advertisements of their business. For tracking visitors, <b>cookies</b> are <b>stored</b> in their browser by these company websites. But what, if visitor deleted the <b>cookies</b> <b>stored?</b> So it is really difficult to maintain a 100 % correct record of visitors. So {{a new type of}} cookie is created which is really difficult to delete. The main purpose of this is to identify a returning visitor even if he/she has tried to delete the <b>cookies</b> <b>stored</b> in the browser. Samy Kamkar created a java script API for creating persistent cookies. This API is called evercookie...|$|R
50|$|Cookie jars are {{utilitarian}} or decorative ceramic {{or glass}} jars {{often found in}} American and Canadian kitchens. In the United Kingdom, they are known as biscuit barrels or biscuit jars. If they are cans made out of tinplate, they are called biscuit tins.
