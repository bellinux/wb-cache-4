5|$|When {{designing}} the characters, Nomura had wanted {{at least one}} female character to wear a <b>skirt.</b> Quistis was originally supposed to fill this part, but Nomura decided a long <b>skirt</b> worn over pants would look better. The role was eventually passed to Selphie. Nomura was surprised when the writers cast her as a teacher, despite being around {{the same age as}} the rest of the group.|$|E
5|$|Commercial artist Russell H. Tandy was {{the first}} artist to {{illustrate}} Nancy Drew. Tandy was a fashion artist and infused Nancy with a contemporary fashion sensibility: her early style {{is that of a}} flatfoot flapper: heeled Mary Janes accompany her blue flapper <b>skirt</b> suit and cloche hat on three of the first four volume dust jackets. As styles changed over the next few years, Nancy began to appear in glamorous frocks, with immaculately set hair, pearls, matching hats, gloves, and handbags. By the 1940s, Nancy wore simpler, tailored suits and outfits; her hair was often arranged in a pompadour. In the post-war era, Tandy's Nancy is shown hatless, wearing casual <b>skirt</b> and blouse ensembles, and carrying a purse, like most teens of the late 1940s.|$|E

5|$|A {{thorough}} technical investigation {{including a}} pigment analysis of Las Meninas was conducted around 1981 in Museo Prado. The analysis revealed the usual pigments of the baroque period frequently used by Velázquez {{in his other}} paintings.

5|$|Beginning with Tandy in 1948 and {{continuing}} {{into the early}} 1950s, Nancy's appearance was updated to follow the current styles. In postwar opulence, a trend emerged for young adults {{to have their own}} casual style, instead of dressing in the same styles as more mature adults, and Nancy becomes less constrained. Sweater or blouse and <b>skirt</b> ensembles, as well as a pageboy hairstyle, were introduced in 1948, and continued with new artist Bill Gillies, who updated 10 covers and illustrated three new jackets from 1950 to 1952. Gillies used his wife for a model, and Nancy reflects the conservative 1950s, with immaculately waved hair and a limited wardrobe– she wears similar sweater, blouse, and <b>skirt</b> ensembles, in different combinations, on most of these covers. Gillies also designed the modern-era trademark as a spine symbol which was used for decades: Nancy's head in profile, looking through a quizzing glass.|$|E
5000|$|At their shortest, the <b>skirts</b> could measure {{six inches}} off the ground, which {{was seen as a}} bold {{statement}} of independence on the part of its wearers.

5|$|Hurricane Dean {{was very}} {{difficult}} to forecast in its early stages as the storm approached the eastern Caribbean. Even though most forecast models predicted that Dean would <b>skirt</b> the Leeward Islands, the track prediction models were not consistent and, as a result, uncertainty existed in justifying the posting of watches and warnings for the Leeward Islands and Puerto Rico. One track predicted Dean to threaten South Florida within three to fourdays.|$|E

5|$|Altar 13 {{is another}} early Maya {{monument}} {{dating to the}} Late Preclassic. Like Altar12 it was probably originally erected as a vertical stela.

At a later date it was reused as a horizontal altar. The remains of two figures can be seen flanking the damage lower portion of the monument and the large head of the sacred bird survives above the area of damage. The right hand figure is wearing an interwoven <b>skirt</b> and is probably female.|$|E
40|$|In {{the article}} weaves and colours of Lithuanian folk <b>skirts</b> fabrics are analysed. The {{investigation}} objects are the <b>skirts</b> from funds of three Lithuanian Museums: 258 <b>skirts</b> from National M.  K.  Čiurlionis Museum of Art, 85 <b>skirts</b> from Lithuanian Open Air Museum and 16 <b>skirts</b> from A. and A.  Tamošaitis gallery “Židinys”. Distribution of <b>skirts</b> fabrics according to weaves was estimated, and it shows, that fabrics of plain weave are most widespread (53  %), combined and twill weaves {{are less popular}} (19  % and 18  %, respectively). The weaves of fabrics are determined during investigation and plans of weave were made proposing recommendations for manufacturing of similar fabrics. Also distribution of colours and number of colours in the fabrics were analysed. The biggest number of colours is in fabrics of simple weaves (plain and twill), and the most characteristic are green, red, black and blue colours. DOI: [URL] </p...|$|R
5000|$|First {{described}} as [...] "pants", {{they were used}} for the streamlining effect by Frank Lockhart on a 1928 Stutz land speed record attempt car. Factory production of fender <b>skirts</b> began with the 1932 Graham-Paige. Aesthetically streamlined designs were copied to mass-produced models. The innovations introduced by Amos Northup, such as the V'd radiators, fender <b>skirts,</b> and sloping beaver-tails, became common after 1933. However, by the 1970s, fender <b>skirts</b> began to disappear from mass market automobiles. Fender <b>skirts</b> remained for some time longer on a few cars, particularly large American luxury cars.|$|R

5|$|In 1949, Grant starred {{alongside}} Ann Sheridan in {{the comedy}} I Was a Male War Bride {{in which he}} appeared in scenes dressed as a woman, wearing a <b>skirt</b> and a wig. During the filming he was taken ill with infectious hepatitis and lost weight, affecting {{the way he looked}} in the picture. The film proved to be successful, becoming the highest-grossing film for 20th Century Fox that year with over $4.5 million in takings and being likened to Hawks's screwball comedies of the late 1930s. By this point {{he was one of the}} highest paid Hollywood stars, commanding $300,000 per picture.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, Tony {{married the}} family's {{housekeeper}} Joan Gustafson. They had two children, Jennifer and Mario.

She attended St. Frederick's and St. Andrew's Catholic Elementary Schools, and West Middle School. Madonna was known for her high grade point average, and achieved notoriety for her unconventional behavior.

5|$|By the 1850s {{the term}} {{crinoline}} was more usually {{applied to the}} fashionable silhouette provided by horsehair petticoats, and to the hoop <b>skirts</b> that replaced them in the mid-1850s.

50|$|Long tight <b>skirts</b> reappeared {{through the}} century in various forms, {{particularly}} in evening gowns, {{as well as}} daytime pencil <b>skirts</b> popular from the 1950s onwards.
