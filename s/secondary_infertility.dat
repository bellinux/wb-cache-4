5000|$|There is no {{unanimous}} {{definition of}} female infertility, because the definition depends {{on social and}} physical characteristics which may vary by culture and situation. NICE guidelines state that: [...] "A woman of reproductive age who has not conceived after 1 year of unprotected vaginal sexual intercourse, {{in the absence of}} any known cause of infertility, should be offered further clinical assessment and investigation along with her partner." [...] It is recommended that a consultation with a fertility specialist should be made earlier if the woman is aged 36 years or over, or there is a known clinical cause of infertility or a history of predisposing factors for infertility. [...] According to the World Health Organization (WHO), infertility can be described as the inability to become pregnant, maintain a pregnancy, or carry a pregnancy to live birth.A clinical definition of infertility by the WHO and ICMART is “a disease of the reproductive system defined by the failure to achieve a clinical pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular unprotected sexual intercourse.” [...] Infertility can further be broken down into primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>infertility.</b> Primary infertility refers to the inability to give birth either because of not being able to become pregnant, or carry a child to live birth, which may include miscarriage or a stillborn child. [...] <b>Secondary</b> <b>infertility</b> refers to the inability to conceive or give birth when there was a previous pregnancy or live birth.|$|E

40|$|Infertility {{has always}} been defined {{with respect to a}} number of {{parameters}} prominent amongst which are time, causes, treatment cost and socio-cultural implications. The most widely accepted practical classifications distinguishes between primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>infertilities</b> with a further sub classification into 3 clearly defined groups that include ovulatory dysfunction, fallopian tube compromise, male factor (sperm function and delivery disorder) alongside an ambiguous and controversial group labeled as “unexplained infertility”. Recent technological developments in the fields of optics, video-imaging and miniaturized surgical instruments, have lead to the emergence of minimal access procedures, with wide and varied applications in the field of gynaecology. The skill in its different forms and various combination modalities is widely applied in the management of the infertile couple especially those with tubal infertility. The economic and safety records of endoscopic procedures are well documented in other surgical acts.

50|$|Forty {{percent of}} the world's women are able to access {{therapeutic}} and elective abortions within gestational limits, while an additional 35 percent have access to legal abortion if they meet certain physical, mental, or socioeconomic criteria.

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE [...] The {{aim was to}} {{determine}} whether induced abortions could increase the risk of <b>secondary</b> <b>infertility.</b> DESIGN [...] This was a case-control study; cases were women with <b>secondary</b> <b>infertility,</b> individually matched to two controls who were currently pregnant. Each participant was interviewed by one of two medical doctors using a questionnaire that sought information on their demographic, socioeconomic, medical, and reproductive status. The data were analysed by conditional logistic regression. SETTING [...] The study took place in the Alexandra Maternity Hospital in Athens, Greece, in 1987 - 88. PARTICIPANTS [...] 84 women consecutively admitted with <b>secondary</b> <b>infertility</b> and 168 pregnant controls took part. MAIN RESULTS [...] Eight cases and no controls reported a previous ectopic pregnancy, confirming that the occurrence of a pregnancy of this type dramatically increases the risk of <b>secondary</b> <b>infertility.</b> Furthermore, the occurrence of either induced abortions or spontaneous abortions independently and significantly increased the risk of subsequent development of <b>secondary</b> <b>infertility.</b> The logistic regression adjusted relative risks (and 95 % confidence intervals) for <b>secondary</b> <b>infertility</b> were 2. 1 (1. 1 - 4. 0) when there was one previous induced abortion and 2. 3 (1. 0 - 5. 3) when there were two previous induced abortions. Tobacco smoking significantly increased the risk of <b>secondary</b> <b>infertility,</b> the adjusted relative risk being 3. 0 (1. 3 - 6. 8).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the experiences of women with <b>secondary</b> <b>infertility,</b> to identify any unmet needs of this group, and to develop a substantive theory based on the findings.

The research method for this study was derived from the constructivistic research paradigm as implemented in the naturalistic research strategy. A purposive, emergent sampling design was used to select ten women who experienced <b>secondary</b> <b>infertility</b> as participants. A size of ten was determined by saturation of data which occurred after the completion of the ten individual, in-depth interviews, ten health diaries, and a focus group involving five of the ten women.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Secondary</b> <b>infertility</b> is a common, {{preventable}} but neglected {{reproductive health}} problem in resource-poor countries. This study examines {{the association of}} past sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including HIV, bacterial vaginosis (BV) and factors in the obstetric history with <b>secondary</b> <b>infertility</b> and their relative contributions to <b>secondary</b> <b>infertility.</b> Methods Between November 2007 and May 2009 a research infertility clinic was set up at the Kigali University Teaching Hospital in Rwanda. Cases were defined as sexually-active women aged 21 - 45 years presenting with <b>secondary</b> <b>infertility</b> (n = 177), and controls as multiparous women in the same age groups who recently delivered (n = 219). Participants were interviewed about socio-demographic characteristics and obstetric history using structured questionnaires, and were tested for HIV and reproductive tract infections (RTIs). Results Risk factors in the obstetric history for <b>secondary</b> <b>infertility</b> were lack of prenatal care in the last pregnancy, the first pregnancy {{before the age of}} 21 years, a history of unwanted pregnancy, a pregnancy with other than current partner, an adverse pregnancy outcome, stillbirth, postpartum infection and curettage.

The population attributable fractions (PAF%) for obstetric events, HIV, other (STIs), and BV were 25 %, 30 %, 27 %, and 14 % respectively. Conclusions The main finding {{of this study is that}} obstetric events, HIV and other STIs contribute approximately equally to <b>secondary</b> <b>infertility</b> in Rwanda.

40|$|An {{estimated}} 25 %– 40 % of infertile {{men have}} idiopathic infertility associated with deficient sperm numbers and quality. Here, we identify the membrane-anchored serine protease PRSS 21, {{also known as}} testisin, to be a novel proteolytic factor that directs epididymal sperm cell maturation and sperm-fertilizing ability. PRSS 21 -deficient spermatozoa show decreased motility, angulated and curled tails, fragile necks, and dramatically increased susceptibility to decapitation. These defects reflect aberrant maturation during passage through the epididymis, because histological and electron microscopic structural analyses showed an increased tendency for curled and detached tails as spermatozoa transit from the corpus to the cauda epididymis. Cauda epididymal spermatozoa deficient in PRSS 21 fail to mount a swelling response when exposed to hypotonic conditions, suggesting an impaired {{ability to respond to}} osmotic challenges facing maturing spermatozoa in the female reproductive tract. These data suggest that aberrant regulation of PRSS 21 may underlie certain <b>secondary</b> male <b>infertility</b> syndromes, such as “easily decapitated” spermatozoa in humans...|$|R
