6000|$|At {{the supper}} to Æschylus the tablets {{of the menu}} were inscribed with verses from the elder poet ingeniously chosen for their imaginable {{reference}} to the masterpiece of the younger, whose modesty was delicately spared at every point. It was a question whether the committee managing the affair had not perhaps gone too far in giving the supper while Sophocles was away from Athens staging the piece at Corinth; {{but there was no}} division of opinion as to the taste with which some of the details had been studied. It was considered a <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> to have on the speaker's left, where Sophocles would have sat if he had been present at a supper given to Æschylus, the sitting figure of Melpomene, crowned with rosemary for remembrance. No allusion was made to Æschylus during the evening, after his health had been proposed by the chairman and drunk in silence, but a great and exquisite surprise was reserved for him in the matter of the speeches that followed. By prior agreement among the speakers they were all ostensibly devoted to the examination of the OEdipus and the other dramas of Sophocles, which in his absence were very frankly dealt with. But the unsparing criticism of their defects was made implicitly to take the character of appreciation of the Æschylus tragedies, whose good points were all turned to the light without open mention of them. This afforded the aged poet an opportunity of magnanimously defending his younger confrère, and he rose to the occasion, beaming, as some one said, from head to foot and oozing self-satisfaction at every pore. He could not put from him the compliments not ostensibly directed at him, but he could and did take up the criticisms of the Sophoclean drama, point by point, and refute them in the interest of literature, with a masterly elimination of himself and his own part in it. A Roman gentleman present remarked that he had seen nothing like it, for sincere deprecation, since Cæsar had refused the thrice-offered crown on the Lupercal; and the effect was that intended throughout--the supreme honor of Æschylus {{in the guise of a}} tribute to Sophocles. The note of the whole affair was struck by the comic poet Aristophanes, whom the chairman called upon to make the closing speech of the evening, and who merely sat up long enough to quote the old Attic proverb, [...] "Gentlemen, there are many ways to kill a dog besides choking him to death with butter," [...] and then lay down again amid shrieks of merriment from the whole company.|$|E

40|$|Drawing {{ideas from}} {{previous}} designs {{and other sources}} <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> is a universal part of all human designing, but the forms that adaptation takes, and the ways it is conceptualised both differ between industries. This paper describes how sources <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> are used in commercial knitwear design. Knitwear designers actively search for sources <b>of</b> <b>inspiration,</b> which they use both to define the space of designs that will meet their purposes and tune their tacit perceptions of what is appropriate, and {{in the development of}} individual designs. They employ active strategies for guiding their idea generation actions to produce the ideas the situation requires. Knitwear designers routinely use a very broad range <b>of</b> sources <b>of</b> <b>inspiration,</b> and are explicitly aware and open about how they use them. Identifying a good source is often the key creative step in knitwear design, and being able to do this well is a vital skill for a designer. The paper makes some provisional generalisations about the structure of design processes driven by thinking with sources <b>of</b> <b>inspiration,</b> to provoke and facilitate comparisons with other industries...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this thesis examines the role <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> in contemporary work organisations by exploring various meanings attributed to the term inspiration in organisational settings. This research {{is based on the}} interpretive philosophical paradigm concerned with understanding of the social world as it is at the level of subjective experience and utilises philosophical hermeneutics as a methodological approach <b>of</b> elucidating <b>inspiration</b> in organisational contexts; whereas philosophical hermeneutics emphasises the importance of conditions in which pre-understanding <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> evolves sufficiently to draw technical conceptions <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> in organisational settings. The material for developing a progressive understanding <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> has been provided by hermeneutic interviews carried out with volunteers at different levels of organisational hierarchy from three participating organisations to identify the various meanings <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> and their use, as well as gain a richer understanding how inspiration affects people at work. The findings stemming from participants' accounts were then used to conceptualise inspiration in organisational settings. The results of the study indicate that inspiration is significant to the context of contemporary work organisations and is often intentionally sought out at all organisational levels. The account on inspiration created in this study signifies that currently use <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> in organisational contexts lacks theoretical underpinning, wherein inspiration is often merely used in a flexible lexical way to add either clarity or ambiguity to any communication, depending on its context. Overall, having explored inspiration in organisational settings, this study has identified it as an emerging concept, which fundamentally exists and is recognised in contemporary work organisations. The developed conceptualisations <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> allow for the rethinking of various aspects of organisational contexts and leadership and motivation theory in particular. The theoretical underpinning for inspiration laid out in this study {{can be used as a}} basis for future research. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
