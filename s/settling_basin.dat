25|$|Waters {{exiting the}} {{flocculation}} basin may enter the sedimentation basin, also called a clarifier or <b>settling</b> <b>basin.</b> It {{is a large}} tank with low water velocities, allowing floc to settle to the bottom. The sedimentation basin is best located close to the flocculation basin so the transit between the two processes does not permit settlement or floc break up. Sedimentation basins may be rectangular, where water flows from end to end, or circular where flow is from the centre outward. Sedimentation basin outflow is typically over a weir so only a thin top layer of water—that furthest from the sludge—exits.|$|E
25|$|The Clearwater River {{starts as}} a typical silt-laden glacial stream, then flows into Hobson Lake which acts as a huge <b>settling</b> <b>basin</b> for the glacial material. Clearwater Lake {{downstream}} continues the silt removing process. Three major tributaries all have large lakes on them as well: Azure River with Azure Lake, Murtle River with Murtle Lake, and Mahood River with Canim Lake and Mahood Lake. The North Thompson River, by contrast, has no lakes on it so silt from the Thompson Glacier at its origin {{as well as its}} glacial tributaries is carried the whole length of the river. The Overlanders bestowed only two place names during their perilous journey on the North Thompson River: Clear Water River and Raft Peak above the town of Clearwater.|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} Missoulians drew {{their water}} {{directly from the}} Clark Fork River or nearby Rattlesnake Creek. The first water system consisted of a Native American known as One-Eyed Riley and his friend filling buckets {{of water from the}} Rattlesnake Creek and hauling them door to door on a donkey cart. In 1871 city co-founder Frank Worden began construction of a log pipe and wooden main system that flowed from the Rattlesnake Creek [...] north of the city. With the addition of two small covered reservoirs, the first municipal water system was begun in 1880. With an intake dam built in 1901 with a <b>settling</b> <b>basin</b> capacity of , the Rattlesnake Creek continued to meet demands of the city until 1935 when five wells were added to respond to increased summer and fall demand. This system is still maintained as an emergency backup, but was discontinued as a primary source after Giardia outbreak in 1983. Since then, Missoula has relied on the Missoula Valley Aquifer as the sole source of water. In 1889, the first electrical plant was built by [...] to power his major downtown properties such as the Missoula Mercantile and the Florence Hotel. In 1905, the Missoula Mercantile (by then owned by Copper King William A. Clark purchased the water system and consolidated it with its vast electrical holdings to create the Missoula Light and Water Company (ML) a year later. Electricity and water remained bundled after ML's sale to the Montana Power Company (MPC) in 1929. In 1979, MPC sold its water utility holdings as Mountain Water Company to Park Water Company in Downey, California, which since 2011 has been a subsidiary of The Carlyle Group. In 2015, the City of Missoula was legally granted its right to acquire the water system by exercising its power of eminent domain", but , that decision is under appeal.|$|E

2500|$|By 2010 Suncor had {{transformed}} their first tailings pond, Pond One, into Wapisiw Lookout, the first reclaimed <b>settling</b> <b>basin</b> {{in the oil}} sands. In 2007 the area was a 220-hectare pond of toxic effluent but several years later there was firm land planted with black spruce and trembling aspen. Wapisiw Lookout represents only one percent of tailings ponds in 2011 but Pond One was the first effluent pond in the oil sands industry in 1967 and was used until 1997. By 2011 only 65 square kilometres were cleaned up and about one square kilometre was certified by Alberta as a self-sustaining natural environment. Wapisiw Lookout {{has not yet been}} certified. Closure operations of Pond One began in 2007. The jello-like mature fine tails (MFT) were pumped and dredged out of the pond and relocated to another tailings pond for long-term storage and treatment.

50|$|<b>Settling</b> <b>basins</b> used in dairy {{production}} {{reduce the}} nutrient-loading on a vegetative filter strip from lot runoff, thus decreasing the required lagoon volume {{for a new}} facility. Moreover, <b>settling</b> <b>basins</b> are useful to remove unwanted solid materials, such as hay, straw and feathers from the waste stream before flowing to the lagoon, aids to reduce smell and avoid crust formation on the lagoon surface. A baffle {{may be used to}} retain the floating solids removed. There are two types of <b>settling</b> <b>basins,</b> based on the method of removing solids. With one type, the solids are removed mechanically (after the free water has drained away), usually with a front-end or skid-steer loader. The other type uses hydraulic (pump) removal of the solids. Typically, pumping is initiated when the basin is half full of solids and the remainder is water. Vigorous agitation is needed to mix the liquid and the solids, preferably by propeller-type agitators or pumps with agitation nozzles.|$|R
40|$|The incessant and {{stochastic}} {{character of}} rainfall in young and fragile mountain catchment generates {{enormous amount of}} sediment in Himalayan rivers. Irregularity in plan and bed forms, heterogeneity in bed and suspension loads, debris and mudflows make hydraulics of river channel flow quite complex and withdrawal of sediment free water from these rivers a very challenging task. Consequently, sediment related damages due to wear and tear {{in most of the}} hydropower projects, but in medium and high head plants {{have been found to be}} quite alarming. The conventional wisdom that particles smaller than 200 micron do not cause wear and tear to the turbines and accessories has been found to be inadequate in this region. Therefore, there is a need of excluding most of the sand particles from the flow. However, due to topographical limitations as well as higher cost of the gravity <b>settling</b> <b>basins,</b> construction of bigger <b>settling</b> <b>basins</b> is often impossible. Therefore, there is a need of different approach to be adopted to exclude fine sediment in such cases. This paper puts forth centrifugal acceleration technique and particularly the use of hydrocyclones for particle separation. Experimental investigations on hydraulic and particles separation efficiency of 224 mm and 380 mm dia hydrocyclones are reported. The performance s have been compared among the hydrocyclones and the <b>settling</b> <b>basins.</b> The particles removal efficiency of hydrocyclones, especially of finer particles have been found to be much higher than that of gravity <b>settling</b> <b>basins...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Translation of {{required}} settling time surface area to <b>settling</b> <b>basin</b> geometry requires consideration of short circuiting and turbulence induced by wind, bottom scour, or inlet and overflow design. <b>Settling</b> <b>basin</b> geometry {{is important because}} effective time of settling within the basin will be the time a volume of water spends in non-turbulent conditions before reaching the <b>settling</b> <b>basin</b> overflow. Median time is always less than the mean time calculated by dividing available volume by anticipated flow. The median time of passage through a short, wide <b>settling</b> <b>basin</b> may be significantly less than the median time of passage through a long, narrow <b>settling</b> <b>basin.</b> Settling basins with overflow structures near the entrance points may hold a large volume of stagnant water while newly admitted water rapidly reaches the overflow point before settling can occur. Effective surface area for settling seldom extends perpendicularly more than a tenth the distance of a flow line from basin entrance to overflow unless baffles are installed. [...] Effective surface area and geometry may change as accumulating sediment fills part of the originally constructed volume. Short cut channels may rapidly form through heavier sediment accumulations {{near the entrance to}} the <b>settling</b> <b>basin.</b> Flow through shallow portions of the <b>settling</b> <b>basin</b> may cause turbulence resuspending sediment {{from the bottom of the}} basin. Two feet has been recommended as a minimum <b>settling</b> <b>basin</b> depth to avoid bottom scour.|$|E
50|$|Wastewater {{enters the}} basin and very fine {{particles}} in the water are separated by means of gravity. The water {{must be in the}} basin long enough for the desired particle size to be removed. Smaller particles require longer periods for removal and thus larger basins. In some basins a flocculant may be added to help smaller particles stick together and form larger particles. Stokes' law can be used to calculate the size of a <b>settling</b> <b>basin</b> needed in order to remove a desired particle size. Stokes' law gives a settling velocity determining an effective <b>settling</b> <b>basin</b> depth; so solids removal depends upon effective <b>settling</b> <b>basin</b> surface area, while the depth component of <b>settling</b> <b>basin</b> volume remains important for storage of settled solids.|$|E
