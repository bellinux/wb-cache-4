40|$|Popped sorghum {{is one of}} {{the ready}} to eat snacks which is popularly {{consumed}} by local growers. A number of process are used in the preparation of ready-to-eat cereals including puffing, flaking and <b>shredding</b> of <b>wheat,</b> corn and rice but none for sorghum. The quality of sorghum puffed by conventional and microwave was evaluated. The effects of moisture content, microwave power and time on the puffing qualities of sorghum were investigated. Sorghum was adjusted at three moisture levels 18, 21 and 24 % (wb) and puffed with conventional and microwave method. In conventional method sorghum at 21 % moisture content for 3 min produced a higher puffing yield (83 %), expansion ratio (4. 44) and flake size (0. 18 ml/grain). Similarly in microwave method sorghum at 21 % moisture content, 100 percent power level for 3 min produced highest puffing yield (89 %), expansion volume (8. 67) and flake size (0. 28). Puffed sorghum at low moisture content (18 %) produced high puffing yield but lowest expansion ratio and flake size in both conventional and microwave method. Puffing at low moisture content and high microwave power decreased the lightness of the puffed sorghum. The maximum value of protein, fat and ash obtained in conventional method were 7. 90, 3. 19, and 2. 36 %, similarly in microwave method value obtained were 7. 91, 3. 16 and 2. 37 % respectively...|$|R

2500|$|His {{first-class}} cricket {{career began}} just after World War II in 1946 and lasted 21 years as he played 682 matches, taking 2,082 wickets at a bowling average of 23.13, which puts him 25th {{on the all-time}} list of wicket-takers. Bailey achieved the rare feat of taking all 10 wickets in an innings, for 90 runs, against Lancashire at Clacton in 1949.

He was also the county's secretary (i.e. the chief administrative officer) from 1964 to 1969, having previously had a spell as assistant secretary. He arranged for Warwickshire to make an interest-free loan to Essex in 1965 which allowed Essex to buy its Chelmsford ground.

This provoked National Biscuit Company to sue Kellogg for trademark infringement, attempting to enjoin him from using <b>Shredded</b> <b>Wheat</b> as a trade name and from manufacturing the cereal in its pillow-shaped form. This series of litigations led to the United States Supreme Court case Kellogg Co. v. National Biscuit Co. in 1938. The Supreme Court ruled that <b>shredded</b> <b>wheat</b> was generic and not trademarkable; and that in any case, when the first patent for <b>shredded</b> <b>wheat</b> machinery expired in 1912, the right to apply the name [...] "shredded wheat" [...] to the product passed into the public domain along with that patent.|$|E
