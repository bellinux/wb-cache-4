40|$|The tremorogenic fungal metabolite, paxilline, {{is widely}} used as a potent and {{relatively}} specific blocker of Ca 2 +- and voltage-activated <b>Slo</b> 1 (or BK) K+ channels. The pH-regulated <b>Slo</b> 3 K+ channel, a <b>Slo</b> 1 homologue, is resistant to blockade by paxilline. Taking advantage of the marked differences in paxilline sensitivity and the homology between subunits, we have examined the paxilline sensitivity {{of a set of}} chimeric <b>Slo</b> 1 /Slo 3 subunits. Paxilline sensitivity is associated with elements of the S 5 –P loop–S 6 module of the <b>Slo</b> 1 channel. Replacement of the <b>Slo</b> 1 S 5 segment or {{the second half of the}} P loop results in modest changes in paxilline sensitivity. Replacing the <b>Slo</b> 1 S 6 segment with the <b>Slo</b> 3 sequence abolishes paxilline sensitivity. An increase in paxilline affinity and changes in block kinetics also result from replacing the first part of the <b>Slo</b> 1 P loop, the so-called turret, with <b>Slo</b> 3 sequence. The <b>Slo</b> 1 and <b>Slo</b> 3 S 6 segments differ at 10 residues. <b>Slo</b> 1 -G 311 S was found to markedly reduce paxilline block. In constructs with a <b>Slo</b> 3 S 6 segment, S 300 G restored paxilline block, but most effectively when paired with a <b>Slo</b> 1 P loop. Other S 6 residues differing between <b>Slo</b> 1 and <b>Slo</b> 3 had little influence on paxilline block. The involvement of <b>Slo</b> 1 G 311 in paxilline sensitivity suggests that paxilline may occupy a position within the central cavity or access its blocking position through the central cavity. To explain the differences in paxilline sensitivity between <b>Slo</b> 1 and <b>Slo</b> 3, we propose that the G 311 /S 300 position in <b>Slo</b> 1 and <b>Slo</b> 3 underlies a structural difference between subunits in the bend of S 6, which influences the occupancy by paxilline...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe pore-forming subunit of the large-conductance Ca 2 +-dependent K+ (<b>Slo</b> 1) {{channel is}} encoded by one gene. However, the {{functional}} properties of <b>Slo</b> 1 channels are diverse {{in part because}} of their numerous regulatory mechanisms including posttranslational modification and alternative splicing. In particular, multiple splice variants of the pore-forming subunit have been reported but their significance is only beginning to be elucidated. Here we examined the cell biological properties of the three common C-terminal isoforms that differ in the last 8 (<b>Slo</b> 1 _ERL and <b>Slo</b> 1 _VYR) or 61 residues (<b>Slo</b> 1 _DEC). We found that <b>Slo</b> 1 _DEC, the longest isoform, shows dramatically reduced surface expression compared to that of <b>Slo</b> 1 _ERL or <b>Slo</b> 1 _VYR. Immunocytochemistry revealed that a large fraction of <b>Slo</b> 1 _DEC remains localized in endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Using a GST fusion protein containing the <b>Slo</b> 1 _DEC-specific sequence, affinity purification was carried out to isolate interacting proteins. The identified proteins include protein phosphatase 2 A (PP 2 A-A), actin, and tubulin. The PP 2 A-A interaction is specific to <b>Slo</b> 1 _DEC and causes a significant reduction of phosphorylation in <b>Slo</b> 1 _DEC but not <b>Slo</b> 1 _ERL or <b>Slo</b> 1 _VYR.

40|$|Eukaryotic K+ {{channels}} {{from the}} <b>SLO</b> family (<b>SLO</b> 1, <b>SLO</b> 2 and <b>SLO</b> 3) provide {{a link between}} intracellular signaling and the electrical activity of a cell. The opening and closing (gating) of the three different <b>SLO</b> homologs {{is controlled by the}} synergistic action of membrane voltage and specific intracellular cues: Ca 2 + binding in <b>SLO</b> 1, Na+ binding in <b>SLO</b> 2 and pH increase in <b>SLO</b> 3. It is known that intracellular signals activate <b>SLO</b> channels by acting on the large cytoplasmic domains (CTDs) of these proteins, which follows the transmembrane ionconduction pore. However, a molecular description of the mechanisms of intracellular gating in <b>SLO</b> channels is still lacking. In this thesis, I present biochemical, structural and functional studies aiming at understanding how the activity of <b>SLO</b> 1 and <b>SLO</b> 3 channels is controlled by intracellular Ca 2 + binding and pH increase, respectively. First, I describe recombinant methods for the large-scale expression and purification of functional <b>SLO</b> channels, paving the way for a more complete biochemical and structural analysis of these proteins. Then, I report the crystal structures of the large cytoplasmic domains (CTDs) from two different <b>SLO</b> 1 channels. Structures of the Ca 2 +-bound CTDs from human and zebrafish <b>SLO</b> 1 channels define the precise molecular architecture of <b>SLO</b> 1 ’s Ca 2 +-sensing module: CTDs from the four subunits of a tetrameric <b>SLO</b> 1 channel assemble in a so-called gating ring structure at the intracellular face of the membrane. In conjunction with other studies, these results describe how Ca 2 + binding affects the conformation of one layer of the <b>SLO</b> 1 gating ring, which can explain the Ca 2 +-driven opening of <b>SLO</b> 1 ’s ion conduction pore. Next, I present the crystal structure of the human <b>SLO</b> 3 gating ring. A comparison with the <b>SLO</b> 1 structures suggests that the hSLO 3 structure represents the open conformation of the hSLO 3 gating ring. Finally, I describe functional mutagenesis studies on the mouse <b>SLO</b> 3 ortholog, which reveal a possible mechanism for pH sensing in the mouse <b>SLO</b> 3 channel. Surprisingly, the mechanism I propose appears not to be conserved in <b>SLO</b> 3 channels from other species. This could be a dramatic example of how new functional mechanisms can easily evolve within the very versatile scaffold of a gating ring structure.

A single vertebrate gene variously known as <b>Slo</b> 1, KCa 1. 1, or KCNMA 1 encodes the pore-forming subunits of BKCa channel but {{is expressed in}} a potentially {{very large number of}} alternative splice variants. Two splice variants of <b>Slo</b> 1, <b>Slo</b> 1 VEDEC and <b>Slo</b> 1 QEERL, which differ at the extreme COOH terminus, show markedly different steady-state expression levels on the cell surface. Here we show that <b>Slo</b> 1 VEDEC and <b>Slo</b> 1 QEERL can reciprocally coimmunoprecipitate, indicating that they form heteromeric complexes. Moreover, coexpression of even small amounts of <b>Slo</b> 1 VEDEC markedly reduces surface expression of <b>Slo</b> 1 QEERL and total <b>Slo</b> 1 as indicated by cell-surface biotinylation assays. The effects of <b>Slo</b> 1 VEDEC on steady-state surface expression can be attributed primarily to the last five residues of the protein based on surface expression of motif-swapped constructs of <b>Slo</b> 1 in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 T cells. In addition, the presence of the VEDEC motif at the COOH terminus of <b>Slo</b> 1 channels is sufficient to confer a dominant-negative effect on cell surface expression of itself or other types of <b>Slo</b> 1 subunits. Treating cells with short peptides containing the VEDEC motif increased surface expression of <b>Slo</b> 1 VEDEC channels transiently expressed in HEK 293 T cells and increased current through endogenous BKCa channels in mouse podocytes. <b>Slo</b> 1 VEDEC and <b>Slo</b> 1 QEERL channels are removed from the HEK 293 T cell surface with similar kinetics and to a similar extent, which suggests that the inhibitory effect of the VEDEC motif is exerted primarily on forward trafficking into the plasma membrane...|$|R

Furthermore, the average <b>Slo</b> 3 unitary current at a given activation potential does not change with pH.

For the pH-regulated <b>Slo</b> 3 K+ channel, the dependence of macroscopic conductance on pH suggests that the pH-sensitive mechanism regulates gating in an allosteric manner qualitatively similar to regulation of <b>Slo</b> 1 by Ca 2 +.

40|$|The mouse <b>Slo</b> 3 gene (KCNMA 3) encodes a K+ {{channel that}} is {{regulated}} {{by changes in}} cytosolic pH. Like <b>Slo</b> 1 subunits responsible for the Ca 2 + and voltage-activated BK-type channel, the <b>Slo</b> 3 α subunit contains a pore module with homology to voltage-gated K+ channels and also an extensive cytosolic C terminus thought {{to be responsible for}} ligand dependence. For the <b>Slo</b> 3 K+ channel, increases in cytosolic pH promote channel activation, but very little is known about many fundamental properties of <b>Slo</b> 3 currents. Here we define the dependence of macroscopic conductance on voltage and pH and, in particular, examine <b>Slo</b> 3 conductance activated at negative potentials. Using this information, the ability of a Horrigan-Aldrich–type of general allosteric model to account for <b>Slo</b> 3 gating is examined. Finally, the pH and voltage dependence of <b>Slo</b> 3 activation and deactivation kinetics is reported. The results indicate that <b>Slo</b> 3 differs from <b>Slo</b> 1 in several important ways. The limiting conductance activated at the most positive potentials exhibits a pH-dependent maximum, suggesting differences in the limiting open probability at different pH. Furthermore, over a 600 mV range of voltages (− 300 to + 300 mV), <b>Slo</b> 3 conductance shifts only about two to three orders of magnitude, and the limiting conductance at negative potentials is relatively voltage independent compared to <b>Slo</b> 1. Within the context of the Horrigan-Aldrich model, these results indicate that the intrinsic voltage dependence (zL) of the <b>Slo</b> 3 closed–open equilibrium and the coupling (D) between voltage sensor movement are less than in <b>Slo</b> 1. The kinetic behavior of <b>Slo</b> 3 currents also differs markedly from <b>Slo</b> 1. Both activation and deactivation are best described by two exponential components, both of which are only weakly voltage dependent. Qualitatively, the properties of the two kinetic components in the activation time course suggest that increases in pH increase the fraction of more rapidly opening channels...|$|R
