40|$|Abstract: In our {{application}} {{practice of}} sample survey, we mostly neglect some non-sampling errors such as <b>sampling</b> <b>frame</b> errors. Actually, {{the influence of}} non-sampling errors to the total survey deviation can not be ignored. In view of this topic, this paper briefly discussed the <b>sampling</b> <b>frame</b> errors as non-sampling errors. First {{a brief review of}} the <b>sampling</b> <b>frame,</b> together with the type and structure of the <b>sampling</b> <b>frame,</b> is given. Next the distinction between <b>sampling</b> <b>frame</b> errors and <b>sampling</b> errors is made theoretically in general. Then through the analysis of a series of non-random impact factors and the application of corresponding improvements or solutions, the <b>sampling</b> <b>frame</b> errors are reduced or controlled within a certain range. Finally, this paper summed up and sorted out the influencing factors based on the sample units or elements for the <b>sampling</b> <b>frame,</b> and also discussed the problems and solutions...|$|R

The scoring module constructs the test sequence based on the 16 angle features of eight key joint nodes and the instantaneous velocity characteristics of 20 joint nodes. By comparing with the standard sequence in real time, the original scoring rules is used to achieve the scoring function, which provides students with intuitive and reliable training recommendations, so as to improve the efficiency of learning. By increasing the number of sensors, further designing and optimizing data fusion and filtering algorithm, combining with Microsoft’s Kinect 2. 0 version, the system can also be applied to medical rehabilitation, physical training analysis and evaluation, virtual reality and human-computer interaction, etc...|$|R
40|$|Link-tracing {{designs are}} often used to {{estimate}} the size of hidden populations by utilizing the relational links between their members. A major problem in studies of hidden populations {{is the lack of}} a convenient <b>sampling</b> <b>frame.</b> The most frequently applied design in studies of hidden populations is respondent-driven sampling in which no <b>sampling</b> <b>frame</b> is used. However, in some studies multiple but incomplete <b>sampling</b> <b>frames</b> are available. In this article, we introduce the B-graph design {{that can be used in}} such situations. In this design, all available incomplete <b>sampling</b> <b>frames</b> are joined and turned into one <b>sampling</b> <b>frame,</b> from which a random sample is drawn and selected respondents are asked to mention their contacts. By considering the population as a bipartite graph of a two-mode network (those from the <b>sampling</b> <b>frame</b> and those who are not on the frame), the number of respondents who are directly linked to the <b>sampling</b> <b>frame</b> members can be estimated using Chao’s and Zelterman’s estimators for sparse data.

30|$|When {{pipelining}} between sample {{acquisition and}} processing is introduced, {{after the first}} batch of samples arrived, sampling and processing the samples obtained in the previous time frame are happening in parallel. This is the first level of parallelism. The blind time {{is equal to the}} original processing time minus the sampling time, as shown in plot (b) of Figure 4. However, this is not sufficient to achieve seamless sampling if the processing time is longer than the sampling time. To further reduce the processing time, we seek to add parallel processing within the processing phase itself. The processing phase consists of splitting <b>samples</b> into small <b>frames,</b> <b>applying</b> FFT operation on all frames sequentially, and combining all the FFT result in one way or another. As FFT is a highly computational demanding operation, instead of having one single FFT core working sequentially, we utilize multiple FFT cores to work simultaneously: the incoming samples are divided among the multiple FFT cores for processing. Once the samples have been received, the FFT cores work independently from each other, hence ideal for parallelism. This is where the second-level parallelism is introduced. We illustrate the case of two FFT cores working in parallel in plot (c) of Figure 4. More FFT cores could be added if it is necessary to achieve continuous spectrum sensing.|$|R

40|$|Under-coverage {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{problems}} of <b>sampling</b> <b>frames.</b> To reduce the impact of coverage error on survey estimates several frames can be combined in order to achieve a complete (or nearly complete) coverage of the target population. Multiple frame estimators have been developed to be used in the context of multiple <b>frame</b> surveys. <b>Sampling</b> <b>frames</b> may overlap which is the case when a single unit of the <b>sampling</b> <b>frame</b> is related with more than one element of the target population. Indirect sampling (Lavallée, 1995) is an alternative approach to classical sampling theory in dealing with the overlapping problem of <b>sampling</b> <b>frames</b> on survey estimates. Not infrequently a survey may need more than one <b>sampling</b> <b>frame</b> in order to improve coverage and simultaneously the <b>sampling</b> <b>frame</b> overlap. In this paper a new class of estimators is presented which is the result from merging multiple frames estimators (only the particular case of dual frames will be presented) with indirect sampling estimators in order to bring together in a single estimator the effect of several frames on survey estimates.

40|$|Background: Increasing {{numbers of}} {{individuals}} {{are choosing to}} opt out of population-based <b>sampling</b> <b>frames</b> due to privacy concerns. This is especially a problem in the selection of controls for case–control studies, as the cases often arise from relatively complete population-based registries,whereas control selection requires a <b>sampling</b> <b>frame.</b> If opt out is also related to risk factors, bias can arise. Methods: We linked breast cancer cases who reported having a valid driver’s license from the 2004 – 2008 Wisconsin women’s health study (N 2, 988) with a master list of licensed drivers from the Wisconsin Department of Transportation (WDOT). This master list excludes Wisconsin drivers that requested their information not be sold by the state. Multivariate-adjusted selection probability ratios (SPR) were calculated to estimate potential bias when using this driver’s license <b>sampling</b> <b>frame</b> to select controls. Results:A total of 962 cases (32 %) had opted out of the WDOT <b>sampling</b> <b>frame.</b> Cases age < 40 (SPR 0. 90), income either unreported (SPR 0. 89) or greater than $ 50, 000 (SPR 0. 94), lower parity (SPR 0. 96 per one-child decrease), and hormone use (SPR 0. 93) were significantly less likely to be covered by the WDOT <b>sampling</b> <b>frame</b> (a 0. 05 level). Conclusions:Our results indicate the potential for selection bias due to differential opt out between various demographic and behavioral subgroups of controls. As selection bias may differ by exposure and study base, the assessment of potential bias needs to be ongoing. Impact: SPRs can be used to predict the direction of bias when cases and controls stem from different <b>sampling</b> <b>frames</b> inpopulation-based case–control studies.

30|$|Due to {{the mobile}} and {{temporary}} nature of internal migration in China, {{there was no}} existing <b>sampling</b> <b>frame</b> to conduct the MHS. Migrants are typically clustered in dormitories near factories and construction sites, often without a registered address. Therefore, the <b>sampling</b> <b>frame</b> from the UHS would not be representative for migrant workers. To cope with this issue and ensure reasonable representativeness of the migrant worker population, the RUMiC team devised an innovative <b>sampling</b> <b>frame</b> 4. The first step involved creating a listing of migrants and workplaces to estimate the total size of the migrant population in each city. This {{was based on a}} pre-survey census collected across randomly selected blocks in which the cities were divided into (see Kong, 2009, for details). Using the listing data, a <b>sampling</b> <b>frame</b> based on workplaces (rather than residences) was created. Furthermore, all businesses–including street vendors–in randomly selected enumeration areas within defined city boundaries were included. For each city, a sample of migrant workers was randomly selected within each workplace, based on their birth month. The enumerators subsequently conducted face-to-face interviews with migrant workers and their families.|$|R
