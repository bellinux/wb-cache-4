5|$|Bruichladdich Radical {{remained}} in the Le Mans Series in 2008, but had an all-new driver line-up of Jens Petersen, Jan-Dirk Leuders and Marc Rostan. The season opener, which was the 1000 km of Catalunya, saw the team finish 15th overall, and seventh in class. However, {{the rest of the}} season was unsuccessful, as the team did not finish above 30th overall in any of the remaining LMS races, or the 24 Hours of Le Mans; although 30th at the 1000km of Spa equated to seventh in class, due to attrition. As a result, the team <b>slipped</b> <b>to</b> joint-eleventh in class, with four points.|$|E
5|$|In May 1986, George Graham was {{appointed}} as Arsenal manager.

Arsenal however <b>slipped</b> <b>to</b> sixth in the league the following season, and lost out to Luton Town in the League Cup final a year later. Graham sought to resolve inconsistencies by freshening up his squad, promoting number of academy graduates while selling ageing players. By the summer of 1988, he achieved a blend of youth and experience, but little was thought of Arsenal's chances of winning the First Division.|$|E

In April, the situation deteriorated further; Benfica matched their worst league defeat in 60 years, <b>slipped</b> <b>to</b> fourth place and was knocked out of the Portuguese Cup by Sporting CP. An away draw in May's opening game left the club dangerously close to finishing fourth. One week later, fans had the bitter-sweet experience of celebrating Rui Costa's final match and seeing Benfica finish fourth, their worst finish since 2001–02.|$|E

5|$|Although Barber did {{not play}} any more Tests, his scoring was {{consistent}} in the four seasons up until World War II.

5|$|Despite a long {{scoreless}} {{streak to}} start the team's history, Toronto FC quickly began to establish itself as a club with significant fan support. The club's first win came on May 12, 2007 at BMO Field as Danny Dichio scored the club's first goal in the 24th minute of a 3–1 home win over the Chicago Fire. Though TFC <b>slipped</b> <b>to</b> {{the bottom of the}} MLS standings with a record of , the club built a foundation as the first Canadian team in MLS. In the club's second season in 2008, Toronto hosted the 2008 MLS All-Star Game.

To determine the Canadian Soccer Association's representative in the CONCACAF Champions League, Toronto FC played in the inaugural Canadian Championship in 2008 competing for the Voyageurs Cup. TFC were the favourites to win the championship in its first year, but the Montreal Impact prevailed.|$|E
5|$|The 2011 NHL Entry Draft {{was held}} in St. Paul, Minnesota, on June 24 and 25. In the draft, Columbus {{selected}} two players who were projected to go higher in the draft.

Their final selection, goaltender Anton Forsberg, was taken following the recommendation of Goaltender Coach Ian Clark. Jenner (Canada), third round pick T. J.

In the final practice session, Häkkinen set the fastest time of the day, a 1:41.658; Coulthard finished with the third-fastest time.

Button was seventh fastest, in front of Salo. Villeneuve and Trulli completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. Fisichella's car suffered an engine failure in the closing seconds of the session and a crash by Michael Schumacher after the session concluded meant that the German was forced to use his team's spare car for qualifying.|$|E
