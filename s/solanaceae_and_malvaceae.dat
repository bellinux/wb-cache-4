40|$|ABSTRACT. This study {{aimed to}} detail the {{temporal}} and morphological {{parameters of the}} immature stages of southern armyworm Spodoptera eridania (Stoll, 1782) with larvae feed on artificial diet, under controlled conditions (256 1 C, 706 10 % relative humidity and 14 -h photophase) and gather information about their larval host plants. The viability of the egg, larval, pupal, and prepupal stages was 97. 82, 93. 62, 96. 42, and 97. 03 %, respectively. The average duration of the egg, larval, pupal, and pre–pupal stages was 4. 00, 16. 18, 1. 58, and 9. 17 d, respectively. During the larval stage, 43. 44 % of females passed through seven instars, observing that the female’s de-velopment was significant slower than males. The female larvae that developed through six and seven instars exhibited a mean growth rate of 1. 52 and 1. 44, respectively. Female pupae were significantly larger, exhibiting faster development than males. The rearing method proved to be adequate, providing more detailed observations of the biological cycle, especially at the larval stage, and resulting in an overall survival of almost 85 %. Two hundred two plant species belonging to 58 families are listed as natural hosts for S. eridania, mainly including Asteraceae, Fabaceae, <b>Solanaceae,</b> Poaceae, Amaranthaceae, <b>and</b> <b>Malvaceae...</b>|$|R

40|$|The soil-borne fungus Verticillium causes serious {{vascular}} {{disease in}} a wide variety of annual crops and woody perennials. Verticillium wilt is notoriously difficult to control by conventional methods, so there is great potential for biocontrol to manage this disease. In this study we aimed to review the research about Verticillium biocontrol to get a better understanding of characteristics that are desirable in a biocontrol agent (BCA) against Verticillium wilt. We only considered studies in which the BCAs were tested on plants. Most biocontrol studies were focused on plants of the <b>Solanaceae,</b> <b>Malvaceae,</b> <b>and</b> Brassicaceae and within these families eggplant, cotton, and oilseed rape were the most studied crops. The list of bacterial BCAs with potential against Verticillium was dominated by endophytic Bacillus and Pseudomonas isolates, while non-pathogenic xylem-colonizing Verticillium and Fusarium isolates topped the fungal list. Predominant modes of action involved in biocontrol were inhibition of primary inoculum germination, plant growth promotion, competition and induced resistance. Many BCAs showed in vitro antibiosis and mycoparasitism but these traits were not correlated with activity in vivo and there is no evidence that they play a role in planta. Good BCAs were obtained from soils suppressive to Verticillium wilt, disease suppressive composts, and healthy plants in infested fields. Desirable characteristics in a BCA against Verticillium are the ability to (1) affect the survival or germination of microsclerotia, (2) colonize the xylem and/or cortex and compete with the pathogen for nutrients and/or space, (3) induce resistance responses in the plant and/or (4) promote plant growth. Potential BCAs should be screened in conditions that resemble the field situation to increase the chance of successful use in practice. Furthermore, issues such as large scale production, formulation, preservation conditions, shelf life, and application methods should be considered early in the process of selecting BCAs against Verticillium...|$|R
