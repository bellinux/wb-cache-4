50|$|See drawing. Many {{inexpensive}} potentiometers {{are constructed}} with a resistive element (B) formed into an arc {{of a circle}} usually a little less than a full turn and a wiper (C) sliding on this element when rotated, making electrical contact. The resistive element can be flat or angled. Each end of the resistive element is connected to a terminal (E, G) on the case. The wiper is connected to a third terminal (F), usually between the other two. On panel potentiometers, the wiper is usually the center terminal of three. For <b>single-turn</b> <b>potentiometers,</b> this wiper typically travels just under one revolution around the contact. The only point of ingress for contamination is the narrow space between the shaft and the housing it rotates in.|$|R
