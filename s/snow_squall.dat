25|$|He was {{concerned}} because Mallory and Irvine {{seemed to be}} five hours behind their schedule. After this sighting, Odell continued on to Camp VI where he found the tent in chaotic disorder. At 2p.m. an intense <b>snow</b> <b>squall</b> began. Odell {{went out in the}} squall hoping to signal the two climbers who he believed would by now be descending. He whistled and shouted, hoping to lead them back to the tent, but gave up because of the intense cold. Odell holed up in C-VI until the squall ended at 4pm. He then scanned the mountain for Mallory and Irvine but saw no one.|$|E

25|$|A {{range of}} {{different}} outcomes has been proposed, and new theories {{continue to be}} put forward. Most views have the two carrying two cylinders of oxygen each, reaching and climbing either the First or Second Step, where they are seen by Odell. At this point {{there are two main}} alternatives: either Mallory takes Irvine's oxygen and goes on alone (and may or may not reach the summit); or both go on together until they turn back (having used up their oxygen, or realising that they will do so before the summit). In either case Mallory slips and falls to his death while descending, perhaps caught in the fierce <b>snow</b> <b>squall</b> that sent Odell to take shelter in their tent. Irvine either falls with him or, in the first scenario, dies alone of exhaustion and hypothermia high up on the ridge. The theory advanced by Tom Holzel in February 2008 is that Odell sighted Mallory and Irvine climbing the First Step for a final look around while they were descending from a failed summit bid.|$|E
500|$|A winter waterspout, {{also known}} as a snow devil, an icespout, an ice devil, a snownado, or a snowspout, is an {{extremely}} rare instance of a waterspout forming under the base of a <b>snow</b> <b>squall.</b> The term [...] "winter waterspout" [...] is used to differentiate between the common warm season waterspout and this rare winter season event. [...] Very little is known about this phenomenon and only six known pictures of this event exist to date, four of which were taken in Ontario, Canada. [...] There are a couple of critical criteria for the formation of a winter waterspout. [...] Very cold temperatures need to be present over a body of water warm enough to produce fog resembling steam above the water's surface. [...] Like the more efficient lake-effect snow events, winds focusing down the axis of long lakes enhance wind convergence and likely enhance their development.|$|E

6000|$|Two {{thousand}} feet, probably, we {{mounted to}} what Frank called Little Buckskin. In the west a copper glow, ridged with lead-colored clouds, marked {{where the sun}} had set. The air was very thin and icy cold. At the first clump of pinyon pines, we made dry camp. When I sat down {{it was as if}} I had been anchored. Frank solicitously remarked that I looked [...] "sort of beat." [...] Jim built a roaring fire and began getting supper. A <b>snow</b> <b>squall</b> came on the rushing wind. The air grew colder, and though I hugged the fire, I could not get warm. When I had satisfied my hunger, I rolled out my sleeping-bag and crept into it. I stretched my aching limbs and did not move again. Once I awoke, drowsily feeling the warmth of the fire, and I heard Frank say: [...] "He's asleep, dead to the world!" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{was confronted}} by the {{possibility}} of passing the night there, and calming my fears as best I could, hastily felt for my matches and knife. The prospect of being lost the next day in a white forest was also appalling, but I soon reassured myself that the storm was only a <b>snow</b> <b>squall,</b> and would not last long. Then I gave myself up to the pleasure and beauty of it. I could only faintly discern the dim trees; the limbs of the spruce, which partially protected me, sagged down to my head with their burden; I had but to reach out my hand for a snowball. Both the wind and snow seemed warm. The great flakes were like swan feathers on a summer breeze. There was something joyous in the whirl of snow and roar of wind. While I bent over to shake my holster, the storm passed as suddenly as it had come. When I looked up, there were the pines, like pillars of Parian marble, and a white shadow, a vanishing cloud fled, with receding roar, on the wings of the wind. Fast on this retreat burst the warm, bright sun.|$|E
60|$|This {{plan was}} decided upon, and so, when the <b>snow</b> <b>squall</b> was entirely {{over and the}} sun had come out Marco and Forester, taking their {{departure}} from the great tree and guiding their course by the sun, the travelers set out, proceeding as nearly {{in a straight line}} as possible, intending to go on in that manner until they should come to some stream, and then to follow the stream down to the river. The plan succeeded perfectly well. They soon descended into a valley, where they found a little brook flowing over a bed of moss-covered stones. They followed this brook down for about a mile, when they came to a junction between the brook that they were following and another one. After this junction of course the stream was larger, and in many places they found it difficult to get along. The way was encumbered with bushes, rocks, and fallen trees, and in one place the stream flowed in a foaming torrent through the bottom of a deep chasm, with sides rising directly out of the water. Here the travelers were obliged to find a way at a distance from the brook--guiding themselves, however, by the sound of its roaring. After passing the chasm, they got back to the stream again.|$|E
