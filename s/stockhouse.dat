The quaint village included St. Alphonsus School, Piche's store, and a local cafe that served what was {{widely regarded as the}} best fish and chips {{to be found in the}} larger metropolitan area of Montreal. Bus no. 2A, driven by Roland ("Flirt") Desourdie, served the community, which was home to over 300 families. Greater Montreal was preparing for Expo 67, leaving the fate of the village—deemed an embarrassment by the city of Montreal and mayor Jean Drapeau—in doubt. The city compiled a report analyzing the living conditions in the area, which referred to a variety of drawbacks to the living conditions, which varied from many houses having no bathroom windows, to the wicked stench that came from the <b>stockhouses</b> in the area.http://coolopolis.blogspot.com/2007/06/goose-village-rip.html Campaigns were undertaken to save the village, but behind the scenes political manoeuvers had doomed the town from the start.|$|R
