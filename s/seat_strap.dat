25|$|The bassoon is held diagonally {{in front}} of the player, but unlike the flute, oboe and clarinet, it cannot be easily {{supported}} by the player's hands alone. Some means of additional support is usually required; the most common ones are a <b>seat</b> <b>strap</b> attached {{to the base of the}} boot joint, which is laid across the chair seat prior to sitting down, or a neck strap or shoulder harness attached to the top of the boot joint. Occasionally a spike similar to those used for the cello or the bass clarinet is attached to the bottom of the boot joint and rests on the floor. It is possible to play while standing up if the player uses a neck strap or similar harness, or if the <b>seat</b> <b>strap</b> is tied to the belt. Sometimes a device called a balance hanger is used when playing in a standing position. This is installed between the instrument and the neck strap, and shifts the point of support closer to the center of gravity, adjusting the distribution of weight between the two hands.|$|E
50|$|The B8 came {{equipped}} with a large fuel tank (chrome with bike color), chrome front fender, a seat capable of holding two with a <b>seat</b> <b>strap,</b> a small luggage rack (optional), down-swept exhaust, a painted speedometer built into the headlight, body work hiding the framework {{in the form of}} extended and large matching color rear fender, matching color large right and left side compartments with covers, and matching color wide swing arms supporting the shock assembly. Later versions had an enclosed chain guard. It was available in either black, maroon, Balboa blue, red.|$|E
50|$|The reed is {{considerably}} {{larger than the}} bassoon's, at 65 - 75 mm in total length (and 20 mm in width) as compared to 53 - 58 mm for most bassoon reeds. The large blades allow ample vibration that produces the low register of the instrument. The contrabassoon reed is similar to an average bassoon's in that scraping the reed affects both the intonation and response of the instrument. The fingering of the contrabassoon is slightly different {{than that of the}} bassoon, particularly at the register change and in the extreme high range. The instrument is twice as long, curves around on itself twice, and, due to its weight and shape, is supported by an endpin rather than a <b>seat</b> <b>strap.</b> Additional support is sometimes given by a strap around the player's neck. A wider hand position is also required, as the primary finger keys are widely spaced. The contrabassoon has a water key to expel condensation and a tuning slide for gross pitch adjustments. The instrument comes in a few pieces (plus bocal); some models cannot be disassembled without a screwdriver. Sometimes, however, the bell can be detached, and instruments with a low A extension often come in two parts.|$|E
50|$|The {{stock was}} {{refurbished}} by Bombardier Transportation between 1995 and 2000. Changes included {{the removal of}} transverse <b>seating,</b> <b>strap</b> hangers replaced with grab bars, new floor material and a full repaint into London Underground's corporate livery.|$|R
50|$|For Group 2/3 seats {{there is}} a system called ISOFIT which anchors the seat to the vehicle so it cannot slide around when not in use. In the case of Isofit, the child is held into the seat using the vehicle's {{existing}} seat belt system, not the safety <b>seat's</b> <b>straps.</b>|$|R
50|$|Tail {{bags are}} {{typically}} soft bags mounted over the pillion <b>seat</b> via <b>straps,</b> {{and are available}} in various sizes. Due to the mounting location, a motorcycle with a tail bag cannot also carry a passenger on the pillion seat.|$|R

50|$|The {{interior}} has a light gray color scheme. As {{with the}} earlier 3150 series, individual seats are 470 mm wide. They are upholstered with a blue moquette. The seats use a cantilever structure, i.e. attached to the walls, and in each car there is one folding <b>seat.</b> The <b>straps</b> are 1,630 mm from the floor.|$|R
5000|$|Drag Extraction is {{the lightest}} and {{simplest}} egress system available, {{and has been}} used on many experimental aircraft. Halfway between simply [...] "bailing out" [...] and using explosive-eject systems, Drag Extraction uses the airflow past the aircraft (or spacecraft) to move the aviator out of the cockpit {{and away from the}} stricken craft on a guide rail. Some operate like a standard ejector seat, by jettisoning the canopy, then deploying a drag chute into the airflow. That chute pulls the occupant out of the aircraft, either with the seat or following release of the <b>seat</b> <b>straps,</b> who then rides off the end of a rail extending far enough out to help clear the structure. In the case of the Space Shuttle, the astronauts would have ridden a long, curved rail, blown by the wind against their bodies, then deployed their chutes after free-falling to a safe altitude.|$|R
5000|$|Lippe and Angelo, the bandaged man, {{are part}} of SPECTRE'S plot. Angelo's face was surgically altered to match the {{appearance}} of François Derval, a French Air Force pilot slated to fly on a training mission aboard an RAF strategic jet bomber Avro Vulcan loaded with two atomic bombs. Derval is murdered by Angelo, who then tries to extort more money for his services from SPECTRE. Agent Fiona Volpe seemingly acquiesces to his demands and he takes Derval's place on the flight. On the flight, Angelo gasses {{the remainder of the}} crew, hijacks the plane and executes a controlled water landing near the Bahamas, submerging the jet. The atomic bombs are retrieved by SCUBA-equipped SPECTRE operatives, commanded by Largo. Angelo, trapped by his <b>seat</b> <b>strapping,</b> is killed by Largo for reneging on his original deal with SPECTRE. Meanwhile, Bond has uncovered Derval's corpse at the sanatorium. Bond is later attacked by Lippe, who is murdered by Volpe as punishment for failing to foresee Angelo's greed.|$|R
5000|$|The {{concrete}} floor was floating, supported by springs and shock absorbers. Once <b>seated</b> and <b>strapped</b> into the contoured seats, this design would protect the occupants from the forces {{generated by the}} explosion of the rocket on the hardstand above, estimated by NASA engineers to be a fireball 430 m wide, which would burn for 40 seconds, reaching temperatures of 2500 F. The bunker could withstand a blast pressure of [...] and 75G of acceleration.|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of {{strapping}} rowers to their sliding seat on performance during 75 m on-water starting trials was investigated. Well-trained rowers performed 75 m maximum-effort starts using an instrumented single scull equipped with a redesigned sliding seat system, both under normal conditions and while strapped to the sliding <b>seat.</b> <b>Strapping</b> rowers to their sliding seat resulted in a 0. 45 s lead after 75 m, corresponding {{to an increase in}} average boat velocity of about 2. 5 %. Corresponding effect sizes were large. No significant changes were observed in general stroke cycle characteristics. No indications of additional boat heaving and pitching under strapped conditions were found. The increase in boat velocity is estimated to correspond to an increase in average mechanical power output during the start of on-water rowing between 5 % and 10 %, which is substantial but smaller than the 12 % increase found in a previous study on ergometer starting. We conclude that, after {{a very short period of}} adaptation to the strapped condition, single-scull starting performance is substantially improved when the rower is strapped to the sliding seat...|$|R
60|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{singular}} {{thing about the}} dragon's appearance at this time {{was the fact that}} he had a row of seats attached to his back, one seat for each member of the party. These seats were double, with curved backs, so that two could sit in them, and there were twelve of these double <b>seats,</b> all <b>strapped</b> firmly around the dragon's thick body and placed one behind the other, in a row that extended from his shoulders nearly to his tail.|$|R
5000|$|The Italia was {{powered by}} Hudson's [...] "Twin H" [...] 202 CID L L-head {{straight}} 6, with higher (8:1) compression and dual one-barrel (single choke) downdraft carburetors, producing [...] {{and all were}} equipped with a 3-speed manual transmission with a column-mounted gear shift lever. The cars featured drum brakes front and rear. The trunk was accessible only from inside the car {{as part of a}} large luggage platform behind the <b>seats</b> with <b>straps</b> to hold cargo and lockable storage compartments {{on either side of the}} platform.|$|R
500|$|Lippe and Angelo, the bandaged man, {{are part}} of SPECTRE'S plot. Angelo's face was surgically altered to match the {{appearance}} of François Derval, a French Air Force pilot slated to fly on a training mission aboard an RAF strategic jet bomber Avro Vulcan loaded with two atomic bombs. Derval is murdered by Angelo Palazzi, who then tries to extort more money for his services from SPECTRE. Agent Fiona Volpe seemingly acquiesces to his demands and he takes Derval's place on the flight. On the flight, Angelo gasses {{the remainder of the}} crew, hijacks the plane, and executes a controlled water landing near the Bahamas, submerging the jet. The atomic bombs are retrieved by SCUBA-equipped SPECTRE operatives, commanded by Largo. Angelo, trapped by his <b>seat</b> <b>strapping,</b> is killed by Largo for reneging on his original deal with SPECTRE. Meanwhile, Bond has uncovered Derval's corpse at the sanatorium. Bond is later attacked by Lippe, who is killed by a rocket-propelled grenade launched by a motorcycle as punishment for failing to foresee Angelo's greed. The motorcycle's fully masked rider later pushes it into the water, after which the rider is revealed to be Volpe as she had removed her leather mask, [...] goggles, and gloves, and was removing her headgear.|$|R
50|$|All 117 series {{cars were}} {{originally}} equipped with reversible transverse <b>seats,</b> but lacked <b>strap</b> hangers. The interior had wood trim intended {{to set the}} 117 apart from other suburban trains. The cars feature flat ceilings joined to the walls and an angled panel above the luggage rack.|$|R
50|$|Qualifying in Spain, at the Jerez circuit near Seville, was {{marred by}} a serious {{incident}} involving Martin Donnelly. During a hot lap on the Friday, the Northern Irishman suffered a suspension failure {{on one of the}} fastest corners of the circuit, sending his Lotus into the barriers head-on. The car was destroyed while Donnelly was thrown across the track with his <b>seat</b> still <b>strapped</b> to his back; he suffered severe leg fractures and bruising on his brain and lungs. Remarkably, he survived, though his Formula One career was over.|$|R
50|$|The {{cable is}} fixed {{at both ends}} and runs through one or more pulleys {{attached}} to the car. The car basically consists of anything from a handle for the passenger to grip on, or a bucket for transporting small items, to a fairly elaborate construction that may include a <b>seat,</b> a safety <b>strap</b> or a box with a lid.|$|R
50|$|The daughter's and mother's arms {{represent}} {{the two parts}} of a seat belt. The film was made for a British audience; cars are driven on the left hand {{side of the road}} in the UK and so the positioning of the mother's arms reflects the position of the upper <b>seat</b> belt <b>strap</b> for a driver in the UK. Similarly, the father turns the wheel to the left (the shoulder part of the road in the UK) to avoid the oncoming danger. If the film was shown in mirror image, it would correct these apparent inconsistencies for audiences in those parts of the world where cars are driven on the right hand side.|$|R
50|$|Waveski surfing is {{a dynamic}} sport {{combining}} the paddle power of a sit on top kayak with the manoeuvrability and performance of a surfboard. A Waveski resembles a larger surfboard, {{with the addition of}} a <b>seat,</b> fins, foot <b>straps,</b> and <b>seat</b> belt, enabling the rider to 'eskimo roll' if overturned. The waveski rider or waveski surfer uses a double ended kayak paddle for motion while seated in the waveski.|$|R
50|$|One day, while {{alone in}} the playroom, Robert discovers {{a hole in the}} wall behind a large wardrobe. The hole leads to a dusty store room that {{contains}} what they first think is a gray hose but which {{turns out to be the}} trunk of Holger, the elephant, who is locked in the next room and is sticking his trunk through a hole in the door. Holger tells the children about Crown Day, an impending holiday in which he will be forced cart the king around in the Royal Litter (a box-like <b>seat</b> which <b>straps</b> to Holger's back) so that all the animals may see and honor the king. The children suggest the idea of stealing the king's crown, though no one ventures a specific plan.|$|R
50|$|In 2008, MasterCraft Safety {{purchased}} Ryan Safety, {{expanding their}} product line of suspension <b>seats,</b> restraints, limit <b>straps,</b> and window nets to include race suits. In 2010 the company expanded even further, acquiring Impact Products from Bill Simpson. The addition of Impact allowed MasterCraft Safety {{to offer a}} complete suite of safety products including helmets, fire-resistant gloves, and race shoes. This move helped accelerate Pierce’s vision of offering a full suite of safety products from one manufacturer, head to toe.|$|R
5000|$|The Vixens bring Pete, Andy and Joe to {{a dinner}} table, at which Patrick is already <b>seated.</b> They are <b>strapped</b> to chairs and hooked to {{intravenous}} drips. They are served blood wine, hookahs and snuffable colored powder resembling cocaine. The women then serve them cobbler, fruit and Patrick's organs. The drugs make them believe they are dancing with their captors and naked women wearing bloody animal masks, yet are left still bound to their chairs. The briefcase is delivered to a vehicle with the license plate [...] "RATATAT".|$|R
500|$|The cockpit was {{severely}} damaged in the impact. It struck {{an oak tree}} which penetrated the area occupied by Klotz and Moyano. All the seats occupied by the flight crew were found outside the cockpit. Neither of the pilots' <b>seats</b> had shoulder <b>straps</b> as were required by United States domestic passenger flights. At least one flight crew member was airlifted to Nassau County Medical Center. The NTSB report states {{that all of the}} flight crew [...] "died from blunt force head and upper torso trauma." [...] Five flight attendants also died from blunt force trauma to the limbs, abdomen, chest, and head.|$|R
50|$|The car was {{supplied}} with an {{adjustable steering column}} and body insulation. It comfortably carried four passengers with room for a small fifth passenger in {{the centre of the}} back seat. Even the quarter-lights were {{supplied with}} blinds, there were flush fitting footrests {{in the back of the}} large, adjustable, front <b>seats</b> with pull <b>straps</b> above. The back floor was flat except for the somewhat pronounced propellor shaft tunnel. The boot was provided with a fitted suitcase, the spare wheel sitting horizontally in the space below. The door could be let down and used as a luggage platform.|$|R

50|$|A five-point harness {{is a form}} of {{seat belt}} that {{contains}} five straps that are mounted to the car frame. It has been engineered for an increase of safety in the occurrence of an automobile accident. As a result, this form of seat belt has been mandated in the race car competition of NASCAR. This was an invention made mandatory to have due to the high velocities involved in the sport. Along with the design of the <b>seat</b> belt, helmet <b>straps</b> have been designed to increase the safety of the driver. This invention has also been used to secure infants and young children in child safety seats.|$|R
50|$|A {{high chair}} {{is a piece}} of {{furniture}} used for feeding older babies and younger toddlers. The seat is raised a fair distance from the ground, so that a person of adult height may spoon-feed the child comfortably from a standing position (hence the name). It often has a wide base to increase stability. There is a tray which is attached to the arms of the high chair, which allows the adult to place the food on it for either the child to pick up and eat or for the food to be spoon-fed to them. High chairs typically have <b>seat</b> belts to <b>strap</b> the child in.|$|R
5000|$|In {{anticipation}} of the festivities, police and emergency services officials begin their preparations for Black Friday early in December. Ambulance trusts around the country plan and set up mobile [...] "drunk tanks" [...] in city centers to help lighten the load on hospitals and police cells. Some of the higher end mobile units can treat up to 11 people at a time with eight beds, <b>seats</b> with restraint <b>straps</b> and two showers, and can cost up to £500,000. In Manchester, temporary metal detectors, or [...] "knife arches," [...] are erected in the busiest {{parts of the city}} to assure the public that no weapons of any kind will be tolerated.|$|R
2500|$|Sling Shot: A {{bungee cord}} ride {{in which two}} riders sat in a <b>seat</b> and were <b>strapped</b> in while the ride was shot {{up in the air}} and {{supported}} by a bungee cord. Riders looped upside down. There are a few similar rides still standing in a handful of major amusement parks, the most common name being the Slingshot found at many Six Flags parks, but they are upcharge attractions (an additional charge to admission) due to insurance issues. At Action Park, the extra fee was only $5. This particular ride was open from 1993 to 1995. [...] "We often wondered how many whiplash cases came out of that ride", one former employee recalled.|$|R
50|$|On the 4-door hardtop, {{the front}} driver and {{passenger}} <b>seat</b> belt shoulder <b>strap</b> was connected {{at the top}} to the ceiling, however, the upper portion could be detached, with the shoulder strap resting on the driver's and front passenger's shoulder without the seat belt hanging from the ceiling. The upper part would then swing {{up to the ceiling}} and could be fastened into place. This arrangement provided an additional benefit to the rear seat passenger opposite the driver because the front passenger seat could be pushed forward with the head restraint removed, providing the rear seat passengers an unobstructed view through the front windshield, and both side view windows, adding to the luxurious feel of a hardtop luxury sedan.|$|R
50|$|Liquid {{immersion}} {{provides a}} {{way to reduce the}} physical stress of G forces. Forces applied to fluids are distributed as omnidirectional pressures. Because liquids cannot be practically compressed, they do not change density under high acceleration such as performed in aerial maneuvers or space travel. A person immersed in liquid of the same density as tissue has acceleration forces distributed around the body, rather than applied at a single point such as a <b>seat</b> or harness <b>straps.</b> This principle is used in a new type of G-suit called the Libelle G-suit, which allows aircraft pilots to remain conscious and functioning at more than 10 G acceleration by surrounding them with water in a rigid suit.|$|R

6000|$|Some of the {{officers}} tumbled off their seats when Quox struck the ground, {{but most of the}} dragon's passengers only felt a slight jar. All were glad to be on solid earth again and they at once dismounted and began to look about them. Queerly enough, as soon as they had left the dragon, the <b>seats</b> that were <b>strapped</b> to the monster's back disappeared, and this probably happened because there was no further use for them and because Quox looked far more dignified in just his silver scales. Of course he still wore the forty yards of ribbon around his neck, as well as the great locket, but these only made him look [...] "dressed up," [...] as Betsy remarked.|$|R
50|$|As {{the train}} left Banwoldang Station around 9:53 a.m., Kim began fumbling with the cartons and a {{cigarette}} lighter, alarming other passengers {{who tried to}} stop him. In the struggle, one of the cartons spilled and its liquid contents caught fire as the train pulled into Jungangno Station in downtown Daegu. Kim, his back and legs on fire, managed to escape along with many passengers on train 1079, but within two minutes the fire had spread to all six cars. The fire spread quickly in the insulation between the layers of aluminum that form the shell of the cars, the vinyl and plastic materials in <b>seat</b> cushions and <b>strap</b> handles, and heavy plastic matting on the floors, producing thick smoke as it burned.|$|R
50|$|Trim levels offered {{were the}} Brougham, SGL, Grand Edition, GL Grand Edition, GL and the Standard. In June 1984 the Brougham VIP {{appeared}} {{as the top}} level car. The Jack Nicklaus special edition, introduced with the previous edition, was a sales success for the company and continued to be offered as a hardtop and only with a turbocharged engine. Electronically modified air suspension also appeared in June 1984.For the four-door hardtop, the front driver and passenger <b>seat</b> belt shoulder <b>strap</b> was connected at the top to the ceiling, however, the upper portion could be detached, with the shoulder strap resting on the driver's and passenger's shoulder so that rear passengers could have an unobstructed view from the rear seat without the seat belt hanging from the ceiling. The upper part would then swing {{up to the ceiling}} and could be fastened into place.|$|R
