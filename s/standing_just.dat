500|$|Tristan {{was a dark}} {{chestnut}} horse <b>standing</b> <b>just</b> under [...] high, bred by Robert St Clair-Erskine, 4th Earl of Rosslyn at the Easton Stud near Great Dunmow in Essex. As a yearling, Tristan {{was bought}} by the French owner C. J. Lefevre, who sent the colt to be trained by Tom Jennings at the Phantom House stable at Newmarket, Suffolk. Jennings would later say that Tristan had been mistreated as a yearling before his arrival at Newmarket and this explained his well-known temperament problems. Tristan was ridden in most of his races by George Fordham and came to show a strong and sometimes violent dislike for other jockeys.|$|E

500|$|The {{accident}} occurred {{south of}} Valemount, [...] east {{of a small}} station named Canoe River, [...] westbound from Cedarside. The crash {{took place on the}} only stretch (18-mile (29km) long) of CNR mainline in the mountains not protected by automatic block signals. The leading cars of each train were derailed, while those which {{had been part of the}} troop train were demolished. According to testimony at the inquiry, most of the deaths were caused by steam from the troop train's ruptured boiler penetrating the damaged cars. At the moment of the crash, two soldiers, Gunners William Barton and Roger Bowe, both of Newfoundland, were buying cigarettes at the newsstand aboard the train. The structure of the newsstand shielded them in the crash, and they survived. Their fellow Newfoundlanders, Gunners Joseph Thistle and James A. White, <b>standing</b> <b>just</b> a few feet away, were not shielded by the newsstand and perished.|$|E
500|$|Hallucinations or {{delusions}} {{occur in}} approximately 50% {{of people with}} PD {{over the course of}} the illness, and may herald the emergence of dementia. These range from minor hallucinations – [...] "sense of passage" [...] (something quickly passing beside the person) or [...] "sense of presence" [...] (the perception of something/someone <b>standing</b> <b>just</b> to the side or behind the person) – to full blown vivid, formed visual hallucinations and paranoid ideation. Auditory hallucinations are uncommon in PD, and are rarely described as voices. It is now believed that psychosis is an integral part of the disease. A psychosis with delusions and associated delirium is a recognized complication of anti-Parkinson drug treatment and may also be caused by urinary tract infections (as frequently occurs in the fragile elderly), but drugs and infection are not the only factors, and underlying brain pathology or changes in neurotransmitters or their receptors (e.g., acetylcholine, serotonin) are also thought to play a role in psychosis in PD.|$|E

2500|$|Born in Bromley, Kent, England, {{the son of}} the {{chaplain}} at Bromley College, he was educated at Bromsgrove School and appeared for their first XI in 1866 and 1867. <b>Standing</b> <b>just</b> over [...] and weighing almost , he was a right-handed batsman and a right-round-arm bowler with an eccentric action.

2500|$|Isonomy was a late foal, {{being born}} in May 1875, {{and as a}} result he was, in his early life, smaller and less {{physically}} developed than other colts of his generation. Even in full maturity, he was not a large horse, <b>standing</b> <b>just</b> under 15.2 hands high. He was bred at the Yardley stud near Birmingham by the Graham brothers. When the leading trainer John Porter visited the stud, he was impressed by the colt's lively and assertive character, and determined to buy him. When Isonomy was sent to the yearling sale at Doncaster, Porter was able to acquire him for 320 guineas on behalf of Fredrick [...] Gretton, a brewer with a passion for gambling. Isonomy was ridden in most of his races by Tom Cannon.|$|E
2500|$|A divide erupted {{between two}} factions of the DRT, {{and the general}} public as well, over how the long barracks {{property}} was to be used.

[...] In supporting research, Adina conducted numerous interviews with families and acquaintances of men who died in the Alamo. [...] In 1906 she obtained an affidavit from Juan E.

2500|$|In 1827 {{the first}} school {{building}} was erected. It is still <b>standing</b> <b>just</b> {{west of the}} Presbyterian church and is occupied as a dwelling by James Brocksley. It was built by Rodney Shaw, afterwards a well known citizen of Mansfield, PA. At the raising there was used one and one-half gallons of whiskey, bought of H. Freeborn, of Shaver’s Point—now Lawrenceville—for fifty cents. This school house was also used as a church until 1835. It was built by subscription. One of the early teachers here after {{the adoption of the}} public school system was James Tubbs, who taught in the winter of 1839-40. in the article already quoted from, he says: [...] "I had no blackboard. My only classes were in spelling and reading. Grammar was not a branch of study in my school. In arithmetic I had no class. Each student began and ciphered as far as he or she could in the science of numbers with my assistance. In teaching geography the same method was pursued. Considerable attention was given to penmanship." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{is unclear}} what {{initially}} led {{law enforcement to}} suspect these men, but the investigation began with the arrest of Dylan Adams on unrelated weapons charges. Following this arrest, he told police that he witnessed Bobo alive with his brother at Zach's home following her abduction. An affidavit for a search warrant states that Dylan told authorities that on April 13, 2011, he went to Zach's residence to get his truck. Dylan reportedly [...] "observed Holly Lynn Bobo sitting in a green chair {{in the living room}} wearing a pink t-shirt, with Jason Wayne Autry <b>standing</b> <b>just</b> a few feet away". He also told police Zach was [...] "wearing camouflage shorts, black cut-off-sleeve t-shirt and a pair of green Crocs" [...] shoes. Dylan also said that Zach told him [...] "he had raped Bobo and videotaped it". The alleged videotape has not been found. Dylan later recanted the confession and alleged that he was coerced, but his confession led to the arrests of Zach Adams, Jason Autry, and Shayne Austin. Many of the details contained in the confession were eventually found to be inconsistent with the known evidence, and the narrative presented later in court was vastly different. In early 2017, it was announced that Jason Autry had agreed to testify against Zach in exchange for leniency.|$|E
2500|$|The 7th Bedfords had {{to cross}} a waste full of {{derelict}} and sunken tanks in front of Glencorse Wood, capture ten pillboxes at the south-west corner and fight {{their way through the}} wood to a sunken road parallel to the edge of Nonne Bosschen. The Bedfords assembled close to the Menin road, also on a [...] front and advanced unseen through unmanned German night observation outposts. The first wave was held up momentarily by uncut wire at the German front trench but some troops pressed on through gaps as the others fired into the trench. Glencorse Wood was full of smashed trees, with pillboxes on the highest part and other places, which the British fought through with grenades and bayonets, until they reached the British barrage, now <b>standing</b> <b>just</b> beyond the objective. The Bedfords were isolated, because the right-hand battalion of the 25th Division to the north had been stopped short of its objective and to the south, the 11th Royal Fusiliers had lost many casualties and not gained touch.
