5000|$|Growth {{performance}} is certainly influenced by site conditions and thus {{by the kind}} and degree of site preparation {{in relation to the}} nature of the site. It is important to avoid the assumption that site preparation of a particular designation will have a particular silvicultural outcome. Scarification, for instance, not only covers a wide range of operations that scarify, but also any given way of scarifying can have significantly different results depending on site conditions at the time of treatment. In point of fact, the term is commonly misapplied. Scarification is defined as [...] "Loosening the top soil of open areas, or breaking up the forest floor, in preparation for regenerating by direct seeding or natural seedfall", but the term is often misapplied to practices that include scalping, <b>screefing,</b> and blading, which pare off low and surface vegetation, together with most off its roots to expose a weed-free surface, generally in preparation for sowing or planting thereon.|$|E
40|$|Five {{planting}} methods, using mattock and planting-bar, {{were tested}} to determine superiority in production, survival, growth and establishment costs, in north-central British Columbia. Observations were continued for four growing seasons. The mattock {{is a better}} tool than the planting-bar. There {{was no evidence that}} <b>screefing</b> increased survival or growth. Non-screefed slit-hole mattock-planting resulted in the greatest production per man-day at significantly lower costs per established seed 1 i ng. W The principal impedance to seedling survival was smothering and competition for light by vegetation. On dense vegetation sites, machine scarification may be necessary, as the amount of reduction achieved by hand <b>screefing</b> provided no significant improvement. Operational scale trials are recomended before the method is employed on general reforestation programs, to confirm the economic superiority of non-screefed mattock-planting in centralinterior spruce sites obtained under research techniques.

40|$|Wildfire {{and logging}} are common {{disturbances}} {{in the forests}} of northwestern North America, causing changes in soil chemistry and microbiology, including fungal and nitrogen-cycling bacterial communities. These organisms play key roles in nutrient cycling, and affect the regeneration of tree seedlings after disturbance. We studied the effects of wildfire and logging on fungal and nitrogen-cycling communities in the rhizosphere of 16 month-old Douglas-fir seedlings as they regenerated in burned and logged soils. Seeds were planted against root windows that were set up vertically in the soil, with a removable front panel used to access the seedling rhizosphere soil surface. Windows were established in control, lightly burned, and severely burned plots, {{as well as two}} types of logged plots (clearcut and <b>screefed</b> clearcut). Soil scrapings from the root windowâ€“soil interface were taken and the structure of fungal and nitrogen-cycling communities was resolved using length-heterogeneity PCR (LH-PCR) of fungal nuclear ribosomal RNA genes, and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis of nifH and nosZ genes. We found striking differences in the community structure of fungal, denitrifying, and N-fixing communities in response to burning and logging. With the exception of clearcut and <b>screefed</b> clearcut, which were generally similar, each treatment had a unique impact on community structure for these genes. Burning and logging also impacted the relative richness and evenness of these communities. Fungal relative richness and evenness increased in response to logging and severe burning, while denitrifier relative richness and evenness increased in all disturbance treatments, and N-fixing bacterial relative richness and evenness decreased in response to burning. The greatest differences in microbial community structure, relative richness, and evenness were found in the comparisons of lightly burned and logged treatments. The results suggest that the presence of an intact forest floor influences soil microbial communities less than the presence of living trees...|$|R
