25|$|Thirdly, covetousness is {{the third}} worldly evil, which {{is also known as}} lust. Colet calls this a plague that has {{overtaken}} many priests and blinded many.

Paul called covetousness the root of all evils. From it, benefices <b>stack</b> <b>up,</b> including pensions and tithes.

Phinney crossed the line in an ambulance, receiving medical attention before making his way onto the rostrum. The incident itself was started by Roberto Ferrari clipping Mark Cavendish – the winner of the second stage – causing Cavendish to fall {{and the rest of the}} field to <b>stack</b> <b>up</b> behind. Race organisers saw fit to demote Ferrari on the stage results, penalise him on both time – 30 seconds penalty on the general classification – and a 25-point deduction, while he was fined also. Ferrari was remorseful at the time of the crash, but later apologised to Cavendish and other riders involved.|$|E

Ferrari, who had finished the stage ninth, was demoted to the end of the stage results, fined, and was penalised 30 seconds in the general classification and 25 points in the points classification; a decision that his team boss Gianni Savio had no qualms about, although Ferrari was remorseless when reflecting about his actions.

2500|$|The {{continental}} hotspot activity {{began as}} early as the Oligocene, although the basalt in the area dates primarily from the Miocene to the Lower Pleistocene and, in places, to the Holocene. Due to the comparatively slow movement of the African plate—between [...] per year since the Oligocene—there is no relationship between the age of the volcanoes and their dimensions, geographic distribution or alignment, similar to the Hawaiian–Emperor and Cook-Austral seamount chains. This phenomenon is also seen in Martian volcanoes, particularly Elysium Mons. The volcanic activity has created trap basalt formations that extend tens of kilometers and <b>stack</b> <b>up</b> to [...] thick. A system of regional faults, although partially obscured by the volcanic product, has two distinct orientations: a NNE-SSW alignment that could be an extension of Cameroon line, and a NNW-SSE alignment that could extend to the Great Rift Valley; however, the relationship between these fault systems has not been conclusively demonstrated. More recently in geologic time, the volcanic activity has deposited dacite and ignimbrite, as well as trachyte and trachyandesite. This trend towards the production of more felsic, viscous lavas could be a sign of a waning mantle plume.|$|E

There, he tries to relax, but is increasingly tense. He says nothing to anyone about having been on the lake, or about what happened there. Meanwhile, Alice's body is discovered, and her death is treated as a murder investigation almost from the first moment, while an abundant amount of evidence and witness reports <b>stack</b> <b>up</b> against George. Just as Angela's father approves Angela's marriage to him, George is arrested and charged with Alice's murder. Though the viewer knows that the planned murder in fact turned into an accidental drowning, George's furtive actions before, and after, Alice's death condemn him. His denials are futile, and he is found guilty of murder and sentenced to death in the electric chair. Near the end, he confesses to the priest in his cell that, although he did not kill Alice, he didn't act as to save her, during the few dramatic moments when he could have, because he was thinking of Angela. Then, the priest states that, in his heart, it was murder.|$|E

However, this proves to be Willy's undoing, after Mark correctly surmises that his real motive {{is to put the}} stolen money in an off-shore account under a false name. The evidence continues to <b>stack</b> <b>up</b> when Pauline discovers counterfeit credit cards on Willy. Willy is eventually arrested and charged, and Arthur is cleared. However, before the family can pass on the good news, they are told that Arthur has been involved in a huge prison riot. Arthur is released the next day, but he had received a nasty blow to the head in the riot, although no one realises the seriousness of his injury until it is too late. A few days after his release in May 1996, Arthur suffers a brain haemorrhage on the allotments, and dies the next day in hospital. Arthur's funeral is delayed pending an inquest, but the jury eventually returns a verdict of accidental death, much to the disgust of Mark and Pauline, who believe that the prison services neglected to seek proper medical help for Arthur. A bench is placed in dedication to his memory in Albert Square; the dedication is entitled [...] "Arthur Fowler: He loved this place".

[...] Television Without Pity describes Battlestar Galactica as [...] "one of the finest, most beautifully written, expertly acted shows on television." [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger writes: [...] "hat makes Galactica so gripping is its emphasis on character over hardware.
