However, {{it is difficult to}} quantify the stirring effect directly, thus its control is mostly dominated by manual procedures. In the case of bottom gas stirring in secondary steelmaking, the <b>stirring</b> <b>often</b> creates a disturbance {{at the top of the}} vessel which is called “ladle eye” or “spout eye” and can be observed by the operators. Furthermore, the stirring process also generates sound and vibration signals which are closely related to each other. In practice, operators make judgements about the process through visual observation and listening to the sound in order to determine their following procedures. In this study, we gathered image, sound and vibration data from cold model experiments, and established techniques for analysing the combined signals by applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) techniques. The result shows that the dominant principal component derived from the combined signals does capture the great majority of the variation in the system and that online analysis of the stirring process is feasible using this latent variable...|$|E

This centralized ownership structure allows speedy decision-making while <b>often</b> <b>stirring</b> controversies.|$|R

The reckless and the gay, younger sons, soldiers unemployed, and students from the inns of court, early sought advancement and adventure in the more southern provinces, where slaves offered impunity from labor, and where war, with a bolder and more <b>stirring</b> policy, <b>oftener</b> gave rise to scenes of excitement, and, of course, to the exercise of the faculties best suited to their habits and dispositions. The more grave, and the religiously-disposed, found refuge in the colonies of New-England.

40|$|To {{address the}} current {{limitations}} of enzymatic reactions, we develop a novel strategy to conduct stirring-free biphasic enzymatic reactions. This strategy involves translation {{of a conventional}} biphasic enzymatic reaction to a water-in-oil (W/O) Pickering emulsion system by adding {{a small amount of}} solid particle emulsifier. In such a system, enzymes, for example, a Candida Antarctica lipase B (CALB), are compartmentalized within millions of micron-sized water droplets, while organic substrates are dissolved in the oil phase (outside the droplets). It was demonstrated that CALB-catalyzed hydrolysis kinetic resolution of racemic esters in the stirring-free Pickering emulsion system gave favorable reaction efficiency and enantioselectivity as compared to those for the conventional biphasic system under stirring conditions, which was due to the large reaction interfacial area and the short molecule distances created by the Pickering emulsion droplets. The specific activity was found to depend on the water droplet size, highlighting the importance of the presence of droplets in the reaction system. Moreover, the convenient and effective recycling of CALB could be achieved through simple demulsification by centrifugation. After 27 reaction cycles, the ee values of ester and alcohol were still as high as 87. 5 % and 99 %, respectively, which significantly exceed those of the conventional biphasic reaction. The high recyclability may be attributed to avoiding <b>stirring</b> that <b>often</b> causes damage to the three-dimensional structure of enzymes. This study compellingly demonstrates that a Pickering emulsion is an innovative platform to efficiently process enzymatic reactions without need for stirring and immobilization...|$|R

Meeker, never one to miss an opportunity, formed his own hop brokerage business. In 1870, he penned an 80-page pamphlet, Washington Territory West of the Cascades, to promote investment in the region. He took ship for San Francisco, then journeyed east by the new transcontinental railroad, hoping to get the railroads to expand to his region. He met with newspaper editor Horace Greeley (known for his famous advice, [...] "Go West, young man") and with railroad mogul Jay Cooke as part of his promotional blitz. Cooke, who was building the Northern Pacific Railway to cross the northern tier of the country, not only bought up Meeker's pamphlets to give away to potential investors, but hired Meeker to drum up interest in his railroad. While working from a Manhattan office, Meeker dressed like city dwellers, but did not entirely lose his frontier habits, <b>often</b> <b>stirring</b> a lump of butter into his coffee.|$|R

There was nothing however, otherwise, in the appearance of the establishment, which indicated that Mr. Toad's progress was very rapid, or his professional career extraordinarily prosperous. In an outward office one solitary clerk was seen, <b>oftener</b> <b>stirring</b> his office fire than wasting his master's ink; and Mr. Toad was known by his brother attorneys as a gentleman who was not recorded in the courts as ever having conducted a single cause.

40|$|A Clinical Paper Submitted In Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements For the Degree of Master of Science in Nursing Family Nurse PractitionerNurses are {{the primary}} {{caregivers}} for patients while in the hospital. Regrettably, stable patients often experience complications that were otherwise unanticipated. Often times, patients die and the nurse is left to cope alone and {{try to understand the}} emotional <b>stirrings</b> that are <b>often</b> unsettling. While many studies focus on improving patient quality of care provided by the nurse, few, if any, examine the nurse and the perspective they may have on the dynamic healthcare environment and unexpected patient deaths. Grief is common among nurses and is often heartfelt when a patient dies, but that grief is often ignored (Brosche, 2007). The negative impact of this phenomenon may lead to nurses experiencing moral issues, specifically moral distress as well as compassion fatigue. The emotional reaction of nurses who experience a patient?s death that was unexpected has largely been unexamined. The {{purpose of this study is}} to describe the lived experience of nurses who care for patients who unexpectedly die. The research question is; what is the lived experience of nurses who encounter the unexpected death of a patient? The theoretical framework that provides the foundation for this study is Lazarus' theory of stress, coping and adaptation along with Spiegelberg's approach to understanding phenomenon as lived by the person experiencing the phenomenon. A naturalistic paradigm coupled with a descriptive phenomenological approach was used in order to describe the meaning of the experience many nurses face when exposed to patients deaths. The participants for this study are nurses that are currently employed in a hospital setting and have experienced this phenomenon. Data analysis consisted of Spiegelberg's method of interpretation of the qualitative data...|$|R
60|$|The {{account of}} a petrifying quality in the earth here, though some will have it {{to be in the}} water of a spring hard by, is very strange. They boast that their town is walled and their streets paved with clay, and yet that one is as strong and the other as clean as those that are built or paved with stone. The fact is indeed true, for there is a sort of clay in the cliff, between the town and the Beacon Hill adjoining, which, when it falls down into the sea, where it is beaten with the waves and the weather, turns {{gradually}} into stone. But the chief reason assigned is from the water of a certain spring or well, which, rising in the said cliff, runs down into the sea among those pieces of clay, and petrifies them as it runs; and the force of the sea <b>often</b> <b>stirring,</b> and perhaps turning, the lumps of clay, when storms of wind may give force enough to the water, causes them to harden everywhere alike; otherwise those which were not quite sunk in the water of the spring would be petrified but in part. These stones are gathered up to pave the streets and build the houses, and are indeed very hard. It is also remarkable that some of them taken up before they are thoroughly petrified will, upon breaking them, appear to be hard as a stone without and soft as clay in the middle; whereas others that have lain a due time shall be thorough stone to the centre, and as exceeding hard within as without. The same spring is said to turn wood into iron. But this I take to be no more or less than the quality, which, as I mentioned of the shore at the Naze, is found to be in much of the stone all along this shore, viz., of the copperas kind; and it is certain that the copperas stone (so called) is found in all that cliff, and even where the water of this spring has run; and I presume that those who call the hardened pieces of wood, which they take out of this well by the name of iron, never tried the quality of it with the fire or hammer; if they had, perhaps they would have given some other account of it.|$|R
