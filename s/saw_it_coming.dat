500|$|Ken Tucker {{summarized}} Hartman's comedic style: [...] "He could momentarily fool audiences {{into thinking}} he was the straight man, but then he'd cock an eyebrow and give his voice an ironic lilt that delivered a punchline like a fast slider—you barely <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>coming</b> until you started laughing." [...] Hartman claimed that he borrowed his style from actor Bill Murray: [...] "He's been a great influence on me – when he did that smarmy thing in Ghostbusters, then {{the same sort of}} thing in Groundhog Day. I tried to imitate it. I couldn't. I wasn't good enough. But I discovered an element of something else, so in a sick kind of way I made myself a career by doing a bad imitation of another comic." ...|$|E
500|$|Peckinpah's {{intake of}} alcohol {{increased}} dramatically while making The Getaway, {{and he was}} fond of saying, [...] "I can't direct when I'm sober." [...] He and McQueen got into occasional heated arguments during filming. The director recalled one such incident {{on the first day of}} rehearsal in San Marcos: [...] "Steve and I had been discussing some point on which we disagreed, so he picked up this bottle of champagne and threw it at me. I <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>coming</b> and ducked. And Steve just laughed." [...] McQueen had a knack with props, especially the weapons he used in the film. Hill remembered, [...] "You can see Steve's military training in his films. He was so brisk and confident in the way he handled the guns." [...] It was McQueen's idea to have his character shoot and blow up a squad car in the scene where Doc holds two police officers at gunpoint.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't remonstrate, I simply answer you: I {{must give}} {{some sign of}} intelligence. I <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>coming,</b> and I said nothing. I never meddle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hullo, so {{you have}} fallen into the river!" [...] sang out a man who <b>saw</b> him <b>coming.</b> <b>It</b> was Jack Sooker, the fellow {{mentioned}} by the cemetery keeper's daughter.|$|R
6000|$|... "We did {{everything}} we could to fight him off from it," [...] interrupted Mrs. Elmore, [...] "both of us. We <b>saw</b> that <b>it</b> was <b>coming,</b> {{and we tried to}} stop it. But nothing would help. Perhaps, as he says, he did have to do it." ...|$|R
6000|$|Directly the gazelle <b>saw</b> them <b>coming,</b> <b>it</b> said to its master: 'Your {{father-in-law}} {{is coming}} to meet you; that is he in the middle, wearing a mantle of sky-blue. Get off your horse and go to greet him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You see," [...] he said, [...] "I <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>coming</b> out of Milton's study, {{and that}} must have been about the time the study was ragged. And it went into Rigby's dorm. So {{it must have been a}} chap in that dorm, who did it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Where art thou, Incubu, thou white man, who slewest Scragga my son--see if thou canst slay me!" [...] he shouted, and at {{the same}} time hurled a tolla {{straight}} at Sir Henry, who fortunately <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>coming,</b> and caught it on his shield, which it transfixed, remaining wedged in the iron plate behind the hide.|$|E
60|$|He dragged {{one great}} maul of a fist free and drove {{it at the}} face beneath him. Jim <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>coming</b> and turned his head. The blow fell on his neck and his {{carnivorous}} grin smoothed out as if sleep had suddenly fallen upon him. He drew a long, shuddering breath, his muscles quivered, and his clenched hands fell open.|$|E
25|$|Where Taylor's {{century had}} been workman-like, Waugh's {{was one of}} flair, hitting the {{boundary}} 24 times, and <b>it</b> <b>saw</b> the <b>coming</b> of age of a batman who had struggled in previous series, having not scored a century {{in the first four}} years of his Test career.|$|R
6000|$|... "What's the use?" [...] he retorted. [...] "I <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> was <b>coming</b> a month ago. There {{are some}} fellows out in West Virginia {{that have been}} running the paint {{as hard as they}} could. They couldn't do much; they used {{to put it on the}} market raw. But lately they got to baking it, and now they've struck a vein of natural gas right by their works, and they pay ten cents for fuel, where I pay a dollar, and they make as good a paint. Anybody can see where it's going to end. Besides, the market's over-stocked. It's glutted. There wa'n't {{anything}} to do but to shut DOWN, and I've SHUT down." ...|$|R
60|$|Andrew handed {{back his}} coat and hat to the attendant, and {{followed}} Cecil into the ballroom. In a passage leading to the billiard-room, where several chairs had been arranged for sitting out, Jeanne was ensconced, with two men leaning over her. She waved them away when she <b>saw</b> who <b>it</b> was <b>coming.</b> Without a smile, or the vestige of one, she motioned to Andrew to take the vacant seat by her side.|$|R
60|$|But {{it was the}} {{thunderstorm}} that decided me. When I <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>coming</b> up, {{black and}} quick, from the northwest, I gave in at once. I had endured a good deal and was prepared to endure more; but I had paid ten dollars for my hat and I {{was not going to}} have it ruined by a thunderstorm. I called to Isaac and out he came.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is not {{you who are}} shamed," [...] {{answered}} Freydisa hotly. [...] "It is Steinar and that----," [...] and {{she used}} a harsh word of Iduna. [...] "Oh! I <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>coming,</b> and yet I dared not warn you. I feared lest I might be wrong and put doubts into your heart against your foster-brother and your wife without cause. May Odin destroy them both!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{knew this}} war was coming," [...] said Mrs. Norman triumphantly. [...] "I <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>coming</b> right along. I {{could have told}} all those stupid Englishmen what was ahead of them. I told you, John Meredith, years ago what the Kaiser was up to but you wouldn't believe it. You said he would never plunge the world in war. Who {{was right about the}} Kaiser, John? You--or I? Tell me that." ...|$|E
50|$|On {{the morning}} of 28 September the Dutch fleet, {{approaching}} from the east, had the previous evening been again scattered by a gale and was still dispersed when around noon <b>it</b> <b>saw</b> Blake <b>coming</b> out in force from the south. Having the weather gauge because of a south-south-western breeze, Blake intended to exploit this excellent opportunity for a direct attack on the disordered Dutch.|$|R
60|$|I do {{not believe}} that it is suited for elephants. It lacks energy, it lacks force of character, it lacks bitterness. These things all show in the meekness and {{resignation}} of its expression. It would not attack an elephant, I am sure of it. It might not run if <b>it</b> <b>saw</b> one <b>coming,</b> but <b>it</b> looked to me like a dog that would sit down and pray.|$|R
60|$|But I saw the stroke, and, {{springing}} {{high into}} the air, avoided it. Then I turned and fled very swiftly, and after me came certain of the soldiers. The way was not far to the last company of the People of the Axe; moreover, <b>it</b> <b>saw</b> me <b>coming,</b> and, headed by Umslopogaas, who walked behind them all, ran to meet me. Then the soldiers who followed to kill me hung back {{out of reach of}} the axe.|$|R
60|$|Following {{his gaze}} to the south-west, we <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>coming.</b> It was a cloud- mass that blotted out the {{sunlight}} and the day. It seemed to swell and belch and roll over and over on itself as it advanced with a rapidity that told of enormous wind behind it and in it. Its speed was headlong, terrific; and, beneath it, covering the sea, advancing with it, was a gray bank of mist.|$|E
60|$|So I swam on a {{long way}} and began to forget things; indeed I thought that I was playing in the big turnip field {{with my mother and}} sister. But just as I was sinking {{exhausted}} a hand shot down into the water and caught me by the ears, although from below the fingers looked as though they were bending away from me. I <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>coming</b> and tried to sink more quickly, but could not.|$|E
60|$|One word more, and {{the opening}} chapter of a sylvan Iliad might have begun. But this modern Helen <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>coming,</b> and arrested it with an {{inspiration}} of feminine genius. Without being observed, she disengaged her knife from her bosom and let it fall as if by accident. It struck {{the ground with the}} point of its keen blade, bounded and rolled between them. The two men started and looked at each other with a foolish air. Curson laughed.|$|E
25|$|For Merezhkovsky the October Socialist {{revolution}} was a catastrophe. He <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as the <b>Coming</b> of Ham {{he wrote about}} a decade later, the tragic victory for, as he choose to put it, Narod-Zver (The Beast-nation), {{the political and social}} incarnation of the universal Evil, putting the whole human civilization to danger. Merezhkovsky and Gippius tried to use whatever influence they retained upon the Bolshevist cultural leaders to ensure the release of their friends, the arrested Provisional government ministers. Ironically, one of the first thing the Soviet government did was lift the ban from anti-monarchist Pavel Pervy play and it was staged in several Red Russia's theaters.|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with AbsolutePunk regarding {{the sound of the}} album, rhythm guitarist Mike Kennerty stated [...] "Pop radio is literally just pop music now. There’s no guitars to be found, so we kind of <b>saw</b> that <b>coming.</b> <b>It’s</b> a different place and we made a different record. It’s not like a singles record, it’s actually a record. That was our concentration from when we were recording. We knew we were making a fucking record. Fuck the normal system of singles and all that stuff. Obviously, it’s going to get worked by the label, but we wanted to make something we were proud of as a record, first and foremost, and we did that." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{discovery}} of Fanny's secret seemed {{to show her}} something to do, for if the [...] "wait and see" [...] decision was making her friend unhappy, it must be changed as soon as possible. This finished Polly's indecision, and after that night she never allowed herself to dwell upon the pleasant temptation which came in a guise particularly attractive to a young girl with a spice of the old Eve in her composition. So day after day she trudged through the dull back streets, longing for the sunny park, the face that always brightened when <b>it</b> <b>saw</b> her <b>coming,</b> {{and most of all}} the chance of meeting well, it was n't Trix.|$|R
60|$|Farther {{and farther}} and farther out onto the Green Meadows crept the black shadows. Suddenly one seemed to {{separate}} from the others. Softly, oh so softly, yet swiftly, it floated over towards the Merry Little Breezes. One of them happened to look up and <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>coming.</b> It was the same Little Breeze who one time stayed out all night. When {{he looked up and}} saw this seeming shadow moving so swiftly he knew that it was no shadow at all.|$|E
6000|$|We broke away, {{and he was}} tottering and groggy. He {{staggered}} {{away and}} started to whirl the swing. I <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>coming.</b> I made believe I didn't and started after him in a rush. Biff! It caught me on the jaw, and I went down. I was young and strong. I could eat punishment. I could have got up the first second. But I lay there and let them count me out. And making believe I was still dazed, I let them carry me to my corner and work to bring me to. [Pause.] ...|$|E
6000|$|Away it sped {{while all}} men gazed. High, high it flew, the {{sunlight}} glinting on its polished barb. Down it came at length, and the King muttered [...] "Short!" [...] But while the word passed his lips that shaft seemed to recover itself, as though by magic, and again rushed on. He of the foul words and gestures <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>coming,</b> {{and turned to}} fly. As he leapt forward the war arrow struck him full in the small of the back, just where the spine ends, severing it, so that he fell all of a heap like an ox beneath the axe, and lay a still and huddled shape.|$|E
6000|$|... "Harry {{has just}} told me of it; he was very angry, and I <b>saw</b> <b>it,</b> and made him tell me. Poor boy, he can keep nothing from me. I've been {{dreading}} it, and now <b>it's</b> <b>coming.</b> You don't know it, then? Young Butler {{is in love with}} Bella, and no one has prevented it. Think how wicked when such a curse is on us all." ...|$|R
50|$|First with Dean Jones, {{eventually}} dismissed for 79, {{and with}} Merv Hughes after Ian Healy was dismissed for 16, Waugh battered the English bowling to be 174 not {{out and have}} Australia 580 for 6 at stumps on day two. The bowler Hughes also seemed filled with confidence from Waugh's display and remained with him on 63 not out. The partnership of Waugh and Hughes reached 147, a record for the 7th wicket in England. Where Taylor's century had been workman-like, Waugh's was one of flair, hitting the boundary 24 times, and <b>it</b> <b>saw</b> the <b>coming</b> of age of a batman who had struggled in previous series, having not scored a century {{in the first four}} years of his Test career.|$|R
60|$|Warburton {{held up a}} {{hand and}} impelled Lee to silence. In that gesture Neale read what stirred him to his soul. <b>It</b> was <b>coming.</b> He <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> again in General Lodge's fleeting, rare smile. He held his breath. The old pang throbbed in his breast.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wonder what}} you would do if you saw your friend, your brother, on the {{slippery}} lip of a precipice, slipping, slipping, and you were able to do nothing. That was just it. I could do nothing. I <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>coming,</b> and I could do nothing. My God, man, what could I do? There it was, malignant and incontestable, the mark of the thing on his brow. No one else saw it. It was because I loved him so, I do believe, that I alone saw it. I could not credit the testimony of my senses. It was too incredibly horrible. Yet there it was, on his brow, on his ears. I had seen it, the slight puff of the earlobes--oh, so imperceptibly slight. I watched it for months. Then, next, hoping against hope, the darkening of the skin above both eyebrows--oh, so faint, just like the dimmest touch of sunburn. I should have thought it sunburn but that there was a shine to it, such an invisible shine, like a little highlight seen for a moment and gone the next. I tried to believe it was sunburn, only I could not. I knew better. No one noticed it but me. No one ever noticed it except Stephen Kaluna, and I did not know that till afterward. But I <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>coming,</b> the whole damnable, unnamable awfulness of it; but I refused to think about the future. I was afraid. I could not. And of nights I cried over it.|$|E
60|$|As it grew {{later in}} the night, and {{footsteps}} in the street became so rare that he could hear them coming, count them as they passed, and lose them in the hollow distance, he would lie and watch the many-coloured ring about the candle, and wait patiently for day. His only trouble was, the swift and rapid river. He felt forced, sometimes, {{to try to stop}} it--to stem it with his childish hands--or choke its way with sand--and when he <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>coming</b> on, resistless, he cried out! But a word from Florence, who was always at his side, restored him to himself; and leaning his poor head upon her breast, he told Floy of his dream, and smiled.|$|E
60|$|The vicar was preaching, and the {{congregation}} paid a very languid attention, but suddenly a curious little sound {{went through the}} church--one of those scarcely perceptible noises which no comparison can explain; it was a quick attraction of all eyes, an arousing of somnolent intelligences, a slight, quick drawing-in of the breath. The listeners had heeded very indifferently Mr Gray's admonitions to brotherly love and charity as matters which did not concern them other than abstractedly; but quite suddenly they had realised that he was bringing his discourse round {{to the subject of}} Daisy Griffith, and they pricked up both ears. They <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>coming</b> directly along the highways of Vanity and Luxuriousness; and everyone became intensely wide awake.|$|E
60|$|The face of London was now, indeed, strangely altered: I {{mean the}} whole mass of buildings, city, liberties, suburbs, Westminster, Southwark, and altogether; for {{as to the}} {{particular}} part called the city, or within the walls, that was not yet much infected. But in the whole, the face of things, I say, was much altered. Sorrow and sadness sat upon every face, and though some part were not yet overwhelmed, yet all looked deeply concerned; and as we <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> apparently <b>coming</b> on, so every one looked on {{himself and his family}} as in the utmost danger. Were it possible to represent those times exactly to those that did not see them, and give the reader due ideas of the horror that everywhere presented itself, it must make just impressions upon their minds, and fill them with surprise. London might well be said to be all in tears. The mourners did not go about the streets,[37] indeed; for nobody put on black, or made a formal dress of mourning for their nearest friends: but the voice of mourning was truly heard in the streets. The shrieks of women and children at the windows and doors of their houses, where their nearest relations were perhaps dying, or just dead, were so frequent to be heard as we passed the streets, that it was enough to pierce the stoutest heart in the world to hear them. Tears and lamentations were seen almost in every house, especially {{in the first part of}} the visitation; for towards the latter end, men's hearts were hardened, and death was so always before their eyes that they did not so much concern themselves for the loss of their friends, expecting that themselves should be summoned the next hour.|$|R
60|$|Then {{one bright}} sunny morning {{something}} happened. Johnny Chuck <b>saw</b> <b>it.</b> Jimmy Skunk <b>saw</b> <b>it.</b> Happy Jack Squirrel <b>saw</b> <b>it.</b> Sammy Jay <b>saw</b> <b>it.</b> And they told all the others.|$|R
60|$|She {{had been}} {{listening}} before she knocked! I <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> in her white face, I <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> in her trembling hands, I <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> in her look at Laura.|$|R
