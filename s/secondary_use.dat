40|$|Background: Substantial {{investments}} {{are being made}} in health ­information ­technology (HIT) based on assumptions that these systems will save costs through increased quality, safety and efficiency of care provision. Whilst ­short-term ­benefits have often proven difficult to demonstrate, there is increasing interest in achieving benefits in the medium and long term through <b>secondary</b> <b>uses</b> of ­HIT-derived data. Aims: We aimed to describe the range of <b>secondary</b> <b>uses</b> of HIT-derived data in the international literature and identify innovative developments of particular relevance to UK policymakers and managers. Methods: We searched nine electronic databases to conduct a systematic scoping review of the international literature and augmented this by consulting a range of experts in the field. Results: Reviewers independently screened 16, 806 titles, resulting in 583 ­eligible studies for inclusion. Thematic organisation of reported <b>secondary</b> <b>uses</b> was ­validated during expert consultation (n = 23). A primary division was made between patient-identifiable data and datasets in which individuals were not identified. <b>Secondary</b> <b>uses</b> were then categorised under four domain headings of: i) research; ii) quality and safety of care provision; iii) financial management; and iv) healthcare professional education. We found that innovative developments were most ­evident in research where, in particular, dataset linkage studies offered important ­opportunities for exploitation. Conclusions: Distinguishing patient-identifiable data from aggregated, de-identified datasets gives greater conceptual clarity in <b>secondary</b> <b>uses</b> of HIT-derived data. <b>Secondary</b> <b>uses</b> research has substantial potential for realising future benefits through generating new medical knowledge from dataset linkage studies, developing precision medicine and enabling cross-sectoral, evidence-based policymaking to benefit population-level well-being...|$|R

25|$|A UNESCO World Heritage site since 2005, Tel Be'er Sheva is {{an archaeological}} site in {{southern}} Israel, {{believed to be}} the remains of the biblical town of Be'er Sheva. Archaeological finds indicate that the site was inhabited from the Chalcolithic period, around 4000 BCE, to the 16th century CE. This was probably due to the abundance of underground water, as evidenced by the numerous wells in the area. Excavated by Yohanan Aharoni and Ze'ev Herzog of Tel Aviv University, the settlement itself is dated to the early Israelite period. Probably populated in the 12th century BCE, the first fortified settlement dates to 1000 BCE. The city was likely destroyed by Sennacherib in 700 BCE, and after a habitation hiatus of three hundred years, there is evidence of remains from the Persian, Hellenistic, Roman and Early Arab periods. Major finds include an elaborate water system and a huge cistern carved out of the rock beneath the town, and a large horned altar which was reconstructed using several well-dressed stones found in <b>secondary</b> <b>use</b> in the walls of a later building. The altar attests to the existence of a temple or cult center in the city which was probably dismantled during the reforms of King Hezekiah.|$|E
25|$|In an ontogenetic {{histological}} {{analysis of}} Stegosaurus plates and spikes, Hayashi et al. (2012) examined their {{structure and function}} through juveniles to old adults. They found that throughout the ontogeny, the dorsal osteoderms are composed of dense ossified collagen fibres in both the cortical and cancellous sections of the bone, suggesting that plates and spikes are formed from the direct mineralization of already existing fibrous networks in the skin. However, the many structural features, seen in the spikes and plates of old adults specimens, are acquired {{at different stages of}} development. Extensive vascular networks form in the plates during the change from juveniles to young adults and persist in old adults but spikes acquire a thick cortex with a large axial vascular channel only in old adults. Hayashi et al. argue that the formation of nourishing vascular networks in young adults supported the growth of large plates. This would have enhanced the size of the animal, which may have helped attract mates and deter rivals. Furthermore, the presence of the vascular networks in the plates of the young adult indicate a <b>secondary</b> <b>use</b> of the plates as a thermoregulatory device for heat loss much like the elephant ear, toucan bill or alligator osteoderms. The thickening of the cortical section of the bone and the compaction of bone in the terminal tail-spikes in old adults suggest that they were used as defence weapons, but not until an ontogenetically late stage. The development of the large axial channel in old adults from small canals in young adults, facilitated the further enlargement of the spikes by increasing the amount of nourishment supplied. On the other hand, plates do not show a similar degree of bone compaction or cortical thickening indicating they would not be capable of taking much weight from above. This suggests they were not as important as spikes in active defense.|$|E

2500|$|The Tel Dan Stele is {{a broken}} stele (inscribed stone) {{discovered}} in 1993–94 during excavations at Tel Dan in northern Israel. It consists of several fragments making {{up part of}} a triumphal inscription in Aramaic, left most probably by Hazael of Aram-Damascus, an important regional figure in the late 9thcentury BCE. Hazael (or more accurately, the unnamed king) boasts of his victories over Omri, the king of Israel and his ally {{the king of the}} [...] "House of David" [...] (bytdwd). It is considered the first widely accepted reference to the name David as the founder of a Judahite polity outside of the Hebrew Bible, though the earlier Mesha Stele contains several possible references with varying acceptance. A minority of scholars have disputed the reference to David, {{due to the lack of}} a word divider between byt and dwd, and other translations have been proposed. The stele was not excavated in its primary context, but in its <b>secondary</b> <b>use.</b> The Tel Dan stele is one of four known contemporary inscriptions containing the name of Israel, the others being the Merneptah Stele, the Mesha Stele, and the Kurkh Monolith.|$|E

The Boyds, Lords of Kilmarnock, had their gallows at Gallows-Knowe which stood in Wellington street. Often the mounds were wooded and a dule tree may have been used as the gallows.

40|$|Abstract Background Recent {{changes to}} {{regulatory}} guidance in the US and Europe have complicated oversight of secondary research by rendering most uses of de-identified data exempt from human subjects oversight. To identify {{the implications of}} such guidelines for harms to participants and communities, this paper explores the <b>secondary</b> <b>uses</b> of one de-identified DNA sample collection with limited oversight: the Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP) -Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain, Fondation Jean Dausset (CEPH) Human Genome Diversity Panel. Methods Using a combination of keyword and cited reference search, we identified English-language scientific articles published between 2002 and 2009 that reported analysis of HGDP Diversity Panel samples and/or data. We then reviewed each article to identify the specific research use to which the samples and/or data was applied. <b>Secondary</b> <b>uses</b> were categorized according to the type and kind of research supported by the collection. Results A wide variety of <b>secondary</b> <b>uses</b> were identified from 148 peer-reviewed articles. While {{the vast majority of}} these uses were consistent with the original intent of the collection, a minority of published reports described research whose primary findings could be regarded as controversial, objectionable, or potentially stigmatizing in their interpretation. Conclusions We conclude that potential risks to participants and communities cannot be wholly eliminated by anonymization of individual data and suggest that explicit review of proposed <b>secondary</b> <b>uses,</b> by a Data Access Committee or similar internal oversight body with suitable stakeholder representation, should be a required component of the trustworthy governance of any repository of data or specimens. </p...|$|R

60|$|This design suffers {{much from}} loss of colour in translation. Its {{decorative}} effect {{depends on the}} deep blue ground, relieving the delicate foliage and the local colours of dresses and architecture. It {{is also one of}} those which are most directly opposed to modern feeling: the sympathy of the spectator with the passion of the crowd being somewhat rudely checked by the grotesque action of two of the foremost figures. We ought, however, rather to envy the deep seriousness which could not be moved from dwelling on the real power of the scene by any ungracefulness or familiarity of circumstance. Among men whose minds are rightly toned, nothing is ludicrous: it must, if an act, be either right or wrong, noble or base; if a thing seen, it must either be ugly or beautiful: and what is either wrong or deformed is not, among noble persons, in anywise subject for laughter; but, in the precise degree of its wrongness or deformity, a subject of horror. All perception of what, in the modern European mind, falls under the general head of the ludicrous, is either childish or profane; often healthy, as indicative of vigorous animal life, but always degraded in its relation to manly conditions of thought. It has a <b>secondary</b> <b>use</b> in its power of detecting vulgar imposture; but it only obtains this power by denying the highest truths.|$|E
6000|$|By {{virtue of}} this science the poet is the Namer or Language-maker, naming things {{sometimes}} after their appearance, sometimes after their essence, and giving to every one its own name and not another's, thereby rejoicing the intellect, which delights in detachment or boundary. The poets {{made all the}} words, and therefore language is the archives of history, and, if we must say it, a sort of tomb of the muses. For though the origin of most of our words is forgotten, each word was at first a stroke of genius, and obtained currency because for the moment it symbolized {{the world to the}} first speaker and to the hearer. The etymologist finds the deadest word to have been once a brilliant picture. Language is fossil poetry. As the limestone of the continent consists of infinite masses of the shells of animalcules, so language is made up of images or tropes, which now, in their <b>secondary</b> <b>use,</b> have long ceased to remind us of their poetic origin. But the poet names the thing because he sees it, or comes one step nearer to it than any other. This expression or naming is not art, but a second nature, grown out of the first, as a leaf out of a tree. What we call nature is a certain self-regulated motion or change; and nature does all things by her own hands, and does not leave another to baptize her but baptizes herself; and this through the metamorphosis again. I remember that a certain poet described it to me thus: ...|$|E
6000|$|Essence, in {{its primary}} signification, means the {{principle}} of individuation, the inmost principle {{of the possibility of}} any thing, as that particular thing. It is equivalent {{to the idea of a}} thing, whenever we use the word, idea, with philosophic precision. Existence, on the other hand, is distinguished from essence, by the superinduction of reality. Thus we speak of the essence, and essential properties of a circle; but we do not therefore assert, that any thing, which really exists, is mathematically circular. Thus too, without any tautology we contend for the existence of the Supreme Being; that is, for a reality correspondent to the idea. There is, next, a <b>secondary</b> <b>use</b> of the word essence, in which it signifies the point or ground of contra-distinction between two modifications of the same substance or subject. Thus we should be allowed to say, that the style of architecture of Westminster Abbey is essentially different from that of St. Paul, even though both had been built with blocks cut into the same form, and from the same quarry. Only in this latter sense of the term must it have been denied by Mr. Wordsworth (for in this sense alone is it affirmed by the general opinion) that the language of poetry (that is the formal construction, or architecture, of the words and phrases) is essentially different from that of prose. Now the burden of the proof lies with the oppugner, not with the supporters of the common belief. Mr. Wordsworth, in consequence, assigns as the proof of his position, [...] "that not only the language of a large portion of every good poem, even of the most elevated character, must necessarily, except with reference to the metre, in no respect differ from that of good prose, but likewise that some of the most interesting parts of the best poems will be found to be strictly the language of prose, when prose is well written. The truth of this assertion might be demonstrated by innumerable passages from almost all the poetical writings, even of Milton himself." [...] He then quotes Gray's sonnet-- ...|$|E
