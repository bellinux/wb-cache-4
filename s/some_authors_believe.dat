500|$|Archimyrmex is an extinct genus of ant in the formicid {{subfamily}} Myrmeciinae, {{described by}} palaeoentomologist Theodore Cockerell in 1923. The genus contains four described species, Archimyrmex [...] rostratus, Archimyrmex piatnitzkyi, Archimyrmex smekali and Archimyrmex wedmannae. Archimyrmex is known {{from a group}} of Middle Eocene fossils which were found in North America, South America, and Europe. The genus was initially placed in the subfamily Ponerinae, but it was later placed in Myrmeciinae; it is now believed to be the ancestor of the extant primitive genus Myrmecia from Australia. Despite this, Archimyrmex is not a member to any tribe and is regarded as incertae sedis within Myrmeciinae. However, <b>some</b> <b>authors</b> <b>believe</b> Archimyrmex should be assigned as incertae sedis within Formicidae.

500|$|Ypresiomyrma is an extinct genus of ants in the {{subfamily}} Myrmeciinae {{that was}} described in 2006. There are four species described; one species is from the Isle of Fur in Denmark, two are from the McAbee Fossil Beds in British Columbia, Canada, and the fourth from the Bol’shaya Svetlovodnaya fossil site in Russia.

30|$|Epiploic appendagitis is a benign, {{self-limiting}} condition which spontaneously resolves within 2  weeks from {{the onset of}} symptoms [20, 23].

Methods: A comprehensive literature search was performed using the Internet search engines linked to academic databases including Pubmed, Google Scholar, Ebsco, Hinari, etc. Studies involving visfatin were thoroughly searched and the references of such articles were also searched for any probable relevant information. Results/Findings: There is no agreed finding regarding the correlation between visfatin and diabetes mellitus.
