However, due to a miscommunication, an Ethiopian boy is delivered to the boys instead of the watch. Although initially shocked, the four boys befriend him, and Cartman names the boy Starvin' Marvin ("Marvin" [...] being given to him by the apparent pronunciation of the name when he was talking in his native language). Meanwhile, mobs of wild turkeys begin attacking and killing South Park residents. Mad scientist Dr. Mephisto tries to warn Mayor McDaniels that genetically engineered turkeys he had been breeding to feed to the poor have gone crazy and are now attacking humans.

5000|$|In 1970 Concord was {{purchased}} by the North American Watch Company. While initially the company struggled it transitioned into a luxury quartz watch company, and during the quartz crisis it attained a large market share. Throughout the 1980s, Concord watches became {{some of the most}} recognizable watches on the American luxury watch market, seeing massive sales in luxury stores throughout the Americas. While the majority of Swiss watch makers were in financial trouble due to the quartz crisis Concord took advantage of the situation by producing some of the most expensive quartz watches on the market. By the early 1980s, the North American Watch Company had the largest advertising budget of any Swiss watch company spending over $14 million annually to attract celebrity endorsements from Jimmy Connors, Bjorn Borg, Joe Montana, Tom Landry and Martha Graham in such expensive publications like the New York Magazine, Texas Monthly, Architectural Digest, Town and Country and Business Week while appearing on TV shows such as Miami Vice, Charlie's Angels, The Love Boat, Dynasty and Hill Street Blues. [...] In 1979 it had a major breakthrough with the invention of the Delirium Watch which was the thinnest watch ever made at the time at 1.98 mm thick. Subsequently, a Delirium 2 was released which was even thinner at 1.5 mm. Another notable watch was the Concord Centurion, an ultra thin <b>sports</b> <b>watch</b> introduced in 1979 that bore a resemblance to the Piaget Polo, the latter which was billed as the most expensive mass-produced luxury watch.|$|E

This study explores the use of customization features of <b>sports</b> <b>watch</b> {{in order to assess}} the extent of customization, and to identify reasons for customization in this context. Survey data from 100 users of a <b>sports</b> <b>watch</b> were analyzed to understand how they use the different customization features: general preferences, functionality and appearance. The findings show that although the users vary in the use of customization, they state similar reasons for customization: control, ease-of-use, increased effectiveness, and better fit to personal preferences. The motivation to customize in this context is for the most part related to autonomy: to the sense of control the user has by having the tool to adapt the product according to own preferences, wants and needs...|$|E
