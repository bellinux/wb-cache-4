5000|$|The third method, soft breaks, {{also known}} as [...] "ki" [...] breaks almost always involve the use of [...] "flat hand" [...] strikes; {{primarily}} the palm, as it's easier to accomplish a successful break with forward momentum, but sometimes {{the back of the}} hand (in a semi outstretched configuration) it utilized to exhibit the person's prowess, as this alternate method usually entails certain conditioning of the hand to endure the stress of impact (see note on Wolff's Law above) as well as using a less natural arm position when delivering the blow. The material is usually supported, horizontally, on two ends. The breaker raises their hand and lets it fall with no tension or significant flexing of the muscles, instead relying mostly on gravity, in order to palm strike the material. The material is broken by a complete energy transfer all the way through, in a direct line from the palm {{to the other side of}} the material. The impact also passes through a wider, more dispersed area and from a martial art perspective therefore causes more damage than other strikes, if delivered to a human adversary. This break is akin to striking a person with a slap, although more energy is transferred into the target than what is typically conveyed by a mere slap. Thus, such a palm strike can cause significant internal damage while leaving few signs of the damage externally (possibly a red mark but not much else), whereas a punch or similar strike, would tend to cause recognizably more external damage, such as bruising, swelling, etc., regardless of how much internal disruption was inflicted. Any person of any age, such as elderly people up to 80 and 90 years of age, can do this break with little injury to themselves. The most serious repercussions may be a palm that tingles afterward, should the break be unsuccessful. This method of break, even if utilizing more than one piece of material and additionally done with no spacers, is easily attainable by people of any age or gender, provided they have sufficiently practiced the technique.

40|$|The {{structure}} of the MSSM is reviewed. We first motivate the particle content of the theory by examining the quantum numbers of the known standard model particles and by the requirement of anomaly cancellation. Once the particle content is fixed we can write down the most general renormalizable superpotential. However such a superpotential will contain terms breaking lepton and baryon number which leads us {{to the concept of}} R-parity conservation. The question of supersymmetry breaking is discussed next. We list the possible <b>soft</b> <b>breaking</b> terms. However the Lagrangian involving the most general <b>soft</b> <b>breaking</b> terms is phenomenologically intractable because of the appearance of the many new parameters. It also leads to some unacceptable predictions. To reduce the number of parameters we restrict ourself to the case with universal <b>soft</b> <b>breaking</b> terms at the GUT scale. We motivate the need for universal <b>soft</b> <b>breaking</b> terms by the apparent unification of gauge couplings in the MSSM and by the absence of flavor changing neutral currents. Then we discuss radiative electroweak symmetry breaking. Radiative breaking arises because the one loop corrections involving the large top Yukawa coupling change the sign of the <b>soft</b> <b>breaking</b> mass parameter of the up-type Higgs doublet, this way introducing a nontrivial minimum in the Higgs potential.
