60|$|It {{is true that}} Marmaduke, by thus {{purchasing}} estates {{that had}} been wrested by violence from others, rendered himself obnoxious to the censures of that Sect which, {{at the same time}} that it discards its children from a full participation in the family union, seems ever unwilling to abandon them entirely to the world. But either his success, or the frequency of the transgression in others, soon wiped off this <b>slight</b> <b>stain</b> from his character; and, although there were a few who, dissatisfied with their own fortunes, or conscious of their own demerits, would make dark hints concerning the sudden prosperity of the unportioned Quaker, yet his services, and possibly his wealth, soon drove the recollection of these vague conjectures from men’s minds. When the war ended, and the independence of the States was acknowledged, Mr. Temple turned his attention from the pursuit of commerce, which was then fluctuating and uncertain, to the settlement of those tracts of land which he had purchased. Aided by a good deal of money, and directed by the suggestions of a strong and practical reason, his enterprise throve to a degree that the climate and rugged face of the country which he selected would seem to forbid. His property increased in a tenfold ratio, and he was already ranked among the most wealthy and important of his countrymen. To inherit this wealth he had but one child—the daughter whom we have introduced to the reader, and whom he was now conveying from school to preside over a household that had too long wanted a mistress.|$|E
6000|$|Hurd, {{unwilling to}} condemn his hero, Addison, and accepting, without misgiving, the {{statement}} reported by Spence, exclaims, [...] "How spotless must that man be, that, in {{passing through a}} court, had only contracted this <b>slight</b> <b>stain,</b> even {{in the opinion of}} so severe a censor and casuist as Mr. Pope."[14] But unless the conduct of Addison is misrepresented he must have been corrupt and contemptible. The party of which he was a prominent member urged the production of his play, at a momentous crisis, with a political object, {{and it would have been}} mean and treacherous to yield to their entreaties, and then privately assure the common enemy that nothing political was intended. The baseness would have been great indeed if, when the power passed over to the whigs, he triumphantly declared that he had pursued the very course he disavowed at the time, and thus endeavoured by a false boast to procure new credit and rewards. Either Addison was unscrupulous, or Pope fabricated the tale. Addison's version was published to the world: Pope's version was dropped into the ear of Spence. Addison made his claim when the circumstances were fresh, and when Pope, Bolingbroke, and Oxford were at hand to expose him: Pope told his story after the lapse of many years, when he had quarrelled with Addison, and the subject of his aspersions was in the grave. Addison has never been convicted of an untruthful word, or a dishonourable act: Pope's career was a labyrinth of deceit, and he abounded in audacious malignant inventions. These considerations are sufficient, but there is more direct evidence. [...] "I have had lately," [...] wrote Pope to Caryll, Feb. 1713, [...] "the entertainment of reading Mr. Addison's tragedy of Cato. It drew tears from me in several parts of the fourth and fifth acts, where the beauty of virtue appears so charming, that I believe, if it comes upon the theatre, we shall enjoy that which Plato thought the greatest pleasure an exalted soul could be capable of, a view of virtue itself dressed in person, colour, and action. The emotion which the mind will feel from this character, and the sentiments of humanity which the distress of such a person as Cato will stir up in us, must necessarily fill an audience with so glorious a disposition and sovereign a love of virtue, that I question if any play has ever conduced so immediately to morals as this." [...] Here is Pope prognosticating that Cato upon the stage will melt, delight, and animate the audience. He penned the words at the exact period when, according to his later assertion, he was admonishing Addison that the play was unsuited to the theatre, and he is self-convicted by the contradiction. One-half of his story was false, and renders the other half worthless.[15] ...|$|E

30|$|Six {{types of}} stain (i.e., white paint, {{vegetable}} oil, mustard, spaghetti sauce, lipstick, and nail polish) {{were used in}} this study. After one laundering cycle, all types of stain except white paint are removed with no visual residual. These results differ from the findings of Schlag and Ordonez (2010). Analyzing the Gray Scale for Color Change values, Schlag and Ordonez found that the conventional washer showed better performance in removing used motor oil and mustard stains, but the HE washer showed better performance in removing lipstick stains. In the current study, all types of stain except white paint are successfully removed after one wash by both types of washers. It is possible that because the test fabric {{used in this study}} is black, a <b>slight</b> <b>stain</b> residual is not prominent for the human eyes to detect.|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} results of Raman {{investigation}} performed at stand-off distance between 6 - 10 m with a new apparatus, capable to detect traces of explosives with surface concentrations {{similar to those of}} a single fingerprint. The device was developed as part of the RADEX prototype (RAman Detection of EXplosives) and is capable of detecting the Raman signal with a single laser shot of few ns (10 - 9 s) in the UV range (wavelength 266 nm), in conditions of safety for the human eye. This is because the maximum permissible exposure (MPE) for the human eye is established to be 3 mJ/cm 2 in this wavelength region and pulse duration. Samples of explosives (PETN, TNT, Urea Nitrate, Ammonium Nitrate) were prepared starting from solutions deposited on samples of common fabrics or clothing materials such as blue jeans, leather, polyester or polyamide. The deposition process takes place via a piezoelectric-controlled plotter device, capable of producing drops of welldefined volume, down to nanoliters, on a surface of several cm 2, in order to carefully control the amount of explosive released to the tissue and thus simulate a <b>slight</b> <b>stain</b> on a garment of a potential terrorist. Depending on the type of explosive sampled, the detected density ranges from 0. 1 to 1 mg/cm 2 and is comparable to the density measured in a spot on a dress or a bag due to the contact with hands contaminated with explosives, as it could happen in the preparation of an improvised explosive device (IED) by a terrorist. To our knowledge the developed device is at the highest detection limits nowadays achievable in the field of eyesafe, stand-off Raman instruments. The signals obtained show some vibrational bands of the Raman spectra of our samples with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), allowing us to identify with high sensitivity (high number of True Positives) and selectivity (low number of False Positives) the explosives, so that the instrument could represent the basis for an automated and remote monitoring device...|$|E
40|$|M. F. A. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2011. Includes bibliographical references. I am {{holding a}} pot in my hand. It is no {{ordinary}} pot, but one made about 1, 000 years ago. It {{was a gift from}} my grandmother. I am first impressed by its wonderful condition [...] it is in perfect condition, without any cracks or chips to mar its line, nor markings on its surface. How could it have passed through so many ages without breaking, I wonder. Second, I find it very impressive that ancient craftsmen could create such a beautifully simple shape. When I pick it up, I feel a very utilitarian shape, and a smooth texture, one that I assume was achieved from being used again and again by hundreds of people for a millennium in time. When I smell the pot, it is like smelling the earth. I look at it, the faded pinkish color of the surface, the color of human skin, along with the <b>slight</b> <b>stain</b> on it that was probably made by many years of use. It all just intrigues me. All of those impressions transport me through time, beyond a thousand years, connecting the potter, his family, and the society of that time to myself. The pot is timeless, no matter when it was created, it speaks out to the holder. This experience made me start to think about "time. " Even though there are a thousand years distance between me and the potter, we can still connect through the pot, as long as I touch and feel it. For me, until I saw this pot, time was an objective phenomenon, as other people normally think of it. That is, time does not go backward, only forward. But in this moment when I touched and felt this wonderful pot, "time" in my mind travels back and forth, disregarding the minute hand of the watch which marks the real passage of time in the present and relentlessly toward the future. One of my prints for my thesis exhibition, I printed hundred times with multiple colors and images on each time, and the other print has only few layered colors and images, but they were held at the same space at the same time, and were also mysteriously harmonized together. I intended to put together those prints made of different time, different colors, different layers, but also made of the same technical process. Each print's history is unique by the subtle color difference, and composition of the central dot image, but they are also all similar in the soft color and the dot images...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This {{randomized}} controlled split-mouth clinical trial evaluated the short-term survival rate of indirect resin composite and ceramic laminate veneers. Materials and Methods: A total of 10 patients (mean age: 48. 6 years) received 46 indirect resin composite (Estenia; n = 23) and ceramic laminate veneers (IPS Empress Esthetic; n = 23) on the maxillary anterior teeth. Veneer preparations with incisal overlap were performed and existing resin composite restorations of good quality were not removed but conditioned using silica coating (CoJet) and silanization (ESPE-Sil). Enamel and dentin were etched and rinsed; adhesive resin (ExciTE) was then applied. After cementation (Variolink Veneer), restorations were evaluated at baseline and thereafter every 6 months {{for up to}} 3 years using modified USPHS criteria. Results: Seventeen laminate veneers were bonded onto intact teeth and 29 on teeth having existing resin composite restorations. In total, 3 failures were observed {{in the form of}} debonding (n = 1) and fracture (n = 2) in the group of resin composite laminate veneers. No significant difference was observed between the survival rates of composite and ceramic laminate veneers (Estenia: 87 %, IPS Empress Esthetic: 100 %; p > 0. 05). The overall survival rate was 93. 5 % (Kaplan-Meier). Of the 43 laminate veneers, minor voids and defects were observed in 6 of the composite and 3 of the ceramic veneers. <b>Slight</b> <b>staining</b> at the margins (n = 3) and slightly rough surfaces were more frequently observed for the resin composite laminate veneers (n = 18) up to the final recall. Conclusion: Early findings of this clinical trial on two veneer materials showed statistically similar survival rates.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of intracellular transport of bile acids from the sinusoidal pole to the canalicular pole of the hepatocyte are poorly understood. There is physiological and autoradiographic {{evidence for a}} vesicular pathway. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the localization of natural bile acids in the liver using antibodies against cholic acid conjugates and ursodeoxycholic acid. An indirect immunoperoxidase technique was used on rat liver sections fixed either with paraformaldehyde (PF) and saponin, a membrane-permeabilizing agent that allows penetration of antibodies into the cell, or with PF alone. Retention of taurocholate in the liver after tissue processing was 26 +/- SD 15 % of the bile acid initially present. When sections fixed with PF and saponin were incubated with the antibody against cholic acid conjugates, a granular cytoplasmic staining was observed by light microscopy in all hepatocytes. By electron microscopy, strong electron-dense deposits were observed mostly on vesicles of the Golgi apparatus (GA) and, sometimes, in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER). After taurocholate infusion, the intensity of the reaction increased. When the liver was fixed with PF alone, almost no reaction was visible on light microscopy, but on electron microscopy the label was localized on the hepatocyte plasma membrane, mainly on the bile canalicular domain and to a lesser extent on the sinusoidal domain. With the antibody against ursodeoxycholic acid, no staining was observed in three of four livers, and a <b>slight</b> <b>staining</b> was observed in one. However, after infusion of ursodeoxycholic acid, staining of GA and SER vesicles was observed when the liver was fixed with PF and saponin. With PF alone, the reaction was intense on the canalicular membrane. These results support the view that, within the limits of the method, vesicles from the GA and possibly vesicles of the SER are involved in the intracellular transport of bile acids before canalicular secretion...|$|R

Methods: Fifty-one non-undercut non-carious cervical lesions were restored with One-Up Bond F and Palfique Estilite in 15 patients (mean age 57. 5 years). Restorations were evaluated at six months and one year for presence or absence and for marginal staining using standardized colour photographs for comparison.

40|$|Using {{a direct}} immunofluorescent method, {{histological}} locations of immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, IgA and IgD of heavy chain, and kappa and lambda of light chain) and complement components (C 3 and C 4) were studied in 78 brain tumors, which included 24 astrocytomas, 6 metastatic tumors, 5 medulloblastomas, 4 malignant lymphomas, 15 meningiomas, 8 schwannomas, 8 pituitary adenomas, and 8 other miscellaneous brain tumors. IgG-positive cells {{were observed in}} the perivascular regions of astrocytomas, but were more marked in those of high grade, metastatic tumors and meningiomas. Malignant lymphomas demonstrated IgG and IgM-positive cells accompanied by either kappa of lambda light chains. C 3 and C 4 were much less evident in these tumors. Pituitary adenomas showed <b>slight</b> positive <b>stains</b> for both immunoglobulins and complement components on the blood vessel walls, Immune reactions against brain tumors were discussed including the clinical application of autologous lymphocyte infusion in malignant gliomas and combination chemotherapy in intracranial malignant lymphomas. </p...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY-Sera from rabbits immunized with puriAed herpes-type {{virus from}} cultured Burkitt Iymphoblasts of the EB 3 strain were {{conjugated}} with fluorescein isothiocyanate {{and used in}} an immunofluorescence test. Two sera brilliantly stained a proportion of EB 3 cells, but failed to react with normal human lymphoid cells or human cells from HeLa cultures, embryo lung fibroblast cultures, and amnion cultures. The positive sera gave <b>slight</b> background <b>staining</b> when used unabsorbed, but this was removed completely by preliminary treatment with small amounts of normal human lymphoid-cell powder; the sera did not react with normal human serum on immunoelectro-phoresis. Control conjugated rabbit antiserum to a bacterial antigen did not stain the EB 3 cells. Examination of samples of EB 3 cells by the immuno-fluorescence test and electron microscopy in parallel showed 3 times fewer fluorescing cells than cells containing virus, with the particular criteria chosen for assessing positive fluorescence. Both fluorescing cells and cells seen in the electron microscope to contain virus were frequently degenerating. Wher...|$|R
60|$|Such, {{and often}} {{influenced}} by such causes, has commonly been {{the fate of}} monarchies of long duration. They have their ebbs and their flows. This has been eminently {{the fate of the}} monarchy of France. There have been times in which no power has ever been brought so low. Few have ever flourished in greater glory. By turns elevated and depressed, that power had been, on the whole, rather on the increase; and it continued not only powerful but formidable to the hour of the total ruin of the monarchy. This fall of the monarchy was far from being preceded by any exterior symptoms of decline. The interior were not visible to every eye; and a thousand accidents might have prevented the operation of what the most clear-sighted were not able to discern, nor the most provident to divine. A very little time before its dreadful catastrophe {{there was a kind of}} exterior splendour in the situation of the Crown, which usually adds to government strength and authority at home. The Crown seemed then to have obtained some of the most splendid objects of state ambition. None of the continental powers of Europe were the enemies of France. They were all either tacitly disposed to her, or publicly connected with her; and in those who kept the most aloof there was little appearance of jealousy; of animosity there was no appearance at all. The British nation, her great preponderating rival; she had humbled; to all appearance she had weakened; certainly had endangered, by cutting off a very large, and by far the most growing part of her empire. In that its acme of human prosperity and greatness, in the high and palmy state of the monarchy of France, it fell to the ground without a struggle. It fell without any of those vices in the monarch which have sometimes been the causes of the fall of kingdoms, but which existed, without any visible effect on the state, in the highest degree in many other princes; and, far from destroying their power, had only left some <b>slight</b> <b>stains</b> on their character. The financial difficulties were only pretexts and instruments of those who accomplished the ruin of that monarchy. They were not the causes of it.|$|R
