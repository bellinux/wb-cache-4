5|$|After the shooting, Saldívar {{entered her}} red 1994 GMC pickup truck {{and tried to}} leave the motel parking lot. Motel {{employee}} Rosario Garza saw Saldívar leave her room with a wrapped towel. It was later {{thought she was going}} to Q-Productions to shoot Quintanilla, Jr. and others who were waiting for Selena. However, she was spotted by a responding police officer in a vehicle. The officer left his vehicle, drew his gun, and ordered Saldívar out of the truck. Saldívar did not comply; <b>she</b> <b>backed</b> up and parked adjacent to two cars. Her truck was then blocked in by the police vehicle. Saldívar picked up the pistol, pointed it at her right temple, and threatened to commit suicide. A SWAT team and the FBI Crisis Negotiation Unit were brought in. Musicologist Himilce Novas later said the event was reminiscent of O.J. Simpson's planned suicide 10 months earlier.|$|E

25|$|Though {{a dynamic}} stage personality, Atwell was, in person, a shy, {{retiring}} and soft-spoken woman of modesty. Eloquent and intellectual, {{she was well}} read and, unlike many {{in the world of}} professional showbusiness, keenly interested in and informed about issues and current events. Voracious in her reading habits and a devotee of crosswords, she confessed to an inordinate love of mangoes, a dislike of new shoes, and a keen interest in televised cricket (<b>she</b> <b>backed</b> England). She was also a devout Catholic, who unpretentiously played the organ for her parish church.|$|E

25|$|In 2008, a janitor, who {{was also}} a student, {{borrowed}} a book from the library, to read during breaks. The book was Notre Dame vs the Klan, a historical account of how the then-despised Catholic minority in 1924, confronted the then-powerful Ku Klux Klan. The book jacket portrayed the hooded Klansmen. A co-worker complained after seeing the cover, as did his union supervisor. Eventually the school's Affirmative Action Officer issued a formal rebuke to the janitor. After much discussion and criticism <b>she</b> <b>backed</b> away from that rebuke and subsequently retired. After more criticism and a passage of several months, the university chancellor apologized and issued letters of disapproval to the original complainant.|$|E

25|$|Although Hatch had {{suggested}} that Mason might get as many as 1,400 released Union prisoners, a mix-up with the parole camp books and suspicion of bribery from other steamboat captains caused the Union officer {{in charge of the}} loading, Captain George Williams, to place every man at the parole camp on board Sultana, believing the number to be less than 1,500. Although Sultana had a legal capacity of only 376, by the time <b>she</b> <b>backed</b> away from Vicksburg on the night of April 24, 1865, she was severely overcrowded with 1,978 paroled prisoners, 22 guards from the 58th Ohio Volunteer Infantry, 70 paying cabin passengers, and 85 crew members. Many of the paroled prisoners had been weakened by their incarceration in the Confederate prison camps and associated illnesses but had managed to gain some strength while waiting at the parole camp to be officially released. The men were packed into every available space, and the overflow was so severe that in some places, the decks began to creak and sag and had to be supported with heavy wooden beams.|$|E

500|$|Boyack {{said that}} as leader, she would {{campaign}} on better funding for healthcare, improvements to childcare, education and youth employment opportunities, and the devolvement of power to local government. <b>She</b> <b>backed</b> the scrapping of the Trident programme. She wanted to reform Council tax, which had been frozen since the SNP {{came to power in}} 2007, and suggested the existing eight tax bands should be redrawn. She would allow local authorities to raise a tourism tax, while environmentally friendly power firms and bus companies would be created to raise public funds. She supported establishing a consensus on whether or not to have full tax devolution, but had [...] "reservations" [...] about the prospect of devolving further taxes to Holyrood. She favoured devolving welfare benefits to Scotland. She told STV's Stephen Daisley that she wished [...] "to make Scottish Labour a force in Scottish politics again". After publishing a list of social justice-themed policies, she announced plans to establish a commission similar to the Social Justice Commission created by UK Labour leader John Smith in 1994, which had helped shape Labour policy in areas such as employment and welfare.|$|E
500|$|As {{the patrol}} moved ashore, Major Carter S. Vaden spotted a well camouflaged bunker and threw two hand grenades into it. When they exploded, {{concealed}} Japanese mortars and machine guns commenced firing on the patrol and the craft offshore. The PT was hit, her commander wounded, and she withdrew. The LCVP {{headed toward the}} shore where it picked up five men, including Robinson and Kaihu. The LCVP retracted and headed out to sea but then sighted another group on the beach. She headed back in to pick them up, despite her commander being wounded, and succeeded. As <b>she</b> <b>backed</b> off the beach again, she was holed by a mortar round and began taking on water. Meanwhile, the damaged PT had reported {{what had happened and}} a bomber was sent to investigate. Flying low, it spotted the men in the water, and another PTboat was sent to the rescue, covered by the destroyer [...] After three hours in the water, the LCVP's survivors were picked up by the PT boat. Eight Americans, including Major Vaden, had been killed and fifteen wounded, including the entire LCVP crew. Kaihu was missing and Robinson was contemplating how he would break the news to his family when Kaihu walked in, having swum back to Los Negros.|$|E
500|$|Sotomayor's {{confirmation}} hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee began on July 13, 2009, during which <b>she</b> <b>backed</b> {{away from her}} [...] "wise Latina" [...] remark, declaring it [...] "a rhetorical flourish that fell flat" [...] and stating that [...] "I {{do not believe that}} any ethnic, racial or gender group has an advantage in sound judgment." [...] When Republican senators confronted her regarding other remarks from her past speeches, she pointed to her judicial record and said she had never let her own life experiences or opinions influence her decisions. Republican senators said that while her rulings to this point might be largely traditional, they feared her Supreme Court rulings – where there is more latitude with respect to precedent and interpretation – might be more reflective of her speeches. Sotomayor defended her position in Ricci as following applicable precedent. [...] When asked whom she admired, she pointed to Justice Benjamin N. Cardozo. In general, Sotomayor followed the hearings formula of recent past nominees by avoiding stating personal positions, declining to take positions on controversial issues likely to come before the Court, agreeing with senators from both parties, and repeatedly affirming that as a justice she would just apply the law. [...] On July 28, 2009, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved Sotomayor's nomination; the 13–6 vote was almost entirely along party lines, with no Democrats opposing her and only one Republican supporting her. On August 6, 2009, Sotomayor was confirmed by the full Senate by a vote of 68–31. [...] The vote was largely along party lines, with no Democrats opposing her and nine Republicans supporting her.|$|E
