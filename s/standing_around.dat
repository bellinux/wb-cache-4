5|$|In 1943, the {{airfield}} was designated as Stützpunkt 134 Paderborn, housing defence units {{as part of}} the Atlantic Wall coastal fortifications. The units were equipped with 10.5 cm leFH 18 howitzers. During the winter of 1943–44, 10.5 cm leFH 324(f) howitzers replaced the leFH 18s. A number of concrete bunkers were constructed to house the guns, which were still <b>standing</b> <b>around</b> {{the airfield}} in October 2007. Following Operation Overlord {{at the start of the}} Allied invasion of western Europe, the Germans committed various acts of sabotage on departure from Saint-Inglevert.|$|E

Thrice the workers suspiciously ask Peter if he knows Jesus and thrice he denies his acquaintance. A cock crows and Peter, realizing what he has done, weeps.|$|E
5|$|In 1989 {{the club}} {{moved to the}} Portway Stadium, {{situated}} in the Portway Industrial Estate on the western outskirts of the town. Built {{at a cost of}} £850,000, the ground has a main stand of brick and concrete construction with bench seating for around 250 people. This stand is set on a bank running along the entire south side of the ground, giving spectators on that side an elevated view of the pitch. The managers' benches are set into this banking in front of the stand at pitch level. The banking slopes down behind each goal until it reaches the same level as the pitch along the north side. There is hard <b>standing</b> <b>around</b> the entire perimeter of pitch, along with a turnstile block and a gate opening out onto the stadium car park for ambulance access.|$|E

5|$|In the Second Test at Sydney, Johnston took 3/56 and 3/70 in a low-scoring match, {{removing}} Hutton in both innings. He {{had another}} notable innings {{when he joined}} Neil Harvey with 78 runs needed for victory on a difficult batting surface against the hostile pace of Frank Tyson and Brian Statham. In particular, Tyson was bowling with a strong tailwind and a slips cordon <b>standing</b> <b>around</b> 40 yards behind the bat. They put together a stubborn 39 run tenth-wicket partnership in 40 minutes, which gave Australia hope of an unlikely victory with Harvey still attacking. Harvey felt that Tyson was almost out of energy after a spell of extreme pace, and that the remaining bowlers were not beyond Johnston. However, a Tyson ball that was aimed at the ribcage saw Johnston fend at the ball; he was caught behind for 11, giving England a dramatic victory. After taking 1/26 in the first innings, Johnston took 5/85 in the second innings of his last Test performance {{in front of his}} home crowd at the MCG, with some tight spin on a dry surface. He removed Edrich for 13 and Peter May for 91 before cleaning up the tail with three quick wickets. This left Australia 240 to win but there was to be no fairytale as England won by 128 runs. Johnston then took match figures of 4/80 in the Fourth Test at Adelaide, in what was to be the his last Test on Australian soil. Australia lost the match and England retained the Ashes; it was Australia's third consecutive Test defeat, the first time they had suffered a hat-trick of defeats since the infamous Bodyline series of 1932–33. Johnston had less success outside the Tests, which were played on bowler-friendly surfaces. He managed only 13 wickets at 30.38 in five matches.|$|E

25|$|Wilder {{was adamant}} that {{the corpse of}} Joe Gillis {{be seen from the}} bottom of the pool, but {{creating}} the effect was difficult.

25|$|There are a {{large number}} of extant, {{original}} outbuildings associated with the various houses in Scales Mound. Gable and hip roof garages are commonly found in the village.

The architectural survey undertaken in 1989 concurrent with the National Register nomination noted dozens of such outbuildings.

25|$|The {{majority}} of the events are categorized as seemingly peaceful by many students, stating that they consist mainly of students <b>standing</b> <b>around,</b> chanting and singing. There is also still debate among UMass students {{as to whether or}} not the term “riot” applies to a lot of the occurrences since they seldom involve violence or aggressive behavior from the vast {{majority of}} students present. Nevertheless, each event is met with police interference due to a fear of the unsafe environments that large unattended crowds could create. In the past there has been friction between members of the student body and the UMass Police Department around their methods of crowd control; students have been displeased with what they see as unnecessary force.|$|E
25|$|The Penwith {{peninsula}} sits predominantly on granite bedrock {{that has}} {{led to the formation of}} a rugged coastline with many fine beaches. The contact between the granite and the adjoining sedimentary rock (mostly shales) is most clearly seen forming the cliffs at Land's End, the most westerly point in the district and this geology has resulted in the mining that has made Cornwall famous. Tin and copper have been mined in the area since pre-Roman times and the landscape is dotted with ruined mine buildings. Inland, the peninsula is primarily granite with a thin top soil. This combined with Cornwall's exposed position and the prevailing weather systems from the Atlantic Ocean means that, with the exception of the high moor areas, much of the area is a semi-bare plateau <b>standing</b> <b>around</b> 130 m above sea level. This is most evident on the north coast between St Just and Zennor where the remains of the ancient seabed of the Pliocene era are visible. Its highest point is Watch Croft (252 m).|$|E
