There is evidence of Granaries being in use over 10,000 years ago, with central authorities in civilizations including ancient China and ancient Egypt being known to release food from storage in times of famine. At the 1974 World Food Conference the term [...] "food security" [...] was defined {{with an emphasis on}} supply. Food security, they said, is the [...] "availability at all times of adequate world food supplies of basic foodstuffs to sustain a steady expansion of food consumption and to offset fluctuations in production and prices". Later definitions added demand and access issues to the definition. The final report of the 1996 World Food Summit states that food security [...] "exists when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life".|$|E

This will require a decisive commitment to observe not only procedural deadlines but also the political and financial objectives it has been designed to accomplish." [...] He also said the main theme of the session would be the peaceful settlement of international disputes: [...] "I hope this framework will usefully serve the noble cause of preventing gathering conflicts and resolving existing ones." [...] As well as maintaining the rule of law: [...] "Close to 800 years after the Magna Carta was promulgated, many people around the world still do not enjoy the fundamental rights enshrined in that seminal document – rights that protect individuals, while enabling countries to develop in peace and security, as sovereign equals. I urge the Member States to agree on a consensus document by the start of the High-Level Debate on the Rule of Law in a few days’ time." [...] Other important goals for the session are: peace and security as a means of enhancing development, a focus before te Millennium Development Goals' deadline in 2015, achieving the commitments made at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in Brazil in June, progress on arms control and disarmament, strengthening UN peacekeeping operations, coordinating global responses to non-state terrorism and the [...] promotion of human rights.|$|E
2500|$|On April 7, {{the federal}} {{government}} of Australia ruled out any Chinese involvement in security operations when the Olympic torch arrives in Australia. Chinese flame attendants will be allowed into Australia, but only to maintain the flame. The chairman of the Canberra relay taskforce, Ted Quinlan, has stated they [...] "could be subject to arrest [...] if they {{laid a hand on}} somebody". On April 22, Chinese ambassador to Australia Zhang Junsai stated that the flame attendants would [...] "use their bodies" [...] to protect the torch in Canberra. Following a talk with Australian Olympic Committee president John Coates, Ambassador Zhang subsequently said that his statement had been [...] "misinterpreted". Coates said that the flame attendants were [...] "technical assistants", and re-iterated that they would play no security role. Shortly before the beginning of the Canberra relay, Australian and Chinese officials argued in public over the role of the flame attendants, during a press conference. Beijing spokesman Qu Yingpu stated that the attendants' role included security, a claim immediately rejected by Australian Capital Territory Chief Minister Jon Stanhope, who, sitting a few metres from Qu and [...] "clearly furious" [...] according to the Herald Sun, re-iterated once more that Australian police would handle all security. The International Olympic Committee subsequently backed Australia's position, with IOC president Jacques Rogge stating: [...] "The sovereignty of Australia is absolute; <b>security</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> matter for Australia, it is not a matter for these people, that is very clear."
