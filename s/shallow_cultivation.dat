40|$|<b>Shallow</b> <b>cultivation</b> to a {{depth of}} 5 - 7 cm has in the last years become a {{realistic}} alternative to common ploughless tillage (cultivation depth 1 0 - 15 cm), especially in Great Britain, France and Germany. <b>Shallow</b> <b>cultivation</b> means avoiding unnecessary soil loosening, preserving the soils natural structure, increasing activity in the top layer and decreasing fuel consumption with less power requirement. Two years ago VäderstadVerken AB developed a tillage tool for <b>shallow</b> <b>cultivation</b> called Rexius Carrier with System Disc. The tool consists of a heavy roller and a front tool called Systern Disc. The front tool includes two rows of concave, close mounted discs, which combined with a trave 1 ing speed of 10 - 14 km/h leaves a well leveled, 100 % work through, top layer. The aim of this thesis was to test <b>shallow</b> <b>cultivation</b> with Rexius Carrier under Swedish conditions, as autumn cultivation and as spring cultivation after a catch crop. This thesis includes the results of three different series of field experiments. The first, "Minimized autumn tillage to a spring crop", R 2 - 4122, was started in the autumn 2000. The result of the trial showed the highest yield for mouldboard ploughing and the lowest for the <b>shallow</b> <b>cultivation,</b> with deeper ploughless tillage in between. The second series, "Spring seeding without autumn tillage, including a catch crop", R 2 - 4123, was started in the spring of 2001. The series contained three experiments on sites with different clay contents, and compared autumn and spring ploughing with ploughless tillage to different depths and with different tillage intensities. The <b>shallow</b> <b>cultivation</b> performed well in this comparison. Despite a less suitable seedbed, plant establishment and crop yield in the shallow cultivated plots was nearly as high as for autumn ploughing. The weed population was greatly reduced in the shallow cultivated plots. The spring ploughed plots had less sui 1 able seedbed properties, poorer germination, more weed and lower crop yield than autumn ploughed plots. The third series, "Shallow cultivation to winter seed", started in the autumn of 200 1. In this series conventional mouldboard ploughing was compared with <b>shallow</b> <b>cultivation</b> with Rexius Carrier, chisel ploughing with and without roller and heavy disc harrow with and without roller. Before the second cultivation the germination of weeds and volunteers was counted, without any differences between different treatments. Before the seeding, the amount of straw and stubble on the surface was compared using digital image analysis. No differences between the treatments were found. After the seeding, the seedbed properties and the plant establishment was determined. Due to the large amount of rain that fell in the autumn, which had an equalizing effect on the analyzed parameters, {{no significant differences between the}} treatments were found. The trials has shown that only <b>shallow</b> <b>cultivation</b> before seeding can give good opportunities for the following crop. The trial R 2 - 4123 showed that shallow spring cultivation after a catch crop can maintain harvest yield compared to conventional mouldboard ploughing. Shallow autumn cultivation has a future as an alternative to conventional methods. The plant establishment were quite comparable despite the large amount of rain that fell in the autumn...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} effect of different soil tillage and seeding rate on alfalfa root morphology. The field experiment was established in 3 variants of tillage: <b>shallow</b> <b>cultivation</b> (MK), loosening (HK) and conventional tillage (plough), all under two seeding rate (4 and 7 MGS). After autumn cut, root samples were collected in the depth of 25 cm. Lower seeding rate increased intensity of branching and number of lateral root per plant. Total mass of roots per hectar was higher in higher seeding rate variant. Ploughed variant provided higher intensity of branching and branching depth was the deepest of all variants. Loosed variant showed highest branch diameter out of all variants. Highest plant number per square meter was achieved in loosed variant but <b>shallow</b> <b>cultivation</b> showed highest plant survival rate of all variants. Tillage affected weed infestation by 33, 6 %. Dominant weeds in ploughed variant were field pennycress and pale persicaria. Dominant weeds in loosed variant were redroot pigweed and cockspur, while in shallow tillage variant dominant weeds were represented by cleavers and common knotgrass. Results of experiment show that <b>shallow</b> <b>cultivation</b> and loosening have similar influence on plant density and root morphology as conventional tillage. Reduced seeding rates are possible, but due to problematic field emergence of alfalfa and higher weed infestation of thinner stands, higher seeding rates prove themselves as superior...|$|E
40|$|In {{the autumn}} 2006 a project was {{started with the}} title "Soil {{structure}} for Optimal Winter Oilseed Rape". In this essay eight field trials in the southern and middle part of Sweden have been studied between the years of 2006 and 2007. Six of the field trials (R 2 - 4141 and L 2 - 4141) contained different establish methods. The establish methods that were investigated for winter oilseed rape were conventional ploughing, shallow ploughing, <b>shallow</b> <b>cultivation</b> with a Carrier or a cultivator, spread sowing followed by cultivation with a Carrier or a cultivator and sub soiling. The other two field trials (R 2 - 4135 and R 2 - 4135 - 6) show how winter oilseed rape reacts on different preceding crops (spring barley, winter wheat, fallow and active fallow) and establish methods (conventional ploughing and <b>shallow</b> <b>cultivation).</b> To investigate the soil structure and how it affects {{the development of the}} plant, different measurements were made. Some of these were seed bed analysis, water infiltration, soil penetration, plant counting and studying plant development in autumn and spring. The establishment trials were situated in different parts of Sweden, which made an overall comparison difficult. The results of the measurements varied between the trials, but were small within the trials. The differences in yield were small. There were some tendency that a reduced cultivation system resulted in a higher yield on heavy soil and the opposite on light soil. Winter oilseed rape established well in a reduced cultivation system. The crop yield in a reduced cultivation system was in many cases higher than after conventional ploughing. Even the easy and cheap cultivation systems as broadcasted seeding followed by cultivation with a Carrier or a cultivator resulted in good crop yields. The combination of cheap establishment and high yields has in many cases resulted in the best economy. In the experiments with different preceding crops, located outside Uppsala, there were more significant results between the different treatments. In the seedbed analysis there were more small aggregates in the seedbed in a reduced cultivation system. The preceding crop also seemed to {{have an effect on the}} aggregate size, with smallest aggregates after winter wheat as a preceding crop, followed by spring barley, fallow and active fallow. The penetration resistance was less after conventional ploughing then after <b>shallow</b> <b>cultivation</b> with a Carrier in the surface soil. The plant development showed that the preceding crop affected the winter oilseed rape more than the cultivation system. In late autumn, the plants were bigger after winter wheat as a preceding crop than after spring barley, although in the spring the difference was not that clear even if the tendency was the same. The yield was more affected by the cultivation system than by the preceding crop. <b>Shallow</b> <b>cultivation</b> with a Carrier raised the yield compared with conventional ploughing.

40|$|Early autumn {{cultivation}} of soil {{is known to}} stimulate nitrogen (N) mineralization and {{increase the risk of}} N leaching from arable land. This is due to mineralization of soil organic matter and high release of nitrate after mechanical disturbance at a time when soil temperature still allows high microbial activities. Nitrogen uptake in winter wheat is rather low, often not more than 10 - 15 kg ha⁻¹. Therefore, N mineralized due to conventional establishment of winter wheat is at risk of leaching during autumn and winter, especially if the preceding crop leaves a lot of N in the soil and in its crop residues, e. g. oilseed rape. This project studied the extent to which direct-drilling or <b>shallow</b> <b>cultivation</b> using Väderstad Carrier (5 - 7 cm) or stubble cultivation (10 - 12 cm) instead of conventional establishment after early moldboard ploughing could mitigate N mineralization during autumn, and how it affected crop establishment and yield. One-year field trials with three replicates were established at three Swedish sites in autumn 2002 and studied for three consecutive years. All four techniques for establishment of winter wheat (including direct-drilling) resulted in more soil mineral N in comparison with untreated soil. The increase after direct-drilling compared to no treatment varied between 5 - 36 kg N per hectare and was possibly explained by faster release of N from the oilseed rape residues. Two weeks after sowing, the soil profile contained on average 10, 5 and 7 kg less soil mineral N after direct-drilling than after moldboard ploughing in a light clay soil in Skåne, a light soil in Västergötland and a heavy clay soil in Uppland respectively. <b>Shallow</b> <b>cultivation</b> resulted in - 3 kg, + 11 kg and - 10 kg less mineral N per hectare compared with moldboard ploughing in Skåne, Västergötland and Uppland respectively. In Skåne, soil mineral N increased with increasing tillage depth. At the two other sites, however, there was no clear relationship between tillage intensity and soil N content. In Västergötland <b>shallow</b> <b>cultivation</b> resulted in more soil mineral N than moldboard ploughing, while in Uppland direct-drilling resulted in more soil mineral N than shallow tillage. Comparing moldboard ploughing and shallow tillage, soil mineral N during autumn after establishment of winter wheat was more dependent on the timing of tillage than tillage method. Average values of all nine experiments showed that net mineralization was 8 % lower after direct-drilling than after primary tillage and sowing (moldboard ploughing or shallow tillage), while compared to moldboard ploughing it was 20 % lower. Reduced tillage, especially direct-drilling but also shallow tillage, increased the amount of weeds in spring compared with moldboard ploughing. However, these treatment differences disappeared after herbicide application in summer, and thus with normal spraying, the effect of reduced tillage on weeds was not a problem. Direct-drilling resulted in a 2 % yield reduction compared with moldboard ploughing. The highest wheat yields were obtained after stubble cultivation and Väderstad Carrier. From an economic point of view, direct drilling or <b>shallow</b> <b>cultivation</b> to establish winter wheat is preferable to conventional moldboard ploughing...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe SWAT {{model was}} used to model the impacts of climate, soils and {{agricultural}} practices on nitrate flows in a 1310 km 2 catchment in western France. Spatialized data were used for natural features (climate, soil, topography), while agricultural activities, finely represented by crop sequences over 3 years, and their associated cultural practices were mapped by remote sensing. The model was calibrated and validated for discharge and nitrate flows at a gauging station. Results are analyzed with respect to leaching for each crop sequence and for each soil type, as nitrate leaching is highly sensitive to the soil and the crop sequence. The lowest risks were found in clayey soils and the highest in sandy soils and/or in sequences including maize. In collaboration with local stakeholders, five scenarios of alternative practices were simulated to evaluate their consequences for nitrogen flows: reduced fertilization, catch crops, <b>shallow</b> <b>cultivation,</b> no-till with catch crops and filter strips. The impacts of the conversion of a pasture into wheat and rapeseed were also assessed. At the catchment gauging station, our 9 -year simulations showed a reduction in nitrate flow of 8 % with filters strips, 11 % with catch crops, 12 % with no-till with catch crops, and 15 % with reduced fertilization. <b>Shallow</b> <b>cultivation</b> had no impact on nitrate flow. Inversely, the conversion of temporary pastures, which accounts for 32 % of the catchment area, to cereals and rapeseed increased nitrate flow by 18 %. The impacts of each scenario varied in accordance with leaching at the parcel scale and with the proportion of area affected by the practice.

There is a need of quantifying tilth characteristics in the former plough layer of soil converted to such tillage systems. A non-inverting tillage system (NINV) was tested in a field experiment conducted on a Danish sandy loam soil. It included deep loosening and <b>shallow</b> intensive <b>cultivation</b> and was compared to a conventional ploughing-harrowing tillage system (CONV). A hierarchical analytical procedure was applied in studies of soil fragmentation and soil strength characteristics for the 7 - 14 cm soil layer.

Soil strength was measured in the field with a cone penetrometer and a torsional shear box method, and in the laboratory using an annulus shear strength method. Tensile strength was determined in the laboratory on field-sampled aggregates. The CONV treated soil displayed a higher ease of fragmentation {{in the field in}} May as well as in September. In general, aggregates from the NINV treated soil were stronger than aggregates from the CONV treatment. The soils had similar friability indices in May. In September, however, a higher friability index was found for the CONV treated soil (k= 0. 22 and 0. 16, respectively for CONV and NINV). The NINV treated soil also displayed the highest soil strength. The soil tilth was evaluated to be best in the CONV treated soil.

40|$|Promoting the {{sustainable}} use of agrochemicals {{is a recent}} issue of the European Union. In this respect, both the “alternative” equipments (for instance the machines for physical weed control) and the recent applications of precision farming may play an important role. The European Project RHEA (Robot fleets for Higly Effective Agriculture and forestry management) fits into this context and aims to realize a fleet of autonomous aerial and ground mobile units for crop protection. The purpose of the aerial units will be to “inspect” the field and send information to the operative base, which will plan accordingly the path for the ground units. They will be characterized by an autonomous tractor coupled with an “intelligent” operative machine. Three actuation systems will be developed, according to three different scenarios: herbicide application in wheat; physical weed control in maize and on-canopy insecticide application in olive trees. This work describes the precision hoe designed to perform mechanical and thermal weed control in maize. The machine will be equipped with rigid elements for a <b>shallow</b> soil <b>cultivation</b> (till 5 cm of depth at maximum) between the rows and couples of burners for selective in-row flaming, as maize is tolerant to the thermal shock.

The thermal treatment will be performed only in case of weed detection by the perception system of the aerial and ground unit, while the mechanical treatment will be performed independently from weed presence.

40|$|Improvement of intra-row {{mechanical}} {{weed control}} is important to reduce the reliance on herbicides in arable crops and vegetables. Covering weeds by soil is an important weed control mechanism of weed harrows. A <b>shallow</b> post-emergence harrow <b>cultivation</b> controls weeds but also damages the crop to some extent. This paper explores how plants get covered by soil and how a plant’s resistance against being covered is related to its height, flexibility and shape of leaves. Seedlings of two contrasting species were sown in bins filled with a sandy soil and harrowed by a small model harrow in the laboratory. Covering selectivity (percentage covered ryegrass/percentage covered garden cress) could be influenced by soil moisture content, working depth and working speed. Differences in covering were related to spatial patterns of plant downward bending and soil surface level upheaval. These patterns are associated with soil failure patterns near tines and soil flow patterns, connected with different effects of plant height and plant flexibility. This study indicates that relationships between weed control and crop covering may not only depend on weed and crop characteristics but also on soil conditions and implement settings. As less than 10 % of the covered plants were buried deeper than 15 mm, covering would mainly cause growth reduction and little killing. Limited burial depth {{may be an important}} cause for limited weed control effectiveness of harrowing...|$|R
40|$|Conservation tillage {{practices}} were tested against autumn mouldboard ploughing {{for differences in}} physical properties of soil, surface runoff, subsurface drainflow and soil erosion. The study (1991 - 2001) was performed on a gently (2 %) sloping clayey soil of southern Finland, with two replicates of the tillage treatments on 0. 5 ha plots. The annual shares of surface runoff of the total flow (surface runoff + subsurface drainflow) were 842 % for ploughing (depth 2023 cm), 3666 % for <b>shallow</b> autumn stubble <b>cultivation</b> (depth 58 cm) and 3682 % for soil left untilled over winter. Surface runoff increased with decrease in the tillage intensity, and {{in line with the}} values of depressional water storage, macroporosity and saturated hydraulic conductivity. Erodibility of this gently sloping soil was at highest after autumn and spring tillage operations and decreased with time. Shallow autumn tillage produced erosion as high as mouldboard ploughing (4071700 kg ha 1 yr 1), but 48 % and 12 % lower erosion levels were measured from plots left untilled in autumn, covered by grass or barley residues, respectively. Eroded soil particles moved relatively freely to the subsurface drains, which carried 3794 % of the annual soil losses from the field. The study shows that even on the relatively flat clayey soils typical for southern Finland, tillage has a great influence on soil losses. The frequency of tillage needs to be reduced rather than the depth of tillage on clayey soils with poor water conductivity and structural stability if soil loss is to be diminished by conservation tillage. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{reduction}} of soil tillage depth is {{of special interest}} in organic farming. However, shallow ploughing often results in higher weed abundances in comparison to deep ploughing. Thus, {{the objective of this}} study was to evaluate whether the high weed suppressive ability of spring and winter pea-cereal intercrops can compensate for the higher weed growth in shallow ploughing compared to deep ploughing in organic farming. Peas and cereals were grown as sole crops and intercrops under shallow and deep ploughing in experiments on a sandy loam soil in Northern Germany in 2009, 2010 and 2011. Semi-leafless spring peas-oats, semi-leafless winter peas-triticale and regular-leaf type winter peas-triticale intercrops were examined. At harvest, weed shoot biomass in semi-leafless spring and winter pea sole crops under deep ploughing were slightly higher than those of the corresponding intercrops under shallow ploughing. Whereas weed shoot biomass in semi-leafless winter peas-triticale intercrops under deep ploughing was comparable to <b>shallow</b> ploughing, the <b>cultivation</b> of spring peas-oats intercrops under shallow ploughing led to a significantly higher weed growth than did deep ploughing. The regular-leaf type winter pea grown as a sole crop, or an intercrop with triticale, showed a higher weed suppressive ability than the semi-leafless peas. The tillage system had no significant influence on the weed infestation of sole and intercropped regular-leaf type winter peas. Semi-leafless spring peas-oats and winter peas-triticale intercrops could compensate for weed infestation differences under shallow ploughing compared to the corresponding pea sole crops under deep ploughing. Due to the high weed suppressive ability of regular-leaf type winter peas, shallow ploughing and deep ploughing, as well as sole cropping and intercropping, led to comparable weed infestation...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIf {{it comes}} to the {{advantages}} of conservation tillage practices, a considerable amount of evidence supports positive effects towards reduction of surface runoff and soil erosion. However studies concerning arable land frequently are conducted under ideal laboratory conditions or “controlled” field conditions, meaning that the experimental approaches were not managed by farmers in the way they usually perform conservation tillage but managed towards an optimisation of the tested features. In addition, applicability of different existing conservation tillage techniques such as no tillage or mulching may be regionally different. The alpine forelands of Central Europe are dominated by small scale farming systems which frequently have limited access to special machinery which is needed to successfully implement no tillage treatments. We therefore carried out rainfall simulation experiments employing conservation tillage practices to test the effectiveness of actual real life conservation tillage methods under conditions prevailing in the alpine forelands of Central Europe. Experiments were carried out in the years 2011 and 2012 for testing the relative performance of different mulching and no tillage treatments on surface runoff and erosion. The tested treatments for the year 2011 were a) no tillage with prior rough seedbed (NT 1), b) no tillage with prior fine seedbed (NT 2), c) mulching with rotary harrow (M 1), d) mulching with rotary harrow and disc harrow (M 2) and e) conventional tillage (CT 11). The tested treatments for the year 2012 were a) combined mulching (MC), b) mulching with loosened wheel tracks (M−T), c) mulching without loosened wheel tracks (M+T) and d) conventional tillage (CT 12). In 2011, total surface runoff and total soil loss for the different treatments were ordered as follows: NT 1 <NT 2 <CT 11 <M 1 <M 2. No significant differences for total soil loss could be identified. For total surface runoff differences were significant (p< 0. 05) between all treatments, except for NT 2 and CT 11. The treatments also differed with respect to runoff initiation, sediment concentrations and shear stress. As a main reason for the unexpected bad performance of the mulching treatments M 1 and M 2 lack of sufficient soil cover (M 1 : 6 %, M 2 : 11 %) together with <b>shallow</b> surface <b>cultivation</b> were identified. In 2012, total surface runoff and total soil loss for the different treatments were ordered as follows: MC<M−T<CT 12 <M+T. Although there were a visible trend in these results, significant differences could only be observed for total surface runoff between treatments MC and M+T (p< 0. 05). We attribute the good performance of treatment MC to the improved soil cover (25 %). Wheel tracks of treatment M+T obviously had influenced soil erosion and surface runoff. Under real life conditions of agricultural conservation practices in small scale farming systems, a sufficient soil cover was not obtained for mulching treatments in 2011 and only partially in 2012.

In the west and south-west, it is drained by the Okuku River flowing south to its junction with the Ashley; in the north-west by tributaries of the Waitohi River, {{a branch of the}} Huruni; and in the east by the North, Middle and South Branches of the Waipara River. Access to the northern part is gained by the road to the ‘Virginia country’, ending at ‘Mt. Whitnow’ station twenty miles by road west of the township of Hawarden. A circuitous and little used road joining Whiterock and the north end of Lees Valley by way of Okuku and Lees Passes, affords access to {{the southern part of the}} area during dry weather. Two permanent homesteads are situated in the district, those of ‘Haydon Downs’ and ‘Melrose’ on the Virginia road in the extreme north-east; ‘The Brothers’ Station, on the South Branch of the Waipara near Lees Pass, is occupied intermittently during the summer. Three outlying musterers huts have been used during fieldwork. The country lies between 1500 and 4300 feet above sea level, ridge heights and steepness of slope generally increasing westwards. Sheep are carried over the whole area during the summer, but the higher country cannot safely be stocked during the winter months. A good cover of white tussock, native and exotic grasses is supported over the majority of the country below 3500 feet, but slopes are too steep, and the soil veneer generally too <b>shallow</b> to permit <b>cultivation.</b> Beech forest occurs in strands of up to 800 acres in extent, and becomes increasingly frequent westward; it is continuous over the country about the higher reaches of the Ashley River immediately west of the present area. The forest association is dominated by Mountain beech, with relatively rare strands of broadleaf, totara, houhere, kowhai, and red beech. The present rate of regeneration is inadequate to maintain the forest in all but a few isolated localities, but it is clear that here as elsewhere over the forested areas of Canterbury, decadence has been accelerated rather than originated by the depredations of introduced animals, by burning, and by other processes directly or indirectly associated with colonization...|$|R
40|$|The {{regulation}} of water {{regime in the}} soil {{is the most important}} task in semi-humid climate with not even precipitation distribution conditions. Reduced or minimum tillage may change soil hydrological properties. The objectives of this study were to investigate the possibilities to manage soil water regime during the whole soil tillage system for sugar beet, which are especially sensitive for water deficit or abundance. Five field experiments were carried out at the Ex-perimental Station of the Lithuanian University of Agriculture (Aleksandras Stulginskis University since 2011) (54 ˚ 52 'N, 23 ˚ 49 'E) during 1995 - 2010. The soil of the experiments was silty loam Luvisol. In this study we highlighted the reduction of primary soil tillage from deep annual soil ploughing to shallow ploughing, deep and <b>shallow</b> <b>cultivation</b> and no till, comparison of soil ploughing and subsoiling, presowing ploughed or unploughed soil tillage with different cultivators—S-tine, complex, rotary and others, soil compressing with Cambridge and spur rollers before and after sugar beet sowing investigations. According to the results of experiments, reduction of primary soil tillage conserved soil water. The highest storage of soil water in spring was observed in non-reversibly tilled or not tilled soil.

In a split-plot design, two main treatments (mouldboard ploughing to 25 cm depth and disc or springtine cultivation to 13 cm depth) were combined with two seedbed preparation treatments (three passes with a conventional harrow vs. one pass with a power take off (PTO) driven harrow). Seedbed characteristics and bulk soil properties investigated {{at one of the}} sites in 1991 were similar in the different treatments in the 0 - 13 cm layer. In the 13 - 25 cm layer <b>shallow</b> <b>cultivation</b> resulted in significantly higher bulk density, degree of compactness and penetration resistance, and lower root density than in mouldboard ploughing. A reduced number of tractor passes achieved by using the PTO driven harrow resulted in significantly lower bulk density and penetration resistance in the unploughed soil, while still providing an adequate seedbed. At 25 - 30 cm depth, the volume of pores with equivalent diameter > 100 um, saturated hydraulic conductivity and air permeability were higher with ploughless tillage than with conventional tillage. Pore continuity was greater in unploughed soil at all depths investigated. In unploughed plots there was a concentration of organic carbon and potassium in the upper 13 cm. Phosphorus distribution and pH were not altered by the tillage systems. The yield was improved by the PTO driven harrow both in ploughed and unploughed plots...|$|E

However, there is limited information on soil organic carbon storage due to influence of tillage type and soil texture under smallholder production systems in Ethiopia. The objective {{of this study was}} therefore to quantify soil organic carbon in different soil textures and tillage types; and to the contribution of livestock in improving soil carbon, soil structure and soil fertility. Fifteen sample sites were selected for soil chemical analysis details on crops, soil and land management practices for each sample site was collected through household interviews, key informants discussion and literature review. The carbon storage per hectare for the four soil textures at 0 to 15 cm depth were 68. 4, 63. 7, 38. 1 and 31. 3 t/ha for sandy loam, silt loam, loam and clay loam; respectively. Sand and silt loams had nearly twice the organic carbon content than loam and clay loam soil. The soil organic carbon content for tillage type at 0 to 15 cm was 8. 6, 10. 6, 11. 8 and 19. 8 g kg- 1 for deep tillage, minimum tillage, shallow tillage, and zero tillage; respectively. Among tillage types soil organic carbon storage could be increased by using the minimum and shallow tillage.

40|$|Soil seed banks on ex-arable {{land are}} {{dominated}} by undesirable ruderal species that compete with “desirable” target species during grassland restoration. At the same time, for continued regeneration, the latter often functionally depend on gap colonization from the seed bank, {{which serves as a}} buffer against local extinction. Nonetheless, few studies have so far investigated the effects of restoration practices on seed bank dynamics. Using a multisite experiment investigating techniques for restoring lowland mesotrophic grassland, we studied the effects of seedbed preparation (<b>shallow</b> <b>cultivation</b> using harrows or discs vs. deep cultivation using a plow) and of seed mixtures (species-rich grass–forb mixes vs. species-poor grass-only mixes vs. unseeded natural regeneration) on 7 years of post-restoration seed bank dynamics. We assessed how these practices affected density and diversity of sown and unsown species in the seed bank. Seed bank dynamics were much more strongly affected by seed sowing than by cultivation. Grass sowing resulted in stronger seed bank decline of unsown grasses, and additional forb sowing in stronger decline of unsown forbs. Higher seed densities and species richness of sown forbs colonizing from neighboring plots sown with the grass–forb mix were observed under natural regeneration than in the grass-only sown treatment, reflecting grass priority effects on sown forb colonization in the latter. Sowing of diverse target species mixtures was associated with the greatest shift in seed bank composition away from extant ruderal species towards sown target species.

40|$|Intensive tillage is {{commonly}} employed in many agronomic production {{systems in the}} United States. Tillage operations may include disking the field, re-smoothing the soil, seedbed formation, reducing the seedbeds, and <b>shallow</b> <b>cultivation</b> for weed control. Tillage practices in conjunction with rainfall {{have been linked to}} soil erosion, which may adversely affect the environment. The soil erosion dynamics of two large-scale production cotton fields that utilized both modern-conventional and conservation-tillage technology were examined. Studies were conducted in the cotton-producing region of southeast Arkansas in the Bayou Bartholomew watershed. Bayou Bartholomew is currently listed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency as an impacted stream. The soils at these sites were related, coarse-textured alfisols. One field was cropped to conventionally tilled cotton and intensively tilled. The second field was cropped to cotton using modern conservation tillage technology. Both fields were furrow-flow irrigated using piped water. Intense rainfall usually occurs in the Mississippi River Delta Region, particularly in the winter and spring months. Conservation tillage proved to be immediately beneficial in controlling soil erosion and sediment loss due to field run-off water from rainfall. Sediment content of run-off water induced by rainfall from the conventionally tilled cotton field was significantly greater than the sediments found in run-off water from the conservation tilled cotton field. The amount of sediment found in rainfall run-off water decreased more rapidly with time under conservation tillage than under conventional tillage. The tillage system made little difference in sediment content of run-off water from irrigation. The water flow from furrow irrigation is typically slow and steady. There is no droplet impact on the ground from furrow-flow irrigation as there would be from rainfall. Apparently, the gentle flow of the water down the furrows was insufficient to dislodge large numbers of soil particles...|$|E
40|$|Two {{field studies}} {{examining}} direct ecological weed control practices {{were conducted in}} Lexington, Kentucky. The first evaluated weed control efficacy and influence on yields of several mulches in two organically-managed bell pepper (Capsicum annum) production systems for two years. Peppers were planted in double rows in flat, bare ground or on black polyethylene-covered raised beds with drip irrigation, and four mulches (straw, compost, wood chips, and undersown white dutch clover (Trifolium repens L.) “living mulch”) were applied to the two production systems. In both years, polyethylene-covered raised beds produced higher yields than the flat, bare ground system. In the second year, the polyethylene-covered bed system coupled with mulching in-between beds with compost or wood chips after cultivation provided excellent weed control and yields. The second field study evaluated the efficacy of soil solarization and <b>shallow</b> <b>cultivation</b> on the invasive and noxious weed johnsongrass over two years (Sorghum halapense). A soil solarization treatment, using clear plastic stretched over soil for eight weeks, and a cultivated bare fallow treatment, utilizing a tractor pulled cultivator implement equipped with sweep blades, were randomly applied during the summers of 2003 and 2004 to a field infested with johnsongrass. Solarized and cultivated plots in both years were lightly tilled 8 months after completion of the initial treatment period. At {{the conclusion of the}} experiment the johnsongrass population was significantly reduced in all treatments and in the control plots compared to the original infestation.

40|$|A field {{experiment}} was initiated in 1997 with non-inverting soil tillage compared to conventional tillage with annual mouldboard ploughing to either 20 cm depth (CT) or 10 cm depth (RCT). The new system included a non-inverting mechanical loosening {{of the soil}} to approximately 35 cm depth combined with a <b>shallow</b> <b>cultivation</b> of the top 5 cm soil by either a rotovator (NIT) or an S-tine harrow (RNIT). The experiment was located on a sandy loam at the organic farmed Rugballegård Experimental Station. A plough pan at 20 - 35 cm depth was identified by cone penetration measurements. The non-inverting tillage system succeeded in breaking up the plough pan, which reduced the cone index from approximately 1. 8 MPa in the CT and RCT treatments to 0. 6 MPa in the NIT treatment. A detailed soil profile description of the top 30 cm of the soil indicated that root growth was restricted for especially CT and RCT treatments in the form of thickened and horizontally deflected roots at the interface between the topsoil and the plough pan at approximately 22 cm depth. For RCT a new plough pan was under development just below the present ploughing depth at 10 cm. This also resulted in root growth restriction, but to a lesser extent than the deeper plough pan. A soil drop test was performed to characterise soil fragmentation. Undisturbed cubic soil samples were taken from the 5 - 15 cm layer and dropped from 75 cm height in to a metal box. The resulting aggregate size distribution differed between the treatments with geometrical mean weight diameter (GMD) of 5. 7 mm 7. 4 mm and 8. 9 mm for CT, RCT and NIT treatments, respectively. The higher degree of fragmentation for the mouldboard ploughed soil may be explained by higher energy input per soil volume by mouldboard ploughing than by non-inverting deep loosening. The results indicate for the 5 _ 15 cm layer, that plant growth conditions were best for CT treated soil, due to a combination of low cone index and small aggregates. For the 20 _ 35 cm layer, the results indicates best plant growth conditions for NIT treated soil due to a low cone index and less restricted root growth. The spring barley/pea mix with grass/clover undersown yielded on average 47. 6 hkg/ha. There {{were no significant differences between}} treatments...|$|E
40|$|This project utilises study {{sites in}} slowly {{permeable}} soils with artificial tile drainage {{typical of the}} lowland study region in the North East of England. The three selected sites investigate sediment loss processes at a range of scales, from the field, to catchment. Sediment monitoring and in a 0. 6 km 2 farm ditch catchment indicated {{that the majority of}} sediment losses occur during a small number of large runoff events. Source fingerprinting suggested that over 50 % of the sediment is derived from arable tile drains, and approximately 10 % from the farm track. A small outlet sediment trap was partially effective, with 37 % sediment removal on average. It is estimated that a trap of 100 - 200 m 3 volume may be effective for a catchment of this size. Detailed plot study of tile drain sediment losses under winter cereals showed conventionally tilled land generated mean sediment losses of 333 kg. ha- 1 over a single winter. Over 80 % of total sediment loss was via tile drain rather than surface flow. The use of a <b>shallow</b> <b>cultivation</b> minimum tillage system significantly reduced mean sediment losses to 183 kg. ha- 1. Buffer strip treatments were not effective, particularly as they were unable to mitigate the majority of sediment loss occurring through the subsurface pathway. At the catchment scale the importance of topographically controlled concentrated runoff pathways was recognised as a key sediment loss issue. Channel erosion sediment losses of up to 750 kg. ha- 1 were estimated for one field in the catchment during a single runoff event. The retention of c. 1 t of sediment was recorded during the same event in a field with an engineered flood retention barrier. A novel field method of event sediment loss estimation is presented. An investigation of a wider catchment area demonstrated that tile drainage exceedance during flood events is a major source of field erosion and sediment loss. While surface runoff events are infrequent in this landscape, they are of high magnitude and the relatively small capacity of the drainage network results in concentrated flows of high erosive potential. The effectiveness of buffer strips is likely to be limited in these landscapes due to the role of concentrated runoff and subsurface sediment pathways. Grassed waterways and in-field soil conservation techniques {{are likely to be more}} effective against these two pathways respectively. Engineered structures also appear to be effective, and appear to be most justified where runoff control is also desirable. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Information on {{the effects}} of growing cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) -based crop {{rotations}} on soil quality of dryland Vertisols is sparse. The objective {{of this study was to}} quantify the effects of growing cereal and leguminous crops in rotation with dryland cotton on physical and chemical properties of a grey Vertisol near Warra, SE Queensland, Australia. The experimental treatments, selected after consultations with local cotton growers, were continuous cotton (T 1), cotton-sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench.) (T 2), cotton-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) double cropped (T 3), cotton-chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) double cropped followed by wheat (T 4) and cotton-wheat (T 5). From 1993 to 1996 land preparation was by chisel ploughing to about 0. 2 m followed by two to four cultivations with a Gyral tyne cultivator. Thereafter all crops were sown with zero tillage except for cultivation with a chisel plough to about 0. 07 - 0. 1 m after cotton picking to control heliothis moth pupae. Soil was sampled from 1996 to 2004 and physical (air-filled porosity of oven-dried soil, an indicator of soil compaction; plastic limit; linear shrinkage; dispersion index) and chemical (pH in 0. 01 M CaCl 2, organic carbon, exchangeable Ca, Mg, K and Na contents) properties measured. Crop rotation affected soil properties only with respect to exchangeable Na content and air-filled porosity. In the surface 0. 15 m during 2000 and 2001 lowest air-filled porosity occurred with T 1 (average of 34. 6 m 3 / 100 m 3) and the highest with T 3 (average of 38. 9 m 3 / 100 m 3). Air-filled porosity decreased in the same depth between 1997 and 1998 from 45. 0 to 36. 1 m 3 / 100 m 3, presumably due to smearing and compaction caused by <b>shallow</b> <b>cultivation</b> in wet soil. In the subsoil, T 1 and T 2 frequently had lower air-filled porosity values in comparison with T 3, T 4 and T 5, particularly during the early stages of the experiment, although values under T 1 increased subsequently. In general, compaction was less under rotations which included a wheat crop (T 3, T 4, T 5). For example, average air-filled porosity (in m 3 / 100 m 3) in the 0. 15 - 0. 30 m depth from 1996 to 1999 was 19. 8 with both T 1 and T 2, and 21. 2 with T 3, 21. 1 with T 4 and 21. 5 with T 5. From 2000 to 2004, average air-filled porosity (in m 3 / 100 m 3) in the same depth was 21. 3 with T 1, 19. 0 with T 2, 19. 8 with T 3, 20. 0 with T 4 and 20. 5 with T 5. The rotation which included chickpea (T 4) resulted in the lowest exchangeable Na content, although differences among rotations were small. Where only a cereal crop with a fibrous root system was sown in rotation with cotton (T 2, T 3, T 5) linear shrinkage in the 0. 45 - 0. 60 m depth was lower than in rotations, which included tap-rooted crops such as chickpea (T 4) or continuous cotton (T 1). Dispersion index and organic carbon decreased, and plastic limit increased with time. Soil organic carbon stocks decreased at a rate of 1. 2 Mg/ha/year. Lowest average cotton lint yield occurred with T 2 (0. 54 Mg/ha) and highest wheat yield with T 3 (2. 8 Mg/ha). Rotations which include a wheat crop are more likely to result in better soil structure and cotton lint yield than cotton-sorghum or continuous cotton...|$|E
40|$|Abstract]: Sugarcane {{farmers in}} Bundaberg have had {{limited access to}} {{irrigation}} water over the last ten years. The district {{has the potential of}} growing 3. 8 million tonnes of sugarcane. However, a series of dry seasons saw this reduce to 2. 1 million tonnes in 2002. Compounding the effects of both dry seasons and limited water supplies has been a 30 % reduction in the sugar price over this period. The irrigation requirement of sugarcane in the Bundaberg area is 8 ML/ha. The original allocated volume for sugarcane production in this area was 4. 5 ML/ha (based on 1970 production areas). However, as the area under production has increased and announced allocations in each year has reduced, this allocation is now equivalent to an application volume of about 2 ML/ha A change from the traditional practice of full irrigation is required as water supplies become depleted. As there were no clear guidelines on how growers could respond to diminishing water supplies, this research investigated opportunities to fine tune irrigation practices and the performance of irrigation systems (ie. low cost solutions) that would assist growers to maximise sugarcane yield. A grower survey was initially conducted to identify current practice and opportunities for change. Field investigations focused on the performance of water winch and furrow irrigation systems, which make up 91 % of the irrigated area in the district. As most of these application systems have insufficient capacity to meet crop demands opportunities to schedule irrigations were limited to start up after rain. Improvements in irrigation system performance were found to provide the greatest potential to increase sugarcane yield under conditions of limited water. Investigations identified that irrigation performance could be significantly improved through relatively minor adjustment. Field trials found that wind speed and direction significantly influenced the performance of travelling gun irrigators. Although growers were generally aware of the effects of wind, meteorological data suggested that the opportunity to operate water winches in low wind conditions is limited. Changing to a taper nozzle under moderate to high wind conditions will reduce the effect of wind on performance. This practice was found to improve the uniformity (measured by Christiansen’s Uniformity Coefficient, CU) by 16 %. The grower survey indicated that there was no preference towards the use of taper nozzles in windy conditions. Additional trial work developed a relationship between the variation in water applied to the field through non uniformity and sugarcane yield. An 8 % reduction in yield was determined for a 10 % reduction in CU. This indicated that changing to a taper nozzle could potentially increase sugarcane yield by 15 % in high wind conditions. Other settings, which also influenced uniformity, included lane spacing and gun arc angle Simple changes to the operation of furrow irrigation systems were also found to dramatically improve irrigation performance. Field measurements in combination with simulation modelling of irrigation events using SIRMOD II identified that current irrigation performance ranged in application efficiency from 45 to 99 % (mean of 79 %) and a distribution uniformity from 71 to 93 % (mean of 82 %). Both application efficiency and distribution uniformity were increased to greater than 90 % and 84 % respectively, except on a cracking clay soil. Improvements in application efficiency and distribution uniformity were achieved by adjusting furrow flow rate (cup size), turning the irrigation off at the right time (ie. just as it {{reached the end of the}} field) and banking the end of the field. Growers had a good understanding of the correct cut off time and were attentive to reducing run off through either banking ends or tail water return. However, growers had a poor understanding of the significance of furrow flow rate. Other opportunities to improve irrigation performance on high infiltration soils included alternate furrow irrigation and <b>shallow</b> <b>cultivation</b> practices which maintained compaction in the interspace and reduced infiltration. Soil moisture and crop growth measurements indicated that sugarcane yield could be maximised by starting the irrigation rotation earlier after rainfall (ie. at a deficit equal to the irrigation amount). These observations were modelled using the crop simulation model APSIM sugar to assess the strategy over a longer time interval and the influence of seasonal variation. Simulation modelling showed that final sugarcane yields were not sensitive to irrigation start-up strategies. Yields for the start-up strategies modelled varied by less than 5 tc/ha. This minor difference occurred as the crop yield was driven by the total amount of water available to the plant. The limited amount of irrigation water available to the plant (2 to 3 ML/ha) had only a minor effect on the water balance and no significant change to effective rainfall between strategies. The greatest difference in yield occurred between irrigation treatments when water was left over at the end of the season (9. 2 tc/ha). Starting irrigation earlier after rainfall events (on a 14 day rotation) provided the greatest opportunity to use all of the available irrigation supply. By comparison, delaying the application of the first irrigation after rainfall resulted in some of the irrigation water not being applied in 30 % of years...|$|E
40|$|Permanent {{raised bed}} (PRB) farming systems combine several {{elements}} (e. g. reduced tillage, controlled traffic, stubble retention) of conservation agriculture. PRB systems {{have recently been}} introduced into irrigated areas {{but there is a}} lack of information on the agronomic and irrigation performance of these systems under these conditions. Three years of field research into the performance of irrigated PRBs was conducted in south east Queensland, Australia and north west Pakistan. These studies benchmarked the irrigation performance of variously sized PRB systems and explored the impact of bed renovation method (no tillage (NT), <b>shallow</b> <b>cultivation</b> (SC) and blade ploughing (BP)) on soil hydro-physical properties (bulk density, soil moisture storage, infiltration), irrigation performance, crop yield and input water productivity (WP). Irrigation management strategies to improve lateral infiltration and irrigation performance were also investigated. The initial benchmarking study was conducted on two farms with clayey Vertisol (Australia) and three farms with sandy clay loam, Alfisol, (Pakistan) soils. The results showed low irrigation performance with excessive deep drainage potential. The irrigation application efficiency (Ea) on the clayey Vertisol and sandy clay loam was as low as 68 % and 50 %, requirement efficiency (Er) 96 % and 77 % and distribution uniformity (DU) 86 % and 66 %, respectively. However, the majority of the narrow beds (66 cm furrow spacing) were over-irrigated on the sandy clay loam while the wide beds (132 cm furrow spacing) were under-irrigated. Inappropriate renovation and bed furrow dimensions, sub-optimal irrigation management and poor lateral infiltration were the main factors likely to affect WP of irrigated PRBs. The evaluation of bed renovation methods found that BP on the clayey Vertisol reduced (~ 6 %) the average seasonal bulk density of the surface 0 - 30 cm compared to the NT treatment. BP was found to produce higher lateral infiltration into the beds than either NT or SC. Freshly applied BP and SC produced a higher (~ 23 %) cumulative infiltration than NT but the effect was transient and was not significant in the following season when the PRB renovation treatments were not freshly applied. The SC beds slump more than the BP and NT beds. The soil water content in the beds indicated that there was increased water storage associated with BP. PRB renovation (i. e. SC or BP) was found to reduce irrigation performance on the clayey Vertisol when the irrigation was farmer managed. The volume of irrigation water applied to the fresh SC and BP treatments increased by up 13 % and 55 %, and Ea was reduced by up to 9 % and 29 % respectively, compared with NT during the 2010 wheat and 2011 corn seasons. NT produced a higher wheat yield and WP, but the lower wheat yield in the cultivated treatments was associated with poor crop establishment from a rough soil surface and inadequate seeder performance in this season. In the subsequent seasons, there was no significant difference in either the crop yields or WP between the bed renovation treatments. Field trials investigating the effect of bed renovation on infiltration were conducted on both soils. Significant differences in the amount of water infiltrated and stored in the bed shoulder and bed middle were found for periods of wetting consistent with normal irrigation practices. This suggests that the general assumption of uniform soil moisture distribution across the beds is not valid for wide PRB systems. The three different renovation methods also significantly affected lateral infiltration, suggesting tillage may be used as a management tool to improve bed wetting in low infiltration soils and subsided beds. Infiltration and soil-water movement were simulated using Hydrus 2 D. The simulations were found to be well correlated with the measured field data and an evaluation for the three PRB renovation methods confirmed that NT had the slowest, and BP the fastest, potential to wet the bed middle of the wide PRBs. Increasing the furrow water head from 4 cm to furrow full of water was also shown to reduce wetting time by more than 30 %. Lateral infiltration was poor in the sandy clay loam. The shortest wetting time (~ 15 hrs) required to wet the bed middle of a 132 cm wide bed to field capacity occurred when furrow full water head was applied to the BP treated bed. However, even this period of wetting may be difficult to achieve using current irrigation practices in Pakistan. The graphical model outputs developed can be used in developing guidelines to optimise bed width and irrigation management to ensure adequate lateral infiltration with different PRB renovation methods. Strategies to optimise irrigation management and field design while ensuring adequate lateral infiltration into the bed middle were evaluated using the surface irrigation model SIRMOD. Optimising the inflow rate (Q) and the time to cut-off (Tco) for the particular field length was found to produce up to a 38 % irrigation water saving compared with existing practices. However, the majority of the wide beds on the sandy clay loam required higher inflow volumes than currently applied, which increased Er but reduced Ea. Optimising furrow length indicated a further improvement in irrigation performance. Similarly, Q and Tco optimisation together showed up to 35 % irrigation water saving and up to 33 % improved Ea for the most sub-optimally managed BP treatment. Decreased furrow length improved irrigation performance for freshly renovated PRB, while irrigation performance of settled bed furrows tended to increase with increased furrow length. Relating optimum Tco to water advance to furrow tail end (Ta) was sensitive to furrow length, Q and soil infiltration functions. The decision support guidelines developed were helpful in improving existing irrigation performance under both soil conditions. This research has shown that the existing irrigation performance of PRBs is often low and highly variable. A key constraint is the potential for poor lateral infiltration into the beds and inadequate wetting to the centre of wide beds. However, this work has also highlighted that the adoption of appropriate bed renovation methods (particularly BP) and irrigation management practices (e. g. Q and Tco) can substantially improve irrigation performance and input WP. Although the applicability of the specific decision support tools developed is restricted to the soil types and field conditions encountered, the general understanding and insight into the basic principles of performance optimisation and for agronomic and irrigation interactions is expected to be beneficial in refining understanding and the promotion of sustainable crop production under a wider range of environmental conditions. ...|$|E
