5|$|A key {{ingredient}} to the Hammond organ's success {{was the use}} of dealerships and a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>community.</b> Several dedicated organ dealers set up business in the United States and there was a bi-monthly newsletter, The Hammond Times, mailed out to subscribers. Advertisements tended to show families gathered around the instrument, often with a child playing it, as an attempt to show the organ as a center-point of home life and to encourage children to learn music.|$|E
5|$|The <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>community</b> {{that arose}} from working and living {{together}} contributed {{directly to the}} energy and growth of the first union of women workers, the Lowell Female Labor Reform Association. Started by twelve operatives in January 1845, its membership grew to 500 within six months, and continued to expand rapidly. The Association was run completely by the women themselves: they elected their own officers and held their own meetings; they helped organize the city’s female workers, and set up branches in other mill towns. They organized fairs, parties, and social gatherings. Unlike many middle-class women activists, the operatives found considerable support from working-class men who welcomed them into their reform organizations and advocated for their treatment as equals.|$|E
40|$|<b>Sense</b> <b>of</b> virtual <b>community</b> (feelings <b>of</b> identity, belonging, and attachment) is an {{essential}} component <b>of</b> virtual <b>communities.</b> In this chapter, we develop a model <b>of</b> how <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> virtual <b>community</b> develops in professional virtual <b>communities.</b> Based on <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> virtual <b>community</b> models in social virtual communities, we expect that the exchange of support, development of a group identity, and group norms {{will lead to a}} stronger professional <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> virtual <b>community.</b> Unlike social virtual communities, we also predict that employee/members occupational identification will increase professional <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> virtual <b>community,</b> particularly when the virtual community can provide support and information not available in the employee/member’s face-to-face life. Finally, we propose that increased occupational commitment, professional networks, and employee performance are outcomes <b>of</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> virtual <b>community</b> in professional virtual communities...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the impact <b>of</b> a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> {{classroom}} <b>community</b> and social presence on learning satisfaction in a cyber learning setting. The subjects in this study were 172 sixth graders in M elementary school in the city of D, who studied in a cyber setting at home. A survey was conducted to gather data, and multiple regression analysis were carried out to determine the influence <b>of</b> a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> classroom <b>community</b> and social presence on learning satisfaction. As a result, it is found that a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> classroom <b>community</b> and social presence had a significant correlation to learning satisfaction. A <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> classroom <b>community</b> turned out to affect learning satisfaction. A <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> classroom <b>community</b> are a major variable that should seriously be taken into account in an elementary cyber learning setting in order to boost the learning satisfaction of learners.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to {{determine}} whether an instructor’s intentional effort to build community in his/her classroom results in a higher <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> classroom <b>community</b> among students. This study also examined what types <b>of</b> <b>community</b> building activities were conducted by each instructor and measured the students’ responses to each different activity. This was intended to establish a preliminary set of best practices for creating classroom community. A two-part questionnaire, including an adapted version <b>of</b> the Classroom <b>Community</b> Scale, was administered to instructors (n= 5) and students (n= 113) enrolled in two or four unit courses at California Polytechnic State University. These courses were designed to introduce students to their chosen majors. One-way analysis of variance, and two-proportion tests were used to determine the relationship between instructor intentions and student <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> classroom <b>community,</b> and the differences in student <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> classroom <b>community</b> between courses. Findings indicate that what course a student was in was the significant factor in determining <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> classroom <b>community.</b> Additionally, students accurately perceived their instructor’s intent to create classroom community...|$|R
5|$|In June 1852 Morris entered Oxford University's Exeter College, {{although}} {{since the}} college was full, he only went into residence in January 1853. He disliked {{the college and}} was bored by {{the manner in which}} they taught him Classics. Instead he developed a keen interest in Medieval history and Medieval architecture, inspired by the many Medieval buildings in Oxford. This interest was tied to Britain's growing Medievalist movement, a form of Romanticism that rejected many of the values of Victorian industrial capitalism. For Morris, the Middle Ages represented an era with strong chivalric values and an organic, pre-capitalist <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>community,</b> both of which he deemed preferable to his own period. This attitude was compounded by his reading of Thomas Carlyle's book Past and Present (1843), in which Carlyle championed Medieval values as a corrective to the problems of Victorian society. Under this influence, Morris's dislike of contemporary capitalism grew, and he came to be influenced by the work of Christian socialists Charles Kingsley and Frederick Denison Maurice.|$|E
5|$|The North End Halifax {{neighbourhood}} of Richmond {{bore the}} brunt of the explosion. In 1917, Richmond was considered a working-class neighbourhood and had few paved roads. After the explosion, the Halifax Relief Commission approached the reconstruction of Richmond as an opportunity to improve and modernize the city's North End. English town planner Thomas Adams and Montreal architectural firm Ross and Macdonald were recruited to design a new housing plan for Richmond. Adams, inspired by the Victorian garden city movement, aimed to provide public access to green spaces and to create a low-rise, low-density and multifunctional urban neighbourhood. The planners designed 326 large homes that each faced a tree-lined, paved boulevard. They specified that the homes be built with a new and innovative fireproof material, blocks of compressed cement called Hydrostone. The first of these homes was occupied by March 1919. Once finished, the Hydrostone neighbourhood consisted of homes, businesses and parks, which helped create a new <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>community</b> in the North End of Halifax. It has now become an upscale neighbourhood and shopping district. In contrast, the equally poor and underdeveloped area of Africville was not included in reconstruction efforts.|$|E
5|$|The plague in London largely {{affected}} the poor, as the rich {{were able to}} leave the city by either retiring to their country estates or residing with kin {{in other parts of the}} country. The subsequent Great Fire of London, however, ruined many city merchants and property owners. As a result of these events, London was largely rebuilt and Parliament enacted the Rebuilding of London Act 1666. Although the street plan of the capital remained relatively unchanged, some improvements were made: streets were widened, pavements were created, open sewers abolished, wooden buildings and overhanging gables forbidden, and the design and construction of buildings controlled. The use of brick or stone was mandatory and many gracious buildings were constructed. Not only was the capital rejuvenated, but it became a healthier environment in which to live. Londoners had a greater <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>community</b> after they had overcome the great adversities of 1665 and 1666.|$|E

5|$|Currently McMaster has twelve smoke-free student residences: Bates, Brandon, Edwards, Hedden, Les Prince, Mary E. Keyes, Matthews, McKay, Moulton, Wallingford, Whidden, and Woodstock Hall. McMaster's student residences can {{accommodate}} 3,685 students. The latest residence {{to be built}} was Les Prince Hall, a large co-ed building, completed in 2006. It was named for a long-time hall master in the residence system who lived with his family on campus until after his retirement in 1980. In September 2010, 49 percent of first-year students lived on campus, with 17.1 percent of the overall undergraduate population living on campus. Residences provide traditional room and board style, furnished apartment style, and suite-style accommodation. Brandon Hall houses the university's substance-free lifestyle living spaces. The residence system is supervised by Residence Life staff, who provide guidance and help the transition to university life for many first-year students. Residence students are represented by the Inter-Residence Council (IRC), which aims to build a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>community</b> among the residents through programming. Additionally, the IRC seeks to advocate for residence students on issues they may face, such as facilities, dining, environment, and more, and provide opportunities for residence students to gain valuable leadership opportunities. They {{are an integral part}} of the McMaster residence community.|$|E
5|$|Central to Edward III's {{policy was}} {{reliance}} on the higher nobility for purposes of war and administration. While his father had regularly been in conflict with a great portion of his peerage, Edward III successfully created a spirit of camaraderie between himself and his greatest subjects. Both Edward I and Edward II had been limited in their policy towards the nobility, allowing the creation of few new peerages during the sixty years preceding Edward III's reign. The young king reversed this trend when, in 1337, as a preparation for the imminent war, he created six new earls on the same day. At the same time, Edward expanded {{the ranks of the}} peerage upwards, by introducing the new title of duke for close relatives of the king. Furthermore, Edward bolstered the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>community</b> within this group by the creation of the Order of the Garter, probably in 1348. A plan from 1344 to revive the Round Table of King Arthur never came to fruition, but the new order carried connotations from this legend by the circular shape of the garter. Edward's wartime experiences during the Crécy campaign (1346–7) seem to have been a determining factor in his abandonment of the Round Table project. It has been argued that the total warfare tactics employed by the English at Crécy in 1346 were contrary to Arthurian ideals and made Arthur a problematic paradigm for Edward III, especially {{at the time of the}} institution of the Garter. There are no formal references to King Arthur and the Round Table in the surviving early fifteenth-century copies of the Statutes of the Garter, but the Garter Feast of 1358 did involve a round table game. Thus there was some overlap between the projected Round Table fellowship and the actualized Order of the Garter. Polydore Vergil tells of how the young Joan of Kent, Countess of Salisbury – allegedly the king's favourite at the time – accidentally dropped her garter at a ball at Calais. King Edward responded to the ensuing ridicule of the crowd by tying the garter around his own knee with the words honi soit qui mal y pense – shame on him who thinks ill of it.|$|E

The threats to acquisitions of social symbols are so numerous, varied and frequently incomprehensible, that defensiveness, as well as competitiveness, becomes a way of life.
