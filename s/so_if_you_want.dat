500|$|Not all reviews were positive. Entertainment Weekly writer Whitney Pastorek {{said the}} episode started strong {{with the fire}} scare scene, but [...] "tapered off into a disjointed plot" [...] that she felt would not win new viewers. She said many jokes went too long and lost momentum, but {{nevertheless}} wrote [...] "a lot of the episode’s humor was engaging and smart". Lorenzo Perez of The News & Observer said the Pam subplot was [...] "overworked" [...] and lacked impact, and the Dwight character was over-the-top, proving The Office writers clearly {{have no idea how}} to rein in Dwight Schrute. Perez also expressed doubt the show would attract a new audience because it ran too late into the night following the Super Bowl. However, Perez said he enjoyed the Black/Leachman cameos. Terry Morrow of the Knoxville News Sentinel said, [...] "This particular visit to The Office doesn't pop like most episodes". Morrow praised the Black/Leachman film, but said, [...] "To be upstaged by a B-plot, one not involving the show's main characters at all, {{is a bit of a}} misdirection the show doesn't need in a post-Super Bowl time slot." [...] USA Today critic Robert Bianco said the plot was extremely thin and the Black and Leachman cameos were humorless and grotesque. Bianco wrote, [...] "Unfortunately, in an hour you get at most a handful of funny moments. <b>So</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> funny from a comedy, look elsewhere." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, I didn't do much," [...] replied Leif. [...] "I {{only took}} possession, and didn't keep it. This {{was the way}} of it. Fourteen years after this voyage of Biarne, [about the year A.D. 1000] I was seized {{with a desire to}} see these new lands. I bought Biarne's ship from him, set sail with a good crew, and found the lands, just as Biarne had {{described}} them, far away to the south of Greenland. I landed and gave names to some places. At the farthest south point we built huts and spent the winter, but returned home in spring. I called this part Vinland, and this is the reason why: We had a German with us named Tyrker, who is with me here still. One day Tyrker was lost; I was very anxious about him, fearing that he had been killed by wild beasts or Skraelingers, [Esquimaux or savages, probably Indians,] so I sent out parties to search. In the evening we found him coming home in a state of great excitement, having found fruit which, he said, was grapes. The sight and taste of the fruit, to which he was used in his own land, had excited him {{to such an extent that}} we thought he was drunk, and for some time he would do nothing but laugh and devour grapes, and talk German, which none of us understood. At last he spoke Norse, and told us that he had found vines and grapes in great abundance. We found that this was true--at least we found a berry which was quite new to us. We went off next day, and, gathering enough to load our boat, brought them away with us. From this circumstance I called it Vinland. Two years after that my brother Thorwald went to Vinland, wintered three years there, was killed by the Skraelingers, and his men returned to Greenland. Then my youngest brother, Thorstein, who was Gudrid's husband, went off to Vinland to fetch home the body of our brother Thorwald, but was driven back by stress of weather. He was taken ill soon after that, and died. Since then Gudrid has dwelt with my household, and glad we are to have her. This is the whole story of Vinland; <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to know more about it you must e'en go on a voyage of discovery for yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|It is {{perfectly}} obvious {{that in any}} decent occupation (such as bricklaying or writing books) {{there are only two}} ways (in any special sense) of succeeding. One is by doing very good work, the other is by cheating. Both are much too simple to require any literary explanation. If you are in for the high jump, either jump higher than any one else, or manage somehow to pretend that you have done <b>so.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to succeed at whist, either be a good whist-player, or play with marked cards. You may want a book about jumping; you may want a book about whist; you may want a book about cheating at whist. But you cannot want a book about Success. Especially you cannot want a book about Success such as those which you can now find scattered by the hundred about the book-market. You may want to jump or to play cards; but {{you do not want to}} read wandering statements to the effect that jumping is jumping, or that games are won by winners. If these writers, for instance, said anything about success in jumping it would be something like this: [...] "The jumper must have a clear aim before him. He must desire definitely to jump higher than the other men who are in for the same competition. He must let no feeble feelings of mercy (sneaked from the sickening Little Englanders and Pro-Boers) prevent him from trying to do his best. He must remember that a competition in jumping is distinctly competitive, and that, as Darwin has gloriously demonstrated, THE WEAKEST GO TO THE WALL." [...] That is the kind of thing the book would say, and very useful it would be, no doubt, if read out in a low and tense voice to a young man just about to take the high jump. Or suppose that in the course of his intellectual rambles the philosopher of Success dropped upon our other case, that of playing cards, his bracing advice would run--"In playing cards it is very necessary to avoid the mistake (commonly made by maudlin humanitarians and Free Traders) of permitting your opponent to win the game. You must have grit and snap and go in to win. The days of idealism and superstition are over. We live in a time of science and hard common sense, and it has now been definitely proved that in any game where two are playing IF ONE DOES NOT WIN THE OTHER WILL." [...] It is all very stirring, of course; but I confess that if I were playing cards I would rather have some decent little book which told me the rules of the game. Beyond the rules of the game it is all a question either of talent or dishonesty; and I will undertake to provide either one or the other--which, it is not for me to say.|$|E
