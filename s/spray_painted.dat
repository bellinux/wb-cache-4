These works had either a black or white base (symbolic of her night and day work {{required}} of her for tagging), and investigated “the relationship between overlapping colors, light, glass and calligraphic movement”. For her canvases she is transferring her philosophy of connecting single parts to one piece - background, foreground, lines and shapes. To create those works, MadC uses <b>spray</b> <b>paint,</b> transparent <b>spray</b> <b>paint,</b> ink, watercolor, acrylic paint and acrylic markers.

50|$|Smrt's {{most notable}} {{invention}} is the upside-down aerosol <b>spray</b> <b>paint</b> can: {{a can of}} <b>spray</b> <b>paint</b> {{that can be applied}} while holding the can upside down (which is impossible with typical <b>spray</b> <b>paint</b> cans). This is widely used in municipal and highway applications for outlining parking lots, turn lanes, center lines, crosswalks, etc. They are also commonly used for painting hashmarks and lines on athletic fields. His patents date back to 1977 and include paint application devices, vacuum sealed packing materials, geodesic domes, and mechanical arms.|$|R

25|$|Fekner's Warning Signs project {{focused on}} accentuating deteriorating {{conditions}} that dominated New York City {{and its environs}} in the 1970s. In 1976, Fekner began to create site-specific temporary ‘word-signs’ using hand-cut cardboard stencils and spray paint on a relentless crusade concerned with social and environmental issues. First seen on the industrial streets and highways of Queens, the East River bridges, {{and later in the}} South Bronx, his ‘messages’ were <b>spray</b> <b>painted</b> in areas that were in need of construction, demolition or reconstruction. By labeling the structures, Fekner's objective was {{to draw attention to the}} accumulated squalor by urging city officials, agencies and local communities to be more responsible and take action. His first stencil projects, Industrial Fossil, Urban Decay, Decay/Abandoned, Instant This Instant That, and The Remains of Industry were not intended to remain for long periods of time. The projects succeeded when the existing condition was removed or remedied. In 1979, Fekner began experimenting with video and audio, working with Fred Baca on Environmental Stencils 77–79, a grainy, grim black & white 8mm film/video that not only documents Fekner's stencil projects, but is also a bleak portrait of New York City in ruins.|$|E

500|$|Vaillancourt Fountain, {{sometimes}} called Quebec libre!, [...] {{is a large}} fountain located in Justin Herman Plaza in San Francisco, designed by the Québécois artist Armand Vaillancourt in 1971. It is about [...] high and is constructed out of precast concrete square tubes. Long considered controversial because of its stark, modernist appearance, {{there have been several}} unsuccessful proposals to demolish the fountain over the years. It was the site of a free concert by U2 in 1987, when lead singer Bono <b>spray</b> <b>painted</b> graffiti on the fountain and was both praised and criticized for the action.|$|E

50|$|<b>Spraying</b> <b>paint</b> with {{compressed}} air {{can be traced}} back to its use on the Southern Pacific Railway in the early 1880s In 1887 Joseph Binks, the maintenance supervisor at Chicago's Marshall Field's Wholesale Store developed a hand pumped cold-water <b>paint</b> <b>spraying</b> machine to apply whitewash to the subbasement walls of the store. Francis Davis Millet, the decorations director for the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893, used Binks and his <b>spray</b> <b>painting</b> system to apply whitewash consisting of a mix of oil and white lead to the buildings at the Exposition, taking considerably less time than traditional brush painting and tuning it into what has been called the White City. In 1949, Edward Seymour developed a type of <b>spray</b> <b>painting,</b> aerosol paint, that could be delivered via a compressed aerosol in a can.|$|R

It premiered on Top of the Pops in the UK on March 28, 1997, several weeks ahead of its release as a single. The video opens with a thrown switchblade impaling a <b>spray</b> <b>painted</b> image. The impaled image is that of a blood dripping love heart with [...] "SUSIE + ME" [...] scrawled across it. Jackson and a group of dancers then enter a salsa dance hall and he begins to dance with a woman, [...] "Susie", while shaking a piece of percussion.

500|$|After the war, {{a public}} school was named after Borovčić-Kurir. In 1962, the 1st Split Partisan Detachment was commemorated with a [...] tall {{monument}} designed by Vuko Bombardelli, which was erected in Ruduša where the captured members of the detachment were executed. The monument was destroyed by an explosion in August 1992, during the Croatian War of Independence. It was renovated in 2009 with financial aid from {{the owners of the}} RNK Split football club, as several members of the detachment had played for the club before the war. In 1981, a monument dedicated to the detachment was placed in Vinkovačka street in Split. In July 2013, this monument was vandalized by unknown perpetrators who <b>spray</b> <b>painted</b> symbols of the Ustaše, swastikas, and the initials of the Croatian Civic Party (Hrvatska građanska stranka; HGS) and the Croatian Pure Party of Rights (Hrvatska čista stranka prava; HČSP).

500|$|Throughout the video, Jackson shows {{a sexual}} {{attraction}} towards the dancing woman—played by Sybil Azur.

The video closes {{in the same manner}} it began, with the switchblade impaling the <b>spray</b> <b>painted</b> image. The music video won the Brazilian TVZ Video Award: Best International Music Video of the Year. Interviewed on her experience during the video one of the dancers, Carmit Bachar (of The Pussycat Dolls) noted, [...] "I was called in by Vincent Paterson for 'Blood on the Dance Floor'. It was to have a Latin feel, some sort of mambo. I arrived wearing a little salsa dress, fish nets, heels, and my hair was up in a kind of bun with a flower. I was 'camera ready'. I showed up with the whole outfit. It's not that producers can't see what they like, or the potential in somebody, but what I do helps them to see their vision more".|$|E
500|$|As {{a student}} of Hans Hofmann she was taught to {{practice}} her art with a limited palette, using colors such as black and white, to [...] "discipline" [...] herself. These colors would become part of Nevelson's repertoire. She <b>spray</b> <b>painted</b> her walls black until 1959. Nevelson described black as the [...] "total color" [...] that [...] "means totality. It means: contains all... it contained all color. It wasn't a negation of color. It was an acceptance. Because black encompasses all colors. Black is the most aristocratic color of all. The only aristocratic color... I have seen things that were transformed into black, that took on greatness. I don't {{want to use a}} lesser word." [...] In the 1960s she began incorporating white and gold into her works. Nevelson said that white was the color that [...] "summoned the early morning and emotional promise." [...] She described her gold phase as the [...] "baroque phase", inspired by the idea being told as a child that America's streets would be [...] "paved with gold", the materialism and hedonism of the color, the sun, and the moon. Nevelson revisited the Noh robes and the gold coin collections at the Metropolitan Museum of Art for inspiration.|$|E

500|$|During a {{late night}} drug raid, Batman, the vigilante {{protector}} of Gotham City, discovers that the drug dealer he was tracking has already been assaulted and left for police to find. Next to his unconscious body is a <b>spray</b> <b>painted</b> Circle-A, announcing {{the arrival of a}} new vigilante, Anarky. Anarky continues his war against crime by targeting a business owner dumping pollutants in a river. Batman recognizes his M.O. and realizes he is attacking people based on the complaints raised in letters to the editor in a local newspaper. He alerts the police, who plan stake-outs at several events based on the letters. When Anarky strikes next, however, it is at a construction site unlisted in the paper. Anarky rallies the homeless to riot in response to the destruction of their [...] "Cardboard City", which has been bulldozed to build a new bank. Batman arrives but is attacked by the homeless mob so that Anarky may flee. The mob includes Legs, a homeless Vietnam veteran who Alan Grant would utilize as a partner for Anarky in future stories. Batman eventually catches Anarky, revealing him to be a disguised, twelve-year-old paperboy named Lonnie Machin. As a child prodigy with extensive knowledge of both radical philosophy and improvised munitions, Lonnie was confident that violent change was necessary to improve social conditions. Batman condemns his actions, but expresses admiration for his idealism.|$|E

During the instrumental portion {{in the middle}} of the song, Bono, lead singer of the band, climbed onto the sculpture and <b>spray</b> <b>painted</b> graffiti on it, reading [...] "Rock N Roll Stops The Traffic". Mayor Dianne Feinstein, who had been waging a citywide campaign against graffiti that had resulted in over 300 citations during the year, was angry and criticized Bono for defacing a San Francisco landmark. She said, [...] "I am disappointed that a rock star who is supposed to be a role model for young people chose to vandalize the work of another artist. The unfortunate incident marred an otherwise wonderful rock concert." [...] Bono was issued a citation for misdemeanor malicious mischief. [...] U2 manager Paul McGuinness said, [...] "This is clearly not an act of vandalism. This act was clearly in the spirit of the artwork itself." [...] The numerous callers to Ronn Owens' radio talk show on KGO-AM were evenly split, with younger listeners defending the singer's action and older ones not. [...] Bono soon apologized, saying [...] "I really do regret it. It was dumb." [...] The singer explained that he thought that he was honoring the artist's work and that the artist had agreed, but later Bono realized that the city owned the fountain. The group covered the cost of removal of the graffiti.|$|E
