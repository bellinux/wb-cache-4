40|$|Cytogenetic and {{molecular}} genetic studies have both clinical and biological significance in sarcomas. Differential diagnosis of round cell tumors is mainly based on occurrence of specific translocations, fusion genes, and gene copy number alterations. Specific fusion genes {{can be detected}} by standard chromosome banding analysis supported by multicolor FISH on cultured cells, by PCR on fresh or fresh frozen tumor material or by two-color interphase FISH on paraffin sections. All of these techniques are appropriate to diagnostic purposes and they are routinely used in many laboratories. However, the power of these methods does not suffice to screening of novel genetic changes, such as small deletions, amplfications, and fusion genes. Still, the search of novel prognostic, predictive, and therapeutic molecular targets requires effective screening. Molecular karyotyping by array-based methods has been proven to be powerful in screening of clinically and biologically relevant molecular changes in human neoplasias. There are different platforms for molecular karyotyping. In my talk I illustrate the power of oligo nucleotide array with 44. 000 probes in screening for novel genetic changes in sarcomas. The examples come mainly from osteosarcoma and Ewing <b>sarcoma.</b> <b>Th...</b>|$|E
40|$|Efforts to use fresh human sarcoma {{cells for}} {{evaluating}} antifolate resistance with an in situ thymidylate synthesis assay using 5 -['H] deoxyuridine were unsuccessful {{because of low}} thymidylate synthesis activity in enzymatically disaggregated tumors. By incubating tumor cell suspensions in supplemented RPMI- 1640 medium with 10 % fetal bovine serum for 3 days, activity of the in situ thymidylate synthesis assay markedly increased (1. 42 versus 0. 03 pmol/h/ 107 cells), thus allowing 75 % of samples to be evaluated for antifolate sensitivity. By criteria developed with a methotrexate-resistant and-sensitive cell line, this assay indicated that most sarcomas are naturally resistant to methotrexate (12 of 15). Natural resistance to 10 -ethyl-lO-deazaaminopterin and trimetrexate was also observed in 60 % of the samples (nine of 15, respectively). The results from the 3 -day in situ assay were confirmed by specific tests for resistance mechanisms in most <b>sarcoma</b> samples. <b>Th...</b>|$|R
