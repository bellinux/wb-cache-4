However, due to its deleterious effects, plant function-ing {{is affected by the}} ozone absorbed. It is thus necessary to both predict total ozone deposition to ecosystems and parti-tion the fluxes in stomatal and non-stomatal pathways. The Surfatm-O 3 model was developed to predict ozone deposi-tion to agroecosystems from sowing to harvest, taking into account each deposition pathways during bare soil, growth, maturity, and senescence periods. An additional sink was added during senescence: stomatal deposition for yellow leaves, not able to photosynthesise but transpiring. The model was confronted to measurements performed over three maize crops in different regions of France. Modelled and measured fluxes agreed well for one dataset for any pheno...|$|E

In a reply by Schoeberl and Stolarski, additional TOMS observations are reported which suggest that some uncompensated ozone loss may be occurring in the spring Antarctic in the most recent years.

40|$|Mixing {{ratios of}} BrO have been {{measured}} in the Arctic lower statosphere with an instrument mounted on the NASA ER- 2 aircraft. Observations from fourteen flights above the Arctic Circle in January and February of 1989 defined mixing ratios within the vortex of 4 + or - 2 parts per trillion by volume (pptv) at a potential temperature of 400 K, rising to 8 + or - 2 pptv at 470 K. These values are {{twice as large as}} values found at equivalent potential temperatures at lower latitudes, and are comparable to the mixing ratios found inside the antarctic polar vortex. Within the statistical uncertainty of the measurements, no BrO was observed in darkness at any time either inside or outside of the vortex, indicating that active bromine was sequestered in long-lived reservoirs, probably BrONO 2 and BrCl. These measurements, in conjuction with measurements of ClO, demonstrate that the interaction of bromine and chlorine could represent a major <b>sink</b> <b>for</b> <b>ozone</b> in the presence of sunlight...|$|E

To study the importance of deposition of ozone in Siberia, we analyse measurements of ozone mixing ratios taken along the Trans-Siberian railway by train, air-borne measurements and point measurements at the Zotino station. For all data, we ran the Lagrangian particle dispersion model FLEXPART in backward mode for 20 d, which yields the so-called potential emission sensitivity (PES) fields.

40|$|Nitric oxide (NO) plays a {{key role}} in tropospheric photo-chemistry. The {{photochemical}} oxidation of hydrocarbons, for example, can serve as either a source or a <b>sink</b> <b>for</b> <b>ozone,</b> depending on the local abundance of NO. Nitric oxide also helps govern atmospheric concentrations of the hydroxyl (OH) radical. The OH radical is the single most important player in photochemical transformations because it controls the atmospheric lifetimes of so many chemical species. Although NO serves as a very effective catalyst in many important chemical processes, its concentration is low enough to normally be expressed in units of parts per trillion by volume (pptv). Consequently, commercially available detectors for NO (with detection limits of about one part per billion) have proven to be unsuitable for use anywhere except in urban areas and near other local pollution sources. Under the sponsorship of NASA's Global Tropospheric Experiment (GTE), Wallops has developed an extremely sensitive detector with a detection limit of a few pptv. The system was specifically designed for aircraft use, with the objective of applying it in global aircraft studies of tropospheric chemistry. Studies with the detector are examined...|$|E
40|$|International audienceResults from a tropospheric {{three-dimensional}} {{chemical transport}} model (TOMCAT) {{have been used}} to examine the terms of the ozone budget, both regionally and globally. The global calculations are discussed in light of other published estimates. Regional budgets are calculated for continental regions, including the American Mid-West, Sahara, and central Europe. These are compared with regional budgets for oceanic regions, including the Azores High and the Tropical Pacific Warm Pool. Furthermore, the coastal region of the UK and Ireland is also considered. The validity of these regional budgets from TOMCAT are discussed by comparing TOMCAT with measurements from a number of aircraft campaigns. The budgets for central Europe and the American Mid-West indicate that continental regions dominate the ozone budget of the northern extratropics. This is in spite of the remote oceanic regions being photochemical <b>sinks</b> <b>for</b> <b>ozone.</b> The regional budget calculations for the UK and Ireland exhibit net photochemical production of ozone in the boundary layer but this is not consistent with available aircraft measurements. This is attributed to the coarse horizontal resolution of the TOMCAT model which results in the model's photochemical budget being more typical of a polluted continental region than a relatively remote one. On the other hand, the ozone photochemical rates calculated for the Azores High and the Tropical Pacific Warm Pool agree rather well with other estimates...|$|R
40|$|Emissions of {{gases and}} {{particles}} from ocean-going ships {{may have a}} major impact on both photochemistry of the marine boundary layer and the biogeochemistry of the surface ocean. Throughout large regions of the ocean, ship emissions of SO 2 and sulfate aerosols greatly exceed the natural DMS-borne sulfur emissions. Ship emissions must, therefore, be taken into account in estimates of global climate forcing by sulfate aerosols (Activity 1. 3 of the SOLAS Science and Implementation Plan). Ship emissions are also a significant source of atmospheric nitrogen, and the deposition of this nitrogen into marine ecosystems might affect marine productivity (Activity 1. 5). Finally, ship emissions of gaseous hydrocarbons and carbonaceous aerosol particles may impact both gas phase photochemistry and aerosol radiative properties over the oceans. The effects of ship emissions on atmospheric photochemistry include the production of ozone in regions that are usually <b>sinks</b> <b>for</b> <b>ozone</b> and the pollution-induced release of reactive chlorine from sea salt (Activity 1. 2). The photochemical and radiative impacts of ship emissions may persist considerably longer than the lifetime of the ship plume itself. Ship traffic has increased significantly in recent years and is projected to keep increasing. In the Arctic Ocean, which is a particularly sensitive region, new routes are becoming available for international shipping due to decreasing sea ice cover in summer. Open ocean ship emissions are currently largely unregulated and shipping often relies on very dirty fuels that cannot be used for land-based transport.

It was found that the ecosystem exchange of CO 2 undergoes a well-defined diurnal variation driven by the input of solar radiation. A curvilinear relationship was found between solar irradiance and uptake of CO 2, with net CO 2 uptake at a given solar irradiance equal to rates observed over forests in other climate zones. The carbon balance of the system appeared sensitive to cloud cover on the time scale of the experiment, suggesting that global carbon storage might be affected by changes in insolation associated with tropical climate fluctuations. The forest was found to be an efficient <b>sink</b> <b>for</b> O 3 during the day, and evidence indicates that the Amazon forests could be a significant <b>sink</b> <b>for</b> global <b>ozone</b> during the nine-month wet period and that deforestation could dramatically alter O 3 budgets...|$|R
40|$|Measurements of hydrogen, {{nitrogen}} and chlorine radicals from a balloon flight on 25 September 1993 from Ft. Sumner, NM {{provide an opportunity}} to quantify photochemical production and loss of stratospheric ozone. Ozone loss rates determined using measured radical concentrations agree fairly well with loss rates calculated using a photochemical model. Catalytic cycles involving OH and HO 2 are shown to dominate photochemical loss of ozone for altitudes between 44 and 50 km. Reactions involving NO and NO 2 are the dominant <b>sink</b> <b>for</b> <b>ozone</b> between 25 and 38 km. The total ozone loss rate determined from the measurements balances calculated production rates for altitudes between 30 and 40 km. However, loss of ozone exceeds production by - 35 % between 42 and 50 km. The imbalance between production and loss of ozone above 42 km is larger than the uncertainty of any one of the critical kinetic parameters or species concentrations. No single adjustment to any of these parameters can simultaneously resolve the imbalance and satisfy constraints imposed by measured OH, HO 2, NO 2 and ClO. Our results are consistent with an additional mechanism for ozone production above 40 km other than photolysis of ground state O 2...|$|E
40|$|HVAC filters have a {{significant}} influence on indoor air quality. In addition to removing particulate contaminants, filters accumulate a particle layer that can react with ozone. Ozone-particle cake reactions serve as a <b>sink</b> <b>for</b> <b>ozone</b> {{and a source of}} secondary carbonyls. The location of filters in air distribution systems can lead to byproducts being distributed throughout a building. Two experiments were performed to determine the ozone removal efficiency on two residential filters that were loaded with particles for one month (# 1) and three months (# 2). On both filters, the ozone removal efficiency dropped rapidly during the first 30 minutes and then stayed approximately constant for 4 hours. The steady state values of ozone removal efficiency were 10 % for Filter # 1 and 14 % for Filter # 2 at a face velocity of 0. 81 cm/s. The potential for HVAC filters to affect ozone concentrations in residential buildings was evaluated using a well-mixed reactor model. The tested filters reduced indoor ozone levels slightly when compared to indoor surfaces and an entire HVAC system, although the impact was much smaller than that of the air exchange rate. The influence of continuous particle deposition was not considered here, but would likely increase the impact of ozone interactions on HVAC filters...|$|E

Since the last decades, some studies have been performed over forest, crops and grasslands for {{a better understanding of}} ozone deposition.

The LOTOS-model calculates ozone and other photo-oxidant concentrations in the lowest three km of the troposphere, using actual meteorologic data and emissions. We accounted for the altered radiative transfer in clouds and aqueous-phase chemistry (with and without iron and copper reactions in the aqueous phase). These cloud effects have been tested separately to distinguish their individual contribution to the ozone formation/degradation. Furthermore we estimated the effect of wet deposition parameterizing a upper-limit scavenging rate Model results are shown for a cloudy period in August 1990. We find for this period that the radiative effect of clouds lead, locally, to ozone reductions in the planetary boundary layer {{by as much as}} 22 %; overall to a reduction of ozone of 4 %. This coincides with a reduction of 14 % of the net ozone formation. When aqueous-phase chemistry was added the net ozone formation and concentration were further reduced, up to 20 % and 5 %, respectively. Although aqueous-phase chemistry can lead to a strong reduction of ozone formation in the cloud (up to 110 %), the overall effect is limited by the cloud volume fraction, cloud liquid water content and pH. The iron and copper reactions change the aqueous-phase reaction pathways substantially and render the droplet roughly a four times smaller <b>sink</b> <b>for</b> <b>ozone...</b>|$|E

Results show that the source regions for the surface ozone in Siberia are located at lower latitudes: the regions around the Mediterranean Sea, the Middle East, Kazakhstan andChina. Low ozone mixing ratios are associated to transport from North West Russia, the Arctic region, andthe Pacific Ocean. By calculating PES values for both a passive tracer without consideration of removal processes and for an ozone-like tracer where dry deposition processes are included, we are able to quantify the ozone loss occurring en route to the receptor.

However, due to its deleterious effects, plant functioning {{is affected by the}} ozone absorbed. It is thus necessary to both predict total ozone deposition to ecosystems and partition the fluxes in stomatal and non-stomatal pathways. The Surfatm-O 3 model was developed to predict ozone deposition to agroecosystems from sowing to harvest, taking into account each deposition pathways during bare soil, growth, maturity, and senescence periods. An additional sink was added during senescence: stomatal deposition for yellow leaves, not able to photosynthesise but transpiring. The model was confronted to measurements performed over three maize crops in different regions of France. Modelled and measured fluxes agreed well for one dataset for any phenological stage, with only 3 % difference over the whole cropping season. A larger discrepancy was found for the two other sites, 16 % and 19 % over the entire study period, especially during bare soil, early growth and senescence. This was attributed to site-specific soil resistance to ozone and possible chemical reactions between ozone and volatile organic compounds emitted during late senescence. Considering both night-time and daytime conditions, non-stomatal deposition was the major ozone sink, from 100 % during bare soil period to 70 – 80 % on average during maturity. However, considering only daytime conditions, especially under optimal climatic conditions for plant functioning, stomatal flux could represent 75 % of total ozone flux.

HO(x) affects the partitioning of nitrogen species in the NO(y) family. Its reactions are important sources and <b>sinks</b> <b>for</b> tropospheric <b>ozone,</b> thus providing a link between the NO(x) in aircraft exhaust and tropospheric ozone. OH mixing ratios are enhanced in aircraft wakes due to the photolysis of the HONO that is made close to the engine. Measurements of HO(x) in aircraft wakes, along with NO(x) measurements, thus provides a constraint on chemical models of the engine combustion and exhaust. The development of the Airborne Tropospheric Hydrogen Oxides Sensor (ATHOS) is reported. We designed, developed, and successfully flew this instrument.

40|$|Ozone {{is a key}} {{trace gas}} in the troposphere; {{because it is a}} {{greenhouse}} gas, it is very reactive, and it is potentially toxic to humans, fauna, and vegetation. The main <b>sink</b> processes <b>for</b> <b>ozone</b> are chemical reactions and the turbulent deposition flux to the earth’s surface. The deposition process itself is rather complex: The interactions between co-varying drivers such as the tropospheric ozone concentration, turbulence, and chemical reactions are not well understood. In the case of ozone deposition to vegetation, another aspect that must be studied is the role of stomatal regulation {{for a wide range of}} conditions. Therefore, we measured turbulent deposition fluxes of ozone with the eddy covariance technique during the peak of the growing season in 2014 over a managed, rewetted peatland in NW Germany. The deposition flux was large during the day (up to − 15 nmol m− 2 s− 1) and relatively small during the night (between − 1 and − 2 nmol m− 2 s− 1). Flux partitioning by applying the surface resistance analogy and further analysis showed that the stomatal uptake was smaller than non-stomatal deposition. The correction of stomatal conductance with the gross primary production (GPP) improved the estimation of day- and nighttime stomatal deposition fluxes. Statistical analysis confirmed that the friction velocity (u*) was the single most important driver of non-stomatal ozone deposition and that relationships with other environmental drivers are not linear and highly variable. Further research is needed to develop a better process understanding of non-stomatal ozone deposition, to quantify the role of surface deposition to the ozone budget of the atmospheric boundary layer, and to estimate uncertainties associated with the partitioning of ozone deposition into stomatal and non-stomatal fluxes...|$|R

While overall rates of O 3 deposition are known, the fractions of the flux absorbed by stomata and deposited to non-stomatal surfaces in the field have been poorly quantified. This paper reports 4 years of continuous fluxes by micrometeorological methods to moorland vegetation in southern Scotland. The flux has been partitioned between stomatal and non-stomatal fluxes and shows over a seasonal scale that the non-stomatal deposition (50 kg O 3 ha– y– 1) dominates the overall flux (77 kg O 3 ha– 1 y– 1) and represents 70 % of the total deposition. The surface resistance for non-stomatal O 3 deposition (rns) decreases with temperature from 400 s m– 1 at 0 °C to 200 s m– 1 at 15 °C in dry conditions and is consistent with thermal decomposition of ozone at the surface with an apparent activation energy of about 36 kJ mole– 1.

The maquis ecosystem acted as a net <b>sink</b> <b>for</b> <b>ozone.</b> The different water availability between late spring and summer was the major cause of the changes observed in stomatal fluxes, which decreased, together with evapotranspiration, when the season became drier. NOx concentrations were significantly dependent on the local meteorology. NOx fluxes resulted less intense than the ozone fluxes. However an average upward flux of both NO and NO 2 was measured. The non-stomatal pathways of ozone deposition were investigated. A correlation of non-stomatal deposition with air humidity and, in a minor way, with NO 2 fluxes was found. Ozone risk assessment was performed by comparing the exposure and the dose metrics: AOT 40 (Accumulated dose over a threshold of 40 ppb) and AFst 1. 6 (Accumulated stomatal flux of ozone over a threshold of 1. 6 nmol m&minus; 2 s&minus; 1 ).

We have performed simulations using a 3 -D chemical transport model (CTM) including three top-down and a single bottom-up derived emission inventory of the major brominated VSLS bromoform (CHBr 3) and dibromomethane (CH 2 Br 2). We perform the first concerted evaluation of these inventories, comparing both the magnitude and spatial distribution of emissions. For a quantitative evaluation of each inventory, model output is compared with independent long-term observations at National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) ground-based stations and with aircraft observations made during the NSF (National Science Foundation) HIAPER Pole-to-Pole Observations (HIPPO) project. For CHBr 3, the mean absolute deviation between model and surface observation ranges from 0. 22 (38 %) to 0. 78 (115 %) parts per trillion (ppt) in the tropics, depending on emission inventory. For CH 2 Br 2, the range is 0. 17 (24 %) to 1. 25 (167 %) ppt. We also use aircraft observations made during the 2011 Stratospheric Ozone: Halogen Impacts in a Varying Atmosphere (SHIVA) campaign, in the tropical western Pacific. Here, the performance of the various inventories also varies significantly, but overall the CTM is able to reproduce observed CHBr 3 well in the free troposphere using an inventory based on observed sea-to-air fluxes. Finally, we identify the range of uncertainty associated with these VSLS emission inventories on stratospheric bromine loading due to VSLS (Br y VSLS). Our simulations show Br y VSLS ranges from ~ 4. 0 to 8. 0 ppt depending on the inventory.

40|$|The {{variables}} controlling ozone deposition onto {{bare soil}} are still unknown {{and it is}} necessary to understand this pathway well, as it represents a significant <b>sink</b> <b>for</b> <b>ozone.</b> Eddy-covariance measurements of ozone (O 3) fluxes were performed over bare soils in agricultural land. Three datasets with contrasted meteorological conditions and soil nitric oxide (NO) emissions were used to study the factors controlling soil deposition. It is considered that ozone deposition can be represented with an aerodynamic resistance (Ra), a quasi-laminar boundary layer resistance (Rb O 3), and an additional resistance, named soil resistance (Rsoil). Although it is assumed in previous studies that soil resistance is a function of soil water content (SWC) and could be considered constant as variation of SWC at monthly scale are generally weak, {{the results of this study}} indicate that SWC is not the main factor controlling Rsoil which shows daily and hourly variations. The main factor controlling soil resistance is the surface relative humidity which is positively correlated with Rsoil, contrary to non stomatal resistance onto canopies which show a negative correlation with relative humidity. The relationship between Rsoil and the surface relative humidity is probably due to a decrease in the surface available for ozone deposition, due to an increasing adsorption of water molecules onto the ground with relative humidity. A new parameterisation of Rsoil was established, where Rsoil is a function of the surface relative humidity only (Rsoil = Rsoil min × e(k×RHsurf), and Rsoil min = 21 ± 1. 01 s m− 1 and k = 0. 024 ± 0. 001, mean ± SD). The measured and parameterised ozone deposition velocities agree well when soil NO emissions are negligible. However, when there are large soil NO emissions, the parameterised ozone deposition strongly underestimates the measured deposition velocity even if the chemical destruction of ozone by reaction with NO in the air column was evaluated to be negligible. This suggests that soil NO emissions enhance soil ozone deposition by chemical reaction at or near the soil surface. The new parameterisation allows a better estimation of soil deposition, especially during daytime when Rsoil is overestimated using previously published parameterisations.

40|$|Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} greenhouse gases and a major <b>sink</b> <b>for</b> stratospheric <b>ozone.</b> Estuaries are sites of intense biological production and N 2 O emissions. We aimed to identify hot spots of N 2 O production and potential pathways contributing to N 2 O concentrations in the surface water of the tidal Elbe estuary. During two research cruises in April and June 2015, surface water N 2 O concentrations were measured along the salinity gradient of the Elbe estuary by using a laser-based on-line analyzer coupled to an equilibrator. Based on these high-resolution N 2 O profiles, N 2 O saturations, and fluxes across the surface water/atmosphere interface were calculated. Additional measurements of DIN concentrations, oxygen concentration, and salinity were performed. Highest N 2 O concentrations were determined in the Hamburg port region reaching maximum values of 32. 3 nM in April 2015 and 52. 2 nM in June 2015. These results identify the Hamburg port region as a significant hot spot of N 2 O production, where linear correlations of AOU-N 2 Oxs indicate nitrification as an important contributor to N 2 O production in the freshwater part. However, in the region with lowest oxygen saturation, sediment denitrification obviously affected water column N 2 O saturation. The average N 2 O saturation over the entire estuary was 201 % (SD: ± 94 %), with an average estuarine N 2 O flux density of 48 ?mol m- 2 d- 1 and an overall emission of 0. 18 Gg N 2 O y- 1. In comparison to previous studies, our data indicate that N 2 O production pathways over the whole estuarine freshwater part have changed from predominant denitrification in the 1980 s toward significant production from nitrification in the present estuary. Despite a significant reduction in N 2 O saturation compared to the 1980 s, N 2 O concentrations nowadays remain on a high level, comparable to the mid- 90 s, although a steady decrease of DIN inputs occurred over the last decades. Hence, the Elbe estuary still remains an important source of N 2 O to the atmosphere...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of analysis {{of three different}} data sets: (i) Aircraft-based eddy correlation data collected above irrigated and non-irrigated agricultural land in Southern California during the California Ozone Deposition Experiment (CODE) summer 1991; (ii) micrometeorological tower data, collected over grape and cotton canopies as part of CODE; (iii) aircraft-based eddy correlation flux data above two grid sites in the Canadian boreal forest during the Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS), {{spring and summer of}} 1994 and 1996. Results from the CODE aircraft data document composition and size of the dominant structures, which transport heat and gases (H 2 O, CO 2 and ozone) over water stressed and non-water stressed surfaces, and the relative frequency with which structures carrying only a single scalar, or given combinations of scalars, were encountered along the flight paths. Interpretation of results provides further evidence for the existence of a second (nonphysiological) <b>sink</b> <b>for</b> <b>ozone.</b> The relative preponderance of structures that carry moisture, carbon dioxide and ozone simultaneously, particularly in the gradient-up mode, reflects the importance of vegetation as co-located source/sink for these scalars. The detrending procedures described in this study may help to define a more effective separation between local and mesoscale events in biosphere-atmosphere interaction. Results from the CODE tower data indicates a single vegetated ozone sink for the grape site, but a vegetated as well as a non-vegetated sink for the cotton site. For both sites, structures simultaneously transporting significant flux contributions of CO 2, H 2 O, heat and ozone dominate during unstable conditions. During stable conditions, unmixed single flux structures dominated over cotton but not over grape. The results of this study contribute empirical evidence about the relationship between ozone uptake and the physical and physiological state of vegetation, as well as the limitations placed on eddy scales in simulation models. Results from the BOREAS aircraft data shows a decoupling between the surface and the atmosphere, where the patterns of vegetation, greenness and surface temperature may be quite dissimilar to those of the fluxes of sensible heat, latent heat and [...] -to a lesser degree [...] -CO 2. Reasons for this lie in the extraordinary boundary layer conditions, high vapour pressure deficit, moist soil and hot canopies, and the response of the vegetation to these conditions. Analysis of the coherent structure compositions to some extent permits the characterization of the different sources and sinks. Overall, this study shows the importance of understanding the various interacting components of soil, vegetation and atmosphere when attempting to design process-based models for predictions in 'micrometeorologiacally' complex ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|In this dissertation, {{results are}} {{presented}} of laboratory investigations and mathematical modeling efforts designed {{to better understand the}} interactions of ozone with surfaces. In the laboratory, carpet and duct materials were exposed to ozone and measured ozone uptake kinetics and the ozone induced emissions of volatile organic compounds. To understand the results of the experiments, mathematical methods were developed to describe dynamic indoor aldehyde concentrations, mass transport of reactive species to smooth surfaces, the equivalent reaction probability of whole carpet due to the surface reactivity of fibers and carpet backing, and ozone aging of surfaces. Carpets, separated carpet fibers, and separated carpet backing all tended to release aldehydes when exposed to ozone. Secondary emissions were mostly n-nonanal and several other smaller aldehydes. The pattern of emissions suggested that vegetable oils may be precursors for these oxidized emissions. Several possible precursors and experiments in which linseed and tung oils were tested for their secondary emission potential were discussed. Dynamic emission rates of 2 -nonenal from a residential carpet may indicate that intermediate species in the oxidation of conjugated olefins can significantly delay aldehyde emissions and act as reservoir for these compounds. The ozone induced emission rate of 2 -nonenal, a very odorous compound, can result in odorous indoor concentrations for several years. Surface ozone reactivity is a key parameter in determining the flux of ozone to a surface, is parameterized by the reaction probability, which is simply the probability that an ozone molecule will be irreversibly consumed when it strikes a surface. In laboratory studies of two residential and two commercial carpets, the ozone reaction probability for carpet fibers, carpet backing and the equivalent reaction probability for whole carpet were determined. Typically reaction probability values for these materials were 10 {sup {minus} 7 }, 10 {sup {minus} 5 }, and 10 {sup {minus} 5 } respectively. To understand how internal surface area influences the equivalent reaction probability of whole carpet, a model of ozone diffusion into and reaction with internal carpet components was developed. This was then used to predict apparent reaction probabilities for carpet. He combines this with a modified model of turbulent mass transfer developed by Liu, et al. to predict deposition rates and indoor ozone concentrations. The model predicts that carpet should have an equivalent reaction probability of about 10 {sup {minus} 5 }, matching laboratory measurements of the reaction probability. For both carpet and duct materials, surfaces become progressively quenched (aging), losing the ability to react or otherwise take up ozone. He evaluated the functional form of aging and find that the reaction probability follows a power function with respect to the cumulative uptake of ozone. To understand ozone aging of surfaces, he developed several mathematical descriptions of aging based on two different mechanisms. The observed functional form of aging is mimicked by a model which describes ozone diffusion with internal reaction in a solid. He shows that the fleecy nature of carpet materials in combination with the model of ozone diffusion below a fiber surface and internal reaction may explain the functional form and the magnitude of power function parameters observed due to ozone interactions with carpet. The ozone induced aldehyde emissions, measured from duct materials, were combined with an indoor air quality model to show that concentrations of aldehydes indoors may approach odorous levels. He shows that ducts are unlikely to be a significant <b>sink</b> <b>for</b> <b>ozone</b> due to the low reaction probability in combination with the short residence time of air in ducts...|$|E
