25|$|The 1967 French Citroën DS and 1970 Citroën SM were {{equipped}} with an elaborate dynamic headlamp positioning system that adjusted the inboard headlamps' horizontal and vertical position in response to inputs from the vehicle's <b>steering</b> <b>and</b> <b>suspension</b> systems.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in the 2000s, {{there was}} a {{resurgence}} in interest {{in the idea of}} moving or optimizing the headlight beam in response not only to vehicular <b>steering</b> <b>and</b> <b>suspension</b> dynamics, but also to ambient weather and visibility conditions, vehicle speed, and road curvature and contour. A task force under the EUREKA organization, composed primarily of European automakers, lighting companies and regulators began working to develop design and performance specifications for what is known as Adaptive Front-Lighting Systems, commonly AFS.|$|E
500|$|An {{addition}} to the effects department was Mike Trim, who served as Meddings' assistant in designing vehicles and buildings. Meddings and Trim jointly pioneered an [...] "organic" [...] design technique in which the exteriors of models and sets were customised with parts from model kits and children's toys. Models and sets were also [...] "dirtied down" [...] with powder paint or pencil lead to create a used look. Toy cars and vans were used in long shot, while scale vehicles were equipped with basic <b>steering</b> <b>and</b> <b>suspension</b> for added realism. Miniature fans and Jetex pellets, which are capable of issuing air jets or chemical exhaust, were attached to the undersides to simulate dust trails. Another of Meddings' inventions was a closed, cyclical effects stage nicknamed the [...] "rolling road": consisting {{of two or more}} loops of canvas running at different speeds, this device allowed shots of moving vehicles to be filmed on a static set to make more efficient use of the limited studio space. Airborne aircraft sequences were mounted against a [...] "rolling sky", with smoke fanned across to simulate passing clouds.|$|E
50|$|The {{advantages}} {{of using a}} hub-center steering system instead of a more conventional motorcycle fork are that hub-center steering separates the <b>steering,</b> braking, <b>and</b> <b>suspension</b> functions.|$|R

50|$|Special <b>steering</b> rack, <b>and</b> <b>suspension</b> tuning with a {{self-leveling}} rear {{air suspension}} yielded handling performance comparable to European vehicles. Four wheel disc brakes improved stopping as did standard Goodyear Eagle GT tires, size 195/70R14 (large for the time).|$|R
2500|$|In December 2010, {{more than}} a year after the SLR was discontinued, McLaren {{announced}} a final body conversion of the supercar. [...] The 25-unit limited McLaren Edition is based on any earlier variant of the SLR besides the Stirling Moss and includes revised bodywork (front and rear bumper, grille, top shell, side gills, rear diffuser, rims) and interior parts, along with upgraded <b>steering</b> <b>and</b> <b>suspension</b> components and a new sports exhaust.|$|E
2500|$|Brazil and Argentina {{are engaged}} in several joint venture {{projects}} in the military field, such as the Gaucho armored vehicle and the Embraer KC-390 military transport aircraft. The Gaucho is a Light Strike Vehicle capable of reconnaissance, air assault, command and control, transport and evacuation missions. The Gaucho project started in 2004 and entered production in 2006. Argentina {{is responsible for the}} design and construction of the chassis, engine mounts, transmission, <b>steering</b> <b>and</b> <b>suspension.</b> Brazil, for its part, [...] developed and installed the brake system, engine, transmission and transfer case, as well as the cooling system, electrical system, fuel, armament and accessories.|$|E
2500|$|Mechanically, the Apollo's setup was a {{verbatim}} {{copy of the}} Camry, with <b>steering</b> <b>and</b> <b>suspension</b> calibrations left unchanged.

These V6-engined Apollos featured larger-diameter 15-inch wheels over the 14-inch diameter used on the 2.2. The 2.2-liter models also featured a five-speed manual as standard fitment, although an optional electronically controlled four-speed automatic transmission was offered at an extra cost—standard and the sole choice on V6s.|$|E

[...] The 315/1 and 319/1 were {{replaced}} by the BMW 328, {{which was based on}} an all-new tubular steel ladder frame, but used the <b>steering</b> gear <b>and</b> <b>suspension</b> of the 319/1.|$|R
2500|$|The Routemaster was a {{departure}} from the traditional chassis/body construction method. It {{was one of the first}} [...] "integral" [...] buses, with a combination of an [...] "A" [...] steel sub-frame (including engine, <b>steering</b> <b>and</b> front <b>suspension)</b> <b>and</b> a rear [...] "B" [...] steel sub-frame (carrying rear axle <b>and</b> <b>suspension),</b> connected by an aluminium body. The gearbox was mounted on the underside of the body structure with shafts to the engine and back axle. Later pre-war London trolleybuses, however, had previously adopted chassisless construction.|$|R

It is all-wheel drive with a 7-speed (C450 4M) or 9-speed automatic transmission (C43 4M). It reaches 62 mph in 4.9 seconds.|$|R

It was an updated version of the underfloor-engined AEC Regal IV, having an 11.3-litre AH690 engine instead of the Regal IVs 9.6-litre AH590 engine.

50|$|In some countries, {{customized}} sleeper vehicles (as {{with other}} heavily modified street cars) {{may be considered}} illegal for road use because the car's level of performance is higher than intended by the vehicle manufacturer; if the owner has focused only on straight-line performance, the existing braking, <b>steering,</b> tires, <b>and</b> <b>suspension</b> systems may have been rendered inadequate. The emissions control system (such as intake and exhaust restrictions or the EGR system) is often bypassed or removed entirely in customized sleeper vehicles.|$|R

50|$|The engine {{has a low}} 8.2 : 1 {{compression}} ratio, {{allowing it}} to run on low-octane gasoline. The four-wheel drive is engaged by a lever on the floor, as are the optional differential locks.

The interior is minimal, although the seats, from the contemporary Volkswagen Passat, were considered surprisingly comfortable by period observers. The tiny back seat has two individually folding seat backs, but can be considered mainly an occasional seat.|$|R

50|$|The Rover 200, codenamed R3, {{was smaller}} than the Honda-based R8 cars. This was due to Rover's need to replace the ageing Metro, which by now was 15 years old. Although some {{elements}} of the previous 200 / 400 were carried over (most notably the front structure, heater, <b>steering</b> <b>and</b> front <b>suspension),</b> it was by-and-large an all-new car that had been developed by Rover. Honda did provide early body design support {{as a result of}} moving production of the Honda Concerto from Longbridge to Swindon, freeing up capacity for 60,000 units at Rover. At this point, the car had a cut-down version of the previous car's rear floor <b>and</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>and</b> was codenamed SK3.|$|R
