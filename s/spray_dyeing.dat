50|$|Some organic mulches are colored red, brown, black, {{and other}} colors. Isopropanolamine, {{specifically}} 1-Amino-2-propanol or DOW™ monoisopropanolamine, {{may be used}} as a pigment dispersant and color fastener in these mulches. Types of mulch which can be dyed include: wood chips, bark chips (barkdust) and pine straw. Colored mulch is made by dyeing the mulch in a water-based solution of colorant and chemical binder. When colored mulch first entered the market, most formulas were suspected to contain toxic, heavy metals and other contaminates. Today, “current investigations indicate that mulch colorants pose no threat to people, pets or the environment. The dyes currently used by the mulch and soil industry are similar to those used in the cosmetic and other manufacturing industries (i.e., iron oxide),” as stated by the Mulch and Soil Council. Colored mulch can be applied anywhere non-colored mulch is used (such as large bedded areas or around plants) and features many of the same gardening benefits as traditional mulch, such as improving soil productivity and retaining moisture. As mulch decomposes, just as with non-colored mulch, more mulch may need to be added to continue providing benefits to the soil and plants. However, if mulch is faded, <b>spraying</b> <b>dye</b> to previously spread mulch in order to restore color is an option.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the amount of external spray residues that accumulate on farm sprayers and tractors. Six different sprayers were examined, Airtec, conventional sprayer (three types of nozzles, TeeJet XR, Lurmark DriftBeta and Hardi Injet), Danfoil, Hardi Twin, Kyndestoft and Släpduk. The study does not include accidental spillage from supply tanks or leakage from pipes etc. that may occur in everyday practise. A tracer dye, Nigrosin WLF, was added to the spray liquid. After spraying the sprayer and tractor were washed over a catchment pool containing a fixed volume of water. A small centrifugal pump was used to re—circulate the water. The concentrations of Nigrosin in the rinse water and in the spray liquid were determined by using a spectrophotometer. By comparing these concentrations, the amount of Nigrosin immobilised on the tractor and sprayer was determined. The sprayer was divided into two areas that were rinsed separately, the booms and the tank (every part of the sprayer except for the booms). The tractor was also divided into two areas, the front (radiator, bonnet and engine) and the back (the rest). All wheels were excluded. An average of between 0, 01 % - 0, 60 % of the <b>sprayed</b> tracer <b>dye</b> (active substance) was found on the tractor and sprayer after spraying had been carried out. The largest accumulation, 50 - 98 % of the accumulated deposition, was observed on the booms. The largest deposition was observed on the air-assisted sprayers, Kyndestoft (0, 60 % of the sprayed amount) and Hardi Twin (0, 46 %). Släpduk received the third largest deposition (0, 36 %). 0, 06 % of the <b>sprayed</b> tracer <b>dye</b> was observed on Danfoil and Airtec. The deposition on the conventional sprayer with TeeJet XR nozzles was 0, 04 % and on the same sprayer with Lurmark DriftBeta 0, 02 %. Hardi lnjet nozzles mounted on the conventional sprayer gave a deposition of 0, 01 %. Residues on contaminated sprayers can be released by rain and may cause local doses that significantly exceed approved amounts. To avoid contamination of surface and ground waters, it is wise to practise decontamination not on the farmyard where the topsoil often has been replaced by gravel, but on the field.

[...] From her work in Chicago, which featured architectural elements, to her work in the Pacific Northwest, with its imagery of land, sea and sky, her work is ethereal and technically adept. In reviewing a 2009 exhibition of Smith's work, Carla Seaquist wrote: [...] In essence a seeker, Barbara's artistic purpose is to retrieve those lost things - meaning, mattering, beauty, wit, a sense of the sacred... Barbara has been faithful to her inner landscapes. It's why her work resonates so deeply: she shows us profound things the modern world has forgotten but desperately needs. Since 1975, her work has been featured in over 25 solo exhibitions in the US, UK, New Zealand and Japan. She's participated in dozens of invitational group exhibitions including the Bellevue Art Museum Fiber Biennial, Korea Quilt Festival and the Beijing Art Salon. In a review of a 1989 group exhibition on Long Island, The New York Times called Smith's work [...] "off beat and personal."... her work cannot be pigeonholed into any category. The artist <b>sprays</b> uncolored <b>dyes</b> on cotton or silk fabrics. The dyes stain, flow together and mix, but the hues do not become visible until the fabric has been exposed to light. Off Beat and Personal. To add texture, Ms. Smith machine-stitches large areas. Again her approach is off beat and personal. By loosening the bobbin tension and tightening the needle tension the stitching results in a series of loops. Most seamstresses would moan and rip out the threads if this were to happen to their seams, but here the looped stitching is repeated back and forth across an area, until it resembles the glistening pile of a nylon rug. Occasional gold threads, flecked with metallic red and green, scintillate like sparklers. Framed and hung together as a unit of six rectangular modules, the flowing shapes take on an organized interrelationship.|$|R

METHODS: The image quality of normal white light endoscopy (WLE), {{that of the}} 10 available FICE filters and that of a gold standard (0. 2 % indigo carmine dye) were compared. RESULTS: FICE-filter 4 [red, green, and blue (RGB) wavelengths of 520, 500, and 405 nm, respectively] provided the best images for evaluating the vascular pattern compared to white light. The mucosal surface was best assessed using filter 4. However, the views obtained were not rated significantly better than those observed with white light.

The aim of this meta-analysis was to compare the diagnostic yield of dysplastic lesions in patients with IBD undergoing surveillance colonoscopy between chromoendoscopy (CE) and standard white light endoscopy (WLE). Methods: We searched electronic databases for full journal articles reporting on chromoendoscopy in patients with IBD. Pooled incremental yield (IY) of CE over WLE for dysplasia detection was determined. A fixed effects model was used unless there was significant heterogeneity.

40|$|The {{risk for}} {{developing}} dysplasia and colorectal cancer in patients with longstanding inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) involving the colon is well documented. Random biopsies during white-light, standard-definition colonoscopy (33 to 50 biopsies) with or without <b>dye</b> <b>spraying</b> chromoendoscopy has been the recommended strategy in North America to detect dysplastic lesions in IBD. However, there are several limitations to this approach including poor physician adherence, poor sensitivity, increased procedure time and considerable cost. The new generation of high-definition endoscopes with electronic filter technology {{provide an opportunity to}} visualize colonic mucosal and vascular patterns in minute detail, and to identify subtle flat, multifocal, polypoid and pseudopolypoid neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions. The application of these new technologies in IBD is slowly being adopted in clinical practice. In addition, the advent of confocal laser endomicroscopy provides an opportunity to explore real-time histology, thus redefining the understanding and characterization of the lesions in IBD. There is emerging evidence that serrated adenomas are also associated with longstanding IBD colitis and may be recognized as another important contributing factor to colorectal cancer development. The circumscribed neoplastic lesions can be treated using endoscopic therapeutic management such as mucosal resection or, especially, endoscopic submucosal dissection. This may replace panproctocolectomy in selected patients. The authors review the potential of these techniques to transform endoscopic diagnosis and therapeutic management of dysplasia in IBD...|$|R

Muitos sÃo os fatores que influenciam na eficiÃncia de uma aplicaÃÃo de defensivos, porem grande parte dos produtores dÃo mais importÃncia ao produto aplicado que a forma como ele Ã aplicado. Definir o volume adequado de calda a ser aplicado na copa de culturas arbÃreas Ã uma tarefa difÃcil, devido a variabilidade existente entre os cultivos. O conceito de TRV (Tree Row Volume) surgiu como uma forma de adequar a quantidade de calda a ser aplicada em funÃÃo do volume da copa da cultura. Objetivou-se com este trabalho avaliar a deposiÃÃo de calda e corante na folha do cajueiro e as perdas de corante e calda para o solo em aplicaÃÃes em oito taxas de aplicaÃÃo, sendo quatro dessas taxas aplicadas com um turboatomizador, trÃs com um equipamento costal motorizado e uma com equipamento costal manual.

Os testes de deposiÃÃo de calda e corante na copa do cajueiro foram conduzidos no delineamento experimental de faixas, onde os tratamentos principais foram oito taxas de aplicaÃÃo, sendo quatro destas aplicadas com o turboatomizador (100 %, 85 %, 70 % e 50 % da taxa de aplicaÃÃo de referencia), trÃs pelo pulverizador costal motorizado (nÃvel 6, entre o nÃvel 3 e 4 e o nÃvel 1 do controlador de vazÃo) e uma com o pulverizador costal manual, os tratamentos secundÃrios foram os seis pontos de coletas na copa do cajueiro. Os testes de perdas de corante e de calda para o solo foram conduzidos no delineamento de blocos, onde os tratamentos foram as oito taxas de aplicaÃÃo utilizados nos testes de deposiÃÃo na copa. A deposiÃÃo de calda na copa da cultura se deu de forma crescente a medida que se aumentou a taxa de aplicaÃÃo, apresentando uma maior concentraÃÃo na parte lateral da copa da cultura. Maiores valores de deposito de corante foram encontrados nos tratamentos com o pulverizador costal motorizado com regulador de vazÃo no nÃvel 6 e entre os nÃveis 3 e 4, nas aplicaÃÃes com o turboatomizador uma maior deposiÃÃo de corante foi encontrada nos tratamentos com 70 % e 55 % da taxa de aplicaÃÃo de referÃncia. As aplicaÃÃes com o turboatomizador apresentaram maior uniformidade de distribuiÃÃo de corante nos pontos de coleta em relaÃÃo aos equipamentos costal motorizado e costal manual. Maiores perdas de calda foram encontradas a medida que se aumentou a taxa de aplicaÃÃo, com exceÃÃo da aplicaÃÃo com o equipamento costal manual. Maiores perdas da corante foram encontradas nas aplicaÃÃes com o equipamento costal manual, seguido das aplicaÃÃes com o turboatomizador e com o pulverizador costal motorizado. As aplicaÃÃes com equipamento costal motorizado com regulador de vazÃo no nÃvel 6 e entre os nÃveis 3 e 4 se mostraram mais eficiente em depositar calda na cultura do cajueiro, para as aplicaÃÃes com o turboatomizador a taxa da aplicaÃÃo com 55 % da taxa da aplicaÃÃo de referÃncia se mostrou mais eficiente em depositar corante e com menores perdas. Pode-se concluir que a deposiÃÃo na folha e perda para o solo de calda Ã maior quanto maior a taxa, porÃm a deposiÃÃo de corante na folha Ã maior no equipamento costal motorizado e a maior perda de corante para o solo se dÃ na aplicaÃÃo com o equipamento costal manual. The cashew cultivation as an activity of economic {{importance for the}} Brazilian Northeast, has been going {{for a period of}} decline in productivity, largely because of the extractive scheme employed in its cultivation and the lack of minimal technical management of production factors, among them pest control. There are many factors that influence the effectiveness of a pesticide application, however much the producers give more importance to the applied product that the form how it is applied. Set the appropriate water volume to be applied in the canopy of tree crops is a difficult task due to the variability between crops. The concept of TRV has emerged as a way to adjust the amount of syrup to be applied depending on the volume of the canopy. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the deposition of dye and syrup in the cashew leaf and losses of dye and syrup for ground applications in eight application rates, with four of those rates applied air carrier sprayer with a three with a motorized knapsack equipment and a manual knapsack with equipment. The experiment was driving in an area of dwarf cashew localized in Pacajus - CE. The adjustment of application equipment used at work for the air carrier sprayer was made adjustments were made in the direction of air flow, application rate and the vertical distribution profile of the syrup to the knapsack and motorized knapsack equipment of the adjustment were made application rates. Tests of <b>spray</b> deposition and <b>dye</b> in cup cashew were conducted in experimental design tracks in a split plot design where the main treatments were eight application rates, four of which applied to the air carrier sprayer (100 %, 85 %, 70 % and 50 % of the application rate of reference), three by motorized knapsack sprayer (level 6, between level 3 and 4 and level 1 flow controller) and one with manual knapsack, secondary treatments were the six points collections in the cup cashew. Tests for loss of dye and syrup to soil were conducted in the experimental design of tracks, where treatments were eight application rates used in the tests deposition in the cup. The spray deposition on the cup occurred incrementally measure that increased the rate of application, with a higher concentration at the side of the cup. Higher values of deposit of dye were found in treatments with motorized knapsack sprayer with flow regulator at level 6 and between levels 3 and 4, the air carrier sprayer applications with greater deposition of dye was found in the treatments with 70 % and 55 % the rate of application of reference. The applications with the air carrier sprayer showed greater uniformity of dye at collection points in relation to motorized and manual equipment costal rib. Greater losses of the syrup as it increased the rate of application, with the exception of the application with knapsack equipment were found. Greater losses of dye were found in applications with manual knapsack equipment, followed by the air carrier sprayer applications and motorized knapsack sprayer. Applications with motorized knapsack equipment with flow regulator at level 6 and between levels 3 and 4 were more efficient in depositing the crop cashew dye, for applications with the air carrier sprayer application rate with 55 % of the rate of application of reference is more efficient in depositing dye and with smaller losses. It can be concluded that the deposition in the leaf and loss to the soil is greater the higher the rate, but the deposition of dye on the leaf is higher in motorized knapsack sprayer and more loss of dye to the ground occurs in the application equipment knapsack. t...|$|R
