Two major sources of {{information}} are used to determine where and when the horse was first domesticated and how the domesticated horse spread around the world.

5|$|Le Guide Culinaire deemphasized the use {{of heavy}} sauces and leaned toward lighter fumets, which are the essence of flavor taken from fish, meat and vegetables. This style of cooking looked to create garnishes and sauces whose {{function}} is {{to add to the}} flavor of the dish, rather than mask flavors like the heavy sauces and ornate garnishes of the past. Escoffier took inspiration for his work from personal recipes in addition to recipes from Carême, Dubois and ideas from Taillevent's Viander, which had a modern version published in 1897. A <b>second</b> <b>source</b> for recipes came from existing peasant dishes that were translated into the refined techniques of haute cuisine.|$|E
5|$|The <b>second</b> <b>source</b> of over-provisioning {{comes from}} the manufacturer, {{typically}} at 0%, 7% or 28%, based on {{the difference between the}} decimal gigabyte of the physical capacity and the decimal gigabyte of the available space to the user. As an example, a manufacturer might publish a specification for their SSD at 100, 120 or 128GB based on 128GB of possible capacity. This difference is 28%, 7% and 0% respectively and is the basis for the manufacturer claiming they have 28% of over-provisioning on their drive. This does not count the additional 7.37% of capacity available from the difference between the decimal and binary gigabyte.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{decision}} of a manufacturer (buyer), expecting new sourcing opportunities in the future, to select between a sole and a <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> mechanism for a non-commodity component. In a sole sourcing mechanism, the buyer commits to source from the current supplier. In a <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> mechanism, the buyer keeps the option open to source from a new supplier in the future. For a buyer that sources complex non-commodity inputs, this decision has {{to take into consideration}} supplier capacity investment, uncertain demand, supplier learning, and information asymmetry on the supply cost. Considering these factors, we compare sole and <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> mechanisms, and identify when a mechanism is preferred over the other. We find that (1) both a high and low capacity cost may benefit <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> (under the condition that the entrant’s cost is relatively low), (2) <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> is favored more when the buyer faces a higher level or more uncertainty of the future demand, and (3) <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> may result in over investment of the initial capacity. ...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{purpose of this}} research was to analyze the Technical Data Package as a <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> methodology to create production competition. Two <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> models and two major weapon system programs were presented for this analysis.

5|$|According to the Tantara ny Andriana eto Madagasikara {{transcription}} of Merina oral histories, {{the first}} house built by Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana was called Bevato. It was {{located at the}} southern extreme of the compound and housed the king and his wives. Andriambelomasina built and occupied a second house, called Manatsaralehibe ("large and great"). This house was highly venerated by Andrianampoinimerina: escaped convicts who managed to reach the building were pardoned, {{and this was the}} only historic house in the compound that Ranavalona I did not remove. According to a <b>second</b> <b>source,</b> the two oldest houses in the compound were called Mahitsielafanjaka ("one who is upright rules long") and Manatsarakely ("small and great"). These were reportedly built by either Andriamborona or Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana in the early 18th century and were occupied by Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana and his 12 wives. Another account states that Manatsarakely was inhabited by Andrianjafy and later by the wives of Andrianampoinimerina; this house and Mahitsielafanjaka were renovated under Ranavalona I using wood from the region of Sihanaka to repanel the walls.|$|E
5|$|At 11:10, V./LG 1 Bf 110s {{took off}} in advance of a raid by KG 54, {{possibly}} to tempt RAF fighters into battle before the main assault, so the RAF {{would be out of}} position. The bombers' mission was cancelled. The order did not reach V./LG 1 who continued to their target area. The 23 Bf 110s continued to the target of Portland. They ran into No. 601 Squadron RAF Hurricanes and lost six Bf 110s destroyed and three damaged. Only one Hurricane was shot down and another damaged. A <b>second</b> <b>source</b> states only four Bf 110s were destroyed, whilst a third gives the loss of five destroyed and five damaged. The Zerstörergeschwader optimistically claimed 30 RAF fighters destroyed (in reality RAF fighter losses in aerial combat amounted to 13 throughout the entire day), for a loss of 13 Bf 110s. The morning's effort had been a fiasco. The attacks showed a serious German technical failure in air-to-air communication.|$|E
5|$|Because xenon is a tracer for two parent isotopes, xenon isotope ratios in meteorites are a {{powerful}} tool for studying the formation of the Solar System. The iodine–xenon method of dating gives the time elapsed between nucleosynthesis and the condensation of a solid object from the solar nebula. In 1960, physicist John H. Reynolds discovered that certain meteorites contained an isotopic anomaly {{in the form of an}} overabundance of xenon-129. He inferred that this was a decay product of radioactive iodine-129. This isotope is produced slowly by cosmic ray spallation and nuclear fission, but is produced in quantity only in supernova explosions. Because the half-life of 129I is comparatively short on a cosmological time scale (16 million years), this demonstrated that only a short time had passed between the supernova and the time the meteorites had solidified and trapped the 129I. These two events (supernova and solidification of gas cloud) were inferred to have happened during the early history of the Solar System, because the 129I isotope was likely generated shortly before the Solar System was formed, seeding the solar gas cloud with isotopes from a <b>second</b> <b>source.</b> This supernova source may also have caused collapse of the solar gas cloud.|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{purpose of this}} study is to evaluate the Thompson- Rubenstein Leader/Follower <b>Second</b> <b>Sourcing</b> (t-R L/F) Model. The Model is applied to four acquisitions managed by the Joint Cruise Missile Project Office (JCMPO). The study reviews current DOD <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> acquisition policy and directives, and discusses alternate <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> techniques with emphasis on the Leader/Follower technique. The results of this research indicate that the T-R L/F Model does not adequately address: (1) the competitive nature of the Aerospace Industry, (2) the timing of the <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> planning in relation to the Major Weapon System Acquisition Process, (3) the acquisition of technical data rights, and (4) L/F implementation variables. The researcher proposes an alternate Model based on the experiences of the JCMPO acquisitions.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{decision}} of a manufacturer (the buyer), expecting new sourcing opportunities in the future, in selecting between sole- and second-sourcing strategies for a noncommodity component. In a sole-sourcing strategy, the buyer commits to sourcing from a single supplier (the incumbent) over the entire horizon. In a second-sourcing strategy, the buyer keeps the option open to source from a new supplier (the entrant) in the future. Supplier costs are private information, and the incumbent's cost may change in the future because of what it has learned. The buyer is relatively sure about current demand but uncertain about future demand. A supplier has to invest in capacity to produce the inputs for the buyer. With future private cost information, the incumbent earns rent in the future, and this prospective rent influences the incumbent's decision early in the horizon. On one hand, a second-sourcing strategy allows the buyer {{to take advantage of}} alternative sourcing opportunities, lowering her future cost. This benefit to the buyer {{is referred to as the}} option value of <b>second</b> <b>sourcing.</b> On the other hand, the future supplier competition in second-sourcing hurts the incumbent's future profit. The expectation of a lower future profit in <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> induces the incumbent to ask for a higher price at the beginning of the horizon. This causes more initial sourcing cost for the buyer in <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> than in sole sourcing, and is referred to as the cost of future supplier competition of <b>second</b> <b>sourcing.</b> The overall benefit of <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> relative to sole sourcing is influenced by the demand distribution and capacity cost. If the demand increases over time with positive probability, the incumbent's initial capacity may not be able to cover all future demand. If the capacity is cheap, the entrant may serve as an exclusive supplier, ousting the incumbent. In this case, the option value of <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> is high. If the capacity is expensive, the entrant may serve as a supplementary supplier by receiving only the demand in excess of the incumbent's installed capacity. In this case, the cost of future supplier competition is low and the option value is still significant. Thus <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> is better than sole sourcing not only when the capacity cost is low, but also when it is high (under the condition that demand increases over time with positive probability and the entrant's cost is relatively low). For intermediate capacity cost, the cost of future supplier competition dominates the option value; hence, sole sourcing is preferred. We also find that <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> is more attractive when the buyer expects the future demand to be higher or more volatile. Finally, more initial incumbent capacity strengthens the incumbent's competitiveness against the entrant, reducing the cost of future supplier competition. As a result, we find that <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> may lead to overinvestment of the initial capacity. sourcing, auction, supplier relationship, supply chain management...|$|R
