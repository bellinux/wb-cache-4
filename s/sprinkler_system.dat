5|$|Fay {{damaged the}} roof of the airport's {{terminal}} building, causing the <b>sprinkler</b> <b>system</b> to malfunction and inundate parts of the structure with water; the resultant flooding crippled computer systems crucial to processing passenger information. The airport's radar was also impacted by the storm. In response to the damage, the airport was closed to all flights, though it quickly reopened to emergency diversions and non-commercial flights. Including subsequent damage from Gonzalo, about $2 million was spent on airport repairs, and the storms were later cited as evidence of the need for a newer terminal in a more protected location.|$|E

50|$|In 2008, the {{installed}} {{costs of}} <b>sprinkler</b> <b>systems</b> ranged from US$0.31 - $3.66 per square foot, depending on type and location. Residential systems, {{installed at the}} time of initial home construction and utilizing municipal water supplies, average about US$0.35/square foot. Systems can be installed during construction or retrofitted. Some communities have laws requiring residential <b>sprinkler</b> <b>systems,</b> especially where large municipal hydrant water supplies ("fire flows") are not available. Nationwide in the United States, one and two-family homes generally do not require fire <b>sprinkler</b> <b>systems,</b> although the overwhelming loss of life due to fires occurs in these spaces. Residential <b>sprinkler</b> <b>systems</b> are inexpensive (about the same per square foot as carpeting or floor tiling), but require larger water supply piping than is normally installed in homes, so retrofitting is usually cost prohibitive.|$|R

5|$|In 2004, {{the venue}} was {{upgraded}} for €1 million by installing a K60 inrun between the normal and large hill. This allowed the medium inrun {{to use the}} same outrun as the normal hill. In 2008, a small K25 hill, named Ninoufbakken, was installed slightly away from the main hills. The venue's certificate was due to expire in 2011, after which the venue would have to meet the International Ski Federation's (FIS) latest regulations. A €1.5 million upgrade program was initiated, which saw the inruns renovated, including installation of the Ski-Line track system and new Porsgrund ceramic tracks. The outruns saw new plastic mats and a new <b>sprinkler</b> <b>system.</b> The Nordic House, a sports centre, was also built. Construction started on the normal hill in May 2011 and on the large hill in August 2011, with completion scheduled for early 2012.|$|E
5|$|The fire {{may have}} been caused by the {{accidental}} ignition of polyurethane foam insulation used on the building's outer walls. In China, the foam is commonly used as insulation material without the addition of flame retardants, and the foam produces toxic gases and carbon monoxide when burned. The Beijing Television Cultural Center was said to have used polyurethane insulation, which magnified the ferocity of a 2009 fire that consumed the center. In a 24 November press conference, local authorities said that the two apartments next to the destroyed building would be renovated as well, and that foam cladding on their exteriors would be switched out in favor of fire-resistant materials. Chinese citizens have also questioned the lack of an indoor fire <b>sprinkler</b> <b>system</b> in high rise buildings.|$|E

5|$|A few {{tropical}} cyclone warnings and watches were issued {{in anticipation of}} Fay's impact on Bermuda, and public schools were closed as a precaution. Despite its modest strength, Fay produced extensive damage on Bermuda.

Wade International Airport was flooded after the storm compromised its roof and <b>sprinkler</b> <b>system.</b> Along the coast, the storm unmoored and destroyed numerous boats. Immediately after the hurricane, 200Bermuda Regiment soldiers were called to clear debris and assist in initial damage repairs. Cleanup efforts overlapped with preparations for the approach of the stronger Hurricane Gonzalo, which struck the island less than six days later and compounded the damage. Fay and Gonzalo marked the first recorded instance of two Bermuda hurricane landfalls in one season.|$|E

25|$|A National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) {{investigation}} of the fire, using computer simulations with FDS and a mock-up of the stage area and dance floor, concluded that a fire <b>sprinkler</b> <b>system</b> would have contained the fire long enough to give everyone time to exit safely. However, because of the building's age (built in 1946) and size (4,484 square feet (404 m²)), many believed the Station to be exempt from <b>sprinkler</b> <b>system</b> requirements. In fact, the building had undergone an occupancy change when it was converted from a restaurant to a nightclub. This change dissolved its exemption from the law, a fact that West Warwick fire inspectors never noticed. On the night in question, the Station was legally required to have a <b>sprinkler</b> <b>system</b> but did not; outcry over the event has sparked calls for a national Fire Sprinkler Incentive Act but those efforts have so far stalled.|$|E

The building was equipped with a <b>sprinkler</b> <b>system,</b> but had many single-point vulnerabilities for failure: the <b>sprinkler</b> <b>system</b> required manual initiation of the electrical fire pumps, rather than being a fully automatic system; the floor-level controls had a single connection to the sprinkler water riser; and the <b>sprinkler</b> <b>system</b> required some power for the fire pump to deliver water.
