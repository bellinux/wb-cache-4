The {{prevalence of}} diabetes known to general practitioners (GPs) in different European countries has been investigated and the usefulness of <b>sentinel</b> <b>practice</b> networks in delivering prevalence data on diabetes has been evaluated. Patients presenting with diabetes in a 12 month period (1999 / 2000) to GPs in established European <b>sentinel</b> <b>practice</b> surveillance networks in eight european countries were registered. Estimates of prevalence were standardized to the 1998 European population. All-age prevalence reported in the network populations was lowest in Slovenia (male 16, female 16 per 1000) and highest in Belgium (male 31, female 34). The range of estimates obtained {{in this study was}} narrower than that published by the WHO in the Health For All database. The range was further reduced by age standardization. In males aged 45 years and over, age standardized prevalence ranged from 39 (Slovenia) to 76 (Belgium) and in females from 37 (Slovenia) to 75 (Belgium). There were no consistent gender differences in national prevalence rates. The study demonstrates the capacity of <b>sentinel</b> <b>practice</b> networks to deliver data on the prevalence of known diabetes in persons over 45 years.

40|$|In {{the winter}} of 2003 Western Australia {{experienced}} its largest epidemic of influenza {{for at least five}} years, with activity peaking in August and September. The season was short resulting in very high numbers of cases during the peak weeks. Activity in country areas followed the peak of Metropolitan activity. Influenza A virus was detected in 28. 3 per cent of the sentinel samples, and influenza B in less than one per cent. Both routine and sentinel detections and the overall estimates of influenza-like illnesses (ILI) seen by general practitioners at <b>sentinel</b> <b>practices</b> peaked in August and September 2003. The combination of influenza detections and an increase in ILI seemed to be the most accurate predictor of the beginning of winter influenza activity. There was a shift in age distribution for influenza A compared with 2003. Both the sentinel surveillance and routine samples demonstrated an increase of influenza in children and young adults. The majority of influenza A isolates were identified as A/Fujian/ 411 / 2002 like, a variant of the A/Moscow strain included in the vaccine. Despite this mismatch there did not seem to have been any noticeable increase in the risk of influenza infection in the vaccinated populations from the <b>sentinel</b> <b>practices,</b> nor was there a relative increase in disease among the highly vaccinated elderly population. A number of other respiratory viruses were identified as causes of influenza-like illness in the sentinel samples.

The meanQaverage duration of hypertension since the time of diagnosis increased significantly (< 0. 0001). Approximately half of the hypertensive patients presented target organ damage, in both periods with heart disease as the most common lesion. Dyslipidemia, hyperuricemia and diabetes were the most common co-morbid conditions. From 1998 to 2010, the proportion of patients on monotherapy decreased from 47. 6 % to 30. 3 %. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were the most frequently prescribed drugs for monotherapy in both periods. In 1998, the antihypertensive treatment most frequently prescribed was angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors as monotherapy (24. 3 %).

Data obtained by sentinel surveillance systems {{may be used to}} inform public health decision making, priority setting and subsequent action. 1 Seasonal influenza epidemics are a major public health concern globally, resulting in millions of respiratory illnesses and 250 000 – 500 000 deaths worldwide each year. 2 In Australia, several surveillance systems report on influenza epidemiology on a national and jurisdictional level. The Australian Sentinel Practices Research Network (ASPREN) is a clinically based general practitioner sentinel surveillance system that employs the nationally adopted case definition for influenza-like illness (ILI) of fever, cough and fatigue. 3 <b>Sentinel</b> <b>practice</b> surveillance systems aim to monitor influenza activity in the community by providing timely and geographic information about seasonal viruses. Other established Australian influenza surveillance systems currently consist of laboratory confirmed cases of influenza; three jurisdictional GP <b>sentinel</b> <b>practice</b> systems in Western Australia, Victoria and Northern Territory; and emergency department hospital admissions. Alternative methods of tracking influenza include telephone surveys 4, 5 and internet based systems. 6 – 9 FluTracking is an online self reporting system that records influenza-like symptoms and vaccination status. The National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) reports laboratory notifications of influenza. Both ASPREN and FluTracking track influenza-like symptoms, while NNDSS influenza notifications are a measure of true influenza in the population. It is accepted that a combined surveillance approach has the greatest value. 10 – 14 The objectives of this study were to compare the reported incidence of ILI recorded by ASPREN and FluTracking in two influenza seasons (2007 – 2008), and to compare timing and concordance of Background General practitioners {{play an important role in}} the detection and clinical management of influenza.

As part of that programme we considered how primary care might contribute relevant data. Methods: Using a questionnaire distributed to personal contacts and health authorities, we investigated the activities of <b>sentinel</b> <b>practice</b> networks and sought opinions on the place {{of primary care}} as a provider of information on health indicators. Studies on the prevalence of diabetes mellitus and on the incidence of chickenpox were undertaken within selected networks. Results: 33 networks were found who provided relevant information on a timely and continuing basis. Contributions varied; some were limited to monitoring influenza but others recorded morbidity data from every consultation. Recording methods ranged from the paper based to fully automated systems in which all morbidity was coded electronically at data entry. The study of diabetes mellitus showed less variation between national networks than currently suggested on the WHO database. For chickenpox we estimated the incidence of cases not presenting to general practitioners ranged between 3 and 27 %.

40|$|BACKGROUND: While {{the burden}} of community-acquired {{pneumonia}} and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) is still considerable, there is little insight in the factors contributing to disease. Previous research on the lagged relationship between respiratory viruses and pneumococcal disease incidence is inconclusive, and studies correcting for temporal autocorrelation are lacking. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the temporal relation between influenza-like illnesses (ILI) and IPD, correcting for temporal autocorrelation. METHODS: Weekly counts of ILI {{were obtained from the}} <b>Sentinel</b> <b>Practices</b> of NIVEL Primary Care Database. IPD data were collected from the Dutch laboratory-based surveillance system for bacterial meningitis from 2004 to 2014. We analysed the correlation between time series, pre-whitening the dependent time series with the best-fit seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model to the independent time series. We performed cross-correlations between ILI and IPD incidences, and the (pre-whitened) residuals, in the overall population and in the elderly. RESULTS: We found significant cross-correlations between ILI and IPD incidences peaking at lags - 3 overall and at 1 week in the 65 + population. However, after pre-whitening, no cross-correlations were apparent in either population group. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that ILI occurrence {{does not seem to be}} the major driver of IPD incidence in The Netherlands. (aut. ref. ...|$|R

Methods: Throat swabs from patients with an ILI presenting to physicians in <b>sentinel</b> <b>practices</b> were collected during the 2016 – 2017 influenza season. Results: A total of 52 samples tested positive by FilmArray Respiratory Panel. Forty percent were influenza A virus, and subtype H 3 N 2 virus was the major epidemic strain. However, nearly 60 % of ILI cases seen at sentinel sites were caused by non-influenza pathogens. The results of the FilmArray assay and cell culture were identical, and this assay was more sensitive than a rapid influenza diagnostic test. Genetic analyses revealed new influenza A H 3 N 2 variants belonging to a novel subclade 3 C. 2 a 2. Conclusions: The FilmArray assay facilitates urgent testing and laboratory surveillance for common viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens.

Adverse psychological consequences were subjectively observed by ASPN clinicians in 24 percent of women, exceeding any other category of complications. Management of all SABs in a hospital with D 2 ̆ 6 C, instead of the management observed in this study, could add 145, 000, 000 per year to health care expenditures in the United States...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the patients {{and practices of}} family physicians in a national practice-based research network to understand whether results from practice-based research networks {{are likely to be}} relevant to other practicing clinicians. STUDY DESIGN: Survey focused on family physicians that replicated the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS). SETTING: The Ambulatory <b>Sentinel</b> <b>Practice</b> Network Inc (ASPN), a practice-based research network, consisting of volunteer primary care practices that serve approximately 350, 000 patients. OUTCOME MEASURES: Comparison of visits reported in ASPN with the visits reported in the 1990 NAMCS in terms of patient demographics, reasons for visit, diagnostic and therapeutic services, diagnoses, disposition, and amount of time spent with patients. RESULTS: Overall, the two samples differed with respect to demographic characteristics of patients, while problems, diagnoses, services, disposition, and time spent with patients were similar. Specific pair-wise comparisons identified areas of difference. CONCLUSION: The ASPN and possibly other similar practice-based research networks are sufficiently representative of family practice to serve as useful laboratories in which family practice and primary care can be explored...|$|E
40|$|General {{practitioners}} play {{an important}} role in the detection and clinical management of influenza. The Australian <b>Sentinel</b> <b>Practice</b> Research Network (ASPREN) has been collecting data from sentinel GPs on selected conditions, including influenza-like illness (ILI), since 1991 to inform public health authorities of communicable disease activity in the community. Weekly incidence of ILI data reported by ASPREN GPs in 2007 – 2008 was compared with data from two separate surveillance systems: New South Wales data from FluTracking, an online self reporting ILI surveillance system; and national laboratory notifications of influenza reported to the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System between 2003 and 2008. ASPREN recorded peak ILI rates of 47 per 1000 consultations in week 30 (ending 29 July) 2007 and 34 per 1000 consultations in week 36 (ending 7 September) 2008. Similar trends in incidence were seen in FluTracking cough and fever rates, ASPREN data in New South Wales and National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System laboratory notifications. Data captured by the three separate surveillance systems provide complementary information regarding influenza in the Australian population...|$|E
40|$|The National Influenza Surveillance Scheme {{includes}} {{data from}} <b>sentinel</b> general <b>practice</b> consultations for influenza-like illness, laboratory reports of influenza and absenteeism rates {{from a national}} employer. The 1998 season was dominated {{by an increase in}} influenza A in all States and Territories and low influenza B activity. All influenza A isolates were characterised as influenza A (H 3 N 2). Peak activity in 1998 was recorded in July and August. Data are coordinated, analysed and disseminated at a national level and published in Communicable Diseases Intelligence during the influenza season. Commun Dis Intell 1999; 23 : 185 - 192...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{magnitude}} and severity of the 2012 influenza season in Victoria, Australia using surveillance data from five sources. Methods: Data from influenza notifications, <b>sentinel</b> general <b>practices,</b> a <b>sentinel</b> hospital network, a sentinel locum service and strain typing databases for 2012 were descriptively analysed. Results: Influenza and influenza-like illness activity was moderate compared to previous years, although a considerable increase in notified laboratory-confirmed influenza was observed. Type A influenza comprised between 83 % and 87 % of cases from the general practitioners, hospitals and notifiable surveillance data. Influenza A/H 3 was dominant in July and August, and most tested isolates were antigenically similar to the A/Perth/ 16 / 2009 virus used in the vaccine. There was a smaller peak of influenza type B in September. No tested viruses were resistant to any neuraminidase inhibitor antivirals. Higher proportions of type A/H 3, hospitalized cases and those with a comorbid condition indicated for influenza vaccination were aged 65 years or older. Influenza vaccination coverage among influenza-like illness patients was 24 % in <b>sentinel</b> general <b>practices</b> and 50 % in hospitals. Discussion: The 2012 influenza season in Victoria was average compared to previous years, with an increased dominance of A/H 3 accompanied by increases in older and hospitalized cases. Differences in magnitude and the epidemiological profile of cases detected by the different data sources demonstrate the importance of using a range of surveillance data to assess the relative severity of influenza seasons...|$|R
40|$|Influenza vaccine {{effectiveness}} (IVE) varies over different influenza {{seasons and}} virus (sub) types/lineages. To assess {{the association between}} IVE and circulating influenza virus (sub) types/lineages, we estimated the overall and (sub) type specific IVE in the Netherlands. We conducted a test-negative case control study among subjects with influenza-like illness or acute respiratory tract infection consulting the <b>Sentinel</b> <b>Practices</b> over 11 influenza seasons (2003 / 2004 through 2013 / 2014) in the Netherlands. The adjusted IVE was estimated using generalized linear mixed modelling and multiple logistic regression. In seven seasons vaccine strains did not match the circulating viruses. Overall adjusted IVE was 40 % (95 % CI 18 to 56 %) and 20 % (95 % CI - 5 to 38 %) when vaccine (partially) matched and mismatched the circulating viruses, respectively. When A(H 3 N 2) was the predominant virus, IVE was 38 % (95 % CI 14 to 55 %). IVE against infection with former seasonal A(H 1 N 1) virus was 83 % (95 % CI 52 to 94 %), and with B virus 67 % (95 % CI 55 to 76 %). In conclusion IVE estimates were particularly low when vaccine mismatched the circulating viruses and A(H 3 N 2) was the predominant influenza virus subtype. Tremendous effort is required to improve vaccine production procedure and to explore {{the factors that influence}} the IVE against A(H 3 N 2) virus. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
