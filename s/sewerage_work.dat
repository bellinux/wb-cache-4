50|$|In 1863 a brick drain, 18 {{inches in}} diameter, was laid from Edward Street to Eagle Street, but, prior to 1875, very little {{was done to}} provide Brisbane with a {{reliable}} water supply or an efficient drainage system. The Brisbane Drainage act of 1875 gave the Governor in Council {{the powers of the}} Municipal Council with respect to drainage and sewerage. The drainage and <b>sewerage</b> <b>work</b> was entrusted to the Department of Harbours and Rivers. William David Nisbet, Engineer for Harbours and Rivers, took charge of the design and construction of the city drainage. The primary concern was the creek downstream of the Albert Street and Adelaide Street intersection, which was then the only area developed.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Classification schemes are an {{important}} but still rather unexplored issue in the collective use of large document collections. We have investigated the classification of technical documentations in two engineering domains: a steel mill and a sewerage plant company. In both cases we found a coexistence of different classification schemes and problems resulting from distributed local archive. In supporting human actors to maintain different classifications schemes while working on a common archive, we developed the concept of context grabbing. It allows assigning context information efficiently {{in the form of}} metadata. Based on a document management system, a tool kit for context grabbing was developed. It was introduced into the <b>sewerage</b> <b>work</b> company to maintain different classification schemes on a shared archive...|$|E

50|$|It was in 1938 {{that the}} Warwick City Council {{proposed}} {{the construction of}} a <b>sewerage</b> treatment <b>works</b> in the northern section of the cemetery. The Council sought Lands permission to divide the cemetery into two land parcels, with the southern part for Cemetery purposes and the northern for its <b>Sewerage</b> Treatment <b>Works.</b> For various controversial reasons, it was not until late 1940 that legislation was passed that vested Warwick City Council as the new Trustees of the cemetery. The Council's <b>sewerage</b> <b>works</b> were completed during the 1940s.|$|R

50|$|A <b>sewerage</b> <b>works</b> for York, {{covering}} about 20 acres, {{was opened}} beside {{the river in}} Naburn in 1895 and has been extended several times. A narrow gauge railway operated at the sewage works and consisted of a short stretch of line and a siding.|$|R
50|$|Construction {{began on}} the sewers in 1892 and the first house {{connections}} were made from 1897.

50|$|At {{the opening}} of the East Gordon Street <b>Sewerage</b> <b>Works</b> on 25 January 1936 the {{chairman}} of the Mackay Harbour Board, Charles Frederick Bagley, paid tribute to the city council for its initiative in carrying out the scheme and to the consulting engineer AE Harding Frew who designed it.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s the Warwick City Council {{established}} a council depot for machinery and road making materials {{on part of}} the northern cemetery reserve, between the cemetery and the <b>sewerage</b> <b>works.</b> By 1974 the Cemetery Reserve was being used for three functions: that of Cemetery, <b>Works</b> Depot and <b>Sewerage</b> Treatment <b>Works.</b> Because {{it was necessary to}} gazette the three different uses of this reserve the Deed of Grant upon Trust for the Cemetery was surrendered in 1976 so that Lands could re-survey the land, dedicate roads and issue new Deeds of Grant.|$|R
50|$|At {{the opening}} of the works Bagley reiterated the view of the day that, with the {{completion}} of the <b>sewerage</b> <b>works</b> and the Outer Harbour Scheme, Mackay would become even more important, and the Government Medical Officer, Dr Ernest Wesley Chenoweth, emphasised the public health advantages of the new sewerage scheme.|$|R
50|$|The 1936 <b>Sewerage</b> <b>Works</b> {{is located}} on a level {{allotment}} in East Gordon Street, Mackay.

Evidence for a drawbridge was uncovered during <b>sewerage</b> <b>works</b> in 1979.|$|R
50|$|As one of {{the first}} <b>sewerage</b> <b>works</b> in {{regional}} Queensland, it is tangible evidence of the importance of Mackay as a regional centre in the 1930s and the influence the city enjoyed through their local Member of Parliament, William Forgan Smith, who was Premier at the time. During the 1920s and 1930s, Mackay was the fastest growing town in Queensland.|$|R

However, he found unsettled conditions and became acting engineer for the Sydney Railway Company.

40|$|The {{river mouth}} of Kitagawa Brook is {{normally}} stagnant {{because it is}} easily closed by sand and gravel transported by littoral currents of Biwa Lake, Japan. A new urban area exists in the basin and <b>sewerage</b> <b>works</b> were constructed in the early 1990 s, so contaminated water with a bad odour had flowed into the brook before the <b>sewerage</b> <b>works.</b> To reduce the smell, the river mouth was excavated to narrow the channel in the early 1980 s. Thus, river-bed sediment after this excavation only occurs at the river mouth. From the upper 24 cm of a sediment core, we found 19 strata of leaves which were supplied from deciduous trees in autumn. We also found several gravel layers which were supplied from the lake during severe storms. The combination of veins and gravel layers were reconstructed for about 20 years of sediment records with an error of two to three years...|$|R

50|$|Despite Finham {{being in}} the West Midlands county (and part of Coventry), Finham Sewage Works are {{actually}} south of Finham, in Warwickshire.

Adjacent to the <b>sewerage</b> <b>works</b> is Finham Golf Course, the River Sowe and Finham Brook.|$|R

5000|$|The beachfront area {{comprising}} the original townsite of Quinns, {{up until the}} 1990s, is colloquially known as [...] "Old Quinns". The area is characterized by rolling hills and roads, overhead power lines on wooden poles, few pavements and many unique houses with distinct architectural designs dating from the 1960s and 1970s. Most of this area still relies on septic tanks for waste management rather than a linked sewerage system, although infill <b>sewerage</b> <b>works</b> are scheduled in future.|$|R
50|$|In 1889 Alderman Marston became Mayor of Wolverhampton and was reelected in 1890. In {{these two}} years he {{arranged}} for sanitation to be improved and instigated water and <b>sewerage</b> <b>works</b> that are in use to this day. He also oversaw {{the building of a}} new power station to supply electricity for electric lighting and the approval of the Local Government Act of 1888 that made Wolverhampton a County Borough. Marston retired from business on 6 May 1916 and died in 1918 aged 82.|$|R
50|$|The East Gordon Street <b>Sewerage</b> <b>Works</b> in Mackay, {{opened in}} 1936, {{was one of}} the first in {{regional}} Queensland. As such, it is important in demonstrating the progressive upgrading of basic infrastructure in regional Queensland, in particular the provision of sewerage schemes, which took place in regional towns and cities from the interwar period. Most other regional centres did not develop such schemes until after World War II, with some local government areas not constructing sewerage infrastructure until after 1960.|$|R
25|$|The manor of Marbury {{was later}} {{owned by the}} de Praers family of Baddiley, passing to John le Strange, Lord of Whitchurch, before 1349. A timber church was in {{existence}} in 1299, {{on the site of}} the present parish church; Marbury church was considered a parochial chapel of Whitchurch until 1870. The remains of a medieval road were uncovered near Marbury Big Mere during <b>sewerage</b> <b>works.</b> They consist of a brushwood base covered by several layers of logs, with cobbles lying on top of the wood.|$|R
50|$|A {{road from}} Wentworth Falls runs {{north and south}} along the plateau to the current lookout area of McMahons Point. Before the {{construction}} of Warragamba Dam the track continued down the escarpment along a track {{all the way to}} the Cox's River area in the Burragorang Valley. There is a track descending from the western edge down into the Jamison Valley, originally leading to the old (now abandoned) <b>sewerage</b> <b>works</b> below the cliffs at Katoomba. The abandoned Queen Victoria Hospital is also located on Kings Tableland.|$|R
50|$|Central {{water supply}} exists only in Belitsa, Kraishte and Gorno Kraishte {{and in the}} ski resort Semkovo.

Electrical power supply is well {{organized}} and all the inhabited places have electricity. Phone lines are not available in the remote villages and there exist radio connected phones. Mobile connections are limited because of the terrain, but generally available in all villages. Internet via cable is accessible only in Belitsa.|$|R
