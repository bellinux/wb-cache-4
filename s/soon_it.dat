5|$|The Audubon Naturalist Society also {{actively}} opposed such spraying programs, and recruited Carson to {{help make}} public the government's exact spraying practices and the related research. Carson began the four-year project of what would become Silent Spring by gathering examples of environmental damage attributed to DDT. She also attempted to enlist others to join the cause: essayist E. B. White, {{and a number of}} journalists and scientists. By 1958, Carson had arranged a book deal, with plans to co-write with Newsweek science journalist Edwin Diamond. However, when The New Yorker commissioned a long and well-paid article on the topic from Carson, she began considering writing more than simply the introduction and conclusion as planned; <b>soon</b> <b>it</b> was a solo project. (Diamond would later write one of the harshest critiques of Silent Spring).|$|E
5|$|The Jacquard loom was {{immediately}} denounced by workers, who accused it of causing unemployment, but <b>soon</b> <b>it</b> had become {{vital to the}} industry. The loom was declared public property in 1806, and Jacquard was rewarded with a pension and a royalty on each machine. In 1834 there were a total of 2885 Jacquard looms in Lyon alone. The Canut revolt in 1831 foreshadowed many of the larger worker uprisings of the Industrial Revolution. The canuts occupied the city of Lyon, and would not relinquish it until a bloody repression by the army, led by Marshal Soult. A second revolt, similar to the first, took place in 1834.|$|E

5|$|The {{committee}} for the 4th National Women’s Congress met in 1976, started rehabilitating many of the female cadres sent to the countryside, and reinstated the ACWF. The ACWF was completely reestablished in 1978 and <b>soon</b> <b>it</b> announced its support for the Four Modernizations, Deng Xiaoping's plan to modernize agriculture, national defense, industry and technology in China. The newly reformed ACWF was able to strengthen its ability to set up local chapters, but, while other federations were able to resume work in the early 1970s, he ACWF did not resume work {{on a national level}} until 1978.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} {{members of the}} Sicilian aristocracy who still inhabit their ancestral palazzi are unable to make opening their houses to tourism {{a major source of}} income, unlike some Northern, especially English, counterparts. The local equivalent of the National Trust is very small, and there is much less local interest among the general population. The Princes, Marquesses, and Counts of Sicily still living in their houses dwell in splendid isolation, surrounded often by beauty and decay. It is only today both owners and the state are awakening to the possibility that if action is not taken <b>soon</b> <b>it</b> will be too late to save this particular part of the Sicilian heritage.|$|E
5|$|The route {{begins at}} US160 in central Del Norte. Here, it begins northward along Oak Street before {{crossing}} the Rio Grande, where the route exits {{the city and}} curves northeastward. The highway then straddles the Rio Grande– Saguache county line as it travels in a northeasterly direction. <b>Soon,</b> <b>it</b> intersects County Route 374, which traverses east {{all the way to}} US285. The route then suddenly curves eastward when it meets Twelve Mile Road. As the route continues to meet numerous county roads along its length, the land {{along the side of the}} road transitions from plain grassland to circular-shaped fields of crops. The route meets US285 approximately twelve miles east of Del Norte.|$|E

5|$|Before {{moving over}} the mountains, the 20th Division {{headquarters}} elected to destroy its cryptographic materials rather than carry them. As the wet weather made burning them page by page {{a slow and}} difficult process, and a fire might {{attract the attention of}} the Allied Air Forces, someone decided to simply bury them in a steel trunk in a stream bed. An Australian sapper checking the stream bed for booby traps with a metal detector discovered it, and it was dug up in the belief that it was a mine. An intelligence officer recognised the contents as code books and <b>soon</b> <b>it</b> {{was on its way to}} the Central Bureau in Brisbane. There, the pages were carefully dried out and photographed. On 4 February 1944, Central Bureau codebreakers decrypted a thirteen-part message that laid out the decisions reached at a conference of high-ranking Japanese officers. Copies of the material were quickly sent to Arlington Hall. In January 1944, Arlington Hall had decrypted 1,846 Japanese army messages. In March 1944, with the Sio code books in hand, it decrypted 36,000 messages.|$|E
5|$|Leopards and ladybirds are spotted; {{angelfish}} and zebras are striped. These patterns have {{an evolutionary}} explanation: they have functions which {{increase the chances}} that the offspring of the patterned animal will survive to reproduce. One function of animal patterns is camouflage; for instance, a leopard that is harder to see catches more prey. Another function is signalling — for instance, a ladybird {{is less likely to}} be attacked by predatory birds that hunt by sight, if it has bold warning colours, and is also distastefully bitter or poisonous, or mimics other distasteful insects. A young bird may see a warning patterned insect like a ladybird and try to eat it, but it will only do this once; very <b>soon</b> <b>it</b> will spit out the bitter insect; the other ladybirds in the area will remain undisturbed. The young leopards and ladybirds, inheriting genes that somehow create spottedness, survive. But while these evolutionary and functional arguments explain why these animals need their patterns, they do not explain how the patterns are formed.|$|E
5|$|Yakut Khan {{landed at}} Sewri on 14 February 1689, and razed the Mazagon Fort in June 1690. After a payment {{made by the}} British to Aurangzeb, the ruler of the Mughal Empire, Yakut {{evacuated}} Bombay on 8 June 1690. The arrival of many Indian and British merchants {{led to the development}} of Bombay's trade by the end of the seventeenth century. <b>Soon</b> <b>it</b> was trading in salt, rice, ivory, cloth, lead and sword blades with many Indian ports as well as with the Arabian cities of Mecca and Basra. By 1710, the construction of Bombay Castle was finished, which fortified the islands from sea attacks by European pirates and the Marathas. By 26 December 1715, Charles Boone assumed the Governorship of Bombay. He implemented Aungier's plans for the fortification of the island, and had walls built from Dongri in the north to Mendham's point in the south. He established the Marine force, and constructed the St. Thomas Cathedral in 1718, which was the first Anglican Church in Bombay. In 1728, a Mayor's court was established in Bombay and the first reclamation was started which was a temporary work in Mahalaxmi, on the creek separating Bombay from Worli. The shipbuilding industry started in Bombay in 1735 and soon the Naval Dockyard was established in the same year.|$|E
