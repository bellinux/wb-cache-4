Late one evening I {{broached}} the idea to my friend. It had been a great day for me; I had just banked my five thousand Catamountain dollars; and as Jim had refused to lay a finger on the <b>stock,</b> <b>risk</b> and profit were both wholly mine, and I was celebrating the event with stout and crackers. I began by telling him that if it caused him any pain or any anxiety about his affairs, he had but to say the word, and he should hear no more of my proposal. He was the truest and best friend I ever had, or was ever like to have; {{and it would be a}} strange thing if I refused him any favour he was sure he wanted. At the same time I wished him to be sure; for my life was wasting in my hands. I was like one from home: all my true interests summoned me away. I must remind him, besides, that he was now about to marry and assume new interests, and that our extreme familiarity might be even painful to his wife. [...] "O no, Loudon; I feel you are wrong there," [...] he interjected warmly; [...] "she does appreciate your nature." [...] "So much the better, then," [...] I continued; and went on to point out that our separation need not be for long; that, in the way affairs were going, he might join me in two years with a fortune--small, indeed, for the States, but in France almost conspicuous; that we might unite our resources, and have one house in Paris for the winter and a second near Fontainebleau for summer, where we could be as happy as the day was long, and bring up little Pinkertons as practical artistic workmen, far from the money-hunger of the West.

We examine both the statistical and financial properties of average <b>stock</b> <b>risk,</b> as measured for equal- and value-weighted portfolios using a daily sample of all TSE-listed Canadian firms between January 1975 and December 2001. In order to further test the robustness of the relationship, we examine two sub-samples, January 1980 to December 1989 and January 1990 to December 1999.
