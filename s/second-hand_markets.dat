40|$|I {{show that}} when oligopolistic firms {{manufacture}} semidurable goods, <b>second-hand</b> <b>markets</b> {{can play a}} key role in supporting collusive behavior. This in spite of the fact that a monopolist manufacturer has an incentive to eliminate <b>second-hand</b> <b>markets</b> – a point made by a number of authors. The idea that <b>second-hand</b> <b>markets</b> facilitate collusion is supported by the many examples in which manufacturers strengthen secondhands markets, e. g. by providing warranty coverage across owners, or by encouraging dealers to accept trade-ins. The intuition is that the prospect of obtaining a high price in a second-hand market increases the demand for new goods. This means that the expectation of a price war unleashed by the violation of a collusive agreement will decrease not only the future prices of the new and used goods but also the current price of the new good, thus making the defection itself less profitable. In this framework, I analyze the role of leasing policies, buyback policies and warranty coverage for used units...|$|E

40|$|In reality, many goods {{possess a}} feature that makes them quite dif-ferent from the typical {{economic}} textbook commodities like apples or wheat. The characteristic we have in mind is durability. That is the good provides a service to the consumer {{over a number of}} pe-riods. Hence as soon as the consumer gets enough of the service, wants to replace it for superior performance or needs liquidity to service more urgent needs, he will tiy to resell the durable. This gives rise to transactions in second-hand goods, or as we will call it a second-hand market. Now <b>second-hand</b> <b>markets</b> are best known in economics for their unexistence. In a seminal article, Akerlof (1970) introduced the "le-mons " problem, showing that adverse selection in the used car mar-ket could lead to the collapse of a second-hand market in cars. Yet many goods, also cars, trade in reality on <b>second-hand</b> <b>markets.</b> Some of them are even in good shape, Kreps (1990) refers to them as "peaches " while Bond (1982) calls them "creampuffs".

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I address the {{question}} of how value is created in <b>second-hand</b> <b>markets.</b> Focusing on the role of charity thrift stores I present an ethnographic account of fieldwork I undertook in the Tavern Guild Community Thrift Store in San Francisco. I analyse my ethnographic findings in light of contemporary literature on values and valuations in material culture and reaching back through the anthropological literature on commodities and gift economies I build a framework around David Graeber’s formulation of a concept of social, relational value. In order to structure the analysis I take Mary Douglas’s seminal work on classification as a starting point and argue that the practices of valuation constitute a process of transformation form discard to commodity. To support the analysis I introduce theoretical concepts from the ethnographic literature on values, secondhand markets and valuations. Practices of categorization enable the employees to create value, but disorder is a condition of the process, which hinders the flow as well as provides opportunity for value. I describe thrift, a considered use of resources, as the main ‘infravalue’ that drives the valuations and allows the organization to create economic, social and emotional value. Next I zoom in on the interaction between people and objects on a micro-level. The theoretical framework here brings anthropological theory into play with actor-network theory (ANT) approaches to nonhuman actors, and I introduce the term withdrawal from object-oriented philosophy to address the agency of objects in valuations. By dividing the analysis into two parts I demonstrate in greater detail how objects as part of valuations are given agency through social entanglements, but also how the objects by their mere existence influence valuations beyond this entanglement. Their presence as {{more than the sum of}} their social relations has a profound impact on the valuations by resisting as much as partaking in the process of transformation. In the last section of the thesis I present an explorative study of the extended trajectory the objects take through markets and wholesale companies in Thailand. I discuss the role of the thrift store in the global context of second-hand exchanges and offer a critical reflection on the consequences of the proliferation of <b>second-hand</b> <b>markets.</b> The thesis provides a situated approach to the study of human-objects interactions and demonstrates that an understanding of the different forms of value that are at play reveal charity thrift organizations as important players in <b>second-hand</b> <b>markets.</b> Thrift enables the organization to salvage as many objects as possible while providing services to the community. In doing so they are vital in transforming discards into commodities for the other actors in the market. This study highlights the importance of considering materiality, and especially objecthood, in the context of <b>second-hand</b> <b>markets,</b> and suggests a situated framework for understanding the relationship between objects and practices in the broader context of material culture studies...|$|E

40|$|International audienceOver {{the past}} decades {{fisheries}} {{policies have been}} mainly aimed at encouraging capacity reduction in over-exploited fisheries. Correspondingly, {{research has focused on}} developing incentives to exit fisheries rather than investigating entry behaviour. However, with ageing and also fewer fishery participants, concern regarding sectoral renewal is increasing. The <b>second-hand</b> <b>market</b> is an important entry point for first-time owners because it potentially reduces capital constraints by supplying cheaper vessels than newly built ones. The aim {{of this study is to}} test whether new fishers entering the industry face greater capital constraints than fishers already in the industry, taking the <b>second-hand</b> <b>market</b> as our population of interest. We model new entry into the fishing sector using 18 years of French Atlantic fleet data with a logit model. We incorporate trade network variables and family connections indicative of the relationship and connections between market traders potentially reducing capital constraints. As expected, we find that first entry is more likely by younger owners for older and cheaper vessels. This suggests that first-time owners are more capital constrained than fishers already trading on the <b>second-hand</b> <b>market.</b> Capital constraints are reduced by geographical proximity and increased integration into a trading network...|$|R
