After a Hafey fly out, O'Farrell hit a single to Ruth in left field, and Bell ran from <b>second</b> <b>base</b> to home to score the run and give the Cardinals a 2–1 advantage. In the top of the ninth inning, the Yankees tied up the game. Gehrig lined a double to left field, and Lazzeri bunted a single, {{advancing}} Gehrig to third base. Ben Paschal went in as a pinch-hitter for Joe Dugan and singled into center field, scoring Gehrig and advancing Lazzeri to <b>second</b> <b>base.</b> Severeid laid down a weak bunt, and Cardinals catcher O'Farrell threw to third base to make the force out on Lazzeri. With runners at first and <b>second</b> <b>base,</b> Pennock hit a groundball to shortstop Thevenow, who tossed it to <b>second</b> <b>base</b> to get the force out on Severeid. With Pennock at first base and Paschal at third base, Combs grounded to <b>second</b> <b>base,</b> ending the Yankees' hope of taking the lead.

5|$|The {{center field}} fence at Cleveland's Dunn Field was 460 feet from home plate {{until it was}} {{shortened}} to 420 feet in 1920. Even so, Speaker played so shallow in the outfield {{that he was able}} to execute six career unassisted double plays at <b>second</b> <b>base,</b> catching low line drives on the run and then beating baserunners to the bag. At least once he was credited as the pivot man in a routine double play. He was often shallow enough to catch pickoff throws at <b>second</b> <b>base.</b> At one point, Speaker's signature move was to come in behind <b>second</b> <b>base</b> on a bunt and make a tag play on a baserunner who had passed the bag.|$|E

5|$|Through {{the first}} three innings of the fifth game, both {{pitchers}} held the opposing team to no runs and {{a limited number of}} hits. In the bottom of the fourth inning, the Cardinals cracked through Pennock's tough pitching. Jim Bottomley began by hitting a one-out double past left fielder Babe Ruth. Les Bell followed with a single to right field, scoring Bottomley. Chick Hafey then hit a fly ball caught in foul territory by Ruth, and Bell was called out while attempting to steal <b>second</b> <b>base.</b> In the top of the sixth inning, Pennock hit a line drive double into left field past Hafey. Cardinals' catcher Bob O'Farrell threw to Tommy Thevenow in hopes of picking off Pennock, who was standing a considerable distance away from <b>second</b> <b>base.</b> Thevenow made an error with his tag on Pennock, and Pennock was safe at <b>second</b> <b>base.</b> Earle Combs, the Yankees leadoff hitter, followed by drawing a walk. With runners at first and <b>second</b> <b>base,</b> Koenig hit a single to left fielder Hafey. Pennock scored on the play, and Combs moved to <b>second</b> <b>base.</b> Ruth then struck out, and Bob Meusel followed by hitting a sacrifice fly to right fielder Billy Southworth, on which Combs promptly advanced to third base. Lou Gehrig drew a walk to load the bases for Tony Lazzeri, who ended the inning by hitting a fly ball to center fielder Wattie Holm.|$|E
