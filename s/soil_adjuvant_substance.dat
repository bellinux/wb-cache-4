30|$|Immobilization of {{biological}} material {{is a problem}} of prime importance for the biosensor creation. Successful immobilization directly influences key characteristics of biosensors (activity {{of biological}} material, linear working range, sensitivity to substrate, reproducibility and operational stability of signals, duration of storage, etc.). Therefore, selection of main parameters of the immobilization process is an essential challenge in the development of biosensors. In particular, an improvement of the methods of biomembrane immobilization onto the sensing element is an important task. One of the trends for solving this problem is an application of <b>adjuvant</b> <b>substances</b> (that are carriers of biomaterial, stabilizing agents, mediators, etc.) during immobilization process.|$|R

Ensuing knowledge of their weak immunizing capacity per se {{has led to an}} appreciation of the need for adjuvants to increase the immunogenicity of these low-molecular-weight synthetic structures.

Accordingly, this review will highlight a number of those <b>adjuvant</b> <b>substances</b> whose activity in animals indicates a potential use in human vaccines. In addition, the potential of several well-defined substances, termed immunomodulators, which nonspecifically stimulate resistance of animals to multiple 50 % lethal doses of microbial challenge is described. Among the most extensively characterized adjuvants of microbial origin discussed in detail are (i) the lipopolysaccharides isolated from gram-negative bacteria and their nontoxic analogs, (ii) the synthetic muramyl dipeptides and their multiple analogs, and (iii) the synthetic polyribonucleotide complexes, mimicking the interferon-inducing capacity of viruses.

First, we investigated the radical scavenging activity (ABTS), the oxygen radical absorption capacity (ORAC) and the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) of the investigated molecules. The cytotoxic effects of the compounds were tested on H 9 c 2 cell cultures by the MTT assay. Each compound showed a significant ORAC value compared to the reference. However, the compound 865 possess significantly higher FRAP and ABTS activity in comparison with the reference and other tested molecules, respectively. Based on these assays, the compound 865 was selected for further analysis. In these experiments, we investigated the oxidative metabolism of the compound in vitro. The molecule was oxidized by the Fenton reaction, artificial porphyrin and electrochemistry; then, the formed products were identified by mass spectrometry. Four possible metabolites were detected.

40|$|Background. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the use of liquid perfluorocarbon (PFC) as an <b>adjuvant</b> <b>substance</b> for lung preservation and assess its role in pulmonary protection after transplantation. Methods. Seventy-two rat lungs were flushed with low-potassium dextran (LPD) solution and randomized into three main groups: control with LPD alone and experimental with 3 (PFC 3) and 7 [*]mL/kg (PFC 7) of endobronchial PFC instilled just after harvest. Each group was divided into four subgroups according to preservation time (3, 6, 12, and 24 hours). Afterwards, we performed lung transplantation using rat lungs preserved for 12 hours with LPD alone or with 7 [*]mL/kg of endobronchial PFC. Results. There was a significant increase in oxidative stress in the control group at 6 [*]h of cold ischemic time compared with the PFC 3 and PFC 7 groups. The apoptotic activity and NF-κB expression were significantly higher in the control group compared with the PFC groups at 3, 12, and 24 [*]h of cold preservation.

Minimal intraperitoneal bacterial growth was seen after {{the introduction of a}} nonlethal inoculum of viable E. coli in 1 ml of saline, while administration of an identical inoculum in 30 ml of saline intraperitoneally (i. p.) led to increased 48 -hour mortality (p less than 0. 01), and associated rapid bacterial proliferation (p less than 0. 01). Clearance of nonviable radiolabelled E. coli from the peritoneal cavity was delayed, bacterial association with host peritoneal leukocytes was decreased, and blood uptake of radiolabelled bacteria was diminished in animals receiving 30 ml of saline i. p., compared to controls which received the identical inoculum in 1 ml of saline i. p. The clinical relevance of these studies is manifold: (1) they provide a possible explanation why patients with ascites due to cirrhosis or the nephrotic syndrome, or those patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis are more susceptible to primary and secondary bacterial peritonitis, possibly on the basis of impaired peritoneal clearance or diminished phagocytosis and, (2) although irrigation of the peritoneal cavity with crystalloid solution would seem prudent during laparotomy, these solutions must be removed prior to closure to prevent interference with normal peritoneal host defense mechanisms...|$|R

Current peptide vaccines are limited by immunologic compatibility issues, and engineered autologous cellular vaccines are difficult to produce on a large scale. Using standardized bystander cell lines modified to secrete immune stimulating <b>adjuvant</b> <b>substances</b> can greatly enhance the ability to produce immunogenic cellular vaccines using unmodified autologous cells or allogeneic medical grade tumor cell lines as targets. We investigated the efficacy of a cellular vaccine using B 78 H 1 bystander cell lines engineered to secrete granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor and CD 40 ligand (BCG) in a murine model of breast cancer. Methods: Five-week-old female BALB/c mice were injected orthotopically in the mammary fat pad with 4 T 1 tumor cells. Treatment consisted of irradiated 4 T 1 ± BCG cells given subcutaneously every 4 days and was repeated three times per mouse when tumors became palpable. Tumors were measured two to three times per week for 25 days. The vaccine&# 39;s activity was confirmed in a second experiment using Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells in C 57 BL/ 6 mice to exclude a model specific effect. Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) enzyme-linked immunospots (ELISPOTS) were performed on splenic lymphocytes incubated with 4 T 1 lysates along with immunohistochemistry for CD 3 on tumor sections. Results: Tumor growth was significantly inhibited in the 4 T 1 -BCG and LLC-BCG treatment groups when compared to 4 T 1 and LLC treatment groups. There were higher levels of IL- 2 and IFN-γ secreting T-cells on ELISPOT for BCG treated groups, and a trend for higher numbers of tumor infiltrating CD 3 + lymphocytes. Some tumors in the 4 T 1 -BCG demonstrated organized lymphoid structures within the tumor microenvironment as well. Conclusion: The use of BCG bystander cell lines demonstrates proof of concept for anti-tumor activity and immunogenicity in an immunocompetent murine model of breast cancer. This vaccine is being evaluated in lung cancer and should be explored further in clinical trials of breast cancer patients at high risk of recurrence or in combination with other immunomodulatory agents.

Mandatory reporting of pesticide illnesses has been part of this comprehensive program since 1971. The U. S.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{stimulating}} the body’s immune response {{is the basis}} underlying vaccination. Vaccines act by initiating the innate immune response and activating antigen presenting cells (APCs), thereby inducing a protective adaptive immune response to a pathogen antigen. <b>Adjuvants</b> are <b>substances</b> added to vaccines to enhance the immunogenicity of highly purified antigens that have insufficient immunostimulatory capabilities, and {{have been used in}} human vaccines for more than 90 years. While early adjuvants (aluminum, oil-in-water emulsions) were used empirically, rapidly increasing knowledge on how the immune system interacts with pathogens means that there is increased understanding of the role of adjuvants and how the formulation of modern vaccines can be better tailored towards the desired clinical benefit. Continuing safety evaluation of licensed vaccines containing adjuvants/adjuvant systems suggests that their individual benefit-risk profile remains favorable. Adjuvants contribute to the initiation of the innate immune response induced by antigens; exemplified by inflammatory responses at the injection site, with mostly localized and short-lived effects. Activated effectors (such as APCs) then move to draining lymph nodes where they direct the type, magnitude and quality of the adaptive immune response. Thus, the right match of antigens and adjuvants can potentiate downstream adaptive immune responses, enabling the development of new efficacious vaccines. Many infectious diseases of worldwide significance are not currently preventable by vaccination. Adjuvants are the most advanced new technology in the search for new vaccines against challenging pathogens and for vulnerable populations that respond poorly to traditional vaccines...|$|R

40|$|<b>Adjuvants</b> are <b>substances</b> {{that enhance}} immune {{responses}} and thus improve {{the efficacy of}} vaccination. Few adjuvants are available for use in humans, {{and the one that}} is most commonly used (alum) often induces suboptimal immunity for protection against many pathogens. There is thus an obvious need to develop new and improved adjuvants. We have therefore taken an approach to adjuvant discovery that uses in silico modeling and structure-based drug-design. As proof-of-principle we chose to target the interaction of the chemokines CCL 22 and CCL 17 with their receptor CCR 4. CCR 4 was posited as an adjuvant target based on its expression on CD 4 (+) CD 25 (+) regulatory T cells (Tregs), which negatively regulate immune responses induced by dendritic cells (DC), whereas CCL 17 and CCL 22 are chemotactic agents produced by DC, which are crucial in promoting contact between DC and CCR 4 (+) T cells. Molecules identified by virtual screening and molecular docking as CCR 4 antagonists were able to block CCL 22 - and CCL 17 -mediated recruitment of human Tregs and Th 2 cells. Furthermore, CCR 4 antagonists enhanced DC-mediated human CD 4 (+) T cell proliferation in an in vitro immune response model and amplified cellular and humoral immune responses in vivo in experimental models when injected in combination with either Modified Vaccinia Ankara expressing Ag 85 A from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MVA 85 A) or recombinant hepatitis B virus surface antigen (rHBsAg) vaccines.

In this syndrome different conditions characterized by common {{signs and symptoms}} and induced {{by the presence of}} an adjuvant are included. The <b>adjuvant</b> is a <b>substance</b> capable of boosting the immune response and of acting as a trigger in the development of autoimmune diseases. Post-vaccination autoimmune phenomena represent a major issue of ASIA. Indeed, despite vaccines represent a mainstay in the improvement of human health, several of these have been implicated as a potential trigger for autoimmune diseases. Sjogren's Syndrome (SjS) is a systemic chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease characterized by the presence of an inflammatory involvement of exocrine glands accompanied by systemic manifestations. Own to the straight association between infectious agents exposure (mainly viruses) and sicca syndrome development, the possible link between vaccine and SjS is not surprising. Indeed, a few cases of SjS following vaccine delivery have been reported. At the same extent, the induction of SjS following silicone exposure has been described too. Thus, the aim of this review was to focus on SjS and its possible development following vaccine or silicone exposure in order to define another possible facet of the ASIA syndrome.

This effect was not produced by pertussigen when the emulsion was made with saline and incomplete Freund adjuvant, but if an antigen was included in incomplete Freund adjuvant, the strong potentiating effect was again demonstrated. As little as 100 ng of pertussigen given intravenously was effective, but 400 ng proved better, and this latter dose was used routinely. The most striking action occurred when pertussigen was injected {{on the same day}} or 3 days after complete Freund adjuvant, but an effect was demonstrated when given from 3 days before to 6 days after complete Freund adjuvant. The action of pertussigen was not apparent until about 6 to 8 days after complete Freund adjuvant. The footpad swelling reached its maximum by day 14 and remained undiminished until day 29. Forty days later, a significant effect was still present. Histologically, the cellular infiltrate in the feet of mice injected with complete Freund adjuvant was more intense in animal treated with pertussigen.

40|$|In {{many cases}} {{conventional}} vaccines, based on live attenuated micro-organisms or killed whole cell preparations, {{are now being}} superseded by {{a new generation of}} subunit vaccines, which contain one or more highly purified recombinant protein antigens that offer a substantial improvement in safety, protection and manufacturing costs. Since purified proteins are often poor immunogens they need to be formulated with an <b>adjuvant,</b> a <b>substance</b> that non-specifically augments the immune response, to form the vaccine. Despite intensive research into novel adjuvants, still the most common clinical adjuvants are aluminium based hydrated gels. These aluminium gels readily adsorb protein antigens from aqueous solutions, forming insoluble protein-adjuvant micro-complexes. Yet despite their extensive use in vaccine formulations, very little is known of how these adjuvants affect the structure and stability of proteins. Thus there is urgent need for new biophysical analysis methods to characterise this final drug product. The work presented in this thesis aims to address this issue. Two model subunit vaccines were evaluated; namely recombinant capsular antigen fraction 1 (rCaf 1) and recombinant protective antigen (rPA) used in new recombinant subunit vaccines against plague and anthrax, respectively. The interaction of rPA and rCaf 1 with the Alhydrogel adjuvant was investigated by limited proteolysis, fluoresce nce, chemical modification, differential scanning and isothermal titration micro-calorimetry, electron microscopy and image processing techniques. The results reveal that protein structure is largely retained while cooperativity of folding is reduced. These small perturbations in protein structure can be modulated by addition of phosphate, in agreement with previous data from potency studies. The methods used here reveal new insights into how proteins interact with adjuvants and extend the capability for the characterisation of subunit vaccines. Furthermore, a combination of negative stain transmission electron microscopy and linear dichroism determined that the quaternary structure of Caf 1 is a long flexible polymer up to 1. 5 um long. It was found that donor strand exchange at the cohesive ends of shorter Caf 1 polymers produces circular molecules. Site directed mutagenesis was used to study the unusual circular dichroism spectrum of Caf 1. The contribution of aromatic residues in the far- and near ultra-violet spectra was assessed by circular dichroism and the protein fold was examined by Raman optical activity. This revealed unexpected contributions of aromatic residues to both the far- and near-ultraviolet circular dichroism spectra. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Immunostimulatory <b>adjuvants</b> are <b>substances</b> {{added to}} {{vaccines}} {{to promote and}} direct a robust Th 1, Th 2, or Th 17 immune response. Murine Th 17 cells are produced and differentiated from naïve T cells {{in the presence of}} transforming growth factor (TGF) -β and interleukin (IL) - 6 and once differentiated, Th 17 cells produce cytokines IL- 17 A, IL- 17 F, IL- 21 and IL- 22. We investigated how immunostimulatory molecules such as poly[di(sodium carboxylatoethylphenoxy) -phosphazene (PCEP), Alum, CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG ODN), Curdlan, Leptin and Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), alone or in combination influenced differentiation and/or activation of Th 17 type immune cells in mice. In vitro studies showed that murine splenocytes stimulated with CpG showed significantly induced production of IL- 12, a cytokine important for induction of Th 1 type immune cells and IL- 12 is known to be inhibitory for differentiation of Th 17 -type immune cells. Curdlan + Leptin +/- PCEP and PCEP + Curdlan induced significant expression of TGF-β. No immunostimulant combination induced both IL- 6 and TGF-β, which we anticipated would be required for Th 17 cell differentiation. When we investigated the cytokines induced by the immunostimulants 48 hours after injection in muscle tissue, we determined that Curdlan + Leptin significantly induced production of IL- 17, likely from activation of already differentiated T cells. TGF-β was significantly induced in response to Curdlan and Leptin, alone and in combination but they were poor inducers of IL- 6. PCEP+/- CpG or LPS significantly induced expression of IL- 6 but not TGF-β. Finally, we immunized mice via intramuscular (i. m.) route with OVA {{in the presence of the}} immunostimulatory adjuvants and assessed cytokine production from OVA-restimulated splenocytes 5 weeks later. ELISA results indicated that OVA-specific IL- 17 production was significantly induced in splenocytes from mice immunized with PCEP + OVA relative to the mice immunized with Curdlan + OVA, although it was insignificant with respect to the OVA immunization group presumably due to the highly variable responses. Using flow cytometric analysis, we observed that vaccination with PCEP + OVA and Curdlan + Leptin + OVA significantly induced the frequency of OVA-specific splenic CD 4 +IL- 17 + cells. Curdlan + Leptin also significantly induced the frequency of OVA-specific CD 4 +Foxp 3 + cells and CD 4 +IL- 17 +Foxp 3 + double positive cells. Thus, we conclude that in vitro studies are poorly predictive of the type of adaptive response that may be induced when immunostimulatory adjuvants were used in a vaccine. Furthermore, vaccines formulated with PCEP and Curdlan + Leptin adjuvants promote Th 17 cell differentiation and should be investigated as a combinational adjuvant for bacteria or fungal based immunizations...|$|R
40|$|The {{exposure}} to isocyanates {{is more of}} an occupational problem than a consumer problem. The main route of exposure is assumed to be through inhalation. Isocyanates that have high vapor pressure, such as TDI, can be airborne at room temperature. Other isocyanates such as MDI are volatile only when heated. Industrial processes that can cause {{exposure to}} isocyanates are, for example, spraying or heating. Inhalation of isocyanates can cause disorders of the respiratory tract. Isocyanates are well known to cause direct toxic and irritant effects, such as irritation of the nose, throat, and upper airways and also eye and skin irritation. In animal and human studies, it has been found that isocyanates cause skin sensitization and sensitization of the lung. The sensitization mechanism and metabolism of isocyanates is not fully understood. Concurrent reactions are often seen between different isocyanates and their different corresponding amines. It is not always evident whether the concurrent reactions are due to co-exposure or possible cross-reactivity. Patch test preparations of 4, 4 ′-MDI have been shown to contain only fractions of what is stated. Concentrations of 4, 4 ′-MDI in test preparations decrease rapidly. The aim of the first two papers included in this thesis was to study the dermal uptake and metabolism of isocyanates by dermal provocation of volunteers with different doses of 4, 4 ′-MDI. This was done by the tape-stripping technique and studies on plasma and urine over time. The aim of papers three, four, and five was to investigate the sensitizing capacities and cross-reactivity patterns of some common isocyanates and the corresponding amines in order to provide a better understanding of isocyanate contact allergy. In order to do so, the guinea pig maximization test (GPMT) was used. The aim of paper six was to investigate the cause behind the rapid decrease in 4, 4 ′-MDI in patch test preparations. The main findings were as follows. (i) The distribution after dermal uptake of diphenylmethane- 4, 4 ′-diisocyanate (4, 4 ′-MDI) appears to be a slower process than what is seen for airway uptake. Instead, our results indicated that the distribution of 4, 4 ′-MDI in the skin and the subsequent elimination is a slow process, and the proportion absorbed into the skin was approximately half of the amount applied. The main amount absorbed reacts with cell components or forms polyurea and is probably released as diphenylmethane- 4, 4 ′-diamine (4, 4 ′-MDA) by spontaneous or enzymatic hydrolysis over weeks or months, distributed systemically, and finally eliminated. A proportion of reacted 4, 4 ′-MDI is probably eliminated from the skin upon cellular renewal. Patch testing with freshly made preparations of 2 % 4, 4 ′-MDI might lead to active sensitization. Thus, a concentration of 0. 5 % in pet., which has been recommended by the European Society for Contact Dermatitis (ESCD) based on our results, should be used (Papers I and II). (ii) 4, 4 ′-MDI, 4, 4 ′-MDA, dicyclohexylmethane- 4, 4 ′-diisocyanate (4, 4 ′-DMDI), dicyclohexylmethane- 4, 4 ′-diamine (4, 4 ′-DMDA), and p-phenylene diamine (PPD) are strong sensitizers among our group of sensitizers. 4, 4 ′-MDI sensitized animals cross-react to 4, 4 ′-MDA and to 4, 4 ′-DMDI and animals sensitized to 4, 4 ′-MDA cross-reacted to 4, 4 ′-DMDA. PPD-sensitized animals showed cross-reactivity to 4, 4 ′-MDA and there was an indication of cross-reactivity to 4, 4 ′-DMDA. 4, 4 ′-MDI-sensitized animals did not show cross-reactivity to PPD, so PPD cannot be used as a marker of 4, 4 ′-MDI allergy. (iii) 4, 4 ′-MDI reacts with water, protein, or other components found in Freund’s complete adjuvant used in the GPMT. Aged, pure 4, 4 ′-MDI is instable, even when stored in the freezer. The outcome of 4, 4 ʹ-MDI sensitization in the GPMT might be affected by the instability of the pure substance and also its reaction with Freund’s complete <b>adjuvant.</b> Induction <b>substances</b> should be prepared in close connection with the intradermal injection (Papers III, IV, and V). (iv) Evaporation and reaction with water can be excluded as significant factors for the instability of the 4, 4 ′-MDI patch test preparations. Most data indicate that trimerization―and perhaps also dimerization―is the main factor influencing this instability. The 4, 4 ′-MDI trimer might be a weak allergen due to the higher molecular weight making it more difficult to penetrate through the skin. Since many patients have been patch tested with aged 4, 4 ′-MDI patch test preparations (where the patients do not react), we can conclude that if the trimer is present, it does not cross-react with 4, 4 ′-MDI (Paper VI) ...|$|R
