40|$|We {{introduce}} {{and study}} model sets in commutative spaces, i. e. homogeneous {{spaces of the}} form G/K where G is a (typically non-abelian) locally compact group and K is a compact subgroup such that (G, K) is a Gelfand pair. Examples include model sets in hyperbolic spaces, Riemannian symmetric spaces, regular trees and generalized Heisenberg groups. Continuing our work from BHP 1 we associate with every regular model set in G/K a Radon measure on K G/K called its spherical auto-correlation. We then define the <b>spherical</b> <b>diffraction</b> of the regular model set as the spherical Fourier transform of its spherical auto-correlation {{in the sense of}} Gelfand pairs. The main result of this article ensures that the <b>spherical</b> <b>diffraction</b> of a uniform regular model set in a commutative space is pure point. In fact, we provide an explicit formula for the <b>spherical</b> <b>diffraction</b> of such a model set in terms of the automorphic spectrum of the underlying lattice and the underlying window. To describe the coefficients appearing in this formula, we introduce a new type of integral transform for functions on the internal space of the model set. This integral transform {{can be seen as a}} shadow of the spherical Fourier transform of physical space in internal space and is hence referred to as the shadow transform of the model set. To illustrate our results we work out explicitly several examples, including the case of model sets in the Heisenberg group. Comment: Formerly part of arXiv: 1602. 08928.

40|$|A novel EUV {{spectrometer}} {{is presented}} for the ORFEUS-SPAS mission. It uses {{a set of}} four varied line-space <b>spherical</b> <b>diffraction</b> gratings to obtain high-resolution spectra of point sources at wavelengths between 390 and 1200 A. The spectra are recorded with two detector units, each containing curved-surface microchannel plates and a delay-line anode-readout system. An independent optical system detects {{the image of the}} source in the entrance aperture and tracks the source as it drifts during an observation, enabling a reconstruction of the spectra postflight. The overall system performance is discussed and illustrated by synthetic spectra...|$|E
40|$|Ankylography {{is a new}} 3 D imaging technique, which, {{under certain}} circumstances, enables {{reconstruction}} of a 3 D object from a single sample orientation. Here, we provide a matrix rank analysis to explain the principle of ankylography. We then present an ankylography experiment on a microscale phase object using an optical laser. Coherent diffraction patterns are acquired from the phase object using a planar CCD detector and are projected onto a spherical shell. The 3 D structure of the object is directly reconstructed from the <b>spherical</b> <b>diffraction</b> pattern. This work may potentially {{open the door to}} a new method for 3 D imaging of phase objects in the visible light region. Finally, the extension of ankylography to more complicated and larger objects is suggested. Comment: 22 pages 5 figure...|$|E

The proposed scheme, which incorporates a hyperbolic lens, is discussed, and the overall system is found to have a large acceptance angle and to be free of <b>spherical</b> aberration. <b>Diffraction</b> and polarization effects are neglected, as well as skew rays.

40|$|A {{major goal}} of {{improving}} the resolution in far-field light microscopy is to create observation volumes that are sharp and spherical. Two-photon excitation 4 Pi-confocal fluorescence microscopy provides a sharp and nearly <b>spherical</b> focal <b>diffraction</b> maximum, but the maximum is accompanied by axial side-lobes of 30 - 40 % relative height. Whereas in 4 Pi-confocal imaging {{the effect of the}} lobes on the image can be eliminated by data processing, in spectroscopy their presence contributes to the observation volume in full. Here we show that simple binary amplitude filters, placed in the entrance aperture of novel 1. 45 numerical aperture oil immersion lenses, suppress the side-lobes below 7 %. As a result, a nearly spherical sharp observation volume is created consisting of a solitary spot of similar to 150 nm full-width-half-maximu...|$|R
40|$|A 1 : 1 Offner mirror {{system for}} imaging {{off-axis}} objects is modified by replacing a concave spherical primary mirror that is concentric with a convex secondary mirror with two concave spherical mirrors M 1 and M 2 {{of the same}} or different radii positioned with their respective distances d 1 and d 2 from a concentric convex <b>spherical</b> <b>diffraction</b> grating having its grooves parallel to the entrance slit of the spectrometer which replaces the convex secondary mirror. By adjusting their distances d 1 and d 2 and their respective angles of reflection alpha and beta, defined as the respective angles between their incident and reflected rays, all aberrations are corrected without the need to increase the spectrometer size for a given entrance slit size to reduce astigmatism, thus allowing the imaging spectrometer volume to be less for a given application than would be possible with conventional imaging spectrometers and still give excellent spatial and spectral imaging of the slit image spectra over the focal plane...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} {{determine}} the structure of matter in three dimensions has profoundly advanced our understanding of nature. Traditionally, {{the most widely used}} schemes for 3 D structure determination of an object are implemented by acquiring multiple measurements over various sample orientations, {{as in the case of}} crystallography and tomography (1, 2), or by scanning a series of thin sections through the sample, as in confocal microscopy (3). Here we present a 3 D imaging modality, termed ankylography (derived from the Greek words ankylos meaning 'curved' and graphein meaning 'writing'), which enables complete 3 D structure determination from a single exposure using a monochromatic incident beam. We demonstrate that when the diffraction pattern of a finite object is sampled at a sufficiently fine scale on the Ewald sphere, the 3 D structure of the object is determined by the 2 D spherical pattern. We confirm the theoretical analysis by performing 3 D numerical reconstructions of a sodium silicate glass structure at 2 Angstrom resolution and a single poliovirus at 2 - 3 nm resolution from 2 D <b>spherical</b> <b>diffraction</b> patterns alone. Using diffraction data from a soft X-ray laser, we demonstrate that ankylography is experimentally feasible by obtaining a 3 D image of a test object from a single 2 D diffraction pattern. This approach of obtaining complete 3 D structure information from a single view is anticipated to find broad applications in the physical and life sciences. As X-ray free electron lasers (X-FEL) and other coherent X-ray sources are under rapid development worldwide, ankylography potentially opens a door to determining the 3 D structure of a biological specimen in a single pulse and allowing for time-resolved 3 D structure determination of disordered materials.

40|$|X-ray {{crystallography}} {{is currently}} the primary methodology {{used to determine the}} 3 D structure of materials and macromolecules. However, many nanostructures, disordered materials, biomaterials, hybrid materials and biological specimens are noncrystalline and, hence, their structures are not accessible by X-ray crystallography. Probing these structures therefore requires the employment of different approaches. A very promising technique currently under rapid development is X-ray diffraction microscopy (or lensless imaging), in which the coherent X-ray diffraction pattern of a noncrystalline specimen is measured and then directly phased to obtain a high-resolution image. Through the DOE support over the past three years, we have applied X-ray diffraction microscopy to quantitative imaging of GaN quantum dot particles, and revealed the internal GaN-Ga 2 O 3 core shell structure in three dimensions. By exploiting the abrupt change in the scattering cross-section near electronic resonances, we carried out the first experimental demonstration of resonant X-ray diffraction microscopy for element specific imaging. We performed nondestructive and quantitative imaging of buried Bi structures inside a Si crystal by directly phasing coherent X-ray diffraction patterns acquired below and above the Bi M 5 edge. We have also applied X-ray diffraction microscopy to nondestructive imaging of mineral crystals inside biological composite materials - intramuscular fish bone - at the nanometer scale resolution. We identified mineral crystals in collagen fibrils at different stages of mineralization and proposed a dynamic mechanism to account for the nucleation and growth of mineral crystals in the collagen matrix. In addition, we have also discovered a novel 3 D imaging modality, denoted ankylography, which allows for complete 3 D structure determination without the necessity of sample titling or scanning. We showed that when the diffraction pattern of a finite object is sampled at a sufficiently fine scale on the Ewald sphere, the 3 D structure of the object is determined by the 2 D spherical pattern. We confirmed the theoretical analysis by performing 3 D numerical reconstructions of a sodium silicate glass structure at 2 Ã resolution from a 2 D <b>spherical</b> <b>diffraction</b> pattern alone. As X-ray free electron lasers are under rapid development worldwide, ankylography may open up a new horizon to obtain the 3 D structure of a non-crystalline specimen from a single pulse and allow time-resolved 3 D structure determination of disordered materials...|$|E
40|$|The {{synchrotron}} Laue method with a beam {{limited by}} a pin hole {{was applied for}} studying the implanted layers in silicon and in AIIIBV multicompound epitaxial layers. A {{significant difference between the}} micro-Laue patterns in case of heavy and light ion implantation was observed. In the first case the pin-hole pattern contained spots coming from different layers mutually displaced due to lattice deformation. In the case of light ion implantation into silicon the lattice deformation effects were revealed in strongly overexposed patterns by activation of forbidden reflections due to lattice tetragonalization. It was found that all interference fringes connected with the <b>spherical</b> wave <b>diffraction</b> contributed to a long tail corresponding to the plane of diffraction.

Because of a quadratic phase factor which is common in the {{definition of}} the transform and some optical concepts, a comparison between these concepts such as Fresnel <b>diffraction,</b> <b>spherical</b> wave, thin lens and free space propagation and the transform has been done.

Due to the processing route without the use of toxic organic solvents, it is expected that these microparticles can be used as delivery vehicles for controlled release of food bioactives. Octenyl succinic anhydride (OSA) starch was used as raw material. Optical microscopy showed OSA starch-based microparticles (OSA-MPs) had a good dispersibility. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed OSA-MPs had a solid structure and <b>spherical</b> shape. X-ray <b>diffraction</b> (XRD) patterns revealed that OSA-MPs were of amorphous structure.

For the improved production of silver nanomaterials, some kinetic studies such as time incubation and pH were studied in this work. 10 [*]mL of algal extract was added into the 1 [*]mM AgNO 3 aqueous solution. The pH and reaction time range were changed and the absorbance was taken for the characterization of the nanoparticles at various time intervals, and the high pH level shows the increased absorbance due to the increased nanoparticles synthesis.

40|$|Nanostructuring of {{magnetic}} materials, {{on a scale}} comparable to {{the dimensions of the}} magnetic domain boundaries, is known to {{have a significant effect on}} the magnetic properties of a material. Here we demonstrate a simple and versatile technique for the preparation of two- or three-dimensional highly ordered macroporous cobalt, iron, nickel, and nickel iron alloy films containing close packed arrays of spherical holes of uniform size (an inverse opal structure). The films were prepared by electrochemical deposition from aqueous solution within the interstitial spaces of pre-assembled templates. The templates were assembled from colloidal polystyrene latex spheres (0. 20, 0. 50, 0. 75 or 1. 00 µm in diameter) assembled onto gold electrode surfaces from aqueous solution by slow evaporation. Following the electrochemical deposition of the metal or alloy films the polystyrene templates were removed by dissolution in toluene. Scanning electron microscopy of the resulting films show well-formed two- or three-dimensional porous structures consisting of interconnected close packed arrays of <b>spherical</b> voids. X-Ray <b>diffraction</b> analysis confirms that the nickel iron alloy in the walls of the structure is polycrystalline fcc in structure with a grain size which is significantly smaller than the thickness of the walls. The diameter of the spherical voids within the structures can be varied by changing the diameter of the polystyrene latex spheres used to form the template. Studies of the magnetic properties of the macroporous films show a large coercivity enhancement in comparison to the corresponding plain films and we find that the coercive field gradually increases as the diameter of the spherical voids decreases for films of a constant thickness...|$|R
40|$|Crystallographic {{information}} about layers of silicon carbide (SiC) deposited by {{chemical vapor deposition}} is essential to understanding layer performance, especially when the the layers are in nonplanar geometries (e. g., <b>spherical).</b> Electron backscatter <b>diffraction</b> (EBSD) was used to analyze spherical SiC layers using a different sampling approach that applied focused ion beam (FIB) milling to avoid the negative impacts of traditional sample polishing and address the need for very small samples of irradiated materials for analysis. The mechanical and chemical grinding and polishing of sample surfaces can introduce lattice strain and result in the unequal removal of SiC and the surrounding layers of different materials due to the hardness differences among these materials. The nature of layer interfaces is thought to {{play a key role}} in the performance of SiC; therefore, the analysis of representative samples at these interfacial areas is crucial. In the work reported herein, a FIB was employed in a novel manner to prepare a more representative sample for EBSD analysis from tristructural-isotropic layers that are free of effects introduced by mechanical and chemical preparation methods. In addition, the difficulty of handling neutron-irradiated microscopic samples (such as those analyzed in this work) has been simplified using pretilted mounting stages. The results showed that while the average grain sizes of samples may be similar, the grain boundary characteristics can differ significantly. Furthermore, low-angle grain boundaries comprised 25 % of all boundaries in the FIB-prepared sample compared to only 1 % to 2 % in the polished sample from the same particle. This study demonstrated that the characterization results from FIB-prepared samples provide more repeatable results due to the elimination of the effects of sample preparation...|$|R
40|$|Considerable {{attention}} has been given to the acoustic scattering from half planes. The aim of this thesis is to contribute something by studying some acoustic diffraction problems from the absorbing half plane. Although, the acoustic wave diffraction from an absorbing half plane with similar absorbing parameter has been studied in the literature, nevertheless no attempt has been made to consider the <b>spherical</b> wave <b>diffraction</b> from a bi-impedant half plane in still air. The absorption in the half plane is introduced through different absorbing parameters. The problem is formulated in terms of matrix Wiener-Hopf (W. H.) functional equation. Physically, it corresponds to a mathematical model for a noise barrier whose surface is treated with two different acoustically absorbent materials. The modified W. H. method is used to arrive at the solution. We further calculate the <b>diffraction</b> of a <b>spherical</b> acoustic wave from a porous barrier using a simple theory of porous materials [77] in still air. Our model assumes the barrier is made from a rigid material that is riddled with small pores that are approximately normal to the plane of the barrier. We take limited account of the compressibility of the gas in the pores. However, the gas in each pore behaves primarily as an incompressible cylinder, driven back and forth by the harmonic wavefield, but opposed by the frictional force generated at the pore walls (the flow resistance). The barrier is thin enough (with respect to wavelength) that sound is communicated {{from one side to the}} other by the motion of numerous incompressible cylinders. The approximate boundary conditions for such a situation are derived. A formal analytic solution to the complete problem is given, for the diffracted wavefield in the farfield region of the slit. The dependence on the barrier parameters of the power removed from the reflected wavefield by the diffraction at the slit is exhibited. In the case of noise radiated by aero engines and inside wind tunnels, it is necessary to discuss acoustic diffraction in the presence of a moving fluid. Therefore, the theory of acoustic diffraction is further extended to include the case of moving fluid and the following two problems are addressed in this direction. (1) "The <b>diffraction</b> of <b>spherical</b> wave by a half plane in a moving fluid". A finite region in the vicinity of the edge of a half plane has an impedance boundary conditions; the remaining part of the half plane is taken as rigid. It is found that the field is increased in case of moving fluid when compared with still air case. The field is also independent of the direction of the flow. This model has potential application in engine noise shielding by aircraft wings. (2) "The <b>diffraction</b> of a <b>spherical</b> Gaussian pulse by an absorbing half plane in a moving fluid for trailing edge (situation) â€�. The trailing edge adds the complications of a trailing vortex sheet to the absorbing half plane. The motivation of this problem comes from a desire to understand the transient nature of the wavefields-since these can be expressed as linear combination of Gaussian pulses. The time dependence of the field is tackled by the use of temporal Fourier transform. It is found that field ratio of no wake to wake situation is independent of the type of acoustic sources. Also near the edge of absorbing half plane, the field of a spherical pulse caused by the Kutta-Joukowski condition is in excess of that in its absence. Chapter 0 is devoted to the brief history of the problems of acoustic scattering. This chapter also contains the motivation for the work presented in this thesis. In chapter 1, we calculate the diffracted field by a slit in an infinite porous barrier. Chapter 2 deals with the problems of scattering by a bi-impedant half plane. Chapter 3 is devoted to the scattering of a spherical wave by a rigid screen with an absorbent edge in a moving fluid. In chapter 4, we present the scattering of a spherical Gaussian pulse near an absorbing half plane in a moving fluid...|$|R
