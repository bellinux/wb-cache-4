40|$|AbstractThe tail of {{the frog}} tadpole, {{comprising}} spinal cord, muscle, and notochord, regenerates following partial amputation. We show that, in Xenopus, this occurs throughout development, except for a “refractory period” between stages 45 and 47, when tails heal over without regeneration. Regeneration can be enabled during this refractory period by activation of either the BMP or Notch <b>signaling</b> pathways. Conversely, <b>regeneration</b> can be prevented during the later, regenerative, stages by inhibition of either pathway. BMP <b>signaling</b> will cause <b>regeneration</b> of all tissues, whereas Notch <b>signaling</b> activates <b>regeneration</b> of spinal cord and notochord, but not muscle. An activated form of Msx 1 can promote regeneration {{in the same way}} as BMP signaling. Epistasis experiments suggest that BMP signaling is upstream of Notch signaling but exerts an independent effect on muscle regeneration.

Understanding the mechanisms of endogenous regeneration provides greater insight into this remarkable biological process while also offering up potential therapeutic targets for promoting regeneration in humans. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway has been implicated in zebrafish regeneration, including the fin and nervous system. The body of work presented here expands upon the role of Wnt/β-catenin <b>signaling</b> in <b>regeneration,</b> characterizing roles for Wnt/β-catenin signaling in multiple tissues. We show that cholinergic signaling is required for blastema formation and Wnt/β-catenin signaling initiation in the caudal fin, and that overexpression of Wnt/β-catenin ligand is sufficient to rescue blastema formation in fins lacking cholinergic activity. Next, we characterized the glial response to Wnt/β-catenin signaling after spinal cord injury, demonstrating that Wnt/β-catenin signaling is necessary for recovery of motor function {{and the formation of}} bipolar glia after spinal cord injury. Lastly, we defined a role for Wnt/β-catenin <b>signaling</b> in heart <b>regeneration,</b> showing that cardiomyocyte proliferation is regulated by Wnt/β-catenin signaling. These data demonstrate a conserved role for Wnt/β-catenin <b>signaling</b> in promoting <b>regeneration</b> across multiple tissue types in the zebrafish, and further show conservation of some of these functions in human tissue...|$|R

40|$|SummaryMany neurons {{have limited}} {{capacity}} to regenerate their axons after injury. Neurons in the mammalian {{central nervous system}} do not regenerate, and even neurons in the peripheral nervous system often fail to regenerate to their former targets. This failure is likely {{due in part to}} pathways that actively restrict regeneration; however, only a few factors that limit regeneration are known. Here, using single-neuron analysis of regeneration in vivo, we show that Notch/lin- 12 <b>signaling</b> inhibits the <b>regeneration</b> of mature C.  elegans neurons. Notch <b>signaling</b> suppresses <b>regeneration</b> by acting autonomously in the injured cell to prevent growth cone formation. The metalloprotease and gamma-secretase cleavage events that lead to Notch activation during development are also required for its activity in regeneration. Furthermore, blocking Notch activation immediately after injury improves regeneration.

40|$|AbstractXenopus tadpoles {{can fully}} {{regenerate}} all major tissue types following tail amputation. TGF-β signaling plays essential roles in growth, repair, specification, and differentiation of tissues throughout development and adulthood. We examined the localization of {{key components of}} the TGF-β <b>signaling</b> pathway during <b>regeneration</b> and characterized the effects of loss of TGF-β signaling on multiple regenerative events. Phosphorylated Smad 2 (p-Smad 2) is initially restricted to the p 63 + basal layer of the regenerative epithelium shortly after amputation, and is later found in multiple tissue types in the regeneration bud. TGF-β ligands are also upregulated throughout regeneration. Treatment of amputated tails with SB- 431542, a specific and reversible inhibitor of TGF-β <b>signaling,</b> blocks tail <b>regeneration</b> at multiple points. Inhibition of TGF-β signaling immediately following tail amputation reversibly prevents formation of a wound epithelium over the future regeneration bud. Even brief inhibition immediately following amputation is sufficient, however, to irreversibly block the establishment of structures and cell types that characterize regenerating tissue and to prevent the proper activation of BMP and ERK signaling pathways. Inhibition of TGF-β <b>signaling</b> after <b>regeneration</b> has already commenced blocks cell proliferation in the regeneration bud. These data reveal several spatially and temporally distinct roles for TGF-β signaling during regeneration: (1) wound epithelium formation, (2) establishment of regeneration bud structures and signaling cascades, and (3) regulation of cell proliferation...|$|R

5000|$|Using optical amplifiers, the {{capacity}} of fibers to carry information was dramatically increased {{with the introduction of}} wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) in the early 1990s. AT&T’s Bell Labs developed a WDM process in which a prism split a beam of light into different wavelengths, which could travel through a fiber simultaneously. The peak wavelength of each beam is spaced far enough apart that the beams are distinguishable from each another, creating multiple channels within a single fiber. The earliest WDM systems had only two or four channels—AT&T, for example, deployed a 4-channel long-haul system in 1995. Erbium-doped amplifiers, however, do not amplify signals uniformly across their spectral gain region.

Han attempted to date twenty Acámbaro figures using TL dating. They found that the figures had been fired at temperatures between 450 °C and 650 °C, which contradicted claims that these figures had been fired at temperatures too low for them to be accurately dated. However, all of the samples failed the [...] "plateau test", which indicated that dates obtained for the Acámbaro figures using standard high-temperature TL dating techniques were unreliable and lacked any chronological significance.

50|$|Boyd {{has made}} {{significant}} contributions to the research field known colloquially as slow and fast light. Shortly after the development of great interest in this field in 2000, he realized {{that it is possible to}} produce slow and fast-light effects in room temperature solids. Until that time, most workers had made use of systems of free atoms such as atomic vapors and Bose-Einstein condensates to control the group velocity of light. The realization that slow light effects can be obtained in room temperature solids has allowed the development of many applications of these effects in the field of photonics. In particular, with his students he pioneered the use of coherent population oscillations as a mechanism for producing slow and fast light in room temperature solids. His work has led to an appreciation of the wide variety of exotic effects that can occur in the propagation of light through such structures, including the observation of “backwards” light propagation. Boyd has also been instrumental in developing other slow light methods such as stimulated Brillouin scattering. More recently, he has moved on to the investigation of applications of slow light for buffering and <b>signal</b> <b>regeneration.</b> He also came to the realization that slow light methods can be used to obtain enormous enhancements in the resolution of interferometric spectrometers, and he is currently working on the development of spectrometers based on this principle. As just one indication of the impact of Robert’s work on slow and fast light, it should be noted that his Science paper has been cited 523 times.|$|E
40|$|SummaryWhole-body {{regeneration}} {{is widespread}} in the Metazoa, yet {{little is known about}} how underlying molecular mechanisms compare across phyla. Acoels are an enigmatic phylum of invertebrate worms that can be highly informative about many questions in bilaterian evolution, including regeneration. We developed the three-banded panther worm, Hofstenia miamia, as a new acoelomorph model system for molecular studies of regeneration. Hofstenia were readily cultured, with accessible embryos, juveniles, and adults for experimentation. We developed molecular resources and tools for Hofstenia, including a transcriptome and robust systemic RNAi. We report the identification of molecular mechanisms that promote whole-body regeneration in Hofstenia. Wnt <b>signaling</b> controls <b>regeneration</b> of the anterior-posterior axis, and Bmp-Admp <b>signaling</b> controls <b>regeneration</b> of the dorsal-ventral axis. Perturbation of these pathways resulted in regeneration-abnormal phenotypes involving axial feature duplication, such as the regeneration of two heads following Wnt perturbation or the regeneration of ventral cells in place of dorsal ones following bmp or admp RNAi. Hofstenia regenerative mechanisms are strikingly similar to those guiding regeneration in planarians. However, phylogenetic analyses using the Hofstenia transcriptome support an early branching position for acoels among bilaterians, with the last common ancestor of acoels and planarians being the ancestor of the Bilateria. Therefore, these findings identify similar whole-body regeneration mechanisms in animals separated by more than 550 million years of evolution...|$|R
