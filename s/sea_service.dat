5|$|During {{the late}} 1990s, a {{combination}} of low recruitment and retention rates across the RAN resulted {{in the number of}} trained submariners falling below 40% of that required. As an attempt to retain submariners, the RAN offered a one-off A$35,000 bonus in 1999. Other measures introduced around the same time included priority transfer of volunteers for submarine training and rotating submariners between sea and shore assignments to relieve them from continual <b>sea</b> <b>service</b> and prevent burnout. A year later, these measures had increased submariner numbers to 55% of requirements.|$|E
5|$|Although {{his career}} was over, Rotheram {{continued}} to request <b>sea</b> <b>service</b> and honours from the Admiralty, becoming increasingly irate and intemperate in his demands. At the reorganising of the knightly orders in 1815, a number of senior naval officers were given knighthoods, but Rotheram was only made a Companion of the Order of the Bath, a step below knighthood. He retired to Bildeston in Suffolk and from there continued to request appointments, finally being made one of the captains of the Greenwich Naval Hospital in 1828. Rotheram died at Bildeston in 1830 and {{was buried in the}} churchyard of St Mary Magdelene just outside the village, where his grave and a memorial plaque are still legible today. Rotheram was never awarded any further honours or promoted to admiral, having lost his seniority in the court martial of 1808.|$|E
5|$|Failure usually meant {{six more}} months of <b>sea</b> <b>service</b> before the {{examination}} could again be attempted. Some men never passed it. Successful completion made the midshipman a 'passed midshipman'. From the 18th century {{until the second}} half of the 19th century, a midshipman in the Royal Navy who passed the lieutenant's examination did not automatically receive a commission. Midshipmen with political connections were promoted first, while others would wait their turn on a roster. During wartime, when large numbers of ships and men might be lost in battle, most passed midshipman would be promoted in a year or two, but during peacetime the wait might be so long that the midshipman would eventually be considered too old and lose his chance for a commission.|$|E

5|$|Following {{this period}} of {{extended}} service, Robinson was brought home, appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire by the King for his Caspian <b>Sea</b> <b>service,</b> promoted again to Captain and posted to HMS Iron Duke. Robinson then served {{in a number of}} training establishments and dockyards, as well as a brief stint with the Far East Fleet, during which he received the Japanese Order of the Sacred Treasure, Third Class for his services. In 1925, he was inducted into the Freemasons and remained a prominent member of the Navy Lodge {{for the rest of his}} life. The organisation still commemorates him in their publications. He retired at age 51 in 1933 as a rear-admiral, but when the Second World War broke out, Robinson immediately offered his services and for three years, commanded convoys across the Atlantic Ocean. For this service, he was later presented with the Norwegian King Haakon VII's Freedom Cross. Eventually a bout of ill-health caused by a combination of the strain of long service, his age, and the death of his son, Midshipman Edward Cordeaux Robinson, in the sinking of the cruiser HMS Neptune in December 1941, prompted a second retirement in 1942.|$|E
