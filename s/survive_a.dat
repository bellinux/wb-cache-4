5|$|Some {{terrestrial}} beetles that exploit shoreline and floodplain habitats have physiological adaptations for surviving floods. In {{the event}} of flooding, adult beetles may be mobile enough {{to move away from}} flooding, but larvae and pupa often cannot. Adults of Cicindela togata are unable to survive immersion in water, but larvae are able to <b>survive</b> <b>a</b> prolonged period, up to 6 days, of anoxia during floods. Anoxia tolerance in the larvae may have been sustained by switching to anaerobic metabolic pathways or by reducing metabolic rate. Anoxia tolerance in the adult Carabid beetle Pelophilia borealis was tested in laboratory conditions and it was found that they could <b>survive</b> <b>a</b> continuous period of up to 127 days in an atmosphere of 99.9% nitrogen at 0Â°C.|$|E
50|$|Karzai <b>survived</b> <b>a</b> {{number of}} {{assassination}} attempts by Taliban militants {{and at least}} two attacks against his office in Kandahar: one in November 2008 and the other in April 2009.

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 16th century, the House of Lords {{began to}} use the tower to store its {{parliamentary}} records, building a house alongside it {{for the use of the}} parliamentary clerk, and extensive improvements followed in 1621. The tower continued as the Lords' records office through the 18th century, and several sets of renovations and building work were carried out to improve its fire-proofing and comfort, creating the current appearance of the tower. In 1834, the tower was one of only four buildings to <b>survive</b> <b>a</b> terrible fire in Westminster, and in the aftermath the records were moved to a new, purpose-built archive.|$|E
5|$|Blackfish {{wanted to}} {{continue}} to Boonesborough and capture it, since it was now poorly defended, but Boone convinced him that {{the women and children}} were not hardy enough to <b>survive</b> <b>a</b> winter trek. Instead, Boone promised that Boonesborough would surrender willingly to the Shawnees the following spring. Boone did not have an opportunity to tell his men that he was bluffing to prevent an immediate attack on Boonesborough, however. Boone pursued this strategy so convincingly that many of his men concluded that he had switched his loyalty to the British.|$|E
5|$|Cynesige perhaps {{came from}} Rutland, as {{he owned the}} manor of Tinwell there later in life. The Liber Eliensis claimed {{that he had been}} born by Caesarian section, but this is most likely a later {{accretion}} to his lifestory, added after his death because of efforts to have him declared a saint. The belief was that for an infant to <b>survive</b> <b>a</b> caesarian section was a miracle, and thus a fitting beginning for a future saint.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the harsh}} {{conditions}} on the surface, little of the planet has been explored; {{in addition to the}} fact that life as currently understood may not necessarily be the same {{in other parts of the}} universe, the extent of the tenacity of life on Earth itself has not yet been shown. Creatures known as extremophiles exist on Earth, preferring extreme habitats. Thermophiles and hyperthermophiles thrive at temperatures reaching above the boiling point of water, acidophiles thrive at a pH level of 3 or below, polyextremophiles can <b>survive</b> <b>a</b> varied number of extreme conditions, and many other types of extremophiles exist on Earth.|$|E
5|$|He first learns of his body's {{superior}} {{resistance to}} physical injury during the war. Bullets and bayonets glance off his tough skin. He {{believes he can}} even <b>survive</b> <b>a</b> plane crash. The only weaponry capable of penetrating his skin at the time are the largest artillery shells. Although, he still feels {{the effects of the}} elements, sweating under the heat of the sun and freezing during winter. Danner's only vulnerability is lightning, which ultimately kills him.|$|E

She campaigned with her husband door to door during his successful first bid for U.S. Congress in 1982, and was heavily involved in campaign strategy.

5|$|It {{appeared}} {{as though the}} government might seize Lincoln for being insolvent. The investigation was, however, taking a long time. Keating was asking that Lincoln be given a lenient judgment by the FHLBB, {{so that it could}} limit its high risk investments and get into the safe (at the time) home mortgage business, thus allowing the business to <b>survive.</b> <b>A</b> letter from audit firm Arthur Young & Co. bolstered Keating's case that the government investigation was taking a long time. Keating now wanted the five senators to intervene with the FHLBB on his behalf.|$|E
5|$|Modern historians, doubting that a Persian {{commander}} {{would have}} sabotaged his own invasion, have suggested several other possible scenarios. It is, however, {{impossible to know}} exactly how the Naxians {{became aware of the}} invasion, but undoubtedly they were aware, and began to make preparations. Herodotus tells us that the Naxians had previously had no inkling of the expedition, but that when news arrived they brought everything in from the fields, gathered enough food with which to <b>survive</b> <b>a</b> siege and reinforced their walls.|$|E
5|$|Severus Snape, {{a member}} of the Order of the Phoenix, meets with Narcissa Malfoy, Draco's mother, and Lord Voldemort's {{faithful}} supporter Bellatrix Lestrange. Narcissa expresses concern that her son might not <b>survive</b> <b>a</b> dangerous mission given to him by Lord Voldemort. Bellatrix feels Snape will be of no help until he surprises her by making an Unbreakable Vow with Narcissa, swearing on his life that he will protect and assist Draco in his mission.|$|E

5|$|The {{delay in}} the CSM caused by the fire enabled NASA {{to catch up on}} man-rating the LM and Saturn V. Apollo 4 (AS-501) was the first {{unmanned}} flight of the Saturn V, carrying a Block I CSM on November 9, 1967. The capability of the Command Module's heat shield to <b>survive</b> <b>a</b> trans-lunar reentry was demonstrated by using the Service Module engine to ram it into the atmosphere at higher than the usual Earth-orbital reentry speed.|$|E
5|$|Travelling to {{the airport}} for her flight home, Diane and Ric come across a woman in labour, Joanna (Akofa Edjeani Asiedu), who is also {{suffering}} from malaria and having trouble breathing. It is unlikely she will <b>survive</b> <b>a</b> natural childbirth, and the nearest hospital is two hours away. They travel back to Kumi's clinic, collecting an inebriated Abra along the way. After Abra threatens to force entry, Kumi unchains the doors and they manage to deliver the baby and save Joanna.|$|E
5|$|Although Roosevelt, {{most of his}} aides, Johnson, and the NRA staff {{felt the}} Act would <b>survive</b> <b>a</b> court test, the U.S. Department of Justice had on March 25, 1935, {{declined}} to appeal an appellate court ruling overturning the lumber industry code {{on the grounds that}} the case was not a good test of the NIRA's constitutionality. The Justice Department's action worried many in the administration. But on April 1, 1935 the Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the constitutionality of the NIRA in the Schechter case. Although Donald Richberg and others felt the government's case in Schechter was not a strong one, the Schechters were determined to appeal their conviction. So the government appealed first, and the Supreme Court heard oral argument on May 2 and 3.|$|E

5|$|Charlton married Pat Kemp on 6 January 1958, and {{his brother}} Bobby acted as his best man. They have three children: John (born in January 1959), Deborah (born 1961) and Peter, who was born just after Charlton senior played in the 1966 World Cup final. During the 1960s he ran two clothes shops in Leeds, and he also later {{operated}} the souvenir shop at Elland Road. Charlton is a keen amateur fisherman and also takes part in field sports. He appeared on Desert Island Discs in 1972 and 1996, and chose to take with him The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain, the Encyclopaedia of How to <b>Survive,</b> <b>a</b> spyglass, and a fishing rod. Charlton {{was the subject of}} This Is Your Life in 1973 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews.|$|E
5|$|From there, the Flames {{went on to}} the Campbell Conference Finals, {{where they}} {{defeated}} the St. Louis Blues in another seven-game series. This time, Calgary had to <b>survive</b> <b>a</b> scare of its own, shaking off the Monday Night Miracle at the St. Louis Arena. Trailing by a score of 5â2 with 10 minutes to play in the third period of Game 6, the Blues mounted a furious comeback to send the contest into overtime, where Doug Wickenheiser scored to force a deciding seventh game. Calgary would win Game 7 at home, 2â1, advancing into the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time. The Flames proved to be no match for the Montreal Canadiens, losing the championship series in five games. Montreal rookie goaltender Patrick Roy was nearly unbeatable in the last two games, allowing only four goals en route to winning the Conn Smythe Trophy.|$|E
5|$|In 1637 WiÅniowiecki {{might have}} fought under Hetman MikoÅaj Potocki against the Cossack {{rebellion}} of Pavel Pavluk (the Pawluk Uprising); Jan Widacki notes that historians are not certain whether {{he did and}} in either case, no detailed accounts of his possible participation <b>survive.</b> <b>A</b> year later, returning from the Sejm and from the engagement ceremony with Gryzelda, he gathered a 4,000 strong division that participated in putting down of the Ostrzanin Uprising and arrived at the region affected by the unrest in June that year. Together with Hetman Potocki he defeated the insurgents at the Battle of Å»ownin, which turned into a rather difficult siege of the Cossack camp that lasted from 13 June till the Cossack relief forces were defeated on 4 August, and the Cossacks capitulated on 7 August.|$|E
