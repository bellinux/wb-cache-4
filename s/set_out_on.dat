5|$|In 1523, Hernán Cortés {{organised}} two expeditions towards Central America from Mexico, one by {{land and}} the other by sea. He commissioned the first to Pedro de Alvarado and the second to Cristóbal de Olid. Alvarado initiated the conquest of Guatemala, and then <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> an expedition into Honduras. Olid began the conquest of Honduras' interior, arriving in 1524, but soon set himself up independently of Cortés.|$|E
5|$|Many Texas {{residents}} {{disagreed with}} the convention's perception. As the message spread across Texas, settlers left their homes and assembled in Gonzales, where Colonel James Fannin was due to arrive with the remaining Texian Army troops. On February 27 one group of reinforcements impatiently <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> their own; as a result 32 additional Texians entered the Alamo. Research by historian Thomas Ricks Lindley indicates that an additional 50 or 60 men reinforced the Alamo on March 4.|$|E

5|$|Much of Shen Kuo's written {{work was}} {{probably}} purged {{under the leadership}} of minister Cai Jing (1046–1126), who revived the New Policies of Wang Anshi, although he <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> a campaign of attrition to destroy or radically alter the written work of his predecessors and especially Conservative enemies. For example, only six of Shen's books remain, and four of these have been significantly altered since the time they were penned by the author.|$|E

5|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} in August 1973 following the tour supporting the previous album, Foxtrot (1972). The group set aside {{a short period of}} time to write new material, which covered a number of themes, including the loss of English folk culture and an increased American influence, which was reflected in the title. Following the album's release, the group <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> tour, where they drew an enthusiastic reception from fans.|$|E
5|$|The {{group was}} formed in 1967 by Emerson, Lee Jackson, David O'List and Ian Hague to back soul singer P. P. Arnold. After {{replacing}} Hague with Brian Davison, the group <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> their own, quickly developing a strong live following. The group's sound was centred on Emerson's Hammond organ showmanship and abuse of the instrument, and their radical rearrangements of classical music themes and Bob Dylan songs.|$|E
5|$|While Alexander campaigned north, the Thebans and Athenians rebelled once again. Alexander {{immediately}} headed south. While {{the other}} cities again hesitated, Thebes decided to fight. The Theban resistance was ineffective, and Alexander razed {{the city and}} divided its territory between the other Boeotian cities. The end of Thebes cowed Athens, leaving all of Greece temporarily at peace. Alexander then <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> his Asian campaign, leaving Antipater as regent.|$|E

Originally Heisley had until 1March {{to apply to the}} NBA for a relocation, but the deadline was later extended to 26March. A similar deadline was also awarded to the Charlotte Hornets, who were also considering a relocation.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} {{approximately}} 1,000 Muslim men <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> late Friday from Medina {{and managed to}} circle around the Meccan forces. Early the next morning, they took {{a position on the}} lower slopes of the hill of Uhud. Shortly before the battle commenced, 'Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy (the chief of the Khazraj tribe) and his followers withdrew their support for Muhammad and returned to Medina, with reports suggesting Ibn Ubayy's discontent with the plan to march out from Medina to meet the Meccans. Ibn Ubayy and his followers would later receive censure in the Qur'an for this act.|$|E
5|$|Admiral Scheer {{underwent}} a refit while her sister ships <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> commerce raiding {{operations in the}} Atlantic. Admiral Scheer was modified during {{the early months of}} 1940, including the installation of a new, raked clipper bow. The heavy command tower was replaced with a lighter structure, and she was reclassified as a heavy cruiser. Additional anti-aircraft guns were also installed, along with updated radar equipment. On 19–20 July RAF bombers attacked Admiral Scheer and the battleship , though they failed to score any hits. On 27 July, the ship was pronounced ready for service.|$|E

5|$|After making {{way to the}} {{submarine}} base at Brioni, U-41 <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> another patrol into the Mediterranean on 29 August, but put into Sebenico the next day for engine repairs. Resuming her patrol after a day's delay, U-41 reached her patrol area east of Malta. Wolf and U-41 scored their first success on 13 September, when they torpedoed and sank the steamer Amiral Charner west of Pantellaria. The 4,604-ton French ship was carrying horses and a general cargo from Marseilles for Salonika when she was attacked. Six {{were killed in the}} attack on the French ship. On 26 September, U-41 attacked another steamer west of Kefalonia, but was apparently unsuccessful. U-41 ended her patrol at Cattaro on 28 September.|$|E
5|$|Alexios {{was able}} to recover a number of {{important}} cities and islands, and in fact much of western Asia Minor. Nevertheless, the Catholic/Latin crusaders believed their oaths were invalidated when Alexios did not help them during the siege of Antioch (he had in fact <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> the road to Antioch but had been persuaded to turn back by Stephen of Blois, who assured him that all was lost and that the expedition had already failed). Bohemund, who had set himself up as Prince of Antioch, briefly went to war with the Byzantines, but he agreed to become Alexios' vassal under the Treaty of Devol in 1108, which marked the end of the Norman threat during Alexios' reign.|$|E
5|$|Although {{instrumental}} in drafting the Treaty of Vereeniging, Reitz personally {{did not want}} to swear allegiance to the British government, and he chose to go into exile. On 4 July 1902 he left South Africa and joined his wife and children in the Netherlands. To alleviate his financial troubles, Reitz <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> a lecture tour in the United States. Due to a waning interest in the Boer cause now that the war was over, the tour failed, forcing Reitz to return to the Netherlands. Here his health failed him again, leading to hospitalisation and an extensive period of convalescing. During this time he was supported by his friends W.J. Leyds and H.P.N. Muller and the Nederlandsch Zuid-Afrikaansche Vereeniging (Dutch South-African Society).|$|E

5|$|As {{with earlier}} campaigns, {{recruiting}} enough men was a problem. Jefferson {{called for the}} western counties of Virginia to provide militia manpower for Clark's campaign, but county officials protested {{that they could not}} spare the men. Militiamen did not want to <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> a lengthy expedition—they would be gone for six months to a year—while their families and homes were threatened by Lord Cornwallis's army in the east, by Indian raids from the north, and by Loyalists at home. Because of this resistance, Jefferson called for volunteers rather than ordering the militia to accompany the expedition.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of November 1846, the settlers had reached the Sierra Nevada where they became trapped by an early, heavy snowfall near Truckee (now Donner) Lake, high in the mountains. Their food supplies ran extremely low and, in mid-December, some of the group <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> foot to obtain help. Rescuers from California attempted to reach the settlers, but the first relief party did not arrive {{until the middle of}} February 1847, almost four months after the wagon train had become trapped. Of the 87 members of the party, 48 survived to reach California, many of them having eaten the dead for survival.|$|E
5|$|Charles Darwin {{had been}} told that the Beagle was {{expected}} to sail about the end of September 1831, but fitting out took longer. The Admiralty Instructions were received on 14 November, and on 23 November she was moved to anchorage, ready to depart. Repeated Westerly gales caused delays, and forced them to turn back after departing on 10 and 21 December. Drunkenness at Christmas lost another day. Finally, on the morning of 27 December, the Beagle left its anchorage in the Barn Pool, under Mount Edgecumbe {{on the west side of}} Plymouth Sound and <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> its surveying expedition.|$|E
