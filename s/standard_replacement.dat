25|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, these uniforms became outdated. The Fechheimer Bros. of Cincinnati {{created some}} uniforms for OSU. These uniforms {{were the same}} navy blue as the {{previous}} uniforms, except the buttons were changed to silver. At this time the chin straps and Eagle Ohio were also changed to silver. The plumes took on the modern red and gray appearance and were constructed of tough turkey feathers. The spats were changed from cloth to vinyl during this time as well. The shoulder patches changed design and size. The uniforms changed very little from the 1970s until 1988, except for things like hat manufacturer, a short period in which a large metal diamond Ohio replaced the Eagle Ohio, {{and the use of}} aluminum hat bands instead of the silver adjustable type. After the directorship of Charles Spohn, the Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma recognition bars were no longer authorized for wear on the OSUMB uniform. During the expansion years in the 1970s, many uniforms dating back to the 1940s had to be dug out of storage and updated with the current patch designs of the band. To a careful and up-close observer, one would notice significant differences in the cut and style of the uniforms being worn. Even hats were not standardized. The only common thread among the uniforms was the color, which even began to fade on older uniforms. It was common practice for band members to use black marker to fix frayed parts of the uniform which exposed white cotton lining. These uniforms also had to be used by the Military band, and were falling apart. Pieces were sourced as needed from manufacturers such as Ostwald, Bayly, Frechheimer, and DeMoulin Brothers. The Fechheimer Corporation began producing a police uniform in the 1980s that matched the design of the Marching Band uniforms.

The incumbent will deter entry when the technology is in infancy and return from investment is high. In this case ability to raise switching cost is important since entrant also has low cost.

40|$|Abstract: We {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} patents on the rate and direction of subsequent technological progress of standards. In particular, we focus upon the effect of including standard-essential patents. A recent stream of literature cautions against {{the negative effects of}} patents on subsequent innovation in complex technologies. We confront this idea with empirical evidence drawn from a large database of 3. 500 ICT standards. In our analysis, we highlight more differentiated effects. First, the effect of patents depends upon the degree of fragmentation of ownership. Including essential patents on a standard has a strong positive effect on continuous technological progress of the standard. However, this effect weakens if ownership over patents is increasingly fragmented. Second, patents have opposite effects on continuous and discontinuous technological change of standards. While the inclusion of essential patents (in case of sufficiently concentrated ownership) encourages continuous technological progress, it significantly delays discontinuous <b>standard</b> <b>replacements...</b>|$|R

The literature contains only one other detector specialized to detect replacement multiple bits, and those presented here are substantially more sensitive. The author also compares the detectability of standard LSB embedding with the two methods of embedding in the lower two bit planes: although the novel detectors have a high accuracy from the steganographer’s point of view, the empirical results indicate that embedding in the two lowest bit planes is preferable (in some cases, highly preferable) to embedding in one.
