To visually differentiate the time periods in which Butler set the story, Jennings used muted colors for the present and vibrant ones for the past to demonstrate how the remnants and relevance of slavery are <b>still</b> <b>with</b> <b>us.</b> The graphic novel adaption debuted as number one New York Times hardcover graphic book bestseller on January 29, 2017.|$|E
25|$|Mary used {{a drummer}} added to Bob, Mary and myself on {{electric}} bass. We did {{almost all the}} Les Paul-Mary Ford recordings but with more heavy end on the bass. Les having used guitar on his bass tracks with Mary earlier. On all their recordings (as good as they were), I always missed that deep dark sound... Mary (bless her heart) recorded {{a few of my}} compositions (never released), but she did an excellent job as always. Mary divorced Les Paul and later married her old school friend from Monrovia, California, namely Don Hatfield, who owned a large construction company in California.

Jones said: [...] "Mining is central to the story of Wales. It has shaped our history and communities and its social and physical legacy is <b>still</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> to this day.... It is only right that we have a permanent memorial." ...|$|E
2500|$|Even so, {{as is true}} with {{virtually}} all major denominations, the debate between the conservative and liberal persuasions of the Lutheran Church continues today. As the Gotwald heresy trial book puts it, in [...] "the Twenty-first Century, {{in the wake of}} the ecumenical movement, Lutherans are again being challenged to identify their reasons for being and knowing their true identity. Readers will find many of the same issues which dominated the trial of Luther Gotwald are <b>still</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> today, making it a good reason for becoming acquainted with its issues and how they were dealt with." ...|$|E

2500|$|Benjamin Parkyn Richardson, MLA 1888-1891, as {{also the}} first {{president}} of the Grenfell Agricultural Society which was established in 1884. [...] "In the death of Benjamin Parkyn Richardson, the district of Grenfell has lost one of its early pioneers and the town one of its most prominent and active citizens. Coming to what was then Grenfell in the spring of 1884, he at once identified himself with the interests of the West, at that time still uncertain, its future success- doubtful. The difficulties and discouragement of those early years, is still fresh and green in the memories of some who are <b>still</b> <b>with</b> <b>us,</b> but who, like him whose loss we now deplore, have lived to see the full dawn of a brighter day, and a truer knowledge of the land we live in."

50|$|An {{abundance}} of statistics shows that those conditions are <b>still</b> very much <b>with</b> <b>us.</b> The riots of the 60s constituted a staggering human tragedy.

40|$|When {{the deepest}} {{economic}} {{crisis of the}} past fifty years finally ends, a changed world will be left in its wake. Capitalism will <b>still</b> be <b>with</b> <b>us,</b> but the new capitalism could differ substantially from the old. One key feature could be a new form of globalisation. In the current crisis it is already apparent that nations that were relatively ‘decoupled' from global markets as they entered this recession have done better than the more ‘globalised' ones.

60|$|So I say, {{the work}} was never done. At the end of six months my {{loneliness}} was broken {{by the arrival of}} two comrades.

60|$|We had a lady staying <b>with</b> <b>us</b> at the time--she <b>still</b> resides <b>with</b> <b>us,</b> {{but she is}} now older, and {{possessed of}} more judgment--who was no respecter of cats.

She also laboured under the error {{that the way to}} feed a cat was to ram things into its head, and that its pleasure was to be taken out for a ride in a doll's perambulator. I dreaded the first meeting of Thomas Henry with this lady. I feared lest she should give him a false impression of us as a family, and that we should suffer in his eyes.|$|R

50|$|US 81 at its {{inception}} in 1926 followed the route of State Highway 2, which began in Laredo and passed through San Antonio, Austin, Waco, and Fort Worth before passing over the Red River into Oklahoma four miles (6 km) north of Ringgold. The 1936 Official Map of the Highway System of Texas clearly shows the route labeled both as US 81 and S.H. 2. It was cosigned <b>with</b> <b>U.S.</b> Highway 83 for 18 mi from Laredo to 2 mi south of Webb, <b>with</b> <b>U.S.</b> Highway 79 for 18 mi from Austin north to Round Rock, and <b>with</b> <b>U.S.</b> Highway 77 for 33 mi from Waco to Hillsboro.

40|$|January 11, 2011 — The {{separation}} of southern Sudan has undoubtedly been traumatic for the absolute {{majority of people}} on the northern border of the divide. Amongst others, the departure of the south has dealt a serious blow to the concept of New Sudan, ironically associated with John Garang, the southern saviour of the Nation who did not survive to keep the country together. To his credit, Garang’s struggle for freedom, equality and unity was not all in vain. The spirit of New Sudan that he inspired <b>still</b> lives <b>with</b> <b>us</b> and will undoubtedly remain the only vision that can deliver us out of our current impasse...|$|R
