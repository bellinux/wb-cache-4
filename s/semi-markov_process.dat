The entire process is not Markovian, i.e., memoryless, as happens in a continuous time Markov chain/process (CTMC). Instead the process is Markovian only at the specified jump instants. This is the rationale behind the name, Semi-Markov. (See also: hidden semi-Markov model.) ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Semi-Markov</b> <b>{{processes}}</b> are Markovian {{processes in}} which the firing time of the transitions is modelled by probabilistic distributions over positive reals interpreted as the probability of firing a transition at a certain moment in time. In this paper we consider the trace-based semantics of <b>semi-Markov</b> <b>processes,</b> and investigate {{the question of how}} to compare two <b>semi-Markov</b> <b>processes</b> with respect to their time-dependent behaviour. To this end, we introduce the relation of being "faster than" between processes and study its algorithmic complexity. Through a connection to probabilistic automata we obtain hardness results showing in particular that this relation is undecidable. However, we present an additive approximation algorithm for a time-bounded variant of the faster-than problem over <b>semi-Markov</b> <b>processes</b> with slow residence-time functions, and a coNP algorithm for the exact faster-than problem over unambiguous <b>semi-Markov</b> <b>processes...</b>|$|R
40|$|Applied <b>Semi-Markov</b> <b>Processes</b> aims {{to give to}} {{the reader}} the tools {{necessary}} to apply <b>semi-Markov</b> <b>processes</b> in real-life problems. The book is self-contained and, starting from a low level of probability concepts, gradually brings the reader to a deep knowledge of <b>semi-Markov</b> <b>processes.</b> The book presents homogeneous and non-homogeneous <b>semi-Markov</b> <b>processes,</b> as well as Markov and <b>semi-Markov</b> rewards <b>processes.</b> These concepts are fundamental for many applications, but they are not as thoroughly presented in other books on the subject as they are here.
