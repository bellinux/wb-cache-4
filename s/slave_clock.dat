50|$|In {{telecommunication}} and horology, a <b>slave</b> <b>clock</b> is a {{clock that}} depends for its accuracy on another clock, a master clock. Many modern clocks are synchronized, either through the Internet or by radio time signals, to a worldwide time standard called Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) {{based on a}} network of master atomic clocks in many countries. For scientific purposes, precision clocks can be synchronized to within a few nanoseconds by dedicated satellite channels. <b>Slave</b> <b>clock</b> synchronization is usually achieved by phase-locking the <b>slave</b> <b>clock</b> signal to a signal received from the master clock. To adjust for the transit time of the signal from the master clock to the <b>slave</b> <b>clock,</b> the phase of the <b>slave</b> <b>clock</b> may be adjusted {{with respect to the}} signal from the master clock so that both clocks are in phase. Thus, the time markers of both clocks, at the output of the clocks, occur simultaneously.|$|E

5000|$|The {{advantages}} of the Shortt clock are first, it reduced the disturbance of the master pendulum due to the impulse by only giving the pendulums an impulse once every 30 seconds exactly (30 pendulum swings), and second, it eliminated all other interaction with the master pendulum by generating the necessary precise timing signal to control the <b>slave</b> <b>clock</b> (and record the passage of time) from the impulse mechanism itself, leaving the pendulum to swing [...] "free" [...] of interference.|$|E

50|$|Both pendulums were seconds pendulums, about 1 meter (39 in) long, with {{a period}} of 2 seconds; each swing of the master took exactly one second, with the slave's natural rate very {{slightly}} longer. The pendulums received a push from the mechanism once every 30 seconds to keep them swinging. The <b>slave</b> <b>clock</b> had two clock dials on it, showing the time kept by each pendulum, to verify that they were synchronized. It also had electrical terminals which produced a 1 Hz timing signal. Wires could be attached to these to transmit the clock's ultra-accurate time signal to clocks in other cities, or broadcast it by radio.|$|E

Notable exhibits include John Harrison's sea watch, the H4, which received a large reward from the Board of Longitude, and his three earlier marine timekeepers; all four are the property of the Ministry of Defence. Many additional horological artefacts are displayed, documenting the history of precision timekeeping for navigational and astronomical purposes, including the mid-20th-century Russian-made F.M. Fedchenko clock (the most accurate pendulum clock ever built in multiple copies).

50|$|The {{master and}} slave pendulums were linked {{together}} in a feedback loop which kept the slave synchronized with the master. The <b>slave</b> <b>clock</b> had a mechanical escapement using a 15-tooth count wheel which was moved forward each right-hand pendulum swing by a pawl attached to the pendulum. Every 15 oscillations (30 seconds), this released a gravity lever which gave the slave pendulum a push. This simultaneously closed a switch which reset the gravity lever and sent a pulse of current to an electromagnet which released a second gravity lever in the master unit to give the master pendulum a push. The impulse {{was provided by the}} weight of the gravity lever (acting as a remontoire) rolling off a wheel attached to the pendulum, this mechanism ensuring that the pendulum received an identical impulse, at precisely the same part of its stroke, every 30 seconds. The falling gravity lever closed another pair of contacts which reset the lever and provided an electrical pulse back to the slave unit.|$|E

5000|$|The {{competition}} for selling exact time necessitated developing a reliable master clock and auxiliary clocks. Connecting multiple clocks via electrical wires {{in a system}} had proved feasible. Two slightly different master clock-slave clock concepts emerged. The first entailed {{the use of an}} electro-mechanical [...] "synchronizer" [...] to forcibly bring the minute hand to the 12 position exactly on the hour. Each of the clocks in this system used a complete clock mechanism {{with the addition of a}} synchronizer. A central clock (master clock) sent the synchronizing signal along telegraph lines to each clock, thereby assuring that all clocks displayed exactly the same time. The individual clocks in this system had self-contained batteries and required three volts direct current (DC) to operate. The batteries for the synchronizing system transmission were located in a central office. The use of the mechanical synchronizer was the design of Chester H. Pond and his associates as they formed the SWCC in 1886. A second approach to synchronized time transmitted along wires was to connect a master clock to relatively simple secondary clocks (slave clocks). The slave clocks did not have complete clockworks but simply a mechanism that, when energized electrically from the master clock, would advance the clock hands one unit of time. The <b>slave</b> <b>clock</b> would display exactly the same time as the master clock. Slave clocks were much less complicated to manufacture and required little or no servicing. Initially they were more prone to failure. Each of the slave clocks had wires that connected to the master clock. The master clock in this system required 24 volts DC to both wind the master clock and as a source of current to advance the hands of the <b>slave</b> <b>clock.</b> These master-slave systems were more suited for individual buildings such as schools or factories, rather than locations that were great distances apart. A master-slave clock system was developed and marketed in 1886 by Charles D. Warner and operated as the Standard Electric Time Company. The accuracy of the master-slave system was dictated by the accuracy of the master clock and reliability of the slave clocks. Over the years, correction systems were developed for the master-slave systems that rendered the systems very reliable and accurate. In the first three decades of the 20th century, many more companies entered the time-selling business. When one considers the entire country, the number of synchronized clock systems installed in learning institutions, factories, businesses, government installations, transportation facilities, and other buildings, was enormous. Many hundreds of thousands of slave clocks and probably tens of thousands of master clocks were manufactured, sold, installed and serviced by people involved in the exact-time-for-sale business.|$|E
5000|$|The Shortt clock {{consists}} of two separate units: the master pendulum in a copper vacuum tank 26 cm diameter and 125 cm high attached to a wall, and a precision pendulum clock [...] "slaved" [...] to it, standing a few feet away. To prevent any possibility of coupling between the pendulums, the two units were either installed far apart in different rooms, or the units were oriented so the planes of swing of the two pendulums were ninety degrees apart. The <b>slave</b> <b>clock</b> was {{a modified version of}} a standard Synchronome precision regulator clock. The two components were linked by wires which carried electric pulses that operated electromagnets in the mechanisms to keep the two pendulums swinging in synchronism. The master pendulum rod and its 14-pound weight were made of the alloy invar to reduce thermal expansion and contraction of the pendulum, which causes the pendulum's period to vary with changes in temperature. The residual thermal expansion rate was compensated to zero with a metal insert under the bob. The vacuum tank was evacuated by a hand-operated pump to a pressure of around 30 mm Hg to prevent changes in atmospheric pressure from affecting the rate of the pendulum, and also to greatly reduce aerodynamic drag on the pendulum, which increased its Q factor from 25,000 to 110,000, thus increasing its accuracy by a factor of four. Experiments by Shortt showed that at 30 mm Hg the energy consumed by the flexing of the suspension spring just equalled the energy consumed by deflecting the residual air molecules and therefore a higher vacuum was not required.|$|E
50|$|A {{clock that}} employs {{electricity}} {{in some form}} to power a conventional clock mechanism is an electromechanical clock. Any spring or weight driven clock that uses electricity (either AC or DC) to rewind the spring or raise {{the weight of a}} mechanical clock then is an electromechanical clock. In electromechanical clocks the electricity serves no time keeping function. The timekeeping function is regulated by the pendulum. Near {{the end of the nineteenth}} century, the availability of the dry cell battery made it practical to use electric power in clocks. The use of electricity then led to many variations of clock and motor designs. Electromechanical clocks were made as individual timepieces but most commonly were used as integral parts of synchronized time installations. Experience in telegraphy led to connecting remote clocks (slave clocks) via wires to a controlling (master clock) clock. The goal was to create a clock system where each clock displayed exactly the same time. The master and the slaves are electromechanical clocks. The master clock has a conventional self-winding clock mechanism that is rewound electrically. The <b>slave</b> <b>clock</b> mechanism is not a conventional clock mechanism as it consists only of a ratchet wheel and time train. Slave clocks rely upon electrical impulses from the master clock to mechanically move the clock hands one unit of time. Synchronized time systems are made up of one master clock and any number of slave clocks. The slave clocks are connected by wires to the master clock. These systems are found in locations where multiple clocks would be used such as learning institutions, businesses, factories, transportation networks, banks, offices and government facilities. A notable example of this type of system is the Shortt-Synchronome clock, which is an example of an electromechanical gravity remontoire. These self-winding clock systems were usually low voltage DC. They were installed thru the 1950s and by then systems with synchronous motor clocks were becoming the clock system of choice.|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{proposes to}} combine the IEEE 1588 {{protocol}} and the adaptive oscillator correction method (AOCM) to improve master-slave synchronization. This is done by extending the AOCM to a <b>slave</b> <b>clock</b> to train a model using the IEEE 1588 synchronization updates from a master clock. The model corrections are applied to the <b>slave</b> <b>clock</b> during the waiting period in between the synchronization updates and when the slave-master network experiences an outage. The NS- 2 {{results indicate that the}} slave accuracy improves up to 10 times for no traffic networks depending on the <b>slave</b> <b>clock</b> training period. In traffic scenarios, the slave accuracy is affected by the asymmetric delays such that the degree of accuracy is one half of the asymmetric latencies. During network congestion, the slave accuracy improves because the delays are less asymmetric.

40|$|To support {{system-wide}} synchronization {{accuracy and}} precision in the sub-microsecond range without using GPS technique, the precise time protocol (PTP) standard IEEE- 1588 v 2 is chosen. Recently, a new clock skew estimation technique was proposed for the slave based on a dual <b>slave</b> <b>clock</b> method that assumes that the packet delay variation (PDV) in the Ethernet network is a constant delay. However, papers dealing with the Ethernet network have shown that this PDV is a long range dependency (LRD) process which may be modeled as a fractional Gaussian noise (fGn) with Hurst exponent (H) {{in the range of}} 0. 5 <H< 1. In this paper, we propose a new clock skew estimator based on the maximum likelihood (ML) technique and derive an approximated expression for the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) both valid for the case where the PDV is modeled as fGn (0. 5 <H< 1).

In the <b>slave</b> <b>clock</b> system, the PLL has been optimally de-signed so that the total phase-time variation in the whole network is significantly less than 10 ps. This phase-time variation is recommended by International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee (CCITT). The design method and PLL control algo-rithm enable both an optimum time constant of the PLL and a frequency departure of 10 - 12 in a holdover operation. The functions of the frequency distribution system has the intrinsic capability of being expanded and applied to a time transfer system. Since the frequencies are syn-chronized, a phase-time of the standard frequency signal can be synchronized to a coordinate time scale by an initial time setting, c. g., using portable clocks. Time synchroniza t ion capability {{is determined by the}} relative phase-time variation of standard frequency signals and the time accuracy of the initial phase-time setting. Relative phase-time variation can be reduced to within 500 ns by using wander correction. The initial time accuracy is within 0. 1 p s in conventional portable cesium beam standards.
