5|$|In normal neuromuscular function, a {{nerve impulse}} is carried down the axon (the long {{projection}} of a nerve cell) from the spinal cord. At the nerve ending in the neuromuscular junction, where the impulse {{is transferred to}} the muscle cell, the nerve impulse leads {{to the opening of}} voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC), the influx of calcium ions into the nerve terminal, and the calcium-dependent triggering of synaptic vesicle fusion with plasma membrane. These synaptic vesicles contain acetylcholine, which is released into the <b>synaptic</b> <b>cleft</b> and stimulates the acetylcholine receptors on the muscle. The muscle then contracts.|$|E

40|$|Neurotransmitter -aminobutyric acid (GABA) {{release to}} the <b>synaptic</b> <b>clefts</b> is {{mediated}} by {{the formation of a}} soluble N-eth-ylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex, which includes two target SNAREs syntaxin 1 A and SNAP- 25 and one vesicle SNARE VAMP- 2. The target SNAREs syntaxin 1 A and SNAP- 25 form a heterodimer, the putative intermediate of the SNARE complex.

5|$|Inside the brain, {{dopamine}} {{functions as}} a neurotransmitter and neuromodulator, and is controlled {{by a set of}} mechanisms common to all monoamine neurotransmitters. After synthesis, dopamine is transported from the cytosol into synaptic vesicles by a solute carrier—a vesicular monoamine transporter, VMAT2. Dopamine is stored in these vesicles until it is ejected into the <b>synaptic</b> <b>cleft.</b> In most cases, the release of dopamine occurs through a process called exocytosis which is caused by action potentials, {{but it can also be}} caused by the activity of an intracellular trace amine-associated receptor, TAAR1. TAAR1 is a high-affinity receptor for dopamine, trace amines, and certain substituted amphetamines that is located along membranes in the intracellular milieu of the presynaptic cell; activation of the receptor can regulate dopamine signaling by inducing dopamine reuptake inhibition and efflux as well as by inhibiting neuronal firing through a diverse set of mechanisms.|$|E
25|$|At a {{chemical}} synapse, one neuron releases neurotransmitter molecules {{into a small}} space (the <b>synaptic</b> <b>cleft)</b> that is adjacent to another neuron. The neurotransmitters are kept within small sacs called vesicles, and are released into the <b>synaptic</b> <b>cleft</b> by exocytosis. These molecules then bind to receptors on the postsynaptic cell's side of the <b>synaptic</b> <b>cleft.</b> Finally, the neurotransmitters must be cleared from the synapse through one of several potential mechanisms including enzymatic degradation or re-uptake by specific transporters either on the presynaptic cell or possibly by neuroglia to terminate {{the action of the}} transmitter.|$|E
25|$|Excitotoxicity {{can occur}} from {{substances}} produced {{within the body}} (endogenous excitotoxins).

During normal conditions, glutamate concentration can be increased up to 1mM in the <b>synaptic</b> <b>cleft,</b> which is rapidly decreased in the lapse of milliseconds. When the glutamate concentration around the <b>synaptic</b> <b>cleft</b> cannot be decreased or reaches higher levels, the neuron kills itself by a process called apoptosis.|$|E
40|$|The act of {{micturition}} differs strongly among species. For example, {{adult cats}} and humans urinate primarily {{in a safe}} environment (`guarded urination'), while rats urinate more reflexively (`reflex urination'). This study in adult rats investigates the existence of direct lumbosacral cord projections to spinally projecting neurons in the pontine micturition center (PMC). Bilateral injections of wheat germ agglutinin horseradish peroxidase in the caudal lumbar and rostral sacral cord resulted in labeled profiles, including retrogradely labeled neurons in the PMC. At the ultrastructural level, anterogradely labeled terminals in the PMC were found, which were filled with many round and some pleiomorphic and flat vesicles. About eleven percent of the terminals contacted retrogradely labeled dendrites. Of the labeled terminals 80 % contained asymmetric <b>synaptic</b> <b>clefts,</b> and 20 % symmetric <b>synaptic</b> <b>clefts.</b> The results provide evidence that in the rat, unlike the cat, a direct lumbosacral pathway to the PMC exists, which might explain the differences in micturition behavior between rats and cats. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Recycling of endosomes is {{important}} for trafficking and maintenance of proteins at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). We have previously shown high expression of the endocytic recycling regulator Eps 15 homology domain-containing (EHD) 1 proteinin the Torpedo californica electric organ, a model tissue for investigating a cholinergic synapse. In this study, we investigated the localization of EHD 1 and its paralogs EHD 2, EHD 3, and EHD 4 in mouse skeletal muscle, and assessed the morphological changes in EHD 1 −/− NMJs. Methods Localization of the candidate NMJ protein EHD 1 was assessed by confocal microscopy analysis of whole-mount mouse skeletal muscle fibers after direct gene transfer and immunolabeling. The potential function of EHD 1 was assessed by specific force measurement and α-bungarotoxin-based endplate morphology mapping in EHD 1 −/− mouse skeletal muscle. Results Endogenous EHD 1 localized to primary <b>synaptic</b> <b>clefts</b> of murine NMJ, and this localization was confirmed by expression of recombinant green fluorescent protein labeled-EHD 1 in murine skeletal muscle in vivo. EHD 1 −/− mouse skeletal muscle had normal histology and NMJ morphology, and normal specific force generation during muscle contraction. The EHD 1 – 4 proteins showed differential localization in skeletal muscle: EHD 2 to muscle vasculature, EHD 3 to perisynaptic regions, and EHD 4 to perinuclear regions and to primary <b>synaptic</b> <b>clefts,</b> but at lower levels than EHD 1. Additionally, specific antibodies raised against mammalian EHD 1 - 4 recognized proteins of the expected mass in the T. californica electric organ. Finally, we found that EHD 4 expression was more abundant in EHD 1 −/− mouse skeletal muscle than in wild-type skeletal muscle. Conclusion EHD 1 and EHD 4 localize to the primary <b>synaptic</b> <b>clefts</b> of the NMJ. Lack of obvious defects in NMJ structure and muscle function in EHD 1 −/− muscle {{may be due to}} functional compensation by other EHD paralogs. </p...|$|R
25|$|In a {{chemical}} synapse, {{the process of}} synaptic transmission is as follows: when an action potential reaches the axon terminal, it opens voltage-gated calcium channels, allowing calcium ions to enter the terminal. Calcium causes synaptic vesicles filled with neurotransmitter molecules to fuse with the membrane, releasing their contents into the <b>synaptic</b> <b>cleft.</b> The neurotransmitters diffuse across the <b>synaptic</b> <b>cleft</b> and activate receptors on the postsynaptic neuron. High cytosolic calcium in the axon terminal also triggers mitochondrial calcium uptake, which, in turn, activates mitochondrial energy metabolism to produce ATP to support continuous neurotransmission.|$|E

40|$|Human T-lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV- 1) is {{transmitted}} directly between cells via an organized cell-cell contact called a virological synapse (VS) [1, 2]. The VS {{has been studied}} by light microscopy, but the ultrastructure of the VS {{and the nature of}} the transmitted viral particle have remained unknown. Cell-free enveloped virions of HTLV- 1 are undetectable in the serum of individuals infected with the human T-lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV- 1) and during in vitro culture of naturally infected lymphocytes. However, the viral envelope protein is required for infectivity of HTLV- 1, suggesting that complete, enveloped HTLV- 1 virions are transferred across the synapse. Here, we use electron tomography combined with immunostaining of viral protein to demonstrate the presence of enveloped HTLV- 1 particles within the VS formed between naturally infected lymphocytes. We show in 3 D that HTLV- 1 particles can be detected in multiple <b>synaptic</b> <b>clefts</b> at different locations simultaneously within the same VS.

In the absence of {{pathological}} insult, their highly motile processes continually survey the brain parenchyma and transiently contact synaptic elements. Aside from monitoring, their physiological roles at synapses are not known. To gain insight into possible roles of microglia in the modification of synaptic structures, we used immunocytochemical electron microscopy, serial section electron microscopy with three-dimensional reconstructions, and two-photon in vivo imaging to characterize microglial interactions with synapses during normal and altered sensory experience, in the visual cortex of juvenile mice. During normal visual experience, most microglial processes displayed direct apposition with multiple synapse-associated elements, including <b>synaptic</b> <b>clefts.</b> Microglial processes were also distinctively surrounded by pockets of extracellular space. In terms of dynamics, microglial processes localized to the vicinity of small and transiently growing dendritic spines, which were typically lost over 2 d. When experience was manipulated through light deprivation and reexposure, microglial processes changed their morphology, showed altered distributions of extracellular space, displayed phagocytic structures, apposed <b>synaptic</b> <b>clefts</b> more frequently, and enveloped synapse-associated elements more extensively. While light deprivation induced microglia to become less motile and changed their preference of localization to the vicinity of a subset of larger dendritic spines that persistently shrank, light reexposure reversed these behaviors.

50|$|In addition, the TCAs {{interact}} with adrenergic receptors. This interaction {{seems to be}} critical for increased availability of norepinephrine {{in or near the}} <b>synaptic</b> <b>clefts.</b> Actions of imipramine-like tricyclic antidepressants have complex, secondary adaptions to their initial and sustained actions as inhibitors of norepinephrine transport and variable blockade of serotonin transport. Norepinephrine interacts with postsynaptic α and β adrenergic receptor subtypes and presynaptic α2 autoreceptors. The α2 receptors include presynaptic autoreceptors which limit the neurophysiological activity of noradrenergic neurons in the central nervous system. Formation of norepinephrine is reduced by autoreceptors through the rate-limiting enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase, an effect mediated by decreased cyclic AMP-mediated phosphorylation-activation of the enzyme. α2 receptors also cause decreased intracellular cyclic AMP expression which results in smooth muscle relaxation or decreased secretion. TCAs activate a negative feedback mechanism through their effects on presynaptic receptors. One probable explanation for the effects on decreased neurotransmitter release is that, as the receptors activate, inhibition of neurotransmitter release occurs (including suppression of voltage-gated Ca2+ currents and activation of G protein-coupled receptor-operated K+ currents). Repeated exposure of agents with this type of mechanism leads to inhibition of neurotransmitter release, but repeated administration of TCAs finally leads to decreased responses by α2 receptors.The desensitization of these responses may be due to increased exposure to endogenous norepinephrine or from the prolonged occupation of the norepinephrine transport mechanisms (via an allosteric effect). The adaptation allows the presynaptic synthesis and secretion of norepinephrine to return to, or even exceed, normal levels of norepinephrine in the <b>synaptic</b> <b>clefts.</b> Overall, inhibition of norepinephrine reuptake induced by TCAs, leads to decreased rates of neuron firing (mediated through α2 autoreceptors), metabolic activity, and release of neurotransmitters.|$|R
