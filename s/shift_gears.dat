5|$|At Dunder-Mifflin, Clark Green (Clark Duke) {{returns from}} his stint as Jan Levinson's (Melora Hardin) sexual assistant. Despite the awkward {{past couple of}} weeks, Jan has gifted them an espresso machine, {{and the rest of}} the office jumps on the {{opportunity}} to 'test' out several espresso flavors. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) enlists Clark's help to snag a newly freed account at a suit warehouse; the two will pose as a father and son so that they can successfully sell to the Stones, father and son owners of the warehouse. Dwight leads off on how proud he is of Clark to elder Stone (Ed Lauter), but when Stone admits that he and his son are not on good terms, Dwight and Clark awkwardly <b>shift</b> <b>gears</b> and begin a show of childishly sniping at each other. Clark tries to move on to business, but Dwight continues to interrupt him with insults, and even makes a dig at the younger Stone (Will Greenberg) when he arrives. When the elder Stone reveals that his son has forced him out of the company and that he is now there strictly for his own social benefit, Clark takes the lead and makes the sale to the younger Stone. Both Dwight and Clark also buy a suit from the company to celebrate their team sale.|$|E
25|$|A dual-clutch transmission, (DCT) (sometimes {{referred}} to as a twin-clutch transmission or double-clutch transmission), is a type of automatic transmission or automated automotive transmission. It uses two separate clutches for odd and even gear sets. It can fundamentally be described as two separate manual transmissions with their respective clutches contained within one housing, and working as one unit. Although usually operated in a fully automatic mode, many also have the ability to allow the driver to manually <b>shift</b> <b>gears</b> in semi-automatic mode, albeit still using the transmission's electrohydraulics.|$|E

25|$|Magnussen {{made a good}} getaway off the grid, {{moving to}} sixth, which {{involved}} passing Massa outside of track limits at the fifth corner, but later slid sideways at turn seven while fending off teammate Button which dropped him to ninth. Button made the best start in the field, gaining four positions {{by the end of}} the first lap, while Rosberg's pit lane start meant he lost 21 positions over the same distance. At the end of the first lap, Hamilton led from Vettel, Alonso, Ricciardo, Räikkönen, Massa, Button, Bottas, Magnussen and Kvyat. Alonso's start was investigated by the stewards but elected to take no further action against the driver. Rosberg left the pit lane on the second lap but was initially unable to maintain the pace of Chilton's Marussia. DRS was enabled on the third lap as the field spread out and Magnussen was investigated by the stewards for going beyond track limits. McLaren teammates Magnussen and Button avoided colliding with each other on lap four and the result meant they fell behind both Williams cars. Vettel kept Hamilton's lead advantage constant, prompting the latter to increase his pace by going half a second faster than Vettel while conserving fuel.Rosberg overtook Chilton to move into 20th on lap five, while Kvyat was told over his radio to battle Magnussen after going three-tenths of a second faster than Magnussen in the first sector on the following lap. Rosberg was not able to overtake Ericsson and was more than 40 seconds behind race leader Hamilton by the same lap. It was announced on the seventh lap that no further action against Magnussen was necessitated. Magnussen, Kvyat and Vergne were within one second of each other and battle for ninth place. Vergne encouraged his team get teammate Kvyat to cede a position to him but Kvyat insisted he had the pace to get past Magnussen. Kvyat lost tenth place to teammate Vergne on lap eight and the latter began gaining on Magnussen. Rosberg was only able to <b>shift</b> <b>gears</b> two at any one point and was five seconds slower than teammate Hamilton. Hamilton led the field by five seconds by the start of lap ten despite having balance problems with his car over the space of one lap. Massa ran closely behind Räikkönen by the time of his first pit stop at the end of lap ten as part of a plan by the Williams team to undercut the second Ferrari car. Räikkönen made his stop on the following lap and emerged behind Massa.|$|E

2500|$|The Insight {{uses the}} first {{generation}} of Honda's Integrated Motor Assist (IMA) hybrid technology. (The next generation, used in the Honda Civic Hybrid, is much more space-efficient.) The Insight's electric assist is an ultrathin 60mm (about 2.4inches) brushless 10-kW electric motor located on the crankshaft. Located behind the seats are a series of commercial grade [...] "D" [...] sized NiMH batteries wired to provide a nominal 144 V DC. During heavy acceleration, the NiMH batteries drive the electric motor, providing additional power; during deceleration, the motor acts as a generator and recharges the batteries using a process called regenerative braking. A computer control module regulates how much power comes from the internal combustion engine, and how much from the electric motor; in the CVT variant, it also finds the optimal gear ratio. The digital displays on the dashboard display fuel consumption instantaneously. On the manual transmission up and down arrows suggest when to <b>shift</b> <b>gears.</b> Dashboard gauges monitor the current battery status, instantaneous fuel consumption, and mode of the electric motor — standby, engine assist or charging the batteries. High pressure, low rolling resistance tires and the use of low viscosity [...] "0W-20" [...] synthetic oil enhance fuel economy.|$|E
2500|$|By [...] a new All-American Girls Softball League was formed, {{playing a}} hybrid form of {{softball}} and baseball that never really became baseball until overhand pitching began in [...] Women's softball was enormously {{popular in the}} early 1940s, and often drew good crowds. In June 1943, Time magazine estimated there were 40,000 women's softball teams in the U.S., including popular touring clubs such as Barney Ross' Adorables and Slapsie Maxie's Curvaceous Cuties. The new league was conceived by chewing gum magnate and Chicago Cubs owner Philip K. Wrigley, who decided in 1942 to start a women's professional softball league, concerned that the 1943 major-league season might be canceled because of World War II. The circuit would eventually <b>shift</b> <b>gears</b> and become the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, and was dissolved {{at the end of}} the [...] season. About 500 women attended the initial call. Of these, 280 were invited to the final try-outs at Wrigley Field in Chicago, where 60 of them were chosen to become the first women to ever play professional baseball. The 60 players were placed on the rosters of four fifteen-player teams: the Rockford Peaches, the South Bend Blue Sox, the Racine Belles and the Kenosha Comets.|$|E
