5|$|American {{publisher}} William Randolph Hearst bought {{parts of}} the monastery in 1931 {{with the intention of}} using its <b>stones</b> <b>in</b> the construction of a grand and fanciful castle at Wyntoon, California, but after some 10,000 stones were removed and shipped, they were abandoned in San Francisco for decades. These stones are now in various locations around California: the old church portal was erected at the University of San Francisco, and the chapter house was reassembled by Trappist monks at the Abbey of New Clairvaux in Vina, California. Other stones are serving as simple decorative elements in Golden Gate Park's botanical garden. To support the chapter house project, a line of Belgian-style beers was produced by Sierra Nevada Brewing Company under the Ovila Abbey brand.|$|E
5|$|Among the park's most {{distinctive}} and well-known features are the vehicular river crossings. At three places, crossing Pine Creek, fords were constructed instead of bridges.

Hikers are relegated to pedestrian bridges or stepping <b>stones</b> <b>in</b> the creek to cross the stream. Floods are frequent enough on Pine Creek, a large watershed {{to the north of}} the park, that there is an emergency exit from the campground. When high water closes the fords, the campground is cut off and the emergency exit is the only way out.|$|E
