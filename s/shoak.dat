30|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a {{considerable}} increase in participation of master athletes and in several age groups athletes also improved performance in different endurance sport disciplines such as marathon (Anthony et al. 2014; Jokl et al. 2004) and ultra-marathon running (Jampen et al. 2013; Rüst et al. 2013; Zingg et al. 2013) ultra-cycling (<b>Shoak</b> et al. 2013), long-distance triathlon such as Ironman triathlon (Lepers et al. 2013; Stiefel et al. 2013, 2014) and Triple and Deca Iron ultra-triathlon (Knechtle et al. 2012), long-distance inline-skating (Teutsch et al. 2013) and ultra-mountain biking (Haupt et al. 2013). Although large cross-sectional studies in swimming already investigated changes of age, performance (König et al. 2014) and sex differences (Wild et al. 2014) in World Championships, cross- sectional studies investigating participation and performance trends of master backstroke swimmers are missing.|$|E
30|$|Regarding cycling as {{the second}} {{discipline}} in triathlon, {{little is known about}} the sex difference in ultra-cycling (Rüst et al. 2013; <b>Shoak</b> et al. 2013; Zingg et al. 2013). For shorter cycling distances, Schumacher et al. (2001) reported a sex difference of ~ 11 % in all disciplines and at all ages when investigating results of the world track cycling championships in 200  m, 1, 000  m, individual and team pursuit races for elite and junior athletes. For longer distances, women reduced the gender gap in the 720  km ‘Swiss Cycling Marathon’, the largest European qualifier for the ‘Race Across America’ (Zingg et al. 2013). In the ‘Race Across America’ itself, the sex difference remained, however, unchanged at ~ 19 % for the annual fastest and at ~ 25 % for the annual three fastest in the last 30  years (Rüst et al. 2013).|$|E

The present study aimed to identify the countries in which multistage ultramarathons were held {{around the world and}} the nationalities of successful finishers. Methods: Finisher rates {{and performance}} trends of finishers in multistage ultramarathons held worldwide between 1992 and 2010 were investigated. Results: Between 1992 and 2010, the bulk of multistage ultramarathons were held in Germany and France, with more than 30 races organized in each country. Completion rates for men and women increased exponentially, with women representing on average 16. 4 % of the total field. Since 1992, 6480 athletes have competed in Morocco, 2538 in Germany, and 1842 in France. A total of 81. 9 % of athletes originated from Europe, and more specifically from France (22. 9 %), Great Britain (18. 0 %), and Germany (13. 4 %). Conclusion: European ultramarathoners dominated the athletes who completed multistage ultramarathons worldwide, with specific dominance of French, British, and German athletes. Future studies should investigate social aspects, such as sport tourism, among European athletes to understand why European athletes are so interested in participating in multistage ultramarathons.

The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate (1) participation {{and performance}} trends in ultraendurance cyclists, (2) changes in cycling speed over the years, and (3) the age of the fastest male and female ultraendurance cyclists. Methods: Participation and performance trends in the 5000 km Race Across America (RAAM) and in two RAAM-qualifier races &ndash; the 818 km Furnace Creek 508 in the United States and the 715 km Swiss Cycling Marathon in Europe &ndash; were investigated using linear regression analyses and analyses of variance. Results: On average, ~ 41 % of participants did not finish either the RAAM or the Furnace Creek 508, whereas ~ 26 % did not finish the Swiss Cycling Marathon. Female finishers accounted for ~ 11 % in both the RAAM and the Furnace Creek 508 but only ~ 3 % in the Swiss Cycling Marathon. The mean cycling speed of all finishers remained unchanged during the studied periods. The winner&rsquo;s average speed was faster for men than for women in the RAAM (22. 6 &plusmn; 1. 1 km &middot; h- 1 versus 18. 4 &plusmn; 1. 7 km&nbsp;&middot; h- 1, respectively; average speed difference between male and female winners, 25. 0 % &plusmn; 11. 9 %), the Swiss Cycling Marathon (30. 8 &plusmn; 0. 8 km&nbsp;&middot; h- 1 versus 24. 4 &plusmn; 1. 9 km&nbsp;&middot; h- 1, respectively; average speed difference between male and female winners, 27. 8 % &plusmn; 9. 4 %), and the Furnace Creek 508 (27. 4 &plusmn; 1. 6 km&nbsp;&middot; h- 1 versus 23. 4 &plusmn; 3. 0 km&nbsp;&middot; h- 1, respectively; average speed difference between male and female winners, 18. 4 % &plusmn; 13. 9 %). In both the Furnace Creek 508 and the Swiss Cycling Marathon, ~ 46 % of the finishers were aged between 35 and 49 years. The mean age of winners, both male and female, across the years in the Furnace Creek 508 and in the Swiss Cycling Marathon was 37 &plusmn; 10 years. Conclusion: These findings in ultracycling races showed that (1) ~ 26 %&ndash; 40 % of starters were unable to finish, (2) the percentage of female finishers was ~ 3 %&ndash; 11 %, (3) the gender difference in performance was ~ 18 %&ndash; 28 %, and (4) ~ 46 % of the successful finishers were master athletes. Future studies need to investigate the reasons for the low female participation and focus on the age-related performance decline in other ultraendurance events in order to confirm that master athletes are predisposed to ultraendurance performances.
