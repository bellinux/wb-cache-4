P. fimbriata also {{sometimes}} does not use cryptic <b>stalking</b> against females of the salticid subfamily Lyssomaninae. These females are unusually translucent, and the translucent cuticle makes the anterior-median eyes (front-and-center) show light and dark regions that flicker in and out when viewed head on. Lyssomanine males are not translucent and do not produce this flickering, and P. fimbriata uses cryptic <b>stalking</b> consistently against the males. This suggests that the flickering anterior-median eyes of lyssomanine females may reduce the ability of P. fimbriata to identify these females as jumping spiders.|$|E

He was charged with intimidation and <b>stalking</b> and was convicted and again imprisoned, this time for a decade-long sentence. Bell protested vociferously against the conduct of the trial, going so far as to file civil lawsuits against two judges, at least two prosecutors, his former probation officers, and his defense attorneys, but ultimately to no avail. He was released in December 2009, only to be rearrested in July 2010 for violating his parole conditions. Bell's parole violation hearing resulted in another sentence, and Bell was released on March 12, 2012.|$|E

40|$|Correlation and path {{coefficient}} {{analysis was}} undertaken among agronomic and bio-chemical characters of importance in sugarcane.

There was a non-significant but positive correlation between number of millable <b>stalks</b> refractrometer brix (0. 05), number of millable <b>stalks</b> and <b>stalk</b> height (0. 285) and other characters. In case of bio-chemical characters, positive and significant (P = 0. 01) correlation was recorded between Pure Obtainable Cane Sugar (POCS) and pol (0. 901), POCS and purity (0. 763) and pol and purity (0. 780). Negative but non-significant correlation was observed between POCS and fibre. Correlation studies indicate that for sugarcane yield plant volume, plant height, number of millable <b>stalks</b> per stool, <b>stalk</b> thickness and weight of millable <b>stalks</b> {{are the most important}} characters.

40|$|The Caulobacter crescentus cell {{extension}} {{known as}} a <b>stalk</b> represents an unusual bacterial morphology. C. crescentus produces <b>stalks</b> under multiple nutrient conditions, but {{the length of the}} <b>stalk</b> is increased in response to phosphate starvation. However, the exact function of the <b>stalk</b> is not known, nor is it known how much <b>stalk</b> biogenesis or function is conserved with other <b>stalked</b> bacteria. Work presented here shows that many organisms in the Caulobacter genus and the next closest genus (Brevundimonas) generally do not synthesize <b>stalks</b> in the relatively-rich PYE growth medium, suggesting that the synthesis of a <b>stalk</b> under nutrient-rich conditions by C. crescentus may be the exception instead of the norm among its phylogenetic group. Brevundimonas subvibrioides can be induced to synthesize <b>stalks</b> by genetically mimicking phosphate starvation conditions, indicating <b>stalk</b> synthesis in this organism may be performed on an as-need basis. This mutation, however, does not appear to increase the incidence of holdfast synthesis. While B. subvibrioides <b>stalks</b> appear to be synthesized with the same polarity with respect to holdfast as C. crescentus <b>stalks,</b> evidence is presented that suggests B. subvibrioides may disassemble <b>stalks</b> when they are no longer needed. Many homologs of C. crescentus genes encoding stalk-associated proteins are absent in the B. subvibrioides genome, and B. subvibrioides PstA-GFP as well as C. crescentus StpX-GFP are able to enter the B. subvibrioides <b>stalk</b> compartment, calling into question the level of compartmentalization of the B. subvibrioides <b>stalk.</b> In summary, this work begins to address how much the C. crescentus model for this unusual morphological adaptation can be extended to related organisms...|$|R

40|$|Water {{deficit is}} one of the major factors {{limiting}} the production of sugarcane, especially in areas where there is a prolonged period of water deficiency, such as the West Central Brazilian region. One way to overcome this problem is to cultivate resistant or tolerant varieties. An experiment was set up at the Jalles Machado Sugar Mill, located near Goianésia, Goiás State, Brazil, to evaluate agronomic performance of several sugarcane families. A comparative analysis was carried out among the families under two irrigation regimes, one under regular environmental conditions and another under monthly irrigations during the period of water deficiency. Evaluated families consisted of 25 progenies planted in a factorial design with three replications with 20 plants each. The first ratoon crop was evaluated for four yield components, <b>stalk</b> height, <b>stalk</b> diameter, <b>stalk</b> number and Brix. By analysis of variance, <b>stalk</b> number and <b>stalk</b> height were influenced by water stress conditions during the initial growth phase, and for <b>stalk</b> diameter and Brix, water regime had no effect on the average expression of the characters during the growth phase. The method of classification in four categories proved to be adequate. Some families had high values for <b>stalk</b> diameter, <b>stalk</b> number and <b>stalk</b> height under water stress conditions.
