2500|$|But a {{high-tech}} strand of modernism persisted {{in parallel with}} a formally retrogressive post-modernism; one that often championed [...] "progress" [...] by celebrating, if not exposing, <b>structure</b> <b>and</b> <b>systems</b> engineering. [...] Such technological virtuosity can be discovered during {{this time in the}} work of Norman Foster, Renzo Piano, and Richard Rogers, the latter two having designed the controversial Pompidou Centre (1977) in Paris, which opened to international acclaim. What this so‑called high-tech architecture showed was that an industrial aesthetic—an architecture characterized as much by urban grittiness as engineering efficiency—had popular appeal. This was also somewhat evident in so‑called Deconstructionist architecture, such as the employment of chainlink fencing, raw plywood and other industrial materials in designs for residential and commercial architecture. Arguably the most notable practitioner along these lines, at least in the 1970s, is the now internationally renowned architect Frank Gehry, whose house in Santa Monica, California, bears these characteristics.|$|E

Additionally, the research sought to find out how leadership affected the implementation of the <b>structures</b> <b>and</b> <b>systems</b> at the school site.

The focal group {{of the study was}} African American students in a comprehensive high school grades 9 through 12. The study began with an analysis of the historical achievement disparity between African American students and their White counterparts. The study addressed four research questions for which the overarching theoretical framework was sociocultural in nature. Operational definitions developed by a thematic dissertation group were provided for school <b>structures</b> <b>and</b> <b>systems</b> as a prelude to the line of inquiry and discussion about their effectiveness.; An examination of trends and patterns of achievement of African American students as well as other students of color within this high school addressed social and cultural capital as espoused by Coleman, Bourdieu, and Stanton-Salazar.

Effective classroom practices were examined from the perspective of their support from school <b>structures</b> <b>and</b> <b>systems,</b> using Vygotsky' s sociocultural theory of learning as the framework.

All African American and Latino students can experience high academic achievement; however, they have been denied an equal education.; Students of color living in high poverty areas face serious challenges within the educational system. Many schools in high poverty areas experience issues such as, high drop out rates, lack of language proficiency for second language learners, instruction from the least experienced teachers, and lack of resources and space. Despite these challenges some schools in high poverty areas have been successful in meeting the needs of {{students of color}}.; This study examined a high performing elementary school located in a high poverty urban area, <b>and</b> the <b>structures</b> <b>and</b> <b>systems</b> implemented to achieve success for students of color. A qualitative study approach was used to conduct an in-depth study of the high performing school. The study explored four research questions to determine the factors that lead to the schools' success. The four research questions included: 1.

40|$|AbstractSafety {{culture is}} a term with {{numerous}} definitions in the literature. Many authors advocate a prescriptive approach to safety culture in which if an organisation has certain levels of externally prescribed <b>systems</b> <b>and</b> <b>structures</b> in place it has a ‘good safety culture’. Conversely, other researchers suggest an anthropological approach of exploring deep meanings and understandings present within an organisation's workforce. In a recent published review, the authors presented an alternative view to safety culture, in which the anthropological aspects of safety culture interact with the <b>structures</b> <b>and</b> <b>systems</b> in place within an organisation to result in behavioural patterns. This {{can be viewed as}} a human factors approach to safety culture in which, through understanding the specific interactions between the culture of a workforce and external organisational elements, organisational <b>structures</b> <b>and</b> <b>systems</b> can be optimised in order to shape worker behaviour and improve safety. This paper presents findings from a recent investigation of safety culture in the Australian heavy vehicle (transport) industry. Selected results are discussed to explore how understanding culture can provide direction to the optimisation of organisational <b>structures</b> <b>and</b> <b>systems</b> to match worker culture and thus improve safety. Specifically the value placed on personal experience and stories, as well as on both time and money are discussed, and interventions that are suited to these aspects of the culture are discussed. These findings demonstrate the importance of shifting beyond mere prescriptive and interpretive approaches to safety culture and instead to focus on the interaction between cultural and contextual elements to optimise organisational <b>structures</b> <b>and</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
