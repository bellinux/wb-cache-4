5|$|Flanders {{felt that}} {{spending}} 62% of federal income on defense was irrational, when the <b>Soviet</b> <b>government</b> claimed it wished to avoid nuclear conflict. He advocated {{that the development}} of “A- and H-bombs be paralleled with equally intense negotiations towards disarmament.” For him, “gaining the co-operation of the <b>Soviet</b> <b>government</b> on an effective armament control,” was most important.|$|E

5|$|The {{rift between}} Khrushchev's <b>Soviet</b> <b>government</b> and North Vietnam was clearly obvious in August 1964, when the Soviet Union responded in a {{relatively}} muted fashion after the U.S. conducted air strikes against North Vietnamese Navy bases {{in retaliation for the}} Tonkin Gulf incident. Despite the Soviets’ lack of response, the North Vietnamese leadership restrained itself from criticizing the <b>Soviet</b> <b>government,</b> as they were still hoping that Khrushchev would supply North Vietnam with the anti-aircraft weapons required to defend against further U.S. air attacks. However, the event which occurred in Moscow in October 1964 worked in North Vietnam's favor, as Khrushchev was removed from power. Keen to counteract Chinese influence in the region, a new <b>Soviet</b> <b>government</b> led by Alexei Kosygin sought to end a defense pact with North Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|To repopulate the claimed {{areas with}} Armenians, the <b>Soviet</b> <b>government</b> {{organized}} a repatriation of Armenians living abroad, mostly {{survivors of the}} Armenian Genocide. Between 1946 and 1948, 90,000 to 100,000 Armenians from Lebanon, Syria, Greece, Iran, Romania, France, and elsewhere moved to Soviet Armenia.|$|E
5|$|Bond is {{assigned}} {{the task of}} following a general who is stealing jewels and relics from the <b>Soviet</b> <b>government.</b> This leads him to a wealthy Afghan prince, Kamal Khan, and his associate, Octopussy, and {{the discovery of a}} plot to force disarmament in Western Europe {{with the use of a}} nuclear weapon.|$|E
50|$|The {{right of}} secession was soon {{exercised}} by many nations that earlier had {{been incorporated into}} Imperial Russia. Many areas in Russia itself were also declared independent republics. Bolshevist Russia would, however, attempt to establish Soviet power in as many of those as possible. All three Baltic states experienced wars between <b>Soviet</b> <b>governments</b> aiming to establish a Communist state allied with Bolshevist Russia and non-Communist governments aiming for an independent state. The <b>Soviet</b> <b>governments</b> received direct military support from Russia. After the non-Communist side won, Russia recognized them as the legitimate governments of the Baltic states in 1920.|$|R
50|$|UNITA and the Angolan {{government}} began six rounds of negotiations in April 1991. The Portuguese government represented by foreign minister José Manuel Barroso mediated the discussion while {{officials from the}} U.S. and <b>Soviet</b> <b>governments</b> observed.|$|R
50|$|Dmitry Pyotrovich Bagration (Дмитрий Петрович Багратион; 13 June 1863 - 21 October 1919) was a Russian {{general and}} {{military}} writer. A scion of the Georgian royal family, he served under the Imperial, Provisional, and <b>Soviet</b> <b>governments.</b>|$|R
5|$|In December 1976, Bukovsky was {{forcibly}} deported {{from the}} USSR and exchanged at Zürich airport by the <b>Soviet</b> <b>government</b> for the imprisoned {{general secretary of}} the Communist Party of Chile, Luis Corvalán. In his 1978 autobiography Bukovsky describes how he was brought to Switzerland in handcuffs. The widely publicised exchange increased public awareness in the West about Soviet dissidents.|$|E
5|$|In June 1988, the {{archaeologist}} {{and leader}} of the Christian Conservative Party of the BPF Zyanon Paznyak discovered mass graves of victims executed in 1937–41 at Kurapaty, near Minsk. Some nationalists contend that this discovery is proof that the <b>Soviet</b> <b>government</b> was trying to erase the Belarusian people, causing Belarusian nationalists to seek independence.|$|E
5|$|Laika {{died within}} hours from overheating, {{possibly}} {{caused by a}} failure of the central R-7 sustainer to separate from the payload. The true cause and time of her death were not made public until 2002; instead, it was widely reported that she died when her oxygen ran out on day six or, as the <b>Soviet</b> <b>government</b> initially claimed, she was euthanised prior to oxygen depletion.|$|E
50|$|The {{primary goal}} of East German {{censorship}} was to protect the interests of communism and its implementation. Works critical of the East German or <b>Soviet</b> <b>governments</b> were forbidden, as were any works which seemed sympathetic to fascism.|$|R
50|$|Solzhenitsyn {{documented}} the <b>Soviet</b> <b>government's</b> {{reliance on the}} prison system for governance and labor, placing doubt on the entire moral standing of the <b>Soviet</b> system. The <b>government</b> could not govern without the threat of imprisonment. The Soviet economy depended on the productivity and output of the forced labor camps, especially insofar as the development and construction of public works and infrastructure were concerned.|$|R
5000|$|Alexandr Martynov (Alexandr Martinov; also, Aleksandr Samoilovich Pikker;) (1865 [...] - [...] 1935) was a Menshevik {{before the}} Russian {{revolutions}} of 1917, {{and for a}} few years after the revolution a critic of the <b>Soviet</b> <b>government's</b> theory of permanent revolution (1923).|$|R
5|$|Shultz and Godson {{note that}} {{manipulated}} groups involve both official departments of the Soviet state, {{as well as}} non-governmental organizations which lack independence from the state control itself. Specific goals exported by covert <b>Soviet</b> <b>government</b> channels and groups in the Western world were financed by Soviet intelligence operations. These covert operations were coordinated so as to have maximum impact related to major international incidents.|$|E
5|$|The Department of Revisory Control of the Ministries of Finance of the Union Republics: Controlled the {{implementation}} of the national budget of the republican Ministries of Finance and their local counterparts. The department also exercised control over enterprises and institutions directly subordinate to the <b>Soviet</b> <b>government.</b> The Department of Budget was a department which took part in drafting the budget of the Soviet Republics.|$|E
5|$|Their political, professional, {{and social}} {{backgrounds}} were diverse. Several rose to political prominence; Antanas Smetona and Aleksandras Stulginskis were later elected Presidents of Lithuania and Jonas Vileišis {{went on to}} become mayor of Kaunas, the temporary capital of Lithuania. After Lithuania lost its independence during World War II, six of the surviving signatories were sent to prison or executed by the <b>Soviet</b> <b>government</b> and six others emigrated to Western countries.|$|E
50|$|Television in Estonia was {{introduced}} in 1955, following the <b>Soviet</b> <b>government's</b> decision to establish a television station in 1953. The National TV Channel ETV has maintained an archive since 1955 in which broadcasts of unique aspects of Estonian culture are held.|$|R
5|$|Shootdown (1988), {{starring}} Angela Lansbury, John Cullum, and Kyle Secor, {{was based}} on the book of the same title by R.W. Johnson, about the efforts of Nan Moore (Lansbury), the mother of a passenger, to get answers from the U.S. and <b>Soviet</b> <b>governments.</b>|$|R
50|$|On 12 October 1954, the Chinese and <b>Soviet</b> <b>governments</b> {{announced}} {{that from the}} 1 January 1955, SKOGA would come completely under Chinese control. From this time, SKOGA ceased operations, and was superseded by the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) to handle Chinese air traffic.|$|R
5|$|This was in {{contrast}} to the Bolsheviks, who proclaimed the partitions of Poland null and void. Piłsudski thus speculated that Poland would be better off with the Bolsheviks, alienated from the Western powers, than with a restored Russian Empire. By ignoring the strong pressures from the Entente Cordiale to join the attack on Vladimir Lenin's struggling <b>Soviet</b> <b>government,</b> Piłsudski probably saved the Bolshevik government in the summer and fall of 1919.|$|E
5|$|With {{the end of}} World War II, Soviet troops {{occupied}} the easternmost part of Denmark, and the Soviet Union wrote to the Danish government accusing Olga and a Danish Catholic bishop of conspiracy against the <b>Soviet</b> <b>government.</b> The surviving Romanovs in Denmark grew fearful of an assassination or kidnap attempt, and Olga decided to move her family across the Atlantic to the relative safety of rural Canada.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} World War II, Pechersky {{returned}} to Rostov-on-Don, where he lived before the war, and started working as administrator in an Operetta theater. The mass murder of Jews at the Sobibor death camp {{became part of the}} charges against leading Nazis at the Nuremberg Trials. The International Tribunal at Nuremberg wanted to call Pechersky as a witness, but the <b>Soviet</b> <b>government</b> wouldn't allow him to travel to Germany to testify.|$|E
50|$|The {{ultimate}} {{collision of}} these divergent directions became inevitable. In 1925, {{a group of}} nationalistic revolutionaries applied to the Bureau to establish relationships with <b>Soviet</b> <b>governments</b> {{in order to try}} to find ways of helping the homeland. The leadership delayed the examination and response to this issue.|$|R
50|$|The Alexander Nevsky Cathedral {{remained}} the primary centre of Eastern Orthodox life in Azerbaijan {{in the early}} Soviet era, much to the <b>Soviet</b> <b>government's</b> displeasure. In the 1930s, the cathedral was ordered to be blown up with dynamite along with the Armenian Apostolic Saint Thaddeus and Bartholomew Cathedral.|$|R
50|$|The {{offensive}} in the Vistula River direction by {{the newly created}} Western Army had the aim of establishing similar <b>Soviet</b> <b>governments</b> in Belarus, Ukraine and Poland and to drive as far west as possible in order to join up with the German Revolution and to ignite the World revolution.|$|R
5|$|An award-winning {{documentary}} about the escape was made by Claude Lanzmann, entitled Sobibor, 14 Octobre 1943, 16 heures. The revolt was also dramatized in the 1987 British TV movie Escape from Sobibor, in which Rutger Hauer received a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Television) for his portrayal of Pechersky. Pechersky however {{did not attend the}} premiere of the movie; his widow later stated that the <b>Soviet</b> <b>government</b> denied him permission to travel to the United States.|$|E
5|$|Average wage {{rates in}} the Soviet Union were {{published}} relatively rarely. Some academics in the West believed this was because the <b>Soviet</b> <b>government</b> wanted to conceal low average earnings. Alec Nove wrote in 1966 (when wage statistics were published {{for the first time}} since the Second World War) that the lack of transparency surrounding average wages was intended to prevent Soviet workers from discovering the huge disparities that existed between wages in different sectors of the Soviet economy.|$|E
5|$|However, this outward {{dullness}} concealed a sharp {{mind and}} great administrative talent. He operated mainly {{behind the scenes}} and cultivated {{an image of a}} colourless bureaucrat – for example, he was the only Bolshevik leader who always wore a suit and tie. In 1928 Molotov replaced Nikolai Uglanov as First Secretary of the Moscow Communist Party and held that position until 15 August 1929. In a lengthy address to the Central Committee in 1929, Molotov told the members the <b>Soviet</b> <b>government</b> would initiate a compulsory collectivisation campaign to solve the agrarian backwardness of Soviet agriculture.|$|E
25|$|Yet, as the Mariinsky Ballet was {{preparing}} {{to go on a}} tour to Paris and London, Nureyev's rebellious character and a non-conformist attitude made him an unlikely candidate for a trip to the West, which was to be of crucial importance to the <b>Soviet</b> <b>government's</b> ambitions to portray their cultural supremacy.|$|R
5000|$|Samoylovich's {{linguistic}} and ethnographic {{studies of the}} Kazakh people are credited with leading {{to the creation of}} a scientific definition of the ethnonym [...] "Kazakh". He participated in the <b>Soviet</b> <b>government's</b> campaign to replace the Arabic-script-based writing systems used by Türkic peoples in the USSR with a uniform, Latin-based Turkic alphabet.|$|R
50|$|The group's {{goal was}} to monitor the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Government's</b> {{compliance}} with the Helsinki Accords, which ensure human rights. The {{members of the group}} based the group's legal viability on the provision in the Helsinki Final Act, Principle VII, which established the rights of individuals to know and act upon their rights and duties.|$|R
