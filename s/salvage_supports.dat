40|$|Salvage logging, {{the removal}} for profit of {{standing}} trees {{that have been}} damaged by extensive wildfires, has been quite controversial and subject to lawsuits that can delay the logging past the time in which the lumber is still useful.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} sequential composite bypasses with second generation glutaraldehyde stabilized human umbilical vein (HUV) and autologous vein. DesignRetrospective study of consecutive patients, in a single centre. PatientsFrom January 1998 to December 2003, 54 femoro-distal HUV-autologous vein sequential composite bypasses were constructed in 52 patients with critical leg ischemia and absence of sufficient length of autologous vein. MethodsAll infra-inguinal bypass operations were registered in a computerized database and prospectively followed. Bypasses using sequential HUV-composite technique were reviewed for graft patency, limb salvage and patient survival. ResultsPrimary patency and secondary patency rates at 1, 2, 3 and 4 years were 71, 61, 53 and 53 % and 89, 80, 73 and 67 %, respectively. Corresponding limb salvage rates were 96, 92, 88 and 88 %. Patient survival was 56 % at 4 years. After 30 days additional procedures to maintain graft patency were necessary in six bypasses. Asymptomatic occlusion of one sequential anastomosis was found in five patients.

40|$|Abstract Background Differential lung {{ventilation}} (DLV) {{is used to}} <b>salvage</b> ventilatory <b>support</b> in severe unilateral lung disease in the critical care setting. However, DLV with a double-lumen tube is associated with serious complications such as tube displacement during ventilatory management. Thus, long-term ventilatory management with this method {{may be associated with}} high risk of respiratory incidents in the critical care setting. Findings We devised a novel DLV technique using two single-lumen tubes and applied it to five patients, two with severe unilateral pneumonia and three with thoracic trauma, in a critical care setting. In this novel technique, we perform the usual tracheotomy and insert two single-lumen tubes under bronchoscopic guidance into the main bronchus of each lung. We tie the two single-lumen tubes together and suture them directly to the skin. The described technique was successfully performed in all five patients. Pulmonary oxygenation improved rapidly after DLV induction in all cases, and the three patients with thoracic trauma were managed by DLV without undergoing surgery. Tube displacement was not observed during DLV management. No airway complications occured in either the acute or late phase regardless of the length of DLV management (range 2 - 23 days). Conclusions This novel DLV technique appears to be efficacious and safe in the critical care setting. </p...|$|R
40|$|Streptomycetes {{sense and}} respond to the stress of {{phosphate}} starvation via the two-component PhoR-PhoP signal transduction system. To identify the in vivo targets of PhoP we have undertaken a chromatin-immunoprecipitation-on-microarray analysis of wild-type and phoP mutant cultures and, in parallel, have quantified their transcriptomes. Most (ca. 80 %) of the previously in vitro characterized PhoP targets were identified in this study among several hundred other putative novel PhoP targets. In addition to activating genes for phosphate scavenging systems PhoP was shown to target two gene clusters for cell wall/extracellular polymer biosynthesis. Furthermore PhoP was found to repress an unprecedented range of pathways upon entering phosphate limitation including nitrogen assimilation, oxidative phosphorylation, nucleotide biosynthesis and glycogen catabolism. Moreover, PhoP was shown to target many key genes involved in antibiotic production and morphological differentiation, including afsS, atrA, bldA, bldC, bldD, bldK, bldM, cdaR, cdgA, cdgB and scbR-scbA. Intriguingly, in the PhoP-dependent cpk polyketide gene cluster, PhoP accumulates substantially at three specific sites within the giant polyketide synthase-encoding genes. This study suggests that, following phosphate limitation, Streptomyces coelicolor PhoP functions as a 'master' regulator, suppressing central metabolism, secondary metabolism and developmental pathways until sufficient phosphate is <b>salvaged</b> to <b>support</b> further growth and, ultimately, morphological development...|$|R

Thresholds relate to the amount and quality of habitat essential for species persistence. Thresholds occur across scales according to species’ perceptions of the landscape, and can be induced by an accelerated rate of change.

40|$|Frequent {{new product}} {{releases}} pose significant challenges for firms as they manage successive generations of product diffusion. We develop an analytical model {{to study the}} effect of different purchase options by strategic consumers on a firm 2 ̆ 7 s profit and the firm 2 ̆ 7 s strategies for the timing and pricing of its successive generations of product diffusion. We show that consumers 2 ̆ 7 strategic behavior, although adversely affecting the sales of the first-generation product, positively influences the sales of the second-generation product through an initial “seeding” effect. The influence of strategic consumers on profit and sales depends largely on the discount-to-price ratio {{of the first generation}} relative to the performance improvement in the second generation. When the relative discount is small, the “seeding” effect on the second-generation product dominates. When the relative discount is large, the “cannibalization” effect on the first-generation product dominates. We further demonstrate that the optimal entry timings recommended in the literature (i. e., “now,” “maturity,” or “never”) can occur under different market conditions. In general, higher performance improvement and lower <b>salvage</b> value would <b>support</b> a higher optimal price, a larger discount, and a later introduction time. In addition, the firm can benefit from patient consumers when the performance improvement is relatively small, and it can induce the complete substitution of the later generation for the earlier generation when the performance improvement is relatively large. Overall, our model provides a theoretical foundation for understanding the effect of consumer strategic behavior on product diffusion, and our results offer important insights about firms 2 ̆ 7 multi-generation product diffusion strategies...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesWe {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of tranexamic acid in off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting surgery, either when used in combination with mechanical cell salvage or when used alone. MethodsOne hundred patients were randomized to either 2 g of tranexamic acid as an intravenous bolus before sternotomy or to placebo. Intraoperative and postoperative cell salvage was used in all patients. The primary end point was early postoperative blood loss (within 4 hours). To evaluate the efficacy of tranexamic acid in isolation, we also performed a meta-analysis of 4 randomized trials identified from a systematic literature search. The primary end point of the meta-analysis was red cell transfusion. ResultsIn our randomized trial patients in the tranexamic acid group had a significant reduction in early postoperative blood loss, (median difference, 50 mL; 95 % confidence interval, 15 - 100 mL; P <. 01); however, there was no reduction in the frequency of blood component transfusion. Patients in the placebo group received a significantly larger volume of autotransfused red cells (median difference, 120 mL; 95 % confidence interval, 0 - 220 mL; P =. 02). The meta-analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in red cell transfusions in patients receiving tranexamic acid compared with those receiving placebo (risk ratio, 0. 48; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 24 - 0. 97; P =. 041). There was also a reduction in the frequency of any allogeneic blood component transfusion, as well as a highly significant reduction in postoperative blood loss, in patients receiving tranexamic acid (P <. 001). ConclusionsTranexamic acid reduces blood loss and transfusion requirements in off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. A reduction in allogeneic blood transfusion was not evident in the presence of perioperative cell <b>salvage.</b> These data <b>support</b> the routine use of tranexamic acid in off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting surgery...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the importance of late infarct-related artery patency for recovery of left ventricular function and late survival after primary angioplasty for acute myocardial infarction. Background. Infarct-related artery patency is thought to improve late survival by its effect on preservation of left ventricular function. Patency may also enhance late survival by preventing left ventricular dilation and reducing arrhythmias, independent of myocardial salvage. However, most studies have not shown patency to be an independent predictor of survival when late left ventricular function is taken into account. Methods. We followed up 576 hospital survivors of acute myocardial infarction treated with primary angioplasty for 5. 3 years. Ejection fraction and infarct-related artery patency were determined at follow-up catheterization at 6 months. Predictors of late cardiac survival were determined using Cox regression models. Results. Patients with patent arteries had more improvement and a better late ejection fraction than patients with occluded arteries (56. 3 % vs. 47. 9 %, p = 0. 001). In patients with acute ejection fraction < 45 %, late survival was better in those with patent versus occluded arteries (89 % vs. 44 %, p = 0. 003), but patency was not a significant predictor after improvement in ejection fraction was taken into account. In patients with a large anterior infarction, patency was a significant independent predictor of late survival. Conclusions. Infarct-related artery patency is important for recovery of left ventricular function, and in patients with acute ejection fraction < 45 %, patency is important for late survival. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that the survival benefit is due primarily to the effect of patency on recovery of left ventricular function. In patients with a large anterior infarction, patency appears to provide an additional late survival benefit independent of myocardial <b>salvage.</b> These observations <b>support</b> the need for additional clinical trials of late reperfusion in patients with a large anterior infarction...|$|R
