40|$|Covert {{communication}} between sex offenders and their child victims was examined. It {{was expected that}} sex offenders would acknowledge covert methods of communicating to their child victims (1) "an intent to molest " and (2) "a warning of silence". Data were gathered in open ended, self report format from a known group of child sexual offenders. Examination of the data revealed {{that a significant number}} of the participants acknowledged the utilization of covert methods of communicating to their child victims that they intended to molest them. The data further indicated that while 50 % of the participants utilized overt methods of communicating a warning of silence to child victims, covert methods of communication were also used with significant frequency. The importance of the recognition of such covert communication is discussed in terms of protecting the child victim from post-disclosure revictimization; in the courtroom, in <b>supervised</b> or unsupervised <b>visitation,</b> and in reunification of the family.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between the Royal Visitation of 1535 — 1536, the Compendium Compertorum and the Suppression Act of 1536. Through the extensive examination of new and corrected manuscript evidence and by the updating of previous analysis, the Royal Visitation has been identified as more extensive, geographically and conceptually, than has hitherto been recognised. This work identifies for the first time all the Commissioners and their regions of responsibility in England and Wales. This discovery has enabled a thorough review of their visiting itineraries to be made and has allowed their actions to be examined relative to a central, emerging policy. The Royal Commissioners understood they had a reforming responsibility at the institutions they visited. This has not been previously recognised by historians who have seen the Royal Visitation as purely a means of collecting damaging evidence of monastic corruption. This work makes clear that the principal purpose of the Visitation, however, was to gain the wide acceptance of the Royal Supremacy among a range of ecclesiastical institutions, including religious houses. It will be shown that although Thomas Cromwell co-ordinated the Commissioners, he can occasionally be identified bending to the royal will. The emergence of the core Injunctions in August 1535, for example, was a result of King Henry's intervention. The Commissioners had occasional direct contact with the king to discuss the progress of the Visitation. This work identifies that the decision to widen the definition of sexual crime in the Visitation was made in September 1535, when the court was at Winchester. Thereafter, Cromwell can be seen considering various policies for possible monastic reform. On the eve of the passing of the Suppression Act Cromwell's chosen monastic reform policy was overruled. The Suppression Act in its final form was the preferred choice of King Henry. The data obtained on monastic crime was edited and manipulated from the Visitors' Act Book into the Compendium Compertorum to assist the passing of the Act. The Royal Visitation information was also used to evaluate the likely effects of the Act's implementation. This work outlines why the Crown invested seven months in undertaking the Royal Visitation. It helps explain the first assault in the 1530 s, by the government, on the English and Welsh monasteries. The widely held view that the Suppression Act was formulated by Cromwell must be revised. Cromwell certainly <b>supervised</b> the Royal <b>Visitation</b> but the king defined the final monastic suppression policy.

5000|$|Child visitation - {{the parent}} {{who does not}} have {{physical}} custody has either: a) reasonable rights of visitation, b) a specified visitation schedule, or c) is limited to <b>supervised</b> <b>visitation.</b> Only in very rare cases may the non-custodial parent be denied visitation. Usually, this is for very specific reasons such as severe substance abuse, history of domestic violence or lack of interest in the child.|$|E
5000|$|Most non{{custodial}} {{parents have}} visitation orders {{that allow the}} child to visit with them without any supervision, away from the custodial residence.

Meanwhile, Carly befriends the mysterious Jake Doe (Billy Miller) much to Sonny's dismay. Just as Michael begins to thaw toward his parents and relinquishes custody of Avery, Carly and Sonny become engaged. Meanwhile, Sonny and Carly realize Morgan is in trouble and fear he might be bipolar like Sonny. On their wedding day, Sonny gets shot hours before the wedding and ends up paralyzed. Ava takes custody of Avery and Carly wants to marry Sonny immediately hoping it will help in the custody case. Sonny nearly dies during their first attempt at wedding and they finally remarry on October 14, 2015 at General Hospital surrounded by their entire family. In November 2015 everyone realizes Jake Doe is actually Jason Morgan thanks to Carly, Sam and Spinelli and it is revealed at Elizabeth and Jason's wedding. Carly {{makes it to the}} courtroom for Avery's custody case and later explains to Sonny, Morgan, Michael, Ric and Kiki what happened unaware Kiki ran her off the road when she was drunk driving the prior night. Carly and Sonny are devastated when Ava gains custody of Avery but Sonny is allowed <b>supervised</b> <b>visitation,</b> Sonny kinda blames Carly at first. Carly tells Michael about Jason. Carly and Sonny talk about the courtroom hearing and she finally tells Sonny that Jason is alive, Jason comes in and they all discuss things. Carly tries to get Liz to back off Jason so he can see if he wants to be with her or Sam but to let him make his own decision, sparking an argument between the two. Jason confronts Carly on this and tells her to stay out of his and Liz's relationship. Carly is relieved when the truth comes out in December 2015 that Liz knew who Jason was since the Nurse's Ball because it meant Jason wasn't wrapped around her finger any more. On December 24, 2015 The Corinthos-Davis-Falconeri clan all gathered for the holidays and took a family picture. In January 2016 Carly and Sonny attended Robin and Patrick's second wedding as Robin and Carly actually finally put their differences aside and hugged, as Robin did give her credit for always being good for Jason and Sonny and Carly thanked her for saving Jason's life. Sonny's new doctor Mayes was quite rude to Carly and Sonny voiced himself on that but Carly wanted this to work out and told him it was fine and she had to head to the Metro Court. Carly often voices with Michael how angry she is that Sabrina lied about having his baby and to Morgan to make sure he took his bipolar medications.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine children's {{participation}} in court proceedings on <b>supervised</b> <b>visitation</b> and to analyse the descriptions of children in court verdicts. Eleven verdicts concerning <b>supervised</b> <b>visitation</b> resolved in 2014 were collected from two district courts in Stockholm County and studied with a qualitative textual analysis. The material was analysed with participation levels influenced by the ladder of participation for children developed by Roger Hart and with the theory of sociology of childhood. Our findings showed that children's opinions were mentioned in eight of the verdicts. In four verdicts the children's will influenced the courts decisions. The children’s will was in none of the verdicts determinant for the outcome. The children's level of participation had no correlation with their age. The children were often described as having universal needs rather than individual needs. The will of the children was in some verdicts invalidated by the court because of their age and their perceived lack of ability to understand what's best for them in the future. Our conclusions are that the court rarely described the children as independent actors or took the children's wishes into account. ...|$|E

40|$|During the Federal {{fiscal year}} of 2009, an {{estimated}} 3. 3 million referrals involving the alleged maltreatment of children were received by child protective service agencies across the United States. Of those cases that received further investigation, approximately 686, 400 children {{were placed in}} out-of-home care including foster and group facilities, according to the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services. Available research suggests that child welfare agencies provide parent training to assist parents in keeping their children {{at home or in}} achieving reunification in approximately 28 % of cases. However, the use of parent training programs for families in the child welfare system has received little examination, and no study has examined the use of such practices during <b>supervised</b> <b>visitation</b> time for parents who have lost custody of their child. The present study evaluated the effects of a behavioral parent training program, titled Microsocial Video Parenting (MVP), on the parenting behaviors of mothers who lost legal custody of their children and were receiving <b>supervised</b> <b>visitation</b> at the Department of Human Services. Participants in this study were 4 mother-child dyads, with the child participants ranging in age from 1 to 3 years old.

40|$|In this article, an {{overview}} of the key findings from the Children's Contact Services Project is presented. Children's Contact Services (CCSs) assist separated parents to manage contact arrangements with their children through the provision of <b>supervised</b> <b>visitation</b> and changeover services. The aims of this project were to investigate the use of CCSs in Australia by referring agencies (eg. courts and legal practitioners), and clients of contact services (parents and children), and to consider the views and expectations of these key stakeholders regarding those usages. This approach was {{based on the assumption that}} there are currently conflicting usages and expectations of contact services, and that this situation could compromise children's well-being. The findings were derived from two studies. The first study involved conducting 142 in-depth interviews with representatives from the Australian Government, the courts and legal practitioners who referred families to CCSs, CCS staff and management, as well as parents and children who used CCSs. The second study comprised a quantitative analysis of client data collected by CCS staff from 396 families who had used a government funded CCS in August 2003. The findings demonstrated that in Australia, CCSs provided an invaluable service that was viewed positively by government, referral agents, CCS staff and management, and by the parents and children who used them. Despite this generally positive view, there were conflicting expectations of CCSs that, under certain circumstances, compromised children's well-being and that of their parents, particularly their residence mothers. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{literature}} on sexual abuse suggests that {{child sexual abuse}} is very prevalent and that substantiating allegations of this sexual abuse {{is a very complex}} and difficult task. This task is carried out in the adversarial system in which two equal advocates best present their version of events to the judge or jury who will then sift out the truth. In some circumstances the truth cannot be determined and the allegations become unresolvable. As a result some families become entrenched in the legal system. Thus, the problem becomes one of how to get these families out of the adversarial legal system and, at the same time, reducing the risk of sexual abuse occurrences so the family can continue with their development. The most frequently used method today is the <b>supervised</b> <b>visitation</b> process which may keep children safe, but does not provide opportunities for the individuals involved to learn and experience new, healthier ways of relating. This paper proposed a, unique way of moving these families out of the legal system while reducing the risk of sexual abuse occurrences as these individuals learn new ways to be in relationship with each other. This was accomplished by redefining the problem from the narrow entrenched version of focusing on the alleged abuse to a broader more flexible version focusing on the developmental needs of the child. The program was evaluated by illuminating and understanding the subjective experience of the parents involved using the phenomenological research design of hermeneutics...|$|E
