5|$|After it is dissolved, osmium is {{separated}} from the other platinum group metals by distillation or extraction with organic solvents of the volatile osmium tetroxide. The first method {{is similar to the}} procedure used by Tennant and Wollaston. Both methods are suitable for industrial <b>scale</b> <b>production.</b> In either case, the product is reduced using hydrogen, yielding the metal as a powder or sponge that can be treated using powder metallurgy techniques.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, {{scientists}} from the United Kingdom, United States and Japan (Unit 731 of the imperial Japanese army) were involved in research into producing a biological weapon from smallpox. Plans of large <b>scale</b> <b>production</b> were never carried through as they considered that the weapon would not be very effective due to the wide-scale availability of a vaccine.|$|E
5|$|Hydrochloric acid is {{prepared}} by dissolving hydrogen chloride in water. Hydrogen chloride {{can be generated}} in many ways, and thus several precursors to hydrochloric acid exist. The large-scale production of hydrochloric acid is almost always integrated with the industrial <b>scale</b> <b>production</b> of other chemicals.|$|E

5|$|After the {{industrial}} <b>scale</b> <b>production</b> of cadmium {{started in the}} 1930s and 1940s, the major application of cadmium was the coating of iron and steel to prevent corrosion; in 1944, 62% and in 1956, 59% of the cadmium in the United States was used for plating. In 1956, 24% of the cadmium in the United States was used for a second application in red, orange and yellow pigments from sulfides and selenides of cadmium.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} two years, MacPherson, Hamister and Lauchlin M. Currie {{developed}} thermal purification techniques for the large <b>scale</b> <b>production</b> of low boron content graphite. The resulting product was designated AGOT graphite ("Acheson Graphite Ordinary Temperature") by National Carbon. With a neutron absorption cross section of 4.97 mbarns, the AGOT graphite is considered as the first true nuclear-grade graphite. By November 1942 National Carbon had shipped 255 tons of AGOT graphite to the University of Chicago, where it became {{the primary source of}} graphite {{to be used in the}} construction of Chicago Pile-1.|$|E
5|$|New {{economic}} forces also changed the Commonwealth. Virginian James Albert Bonsack invented the tobacco cigarette rolling machine in 1880 leading to new industrial <b>scale</b> <b>production</b> centered on Richmond. In 1886, railroad magnate Collis Potter Huntington founded Newport News Shipbuilding, which {{was responsible for}} building six major World War I-era battleships for the U.S. Navy from 1907 to 1923. During the war, German submarines like U-151 attacked ships outside the port. In 1926, Dr. W.A.R. Goodwin, rector of Williamsburg's Bruton Parish Church, began restoration of colonial-era buildings in the historic district with financial backing of John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Though their project, like others in the state, {{had to contend with}} the Great Depression and World War II, work continued as Colonial Williamsburg became a major tourist attraction.|$|E

5|$|The large <b>scale</b> <b>production</b> of {{ice cream}} also {{resulted}} from the ice trade. Ice cream had been produced in small quantities {{since at least the}} 17th century, but this depended both on having large quantities of ice available, and substantial amounts of labour to manufacture it. This was because using ice to freeze ice cream relies both on the application of salt to an ice mixture to produce a cooling effect, and also on constantly agitating the mixture to produce the light texture associated with ice cream. By the 1820s and 1830s, the availability of ice in the cities of the U.S. east coast meant that ice cream was becoming increasingly popular, but still an essentially luxury product. In 1843, however, a new ice cream maker was patented by Nancy Johnson which required far less physical effort and time; similar designs were also produced in England and France. Combined with the growing ice trade, ice cream became much more widely available and consumed in greater quantities. In Britain, Norwegian ice was used by the growing Italian community in London from the 1850s onwards to popularise ice cream with the general public.|$|E

It {{is estimated that}} Colombia has more than 15 large national brands (the most popular listed below); but dozens of small/local microbrewery boutique beers are growing beyond regional demand.|$|R
25|$|Non-viral methods present certain {{advantages}} over viral methods, such as large <b>scale</b> <b>production</b> and low host immunogenicity. However, non-viral methods initially produced {{lower levels of}} transfection and gene expression, and thus lower therapeutic efficacy. Later technology remedied this deficiency.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} {{many types of}} beers brewed in Cornwall– those {{produced}} by Sharp's Brewery, Skinner's Brewery, Keltek Brewery and St Austell Brewery are the best-known – including stouts, ales and other beer types.

50|$|The 1,400 seat Milton Keynes theatre/concert hall has {{an unusual}} feature: the ceiling can be lowered closing off the third tier (gallery) {{to create a}} more {{intimate}} space for smaller <b>scale</b> <b>productions.</b> It is the most successful regional theatre in the UK outside of London and operated by the Ambassador Theatre Group.|$|R
25|$|Methyl {{isocyanate}} {{is usually}} manufactured by {{the reaction of}} monomethylamine and phosgene. For large <b>scale</b> <b>production,</b> it is advantageous to combine these reactants at higher temperature in the gas phase. A mixture of methyl isocyanate and two moles of hydrogen chloride is formed, but N-methylcarbamoyl chloride (MCC) forms as the mixture is condensed, leaving one mole of hydrogen chloride as a gas.|$|E
25|$|From the {{beginning}} of the first millennium, the network appears to collapse, possibly because the Iron Age had outdated the Atlantic tin and bronze products in the Mediterranean region, and the large <b>scale</b> <b>production</b> of metallic items was reduced to the elaboration of axes and tools, which are still found buried in very large quantities all along the European Atlantic coast.|$|E
25|$|Chemical {{engineering}} {{developed in}} the late nineteenth century. Industrial scale manufacturing demanded new materials and new processes and by 1880 the need for large <b>scale</b> <b>production</b> of chemicals was such that a new industry was created, dedicated to the development and large scale manufacturing of chemicals in new industrial plants. The role of the chemical engineer was the design of these chemical plants and processes.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: An econometric {{analysis}} of cost-scale relationship in three provinces (North Khorasan, Khorasan Razavi and South Khorasan) in Iran, using plant-level {{data for the}} year 2003 is presented. Non-capital cost function with homotheticity hypothesis was used. The results showed that there were constant returns to <b>scale</b> in <b>production</b> of Cotton, Barley and Wheat, but decreasing returns to scale in Sugar Beet production. Also, {{the results showed that}} there were constant returns to <b>scale</b> in <b>production</b> of these crops in North Khorasan and Khorasan Razavi, but decreasing returns to <b>scale</b> in <b>production</b> of them in South Khorasan...|$|R

25|$|Balancing costs: to {{maintain}} grid stability, some additional costs may be incurred for balancing of load with demand. The {{ability of the}} grid to balance supply with demand {{will depend on the}} rate of change of the amount of energy produced (by wind, for example) and the ability of other sources to ramp production up or <b>scale</b> <b>production</b> down. Balancing costs have generally been found to be low.|$|E
25|$|Since the 202 {{never made}} large <b>scale</b> <b>production</b> {{and all the}} cars were handmade, the small talented group at Cisitalia, {{including}} Carlo Abarth, Dante Giacosa and Giovanni Savonuzzi, made several variants of the 202. Of the more important versions, the SMM Nuvolari Spider was built and named after a class victory at the 1947 Mille Miglia by famed driver Tazio Nuvolari. It is easily identified by its large rear fins, twin windscreens and usual Italian blood red paint scheme.|$|E
25|$|Lactic acid is {{produced}} industrially by bacterial fermentation of carbohydrates (sugar, starch) or by chemical synthesis from acetaldehyde, {{that is available}} from coal or crude oil. In 2009 lactic acid was produced predominantly (70-90%) by fermentation. Production of racemic lactic acid consisting of a 1:1 mixture of D and L stereoisomers, or of mixtures with up to 99.9% L-lactic acid, is possible by microbial fermentation. Industrial <b>scale</b> <b>production</b> of D-lactic acid by fermentation is possible, but much more challenging.|$|E
