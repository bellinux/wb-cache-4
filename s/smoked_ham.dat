The name itself was virtually turned into a common noun (un moș teacă), applied to army men who are thought to display the same characteristics as Bacalbașa's anti-hero. In Romanian cuisine, the writer's name was given to a delicatessen variety of <b>smoked</b> <b>ham.</b>|$|E

500|$|The {{dedication}} {{is followed}} by a detailed inventory of food items, kitchenware, as well as kitchen and waiting staff, necessary for hosting a banquet. The list of food items begins with meats of farm animals and game, including sundry game birds, from snow bunting to great bustard. Different kinds of cereals and pasta are followed by an enumeration of fruits and mushrooms which may be either fresh or dried. The list of vegetables includes, now largely forgotten, cardoon, Jerusalem artichoke and turnip-rooted chervil, or popie jajka (literally, [...] "priest's balls"), as Czerniecki calls it. Under the heading of [...] "spices" [...] come not only saffron, black pepper, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, mace and cumin, all of which were used abundantly in Czerniecki's cookery, but also powdered sugar, rice, [...] "large" [...] and [...] "small" [...] raisins, citrus fruits such as lemons, limes and oranges, and even <b>smoked</b> <b>ham</b> and smoked beef tongue, which were also used as seasonings.|$|E

He was courteous, however, and offered Halbert {{a share of the}} provisions which he carried about him for refreshment. They were of the coarsest kind--oat-bread baked in cakes, oatmeal slaked with cold water, an onion or two, and a morsel of <b>smoked</b> <b>ham</b> completed the feast. But such as it was, no Scotsman of the time, had his rank been much higher than that of Glendinning, would have refused to share in it, especially as the pedlar produced, with a mysterious air, a tup's horn, which he carried slung from his shoulders, and which, when its contents were examined, produced to each party a clam-shell-full of excellent usquebaugh--a liquor strange to Halbert, for the strong waters known in the south of Scotland came from France, and in fact such were but rarely used. The pedlar recommended it as excellent, said he had procured it in his last visit to the braes of Doune, where he had securely traded under the safe-conduct of the Laird of Buchanan. He also set an example to Halbert, by devoutly emptying the cup [...] "to the speedy downfall of Anti-Christ." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} dietary supplementation with {{antioxidant}} mixture in medium-heavy swine on oxidative status, nutritional and sensory characteristics of longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle and <b>smoked</b> cured <b>ham</b> were evaluated. Seventy-four pigs (PIC x Max Grow), {{were assigned to}} two experimental groups: control (CT) and treated supplemented with antioxidant mixture (AOX) for 45 days before slaughter. The total antiradicalic activity of blood (KRL test) and carcass dressing percentage was positively affected (P< 0. 05) by AOX supplementation. Chemical composition of LD was not affected by dietary treatment. Oxidative stability and colour indices were significantly affected (P< 0. 05) by dietary treatment and storage time (0, 6, 12, 15 days under modified atmosphere packs- MAP). Sensory analysis revealed that at 12 and 15 days of storage a loss of colour beside presence of off odors was higher (P< 0. 05) in CT than AOX group. The seasoning losses of <b>smoked</b> cured <b>ham</b> tended to be lower (P= 0. 06) in AOX group than CT. Physical and chemical composition was not affected by dietary treatment. Sensory analysis revealed a difference between CT and AOX (P< 0. 05) in salty and sweet taste. Furthermore, the consumer test revealed that <b>smoked</b> cured <b>ham</b> from AOX were preferred (P< 0. 05) than CT.

Dubbing over Junior's use of the terms [...] "fuckface" [...] and [...] "pussy whipped" [...] got the film a PG-13 rating on appeal, but the studio was still so nervous that, at the last minute, they added the Woody Woodpecker cartoon <b>Smoked</b> <b>Hams</b> to the film's theatrical release, to reassure parents that the film was suitable for children.|$|R
50|$|The festival {{began in}} 1962 {{in front of}} the Pletcher Furniture Village in {{downtown}} Nappanee as part of a sidewalk days celebration. Watercolors painted by local students in the park department's summer arts program were hung on clotheslines between the pilars of the store. The event quickly grew to include artists and craftsmen displaying and selling their wares in booths. The event soon spread to several blocks and alleys surrounding the furniture store. Visitors soon demanded Amish-related products including <b>smoked</b> <b>hams,</b> jams, jellies, and baked goods. A converted school bus was used to tour the surrounding countryside. The Pletcher family founded Amish Acres in 1968 partly from this market study in miniature. The festival was moved to the historic farm in 1971 and rapidly expanded to surround the farm's pond.|$|R
