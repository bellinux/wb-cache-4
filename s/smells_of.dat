5|$|The {{coconut crab}} has a {{well-developed}} sense of smell, which it uses to locate its food. The process of smelling works very differently {{depending on whether}} the smelled molecules are hydrophilic molecules in water or hydrophobic molecules in air. As most crabs live in the water, they have specialised organs called s on their antennae to determine both the concentration and the direction of a smell. However, as coconut crabs live on the land, the aesthetascs on their antennae are shorter and blunter than those of other crabs and look more like those of insects. While insects and the coconut crab originate from different paths, the same need to detect smells in the air {{led to the development of}} remarkably similar organs. Coconut crabs flick their antennae as insects do to enhance their reception. They have an excellent sense of smell and can detect interesting odours over large distances. The <b>smells</b> <b>of</b> rotting meat, bananas, and coconuts, all potential food sources, catch their attention especially. Research has shown that the olfactory system in the coconut crab's brain is well-developed compared to other areas of the brain.|$|E

25|$|Chandogya Upanishad, {{in chapter}} 1.2, {{describes}} {{the battle between}} Devas and Asuras on various sensory powers. This battle {{between good and evil}} fails to produce a victor and simply manifests itself in the perceived universe, as good or evil sights witnessed by beings, as good or evil words shared between people, as good or evil <b>smells</b> <b>of</b> nature, as good or evil feelings experienced, as good or evil thoughts within each person. Finally, the Deva-Asura battle targets the soul, where Asuras fail and Devas succeed, because soul-force is serene and inherently good, asserts Chandogya Upanishad.|$|E

25|$|This chapter {{begins with}} a {{detailed}} description of the exquisitely decorated drawing room where the Salina family recites their daily rosary. Afterwards, the Prince wanders out into the garden, where the sickly, over-ripe <b>smells</b> <b>of</b> lush foliage threaten to overwhelm him with memories—specifically, of a dead Neapolitan soldier who, in his last moments, had clawed his way into the lemon grove and died there, guts spilled. Perturbed by these thoughts, the Prince takes refuge in watching his dog, Bendicò, joyfully dig up the garden, and in thoughts about the behavior of his wayward nephew, Prince Tancredi Falconeri.|$|E
25|$|Accelerated {{low-water}} corrosion (ALWC) is {{a particularly}} aggressive form of MIC that affects steel piles in seawater near the low water tide mark. It is characterized by an orange sludge, which <b>smells</b> <b>of</b> hydrogen sulfide when treated with acid. Corrosion rates can be very high and design corrosion allowances can soon be exceeded leading to premature failure of the steel pile. Piles that have been coated and have cathodic protection installed {{at the time of}} construction are not susceptible to ALWC. For unprotected piles, sacrificial anodes can be installed locally to the affected areas to inhibit the corrosion or a complete retrofitted sacrificial anode system can be installed. Affected areas can also be treated using cathodic protection, using either sacrificial anodes or applying current to an inert anode to produce a calcareous deposit, which will help shield the metal from further attack.|$|E
25|$|The Guinness Storehouse is {{a popular}} tourist {{attraction}} at St. James's Gate Brewery in Dublin, where a self-guided tour includes {{an account of the}} ingredients used to make the stout and a description of how it is made.

500|$|Russula parvovirescens, {{found in}} the eastern United States, can be {{distinguished}} from R.virescens by its smaller stature, with caps measuring [...] wide and stipe up to [...] long by [...] thick.

Microscopically, the terminal cells in the cap cuticle of R.parvovirescens are more swollen than those of R.virescens, which has tapered and elongated terminal cells. Another green-capped Russula is R.aeruginea, but this species may be distinguished from R.virescens by its smaller size and smooth cap. Other green russulas with a smooth cap include R.heterophylla and R.cyanoxantha var. peltereaui. Russula crustosa, like R.virescens, also has an areolate cap, but the cap becomes sticky (viscid) when moist, and its color is more variable, as it may be reddish, yellowish, or brown. Also, the spore print of R.crustosa is a darker yellow than R.virescens. R.redolens has a cap that is [...] "drab-green to blue-green", but unlike R.virescens, is smooth.
