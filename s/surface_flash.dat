40|$|Abstract: The {{previously}} proposed {{model for}} the surface-flash phenomenon is modified {{to account for the}} influence of nap thickness and the dependence of reaction rate on fuel concentration. As before, the model is an extension of ordinary premixed-flame theory and considers heat loss to the surrounding environment and fiber pyrolysis. The activation-energy-asymptotics technique is applied to obtain an asymptotic analytical solution of the model. The model predicts the existence of the critical nap thickness and the critical nap density for the occurrence of <b>surface</b> <b>flash.</b> It also shows that the <b>surface</b> <b>flash</b> velocity significantly depends on the nap density but only weakly on the nap thickness.

30|$|The {{material}} being welded experiences {{very hot}} processing conditions as the tool pin rotates {{at very high}} speeds. Therefore, excessive heat generated, thermally softens the material near the boundary of the tool-shoulder and expels large volumes of material {{in the form of}} <b>surface</b> <b>flash.</b> Excessive tool-shoulder frictional heat softening of the material is the reason for the formation of the flash, and high tool-shoulder pressure leads to the ejection of an excessive amount of flash (Bo et al. 2011). Incorrect tool pin length relative to workpiece thickness and change in penetration depth due to variation in plate thickness along the weld line or due to a bowed plate can lead to a lack of penetration. When the pin plug depth is high, the plastic material near the pin is extruded, which results in weld flash. When the pin depth is very high, extruded flash can occur at the roots of the weld, near the pin. At larger tool tilt angles, insufficient plasticised material remains to fill the cavity left in the weld nugget and weld flash appears on the retreating side (Keivani et al. 2013).|$|E

Scuffing {{is a form of}} surface damage and wear that occurs in inadequately-lubricated tribosystems that causes catastrophic damage on tribological surfaces and usually results in the need for part replacement. As a major cause of failure in automotive and other mechanical components, scuffing {{has been the focus of}} much research to elucidate its fundamental underpinnings. One of the characteristics of scuffing is an increase in the coefficient of friction and in the surface temperature of the contacting parts. In this paper, we report on ongoing numerical work focused on modeling the transient temperature rise that occurs in a workpiece during a ball-on-disk tribometer test. In such a test, a load is applied to a stationary ball which is placed in contact with a rotating disk. Inputs to the numerical thermal model come from experimental and numerical contact mechanics tests.

Newer units may be broadly classified as follows: (a) wellhead units of less than 5 MW; (b) small plants of about 10 MW; (c) medium plants of 30 - 35 MW; (d) large plants of about 55 MW; and (e) complexes typically consisting of several 55 MW units in a large geothermal field. There is a trend toward turbine units of the double-flow type with a 55 MW rating, used either alone or in a tandem-compound arrangement giving 110 MW in a single power house.

The high voltage pulse power system constitutes a number of composite dielectric interfaces like the solidliquid, solid-gas and solid-vacuum interface. However <b>surface</b> <b>flash</b> over along the gas- solid interface in pressurized spark gaps and in support insulators {{is a major problem}} in the operation of the high voltage pulse power systems. Further an efficient design of spacer is required in order to achieve higher spacer efficiency and also minimize the problem of surface flashover.

The work involves the study of discharge characteristics by varying insulator geometries to optimize the insulator geometry with maximum spacer efficiency and the effect of spacer surface protrusions on spacer efficiency. The maximum efficiency of 97 % has been achieved for negative angled and bushbar spacers [2].

40|$|The Salton Sea reservoir, {{located in}} Imperial County, Ca., {{is unique in}} several ways from most liquid-dominated {{geothermal}} reservoirs {{that have been developed}} to date. One of these differences is the presence of hyper-saline brines containing up to 28 % TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) and up to 0. 2 % NCG (Non-Condensible Gas). A simple material and energy balance model has been developed to study the effect of TDS and NCG on Salton Sea reservoir response. This study demonstrated that during the development of a two-phase system the partitioning of the NCG into the vapor phase and the consequential concentration of the TDS in the brine drastically alters the reservoir fluid properties. In modeling pressure depletion of hyper-saline reservoirs, such as the Salton Sea, these changes in reservoir fluid composition were shown to seriously affect the simulation results. As a result of these findings, a compositional fluid property package was developed using published data on H{sub 2 }O-CO{sub 2 }-NaCl mixtures. This fluid property package was then incorporated into the simulation program used by Unocal. Validation of the fluid property package in this simulation program was made using measured reservoir temperature, surface enthalpy, and <b>surface</b> <b>flash</b> data. The development of a compositional simulation program for geothermal applications has advanced our ability to study depletion mechanisms that are sensitive to compositional changes.

40|$|There are two {{principal}} concerns {{that govern the}} use of lubricants in NIF: (1) Airborne molecular contaminants (AMCs) [...] AMCs are known to seriously degrade the performance of sol-gel coated optics. AMCs are produced by the slow outgassing of residues (non-volatile residues or ''NVRs'') of high molecular weight compounds left on surfaces. Lubricants, particularly hydrocarbon lubricants, are a primary source of such NVRs. (2) Particulates [...] Particulates that accumulate on optical surfaces can cause permanent physical damage when exposed to high energy density laser light. Lubricant residues exposed to high energy density light will pyrolyze or decompose and produce carbon particulates. The NIF Approved Materials Database lists several lubricants that have been tested for use in NIF environments. Many of these lubricants were tested according to MELs 99 - 006 (oven outgassing test) or 99 - 007 (vacuum outgassing test). In these tests, the change in percent transmission of light through a sol-gel coated optic placed next to the sample under evaluation is used as the diagnostic. Samples that cause less than 0. 1 % change in optical transmission are deemed suitable for use inside beam enclosures. This testing, however, addresses only the concern associated with AMCs. To assess the issue of particle generation, a flashlamp or ''aerosol'' test is used. In this test a sample with residues is subjected to intense light from the main amplifier flashlamps. The number density of particles per unit volume is measure after each flash.

40|$|The {{work done}} in {{overcoming}} frictional resistance between sliding surfaces is transformed into heat at the separate, very small and very highly loaded asperity contacts {{that make up the}} real area of contact. The temperatures at these initial asperity contacts (the ‘flash temperatures’) are usually much higher than the bulk temperatures and,although of very short duration, can cause potentially major local changes at the surfaces, such as softening, chemical transformations, and local melting. A new approach to calculating these flash temperatures is presented, which relies on the solution, by finite-element analysis, of the threedimensional equation for transient heat flow in an hemispherical asperity. A Design of Experiments (DoE) exercise showed that the major influential factors on flash temperature were the thermal conductivity, the product of friction coefficient and hardness, the velocity of sliding, and the radius and degree of wear/flattening of the hemisphere.
