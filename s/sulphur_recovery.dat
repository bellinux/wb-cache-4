40|$|Dithiocarbonates (xanthates) {{have been}} the most widely used {{collectors}} in sulphide mineral flotation. More recently, research has resulted in the use of trithiocarbonate (TTC) collectors. The present study focuses on the effect of mixtures of C 12 trithiocarbonate (C 12 TTC) and sodium iso-butyl xanthate (SIBX) in the flotation of auriferous pyrite and the associated gold and uranium from cyanidation tailings. Improved gold and uranium flotation responses were observed with collector mixtures than with SIBX alone. <b>Sulphur</b> <b>recoveries</b> were not affected. Mineralogical analysis of flotation concentrates showed that gold and uranium were also hosted by kerogen.

40|$|Two {{batches of}} ore, A and B, from the {{reclaimed}} dumps of ERGO Ltd on the East Witwatersrand {{were used to}} investigate the effect of design parameters on the flotation of pyrite in an air-sparged hydrocyclone (ASH). In the ASH, air is sparged radially through a porous cylinder and dispersed by the high velocity of slurry in swirl flow, countercurrent to the froth phase rising axially in {{the centre of the}} cylinder. The concentrate overflows through the vortex finder, while the tailings flow downward. A spigot where flow is restricted by a horizontal baffle, positioned 30 mm above the orifice, proved to be more successful than a spigot consisting of an annular opening between a pedestal and the cylindrical wall, and a flow restricting orifice below. Pyrite from both samples A and B was difficult to float efficiently. Sample A, which contained only 0. 14 %S, yielded typical <b>sulphur</b> <b>recoveries</b> of 40 % and associated grades of 4 %S in the ASH, while batch flotation yielded recoveries of 65 % and grades of 11 %S. The corresponding results for Sample B with a head grade of 1. 42 %S, were 40 % and 7. 5 %S in the ASH, and 56 % and 6 %S in batch tests. From a variety of runs, it can be concluded that flotation in the ASH is influenced mainly by the tangential velocity and the hold-up of slurry. Hence, the effective design of an ASH is critically dependent on the dimensions of the cylinder, vortex finder and the spigot. For some ASH designs, flotation performance could be improved noticeably by sealing off {{the lower part of the}} porous cylinder. © 1990. Articl...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{geological}} and mineralogical {{characteristics as}} well as the metallurgical (flotation) response of mineralized footwall to the Brakspruit facies-type of Merensky Reef at the K 3 shaft in the vicinity of Karee Mine, at Lonmin PLC, was investigated. The grade in the footwall is above the cut-off grade. The nature of this style of mineralisation is poorly understood, resulting in complete lack of predictive capability when dealing with the processing behaviour of this ore type (i. e. footwall). This project therefore aims to investigate the footwall ore properties (such as mineralogy, mineral liberation upon milling and mineral grain size distribution) that influence the platinum group elements (PGE) {{as well as}} nickel, copper and <b>sulphur</b> <b>recoveries</b> and grades. Thereafter it compares such properties to those of the overlying Brakspruit facies-type of Merensky Reef. This study has been accomplished by petrographic examination of the ore types, quantitative and qualitative mineralogical analysis using the Mineral Liberation Analyser (MLA), crushing and milling tests, as well as laboratory scale flotation tests on the ore types. Two boreholes, RS 34 Deflection 5 and Deflection 6 comprising mineralized footwall and the overlying Brakspruit facies-type of Merensky Reef were selected, primarily to investigate the petrographic nature (texture, mineralogy and geology) of the footwall and Brakspruit facies-type of Merensky Reef. This was then followed by underground sampling at the K 3 shaft, {{in the vicinity of the}} Karee mine, where a total of five channel samples were taken, each comprising 10 cm individual subsamples covering footwall {{as well as the}} Brakspruit facies-type of Merensky Reef. The underground channel samples were primarily used for milling and flotation tests work. Various geological and metallurgical parameters of footwall such as mineralogy, grain size distribution, liberation upon milling, and flotation response, were determined and compared to geological and metallurgical parameters of the overlying Brakspruit facies-type of Merensky Reef. Footwall consists predominantly of plagioclase; whereas, Brakspruit facies-type of Merensky Reef comprises predominantly orthopyroxene.

40|$|This project {{investigates the}} {{optimisation}} of platinum-group metals recovery at the Mimosa Mine in Zimbabwe. The {{first part of}} this research investigates how collector performance can be improved by using collector combinations (mixtures) of the standard sodium iso-butyl xanthate with a secondary collector. The synergistic effect of the sodium-iso-butyl-xanthate (SIBX) combined with trithiocarbonates (TTCs) or dithiophosphates (DTP) was investigated. The short chain and the long chain TTCs were investigated. These collector combinations were studied at various molar percent ratios. The SIBX:DTP combination was studied at a 1 : 1 mass ratio or molar ratio of 1 : 1. 3. Amongst all the collector combinations, it was established that the SIBX/DTP combination improved <b>sulphur</b> <b>recoveries</b> by 10 % and subsequently the PGE+Au recovery by 10 % compared to when the SIBX was used on its own. The C 4 -TTC showed poor performance in the sulphur recovery; however an improvement in PGE + Au recovery was noticeable. There was generally no significant metallurgical improvement with respect to final grades and recoveries with C 10 and C 12 TTC mixtures with SIBX. However, the 6. 25 molar per cent substitution of SIBX by C 12 TTC appeared to show some improvement on sulphur but not on PGM+Au recovery and grade. It was therefore concluded that the SIBX/DTP combination at 1 : 1 mass ratio (total moles of 0. 64) showed a potential to improve the grades and recoveries of the Mimosa Mine. The Mimosa ore is characterised by an unusually large amount of talc, which often causes problems during the flotation of the PGM minerals {{due to the fact that}} talc consumes high amount of reagents. Therefore the purpose of the second part of this thesis was to investigate the possibility of removing talc prior to the flotation process by de-sliming. Two cyclones (36. 9 mm and 76. 0 mm) were used for de-sliming the flotation feed. De-sliming the ore was able to reduce the depressant dosage up to 300 g/t as opposed to 500 g/t that is used at Mimosa Mine. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2008.

40|$|The Cretaceous–Paleogene (K–Pg) mass {{extinction}} event occurred 66 million years ago, {{the most recent}} of the ‘Big Five’ extinction crises of the last 540 million years. This event {{had a profound effect}} on both life and the broader Earth system, with the extinction of up to 75 % of life. Despite years of detailed research, debate continues as to the nature and timing of the extinction. Ideas for an abrupt crisis, triggered by bolide impact at Chicxulub in the Gulf of Mexico, contrast with those suggesting a more gradual extinction, involving volcanism from the Deccan Traps Large Igneous Province in India and/or climatic changes. Evidence from the high latitudes has been used to suggest that the fossil record from Antarctica is incompatible with models for a single, sudden event, and that extinction intensity declined at high latitudes. This thesis presents a detailed study of extensive fossil and sediment collections from the highest southern latitude onshore outcrop containing the K–Pg transition; the highly expanded and fossiliferous López de Bertodano Formation of Seymour Island, James Ross Basin, located at 65 °S today, and during the Cretaceous. New biostratigraphic and diversity data for the molluscan (bivalves, gastropods, cephalopods) faunas of the López de Bertodano Formation, and geochemical datasets (seawater sulphur and pyrite sulphur isotopes) are compared to published records, and evidence for palaeoenvironmental change. They suggest a single, rapid extinction event coincident with the K–Pg boundary, with no precursor decline. The magnitude of the extinction in Antarctica is also consistent with lower latitudes, suggestive of a global, catastrophic trigger for the K–Pg extinction, such as bolide impact. Sulphur isotope data suggest the K–Pg sulphur cycle was able to respond to rapid environmental changes before, and after the K–Pg {{mass extinction}}.

The first topic analyses the current situation with oil pollution of soils and water surfaces in Russia and {{presents the results of}} field bioremediation trials on the basis of recently developed biopreparation “Rhoder”. The second topic discusses the recent findings aiming to extend an applicability of anaerobic wastewater treatment at temperatures as low as 4 – 10 ◦ C. A performance of novel anaerobic-aerobic hybrid reactor is analysed in the third topic with regard to treatment of recalcitrant azo dye wastewater. The latter 2 topics lye within a conventional function of environmental biotechnology (so-called “end of pipe treatment”) while the fourth topic dealing with the development of biocatalytical technology of H 2 S removal and <b>sulphur</b> <b>recovery</b> from polluted gases highlights a transformation of this discipline into a new phase substantially contributing to resource conservation and sustainable production in the modern society...|$|E
