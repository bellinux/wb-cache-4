5|$|Athena reappears, {{demanding}} that Kratos return {{what she thinks}} he took from Pandora's Box.

Athena realizes that when Kratos opened the box to defeat Ares, the evils escaped and infected the gods while Kratos was imbued with hope, which enabled him to kill Ares. She tells Kratos to return her power, <b>saying</b> that she knows how to use it to rebuild the world. Distrusting Athena and tired of being used as a pawn, Kratos refuses; <b>saying</b> his vengeance has ended, he impales himself with the Blade of Olympus and releases hope for the world so that it can heal. An angry Athena pulls the sword from him, <b>saying</b> that he has disappointed her and leaves empty-handed. Near death, Kratos collapses as Athena leaves.|$|E
