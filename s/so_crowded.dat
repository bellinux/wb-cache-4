5|$|Haywood {{observed}} {{how the government}} frequently took the side of business to defeat the tactics and the aspirations of the miners. During an 1899 organizing drive in Coeur d'Alene, with pay cuts as a motivating issue, the company hired spies and then fired organizers and pro-union miners. Some frustrated miners responded with violence and when two men were killed, martial law was declared. As they had done in a strike in Coeur d'Alene seven years earlier, soldiers acted as strike breakers. They rounded up hundreds of union members without formal charges {{and put them in}} a filthy, vermin-infested warehouse without sanitation services for a year. They were <b>so</b> <b>crowded</b> that the soldiers locked the overflow of prisoners in boxcars. One local union leader was imprisoned for 17 years.|$|E
5|$|One day, the Philistine leaders {{assemble}} in {{a temple}} for a religious sacrifice to Dagon, {{one of their}} most important deities, for having delivered Samson into their hands. They summon Samson so that people can watch him perform for them. The temple is <b>so</b> <b>crowded</b> that people are even climbing onto the roof to watch—and all the rulers of the entire government of Philistia have gathered there too, some 3,000 people in all. Samson is led into the temple, and he asks his captors to let him lean against the supporting pillars to rest. He prays for strength and God gives him strength to break the pillars, causing the temple to collapse, killing him and the people inside.|$|E
5|$|The {{first eight}} staff arrived in Montreal {{at the end}} of 1942. These were Goldschmidt and Pierre Auger from France, George Placzek from Czechoslovakia, S. G. Bauer from Switzerland, Friedrich Paneth and Halban from Austria, and R. E. Newell and F. R. Jackson from Britain. The Battle of the Atlantic was still raging, and men and equipment, which {{travelled}} separately, were at risk from German U-boats. The scientists occupied a house at 3470 Simpson Street in downtown Montreal that belonged to McGill University. This soon became <b>so</b> <b>crowded</b> that bathrooms were used for offices, with the bath tubs used to store papers and books. They were relieved to move to the more spacious accommodation at the Université de Montréal in March. The laboratory grew to over 300 staff, about half of whom were Canadians recruited by Laurence.|$|E

25|$|The Vikings {{conducted}} extensive raids in Ireland {{and founded}} many towns, including Dublin, Limerick, Wexford, Waterford, Wicklow, Arklow and Leixlip. Literature, crafts, and decorative styles in Ireland and Britain reflected Scandinavian culture. Vikings traded at Irish markets in Dublin. Excavations found imported fabrics from England, Byzantium, Persia, and central Asia. Dublin became <b>so</b> <b>crowded</b> by the 11th century that houses were built {{outside the town}} walls.|$|E
25|$|Civil {{inattention}} {{is defined}} as the polite way to manage interaction with strangers by not engaging in any interpersonal communication or needing to respond to a stranger’s touch. Goffman uses an elevator study to explain this phenomenon. It is uncommon for people to look at, talk to, or touch the person next to them. While it may be <b>so</b> <b>crowded</b> that they 'touch' another person, they will often maintain an expressionless demeanor so not to affect those around them.|$|E
25|$|During {{the next}} few weeks, more B-57Bs were moved from Clark AB to Bien Hoa to make good these losses and to {{reinforce}} the original deployment. The B-57s shared an open-air, three-sided hangar with the Vietnamese Air Force that flew A-1E Skyraider aircraft, and things got <b>so</b> <b>crowded</b> at Bien Hoa {{at that time that}} some of the B-57s had to be sent back to Clark AB. Also, maintenance facilities for the B-57 at Bien Hoa were scarce.|$|E

Then, when Little John stood against the tree, he drew Guy of Gisbourne's sharp, {{double-edged}} dagger. [...] "Fall back! fall back!" [...] cried he. [...] "Would ye <b>crowd</b> <b>so</b> on my pleasure, ye unmannerly knaves? Back, I say! Farther yet!" [...] <b>So</b> they <b>crowded</b> back, as he ordered, many of them turning their faces away, {{that they might not}} see what was about to happen.|$|R
25|$|During peak hours, {{stations}} can get <b>so</b> <b>crowded</b> {{that they}} need to be closed. Passengers may not get on the first train and the majority of passengers do not find a seat on their trains, some trains having more than four passengers every square metre. When asked, passengers report overcrowding as the aspect of the network that they are least satisfied with, and overcrowding has been linked to poor productivity and potential poor heart health. Capacity increases have been overtaken by increased demand, and peak overcrowding has increased by 16 percent since 2004/5.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to bioload/chemical considerations, aquarists {{also consider the}} mutual compatibility of the fish. For instance, predatory fish are usually not kept with small, passive species, and territorial fish are often unsuitable tankmates for shoaling species. Furthermore, fish tend to fare better if given tanks conducive to their size. That is, large fish need large tanks and small fish can do well in smaller tanks. Lastly, the tank can become overcrowded without being overstocked. In other words, the aquarium can be suitable with regard to filtration capacity, oxygen load, and water, yet still be <b>so</b> <b>crowded</b> that the inhabitants are uncomfortable.|$|E
25|$|Space at Woodland Cemetery was at such {{a premium}} by 1907 that the city {{considered}} closing the cemetery to burials once streetcar service reached the new Highland Park Cemetery. There were 1,985 burials in calendar 1907 at Woodland Cemetery, the most ever. But with only 150 family burial plots and 400 single grave lots left, officials believed that the cemetery would have no more lots to sell by 1910. It was <b>so</b> <b>crowded</b> at Woodland that the Cleveland Board of Health in 1911 permitted a second body to be buried atop the first (but only if 10 years had passed).|$|E

25|$|Norwegian Vikings {{and other}} Scandinavians {{conducted}} extensive raids in Ireland. They founded Limerick in 812, then established Waterford in 853, founded the only Viking capital {{city in the}} world outside the Nordic countries in Dublin, and founded trading ports in Cork in the 9th century. Predominantly Norwegians, and to a smaller extent other Scandinavians, settled down and intermixed with the Irish. Literature, crafts, and decorative styles in Ireland and Britain reflected West Norse culture. Vikings traded at Irish markets in Dublin and solidified Dublin as an important city. Excavations found imported fabrics from England, Byzantium, Persia and central Asia. Dublin became <b>so</b> <b>crowded</b> by the 11th century that houses were constructed outside the town walls.|$|E

Initial development of the land included camp sites, an artificial lake for fishing and boating, picnic tables, and a large hall. The railroad provided {{easy access to the}} site, attracting visitors from [...] away in Pittsburgh and the surrounding areas for a getaway in the country. The Ligonier Echo noted that on July 4, 1890, the trains to the park were <b>so</b> <b>crowded</b> that the [...] "tops of the coaches were covered with boys." ...|$|E
500|$|Although the Allies {{were again}} repulsed, these {{persistent}} attacks on Blenheim eventually bore fruit, panicking Clérambault into making the worst French error of the day. Without consulting Tallard, Clérambault ordered his reserve battalions into the village, upsetting {{the balance of}} the French position and nullifying the French numerical superiority. [...] "The men were <b>so</b> <b>crowded</b> in upon one another", wrote Mérode-Westerloo, [...] "that they couldn't even fire – let alone receive or carry out any orders." [...] Marlborough, spotting this error, now countermanded Cutts' intention to launch a third attack, and ordered him simply to contain the enemy within Blenheim; no more than 5,000 Allied soldiers were able to pen in twice the number of French infantry and dragoons.|$|E

500|$|Colonists {{in western}} Pennsylvania {{fled to the}} safety of Fort Pitt after the {{outbreak}} of the war. Nearly 550 people crowded inside, including more than 200 women and children. Simeon Ecuyer, the Swiss-born British officer in command, wrote that [...] "We are <b>so</b> <b>crowded</b> in the fort that I fear disease...; the smallpox is among us." [...] Fort Pitt was attacked on June 22, 1763, primarily by Delawares. Too strong to be taken by force, the fort was kept under siege throughout July. Meanwhile, Delaware and Shawnee war parties raided deep into Pennsylvania, taking captives and killing unknown numbers of settlers in scattered farms. Two smaller strongholds that linked Fort Pitt to the east, Fort Bedford and Fort Ligonier, were sporadically fired upon throughout the conflict, but were never taken.|$|E
500|$|Crowded House are a {{rock band}} who formed in Melbourne, Australia, in 1985. They were founded by Neil Finn and Paul Hester of the New Zealander group Split Enz. Most Split Enz fans shifted their {{allegiance}} to the new group, <b>so</b> <b>Crowded</b> House had an established fan base before they had recorded any material. The band have released six studio albums: Crowded House (1986), Temple of Low Men (1988), Woodface (1991), Together Alone (1993), Time on Earth (2007) and Intriguer (2010). The band dissolved in 1996, and reformed in 2007. Crowded House have won awards both nationally and internationally, including twelve ARIA Music Awards from the Australian Recording Industry Association, and eight APRA Awards from the Australasian Performing Right Association. APRA also listed their track, [...] "Don't Dream It's Over," [...] as the seventh best Australian song of all time in May 2001.|$|E
500|$|Although the Antarctic scallop has a circum-polar distribution, {{this is very}} disjunct, {{and overall}} it is not common. In some places it is found at densities of up to 90 per square metre [...] and in Terra Nova Bay in the Ross Sea, at depths between [...] and , some scallop beds {{were found to be}} <b>so</b> <b>crowded</b> that adult {{individuals}} were lying on top of others. In other locations that seem eminently suitable in many ways, it was entirely absent. A possible explanation for this {{lies in the fact that}} its paper thin shell is characteristic of bivalves living in stable, deep water areas with little water movement. The shallower locations in which it now thrives are characterised by being protected bays or by having extensive sea ice coverage, each of which provides a stable environment unaffected by storm waves and where iceberg scouring does not normally occur. It is also absent from habitats dominated by other benthic suspension feeding communities whereas it is found in habitats with soft sediments and no dominant cnidarian and sponge communities. This might be because its larvae face such heavy predation in these locations that it is unable to establish itself.|$|E

They slept in cots or sleeping bags, squeezed into every available floor space or on desktops. Men would sleep around the conference table while women slept in cubicles and small offices around the main conference room. They were <b>so</b> <b>crowded</b> that there was barely any room to move, according to one of those present: [...] "Everyone sleeping with only about six inches on either side. Above you. Below you.

[...] They were only allowed to leave to attend Church events or to be taken to a shower in a nearby maintenance garage, to which they were taken two at a time under guard. Food was brought to them on golf carts from the Gold Base mess hall, as the executives were not allowed to eat with the rest of the staff, and they were only given ten to fifteen minutes to eat. According to one of the executives, the food was [...] "like leftovers, slop, bits of meat, soupy kind of leftovers thrown into a pot and cooked and barely edible."

500|$|THQ was the {{publisher}} of the first game, but the studio put little effort into helping the game's development, leading to numerous technical issues and a lack of polish. However, the game's sales surprised THQ, and as a result, {{the publisher}} considered the first game a missed opportunity, and began to treat Metro as a franchise. Danny Bilson, then CEO of THQ, promised that the company would offer 4A more support and dedicate more resources in both the game's actual development and its marketing. Former THQ President Jason Rubin offered details of extremely difficult working conditions and demands put on the 4A Games team while completing the game. Their office was freezing due to frequent power failures, and the team was forced to smuggle computer equipment into the offices to avoid corrupt customs officials. Rubin added that {{the publisher of}}fered an unreasonably small budget to the development team, accounting for only 10% of its competitor's budget and that their workspace was <b>so</b> <b>crowded</b> and small that he compared it to [...] "a packed grade school cafeteria", and an [...] " [...] gym at EA Los Angeles". Rubin praised the team for producing a game that successfully achieved high critical praise in spite of the harsh working conditions. According to Andrew Prokhorov, Rubin was the only THQ president that to visit the studio. He noted that the team [...] "deserve the ratings [...] get" [...] and [...] "need no indulgence" [...] from consumers who do not care about their working conditions.|$|E
500|$|In 1756, Dr. John Wall {{published}} a 14-page pamphlet {{on the benefits}} of Malvern water, that reached a 158-page 3rd edition in 1763. Further praise came from the botanist Benjamin Stillingfleet in 1757, the poet Thomas Warton in 1790, quoted in a review by the medical historian W.H. McMenemy. Cure tourism in Malvern got press mention. In a letter dated 18 July 1759 to Mrs Montague, Benjamin Stillingfleet wrote: [...] "I have been at Malvern about twelve days, where, with difficulty, I have got a lodging, the place is so full, nor do I wonder at it, there being some instances of very extraordinary cures, in cases looked on as desperate, even by Dr. Wall, who first brought these waters into vogue...The road is very fine, and made on purpose for the convenience of the drinkers". Chambers, in a footnote to the [...] "song" [...] quoted above, wrote [...] "Though modern visitors do not now lie in bushes, yet <b>so</b> <b>crowded</b> was Malvern one season that a lady of rank and fashion, with her equipage and servants were actually obliged to be sent to the Workhouse. It is now the custom, during the season, to let out this house to visitors, and the money gained this way is applied to the funds for maintaining the poor." [...] Nicholas Vansittart brought his wife Catherine to Malvern for a rest cure in 1809. In 1828, William Addison, the physician of The Duchess of Kent (mother of Queen Victoria) lectured about Malvern at the Royal Institution commending [...] "its pure and invigorating air, the excellence of its water, and the romantic beauty of its scenery".|$|E
