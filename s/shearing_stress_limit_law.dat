40|$|An {{experimental}} and numerical study on ram extrusion of bread dough {{was conducted in}} order to develop predictive models for the pressures involved, as well as the deformation of the extruded dough. Such studies are needed as high pressures can potentially lead to significant degassing, tearing and shearing of the dough and hence poor bread quality; the latter limits the use of extrusion processes which would otherwise be a cost ??? effective forming process. A laboratory extrusion rig was designed, with dies of varying angles and exit radii. Rate dependent behaviour was observed from tests conducted at different extrusion speeds, and higher extrusion pressure was reported for dies with smaller exit radius or larger die angle. A simulation of extrusion was performed to predict the extrusion pressure as well as the extrudate swell, as a function of die geometry and extrusion rate. A continuum approach was taken in the constitutive model of dough which is a starch filled system in a protein matrix. A nonlinear viscoelastic model combined {{for the first time with}} the Mullins model for filled rubbers is found to capture the continuum behaviour well. A Coulomb friction law combined with a maximum <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> <b>limit</b> was used to describe the contact definition between the extrusion barrel and the dough.

In short light-path systems, high efficiencies, 10 % to 20 % based on photosynthetic active radiation (PAR 400 to 700 nm), can be reached at high biomass concentrations (> 5 kg [dry weight] m(- 3)). It is demonstrated, however, that these and other photobioreactor designs are poorly scalable (maximal unit size 0. 1 to 10 m(3)), and/or not applicable for cultivation of monocultures.

Because {{the orientation of the}} greatest horizontal principal stress throughout the Pacific Northwest differs considerably from the direction of convergence between the Juan de Fuca and North American plates. the relationship haween the stress field and forces acting along the subduction zone has been unclear. To address this re-lationship. a two-dimensional finite element muciei developed by Bird [I 9891 is used that incorporates critical aspects of continen-tal deformation such as a stratified rheology and interaction be-tween thermal and mechiiniciil components of deformation, Boundary conditions arc specified in terms of either velocity or shear traction, depending on whether the computed <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> at the plate boundary is less than or exceeds, respectively, a prc-scribed limit, Shear-stress limits on the subduclion and transform plate boundaries are independently varied to determine the rela-tive effect of forces along these boundaries on intraplate de-formation.

They possess high strength and stiffness, which are desirable in resisting low-to-moderate seismic demands. When subjected to larger seismic demands, walls are assumed to develop a flexural response mechanism controlled by tensile failure of the longitudinal reinforcement. However, in recent earthquakes (2010 Chile, 2011 New Zealand) compression failures have been observed in the boundary elements {{at the ends of}} the wall, in the interior web region of the wall, or both.

The bentonite contents in the drilling muds were varied up to 6 % {{by the weight of}} water and temperature was varied from 25 °C to 85 °C. The nanoFe 2 O 3 content was varied between 0 and 1 % by the weight of the drilling mud to modify the rheological properties of the drilling mud. The nanoFe 2 O 3 and bentonite clay were characterized using the X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). In the TGA study, the total weight loss at 800 °C for the bentonite decreased from 13 % to 1. 16 %, a 91 % reduction when the bentonite clay was mixed with 1 % of nanoFe 2 O 3. The results also showed that 1 % of nanoFe 2 O 3 increased the rheological properties of the drilling mud. The nanoFe 2 O 3 modification increased the yield stress (τo) and plastic viscosity (PV) by 45 – 200 % and 20 – 105 % respectively based on the bentonite content and temperature of the drilling mud. The shear thinning behavior of the bentonite drilling mud with and without nanoFe 2 O 3 has been quantified using the hyperbolic model and compared with three parameters Herschel–Bulkley model.

The efficacy of ASA to limit platelet activation mediated via passage through a clinical cfVAD system (DeBakey Micromed) in vitro was also studied. ASA reduced platelet activation only under conditions of low <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> (38 % reduction compared to control, n = 10, p 0. 5) with no limitation of platelet sensitization. ASA had limited ability (25. 6 % reduction in platelet activation rate) to modulate shear-mediated platelet activation induced via cfVAD passage. These findings, while performed under "deconstructed" non-clinical conditions by utilizing purified platelets alone in vitro, provide a potential contributory mechanistic explanation for the persistent thrombosis rates experienced clinically in cfVAD patients despite ASA therapy. An opportunity exists to develop enhanced pharmacologic strategies to limit shear-mediated platelet activation at elevated shear levels associated with mechanical circulatory support devices...|$|R

This paper describes the optical and microfluidic mechanical manipulation of single suspended cells enabled by the μPIVOT, an integrated micron resolution particle image velocimeter (μPIV) and dual optical tweezers instrument (OT). In this study, we examine the viability and trap stiffness of cartilage cells, identify the maximum fluid-induced stresses possible in uniform and extensional flows, and compare the deformation characteristics of bone and muscle cells. These results indicate cell photodamage of chondrocytes is negligible for at least 20 min for laser powers below 30 mW, a dead cell presents less resistance to internal organelle rearrangement and deforms globally more than a viable cell, the maximum fluid-induced <b>shear</b> <b>stresses</b> are <b>limited</b> to ~ 15 mPa for uniform flows but may exceed 1 Pa for extensional flows, and osteoblasts show no deformation for <b>shear</b> <b>stresses</b> up to 250 mPa while myoblasts are more easily deformed and exhibit a modulated response to increasing stress. This suggests that global and/or local stresses {{can be applied to}} single cells without physical contact. Coupled with microfluidic sensors, these manipulations may provide unique methods to explore single cell biomechanics...|$|R
40|$|Analytical and {{experimental}} {{investigations of the}} characteristics of three dimensional turbulent boundary layers in a rotating helical passage of an inducer rotor are reported. Expressions are developed for the velocity profiles in the inner layer, where the viscous effects dominate, in the outer layer, where the viscous effects are small, and in the interference layer, where the end walls influence the flow. The prediction of boundary layer growth is based on the momentum integral technique. The equations derived are general enough to be valid for all turbomachinery rotors with arbitrary pressure gradients. The experimental investigations are carried out in a flat plate inducer 3 feet in diameter. The mean velocity profiles, turbulence intensities and <b>shear</b> <b>stresses,</b> wall <b>shear</b> <b>stress,</b> and <b>limiting</b> streamline angles are measured at various radial and chordwise locations by using rotating probes. The measurements are in general agreement with the predictions. The radial flows are well represented by an expression which includes the effect of stagger angle and radial pressure gradient. The radial flows in the rotor channel are higher than those on a single blade. The collateral region exists only very near the blade surface. The radial component of turbulence intensity is higher than the streamwise component because of the effect of rotation...|$|R
40|$|Membrane fouling {{represents}} one of the major issues for a membrane bioreactor (MBR). Membrane fouling and high aeration requirements (for inducing <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> to <b>limit</b> fouling) make MBR operation economically demanding due to high energy costs. Although several studies on MBR fouling have been performed, comprehensive knowledge on how to reduce membrane fouling and consequently save energy is still lacking. An integrated mathematical model for MBR is applied to a University of Cape Town membrane bioreactor with the final aim to reduce the energy costs. In particular, the influence of the aeration intensity, the duration of filtration/backwashing cycles, and the number of membrane cleanings are investigated. Five scenarios are analyzed and compared, each implementing different operating conditions. The features of the analyzed scenarios are quantified by employing Monte Carlo simulations and performance indices partially drawn from literature. The results provide insights about the role played by the main physical/chemical/biological processes in view of a system optimization. As expected, MBR operation at low air flow rate (qa) leads to a substantial reduction of the operational costs (specifically, 20...|$|R
