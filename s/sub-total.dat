40|$|A {{new class}} of {{estimation}} of parameters is proposed for data mining, analysis and modeling of massive datasets. With the expansion of Information Technology, the present problem with many scientists is the analysis and modeling with extremely large databases, sometime refers to as data mining or knowledge discovery in databases. It was found that many attempts used {{to solve this problem}} were based on classical approaches such as regression, classification and multivariate techniques, and even summary statistics such as mean and standard deviations are still having problem of estimation with extremely large datasets. Because classical statistical approaches were developed historically to cater the limited availability of data, they do not intend to solve the problem with massive dataset. In this study, certain properties of <b>sub-totaling</b> and repeated estimation of population parameters were used to establish a new statistical method for estimating summary characteristics of populations, and relationships between variables with extremely large datasets. While the method has straightforward applications in data mining and analysis of large databases, it poses the significance of further statistical research.

40|$|Abstract: Standard {{approaches}} to sample surveys take {{as the point}} of departure the estimation of one or several population totals (or means), or a few predefined <b>sub-totals</b> (or sub-means). While the model-based prediction approach provides an attractive framework for estimation and inference, a model-based theory for the variety of randomization sampling designs has been lacking. In this paper we extend the model-based approach {{to the prediction of}} individuals in addition to totals and means. Since, given the sample, the conditional prediction error is zero for the selected units but positive for the units outside of the sample, it is possible to use the sampling design to control the unconditional individual prediction mean square errors. This immediately raises the need for probability sampling. It turns out that balancing between optimal prediction of the population total and control over individual predictions provides a fruitful model-based approach to sampling design. Apart from raising the need for probability sampling in general, it leads naturally to a number of important design features that are firmly established in the sampling practice, including the use of simple random sampling for homogeneous populations and unequal probability sampling otherwise, the division of a business population into the take-all, take-some and take-none units, the most common two-stage sampling designs, the use of stratification with proportional allocation, etc [...] Most of them have not received adequate model-based treatment previously. Our approach enables us to give an appraisal of these methods from a prediction point of view.

40|$|The {{problem with}} which this {{investigation}} is concerned is {{the description of the}} social map that is presented to the viewers of public television. Using content analysis methodology, the study describes how different genders, racial groups, and age groups are being portrayed on PBS programming. The sample consisted of one week of PBS 1984 fall programming broadcast on KERA-TV, the PBS station in Dallas-Ft. Worth, Texas. Research questions addressing proportions of groups, types of roles, length of scenes, occupational variation, conversational behaviors, conflict management modes, and cultural norms were answered. All coding was accomplished by the principal investigator. Upon completion of the coding <b>sub-totals</b> for the variables under study by program types and a grand total for the entire sample were then tabulated. After this extensive content analysis, the report concludes that females are still extremely underrepresented in PBS programming, accounting for only 32. 7 % of the total participants. Blacks and Hispanics are also underrepresented except in children's programming. Occupational variation for white males is evident for all types of PBS programming. Occupational variation for white females is evident in children's programming and informational/documentary programming. Minorities with delineated occupations are extremely limited in all types of programming except for children's programming. The exchange of information is the major conversational behavior that occurs on PBS programming with minority characters receiving orders considerably more than their white counterparts. Verbal aggression is the conflict management mode chosen most frequently on PBS programming. Explicit messages regarding racial and sexual equality and prosocial behavior occur on PBS programming. Implicit messages such as frequency of appearances, number of major roles, and prevalence of power cues suggest a white male domination of television programming on PBS. The findings of the study reveal that major inroads have been made by women and minorities in children's programming. This comprehensive analysis confirms, however, the virtual exclusion of minorities in major segments of PBS programming...|$|R
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The {{purpose of this study}} was to collect information about the conditions, opportunities, problems and needs of teachers at the beginning of their career and to assist in the development of services to them. National Survey of Teachers in Their First Year of Service, 1966 - 1967 (SN: 66031, 66032, 66033, 67032, 67033) This group of surveys serves both as a demographic study of probationary teachers and as a longitudinal study in which characteristics of the teachers at the beginning and at the end of the year were related to each other and to characteristics of the school and of the employing authority. It covers seven main areas: probationary background and training; their distribution; appointment and placement; in-service guidance; probationers in the classroom; in the school community; outside school; and career intentions. Arising from findings of this group of surveys, a further research and development project was undertaken by the University of Bristol to investigate the needs, problems, and advantages associated with the mounting of in-service courses for probationers. The data from this project are held as SN: 14 Probationary Teachers, 1968 - 1969 and SN: 15 Probationary Teachers, 1969 - 1970. The phasing of the enquiry followed the timetable: Spring 1966 : Survey of Directors of Education in the 162 LEA's in England and Wales (SN: 66031) June 1966 : Survey of Head Teachers (SN: 66032) Sept 1966 : First survey of probationers (SN: 66033) March 1967 : Oral interviews with sub-sample of probationers (SN: 67032) May 1967 : Follow-up questionnaire to probationers who responded to first questionnaire (SN: 67033) SN: 14 includes two questionnaires (A 1 and B 1) distributed to probationers in one rural and three urban areas in July 1969. These probationers had completed their probationary year and had experienced only traditional forms of in-service guidance; they formed a control group for the project. SN: 15 includes nine questionnaires, distributed between September 1969 and July 1970 in conjunction with a series of project-organized induction courses and discussion meetings. The questionnaires were administered according to the following timetable: Sept 1969 : Questionnaire A 2 and B 2 to all probationers Sept-Oct 1969 : Questionnaire C 1 to those attending induction conference Oct-Dec 1969 : Questionnaire C 2 to those attending discussion meetings Jan-June 1970 : Questionnaire C 3 to those at optional topics courses July 1970 : Questionnaire C 4 to those at overview conference July 1970 : Questionnaire C 5 to all probationers July 1970 : Questionnaire A 3 to all probationers (Questionnaire A 1, A 2 and A 3 were essentially identical, B 1, B 2 and B 3 completely identical.) The questionnaires therefore measured both response to various course programmes and discussion meetings, and the overall effect of such courses on the professional judgements, opinions and actions of probationary teachers. Main Topics : Variables After ascertaining the total number of new appointments made in primary, secondary and further education establishments and the number of probationers appointed, the survey collected information from each LEA in three categories: 1. Selection and Placement of Probationers: what kind of information the Authority receives on each probationer and the kind of information found most helpful in both selection and placement; whether probationers are excluded from any of five types of teaching (supply, 'floating', remedial, reception or very large classes); whether probationers are appointed to a particular school, and the latest date by which probationer is notified of appointment to the Authority and of placement in the school. 2. Services to Probationers: forms of guidance offered to the probationer and institutions invited to give guidance. 3. Assessment: intervals at which progress information is sought; where responsibility for making assessment lies; recommended number of class observations for assessment purposes; where responsibility for final recommendation on probationer's suitability for teaching lies, and the number of teachers, both those with teacher training qualifications and those with other qualifications, who were adjudged to have successfully completed their probationary year, the number whose probation was to be extended for a further six months, and the number deemed unsuitable for further employment as teachers.

Between 1931 and 1945, Japan produced 6450 tanks. Half of them (3300) were made by the Mitsubishi Company. The <b>sub-total</b> of tanks produced between 1940 and 1945 is 4424, i.e. a yearly average comparable to Italy. For a country as large and as industrialized as Japan, that is modest.

It changed to a degree in 1944/45, when the homeland became increasingly under direct threat but it was too late. As with many innovative weapons projects launched by Japan in the final years of World War II, production could not advance beyond either small numbers or the prototype stage due to material shortages, and the loss of Japan's industrial infrastructure to the Allied bombing of Japan.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} the independent contribution {{of change in}} <b>sub-total</b> body fat and lean mass to cognitive performance, specifically the executive processes of selective attention and conflict resolution, in community-dwelling older women. Methods: This secondary analysis included 114 women aged 65 to 75 years old.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to assess the possibility that <b>sub-total</b> ventral hippocampal lesions might leave intact a mechanism for only highly accurate navigation, whereas <b>sub-total</b> dorsal hippocampal lesions might leave intact a mechanism only for less precise navigation. Animals with selective dorsal, ventral or complete hippocampal lesions were tested in a water maze, in which the target platform was moved from trial to trial, but always within a defined area, instead of being at a fixed location. Hence, an animal that searched at exactly the point where the platform had been found on a previous trial would be disadvantaged, in comparison with an animal that searched in the right general area. This might favor animals capable of less precise navigation over those with very precise navigational abilities. In subsequent phases of the experiment, we additionally assessed, for comparison, performance with a fixed platform location, reversal learning in the water-maze, and performance on an elevated T-maze. Our results revealed no sign of any qualitative difference between the effects of the selective <b>sub-total</b> lesions when the water maze hidden platform location was varied within the defined area, and the effects in subsequent more conventionally used tests. Ventral hippocampal damage never led to a performance deficit. Dorsal hippocampal damage led to significantly poorer performance in only some test phases, and never led to any sign of improved performance...|$|E

A further aim was to propose a metric for assessing the adequacy of community mental health services in meeting ongoing needs over longer stretches of time. We made four prospective follow-up studies of CAN assessments of patients with severe mental illness in community-based mental health care. A factor analysis (n= 741) gave support for a three-factor model, comprising only 60 % of the CAN items. Need assessments (n= 92) in 1997 and 2003 were compared at both the summed total and the underlying item levels of the CAN. The mean total scores did not change, yet there were {{significant changes in the}} underlying items. Changes in mean number of needs between 1997 and 1999 were measured (n= 262) with both total scores, summed over all CAN items, and with <b>sub-total</b> scores, summed over two sets of items reflecting the social services and the psychiatric services respectively. As indicated by the <b>sub-total</b> scores, all significant changes occurred within the psychiatric services, a result not possible to discern from the total scores. The Met Needs Index (MNI), defined by us as the aggregate measure of beneficial outcome, indicated that needs in general were met during 71 % of the intervals between the annuals assessments from 1997 through 2004. However, the variation among particular items was large. In conclusion, the summary scores typically used as outcome measures are likely to conceal meaningful variation at the item level.

We determined the levels of iPTH before surgery and its evolution after parathyroidectomy at regular intervals: Day 0, D 7, D 15, D 30 and D 90. The mean age of our patients was 40 ± 13 years, with a sex ratio of 1. The mean duration on HD was 122 ± 63 months. The duration of secondary hyperparathyroidism varied from one year to 12 years. All patients had received medical treatment for hyperparathyroidism. The indications for parathyroidectomy included resistance to medical treatment in seven cases, development of brown tumors in two cases and soft tissue calcifications in one case. All patients had radiographic evidence of hyperparathyroidism. The parathyroidectomy was <b>sub-total</b> in all patients, 6 / 8 in four cases and 7 / 8 in six cases. The mean iPTH level was 2341 ± 1946 pg/mL before surgery. A sharp drop in this level was noticed on D 0, with a median of 92 pg/mL and, thereafter, the levels were 79 pg/mL on D 7, 25 pg/mL on D 15 and 36 pg/mL after 1 month. At 3 months post-surgery, the mean iPTH level was 302 pg/mL. Histological examination of the resected gland showed parathyroid hyperplasia in all patients. In our series, the efficacy of <b>sub-total</b> parathyroidectomy was satisfactory with rapid normalization of PTH, which is consistent with the literature data. <b>Sub-total</b> parathyroidectomy still has a place in the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in chronic renal failure. Its indications should be limited to cases resistant to medical treatment and, in particular, in cases with occurrence of complications...|$|E
