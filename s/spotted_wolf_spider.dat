50|$|Pardosa amentata, {{otherwise}} known as the wolf spider or <b>spotted</b> <b>wolf</b> <b>spider</b> is a species of spider in the genus Pardosa belonging {{to the family of}} wolf spiders, Lycosidae. The species has a widespread distribution in central Europe and northwestern Europe and are commonly found on the British Isles. The species hunts its prey on the ground rather than weaving a web.|$|E
50|$|Later, Sarah discovers straws {{filled with}} a sugar-like {{substance}} in the lockers of the stricken students, their dog, Max, recognizes the scent all over the school. An eccentric scientist named Algernon Wheeling is called into the investigation, and determines that the sugar is actually to keep a male poisonous cross-breed of the African <b>Spotted</b> <b>wolf</b> <b>spider</b> and brown recluse in the straw till he smells the female pheromone on the victim because of the dollar bill, he eats his way out and bites the victim after being agitated at not finding the female. The spiders were trapped in the straws, and the pheromone was spread through dollar bills, that circulated around the school to attract the spiders to the intended victims, who hallucinated and were later hospitalized after being bitten. However, as the dollars were spread around the school, unintended sympathizers of the cult were bitten and suffered from the poison. The mastermind of the entire project, a boy named Norman Bloom, led the cult and allowed them to believe that witches were responsible (Ian Snyder and some others).|$|E
5000|$|The story {{starts off}} with Alex {{watching}} his stepfather cut up wood {{for the fire}} place, {{and even though he}} looks strong, Alex decides to ask him if he needs any help. Jake brushes Alex off and carries on, which makes him feel out of bond with his stepfather. Alex goes on to talk to his pregnant mother Virginia who is expecting twins. She is checking up on her pear tree and had pushed a glass bottle onto the branch, over the blossom [...] Inside were twigs and leaves and two pears. Over the summer, the pears had grown and gotten sweet inside the bottle. When the pears were ripe, Virginia would pull the bottle off the tree with the pears inside. She would then fill the bottle with pear nectar and give it to her sister Caroline, who would never guess how Virginia managed to put those pears inside this glass bottle. Alex then goes on to try to help Jake load everything else back to the house, and once again, Jake brushes Alex off. As Jake starts to unload the wood, Alex <b>spots</b> a <b>wolf</b> <b>spider</b> on his neck. Alex starts to talk to Jake about it but Jake thinks they are talking about Virginia who is right outside the window by the pear tree. After having a long conversation about it, Alex lets Jake know that is a <b>wolf</b> <b>spider</b> that they are talking about. Jake panics and asks Alex for help as he starts to search every piece of clothing. Jake is then standing in the porch naked with just his cowboy hat on hand. Virginia comes over and Alex tries to explain the situation to her. She points out to the hat is where the spider had been the whole time. Jake then picks Alex up and starts dancing with joy. Virginia starts feeling the twins dancing in her belly as well as she sees Jake and Alex do the same.|$|R

40|$|Predators {{influence}} prey through consumption, {{and through}} trait-mediated effects such as emigration {{in response to}} predation risk (risk effects). We studied top-down effects of (sub-) adult <b>wolf</b> <b>spiders</b> (Lycosidae) on arthropods in a meadow. We compared risk effects with the overall top-down effect (including consumption) by gluing the chelicers of <b>wolf</b> <b>spiders</b> {{to prevent them from}} killing the prey. In a field experiment, we created three treatments that included either: (i) intact (‘predation’) wolf spiders; (ii) <b>wolf</b> <b>spiders</b> with glued chelicers (‘risk spiders’); or (iii) no (sub-) adult <b>wolf</b> <b>spiders.</b> Young <b>wolf</b> <b>spiders</b> were reduced by their (sub-) adult congeners. Densities of sheetweb spiders (Linyphiidae), a known intraguild prey of <b>wolf</b> <b>spiders,</b> were equally reduced by the presence of risk and predation <b>wolf</b> <b>spiders.</b> Plant- and leafhoppers (Auchenorrhyncha) showed the inverse pattern of higher densities in the presence of both risk and predation <b>wolf</b> <b>spiders.</b> We conclude that (sub-) adult <b>wolf</b> <b>spiders</b> acted as top predators, which reduced densities of intermediate predators and thereby enhanced herbivores. Complementary to earlier studies that found trait-mediated herbivore suppression, our results demonstrate that herbivores can be enhanced through cascading risk effects by top predators...|$|R

50|$|<b>Wolf</b> <b>spiders</b> {{resemble}} nursery web spiders (family Pisauridae), but <b>wolf</b> <b>spiders</b> {{carry their}} egg sacs by attaching {{them to their}} spinnerets (Pisauridae carry their egg sacs with their chelicerae and pedipalps). Two of the <b>wolf</b> <b>spider's</b> eight eyes are large and prominent, which distinguishes them from the nursery web spiders whose eyes are all of approximately equal size. This can also help distinguish them from grass spiders.|$|R

40|$|In my {{bachelor}} thesis, Czech {{members of}} the <b>wolf</b> <b>spider</b> genus Alopecosa are discussed. Literature review summarizes our knowledge in ecology of <b>wolf</b> <b>spiders,</b> their life histories, phenology and habitat preference. I concentrated on reproduction of <b>wolf</b> <b>spiders</b> of the genus Alopecosa, especially on their courtship behavior. Recently, spider courtship is studied with focus on multimodal signalling. The review also contains remarks about spiders life cycles, copulation and parental care. Research of courtship of the genus Alopecosa is sligthly neglected, especially when we consider achievements gained by study of the American <b>wolf</b> <b>spiders</b> of the genus Schizocosa. It is necessary to know the taxonomy of the genus Alopecosa, thus some taxonomical remarks about current systematics and phylogeny of family Lycosidae are outline...|$|R
