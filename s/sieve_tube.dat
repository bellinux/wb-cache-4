This {{was carried out}} {{to determine if there}} was evidence of preferential feeding on either thin- or thick-walled <b>sieve</b> <b>tubes</b> in the barley leaf. Under both stress and non-stress conditions, preliminary results of an electron microscope investigation showed that penetration of the epidermis and mesophyll was largely intercellular, becoming partly intercellular and in part intracellular inside the vascular bundle. A total of 317 stylets and stylet tracks were encountered during the examination of 2000 serial sections. In non-stressed plant material, 293 (92 %) terminated in thin-walled <b>sieve</b> <b>tubes</b> and only 24 (8 %) in thick-walled <b>sieve</b> <b>tubes.</b> Investigation of 1000 serial sections using stressed plant material showed, that 84 of 89 (94 %) stylets and stylet tracks encountered terminated in thin-walled <b>sieve</b> <b>tubes.</b> Furthermore, 90 of 94 (96 %) stylets and stylet tracks encountered in 1000 serial sections from the second experiment of control non-stressed plant material (control) terminated in thin-walled <b>sieve</b> <b>tubes.</b> The thin-walled <b>sieve</b> <b>tubes</b> were significantly more visited (probed) by the aphid than the thick-walled <b>sieve</b> <b>tubes.</b> Under stress conditions, 50 of 89 (56 %) stylets and stylet tracks which terminated in thin-walled <b>sieve</b> <b>tubes</b> were associated with the small longitudinal bundles.

These data suggest that the aphid S. yakini feeds preferentially on the thin-walled <b>sieve</b> <b>tubes</b> of the small longitudinal vascular bundles in plants grown under normal conditions and those exposed to physiological stress, such as water stress.

40|$|Penetration of sink {{as well as}} source {{leaves of}} wheat plants by the Russian wheat aphid, Diuraphis noxia (Mordvilko) was {{investigated}} using light, fluorescence and transmission electron techniques, to determine the feeding strategies adopted by the aphid in penetrating and successfully feeding from the phloem, and to assess the structural effects of the probing and feeding behaviour of D. noxia on the feeding sites. Examination of aphid-infested sink, as well as source leaf tissue, showed that D. noxia probed in cells of the vascular bundle more frequently than mesophyll cells. Within the vascular bundle, thin-walled <b>sieve</b> <b>tubes</b> were visited (probed) {{more than the other}} cells. In sink leaf material, 68 of 82 (83 %) stylets and stylet tracks encountered during the examination of 1000 serial sections (from 5 different plants) terminated in thin-walled <b>sieve</b> <b>tubes</b> and only 14 (17 %) in thick-walled <b>sieve</b> <b>tubes.</b> Thin-walled <b>sieve</b> <b>tubes</b> were visited more significantly than thick-walled <b>sieve</b> <b>tubes.</b> However, examination of the aphid.,. infested sink leaf on a per centimetre basis, from the tip of the leaf, revealed that thick-walled <b>sieve</b> <b>tubes</b> in the area closest to the tip (0 - 2 cm from the tip) were as attractive to the aphid as were thin-walled <b>sieve</b> <b>tubes,</b> with {{no significant difference in the}} number of times thick- and thin-walled <b>sieve</b> <b>tubes</b> were probed in this area. Some 2 - 4 cm from the tip however, thinwalled <b>sieve</b> <b>tubes</b> were significantly more probed and therefore more attractive than thick-walled <b>sieve</b> <b>tubes.</b> Examination of 2000 serial sections using aphid-infested source leaf tissue, showed that the thin-walled <b>sieve</b> <b>tubes</b> were significantly more probed than thickwalled <b>sieve</b> <b>tubes,</b> along the whole leaf, expressed as a total of all leaves, as well as on a per centimetre basis along the length of the leaf, with 212 (95 %) of 222 terminations within the thin-walled <b>sieve</b> <b>tubes</b> and only 10 (5 %) in thick-walledsieve tubes. The aphid probed the small vascular bundles (loading bundles) many more times than intermediate or large transport vascular bundles, in sink as well as source leaf. Of a total of 82 stylets and stylet tracks encountered in sink leaf tissue, 31 terminated in small vascular bundles ang the remaining 28 and 16 were located within large and intermediate vascular bundles respectively. In source leaf tissue 121 of 222 stylets and stylet tracks encountered were associated with small vascular bundles and only 58 tracks and 43 tracks with intermediate and large vascular bundles, respectively. The effect of sustained RWA feeding on the transport capacity was examined after the application of 5, 6 carboxyfluoresceine diacetate (5, 6 -CFDA) in control (sink and source leaf tissue) and aphid-infested (source) wheat leaves, using fluorescence microscopy. After 3 h acropetal longitudinal transport of 5, 6 -CF had occurred in sink leaves in longitudinal veins, as well as a lateral transfer via cross veins and subsequent unloading into mesophyll cells close to the tip of the leaf was observed. In control leaf tissue, the fluorescence front was detected up to about 5 cm from the point of application and was only associated with the phloem and not unloaded. In contrast, aphid-infested leaf tissue showed very little 5, 6 -CF transport, being limited to 2 cm or less from the point of application. Structural damage to the phloem in general and to the <b>sieve</b> <b>tubes</b> in particular within of control and infested wheat leaves was investigated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In addition, leaf strips were mounted in aniline blue to visualise callose deposition using the fluorescence microscopy. At the TEM level. infested leaf tissue showed various abnormalities, which included destruction of cell contents, membrane damage and subsequent loss of cell contents. TEM studies suggest severe osmotic shock resulted from the aphid's probing. Examination of leaf tissue using fluorescence microscopy showed that there was very little characteristic aniline blue-stained callose visible in control leaf tissue, other than the thin diffuse patches along the sieve plates and punctate spots associated with pore plasmodesmatal areas and plasmodesmatal aggregates. In contrast, the aphid-infested leaf tissue was heavily callosed, with callose deposited not only within the phloem tissue but also in neighbouring vascular parE:}nchyma cells as well. The data collectively suggest that D. noxia feeds preferentially within thin-walled <b>sieve</b> <b>tubes,</b> within the small longitudinal vascular bundles in sink, as well source leaf tissue. Based upon the data presented here the thin-walled <b>sieve</b> <b>tubes</b> in the wheat leaf appear to be more attractive to the aphid and that they are probably more functional in terms of transport system and unlo?lding in sink leaves. Aniline blue stained leaf material that had previously hosted large aphid colonies showed evidence of extensive callose deposits 24 to 36 h after the aphids were removed, suggesting that the aphids caused severe mechanical damage to the vascular tissue and mesohyll cells as well. Damage (transient or more permanent) and the subsequent deposition of wound callose, disrupted phloem transport and hence the export of photoassimilate from the leaves. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{structure}} and transport properties of pit membranes at {{the interface between}} the metaxylem and xylem parenchyma cells and the possible role of these pit membranes in solute transfer to the phloem was investigated. Electron microscopy revealed a fibrillar, almost tubular matrix within the pit membrane structure between the xylem vessels and xylem parenchyma of leaf blade bundles in rice (Oryza sativa). These pits are involved primarily with regulating water flux to the surrounding xylem parenchyma cells. Vascular parenchyma cells contain large mitochondrial populations, numerous dictyosomes, endomembrane complexes and vesicles {{in close proximity to}} the pit membrane. Taken collectively this suggests that endocytosis may occur at this interface. A weak solution of 5, 6 -carboxyfluorescein diacetate (5, 6 -CFDA) was applied to cut ends of leaves and after a minimum of 45 minutes, the distribution of the fluorescent cleavage product, 5, 6 -carboxyfluorescein (5, 6 -CF) was observed using confocal microscopy. Cleavage of 5, 6 -CFDA occurred within the xylem parenchyma cells and the non-polar 5, 6 -CF was then symplasmically transported to other parenchyma elements and ultimately, via numerous pore plasmodesmata, to adjacent thick-walled <b>sieve</b> <b>tubes.</b> Application of Lucifer Yellow, and, separately, Texas Red labelled dextran (10 kDa) to the transpiration stream, confirmed that these membrane-impermeant probes could only have been offloaded from the xylem via the xylem vessel-xylem parenchyma pit membranes, suggesting endocytotic transmembrane transfer of these membrane-impermeant fluorophores. Accumulation within the thick-walled <b>sieve</b> <b>tubes,</b> but not in thin-walled <b>sieve</b> <b>tubes,</b> confirms the presence of a symplasmic phloem loading pathway, via pore plasmodesmata between xylem parenchyma and thick-walled <b>sieve</b> <b>tubes,</b> but not thin-walled <b>sieve</b> <b>tubes...</b>|$|R

40|$|It is {{generally}} believed that an osmotically generated pressure gradient drives the phloem mass flow. So far, this widely accepted Münch theory has required remarkably few adaptations, but {{the debate on}} alternative and additional hypotheses is still ongoing. Recently, a possible shortcoming of the Münch theory has been pointed out, suggesting that the Münch pressure flow is more suitable for herbs than for trees. Estimation of the phloem resistance indicates that a point might be reached in long <b>sieve</b> <b>tubes</b> where the pressure required to drive the Münch flow cannot be generated. Therefore, the relay hypothesis regained belief as it implies that the <b>sieve</b> <b>tubes</b> are shorter then the plant’s axial axis.

Ultrastructurally, Betta-Dn 1 sustained less damage to the vascular tissue {{as well as to}} the mesophyll during the experimental period. Both inter- and intracellular probes resulted in considerable saliva deposition as the aphids probed for suitable feeding sites. Salivary tracks were observed between and within mesophyll, bundle sheath cells as well as the vascular tissue, including the xylem. Disruption of organelles and cytoplasm resulted from cell probing and sheath deposition. Cell and organelle damage was more evident in the non-resistant Betta cultivar.

The fluorochrome was taken up into the symplasm of the mesophyll and was loaded into the bundle sheath cells and then subsequently the vascular parenchyma and finally into the <b>sieve</b> <b>tubes.</b> In sink leaves, acropetal movement was observed after 3 h and the fluorochrome had moved approximately 3 cm away from the point of application.

The {{other end of the}} stainless tube (phloem needle) was joined to a long glass capillary sealed at its other end to form a manometer for measuring phloem sap pressure. A method for measuring the average osmotic and turgor pressures in cells of leaves is also described. Phloem turgor pressures varied greatly in a series of phloem punctures around the trunk at 1. 5 and at 6. 3 meters. The variation in turgor pressure was always greater than the variation in osmotic pressure. In a series of turgor pressures arranged in descending order, the values in a sequence for the upper level was usually a little (0 - 3 atm) larger than the values for the lower level. These results may suggest that translocation of assimilate is favored by a small turgor pressure gradient, but they do more to emphasize the complications in measuring gradients in an elastic low resistance distribution system composed of contiguous longitudinal conduits.

40|$|Premise of the study: The phloem is a {{plant tissue}} with a {{critical}} role in plant nutrition and signaling. However, little is still known about the evolution of this tissue. In lianas of the Bignoniaceae, two distinct types of phloem coexist: a regular and a variant phloem. The cells associated with these two phloem types are known to be anatomically different; however, it is still unclear what steps were involved in the evolution of such differences. Methods: Here we studied the anatomical development of the regular and variant phloem in representatives of all 21 genera of Bignonieae and used a phylogenetic framework to investigate the timing of changes associated with the evolution of each phloem type. Key results: We found that the variant phloem always appears in a determinate location, between the leaf orthostichies. Furthermore, the variant phloem was mostly occupied by very wide <b>sieve</b> <b>tubes</b> and generally included a higher concentration of fibers, indicating an increase in conduction and mechanical support. On the other hand, the regular phloem included much more parenchyma, more and wider rays, and tiny <b>sieve</b> <b>tubes</b> that resembled terminal <b>sieve</b> <b>tubes</b> from plants with seasonal formation of vascular tissues; these findings suggest reduced conduction and higher storage capacity in the regular phloem. Conclusions: Overall, differences between the regular and variant phloem increased over time, leading to further specialization in conduction in the variant phloem and an increase in storage specialization in the regular phloem.
