5|$|Blaine’s {{earliest}} expressions in {{the foreign}} policy sphere were those of a reactionary Anglophobe, {{but by the end}} of his career his relationship with the United Kingdom had become more moderate and nuanced. A dispute over <b>seal</b> <b>hunting</b> in the waters off Alaska was the cause of Blaine’s first interaction with Britain as Harrison’s Secretary of State. A law passed in 1889 required Harrison to ban <b>seal</b> <b>hunting</b> in Alaskan waters, but Canadian fishermen believed they had the right to continue fishing there. Soon thereafter, the United States Navy seized several Canadian ships near the Pribilof Islands. Blaine entered into negotiations with Britain and the two nations agreed to submit the dispute to arbitration by a neutral tribunal. Blaine was no longer in office when the tribunal began its work, but the result was to allow the hunting once more, albeit with some regulation, and to require the United States to pay damages of $473,151. Ultimately, the nations signed the North Pacific Fur Seal Convention of 1911, which outlawed open-water <b>seal</b> <b>hunting.</b>|$|E

5|$|Although no general {{arbitration}} {{treaty was}} entered into, Taft's administration settled several disputes with Great Britain by peaceful means, often involving arbitration. These included {{a settlement of}} the boundary between Maine and New Brunswick, a long-running dispute over <b>seal</b> <b>hunting</b> in the Bering Sea that also involved Japan, and a similar disagreement regarding fishing off Newfoundland. The sealing convention remained in force until abrogated by Japan in 1940.|$|E
40|$|Starting in the 1960 s, {{considerable}} {{opposition to}} the Canadian and Norwegian harp <b>seal</b> <b>hunt</b> off Newfoundland developed. It was alleged that the <b>seal</b> <b>hunt</b> was unethical and that the seal population had been seriously depleted. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to analyze the production function for the <b>seal</b> <b>hunt</b> based on data for the Norwegian <b>seal</b> <b>hunt.</b> Particular attention is paid to the question whether free entry to the fishery will cause overexploitation. This depends critically on the characteristics of the production function, in particular the extent to which harvesting costs depend on stock size. ...|$|R

5|$|In the Aegean Sea, Greece has {{allocated}} a {{large area}} {{for the preservation of}} the Mediterranean monk seal and its habitat. The Greek Alonissos Marine Park, that extends around the Northern Sporades islands, is the main action ground of the Greek MOm organisation. MOm is greatly involved in raising awareness in the general public, fundraising for the helping of the monk seal preservation cause, in Greece and wherever needed. Greece is currently investigating the possibility of declaring another monk seal breeding site as a national park, and also has integrated some sites in the NATURA 2000 protection scheme. The legislation in Greece is very strict towards <b>seal</b> <b>hunting,</b> and in general, the public is very much aware and supportive of the effort for the preservation of the Mediterranean monk seal.|$|E

5|$|Several {{species of}} {{pinniped}} {{continue to be}} harvested. The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals allows limited hunting of crabeater seals, leopard seals and Weddell seals. However, Weddell <b>seal</b> <b>hunting</b> is prohibited between September and February if the animal is over one year of age, to ensure breeding stocks are healthy. Other species protected are southern elephant seals, Ross seals and Antarctic fur seals. The Government of Canada permits the hunting of harp seals. This has been met with controversy and debate. Proponents of seal hunts insist that the animals are killed humanely and the white-coated pups are not taken, while opponents {{argue that it is}} irresponsible to kill harp seals as they are already threatened by declining habitat.|$|E
5|$|In the Early Medieval era most {{evidence}} of religious practice comes from monks and is heavily biased towards monastic life. From {{this can be}} seen the daily cycle of prayers and the celebration of the Mass. There was also the business of farming, fishing and in the islands, <b>seal</b> <b>hunting.</b> Literary life revolved around the contemplation of texts and the copying of manuscripts. Libraries were of great importance to monastic communities. The one at Iona may have been exceptional, but it demonstrates that the monks were part of the mainstream of European Christian culture. Less well recorded, but as significant, was the role of bishops and their clergy. Bishops dealt with the leaders of the tuath, ordained clergy and consecrated churches. They also had responsibilities for the poor, hungry, prisoners, widows and orphans. Priests carried out baptisms, masses and burials. They also prayed for the dead and offered sermons. They anointed the sick with oil, brought communion to the dying and administered penance to sinners. Early local churches were widespread, but since they were largely made of wood, like that excavated at Whithorn, the only evidence that survives for most is in place names that contain words for church, including cill, both, eccles and annat, but others are indicated by stone crosses and Christian burials. Beginning on the west coast and islands and spreading south and east, these were replaced with basic masonry-built buildings.|$|E

25|$|In Greenland, <b>seal</b> <b>hunting</b> is {{conducted}} with rifles – the seals are {{shot in the}} head from a small open boat while they sit on an ice floe.

The economy of certain rural Greenlandic villages, such as Aappilattoq, are highly dependent upon such <b>seal</b> <b>hunting.</b>|$|E
