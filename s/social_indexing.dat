50|$|Vander Wal is {{credited}} with coining the term “folksonomy’ in 2004. Folksonomy is sometimes called collaborative tagging, social classification, <b>social</b> <b>indexing,</b> or social tagging. It refers to taxonomies created by users applying their own tags to pieces of information (including articles, pictures, and websites). The tags aid users in categorizing information for both personal management and sharing with others. These user generated taxonomies stand in contrast to professionally created ontologies and taxonomies used for resource discovery and retrieval in more traditional knowledge organization systems.|$|E
5000|$|A {{folksonomy}} is {{a system}} in which users apply public tags to online items, typically to aid them in re-finding those items. This can give rise to a classification system based on those tags and their frequencies, in contrast to a taxonomic classification specified by the owners of the content when it is published. This practice is also known as collaborative tagging, social classification, <b>social</b> <b>indexing,</b> and social tagging. However, these terms have slightly different meanings than folksonomy. Folksonomy was originally [...] "the result of personal free tagging of information ... for one's own retrieval". Social tagging is the application of tags in an open online environment where the tags of other users are available to others. Collaborative tagging (also known as group tagging) is tagging performed by a group of users. This type of folksonomy is commonly used in cooperative and collaborative projects such as research, content repositories, and social bookmarking.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} proposes {{a model of}} intonational {{phonology}} for Miami Cuban (MC) Spanish within the Autosegmental-Metrical (AM) framework of phonology. Controlled and semi-spontaneous speech of 9 speakers was analyzed {{in order to establish}} the tonal inventory of this dialect, which contains three boundary tones, one prenuclear pitch accent, and three nuclear pitch accents. Results revealed that MC Spanish's tonal inventory most closely resembles that of Puerto Rican Spanish (Armstrong 2010), sharing a default prenuclear pitch accent and nuclear contours for broad and narrow focus, vocatives, echo questions, and exclamatives. Additionally, several sentence types had two possible boundary tone types, as seen in Alvord (2010) for yes/no questions. However, the boundary tone variation seen in the present study is not predicted solely by generation (as previously reported by Alvord 2010), but suggests a shift from the previous <b>social</b> <b>indexing</b> of boundary tones toward intergenerational variation, in which speakers from several generations produce both boundary tone types...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{financial}} effects of additions to and deletions {{from two of}} the most well-known social stock indices: the Calvert <b>social</b> <b>index</b> and the MSCI KLD 400 index. By examining not only short-term abnormal returns but also trading activity, earnings per share and long-term performance of stocks that are involved in these events, we are able to shed new light on the characteristics of the “social index effect”. We find that the addition of a stock to either index does not lead to material changes in its market price, whereas deletions are accompanied by negative cumulative abnormal returns of approximately- 1. 5 % in the short run that can reach- 14 % six months after the event. Trading volumes for deleted stocks are significantly increased on the event date and operational performance of the respective firms deteriorates after their deletion from the <b>social</b> <b>index.</b> These findings are consistent with the asymmetric financial effects of corporate social performance that are connected to <b>social</b> <b>index</b> re-compositions...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Skoob is a Brazilian {{social network}} {{based on the}} {{exchange}} of information of books and magazines, which allows the user, or skoobers, to insert of tags for organizing their personal bookshelves, {{as well as the}} sharing of public resources description. The analysis of the labeling of literary books is an indicative of the behavior of readers across the social activity index. Objective: To explore the <b>social</b> <b>indexing</b> done at Skoob, in order to examine the concepts used in tags, comparing them to the concepts present in reviews written by readers. Metodology: The book selected was ‘Sophie's World: a novel about the history of philosophy’ by Jostein Gaarder. First of all, we raised the discrepancy of the most popular tags assigned to the book. Then, through the content analysis with qualitative approach, we analyzed 30 reviews in order to raise the concepts in critical appreciation from readers. Finally, a comparison was made between the concepts of tags and reviews. Results: There was a variance between the tags that doesn’t refer to the number (singular or plural). The concepts raised in the reviews were grouped into three categories: a) Subject, b) Textual Genre, and c) Value Judgments. The concepts presented in the tags and the book reviews generally were different. Conclusion: It was possible, by analysing the reviews, to deep the understanding of some concepts found in the tags. However, among the concepts cited in the reviews only philosophy and mystery were present in the most of the popular tags...|$|E
40|$|The term "tagging" {{is widely}} used for the {{assigning}} of terms to information objects in user-driven websites, although a cursory examination of such websites suggests that the communicative functions undertaken by taggers are not always driven by concerns about inter-subjective informative communication. At {{the heart of the}} debate about <b>social</b> <b>indexing</b> are issues relating to meaning and interpretation. Even where the intention is to assign informative tags, there is an issue about the relationship between the modality of an information object and its subsequent interpretation in historical time. This paper tests a model of image modality using four test images, which are interpreted and tagged by a group of distance learner students at the Department of Information Studies, Aberystwyth University. The results are described, and the implications are discussed. Overall, this limited exercise suggests that the modality model might be of some use in categorizing images within an image IR system. The exercise also suggests that leaving annotation and tagging entirely to users could lead to information loss over time. Finally, the exercise suggests that developing a retrieval tool using genre and the intertextual nature of multimedia objects might lead to the construction of rich, knowledge based systems.

40|$|Recognition {{proficiency}} {{was measured}} in a lexical decision experiment using Korean words including ones that are stereotypically associated with younger or older people. Both accuracy rates and response times were significantly improved when a word was spoken in a voice whose age matched the age category of the word based on stereotype-based age rating. Accuracy rates were also significantly improved when a word was spoken in a voice whose age matched the frequency-based age category, although the effect on response times was marginal. The results {{are discussed in the}} context of an exemplar-based account incorporating social exemplar activation. First, the activation of social information is influenced by distributional properties of lexical use across social groups, indicating that social information of speakers is not only linked to sub-lexical representations as shown in previous studies, but also directly linked to lexical representations through <b>social</b> <b>indices.</b> Furthermore, the presence of an additional effect of stereotypes expands our understanding of the speech perception mechanism, suggesting that the <b>social</b> <b>indices</b> are enhanced by stereotypical associations between words and age categories.

40|$|In {{this panel}} and ensuing discussion, Japanese {{occupational}} scientists who have located their research in both Eastern and Western socio-cultural contexts present {{a series of}} papers that will critically challenge (early) perspectives regarding how occupation is defined, comprehended and ultimately conceptualized. The grand narrative of occupation {{appears to have been}} framed and progressed within certain cultural norms that particularly privilege ontologies and systems of knowledge germane to Western spheres of experience. Occupation framed in terms of individual agency, of rational and pragmatic paths to identity and being, and the universal quality of its assumptions are tacitly held and rarely contested. For many who abide in non-Western spheres of experience, as in East Asia and who hold varying ontological views, philosophical traditions and value patterns, occupation, as defined in the Western world continues to be a relatively esoteric construct. How do the forms, functions and meanings of occupations look when viewed from socio-cultural contexts that celebrate collectivism, that define individual identity imbedded in other(s), that regard social dependency as a basic value, and that have preferred a particular variation of Confucian hierarchy over Western egalitarian practices? What happens to the function of occupation as a “bridge”, when the gap between distinct self and outer environment is closed and rendered inconsequential in a worldview that melds these two entities? The panel will present papers that speak to various aspects of these tensions between culture and occupation. Dr. Etsuko Odawara will present her work on horizontal <b>social</b> <b>indexing</b> conceptualized in Japanese as ‘Uchi’ (inside) and ‘Soto’ (outside), as a means to provide insights into how some Japanese locate aspects of self, other and meaning and power of ‘doing’ in various realms of proximity and distance. Dr. Michael Iwama will examine metaphor – particularly of the ‘Kawa’ (river) as a narrative of ‘life flow’, as a way to demonstrate how the interconnected aspects of the social, time, and space are perceived by the modal Japanese subject and how these amorphous contexts form the bases from which occupations are identified and valuated...|$|E
40|$|A {{large body}} of {{evidence}} demonstrates that tobacco companies use {{a wide range of}} tactics to interfere with tobacco control. Such strategies include direct and indirect political lobbying and campaign contributions, financing of research, attempting to affect the course of regulatory and policy machinery and engaging in social responsibility initiatives as part of public relations campaigns. Although more and more is known about tobacco industry tactics, a systematic, comprehensive guide is needed to assist regulators and policy-makers in combating those practices. Guidelines and recommendations exist for countering and monitoring industry marketing, and recommendations have been issued to refuse industry funding of certain activities, but no broad policy has been published to assist government officials, policy-makers and nongovernmental organizations in their interactions with the tobacco industry. The WHO Tobacco Free Initiative (TFI), the department in WHO with the mandate to control the global tobacco epidemic, monitors the activities of the tobacco industry in accordance with World Health Assembly resolution 54. 18, which urges Member States to be aware of affiliations between the tobacco industry and members of their delegations, and urges WHO and Member States to be alert to any efforts by the tobacco industry to continue its subversive practice and to assure the integrity of health policy development in any WHO meeting and in national governments. As a continuing response to this mandate, TFI convened a group of experts to discuss tobacco industry interference in tobacco control and the public health policies and initiatives of WHO and its Member States. The meeting took place at the offices of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) in Washington DC, United States of America, on 29 – 30 October 2007. Before the meeting, participants received a background paper commissioned by TFI, which served as the basis for discussions. The experts were asked to draw up a list of topics and concepts that should be included in policies to counter attempts by the tobacco industry to interfere with tobacco control. The list facilitated discussions on gaps in scientific evidence and the challenge of finding means for countering the wide range of types of interference (e. g. political, economic and scientific). This list also provided examples of proactive ways of eliminating tobacco companies’ influence, including: policies refusing partnerships with tobacco companies; policies refusing tobacco company funding of research and programmes; rejecting self-regulatory or voluntary policies in tobacco control; encouraging divestment from tobacco investments; and promoting <b>social</b> <b>indexing</b> that excludes tobacco and businesses models {{that can be used to}} counter industry philanthropy. The meeting participants agreed that the results of the discussions should be incorporated into a document, to broaden understanding in the global public health community of the tobacco industry’s influence on tobacco control. This document is therefore a synthesis of the evidencebased discussions, revisions and suggestions of the experts and is presented in a format that can readily be used by policy-makers and is based on the best available evidence on tobacco industry attempts to interfere with tobacco control and public health. The document begins by stating that effective tobacco control and the commercial success of the tobacco industry are fundamentally incompatible and that, accordingly, the tobacco industry can be expected to seek to avoid, prevent, weaken and delay effective policies and programmes, which are against its interests. Equally, tobacco control, in seeking to maximize the decline in tobacco related disease and in the tobacco use that causes such disease, must be vigilant in monitoring the wide range of tobacco industry actions to undermine effective tobacco control. Part I describes the means used by the tobacco industry and its allies to thwart effective tobacco control and summarizes the industry’s history of undermining tobacco control, through direct lobbying and the use of third parties, academics and researchers. Part II describes the means used to monitor industry efforts to interfere with tobacco control. TFI aims for this document to provide the Contracting Parties to the WHO FCTC, and other WHO Member States, background and contextual information that may assist with the implementation of the WHO FCTC Article 5. 3 Guidelines which were adopted at the third session of Conference of Parties (COP) in Durban, South Africa in November 2008 to counter tobacco industry interference with tobacco control...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background There {{are very}} few studies about general quality of life parameters, {{standards}} for the description of health status and comparison with general population data on patients with Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), a rare disease in which epistaxis is a cardinal symptom. Purpose To assess {{the quality of life}} in a population of Spanish patients with HHT and compare it with the general population. Design and methods Between January 1 st 2005 and December 31 st 2013, 187 adult patients diagnosed with HHT who were admitted to the HHT Unit of the Hospital Sierrallana, completed on their first visit, the EuroQol 5 D- 3 L (five dimensions and three levels) quality of life descriptive test and the visual analog scale (VAS). The numerical <b>social</b> <b>index</b> value was also determined and the subjective effect of the nasal epistaxis on their quality of life was estimated classified as mild, moderate or severe. Results Patients with HHT had greater problems than the general population in the five dimensions of the EuroQol 5 D- 3 L, particularly considering pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. In the VAS and the <b>social</b> <b>index</b> value, patients with HHT also scored lower than the general population, particularly older patients, males, and patients with HHT 2. They also had values similar to those of populations with chronic illnesses. The subjective perception of the severity of epistaxis correlated strongly with the VAS and <b>social</b> <b>index</b> values. Conclusions The quality of life of patients with HHT, estimated using the EuroQol 5 D- 3 L scale, is affected across all dimensions. The scores are similar to those seen in cases of other chronic diseases. Older patients, males and the carriers of the ACVRL 1 mutation generally have worse scores on these scales.
