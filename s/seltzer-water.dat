60|$|Jack, who had {{forgotten}} to put the <b>seltzer-water</b> into his champagne, writhed {{at the idea of}} having Barnes Newcome before him, and swore, could he but see Barnes, he would take the little villain's life.|$|E
6000|$|... 'The solemn one at Tours, who {{squirted}} <b>seltzer-water</b> out {{of window}} at the beggars, without a smile, was very funny. So was the little one with grubby hands, who tottered under the big dishes, but insisted on carrying the heaviest.' ...|$|E
6000|$|The ladies had retired, {{the duke}} {{had taken his}} glass of <b>seltzer-water,</b> and had disappeared. The gentry lingered and looked at each other, {{as if they were}} an {{assembly}} of poachers gathering for an expedition, and then Lord St. Aldegonde, tall, fair, and languid, said to Lothair, [...] "do you smoke?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Florac, a very sober drinker {{like most}} of his nation, was blessed with a very fine appetite, which, as he said, renewed itself thrice a day at least. He now {{proposed}} supper, and poor Jack was for supper too, and especially more drink, champagne and seltzer-water; [...] "bring champagne and <b>seltzer-water,</b> {{there is nothing like}} it." [...] Clive could not object to this entertainment, which was ordered forthwith, and the four young men sat down to share it.|$|E
6000|$|... ... Curse the fellow, for an impudent, swindling, sneaking French humbug!--Your tone {{instantly}} changes, and {{you tell}} him to go about his business: but at twelve o'clock at night, when the voyage is over, and the custom-house business done, knowing not whither to go, with a wife and fourteen exhausted children, scarce able to stand, and longing for bed, you find yourself, somehow, in the HÃ´tel Bedford (and you can't be better), and smiling chambermaids carry off your children to snug beds; while smart waiters produce for your honor--a cold fowl, say, and a salad, {{and a bottle of}} Bordeaux and <b>Seltzer-water.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{pulled his}} own drawing-table to the window, set out his board and colour-box, filled a great {{glass from the}} <b>seltzer-water</b> bottle, drank some of the vapid liquor, and plunged his brushes in the rest, with which he began to paint. The work all went wrong. There was no song for him over his labour; he dashed brush and board aside after a while, opened his drawers, pulled out his portmanteaus from under the bed, and fell to packing mechanically. J. J. heard the noise from the next room, and came in smiling, with a great painting-brush in his mouth.|$|E
60|$|Here their {{conversation}} ceased; and Redclyffe {{listened to a}} long train of speechifying, {{in the course of}} which everybody, almost, was toasted; everybody present, at all events, and many absent. The Warden's old wine was not spared; the music rang and resounded from the gallery; and everybody seemed to consider it a model feast, although there were no very vivid signs of satisfaction, but a decorous, heavy enjoyment, a dull red heat of pleasure, without flame. Soda and <b>seltzer-water,</b> and coffee, by and by were circulated; and at a late hour the company began to retire.|$|E
6000|$|... "What did she say?" [...] Pen cried, {{starting}} up in great wrath. But {{he saw his}} own meaning more clearly than Foker, and broke off with a laugh--"Well, never mind what she said, Harry. Miss Amory is a clever girl, and says numbers of civil things--to you--to me, perhaps--and who the deuce knows to whom besides? Nothing's settled, old boy. At least, my heart won't break if I don't get her. Win her if you can, and I wish you joy of her. Good-bye! Don't think about what I said to you. I was excited, and confoundedly thirsty in those hot rooms, and didn't, I suppose, put enough <b>Seltzer-water</b> into the champagne. Good night! I'll keep your counsel too. 'Mum' is the word between us; and 'let there be a fair fight, and let the best man win,' as Peter Crawley says." ...|$|E
60|$|As Clive {{lay awake}} {{revolving}} the strange incidents of the day, and speculating upon {{the tragedy in}} which he had been suddenly called to take a certain part, a sure presentiment told him that his own happy holiday was come to an end, and that the clouds and storm which he had always somehow foreboded, were about to break and obscure this brief pleasant period of sunshine. He rose at a very early hour, flung his windows open, looked out no doubt towards those other windows in the neighbouring hotel, where he may have fancied he saw a curtain stirring, drawn by a hand that every hour now he longed more to press. He turned back into his chamber with a sort of groan, and surveyed some of the relics of the last night's little feast, which still remained on the table. There were the champagne-flasks which poor Jack Belsize had emptied, the tall <b>seltzer-water</b> bottle, from which the gases had issued and mingled with the hot air of the previous night's talk; glasses with dregs of liquor, ashes of cigars, or their black stumps, strewing the cloth; the dead men, the burst guns of yesterday's battle. Early as it was, his neighbour J. J had been up before him. Clive could hear him singing as was his wont when the pencil went well, and the colours arranged themselves to his satisfaction over his peaceful and happy work.|$|E
6000|$|When I {{began this}} present Roundabout excursion, I think I had not quite {{made up my}} mind whether we would have an Order of all the Talents or not: perhaps I rather had a hankering for a rich ribbon and {{gorgeous}} star, in which my family might like to see me at parties in my best waistcoat. But then the door opens, and there come in, and by the same right too, Sir Alexis Soyer! Sir Alessandro Tamburini! Sir Agostino Velluti! Sir Antonio Paganini (violinist)! Sir Sandy McGuffog (piper to the most noble the Marquis of Farintosh)! Sir Alcide Flicflac (premier danseur of H. M. Theatre)! Sir Harley Quin and Sir Joseph Grimaldi (from Covent Garden)! They have all the yellow ribbon. They are all honorable, and clever, and distinguished artists. Let us elbow through the rooms, make a bow to the lady of the house, give a nod to Sir George Thrum, who is leading the orchestra, and go and get some champagne and <b>seltzer-water</b> from Sir Richard Gunter, who is presiding at the buffet. A national decoration might be well and good: a token awarded by the country to all its benemerentibus: but most gentlemen with Minerva stars would, I think, be inclined to wear very wide breast-collars to their coats. Suppose yourself, brother penman, decorated with this ribbon, and looking in the glass, would you not laugh? Would not wife and daughters laugh at that canary-colored emblem? ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Neuchatel had not {{accompanied}} {{her husband and}} her daughter to the Montfort Tournament. Mr. Neuchatel required a long holiday, and after the tournament he was to take Adriana to Scotland. Mrs. Neuchatel shut herself up at Hainault, which it seemed she had never enjoyed before. She could hardly believe it was the same place, freed from its daily invasions by the House of Commons and the Stock Exchange. She had never lived so long without seeing an ambassador or a cabinet minister, and it as quite a relief. She wandered in the gardens, and drove her pony-chair in forest glades. She missed Adriana very much, and for a few days always expected her to enter the room when the door opened; and then she sighed, and then she flew to her easel, or buried herself in some sublime cantata of her favourite master, Beethoven. Then came the most wonderful performance of the whole day, and that was the letter, never missed, to Adriana. Considering that she lived in solitude, and in a spot with which her daughter was quite familiar, it was really marvellous that the mother should every day be able to fill so many interesting and impassioned pages. But Mrs. Neuchatel was a fine penwoman; her feelings were her facts, and her ingenious observations of art and nature were her news. After the first fever of separation, reading was always a resource to her, for she was a great student. She was surrounded by all the literary journals and choice publications of Europe, and there scarcely was a branch of science and learning with which she was not sufficiently familiar to be able to comprehend the stir and progress of the European mind. Mrs. Neuchatel had contrived {{to get rid of the}} chief cook by sending him on a visit to Paris, so she could, without cavil, dine off a cutlet and <b>seltzer-water</b> in her boudoir. Sometimes, not merely for distraction, but more from a sense of duty, she gave festivals to her schools; and when she had lived like a princely prisoner of state alone for a month, or rather like one on a desert isle who sighs to see a sail, she would ask a great geologist and his wife to pay her a visit, or some professor, who, though himself not worth a shilling, had some new plans, which really sounded quite practical, for the more equal distribution of wealth.|$|E
6000|$|Another exile to {{the same}} shore I knew: who did not? Julius Caesar hardly owed more money than Cucedicus: and, gracious powers! Cucedicus, {{how did you manage}} to spend and owe so much? All day he was at work for his clients; at night he was {{occupied}} in the Public Council. He neither had wife nor children. The rewards which he received for his orations were enough to maintain twenty rhetoricians. Night after night I have seen him eating his frugal meal, consisting but of a fish, a small portion of mutton, and a small measure of Iberian or Trinacrian wine, largely diluted with the sparkling waters of Rhenish Gaul. And this was all he had; and this man earned and paid away talents upon talents; and fled, owing who knows how many more! Does a man earn fifteen thousand pounds a year, toiling by day, talking by night, having horrible unrest in his bed, ghastly terrors at waking, seeing an officer lurking at every corner, a sword of justice for ever hanging over his head--and have for his sole diversion a newspaper, a lonely mutton-chop, and a little sherry and <b>seltzer-water?</b> In the German stories we read how men sell themselves to--a certain Personage, and that Personage cheats them. He gives them wealth; yes, but the gold-pieces turn into worthless leaves. He sets them before splendid banquets yes, but what an awful grin that black footman has who lifts up the dish-cover; and don't you smell a peculiar sulphurous odor in the dish? Faugh! take it away; I can't eat. He promises them splendors and triumphs. The conqueror's ear rolls glittering through the city, the multitude shout and huzza. Drive on, coachman. Yes, but who is that hanging on behind the carriage? Is this the reward of eloquence, talents, industry? Is this the end of a life's labor? Don't you remember how, when the dragon was infesting the neighborhood of Babylon, the citizens used to walk dismally out of evenings, and look at the valleys round about strewed with the bones of the victims whom the monster had devoured? O insatiate brute, and most disgusting, brazen, and scaly reptile! Let us be thankful, children, that it has not gobbled us up too. Quick. Let us turn away, and pray that we may be kept {{out of the reach of}} his horrible maw, jaw, claw! ...|$|E
50|$|In some Hasidic movements, the Rebbe only eats his Shabbat {{meals at}} the tish, often waiting many hours until the Hasidim have {{finished}} their meals {{to begin his}} meal with the recitation of the Kiddush prayer. In other courts, the Rebbe begins his meal {{at home with his}} family, and then comes to join the Hasidim in the synagogue to end the meal. In yet other courts, the entire tish is conducted after the meal has been finished at home. In such a case only dessert, usually consisting of kugel and fruit, is served, as well as soft drinks, usually <b>seltzer-water.</b> Such tishes are known as a Peiros Tish (×¤××¨××ª ×××©) ("Fruit Tish").|$|E
