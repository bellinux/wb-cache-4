5|$|The ship's keel {{was laid}} down in 1843 at the New York Navy Yard; she was {{launched}} on 27 June 1846, and commissioned on 6 November, with Captain Samuel Livingston Breese in command. Her construction was accelerated <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be complete for the impending war with Mexico. Although she could carry 22 guns, Albany sailed with only 20.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many girls}} of her time, Barney had a {{haphazard}} education. Her {{interest in the}} French language began with a governess who read Jules Verne stories aloud to her <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have to learn quickly to understand them. Later she and her younger sister Laura Clifford Barney attended Les Ruches, a French boarding school in Fontainebleau, France, founded by feminist Marie Souvestre, who also founded Allenswood, in Wimbledon, outside London, which was attended by such notables as Eleanor Roosevelt. As an adult she spoke French fluently without an accent and made her home in Paris. Nearly all her published works were written in French.|$|E

5|$|Due to time constraints, some {{plot points}} of Asellus story were removed. During those events, Asellus was {{supposed}} to visit Dr. Nusakan's clinic, Bio Research Lab, Lambda Base, and Furdo's Workshop <b>so</b> that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> find her true identity <b>so</b> that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> decide to live {{as a human being}} or as a mystic.

5|$|Nancy decides {{the only}} way to end this is to pull Krueger out of their dreams and kill him in reality. Quentin tries to stay awake long enough to pull Nancy out of her dream when she has Krueger, but he falls asleep and is attacked. Krueger goes after Nancy, and {{explains}} that he intentionally left her for last <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> stay awake long enough that, when she finally fell asleep, she would {{no longer be able to}} wake up. Quentin uses the adrenaline to wake up Nancy, who pulls Krueger into reality. She uses a broken blade to cut Krueger's gloved hand off, and then slice his throat. She then torches the secret room, with Krueger's body inside, and she and Quentin leave. Nancy and her mother return home from the hospital; Krueger suddenly appears and kills Nancy's mother before pulling her body through a mirror while Nancy screams.|$|E
25|$|Philippa Gregory's 2005 {{historical}} fiction novel The Constant Princess features the sweating sickness; although her depiction {{seems to indicate}} that Catherine of Aragon was kept away from Prince Arthur <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not catch it.|$|E
25|$|Steel's parents, Nina and Jason, {{who work}} as National Health Service audiologists, {{said that she}} was entered in Britain's Got Talent <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not feel left out as they felt her brother, Joshua, five years older, was more likely to progress.

25|$|Because {{the court}} was {{convinced}} of her guilt, her refusal to admit guilt made her position worse on {{the eyes of the}} court. One suggestion was, that at the place of execution, she would be given a last chance to confess her sin; if she did <b>so,</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be decapitated before she was burned.|$|E
25|$|Gates McFadden as Doctor Beverly Crusher, the Enterprises {{chief medical}} officer. As a fully {{certified}} bridge officer, Dr. Crusher {{had the ability}} to command the Enterprise, if circumstances required her to do <b>so.</b> <b>She</b> <b>would</b> also, occasionally, command night watch shifts on the ship's main bridge in order {{to stay on top of}} starship operations. McFadden was fired after the first season, but was rehired for the third season and remained for the remainder of the series.|$|E
25|$|When Phan {{passed the}} {{regional}} examinations in 1900, he was eligible {{to become a}} public servant. However, Phan {{had no intention of}} pursuing such a career and only wanted the qualification to increase his gravitas in rallying anti-colonial action. With his father dying in the same year, Phan had no more family obligations, and decided to travel abroad to pursue his revolutionary activities. Phan served divorce papers on his wife <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> avoid retribution from colonial authorities for his activities.|$|E

25|$|Some {{scholars}} {{have tried to}} reverse the order of her husbands, but find difficulty if they delay Marcella's first marriage (as alleged) until 15 BC when she was 25. If <b>so,</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be very old for a first marriage, and then have to remarry and immediately have two children before her second husband died in office in 12 BC. Instead, marriage 10 years earlier seems much more likely, given that Marcella's two younger half-sisters had already married by 15, and the younger Antonia gave birth to Germanicus on 24 May 15 BC.|$|E
25|$|Wagner {{moved to}} the Parichy Bloomer Girls of the National Girls Baseball League (NGBL) in 1950, because she was offered a higher salary, a signing bonus and no {{extensive}} travelling. Audrey only contemplated moving to the NGBL due to a disagreement with management. Additionally, the games were played in the Chicago area, <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be home every night closer to school and her studies. Whereas the AAGPBL gradually evolved from softball to an almost standard hardball, with longer bases and sidearm or overhand pitching, the NGBL used a ball larger than that used in the AAGPBL, featured the traditional underhand pitching and base paths stayed shorter.|$|E
25|$|A bust and {{historical}} plaque marks her birthplace in Toronto, now {{the site of}} the Hospital for Sick Children. The plaque was unveiled by her husband Buddy Rogers in 1973. The bust by artist Eino Gira was added ten years later. Her date of birth on the plaque is April 8, 1893. This can only be assumed to be because her date of birth was never registered – and throughout her life, beginning as a child, she led many people to believe that she was a year younger <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> appear to be more of an acting prodigy and continue to be cast in younger roles, which were more plentiful in the theatre.|$|E

Jennifer Sutcliffe, an expert tennis player, complains that her racquet feels unbalanced and writes to her mother asking for a new one. Meanwhile, she swaps racquets with Julia Upjohn, who prefers Jennifer's as it was refurbished recently. Later a strange woman arrives and gives Jennifer a new racquet, saying it is a gift from her Aunt Gina. The woman takes the old racquet (actually Julia's racquet). Julia later realises that Aunt Gina {{would have known that}} Jennifer's racquet had been refurbished and restrung recently, <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not have assumed the problem is in the strings. Soon enough, Jennifer's aunt writes that she did not send the new racquet.|$|E

She is married to a convicted murderer, Oscar Ray Pant, and becomes roommates with Amy's brother Vincent. While living with him, she has a daughter by Oscar, Ariadne Gray Pant, to whom she gives birth in a plastic pool in Amy's living room. Her mother arrives while Donna is in the pool, but is unable to offer her support and leaves. Maxine ends up getting in the pool with Donna. Later, Oscar confesses to Donna that he is really guilty and she divorces him. Upon passing the bar examination, Amy fires her <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> go to work as a lawyer; she becomes a court-appointed minor counsel for the Hartford Youth Advocates, whose office is across the hall from Amy's.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Luca {{decides to}} walk The Path of the Dragon alone, believing he will meet Dracula at the end, who {{he plans to}} kill.

Amongst Calugarul's {{correspondence}} he finds evidence The Path begins where Tepes was held prisoner in Turkey, and so travels to the jail in the mountains, where he discovers prisoners were left as food for a creature living in the forest <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> spare the nearby villagers. Tepes, however, apparently escaped. Upon returning to Vladoviste, Moriani learns Ozana has been told by the Iron Guard {{to get him out}} of the inn, and the villagers no longer want to speak to him.

25|$|Despite the Jamaican 4 × 100 m {{relay team}} being the highest calibre one yet, {{practice}} for that event {{had not gone}} well, with Ottey repeatedly starting too early and not facilitating the change over with her teammates. The {{rest of the team}} felt Ottey overly focused on her individual events, {{to the detriment of the}} team event. Pusey also felt affronted by Ottey's demand to run the anchor leg of the relay (a position Pusey felt was her speciality) and the friction between the two athletes led to a last minute change. Allwood switched the middle legs with Pusey <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not handover to Ottey, with Hodges remaining as starter. In the Olympic final, the team remained in contention until the final changeover, at which point Ottey again began too quickly, leading to a poor baton changeover. The team still ran a Jamaican national record of 43.19 seconds in sixth place, but Pusey felt her best chance of winning an Olympic medal was lost due to Ottey's mistake. Shortly after the Olympics, Pusey ran a personal best for the 200m in London, recording a time of 22.82 seconds.|$|E
