5|$|Tropic Moon III {{involved}} {{a completely new}} set of systems, up to date, and infinitely more capable than those previously installed. An entire new aircraft sub-variant, the B-57G, was developed for the purpose with a redefined nose to house the new <b>sensor</b> <b>package.</b> Development of the aircraft experienced major delays during which it was equipped with a laser target designated {{to be used with}} the then new first-generation Pave Way laser-guided bombs.|$|E
5|$|The 2010 SDSR {{delayed the}} project {{which became a}} {{competition}} between Thales and Lockheed to supply Crowsnest, a bolt-on <b>sensor</b> <b>package</b> that can be carried by any Merlin HM2. The Thales pod {{is based on the}} Sea King's Searchwater 2000; Lockheed had intended to use a derivative of the F-35's APG-81 radar but is now believed to be using an Elta system. Both systems will begin flight trials in the summer of 2014 ahead of Main Gate in 2016. Ten pods are planned with IOC in 2019. Until the Crowsnest system is available, a small force of Sea King ASaC.7 helicopters will remain in service with 849 Naval Air Squadron after the final withdrawal of the remainder of the Royal Navy's Sea Kings.|$|E

25|$|The missile's {{advanced}} <b>sensor</b> <b>package</b> includes its {{extremely high}} frequency millimetric wave radar, which allows the weapon to image the target and hence choose a target location.

25|$|Still in {{development}} as of 2003, the Rapid Airborne Mine Clearance System (RAMICS) {{can be considered}} an armament subsystem (and {{one of the largest}} guns ever fitted to a helicopter), though its intended targets are strictly naval mines. Consisting of a single modified Mk 44 Mod 0 30mm cannon firing the Mk 248 Mod 1 Armor-Piercing Fin-Stabilized Discarding-Sabot Tracer (APFSDS-T) round, the RAMICS was intended to be mounted in the cabin of the MH-60S helicopter, and using its associated <b>sensor</b> <b>package,</b> target and neutralize mines at relatively shallow depths. The system is designed to provide a quick and effective mine clearance capability to complement existing methods and others under development for the Navy's Airborne Mine Countermeasures (AMCM) Program.|$|E

25|$|Reports {{surfaced}} in March 2011 that NASA 926 was observed performing flights from Nellis AFB testing a new <b>sensor</b> <b>package</b> being carried in its pallet system payload bay {{over the period}} of 15 November 2011 until 1 February 2012. Although {{the reason for the}} deployment to the Nellis Test and Training Ranges (NTTR) was unknown, it was linked to testing sensors within the NTTR. Since both NASA 926 and 928 have carried BACN (Battlefield Airborne Communications Node) payloads in Afghanistan performing network-centric warfare missions, it was speculated that the Canberra was testing new sensors and antennas used by BACN to relay communications between command and control centers and ground troops located within valleys and ridges in the Afghanistan mountains.|$|E
25|$|The {{mission was}} {{furthermore}} the third {{flight of the}} TriDAR <b>sensor</b> <b>package</b> designated DTO-701A (Detailed Test Objective), a 3D dual-sensing laser camera, intended for use as an autonomous rendezvous and docking sensor. It was developed by Neptec Design Group and funded by NASA and the Canadian Space Agency. TriDAR had previously flown on STS-128 and STS-131, aboard Space Shuttle Discovery. TriDAR provides guidance {{information that can be}} used for rendezvous and docking operations in orbit, planetary landings and vehicle inspection/navigation of unmanned rovers. It does not rely on any reference markers, such as reflectors, positioned on the target spacecraft, instead using a laser-based 3D sensor and a thermal imager. Geometric information contained in successive 3D images is matched against the known shape of the target object to calculate its position and orientation in real-time.|$|E
25|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the day was}} to inspect Atlantiss thermal protection system, using the shuttle's robotic arm and the Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS) to look for any signs of launch damage. To do so, Commander Ferguson, Pilot Hurley and Mission Specialist Magnus used the shuttle's robotic arm and the OBSS to get a close up look at reinforced carbonâ€“carbon wing leading edges and the nose cap of the shuttle. The robotic arm grappled the OBSS at 6:58a.m. EDT. After raising out the arm-boom assembly, the crew activated the camera and laser <b>sensor</b> <b>package</b> on the boom to first scan the starboard wing. The nose cap was surveyed next followed by the port wing. The gathered visual and electronic data were downlinked during numerous Ku band communication opportunities to the ground. With imagery on their hand, experts began to review the data. The heat shield survey started around 11:00 UTC, was wrapped about five hours later. In his NASA TV commentary, NASA Public Affairs Officer, Rob Navias, said that most of the time, the crew worked ahead of schedule opting to take meals while working. The crew received high praise for their efficient work from the Mission Control Houston including CAPCOM astronaut Stephen Robinson who communicated with them during the survey.|$|E

In this presentation we will discuss the utility of autonomous underwater vehicles equipped with different <b>sensor</b> <b>packages</b> in monitoring storage sites. We will present data collected using Autosub AUV, {{as part of the}} ECO 2 project, from the Sleipner area of the North Sea. The Autosub AUV was equipped with sidescan sonar, an EM 2000 multibeam systems, a Chirp sub-bottom profiler, and a variety of chemical sensors.

40|$|Abstract. Based on {{the fiber}} Bragg grating sensing principle, and {{according}} to the characteristics of asphalt pavements, two types of FBG sensors are designed. One type is rigid <b>sensor</b> <b>packaged</b> by steel casing which labeled as R-type, and the other one is flexible <b>sensor</b> <b>packaged</b> by rubber which labeled as F-type. Through the tests of sensing performance, high-temperature stability performance and low-temperature stability performance, a comprehensive analysis of the long-term service performance is obtained. Analysis show that both rigid and flexible packaing have sensitizing effect while flexible packaging is better. Both types of sensors have good high temperature stability and low temperature stability, while R-tpe is better than F-type...|$|R

2500|$|In August 2006, NASA 928 {{arrived at}} RAF Mildenhall totally devoid {{of all the}} usual {{identification}} marks, particularly serial numbers or NASA logos. [...] The only insignia were a small U.S. flag on the tail fin and some even smaller flags beneath the cockpit on the port side. The lack of insignia possibly indicated that the aircraft was operating on behalf of another U.S. government agency. After some local sorties, possibly to test the onboard equipment, the aircraft departed to Kandahar Airport, Afghanistan via NSA Souda Bay, Crete. The aircraft then flew a number of sorties out of Kandahar, presumably carrying a classified <b>sensor</b> <b>package</b> and returned to Ellington Field via Souda Bay and Mildenhall.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports a}} {{packaging}} and calibration procedure for surface mounting of fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors to measure strain in rocks. The <b>packaging</b> of FBG <b>sensors</b> is performed with glass fiber and polyester resin, and then subjected to tensile loads {{in order to}} obtain strength and deformability parameters, necessaries to assess the mechanical performance of the <b>sensor</b> <b>packaging.</b> For a specific package, an optimal curing condition has been found, showing good repeatability and adaptability for non-planar surfaces, such as occurs in rock engineering. The successfully <b>packaged</b> <b>sensors</b> and electrical strain gages were attached to standard rock specimens of gabbro. Longitudinal and transversal strains under compression loads were measured with both techniques, showing that response of FBG sensors is linear and reliable. An analytical model is used to characterize the influences of rock substrate and FBG packaging in strain transmission. As a result, we obtained a <b>sensor</b> <b>packaging</b> for non-planar and complex natural material under acceptable sensitivity suitable for very small strains as occurs in hard rocks...|$|R
2500|$|A single {{airframe}} (Construction Number 1012, registration F-WZAK). {{was modified}} by AÃ©rospatiale from standard SA 360C configuration {{to develop a}} version optimised for hot-and-high conditions, designated SA 360H. The main differences were {{the use of a}} 1,040kW (1,400hp) Astazou XXB engine and the Starflex rotorhead that had been developed for the Ecureuil. Deciding that the main customers for this more powerful aircraft were likely to be military ones, the aircraft was further modified and re-designated SA 360HCL (Helicoptere de Combat Leger â€“ [...] "Light Combat Helicopter"). [...] It was fitted with a SFIM APX M397 roof-mounted, gyro-stabilised sight, and a nose-mounted <b>sensor</b> <b>package</b> incorporating a SFIM VÃ©nus night-vision system and TRT Hector thermal-vision system. Armament consisted of eight launcher tubes for Euromissile HOT missiles, with options to carry most of the armament packages used by the Gazelle. So equipped, it could carry thirteen combat-ready troops into battle, or be used in the area neutralisation or anti-tank role. This aircraft was taken on by the ArmÃ©e de Terre for evaluation, but no production order ensued.|$|E
2500|$|The Rivet Chip and Rivet Slice {{aircraft}} {{have been}} used by NASA in support of various research programs. NASA first provided funding to modify and operate RB-57F 63-13501 to support the Earth Resources Satellite Program, with modifications taking place at Fort Worth between 26 September 1968 and 14 July 1969 as Project Rivet Rap. Flying as NASA 925 and known as [...] "ESA (Earth Survey Aircraft) No. 3", the WB-57F was used as a flying testbed for the evaluation of multispectral sensors in a [...] "near-space" [...] environment to collect data to be correlated with similar data collected at low altitude and on the ground. The Air Force contracted with NASA to provide the aircraft on the condition that its <b>sensor</b> <b>package</b> be easily removed to reconfigure the aircraft quickly for its national security mission if necessary. The Rivet Rap was therefore modified to carry aerodynamically faired, plug-in pallets developed by General Dynamics to house both NASA and Air Force primary mission equipment. These pallets fit into the bomb bay and connected with existing electrical and cooling outlets, and had removable operating consoles that could be fitted into the back seat station in the cockpit.|$|E

40|$|Wireless {{networks}} of smart sensors with computations distributed over multiple <b>sensor</b> <b>packages</b> have shown considerable promise in providing low-cost Structural Health Monitoring (SHM). In these networks, microprocessors are typically embedded in individual smart <b>sensor</b> <b>packages.</b> The efficiency of embedded computational algorithms is {{of critical importance}} because the size, cost, and power requirements of the sensor arrays are central concerns. Here, very efficient methodologies are presented to compute statistical moments of a measured response time-history. These moments: the mean, standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis, are often used to characterize a measured irregular response. Two alternative approaches are presented, each of which can save substantial computer memory requirements and CPU time in certain applications. The first approach reconsiders the computational benefits of computing statistical moments by separating the data into bins and then computing the moments from the geometry of the resultin...|$|R
