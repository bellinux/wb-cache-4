The display or data-logging connections allow the user to see the data or record it for later analysis. Electrometers designed for use with ionization chambers may include a high-voltage power supply, which is used to bias the ionization chamber.|$|E

500|$|The {{phases of}} the inputs to each power {{combiner}} are arranged such that the two inputs are 90° out of phase with each other. [...] Since the coupled port of a hybrid combiner is 90° out of phase with the transmitted port, this causes the powers to add at {{the output of the}} combiner and to cancel at the isolated port: a representative example from figure 21 is shown in figure 22. [...] Note that there is an additional fixed 90° phase shift to both ports at each combiner/divider which is not shown in the diagrams for simplicity. [...] Applying in-phase power to both input ports would not get the desired result: the quadrature sum of the two inputs would appear at both output ports – that is half the total power out of each. [...] This approach allows the use of numerous less expensive and lower-power amplifiers in the circuitry instead of a single high-power TWT. [...] Yet another approach is to have each <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>amplifier</b> (SSA) feed an antenna and let the power be combined in space or be used to feed a lens attached to an antenna.|$|E

5000|$|Many bass players {{believe that}} tube {{amplifiers}} produce a [...] "warmer" [...] or more [...] "natural" [...] sound than <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>amplifiers</b> when lightly or moderately driven, and more pleasing distortion characteristics when overdriven.

Even though tube amplifiers produce more heat than <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>amplifiers,</b> few manufacturers of tube amplifiers include cooling fans in the amplifiers' chassis. Usually adequate cooling is provided by passive convection. Adequate airflow is needed to prevent excessive heat from shortening the tubes' lifespan or producing tonal inconsistencies.

50|$|Between 1963 and 1964, Fisher {{introduced}} {{their first}} all-transistor stereophonic receiver, the Fisher 400T. Early transistor receivers were not highly regarded by hi-fi enthusiasts, so manufacturers such as Fisher moved gradually with the technological advance. In the 1960s, Fisher made two trend-setting breakthroughs, marketing the first all-transistor (<b>solid</b> <b>state)</b> <b>amplifier</b> {{and the first}} receiver-phonograph combination, the forerunner of the compact stereo and integrated component system. These products brought Avery Fisher both fame and fortune. From 1959 to 1961, the firm also made important improvements in AM-FM stereo tuner design.|$|E
5000|$|Nearly all RF power {{goes to the}} beam. The RF source {{driving the}} cavity need only provide the RF power that is absorbed by the {{particle}} beam being accelerated, since the RF power dissipated in the SRF cavity walls is negligible.

The RF power budget is important since the RF source technologies, such as a Klystron, Inductive output tube (IOT), or <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>amplifier,</b> have costs that increase dramatically with increasing power.|$|E

5000|$|By the 1960s and 1970s, {{semiconductor}} transistor-based amplifiers (also called [...] "solid state") {{began to}} become popular.

As well, transistor amplifiers are more reliable and less fragile than tube amps. In some cases, tube and <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> technologies are used together, usually with a tube preamplifier driving a <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> power <b>amplifier.</b> There are also an increasing range of products that use digital signal processing and digital modeling technology to simulate many different combinations of amp and cabinets.|$|R
