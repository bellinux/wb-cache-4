25|$|Buffalo marketed a 2.5-gallon and 1-quart {{extinguisher}} using M-X liquid discharged {{through a}} low-velocity <b>shower</b> <b>head</b> type nozzle, {{but it was}} met with limited success, as it was going up against Ansul's Met-L-X, {{which could be used}} on more types of metals and was non-combustible. M-X had the advantage of being easy to recharge and non-corrosive, since it was oil-based, but production did not last long due to its limited applications.|$|E
25|$|Partial {{clogging}} {{is particularly}} insidious, {{as it is}} usually not discovered immediately, but only later by an unsuspecting user trying to flush a loaded toilet. Overflowing of the water mixed with excrement may then occur, depending on the bowl volume, tank capacity and severity of clogging. For this reason, rooms with flush toilets may be designed as wet rooms, with a second drain on the floor, and a <b>shower</b> <b>head</b> capable of reaching the whole floor area. Common means to remedy clogging include use of a toilet plunger, drain cleaner or a plumber's snake.|$|E

50|$|Some governments {{around the}} world set {{standards}} for water usage and regulate <b>shower</b> <b>heads.</b> For example, in the United States, residential and most commercial <b>shower</b> <b>heads</b> must flow no more than 9.5 liters per minute (2.5 gallons per minute) per the Department of Energy ruling 10 CFR 430. Low-flow <b>shower</b> <b>heads,</b> {{less than or equal}} 7.6 liters per minute (2.0 gallons per minute), can use water more efficiently by aerating the water stream, altering nozzles through advanced flow principles or by high-speed oscillation of the spray stream. USEPA administers a voluntary water saving program, WaterSense, which can certify low-flow <b>shower</b> <b>heads.</b>|$|R

25|$|Bill Krohn {{has noted}} that Bass's 48 story board panels for the scene {{introduced}} all the key aspects of the final shower murder scene – most notably, {{the fact that the}} attacker appears as a silhouette, close-ups of a slashing knife, the shower curtain torn down, a shot of the <b>shower</b> <b>head</b> from below, Marion's desperate outstretched arm, and the famous shot of the transition from the drain hole of the bathtub to Marion Crane's dead eye. Krohn notes that this final transition is highly reminiscent of Bass's iris titles for Vertigo. Krohn also concludes that Bass did not literally direct the shower scene, proving Hitchcock's presence on the set throughout the shooting of that scene.|$|E
25|$|L. jordanis is an {{opportunistic}} pathogen. It {{has been}} shown to cause lower respiratory tract infections in humans and is responsible for causing a type of pneumonia commonly referred to as Legionnaires' disease. Lung infection with L. jordanis is sometimes misdiagnosed as a Aspergillus mold infection. This mold also causes a fatal type of pneumonia which L. jordanis is able to mimic. Using human sera, indirect fluorescent antibody tests strongly indicated that unrecognized human infections with L. jordanis may be occurring. A study of patients from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, NY revealed a possible risk of nosocomial infections from shower heads found to contain L. jordanis. After this finding, monthly <b>shower</b> <b>head</b> disinfection procedures were instituted, but about 19% of shower heads remained positive for Legionella. Infections of individuals who are not immunocompromised are also possible.|$|E

2500|$|Von Teese is {{best known}} for her burlesque {{routines}} and is frequently dubbed the [...] "Queen of Burlesque" [...] in the press. Von Teese began performing burlesque in 1992, and, as a proponent of Neo-Burlesque, has helped to popularize its revival. In her own words, she [...] "puts the tease back into striptease" [...] with long, elaborate dance shows with props and characters, often inspired by 1930s and 1940s musicals and films. Some of her more famous dances have involved a carousel horse, a giant powder compact, a filigree heart and a clawfoot bathtub with a working <b>shower</b> <b>head.</b> Her signature show features a giant martini glass. Her feather fan dance, inspired by burlesque dancer Sally Rand, featured the world's largest feather fans, now on display in Hollywood's Museum of Sex.|$|E
2500|$|The {{pathologist}} {{determined that}} {{her eyes had}} been removed [...] "not less than five days and not {{more than three weeks}} before her death". She had been starved, having lost around 20kg in weight, and had not received water for several days before her death. Peter Openshaw, the prosecutor in Smith's trial, said: [...] "It was as if he deliberately disfigured her, causing her the utmost pain, distress and degradation... The injuries were not the result of one sudden eruption of violence, they must have been caused over a long period [...] were so extensive and so terrible that the defendant must have deliberately and systematically tortured the girl." [...] The cause of death was drowning, immediately prior to which she had been beaten about the head with a <b>shower</b> <b>head.</b> Openshaw said that [...] "Her death must have been a merciful end to her torment".|$|E
