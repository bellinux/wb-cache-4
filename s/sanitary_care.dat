Besides this, the rest of the school subjects were independent of religious influence, and therefore followed the secular tradition of Argentine education. The Peronist government also introduced subjects such as sports, hygiene and <b>sanitary</b> <b>care,</b> which the Church deemed excessively concerned with bodily matters.

50|$|<b>Sanitary</b> <b>care</b> {{reduces the}} risk of {{infection}} for group members and can slow the course of disease. For example, grooming is the first line of defence against externally-infected pathogens such as entomopathogenic fungi, whose infectious conidia can be mechanically removed through self- and allogrooming (social grooming) to prevent infection. As conidia of such fungi only loosely attach to the cuticle of the host to begin with, grooming can dramatically reduce the number of infective stages. Although grooming is also performed often {{in the absence of a}} pathogen, it is an adaptive response, with both the frequency and duration of grooming (self and allo) increasing when pathogen exposure occurs. In several species of social insect, allogrooming of contaminated workers has been shown to dramatically improve survival, compared to single workers that can only conduct self-grooming.|$|E

40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} feasibilities of improvement in <b>sanitary</b> <b>care</b> for patients in hospitals. The paper aims at finding {{out whether the}} <b>sanitary</b> <b>care</b> carried out in hospitals corresponds {{to the needs of}} the patients and further at identifying factors impeding the provision of <b>sanitary</b> <b>care</b> according to the applicable standard. The paper also aims at suggesting new feasibilities of improvement in <b>sanitary</b> <b>care</b> for patients at bed departments. In view of these goals four research questions were set: 1) Does provision of <b>sanitary</b> <b>care</b> in hospitals correspond to the needs of patients? 2) Are the patients satisfied with the <b>sanitary</b> <b>care</b> provided by the medical staff? 3) What impedes the nurses in provision of quality <b>sanitary</b> <b>care</b> for the patients? 4) Is it feasible to improve the <b>sanitary</b> <b>care</b> for patients in bed departments? The method of qualitative research was applied for collection of research data. The questioning method by means of structured interviews with the patients was chosen. The questionnaire contained 17 closed questions. Further method was an unstandardized interview with the nurses containing 11 open questions. Another method was structured impartial monitoring of patients and nurses. The results were noted and entered into tables. The research file was made up by the in-patients and nurses in the Neuro Surgery Department of the University Hospital in Pilsen. By means of the research the level of <b>sanitary</b> <b>care</b> was surveyed, the impediments to its provision were identified and suggestions for its improvement were formulated. The aims of the research were fulfilled. Based on the analysis of responses in the practical part of the research, hypotheses were set based on the 1 st and 2 nd questions and based on the 3 rd and 4 th research questions answers were formulated.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The brood of ants {{and other}} social insects is highly {{susceptible}} to pathogens, particularly those that penetrate the soft larval and pupal cuticle. We here test whether {{the presence of a}} pupal cocoon, which occurs in some ant species but not in others, affects the <b>sanitary</b> brood <b>care</b> and fungal infection patterns after exposure to the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium brunneum. We use a) a comparative approach analysing four species with either naked or cocooned pupae and b) a within-species analysis of a single ant species, in which both pupal types co-exist in the same colony. RESULTS: We found that the presence of a cocoon did not compromise fungal pathogen detection by the ants and that species with cocooned pupae increased brood grooming after pathogen exposure. All tested ant species further removed brood from their nests, which was predominantly expressed towards larvae and naked pupae treated with the live fungal pathogen. In contrast, cocooned pupae exposed to live fungus were not removed at higher rates than cocooned pupae exposed to dead fungus or a sham control. Consistent with this, exposure to the live fungus caused high numbers of infections and fungal outgrowth in larvae and naked pupae, but not in cocooned pupae. Moreover, the ants consistently removed the brood prior to fungal outgrowth, ensuring a clean brood chamber. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that the pupal cocoon has a protective effect against fungal infection, causing an adaptive change in sanitary behaviours by the ants. It further demonstrates that brood removal-originally described for honeybees as "hygienic behaviour"-is a widespread sanitary behaviour in ants, which likely has important implications on disease dynamics in social insect colonies...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{elucidate}} the roles of midwives and the way they related to women between the mid 1940 s and mid 1950 s, the period when home deliveries were most prevalent. As a method of research, I interviewed a midwife who used to actively work in provincial areas. Results of the study are as follows. Midwives played an important role in securing a sanitary environment and protecting the well-being of puerperants and newborns by giving advice on healthcare and assisting with deliveries. In doing so, she also educated people on <b>sanitary</b> and health <b>care.</b> In order to make deliveries safe and easy, the midwife became proactively involved in medical interventions based on medicine, which contributed to advancing the medicalization of delivery. Moreover, in their relationships with women, the midwife was closely and continually involved in their lives. The midwife provided support not only for deliveries, but also for the various problem faced by women, who were in a vulnerable position, and thus had close relationships with women. 研究の目的は、自宅分娩が全盛期の昭和 20 年代、助産婦がどのような役割を果たし、女たちにかかわってきたのかを明らかにすることである。研究方法は、地方で活躍した助産婦に面接による聞き取り調査を行なった。その結果以下のことがわかった。助産婦は、保健指導や分娩介助を通して衛生的な環境づくりや産褥婦や新生児の健康を守るうえで重要な役割を果たしていた。それは、衛生・保健の啓蒙という役割をも果たしていた。助産師は安全で安楽な分娩とするために、積極的に医学等に基づく医療介入を行なっており、「医療化」の進行の一端を担っていた。さらに、女たちへのかかわりは、相手の生活に密着し、継続的なかかわりであった。そして、望まれた分娩だけでなく、女たちがかかえる負の側面にもかかわるもので、弱い立場にある女たちに寄り添うかかわりであった...|$|R

40|$|The {{fact that}} Major Dobrzański gave his unit {{military}} character, required it {{to live under}} permanent threat, in very difficult conditions, in strict discipline and subordination, {{as well as his}} wish to avoid unnecessary conflicts, made it impossible for women to join the unit. The soldiers themselves (with some first-aid training) provided <b>sanitary</b> and medical <b>care,</b> assisted by the local population and doctors from the region. The wounded found shelter in forest cottages (dress-ing points) and at the Rectory in Ruski Bór, from where appointed persons moved them to the hospital in Opoczno. Wounded or sick soldiers were also treated, operated and looked after in the hospital in Tomaszów Mazowiecki. For a small unit operating in fairly good living conditions this could be consid-ered sufficient medical care. Constant expansion of the unit, hunger, exhaustion, absence of permanent quarters and atmosphere of constant threat brought with itself the inability to maintain personal hygiene, disinfect clothing and get rid of insects effectively, as well as to treat diseases affecting the soldiers. Absence of a decision to enlist doctors in the unit may be considered negligence on Major Hubal’s part. Good fortune as well as the determination and commitment of two nurses arriving from Warsaw, Ludmiła Żero and Genowefa Ruban, resulted in regular supplies of uniforms, medicines and dressing materials, as well as professional medical care nearly till the last moments of Major Hubal’s life.

Her focus {{is not only to}} analyse, but to reach policy and society, and thus go beyond theory and to provide bases for implementation. Dieck's scientific aims are......to bring the social protection and security of the elderly on one level and on the same standards with the social protection of all other population groups. This aim provokes, inter alia, her engagement for the nursing care insurance and, eventually, for the financing of social services....to fight and to overcome the reasons and causes of social distress and of under-supply (so-called “social weakness”) of the problematic seniority groups....to put constant effort in influencing policy and society, to let theory become practice....to strengthen the socio-politico-economic positions and ideas of the gerontological community in Germany. Concerning this, Dieck is occasionally blunt, sometimes even harsh in her diction. But she is always convinced of her concern's eligibility, being the social policy....to indirectly, and partly as well directly, represent the interests of those members of seniority, whose interests are only insufficiently observed.One important work beneath the already mentioned is “Sozialpolitik für ältere Menschen” (Social Policy for the Elderly), published together with Gerhard Naegele in 1978: This work is considered the programmatic foundation of a socio-politico-scientific research area in the social gerontology. An other one is “Wohnen und Wohnumfeld älterer Menschen in der Bundesrepublik”, on living conditions of the elderly in Germany, published in 1979. This monography is considered a benchmark of gerontological literature until today.Further publications of Dieck are on- women and aging,- family relations in higher age,- <b>sanitary</b> and custodial <b>care</b> of the elderly,- poverty and wealth in higher age,- elderly employees,- retirement and work-related “disposal” in higher age,- nursing care insurance,- social services and their financing.|$|R

Similarly the name‘Lambanis’ came from the occupation they practice. They were trading and were transporting Lavan (salt) and therefore the derogatory forms are attached to them as Laban/ Laman, etc. They are identified as a nomadic tribe earlier, so migration is primary and more reserved occupation for livelihood. In Karnataka state Vijayapur district have the highest number of Lambanis population whereas more than half of people are seasonal migrating to Maharashtra and Goa. Main cause for migration is low rainfall rate, non-effective implementation programs, less payment wages, regional imbalance in development, etc. Hence,consequences are;high school dropout rate, less care elderly and special persons, poor sanitary condition housing at migrated place etc. In order to understand the problem of the study was carries specific objectives like, to know demographic details of the community and district, to understand causes and consequences of out migration, to asses the socio-economic conditions of the respondent and to develop the community development model to the welfare of the community.

40|$|SummaryDespite {{the efforts}} of the {{international}} community diarrheal diseases still pose a major threat to children in children less than five years of age. Bacterial diarrhea has also emerged as a public health concern due to the proliferation of drug resistant species {{in many parts of the}} world. There is a paucity of population-based data about the incidence of shigellosis and Campylobacter infections in Pakistan. We report country specific results for Shigella diarrhea that were derived from a multicenter study conducted in six Asian countries. Disease surveillance was conducted over a 24 month period in urban slums of Karachi, Pakistan, a city with a population of 59, 584. Cases were detected through passive detection in study treatment centers. Stool specimens or rectal swabs were collected from all consenting patients. Between January 2002 and December 2003 10, 540 enteric infection cases were detected. The incidence rate of treated diarrhea in children under 5 was 488 / 1000 /year. In children, 5 years and older, the diarrhea rate was 22 / 1000 /year. 576 (7 %) Campylobacter isolates were detected. The pre-dominant Campylobacter species was C. jenuni with an increase of 29 / 1000 year in children under 5 years. Shigella species were isolated from 394 of 8032 children under 5 years of age. Shigella flexneri was the dominant species (10 / 1000 /year in children under 5 years) followed by Shigella sonnei (3. 9 / 1000 /year), Shigella boydii (2. 0 / 1000 /year) and Shigella dysenteriae (1. 3 / 1000 /year). Shigellosis and Campylobacter infection rates peaked during the second year of life. The incidence rate of shigellosis increased in old age but such a trend was not observed in Campylobacter infections. Of 394 shigellosis patients 123 (31 %) presented with dysentery in contrast to only 54 (9 %) of 576 patients with Campylobacter infections (p< 0. 001). Both Campylobacter infections and shigellosis are common in community settings of Pakistan but shigellosis presented more frequently with abdominal pain and dysentery than Campylobacter infections indicating that shigellosis may be a more severe illness than Campylobacter infections. Due to the increased and disease severity, drug resistant shigella have become a significant health problem; moreover it is a disease of poor and impoverished people who do not have the access to standard water and <b>sanitary</b> conditions, health <b>care</b> services or optimal treatment. In the face of these facts it is empirically important to develop a low cost effective vaccine that can protect these populations for a longer duration...|$|R

He contributed with the {{historical}} aspects in the Centennial issue of Revista Médica de Chile in July, 1972. He published 85 papers in this journal in a lapse of 20 years. In his works, he investigated about medical personalities with the highest relevance for Chilean medicine such as Dr. William Blest, graduated in Edinburgh and director of the first Medicine Course in Chile in 1833, the French obstetrician Dr. Lorenzo Sazie, first Dean of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Chile in 1843 and Dr. Eloisa Díaz, first physician graduated in Chile and South America in 1887. He published the translation from Latin of Juan Ignacio Molina’s verses "Elegies to smallpox", Chilean writer and erudite of the XVIII century. He also undertook the origins of Universidad de San Felipe (1737), Universidad de Chile (1842) and Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile (1889) and the main educational events occurred in the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Chile, during the past century. He also published about the public health situation and <b>sanitary</b> <b>care</b> during the XIX century, about the conflict between private and public teaching and other political events of the past century. The work of Dr. Costa as a whole, is a real history textbook of Chilean Medicine. Dr. Costa and Dr. Enrique Laval are the most important Chilean medical historians of the XX century...|$|E
40|$|Introduction and objective: Diabetic foot is {{the result}} of {{uncontrolled}} diabetes and imperfect <b>sanitary</b> <b>care</b> which leads to necrotic lesions, gangrene and finally amputation. Secondary mycotic infections play a principal role to produce chronic lumpy lesions. This study was designed to investigate the incidence of fungal pathogens in diabetic foot infections. Materials and methods: The study population included 120 consecutive diabetic patients who were hospitalized in the department of vascular surgery due to diabetic foot during 2006 - 2008. Direct fresh smear and fungal culture were performed for each patient. Fungal contaminations were confirmed by direct microscopy and/or culture. Results: The ages of the patients were between 32 to 86 years old. Of those 86 (71. 7 %) individuals were male and 34 (28. 3 %) were female. Direct examinations in 10 % KOH were positive for fungal element in 25 (20. 8 %) cases, but cultures were positive in 30 (25 %) cases. Candida species were the most predominantly isolated fungi (23 patients). Dermatophytic infection due to Trichophyton mentagrophytes was observed in three cases. The isolated opportunistic molds were known as Acremonium spp., Aspergillus fumigatus and Scopulariopsis spp. Significant correlation was found between infection, gender and age of the patients (P= 0. 0001 and P= 0. 0001). Conclusion: This study shows that fungal infection can be observed in about more than 20 % of diabetic foot and causes a lesion with poor prognosis. The most common cause of mycotic diabetic foot is different species of Candida spp., especially C. albicans...|$|E
40|$|Basic {{principles}} {{and content of}} quality standards of social services are described in the law 108 / 2006, about social services, and in related notice 505 / 2006. There are described the most important {{principles and}} obligations to provide social services by providers. Quality standards are a tool to achieve required level of services. They are also used as control mechanism for all of providers. These standards were released in 2002 and they started process of transformation some organizations. For this transformation are important a will of service provider and appropriate ammount of money to manage required changes. The quality standards are uniform tool for all of kinds of social services. It means to revise all of internal regulations of providing organizations. It means also to make emploees do along the new system. In the senior house in Sušice there was worked allong with these standards since the new legislation came into force. As a method were chosen conducted talks with clients and questionnaire for emploees. Althrow most of the clients are in serious health condition, they need care and help by personnel during whole day, conclusions in case of care were positive. All of the clients are satisfied with accomodation. Interesting is also the time of living there, 27 % of the clients live there more than 6 years. With <b>sanitary</b> <b>care</b> were satisfied 90 % of clients. Satisfaction of the clients with providing care means, that implementation of quality standards increases level of provided care. Questionnaire for emploees proves, that very important matter is to move people´s mind and to remove old stereotypes of work. Not all of emploees are working with aim to provide help to the clients. There is large space for a work with current staff and {{in the field of}} option of new workers. Relationships between emploees in working process are not good. I thing, it is a legacy of the past. I would like to say, that {{it is a matter of}} each emploee to build relationships in organization. New principles and quality of work, it means to develop education and knowliges of each emploee. Questionaires, which were collected, syllabus of talks with the clients and obtained conclusions will be used to improve the work in the field of social services...|$|E
40|$|Mastitis, an {{inflammation}} of the mammary gland, is the most prevalent and costly production disease in dairy herds worldwide. It is caused generally by bacteria and accounts for {{a significant decrease in}} milk production and quality. One promising approach to reduce problems caused by mastitis, in addition to <b>sanitary</b> <b>care,</b> is the selection of animals resistant to disease and the incorporation of this trait into the herds. Therefore, studies to better understand the mechanisms involved in animal response to this disease are essential to the proposition of new advances in area. In this context, the aim {{of this study was to}} identify groups of genes involved in cow response to mastitis infection, through gene network building from microarray data. Gene expression data from the GeneChipâ Bovine Genome Array (Affymetrix) hybridization with milk somatic cells samples from Holstein-Zebu crossbreed dairy cows, obtained before (B) and 24 hrs after (A) artificial infection with Staphylococcus agalactiae, were analyzed using a network building methodology based on gene co-expression. We used WGCNA (Weighted Gene Co-expression Analysis), a systems biology method for describing the correlation patterns among genes across microarray samples, that can be used for finding clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes to identify modules of co-expressed genes, which may correspond to functionally related genes. By comparing two networks (between contrasting data sets), conserved and non-conserved modules can be identified. This strategy, named differential network analysis, aims to identify genes groups that are both differentially expressed and differentially connected, and changes in connectivity may correspond to large-scale rewiring, in response to environmental changes and/or physiologic perturbations. Two microarray data sets, B (n= 5) and A (n= 5), were preprocessed using affy and gcrma R/Bioconductor packages. A filter was applied, which resulted in the use of only those transcripts present in all samples. Gene co-expression networks were identified separately for each group (B and A), by the R/WGCNA package. Gene networks were compared between the two groups, and non-conserved modules were uncovered from a correlation test of the connectivity values. Our analysis identified a total of 17 modules of co-expressed genes, three of them, designed by the colors grey (n= 35), blue (n= 37) and turquoise (n= 192), non-conserved between the groups. Using Blast 2 GO for enrichment analysis, we find the molecular function Protein Binding overrepresented in all three modules. However, in despite of the same molecular function, each one of the modules showed distinct characteristcs. Genes of grey module (BTG 3, CD 3 E, MBD 1, CHIC 2, PLXNA 3, MOCS 3, NEIL 1, VPS 45, BCL 2) were related to apoptosis and antigen recognition. Genes of turquoise module were enriched in inflammation mediators, including known mastitis marker genes (FGL 1, GJA 1, F 2 RL 1, PTPRF, S 100 A 2, TGFB 2). The blue one uncovered genes involved in cell division and inflammatory response (CD 97, MAD 2 L 1, ZFP 106, CDKN 2 C, LOC 514364, NOP 14, PCBD 1, LOC 100139798, AP 1 S 1, EDN 1, IL 1 B, ANXA 11). Our study identified some mechanisms (represented by gene modules) that have changed in cows in early response to mastitis infection. Further analysis are being carried out, based on these results, to advance the understanding of animals response to the disease, which can lead to identify the candidate genes that could be used in breeding programs. 2011 X-MEETING 2011...|$|E
