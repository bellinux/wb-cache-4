25|$|The Army had confiscated {{approximately}} 46,000 rural boats. The policy severely disrupted river-borne {{movement of}} labour, supplies and food, and compromised the livelihoods of boatmen and fishermen. Transport was generally unavailable to carry seed {{and equipment to}} distant fields or rice to the market hubs, leaving farmers in great difficulty. Transport costs rose, and the sudden stoppage of commerce not only caused some local industries to collapse, but also struck local areas with a <b>supply</b> <b>shock</b> on rice and fish, Bengal's two staple foods. The Army took no steps to distribute food rations {{to make up for}} the interruption of supplies. Moreover, artisans and other groups who relied on boat transport to carry goods to market were offered no recompense whatsoever; neither were rice growers nor the network of migratory labourers. The large-scale removal or destruction of rural boats, indispensable vehicles in the internal transport system of districts such as Khulna, 24Parganas, Bakargunj and Tipperah, caused a near-complete breakdown of the existing transport and administration infrastructure and market system for movement of rice paddy.|$|E
500|$|The Gold Rush stimulated economies {{around the}} world as well. Farmers in Chile, Australia, and Hawaii found a huge new market for their food; British {{manufactured}} goods were in high demand; clothing and even prefabricated houses arrived from China. The return of large amounts of California gold to pay for these goods raised prices and stimulated investment and the creation of jobs {{around the world}}. Australian prospector Edward Hargraves, noting similarities between the geography of California and his home country, returned to Australia to discover gold and spark the Australian gold rushes. [...] Preceding the Gold Rush, the United States was on a bi-metallic standard, but the sudden increase in physical gold supply increased the relative value of physical silver and drove silver money from circulation.

2500|$|Since {{the start}} of Plan Colombia, the main {{strategy}} for reducing cocaine production has been the aerial spraying of coca plantations with herbicides such as glyphosate. Since 2000 more than 1,600,000 hectares of coca crops have been sprayed and more than 413,000 have been manually eradicated. Aerial spraying of illicit crops is both very expensive and ineffective - for each hectare sprayed with glyphosate, coca crops are reduced by about 0.02 to 0.065 hectares, so 32 hectares of coca need to be sprayed to eradicate just one hectare (an effectiveness rate of just 4.2%). The marginal cost of removing one kilogram of cocaine from the market through spraying is roughly $240,000. Aerial spraying has {{a negative impact on}} the environment (deforestation, water pollution, harm to ecosystems), health (skin problems, respiratory illnesses, miscarriages) and causes internal displacement. After 2006, Colombian anti-drug policies shifted towards interdiction strategies (cocaine seizures, lab destruction, dismantling cartels) which have been far more effective than eradication strategies. These policies caused a major <b>supply</b> <b>shock</b> (increasing the street price of cocaine in the US), greatly reduced the net cocaine supply and led to major changes in the drug trafficking operations (shifting towards Central America and Mexico). Juan Manuel Santos, who had been responsible for the post-2006 drug strategy as defence minister, continued these policies as president. The Colombian government now addresses drug consumption from a public health angle and advocates for alternative development strategies in vulnerable regions affected by coca cultivation, while adopting a [...] "rational and efficient" [...] strategy against criminal activities tied to drug trafficking. As part of this new policy, in October 2015 the government ordered the suspension of aerial aspersion with glyphosate.|$|E

Using quarterly data, we study {{the effects of}} money supply on real output and inflation in China between 1993 and 2008.

Our findings provide evidence supporting the asymmetric effect of positive and negative money <b>supply</b> <b>shocks</b> on real output and inflation in China. That is, real GDP growth in China responds to negative money <b>supply</b> <b>shocks</b> but not positive money <b>supply</b> <b>shocks.</b> In addition, inflation responds to positive money <b>supply</b> <b>shocks</b> but not negative money <b>supply</b> <b>shocks.</b> We conclude that the People's Bank of China's policy of steady monetary growth appears to be appropriate.
