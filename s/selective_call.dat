5000|$|A general option {{setting for}} all MDC systems is to enable or disable an {{acknowledgement}} (ack) data packet. For example, following a <b>selective</b> <b>call,</b> the called radio replies with an ack. This data [...] "handshake" [...] confirms the called radio is powered on, has received and decoded the call. The encoder beeps {{to confirm the}} call got through to the target. In computer-aided dispatch, the encoder/decoder may pass the ack to the dispatch computer system, flagging the <b>selective</b> <b>call</b> as having been received by the mobile radio or automatically marking the time of call. The disadvantage of using an ack on busy channels is that more air time is used: roughly double the air time used by the <b>selective</b> <b>call</b> data alone. The ack packet takes roughly {{the same amount of}} air time as the <b>selective</b> <b>call</b> itself.|$|E
5000|$|Control {{examples}} - For example, function A may be <b>selective</b> <b>call</b> mode, while function B is the vibrate function. Function C monitors channel 2. D is {{the mode}} {{that is similar}} to a scanner. When the pager is turned on, eight short beeps are heard along with flashing of both LEDs. Holding down the reset button in <b>selective</b> <b>call</b> mode will monitor the channel for any transmission on that channel at that time, or pure static as the squelch is bypassed.|$|E
50|$|The Motorola Minitor is a portable, analog, receive only, voice pager {{typically}} {{carried by}} fire, rescue, and EMS personnel (both volunteer and career) to alert of emergencies. The Minitor, slightly {{smaller than a}} pack of cigarettes, is carried on a person and usually left in <b>selective</b> <b>call</b> mode. When the unit is activated, the pager sounds a tone alert, followed by an announcement from a dispatcher alerting the user of a situation. After activation, the pager remains in monitor mode much like a scanner, and monitors transmissions on that channel until the unit is reset back into <b>selective</b> <b>call</b> mode either manually, or automatically after a set period of time, depending on programming.|$|E
50|$|<b>Selective</b> <b>calling</b> {{is akin to}} the use of a lock on a door. A {{radio with}} carrier squelch is {{unlocked}} and will let any signal in. <b>Selective</b> <b>calling</b> locks out all signals except ones with the correct 'key', in this case a specific digital code. <b>Selective</b> <b>calling</b> systems can overlap; a radio may have (group call) and DTMF individual calling.|$|R
50|$|Tone squelch, {{or other}} forms of <b>selective</b> <b>calling,</b> is {{sometimes}} used to solve interference problems. Where more than one user is on the same channel (co-channel users), <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> addresses a subset of all receivers. Instead of turning on the receive audio for any signal, the audio turns on only {{in the presence of the}} correct <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> code. This is akin to the use of a lock on a door. A carrier squelch is unlocked and will let any signal in. <b>Selective</b> <b>calling</b> locks out all signals except ones with the correct key to the lock (the correct code).|$|R
50|$|In {{conventional}} systems, {{units are}} separated into groups by <b>selective</b> <b>calling.</b> Radios are usually segmented into customers with each customer {{on a separate}} <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> code. Systems may use continuous tone-coded squelch system for this purpose. A disadvantage is that conventional systems require the user to disable <b>selective</b> <b>calling,</b> (to monitor,) {{in order to see}} if another company is talking before using the channel. Conventional systems are usually analog FM.|$|R
50|$|The European {{system worked}} {{strictly}} in the 85-87, 150-170 {{and later on}} in the 450-512 MHz band and was based on the ZVEI codes. ZVEI is the abbreviation of Zentral Verband der Electrotechnischen Industrie West Germany (central union for the electro technical industry). This organization was responsible for a fixed industrial norm sequence of 5 <b>selective</b> <b>call</b> tones.|$|E
5000|$|Minitor pagers, {{depending}} on the model and application, can operate in the VHF Low Band, VHF High Band, and UHF frequency ranges. They are alerted by using two-tone sequential Selective calling, generally following the Motorola Quick Call II standard. In other words, the pager will activate when a particular series of audible tones are sent over the frequency (commonly {{referred to as a}} [...] "page") the pager is set to. For example, if a Minitor is programmed on VHF frequency channel 155.295 MHz and set to alert for 879 Hz & 358.6 Hz, it will disregard any other tone sequences transmitted on that frequency, only alerting when the proper sequence has been received. The pager may be reset back into its <b>selective</b> <b>call</b> mode by pressing the reset button, or it can be programmed to reset back into <b>selective</b> <b>call</b> mode automatically after a predetermined amount of time, to conserve battery power.|$|E
50|$|The {{operator}} would {{connect to}} the base station by cord board and key the five-digit number; in the 1990s, phone operators at TOPS positions would key the five digits after dialing the code to initiate the call and then identify the base station; a typical TOPS operator code would consist of a two digit sequence for voice-call or <b>selective</b> <b>call,</b> a three digit sequence for the base station, then the customer number.|$|E

50|$|In a conventional, analog {{two-way radio}} system, a {{standard}} radio has noise squelch or carrier squelch which allows a radio to receive all transmissions. <b>Selective</b> <b>calling</b> {{is used to}} address a subset of all two-way radios on a single radio frequency channel. Where more than one user is on the same channel, (co-channel users,) <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> can address a subset of all receivers or can direct a call to a single radio. <b>Selective</b> <b>calling</b> features fit into two major categories: individual calling and group calling. Individual calls generally have longer time-constants: it takes more air-time to call an individual radio unit than to call {{a large group of}} radios.|$|R

50|$|Newer Minitor pagers can scan two {{channels}} {{by selecting}} that function via a rotary knob on the pager; in this mode when using a Minitor III or IV the user will hear all traffic, {{even without the}} correct tones being sent. If the activation tones are transmitted in this monitor mode, the pager alerts as normal. Minitor Vs {{have the option to}} remain in monitor mode or in <b>selective</b> <b>call</b> mode when scanning two channels. Minitor IIIs and IVs only have the option to remain in monitor mode when scanning two channels.|$|E
5000|$|Selcall (Selective Calling) transmits a {{burst of}} up to five inband audio tones at the {{beginning}} of each transmission. This feature (sometimes called [...] "tone burst") is common in European systems. Early systems used one tone (commonly called [...] "Tone Burst"). Several tones were used, the most common being 1,750 Hz, which is still used in European amateur radio repeater systems. The addressing scheme provided by one tone was not enough, so a two tone system was devised - one tone followed by a second tone (sometimes called a [...] "1+1" [...] system). Later on, Motorola marketed a system called [...] "Quik-Call" [...] that used two simultaneous tones followed by two more simultaneous tones (sometimes called a [...] "2+2" [...] system) that was heavily used by fire department dispatch systems in the USA. Later <b>selective</b> <b>call</b> systems used paging system technology that made use of five sequential tones. In the same way that a single CTCSS tone would be used on an entire group of radios, a single five-tone sequence is used in a group of radios.|$|E

40|$|There {{are many}} {{problems}} associated with distributing an Ada program over a loosely coupled communication network. Some of these problems involve the {{various aspects of the}} distributed rendezvous. The problems addressed involve supporting the delay statement in a <b>selective</b> <b>call</b> and supporting the else clause in a <b>selective</b> <b>call.</b> Most of these difficulties are compounded by the need for an efficient communication system. The difficulties are compounded even more by considering the possibility of hardware faults occurring while the program is running. With a hardware fault tolerant computer system, it is possible to design a distribution scheme and communication software which is efficient and allows Ada semantics to be preserved. An Ada design for the communications software of one such system will be presented, including a description of the services provided in the seven layers of an International Standards Organization (ISO) Open System Interconnect (OSI) model communications system.

5000|$|In the US, Federal Communications Commission rules require {{users of}} <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> {{to monitor the}} channel (i.e. switch to carrier squelch) before transmitting. In other words, the user must monitor (listen) {{to make sure the}} channel is not in use by someone on another <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> code before transmitting. To enforce this rule, base {{stations}} often have a monitor switch on the microphone. The push-to-talk button is split into two segments. One segment turns the <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> off. The other segment of the button transmits. A mechanical interlock prevents the transmit button from being pressed until the monitor button is down. This is called, [...] "compulsory monitor before transmit." [...] In mobile radios, microphones are stored in a hang-up box. When the microphone is pulled out of the hang-up, the radio reverts to carrier squelch, (the <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> feature is disabled). The user automatically monitors—verifies no one else is using the channel—by pulling the mike out of the hang-up box. Hand-held radios sometimes have LED indicators that show when the channel is in use.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Selcal (selective calling) controller, as {{intermediate}} equipment between selcal and radio station, {{is designed to}} achieve the software automation and remote control in aviation. The whole system adopts msp- 430 microcontroller as hardware core and C language as the method of software realization. This paper focuses on hardware connection and design to introduce the electrical design and software flow of selcal controller.. OBJECTIVE AND SIGNIFICANCE Selcal, also know as ground-air selective calling device, {{has been used by}} land station for selective calling of aircraft. Each aircraft has a unique selective calling code, when the selective calling device calls an aircraft, the <b>selective</b> <b>call</b> code, which consists of two connected audio pulse, shall be entered firstly. Two single tones that transmitted simultaneously are contained in each pulse. Selcal code will be transmitted by the shortwave radio station when the CALL push-button is pressed. When this code is received by the appropriate aircraft, the communication between radio station and aircraft is established. Therefore voice transmission connection between the ground and the aircraft can be achieved by using a handle. Fig. 1 Conventional model of selective calling syste...|$|E
40|$|Display ads on the Internet are {{increasingly}} sold via ad exchanges such as RightMedia, AdECN and Doubleclick Ad Exchange. These exchanges allow real-time bidding, that is, {{each time the}} publisher contacts the exchange, the exchange ”calls out ” to solicit bids from ad networks. A major issue is the infrastructure mismatch: the volume of impressions that come to the ad exchange is very large, but participating ad networks may have resource constraints and can not participate in every auction. Therefore, the exchange has to select which subset to call out and solicit bids. This aspect of soliciting the bid is a novel aspect in comparison to ad allocation problems considered in literature. We view this <b>selective</b> <b>call</b> out as an online decision problem with bandwidth type constraints. We present an algorithm that runs in almost linear time per auction, and guarantees roughly at least 1 − 1 /e of the expected maximum market efficiency achievable by any algorithm that obeys the call out constraints, even with unlimited computational power and certain foreknowledge of the sequence of arriving ad slots (but the bids are still probabilistic). The analysis extend to other variants, {{such as in the}} posted price auction variant, where we provide a 1 approximation of the total revenue of the best posted price 2 algorithm that obeys the call-out constraints. We show that these results hold under different impression arrival models, and {{to the best of our}} knowledge, this aspect, in combination with bounded performance guarantees, had not been considered in the ad allocation literature. ...|$|E
40|$|Next, {{we compare}} {{procedures}} for certain feature scenarios. In the IS- 41 approach, features are handled in three ways: by the HLR upon receiving a LOCREQ, a serving MSC upon receiving a ROUTEREQ, {{or by the}} serving MSC upon receiving a connection setup message. For example, unconditional call forwarding and <b>selective</b> <b>call</b> acceptance are features handled by the HLR upon receiving a LOCREQ, call forwarding on busy is handled by the serving MSC during ROUTEREQ, and call forwarding on no-answer or no response to page are triggered at the serving MSC during connection setup. For features handled by the serving MSCs, only service triggers are downloaded. Any data associated with the service is retained in the HLR. For example, call forwarding on no-answer is triggered at the serving MSC if the user does not answer after connection is setup. However, the forwarded number is stored in the HLR. Retrieval of this data requires messaging to the HLR. This approach is well-suited for some features that have large amounts of associated data. For example, speed dial may require the HLR to download {{a large amount of}} data if the mobile user has a large database of numbers. Such downloading and subsequent movements to new VLRs as the end point moves will generate a high signaling load. The cost of extra messaging during call/connection setup delay may be a small penalty in comparison to this increased signaling load. On the other hand, for features with small amounts of data, such as a forwarded number for call forwarding on no-answer, the increased call/connection setup delay associated with increased messaging may be more costly than the increased signaling load caused by downloading thi...|$|E
