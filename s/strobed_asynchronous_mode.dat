40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{the effects of}} {{synchronous}} and <b>asynchronous</b> communication <b>mode</b> on electronic negotiations. By applying content analysis, we compare the negotiation processes of two e-negotiation simulations conducted in a synchronous and an <b>asynchronous</b> <b>mode.</b> Our results show significant differences in communication behavior of subjects. Synchronous negotiation mode leads to less friendly, more affective and more competitive negotiation behavior. <b>Asynchronous</b> communication <b>mode</b> leads to more exchange of private and task-oriented information and to a more friendly communication style. These results suggest that de-individuation and escalating effects might be caused by communication mode rather than by the ability of the media to transmit social cues. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a systematic study of two modes of program execution: synchronous and <b>asynchronous.</b> In synchronous <b>mode,</b> program components are tightly coupled. Traditional procedure call represents the synchronous execution <b>mode.</b> In <b>asynchronous</b> <b>mode,</b> program components execute independently of each other. Asynchronous message passing represents the <b>asynchronous</b> execution <b>mode.</b> The <b>asynchronous</b> <b>mode</b> of execution introduces communication overhead in {{the execution of}} program components. However it improves the temporal locality of data in a program by facilitating temporal and spatial reorganization of program components. Temporal reorganization refers to the batched execution of program components. Spatial reorganization refers to the scheduling of components on different processors {{in order to avoid}} the over-subscription of cache memory. Synchronous execution avoids the communication overhead. The goal of this study is to systematically understand the trade-offs associated with each execution mode and the effect of each mode on the throughput and the resource utilization of applications. The findings of this study help derive application designs for achieving high throughput in current and future multicore hardware...|$|R

30|$|Time-encoding {{circuits}} {{operate in}} an <b>asynchronous</b> <b>mode</b> {{and thus are}} very suitable for ultra-wideband applications. However, this <b>asynchronous</b> <b>mode</b> leads to nonuniform sampling that requires computationally complex decoding algorithms to recover the input signals. In the encoding and decoding process, many non-idealities in circuits and the computing system can affect the final signal recovery. In this article, {{the sources of the}} distortion are analyzed for proper parameter setting. In the analysis, the decoding problem is generalized as a function approximation problem. The characteristics of the bases used in existing algorithms are examined. These bases typically require long time support to reach good frequency property. Long time support not only increases computation complexity, but also increases approximation error when the signal is reconstructed through short patches. Hence, a new approximation basis, the Gaussian basis, which is more compact both in time and frequency domain, is proposed. The reconstruction results from different bases under different parameter settings are compared.|$|R
