5|$|According to a {{study by}} Dr. Nguyen Viet Nhan, {{children}} in the areas where Agent Orange was used have been affected and have multiple health problems, including cleft palate, mental disabilities, hernias, and extra fingers and toes. In the 1970s, high levels of dioxin were found in the breast milk of South Vietnamese women, and in the blood of U.S. military personnel who had <b>served</b> <b>in</b> <b>Vietnam.</b> The most affected zones are the mountainous area along Truong Son (Long Mountains) and the border between Vietnam and Cambodia. The affected residents are living in substandard conditions with many genetic diseases.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} four years all three of the regiment's {{operational}} squadrons eventually <b>served</b> <b>in</b> <b>Vietnam,</b> providing invaluable close support to the infantry, particularly during the clearance of Viet Cong bunker systems. Although their value in Vietnam was originally questioned by some, they proved a powerful weapon in both offence and defence, and were responsible for limiting infantry casualties. The Centurions were able to move through the countryside more easily than expected and although they were vulnerable to anti-tank weapons and mines, their firepower and shock action had a decisive effect on the battlefield. The tanks {{played a significant role in}} the Battle of Coral–Balmoral in May and June 1968.|$|E
5|$|Ships of the Royal Australian Navy were {{stationed}} on continuous operational service in Vietnam between 1965 and 1972; a total 18 ships <b>served</b> <b>in</b> <b>Vietnam</b> waters during the war. During this period, the Navy performed {{a wide variety}} of operational tasks at sea, ashore, and in the air. The RAN's primary contribution consisted of destroyers, Fleet Air Arm personnel attached to a United States Army helicopter company and No. 9 Squadron RAAF, a Clearance Diving Team, and a logistical support force consisting of transport and escort ships. Other RAN personnel served ashore in medical teams or performed staff duties at the Australian Embassy in Saigon or the 1st Australian Task Force Headquarters at Nui Dat.|$|E
50|$|In 1965, Elwell left Secaucus to <b>serve</b> <b>in</b> the U.S. Army {{during the}} Vietnam War. His Army unit, the 173rd Airborne Brigade, {{was the first}} major ground combat unit to <b>serve</b> <b>in</b> <b>Vietnam.</b>|$|R

The Centurions were able to move through the countryside more easily than expected and although they were vulnerable to anti-tank weapons and mines, their firepower and shock action had a decisive effect on the battlefield. In late-May 1968 the tanks {{played a significant role in}} the Battle of Coral–Balmoral. Occupying blocking positions in an attempt to thwart an impending communist offensive aimed at influencing the peace-talks, 1ATF deployed two battalions away from its base in Phuoc Tuy, subsequently developing Fire Support Base Coral north-east of Saigon, just east of Lai Khe on 12 May.|$|E
5|$|Australia's growing {{involvement}} in Vietnam reflected the American build up. In 1963, the Australian government had committed a small advisory team, {{known as the}} Australian Army Training Team Vietnam (AATTV), to help train the South Vietnamese forces. However, in June 1965 the decision to commit ground troops was made, and the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment—originally commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Ivan 'Lou' Brumfield—was dispatched. Supporting 1 RAR was 1 Troop, A Squadron, 4th/19th Prince of Wales's Light Horse equipped with M-113 Armoured Personnel Carriers, artillery from 105th Field Battery, Royal Australian Artillery and 161st Field Battery, Royal New Zealand Artillery, and 161st Reconnaissance Flight operating Cessna 180s and Bell H-13 Sioux light observation helicopters; in total 1,400 personnel. The Australian and New Zealand units were attached to the US 173rd Airborne Brigade {{under the command of}} Brigadier General Ellis W. Williamson in Bien Hoa and operated throughout the III Corps Tactical Zone to help establish the Bien Hoa-Vung Tau enclave. Although logistics and resupply were primarily provided by the Americans, a small logistic unit—1st Australian Logistics Company—was situated at Bien Hoa airbase. Unlike later Australian units that <b>served</b> <b>in</b> <b>Vietnam,</b> which included conscripts, 1 RAR was manned by regular personnel only.|$|E

50|$|However {{some would}} {{claim that the}} US and South Vietnamese actions <b>in</b> the <b>Vietnam</b> War would {{constitute}} “aggressive warfare” {{by the standards of}} Nuremberg. Taylor points out that the definition of “aggressive warfare” is ambiguous, thus severely hindering any attempt to determine which of the belligerent powers involved <b>in</b> the <b>Vietnam</b> War could be deemed the “aggressor.” What’s more, such ambiguities lead to several related questions, such as the legality of refusing to <b>serve</b> <b>in</b> <b>Vietnam.</b> At the time, many conscientious objectors refused to <b>serve</b> <b>in</b> <b>Vietnam</b> on the grounds that their complicity in an illegal war made them, by implication, guilty of crimes against humanity.|$|R

25|$|Dennehy {{enlisted in}} the United States Marine Corps in 1958 and served in Okinawa until 1963. In {{numerous}} interviews, Dennehy {{claimed to be a}} Vietnam veteran who served a five-year tour there and recounted harrowing tales of combat, but according to the book Stolen Valor, Dennehy never <b>served</b> <b>in</b> <b>Vietnam</b> and never saw active combat. The author of Stolen Valor wrote to Dennehy regarding the discrepancy, but received no reply from the actor, although Dennehy later admitted {{in an interview that he}} had lied about his service and apologized for it.|$|E
50|$|Bacon <b>served</b> <b>in</b> the <b>Vietnam</b> War as a Green Beret during 1968-1969. He {{was trained}} as a combat medic. He is remembered as a skinny man with very wide shoulders, a {{piercing}} stare from under the brim of an ugly floppy hat, and a reputation for eccentricity. His linguistic talent led him to master Vietnamese and the Bru tribal language while <b>serving</b> <b>in</b> <b>Vietnam.</b> At one time, he served on Recon Team Sidewinder of MACV-SOG.|$|R
5000|$|Rick Jason served from 1943 to 1945 in the U.S. Army Air Corps, during World War II. [...] In {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, he visited American troops <b>serving</b> <b>in</b> <b>Vietnam</b> on several USO tours.|$|R
5000|$|American women <b>serving</b> <b>in</b> <b>Vietnam</b> {{were subject}} to {{societal}} stereotypes. Many Americans either considered females <b>serving</b> <b>in</b> <b>Vietnam</b> masculine for living under the army discipline, or judged them to be women of questionable moral character who enlisted {{for the sole purpose}} of seducing men. To address this problem, the ANC released advertisements portraying women in the ANC as [...] "proper, professional and well protected." [...] (26) This effort to highlight the positive aspects of a nursing career reflected the ideas of second-wave feminism that occurred during the 1960s-1970s in the United States. Although female military nurses lived in a heavily male environment, very few cases of sexual harassment were ever reported.|$|R
