5|$|The matter {{ended in}} court, {{concerning}} if Autolink {{should be allowed}} to take control over four train radios that were located in locomotives owned by Autolink, but operated by Ofotbanen. In a <b>shareholder</b> <b>agreement</b> between Autolink and Rail Management, the ownership of the train radios had been transferred to Autolink, but the agreement has clauses that specified that Autolink could not start a competing railway company. Stating that Autolink had been disloyal with regard to the contract, Ofoten District Court ruled on 17 July 2008 against Autolink's demand for an interim order to transfer the possession of the radios to Autolink. The court ruled that an interim decision could not be made due to the complexity of the contracts, and that a normal lawsuit would have to be carried out to determine the matter. The parties agreed that Autolink, on 13 February 2008, had bought five shunters from Ofotbanen for NOK 12 million, of which NOK 9.5 million was paid by Autolink deleting debt. On 18 September, Autolink won the appeal in Hålogaland Court of Appeal, where Ofotbanen was convicted of stealing four radios.|$|E
