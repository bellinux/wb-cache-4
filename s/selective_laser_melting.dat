25|$|Many, perhaps most, {{threaded}} parts {{have potential}} to be generated via additive manufacturing (3D printing), {{of which there are}} many variants, including fused deposition modeling, selective laser sintering, direct metal laser sintering, <b>selective</b> <b>laser</b> <b>melting,</b> electron beam melting, layered object manufacturing, and stereolithography. For most additive technologies, it has not been long since they emerged from the laboratory end of their historical development, but further commercialization is picking up speed. To date, most additive methods tend to produce a rough surface finish and tend to be restricted in the material properties that they can produce, and thus their earliest commercial victories have been in parts for which those restrictions were acceptable. However, the capabilities are continually growing.|$|E
25|$|AM {{processes}} for metal sintering or melting (such as selective laser sintering, direct metal laser sintering, and <b>selective</b> <b>laser</b> <b>melting)</b> usually went {{by their own}} individual names in the 1980s and 1990s. At the time, all metalworking was done by processes that we now call non-additive (casting, fabrication, stamping, and machining); although plenty of automation was applied to those technologies (such as by robot welding and CNC), {{the idea of a}} tool or head moving through a 3D work envelope transforming a mass of raw material into a desired shape layer by layer was associated in metalworking only with processes that removed metal (rather than adding it), such as CNC milling, CNC EDM, and many others. But the automated techniques that added metal, which would later be called additive manufacturing, were beginning to challenge that assumption. By the mid-1990s, new techniques for material deposition were developed at Stanford and Carnegie Mellon University, including microcasting and sprayed materials. Sacrificial and support materials had also become more common, enabling new object geometries.|$|E

In order to further investigate this statement <b>selective</b> <b>laser</b> <b>melted</b> AlSi 10 Mg samples were subject to multiple post-heat-treatments. Subsequently, the surface hardness and tensile strength was determined and compared with the as-built results.

2500|$|Nd:YAG lasers {{are used}} in {{manufacturing}} for engraving, etching, or marking a variety of metals and plastics, or for metal surface enhancement processes like laser peening. They are extensively used in manufacturing for cutting and welding steel, semiconductors and various alloys. For automotive applications (cutting and welding steel) the power levels are typically 1–5kW. [...] Super alloy drilling (for gas turbine parts) typically uses pulsed Nd:YAG lasers (millisecond pulses, not Q-switched). Nd:YAG lasers are also employed to make subsurface markings in transparent materials such as glass or acrylic glass. [...] Lasers of up to 2kW are used for <b>selective</b> <b>laser</b> <b>melting</b> of metals in additive layered manufacturing. In aerospace applications, {{they can be used}} to drill cooling holes for enhanced air flow/heat exhaust efficiency.|$|E
2500|$|Some methods melt or {{soften the}} {{material}} to produce the layers. In Fused filament fabrication, also known as Fused deposition modeling (FDM), the model or part is produced by extruding small beads or streams of material which harden immediately to form layers. A filament of thermoplastic, metal wire, or other material is fed into an extrusion nozzle head (3D printer extruder), which heats the material and turns the flow on and off. FDM is somewhat restricted in the variation of shapes that may be fabricated. Another technique fuses parts of the layer and then moves upward in the working area, adding another layer of granules and repeating the process until the piece has built up. This process uses the unfused media to support overhangs and thin walls in the part being produced, which reduces the need for temporary auxiliary supports for the piece. Laser sintering techniques include selective laser sintering, with both metals and polymers, and direct metal laser sintering. <b>Selective</b> <b>laser</b> <b>melting</b> does not use sintering for the fusion of powder granules but will completely melt the powder using a high-energy laser to create fully dense materials in a layer-wise method that has mechanical properties {{similar to those of}} conventional manufactured metals. Electron beam melting is a similar type of additive manufacturing technology for metal parts (e.g. titanium alloys). EBM manufactures parts by melting metal powder layer by layer with an electron beam in a high vacuum. Another method consists of an inkjet 3D printing system, which creates the model one layer at a time by spreading a layer of powder (plaster, or resins) and printing a binder in the cross-section of the part using an inkjet-like process. With laminated object manufacturing, thin layers are cut to shape and joined together. [...] Other methods cure liquid materials using different sophisticated technologies, such as stereolithography. Photopolymerization is primarily used in stereolithography to produce a solid part from a liquid. Inkjet printer systems like the Objet PolyJet system spray photopolymer materials onto a build tray in ultra-thin layers (between 16 and 30µm) until the part is completed. Each photopolymer layer is cured with UV light after it is jetted, producing fully cured models that can be handled and used immediately, without post-curing. Ultra-small features can be made with the 3D micro-fabrication technique used in multiphoton photopolymerisation. Due to the nonlinear nature of photo excitation, the gel is cured to a solid only in the places where the laser was focused while the remaining gel is then washed away. Feature sizes of under 100nm are easily produced, as well as complex structures with moving and interlocked parts. Yet another approach uses a synthetic resin that is solidified using LEDs. In Mask-image-projection-based stereolithography, a 3D digital model is sliced by a set of horizontal planes. Each slice is converted into a two-dimensional mask image. The mask image is then projected onto a photocurable liquid resin surface and light is projected onto the resin to cure it {{in the shape of the}} layer. Continuous liquid interface production begins with a pool of liquid photopolymer resin. Part of the pool bottom is transparent to ultraviolet light (the [...] "window"), which causes the resin to solidify. The object rises slowly enough to allow resin to flow under and maintain contact with the bottom of the object. [...] In powder-fed directed-energy deposition, a high-power laser is used to melt metal powder supplied to the focus of the laser beam. The powder fed directed energy process is similar to Selective Laser Sintering, but the metal powder is applied only where material is being added to the part at that moment.|$|E

40|$|Maraging {{steel is}} an iron-nickel steel alloy which {{achieves}} its superior strength, hardness and toughness by aging the martensite phase. In earlier investigations, however, the toughness of <b>selective</b> <b>laser</b> <b>melted</b> (SLM) and subsequent aged maraging steel {{was found to}} be low. Several authors attribute this to the large oxides present in the finished product. In this work, the origin for these oxides is investigated by using microscopy and spectroscopy. The analysis is done on specimens produced under different processing conditions and the most important characteristics of the inclusions are discussed. It is found that during the SLM process, an oxide layer containing Al and Ti is created on top of each layer. Upon melting the next layer, the oxide layer is broken and dragged further. Therefore, accumulations of oxide material are found in the final product as large, irregularly shaped inclusions. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the transverse rupture strength and apparent hardness of <b>selective</b> <b>laser</b> <b>melted</b> Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloys manufactured in the vertical (V) and horizontal (H) directions. The microstructure and the distribution of alloy elements were examined by optical microscope and electron probe microanalysis, respectively. The results show that the columnar α′ grains are formed along the building direction, and the elemental distributions of Ti, Al, and V are homogeneous in the alloy. The building direction does not sufficiently affect the density and apparent hardness. However, the transverse rupture strengths (TRS) are obviously dominated by the building directions investigated in this study. The TRS of an H specimen is significantly superior to that of a V specimen by 48 %. This phenomenon can be mainly attributed to the presence of disc-shaped pores...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{research}} on the additive manufacturing (AM) of Ti alloys {{has shown that the}} mechanical properties of the parts are affected by the characteristic microstructure that originates from the AM process. To understand the effect of the microstructure on the tensile properties, <b>selective</b> <b>laser</b> <b>melted</b> (SLM) Ti– 6 Al– 4 V samples built in three different orientations were tensile tested. The investigated samples were near fully dense, in two distinct conditions, as-built and stress relieved. It was found that the build orientation affects the tensile properties, and in particular the ductility of the samples. The mechanical anisotropy of the parts was discussed in relation to the crystallographic texture, phase composition and the predominant fracture mechanisms. Fractography and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) results indicate that the predominant fracture mechanism is intergranular fracture present along the grain boundaries and thus provide and explain the typical fracture surface features observed in fracture AM Ti– 6 Al– 4 V...|$|R
40|$|The {{fracture}} toughness (K 1 c) and fatigue {{crack growth rate}} (FCGR) properties of <b>selective</b> <b>laser</b> <b>melted</b> (SLM) specimens produced from grade 5 Ti 6 Al 4 V powder metal has been investigated. Three specimen orientations relative to the build direction {{as well as two}} different post-build heat treatments were considered. Specimens and test procedures were designed in accordance with ASTM E 399 and ASTM E 647 standard. The results show that there is a strong influence of post-build processing (heat treated versus ‘as built’) as well as specimen orientation on the dynamic behaviour of SLM produced Ti 6 Al 4 V. The greatest improvement in properties after heat treatment was demonstrated when the fracture plane is perpendicular to the SLM build direction. This behaviour is attributed to the higher anticipated influence of tensile residual stress for this orientation. The transformation of the initial rapidly solidified microstructure during heat treatment has a smaller beneficial effect on improving mechanical properties. status: publishe...|$|R

Machinability {{characteristics such as}} tool wear, cutting forces, and machined surface quality were investigated. Coating delamination, adhesion, abrasion, attrition, and chipping wear mechanisms were dominant during machining of SLM Ti- 6 Al- 4 V. Maximum flank wear was found higher in machining SLM Ti- 6 Al- 4 V compared to wrought Ti- 6 Al- 4 V at all speeds. It was also found that high machining speeds lead to catastrophic failure of the cutting tool during machining of SLM Ti- 6 Al- 4 V. Cutting force was higher in machining SLM Ti- 6 Al- 4 V as compared to wrought Ti- 6 Al- 4 V for all cutting speeds due to its higher strength and hardness.

40|$|The present article {{studied the}} effect of {{ultrasonic}} surface rolling process (USRP) on the microstructure and wear behavior of a <b>selective</b> <b>laser</b> <b>melted</b> Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy. Surface characteristics were investigated using optical microscope, nano-indentation, scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope and laser scanning confocal microscope. Results indicated that the thickness of pore-free surfaces increased to 100 ~ 200 μm with the increasing ultrasonic surface rolling numbers. Severe work hardening occurred in the densified layer, resulting {{in the formation of}} refined grains, dislocation walls and deformation twins. After 1000 N 6 passes, about 15. 5 % and 14. 1 % increment in surficial Nano-hardness and Vickers-hardness was obtained, respectively. The hardness decreased gradually from the top surface to the substrate. Wear tests revealed that the friction coefficient declined from 0. 74 (polished surface) to 0. 64 (USRP treated surface) and the wear volume reduced from 0. 205 mm− 3 to 0. 195 mm− 3.

Much of the pioneering work with <b>selective</b> <b>laser</b> <b>melting</b> technologies is on lightweight parts for aerospace where traditional manufacturing constraints, such as tooling and physical access to surfaces for machining, restrict the design of components.

We evaluated bone regeneration, bone quality and mechanical strength of grafted femora using in vivo and ex vivo ?CT scanning, histology, and torsion testing.
