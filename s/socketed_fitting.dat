40|$|Introduction: This {{observational}} study compared historical costs for provision of socket prostheses with simulated costs for bone-anchored prostheses (BAPs). Materials and Methods: The costs of transfemoral socket prostheses and BAP were {{extracted from the}} Queensland Artificial Limb Service's regulatory documentation according to K-levels and estimated for low-cost, budget, and high-cost limb options. Total costs including labor and parts after 6 -year funding cycles were cross-compared for each <b>socket</b> and BAP <b>fitting</b> option. Results: Labor and attachment costs were reduced by 18 % and 79 %, respectively, for all BAP options compared with any <b>socket</b> <b>fitting.</b> BAP was more economical by $ 18, 200, $ 7, 000, and $ 1, 600 when fitted with low-cost, budget, and high-cost options, respectively, compared with sockets for K 4. The low-cost limb was the only economical option compared with all sockets above K 2. Other BAP options were uneconomical compared with <b>socket</b> <b>fitting</b> below K 4. Discussion: Suppliers of conventional prosthetic components can strongly impact the overall costs. Interestingly, manufacturers of BAP could play a decisive role given the cost of specific parts (e. g., connectors, protective devices). Conclusions: The proposed approach for cost assessments could assist funding organizations worldwide working toward the development of fair and equitable financial assistance programs for individuals choosing BAP...|$|R
40|$|Objective: It {{has been}} {{recognised}} {{in a review}} of the developments of lower-limb prosthetic <b>socket</b> <b>fitting</b> processes that the future demands new tools to aid in <b>socket</b> <b>fitting.</b> This paper presents the results of research to design and clinically test an artificial intelligence approach, specifically inverse problem analysis, for the determination of the pressures at the limb/prosthetic socket interface during stance and ambulation. Methods: Inverse problem analysis is based on accurately calculating the external loads or boundary conditions that can generate a known amount of strain, stresses or displacements at pre-determined locations on a structure. In this study a backpropagation artificial neural network (ANN) is designed and validated to predict the interfacial pressures at the residual limb/socket interface from strain data collected from the socket surface. The subject of this investigation was a 45 -year-old male unilateral trans-tibial (below-knee) traumatic amputee who had been using a prosthesis for 22 years. Results: When comparing the ANN predicted interfacial pressure on 16 patches within the socket with actual pressures applied to the socket there is shown to be 8. 7 % difference, validating the methodology. Investigation of varying axial load through the subject’s prosthesis, alignment of the subject’s prosthesis, and pressure at the limb/socket interface during walking demonstrates that the validated ANN is able to give an accurate full-field study of the static and dynamic interfacial pressure distribution. Conclusions: To conclude, a methodology has been developed that enables a prosthetist to quantitatively analyse the distribution of pressures within the prosthetic socket in a clinical environment. This will aid in facilitating the “right first time” approach to <b>socket</b> <b>fitting</b> which will benefit both the patient in terms of comfort and the prosthetist, by reducing the time and associated costs of providing a high level of socket fit...|$|R
40|$|The design, construction, {{and fitting}} of {{artificial}} limbs remain {{to this day}} an art, dependent on the accumulated expertise of the practitioner/prosthetist. <b>Socket</b> <b>fitting</b> is cost ineffective, time consuming, {{and a source of}} inconvenience for the amputee. Stumpskin slippage within the socket can cause discomfort, internal limb pain, and eventually skin ulcers as a result of excessive pressure and shear within the socket. This study presents a new method of assessment of three-dimensional (3 D) socketstump kinematics/slippage of strenuous activities using Biplane Dynamic Roentgen Stereogrammetric Analysis instrumentation. Ten below knee amputees participated in the study. A more holistic representation of the downward slippage trend of all proximal side skin markers with respect to the socket, and an even more characteristic and of higher magnitude downward-and anterioposterior slippage (maximum slippage: 151 mm for the fast-stop task and 19 mm for the step-down task) between the distal markers after impact, was possible for both tasks for all amputees. Displacement between skin-to-skin marker pairs reached maximum values of approximately 10 mm for the step-down trials and up to 24 mm for the fast stop trials. Maximum skin strain was dependent on the position of the skin markers. Distally positioned skin marker pairs demonstrated mainly anterioposterior displacement between each other (maximum relative strain: 13 to 14). Maximum relative strain for the proximal markers was 8 to 10.

A comparison of the predicted pressure distribution found using the HIPE, at the limb/socket interface of a patient in a clinical environment with photoelastic data of the actual pressure distribution, further indicated the technique’s potential benefits.

Two F-socket sensors arrays were attached to the residual limb.

Conversely, while using air splint socket, the socket was able to auto-adjust for required <b>socket</b> <b>fitting</b> even for any change while doing shoulder movements.

Understanding the science of three-dimensional (3 D) dynamic coupling at the residuum/socket interface could potentially aid the design and <b>fitting</b> of the <b>socket.</b> A new method has been developed to characterise the 3 D dynamic coupling at the residuum/socket interface using 3 D motion capture based on a single case study of a trans-femoral amputee. The new model incorporated a Virtual Residuum Segment (VRS) and a Socket Segment (SS) which combined to form the residuum/socket interface. Angular and axial couplings between the two segments were subsequently determined. Results indicated a non-rigid angular coupling in excess of 10 ° in the quasi-sagittal plane and an axial coupling of between 21 - 35 mm. The corresponding angular couplings of less than 4 ° and 2 ° were estimated in the quasi-coronal and quasi-transverse plane, respectively.

It provides practical means of measuring pressure and shear stresses simultaneously. In particular, {{it comprises of}} a flexible frame (20 mm × 20 mm), with thickness of 4 mm. By employing rapid prototyping technology in its fabrication, it offers a low-cost and versatile solution, with capability of adopting bespoke shapes of lower-limb residua.

The results validate that the sensor is capable of monitoring both pressure and shear at stresses up to 350 kPa and 80 kPa, respectively. A post-signal processing model is developed to induce pressure and shear stresses, respectively. The effective separation of pressure and shear signals can be potentially advantageous for sensor calibration in clinical applications. The sensor also demonstrates high linearity (approx. 5 – 8 %) and high pressure (approx. 1. 3 kPa) and shear (approx. 0. 6 kPa) stress resolution performance.

40|$|The {{suspension}} system and <b>socket</b> <b>fitting</b> of artificial limbs have major roles and vital {{effects on the}} comfort, mobility, and satisfaction of amputees. This paper introduces a new pneumatic {{suspension system}} that overcomes the drawbacks of current suspension systems in donning and doffing, change in volume during daily activities, and pressure distribution in the socket-stump interface. An air pneumatic suspension system (APSS) for total-contact sockets was designed and developed. Pistoning and pressure distribution in the socket-stump interface were tested for the new APSS. More than 95 % of the area between each prosthetic socket and liner was measured using a Tekscan F-Scan pressure measurement which has developed matrix-based pressure sensing systems. The variance in pressure around the stump was 8. 76 kPa. APSS exhibits less pressure concentration around the stump, improved pressure distribution, easy donning and doffing, adjustability to remain fitted to the socket during daily activities, and more adaptability to the changes in stump volume. The volume changes were adjusted by utility of air pressure sensor. The vertical displacement point and reliability of suspension were assessed using a photographic method. The optimum pressure in every level of loading weight was 55 kPa, and the maximum displacement was 6 mm when 90 N of weight was loaded...|$|R
40|$|Current {{literature}} {{focusing on}} the prosthetic socket is limited by measurement techniques and modeling assumptions, leading to a limited understanding of the forces and motions occurring between the residual limb and prosthesis {{and how they can}} be used to influence <b>socket</b> design and <b>fitting.</b> Prosthetic <b>socket</b> <b>fitting</b> and prescription would benefit from an elegant method for comparing socket designs. This dissertation focuses on {{the development and implementation of}} a 3 D motion capture model and a Slip Detection Sensor to quantify rotations and translations at the prosthetic socket-residual limb interface. The 3 D motion capture model defines the residual limb bone position inside the prosthetic socket which allows for measurement of the movement occurring at the prosthetic socket interface. The Slip Detection Sensor is an optoelectronic sensor embedded into the prosthetic socket wall to measure the amount of socket slip occurring between the socket wall and the residual limb skin surface. The motion capture model and Slip Detection Sensor were used to measure motion at the socket interface of transhumeral amputees during activities of daily living. Data were collected on six transhumeral amputees in the University of South Florida 2 ̆ 7 s (USF) motion analysis laboratory. One of the participants completed the collection procedures twice using two different suspension systems (pin locking versus no pin locking) within the same socket. An eight camera Vicon (Oxord, UK) motion capture system was used to collect kinematic data for each participant during the repetition of a series of range of motion (RoM) and activities of daily living (ADL). The RoM tasks included shoulder flexion/extension, shoulder abduction/adduction, shoulder rotation, and elbow flexion. The ADL tasks included a bilateral and unilateral lifting task at various weight increments, modified box and blocks test, folding a towel, and walk and carry a gallon jug of water. The impact of donning the prosthesis on the participant 2 ̆ 7 s RoM and the amount of socket movement during the ADL tasks was analyzed. The results show that the participant 2 ̆ 7 s shoulder RoM significantly decreased while wearing their prosthesis compared to when they were not wearing their prosthesis. The anterior-posterior tilt, medial-lateral tilt, and socket vertical translation were more directly correlated with the amount of residual limb movement than with the force acting on the prosthetic hand. Socket slip was most directly correlated with the force acting on the prosthetic hand. The results also show that the amount of translation was reduced when the pin locking suspension was used compared to when it wasn 2 ̆ 7 t for the individual participant who used both suspension systems within the same socket. The motion capture data were used to determine the amount of socket movement during activities of daily living while avoiding many of the limitations of other socket interface studies. The Slip Detection Sensor provided experimental data on the amount of slip occurring between the residual limb skin surface and socket wall. This method seems to be a useful tool for evaluating socket performance in terms of movement. Ultimately, socket interface movement data can be used to providing clinicians with quantitative results of a good socket fit to aid in the <b>socket</b> <b>fitting</b> and prescription process and incorporated into adjustable interfaces.

40|$|Background: The {{method of}} {{attachment}} of prosthesis to the residual limb (suspension) and <b>socket</b> <b>fitting</b> is a critical issue {{in the process of}} providing an amputee with prosthesis. Different suspension methods try to minimize the pistoning movement inside the socket. The Seal-In (R) X 5 and Dermo (R) Liner by Ossur are new suspension liners that intend to reduce pistoning between the socket and liner. Since the effects of these new liners on suspension are unclear, the objective {{of this study was to}} compare the pistoning effect of Seal-In (R) X 5 and Dermo (R) Liner by using Vicon Motion System. Methods: Six transtibial amputees, using both the Iceross Seal-In (R) X 5 and the Iceross Demo (R) Liner, participated in the study. The vertical displacement (pistoning) was measured between the liner and socket in single limb support on the prosthetic limb (full-weight bearing), double limb support (semi-weight bearing), and non-weight bearing on the prosthetic limb, and also under three static vertical loading conditions (30 N. 60 N, and 90 N). Findings: The results demonstrated that the pistoning within the socket when Seal-In (R) X 5 was used, decreased by 71 in comparison to the Iceross Dermo (R) Liner. In addition, a significant difference between the two liners under different static conditions was found (p< 0. 05). Interpretation: Participants needed to put in extra effort for donning and doffing the prosthesis with Seal-In (R) X 5; however, this type of liner provided less pistoning.

40|$|Lower limb {{prosthetic}} socket {{provides the}} interface {{for the transfer}} of loads between {{the ground and the}} stump. During daily physical activities, the stump has to endure mechanical stresses in normal (pressure) and tangential (shear) directions to the stump/socket interface, both of which may cause discomfort, pain, and a host of stump health problems. Despite the importance of the issues, there is currently no clinically-friendly sensor technology available to monitor both pressure and shear at the stump/socket interface. In this thesis, two sensor systems were developed - both capable of simultaneously measuring dynamic pressure and shear at the lower limb stump/socket interface. In particular, two thin, capacitive sensors based on flexible elastomers (3 D-printed and silicone) were designed and fabricated. To acquire sensor signals, appropriate data acquisition circuitries and PC software were produced. A viscoelastic model for real-time processing of the sensor signals was developed, to improve their dynamic response. The sensor systems were characterised in research lab settings, and their performance was verified against comprehensive design requirements. The characterised sensor systems were validated at the stump/socket interface in a series of amputee walking tests, and a range of clinical factors were investigated. Pressure and shear were measured at up to three discrete locations of a trans-femoral stump. Their temporal profiles when walking on level and inclined surfaces were obtained. The results suggest that ankle flexion resistance may have an effect on both the magnitudes and the temporal profiles of pressure and shear at the stump/socket interface. The thesis delivers a tool for measuring pressure and shear at the stump/socket interface in a clinically-friendly manner. What is more, it contributes to the prosthetic field by bringing an insight into the pressure and shear at the trans-femoral stump/socket interface, thus enhancing the understanding of its biomechanics.

Also a gap between the tube end and the stop in the fitting, due to the tube not having been cut to the correct length and fully inserted into the <b>socket</b> of the <b>fitting,</b> can also induce turbulence in the water stream.|$|R

40|$|Transtibial {{amputation}} patients need prosthetic {{devices in}} order to regain their functional mobility and appearance. The socket and its design {{play a significant role}} in determining the wearer’s quality of the fit [...] Prosthetic users experience pressure between the socket and residual limb during daily activities. The underlying soft tissues and skin of the residual limb are not accustomed to weight bearing; thus, there is the risk of degenerative tissue ulcer in the residual limb because of constant or repetitive peak pressure applied by the socket. The prosthetic users experience different pathways such as level ground, ramps, stairs and other uneven surfaces during their daily activities. An amputee is greatly affected when dealing with the environmental barriers such as slopes and stairs because of the reported high interface pressure between socket and residual limb. The interface pressure between the residual limb and prosthetic socket has a significant effect on an amputee’s satisfaction and comfort. Suspension system and <b>socket</b> <b>fitting</b> in prosthetic devices significantly affect the amputee’s comfort, mobility, and satisfaction. Prosthetic users required a comfortable liner, good suspension, and quality socket to avoid skin problems and to prevent discomfort while using the prosthesis for daily activities. Liners provide a comfortable interface by adding a soft cushion between the residual limb and the socket. Dermo and Seal-In X 5 liners are two new interface systems and, due to their relative infancy, no literature were found about their interface pressure during level walking as well as stairs and ramp negotiations and their effect on patient’s satisfaction. Therefore, the objectives of this study was to compare the interface pressure for these two liners during level walking as well as stairs and ramp negotiations and their effect on patients satisfaction and to compare it with the most common liner in today use (Pelite liner) and its effect on patient’s satisfaction and perceived problems. In addition, investigation were carried out on the effect of suspension system on patient satisfaction and perceived problems associated with thethree liners. The selection of good prosthetic liner presents a challenging task in amputee rehabilitation. Two prostheses were fabricated for each of the 10 amputees, one with the Seal-In X 5 liner and one with the Dermo liner for comparison between Dermo, Pelite, and Seal-In X 5 liners, 60 prostheses were fabricated. Interface pressure was measured during level walking, stairs and ramp negotiations. Each subject filled in a Prosthetic Evaluation Questionnaire (PEQ) questionnaire regarding his satisfaction with the three liners. Mean Peak Pressure (MPP) was significantly (P< 0. 05) low with Dermo liner during level walking as well as stairs and ramp negotiations compared with Seal-In X 5 Liner. Participants were significantly (P< 0. 05) satisfied and fewer problems were recorded with Dermo liner compared with Seal-In X 5 and Pelite liners. Hence, it can be concluded that the Dermo liner provides more comfortable socket-residual limb interface than the Seal-In X 5 liner and showed that the Dermo liner is the best choice for transtibial users. However, despite these results, the Seal-In X 5 liner offers better suspension. These results will help the clinicians and prosthetic practitioners in selecting of prosthetic liners and will also help the clinician in the fabricating of a good comfortable socket for transtibial users. three liners.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{demonstrate}} how the psychophysical theory of signal detection (SDT) can be applied to the process of <b>fitting</b> <b>sockets</b> and used to model the ability of patients to make judgments concerning the expectation of discomfort problems when uncertainty exists. For experimental purposes, a signal was defined as the ability of a patient to detect aspects of socket geometry that could lead to discomfort or tissue breakdown after initial fitting. An experiment was designed that consisted of varying the check socket geometries for three transtibial amputees by inserting 1. 6 -mm and 2. 6 -mm thick wafers at the distal tibia and fibula head and asking the subjects to report the degree of certainty they had regarding the discomfort the socket might produce after a day of use. In addition, psychophysical category ratio scales were used to measure the magnitudes of the pressure, discomfort, and pain perceived by the subjects for each experimental condition. Two of the subjects were experienced prosthesis users, and the third was an inexperienced individual in the process of being fitted for a first temporary prosthesis. One experienced subject indicated with maximum certainty that any alteration which reduced relief at the distal tibia and fibula head by even 0. 6 mm, the thinnest insert in the experiment (a pressure-sensing element), would produce intolerable discomfort. However, the other two subjects provided good experimental data representing a range of uncertainties, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were fitted to their responses. The curves for the inexperienced subject for the weakest signals presented (1. 6 -mm thickness) indicated performance no better than pure guessing, but performance improved for the thicker wafers (2. 6 -mm thickness). The ROC curves for the remaining experienced subject indicated much less uncertainty with the thinnest wafer and nearly perfect signal detection for the thicker wafer. Possible explanations for these results are presented. The paper also discusses how the probabilities associated with the four possible outcomes of the judgment task—hit, miss, correct rejection, and false alarm—are dependent on the relative costs and benefits of the outcomes...|$|R
