5|$|Immediately {{after the}} Pan Pacific Championships, Thorpe's {{management}} announced his signing to Adidas {{for an undisclosed}} six-figure sum, stating that he would race in their new bodysuit. This presented a dilemma, as the national team was sponsored and wore outfits designed by <b>Speedo,</b> leading to months of protracted discussions and uncertainty. To compound his commercial difficulties, Thorpe had an uncertain end to the sporting year when, in October, he broke a bone in his ankle whilst jogging. However his performance throughout the year was recognised when he was again named as the World Swimmer of the Year by Swimming World, and by Swimming Australia as its Swimmer of the Year. In a wider arena, he was named Young Australian of the Year, ABC Sports Star of the Year, and Male Athlete of the Year at the Australian Sports Awards.|$|E
5|$|Thorpe started 2000 {{looking to}} add a third {{individual}} event to his Olympic schedule. He explored his options by contesting the 1500m freestyle at the New South Wales Championships in January, which he won. Thorpe embarked on a European FINA World Cup tour to hone his racecraft, but this was overshadowed by comments made by German head coach Manfred Thiesmann accusing him of using steroids. Thorpe's difficulties heightened at the subsequent German leg of the tour in Berlin, when a standoff over a drug-test arose when officials wanted to take an unsealed sample {{due to lack of}} containers. After the standoff was resolved, Thorpe proceeded to cut more than 1.5s from his world short course record in the 200m freestyle. Given the context of the race, Thorpe rated it as his best-ever performance, ahead of his victories at Olympic and World level. On returning from Europe, Thorpe faced further uncertainty until he was granted permission to wear his Adidas suit instead of the Australian uniforms provided by <b>Speedo.</b>|$|E
25|$|At first a ballad, it {{was written}} by Redding for <b>Speedo</b> Sims, who {{intended}} to record it with his band, the Singing Demons.

Redding then decided to sing the song himself, which <b>Speedo</b> agreed to. Redding also promised to credit <b>Speedo</b> on the liner notes, but this never happened; <b>Speedo,</b> however, never charged him for not doing so.|$|E

25|$|Retailer Marks & Spencer reintroduced the {{material}} {{used as an}} alternative to nylon in swimsuits in the 1960s. While Lycra is used in most swimsuits designs because of its high elasticity, lower expense, and water wicking nature, its major drawback is that it breaks down in chlorine, commonly found in swimming pools. When worn daily, a swimsuit made of Lycra will break down in about 2–3 months. <b>Speedo</b> introduced Fastskin in 2007 as the lightest and fastest material for competitive swimwear. Unlike lycra, it does not break down in chlorine.|$|E
25|$|The Australian U13 Bluebirds were {{available}} in three different models, LX—the base model but very well equipped, Ti—the luxury model, and the SSS—the sports model.

Despite there being a sports model (SSS), the LX was the fastest of the Australian models due to having the least weight. The engine used in the Australian and US U13 models was the KA24DE (112kW, 210Nm of torque).|$|E

25|$|She {{first came}} to public {{attention}} when she won The Great British Beauty Competition on ITV's This Morning television show. She also appeared in the 1990s revival of Take Your Pick with Des O'Connor. Sarah's part was to hold the gong during the yes/no part of the quiz. Her appearance on This Morning led to a successful modelling career with Pantene, Nike, Oil of Ulay, <b>Speedo,</b> Johnnie Walker, Avon, Sensodyne, Berlei and Durex, before switching, initially to low key media work {{in the form of}} voice overs for the likes of Oil of Olay and narrating for British Sky Broadcasting, presenting corporate videos and regional television. She moved on to presenting and acting in national television and is best known for presenting BBC's DIY show Big Strong Boys, playing the roles of Joly Salter in ITV's Footballers' Wives and , Victoria Baptiste (wife of Didier Baptiste) in Sky's Dream Team and Jackie Randall in Mile High.|$|E
25|$|The LC10 was {{introduced}} with great fanfare {{and a large}} marketing campaign, which included television commercials. First reaching dealerships on 27 May 1967, market response was immediate and strong. While the original target production was 3000 per month, this was soon nearly tripled. Monthly production remained above 8000 {{until the end of}} the LC10's life. A new, additional factory in Iwata was opened in August 1967 to add supplementary capacity. While in overall a fairly simple and light car, the triple carburettors were awkwardly located at the front of the engine, behind the rear seat. To adjust them, a mechanic would have to reach through a small egg-shaped opening from the rear seat. Another complaint touched on the car's near absence of luggage space. The rear lights and the front indicators used the same lenses, only of different colors. There was even a brochure made of a US-market Fronte 360, complete with miles-per-hour <b>speedo</b> and uncovered sealed-beam headlights, but most likely none were brought over. The Fronte soon received a very minor update reflecting stricter safety laws; as of October 1968 it sported a driver's side integrated headrest, seat belts up front, and turn signal flashers on all four corners.|$|E
