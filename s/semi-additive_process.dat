40|$|Heterogeneous {{integration}} bridges the {{gap between}} nanoelectronics and its derived applications. Currently MEMS and their signal conditioning ASICs are produced and packaged at different industry sectors (different jabs). To reduce costs and enhance Yield and performance {{at the same time}} this quite expensive way of packaging has to be modified. This paper presents a different pack-aging concept. It uses standard redistribution layer technology (RDL) to package thinned chips on a full wafer substrate e. g. thinned ASIC chips on a MEMS wafer. For this approach no Through Silicon Vias (TSV) are needed Standard chips can be used without redesign. Only Known Good Dies (KGDs) are packaged with the cost benefit of wafer level technology. At the starting point for this type of packaging both ASIC and MEMS chips are still parts of full wafers. The wafer with the larger sized chips (e. g. MEMS chips) is used as a substrate for the further process steps. The wafer with the smaller sized chips (e. g. ASIC chips) is thinned down on wafer level to a thickness of 10 mu m to 40 mu m and diced. These thinned chips are glued onto the base wafer with a polymer layer (BCB from Dow Chemical). The polymer has been deposited and structured before gluing the next chip on top. After placement of the thinned chips the wafer is again coated with BCB to embed the chips. This polymer layer is photostructured to open contact pads on the base chips {{as well as on the}} embedded chips. The next step is the built-up of metal routing. Here a <b>semi-additive</b> <b>process</b> is used, which means electroplating on a sputter seed layer of TiW/Cu. This metal layer is followed by another polymer layer for passivation and acting as a solder mask. Then Under Bump Metallization (UBM) is applied again by electroplating. Finally Balling is done either by Ball Placement or by Solder Paste Printing. Now the wafer is diced and the full ASIC-MEMS package can be flip chiped onto a Printed Circuit Board (PCB). The technology will be demonstrated by the project RESTLES (Reliable System Level Integration of Stacked Chips on MEMS). RESTLES will integrate technologies like silicon MEMS, ASIC, wafer thinning, chip stacking and flip chip to one pack-aged chip stack at die scale. The influence of the heterogeneous stack on performance and control mechanisms to eliminate parasitic effects will be investigated...|$|E

40|$|At PCB {{manufacturing}} level, 50 m thin chips {{have been}} embedded with pitches up to 200 m {{in up to}} 18 "× 24 " panels. This paper shows the further developments in chip embedding technologies to incorporate chips with even smaller pitches. The technology developed in this study does not necessitate expensive redistribution layers for enlarging the pad pitch. Embedding of small pitch chips has been realised with concurrent developments in accurate chip positioning, plating methods and chemistries and ultra fine line patterning. The results in this paper show {{the emergence of a}} new prototype Embedded chip-QFN package with contact pads at 400 m pitch and a total number of 84 I/Os with dimensions of 10 mm× 10 mm. The embedded chip in the QFN package is 5 mm× 5 mm in size and has a peripheral pad configuration at 100 m pitch. All Embedded chip-QFN packages have been manufactured in 10 "× 14 " panels at prototype level. This paper also addresses all challenges for <b>semi-additive</b> <b>processes</b> for c opper structuring of chip embedded packages with pitches lower than 100 m. Qualitative analysis using acoustic microscopy and shear testing of the QFNs provides evidence of good resin adhesion and package mechanical robustness. This study shows promising results for embedding of chips with different contact pitches through alternative embedding strategies and in conjunction with developments for very dense copper routing, it provides strong evidence for the manufacturability of highly miniaturised embedded chip system-in-packages with a total thickness of 160 m...|$|R
40|$|The Packaging Research Center {{has been}} {{developing}} next generation system-on-a-package (SOP) technology with digital, RF, optical, and sensor functions integrated in a single package/module. The goal of this effort {{is to develop a}} platform substrate technology providing very high wiring density and embedded thin film passive and active components using PWB compatible materials and processes. The latest SOP baseline process test vehicle has been fabricated on novel Si-matched CTE, high modulus C-SiC composite core substrates using 10 mum thick BCB dielectric films with loss tangent of 0. 0008 and dielectric constant of 2. 65. A <b>semi-additive</b> plating <b>process</b> has been developed for multilayer microvia build-up using BCB without the use of any vacuum deposition or polishing/CMP processes. PWB and package substrate compatible processes such as plasma surface treatment/desmear and electroless/electrolytic pulse reverse plating was used. The smallest line width and space demonstrated in this paper is 6 mum with microvia diameters in the 15 - 30 mum range. This build-up process has also been developed on medium CTE organic laminates including MCL-E- 679 F from Hitachi Chemical and PTFE laminates with Cu-Invar-Cu core. Embedded decoupling capacitors with capacitance density of > 500 nF/cm 2 have been integrated into the build-up layers using sol-gel synthesized BaTiO 3 thin films (200 - 300 nm film thickness) deposited on copper foils and integrated using vacuum lamination and subtractive etch processes. Thin metal alloy resistor films have been integrated into the SOP substrate using two methods: (a) NiCrAlSi thin films (25 ohms per square) deposited on copper foils (Gould Electronics) laminated on the build-up layers and two step etch process for resistor definition, and (b) electroless plated Ni-W-P thin films (70 ohms to few Kohms per square) on the BCB dielectric by plasma surface treatment and activation. The electrical design and build-up layer structure along- - with key materials and processes used in the fabrication of the SOP 4 test vehicle were presented in this paper. Initial results from the high density wiring and embedded thin film components were also presented. The focus of this paper is on integration of materials, processes and structures in a single package substrate for system-on-a-package (SOP) implementatio...|$|R
