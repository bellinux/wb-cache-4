40|$|The {{pressure}} drop across a heat exchanger {{is an important}} parameter, along with the heat transfer capacity. In fact, the operating cost throughout {{the life of the}} exchanger depends on the pressure losses. Therefore, {{it is important to be}} able to predict {{pressure drop}} accurately as it is to predict heat transfer. A new data set of shell-side pressure drop measurements taken during isothermal flow of brines in <b>shell</b> <b>and</b> <b>tube</b> <b>evaporators</b> was collected in the Alfa Laval laboratory. It covers several different configurations of industrial <b>shell</b> <b>and</b> <b>tube</b> <b>evaporators</b> <b>and</b> a wide range of operating conditions, with cross flow Reynolds number ranging from 170 to 33, 000.

40|$|The {{influences}} of various evaporators {{on the system}} responses of a 50 kW ORC system using R- 245 fa are investigated in this study. First {{the effect of the}} supplied hot water flowrate into the evaporator is examined and the exit superheat on the system performance between plate and shell-and-tube evaporator is also reported. Test results show that the effect of hot water flowrate on the evaporator imposes a negligible effect on the transient response of the ORC system. These results prevail even for a 3. 5 -fold increase of the hot water flowrate and the system shows barely any change subject to this drastic hot water flowrate change. The effect of exit superheat on the ORC system depends on the type of the evaporator. For the plate evaporator, an exit superheat less than 10 °C may cause ORC system instability due to considerable liquid entrainment. To maintain a stable operation, the corresponding Jakob number of the plate heat evaporator must be above 0. 07. On the other hand, by employing a <b>shell</b> <b>and</b> <b>tube</b> heat <b>evaporator</b> connected to the ORC system, no unstable oscillation of the ORC system is observed for exit superheats ranging from 0 to 17 °C...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} <b>shell</b> <b>and</b> <b>tube</b> <b>evaporator</b> with micro-fin tubes using R 1234 yf and R 134 a. The model developed for this evaporator uses the ε-NTU method to predict the evaporating pressure, the refrigerant outlet enthalpy and the outlet temperature of the secondary fluid. The model accuracy is evaluated using different two-phase flow boiling correlations for micro-fin tubes and comparing predicted and experimental data. The experimental tests were carried out {{for a wide range}} of operating conditions using R 134 a and R 1234 yf as working fluids. The predicted parameter with maximum deviations, between the predicted and experimental data, is the evaporating pressure. The correlation of Akhavan– Behabadi et al. was used to predict flow boiling heat transfer, with an error on cooling capacity prediction below 5 %. Simulations, carried out with this validated model, show that the overall heat transfer coefficient of R 1234 yf has a maximum decrease of 10 % compared with R 134 a.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an improved prediction method for the heat transfer and {{pressure drop in}} the shell side of a horizontal <b>shell</b> <b>and</b> <b>tube</b> <b>evaporator.</b> The results from an experimental test program are used in which {{a wide range of}} evaporating two-phase shell side flow data was collected from a TEMA E-shell evaporator. The data are compared with shell side heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop models for homogeneous and stratified flow. The comparison suggests a deterioration in the heat transfer data at low mass fluxes consistent with a transition from homogeneous to stratified flow. The pressure drop data suggest a stratified flow across the full test range. A new model is presented that suggests the transition in the heat transfer data {{may be due to the}} extent of tube wetting in the upper tube bundle. The new model, which also takes into account the orientation of the shell side baffles, provides a vast improvement on the predictions of a homogenous type model. The new model would enable designers of shell side evaporators/reboilers to avoid operating conditions where poor heat transfer could be expected, and it would also enable changes in process conditions to be assessed for their implications on likely heat transfer performance.
