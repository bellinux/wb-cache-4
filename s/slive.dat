5|$|Ruisdael was not Jewish. <b>Slive</b> reports that, {{because of}} Ruisdael's {{depiction}} of a Jewish cemetery and various biblical names in the Ruisdael family, he often heard speculation that Ruisdael must surely be Jewish. The evidence shows otherwise. Ruisdael {{was buried in the}} Saint Bavo's Church, Haarlem, a Protestant church at that time. His uncle Salomon van Ruysdael belonged to the Young Flemish subgroup of the Mennonite congregation, one of several types of Anabaptists in Haarlem, and it is probable that Ruisdael's father was also a member there. His cousin Jacob was a registered Mennonite in Amsterdam.|$|E
5|$|Ruisdael's first Scandinavian views contain big firs, rugged mountains, large {{boulders}} and rushing torrents. Though convincingly realistic, {{they are based}} on previous art works, rather than on direct experience. There is no record that Ruisdael made any trip to Scandinavia, although fellow Haarlem painter van Everdingen had travelled there in 1644 and had popularised the subgenre. Ruisdael's work soon outstripped van Everdingen's finest efforts. In total Ruisdael produced more than 150 Scandinavian views featuring waterfalls, of which Waterfall in a Mountainous Landscape with a Ruined Castle, 1665–1670, is seen as his greatest by <b>Slive.</b>|$|E
500|$|There is some {{speculation}} that Ruisdael {{was also a}} doctor. In 1718, his biographer Houbraken reports that he studied medicine and performed surgery in Amsterdam. Archival records of the 17th century show the name [...] "Jacobus Ruijsdael" [...] {{on a list of}} Amsterdam doctors, albeit crossed out, with the added remark that he earned his medical degree on 15October 1676 in Caen, northern France. Various art historians have speculated that this was a case of mistaken identity. Pieter Scheltema suggests it was Ruisdael's cousin who appeared on the record. The Ruisdael expert Seymour <b>Slive</b> argues that the spelling [...] "uij" [...] is not consistent with Ruisdael's own spelling of his name, that his unusually high production suggests there was little time to study medicine, and that there is no indication in any of his art that he visited northern France. However, <b>Slive</b> is willing to accept that Ruisdael may still have been a doctor. In 2013, Jan Paul Hinrichs agreed that the evidence is inconclusive.|$|E

500|$|More recent {{art historians}} have rated Ruisdael highly. Kenneth Clark {{described}} him as [...] "the greatest master of the natural vision before Constable". Waldemar Januszczak finds him a marvellous storyteller. Januszczak does not consider Ruisdael the greatest landscape artist of all time, but is especially impressed by his works as a teenager: [...] "a prodigy whom we should rank at number 8 or 9 on the Mozart scale". <b>Slive</b> states Ruisdael is acknowledged [...] "by general consent, as the pre-eminent landscapist of the Golden Age of Dutch art".|$|E
500|$|<b>Slive</b> {{finds it}} {{appropriate}} that a windmill {{is the subject}} of one of Ruisdael's most famous works. Windmill at Wijk bij Duurstede, dated 1670, shows Wijk bij Duurstede, a riverside town about [...] from Utrecht, with a dominant cylindrical windmill. In this composition, Ruisdael united typical Dutch elements of low-lying land, water and expansive sky, so that they converge on the equally characteristic Dutch windmill. The painting's enduring popularity is evidenced by card sales in the Rijksmuseum, with the Windmill ranking third after Rembrandt's Night Watch and Vermeer's View of Delft. Windmills featured throughout Ruisdael's entire career.|$|E
500|$|Sportswriters {{also pointed}} to the Tigers' tougher conference {{schedule}} when compared to those of USC and Oklahoma. SEC commissioner Mike <b>Slive</b> remarked, [...] "If Auburn goes through this league undefeated, they deserve {{to play for the}} national championship." [...] Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer, in the runup to the game, seemingly agreed with the assessment, saying, [...] "We started out playing Southern Cal and I believe this Auburn team is better." [...] Some writers also indicated USC's five-point win—in which the Trojans struggled—over rival UCLA as an indicator that the Tigers could be the better team. In the end, such arguments were unable to sway voters, who ranked USC first, Oklahoma second, and Auburn third in all of the major polls decided by human voters. The Utes, who were also undefeated {{at the conclusion of the}} regular season, received limited attention because they were a member of a non-BCS conference.|$|E

500|$|Andrew Graham-Dixon asserts all Dutch Golden Age landscapists {{could not}} help but search {{everywhere}} for meaning. He says of the windmill in The Windmill at Wijk bij Duurstede that it symbolises [...] "the sheer hard work needed to keep Holland above water and to safeguard the future of the nation's children". The symmetries in the landscapes are [...] "reminders to fellow citizens always to remain on the straight and narrow". <b>Slive</b> is more reluctant to read too much into the work, but does put The Windmill in its contemporary religious context of man's dependence on the [...] "spirit of the Lord for life". With regards to interpreting Ruisdael's Scandinavian paintings, he says [...] "My own view is that it strains credulity to the breaking point to propose that he himself conceived of all his depictions of waterfalls, torrents and rushing streams and dead trees as visual sermons on the themes of transcience and vanitas".|$|E
500|$|In his 2001 {{catalogue}} raisonné, <b>Slive</b> attributes 694 {{paintings to}} Ruisdael and lists another 163 paintings with dubious or, he believes, incorrect attribution. There are three main reasons {{why there is}} uncertainty over whose hand painted various Ruisdael-style landscapes. Firstly, {{four members of the}} Ruysdael family were landscapists with similar signatures, some of which were later fraudulently altered into Jacob's. This is further {{complicated by the fact that}} Ruisdael used variations of his signature. This typically reads [...] "JvRuisdael" [...] or the monogram [...] "JVR", sometimes using a small italic 's' and sometimes a Gothic long 's', such as on Landscape with Waterfall. Secondly, many 17th century landscape paintings are unsigned and could be from pupils or copyists. Finally, fraudsters imitated Ruisdaels for financial gain, with the earliest case reported by Houbraken in 1718: a certain Jan Griffier the Elder could imitate Ruisdael's style so well that he often sold them for real Ruisdaels, especially with figurines added in the style of the artist Wouwerman. There is no large-scale systematic approach to ascertaining Ruisdael's attributions, unlike the forensic science used to find the correct attributions of Rembrandt's paintings through the Rembrandt Research Project.|$|E
