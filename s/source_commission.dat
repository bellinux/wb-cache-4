50|$|Can Xue {{has also}} written part of the {{libretto}} {{for at least one}} opera. In 2010, Can Xue and Lin Wang (web) co-wrote the libretto for a contemporary chamber opera Die Quelle (The <b>Source)</b> <b>commissioned</b> to Lin Wang by Münchener Biennale. The opera is based on Can Xue's published short story ″the Double Life″. In this opera, a young artist named Jian Yi was deconstructed into different aspects played by different roles. They crosstalk to each other on stage. Drying and bubbling-up of the spring symbolize loss and regain of one's own identity. Lin Wang composed the music for Die Quelle (85' in length). Chinese instruments Sheng, Guzheng and Sanxian were used. An unusual feature is combination of English pronunciation and Chinese intonation in this opera. Die Quelle was premiered on May 9, 2010 in Munich Biennale and broadcast live.|$|R
40|$|The {{web portal}} SciViews. de, {{operated}} by the German popular science publishing house Spektrum der Wissenschaft, focuses on curating popular science web videos. The editors, following journalistic guidelines, select and embed videos {{from a variety of}} <b>sources,</b> <b>commission</b> short journalistic reviews and present the videos to the public. The heterogeneity of science videos found on the web is high. Experiences from curating science videos for SciViews indicate that, in general, such videos are a great enrichment for science communication but often lack journalistic qualities and tend to be, in themselves, poor sources of information. Given the important role of science communication for society, this observation should raise serious concerns. Shortness and entertaining qualities, however, which are often considered to be important for "good" videos, may not play such an important role after all, as experience shows...|$|R

50|$|During peacetime, OTS {{is usually}} the {{smallest}} <b>commissioning</b> <b>source</b> in the USAF, producing fewer officers per year than AFROTC and the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA). However, it possesses the capability to surge when USAF requirements dictate and exceed the combined annual officer production of both USAFA and AFROTC. Given its shorter lead time for officer production (currently 9 weeks versus the typically 4-year pre-commissioning process for USAFA and AFROTC cadets), OTS is the <b>commissioning</b> <b>source</b> used to balance out USAF officer manning as deemed necessary by the Air Force.|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. This thesis compares the relative productivity of Naval Officers from the U. S. Naval Academy, Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps (NROTC), and Officer Candidate School (OCS). This {{is accomplished by}} creating a performance index for each individual based on officer fitness reports. The effects of <b>commissioning</b> <b>source</b> on performance are evaluated using multivariate analytical techniques. The results of the empirical analysis support the conclusion that Naval Academy graduates outperform NROTC or OCS graduates based on the measures used in this thesis. However, the magnitude of performance differences across <b>commissioning</b> <b>source</b> were small. Differences in performance were also found between year groups and for those officers who held warfare or engineering qualifications versus those who did not. It is recommended that further research be conducted on the marginal costs of each officer <b>commissioning</b> <b>source</b> to assist the Navy in making informed decisions concerning the future of commissioning programs.
