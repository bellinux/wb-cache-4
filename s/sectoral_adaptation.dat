40|$|This thesis applies a 'europeanisation' {{perspective}} {{to the analysis}} of the adoption of European Union (EU) regional and agricultural policy in the Czech Republic and Poland during the pre-accession period. EU regional and agricultural policy in the pre-accession period potentially challenged both the sectoral institutional arrangements and the wider executive structure in the Czech Republic and Poland. However, the degree of prescription varied between policy sectors. Temporal factors and policy factors meant that in the regional policy cases the challenge to the executive structure was largely mediated. On the other hand, EU agricultural policy had a high level of prescription. In the case of a fundamental 'misfit' between the EU requirements and the domestic set-up, the research, following neo-institutional perspectives, expects limited adaptation on the sectoral and executive levels. This is the case in Polish agriculture. In the case of Czech agriculture, sectoral reform should be seen in the context of agricultural policy reform started in 1997. In regional policy, the neo-institutional perspective works less well. Here, the thesis proposes an actor- based {{perspective to}} explain <b>sectoral</b> <b>adaptation.</b> This <b>sectoral</b> <b>adaptation,</b> such as the alignment of administrative procedures, remains within the range permitted by the national executive structure. The effects can be found mostly on the sectoral level. The main effect of the EU pre-accession process on executive structure is the institutional enhancement of certain national executive actors. Only, the Polish case shows an unexpected change of the executive structure. This change can be explained by endogenous reform of the institutional configuration. This research makes two main contributions to the literature. First, {{it is one of the}} first studies to apply systematically a 'europeanisation' perspective to the Eastern enlargement. Secondly, empirical evidence on East and Central Europe, based on the 'europeanisation' perspective, has been limited. In this way, the thesis will contribute to extending 'europeanisation East' and hope to produce a better conceptualisation of the EU preaccession process and domestic factors mediating the impact of the EU...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a survey of stakeholder and scientific expert judgments regarding the impacts of climate change on water management in The Netherlands in 2001. The main methodological findings were put into broader perspective by discussing the role of stakeholder and scientific expert judgment {{in the context of the}} Dutch national research programme 'Climate changes Spatial Planning' (CcSP) in the period 2001 - 2007. We focus on flood risks, and impacts on freshwater resources because they were mentioned most in the 2001 survey. For the flood risks, a high degree of consensus amongst stakeholders and scientific experts was discovered about knowledge, values and aims involved. This was not the case for the impacts of climate change on freshwater resources. The approach, chosen in 2001, enabled the researchers to explore the different opinions regarding the impacts of climate change. It appeared, however, very difficult to prioritize available adaptation options and to formulate cross-sectoral adaptation strategies. Within the CcSP programme, initiated after the 2001 survey, it can be observed that stakeholders become more involved in expert judgements about climate change impacts and adaptation strategies. The interaction between scientists and stakeholders is gradually shifting from a collaborative/consultative approach towards a real participatory approach in the research and design process of combined regional and <b>sectoral</b> <b>adaptation</b> strategie...|$|E
40|$|What {{it means}} to be {{vulnerable}} to climate change and how early examples of climate change adaptation may affect vulnerable groups in society. Climate change will, among other impacts, bring increased risks to health and well-being from more frequent and intense heatwaves, as well as increased droughts threatening the security of affordable water supplies in the UK. This report: ■introduces the concept of vulnerability to climate change within the context of social justice; ■examines two early case studies of adaptation in the south-west of England: the implementation of the national Heatwave Plan; and the trend towards differential water pricing based on usage (including the trial of a rising block tariff for water); and ■highlights the need for a more systematic consideration of current and future vulnerabilities in local, <b>sectoral</b> and national <b>adaptation</b> planning...|$|R
40|$|Moving {{towards a}} more {{sustainable}} adaptation process requires closer integration of policies {{related to the}} environment. An important actor in this is the local government. This paper examines to what extend adaptation is currently being integrated into Dutch local policies, and what the role is of a municipality's size, risk and experience in the encountered manifestations of adaptation. First, {{it was determined that}} adaptations taking place only anticipate currently perceivable weather extremes – mostly increasing precipitation. Second, it was determined that the realisation of further adaptations is hindered by a strongly <b>sectoral</b> divided reality. <b>Adaptation</b> is now heavily dominated by the water department, while spatial planning and the environment are only limitedly involved. Finally, it was observed that the contextual factor size proved to most important for horizontal policy integration, whereas the contextual factor extreme-weather experience was the most definite for the realisation of adaptations. We conclude that a more sustainable adaptation should first tackle the sectoral divides which requires administrative efforts, for example, professional training. These would preferably be initiated from a vertical direction...|$|R
40|$|Small Island Developing States (SIDS) {{classified}} as Least Developed Countries (LDCs) {{are particularly vulnerable}} to the projected impacts of climate change. Given their particular vulnerabilities, climate adaptation investments are being made through both national and international efforts to build the capacity of various sectors and communities to reduce climate risks and associated disasters. Despite these efforts, reducing climate risks is not free of various challenges and barriers. This paper aims to synthesise a set of critical socio-economic barriers present at various spatial scales that are specific to Least Developed Country SIDS. It also aims to identify the processes {{that give rise to}} these barriers. Drawing on theories from natural hazards, a systematic literature review method was adopted to identify and organise the set of barriers by focussing on both academic papers and grey literature. The data revealed a notable lack of studies on adaptation within African and Caribbean LDC-SIDS. In general, there was a paucity of academic as well as grey literature being produced by authors from LDC-SIDS to challenge existing discourses related to adaptation barriers. The most common barriers identified included those related to governance, technical, cognitive and cultural. Three key findings can be drawn from this study in relation to formal adaptation initiatives. Firstly, the lack of focus on the adaptive capacity needs of Local Government or Island Councils and communities was a key barrier to ensure success of adaptation interventions. Secondly, international adaptation funding modalities did little to address root causes of vulnerability or support system transformations. These funds were geared at supporting <b>sectoral</b> level <b>adaptation</b> initiatives for vulnerable natural resource sectors such as water, biodiversity and coastal zones. Thirdly, {{there is a need to}} recognise the significance of cultural knowledge and practices in shaping adaptive choices of communities in SIDS...|$|R

40|$|Many of the {{decisions}} relating to future urban development require information on climate change risks to cities This review of the academic and “grey” literature provides an overview assessment {{of the state of}} the art in the quantification and valuation of climate risks at the city-scale. We find that whilst a small number of cities, mostly in OECD countries, have derived quantitative estimates of the costs of climate change risks under alternative scenarios, this form of analysis is in its infancy. The climate risks most frequently addressed in existing studies are associated with sea-level rise, health and water resources. Other sectors such as energy, transport, and built infrastructure remain less studied. The review has also undertaken a case study to examine the progress in two cities—London and New York—which are relatively advanced in the assessment of climate risks and adaptation. The case studies show that these cities have benefited from stakeholder engagement at an early stage in their risk assessments. They have also benefited from the development of specific institutional responsibilities for co-ordinating such research from the outset. This involvement has been critical in creating momentum and obtaining resources for subsequent in-depth analysis of <b>sectoral</b> impacts and <b>adaptation</b> needs [...] While low cost climate down-scaling applications would be useful in future research, the greatest priority is to develop responses that can work within the high future uncertainty of future climate change, to build resilience and maintain flexibility. This can best be used within the context of established risk management practices...|$|R
40|$|The ageless human {{practice}} of adapting to environmental circumstances and coping with extreme weather {{is currently being}} challenged as the once accepted norms of climate and changing markedly. There is a crucial role for local governments {{to play in the}} process of adapting our systems to a changing climate as they represent those places where the impacts will be felt most. They will be responsible also for many of the policy areas that can make the local level more resilient to climate change. This thesis is {{based on the premise that}} adaptation should be included into the current local policy process to ensure that the quality of the environment is maintained. However, our insights into how adaptation is actually being shaped on the ground are still very limited. The aim of the research is to help address this problem by pursuing a bottom-up approach and by examining the local responses to climate change within their local context. The thesis includes a policy study into the governance aspects of adaptation to climage change. It examines how local level government in the Netherlands are anticipating climage change impacts through policy making on adaptation. In doing so, it attempts to understand why adaptation is taken up by local governments and how the level of observed action should be interpreted. The research focuses on the Netherlands, but also compares the Dutch context with the situation in Sweden and Norway, as well as with comparable studies in other national contexts. The main general conclusions to emerge are: (1) the importance of the local context for how adaptation is taken up (2) the importance of committed individuals to progress adaptation further (3) a strong dominance of urban adaptation (4) a perceived need for national coordination (5) the importance of regional pioneering (6) the <b>sectoral</b> approach to <b>adaptation,</b> and (7) the inclusion of most current adaptation policy into existing policy and practices, whilst only to a limited extent do people perceive a need for new local policy...|$|R
40|$|The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has {{gathered}} substantial evidence on current and projected impacts {{of climate change}} across geographies, ecosystems, and sectors. Even under the most stringent mitigation scenarios, the world’s temperature will continue to increase, rendering adaptation strategies a necessity for long-term local and national planning. A focus on long-term adaptation strategies must not, however, eclipse the need to address severe challenges posed by current, aggravated climate variability. Although there are significant sub- regional differences, rainfall in Africa has declined over {{the past half century}} and drought events are manifesting a trend of heightened annual and seasonal variability. Southeast Asia has endured climate extremes that include monsoons, tropical cyclones, El Niño/La Niña-Southern Oscillation events, extreme variability in rainfall, and very high temperatures. Future climate change, coupled with a variety of anthropogenic pressures on ecosystems (for example, deforestation due to land conversion, pollution, or human development in floodplains), will only exacerbate these effects. Human activity is having a significant and, at times, escalating impact on the world's ecosystems and their ability to provide those critical services that are becoming increasingly important for societal adaptation to climate change. Unsustainable logging and agricultural practices in areas with significant gradients, for example, make it possible for intensification of hurricanes or extreme rainfall events to result in disastrous flooding and landslides. In other contexts, anthropogenic impacts are mixed. Some land use changes may combine with increased periods of drought to facilitate large- scale transitions between ecological forms (ex. from savannah to desert or from humid to dry forest system). In others, agricultural intensification combined with out-migration to cities and/or conservation policies may actually result in increased/maintained tree cover and agricultural productivity despite decreases in rainfall. Forest ecosystems provide human societies {{with a wide range of}} provisioning (for example, wood and non-timber forest products) and regulating services (for example, base flow and storm flow regulation) that reduce vulnerability at the local and <b>sectoral</b> levels. Ecosystem-based <b>adaptation</b> (EBA) is a useful approach for conserving these ecosystem services and reducing vulnerability, because it encompasses adaptation strategies that explicitly value the roles of ecosystem services in adaptation to climate change across sectors and scales. Ecosystem-based adaptation strategies can be cost-effective and sustainable, and generate a wide range of environmental, social, economic, and cultural benefits. Furthermore, EBA has the potential to address both the immediate needs of society and those necessary to prepare for future hazards, and would be a useful conceptual framework for helping to develop triple-win climate-smart agriculture approaches. Effective use of EBA strategies requires (1) sustainable management and adaptation of forest ecosystems in order to (2) ensure their roles in facilitating the adaptation of people and sectors. This is necessary because land use pressures coupled with climate change will have significant impacts on forest growth, species diversity, and critical functions that underpin the delivery of services. At present, sectors most dependent on forest ecosystem services have little incentive to invest in forest adaptation. Mainstreaming forests into the adaptation policies of other sectors requires cross-scale (local to national, and ideally international) and cross-sectoral approaches, because ecosystem benefits and management costs generally occur in different locations and in different sectors of society. This will require a greater understanding of how forest ecosystems reduce other sectors’ vulnerability to climate change, and how management of forest ecosystems in certain landscapes can assist with adaptation of forest systems. Implementation of EBA will require adapting and developing institutional arrangements to support cross-sectoral approaches and providing necessary incentives...|$|R
40|$|The Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has {{documented}} substantial evidence for human influence {{as the dominant}} cause of global climate change. As some degree of further climate change is inevitable, natural and human systems {{are faced with a}} range of impacts they must adapt to. Small island developing states (SIDS) are widely considered to be highly vulnerable to climate change, for which appropriate adaptation measures need to be planned and implemented. SIDS are also key tourist attractions with tourism representing significant part of national and community economies. As the sector is highly exposed to climate change, further research is needed regarding its adaptation, particularly in countries where tourism is a major component of future development strategies. Additional research is also needed to understand climatic and non-climatic stressors that influence the vulnerability of tourism dependent communities and their households, including methods that facilitate comparative assessments. This dissertation seeks to understand climate change vulnerability at the tourism destination community scale in a small island developing state. The research is guided by two goals: 1) To examine the influence of climatic and non-climatic stressors on the pre-existing vulnerability of a destination community, including its local tourism stakeholders; and 2) To employ and compare two methods (an indicator approach and a Community-Based Vulnerability Assessment (CBVA) approach) to assess vulnerability across and within the community and determine whether either or both can advance knowledge gaps in this understanding at the destination community scale. This research was carried out in the tourism destination community of Oistins, Barbados, in the eastern Caribbean. The Caribbean is considered a ‘tourism climate change vulnerability hotspot’ by the United Nations World Tourism Organization, as it has the most tourism intensive economy in the world and because climate change impacts to its sector are predicted to be significant. Oistins is a key tourist attraction in Barbados, due to its beaches, hotels and restaurants, the Bay Garden Vendors Area and the Oistins Fish-Market, which are all at risk from an increase in climate-related events. The research undertook a mixed methods case-study. A national tourism sector vulnerability assessment was completed via a critical review and empirical analysis of the literature, which contextualized the Oistins’ community scale vulnerability assessment and informed its potential adaptation choices. Field work for the indicators and CBVA was also carried out in 2010 and 2011. Approximately 150 individuals participated in the research, including tourism stakeholders i) whose livelihoods were most connected to the tourism related activities of the destination community, ii) who lived in two neighbourhoods (households) adjacent to its key attractions and iii) who were decision-makers and/or tourism, government and community representatives (key informants). Five focus groups were held with key informants to develop destination-community and household level indicators. Some of the destination-community indicators were applied through data collection and the household indicators applied through the collection and analysis of neighbourhood surveys. Individuals were also consulted via CBVA interviews representing vendors, fishers, beach activities, accommodation and restaurants and key institutional informants. The national tourism vulnerability assessment indicates that studies have examined climate change and tourism at the Caribbean or national level, with only a few having addressed adaptation and if so not comprehensively. No studies have examined destination-community level vulnerability. Furthermore, Barbados’ tourism sector is and will experience a range of climatic and non-climatic stressors. Mid-century scenario planning predicts a doubling of tourism arrivals to the island, yet does not account for increased water scarcity or the long-term degradation of tourism infrastructure and assets due to sea level rise. The assessment thereby suggests that the island transformatively adapt its tourism sector, by reconsidering the emphasis and location of its infrastructure and attractions, while diversifying its economic activities as a whole. This could involve Barbados emphasizing luxury facilities and catering to fewer tourists along a protected west coast, where communities such as Oistins could maintain cultural attractions on an increasingly degraded south coast. With regards to goal # 1, the CBVA results suggest that Oistins interviewees were exposed to minor and local level impacts of climatic stressors, though recent non-climatic stressors were found to be causing far more adverse impacts. Tourist enjoyment of tourism-related facilities was not being affected by observed climate variability, though their numbers and spending had been affected substantially by non-climatic stressors such as the global economic crisis of 2008. Individuals working within small to mid-scale operations faced the highest exposure-sensitivity and lowest adaptive capacity to both types of stressors and resulting impacts to their livelihoods. The manner in which stakeholders are coping with present multiple stressors and plan to adapt to future changes, provides some insight in how they could adapt to near-term changes in climate. In regards to future climate change exposure sensitivities, vulnerabilities were not well understood in the destination community, as stakeholders were focused on near-term or minor weather changes, not the more significant long-term or severe impacts of climate change, such as sea-level rise, ecosystem changes or mitigation policy and the mobility of international tourists. In terms of goal # 2, this research determined that the indicator and CBVA methods were limited in advancing the understanding of climate change tourism vulnerability of the community level study area. Destination community indicators were most applicable if a defined boundary was determined to collect relevant data, though even then data was lacking for the majority of indicators at that scale. Household level indicators provided useful information on socioeconomic determinants to understand stakeholder dependence on tourism-related livelihoods, though analysis was found to be more worthwhile at the parish and national levels. Of both methods, the CBVA approach provided a more comprehensive assessment and offered some value in community-based adaptation. For the tourism sector, the CBVA also provided novel information by highlighting that most stakeholders identified vulnerabilities and adaptation measures occurred above the destination community scale. Among the original contributions of this research, two are key. The first is that local stakeholder led adaptation was not found effective to reduce tourism vulnerability, suggesting that <b>sectoral</b> and community-level <b>adaptations</b> are not always consistent. The adaptive strategies suggested by stakeholders differed by scale, with some that could be undertaken locally by destination-community stakeholders and others that would require the support of national or international stakeholders. Second, this research advances methodology at a broader community-scale, by suggesting that both methods work in combination to address certain limitations of each. Certain applicable destination-community indicators could identify vulnerable systems within the destination community and monitor long-term some of the processes and contexts of the baseline vulnerability detailed with the CBVA approach. The CBVA approach could also collect qualitative data for the conceptually relevant indicators that were not found applicable at the destination community or household scale, to provide descriptive and disaggregated information to assist with local adaptation planning efforts. The results of this research provide several contributions to theory, practice and policy. Theoretically, the research demonstrated the assessment of tourism sector vulnerability of SIDS to multiple stressors at several scales. The empirical results propose enhancing local stakeholders’ adaptive capacity to current stressors, including increasing their understanding of climate change and its predicted impacts to the tourism sector and to their destination-community. Barbados’ tourism industry also benefits from this research, as it identifies gaps pertaining to the understanding of sector vulnerability at several scales and highlights areas in which it can build adaptive capacity and adapt. Methodologically, the results show how an indicator and CBVA approach could be used in combination if a broader assessment is required at a community level. Stakeholders also concluded that in future, for SIDS the size and density of Barbados, it would be more useful to define and develop indicators for a national tourism destination. In summary, this research has contributed to the further understanding of vulnerability in small island tourism dependent communities, thereby informing more effective <b>sectoral</b> and community-based <b>adaptation</b> initiatives...|$|R
