You have got five days before you start, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> your time; and I should say don't get town horses, but critters fresh from the farms. Town horses get their legs knocked about and can't stand hard work and weather, like those just brought in.

It may be a good deal longer than that, for they are busy upon the repairs of the ships sent home after the battle, and will hardly take any hands off these to put on to the Fan Fan. In October we shall all be coming home again, so that, until next spring, it is hardly likely that there will be aught doing." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{can take}} up the next bit of land above it," [...] Mr. Mitford said. [...] "Langston's was the last {{settlement}} on the river, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> up any piece of land beyond it at the government upset price, and do as much fishing and shooting as you like, for I hear from my daughters {{that you are not}} thinking of permanently settling here, but are only a bird of passage. Anyhow, {{it would not be a}} bad investment for you to buy a considerable acreage, for as soon as the troubles are over there is sure to be a rush of emigration; and there are very few places now where land is to be had on a navigable river, so that when you are tired of the life you will be able to sell out at considerable profit." ...|$|E
6000|$|He went on deck {{again and}} called the men to him. [...] "Look here, lads; you see that steamer ashore on the Paternosters. In such a sea as this she may go to pieces in half an hour. I am {{determined}} {{to make an effort}} to save the lives of those on board. As you can see for yourselves there is no lying to weather of her, with the current and wind driving us on to the reef; we must beat up from behind. Now, lads, the sea there is full of rocks, and the chances are ten to one we strike on to them and go to pieces; but, anyhow I am going to try; but I won't take you unless you are willing. The boat is a good one, and the zinc chambers will keep her afloat if she fills; well managed, you {{ought to be able to}} make the coast of Jersey in her. Mr. Harvey, Watkins, and I can handle the yacht, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> the boat if you like." ...|$|E
60|$|Such {{notes are}} always {{dictated}} {{so rapidly that}} it is impossible to do anything towards understanding them as you go. You have to write your hardest to keep up. The beauty of this, from one point of view, is that, if you miss a sentence, you have lost the thread of the whole thing, and it is useless to attempt to take it up again at once. The only plan is to wait for some perceptible break in the flow of words, and dash in like lightning. It is much the same sort of thing as boarding a bus when in motion. And <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> a long rest, provided you are in an obscure part of the room. In passing, I might add that a very pleasing indoor game can be played by asking the master, 'what came after so-and-so?' mentioning a point of the oration some half-hour back. This always provides a respite of a few minutes while he is thinking of some bitter repartee worthy of the occasion, and if repeated several times during an afternoon may cause much innocent merriment.|$|E

6000|$|... "You don't {{think you}} are going to work {{underground}}, do you?" [...] the man said; [...] "there are very few underground mines here. It is all on the surface.

It was a big one, on one of the cross streets. When we got there, she told me to wait a minute, and, lookin' around to see that nobody was comin', she slipped off the skirt and the cape she had made and rolled 'em up in a bundle. 'It don't matter about my hat and shoes,' says she, 'but they wouldn't know me in such duds.' Then, handin' me the bundle, she said, 'For twenty-five cents you can get that bag mended just as good as new, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> it, and it will save us a dollar and a half.'--'No, you don't,' says I, for I'd had enough of her stinginess. 'I don't touch that bag ag'in, and I made up my mind that minute to charge the old man five dollars' worth.

They kept intimidating me, telling me what I did that day, and I think I ended up believing what they were telling me. They were saying 'We know you've done it. We've got the proof, we've got the evidence'. I think that, because the case had been going on that long, they were out to get somebody to get it off their books, to put somebody inside. It didn't matter who it was as long as it fitted in some way or they could make it fit in some way and they could put that person inside.|$|R

[...] Screenwriter Jimmy Sangster disputed that account in his memoir Inside Hammer, writing that [...] "Vampires don't chat. So I didn't write him any dialogue.
