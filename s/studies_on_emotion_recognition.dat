40|$|Emotion {{recognition}} in real-life conditions faces several challenging factors, which most <b>studies</b> <b>on</b> <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> do not consider. Such factors include background noise, varying recording levels, and acoustic {{properties of the}} environment, for example. This paper presents a systematic evaluation {{of the influence of}} background noise of various types and SNRs, as well as recording level variations on the performance of automatic emotion recognition from speech. Both, natural and spontaneous as well as acted/prototypical emotions are considered. Besides the well known influence of additive noise, a significant influence of the recording level on the recognition performance is observed. Multi-condition learning with various noise types and recording levels is proposed as a way to increase robustness of methods based on standard acoustic feature sets and commonly used classifiers. It is compared to matched conditions learning and is found to be almost on par for many settings...|$|E
40|$|Background and Objectives: Abundant {{research}} has demonstrated that patients with schizophrenia have difficulties in recognizing the emotional content in facial expressions. However, there is a paucity of <b>studies</b> <b>on</b> <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> in schizophrenia patients with a history of violent behavior compared to patients without a criminal record. Methods: Emotion recognition skills were examined in thirty-three forensic patients with schizophrenia. In addition, executive function and psychopathology was assessed. Results were compared to a group of 38 schizophrenia patients in regular psychiatric care and to a healthy control group. Results: Both patient groups performed more poorly on almost all tasks compared to controls. However, in the forensic group the recognition of the expression of disgust was preserved. When the excitement factor of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale was co-varied out, forensic patients outperformed the non-forensic patient group on emotion recognition across modalities. Conclusions: The superior recognition of disgust could be uniquely associated with delinquent behavior...|$|E

30|$|In this work, {{we carried}} out a <b>study</b> <b>on</b> <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> from Turkish speech using {{acoustic}} features. In recent years, several corpora in different languages have been collected; however, Turkish is not among the languages that has been investigated {{in the context of}} <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition.</b> In this paper, we presented the Turkish Emotional Speech Database and reported the baseline results. Categorical representations and dimensional descriptions are two common approaches to define emotion present in speech. In categorical approach, a fixed set of words is used to describe an emotional state, whereas in the dimensional approach, emotion is defined as points in the multidimensional space. The three most common dimensions used are valence, activation, and dominance which represent the main properties of emotional states. In this work, both categorical evaluation and emotion primitive estimation were performed. An unweighted average recall of 45.5 % was obtained for the classification. For emotion dimension estimation, the regression results in terms of correlation coefficient are promising for activation and dominance, with 0.739 and 0.743, respectively. For valence, however, the correlation between the averaged ratings of the evaluators (reference values) and the SVR estimates was low (only 0.288). In this study, we also performed cross-corpus evaluations, and the results were promising especially for activation and dominance dimensions. This result indicates that acoustic information alone is not enough to discriminate emotions in valence dimension. Future work includes the use of linguistic information to improve the classification and regression results especially for valence.|$|R
40|$|In {{research}} on emotion, presenting affective stimuli has been {{believed to be}} an effective and reliable technique for emotion elicitation. Instead of collecting stimuli for pre-defined emotions, we propose to develop stimuli based on their symbolic meanings. We adopted archetypal symbolism as a standard to edit eight movie clips of archetypes as a new set of affective stimuli. These stimuli were used in an experiment for emotion elicitation. Participants ’ emotional responses toward these stimuli of archetypes were measured by the self-report technique and the physiological measurement. The results of linear discriminant analysis show that physiological measurement is more robust than the self-report techniques in recognizing emotions toward stimuli of archetypes. However, it is still unclear which technique reflects the ground truth of human emotion. We discuss alternative implications of these results, and provide more research questions for future <b>studies</b> <b>on</b> <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> and model development.

40|$|The extreme {{parenting}} experiences {{encountered by}} {{children who are}} physically abused or neglected place them {{at increased risk for}} impaired socio-emotional development. There is growing evidence that maltreated children may apprehend interpersonal encounters in different ways from children without such traumatic histories. This systematic review examines the links between childhood physical abuse and neglect and various constituent skills of social understanding (including emotion recognition and understanding, perspective taking, false belief understanding, and attributional biases) in 51 empirical studies. The review incorporates a meta-analysis of 19 <b>studies</b> <b>on</b> <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> and understanding in this population. This showed an overall negative effect of maltreatment, but moderation analyses revealed that significantly stronger effects were found for measures of emotion understanding rather than recognition, and for younger rather than older age groups. The broader review also reveals a complex and differentiated profile of social understanding among maltreated children. Directions for future research that addresses individual differences in children’s experiences, both within and outside the maltreatment context, are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Social competence, i. e. {{appropriate}} or effective social functioning, is {{an important}} determinant of quality of life. Social competence consists of social skills, social performance and social adjustment. The current paper reviews social skills, in particular emotion recognition performance and its relationship with social adjustment in children with brain disorders. In this review, normal development and the neuro-anatomical correlates of emotion recognition in both healthy children and adults and in various groups of children with brain disorders, will be discussed. A systematic literature search conducted on PubMed, yielded nine papers. Emotion recognition tasks were categorized {{on the basis of}} task design and emotional categories to ensure optimal comparison across studies before an explorative meta-analysis was conducted. This meta-analytic review suggests that children with brain disorders show impaired emotion recognition, with the recognition of sad and fearful expressions being most impaired. Performance {{did not seem to be}} related to derivative measures of social adjustment. Despite the limited number of studies on a variety of brain disorders and control groups, outcomes were quite consistent across analyses and corresponded largely with the existing literature on development of emotion recognition in typically developing children. More longitudinal prospective <b>studies</b> <b>on</b> <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> are needed to gain insight into recovery and subsequent development of children with distinct brain disorders. This will aid development, selection and implementation of interventions for improvement of social competence and quality of life in children with a brain disorder...|$|E
30|$|Next, {{the facial}} {{features}} are trained {{according to a}} specific classifier {{in order to determine}} explicitly distinctive boundaries between emotions.

40|$|AbstractPrevious {{research}} has demonstrated that older adults are not as accurate as younger adults at perceiving negative emotions in facial expressions. These <b>studies</b> rely <b>on</b> <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> tasks that involve choosing between many alternatives, creating the possibility that age differences emerge for cognitive rather than perceptual reasons. In the present study, an emotion discrimination task was used to investigate younger and older adults’ ability to visually discriminate between negative emotional facial expressions (anger, sadness, fear, and disgust) at low (40 %) and high (80 %) expressive intensity. Participants completed trials blocked by pairs of emotions. Discrimination ability was quantified from the participants’ responses using signal detection measures. In general, the results indicated that older adults had more difficulty discriminating between low intensity expressions of negative emotions than did younger adults. However, younger and older adults did not differ when discriminating between anger and sadness. These findings demonstrate that age differences in visual emotion discrimination emerge when signal detection measures are used but that these differences are not uniform and occur only in specific contexts...|$|R

40|$|Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is an {{increasingly}} prevalent, clinically significant behavior in adolescents {{and can be}} associated with serious consequences for the afflicted person. Emotion regulation is considered its most frequent function. Because the symptoms of NSSI are common and cause impairment, it will be included in Section 3 disorders as a new disorder in the revised Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM- 5). So far, research has been conducted mostly with patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) showing self-injurious behavior. Therefore, for this review the current state of research regarding emotion regulation, NSSI, and BPD in adolescents is presented.

40|$|Accurate {{processing}} of emotional information {{is a critical}} component of appropriate social interactions and interpersonal relationships. Disturbance of emotion processing is present in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and is a clinical feature in two of the three subtypes: behavioural-variant FTD and semantic dementia. Emotion processing in progressive nonfluent aphasia, the third FTD subtype, is thought to be mostly preserved, although current evidence is scant. This paper reviews the literature <b>on</b> <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition,</b> reactivity and expression in FTD subtypes, although most <b>studies</b> focus <b>on</b> <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition.</b> The relationship between patterns of emotion processing deficits and patterns of neural atrophy are considered, by integrating evidence from recent neuroimaging studies. The review findings are discussed in the context of three contemporary theories of emotion processing: the limbic system model, the right hemisphere model and a multimodal system of emotion. Results across subtypes of FTD are most consistent with the multimodal system model, and support the presence of somewhat dissociable neural correlates for basic emotions, with strongest evidence for the emotions anger and sadness. Poor emotion processing is evident in all three subtypes, although deficits are more widespread than what would be predicted based <b>on</b> <b>studies</b> in healthy cohorts. Studies that include behavioural and imaging data are limited. Future investigations combining these approaches will help improve the understanding of the neural network underlying emotion processing. Presently, longitudinal investigations of emotion processing in FTD are lacking, and studies investigating emotion processing over time are critical to understand the clinical manifestations of disease progression in FTD. 18 page(s...|$|R

30|$|An {{important}} {{requirement of}} most data-driven systems is {{the availability of}} annotated data. The goal of annotation is to assign a label to data. For the <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> task, the annotation {{is needed to determine}} the true emotion expressed in the collected speech data. Largely motivated from psychological studies, two approaches were employed within the <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> research for <b>emotion</b> annotation. The classical approach is to use set of emotion words (categories) to describe emotion-related states. Even though there are ongoing debates concerning how many emotion categories exist, the emotion categories (fear, anger, happiness, disgust, sadness, and surprised) defined by Ekman [14] are commonly used in most of the <b>studies</b> <b>on</b> automatic <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition.</b> However, the main disadvantage of the categorical approach is that it fails to represent a wide range of real-life emotions. The second approach is to use continuous multidimensional space model to describe emotions. In this approach, the emotion is defined as points in multidimensional space rather than a small number of emotion categories. Dimensions in this approach are called emotion primitives. The most commonly used dimensions are valence, activation, and dominance. Valence represents negative to positive axis, activation represents calm to excited axis, and dominance represents weak to strong axis in 3 D space. The most common databases such as the FAU Aibo emotion corpus, Situation Analysis in Fictional and Emotional Corpus (SAFE), Airplane Behaviour Corpus (ABC), and TUM Audiovisual Interest Corpus (AVIC) were annotated with the categorical approach. Only a few databases exist where emotions are represented by emotion primitives. Sensitive Artificial Listener (SAL) [5] and Vera-Am-Mittag (VAM) [11] are labeled with the dimensional approach. To our knowledge, among the common databases, only a few of them includes both categorical and dimensional labeling such as IEMOCAP [8] and Belfast Naturalistic Database [15].|$|R

40|$|Background: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to assess whether children with a sensory disability have consistent delays in acquiring <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> and <b>emotion</b> understanding abilities. Method: Younger (6 - 11 years) and older (12 - 18 years) hearing-impaired children (HI; n = 49), vision-impaired children (VI; n = 42), and children with no sensory impairment (NSI; n = 72) were assessed with the <b>Emotion</b> <b>Recognition</b> Scales (ERS), which include two tests of the ability to recognize vocal expressions of emotion, two tests of the ability to recognize facial expressions of emotion, and three tests of emotion understanding.

40|$|Objectives: Previous {{studies have}} found that {{oxytocin}} (OXT) can improve the recognition of emotional facial expressions; it has been proposed that this effect is mediated by an increase in attention to the eye-region of faces. Nevertheless, evidence in support of this claim is inconsistent, and few studies have directly tested the effect of oxytocin <b>on</b> <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> via altered eye-gaze Methods: In a double-blind, within-subjects, randomized control experiment, 40 healthy male participants received 24 IU intranasal OXT and placebo in two identical experimental sessions separated by a 2 -week interval. Visual attention to the eye-region was assessed on both occasions while participants completed a static facial <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> task using medium intensity facial expressions. Results: Although OXT had no effect <b>on</b> <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> accuracy, recognition performance was improved because face processing was faster across emotions under the influence of OXT. This effect was marginally significant (p<. 06). Consistent with a previous study using dynamic stimuli, OXT had no effect on eye-gaze patterns when viewing static emotional faces and this was not related to recognition accuracy or face processing time. Conclusions: These findings suggest that OXT-induced enhanced facial <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> is not necessarily mediated by an increase in attention to the eye-region of faces, as previously assumed. We discuss several methodological issues which may explain discrepant findings and suggest the effect of OXT on visual attention may differ depending on task requirements.

40|$|The overall {{scientific}} aim of {{this thesis}} is to examine <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), its specificity to ASD and connection to other cognitive functions, {{as well as to}} map the effects of previous and novel <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> and <b>emotion</b> expression training programs in children with ASD across cultures. Emotion processing training in ASD is a potentially valuable tool to improve the lives and outcomes of children with ASD, but it has been lacking an adequate scientific preparation, content and motivational design, as well as high-end technical expertise. In study I, we review the existing randomized controlled trials <b>on</b> <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> training for children and adolescents with ASD, focusing external validity, a largely aspect in the area. External validity is significant to evaluate for several reasons. First, <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> training approaches have been diverse, and ASD forms population a heterogeneous population. Second, children and adolescents with ASD often have difficulties with generalizing knowledge from the training context to new situations, and {{it is not clear how}} this is reflected in the results of the various <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> training programs. Third, <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> training is often performed using computerized programs in controlled settings, raising questions about the extent to which the effects translate to everyday situations. The systematic review demonstrated few indications to presume that current emotion training programs generalize outside of the training setting into everyday life social interactions. This review highlights the need to focus on external validity in future <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> training studies, and to improve reporting of these aspects. Study II examined basic facial affect recognition in well-matched samples ofchildren with ASD, Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and typical development using the computer-based FEFA- 2 test. We examined accuracy and response times for general and specific facial affect recognition skills in whole face and eye-region stimuli. The ASD samples performed inferior to typical developing controls. There were no difference between the ADHD sample, on one hand, and the ASD and typical sample, on the other. In the clinical samples, particularly the ADHD sample, cognitive distractibility explained a substantial proportion of variance of basic facial affect recognition performance. This research largely confirms previous findings <b>on</b> <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> in ASD, and aspects of specificity compared to ADHD, a neurodevelopmental condition overlapping with ASD. Importantly, the study shows that performance <b>on</b> <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> tasks is not only depending <b>on</b> pure <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> capacities, but is also largely influenced by other cognitive functions. Study III explored cultural differences in <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> in children with ASD and typically developed children. Compared to many previous studies, differences in recognizing emotion expression was tested in three modalities of basic and complex emotion processing, namely in face, voice, and body language including gestures. These expressions were also examined in integrated form using complex social scenes. The study was conducted across three countries and cultural contexts: Israel, United Kingdom and, and Sweden. Children with ASD showed impairments in both basic and complex <b>emotions</b> <b>on</b> all three modalities and their integration in context compared to typically developing matched control children. Both children with ASD and typical development performed better on basic than complex emotions. Cross-cultural differences were limited to some face and body stimuli, indicating high cross cultural comparability of <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> findings. Study IV included a cross-cultural evaluation of the effects of the serious game “Emotiplay” in ASD <b>on</b> <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> skills, and parent-reported autism symptomatology and adaptive skills in United Kingdom, Israel and Sweden. <b>Emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> tasks comprised face, voice, body, and integrative social scenes. Children used Emotiplay 8 - 12 weeks in a home setting. In the United Kingdom children were tested prepost, while children in Israel and Sweden were randomized to training or a waiting-list control group. Results showed improvements in <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> regarding body language and integrative tasks as well as adaptive socialization in the United Kingdom site. In Israel and Sweden, the active groups improved more than controls <b>on</b> all <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> outcomes. There was also an effect on autism related symptoms in the sample from Israel. Findings support the feasibility and usefulness of serious gaming to enhance <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> and possibly reduce autism symptoms and socialization issues in autistic children.

40|$|Autism and Asperger Syndrome are autism {{spectrum}} conditions (ASC) {{characterized by}} deficits in understanding others' minds, {{an aspect of}} which involves recognizing emotional expressions.

People with ASC were less accurate <b>on</b> the <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> task compared to controls, but only for the negative basic emotions. This is discussed in the light of similar findings from people with damage to the amygdala...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effects of shading parts of face <b>on</b> <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> using methods of choice. The {{participants}} were 34 undergraduate students, whose ages ranged from 20 to 29 years. The stimulus materials comprised photographs of six basic emotions (happiness, surprise, fear, anger, sadness and, disgust), and copies of these photographs in which upper or lower parts of these six basic emotions were shaded. The models for the photographs were six Japanese males and six Japanese females. The task assigned to the participants was to select emotional words appropriate for each photograph. The rates of correct responses for the male and female photographs of happiness, surprise and sadness were > 90 %. In the male photographs, differences in the rates of correct responses between photographs with their upper parts shaded and those with their lower parts shaded were significant in happiness, anger, sadness and disgust. In the female photographs, differences in the rates of correct responses between photographs with their upper parts shaded and those with their lower parts shaded were significant in happiness, fear, anger and disgust. These results suggest the following; 1) Happiness can be recognised more precisely by viewing the lower parts of face regardless of the gender depicted in the photographs; 2) Anger can be recognised more precisely by viewing the upper parts of face regardless of the gender depicted in the photographs; 3) Fear can not be recognised precisely even in photographs that are not shaded; 4) In future studies, it is necessary to examine effects of shading parts of the face <b>on</b> <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> using other sets of photographs, and to examine effects of action units peculiar to each <b>emotion</b> <b>on</b> <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition...</b>|$|R
40|$|The present thesis {{comprises}} {{a series}} of studies investigating the effects of oxytocin <b>on</b> facial <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition.</b> <b>Study</b> I and Study II examined whether the effects of oxytocin <b>on</b> <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> are related to shifts in overt and/or covert attention. To this end, participants’ eye gaze and pupil size were recorded while they performed an <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> task that involved the presentation of dynamically changing expressions. Oxytocin enhanced participants’ recognition sensitivity for all expressions, irrespective of the expressions’ emotional valence. These effects appeared to be due to shifts in covert rather than overt attention because oxytocin affected participants’ pupil size but not eye gaze during face processing. Study III further examined whether oxytocin-induced changes in <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> are unrelated to shifts in overt attention. To this end, participants performed an <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> task that involved the masked presentation of static expressions. Oxytocin enhanced participants’ recognition accuracy for all expressions, presumably due to shifts in covert rather than overt attention because the task design precluded any gaze changes during face processing. Taken together these studies suggest that oxytocin generally improves the recognition of various facial expressions, {{even in the absence of}} overt attention shifts...|$|R
30|$|This paper focuses <b>on</b> <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> {{of voice}} signal in the {{violence}} detection system. In Section 2, emotions in violence events are analyzed. In Section 3, a kind of speech <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> algorithm with consequential eliminating process (CEP) is presented. Then, parameters of support vector machine (SVM) are optimized, and Berlin voice database is used to test and verify the algorithm. In Section 4, a school violence simulation experiment performed in an elementary school is described, from which voice signals database are extracted. The database extracted from the experiment is processed by CEP algorithm, and the calculation result is presented and analyzed.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{occurrence}} of asymmetries in cross-linguistic <b>recognition</b> of <b>emotion</b> in speech. Theories <b>on</b> <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> do not predict any asymmetries in the cross-linguistic recognition of emotion: if a particular emotion expressed by e. g. a Korean speaker is difficult to interpret for a Dutch listener, the same emotion expressed by a Dutch speaker should be equally difficult for a Korean listener. This study investigates whether that is indeed the case. Previous studies have established that certain emotions are more accurately recognized cross-linguistically than others, and that language-typological similarity facilitates cross-linguistic <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition,</b> but were unsuitable for assessing asymmetrical recognition patterns...|$|R
