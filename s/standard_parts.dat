In the 20th century, the straw poll and scientific public opinion polls by companies including Gallup became <b>standard</b> <b>parts</b> of political campaigns and media coverage of elections. During his Senate career, Wilson pioneered straw polling by sampling the views of Massachusetts voters through in person conversations and unscientific written surveys before making his own views known. These efforts were credited with helping Wilson build coalitions, win elections, make political allies, and determine {{the best time to}} act in the Senate on issues of importance.|$|E

25|$|Researchers {{have noted}} some peculiarities in the mummification process {{used on the}} Lady. The {{evisceration}} {{of the body and}} the stuffing of the torso with embalming materials were <b>standard</b> <b>parts</b> of the mummification process used during the entire reign of the 18th dynasty. This was not the case with the intact skull base and lack of effort to remove the brain, seen {{in the case of the}} Lady. This process had been used on early rulers of the 18th dynasty, as seen in the mummies currently identified with Thutmose I, Thutmose II, and Thutmose III. By the time of the later rulers of the 18th dynasty, when the Lady lived and died, the process had changed. All mummies from this later era contain some treatment of the brain, in attempts to remove it from the body. The mummification process used on the Lady seems like a throwback to an earlier era. Another peculiarity is the evidence that the people behind the mummification process were trying to repair and cover injured areas of the body. They used subcutaneous fillings and packs to remodel the injured left side of the face, the contralateral side of the face, and the right hip region. This was not part of the regular efforts of an embalmer.|$|E
500|$|In 1954, a licence {{was issued}} to Canadair {{to build the}} {{derivative}} Canadair CL-28/CP-107 Argus, and the Canadair CL-44/Canadair CC-106 Yukon. Based on the Britannia, {{the design of the}} Argus maritime patrol and anti-submarine warfare aircraft was optimised for endurance on long-range patrol, not speed, and used four Wright R-3350-32W Turbo-Compound engines that used less fuel at low altitude. Unlike its Britannia forebear, the Argus was a hybrid using the Britannia wings, tail surfaces and landing gear matched to a [...] "purpose-built", unpressurised fuselage. Another significant departure was being [...] "Americanized", substituting North American materials and <b>standard</b> <b>parts</b> for the British ones. The interior was well equipped with the tools to conduct anti-submarine warfare: navigation, communication and tactical electronic equipment along with weapon loads that included bombs, torpedoes, mines and depth charges. A total of 33 Argus aircraft were built in two series (Mk 1 and Mk 2), serving the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) and Canadian Forces from 1957 to 1982.|$|E

500|$|After {{the poor}} {{steaming}} of the Urie batch was addressed, the class proved popular amongst crews, mechanically reliable {{and capable of}} high speeds. However, their heavy hammerblow at speed meant that they were prone to rough riding and instability. The two Maunsell batches with their streamlined steam passages and better draughting arrangements were superior in performance, and were a popular choice when Bulleid’s locomotives were unavailable. Their use of <b>standard</b> <b>parts</b> considerably eased maintenance, and the fitting of different tender and cab sizes meant few operational restrictions for the class on mainline routes. The class gave many years of service, and were noted {{for their ability to}} [...] "do the job". The electrification of the Eastern and Central sections and the increasing number of Bulleid Pacifics in service meant the lack of a suitable role for the class under British Railways ownership.

500|$|Joseph Armstrong's {{early death}} in 1877 {{meant that the}} next phase of motive power design was the {{responsibility}} of William Dean who developed express 4-4-0 types rather than the single-driver 2-2-2s and 4-2-2s that had hauled fast trains up to that time. Dean retired in 1902 to be replaced by George Jackson Churchward, who introduced the familiar 4-6-0 locomotives. It was during Churchward's tenure that the term [...] "Locomotive Superintendent" [...] was changed to [...] "Chief Mechanical Engineer" [...] (CME). Charles Collett succeeded Churchward in 1921. He was soon responsible for the much larger fleet that the GWR operated following the Railways Act 1921 mergers. He set about replacing the older and less numerous classes, and rebuilding the remainder using as many standardised GWR components as possible. He also produced many new designs using <b>standard</b> <b>parts,</b> such as the Castle and King classes. The final CME was Frederick Hawksworth who took control in 1941, seeing the railway through wartime shortages and producing GWR-design locomotives until after nationalisation.|$|E

5000|$|The {{theory of}} PA cannot define the <b>standard</b> <b>part</b> of a nonstandard model. This {{is because the}} <b>standard</b> <b>part</b> of a nonstandard model is closed under the {{successor}} operation, so a first-order formula that were true for exactly the standard numbers would satisfy the premises of the induction schema (true for 0 and true for every successor of an element it is true for) without satisfying the conclusion (true everywhere).
