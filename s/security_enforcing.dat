A government department (usually called the Department of Corrections or similar) now runs {{the prison system}} and the coroner's office handles coronial matters. The sheriff is now largely responsible for enforcing the civil orders and fines of the court by seizing and selling the property of judgement debtors who do not satisfy the debt, providing court <b>security,</b> <b>enforcing</b> arrest warrants, evictions, taking juveniles into custody and running the jury system. Some state sheriffs can also apply {{a wide range of}} sanctions ranging from suspending driver's licences and car registration through to wheel clamping and arranging community service orders, and as a last resort can make arrests.|$|E

This account of contemporary urban policing aims to show that, instead of enforcing the law, the police are engaged in the task of enforcing an unequal social order in the name of public <b>security.</b> <b>Enforcing</b> Order is an intriguing read, not least for what it reveals about the politics of law and order, and of policing, in France in recent times. It also offers interesting insights into French social science and criminology, writes Tim Newburn...|$|E

40|$|Abstract – Today, one {{existing}} {{class of}} RFID systems {{are based on}} ISO 14443 (Proximity Coupling). This is the standard for RF-interfaces of contactless smart card systems. Contactless RF interfaces of smart cards are very often regarded as less secure than contact based smart cards. This tenor may be changed based on our new approach. Therefore we suggest to establish secure password authenticated wireless channels for contactless smart cards. Preliminary, a separate channel for the transmission of a short time secret (password) is needed. Moreover, we recommend to use an optical channel realized by a flexible display. On the whole, we suggest contactless smart cards with a small visual display unit as <b>security</b> <b>enforcing</b> component to establish a secure and authenticated radiofrequency communication between a contactless smart card and a contactless reader. ...|$|E
40|$|Security for {{e-commerce}} {{is a vital}} topic due to {{the relentless}} drive to more business and commerce to the internet. Consumers are being strongly encouraged by the profit-oriented, cost-minimisation nature of commercial enterprises to shop on-line. Consumers themselves, though, have limited confidence about the security of their personal information which is transmitted in each and every on-line transaction. They are demanding much more in this regard from everyone concerned in the on-line transaction, from the database vendor to the internet applications developer, including both client and server systems. One solution is to embed much of this required security transparently into the application performing the on-line e-commerce transaction. We believe {{this can be done}} {{through the use of a}} simple "roles and rights markup language " based on roles and rights, implemented using XML, which can call upon the cryptographic and other <b>security</b> <b>enforcing</b> technologies required to give consumers a high degree of confidence that their on-line e-commerce transaction is secure. ...|$|E

40|$|With the {{increasing}} complexity and dynamics of database and information systems, {{it becomes more}} and more di cult for administrative personnel to identify, specify and enforce security policies that govern against the misuse of data. Often security policies are not known, too imprecise or simply have been disabled because of changing requirements. Recently several proposals have been made to use data mining techniques to discover pro les and anomalous user behavior from audit logs. These approaches, however, are often too ne-grained in that they compute too many rules to be useful for an administrator in implementing appropriate <b>security</b> <b>enforcing</b> mechanisms. In this paper we present a novel approach todiscover security policies from audit logs. The approach isbased on the usage of multiple concept hierarchies that specify properties of objects and data at di erent levels of abstraction and thus can embed useful domain knowledge. A pro ler, attached to the information system's auditing component, utilizes such concept hierarchies to compute pro les at di erent levels of granularity, guided by the administrator through the speci cation of an interestingness measure. The computed pro les can be translated into security policies and existing policies can be veri ed against the pro les. The proposed approach provides a exible framework for (re-) engineering security policies for diverse types of information systems. ...|$|E
