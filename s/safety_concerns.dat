5|$|Cycling groups voiced <b>safety</b> <b>concerns</b> {{after people}} were injured as their bicycle wheels became caught in the track. They {{reported}} the road surface around the tracks was crumbling, raising further safety problems. In response, TiE promised to carry out repairs and Edinburgh Trams agreed to fund special training for cyclists., but the repairs were insufficient: in 2017, a woman was crushed to death by a passing bus when her bicycle wheel {{was caught in the}} tracks. Further <b>safety</b> <b>concerns</b> were raised by residents along the routes about the suspension of overhead electric cables from residential buildings, and some property owners refused permission for cables to be attached.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{influence}} of perceived value and food <b>safety</b> <b>concern</b> to purchase intention with consumer attitude as mediation variable. Specifically, it explains the variables that formation purchase organic food. Data are gathered through survey by interviewing respondents who are guided by questionnaires. Sample consist of 181 respondents that collected by convenience sampling method. Structural Equation Modeling was to used to explain the relationship of variables that are hypothesized. The test result indicated that there is significant relationship between perceived value on attitude, perceived value on purchase intention, food <b>safety</b> <b>concern</b> on attitude, food <b>safety</b> <b>concern</b> on purchase intention, and attitude on purchase intention. The test result also indicated that consumer attitude were found to mediated purchase intention forming. In this study, both limitation and implication are also discussed in order to give insight toward theoretical, practical, methodological, and future research aspects.

5|$|Despite initial <b>safety</b> <b>concerns,</b> DC-10 {{aircraft}} {{continued to}} serve with passenger airlines for over 30 years after the crash of Flight 191. In the end, it was newer, more fuel-efficient twin-engined airplanes from Boeing and Airbus and not <b>safety</b> <b>concerns</b> that ultimately ended the passenger career of the DC-10. Many retired passenger DC-10s have since been converted to all-cargo use. DC-10 freighters, along with its derivative, the MD-11, form {{the backbone of the}} FedEx Express fleet. The DC-10s have been upgraded with the glass cockpit from the MD-11, thereby turning them into MD-10s. American Airlines retired its last DC-10s in 2000 after 29 years of service. In February 2014, Biman Bangladesh Airlines operated the final DC-10 passenger flights. DC-10s continue to be used extensively in air freight operations, and military variants also remain in service.|$|E
