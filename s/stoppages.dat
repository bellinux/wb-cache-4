5|$|Games {{last longer}} than their defined length due to play <b>stoppages</b> – the average NFL game lasts {{slightly}} over three hours. Time in a football game {{is measured by the}} game clock. An operator is responsible for starting, stopping and operating the game clock based on the direction of the appropriate official. A separate clock, the play clock, is used to determine if a delay of game infraction has been committed. If the play clock expires before the ball has been snapped or free-kicked, a delay of game foul is called on the offense. The play clock is set to 40 seconds in professional and college football and to 25 seconds in high school play or following certain administrative <b>stoppages</b> in the former levels of play.|$|E

Calzaghe was victorious on a third-round <b>stoppage,</b> unleashing a flurry of punches on the outclassed Manfredo, who threw nothing in return, thus drawing a <b>stoppage</b> from the referee.Manfredo and some American {{commentators}} called the <b>stoppage</b> premature because Manfredo did not appear hurt.

5|$|The {{number of}} <b>stoppages</b> across the UK peaked at 4,583 in 1979, {{when more than}} 29million working days had been lost. In 1984, {{the year of the}} miners' strike, there were 1,221, {{resulting}} in the loss of more than 27million working days. <b>Stoppages</b> then fell steadily throughout the rest of Thatcher's premiership; in 1990 there were 630 and fewer than 2million working days lost, and they continued to fall thereafter. Thatcher's tenure also witnessed a sharp decline in trade union density, with the percentage of workers belonging to a trade union falling from 57.3% in 1979 to 49.5% in 1985. In 1979 up until Thatcher's final year in office, trade union membership also fell, from 13.5million in 1979 to fewer than 10million.|$|E

5|$|In September 1937 the Spitfire prototype, K5054, {{was fitted}} with ejector type exhausts.

The latter system had become ineffective due to improvements to the Merlin itself which allowed higher operating altitudes where air temperatures are lower. Ejector exhausts were also fitted to other Merlin-powered aircraft.|$|E

5|$|The National Hockey League All-Star Game is a mid-season {{exhibition}} game held annually between {{many of the}} top players of each season. Sixty-two All-Star Games have been held since 1947, {{with at least one}} player chosen to represent the Red Wings in each year. The All-Star game has not been held in various years: 1979 and 1987 due to the 1979 Challenge Cup and Rendez-vous '87 series between the NHL and the Soviet national team, respectively, 1995, 2005, and 2013 as a result of labor <b>stoppages,</b> and 2006, 2010, and 2014 because of the Winter Olympic Games.|$|E

40|$|This study extends prior {{research}} on referee bias and close bias in professional soccer by examining whether Major League Soccer (MLS) referees' discretion over <b>stoppage</b> time (i. e., extra play beyond regulation) {{is influenced by}} end-of-regulation match scores and/or home field advantage. To do so, we employ a grouped-data regression model and a partially adaptive model. Both account for the imprecise measurement in reported <b>stoppage</b> time. For the 2011 season we find no home field advantage. In fact, <b>stoppage</b> time is the same with a one or two goal deficit {{at the end of}} regulation, regardless of which team is ahead. However, the 2011 results do point to an increase in <b>stoppage</b> time of 12 to 20 seconds for nationally televised matches. For the 2012 season, the nationally televised effect disappears due to an increase in <b>stoppage</b> time for those matches not nationally televised. However, a home field advantage is present. Facing a one-goal deficit at the end of regulation, the home team receives about 33 seconds more <b>stoppage</b> time than a visiting team facing the same deficit...|$|R

5|$|A trade {{route is}} a {{logistical}} network {{identified as a}} series of pathways and <b>stoppages</b> used for the commercial transport of cargo. The term {{can also be used to}} refer to trade over bodies of water. Allowing goods to reach distant markets, a single trade route contains long distance arteries, which may further be connected to smaller networks of commercial and noncommercial transportation routes. Among notable trade routes was the Amber Road, which served as a dependable network for long-distance trade. Maritime trade along the Spice Route became prominent during the Middle Ages, when nations resorted to military means for control of this influential route. During the Middle Ages, organizations such as the Hanseatic League, aimed at protecting interests of the merchants, and trade became increasingly prominent.|$|E

5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1877, {{tensions}} erupted in <b>stoppages</b> and civil unrest across the nation in what would {{become known as the}} Great Railroad Strike or simply the Great Strikes. Violence began in Martinsburg, West Virginia and spread along the rail lines through Baltimore and on to several major cities and transportation hubs of the time, including Reading, Scranton and Shamokin, Pennsylvania; a bloodless general strike in St. Louis, Missouri; and a short lived uprising in Chicago, Illinois. In the worst case, rioting in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania left 61 dead and 124 injured. Much of the city's center was burned, including more than a thousand rail cars destroyed. What began as the peaceful actions of organized labor attracted the masses of working discontent and unemployed of the depression, along with others who took opportunistic advantage of the chaos. In total, an estimated 100,000 workers participated nationwide. State and federal troops followed the unrest as it spread along the rail lines from city to city, beginning in Baltimore, where the movement of troops itself provoked a violent response that ultimately required federal intervention to quell.|$|E

Buemi was fourth-fastest; Robin Frijns was fifth and Piquet sixth. Turvey was seventh-fastest, Vergne eighth, Prost ninth and Maro Engel completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. Turvey impacted the chicane's barrier with Adam Carroll and Bird spinning their cars in the fifth turn. Loïc Duval's left-front tyre lost a wheel nut, causing it to become detached and the session was red flagged. As {{a result of the}} red flag to retrieve Duval's tire and the two <b>stoppages</b> seen in the first practice session, the second 45-minute practice period was extended by five minutes. Shortly after the session restarted, Engel stopped at the turn one exit with car problems but a second red flag was not required because he was off the track. Di Grassi pushed hard and went into the turn four wall, damaging his car's front-right corner and rear-end, and yellow flags were waved to warn drivers about the incident.|$|E

5|$|The {{intensity}} of the fighting had led to a severe shortage of ammunition among the defenders, and attempts to resupply the Australians were plagued by heavy shelling. The use of salvaged ammunition stabilised the situation momentarily after one of B Company's two Vickers medium machine-guns was destroyed by Chinese shelling, and its ammunition belts were subsequently broken up and dispersed among the riflemen. However, this soon resulted in {{a large number of}} mechanical failures and weapon <b>stoppages,</b> causing additional problems for the defenders. The evacuation of casualties was again an issue, and the Assault Pioneer Platoon—commanded by Lieutenant Jock McCormick—was used as stretcher bearers and to run ammunition forward, as were a number of the other specialist platoons. Their ammunition nearly exhausted, the Australians resorted to kicking and strangling many of the attacking Chinese during the brutal fighting. Fearing the Australians would be overwhelmed by the persistent Chinese attacks, Taylor ordered the Borderers and Shropshires to detach their Korean porters to resupply the Australians, while a full divisional concentration of artillery was fired in support of 3 RAR.|$|E
