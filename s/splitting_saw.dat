40|$|The {{present study}} {{was carried out in}} a {{slaughterhouse}} in Khartoum State to assess the meat hygiene practices. Ten critical control points were selected in a cattle slaughter line. They included working tools, air of cattle slaughter hall and various parts of the carcasses. Eight hundred and twelve samples (swabs) were collected and examined bacteriologically during the period of December 2009 to October 2010 to identify the types and species of aerobic bacteria and anaerobic bacteria present in the various critical control points (killing knives, skinning knives, finishing knives, knives used to open of abdomen, beef <b>splitting</b> <b>saw,</b> meat before and after wash, refrigerated meat). A total of 908 isolates were detected, and the main Gram positive bacteria isolates were Staphylococcus caseolyticus (38. 4 %) Staph. capare (4. 2 %), Staph. epidermidis (4. 9 %), Staph. cohnii(0. 22 %), Staph. schleiferi (0. 11 %), Streptococcus pyogenus (3. 99 %), Micrococcus kristinae (11. 09 %), Micrococcus varians(8. 65 %), Bacillus cereus (4. 99 %), Bacillus firmus (0. 22 %), Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis (0. 89 %), Aerococcus (22. 51 %), Anaerobic cocci (0. 44 %), Kurthia gibsonii (0. 11 %). Regarding the stages of the slaughtering process, the highest number of isolates appeared {{at the end of the}} work day while the lowest number of isolates are present at the start of the work. The highest level of contamination was in the air of cattle slaughter hall (251 isolates) and meat before wash (168 isolates) and beef <b>splitting</b> <b>saw</b> (110 isolates). The lowest level of contamination occurred in killing knives (19 isolates) and refrigerated meat (22 isolates). The most predominant organism isolated was the Staphylococcus sp. No E. coli or salmonella were isolated in any of the critical control points...|$|E
40|$|There is an {{abundance}} of critical hygiene points {{in connection with the}} handling of the head and the harvesting of head tissues. If a wide range of precautions is not taken, then the danger of cross-contamination of carcasses, abattoir workers, the environment, equipment, and even wastewater is unavoidable. The most critical process stage, in terms of edible meat contamination with specified risk material (SRM), is the current common practice of the longitudinal splitting of the carcass. The carcass <b>splitting</b> <b>saw</b> poses a particular risk in terms of cross-contamination of carcasses, equipment, surfaces and operatives. Tissues of central nervous system (CNS) carry almost all of the infectivity in cattle subclinically and clinically affected by the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) agent. Should animals suffering from subclinical BSE enter the usual commercial slaughter procedure, {{it is likely that the}} BSE prion, amongst others, will be disseminated onto the processed carcasses. If such carcasses are consumed by humans this may lead to the development of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD). Protocols ensuring the safe handling of head and harvesting of head tissues, alternative methods of spinal column/cord removal for reducing the contamination of carcass and/or the environment and measures for the protection of operatives in the abattoir are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{was carried out in}} a {{slaughter}} house in Khartoum state to asses the meat hygiene practices. Ten critical control points were selected in a cattle slaughter line. They included working tools, hands of the workers and various parts of the carcasses. Five hundred and seventy six samples were examined bacteriologically to identify the types and species of aerobic bacteria which were present in the various critical control points. Both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were isolated. The Gram-positive bacteria were Staph aureus, Staph xylosus, Staph lentus, Staph auricularis, Staph hominis, Bacillus cereus and Micrococcus spp. Escherichia coli were the only Gram-negative bacteria isolated. Regarding the stages of the work {{it was found that the}} highest number of isolates appeared at the middle stage of work. while the lowest number of isolates present at the starting of the work. It was also found that the lowest number of isolates present on the outer surface of the carcass trunk. The highest number of isolates was obtained from the skinning knife (CCP٢) and the <b>splitting</b> <b>saw</b> (CCP٨). The most predominant organisms isolated in this study were Staphylococcus species. An important observation in the present study is that no Salmonella or Pseudomonas were isolated in any of the critical control points...|$|E

40|$|The beef {{industry}} has made tremendous strides in reducing pathogen contamination on carcasses. Multiple antimicrobial interventions have been validated {{for their use}} during harvesting. Information in regards to cross-contamination with pathogens in the post-harvest environment is limited. Surrogate microorganisms for enteric pathogens are commonly used to validate antimicrobial interventions and might allow for the simulation of cross-contamination through the post-harvest environment. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine how the post-harvest environment impacts the direct and indirect transmission of pathogens. This was achieved by using fluorescent protein-marked surrogate strains of Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 and Salmonella spp. from inoculated carcasses to the adjacent ones and to the equipment and facility in three different abattoirs. Thirteen hide-on carcasses were inoculated using a gelatin-based slurry containing three nonpathogenic fluorescent protein-marked strains of E. coli biotype I. In order to determine direct and indirect cross-contamination, inoculated and adjacent carcasses were sampled (300 cm 2) during the harvesting process at different stages: after hide opening (AHO), prior to evisceration (PE), after evisceration (AE), after splitting (AS), and after final intervention (AFI). Environmental samples consisting of the floor, walls, and air were tested as well as personal equipment including gloves, boots, and aprons. Equipment including hand knives, air knives, meat hooks, hide puller and <b>split</b> <b>saw</b> were also sampled. Results showed evidence of cross-contamination between inoculated carcasses and the adjacent non-inoculated ones for all abattoirs. Although this occurred in all abattoirs, surrogate counts on carcasses were below detectable levels (< 1. 4 log CFU/cm 2) after antimicrobial interventions. Surrogates were found in low levels for all environmental samples. However surrogate counts from equipment such as knives, <b>split</b> <b>saws,</b> meat hooks, and hide puller were more frequently detected (15 percent) than those found on the floor, air and walls samples (10 percent). In the case of aprons, boots, and gloves, the prevalence of countable surrogate samples was 7 percent...|$|R

50|$|Rip cut {{comes from}} rip: to <b>split</b> or <b>saw</b> timber in the {{direction}} of the grain, and cut: to divide with a sharp-edged instrument.Wood may also be split along the grain (riven), but the split will follow the grain and usually not be flat. Knots also prevent riving thus the need for rip cuts. A kerf is the opening in the wood made by the saw.|$|R

50|$|The Redmondite Split of the Volunteers, in September 1914, thrust Hunter {{even further}} {{into the realm of}} the IRB elite. With the {{departure}} of Bulmer Hobson from the IRB Supreme Council, Hunter was appointed to the body. For reasons unknown, he attended only one meeting and resigned his seat to Sean Tobin. It is also at this time that MacDonagh moved to the Dublin Brigade Command, thereby leaving Hunter as de facto Commandant of the 2nd Battalion. The <b>split</b> <b>saw</b> around 75% {{of the members of the}} Volunteers follow John Redmond and the Irish Parliamentary Party into the ranks of the British military and The Great War. Those that remained were committed and had full confidence in their leaders. This attitude was summed up by Professor Liam Ó Briain: At last we had a real body with a real purpose. Organisation was improved by able leaders like Thomas MacDonagh, of the Dublin Brigade, and Brigade-Adjutant Éamon de Valera; Ned Daly and Piaras Béaslaí in the first battalions; Tom Hunter, Eamon Price, and Richard Mulcahy in the second, Eamon Ceannt and Cathal Brugha in the fourth.|$|R
50|$|This was {{immediately}} {{opposed by the}} Revolutionary Tendency of the SWP, and by the SLL in Britain and the PCI in France, {{as well as many}} orthodox Trotskyists throughout the world. Those currents still valued the political lessons learned from the 1953 <b>split.</b> They <b>saw</b> the SWP's decision as an abandonment of the most basic principles of the Fourth International, and of Trotskyism, and as an attempt to ingratiate itself to the growing middle class protest movement in the United States.|$|R
