That if he corrupted anyone, he asks: why have they not come forward to bear witnesses? That if the corrupted Athenians are ignorant of having been corrupted, then why have their families not spoken on their behalf? In point of fact, Socrates indicates relatives of the Athenian youth he supposedly corrupted are present in court, giving him moral support.|$|E
25|$|Pro-Israel {{groups have}} {{regularly}} accused Bedier {{of being the}} spokesman for Dr. Sami Al-Arian, a former University of South Florida Professor who was indicted on terrorism related charges. In December 2005, a Florida federal jury acquitted Al-Arian on the eight of seventeen charges he faced and deadlocked on the remainder. Al-Arian later settled the remaining charges by pleading guilty to one count of non-violent material support. Bedier <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> met or spoke to Dr. Al-Arian {{and did not know}} of Al-Arian before his arrest.|$|E

Recently, however, the {{remnants}} have begun to organize. Whitting believes a new Don has emerged, but is unsure who it may be. Reed's investigation eventually leads to Vincent Tuzzi (Fred Berman). When Reed interrogates him, he <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> met the OCU mole; all their business was conducted over the phone. All Tuzzi knows {{is that he has}} a Spanish accent.|$|E

25|$|Farrakhan {{was born}} Louis Eugene Walcott in The Bronx, New York, the younger of two sons of Sarah Mae Manning (January 16, 1900 – November 18, 1988) and Percival Clark, {{immigrants}} from the Caribbean islands. His mother was born in Saint Kitts and Nevis. His father was a Jamaican native. The couple split before Louis was born. Farrakhan <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> knew his biological father. His mother then moved in with Louis Wolcott from Barbados, who became his stepfather. After Louis' stepfather died in 1936, the Wolcott family moved to Boston, Massachusetts, where they settled in the West Indian neighborhood of Roxbury.|$|E
25|$|Lively {{tries to}} {{drive a wedge between}} Kenehan and the miners by convincing a young widow, Bridey Mae Tolliver, to falsely accuse Kenehan of sexual assault, and he plants a letter which makes Kenehan appear to be the infiltrator. Danny Radnor overhears Hickey and Griggs talking about the scheme but is caught and held by the two men. The agents intend to keep a watchful eye on Danny, but become drunk and are not paying {{attention}} that night when Danny, while preaching at the Freewill church, relates a parable about Joseph that convinces the miners that they have been deceived by a false story. One of the miners hurries to the camp to find Few Clothes (James Earl Jones), who had drawn the short straw for who would kill Kenehan for his assumed treachery. Few Clothes tells Kenehan he is there to guard him when he comments on the gun the black miner has. Asked whether he knows how to use it, Few Clothes says yes, {{that he was in the}} Spanish–American War of 1898. Kenehan tells him that he was in Fort Leavenworth Military Penitentiary in 1917, and saw Mennonites imprisoned for refusing to bear arms passively resist having their beards shaved and rip the buttons off their prison clothes, since all these were against their religion. They were punished by being handcuffed to cell bars for eight hours per day, until the cuffs had cut into their wrists and caused gangrene. Despite it all, they ripped off re-sewn buttons with their teeth, not one giving up. Kenehan <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> saw braver men, and ironically they were in there for refusing to fight. This tale of bravery and injustice leaves Few Clothes conflicted and unsure about his mission to execute Kenehan. Another miner arrives and tells Few Clothes the truth and Kenehan's execution is called off just in time. Meanwhile, Sephus has made his way back to town and informed the others of Lively's betrayal, furiously burning down his restaurant. Lively flees town by swimming across the Tug Fork River.|$|E

500|$|While {{working on}} the Pawnee summer catalog, Leslie (Amy Poehler) excitedly organizes a reunion between Ron (Nick Offerman) and his three predecessors. She anticipates a joyous {{occasion}} and plans {{to write a letter}} about it for the catalog. However, none of the four men get along with each other, and all of them are difficult to get along with. One of them (Dakin Matthews) litters repeatedly, treats everybody disrespectfully, and cheerfully <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> gave a damn about the Parks department and only took the job because it had an easy path to job security and a lucrative pension. Another one (Jack Wallace) exhibits a sexist attitude, and tells Leslie she should not be working there due to menstruation issues. The third (Michael Gross) constantly talks about his affinity for marijuana, {{going so far as to}} say [...] "I've planted marijuana in community gardens across this city," [...] and particularly clashes with Ron (who forced him out of the position years ago) who cheerfully confirms he screwed his predecessor over and otherwise is his usual detached self. Later, a frustrated Leslie decides she cannot write the catalog letter; she stops treating the former directors with any respect by telling the sexist to shut up and calling them [...] "turds" [...] when she briefly takes a throwaway picture and then walks away from without another word. Ron takes her out to dinner to apologize, and the two process their mutual respect for each other, and vow they will never grow to hate each other the way the four former directors do. Ron even tells Leslie that he wants her to take over his Parks Director position if he becomes Pawnee's City Manager. However, Ron cheerfully says in an interview that one of his first acts as City Manager would be to eliminate the Parks department, while Leslie gives an equally upbeat interview where she says one of her first acts as City Manager, were she to leapfrog Ron for the job, would be to double the department's size.|$|E
2500|$|In the BBC science-fiction sitcom Red Dwarf, one of {{the main}} characters, Arnold Rimmer, tells of his family {{belonging}} to an obscure fundamentalist Christian sect, the [...] "Seventh Day Advent Hoppists". According to Rimmer – who is revealed in another episode to have the middle name Judas due to his parents' unconventional take on Christianity – the Hoppists' unique form of worship arose from a misprinted Bible wherein 1 Corinthians 13:13 reads [...] "Faith, hop and charity, and the greatest of these is hop." [...] The membership consequently spent every Sunday hopping. Rimmer <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> agreed with the faith, but claims to be liberal on religious matters.|$|E

2500|$|Freud {{regarded}} the monotheistic God as an illusion {{based upon the}} infantile emotional need for a powerful, supernatural pater familias. He maintained that religion – once necessary to restrain man's violent nature {{in the early stages}} of civilization – in modern times, can be set aside in favor of reason and science. [...] "Obsessive Actions and Religious Practices" [...] (1907) notes the likeness between faith (religious belief) and neurotic obsession. Totem and Taboo (1913) proposes that society and religion begin with the patricide and eating of the powerful paternal figure, who then becomes a revered collective memory. These arguments were further developed in The Future of an Illusion (1927) in which Freud argued that religious belief serves the function of psychological consolation. Freud argues the belief of a supernatural protector serves as a buffer from man's [...] "fear of nature" [...] just as the belief in an afterlife serves as a buffer from man's fear of death. The core idea of the work is that all of religious belief can be explained through its function to society, not for its relation to the truth. This is why, according to Freud, religious beliefs are [...] "illusions". In Civilization and Its Discontents (1930), he quotes his friend Romain Rolland, who described religion as an [...] "oceanic sensation", but <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> experienced this feeling. Moses and Monotheism (1937) proposes that Moses was the tribal pater familias, killed by the Jews, who psychologically coped with the patricide with a reaction formation conducive to their establishing monotheist Judaism; analogously, he described the Roman Catholic rite of Holy Communion as cultural evidence of the killing and devouring of the sacred father.|$|E
2500|$|Jesse is an Australian {{resistance}} sailor and Derek Reese's love interest. In her timeline, she {{sailed to}} Australia to deliver supplies aboard the upgraded nuclear submarine , captained by a reprogrammed Terminator, Queeg, {{of which she}} is the executive officer. Queeg diverts the submarine {{to pick up a}} package and return it to John Connor. Her crew is curious of what is in the package so they open it. Inside is a T-1001 and one of the crew members, a woman, points her gun at it. The T-1001 kills her and takes her form, then shakes its finger at the rest of the crew. Queeg kills a crewman after he beat on Jesse. Jesse does not trust Queeg so she relieves him of command. Queeg does not obey her orders so she terminates him and destroys the submarine in an attempt to kill the T-1001. On her way out, she encounters the T-1001 and it tells her, [...] "the answer is no." [...] In 2007, she is on a possibly self-imposed mission to find and stop Cameron from adversely influencing young John, by recruiting Riley Dawson in the future and bringing her back to frame Cameron for her murder. In the future from which Jesse comes, John has withdrawn from humans and speaks only with Cameron. It is unclear whether this mission is self-appointed, but comments by her and the fact she was able to access the time travel machinery with Riley suggests others in the Resistance leadership group may share her concerns about Cameron's influence on John. John Connor later figures out that Jesse killed Riley and informs Derek, but orders her life to be spared. Derek confronts Jesse. He tells her that they are from two different futures and that he doesn't know who she is. He tells her, [...] "John Connor wanted to let you go. I'm not John Connor." [...] He pulls his gun on her and she takes off running. Whether or not Derek actually kills her is left ambiguous, although he does pull the trigger on his handgun. When asked about it by John he just says, [...] "John Connor wanted to let her go." [...] This could either mean that he obeyed John Connor's order or since he is not John Connor, he didn't want to let her go and he shot her. Later on in a flashback, Cameron is seen talking to Jesse. Cameron tells her that she is sorry for her loss. She says that the pressure from leaving the submarine killed her baby, she was pregnant with Derek's baby. Jesse tells Cameron, [...] "Tell John Connor it said [...] "The answer is no"" [...] Then, Jesse asks Cameron, [...] "If the answer is no, what was the question?" [...] Cameron answers with, [...] "Will you join us?" [...] Cameron tells Derek about the miscarriage and he <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> had any kids.|$|E
