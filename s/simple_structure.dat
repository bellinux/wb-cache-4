5|$|Also in 1904 {{he built}} the Chalet de Catllaràs, in La Pobla de Lillet, for the Asland cement factory, owned by Eusebi Güell. It has a <b>simple</b> <b>structure</b> though very original, {{in the shape}} of a pointed arch, with two {{semi-circular}} flights of stairs leading to the top two floors. This building fell into ruin when the cement works closed, and when it was eventually restored its appearance was radically altered, the ingenious original staircase being replaced with a simpler metal one. In the same area he created the Can Artigas Gardens between 1905 and 1907, in an area called Font de la Magnesia, commissioned by the textile merchant Joan Artigas i Alart; men who had worked the Park Güell were also involved on this project, similar to the famous park in Barcelona.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of Henry's expansion, StPeter ad Vincula, a Norman chapel which had {{previously}} stood outside the Tower, was incorporated into the castle. Henry decorated the chapel by adding glazed windows, and stalls {{for himself and his}} queen. It was rebuilt by EdwardI at a cost of over £300 and again by HenryVIII in 1519; the current building dates from this period, although the chapel was refurbished in the 19thcentury. Immediately west of Wakefield Tower, the Bloody Tower was built {{at the same time as}} the inner ward's curtain wall, and as a water-gate provided access to the castle from the River Thames. It was a <b>simple</b> <b>structure,</b> protected by a portcullis and gate. The Bloody Tower acquired its name in the 16thcentury, as it was believed to be the site of the murder of the Princes in the Tower. Between 1339 and 1341, a gatehouse was built into the curtain wall between Bell and Salt Towers. During the Tudor period, a range of buildings for the storage of munitions was built along the inside of the north inner ward. The castle buildings were remodelled during the Stuart period, mostly under the auspices of the Office of Ordnance. In 1663 just over £4,000 was spent building a new storehouse (now known as the New Armouries) in the inner ward. Construction of the Grand Storehouse north of the White Tower began in 1688, on the same site as the dilapidated Tudor range of storehouses; it was destroyed by fire in 1841. The Waterloo Block, a former barracks in the castellated Gothic Revival style with Domestic Tudor details, was built on the site and remains to this day, housing the Crown Jewels on the ground floor.|$|E

Since then, royal funerals have employed such simplified designs for the merumat and men, and the terms are now only used to distinguish the rank of the deceased.|$|E

25|$|After {{the fall}} of the Kamakura shogunate in 1333, the Ashikaga shogunate was formed, having later its seat in the Kyoto {{district}} of Muromachi. The proximity of the shogunate to the imperial court led to a rivalry in the upper levels of society which caused tendencies toward luxurious goods and lifestyles. Aristocratic houses were adapted from the simple buke-zukuri style to resemble the earlier shinden-zukuri style. A good example of this ostentatious architecture is the Kinkaku-ji in Kyōto, which is decorated with lacquer and gold leaf, in contrast to its otherwise <b>simple</b> <b>structure</b> and plain bark roofs.|$|E
25|$|In Portugal, castles are {{directly}} related with military needs {{and the state of}} continuous warfare characterised by the Reconquista. Populations living closer of the border between Christians and Muslims were under threat of constant raids and the advance of either sides in pursue of territorial conquest. The region more precociously fortified was the area south of the Douro river, where in the 10th century almost all the population centers had their castle. The majority of these defensive positions, the rural castles, were of very <b>simple</b> <b>structure</b> and took advantage of natural conditions such as high places with granite outcrops, that made access difficult. During the next three centuries (10th to 13th centuries) we witness a boom of castles due to the ever growing necessity to provide a territorial passive defense.|$|E
25|$|The Early Dynastic period (abbreviated ED {{period or}} ED) is an archaeological culture in Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq) that is {{generally}} dated to c. 2900–2350 BC. It {{was preceded by}} the Uruk and Jemdet Nasr periods, and saw the invention of writing {{and the formation of}} the first cities and states. The ED itself was characterized by the existence of multiple city-states: small states with a relatively <b>simple</b> <b>structure</b> that developed and solidified over time. This development ultimately led to the unification of much of Mesopotamia under the rule of Sargon, the first monarch of the Akkadian Empire. Despite this political fragmentation, the ED city-states shared a relatively homogeneous material culture. Sumerian cities like Uruk, Ur, Lagash, Umma and Nippur, located in Lower Mesopotamia, were very powerful and influential. To the north and west stretched states centered on cities such as Kish, Mari, Nagar and Ebla.|$|E

25|$|Basal Ichthyopterygia, {{like their}} land-dwelling ancestors, still had {{vertebrae}} that possessed {{a full set}} of processes that allowed them to interlock and articulate, forming a vertebral column supporting the weight of the body. As ichthyosaurs were fully aquatic, their bodies were supported by the Archimedes force exerted by the water; in other words, they were buoyant. Therefore, the vertebral processes had lost much of their function. Early ichthyosaurs proper had rear dorsal vertebrae that had become disc-shaped, like those of typical fishes. With more derived species, the front dorsals also became discs. Gradually, most processes were lost, including those for rib attachment. The vertebral bodies became much shorter. The front and rear sides of the discs were hollowed out, resulting in a so-called amphicoelous condition. A transverse cross-section of such a vertebra has an hourglass shape. This morphology is unique within the Amniota and makes discerning ichthyosaur vertebrae from those of other marine reptiles easy. The only process that kept its function was the spine at the top, serving as an attachment for the dorsal muscles. However, even the spine became a <b>simple</b> <b>structure.</b> The neural arch, of which it was an outgrowth, typically no longer fused to the vertebral centre.|$|E
25|$|Part of {{the public}} support for the stadium came from it being built to also support being used by the Eskimos. The plans were met with {{opposition}} from local residents. There were also discussions regarding the necessity of a $50,000 royal retirement room and the allocation of training and office space to the Eskimos. The largest discussion was related to whether the stadium needed a roof or dome. As the roof would cost $18.2 million, there was limited public support and the stadium was built without one. In an attempt to further the roof process, the Eskimos offered to pay $1.6 million towards the roof. An enclosement would not be permitted used during the Commonwealth Games, so the design would have to call for the roof to be added afterwards. Among the opponents of the roof was Commonwealth Games Foundation President Maury Van Vilet, that experience from construction of the Olympic Stadium in Montreal showed the necessity of building a <b>simple</b> <b>structure.</b> An alternative design, which would have cost an additional $7.3 million, was launched by the Eskimos in August 1975, but rejected by the city council. A major concern for the city council were the large cost overruns which were being experienced in Montreal at the time.|$|E
25|$|For {{the next}} 150years, {{there is no}} record of {{building}} work, although accounts are incomplete. The Well Tower is thought to date from the early 14th century. If there was no work on the castle, this may indicate that it was not important enough to warrant expenditure beyond upkeep, as Lancaster was not near a border. Though the region was generally peaceful, the Scots invaded in 1322 and 1389, reaching Lancaster and damaging the castle. The holdings of the Duchy of Lancaster extended beyond the county, and Lancaster was not especially important. However, when Henry Duke of Lancaster ascended the throne as King HenryIV in 1399, he almost immediately began adding the monumental gatehouse. A further devastation of the town, as inflicted in 1389, would have been an embarrassment for the new king; his expensive programme of building at the castle helped protect against this. The gatehouse Henry replaced was probably a <b>simple</b> <b>structure,</b> no more than a passage between two towers, but once complete, it rivalled the keep as the strongest part of the castle. Records show that between 1402 and 1422, the year HenryIV died, over £2,500 was spent on building work. While most of this sum would have been spent on the gatehouse, some may have been used to make alterations to the top storey of the keep. Since then, the castle has remained in the ownership of the Crown.|$|E
