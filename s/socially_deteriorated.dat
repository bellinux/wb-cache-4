40|$|In Sweden {{sales of}} alcohol dropped 17 % from 1976 to 1982. Similarly, {{comparison}} {{of data from}} 1979 and 1982 shows that the mortality from cirrhosis of the liver declined appreciably, by 28 % in men and 29 % in women. During 1979 - 82 mortality from pancreatitis also declined noticeably, by 30 % in men and 36 % in women. By contrast, no decrease occurred in mortality from alcoholic psychosis, alcoholism, or alcohol intoxication. The decrease in mortality from cirrhosis of the liver and pancreatitis is probably explained by {{a decrease in the}} consumption of alcohol among an important subgroup of high consumers of alcohol. The lack of a decrease in mortality from alcoholic psychosis, alcoholism, and alcohol intoxication may be because such diagnoses are often made in <b>socially</b> <b>deteriorated,</b> more dependent alcoholic subjects who {{have not been able to}} reduce their consumption...|$|E
50|$|The {{site of the}} Polygon is now {{occupied}} by a block of council flats called Oakshott Court, which features a commemorative plaque for Wollstonecraft. The Polygon <b>deteriorated</b> <b>socially</b> as the surrounding land was subsequently sold off in smaller lots for cheaper housing, especially {{after the start of}} construction in the 1830s of the railway lines into Euston, St Pancras and King's Cross. In this period the area housed a large transient population of labourers and the population density of the area soared. By the late 19th century most of the houses were in multiple occupation, and overcrowding was severe with whole families sometimes living in one room, as confirmed by the social surveys of Charles Booth and Irene Barclay. Dickens lived in the Polygon briefly as a child.|$|R
40|$|Excerpt] In today’s global marketplace, {{organizations}} {{no longer}} operate with linear supply chains or manufacturing models. The issue of global labor standards {{has been a}} debated topic since the 1990 ’s and industry supply chains continue to provoke discussions around labor standards and improving worker conditions[i]. Nike presents the classic example of an organization that exploited its outsourcing model and was ultimately forced to take accountability for its actions in the 1990 ’s. Today’s millennial generation alongside consumer groups is now addressing Steve Job’s legacy, Apple and its primary supplier, Foxconn. On June 14 th 2012, a Foxconn employee jumped to his death from his apartment building; marking the 18 th reported worker suicide at Foxconn factories in China in just over two years[ii]. Many additional suicides may have gone unreported. But these deaths and the focus on conditions at Foxconn reflect {{only a portion of}} the troubling conditions at Apple suppliers that includes issues around organizational work design and employee working conditions. As consumer confidence in the ability of corporations to be <b>socially</b> responsible <b>deteriorates</b> {{it is up to the}} HR function to play a strategic role in navigating and providing strategic solutions to maintaining fair global labor standards within an organization. In this paper, I will discuss the role of HR to be more involved as a line leader that looks to integrate global labor standards compliance as an essential element in an organizations business model. I will also discuss the need for HR to push for the centrality of compliance in organizations along with the necessary layers of oversight while creating an organizational culture that fosters and encourages socially responsible behavior of subcontractors and suppliers...|$|R
40|$|Interpersonal {{violence}} {{is a matter of}} growing concern. Where the safety of the common man is concerned, the dangerousness of mental patients, the ongoing de-institutionalization within psychiatry, and the role of alcohol is disputed. In order to analyze the significance of abuse and mental disorder in violent behaviour, this subject was approached from two different perspectives; from a specific violent offence - homicide - examining the mental status of the offenders, and from individuals with a specific mental disorder - schizophrenia -and assessing the rate of criminal offence amongst them. Homicides in northern Sweden and in Stockholm, legally characterized as murder, manslaughter or assault and causing another’s death, and homicides followed by the offenders’ suicide, were studied. Medicolegal autopsy records, police reports, pretrial psychiatric reports and court records were collected and scrutinized. The criminal records of 644 persons, discharged from hospitals in Stockholm with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, were studied. The relative risk of criminal offence was analyzed by indirect standardization using the general population as a standard. Violent offenders were further examined from psychiatric records. In the homicide material, 16 females and 160 males killed 94 men, 78 women, and 15 children. Forty percent of all surviving offenders were abusers without a major mental disorder, 39 % were mentally disordered, 11 % committed suicide, and 10 % were considered "normal". The abusers and their victims were older, often <b>socially</b> and mentally <b>deteriorated,</b> and well known to each other. The victim was the prime aggressor in half of the cases. Killings by mentally disordered persons and by those who committed suicide were characterized by intimacy between offender and victim; one third were also abusers. Multiple homicides and child murder were mainly seen among homicide-suicice cases. The "normal" offenders were more often of foreign origin and two thirds of the victims initiated the violence by physical attacks. Relatively more of the homicides in northern Sweden concerned intimate parties, use of firearms, and cases of homicide-suicide, as compared to homicides in Stockholm where drug abuse was more prevalent. Sixteen offenders (9 %) in the homicide sample had schizophrenia (all males), while 38 subjects (6 %) in the cohort of schizophrenics had committed a violent offence. No homicide was recorded and most of the offences were of minor severity. The rate of violent offence was four times higher in the study group as compared to the general population. Most homicides involved closely related persons with separation and dependence as the dominating psychological theme, especially in homicide- suicide cases. Intoxication was regularly seen among the abusers but not among the non-abusers. The acute effect of alcohol intoxication may be of lesser importance in violence as compared to the long-term effects of abuse. Schizophrenics do not impress as a particularly dangerous group. Prevention by psychiatry is difficult; most offenders did not have any contact with psychiatry prior to the act. S. 1 - 70 : sammanfattning, s. 71 - 176 : 5 uppsatser digitalisering@um...|$|R
