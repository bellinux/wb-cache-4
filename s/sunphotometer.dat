5000|$|The program uses various inputs that {{describe}} the atmospheric conditions {{for which the}} irradiance spectra are to be calculated. Ideal conditions, based on various possible model atmospheres and aerosol models, can be selected by the user. Alternatively, realistic conditions can also be specified as inputs, based for example on aerosol and water vapor data provided by a <b>sunphotometer.</b> In turn, these realistic conditions are necessary to compare the modeled spectra to those measured by a spectroradiometer. Reciprocally, since the model is well validated, this comparative method {{can be used as}} guidance to detect malfunction or miscalibration of instruments. The original spectral resolution of the model is 0.5 nm in the UV, 1 nm in the visible and near-infrared, and 5 nm above 1700 nm. To facilitate comparisons between the modeled spectra and actual measurements at a different spectral resolution, the SMARTS post-processor may be used to smooth the modeled spectra and adapt them to simulate the optical characteristics of a specific spectroradiometer. Additionally, the model provides the spectrally-integrated (or [...] "broadband") irradiance values, which can then be compared to measurements from a pyrheliometer (for direct radiation) or pyranometer (for diffuse or global radiation) at any instant. Besides the atmospheric conditions, another important input is the solar geometry, which can be defined by the sun position (zenith angle and azimuth), the air mass, or by specifying the date, time and location.|$|E

As part of this experiment five automated, tracking <b>sunphotometers</b> were present to measure total column aerosol optical depth over the three-week period. which included many clear days or parts of days that were clear.

A wide range of aerosol types was encountered throughout the ACE- 2 area, including background Atlantic marine, European pollution-derived, and (although less frequently than expected) African mineral dust. During the two days discussed here, vertical profiles flown in cloud free air masses revealed three distinctly different layers: a marine boundary layer (MBL) with varying pollution levels, an elevated dust layer, and a very clean layer between the MBL and the dust layer. Based on size-resolved composition information we have established an aerosol model {{that allows us to}} compute optical properties of the ambient aerosol using the optical particle counter results.

In the MBL there is a tendency for the in-situ results to be slightly lower than the <b>sunphotometer</b> measurements (10 - 17 % at lambda= 525 nm), but these differences are within the combined error bars of the measurements and computations. Aerosol size-distribudon closure based on in-situ size distributions and inverted <b>sunphotometer</b> extinction spectra has been achieved in the MBL (total surface area and volume agree within 0. 2, and 7 %, respectively) but not in the dust layer. The fact that the three nephelometers operated at three different relative humidities (RH) allowed to parameterize hygroscopic growth and to therefore estimate optical properties at ambient RH. The parameters derived for different aerosol types are themselves useful for the aerosol modeling community. The fact that the nephelometers and the absorption photometer sampled the aerosol through a cyclone make those measurements less useful for thee closure study carried out here. Large corrections (especially in the dust) had to be applied. Therefore, {{it is not surprising that}} closure with the <b>sunphotometer</b> was not always achieved. Agreement within 0. 02 in AOD was achieved in the dust layer when the airorne <b>sunphotometer</b> extinction or AOD was compared to ground-based lidar measurements.

Comparing aerosol extinction o(550 nm) from four different techniques shows good agreement for the vertical distribution of aerosol layers.

The sigma(550 nm) from airborne in-situ scattering and absorption measurements are about approx. 13 % lower than those obtained from airborne sunphotometry during 14 vertical profiles.

40|$|Aerosol {{observations}} {{are essential for}} understanding the Earth's radiation budget and the complexities of climate change, as {{they are involved in}} the backscattering of solar radiation and the formation of cloud condensation nuclei. In Hong Kong, the most direct effect is on air quality. Atmospheric haze caused by the emission of aerosols from industrial and vehicular sources creates visibility lower than 8 km for approximately 20 % of the time, having risen at 6 % per decade since 1980, but regional emissions are at least as influential as local ones. The 179, 000 km 2 covered by Hong Kong and neighbouring Guangdong Province cannot be adequately covered by the 76 monitoring stations set up by the two governments, and satellite images offer the only potential source of regional air quality data. However, the current satellite-based aerosol optical thickness (AOT) products are intended for global air quality monitoring, and may contain errors over a humid coastal city such as Hong Kong and its surrounding industrialized regions. This research compares the AOT retrieved from several AOT operational products, namely the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MOD 04 product, the MODIS 500 m product, the Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) product, the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) multiwavelength aerosol product, and the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) product, with ground-based AOT from <b>sunphotometers</b> in Hong Kong. These <b>sunphotometers</b> include two AERONET stations, and are deployed in Hong Kong over urban, suburban, and coastal areas. The rigorous correlations, root mean square errors, and mean absolute differences available from the multilocational field data within one city region provide a strong base for validating the AOT products from different sensors and at different spatial scales over different land surface types. The results suggest that the AOT products, especially those from MODIS 10 km, provide reliable and accurate observations for daily air quality monitoring over a variety of land-cover types, as well as for identifying emission sources for coordinated actions by the governments of Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland.

Mr. Livingston participated in instrument calibrations at Mauna Loa Observatory, pre-mission hardware and software preparations, acquisition and analysis of <b>sunphotometer</b> measurements during the missions, and post-mission analysis of data and reporting of scientific findings. The atmospheric field missions included the spring 2001 Intensive of the Asian Pacific Regional Aerosol Characterization Experiment (ACE-Asia), the Asian Dust Above Monterey- 2003 (ADAM- 2003) experiment, and the winter 2003 Second SAGE III Ozone Loss and Validation Experiment (SOLVE II) ...|$|E
40|$|Regular {{measurements}} of the direct sun radiance, sky radiance in the almucantar and principal plane, and precipitable water vapour content are carried out with the <b>sunphotometer</b> Cimel CE- 318 at the Kishinev site, Moldova. Results obtained with the <b>sunphotometer</b> represent a valuable supplement to the datasets with solar radiation measurements made with the multifunctional ground based radiometric complex. Monitoring of the aerosol optical properties is fulfilled in frame of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) initiated and developed from the NASA/GSFC. Multi-years results of aerosol optical thickness (AOT) measurements made at the Kishinev site, Moldova are presented. Some results obtained during the long distance smoke transport over Kishinev from the forest and peat fires occurred in the west regions of Russia in September 2002 are analyzed. 1...|$|E
40|$|Satellite {{retrieved}} aerosol {{optical properties}} are compared to aircraft measurements for {{a case study}} during the Tropospheric Aerosol Radiative Forcing Observational Experiment (TARFOX). Two satellite instruments are used: the Along Track Scanning Radiometer 2 (ATSR- 2) and the advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR). The aerosol optical depth in the mid-visible (0. 555 Jjm) retrieved from the ATSR- 2 data agrees within 0. 03 with colocated <b>sunphotometer</b> measurements. Also, the spectral behavior of the aerosol optical depth is retrieved accurately. Good correlation is found between aerosol optical depths for AVHRR channel 1 (0. 64 Jjm) and <b>sunphotometer</b> derived values, but the satellite retrieved values are 0. 05 to 0. 15 lower. The Angstrom wavelength exponent is determined both from the ATSR- 2 and the AVHRR data. The ATSR- 2 derived Angstrom exponents are in good agreement with the values computed from the <b>sunphotometer</b> data. The Angstrom exponents determined from AVHRR data show very large variations. Both the ATSR- 2 and the AVHRR aerosol optical depth images show a large gradient. Vertical profile data of temperature, relative humidity, and particle scattering indicate that this gradient is probably caused by changes in the dry aerosol properties, rather than {{a change in the}} relative humidity...|$|E

The {{impacts of the}} dust on the air quality of Hong Kong were quantified using aerosol optical properties from AERONET data and local PM 10 (particle size less than 10 μm) concentrations. Combined analysis of back trajectories and the microphysical properties of the dust aerosols from AERONET inversion {{data suggest that the}} dust particulates are sometimes associated with industrial chemicals on arrival in Hong Kong. This is the first remote-sensing study to observe the presence and characteristics of Asian dust carried into the humid tropical region of south China.

40|$|The {{investigation}} {{focuses on}} two key issues in satellite ocean color remote sensing, namely {{the presence of}} whitecaps on the sea surface and {{the validity of the}} aerosol models selected for the atmospheric correction of SeaWiFS data. Experiments were designed and conducted at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography to measure the optical properties of whitecaps and to study the aerosol optical properties in a typical mid-latitude coastal environment. CIMEL Electronique <b>sunphotometers,</b> now integrated in the AERONET network, were also deployed permanently in Bermuda and in Lanai, calibration/validation sites for SeaWiFS and MODIS. Original results were obtained on the spectral reflectance of whitecaps and on the choice of aerosol models for atmospheric correction schemes and the type of measurements that should be made to verify those schemes. Bio-optical algorithms to remotely sense primary productivity from space were also evaluated, as well as current algorithms to estimate PAR at the earth's surface...|$|R
40|$|African biomass burning {{emission}} inventories for gaseous and particulate {{species have}} been constructed at a resolution of 1 km by 1 km with daily coverage for the 2000 - 2007 period. These inventories are higher than the GFED 2 inventories, which are currently widely in use. Evaluation specifically focusing on combustion aerosol {{has been carried out}} with the ORISAM-TM 4 global chemistry transport model which includes a detailed aerosol module. This paper compares modeled results with measurements of surface BC concentrations and scattering coefficients from the AMMA Enhanced Observations period, aerosol optical depths and single scattering albedo from AERONET <b>sunphotometers,</b> LIDAR vertical distributions of extinction coefficients as well as satellite data. Aerosol seasonal and interannual evolutions over the 2004 - 2007 period observed at regional scale and more specifically at the Djougou (Benin) and Banizoumbou (Niger) AMMA/IDAF sites are well reproduced by our global model, indicating that our biomass burning emission inventory appears reasonable...|$|R
