5000|$|In its beginnings, SonoRodven (As it was {{originally}} named) emerged as a local source for international compilation albums (mostly those produced in the U.S. by companies such as K-Tel). Then it started handling a small roster of local luminaries, some of them also performing as actors for its sister TV network, such as Guillermo Dávila, Karina, Ricardo Montaner, Jose Luis Rodriguez [...] "El Puma", Marcelo, and others. Then the roster began to grow up, and it became the second biggest local record label in Venezuela, alongside Sonográfica, its biggest competitor, from the rival group [...] "Empresas 1BC" [...] (proprietors of rival TV network RCTV, rival radio network RCR, rival record stores chain [...] "Recordland"). Later, in the early-middle eighties, it became the Rodven Group, also comprising Video-Rodven, a commercial home video company, {{as well as other}} small record labels that previously existed in the country, such as Velvet (thus becoming VelvetRodven and later TH-Rodven, an outlet for all Latin dance music oriented artists, and later for other youth and pop acts, such as the late 80s boyband [...] "Los Chamos", from which emerged the Venezuelan singer Carlos Baute), Love Records, and forming alliances with other record labels from around the world for local distribution purposes (thus forming EMI-Rodven, Hispavox-Rodven, Ariola-Rodven, Wea-Rodven et al.). This made Rodven's roster even bigger, allowing for the distribution of both local and foreign acts through a complete radio/TV/distribution platform, which later gave birth also to an artist management and <b>show</b> <b>services</b> company: [...] "Big Show Productions".|$|E

30|$|This {{reluctant}} attitude {{as well as}} {{the generally}} incomplete and inadequate understanding of ES, render it imperative to adopt a comprehensive approach to ES through a participatory process of urban planning. It is crucial to integrate them {{from the very beginning of}} the process and to overcome barriers associated to technical language or to inadequate communication tools that divert participants from engaging in the process, e.g., providing participants with visual ad-hoc post-its and symbols (pictograms) to <b>show</b> <b>services,</b> instead of asking them to draw directly on the map. Part of the work should be performed in the region, for example, with explicative and interactive panels associated to Apps for collaborative cartography. All these tools will facilitate the discussion about desirable future scenarios.|$|E
40|$|The service {{component}} of manufacturing activities {{has largely been}} neglected. Small firms are of particular interest because services are often seen as especially critical in establishing their competitive advantage. Drawing on data from face-to-face interviews with the owner-managers of Finnish and UK small printing firms and their employees and professional print buyers, this study addresses the earlier neglect by offering a theorised analysis of service capability in printing firms, that is the role {{and scope of the}} services within the manufacturing context as mediated through customer-firm interaction. Although the interviewees perceived services as being important, the findings show that their role and character varied among firms, {{depending on the type of}} product, customer characteristics and other factors including national differences. However, quality, price and delivery always had to be taken into account in service provision. The conceptualisations of, and importance attached to, these elements varied and often contradicted each other in practice. A concept, 'the printer's triangle', was valuable in analyzing the multiple perspectives and in showing the differing strategies employed in service provision when quality, price, delivery and other factors were included. In some instances, long-term customer relations were crucial to service delivery. In others, product type and infrequent interaction with customers accompanied differing service forms. UK firms stressed the importance of cost efficiency and flexible labour strategies while Finnish firms relied more on self managing staff and the latest technology in delivering services. Innovative products were especially important in developing added value services in Finland. However, most firms in the study offered products and services where short delivery times and competitive prices rather than added value services were important. A key strategy used by professional buyers was the 'supplier pool', which combined long-term supplier relations with competition between suppliers and downward pressures on prices. The findings and theorization <b>show</b> <b>services</b> as being integral to printing but subject to variations in managerial strategies, internal operational constraints, market and customer characteristics and national differences. The broader implications for small manufacturing firms, service and quality theorisation are outlined with suggestions for further research...|$|E
