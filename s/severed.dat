40|$|Pruning is {{a widely}} {{observed}} mechanism for developing nervous systems to refine their circuitry. During metamorphosis, certain Drosophila sensory neurons undergo large-scale dendrite pruning to remove their larval branches before regeneration of their adult dendrites. Dendrite pruning involves dendrite <b>severing,</b> followed with debris removal. Little {{is known about the}} molecular mechanisms underlying dendrite <b>severing.</b> Here, we show that both the Ik 2 kinase and Katanin p 60 -like 1 (Kat- 60 L 1) of the Katanin family of microtubule <b>severing</b> proteins are required for dendrite <b>severing.</b> Mutant neurons with disrupted Ik 2 function have diminished ability in <b>severing</b> their larval dendrites in pupae. Conversely, premature activation of Ik 2 triggers precocious dendrite <b>severing</b> in larvae, revealing a critical role of Ik 2 in initiating dendrite <b>severing.</b> We found a role for Kat- 60 L 1 in facilitating dendrite <b>severing</b> by breaking microtubule in proximal dendrites, where the dendrites subsequently separate from the soma. Our study thus implicates Ik 2 and Kat- 60 L 1 in dendrite <b>severing</b> that involves local microtubule disassembly...|$|R

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: INF 2 is a formin protein {{with the}} unique ability to {{accelerate}} both actin polymerization and depolymerization, the latter requiring filament <b>severing.</b> Mutations in INF 2 {{lead to the}} kidney disease focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and the neurological disorder Charcot-Marie Tooth disease (CMTD). RESULTS: Here, we compare the <b>severing</b> mechanism of INF 2 {{with that of the}} well-studied <b>severing</b> protein cofilin. INF 2, like cofilin, binds stoichiometrically to filament sides and <b>severs</b> in a manner that requires phosphate release from the filament. In contrast to cofilin, however, INF 2 binds ADP and ADP-Pi filaments equally well. Furthermore, two-color total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy reveals that a low number of INF 2 molecules, as few as a single INF 2 dimer, are capable of <b>severing,</b> while measurable cofilin-mediated <b>severing</b> requires more extensive binding. Hence, INF 2 is a more potent <b>severing</b> protein than cofilin. While a construct containing the FH 1 and FH 2 domains alone has some <b>severing</b> activity, addition of the C-terminal region increases <b>severing</b> potency by 40 -fold, and we show that the WH 2 -resembling DAD motif is responsible for this increase. Helical 3 D reconstruction from electron micrographs at 20  Å resolution provides a structure of filament-bound INF 2, showing that the FH 2 domain encircles the filament. CONCLUSIONS: We propose a <b>severing</b> model in which FH 2 binding and phosphate release causes local filament deformation, allowing the DAD to bind adjacent actin protomers, further disrupting filament structure...|$|R

40|$|CapG is {{the only}} member of the gelsolin family unable to <b>sever</b> actin filaments. Changing amino acids 84 – 91 (<b>severing</b> domain) and 124 – 137 (WH 2 -containing segment) {{simultaneously}} to the sequences of gelsolin results in a mutant, CapG-sev, capable of <b>severing</b> actin filaments. The gain of <b>severing</b> function does not alter actin filament capping, but is accompanied by a higher affinity for monomeric actin, and the capacity to bind and sequester two actin monomers. Analysis of CapG-sev crystal structure suggests a more loosely folded inactive conformation than gelsolin, with a shorter S 1 –S 2 latch. Calcium binding to S 1 opens this latch and S 1 becomes separated from a closely interfaced S 2 –S 3 complex by an extended arm consisting of amino acids 118 – 137. Modeling with F-actin predicts that the length of this WH 2 -containing arm is critical for <b>severing</b> function, and the addition of a single amino acid (alanine or histidine) eliminates CapG-sev <b>severing</b> activity, confirming this prediction. We conclude that efficient <b>severing</b> utilizes two actin monomer-binding sites, and that the length of the WH 2 -containing segment is a critical functional determinant for <b>severing...</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceVillin, an actin-binding protein {{associated}} with the actin bundles that support microvilli, bundles, caps, nucleates and <b>severs</b> actin in a calcium-dependant manner in vitro. We hypothesized that the <b>severing</b> activity of villin is responsible for its reported role in enhancing cell plasticity and motility. To test this hypothesis, we chose a loss of function strategy and introduced mutations in villin based on sequence comparison with CapG. By pyrene-actin assays, we demonstrate that this mutant has a strongly reduced <b>severing</b> activity whereas nucleation and capping remain unaffected. The bundling activity and the morphogenic effects of villin in cells are also preserved in this mutant. We thus succeeded in dissociating the <b>severing</b> from the three other activities of villin. The contribution of villin <b>severing</b> to actin dynamics is analyzed in vivo through the actin-based movement of the intracellular bacteria Shigella flexneri in cells expressing villin and its <b>severing</b> variant. The <b>severing</b> mutations abolish the gain of velocity induced by villin. To further analyze this effect, we reconstituted an in vitro actin-based bead movement in which the usual capping protein is replaced by either the WT or the <b>severing</b> mutant of villin. Confirming the in vivo results, villin <b>severing</b> activity enhances the velocity of beads by more than two folds and reduces the density of actin in the comets. We propose a model in which, by <b>severing</b> actin filaments and capping their barbed-ends, villin increases the concentration of actin monomers available for polymerization, a mechanism that might be paralleled in vivo when an enterocyte undergoes an epithelio-mesenchymal transition...|$|R
