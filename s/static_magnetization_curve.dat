Emphasis {{is on the}} domain-wall {{fine structure}} of antiphase domain walls in the films. The trilayers are produced by sputtering and consist of two Co layers of equal thickness (5 nm), exchange-coupled through a Ru layer of variable thickness. The sign and magnitude of the interlayer exchange are tuned by {{the thickness of the}} Ru interlayer. The exchange and its distribution are investigated by measurements of the <b>static</b> <b>magnetization</b> <b>curves.</b> For a Ru thickness of 0. 4 nm, the exchange is predominantly antiferromagnetic and the MFM images show fairly immobile domain walls.

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{modifications of}} the magnetic properties of polycrystalline IrMn/Cr(tCr) /Co films where the Cr spacer thickness tCr was varied between 0. 25 and 3 nm. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy, x-ray diffractometry and reflectivity, as well as x-ray absorption near-edge structure {{were used for the}} structural characterization of the films; <b>static</b> <b>magnetization</b> <b>curves</b> as well as ferromagnetic resonance measurements were employed for the magnetic characterization. Decrease of the exchange-bias field and considerable and nonmonotonous enhancement of the coercivity with tCr were observed. The films’ anisotropy parameters were extracted from the experimental angular variations of the resonance field and from the hard-axis <b>magnetization</b> <b>curves</b> via numerical simulations. It was obtained that the two phenomena studied, namely, the exchange bias and rotatable anisotropy, have different origins. The rotatable anisotropy was ascribed to Cr interface coupled antiferromagnetically with the Co atoms. On the other hand, the occurrence of exchange bias, even for the film with the thickest Cr layer, was attributed to uncompensated spins at the topmost IrMn interface. Together with the significant increase with tCr of the rotatable anisotropy field, near saturation it is antiparallel to the external magnetic field...|$|R

For a physical understanding of these applications, the particles' hydrodynamic size distribution should be well characterized. Magnetorelaxometry is a fast method to determine this property, but until now had the drawback that a priori information, like a functional form of the expected size distribution, was necessary. Following recent advances, where Kaczmarz' algorithm {{was used to determine}} the core size distribution from <b>static</b> <b>magnetization</b> <b>curves</b> without any such assumptions, we present a similar study for the determination of the hydrodynamic size distribution. Here, the performance of several implementations of Kaczmarz' algorithm are investigated for both simulated and measured magnetorelaxometry data.

40|$|Crystallographic {{orientation}} {{dependence of}} Gilbert damping constant, α, has been measured under different static magnetic fields for Fe 70 Co 30 (100) single-crystal thin film samples prepared at various substrate temperatures. Lorentz type resonance peaks are observed for the samples prepared below 200 ºC. For a sample deposited at 400 ºC, broadening of the resonance peak is observed, which is related {{with an increased}} surface roughness. α value decreases monotonically with increasing the static field when the field is applied parallel to the easy magnetization axis, whereas it increases when the field is applied along the hard magnetization axis up to around the anisotropy field and then decreases. The minimum value of α is determined to be 0. 012 for the hard axis under static fields greater than 650 Oe. The value is twice larger {{compared with that of}} Fe(100) single-crystal film.

In the second approach, we use the dynamical matrix method, which is a micromagnetic method, considers the exact (non-uniform) magnetic equilibrium configuration, and returns the complete set of magnetic eigenvalues/eigenmodes. Calculations show the existence of modes with different localization: low frequency modes, localized at the prism ends, and high frequency bulk modes, including the fundamental or quasi-uniform mode.

Furthermore, the obtained differential permeability at working points 1200 A/m and 10000 A/m change almost linearly with the stress in steel wires, the goodness of linear fits are all higher than 0. 987.

PACS. 75. 50. Lk – Spin glasses and other random magnets. Abstract. – The phenomenon of exchange anisotropy {{is well known}} in terms of <b>static</b> <b>magnetization</b> properties such as enhanced coercivity and magnetization loop shifts. These effects are primarily associated with effective anisotropies introduced into a ferromagnet by exchange coupling with a strongly anisotropic antiferromagnet. These effective anisotropies can be understood as manifestations of a more fundamental exchange-induced susceptibility. We show that a consequence of this view is that a class of unusual dynamic effects associated with the exchange susceptibility should also exist. The effects become apparent near the ordering temperature of the antiferromagnet and affect domain wall velocities, domain wall resonances, and precessional switching of the ferromagnet. Exchange anisotropy is a term coined to describe the enhancement ofmagnetic anisotropies in a ferromagnet through contact with an anisotropic antiferromagnet [1].
