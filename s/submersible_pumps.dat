2500|$|Vigilance's {{fire and}} rescue party dragged on board five fire hoses, two <b>submersible</b> <b>pumps,</b> one handy billy pump, and a rescue {{breathing}} apparatus. Ruptured forward water mains on board England had prevented the flooding of the forward magazines, so three hoses from Vigilance and one found on England's deck were trained {{down into the}} [...] ready box, stopping the detonation of the ammunition.

2500|$|Demand was high, and {{a second}} pumping station {{commenced}} operation on 6 July 1899. It was constructed at Pott Street in Ancoats, close to the Rochdale Canal, and had four pumping engines and two accumulators. The number of engines was increased to seven, six of [...] and one of [...] A third pumping station was soon required and was constructed between Water Street and the River Irwell. It had two accumulators, and six steam engines. Coal for the engines was delivered by boat, and it began operating on 14 October 1909. Although all three pumping stations were situated beside waterways, its water supply was obtained from boreholes. The borehole at Whitworth Street was [...] deep, and water at all three was raised by compressed air delivery systems, which lasted until 1948, when they were superseded by <b>submersible</b> <b>pumps.</b> By the 1930s, the system had grown to 35 miles (56km) of pipes working some 2400 machines.|$|E
40|$|The {{diffuser}} inlet width {{is a key}} geometric parameter {{that affects}} <b>submersible</b> <b>pump</b> performance. On the basis of diffuser characteristic curve analyses, diffusers with different inlet widths and the same impeller were equipped to construct a <b>submersible</b> <b>pump</b> model {{through the use of}} AutoCAD software. The performance curves of the <b>submersible</b> <b>pump,</b> with six diffuser inlet widths, were obtained using computational fluid dynamics method. Simultaneously, the simulation results were tested with the experimental method presented in this article. The results show that the optimum value of the inlet width (b 3 [*]=[*] 50 [*]mm) is larger than the experience-based one. With an increase in the inlet width, the optimum operating point of a <b>submersible</b> <b>pump</b> offsets to a larger flow rate. When the guide blade inlet width is approximately 40 – 55 [*]mm, the <b>submersible</b> <b>pump</b> efficiency is relatively high, approximately 75. 9 %– 83. 7 % capacity, and the flow rate is approximately 105 – 135 [*]m 3 /h. The numerical results of <b>submersible</b> <b>pump</b> performance are higher than those of the test results; however, their change trends have an acceptable agreement with each other. The practical significance is supplied by changing the inlet width of the diffuser to expand the scope of use...|$|R

50|$|A <b>submersible</b> <b>pump</b> {{cable is}} a {{specialized}} product {{to be used}} for a <b>submersible</b> <b>pump</b> in a deep well, or in similarly harsh conditions. The cable needed for this type of application must be durable and reliable as the installation location and environment can be extremely restrictive as well as hostile. As such, <b>submersible</b> <b>pump</b> cable can be used in both fresh and salt water. It is also suitable for direct burial and within well castings. A <b>submersible</b> <b>pump</b> cable's area of installation is physically restrictive. Cable manufacturers must keep these factors in mind to achieve the highest possible degree of reliability. The size and shape of <b>submersible</b> <b>pump</b> cable can vary depending on the usage and preference and pumping instrument of the installer. Pump cables are made in single and multiple conductor types and may be flat or round in cross section; some types include control wires as well as power conductors for the pump motor. Conductors are often color-coded for identification and an overall cable jacket may also be color-coded.|$|R
2500|$|The first {{electric}} {{pumping station}} was erected {{at a new}} outfall for the Lawyers and Andersons districts in 1949, {{to be followed by}} several more. The Fleet Haven pumping station cost £21,793 and was completed in 1958/59, and in the same year, Dawsmere pumping station cost £33,868. Lord's Drain pumping station commenced operation in 1962. Sluices were also upgraded, with that on the Holbeach River being commissioned in 1955, and the Lutton Leam outfall sluice following in 1958/59. Despite the improvements, the Fleet Fen area was found to be at risk during flood periods, and a major upgrade, funded by the government, was completed in 1971. It included a new pumping station where the Main Drain and the Fleet River meet, and used <b>submersible</b> <b>pumps</b> {{for the first time in}} a land drainage scheme. Extremely heavy rainfall on 11 July 1968, when over [...] fell on Gedney in the early morning, demonstrated that still more work was required to prevent flooding. Run-off water from Spalding was diverted into the Coronation Channel, a flood-relief bypass for the River Welland, and Clay Lake pumping station was built in 1970, which handles the run-off, but can also be used to pump the adjacent fen when it is not doing so. Five additional pumping stations were built throughout the district. More than half of the area served by the IDB now depends on pumping stations, although most stations still have a gravity outfall, so that power failures or breakdowns are not disastrous. A further six pumping stations have been commissioned since 1974, the latest being brought on-line in July 2003 at Lawyers Sluice, to assist when the 1949-built structure is tidelocked.|$|E

30|$|The <b>submersible</b> <b>pumping</b> unit is a {{new type}} of pumping system for lifting {{formation}} fluids from onshore oil wells, and the identification of its working condition has an important influence on oil production. In this paper we proposed a diagnostic method for identifying the working condition of the <b>submersible</b> <b>pumping</b> system. Based on analyzing the working principle of the pumping unit and the pump structure, different characteristics in loading and unloading processes of the submersible linear motor were obtained at different working conditions. The characteristic quantities were extracted from operation data of the submersible linear motor. A diagnostic model based on the support vector machine (SVM) method was proposed for identifying the working condition of the <b>submersible</b> <b>pumping</b> unit, where the inputs of the SVM classifier were the characteristic quantities. The performance and the misjudgment rate of this method were analyzed and validated by the data acquired from an experimental simulation platform. The model proposed had an excellent performance in failure diagnosis of the <b>submersible</b> <b>pumping</b> system. The SVM classifier had higher diagnostic accuracy than the learning vector quantization (LVQ) classifier.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This project {{presents}} a generalized formulation for the computer-aided analysis of induction motor driving a <b>submersible</b> <b>pump.</b> In general Electric <b>Submersible</b> <b>Pump</b> [ESP] incorporates an induction motor and a pump, having centrifugal action. The pump {{is powered by}} the DC source especially by photovoltaic modules. In this case the insolation level of the sun is not constant at all time, {{it is necessary to}} predict the pump‘s performance. To do so, mathematical modeling and simulation of the electric <b>submersible</b> <b>pump</b> is proposed here. The dynamic model of the induction motor consists of an electrical sub-model to implement the three-phase to two-axis (3 / 2) d-q transformation of stator voltage and current calculation, a torque sub-model to calculate the developed electromagnetic torque, and a mechanical sub-model to yield the rotor speed. The <b>submersible</b> <b>pump</b> is modeled with the inputs as shaft speed, torque and head. The output variable is chosen to be discharge. With all these system modules, the electrical and mechanical condition of the pump under different operating condition is simulated with Matlab/Simulink model...|$|R
