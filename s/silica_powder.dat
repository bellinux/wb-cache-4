50|$|Very recently, {{advances}} in pattern application and deposition at reduced length scales have exploited small-scale synthesis methods including nano-scale chemical surface restructuring and photolithography of computer-generated random specular patterns to produce suitable surface contrast for DIC. The application of very fine powder particles that electrostatically {{adhere to the}} surface of the specimen and can be digitally tracked is one approach. For Al thin films, fine alumina abrasive polishing powder was initially used since the particle sizes are relatively well controlled, although the adhesion to Al films was not very good and the particles tended to agglomerate excessively. The candidate that worked most effectively was a <b>silica</b> <b>powder</b> designed for a high temperature adhesive compound (Aremco, inc.), which was applied through a plastic syringe. A light blanket of powder would coat the gage section of the tensile sample and the larger particles could be blown away gently. The remaining particles would be those with the best adhesion to the surface. While the resulting surface contrast is not ideal for DIC, the high intensity ratio between the particles and the background provide a unique opportunity to track the particles between consecutive digital images taken during deformation. This can be achieved quite straightforwardly using digital image processing techniques. Subpixel tracking can be achieved by a number of correlation techniques, or by fitting to the known intensity profiles of particles. Photolithography and Electron Beam Lithography can be used to create micro tooling for micro speckle stamps, and the stamps can print speckle patterns on{{to the surface of}} the specimen. Stamp inks can be chosen which are appropriate for optical DIC, SEM-DIC, and simultaneous SEM-DIC/EBSD studies (the ink can be transparent to EBSD).|$|E

The diatom cell is protected inside a shell (frustule) constructed from amorphous nano-silica particles. It is {{proposed that the}} frustules and purified silica powders obtained from frustules {{can be used to}} reinforce composites. In this study, microstructural properties of two diatom frustules were determined and different methods were investigated for <b>silica</b> <b>powder</b> processing from diatom frustules. Design/methodology/approach: Natural (ND) and calcined (CD) diatom frustules were used in this study. The chemical and microscopic properties of the diatom frustules were determined using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometry (FTIR) and energy dispersive X-Ray Florescence spectrometer (XRF). Two different processing routes were applied to process <b>silica</b> <b>powder</b> from diatom frustules. These included (i) leaching the frustules directly in HF, (ii) incorporating thermally treated frustules in to the liquid nitrogen. Findings: At increasing HF concentrations, the variety of shapes, nanopores and open voids were seen on the surface of frustules as silica particles were removed from the surface. SEM micrograph results showed that HF significantly etched inside the existing pore structure of the diatom frustules. HF concentration was found more effective in mass loss than the leaching time. Thermal treatment induced several cracks propagated between macro pores and nanopores of the frustules. Practical implications: Results show that thermal and acid treatments were not effective for obtaining <b>silica</b> <b>powder</b> from frustules.
