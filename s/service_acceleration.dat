The poorest carriages were withdrawn almost immediately, and the remaining cars were organised into fixed consists; some of those included airconditioned carriages. Around this time changes to the BE fleet coding were undertaken, to better reflect their internal capacity. Cars converted from BDSE in the 20's became BEL, while cars converted from AE and ABE carriages became BES. Notably, only a handful of these carriages were relettered, although official publications recognised the new codes. However, cars 51BE and 52BE were coded back to 51 and 52AE (not reclaiming their original numbers). It is not known if the cars held the BES code at all, although it is unlikely.|$|E

40|$|The {{personnel}} administration process for functional staff follow bureaucratic procedures that is time consuming and {{often difficult to}} monitor. Further, the process will be prolonged if the process is handled manually. These conditions are often limit staff managers at unit level, technical implementation unit (UPT), or functional staff who need the information timely in a precise and accurate format. Manual handling cannot support the information speed, because staffs have to manually track file(s) or documents {{in the chain of}} bureaucracy that is complex and tedious. Delays in the process of obtaining such information could lead to adverse consequences in financial terms if for instance the termination in functional status and monthly salary occurred. One solution to this problem is to develop an online personnel information system (SIMPEG) to accelerate personnel information services. The Design of the online SIMPEG development utilized the method of open group architecture framework (TOGAF) while the system development implemented prototype method.

30|$|Recent {{and rapid}} {{progress}} in {{information and communication}} technology has exceeded our expectations for meeting the requirements of multimedia society in the twenty-first century. Free-space optical communication (FSOC) {{is considered to be}} one of the key technologies for realizing very high speed multigigabit per second (multi-Gb/s) large-capacity terrestrial and aerospace communications [1, 2]. The FSOC system provides a line of sight (LoS), wireless and high-bandwidth communication between remote sites. The FSOC system offers many transmission advantages including freedom from electromagnetic interference (EMI) and license or tariffs, flexibility, ease in installment, no need to dig up roads, last-mile access, <b>service</b> <b>acceleration,</b> metro network extensions, enterprise connectivity, fiber backup, backhaul, and high security [3, 4]. In addition, a photonics-based approach is expected to bring such ultra-high data rate wireless technologies to potential users and to meet and explore real-world applications at the earliest opportunity as a technology driver [5]. However, the propagating optical wave is influenced in the FSOC channel by random atmospheric changes (wind speed, temperature, relative humidity, and pressure) [6], thermal expansion, weak earthquakes, and typical high-rise building sways which result in decreasing the average received power, increasing the bit error rate (BER), and severely degrading the communication link quality/reliability [7 – 9]. These are all the general problems that require attenuation to be dealt with. The major effects due to the random fluctuations of the atmospheric turbulence are (i) optical scattering and observation (characterized by atmospheric attenuation); (ii) random optical power fluctuation (characterized by scintillation index); (iii) beam wandering, i.e., beam surface global (temporal) tilt due to beam centroid displacement on the detector plane (characterized by effective scintillation index); and (iv) wavefront distortions, i.e., beam surface (spatial) local tilt (characterized by the Zernike polynomials) [10 – 12]. The conventional data coding and/or modulation techniques can be used to equalize/compromise the first two effects with respect to weather conditions at a given instant of time [13, 14]. The third and fourth effects cannot be compromised without incorporating the adaptive optics elements [15, 16]. During data transmission, the angle between the transmitter-receiver LoS and the transmitting beam axis must be kept within a fraction of the transmitting beamwidth which may be as small as a few microradians. The increase in the transmitting beam divergence angle/diameter is one way to maintain the link between the transmitter and receiver. It is clear that an overly wider beam will increase the required laser power, which increases the terminal cost and complexity. On the other hand, an overly narrow beam may result in a cutoff of the communication when there is building sway and/or beam wandering [2, 3, 7, 8]. The existence of a perfect LoS and continuous beam alignment between the communicating optical antennas is one of the key requirements for a successful installation of an FSOC system. To ensure an uninterrupted data flow, auto-alignment transmitter and receiver modules are necessary [12, 17, 18]. The data loss due to weak scintillation effects can be recovered using various data coding techniques developed for wire- and fiber-based communication systems [13, 14]. In contest, beam wandering and deep signal fading (wavefront distortions) represent unique and significantly more challenging problems, which cannot be resolved using conventional data coding techniques, and a major incentive for the incorporation of adaptive optics technology (beam wandering mitigation and wavefront corrections) into the FSOC architecture is an active prevention of long-term data loss [12, 15, 16]. The first and most important requirement for the successful installation of FSOC is beam steering (reduction of focal spot wander) that mitigates the beam wandering (temporal distortions) [1, 16 – 18] which is the research component and main contribution in this work.|$|E

Much of the credit for the increased attention is due to the work of the GAVI Alliance and to new funding streams. If routine immunization programs are to take full advantage of the newly available resources, managers need to understand the range of proven strategies and approaches to deliver vaccines to reduce the incidence of diseases. In this paper, we present strategies that may be used at the sub-national level to improve routine immunization programs. Methods We conducted a systematic review of studies and projects reported in the published and gray literature. Each paper that met our inclusion criteria was rated based on methodological rigor and data were systematically abstracted. Routine-immunization – specific papers with a methodological rigor rating of greater than 60 % and with conclusive results were reported. Results Greater than 11, 000 papers were identified, of which 60 met our inclusion criteria and 25 papers were reported. Papers were grouped into four strategy approaches: bringing immunizations closer to communities (n = 11), using information dissemination to increase demand for vaccination (n = 3), changing practices in fixed sites (n = 4), and using innovative management practices (n = 7). Conclusion Immunization programs are at a historical crossroads in terms of developing new funding streams, introducing new vaccines, and responding to the global interest in the health systems approach to improving immunization delivery. However, to complement this, actual service delivery needs to be strengthened and program managers must be aware of proven strategies. Much was learned from the 25 papers, such as the use of non-health workers to provide numerous services at the community level. However it was startling to see how few papers were identified and in particular how few were of strong scientific quality. Further well-designed and well-conducted scientific research is warranted. Proposed areas of additional research include integration of additional services with immunization delivery, collaboration of immunization programs with new partners, best approaches to new vaccine introduction, and how to improve service delivery. </p...|$|R

Analysis of heavy vehicle drivers&# 039; lane-changing execution reveals that drivers maintained an almost constant speed during the maneuver; this suggests that they did not accelerate or decelerate to adjust their speeds according to the speed of surrounding traffic in the target lane. However, passenger car drivers do accelerate to adjust their speeds according to the speeds of the lead and lag vehicles in the target lane.

The use of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) could contribute to a more effective use of resources in toll road networks. Management of toll plazas {{is central to the}} reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, as it is there that bottlenecks and congestion occur. This study focuses on management strategies aimed at reducing climate change impacts of toll plazas by managing toll collection systems. These strategies are based on the use of different collection system technologies – Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) and Open Road Tolling (ORT) – and on queue management. The carbon footprint of various toll plazas is determined by a proposed integrated methodology which estimates the carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions of the different operational stages at toll plazas (deceleration, <b>service</b> time, <b>acceleration,</b> and queuing) for the different toll collection systems. To validate the methodology, two main-line toll plazas of a Spanish toll highway were evaluated. The findings reveal that the application of new technologies to toll collection systems is an effective management strategy from an environmental point of view. The case studies revealed that ORT systems lead to savings of up to 70 % of CO 2 emissions at toll plazas, while ETC systems save 20 % comparing to the manual ones. Furthermore, queue management can offer a 16 % emissions savings when queue time is reduced by 116 seconds. The integrated methodology provides an efficient environmental management tool for toll plazas. The use of new technologies is the future of the decarbonization of toll plazas...|$|R

40|$|In bridge maintenance, {{particularly}} with regard to fatigue damage in steel bridges, it is important to determine the displacement response of the entire bridge under a live load {{as well as that of}} each member. Knowing the displacement response enables the identification of dynamic deformations that can cause stresses and ultimately lead to damage and thus also allows the undertaking of appropriate countermeasures. In theory, the displacement response can be calculated from the double integration of the measured acceleration. However, data measured by an accelerometer include measurement errors caused by the limitations of the analog-to-digital conversion process and sensor noise. These errors distort the double integration results. Furthermore, as bridges in service are constantly vibrating because of passing vehicles, estimating the boundary conditions for the numerical integration is difficult. To address these problems, this paper proposes a method for determining the displacement of a bridge in <b>service</b> from its <b>acceleration</b> based on its free vibration.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{benefits}} of good health {{to individuals and}} to society are strongly positive, and improving {{the health of the}} poor is a key millennium development goal (MDG). A typical health strategy advocated by some calls for increased public spending on health targeted to favor the poor backed by foreign assistance, combined with an international effort to perfect drugs and vaccines to ameliorate the major infectious diseases prevalent in developing nations. However, if the objective is better health outcomes at the least cost and a reduction in urban health inequity, our research suggests that the four most potent policy interventions are: improving access to clean water and sanitation; widely available primary care and health programs aimed at influencing diets and lifestyles; raising the level of education; and better urban land use and transport planning which contains urban sprawl and minimizes the trend towards sedentary living habits. The payoff from these four, in terms of health outcomes especially for those in low-income categories, dwarfs the returns from new drugs and curative hospital-based medicine, although these certainly have their place in a modern urban health system. We find, moreover, that the resource requirements for successful health care policies are likely to depend on an acceleration of economic growth rates, which increase household purchasing power and enlarge the pool of resources available to national and subnational governments to invest in and maintain healthrelated infrastructure and <b>services.</b> Thus, an <b>acceleration</b> of growth rates may be necessary to sustain a viable urban health strategy, which is equitable, and to ensure steady gains in health outcomes...|$|R

The goal of this thesis is to discover the elements of Akamai's legacy and emerging growth strategies and to identify strategic options that Akamai may pursue. To gain perspective into evolution of the business and the rationale for current strategic initiatives, a series of interviews with Akamai managers was conducted and a review of an Akamai case study and corporate quarterly earnings was completed. This information yielded insights on the challenges of growth, actions for overcoming these challenges, and motivations for selecting those actions. To gain insight into best practices in growth strategy, a survey of the business strategy literature and case studies of successful technology platform companies was conducted. The literature differentiated between product-based business strategies and platform-based business strategies.

Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) Weatherization and Intergovernmental Program, have investigated the possible application of Energy Star ratings to passenger cars and light trucks. This study establishes a framework for formulating and evaluating Energy Star rating methods that is comprised of energy- and environmental-based metrics, potential vehicle classification systems, vehicle technology factors, and vehicle selection criteria. The study tests several concepts and Energy Star rating methods using model-year 2000 vehicle data [...] a spreadsheet model has been developed to facilitate these analyses. This study tests two primary types of rating systems: (1) an outcome-based system that rates vehicles based on fuel economy, GHG emissions, and oil use and (2) a technology-based system that rates vehicles based on the energy-saving technologies they use. Rating methods were evaluated based {{on their ability to}} select vehicles with high fuel economy, low GHG emissions, and low oil use while preserving a full range of <b>service</b> (size and <b>acceleration)</b> and body style choice. This study concludes that an Energy Star rating for passenger cars and light trucks is feasible and that several methods could be used to achieve reasonable tradeoffs between low energy use and emissions and diversity in size, performance, and body type. It also shows that methods that consider only fuel economy, GHG emissions, or oil use will not select a diverse mix of vehicles. Finally, analyses suggest that methods that encourage the use of technology only, may result in increases in acceleration power and weight rather than reductions in oil use and GHG emissions and improvements in fuel economy...|$|R

Thanks to these accelerations, the interaction between the designer and the platform is improved, and in most cases the design is reduced to simple confirmations of the “proposals” that the platform dynamically provides at each step. In addition, the platform provides several other accelerations such as configurable templates {{that can be used to}} define the different tasks in the service or the dialogs to obtain or show information to the user, automatic proposals for the best way to request slot contents from the user (i. e. using mixed-initiative forms or directed forms), an assistant that offers the set of more probable actions required to complete the definition of the different tasks in the application, or another assistant for solving specific modality details such as confirmations of user answers or how to present them the lists of retrieved results after querying the backend database. Additionally, the platform also allows the creation of speech grammars and prompts, database access functions, and the possibility of using mixed initiative and over-answering dialogs. In the paper we also describe in detail each assistant in the platform, emphasizing the different kind of methodologies followed to facilitate the design process at each one. Finally, {{we describe}} the results obtained in both a subjective and an objective evaluation with different designers that confirm the viability, usefulness, and functionality of the proposed accelerations. Thanks to the accelerations, the design time is reduced in more than 56...|$|R
40|$|Today the {{telecommunication}} {{market is}} faced with the situation that customers are requesting for new telecommunication services, especially value added services. The concept of Next Generation Networks (NGN) {{seems to be a}} solution for this, so this concept finds its way into the telecommunication area. These customer expectations have emerged in the context of NGN and the associated migration of the telecommunication networks from traditional circuit-switched towards packet-switched networks. One fundamental aspect of the NGN concept is to outsource the intelligence of services from the switching plane onto separated Service Delivery Platforms using SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) to provide the required signalling functionality. Caused by this migration process towards NGN SIP has appeared as the major signalling protocol for IP (Internet Protocol) based NGN. This will lead in contrast to ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) and IN (Intelligent Network) to significantly lower dependences among the network and services and enables to implement new services much easier and faster. In addition, further concepts from the IT (Information Technology) namely SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture) have largely influenced the telecommunication sector forced by amalgamation of IT and telecommunications. The benefit of applying SOA in telecommunication <b>services</b> is the <b>acceleration</b> of <b>service</b> creation and delivery. Main features of the SOA are that services are reusable, discoverable combinable and independently accessible from any location. Integration of those features offers a broader flexibility and efficiency for varying demands on services. This thesis proposes a novel framework for service provisioning and composition in SIP-based peer-to-peer networks applying the principles of SOA. One key contribution of the framework is the approach to enable the provisioning and composition of services which is performed by applying SIP. Based on this, the framework provides a flexible and fast way to request the creation for composite services. Furthermore the framework enables to request and combine multimodal value-added services, which means that they are no longer limited regarding media types such as audio, video and text. The proposed framework has been validated by a prototype implementation...|$|R
40|$|Village {{extension}} {{has been}} pursuant to Article 2 of 2005 No. 73 Government Regulation and 2000 No. 129 Government Regulation. Both mention about village establishment including the compilation of several villages or the nearby parts of village, or the extension from one village into {{two or more}} villages. The formation, extension, elimination and compilation should be aimed at improving public welfare because these consider the improvement to public <b>service,</b> the <b>acceleration</b> of local economic development implementation, the acceleration of area management, the improvement of security and orderliness, and the improvement of compatible relationship between central and local. This phenomenon produces the author’s interest to reveal this condit ion in research titled with Rural Area Extension Process based on 2003 No. 4 Local Regulation of Banjarbaru City. Research aims to examine the process of extension {{and its impact on}} Guntung Payung Village (host village) and Guntung Manggis (village as extension result) after extension, related to this public service. Research locates at Guntung Payung and Guntung Manggis Villages. Research sample includes 3 persons, Sub-Division Head of Banjarbaru City Development and Agrarian, Chief of Guntung Payung Village and Chief of Guntung Manggis Village. Data collection method involves primary and secondary data. Data analysis technique concerns with qualitative measure. Results of research indicate that Guntung Payung Village extends into Guntung Payung Village and Guntung Manggis Village pursuant to 2000 No. 129 Local Regulation in considering administrative fundamental and technical requirement of an extension. Socialization takes 2 or 3 months before the extension and involves all public components in addition to public representation, leader of neighborhood association, and religious figure of Guntung Payung. Socialization involves a meeting to invite all related representative figures of Guntung Payung. The realization of new area extension seems ended in 2004 and it relates to technical and administrative requirements. The idealist of area extension for Guntung Payung Village will be the government of Banjarbaru City, executive or legislative in Sub-Division of Area Development and Agrarian, Chief of Guntung Manggis Village, Chief of Guntung Payung Village, public figure and religious figure. The implementation of area extension complies with 2004 No. 32 Act, and Banjarbaru’s Article 3 of 2003 No. 4 Local Regulation. Name establishment involves some public figures instead of the community. The selection and establishment for Guntung Manggis name consider the history and the location in south of Jalan Ahmad Yani, previously recognized as Guntung Manggis. The impact on Guntung Payung Village ensures the facilitation for administration in which public service seems optimized because the community don’t have to wait too long in the bureaucracy of local government and don’t have to go distant. Administration process gets faster to complete. Public access to government’s public service gets closer and indeed, benefits the community. Government’s public management of development becomes more effective because of the narrower management scope and more optimized governmental program plan to realize. The negative impact emphasizes on the old village in which the employment volume decreases. The yet updated data on extension, ID Card, Post Code, etc, just make it worse...|$|R
