30|$|The first {{types of}} {{optimization}} {{performed in the}} past considered the maximization of the first law efficiency according to the Carnot equilibrium thermodynamics for the appraisal of an energy system. During {{the second part of}} the last century, maximization of the mechanical power of engines was considered. This appraisal was initiated by Chambadal [1, 2, 3] and Novikov [4] and renewed by Curzon and Alhborn [5]. These papers mark the beginning of the finite time thermodynamics, FTT. Today, the simultaneous consideration of energy, environment and economy concern implies a multicriterion analysis. Multicriterion optimization of thermal systems design considering simultaneously energy, economy and environment as objectives is developed [6]. These studies are developed for engines and plants, as well as for refrigeration systems [7] and for combined cooling, heating and power systems [8], even more at a national level [9]. New heuristic optimization methods (evolutionary algorithms) are also applied, for example to heat pump [10] or <b>solar</b> <b>heat</b> <b>engine</b> [11]. These algorithms appear strongly connected to the second law. A criterion combining the minimization of the entropy production and the maximization of the mechanical power output is proposed by Angulo-Brown [12] and completed by Yan [13]. It is valuable for the global system. The utilization of this kind of criteria is a means to obtain a compromise between power, cost and pollution objectives. In this paper, a new mixed objective is proposed, taking account of four aspects, which are power, cost, heat rejection and entropy production.|$|E
