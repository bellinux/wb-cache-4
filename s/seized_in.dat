In response, Thomas Jefferson sent a squadron of frigates to protect American merchant ships in the Mediterranean and pursue peace with the Barbary States.|$|E

5|$|Launceston Castle {{played a}} role in Cornish {{politics}} {{during the middle of the}} 16th century. In 1548, Sir William Body, a royal commissioner sent by Edward IV to destroy the Catholic shrines at Helston, was killed by two local Cornish men. In retaliation, 28 local men were arrested and executed at the castle. Anger grew, and in 1549 a wider uprising called the Prayer Book Rebellion took place. It was headed by Sir Humphrey Arundell, who marched up through the county and took Launcester Castle that summer, probably without a struggle. The castle was then used to imprison the royalist leader, Sir Richard Grenville, who died during his detention there. John Russell, the Earl of Bedford, subsequently defeated the rebels and retook Launceston, capturing Arundel who was <b>seized</b> <b>in</b> the street fighting.|$|E

Emden left Kiel on 12 April 1910, bound for Asia by way of a goodwill tour of South America.

5|$|Since the War of the Third Coalition, the French had {{maintained}} client kingdoms in Italy and Naples that controlled the western {{shores of the}} Adriatic. Over the next four years, strategically important islands and territories had been <b>seized</b> <b>in</b> the treaties of Tilsit and Schönbrunn, giving Napoleon direct command of the eastern shore. With these treaties, France had seized not only several important fortress islands, most notably Corfu, but also many important shipyards and harbours. Maintaining control of the Adriatic was however even harder than seizing it had been, the threat of attack by Austrian, Russian or Ottoman armies and the mountainous terrain of the Balkans forcing the development of garrisons that could be effectively resupplied only by sea.|$|E
