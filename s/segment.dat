40|$|Abstract Background An {{important}} subfamily of membrane proteins are the transmembrane α-helical proteins, {{in which}} the membrane-spanning regions {{are made up of}} α-helices. Given the obvious biological and medical significance of these proteins, it is of tremendous practical importance to identify the location of transmembrane <b>segments.</b> The difficulty of inferring the secondary or tertiary structure of transmembrane proteins using experimental techniques has led to a surge of interest in applying techniques from machine learning and bioinformatics to infer secondary structure from primary structure in these proteins. We are therefore interested in determining which physicochemical properties are most useful for discriminating transmembrane <b>segments</b> from non-transmembrane <b>segments</b> in transmembrane proteins, and for discriminating intrinsically unstructured <b>segments</b> from intrinsically structured <b>segments</b> in transmembrane proteins, and in using the results of these investigations to develop classifiers to identify transmembrane <b>segments</b> in transmembrane proteins. Results We determined that the most useful properties for discriminating transmembrane <b>segments</b> from non-transmembrane <b>segments</b> and for discriminating intrinsically unstructured <b>segments</b> from intrinsically structured <b>segments</b> in transmembrane proteins were hydropathy, polarity, and flexibility, and used the results of this analysis to construct classifiers to discriminate transmembrane <b>segments</b> from non-transmembrane <b>segments</b> using four classification techniques: two variants of the Self-Organizing Global Ranking algorithm, a decision tree algorithm, and a support vector machine algorithm. All four techniques exhibited good performance, with out-of-sample accuracies of approximately 75 %. Conclusions Several interesting observations emerged from our study: intrinsically unstructured <b>segments</b> and transmembrane <b>segments</b> tend to have opposite properties; transmembrane proteins appear to be much richer in intrinsically unstructured <b>segments</b> than other proteins; and, in approximately 70 % of transmembrane proteins that contain intrinsically unstructured <b>segments,</b> the intrinsically unstructured <b>segments</b> are close to transmembrane <b>segments.</b> </p...|$|R
