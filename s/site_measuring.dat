500|$|... {{religious}} {{monument in}} the world, on a <b>site</b> <b>measuring</b> [...] It was originally constructed as a Hindu temple of god Vishnu for the Khmer Empire, gradually transforming into a Buddhist temple {{towards the end}} of the 12th century. It was built by the Khmer King Suryavarman II in the early 12th century in Yaśodharapura ( [...] , present-day Angkor), the capital of the Khmer Empire, as his state temple and eventual mausoleum. Breaking from the Shaiva tradition of previous kings, Angkor Wat was instead dedicated to Vishnu. As the best-preserved temple at the site, it is the only one to have remained a significant religious centre since its foundation. The temple is at the top of the high classical style of Khmer architecture. It has become a symbol of Cambodia, appearing on its national flag, and it is the country's prime attraction for visitors.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Before {{and after}} pouring the {{concrete}} for a dam, how to predict and obtain the accurate temperature and {{stress of the}} {{various parts of the}} dam, is the key to prevent cracks in concrete. The stresses calculated from the parameters of the laboratory under the ideal conditions have obvious difference with the value calculated from <b>site</b> <b>measured</b> strain. As for such problem, based on the measured temperature and strain data of rolled compact concrete gravity dam engineering, the thermal and mechanics parameters of the concrete materials are inversed. The dam stress of construction period is simulated and analyzed separately based on the site parameters and lab parameters. The results show that although the stress development law from different ways is near, their values are different obviously because of three aspects. The <b>site</b> <b>measured</b> values should be more real. So it is necessary to inverse the thermal and mechanics parameters according to the <b>site</b> <b>measured</b> data...|$|R
