The {{objective of this}} study was to obtain qualitative and quantitative information on population fluctuation of the Lepidopteran defoliators of Eucalyptus urophylla plants in the Brazilian Amazon rainforest. In all, 402 species were collected, of which 10 were primary <b>pests,</b> nine were <b>secondary</b> <b>pests,</b> and the remaining bore no definite relevance to eucalyptus. Primary pests formed a low percentage of the total species, although they recorded a high percentage of the total number of individuals. The abundance of <b>secondary</b> <b>pests,</b> except in Caracuru, was less than 150 specimens annually. Primary pests showed higher population peaks during periods of low precipitation. The small number of species and the high abundance of primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>pests</b> could be due to the availability of food, or a deficiency in natural biological control. This suggests the possibilities of population outbreaks in the eucalyptus plantations. The period of highest occurrence for insect species in these crops must be identified so that suitable strategies can be developed for Integrated Pest Management...|$|R
5000|$|Several studies {{documented}} surges in <b>secondary</b> <b>pests</b> {{within a}} few years of adoption of Bt cotton. In China, the main problem has been with mirids, which have in some cases [...] "completely eroded all benefits from Bt cotton cultivation". A 2009 study in China concluded that the increase in <b>secondary</b> <b>pests</b> depended on local temperature and rainfall conditions and occurred in half the villages studied. The increase in insecticide use for the control of these secondary insects was far smaller than the reduction in total insecticide use due to Bt cotton adoption. A 2011 study based on a survey of 1,000 randomly selected farm households in five provinces in China found that the reduction in pesticide use in Bt cotton cultivars was significantly lower than that reported in research elsewhere: The finding was consistent with a hypothesis that more pesticide sprayings are needed over time to control emerging <b>secondary</b> <b>pests,</b> such as aphids, spider mites, and lygus bugs.

An estimated third of the 300 most damaging insects in the US were originally secondary pests and only became a major problem after the use of pesticides. In both pest resurgence and secondary outbreaks, their natural enemies were more susceptible to the pesticides than the pests themselves, in some cases causing the pest population to be higher than it was before the use of pesticide.|$|E

40|$|Cotton {{has lost}} many ancestral {{defensive}} traits against key invertebrate pests. This {{is suggested by}} the levels of resistance to some pests found in wild cotton genotypes as well as in cultivated landraces and is a result of domestication and a long history of targeted breeding for yield and fibre quality, along with the capacity to control pests with pesticides. Genetic modification (GM) allowed integration of toxins from a bacteria into cotton to control key Lepidopteran pests. Since the mid- 1990 ’s, use of GM cotton cultivars has greatly reduced the amount of pesticides used in many cotton systems. However, pests not controlled by the GM traits have usually emerged as problems, especially the sucking bug complex. Control of this complex with pesticides often causes a reduction in beneficial invertebrate populations, allowing other <b>secondary</b> <b>pests</b> to increase rapidly and require control. Control of both sucking bug complex and <b>secondary</b> <b>pests</b> is problematic due to the cost of pesticides and/or high risk of selecting for pesticide resistance. Deployment of host plant resistance provides an opportunity to manage these issues in GM cotton systems. Cotton cultivars resistant to the sucking bug complex and/or <b>secondary</b> <b>pests</b> would require fewer pesticide applications, reducing costs and risks to beneficial invertebrate populations and pesticide resistance. Incorporation of host plant resistance traits into elite cotton cultivars with high yield and fibre quality offers the potential to further reduce pesticide use and increase the durability of pest management in GM cotton systems. We review the challenges that the identification and use of host plant resistance against invertebrate pests brings to cotton breeding. We explore sources of resistance to the sucking bug complex and <b>secondary</b> <b>pests,</b> the mechanisms that control them and the approaches to incorporate these defence traits to commercial cultivars...|$|R
50|$|The wharf borer’s name is of {{importance}} to fisherman, sailors, and quarrymen who work along coastal areas. Damage done to old ships and docks by the wharf borer is a good indication of how old the vessels are as the beetle’s only attack old timber. The presence of wharf borers and the simultaneous destruction can be accepted as a safety precaution to repair docks and ships to avoid dangerous accidents. It {{is known as a}} <b>secondary</b> <b>pest,</b> because the larva mainly feed on damp and decaying wood found along waterways and coastlines. The network of tunnels form when wharf borer larvae burrow and ingest the rotten wood, weakening the mechanical support given by the wood. This leads to increased damages in plumbing and rotting timbers. Oak, poplar, and pine are some of the timbers attacked by the wharf borer, indicating its development in both soft and hard woods. It is best to correct the wood moisture problems and remove the source of infected decaying wood. The beetles, generally only a nuisance between June to August, can be controlled by the application of a residual insecticide (such as permethrin). This {{can be applied to the}} wall and floor junctions of dwellings and offices.These adults can also be simply vacuumed or picked up and discarded. The larvae is found to be a pest of telegraph poles and fences where dogs have urinated. In Toronto, a large number of adults were discovered in a newspaper office, especially attracted to toilets. In America, Drooz (1953) reported that the insect was responsible for very costly damage to foundations underneath buildings in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.To protect stored archaeological timbers from the damaging effects of wharf borers, a procedure has been developed to control the attacks. The first measure calls for checking the particular area for infestation by the insects. Next, the extent of infestation in the stored timbers is determined. Once the degree of damage has been recorded, the timbers need to be isolated and quarantined. The storage area and the infected timbers are subjected to an appropriate treatment system which is compatible with future conservation treatment systems.|$|E

40|$|The {{boll weevil}} (Anthonomus grandis grandis Boheman) is {{currently}} under eradication in the U. S. The eradication program is implemented {{by means of}} area-wide applications of malathion ULV. Frequent applications of this insecticide result in high mortality of many beneficial insects, and {{a greater risk of}} <b>secondary</b> <b>pest</b> outbreaks. Notable among the latter are the outbreaks of beet armyworm (Spodoptera exigua H?bner) and cotton aphid (Aphis gossypii Glover) in the Lower Rio Grande Valley in 1995. The present study (i) compared densities of beneficial and pest insect and spider populations between cotton fields in eradication and non-eradication areas; (ii) evaluated the use of beneficial cotton arthropod population densities as indicators of pest damage risks from cotton aphid, beet armyworm, bollworm (Helicoverpa zea Boddie), and other worms (Estigmene acrea Drury, Pseudoplusia includens Walker, and Trichoplusia ni H?bner); and (iii) evaluated the effects of malathion ULV on the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta Buren) a key arthropod predator in cotton agroecosystems. Studies were conducted in central Texas, in the vicinities of College Station and Dallas, during 2002 and 2003. Results showed that a majority of cotton predators were negatively impacted by malathion ULV applications. However, convergent lady beetle (Hippodamia convergens Gu?rin-M?neville) densities were greater in active eradication fields than inactive fields. Stepwise regression analyses identified densities of lacewing (Chrysoperla carnea Stephens) larvae and lady beetle larvae (H. convergens, Coleomegilla maculata De Geer, Harmonia axyridis Pallas, and Coccinella septempunctata L.) as predictors of cotton aphid density, and density of total spiders as predictors of bollworm density. Predictors of beet armyworm or other worm densities could not be determined. This study demonstrated malathion ULV was highly toxic to fire ants, and could repel ants from treated surfaces. Malathion ULV reduced the number of foraging fire ants in the cotton canopy for three weeks and reduced fire ant predation of beet armyworm eggs. Predictors of <b>secondary</b> <b>pest</b> densities have been suggested which, if utilized, may help to prevent the occurrence of <b>secondary</b> <b>pest</b> outbreaks under boll weevil eradication.

40|$|The {{intensification}} {{of agriculture and}} the development of synthetic insecticides enabled worldwide grain production to more than double in the last third of the 20 th century. However, the heavy dependence and, in some cases, overuse of insecticides has been responsible for negative environmental and ecological impacts across the globe, such as a reduction in biodiversity, insect resistance to pesticides, negative effects on nontarget species (e. g. natural enemies) {{and the development of}} secondary pests. The use of recombinant DNA technology to develop genetically engineered (GE) insect resistant crops could mitigate many of the negative side effects of pesticides. One such genetic alteration enables crops to express toxic crystalline (Cry) proteins from the soil bacteria Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). Despite the widespread adoption of Bt crops, there are still a range of unanswered questions concerning longer term agro-ecosystem interactions. For instance, insect species that are not susceptible to the expressed toxin can develop into secondary pests and cause significant damage to the crop. Here we review the main causes surrounding <b>secondary</b> <b>pest</b> dynamics in Bt crops and the impact of such outbreaks. Regardless of the causes, if non-susceptible <b>secondary</b> <b>pest</b> populations exceed economic thresholds, insecticide spraying could become the immediate solution at farmers’ disposal, and the sustainable use of this genetic modification technology may be in jeopardy.
