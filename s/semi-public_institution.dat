40|$|Avec les développements de la législation, le syndicalisme a perdu son caractère d'institution strictement privée et volontaire. Il a acquis un caractère semi-public. Dans quelle mesure la confessionnalité syndicale peut-elle être {{compatible}} avec un tel régime juridique? Les tribunaux n'ont pas encore eu à se prononcer sur ce point. L'auteur analyse ici les différentes mesures législatives et les pratiques syndicales qui peuvent affecter la confessionnalité; il donne également une opinion doctrinale sur cette question. With {{the development}} of labour legislation, unionism has lost its character of a purely private and voluntary organization. It now has {{the status of a}} <b>semi-public</b> <b>institution.</b> Confessional unionism, under these conditions, can no longer stand the test of legality, even if the courts have never been called to rule on this question. Among the laws which we have to consider here, the Labour Relations Act is the most important. This act gives to one union only the right to bargain for and on behalf of all workers in a bargaining unit. If one wants to become an efficient member of a union, he has to join the local which represents him and his fellow workers in the plant where he is employed. Moreover, compulsory membership is commonly observed in collective labour agreements as a condition of employment. The natural right of association is thus limited in fact to those who may, without making it a point of conscience, freely accept the constitution and by-laws of a union. Local unions which require a worker to be a Catholic as a condition of membership are very seldom, but the sole fact that the Canadian and Catholic Confederation of Labour has a reference in its constitution to the social doctrine of the Catholic Church may bring a worker to scruple to belong to an affiliated local of this central body. The question of what may be a matter of conscience in this case is related {{to the fact that the}} interpretation of the doctrine is considered by non-catholics as vested with an outside organization, i. e. the Church. If the constitution of the union merely referred to the Christian social principles as the basic guide of its action, it would be a quite different thing, because this would involve no outside opinion and would be acceptable to anyone in a Christian country such as Canada...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the use of}} free trade agreements (FTAs) by Japanese firms. The analysis utilizes information collected {{by way of a}} questionnaire survey. The analysis finds that the use of FTAs by Japanese firms is very limited. Many Japanese firms do not take advantage of free trade via FTAs as they think that benefits are small because their trade volume with FTA partner countries is small and because the tariff differentials between most favored nation (MFN) rates and FTA rates are rather small for many products. Probit analysis of the determinants of the use of FTAs reveals that large rather than small firms do use FTAs, reflecting the high cost of such practice. In addition, firms with close trade and FDI relationships with FTA partner countries are found to use FTAs. Our findings indicate the need to reduce costs of using FTAs in order to expand their use by simplifying application procedures and by providing assistance through public and <b>semi-public</b> <b>institutions</b> such as the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Economy (METI); the Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO); and the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The paper also argues that the Japanese government should establish FTAs with Japan’s large trading partners, including the Unite...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the main}} issues facing almost all European {{regional}} policy-makers is how to ensure a smooth adaptation of their industrial structure {{in the face of}} changing societal and technological parameters. In the case of the Belgian region Wallonia, industrial decline has particularly marked the economy during recent decades and the need to promote structural change has been a central preoccupation of national and, subsequently, regional governments. At the same time, the highly complex system of governance in Belgium renders the definition and application of a coherent regional industrial Policy difficult. This paper explores the development of industrial policy in the Walloon region with particular attention to the period since 1990 and the pertinence of the instruments and delivery mechanisms with respect to the underlying structural issues facing the regional economy. The paper is divided into four sections: the first offers a historical profile of the industrial development of the Walloon economy and in particular identifies some of the factors which provoked a serious structural crisis. The section reviews the economic impact of the successive Phases of rationalization and diversification which have taken place since the 1970 s and discusses how the industrial strategies adopted by the business sector and supported by the regional government have influenced the speed of economic regeneration. The second section considers the complex federal system of government in Belgium and how it influences the freedom of action for regional industrial policy. The governance of the economy by the numerous public or <b>semi-public</b> <b>institutions</b> active in the field of industrial policy is a crucial issue. A critical review {{of the main}} initiatives, instruments and targets of industrial policy in Wallonia is offered in section three, while the paper concludes by contrasting the Walloon industrial policy with initiatives taken in the neighbouring area of South-West Flanders and panders the issue of whether in the end the key factor arresting the development of Wallonia is the insufficient level of 'social capital'(2) ...|$|R
50|$|Construction {{plans for}} the Buckingham Building began in 1929. The {{building}} replaced an 1886 structure called the Athenaeum Building, a <b>semi-public</b> educational <b>institution.</b> As a result, the new building was called the New Athenaeum during its initial planning, though by 1929 it {{was known as the}} Buckingham Building. The building's office space opened to tenants in May 1930; its leasing agents promoted the space using both its proximity to Michigan Avenue and multiple modes of transportation and its views of Lake Michigan and Grant Park. Significant early tenants of the building included the Vacuum Oil Company, the American Railroad Association, and the National Hardwood Lumber Association. The first floor of the building was used as retail space, housing shops and restaurants. The Vacuum Oil Company merged with the Standard Oil Company of New York in 1931 to become the Socony-Vacuum Company, and the consolidated firm rented increasingly more space in the building. By 1940, the firm renamed the building the Socony-Vacuum Building upon signing a ten-year lease to its office space. The building later became known by its street address. It still includes both retail and office space, though it is now only partially occupied.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{publications}} in the cluster-related literature {{have shown that}} interfirm links imply the potential to foster higher forms of learning within clusters. Especially networks deserve in this context a particular focus of attention. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to show essential conditions that should be present at cluster level in order to enable such forms of learning between the firms. This will be done in order to give a first advice for public and <b>semi-public</b> cluster <b>institutions</b> to facilitate interfirm collaborations and cluster related activities. Two case-studies of SME-networks selected from Styrian clusters will give the opportunity to get deeper insights into the conditions that enable clusters to bring forth double loop learning activities. In a first step particular criteria for the presence of double-loop learning will be established. In a second step the conditions for this specific type of learning will be dealt with. Among the categories of conditions that will be examined in detail are the relations and interactions in the network, the types of joint projects carried out between the firms and the specific organizational culture that prevails at the individual firm level. Key words: SME-networks, learning, organizational culture. ...|$|R
40|$|The Government of Jordan {{requested}} {{assistance in}} planning and projec t analysis in April 1987 to help improve the country's agricultural planning capacity by us ing the Data Analysis and Simulation Programme (DASI) and the Computerized System for Agricul tural and Population Planning Assistance (CAPPA). The project provided the services o f three external consultants, four local consultants, and purchased a microcomputer with the associated printer, accessories, and softwareA National Workshop on Agricultural Policy Analysis {{was held at the}} Faculty of Agriculture of the University of Jordan in Amman, between 5 and 17 March 1988, at which the use of FAO's DASI software for financial and economic analysis was pre sented. Twenty participants from various ministries attended. Between 25 June and 7 Jul y 1988, a National Workshop on Agricultural Planning and Sector Analysis was held in the s ame venue. It included an introduction to the use of CAPPA, with practical computer demonst rations. As a result, CAPPA is now recognized as a potentially useful tool for agricultur al planning in Jordan, and the project provided the assistance of two international consulta nts to begin the application of the software in the preparation of the 1990 - 1994 Five-Year Develo pment PlanThe project also conducted an assessment of Jordan's trained manpowe r needs for agricultural planning and project analysis. This showed that, although over a third of professional employees working in agricultural planning and project analysis in the main public and <b>semi-public</b> <b>institutions</b> had attended training courses in these subje cts, there were many significant gaps in the training of this category of employees and, as a re sult, agricultural planning has suffered from a scarcity of well-trained manpower. On -the-job training had also been inadequate. It was concluded that the relatively small n umber of graduates in agricultural economics meant that the need for adequate training pr ogrammes had increased; refresher courses for those who graduated in the 1960 s and 1970 s wer e needed, and more on-the-job training for those who had graduated in the 1980 s was recomm endedAlthough it was the original intention that a project supporting agr icultural policy analysis and planning be formulated for the consideration of UNDP, it was agreed that this should not be done until a second project funded by the FAO Technical Coope ration Programme, TCP/JOR/ 8951, `Assistance in Agriculture Policy Analysis', was comple ted, so that its findings might be taken into accountIt was recommended that training in this sector become a continuous process, which would require the development and application of supporting policies and m easures, including an appropriate personnel policy. The responsibility for project analy sis lies with the Planning and Economics Unit of the Ministry of Agriculture, and it was there fore recommended that its technical staff receive further training in project identif ication and formulation, using examples drawn from the Jordanian situation and experience: this implied that local training material needed to be developed. It was recommended that sp ecial courses be held to train trainers, and that advanced courses be established for selected senior staff, with an emphasis on the use of agricultural policy tool...|$|R
40|$|Italian forestland {{ownership}} {{system is}} characterized by various local public and <b>semi-public</b> (or semi-private) <b>institutions</b> with different internal rules, competences and functions. The paper tries to describe the ongoing status of these institutions {{in the light of}} their recent development. In the past, Common Properties superintended to several aspects of local community life and acted as main regulator of the use of natural resources. Thought to be unable to promote technological and economic development in the agriculture sector, common domains have been tackled since 19 th Century: common lands were progressively “freed” and put under the administration of Municipalities. Today, a new wave of devolution and institutional reorganization poses new focus on the role of forest commons in ensuring environmental conservation, and fostering socio-economical development of mountain areas. Moving from a renewed favourable State legislation, some Italian Regions promoted their reconstitution. The paper, based on information collected through a semi-structured questionnaire carried out among representatives of Municipalities where Common Properties exist, investigates the degree of cooperation between Municipalities and either long-lasting and newly reconstituted Common Properties. We try to demonstrate that not always the outcomes of the transformation of municipal forests to Common Properties are positive in terms of enlarged public participation by local residents, introduction of innovations and improved forest management practices...|$|R
