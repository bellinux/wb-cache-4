He made several comparisons between the faunas of different locations, <b>so</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that he did not mention a crest on the Rodrigues starling indicates that it was absent.

500|$|Fenwick also asks rhetorically, [...] "Should we {{completely}} {{discount the}} testimonials of est graduates, {{knowing that they}} are not sufficiently rigorous measures to qualify as scientific evidence? [...] I don’t think <b>so.</b> <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> that positive testimonials are so readily obtained from est graduates, in combination with the observation that a majority of people who take the est training, continue to participate and have found the est experience to be rewarding. [...] Even if 'objective' changes are not documented in people's lives, it is noteworthy that people feel happier, more satisfied, more relaxed, and more 'alive.' If you 'feel' happier, then you 'are' happier – objective circumstances notwithstanding. Subjective states are clearly an important component of our lives." ...|$|E

50|$|However, {{accounts}} {{of this are}} mixed with similar accounts about the betrothal of the younger Tiberius Gracchus to his wife Claudia, <b>so</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> are not certain. In both versions, the father hastens to make a betrothal to a Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus, without consulting the mother (his wife), to which the wife protests until she is informed that the bridegroom is Gracchus.|$|R

500|$|John Bradley, who portrays Samwell Tarly, {{also spoke}} about the scene, saying [...] "And what I like about that, and seeing her like that is you know then that her {{sexuality}} {{over the course of}} the last few seasons, we've seen her use as such a tool -- that's all very deliberate. She presents herself in this way as this beautiful woman because she knows the effect that that can have on people. She knows the effect that that has on Stannis, and that can make men do unadvisable things. <b>So</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that she did that and she uses that power in that way to have this influence on people. That puts her into context as somebody who really does know what she's doing." ...|$|E
500|$|Clarkson {{performed}} [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards. Her performance garnered positive {{reviews from}} critics, who considered {{it one of}} the highlights in the event. Performing barefoot, Clarkson sang the song as rain cascaded onto the audience. Clarkson told People that one of her favourite moments on television was performing [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] at the MTV Video Music Awards, saying [...] "I hate being all dressed up, <b>so</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that I was soaking wet with mascara smeared all over my face was definitely the highlight of my evening!" [...] Becky Bain of Idolator thought that the performance was Clarkson's most memorable live performances while Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times thought Clarkson's performance was very solid despite the feeling that she sounded better dry than drenched. Clarkson performed the song on Saturday Night Live in 2005, along with the 2006 BRIT Awards which took place in Earls Court, London.|$|E
500|$|Also at WonderCon, {{a poster}} {{based on the}} season was made available, with art by Mike McKone. It {{features}} Johnson, her pose an homage to a well-known Secret Warriors cover depicting the comic version of the character, with other main characters paired behind her (Coulson and Price, the latter because [...] "she really {{was a big part}} of the first half of the season and...her death is the thing [...] drives Coulson", according to Bell; Fitz and Simmons; Hunter and Morse; May and Garner / Lash; and Mack and Elena Rodriguez). Lincoln is featured on his own, so as not to [...] "take a super strong female character [...] and reduce her to being a part of a relationship where she won't be fulfilled until she finds her man", as are Ward / Hive and Malick, the latter with the symbol of the former upon him: [...] "We have told you who Ward's become, and Hive is the person that Malick is really in a relationship with. <b>So</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that reflection is on him or in him or around him is pretty potent," [...] explained Bell.|$|E

500|$|On June 11, 2007, {{the plaintiffs}} {{presented}} their first argument, {{in which they}} contended that Michelle Cedillo, {{as well as other}} children with autism, suffered from a [...] "mercury efflux disorder" [...] which was described by Aposhian, their first expert witness, as [...] "a problem with getting a metal, in this case mercury, out of a cell." [...] As evidence that such disorders have been documented before, he pointed to Wilson's disease. Aposhian based this claim, in part, on three peer-reviewed papers. The first such study was co-authored by Boyd Haley, and concluded that hair of children with autism contained less mercury than that of children without autism. Aposhian stated that [...] "we know that the hair is an excretory organ and that the hair is reflective of the mercury or the metal in the blood, and the blood {{is a reflection of the}} mercury in the tissues, and <b>so</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that the children with autism had less mercury in their hair was a hint or indication that perhaps there was mercury efflux disorder." [...] The second of these studies was conducted by James B. Adams, and found that baby teeth of children with autism had more than twice as much mercury as those of children without autism. Aposhian cited this study as evidence that [...] "autistic children have a greater body burden of mercury." [...] Another study which Aposhian used to back up this statement was one conducted by Jeff Bradstreet and Mark Geier, which gave dimercaptosuccinic acid, a chelating agent, to children and concluded that children with autism excreted much more mercury thereafter than children without autism. [...] Aposhian also cited a number of in vitro studies as evidence that thimerosal could cause immune system dysregulation.|$|E
500|$|... "The Variable" [...] was the {{hundredth}} {{episode of the}} show to be produced and aired on television. Josh Holloway, who {{plays the role of}} Sawyer, said, [...] "Just statistically speaking, to hit a hundred episodes doesn't happen very often, especially on a show where everyone is saying 'Lost on an island? What are you gonna do after a season or two?', <b>so</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that we've lasted not only a season or two but flourishing still at this time... it's shocking... it's amazing to me." [...] In an interview with The News & Observer, Lindelof recalled meeting with the ABC executives in 2004 to pitch the idea of a plane crash and survivors stranded on an island full of mystery and danger. When Lindelof was asked by the executives where the Lost saga would stand in the future, he replied, [...] "We're probably not going to get past episode thirteen. Let's all be honest about that up front." [...] Lindelof added that if he had [...] "traveled back in time to tell myself after that meeting {{that we were going to}} make it to a hundred and still have a season beyond that, I would have laughed in my face." [...] The hundredth episode milestone was celebrated by the cast and crew on location in Oahu, Hawaii. Duff Goldman and his crew from the Food Network's American television show Ace of Cakes made a special Lost cake for the party to commemorate the milestone. The cake featured replicas of a Dharma beer bottles, the computer from the Swan station, a suitcase and a miniature Oceanic Flight 815. The Ace of Cakes episode ("LOST in Hawaii") featuring the making of the cake aired on the Food Network in the United States on May 9, 2009.|$|E
2500|$|Good {{concludes that}} the white shoe is a [...] "red herring": Sometimes even a black raven can {{constitute}} evidence against the hypothesis that all ravens are black, <b>so</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that the observation of a white shoe can support {{it is not surprising}} and not worth attention. Nicod's criterion is false, according to Good, and so the paradoxical conclusion does not follow.|$|E

2500|$|The {{criticism}} was soon afterwards made, that both Adams and Le Verrier had been over-optimistic in the precision they claimed for their calculations, and both had, by using Bode's law, greatly overestimated the planet's {{distance from the}} sun. Further, {{it was suggested that}} they both succeeded in getting the longitude almost right only because of a [...] "fluke of orbital timing". [...] This {{criticism was}} discussed in detail by Danjon (1946) [...] who illustrated with a diagram and discussion that while hypothetical orbits calculated by both LeVerrier and Adams for the new planet were indeed of very different size on the whole from that of the real Neptune (and actually similar to each other), they were both much closer to the real Neptune over that crucial segment of orbit covering the interval of years for which the observations and calculations were made, than they were {{for the rest of the}} calculated orbits. [...] <b>So</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that both the calculators used a much larger orbital major axis than the reality was shown to be not so important, and not the most relevant parameter.|$|E
2500|$|Members of a {{tribunal}} {{should not}} communicate independently or privately to any material witness. If they do <b>so,</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that communication has occurred must be disclosed {{to the parties}} concerned right away. The justification for this rule {{is that it would}} be unfair for a person to be judged on an issue based on information obtained by an adjudicator which is unknown to that person. In Re Low Fook Cheng Patricia (1998), a lawyer appealed to set aside the penalty for misconduct imposed on her by the Law Society of Singapore. The appeal was based on the ground that the chairman of the Inquiry Committee had contacted a witness to enquire if the witness could assist the committee in its inquiry, but this was not made known to the appellant. Judicial Commissioner Choo Han Teck considered such an act of private communication with a material witness as [...] "pierc the veritable armour of impartiality which every tribunal exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions must don". Thus, the penalty imposed by the Law Society was set aside.|$|E
2500|$|... "What {{was said}} in court was a defense {{argument}} made that we put a cloud over the White House, as if, one, we were inventing something or, two, making something up, in order to convince the jury {{that they ought to}} convict. And I think in any case where you feel that someone's making an argument that you are inventing something or improperly casting a cloud on someone, you respond. And we responded fairly and honestly by saying there was a cloud there caused by – not caused by us. And by Mr. Libby obstructing justice and lying about what happened, he had failed to remove the cloud. And sometimes when people tell the truth, clouds disappear. And sometimes they don't. But when you don't know what's happening, that's a problem. And <b>so</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that there was a cloud over anyone was not our doing. It was the facts of the case. It was the facts of the case. It was aggravated by Mr. Libby telling falsehoods. And that's what we said. We're not going to add to that or subtract to that. That's what we said in court, and that's the context in which we said it." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{nature and}} purpose of the symbols is a mystery. Although {{attempts}} have been made to interpret the symbols, there is no agreement as to what they might mean. At first it was thought that the symbols were simple property marks, meaning [...] "this belongs to X". A prominent holder of this view is archaeologist Peter Biehl. This theory is now mostly abandoned, as the same symbols have been repeatedly found throughout the territory of the Vinča culture, in locations hundreds of kilometers and years away from each other. The prevailing theory is that the symbols were used for religious purposes in a traditional agricultural society. If <b>so,</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that the same symbols were used for centuries with little change suggests that the ritual meaning and culture represented by the symbols likewise remained constant for a very long time, with no need for further development. The use of the symbols appears to have been abandoned (along with the objects on which they appear) at the start of the Bronze Age, suggesting that the new technology brought with it significant changes in social organization and beliefs.|$|E
