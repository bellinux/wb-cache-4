5|$|A gene is a <b>sequence</b> of DNA that {{contains}} genetic information and {{can influence the}} phenotype of an organism. Within a gene, the <b>sequence</b> of bases along a DNA strand defines a messenger RNA <b>sequence,</b> which then defines one or more protein sequences. The relationship between the nucleotide sequences of genes and the amino-acid sequences of proteins {{is determined by the}} rules of translation, known collectively as the genetic code. The genetic code consists of three-letter 'words' called codons formed from a <b>sequence</b> of three nucleotides (e.g. ACT, CAG, TTT).|$|E
5|$|A star remains {{near its}} initial {{position}} on the main <b>sequence</b> until {{a significant amount of}} hydrogen in the core has been consumed, then begins to evolve into a more luminous star. (On the HR diagram, the evolving star moves up and {{to the right of the}} main <b>sequence.)</b> Thus the main <b>sequence</b> represents the primary hydrogen-burning stage of a star's lifetime.|$|E
5|$|As Sylvester himself observed, Sylvester's <b>sequence</b> {{seems to}} be unique in having such quickly growing values, while {{simultaneously}} having a series of reciprocals that converges to a rational number. This <b>sequence</b> provides an example showing that double-exponential growth {{is not enough to}} cause an integer <b>sequence</b> to be an irrationality <b>sequence.</b>|$|E

Finally, we give {{an example of the}} families of the extended TN <b>sequences,</b> which are constructed from Legendre <b>sequences.</b> Key words: Correlation, d-form <b>sequences,</b> binary <b>sequences...</b>|$|R

Beginning with The Spy Who Loved Me, the teasers {{emphasised}} not only action sequences but stunts, a practice that prevailed until Casino Royale.

40|$|In {{this report}} {{we will discuss}} non-periodic bi-infinite <b>sequences.</b> The {{elements}} of these <b>sequences</b> have value - 1 or + 1. We will consider <b>sequences</b> of four diferent types. <b>Sequences</b> of these types can be constructed in a certain manner. Based on this manner of constructing, the overlap distribution of <b>sequences</b> {{of each of these}} four types can be determined. We will demonstrate known results about three types of <b>sequences.</b> These are about Thue-Morse <b>sequences,</b> Toeplitz <b>sequences</b> and Fibonacci <b>sequences.</b> For these three types of <b>sequences</b> a manner of constructing the <b>sequences</b> of these types and the overlap distribution is known.

50|$|A {{scrambler}} replaces <b>sequences</b> (referred to as whitening <b>sequences)</b> {{into other}} <b>sequences</b> without removing undesirable <b>sequences,</b> {{and as a}} result it changes the probability of occurrence of vexatious <b>sequences.</b> Clearly it is not foolproof as there are input <b>sequences</b> that yield all-zeros, all-ones, or other undesirable periodic output <b>sequences.</b> A scrambler is therefore not a good substitute for a line code, which, through a coding step, removes unwanted <b>sequences.</b>|$|R
5|$|From {{the point}} of view of sheaf cohomology, the Mayer–Vietoris <b>sequence</b> is related to Čech cohomology. Specifically, it arises from the {{degeneration}} of the spectral <b>sequence</b> that relates Čech cohomology to sheaf cohomology (sometimes called the Mayer–Vietoris spectral <b>sequence)</b> in the case where the open cover used to compute the Čech cohomology consists of two open sets. This spectral <b>sequence</b> exists in arbitrary topoi.|$|E
5|$|If i < j, {{it follows}} from the {{definition}} that s'j ≡ 1 (mod s'i). Therefore, every two numbers in Sylvester's <b>sequence</b> are relatively prime. The <b>sequence</b> {{can be used to}} prove that there are infinitely many prime numbers, as any prime can divide at most one number in the <b>sequence.</b> More strongly, no prime factor of a number in the <b>sequence</b> can be congruent to 5 (mod 6), and the <b>sequence</b> can be used to prove that there are infinitely many primes congruent to 7 (mod 12).|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} hybrid <b>sequences,</b> that is, <b>sequences</b> in {{a multidimensional}} unit cube that are composed from low-discrepancy <b>sequences</b> and <b>sequences</b> of pseudorandom numbers. We establish the first nontrivial deterministic discrepancy bounds for {{three kinds of}} hybrid <b>sequences</b> that are obtained by “mixing” low-discrepancy <b>sequences</b> and digital explicit inversive <b>sequences.</b> Such hybrid <b>sequences</b> are of interest for high-dimensional numerical integration since they combine the advantages of Monte Carlo methods and quasi-Monte Carlo methods...|$|R
30|$|Compared with GPC and GPZ <b>sequences</b> which {{limit the}} flock size to be two, Z-complementary binary <b>sequences</b> [15] have fewer {{restrictions}} on the flock size. As a more general concept, Z-complementary <b>sequences</b> include the conventional complementary <b>sequences</b> as special cases. These <b>sequences</b> can efficiently resolve the limits on the lengths of conventional complementary <b>sequences,</b> and the theoretical bound given by [15] shows that Z-complementary <b>sequences</b> have much larger set size than conventional complementary <b>sequences.</b> In terms of the set of Z-complementary mates generated in [15], the zero cross-correlation zone (ZCCZ) {{is equal to the}} length of element <b>sequences,</b> and is usually larger than the zero autocorrelation zone (ZACZ) except that Z-complementary <b>sequences</b> become conventional complementary <b>sequences.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{high demand}} for {{low-cost}} <b>sequencing</b> has driven {{the development of}} high-throughput <b>sequencing</b> technologies that parallelize the <b>sequencing</b> process, producing thousands or millions of <b>sequences</b> at once. High-throughput <b>sequencing</b> is intended to {{lower the cost of}} DNA <b>sequencing</b> beyond what is possible with standard dye-terminator methods. In ultra-high-throughput <b>sequencing,</b> as many as 500,000 sequencing-by-synthesis operations may be run in parallel.|$|R
5|$|In 2010 the <b>Sequence</b> Read Archive made up {{approximately}} 95% of {{the base}} pair data available through the ENA, encompassing over 500,000,000,000 <b>sequence</b> reads made up of over 60 trillion (6×1013) base pairs. Almost half of this data was deposited {{in relation to the}} 1000 Genomes Project wherein the researchers published their <b>sequence</b> data to the SRA in real-time.

30|$|If the {{unimodal}} <b>sequences</b> {{of weight}} n are not strongly unimodal <b>sequences</b> of weight n, {{then they are}} usually referred as weakly unimodal <b>sequences.</b> For example, the <b>sequences</b> of binomial coefficients {nj}_j= 0 ^n are the unimodal <b>sequences</b> of weight 2 ^n. If n is even in the 2 ^n, then the associated <b>sequences</b> of binomial coefficients {nj}_j= 0 ^n are strongly unimodal <b>sequences</b> of weight 2 ^n. If n is odd in the 2 ^n, then the associated <b>sequences</b> of binomial coefficients {nj}_j= 0 ^n are weakly unimodal <b>sequences</b> of weight 2 ^n.|$|R

5|$|<b>Sequence</b> {{analysis}} {{suggests that the}} catalytic β subunits diverged earlier in evolution than the predominantly structural α subunits. In bacteria that express a 20S proteasome, the β subunits have high <b>sequence</b> identity to archaeal and eukaryotic β subunits, whereas the α <b>sequence</b> identity is much lower. The presence of 20S proteasomes in bacteria may result from lateral gene transfer, while the diversification of subunits among eukaryotes is ascribed to multiple gene duplication events.|$|E
5|$|The ENA {{operates}} {{an instance}} of the <b>Sequence</b> Read Archive (SRA), an archival repository of <b>sequence</b> reads and analyses which are intended for public release. Originally called the Short Read Archive, the name was changed in anticipation of future sequencing technologies being able to produce longer <b>sequence</b> reads. Currently, the archive accepts <b>sequence</b> reads generated by next-generation sequencing platforms such as the Illumina Genome Analyzer and ABI SOLiD {{as well as some}} corresponding analyses and alignments.
