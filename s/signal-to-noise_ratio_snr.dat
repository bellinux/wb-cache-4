25|$|Typically in MRS {{a single}} {{spectrum}} is acquired by averaging enough spectra {{over a long}} acquisition time. Averaging is necessary because of the complex spectral structures and relatively low concentrations of many brain metabolites, which result in a low <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratio</b> (<b>SNR)</b> in MRS of a living brain.|$|E
25|$|Radar systems must {{overcome}} unwanted signals {{in order to}} focus on the targets of interest. These unwanted signals may originate from internal and external sources, both passive and active. The ability of the radar system to overcome these unwanted signals defines its <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratio</b> (<b>SNR).</b> SNR is defined as the ratio of the signal power to the noise power within the desired signal; it compares the level of a desired target signal to the level of background noise (atmospheric noise and noise generated within the receiver). The higher a system's SNR the better it is at discriminating actual targets from noise signals.|$|E
25|$|FM {{provides}} improved <b>Signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratio</b> (<b>SNR),</b> {{as compared}} for example with AM. Compared with an optimum AM scheme, FM typically has poorer SNR below a certain signal level called the noise threshold, but above {{a higher level}} – the full improvement or full quieting threshold – the SNR is much improved over AM. The improvement depends on modulation level and deviation. For typical voice communications channels, improvements are typically 5-15dB. FM broadcasting using wider deviation can achieve even greater improvements. Additional techniques, such as pre-emphasis of higher audio frequencies with corresponding de-emphasis in the receiver, are generally used to improve overall SNR in FM circuits. Since FM signals have constant amplitude, FM receivers normally have limiters that remove AM noise, further improving SNR.|$|E

2500|$|The most {{significant}} fraction of electron–positron annihilations results in two 511 keV gamma photons being emitted at almost 180 degrees to each other; hence, {{it is possible}} to localize their source along a straight line of coincidence (also called the line of response, or LOR). In practice, the LOR has a non-zero width as the emitted photons are not exactly 180 degrees apart. If the resolving time of the detectors is less than 500 picoseconds rather than about 10 nanoseconds, {{it is possible to}} localize the event to a segment of a chord, whose length is determined by the detector timing resolution.
