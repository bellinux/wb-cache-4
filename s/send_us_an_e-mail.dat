30|$|In {{order to}} attract the best manuscripts and to provide good {{feedback}} to authors, high-quality reviews are essential. Reviewers spend much time and effort helping authors {{to improve the quality}} of their submitted manuscripts and assisting the Editor-in-Chief in selecting the best papers to be published. Their work is immensely valuable. Therefore, it is important to constantly improve the review process and increase the number of reviewers within the defined areas of interest and expertise.

40|$|Bank {{internal}} ratings of corporate clients {{are intended to}} quantify the expected likelihood of future borrower defaults. This paper develops a comprehensive framework for {{evaluating the quality of}} standard rating systems. We suggest a number of principles that ought to be met by 'good rating practice'. These 'generally accepted rating principles' are potentially relevant for the improvement of existing rating systems. They are also relevant for the development of certification standards for internal rating systems, as currently discussed in a consultative paper issued by the Bank for International Settlement in Basle, entitled 'A new capital adequacy framework'. We would very much appreciate any comments by readers that help to develop these rating standards further. Simply <b>send</b> <b>us</b> <b>an</b> <b>E-mail,</b> or give us a call...|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{previously}} shown, that classically chaotic kicked systems, whose unperturbed spectrum posseses one energy scale, admits a quantum anti-resonance (QAR) behavior. In this study we extend {{the conditions under which}} which this QAR occurs for the case of a two-sided kicked 1 D infinite potential well. It is then shown by a perturbative argument that this QAR effects the behavior of the equivalent driven well, i. e., the number of periods needed to leave the initial state has a sharp peak around the QAR. We give a numerical evidence that the anti resonance persists even for large values of the perturbation parameter. Comment: The first figure is available only via FAX. It contains only a Poincare map of the classical system (see text) Most readers could do without it.

40|$|We {{consider}} the quantum mechanical {{behavior of a}} driven particle in an infinite 1 D potential well. We show that the time dependent perturbation series is induced by the delicate non-trivial properties of the momentum operator in this case, namely, its non-self-adjointness. Using this expansion, we calculate the first order contribution to the cross section and the energy gain, and discuss their classical limit. In this limit the one-period energy gain converges to its classical analog - the classical local (momentum space) diffusion coefficient. Both the classical and quantum mechanical results are compared with numerical simulations. Comment: The first figure is available only via FAX. It contains only a Poincrare map of the classical system (see text). It can be found also in our paper in the Jan. 96 volume of PRE. Most readers could do without it.

40|$|In 2005, a {{group of}} {{scholars}} and activists, mostly from the global South, created the Copy/South Research Group to analyse, criticise, and confront the oppressive nature of current global copyright regimes, such as those defended by the World Intellectual Property Organisation, and similar ones around the globe. In May 2006, 22 of us, including 15 people from the global South, published THE COPY/SOUTH DOSSIER: Issues in the economics, politics, and ideology of copyright in the global South. The aim of the Dossier was {{to open up a}} critical and radical debate on the real impact of copyright laws and how they affect the daily lives of people living in more than 150 developing countries of the global South. We also highlighted issues that are not unique to the Global South, but also affect both sides of the North-South divide. This publication of more than 50 articles was addressed to researchers, educators, librarians, musicians, activists, organizations concerned about access to knowledge, and all of those who {{want to learn more about}} the oppressive global role of copyright laws and, in particular, their largely negative role in the developing countries of the global South. Given the democratic objectives of the Copy/South Research Group, the Dossier was not restricted by copyright. Therefore, it has been accessed openly and freely in both electronic and paper formats by thousands of readers from around the world in English. But English is not spoken by all citizens in the global South. With this in mind, the entire 200 -page Dossier was translated into Spanish in late 2007 by an enthusiastic team of voluntary translators from Argentina, Bolivia, Cuba, Mexico, Spain, and Venezuela. As for this Spanish version, made with the support of the Intellectual Property Automous Service (SAPI), from the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, we must acknowledge the prior SAPI's General Director Eduardo Samán for promoting the making of this translation. Besides the general revision of Gerardo Cárdenas and his labor as main translator, some other volunteers translated or revised important sections of the Spanish edition: María Jesús Morillo (Spain), Oscar Pérez Peña and Gilda Gil (Cuba), Edgardo Civallero (Argentina) and Rafael Carreño (Venezuela), who coordinated the process of translation in 2007. Also it is worth to mention the additional colaboration of Ana Lía López (Bolivia), Richard Castro, Rafael Bellota and Carmen Chirinos (Venezuela), Zapopan Muela and Gonzalo Lara (Mexico), and Lilian Álvarez (Cuba). But what is still more extraordinary about this Spanish translation is that it was completely coordinated and edited by the Servicio Autonomo de la Propiedad Intelectual (SAPI) of the democratic government of the Venezuelan Bolivarian Republic. The Dossier provides “useful material to introduce this topic to teachers and students” and does a good job of “summarizing a complex and conflicting situation” for developing countries, Jumersi La Rosa, SAPI’s new director, said last week in announcing the release of the Spanish edition. She has written a special new introduction for the Spanish-language edition. The Copy South Research Group is very pleased that the radical message of resistance found in the Dossier can now be read by thousands of Spanish-language speakers who are questioning the current copyright regime and who hopefully will be ignited by the ideas in the Dossier to take up the fight against oppressive regimes based on copyright. You can get a copy of the Dossier in Spanish and English by downloading it, free of charge, at [URL].
