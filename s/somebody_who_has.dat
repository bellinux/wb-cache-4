Legal & General's commission urged Piano to avoid designing a [...] "plain vanilla office building" [...] and called for the new development to be [...] "a fantastic place for people to work". As an incentive, it offered to pay an extra 10% above the normal going rate for London office developments. Piano decided to take the commission because, as he put it, [...] "the client and the company involved were all about long lasting quality, without rushing.

[...] "We needed <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> a bit {{of rock and roll}} sensibility in him", Andrew Lloyd Webber explained.

500|$|Reports {{arose in}} the media that the ticket sales for the tour were falling, leading Arthur Fogel, Chairman of Live Nation's Global Touring division, to brand them as [...] "ridiculous". He {{clarified}} to Billboard that the about 80% of the tickets were sold in North America and Europe, and {{they were still in}} the process of releasing future dates for numerous venues. The 29 shows in North America had grossed around US $26 million, with an average of almost $900,000 per show. Fogel also addressed concerns that Live Nation had lost $30 million from Gaga's tour, saying that if a similar situation really happened, then the company would have cancelled the concerts. [...] "I just don't know how this shit gets any traction without people doing their homework... Just a complete fool would say something like that and it could only come from <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> an agenda, because it makes absolutely no sense, on any level", Fogel concluded.

[...] "It's Wuthering Heights or Jane Eyre. Everybody loves <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> a past and a secret- and certainly Dimitri does- which we haven't divulged yet. That heightens ones interest and suspense. It's a special situation but what really makes it special is the actor's talent, personalities, good looks, and chemistry." [...] Since the writers created Dimitri as a very mysterious character, Michael Nader mostly {{stayed away from the}} press in order to help maintain that image. Whenever he did do an interview, he discussed the character {{in such a way as}} to add more mystery. Nader compared Dimitri to the Dynasty character he once portrayed, Dex Dexter. On Dynasty, [...] "John James (Jeff Colby) played the 'aw, shucks;' nice guy, and I played the guy who was on the edge, who would take care of business and not take any bull", he said. [...] "Dimitri is sort of a darker Dex. Though I don't know exactly how dark to make him yet." [...] Nader, as an actor, also provided the writers with more inspiration on the character. [...] "The more we see of him, the more he inspires us", Broderick said. [...] "It's just a wonderful marriage of actor and character He's giving us so many levels and such depth, that it's a challenge. But it's exciting. Dimitri is one of the characters that is so much fun to write." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{score to}} The Punisher was {{composed}} and conducted by Italian composer Carlo Siliotto. Director Jonathan Hensleigh wanted {{the music to}} be very emotional, and was aware of Siliotto's previous work which led to him being chosen. When scoring the film Siliotto saw Frank Castle as a tragic figure stating, [...] "This man, Frank Castle, is <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> a slaughtered family. He comes through that slaughter, and becomes a punisher. But he's a sad man - he drinks, and has bad memories always coming to him.

He never bothered to try to be happy with what he had …”. Willy also believes that to attain success, one must have a suitable personality. According to another analyst, “He believes that salesmanship is based on ‘sterling traits of character’ and ‘a pleasing personality.’ But Willy does not have the requisite sterling traits of character; people simply do not like him as much as he thinks is necessary for success.” ...|$|E

After several unsuccessful attempts at walking, the pair left the arena in tears, both mother and daughter visibly upset at being turned aside and crying as they explained to the undercover reporters that all Grace had wanted was for Hinn to pray for her, but the staffers rushed them out of the line when they found out Grace had not been healed. A week later at a service in Toronto, Baptist evangelist Justin Peters, who wrote his Masters in Divinity thesis on Benny Hinn and has attended numerous Hinn crusades since 2000 as part of his research for his thesis and for a seminar he developed about the Word of Faith movement entitled A Call for Discernment, also demonstrated to the hidden cameras that [...] "people who look like me"—Peters has cerebral palsy, walks with arm-crutches, and is obviously and visibly disabled—"are never allowed on stage [...] it's always <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> some disability or disease that cannot be readily seen."
