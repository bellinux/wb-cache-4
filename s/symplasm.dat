It is suggested that Mitchell's chemiosmotic hypothesis as applied to ion transport might account for the process. A model based on this hypothesis shows the <b>symplasm</b> as an osmotic unit connecting two isolated solutions, but with {{no significant difference in}} proton motive force across the unit. If it is assumed that the resistance to transport by plasmalemma uniports and antiports differs in the cortical and stelar ends of the <b>symplasm,</b> the model will provide for an influx of ions to the xylem.

40|$|The {{presence}} of PD, channels {{within the walls}} between neigh-boring cells, {{can be interpreted as}} the main reason determined at least 2 continuous systems in plants: apoplast and <b>symplasm.</b> 1 The apoplast is an extraprotoplasmic region composed of cell walls with microspaces within the cell wall, some intercellular spaces, and the lumina of dead cells. 2 The <b>symplasm</b> is a system consisting of all protoplasts interconnected by PD and bounded by continuous plasma membrane. 3 Terminology used for the description of these systems in not consistent in the literature and because of it, the terminology proposed by Romberger et al. 1 will be used.

40|$|To {{estimate}} {{rates of}} Al accumulation within the <b>symplasm,</b> all apoplastic pools of Al {{need to be}} eliminated or accounted for. We have developed a revised kinetic protocol {{that allows us to}} estimate the contribution of mucilage-bound Al to total, nonexchangeable Al, and to eliminate the mucilage as an apoplastic pool of Al. By comparing the Al content of excised root tips (2 cm) of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) with and without the removal of the mucilage (using a 10 -min wash in 1 M NH 4 Cl), we found that Al bound to the mucilage accounted for approximately 25 to 35 % of Al remaining after desorption in citric acid. The kinetics of Al uptake into mucilage were biphasic, with a rapid phase occurring in the first 30 min of uptake, followed by a linear phase occurring in the remainder of the experimental period (180 min). By adopting a step for removal of mucilage into our existing kinetic protocol, {{we have been able to}} isolate a linear phase of uptake with only a slight deviation from linearity in the first 5 min. Although we cannot unambiguously identify this phase of uptake as uptake into the <b>symplasm,</b> we believe this new protocol provides us with the most accurate quantitative estimate of symplastic Al yet available...|$|E

The extracted soil solutions were successively filtered through membranes with a pore size of less than 0. 45 mum and a molecular weight cutoff of less than 1 kDa, which were termed colloidal and truly dissolved fractions, respectively. Apoplastically and symplastically bound LREEs in maize roots were experimentally distinguished by ultrasound-assisted desorption with 1 mM CaCl 2 solution at 0 degreesC in ice-cooled water bath. When the LMWOAs extraction method was used, a good correlation was obtained between LREEs in soil colloidal and truly dissolved fractions and LREEs bound to apoplasm and <b>symplasm</b> of maize root. Both apoplastically and symplastically bound LREEs are the result of bioavailability. However, a poor correlation was obtained between LREEs in fractions water soluble, exchangeable and carbonate bound (B 1) and Fe-Mn oxide bound (B 2) of the BCR method and LREEs in apoplasm and <b>symplasm</b> and in intact roots.

40|$|This article {{reviews the}} {{responses}} of plant roots to elevated rhizosphere cadmium (Cd) concentrations. Cadmium enters plants from the soil solution. It traverses the root through symplasmic or apoplasmic pathways before entering the xylem and being translocated to the shoot. Leaf Cd concentrations in excess of 5 – 10 mg g 21 dry matter are toxic to most plants, and plants have evolved mechanisms to limit Cd translocation to the shoot. Cadmium movement through the root <b>symplasm</b> {{is thought to be}} restricted by the production of phytochelatins and the sequestration of Cd-chelates in vacuoles. Apoplasmic movement of Cd to the xylem can be restricted by the development of the exodermis, endodermis, and other extracellular barriers. Increasing rhizosphere Cd concen-trations increase Cd accumulation in the plant, especially in the root. The presence of Cd in the rhizosphere inhibits root elongation and influences root anatomy. Cadmium concentrations are greater in the root apoplasm than in the root <b>symplasm,</b> and tissue Cd concentrations decrease from peripheral to inner root tissues. This article reviews current knowledge of the proteins involved in the transport of Cd across root cell membranes and its detoxification through sequestration in root vacuoles. It describes the development of apoplastic barriers to Cd movement to the xylem and highlights recent experiments indicating that their maturation is accelerated by high Cd concentrations in their immediate locality. It concludes that accelerated maturation of the endodermis in response to local Cd availability is of functional significance in protecting the shoot from excessive Cd loads...|$|E
40|$|Radiotracer {{techniques}} {{were employed to}} characterize 65 Zn 2 + influx into the root <b>symplasm</b> and translocation to the shoot in Thlaspi caerulescens, a Zn hyperaccumulator, and Thlaspi arvense, a nonaccumulator. A protocol was developed that allowed us to quantify unidirectional 65 Zn 2 + influx across the root-cell plasma membrane (20 min of radioactive uptake followed by 15 min of desorption in a 100 [mu]M ZnCl 2 + 5 mM CaCl 2 solution). Concentration-dependent Zn 2 + influx in both Thlaspi species yielded nonsaturating kinetic curves that could be resolved into linear and saturable components. The linear kinetic component was shown to be cell-wall-bound Zn 2 + remaining in the root after desorption, and the saturable component was due to Zn 2 + influx across the root-cell plasma membrane. This saturable component followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with similar apparent Michaelis constant values for T. caerulescens and T. arvense (8 and 6 [mu]M, respectively). However, the maximum initial velocity for Zn 2 + influx in T. caerulescens root cells was 4. 5 -fold higher than for T. arvense, indicating that enhanced absorption into the root {{is one of the}} mechanisms involved in Zn hyperaccumulation. After 96 h 10 -fold more 65 Zn was translocated to the shoot of T. caerulescens compared with T. arvense. This indicates that transport sites other than entry into the root <b>symplasm</b> are also stimulated in T. caerulescens. We suggest that although increased root Zn 2 + influx is a significant component, transport across the plasma membrane and tonoplast of leaf cells must also be critical sites for Zn hyperaccumulation in T. caerulescens...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} abscisic acid (ABA) on the {{exudation}} process in excised sunflower root was investigated. A promotion of both ion flux and volume exudation rate was observed. Cutting off the external supply of ions {{to the roots}} markedly increased {{the magnitude of the}} ABA effect. The promotive effect of ABA on exudation rate was extremely rapid (less than 6 minutes) and seemed to be biphasic. Reasons are given for relating the ABA effect to two separate actions, namely: (a) on water permeability; and (b) on the release of ions both from vacuoles to the cytoplasm and from <b>symplasm</b> to the xylem.

30|$|According to this {{cellular}} mechanism, subsequent {{movement of}} Cd through the root <b>symplasm</b> to the xylem can be limited (Nocito et al. 2011). Some reports pointed that OsHMA 3 {{is expressed in}} shoots besides roots, which implies the key factor of OsHMA 3 in determining root-to-shoot transfer of Cd and regulation of Cd distribution within rice. Particularly, cellular sequestration mediated by OsHMA 3 in root cells is a rate-limiting step (Ueno et al. 2010). Furthermore, an ABC-type transporter OsABCG 43 is also {{considered to be a}} probable candidate for Cd tolerance in rice (Oda et al. 2011; Uraguchi and Fujiwara 2012). OsABCG 43 is likely to sequester Cd at the subcellular level, as well as vacuolar sequestration mediated by OsHMA 3 (Oda et al. 2011) (Table  1). Nevertheless, whether there are other mechanisms mediated by OsABCG 43 is far from clear.|$|E
40|$|The ion {{relations}} of the halophytc Suaeda maritima are described. When plants grew in 340 mol m− 3 sodium chloride (— 1 ⋅ 76 MPa) leaf solute potentials decreased, and were sustained around — 2 ⋅ 5 MPa Inorganic ion concentration (mostly of sodium chloride) accounted for this. Comparable shoot ion concentrations of potassium, nitrate and sulphate occurred when plants grew on different salinity types characterized by these ions. Net sodium transport and shoot sodium concentration increased dramatically with increases in external sodium chloride concentration up to 85 mol m− 3; thereafter, further increases in external sodium chloride concentration had relatively little effect upon either shoot sodium concentration or upon net transport of sodium to the shoot. The net transport of sodium plus potassium only doubled when the external concentration of sodium plus potassium increased from 24 to 687 mol m− 3 Shoot ion concentrations were remarkably constant with time, external concentration and salinity type. The membrane flux rates and symplasmic ion concentrations needed to sustain the observed net transport of sodium (of some 10 mmol g− 1 dry wt. of roots d− 1) are calculated from anatomical and stereological data for the root system of this species. The minimum net sodium chloride flux to load the <b>symplasm</b> would be 260 nmol m− 2 s− 1 if the whole cortical and epidermal plasmalemmal surface area were used uniformly, but the flux rate required would be 3000 nmol m− 2 s− 1 if uptake took place only at the root surface. A flux rate of at least 1000 nmol m− 2 s− 1 is needed between <b>symplasm</b> and xylem. The symplasmic concentration of NaCl {{would be at least}} 80 mol m− 3. It is argued (1), that both symplasmic and xylem loading are likely to be passive processes mediated by ion channels rather than active carriers, (2), that net ion transport at 340 mol m− 3 sodium chloride is close to the maximum which is physiologically sustainable and (3), that growth of this halophyte is limited by NaCl supply from the root...|$|E
40|$|SummaryIn plants, auxin {{functions}} as a master controller of development, pattern formation, morphogenesis, and tropic responses. A sophisticated transport system has evolved to allow the establishment of precise spatiotemporal auxin gradients that regulate specific developmental programs. A critical unresolved question relates to how these gradients can be maintained {{in the presence of}} open plasmodesmata that allow for symplasmic exchange of essential nutrients and signaling macromolecules. Here we addressed this conundrum using genetic, physiological, and cell biological approaches and identified the operation of an auxin-GSL 8 feedback circuit that regulates the level of plasmodesmal-localized callose in order to locally downregulate symplasmic permeability during hypocotyl tropic response. This system likely involves a plasmodesmal switch that would prevent the dissipation of a forming gradient by auxin diffusion through the <b>symplasm.</b> This regulatory system may represent a mechanism by which auxin could also regulate symplasmic delivery {{of a wide range of}} signaling agents...|$|E

Plasmodesmata bridge the rigid physical barrier presented by the cell wall to extend the <b>symplasm</b> from single cells to tissue domains that have functional importance for tissue growth, development, and defense.

40|$|The {{influence}} of several uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation and inhibitors of terminal electron transport was studied on absorption and long distance transport of both K and C 1 at concentrations within each {{range of the}} dual isotherm typical of ion uptake by maize roots. At low concentrations {{in the range of}} system 1, the system considered to implement ion movement through the plasma membrane, root absorption and long distance transport are equally inhibited by a given inhibitor. In the high range of system 2, the system considered to mediate ion passage through the tonoplast, long distance transport is markedly less sensitive to inhibitors than is absorption. The observations are in accord with the hypothesis that only system 1 is involved in the uptake of ions from the external solution into the symplast, and hence into the xylem.

The optimum permeability is large enough to permit substantial passive permeation into sieve cells in the source leaf and yet is small enough to permit phloem transport with some retention. The optimum permeability {{is a function of the}} velocity of sap flow in sieve tubes, the radius of the sieve tube, the over-all length of the plant, and the length of the carbohydrate and xenobiotic sources. It is argued that the nematicide, oxamyl, is near the optimum permeability under some experimental conditions.

40|$|Aluminium (Al) {{toxicity}} {{is one of}} {{the major}} limiting factors for barley production on acid soils. It inhibits root cell division and elongation, thus reducing water and nutrient uptake, consequently resulting in poor plant growth and yield. Plants tolerate Al either through external resistance mechanisms, by which Al is excluded from plant tissues or internal tolerance mechanisms, conferring the ability of plants to tolerate Al ion in the plant <b>symplasm</b> where Al that has permeated the plasmalemma is sequestered or converted into an innocuous form. Barley is considered to be most sensitive to Al toxicity among cereal species. Al tolerance in barley has been assessed by several methods, such as nutrient solution culture, soil bioassay and field screening. Genetic and molecular mapping research has shown that Al tolerance in barley is controlled by a single locus which is located on chromosome 4 H.

40|$|There is {{evidence}} that colonisation by mycorrhizal fungi can protect host plants from toxic concentrations of heavy metals. The mechanism by which protection {{is provided by the}} fungus for any particular metal is poorly understood. Rice (Oryza sativa L) plants were inoculated with Glomus mosseae and grown for 4 weeks to ensure strong colonisation. The plants were then exposed to low to toxic concentrations of copper (Cu) and the uptake and distribution were examined. The effect of mycorrhizal colonisation on the cell wall composition and Cu binding capacity of roots was also investigated. Mycorrhizal plants showed moderate reductions in Cu concentrations in roots but large reductions in shoots. In roots, mycorrhizal plants accumulated more Cu in cell walls but much less in the <b>symplasm</b> compared to non-mycorrhizal plants. The differences in cell wall binding of Cu could be partly explained by changes in the composition of the cell wall. The mechanistic basis for the reduced Cu accumulation and the potential beneficial consequences of mycorrhizal associations on plant growth in Cu toxic soil are discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The pathway of phloem {{unloading}} and the metabolism of translocated sucrose {{were determined}} in corn (Zea mays) seedling roots. Several lines of evidence show that exogenous sucrose, unlike translocated sucrose, is hydrolyzed in the apoplast prior to uptake into the root cortical cells. These include (a) presence of cell wall invertase activity which represents 20 % {{of the total}} tissue activity; (b) similarity in uptake and metabolism of [14 C]sucrose and [14 C]hexoses; and (c) randomization of 14 C within the hexose moieties of intracellular sucrose following accumulation of [14 C] (fructosyl) sucrose. Conversely, translocated sucrose does not undergo apoplastic hydrolysis during unloading. Asymmetrically labeled sucrose ([14 C](fructose) sucrose), translocated from the germinating kernels to the root, remained intact indicating a symplastic pathway for unloading. In addition, isolated root protoplasts and vacuoles were used to demonstrate that soluble invertase activity (Vmax = 29 micromoles per milligram protein per hour, Km = 4 millimolar) was located mainly in the vacuole, suggesting that translocated sucrose entered via the <b>symplasm</b> and was hydrolyzed at the vacuole prior to metabolism...|$|E
40|$|Root {{cortical}} and stelar protoplasts {{were isolated}} from maize (Zea mays L.) plants that were either well watered or water stressed, and the patch-clamp technique {{was used to}} investigate their plasma membrane K+ channel activity. In the root cortex water stress did not significantly affect inward- or outward-rectifying K+ conductances relative to those observed in well-watered plants. In contrast, water stress significantly reduced {{the magnitude of the}} outward-rectifying K+ current in the root stele but had little effect on the inward-rectifying K+ current. Pretreating well-watered plants with abscisic acid also significantly affected K+ currents {{in a way that was}} consistent with abscisic acid mediating, at least in part, the response of roots to water stress. It is proposed that the K+ channels underlying the K+ currents in the root stelar cells represent pathways that allow K+ exchange between the root <b>symplasm</b> and xylem apoplast. It is suggested that the regulation of K+ channel activity in the root in response to water stress could be part of an important adaptation of the plant to survive drying soils...|$|E
40|$|Reactive {{oxygen species}} (ROS) are {{produced}} continuously in plants {{and act as}} important signalling molecules in many cellular processes including stress and defence responses. ROS can arise from external sources {{as well as being}} generated by the plant. Pollutants, such as ozone, enter the leaf via stomata and dissolve in the apoplast. ROS can arise both intracellularly and apoplastically: superoxide is produced during photosynthesis {{as well as by the}} plasma membrane bound NADPH oxidase during the oxidative burst. Under abiotic stresses such as drought or high light-intensity, superoxide production from photosynthetic electron flow is increased. Ascorbate plays a crucial role in symplastic and apoplastic ROS metabolism. Intracellular ascorbate metabolism is highly regulated; it is coupled to glutathione oxidation and reduction and is under tight enzymic control. Export of ascorbate into the apoplast increases during ozoneinduced stress. The apoplast redox state is considered to be more variable than the <b>symplasm.</b> Ascorbate is thought to be taken up from the apoplast in its oxidised form, DHA, via specific carriers, implying tight regulation of apoplastic/symplastic ascorbate transport. An apoplastic ascorbate breakdown pathway has recently been described by Green and Fry (2005). Ascorbate is oxidised and hydrolysed to yield oxalate via two novel intermediates, cyclic oxalyl L-threonate (cyc. ox. thr.) and 4 -O-oxalyl-L-threonate (ox. thr.) A novel esterase is thought to catalyse the hydrolysis of ox. thr. to oxalate. Dehydro-L-ascorbate DHA was also hydrolysed to L- 2, 3 -diketogulonate (DKG) which broke down to two unidentified compounds, C and E. It was not known whether this pathway operated intracellularly and how increased ROS production might affect flux through this pathway. The pathway, described, in the culture medium of 5 -day-old rose cell suspension cultures but had not been investigated in planta. Intracellular and extracellular metabolism of [14 C]ascorbate in [14 C]ascorbate-loaded cells was investigated in response to oxidative stress induced by 0. 1 and 1 mM H 2 O 2 and 1 and 10 μM methyl viologen (MV 2 +). The <b>symplasm</b> became more oxidised in response to 0. 1 mM H 2 O 2; DHA levels increased and ascorbate decreased, but ox. thr. and oxalate, products of irreversible ascorbate breakdown, did not accumulate. Symplastic ox. thr. and oxalate accumulated in response to MV 2 + and 1 mM H 2 O 2. Ox. thr. and oxalate were observed in-planta. Flux through the pathway was increased in transgenic tobacco plants which overexpressed the cell wall-located enzyme ascorbate oxidase, suggesting that the redox state of the apoplast could increase apoplastic ascorbate breakdown via ox. thr. The rate of production of oxalate in vivo compared to in vitro studies suggested that the esterase was located to the <b>symplasm</b> as well as the apoplast. Oxalate did not appear to be metabolised further. Compounds C and E were neither observed in planta nor in 10 -day old rose cell cultures. DKG and cyc. ox. thr. were present only in low levels. Export of 14 C in [14 C]ascorbate loaded cells increased in response to 1 and 5 mM H 2 O 2. Increased export was characterised by a rapid response during the first 2 min of H 2 O 2 exposure. In Arabidopsis and rose cell suspension cultures, export was often observed to occur in series of pulses. The amplitude of pulses increased within the first 2 min of H 2 O 2 exposure. This was not thought to be a result of membrane disruption. 14 C appeared to be exported as [14 C]ascorbate and taken up as [14 C]DHA, with minimal oxidation in the culture medium. These results provide more insight into intracellular ascorbate breakdown via ox. thr. and suggest that oxalate could accumulate in response to oxidative stress in plants. The export of ascorbate/DHA in pulses in response to H 2 O 2 hints at novel mechanisms of regulation of ascorbate/DHA transport across the plasma membrane.

In the present study, the selectivity of this channel was further characterized using single channel current-voltage curves generated using a voltage ramp protocol. This protocol permitted the accurate and unambiguous measurement of the reversal potentials of currents resulting from single channel openings. Using the voltage ramp protocol, it was shown that the OR allows both K + efflux and Ca 2 + influx at potentials positive of EK and negative of E^,.

In all experiments, the accelerated phase of NO 3 − transport had previously been induced by prior exposure to NO 3 − for 10 hours.

Adjustments of leaf area during periods of drought allow {{for the maintenance of}} the water supply and physiological functions of the remain-ing leaves.

Leaf pressure-volume (P-V) curves were determined from samples taken prior to the dry season, to assess how leaves of the different species were adapted to prepare for and endure water defi-cits.

It is proposed that the accumulation of Al in the cell wall exerts a detrimental effect on root growth and function in three ways. First, the decrease in apoplastic sorption of basic cations, which have limited ability to displace bound Al, reduces nutrient acquisition per unit root length. Second, the Al sorbed in the cell wall reduces cell expansion, thus reducing root elongation (a major visible effect of soluble Al). This would also reduce nutrient uptake through decreased root proliferation through the soil. Third, sorption of Al in the cell wall reduces the movement of water and solutes through the apoplasm, directly decreasing nutrient acquisition by the root...|$|E

The addition of 0. 1 mm HgCl 2 to 15 mm KCl reduced Kleaf compared with perfusion in 15 mM KNO 3 or KCl, and these solutions were used for leaves from control, WS and REC plants. Perfusion for 3 h did not significantly alter stomatal conductance (gs) though expression of VvTIP 1; 1 was increased. WS decreased Kleaf by about 30 % and was correlated with gs. The expression of VvTIP 2; 1 and VvPIP 2; 1 correlated with Kleaf, and VvTIP 2; 1 was highly correlated with gs. There was no association between the expression of particular AQPs during WS and REC and inhibition of Kleaf by HgCl 2; however, HgCl 2 treatment itself increased expression of VvPIP 2; 3 and decreased expression of VvPIP 2; 1. Inhibition by HgCl 2 of Kleaf only at early stages of WS and then after REC suggested that apoplasmic pathways become more important during WS. This was confirmed using fluorescent dyes confined to apoplasm or preferentially accumulated in <b>symplasm.</b> Alicia Pou, Hipolito Medrano, Jaume Flexas & Stephen D. Tyerma...|$|E
40|$|Visualization of the {{transport}} pathway in barley (Hordeum vulgare) leaves {{was carried out}} {{using a combination of}} aniline blue and a symplasmically transported fluorochrome, 5, 6 carboxyfluorescein (5, 6 -CF). When applied to a source leaf, basipetal movement of 5, 6 -CF was observed after 3 h and the fluorochrome front was observed about 3 - 4 cm away from the point of application. The fluorochrome was taken up into the <b>symplasm</b> of the mesophyll and was loaded into the bundle sheath cells and then subsequently the vascular parenchyma and finally into the sieve tubes. In sink leaves, acropetal movement was observed after 3 h and the fluorochrome had moved approximately 3 cm away from the point of application. Unloading of 5, 6 -CF occurred from all classes of longitudinal veins. Studies on solute retrieval showed that 5, 6 CF-diacetate was transferred to xylem parenchyma where it was metabolized. 5, 6 -CF was then transferred from the xylem parenchyma to the vascular parenchyma cells, and it would appear that thick-walled sieve tubes were the first to show 5, 6 -CF labeling. Counterstaining with aniline blue demonstrates the presence of plasmodesmata and this suggests a potential symplasmic pathway from the mesophyll to the sieve tubes. Application of 5, 6 CF-diacetate revealed a slow symplasmic pathway, which involved transfer of 5, 6 -CF, which was effected via plasmodesma...|$|E
40|$|Aluminium (Al) is {{the most}} {{abundant}} metal in the earth’s crust, comprising about 7 % of its mass. A large amount of Al is incorporated into aluminosilicate soil minerals and very small quantities appear in the soluble form. Aluminium toxicity {{is one of the}} major factors that limit plant growth and development in many acid soils which differs strikingly in their chemical form. Al has been shown to interfere with cell division in plant roots, decrease root respiration, increase cell wall rigidity and interfere with the uptake and transport of Ca, Mg, K, P and water supply to plants, alter cell-wall Donnan free space, the plasma membrane, membrane transport proteins etc. Al toxicity is mainly associated with severe changes in root morphology, resulting in curved, swollen, cracked, brownish, stubby and stiff root apices. It has been known that plants which exist in the presence of potentially toxic Al concentrations must be able to avoid direct contact of vital structures and metabolic processes with high activities of Al ions. The physiological mechanisms of Al resistance can either be mediated via exclusion of Al from the root apex or via intracellular tolerance of Al transported into the plant <b>symplasm.</b> The approaches like metal uptake and transportation in various plant parts, mechanism behind the interaction with mineral nutrients, specific genes responsible for tolerance levels and kinds of organic and amino acids which act as metal chelator...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} mediating Na+ transport {{in higher}} plant roots were investigated {{by applying the}} patch clamp technique to protoplasts isolated from the cortex and stele of maize roots. In the cortex, permeation of Na+ through a time-dependent K+-selective inward rectifier was negligible. Instead, Na+ influx into maize roots probably occurs via an instantaneously-activating current. This current was partially inhibited by extracellular Ca 2 +, but was insensitive to extracellular TEA(+), Cs+ and TTX. In outside-out patches, a plasma membrane ion channel was found which mediated an inward Na+ current which, at least in part, underlies the whole-cell instantaneously-activating current, the unitary conductance of this channel was 15 pS in 102 : 121 mM Na+ (outside:cytosol). Channel gating was voltage-independent and distinct from that observed for the inwardly rectifying Kf-selective channel in the same cell type. Increasing extracellular Ca 2 + from 0. 1 to 1 mM reduced the open probability and unitary conductance of this channel. In 102 mM a(+) : 123 mM K+ (outside:cytosol) a P-Na: P-K of 2. 1 was calculated. It is suggested that the plasma membrane Na+-permeable channel identified in the cortex of maize roots represents a pathway for low affinity Na+ uptake by intact maize roots. In the stele, permeation of Na+ through outwardly rectifying K+ channels {{was found to be}} negligible and the channels are thus unlikely {{to be involved in the}} transport of Na+ from the root <b>symplasm...</b>|$|E
40|$|Osmotic adjustment, {{defined as}} a {{lowering}} of osmotic potential (ψπ) due to net solute accumulation in response to water stress, has been {{considered to be a}} beneficial drought tolerance mechanism in some crop species. The objective of this experiment was to determine the relative contribution of passive versus active mechanisms involved in diurnal ψπ changes in sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) leaf tissue in response to water stress. A single sorghum hybrid (cv AT× 623 × RT× 430) was grown in the field under variable water supplies. Water potential, ψπ, and relative water content were measured diurnally on expanding and the uppermost fully expanded leaves before flowering and on fully expanded leaves during the grain-filling period. Diurnal changes in total osmotic potential (Δψπ) in response to water stress was 1. 1 megapascals before flowering and 1. 4 megapascals during grain filling in comparison with 0. 53 megapascal under well-watered conditions. Under water-stressed conditions, passive concentration of solutes associated with dehydration accounted for 50 % (0. 55 megapascal) of the diurnal Δψπ before flowering and 47 % (0. 66 megapascal) of the change during grain filling. Net solute accumulation accounted for 42 % (0. 46 megapascal) of the diurnal Δψπ before flowering and 45 % (0. 63 megapascal) of the change during grain filling in water-stressed leaves. The relative contribution of changes in nonosmotic volume (decreased turgid weight/dry weight) to diurnal Δψπ was less than 8 % at either growth stages. Water stress did not affect leaf tissue elasticity or partitioning of water between the <b>symplasm</b> and apoplasm...|$|E

Extrafloral nectary {{anatomy and}} carbon {{metabolism}} of Australian native wild cottons (Gossypium spp.; Malvaceae) [...] Chapter 2. Response of Australian native wild cotton (Gossypium spp.; Malvaceae) extrafloral nectar production and composition to elevate 4 d carbon dioxide. Extrafloral (EF) nectar {{is the foundation}} of many ant-plant interactions worldwide. EF nectar is a resource that encourages ant presence, in turn resulting in protection for plants against herbivores. There is a paucity of research on this relationship and the plant structures that underpin it in Australian species. An examination of the morphology and anatomy of EF nectaries of four Australian cottons (Gossypium spp.) revealed a suberised layer in the nectaries which indicates solutes must travel through the <b>symplasm.</b> ¹⁴CO₂ labelling showed the studied leaves were carbon sources and the EF nectar carbon cost was 1 % of net photosynthates. Any environmental changes that affect EF nectar could have flow-on effects for ecological communities, for example rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO₂) levels. This study tested the response of EF nectar to elevated CO₂; the first investigation of elevated CO₂ impacts on any EF nectar system. The total volume and composition of EF nectar did not change, but there was evidence of accelerated plant development and a change in EF nectar allocation within plants. Developmental changes due to elevated CO₂ could affect the timing of EF nectar production which could have flow-on effects to ant mutualists and the defence of plants.

40|$|The {{identity}} of a linear phase of aluminum (Al) uptake in Triticum aestivum was investigated by analysis of the kinetics of Al uptake by excised roots and purified cell wall fractions. Classical interpretation of kinetic data suggests that a linear phase of uptake with time reflects uptake across the plasma membrane; however, in studies with Al {{the possibility that the}} linear phase of uptake includes accumulation of Al in both the <b>symplasm</b> and the apoplasm has not been discounted. In our experiments, we observed a linear phase of Al uptake at both ambient and low temperatures, although the rate of uptake at 0 °C was 53 to 72 % less than at 23 °C, depending on cultivars. This nonsaturable phase of uptake at low temperature suggests that a portion of the linear phase of Al uptake is nonmetabolic. Furthermore, analysis of Al in cell wall fractions isolated from excised roots pretreated with Al suggests that the linear phase of uptake includes a cell wall component. When excised roots were pretreated with Al, accumulation of Al in purified cell wall material included a linear phase that could not be desorbed with a 30 minute wash in citrate. The rates of linear-phase accumulation of Al by cell wall material and cell contents were similar. In contrast, the linear phase of in vitro uptake of Al by purified cell wall material was completely desorbed by a 30 minute wash with citrate. These results suggest that the linear phase of Al uptake observed in excised roots of T. aestivum included metabolism-dependent binding of Al in apoplasm...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was}} to track the spatial distribution of monolignols during development as they move from <b>symplasm</b> to apoplasm. This was done by feeding [3 H]phenylalanine ([3 H]Phe) to dissected cambium/developing wood from lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var latifolia) seedlings, allowing uptake and metabolism, then rapidly freezing the cells and performing autoradiography to detect the locations of the monolignols responsible for lignification. Parallel experiments showed that radioactivity was incorporated into polymeric lignin and a methanol-soluble pool that was characterized by high-performance liquid chromatography. [3 H]Phe was incorporated into expected lignin precursors, such as coniferyl alcohol and p-coumaryl alcohol, as well as pinoresinol. Coniferin, the glucoside of coniferyl alcohol, was detected by high-performance liquid chromatography but was not radioactively labeled. With light microscopy, radiolabeled phenylpropanoids were detected in the rays as well as the tracheids, with the two cell types showing differential sensitivity to inhibitors of protein translation and phenylpropanoid metabolism. Secondary cell walls of developing tracheids were heavily labeled when incubated with [3 H]Phe. Inside the cell, cytoplasm was most strongly labeled followed by Golgi and low-vacuole label. Inhibitor studies suggest that the Golgi signal could be attributed to protein, rather than phenylpropanoid, origins. These data, produced with the best microscopy tools that are available today, support a model in which unknown membrane transporters, rather than Golgi vesicles, export monolignols...|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} with segments of corn roots to investigate whether nitrate reductase (NR) is compartmentalized in particular groups of cells that collectively form the root symplastic pathway. A microsurgical technique was used to separate cells of the epidermis, of the cortex, and of the stele. The presence of NR was determined using in vitro and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. In roots exposed to 0. 2 millimolar NO 3 − for 20 hours, NR was detected almost exclusively in epidermal cells, even though substantial amounts of NO 3 − likely were being transported through cortical and steler cells during transit to the vascular system. Although NR was present in all cell groups of roots exposed to 20. 0 millimolar NO 3 −, {{the majority of the}} NR still was contained in epidermal cells. The results are consistent with previous observations indicating that limited reduction of endogenous NO 3 − occurs during uptake and reduction of exogenous NO 3 −. Several mechanisms are advanced to account for the restricted capacity of cortical and stelar cells to induce NR and reduce NO 3 −. It is postulated that (a) the biochemical system involved in the induction of NR in the cortex and stele is relatively insensitive to the presence of NO 3 −, (b) the receptor for the NR induction response and the NR protein are associated with cell plasmalemmae and little NO 3 − is taken up by cells of the cortex and stele, and/or (c) NO 3 − is compartmentalized during transport through the <b>symplasm,</b> which limits exposure for induction of NR and NO 3 − reduction...|$|E
