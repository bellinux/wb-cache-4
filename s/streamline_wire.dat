40|$|This note {{contains}} {{the results of}} tests to determine the resistance of four sizes of <b>streamline</b> <b>wire.</b> The investigation was conducted in the six-inch wind tunnel of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics. The tests were made at various velocities and {{it was found that}} the resistance of streamline wires was considerably less than that of round wires of equivalent strength. Scale effect was also found since, with an increase of Reynolds Number, a decrease in the resistance coefficient was obtained...|$|E
40|$|Attempting {{to locate}} a {{malfunctioning}} wire in a complex bundle of wires or in a cable that is concealed behind a wall is as difficult as {{trying to find a}} needle in a haystack. The result of such an effort can also be costly, time-consuming, and frustrating, whether it is the tedious process of examining cable connections for the Space Shuttle or troubleshooting a cable television hookup. Furthermore, other maintenance restrictions can compound the effort required {{to locate a}}nd repair a particular wiring problem. For example, on the Space Shuttle, once a repair is completed, all systems that have a wire passing through any of the connectors that were disconnected during troubleshooting are affected and, therefore, must undergo retesting, an arduous task that is completely unrelated to the original problem. In an effort to <b>streamline</b> <b>wire</b> inspection and maintenance, two contractors supporting NASA's Kennedy Space Center invented the Standing Wave Reflectometer (SWR) in 1999. In doing so, they leveraged technology that was first developed to detect problems that could lead to aircraft accidents, such as the one that resulted in the catastrophic failure of TWA flight 800 in 1996. The SWR performs a non-intrusive inspection that verifies the condition of electrical power and signal-distribution systems inside the Space Shuttle orbiters. Such testing reduces processing delays and ensures safe operation of these systems...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of wind tunnel tests on four elliptic cylinders with various fineness ratios, conducted in the Navy Aerodynamic Laboratory, Washington. The object of the tests was to investigate the characteristics of sections suitable for <b>streamline</b> <b>wire</b> which normally has an elliptic section with a fineness ratio of 4. 0; also to learn whether a reduction in fineness ratio would result in improvement; also to determine the pressure distribution on the model of fineness ratio of 4. Four elliptic cylinders with fineness ratios of 2. 5, 3. 0, 3. 5, and 4. 0 were made and then tested in the 8 by 8 wind tunnel; first, for cross-wind force, drag, and yawing moment at 30 miles an hour and various angles of yaw; next for drag 0 degree pitch and 0 degree yaw and various wind speeds; then for end effect on the smallest and largest models; and lastly for pressure distribution over the surface of the largest model at 0 degree pitch and 0 degree yaw and various wind speeds. In all tests, the length of the model was transverse to the current. The results are given for standard air density, p =. 002378 slug per cubic foot. This account is a slight revised form of report no. 315. A summary of conclusions is given {{at the end of the}} text. (author) ...|$|E
40|$|Preliminary {{results are}} given of drag tests of <b>streamline</b> <b>wires.</b> Full-size wires were tested {{over a wide}} range of speeds in the N. A. C. A. high speed tunnel. The results are thus {{directly}} applicable to full-scale problems and include any compressibility effects encountered at the higher speeds. The results show how protuberances may be employed on conventional <b>streamline</b> <b>wires</b> to reduce the drag, and also show how the conventional wires compare with others having sections more like strut or symmetrical airfoil sections. Because the new wire sections developed are markedly superior aerodynamically to conventional wires, it is recommended that some of them be tested in service in order to investigate their relative susceptibility to vibration and to fatigue failure...|$|R
50|$|The two-seat B-4 trainer was a mid-wing {{monoplane}} {{with wings}} of rectangular plan out to blunted tips. Structurally, the largely wooden wings {{were based on}} pairs of box spars and spruce and plywood ribs, with duralumin sheet stiffening the leading edges. The rest of the wing was fabric covered. They were wire-braced from above and below with <b>streamlined</b> <b>wires</b> from pylons within the fuselage to the spars. Its Frise ailerons were inset.|$|R
50|$|The RE {{series is}} more refined aerodynamically than earlier models; the wings are fully plywood-skinned, {{and instead of}} a bulky {{compression}} strut carrying lift loads, a more conventional set of <b>streamlined</b> flying <b>wires</b> completes the wing structure. It has the fastest cruise speed {{of any of the}} Waco cabin models, with a Vne of 270 mph.|$|R
50|$|In June 1918, the Sopwith Aviation Company flew {{an unarmed}} parasol {{monoplane}} derivative of the Sopwith Camel, the Sopwith Monoplane No. 1, {{also known as}} the Sopwith Scooter. It used a normal Camel fuselage, with the wing mounted just above the fuselage, with a very small gap. The wing was braced using RAF-wire (<b>streamlined</b> bracing <b>wires)</b> to a pyramid shaped cabane above the wing. It was powered by a single 130 hp (97 kW) Clerget 9B rotary engine.|$|R
25|$|The DH.6 was {{specifically}} {{designed as a}} military trainer, {{at a time when}} it was usual for obsolete service types to be used in this role. Geoffrey de Havilland seems to have had two design criteria in mind. The first was that it should be inexpensive and easy to build, and above all, simple to repair after the mishaps common in training units. The top and bottom wings were square-cut and interchangeable, hence roundels often located in unusual positions. They were heavily cambered, and braced with cables rather than <b>streamlined</b> <b>wires.</b> On the original version of the type there was no stagger. Even the fin and rudder, on the prototype of the usual curved de Havilland outline, were cut square on production machines. The fuselage structure was a straight box with no attempt at refinement of outline â€“ instructor and pupil sat in tandem on basketwork seats in a single cockpit, spartan even by the standards of the time. The standard engine was the readily-available 90hp (67kW) RAF 1a. Because of its use in the B.E.2 the engine was familiar to RFC mechanics. No cowling was used, and upswept straight exhaust pipes were fitted. When stocks of the RAF 1a ran short, other engines were fitted, including the 80hp (60kW) Renault.|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of wireless transmissions into the da-ta center {{has been shown}} to be promising in improving the performance of data center networks (DCN) cost ef-fectively. For high transmission flexibility and perfor-mance, a fundamental challenge is to increase the wire-less availability and enable fully hybrid and seamless transmissions over both wired and wireless DCN com-ponents. Rather than limiting the number of wireless ra-dios by the size of top-of-rack (ToR) switches, we pro-pose a novel DCN architecture, Diamond, which nests the wired DCN with radios equipped on all servers. To harvest the gain allowed by the rich reconfigurable wire-less resources, we propose the low-cost deployment of scalable 3 D Ring Reflection Spaces (RRSs) which are in-terconnected with <b>streamlined</b> <b>wired</b> herringbone to en-able large number of concurrent wireless transmissions through high-performance multi-reflection of radio sig-nals over metal. To increase the number of concurrent wireless transmissions within each RRS, we propose a precise reflection method to reduce the wireless interfer-ence. We build a 60 GHz-based testbed to demonstrate the function and transmission ability of our proposed ar-chitecture. We further perform extensive simulations to show the significant performance gain of Diamond, in supporting up to five times higher server-to-server capac-ity, enabling network-wide load balancing, and ensuring high fault tolerance. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{is focused}} on <b>streamlining</b> production on <b>wire</b> electric discharge machine during cutting metal alloys, specifically low-alloy steel quality by CSN 41 4220. The first part contains {{a study of the}} current and modern technologies EDM wire cutting. The second part {{is focused on}} identifying key parameters to influence the WEDM process, a detailed analysis of the machined surfaces of samples and wire electrodes used for cutting. The result of this work was to explore the possibility, whether by performing planned experiment and subsequent evaluation in the future to determine exactly setting the key parameters influencing the process of WEDM...|$|R
2500|$|In April 1914, the S.E.2 {{was again}} rebuilt, this time under the {{supervision}} of Henry Folland, as de Havilland had left the Royal Aircraft Factory to become chief designer of Airco (the B.S.1/S.E.2 was the last design de Havilland produced for the Factory). The tail surfaces were again revised, with a larger fin and rudder, with new tailplane and elevators. [...] The monocoque rear fuselage, which had been criticised as too expensive for mass production, was replaced by a conventional wood and fabric structure. Better streamlined struts were fitted, as well as <b>streamline</b> sectioned bracing <b>wires</b> (Raf-wires). [...] It was first flown in this form on 3 October 1914. This modified version {{is often referred to as}} the [...] "S.E.2a" [...] - this designation was not used at the time, and was probably not official.|$|R
