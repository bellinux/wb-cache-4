5|$|Though {{metallic}} sodium has some important uses, the major applications for sodium use compounds; millions {{of tons of}} <b>sodium</b> <b>chloride,</b> hydroxide, and carbonate are produced annually. <b>Sodium</b> <b>chloride</b> is extensively used for anti-icing and de-icing and as a preservative; sodium bicarbonate is mainly used for cooking. Along with potassium, many important medicines have sodium added to improve their bioavailability; though potassium is the better ion in most cases, sodium is chosen for its lower price and atomic weight. Sodium hydride is used as a base for various reactions (such as the aldol reaction) in organic chemistry, and as a reducing agent in inorganic chemistry.|$|E

5|$|In humans, sodium is an {{essential}} mineral that regulates blood volume, blood pressure, osmotic equilibrium and pH; the minimum physiological requirement for sodium is 500 milligrams per day. <b>Sodium</b> <b>chloride</b> is the principal source of sodium in the diet, and is used as seasoning and preservative in such commodities as pickled preserves and jerky; for Americans, most <b>sodium</b> <b>chloride</b> comes from processed foods. Other sources of sodium are its natural occurrence in food and such food additives as monosodium glutamate (MSG), sodium nitrite, sodium saccharin, baking soda (sodium bicarbonate), and sodium benzoate. The US Institute of Medicine set its Tolerable Upper Intake Level for sodium at 2.3grams per day, but the average person in the United States consumes 3.4grams per day. Studies have found that lowering sodium intake by 2g per day tends to lower systolic blood pressure by about two to four mmHg.

40|$|International audienceVariations in <b>sodium</b> and <b>chloride</b> in {{atmospheric}} inputs (rainfall and mist), stream runoff {{and groundwater}} stores are documented {{for the upper}} Severn River (Afon Hafren and Afon Hore catchments), Plynlimon, mid-Wales. The results show five salient features. <b>Sodium</b> and <b>chloride</b> concentrations are highly variable and highly correlated in rainfall and mist. The sodium-chloride relationship in rainfall has a slope close to the sodium/chloride ratio in sea-water, and an intercept that is {{not significantly different from}} zero. This indicates that sea-salt is the dominant source of both <b>sodium</b> and <b>chloride</b> in rainfall, which would be expected given the maritime nature of the metrology. For mist, there is also a straight line with near-zero intercept, but with a slightly higher gradient than the sea-salt ratio, presumably due to small additional sodium inputs from other sources. There is an approximate input-output balance for both <b>sodium</b> and <b>chloride,</b> {{with the exception of one}} groundwater well, in which high chemical weathering results in an anomalous high Na/Cl ratio. Thus, atmospheric deposition is the dominant source of both <b>sodium</b> and <b>chloride</b> in groundwater and streamflow. The fluctuations in <b>sodium</b> and <b>chloride</b> concentrations in the streams and groundwaters are strongly damped compared to those in the rain and the mist, reflecting the storage and mixing of waters in the subsurface. On all timescales, from weeks to years, sodium fluctuations are more strongly damped than chloride fluctuations in streamflow. The additional damping of sodium is consistent with ion exchange buffering of sodium in the catchment soils. <b>Sodium</b> and <b>chloride</b> concentrations are linearly correlated in the streams and groundwaters, but the slope is almost universally less than the sea-salt ratio and there is a non-zero intercept. The Na/Cl ratio in streamflow and groundwater is higher than the sea-salt ratio when salinity is low and lower than the sea-salt ratio when salinity is high. This pattern of behaviour is again consistent with ion exchange buffering of sodium in the catchment soils. The core features of this study are two fold. Firstly, <b>sodium</b> and <b>chloride</b> concentrations are highly damped within the streams and groundwaters relative to the atmospheric input. Secondly, streamflow <b>sodium</b> and <b>chloride</b> respond in similar ways across the catchments, except for the added cation exchange damping of the sodium signal.

5|$|Sodium is now {{produced}} commercially {{through the}} electrolysis of molten <b>sodium</b> <b>chloride,</b> {{based on a}} process patented in 1924. This is done in a Downs cell in which the NaCl is mixed with calcium chloride to lower the melting point below 700°C.

This method is less expensive than the previous Castner process (the electrolysis of sodium hydroxide).|$|E

40|$|It is {{currently}} {{believed that the}} rate and direction of sodium transport in the small intestine may be regulated by the activity of Na,K-ATPase in the basolateral cell membrane. We tested this hypothesis by selectively infusing ouabain, a known inhibitor of Na,K-ATPase, into the mesenteric artery supplying a perfused loop of ileum in 18 dogs. Before ouabain infusion there were significant correlations between the activity of Na,K-ATPase and net and lumen to plasma fluxes of <b>sodium</b> and <b>chloride.</b> After ouabain, {{there was no significant}} change in <b>sodium</b> and <b>chloride</b> transport, unidirectional fluxes or transmucosal potential difference, despite a 50 % reduction in Na,K-ATPase activity. Furthermore, there was no significant correlation between Na,K-ATPase activity and <b>sodium</b> or <b>chloride</b> transport after ouabain. The only statistically significant effect of ouabain infusion was a reduction in the rate of bicarbonate secretion. Thus, the results of our experiments suggest that mucosal Na,K-ATPase is not a rate-limiting step in the absorption of <b>sodium</b> and <b>chloride</b> in the dog ileum, though it may be an important facilitative factor...|$|R

5|$|Because it {{was used}} in glassmaking, {{manganese}} dioxide was available for experiments by alchemists, the first chemists.

By the mid-18th century, the Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele used manganese dioxide to produce chlorine. First, hydrochloric acid, or a mixture of dilute sulfuric acid and <b>sodium</b> <b>chloride</b> was made to react with manganese dioxide, later hydrochloric acid from the Leblanc process was used and the manganese dioxide was recycled by the Weldon process. The production of chlorine and hypochlorite bleaching agents was a large consumer of manganese ores.|$|E

40|$|From {{the data}} given above the {{following}} {{explanation of the}} effects of continued loss of the external secretion of the pancreas may be offered. The underlying event is a steadily increasing deficit of <b>sodium</b> and of <b>chloride</b> ion due to the large requirement for these electrolytes in the construction of pancreatic juice. In consequence there is continued loss of water, chiefly from the body fluids in which <b>sodium</b> and <b>chloride</b> ion are large factors of total ionic content, viz., interstitial fluids and the blood plasma. During about two-thirds of the survival period the volume and composition of the blood plasma remain approximately normal, the losses of water, <b>sodium,</b> and <b>chloride</b> ion being replaced at the expense of interstitial fluids. Reduction of the volume of these fluids is indicated by loss of body weight beginning directly after establishment of the pancreatic fistula. Ultimately reduction of plasma volume begins and, as it progresses, serious symptoms develop and death occurs unless water, <b>sodium,</b> and <b>chloride</b> ion are abundantly replaced. Owing to the relatively greater loss of <b>sodium</b> than of <b>chloride</b> ion in pancreatic juice, reduction of bicarbonate ion concentration in the plasma tends to occur. The death of the organism may be simply and reasonably explained as the result of progressive impairment of the function of the blood by the physical changes, dehydration and acidosis, produced in the plasma by the continued loss of <b>sodium</b> and of <b>chloride</b> ion in the pancreatic juice...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} {{determine the influence of}} dietary <b>sodium</b> and <b>chloride</b> on eggshell quality of leghorn hens.

Neither chloride nor calcium significantly affected hen-day egg production or egg weight (P>. 05); however, chloride decreased feed consumption and calcium increased body weight gain (P. 05). The effect of dietary <b>sodium</b> and <b>chloride</b> on eggshells of hens receiving 2. 0 % dietary calcium was determined in a second experiment.
