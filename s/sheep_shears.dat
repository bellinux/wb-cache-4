50|$|Burgon & Ball {{is an old}} Sheffield firm which {{originally}} made shears, {{scissors and}} knives. Its Sheffield origins date back to 1730; they moved to the La Plata Works on Holme Lane in Malin Bridge in 1873. The works were built {{on the site of}} a cutlery grinding wheel, which had existed since the 1690s, on land cleared after the 1864 flood. The works stand {{on the banks of the}} River Loxley and the river provided much of the power for the works throughout the 1900s. In the latter part of the 19th century the company patented a design for hand <b>sheep</b> <b>shears</b> and in one year sold over 300,000 pairs of shears. By 1920 the firm was producing more garden shears than <b>sheep</b> <b>shears</b> and it has continued to diversify into garden tools over the years. There is still a market for hand <b>sheep</b> <b>shears</b> and the company is now the only British manufacturer.|$|E

Muecke and Shoemaker say that between ‘1910 and 1944 he made ten ... applications for inventions as varied as an anti-gravitational device, a multi-radial wheel and a sheep-shearing handpiece’. [...] Provisional patent 15,624 which he ratified in 1910, is for an [...] "Improved mechanical motion device" [...] - that converted rotary motion which [...] "is applied, as for instance by an Eccentric", into tangential reciprocating movement, an example application given being <b>sheep</b> <b>shears.</b> The invention, the basis of modern mechanical <b>sheep</b> <b>shears,</b> was introduced without Unaipon receiving any financial return and, apart from a 1910 newspaper report acknowledging him as the inventor, he received no contemporary credit.|$|E
50|$|Austin {{continued}} {{to be involved with}} the Wolseley <b>Sheep</b> <b>Shearing</b> Machine Company Limited and its <b>sheep</b> <b>shearing</b> machines and other agricultural equipment. He was Chairman of the Board from 1911 to 1933 when he was approaching 70.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sheep</b> <b>shearing</b> {{and wool}} {{handling}} competitions are held regularly {{in parts of}} the world, particularly Ireland, the UK, South Africa, New Zealand and Australia.

30|$|Possibly {{originating}} in the Mesolithic period (Nandriş 1985; Arnold and Greenfield 2006) and once practised across Europe, these seasonal livestock movements are technically known as transhumance. Evidence {{for the existence of}} shepherding during the Dacian period (c. 500 BC to 106  AD) comes with the find of a pair of <b>sheep</b> <b>shears</b> in the Cindrel range of the southern Carpathians, and the ancient Romans rented land to shepherds in the same area (Grecu 1990, p. 141). Totoianu (2010) considers that long-distance transhumance in what is now Romania could not have begun before the fourteenth century. Documents relating to the transhumance of ‘Vlach’ (in other words, Transylvanian) flocks from the southern Carpathians to the Beskid Mountains of Moravia and Poland show that that particular route was well known in the fourteenth century. This suggests {{that it could have been}} in use a lot longer (Carpathian Sheep Transhumance 2013, personal communications).|$|E
40|$|What did <b>sheep</b> <b>shears</b> in the 1 st {{millennium}} BC Babylonia look like? We are not sure. Many cuneiform texts {{were written}} about textile work in Babylonia, {{but it was}} largely about administration or accounting. There were hardly any descriptions of the actual tools and processes. In this article we go back over the words, the iconography, and the archaeology {{in an attempt to}} find these missing descriptions. This study is limited to Babylonia during the 1 st millennium BC, and this period correspond to a state of the Akkadian language, called Neo-Babylonian. At these times, major evolution took place. Mesopotamia entered in the Iron Age {{at the end of the}} 2 nd millennium BC. Empires were built (Neo-Assyrian 911 - 610 BC, Neo-Babylonian 610 - 539 BC BC, Achaemenid 539 - 330 and Hellenistic 330 - 64 BC). Most of the cuneiform documentation of that period discovered by the archaeological excavations is dated from the “long 6 th century BC”. 2 At these times, Babylonia enjoyed an economic growth, longdistance trade developed, and the temples has an important economic weight. 3 All these factors induce changes in the textile craft that are visible through an analysis of the vocabulary. Textile tools were objects of everyday life, they were handled manually to transform the raw materials into finished woven products. They included all the implements used at different stages of fibre preparation, spinning, and weaving, as well as dyeing, washing, decorating and the repair of fabrics. An approach that combines the study of vocabulary of tools with the study of action verbs related to textile manufacturing can bring information about the techniques known in 1 st millennium BC. In Babylonia, during the 1 st millennium BC, the textile craft was well-developed. Textiles were widely used in transportation, in home furnishing as well as for clothing. Common domestic production and luxury production both existed with the former being much less documented than the latter. Luxury production was organized by the temples, and probably also by the palaces. 4 Wool was the most commonly used raw material. 5 Flax was rare but present, and cotton appeared at these times in Babylonia. 6 Special products like Egyptian flax, purple wool or special dyes, especially destined for luxury production, were imported through long distance trade. 7 Manufacturing techniques were complex: the luxury textiles were adorned with metal appliqué, tassels, and embroidery. 8 The vocabulary of tools and action verbs dealing with textile production gives some information about the different tasks accomplished by the textile craftsmen, and about the techniques they mastered. Important works about textile tools in Mesopotamia include the book by Catherine Breniquet Essai sur le tissage en Mesopotamie and the articles by Eva Andersson Strand, Agnete Wisti Lassen, and Caroline Sauvage. 9 Using the context of these previous works supported by the Neo-Babylonian documentation, the question is how studying tool terminology and action verbs can improve our understanding of the function of the textile production in 1 st-millennium BC Mesopotamia. Does textile terminology reveal evolutions at this late period of Mesopotamian history...|$|E
