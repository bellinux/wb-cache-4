The species of this zooplankton eaten by blue whales varies from ocean to ocean. In the North Atlantic, Meganyctiphanes norvegica, Thysanoessa raschii, Thysanoessa inermis and Thysanoessa longicaudata are the usual food; in the North Pacific, Euphausia pacifica, Thysanoessa inermis, Thysanoessa longipes, Thysanoessa spinifera, Nyctiphanes symplex and Nematoscelis megalops; and in the Southern Hemisphere, Euphausia superba, Euphausia crystallorophias, Euphausia valentini, and Nyctiphanes australis.|$|E

5|$|Electron-beam {{lithography}} (EBL) is {{a method}} of etching semiconductors at resolutions smaller than a micrometer. This technique is limited by high costs, slow performance, the need to operate the beam in the vacuum and the tendency of the electrons to scatter in solids. The last problem limits the resolution to about 10nm. For this reason, EBL is primarily used {{for the production of}} <b>small</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> specialized integrated circuits.|$|E
5|$|In {{the tail}} end of the 1990s, due to the parts being discontinued, the 3/5 had {{technically}} reached the end of the road. Some licensees continued to make <b>small</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> speakers, for a while, using re-manufactured parts. However, Stirling Broadcast, one of the last batch of licensees, completely redesigned the product based on the audio signature of the original, and launched the LS3/5A v2 with the full endorsement of the broadcaster in early 2006.|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} the {{majority}} of information is contained in the <b>small</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> linear combinations of the measured voltages. Therefore, a <b>small</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> synthetic beams, perhaps an order of magnitude <b>smaller</b> than the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> physical feeds, can be used for imaging and calibration. From the other side, only a <b>small</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> gains can be calibrated using the full-beam self-calibration approach. An algorithm to compute the beamformer weights for an optimal calibration has been described. ...|$|R

5|$|Optimally, the speedup from parallelization {{would be}} linear—doubling {{the number of}} {{processing}} elements should halve the runtime, and doubling it a second time should again halve the runtime. However, very few parallel algorithms achieve optimal speedup. Most {{of them have a}} near-linear speedup for <b>small</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> processing elements, which flattens out into a constant value for large numbers of processing elements.|$|E
5|$|Organised armed fighters {{on horseback}} are {{occasionally}} seen. The best-known current examples are the Janjaweed, militia groups {{seen in the}} Darfur region of Sudan, who became notorious for their attacks upon unarmed civilian populations in the Darfur conflict.

5|$|Since {{the late}} 1980s, the Government has {{increasingly}} called upon the ADF to contribute forces to peacekeeping missions around the world. While {{most of these}} deployments involved only <b>small</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> specialists, several led to the deployment of hundreds of personnel. Large peacekeeping deployments were made to Namibia in early 1989, Cambodia between 1992 and 1993, Somalia in 1993, Rwanda between 1994 and 1995 and Bougainville in 1994 and from 1997 onwards.|$|E
5|$|<b>Small</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> Dall's {{porpoises}} {{have been}} kept in captivity in both the United States and Japan. However, these animals consistently failed to thrive. Captive P. dalli repeatedly ran into the walls of their enclosures, refused food, and exhibited skin sloughing. All Dall's porpoises introduced to aquaria died shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|The corn crake {{is a long}} {{distance}} migrant, breeding across temperate Eurasia from the British Isles east to central Siberia and western China.

The report found that the refugees had struggled to gain employment and English language skills. Another evaluation report undertaken for the Home Office and published in 2011 also found that only <b>small</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> resettled refugees were in paid employment, noting that many were still more concerned about meeting their basic needs.|$|E
5|$|American {{planners}} {{believed that}} the Hadong area was under attack from elements of the North Korean 4th Infantry Division, having just received replacements following its victory at Taejon. However, the soldiers in the area were actually from the North Korean 6th Infantry Division {{under the command of}} General Pang Ho San. The two divisions were coordinating to envelop the UN's left flank and were extremely spread out. Therefore, only groups of a few hundred were advancing through the region, some with <b>small</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> tanks.|$|E

5|$|Augmentation {{involves}} the supplemental release of natural enemies {{that occur in}} a particular area, boosting the naturally occurring populations there. In inoculative release, <b>small</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> the control agents are released at intervals {{to allow them to}} reproduce, in the hope of setting up longer-term control, and thus keeping the pest down to a low level, constituting prevention rather than cure. In inundative release, in contrast, large numbers are released in the hope of rapidly reducing a damaging pest population, correcting a problem that has already arisen. Augmentation can be effective, but is not guaranteed to work, and depends on the precise details of the interactions between each pest and control agent.|$|E
