2500|$|No Isis album {{contains}} an explicit , or story arc, instead focusing on themes rather than stories. As such, releases {{are defined by}} some as [...] "pseudo-concept albums". The band see lyrics as important, {{but at the same}} time, Turner does not feel it necessary to enunciate every word. Instead, any connections made are mainly conjecture, and the formation of a theme takes into account the album artwork, previous albums, track titles and the use of metaphor just as much as lyricism. Oceanic tells a convoluted tale involving love, incest and suicide by drowning. This relates to the theme of the all-powerful female, present lyrically in every album except Panopticon. Turner does not explicitly acknowledge an [...] "overtly feminine theme"; however, he does state: [...] "I just think it's interesting to include that as part of what we do, simply because metal, especially, is considered to be this very male-oriented, testosterone-driven art form, and I feel like it's important to recognize the other side of our nature. As manly as we might or might not be, we have to acknowledge that there is a feminine part of our persona, and that the world isn't made up of absolutes. To achieve balance, you have to recognize every facet of yourself and everyone else around you." [...] Certain threads do reappear between albums, notes Turner. [...] "There are certain themes which reoccur in my work just because of what I'm interested in and what is aesthetically pleasing for me", he says. [...] "The idea of futuristic utopias and dystopias is probably something that does consciously and subconsciously return time and time again [...] and <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> can't help the fact that these themes creep into my work whether it's conscious or not". The other two ongoing motifs in the lyrics and artwork are that of towers and mosquitos.|$|E

In October 2009 he made some scathing comments about the federal minister Josée Verner.

While he attended Saints and Scholars Integrated Primary School, Morgan's teacher Harry McGee became a tremendous inspiration to him; according to Morgan, [...] "McGee would stay behind after class each day and he'd pull out a poem and he'd say, 'Let’s work on this,' and we'd just do it. He really believed in me and really fueled my passion. And that’s all it takes <b>sometimes,</b> <b>I</b> think, <b>just</b> one person to believe in you." ...|$|R

The EP was released through the iTunes Store in September, and in November was published on CD, LP and MP3.

[...] "Love Letters" [...] and [...] "Weak in the Presence of Beauty" [...] - neither song I enjoy now - they're both my fault. I found them.

5000|$|To {{continue}} developing {{his second}} solo album, Cantrell enlisted drummer Mike Bordin and bassist Robert Trujillo of Ozzy Osbourne. The choice would deliberately refrain Cantrell from his Alice in Chains band mates and therefore distinguish his solo career from his past. He originally booked studio time with Dave Jerden, who produced Alice in Chains' first two albums; however, Cantrell fired him after two days, claiming [...] "It {{was just not}} working out personally[...] [...] Mike and Robert had hooked up with me and we had been through rehearsals, and {{we got into the}} studio with Dave and it all blew up on us on the second day.
