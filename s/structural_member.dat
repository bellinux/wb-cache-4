5|$|To {{produce the}} 767, Boeing formed {{a network of}} {{subcontractors}} which included domestic suppliers and international contributions from Italy's Aeritalia and Japan's CTDC. The wings and cabin floor were produced in-house, while Aeritalia provided control surfaces, Boeing Vertol made the leading edge for the wings, and Boeing Wichita produced the forward fuselage. The CTDC provided multiple assemblies through its constituent companies, namely Fuji Heavy Industries (wing fairings and gear doors), Kawasaki Heavy Industries (center fuselage), and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (rear fuselage, doors, and tail). Components were integrated during final assembly at the Everett factory. For expedited production of wing spars, the main <b>structural</b> <b>member</b> of aircraft wings, the Everett factory received robotic machinery to automate the process of drilling holes and inserting fasteners. This method of wing construction expanded on techniques developed for the 747. Final assembly of the first aircraft began in July 1979.|$|E
25|$|The Hawk wing is strut-braced, {{constructed}} from aluminum tubing {{and covered with}} either pre-sewn Dacron envelopes or doped aircraft fabric. The wing also features flaps. The fuselage is of similar construction and uses a curved boom tube for its main <b>structural</b> <b>member.</b> The curved tube allows the tail to be located higher, out of the wing's downwash, especially when the flaps are extended. Landing gear for all models is optionally tricycle or conventional.|$|E
25|$|Ribbed vaults {{came into}} general {{use in the}} 12th century. In ribbed vaults, not only are there ribs {{spanning}} the vaulted area transversely, but each vaulted bay has diagonal ribs, following the same course as the groins in a groin vault. However, whereas in a groin vault, the vault itself is the <b>structural</b> <b>member,</b> in a ribbed vault, it is the ribs that are the structural members, and the spaces between them can be filled with lighter, non-structural material.|$|E

An improved structural system achieves the desired composite behavior by providing one or more <b>structural</b> <b>members,</b> plates coupled with the <b>structural</b> <b>members,</b> transverse reinforcing members passing through apertures in the plates, and additional reinforcing members positioned parallel and transverse to the <b>structural</b> <b>members</b> to provide an interlocking composite action between the <b>structural</b> <b>members,</b> reinforcing members, and concrete...|$|R
40|$|Pressure impulse (PI) {{diagrams}} have widely {{been used}} for preliminary design of structural numbers against blast loads. Considerable {{research has been conducted}} to derive PI diagrams for flexure modes of <b>structural</b> <b>members</b> using single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) systems. However, little research has been done for derivation of PI diagrams for <b>structural</b> <b>members</b> against shear failure. In this SDOF theory is used to investigate the shear response of elastic <b>structural</b> <b>members</b> under external loads. Theoretical solutions of shear response of elastic <b>structural</b> <b>members</b> resulted from the external explosions are derived using the SDOF approach. These solutions are then used to generate a family of P-I curves based on the shear resistance capability of the <b>structural</b> <b>members</b> to withstand the explosions. Pressure-impulse diagrams are also generated to distinguish the failure of the RC slab dominated by the directs shear or flexure force. J. Xu and C. W...|$|R

25|$|The one-room {{interior}} of the Charles Sweeney Cabin has a loft accessible in the northwest corner by a dog-leg stairway. The stairway has many of its original balusters. It also has original trim on the stringers, the <b>structural</b> <b>member</b> of the stairway that supports the treads and risers. The square newel and rail are formed from one piece of an oak branch. There is a small closet under the staircase that has its original four-paneled door with concave, quarter-circle corners on the raised panels.|$|E
25|$|Groin vaults {{occur in}} early Romanesque buildings, notably at Speyer Cathedral where the high vault of about 1060 {{is the first}} {{employment}} in Romanesque architecture {{of this type of}} vault for a wide nave. In later buildings employing ribbed vaultings, groin vaults are most frequently used for the less visible and smaller vaults, particularly in crypts and aisles. A groin vault is almost always square in plan and is constructed of two barrel vaults intersecting at right angles. Unlike a ribbed vault, the entire arch is a <b>structural</b> <b>member.</b> Groin vaults are frequently separated by transverse arched ribs of low profile as at Speyer and Santiago de Compostela. At Sainte Marie Madeleine, Vézelay, the ribs are square in section, strongly projecting and polychrome.|$|E
25|$|When a {{structure}} {{is subjected to}} compressive stress, buckling may occur. Buckling {{is characterized by a}} sudden sideways deflection of a <b>structural</b> <b>member.</b> This may occur even though the stresses that develop in the structure are well below those needed to cause failure of the material of which the structure is composed. As an applied load is increased on a member, such as a column, it will ultimately become large enough to cause the member to become unstable and it is said to have buckled. Further loading will cause significant and somewhat unpredictable deformations, possibly leading to complete loss of the member's load-carrying capacity. If the deformations that occur after buckling do not cause the complete collapse of that member, the member will continue to support the load that caused it to buckle. If the buckled member {{is part of a larger}} assemblage of components such as a building, any load applied to the buckled part of the structure beyond that which caused the member to buckle will be redistributed within the structure.|$|E

25|$|The French Nieuport 11 {{and later}} on, the Nieuport 17 and the British Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5 aircraft, the Lewis was mounted above the top wing, {{sometimes}} on a Foster mount, which allowed firing directly forward outside the propeller arc. The Foster mount usually incorporated an arc-shaped I-beam rail as its rearmost <b>structural</b> <b>member,</b> that a Lewis gun could be slid backwards and downwards along the rail towards the cockpit, {{to allow the}} ammunition drum to be changed in flight — but fighter ace Albert Ball V.C. also understood that the Lewis gun in such a mount also retained its original trigger, and could thus be fired upwards. He used the upward firing Lewis to attack solitary German two-seater aircraft from below and behind, where the observer could not see him or fire back. It was {{his use of the}} weapon in this way, in a Nieuport, that led to its later introduction on the S.E.5/S.E.5a. Ball had acted in a consultant capacity on the development of this aeroplane. The later Sopwith Dolphin, already armed with twin synchronized Vickers guns just forward of the pilot and just above its V-8 engine, could also use one or two Lewis guns mounted on the forward crossbar of its cabane structure, between the top wing panels, as an anti-Zeppelin measure.|$|E

40|$|The reuse system {{proposed}} by the authors is one method to reduce the environmental burden in the structural field.

2500|$|A {{structural}} keel is the bottom-most <b>structural</b> <b>member</b> {{around which}} the hull of a ship is built. The keel runs along the centerline of the ship, from the bow to the stern. [...] The keel is often {{the first part of}} a ship's hull to be constructed, and laying the keel, or placing the keel in the cradle in which the ship will be built may mark the start time of its construction. Large, modern ships are now often built in a series of pre-fabricated, complete hull sections rather than being built around a single keel, so shipbuilding process commences with cutting the first sheet of steel.|$|E
2500|$|Cristofori's pianos use an {{internal}} frame member (bentside) {{to support the}} soundboard; in other words, the <b>structural</b> <b>member</b> attaching {{the right side of}} the soundboard is distinct from the external case that bears the tension of the strings. This system was also applied by Cristofori to harpsichords. The use of a separate support for the soundboard reflects Cristofori's belief that the soundboard should not be subjected to compression from string tension. This may improve the sound, and also avoids the peril of warping—as harpsichord makers Kerstin Schwarz and Tony Chinnery point out , , a severely warped soundboard threatens a structural catastrophe, namely contact between strings and soundboard. Cristofori's principle continues to be applied in modern pianos, where the now-enormous string tension (up to 20 tons) is borne by a separate iron frame (the [...] "plate").|$|E
2500|$|The C4 {{represented}} a clean {{break from the}} previous generation of Corvette with a completely new chassis and modern, sleeker styling. Since emissions regulations were still changing and electronic engine management was in its infancy, horsepower was, compared to earlier generations, low. Therefore, the primary design emphasis, {{at least for the}} launch, was on handling and braking, with all-independent suspension with light-weight suspension and wheels, and all new brakes with aluminum calipers. The front suspension saw the C3's coil springs replaced by a transverse fiberglass mono-leaf spring, which was only 1/3 of the weight of the coil springs while also introducing an anti-roll bar-like effect on the front. The price of this no-holds-barred emphasis on handling was ride comfort, especially with the Z51 performance and handling package. The C4 did not use separate body-on-frame construction like its predecessors. [...] Instead, it used what GM termed a [...] "uniframe", which consisted of a traditional perimeter frame, with the door posts, windshield frame, halo, and the rear portion of the floor pan integrated into one welded assembly. [...] This was not a [...] unibody assembly, as none of the exterior body panels were structural members. [...] Due to a styling decision to use a targa top instead of T-tops, there was no <b>structural</b> <b>member</b> tying the windshield frame to the halo as on the C3. [...] This required extremely tall side rails on the frame to maintain chassis rigidity, and as a result, the door sills were quite deep, with entry and exit likened by contemporary auto journals to a [...] "fall in and climb out" [...] experience. [...] The targa top bolted into place, becoming a structural component, rather than simply latching on like T-tops. [...] Despite the tall frame rails, the C4 was prone to rattles and squeaks, especially with the targa top removed. [...] The emergency brake, located between the door sill and the drivers seat, was moved lower and toward the rear of the car in 1988 for easier entry and exit.|$|E
40|$|Aerospace and {{automobile}} structural {{systems are}} assemblages of simple <b>structural</b> <b>members</b> like, columns, circular and rectangular plates etc., designed with lesser margins {{of safety and}} also have minimum mass, are subjected to severe mechanical or thermal loads during the service conditions. As such, these <b>structural</b> <b>members</b> are relatively more flexible, compared to the same used in the other fields of engineering.

To predict the mechanical or thermal postbuckling behavior of these <b>structural</b> <b>members,</b> a more rigorous geometric nonlinear (large deflections) analysis is required. The present study deals with the concept of the effective tensile load developed, due to large deflections, to derive a simple heuristic formula, called simply as the formula, to predict the mechanical postbuckling behavior of circular plates, called simply as plates, without going for complex mathematical treatment 1, 2. The circular plate problem,formulated in the polar coordinate system, is relatively more involved, as the radial and circumferential strains are coupled by the radial displacement, compared to the other <b>structural</b> <b>members,</b> which are formulated in the Cartesian coordinate system. Such formulas are handy and useful to the designers/analysts to quickly evaluate the mechanical postbuckling behavior of the plates, in the iterative design/analysis cycle...|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{standardised method}} of wiring in buildings, in common use in North America from about 1880 to the 1930s, was knob and tube (K&T) wiring: single conductors were run through cavities between the <b>structural</b> <b>members</b> in walls and ceilings, with ceramic tubes forming protective channels through joists and ceramic knobs {{attached to the}} <b>structural</b> <b>members</b> to provide air between the wire and the lumber and to support the wires.
