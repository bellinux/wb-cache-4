5|$|At {{the end of}} The Argentine, Soderbergh depicts Guevara's {{derailment}} of {{a freight}} train during the Battle of Santa Clara. In filming the sequence, Soderbergh balked at the digital effects solution and managed to reallocate $500,000 from the overall $58 million budget to build a real <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>tracks</b> and a train powered by two V-8 car engines. To film the scene, they had six rehearsals, and could only shoot the scene once.|$|E
5|$|The Wheatcroft Collection, Leicestershire, UK. A private collector, Kevin Wheatcroft, {{is about}} to start a restoration/rebuild of a {{complete}} Tiger II. The project will include parts from many individual Tiger IIs, but many parts will be of new manufacture. Wheatcroft has stated that he has 70–80% of the original parts needed for a reconstruction and more parts are sourced continuously. Known and shown parts are a complete front glacis plate, 8.8 cm KwK 43 main armament, engine deck plates, approx. 1/3 hull (rear) in one part, a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>tracks,</b> and approx. 2/3 of the left-side hull plate in two parts. The aim of the project is a complete Tiger II in running order.|$|E
5|$|After Watkin's {{retirement}} from management, {{relations between the}} MR and GCR deteriorated rapidly over shared use of Baker Street station and the congested route into London, and soon broke down completely. On 30 July 1898 John Bell, General Manager of the Metropolitan Railway, {{took control of the}} Quainton Road signal box himself and refused to allow a GCR train onto MR-owned tracks {{on the grounds that it}} was scheduled to take the Great Western rather than the Metropolitan route south of Aylesbury, while on one occasion in 1901 King Edward VII was travelling home after visiting a friend in Wendover; the MR signalman allowed a slow goods train to run in front of the royal train, causing the King to arrive late back in London. The MR management also refused the GCR permission to install points to connect their engine shed at Aylesbury to the railway line, on the grounds that the land for the shed had been bought clandestinely. Eventually a parallel <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>tracks</b> was built for the GCR between Harrow and London, running alongside the MR to a separate terminus at Marylebone, a short distance from Baker Street. The GCR continued to share the less-congested section between Quainton Road and Harrow—including Chalfont Road station—with the MR.|$|E

25|$|Plans for {{a tunnel}} southward {{underneath}} the CBD to Mt Eden {{and even to}} Morningside were debated for nearly a century.

25|$|The {{inclined}} planes had a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>tracks,</b> gauge 12½ feet, {{running from}} the lower level up the incline, over {{the crest of the}} hill at the top, and down into the next level. Tracks were submerged at both ends. A large cradle, holding the boat, ran on the tracks. Iron overshot waterwheels originally powered the planes.|$|E
25|$|By {{forming the}} two {{railways}} upon the original level line, {{in the manner}} above described, the bank-head of the empty waggons is several yards from the bank-head where the loaded waggons start: this distance is got the better of, {{by means of an}} additional piece of rope or chain, that is hooked off and on, as occasion requires. The breadth of each <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>tracks</b> on this line is 4 feet 3 inches; the weight of each of the waggons, when loaded, is between 2 and 3 tons. From 100 to 200 tons of coal pass down this line daily.|$|E
50|$|While the {{majority}} of Tucker Sno-Cats utilized four <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>tracks,</b> a few experimental models and early production models used two <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>tracks.</b> Initially Tucker Sno-Cats employed two front-mounted steering skis and two <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>tracks</b> mounted to the rear. However, {{there are at least}} three production models that only employed dual tracks—the small 222 Tucker Kitten, the 322, and the 323 models were all two-track Tucker Sno-Cats with a conventional front engine design. There are at least two variants of the Tucker Kitten, some have square corner doors while others have rounded corner doors. The Kitten was powered by a 10 hp engine. Additionally there was at least one prototype featuring two tracks and a mid-engine design.|$|R

25|$|The QJs Brighton {{section was}} {{replaced}} with {{an extension of the}} M in 1973, but no other major changes were made until 1986, when reconstruction of the Manhattan Bridge subway tracks began. Though the same general service patterns remained on the Brighton Line, all trains were sent over the bridge and onto the Broadway or Sixth Avenue Line, depending on which <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>tracks</b> was open. From 1986 to 1988, the south side (Broadway) was in service, and the D continued to serve the line at all times, while the M was rerouted away from the Brighton Line, replaced by a greatly increased daytime Q service that absorbed the old QB as part of a 1985 elimination of double letters. For two years, the D and Q provided skip-stop service on the four-track portion of the Brighton Line during the daytime on weekdays.|$|E
25|$|The train (in both {{east and}} westbound) backs {{into the station}} upon arrival with the train facing north while {{standing}} at the station. Departing out of Edmonton station, the train heads east past the CN rail yards (city skyline is visible to the south--right) and cuts across the Canadian prairies for nearly 470 kilometers (272 miles), paralleling (Yellowhead) Alberta Hwy. 14. The train stops in the rural communities of Viking, Alberta and Wainwright, Alberta before turning south to follow Alberta Hwy. 610 and crossing the Alberta-Saskatchewan border, stopping in Unity, Saskatchewan before passing over the Killsquaw Lakes en route to Biggar. Now paralleling Saskatchewan Hwy. 14, the CN tracks branch off, and the train continues west on the main <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>tracks.</b> the train enters Saskatoon from the East, stopping at a modern station south of downtown {{on the site of}} the CN railyards via a short spur line.|$|E
25|$|However, {{even without}} CBTC, {{the system is}} {{currently}} retrofitted to operate at frequencies of up to 60 trains per hour (tph) on the IND Queens Boulevard Line (30 tph {{on each of the}} local and express pairs of tracks made possible by the Jamaica–179th Street terminal, which has four sidings past the terminal for each <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>tracks)</b> and 33 tph on the IRT Flushing Line. The BMT Canarsie Line is limited to a 26 tph frequency due to the bumper blocks at both of its terminals; however, the IRT Lexington Avenue Line operates at frequencies of 27 tph without CBTC. By contrast, lines on the Moscow Metro can operate at frequencies of up to 40 tph, since lines in the Moscow Metro, unlike most of the New York City Subway (but like the Jamaica–179th Street station), typically have four sidings past the terminals instead of bumper blocks or one or two sidings.|$|E

500|$|In {{the late}} 1860s, Andrew Carnegie's Keystone Bridge Company built the {{original}} Keokuk and Hamilton Bridge {{in the same}} location as the Keokuk Rail Bridge. [...] It was a , steel truss bridge that had one <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>tracks</b> and two lanes for wagon traffic. Pedestrian traffic was cantilevered out [...] {{on either side of}} the trusses. [...] A swing span on the Keokuk side allowed river traffic to cross. When the bridge opened in 1871, the first locomotive to cross the bridge crushed the pivot point of the swing span. [...] It was replaced a few days later. Ten years later, War Eagle, a river steamer sank after it collided with a fixed span of the bridge. Both the ship and bridge span were destroyed. Until the span was replaced, a wooden, covered bridge was built in its place.|$|E
