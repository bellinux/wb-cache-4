25|$|The {{number of}} MTs {{attached}} to one kinetochore is variable: in Saccharomyces cerevisiae only one MT binds each kinetochore, whereas in mammals {{there can be}} among 15-35 MTs bound to each kinetochore. However, not all the MTs in the spindle attach to one kinetochore. There are MTs that extend from one centrosome to the other (and {{they are responsible for}} <b>spindle</b> <b>length)</b> and some shorter ones are interdigitated between the long MTs. Professor B. Nicklas (Duke University), showed that, if one breaks down the MT-kinetochore attachment using a laser beam, chromatids can no longer move, leading to an abnormal chromosome distribution. These experiments also showed that kinetochores have polarity, and that kinetochore attachment to MTs emanating from one or the other centrosome will depend on its orientation. This specificity guarantees that only one chromatid will move to each spindle side, thus ensuring the correct distribution of the genetic material. Thus, one of the basic functions of the kinetochore is the MT attachment to the spindle, which is essential to correctly segregate sister chromatids. If anchoring is incorrect, errors may ensue, generating aneuploidy, with catastrophic consequences for the cell. To prevent this from happening, there are mechanisms of error detection and correction (as the spindle assembly checkpoint), whose components reside also on the kinetochores.The movement of one chromatid towards the centrosome is produced primarily by MT depolymerization in the binding site with the kinetochore. These movements require also force generation, involving molecular motors likewise located on the kinetochores.|$|E

40|$|Spindle {{elongation}} {{is crucial}} to normal chromosome separation in eukaryotes; in particular, it is required for or associated with the extension of distance between spindle poles and the further moving apart of the already separated chromosomes. However, {{little is known about}} the relationship between spindle elongation and the status of chromosome separation, and it is unknown whether spindle elongation in different organisms shares any quantitative feature. The Arabidopsis ask 1 - 1 mutant might be a unique material for addressing these questions because it appears to have functional spindles, but a severe defect in homolog separation at male anaphase I (M. Yang, Y. Hu, M. Lodhi, W. R. McCombie, H Ma [1999] Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 96 : 11416 – 11421).

Furthermore, greater movement of chromosomes from the equator was usually found in the ask 1 - 1 cells that had longer than normal spindles. These results suggest that additional elongation of ask 1 - 1 spindles occurred; one possible reason for the extra-long spindles may be that it is a consequence of chromosome non-separation. We also found that normal and ask 1 - 1 <b>spindle</b> <b>lengths</b> are clustered at discrete values, and their differences are of multiples of 0. 7 μm.

The resulting distributions of microtubules (MTs) have been analyzed by computer. Short spindles contain two kinds of MTs: continuous ones that run from pole to pole and MTs that originate at one pole and end {{in the body of}} the spindle. Among the latter there are three pairs of MT bundles that end on fibrous, darkly staining structures that we interpret as kinetochores. The number of MTs ending at each putative kinetochore ranges from two to four; all kinetochore-associated MTs disappear as the spindle elongates from 3 - 6 microns. At this and greater <b>spindle</b> <b>lengths,</b> there are no continuous MTs, only polar MTs that interdigitate at the spindle midzone, but the spindle continues to elongate. An analysis of the density of neighboring MTs at the midzone of long spindles shows that their most common spacing is approximately 40 nm, center to center, and that there is a preferred angular separation of 90 degrees. Only hints of such square-packing are found at the midzone of short spindles, and near the poles there is no apparent order at any mitotic stage. Our data suggest that the kinetochore MTs (KMTs) do not interact directly with nonkinetochore MTs, but that interdigitating MTs from the two spindle poles do interact to form a mechanically stable bundle that connects the poles. As the spindle elongates, the number of MTs decreases while the mean length of the MTs that remain increases. We conclude that the chromosomes of S. pombe become attached to the spindle by kinetochore MTs, that these MTs disappear as the chromosomes segregate, that increased separation of daughter nuclei is accompanied by a sliding apart of anti-parallel MTs, and that the mitotic processes of S. pombe are much like those in other eukaryotic cells...|$|R
40|$|A {{methodology}} for producing a workable number of chainless/bag-only spindles, (otherwise well developed), in the medial gastrocnemius muscle {{of the adult}} rat was explored {{by means of a}} series of neonatal nerve crushes. The single-fibre and two-fibre spindles thus produced as permanent structures in the adult were termed "model adult" spindles. Nuclear bags were well preserved in all spindles designated as model-adult. A histological study was made of these <b>spindles.</b> <b>Length</b> was the most affected spindle dimension. Most model-adult spindles were shorter than normal, the decrease involving the polar lengths (regions B and C; see Banks et al, 1976) rather than the periaxial lengths (region A). Apart from some myofibrillar disarrangement and a general increase in sarcoplasm, the fine structure and histochemistry of model-adult bag fibres was comparable to that of control bag fibres (certainly, in the two-fibre spindles). Thus, the bag 1 fibre (Banks et al,' 76) lacked an M line throughout its length whereas the bagi fibre lacked thisfeature only in region A. The presence or absence of an M line in m any of the single-fibre spindles could not be ascertained because of sarcomere 11 blurring ", but in some, a double M line could be recognised throughout {{the entire length of the}} bag fibre.

As regards the form of the primary ending, fewer annulospirals were in evidence, Ultra structurally, however, the sensory terminals appeared quite normal. There were fewer fusimotor axons (particularly, trail axons) per model-adult spindle, the reduction reflecting the absence of chain fibres. Of the two types of fusimotor plate recognised in the control spindles, the smaller type remained intact in model-adult spindles.

40|$|Abstract Background Metaphase {{cells have}} short {{spindles}} for efficient bi-orientation of chromosomes. The cohesin proteins hold sister chromatids together, creating Sister Chromatid Cohesion (SCC) that helps {{in the maintenance}} of short <b>spindle</b> <b>lengths</b> in metaphase. The budding yeast protein Chl 1 p, which has human homologs, is required for DNA damage repair, recombination, transcriptional silencing and aging. This protein is also needed to establish SCC between sister chromatids in S-phase. Results In the present study we have further characterized Chl 1 p for {{its role in the}} yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae when cells are under replication stress. We show that when DNA replication is arrested by hydroxyurea (HU), the chl 1 mutation causes growth deficiency and a mild loss in cell viability. Although both mutant and wild-type cells remained arrested with undivided nuclei, mutant cells had mitotic spindles, which were about 60 - 80 % longer than wild-type spindles. Spindle extension occurred in S-phase in the presence of an active S-phase checkpoint pathway. Further, the chl 1 mutant did not show any kinetochore-related defect that could have caused spindle extension. These cells were affected in the retention of SCC in that they had only about one-fourth of the normal levels of the cohesin subunit Scc 1 p at centromeres, which was sufficient to bi-orient the chromosomes. The mutant cells showed defects in SCC, both during its establishment in S-phase and in its maintenance in G 2. Mutants with partial and pericentromeric cohesion defects also showed spindle elongation when arrested in S-phase by HU. Conclusions Our work shows that Chl 1 p is required for normal growth and cell viability {{in the presence of the}} replication block caused by HU. The absence of this protein does not, however, compromize the replication checkpoint pathway. Even though the chl 1 mutation gives synthetic lethal interactions with kinetochore mutations, its absence does not affect kinetochore function; kinetochore-microtubule interactions remain unperturbed. Further, chl 1 cells were found to lose SCC at centromeres in both S- and G 2 phases, showing the requirement of Chl 1 p for the maintenance of cohesion in G 2 phase of these cells. This work documents for the first time that SCC is an important determinant of spindle size in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae when genotoxic agents cause S-phase arrest of cells. </p...|$|R

Hence, metaphase <b>spindle</b> <b>length</b> may be crucial for segregation fidelity. Suppressors of mis 12 partly restore normal metaphase <b>spindle</b> <b>length.</b> In mis 4 that is defective in sister chromatid cohesion, metaphase <b>spindle</b> <b>length</b> is also long, but anaphase spindle extension is blocked, probably due to the activated spindle checkpoint. Extensive missegregation is caused in mis 12 only when Mis 12 is inactivated from the previous M through to the following M, an effective way to avoid missegregation in the cell cycle. Mis 12 has conserved homologs in budding yeast and filamentous fungi...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The three {{dimensional}} {{organization of}} microtubules in mitotic spindles of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{has been determined}} by computer-aided reconstruction from electron micrographs of serially cross-sectioned spindles. Fifteen <b>spindles</b> ranging in <b>length</b> from 0. 6 - 9. 4 Ixm have been analyzed. Ordered microtubule packing is absent in spindles up to 0. 8 Ixm, but {{the total number of}} microtubules is sufficient to allow one microtubule per kinetochore with a few additional microtubules that may form an interpolar spindle. An obvious bundle of about eight interpolar microtubules was found in spindles 1. 3 - 1. 6 p~m long, and we suggest that the ~ 32 remaining microtubules act as kinetochore fibers. The relative lengths of the mi-crotubules in these spindles suggest that they may be i...|$|R
40|$|Scientific Report Msd 1 /SSX 2 IP-dependent {{microtubule}} anchorage ensures spindle {{orientation and}} primary cilia formation Akiko Hori 1, Chiho Ikebe 1,†, Masazumi Tada 2 & Takashi Toda 1,* Anchoring microtubules to the centrosome {{is critical for}} cell geometry and polarity, yet the molecular mechanism remains unknown. Here we show that the conserved human Msd 1 /SSX 2 IP is required for microtubule anchoring. hMsd 1 /SSX 2 IP is delivered to the centrosome in a centriolar satellite-dependent manner and binds the microtubule-nucleator c-tubulin complex. hMsd 1 /SSX 2 IP depletion leads to disorganised interphase microtubules and misoriented mitotic <b>spindles</b> with reduced <b>length</b> and intensity. Furthermore, hMsd 1 /SSX 2 IP is essential for ciliogenesis, and during zebrafish embryogenesis, knockdown of its orthologue results in ciliary defects and disturbs left-right asymmetry. We propose that the Msd 1 family comprises conserved microtubule-anchoring proteins...|$|R
5000|$|The Dierks-Creveling House is {{a two-story}} {{dwelling}} of native yellow limestone {{that was built}} on a 21 in stone foundation. [...] The main house measures 27 by 36 ft. The stone walls taper to 18 in on the second floor. The frame kitchen measures 17 by 26 ft, and the room off the kitchen is 17 by 21 ft. The entrance porch on the addition features five turned posts and two one/half posts as its supports. Between the posts are Queen Anne-style turnings located under the roof line. A two-story porch with square columns, corbels and turned <b>spindles</b> extended the <b>length</b> of the main house. Its possible it was added {{at the same time}} as the porch on the addition as the turnings appear to be similar.
