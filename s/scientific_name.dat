5|$|In 1758, Linnaeus {{described}} the tiger {{in his work}} Systema Naturae and gave it the <b>scientific</b> <b>name</b> Felis tigris. In 1929, the British taxonomist Reginald Innes Pocock subordinated the species under the genus Panthera using the <b>scientific</b> <b>name</b> Panthera tigris.|$|E

5|$|The {{great white}} shark {{was one of the}} many {{amphibia}} originally described by Linnaeus in the landmark 1758 10th edition of his Systema Naturae, its first <b>scientific</b> <b>name,</b> Squalus carcharias. Later, Sir Andrew Smith gave it Carcharodon as its generic name in 1833, and also in 1873. The generic name was identified with Linnaeus' specific name and the current <b>scientific</b> <b>name,</b> Carcharodon carcharias, was finalized. Carcharodon comes from the Ancient Greek words karcharos, which means sharp or jagged, and odous, which means tooth.|$|E
30|$|Interestingly, {{our study}} has implied an {{extraordinary}} species richness pattern along latitudes in East Asia. A latitudinal pattern of angiosperm species richness appears while numbers of <b>scientific</b> <b>names</b> are compared among ecoregions of four groups (Table  1). Two subtropical ecoregions in South China possess {{the highest number}} of <b>scientific</b> <b>names</b> in Asia and there are 12, 271 and 11, 696 <b>scientific</b> <b>names</b> of ecoregions 20 and 17, respectively (Table  1). High numbers of <b>scientific</b> <b>names</b> in subtropical ecoregions are expected to have high angiosperm species richness.|$|R
40|$|<b>Scientific</b> <b>names</b> {{of plants}} and animals have a major role when indexing, querying, and {{integrating}} information about species. Biologists use <b>scientific</b> <b>names</b> while {{the vast majority of people}} use common name equivalents.

50|$|Snethlage is also commemorated in {{the common}} and <b>scientific</b> <b>names</b> of the Emilia's {{marmoset}} (Mico emiliae), also known as Snethlage's marmoset, and the <b>scientific</b> <b>names</b> of two species of South American reptiles: Atractus snethlageae, a snake; and Leposoma snethlageae (= Loxopholis snethlageae), a gymnophthalmid lizard.|$|R
5|$|The <b>scientific</b> <b>name</b> of an {{organism}} is generated from its genus and species. For example, humans {{are listed as}} Homo sapiens. Homo is the genus, and sapiens the species. When writing the <b>scientific</b> <b>name</b> of {{an organism}}, it is proper to capitalize the first letter in the genus and put all of the species in lowercase. Additionally, the entire term may be italicized or underlined.|$|E
5|$|Common names include Jersey cow mushroom, bovine bolete, and euro cow bolete. One {{proposed}} origin for the <b>scientific</b> <b>name</b> is that medieval knights—who revered Tricholoma equestre—considered this mushroom fit {{only for}} cattle-drovers {{as it was}} not highly valued.|$|E
5|$|Kingdom Plantae {{belongs to}} Domain Eukarya and is broken down recursively until each species is {{separately}} classified. The order is: Kingdom; Phylum (or Division); Class; Order; Family; Genus (plural genera); Species. The <b>scientific</b> <b>name</b> {{of a plant}} represents its genus and its species within the genus, resulting in a single worldwide name for each organism. For example, the tiger lily is Lilium columbianum. Lilium is the genus, and columbianum the specific epithet. The combination {{is the name of}} the species. When writing the <b>scientific</b> <b>name</b> of an organism, it is proper to capitalise the first letter in the genus and put all of the specific epithet in lowercase. Additionally, the entire term is ordinarily italicised (or underlined when italics are not available).|$|E

5|$|The Eurasian {{treecreeper}} {{was first}} described under its current <b>scientific</b> <b>name</b> by Linnaeus in his Systema naturae in 1758. The binomial name {{is derived from}} Ancient Greek kerthios, a small tree-dwelling bird described by Aristotle and others, and Latin familiaris, familiar or common.|$|E
5|$|The list is in taxonomic order. The English name of {{each species}} is given, {{followed}} by its <b>scientific</b> <b>name,</b> {{details of the}} range countries for each breeding species, and an overall status code for species which are not long-established extant breeding species.|$|E
5|$|The {{rules of}} the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature are that in general the first-published {{description}} has priority; therefore, the valid <b>scientific</b> <b>name</b> for the oceanic whitetip shark should be Carcharhinus maou. However, Lesson's name remained forgotten {{for so long that}} Carcharhinus longimanus remains widely accepted.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{changes in}} many <b>scientific</b> <b>names</b> have caused {{confusion}} for many non-systematists.

5|$|The <b>scientific</b> <b>name</b> of the serval is Leptailurus serval. It is {{the sole}} member of the genus Leptailurus.

5|$|The <b>scientific</b> <b>name,</b> Echinocereus, {{comes from}} the Greek ekinos, meaning hedgehog, and cereus, the Latin term for wax paper.

5|$|Subsequent authors {{moved the}} {{blacktip reef shark}} to the genus Carcharhinus; in 1965 the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature {{designated}} it as the type species for the genus. In some earlier literature, the <b>scientific</b> <b>name</b> of this shark was mistakenly given as C. spallanzani, now recognized as a synonym of the spottail shark (C. sorrah). Other common names for this species include blackfin reef shark, black-finned shark, blacktip shark, reef blacktip shark, and guliman.|$|E

5|$|The Chittenango ovate amber snail, <b>scientific</b> <b>name</b> Novisuccinea chittenangoensis, is {{a species}} of small {{air-breathing}} land snail in the family Succineidae, the amber snails. This species was discovered in 1905, and was reported three years later as a subspecies of the oval ambersnail, Succinea ovalis. Several taxonomic reviews {{took place in the}} subsequent decades {{until the end of the}} 1980s, when the Chittenango ovate amber snail was finally judged to be a distinct species Novisuccinea chittenangoensis, based on chemical and morphological data.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{sparrowhawk}} {{was described}} by Linnaeus in his 18th century work, Systema Naturae, as Falco nisus, but moved to its present genus by French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760. The current <b>scientific</b> <b>name</b> {{is derived from the}} Latin accipiter, meaning 'hawk' and nisus, the sparrowhawk. According to Greek mythology, Nisus, the king of Megara, was turned into a sparrowhawk after his daughter, Scylla, cut off his purple lock of hair to present to her lover (and Nisus' enemy), Minos.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} possible {{fossils of}} the genus came from the Taynton Limestone Formation. One of these was {{the lower part of}} a femur, discovered in the 17th century. It was originally described by Robert Plot as a thighbone of a Roman war elephant, and then as a biblical giant. The first <b>scientific</b> <b>name</b> given for it, in the 18th century, was Scrotum humanum, created by Richard Brookes as a caption; however, this is not considered valid today.|$|E
