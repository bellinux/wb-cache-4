5|$|Because {{of their}} larval {{development}} inside the seeds which {{are protected by}} the pods, most inventorying methods are based on population of B. rufimanus adult in the field or at emergence. Adult population density can be estimated by counts on plants at field colonization. The development semiochemical attractants trapping systems for both monitoring and pest control has received particular interest in ongoing research on the weevil. Egg density can be estimated on young developing pods (>2 cm) during the oviposition period. Eggs are however small (<1mm length), green-yellowish, therefore difficult to observe. In addition, population estimate are difficult to obtain as egg laying is spread over time until 5–10 days {{after the end of}} flowering (BBCH 77). After harvest, <b>seed</b> <b>quality</b> can be observed manually at harvest and characterized according to pest damage (healthy, with no trace of damage/containing developing larvae/trace of emerged B. rufimanus adult (a hole in the seed). Alternative methods exist to sort the seeds: sorting can be done using differences in seed density due to the presence of the developing larva or of the hole left by the emerged adult, estimation of damages seeds can be done by tomography analysis. Additionally, the end of larval and pupal diapause and therefore the emergence of B. rufimanus can be induced via a solution of NaOCl and chinosol in 7 days at 30 °C, allowing the estimation of an overall infestation rate can be assessed.|$|E

The species are normally grown from seeds, so maturation studies are important to assist the point of harvest, as well as seeds with a high physiological potential, since the fruits remain enclosed within a cup throughout their development. Despite the nutraceutical importance of fruits and medicinal potential of many species of Physalisinformation on the physiological <b>seeds</b> <b>quality</b> are scarce. This study aimed to monitor the physical and physiological changes of maturation and the viability of seeds during fruit development stages.

Length, diameter, fresh weight, skin and cup coloring characterization, TSS content, number and weight of seeds per fruit were obtained at each development stage. We also evaluated and correlated the coloring and pigment content of the cup (chlorophyll a and b). Water content, dry matter weight and germination rate were measured from fresh and dry seeds (room conditions, 72 hours). The main physical and physiological changes during maturation occurred within 35 DAA.
