40|$|Millions of {{customer}} services representatives are assessed {{each year by}} <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> <b>experts</b> (e. g., recruiters, team leaders) in Asian contact centres to ensure good spoken communication skills when serving customers on the phones. In other workplace contexts, language experts are employed to do this work but in Asian contact centres, a successful transfer of language expert assessment knowledge and skills to <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> <b>experts</b> is preferred for practical and cost reasons. To date however, no studies {{have been carried out}} to demonstrate that <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> <b>experts</b> can do this language assessment in a reliable way. This study explores how a linguistically-informed spoken assessment rubric, called the Business Performance Assessment Scale (BUPLAS), is used by <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> <b>experts</b> to assess the English communication skills {{of customer}} service representatives employed in an India-based contact centre. After a week-long training programme on how to use BUPLAS, the results revealed that the <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> <b>experts</b> had high intra-rater and inter-rater reliability when they scored real calls. They also understood, interpreted, and ‘indigenously scored’ the linguistically-informed criteria. The implications of these results in deferring to <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> <b>experts</b> to conduct language assessments in this workplace are discussed...|$|R

For instance, a knowledge-based engineering system can enhance its operational aspect and thereby its stability through more involvement by the <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> <b>expert,</b> thereby opening up issues of limits that are related to being human. As in, many times, computational results have to be taken at face value due to several factors (hence the duck test's necessity arises) that even an expert cannot overcome. The end proof may be the final results (reasonable facsimile by simulation or artifact, working design, etc.) that are not guaranteed to be repeatable, may have been costly to attain (time and money), and so forth.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of its}} {{outreach}} {{to address the needs}} of the software community, DACS provides a technical inquiry service, wherein it provides up to four hours of research, free of charge, to address any technical inquiry from any member of the DACS community. In some cases, DACS connects the inquirer directly with a <b>Subject</b> <b>Matter</b> <b>Expert</b> (SME) to satisfy the request. DTIC, the organization that funds the DACS, regards the number of technical inquiries handled by DACS each month as a key performance metric for operation of the IAC. The scope of questions asked is very broad, ranging from simple questions asking for a definition of an acronym, to very complex questions.

40|$|<b>Subject</b> <b>matter</b> <b>experts,</b> {{under the}} {{influence}} of modernist notions of authorship, often view technical writers as mere grammar and punctuation specialists and marginalize them as their ignorant “other. ” Technical writers, on the other hand, as rhetoricians occupying a liminal space between different disciplines, can understand different disciplinary rhetorics. If <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> <b>experts,</b> instead of marginalizing technical writers, would view them as liminal subjects who are knowledgeable in different disciplinary rhetorics, then technical writers, through liminal practice, may be able to use their knowledge of audience and rhetoric {{to improve the quality of}} documentation. Keywords: liminality; othering; rhetoric; technical communication; postcolonial theory Technical writing includes a variety of tasks, ranging from conducting and reporting research for corporate management to composing online documentation. Technical writing may also include the writing of <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> <b>experts,</b> such as engineers, who “write reports, proposals, and correspondence” (Selzer, 1983, p. 179), or others who, as Winsor (1994 b) explained, produce representations and inscriptions in the form of “presentations” or “symbols other than words ” (p. 344). In many technical writing situations, <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> <b>experts</b> and technical writers collaborate to author documents. As Emerson (1987) described it, “In practice many technical documents are written by a group of people rather than by an individual. Each person working on the project must understand and carry out his or her role in the production of the final document” (p. 29). However, this article explores only those relationships involving <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> <b>experts</b> and technical writers. In these relationships between <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> <b>experts</b> and technical writers, a power differential sometimes exists that affects the technical writing situation.
