25|$|As modems reached {{speeds of}} 28.8kbit/s, the {{overhead}} of the TCP/IP protocols {{were no longer}} so egregious and dial-up Internet became increasingly common. By 1995 the bulletin board market was reeling as users abandoned local BBS systems in favour of larger sites and web pages, which could be accessed worldwide for the same cost as accessing a local BBS system. This also made FidoNet less expensive to implement, because inter-net transfers could be delivered over the Internet as well, at little or no marginal cost. But this seriously diluted the entire purpose of the <b>store-and-forward</b> model, which had been built up specifically to address a long-distance problem that no longer existed.|$|E

The technology consisted of a videophone produced by 7E Communications Ltd of London, UK.

25|$|Early {{versions}} of Usenet used Duke's A News software, designed {{for one or}} two articles a day. Matt Glickman and Horton at Berkeley produced an improved version called B News that could handle the rising traffic (about 50 articles a day as of late 1983). With a message format that offered compatibility with Internet mail and improved performance, it became the dominant server software. C News, developed by Geoff Collyer and Henry Spencer at the University of Toronto, was comparable to B News in features but offered considerably faster processing. In the early 1990s, InterNetNews by Rich Salz was developed {{to take advantage of the}} continuous message flow made possible by NNTP versus the batched <b>store-and-forward</b> design of UUCP. Since that time INN development has continued, and other news server software has also been developed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—As {{critical}} infrastructures in the Internet, {{data centers}} {{have evolved to}} include {{hundreds of thousands of}} servers in a single facility to support data- and/or computing-intensive applications. For such large-scale systems, it becomes a great challenge to design an interconnection network that provides high capacity, low complexity, low latency and low power consumption. The traditional approach is to build a hierarchical packet network using switches and routers. This approach suffers from limited scalability in the aspects of power consumption, wiring and control complexity, and delay caused by multi-hop <b>store-and-forwarding.</b> In this paper we tackle the challenge by designing a novel switch architecture that supports direct interconnection of huge number of server racks and provides switching capacity at the level of Petabit/s. Our design combines the best features of electronics and optics. Exploiting recent advances in optics, we propose to build a bufferless optical switch fabric that includes interconnected arrayed waveguide grating routers (AWGRs) and tunable wavelength converters (TWCs). The optical fabric is integrated with electronic buffering and control to perform high-speed switching with nanosecond-level reconfiguration overhead. In particular, our architecture reduces the wiring complexity from O(N) to O(sqrt(N)). We design a practical and scalable scheduling algorithm to achieve high throughput under various traffic load. We also discuss implementation issues to justify the feasibility of this design. Simulation shows that our design achieves good throughput and delay performance.

2500|$|Although the Kims had a {{cellular}} phone with them, their remote location in the mountains was {{out of range of}} the cellular network, rendering the phone unusable for voice calls. [...] Despite being unusable for voice calls, their cell phone would {{play a key role in}} their rescue. [...] Cell phone text messages may go through even when there appears to be no signal, in part because text messaging is a <b>store-and-forward</b> service. [...] Two Edge Wireless engineers, Eric Fuqua and Noah Pugsley, contacted search and rescue authorities offering their help in the search. On Saturday, December 2, they began searching through the data logs of cell sites, trying to find records of repeaters to which the Kims' cellphone may have connected. They discovered that on November 26, 2006 at around 1:30a.m., the Kims' cellphone made a brief automatic connection to a cell site near Glendale, Oregon, and retrieved two text messages. Temporary atmospheric conditions, such as tropospheric ducting, can briefly allow radio communications over larger distances than normal. Through the data logs, the engineers determined that the cell phone was in a specific area west of the cellular tower. They then used a computer program to determine which areas in the mountains were within a line-of-sight to the cellular tower. This narrowed the search area tremendously, and finally focused rescue efforts on Bear Camp Road.|$|E
50|$|Most packet {{switched}} networks use <b>store-and-forward</b> transmission at {{the input of}} the link. A switch using <b>store-and-forward</b> transmission will receive (save) the entire packet to the buffer and check it for CRC errors or other problems before sending the first bit of the packet into the outbound link.
