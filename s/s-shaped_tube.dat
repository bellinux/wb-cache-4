5000|$|The most {{characteristic}} {{element of}} the transfer tube pump is the so-called [...] "S" [...] transfer tube installed inside the feed hopper. The job of the transfer tube is to control the flow of high-density solids - in other words, the pump cylinder which is currently pushing the material {{is connected to the}} delivery line by such tube. At (or nearby) the end of each piston stroke the <b>S-shaped</b> <b>tube</b> which is connected to the delivery line is swung over to the other delivery cylinder with the aid of two switch cylinders. A hydraulic circuit is used for synchronizing the position of the transfer tube and the movements of the two delivery pistons.|$|E
50|$|Each {{individual}} floret is bisexual, with a yellow, star-symmetric corolla of 22-25 mm long, {{consisting of}} a narrow, straight or <b>S-shaped</b> <b>tube</b> of 10-11 mm long, which abruptly widens into a deeply 5-lobed bell, the twisting lobes being 7-8 mm long, softly haired, with twin hairs and glandular hairs consisting of two piles of a few cells, while the tip is adorned with a tuft of hairs. Like in all asteraceae the five anthers are fused into a tube, through which the style grows, picking up the pollen on hairs along its length. The anthers in Warionia are yellow, 11-12 mm long, their base reaching 1Â½-2 mm below the attachment to the yellow hearless filaments, and the acute tips reaches 2 mm above the merged tube. The pollen grains are large, approximately globular, tricolpate, carrying spines and with perforations between the spines. The yellow style, has a widened base carrying a nectary, grows to eventually 24-26 mm long, and splits in its female phase at the tip into two 4-6 mm long branches. The inner surface of the style branches is completely covered papillae, while the outer surface has hairs extending somewhat below the branches.|$|E
50|$|Sanger-Black {{apparatus}} is a {{piece of}} chemical laboratory ware used for quantitative and semi-quantitative determination of arsenic element in the solution. It is constituted by glass bottle of volume ca. 30 mL, sealed with rubber stopper with one or two holes. Through one hole a thistle tube is inserted, almost reaching the bottom, for filling the bottle (what can be done also when the stopper is taken out - for semi-quantitative determination). The second, <b>S-shaped</b> <b>tube</b> is for outflow of the gases and joined by another rubber stopper to a bulg tube, with bulb containing pre-dried cotton as adsorbent, presumably intended for homogenizing the gas flow. A thin reagent paper, impregnated with mercury(II) chloride (nowadays replaced by mercury(II) bromide) or silver(I) nitrate, is placed in the open end of the bulb tube. If the semi-quantitative variant is to be performed, the paper is put in the (only) thistle tube - i. e., vertically, not horizontally. During the test ca. 3 g of Zn granules are placed into the bottle, just below the end of thistle tube, and then acid solution is added (ca. 15 mL; authors recommend that HCl is preferable to H2SO4). About 10 minutes are required to let H2 flow along the reagent paper, while this flow and moisture content inside it is stabilizing. Then the sample is introduced, and in case of sample solution containing arsenic the paper becomes more or less stained.|$|E
50|$|The ancient Nordic lur {{was made}} of bronze and {{dates back to the}} Late Bronze Age (1000-500 BCE). This {{extraordinary}} instrument consisted of an elaborate <b>S-shaped</b> conical <b>tube,</b> usually about 2 m in length, with a slightly flared bell. It was an end-blown natural trumpet, and sounded rather like a modern trombone. To date, fifty-six lurs have been found: forty-five in Denmark, eleven in Sweden, four in Norway, five in northern Germany, and one in Latvia. They have often been discovered in matching pairs, which suggests that they were used for ceremonial or religious purposes, rather than as instruments of war. The original name of the instrument is unknown.|$|R
50|$|Structurally, O. viverrini is {{basically}} similar to C. sinensis and O. felineus, {{but it is}} slightly smaller than the two flukes. The body of an adult O. viverrini is flat (dorso-ventrally flattened) like a leaf, shaped like a lancet, and can be seen through (transparent). They are monoecious {{so that there are}} no male or female individuals; each fluke has the complete sets of both male and female reproductive systems. A typical individual is 7 mm long and 1.5 mm wide. The anterior end is more pointed and marked by a mouth-like structure called oral sucker. About 1.5 mm behind the oral sucker is a similar structure called ventral sucker. These suckers are the organs of attachment. There are two testes towards the posterior end. The testes are lobed in contrast to the branched (dendritic) testes of C.sinensis. It is connected to the seminal vesicle, which is a coiled tube running up to the ejaculatory duct, which in turn opens through a small opening called genital pore {{just in front of the}} ventral sucker. Two ovaries are situated in front of the testes, and they form several lobes. The uterus runs along the ejaculatory duct and opens at the genital pore. There is a sac-like <b>S-shaped</b> <b>tube</b> called excretory bladder in between the two testes. The remainder of the body spaces are mostly occupied by a highly branched glandular organ called vitellaria (often called vitelline glands). Unlike the anterior end, the posterior end is rounded.|$|E
40|$|Activities are {{reported}} on development {{work on a}} mass flow system capable of measuring externally the properties of homogeneous flow, slurries, highly corrosive fluids, and multi-phase fluids. In the proposed system, the fluid passes through an <b>S-shaped</b> <b>tube</b> wherein measurements of the angular momentum and density yield mass flow directly. (B. O. G. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{mass flow}} {{measurement}} technique was devised which meets many requirements for mass flow measurement systems. In this technique. fluid {{is made to}} pass through a pivoted <b>S-shaped</b> <b>tube.</b> which tends to rotate due to the angular momentum of the fluid. A torque motor and torsion spring maintain zero displacement. the restoring force being {{a measure of the}} angular momentum, and density is measured by absorption of radiation passing through a window in the S tube. From the measured angular momentum and density, the mass flow can be computed. Two experimental mass gages using this technique have been constructed. (D. L. C. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{upper airway}} makes a curve with its {{convexity}} following the natural lordosis of the cervical vertebrae, which {{interferes with the}} introduction and satisfactory positioning of a nasal endotracheal tube, particularly one of the Magill pattern. To overcome this difficulty a double-curved, <b>S-shaped,</b> <b>tube</b> for nasal intubation has been developed and studied. When the glottis is exposed with a Macintosh laryngoscope, {{the tip of a}} Magill tube inserted through the nose tends to point anteriorly as it glides over the posterior pharyngeal wall, and impinges upon the anterior commissure of the larynx. Intubating forceps are often required at this stage. Gillespie (1948) suggests withdrawing the tube slightly, flexing the head acutely and then pushing the tube forward, while Galley (persona...|$|E
40|$|Insertion of trocars, needles, and {{catheters}} into unintended tissues or tissue compartments {{results in}} {{hundreds of thousands of}} complications annually. Current methods for blood vessel cannulation or epidural, chest tube, and initial trocar placement often involve the blind pass of a needle through several layers of tissue and generally rely on distinguishable anatomic landmarks and a high degree of clinical skill. To address this simply and without the use of electronics, a purely mechanical clutch system was developed for use in medical devices that access tissue and tissue compartments. This clutch utilizes the surface contact of a buckled filament inside an <b>S-shaped</b> <b>tube</b> to transmit force from the filament (catheter/guide wire) to the tube (needle). Upon encountering sufficient resistance at the tip, such as dense tissue, the catheter buckles and locks within the tube, causing the filament and needle to advance as one. When the needle reaches the target tissue or fluid-filled cavity, the filament unlocks and slides freely into the target region while the needle remains stationary. A similar locking phenomenon has long been observed in drill strings inside drill shafts used by the oil-drilling industry, and oil industry models were adapted to describe the motion of this clutch system. A predictive analytical model was generated and validated with empirical data and used to develop prototypes of a complete device then tested in vitro on muscle tissue and in vivo on a porcine laparoscopic model with promising results...|$|E
