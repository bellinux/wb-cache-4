40|$|The {{numerical}} simulation method {{is used to}} solve the problems of pipe bending manufacturing such as die with fine cracks, ovality of pipe. The fan-shaped die is welded with steel plate in circle and rib in radial direction by the analysis of structural deformation. The optimal design is provided with ovality of pipe as object variable and <b>sliding</b> <b>slot</b> dimensions as design variables. Compared with experiential shape groove of slot, ovality of optimized slot decreases about 10. 5 % in average.

40|$|A FEM-numerical {{simulation}} {{system is}} developed {{to simulate the}} process of rotary draw bending of tube. The emphasis is to discuss some factors such as tube materials, bending moment of fan-shaped die, pushing force of <b>sliding</b> <b>slot</b> and tube relative bending radius which {{have an effect on}} tube bending quality. The quality parameters of ovality, thinning ratio and thickening ratio are the same as the measurement values in the practical production. Some improved methods are put forward to according to the simulation results. The experiment shows that the simulation system can forecast accurately the deformation in the process of tube bending, so the production manufacturing cost decreases greatly. 5 page(s...|$|R
30|$|Owing to the {{limitation}} of space, the tiltable link is positioned opposite to G 1 but still on the line connecting G 1 and G 2. As the link was only required to be tilted by a small angle for jam-negation, positioning the link in this manner or instead using a <b>sliding</b> <b>slot</b> for G 2, tangent to the G 1 circumference should provide the same result. A DC adapter is used to supply the input voltage to the rotating motor unit. The prototype is made mainly of aluminum and weighs 650  g.

Sometimes the metopes and friezes were cut from different stone, so as to provide color contrast. Although they tend to be close to square in shape, some metopes are noticeably larger in height or in width. They may also vary in width within a single structure to allow for corner contraction, an adjustment of the column spacing and arrangement of the Doric frieze in a temple to make the design appear more harmonious.|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} adjust the rate, the balance spring usually has a {{regulator}}. The regulator is a moveable lever mounted on the balance cock or bridge, pivoted coaxially with the balance. A narrow slot is formed {{on one end of}} the regulator by two downward projecting pins, called curb pins, or by a curb pin and a pin with a heavier section called a boot. The end of the outer turn of the balance spring is fixed in a stud which is secured to the balance cock. The outer turn of the spring then passes through the regulator slot. The portion of the spring between the stud and the slot is held stationary, so the position of the slot controls the free length of the spring. Moving the regulator <b>slides</b> the <b>slot</b> along the outer turn of the spring, changing its effective length. Moving the slot away from the stud shortens the spring, making it stiffer, increasing the balance's oscillation rate, and making the timepiece gain time.|$|R

The {{other end of the}} actuating lever is attached to a die block which <b>slides</b> in a <b>slotted</b> link. When the link is vertical, the engine is in mid-gear. Forward, reverse and cut-off adjustments are made by moving the link away from the vertical. The valve rod is pivoted to a point on the actuating lever.|$|R
40|$|Kraven på att nybyggda bostäder ska vara energisnåla i driftskedet ökar hela tiden av flera anledningar. Dels vill brukarna hålla driftskostnaderna så låga som möjligt och dels är det miljöaspekten som spelar in. Men hur energisnål kan en villa egentligen göras och hur påverkas arkitekturen då den görs extremt energieffektiv? I den här rapporten utreds tio energieffektiva principer som kan användas för att göra en villa mer energisnål och energiproducerande. Alla tio principer har tillämpats i en villa som projekterats under arbetets gång. De tio principerna är: Husets utformning Konstruktion Isolerade skjutluckor Solceller Solavskärmning Energitak Uppvärmningssystem Vindkraftverk Vindskydd Medvetenhet och inredning Resultaten visar att villan kommer ge ett energiöverskott på cirka 6   000 kWh/år enligt enklare handberäkningar av husets energiförbrukning och den producerade energin. Arkitekturen blir tydligt påverkad av de energieffektiva principerna men huset är ändå fullt funktionellt. Att tillämpa tio energieffektiva principer i en villa kan vara svårt att försvara ekonomiskt då pay-off tiderna är långa på grund av höga investeringskostnader. Arbetet har utförts på KTH campus Haninge i samarbete med Sweco Architects AB. The {{demands on}} newly {{constructed}} buildings to be energy efficient in the operational stage are increasing {{all the time}} by many reasons. Partly because {{the people living in}} the house want to keep the operational costs as low as possible and partly because of the impact on the environment. But how energy efficient can a villa be made and how does it affect the architecture when it is made extremely energy efficient? In this essay ten energy efficient principles are investigated which {{can be used to make}} a villa more energy efficient and energy producing. All ten principles have been applied in one villa that has been designed during this project. The ten principles are: The design and shape of the house Construction Insulated <b>sliding</b> <b>slots</b> Solar panels Sun shading Energy roof Heating system Wind power turbine Wind protection Consciousness and interior design The results show that the villa will produce an overbalance of energy of about 6   000 kWh/year according to simpler calculations of the house´s energy consumption and the energy that it produces. The architecture is clearly affected by the energy efficient principles but the house is still fully functioning. Applying ten energy efficient principles in one villa can be hard to motivate economically because of long pay-off times caused by high investment costs.

30|$|In {{consideration}} of GSM as an asynchronous system, downlink signals between each base station do not perform timeslot synchronization. The boundary of each timeslot would not coincide in one physical frame {{period in the}} received sampled signal of the same carrier coming from different cells. Hence, the detection for every timeslot power must perform sliding widow detection in a burst over one timeslot period. Moreover, parallel detecting using nine groups of training sequence code for every time-delay signal is to detect whether this timeslot exists in traffic occupancy and also to detect the corresponding training sequence code of maximum correlative power signal when timeslot is existing in traffic occupancy. Figure  1 shows the parallel <b>sliding</b> window time <b>slot</b> detection technology method.|$|R

Finally, a cap on the end of a screw attached to the stem <b>slides</b> into a <b>slot</b> on the drive side of the mainframe, securing it.

40|$|Abstract: A novel {{concept for}} rotary {{machines}} is described. A rotor is positioned acentrically in a cylindrical cavity. One or more (typically, three or four) vanes <b>slide</b> radially in <b>slots</b> in the rotor. The vanes {{are connected to}} an axle such that {{the tip of a}} vane follows the internal surface of the housing without touching it. It is shown how the concept can be utilized in the design of compressors, expanders, and internal combustion engines. A thermodynamic model is formulated for the engine process, and calculations for a chosen set of geometrical data are presented. It is concluded that the machine can be described mathematically, and that it can work as claimed by the inventor, Kjell Vading. Some potential advantages over other concepts are discussed...|$|R
50|$|The half-cock notch most {{commonly}} worked through insertion of a spring-loaded thin metal plate {{into a slot}} cut into the tumbler, the tumbler being variously either part of the hammer or mechanically attached to the pivot-point of the hammer, depending on the particular firearm under discussion. When the tumbler/hammer rotated quickly from full-cock, the spring-loaded metal plate could not engage into the slot cut into the tumbler, and the firearm could fire since the hammer would fully rotate. When the tumbler/hammer rotated slowly from full-cock, such as when engaging the half-cock notch, the metal plate would <b>slide</b> into the <b>slot</b> cut in the tumbler, thereby preventing the hammer/tumbler from rotating fully, hence preventing the hammer from falling and the gun from firing.|$|R
50|$|The Damon {{system of}} {{orthodontics}} {{is one of}} many fixed, passive, self-ligating methods of correcting malocclusions. Passive self-ligating systems use brackets that do not require elastic o-rings to hold the wires in place. By not using the elastic o-rings, it is said that the wires freely <b>slide</b> through the <b>slots</b> without friction. However, this may not be correct as it allows more rotation or tipping of teeth (and therefore some potential loss of precision of movement) before the bracket edges contact the wire, resulting in friction. It is believed that not using o-rings results in better oral hygiene but the research is equivocal, with findings both for and against the theory. To hold the wires in place, the Damon System uses small sliding doors. The addition of 'stops' on the wires helps prevent the wire from becoming displaced from its intended location.|$|R
40|$|Alert {{correlation}} is {{a process}} that analyzes the alerts produced by one or more intrusion detection systems and provides a more succinct and high-level view of occurring or attempted intrusions. Several alert correlation systems use pairwise alert correlation in which each new alert is checked with a number of previously received alerts to find its possible correlations with them. An alert selection policy defines the way in which this checking is done. There are different alert selection policies such as select all, window-based random selection and random directed selection. The most important drawback of all these policies is their high computational costs. In this paper a new selection policy which is named Enhanced Random Directed Time Window (ERDTW) is introduced.
