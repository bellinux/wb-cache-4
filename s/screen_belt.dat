50|$|Following Robert's {{successful}} model, {{built in}} 1798, Saint-Léger Didot insisted that Robert {{apply for a}} patent. Prior to 1798, paper was made one sheet at a time, by dipping a rectangular frame or mould with a screen bottom into a vat of pulp. The frame {{was removed from the}} vat, and the water was pressed out of the pulp. The remaining pulp was allowed to dry; the frame could not be re-used until the previous sheet of paper was removed from it. Robert's construction had a moving <b>screen</b> <b>belt</b> that would receive a continuous flow of stock and deliver an unbroken sheet of wet paper to a pair of squeeze rolls. As the continuous strip of wet paper came off the machine it was manually hung over a series of cables or bars to dry. With Didot's urging, Robert and Didot went to François de Neufchâteau, the Minister of the Interior and applied for a patent. In 1799, the patent (brevet d'invention) was granted by the French Government, for which Robert paid 8,000 francs.|$|E
40|$|In a Fourdrinier paper machine, {{the fiber}} and water mixture flows to a wire-screen belt. As the wire-screen belt travels horizontally, water is drained through the screen, leaving the fibers on top. In some {{operating}} conditions large vertical vibrations of the wire-screen belt occur. The mechanism {{of this phenomenon}} is investigated experimentally. Analytical study is also done, which shows qualitative agreement with the experiment results.

50|$|Sifting technologyis practiced on {{dry sand}} and soft surfaces. The sand and waste are {{collected}} via the pick-up blade {{of the vehicle}} onto a vibrating <b>screening</b> <b>belt,</b> which leaves the sand behind. The waste is gathered in a collecting tray which is often situated {{at the back of}} the vehicle. Because sand and waste are lifted onto the <b>screening</b> <b>belt,</b> sifters must allow time for the sand to sift through the screen and back onto the beach. The size of the materials removed is governed by the size of the holes in the installed screen.|$|R

30|$|Traditionally, {{recycled}} PET has {{not been}} widely used for filament production because of contaminants leading to breakage of the filament. Melt filtration of the PET is carried out to achieve high quality of the resin. Nonwoven fabrics, used as filters and absorbents, are prepared by spun bounding technology. In the production of recycled PET, nonwoven, cleaned PET bottle flake is dried, crystallized and incorporated into the extruder. The melt-spun filaments are spread and distributed on a <b>screen</b> <b>belt</b> under strong vacuum, and the fibrous materials are compressed into a mat for web-forming. Fiberfill is utilized for various applications such as filling materials and insulant in sleeping bags, pillows, and bedding. These applications allow the use of colored PET flake and require PET with intrinsic viscosity {{in the range of}} 0.58 - 0.65 dlg− 1.|$|E

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The method comprises subjecting a fermentation residue I (3) occurring from a biogas production plant with a fermenter (2) to a solid-liquid-separation, subjecting a liquid phase (6) of the fermentation residue I to a process for enlarging the solid surface and for removing dissolved gases, supplying the resulting product to the fermenter of the biogas production plant and/or to a further fermenter, where a fermentation residue II is resulted in the case of supplying the product to the further fermenter, feeding the resulting fermentation residue II to a hydrolysis process step, the fermenter of the biogas production plant and/or a final disposal site or to a further fermenter, which realizes the process for enlarging the solid surface and for removing dissolved gases next to the fermentation, subjecting the resulting fermentation residue II partially to the process for enlarging the solid surface and for removing dissolved gases, and feeding the process product to the further fermenter, the hydrolysis process step, the fermenter of the biogas production plant and/or the final disposal site. The fermentation residue II is subjected to a mechanical solid-liquid-separation in a screw press, <b>screen</b> <b>belt</b> press, decanter centrifuge, membrane filter press, chamber filter press and oscillating sieve (4). A separation grade of 30 mu m to 3 mm is realized with the oscillating sieve. The liquid phase is subjected to a mechanical crushing and/or an ultrasound treatment. The mechanical crushing is carried out by a rotor-stator-system e. g. shear gap homogenizer. A peripheral speed of the rotor of 10 - 50 m/s is realized with the rotor-stator-system. The ultrasound treatment is carried out with a frequency of 16 - 1000 kHz. The products of the process steps for enlarging the solid surface and for removing dissolved gases are fed to a further fermenter that is separated from the biogas production plant. The products in the separated fermenter are subjected to a biological degradation under anaerobic conditions within 6 hours to 5 days in the fermenter, and then the products are supplied to the hydrolysis process step of the biogas production plant. The viscous material (5) from the solid-liquid separation is fed to the final disposal site. The flow speeds of the liquid phases are realized to 0. 005 - 2 m/s. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a device for continuously treating biogenic materials for producing biogas. USE - Method for continuously treating biogenic materials for producing biogas, where the biogenic materials are renewable raw material, sewage sludge, agricultural wastewater, disposal wastewater, wastewater from waste treatment plants, biogenic residual or waste products from food industry and/or agriculture (claimed). ADVANTAGE - The method ensures economical and efficient production of the biogas with high yield and high quality by increasing proportion of methane and reducing carbon dioxide and harmful hydrogen sulfide, and improves the efficiency of the fermentation process...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the design and}} operation of models I, II, and V. No report has been prepared on model III - the differences in design between it and model II were not great enough to warrant a separate report. Models IV and VI have been tested, and reports describing their features and operation are being prepared. The basic design for model I was taken from that developed by the Fisheries Research Board of Canada during an investigation with traveling cables and a chain. BCF experiments on model I indicated a need to eliminate the drag created by the screen as it returned upstream through the water. This change was accomplished in model II by raising the screen clear of the water on its return upstream. Model III, installed and tested within the Maxwell Canal (Hermiston, Oreg.) during 1966, had some improvements over model II, particularly in design of the carriage, track, and drive systems. The step from model III to IV was significant {{from the standpoint of}} design and size of structure - the carriage and track systems were drastically changed, and the screen had to be made larger and stronger to handle flows that were 10 times greater than those handled by model III. Model V represented a complete change in design and incorporated such features as a cable-suspension support structure, cantilevered screen panels to resist water forces, and replaceable panels in lieu of continuous <b>screen</b> <b>belting...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe Northeastern U. S. has {{the ideal}} {{location}} and {{unique opportunity to}} be a leader in cold water marine finfish aquaculture. However, problems and regulations on environmental issues, mandatory stocking of 100 % native North American salmon, and disease have impacted economic viability of the U. S. salmon industry. In response to these problems, the USDA ARS developed the National Cold Water Marine Aquaculture Center (NCWMAC) in Franklin, Maine. The NCWMAC is adjacent to the University of Maine Center for Cooperative Aquaculture Research on the shore of Taunton Bay and shares essential infrastructure to maximize efficiency. Facilities are used to conduct research on Atlantic salmon and other cold water marine finfish species. The initial research focus for the Franklin location is to develop a comprehensive Atlantic salmon breeding program from native North American fish stocks leading to the development and release of genetically improved salmon to commercial producers. The Franklin location has unique ground water resources to supply freshwater, brackish water, salt water or filtered seawater to fish culture tanks. Research facilities include office space, primary and secondary hygiene rooms, and research tank bays for culturing 200 + Atlantic salmon families with incubation, parr, smolt, on-grow, and broodstock tanks. Tank sizes are 0. 14 m 3 for parr, 9 m 3 for smolts, and 36, 46 and 90 m 3 for subadults and broodfish. Culture tanks are equipped with recirculating systems utilizing biological (fluidized sand) filtration, carbon dioxide stripping, supplemental oxygenation and ozonation, and ultraviolet sterilization. Water from the research facility discharges into a wastewater treatment building and passes through micro-screen drum filtration, an inclined traveling <b>belt</b> <b>screen</b> to exclude all eggs or fish from the discharge, and UV irradiation to disinfect the water. The facility was completed in June 2007, and all water used in the facility has been from groundwater sources. Mean facility discharge has been approximately 0. 50 m 3 /min (130 gpm). The facility was designed for stocking densities of 20 – 47 kg/m 3 and a maximum biomass of 26, 000 kg. The maximum system density obtained from June 2007 through January 2008 has approached 40 kg/m 3, maximum facility biomass was 11, 021 kg, water exchange rates have typically been 2 – 3 % of the recirculating system flow rate, and tank temperatures have ranged from a high of 15. 4 °C in July to a low of 6. 6 °C in January 2008 without supplemental heating or cooling...|$|R
40|$|Erosive slurry wear occurs {{extensively}} throughout minerals {{processing equipment}} for slurry transport applications. Wear resistant materials {{are designed to}} prolong the life of equipment used to transport the slurry such as pumps, hoses, grinders, conveyor <b>belts,</b> <b>screens,</b> etc. In this study, the erosive wear mechanisms of rubber pump lining materials used in slurry pumps were explored at a structural level. The erosive wear mechanisms for rubber pump lining materials have not be extensively investigated in the literature. Arnold and Hutchings [1] were the pioneers in this field of tribology, however, {{a number of key}} areas for study remain. Although the wear mechanisms of rubber wear in slurry erosion are well documented in the literature, the chemical degradation of the rubber during this erosive wear has not been investigated. Furthermore, the viscoelastic properties of the rubber and their correlation with erosive wear have not been well documented. The approach to {{this study was to investigate}} four different rubber compounds used in slurry transport pumps and determine the wear mechanisms and their correlation with physical, viscoelastic and chemical properties of the rubbers. A slurry jet erosion test was used to investigate the wear rate of each compound under different variables. The samples were then chemically analysed using a Fourier Transfer Infra Red (FT-IR) Spectrometer to determine the extent of chemical change to the surface of the rubber during erosive wear testing. The physical properties of the rubber were tested using conventional test methods, whereas a Rubber Process Analyser 2000 (RPA 2000) was used to determine the key viscoelastic properties. It was important to investigate these properties of the rubber compounds to determine which properties could be correlated with erosive wear. Through FT-IR analysis of heat aged samples of the rubber compounds, it was established that erosive slurry wear does not correlate with aging, however, heat aging influences the hardness, resilience and viscoelastic properties which increases the wear rate of the rubber compounds. The key findings from this study were that heat aging would increase the tan &# 948; and hardness, and lower the resilience, hence, causing lower erosive wear resistance in all the rubbers. Tan &# 948;, hardness and resilience could be correlated with erosive wear loss, the heat aging effect and the chemistry of the rubber compounds. The influence of the type of reinforcing filler and cure systems could also be correlated with erosive wear resistance. Rubbers with a high loading of reinforcing carbon black resulted in a low wear resistance in comparison to a high wear resistance for silica and silane filled rubber compounds. Tan &# 948; was also correlated with the type of reinforcing filler used in the rubber chemistry. The significance of these findings is important for the future design of rubber compounds used in slurry erosion wear resistant pump liners. For a highly slurry erosion wear resistant pump liner, a high resilience, low tan &# 948; and hardness (as are found in silica and silane reinforced rubber) would be required...|$|R
50|$|On 31 October 2007, the Administrative Board of the Port Authority {{nevertheless}} {{granted the}} internal {{approval for the}} 5 projects for the installation of cement dust plants and mega-silos on the city’s coast, without answering any {{of the thousands of}} oppositions filed and without any changes to the plans. The PSOE members on the Board voted against the projects, while the PP Mayor and his City Council representative on the Board abstained after calling on the PortAuthority to modify all the projects to lower the height of the buildings to within the 12 m maximum set out by the Special Plan for the Port. The Mayor also called on the Port Authority to seek an immediate solution to the clouds of dust occasioned by the open air unloading of cement in the port. The Administrative Board, however, passed by a majority the motion to pass the projects without modification to the City Councils Planning Department to decide whether construction licences should be granted for such projects so close to the city centre and to be built right in the centre of the city’s coastal strip. The vote of the Administration Board of the Port Authority, taken without responding first to any of the thousands of citizens’ objections, has increased and European environmentalists’ indignation.On 4 November 2007, the President of the Port Authority, Sergio Campos, gave an interview in the national press about the various problems and the local opposition encountered in relation to the new plans for Alicante port. He indicated that the biodiesel chemical plant may have to be located elsewhere (given that the City Council rejected the application for its construction licence because its 20-metre planned height exceeds the 12 m general limit for the port and {{due to the lack of}} studies and licences for the distribution by road of the end product). Campos also admitted that “the port’s concern for the environment is grows stronger day by day” in light of the pressure from the residents, the city, and local and national government, and recognised that “Alicante is a commercial port not an industrial port” but he insisted again that the mega-silos are necessary since they are a “relocation” of the 3 silos 8 m high in Quay 14. He also recognised publicly, for the first time, that at present “clinker cement dust and carbon are moved by grain and bulldozer, and that if there is a strong wind it is true that clouds of dust are produced”. He admitted that the measures set out in the 2003 environmental permission for the port (use of chutes, <b>screens,</b> closed conveyor <b>belts,</b> watering systems, taking measures to prohibit unloading on days of high wind, measuring dust particles in the air during unloading) had not been taken but he stated his “desire” to implement them in the future. He made it clear that these open-air activities are planned not only to continue but to grow in future, and that they are not being substituted by the plans for the mega-silos and cement dust plants.On 6 November 2007, the editorial of a local newspaper summed up the situation by stating that “What is clear is that once built, these silos for the storage of cement will substantially change the appearance of the city of Alicante, above all when viewed from the sea or from the coastal roads, and the projects will eclipse the Castle of Santa Barbara and the “Cara del Moro”, the historical symbols of Alicante city, relegating them to a secondary position”.|$|R
