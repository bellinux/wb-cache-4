40|$|ObjectiveEndovascular stents are {{accepted}} therapy for iliac artery stenoses and occlusions. Surgery is the recommended therapy {{for patients with}} severe iliac artery disease, including those with the combination of ipsilateral common iliac artery (CIA) and external iliac artery (EIA) stenoses/occlusions. This study compared patient outcomes, including late open conversion rates, for combined ipsilateral CIA and EIA stenting vs CIA or EIA stents alone. MethodsBetween 1998 and 2010, 588 patients underwent iliac artery stenting at two institutions. Patient comorbidities and outcomes were retrospectively reviewed, and analyses were performed using multivariate regression and Kaplan-Meier methods. ResultsThere were 436 extremities with CIA stents, 195 with EIA stents, and 157 with CIA and EIA stents. The {{groups did not differ}} significantly in demographics, comorbidities, or treatment indications. During follow-up, 183 patients died, 95 underwent an endovascular reintervention, and 48 required late open conversion. For patients in the CIA or EIA stent group, the mean ± standard error <b>survival</b> <b>was</b> 5. 3 ± 0. 3 years, secondary endovascular intervention-free <b>survival</b> <b>was</b> 7. 4 ± 0. 6 years, late open conversion-free <b>survival</b> <b>was</b> 9. 8 ± 0. 4 years, and amputation-free <b>survival</b> <b>was</b> 7. 6 ± 0. 4 years. In the CIA and EIA stent group, <b>survival</b> <b>was</b> 6. 1 ± 0. 6 years, secondary endovascular intervention-free <b>survival</b> <b>was</b> 7. 2 ± 0. 6 years, late open conversion-free <b>survival</b> <b>was</b> 9. 0 ± 1. 1 years, and amputation-free <b>survival</b> <b>was</b> 8. 4 ± 0. 5 years. Survival, reintervention-free survival, late open conversion-free survival, and amputation-free <b>survival</b> <b>were</b> all similar between patient groups (all P >. 05).

5|$|A {{study of}} coastal heaths on Pleistocene sand dunes around the Myall Lakes found B.aemula grew on ridges (dry heath) and B. oblongifolia on slopes (wet heath), {{and the two}} species did not overlap. Manipulation of {{seedlings}} in the same study area showed that B. aemula grows longer roots seeking water and that seedlings do grow in wet heath, but it is as yet unclear why the species does not grow in wet heath as well as dry heath. Unlike similar situations with banksia species in Western Australia, the two species {{did not appear to}} impact negatively on each other. A field study on seedling recruitment conducted at Broadwater National Park and Dirrawong Reserve on the New South Wales North Coast showed that generally Banksia aemula produced seedlings in low numbers but the attrition rate was low, and that seedlings had a greater survival rate on dry rather than wet heaths. Field work including the experimental planting out of seedlings at Crowdy Bay National Park showed that Banksia aemula seedling roots reach the water table within six months of germination, and that they can germinate in {{the presence or absence of}} recent bushfire. The reasons for bradyspory (that is fewer seeds with greater percentage of <b>survival)</b> <b>is</b> unclear, but may be a defence against seed-eating animals. Similarly in field work on North Stradbroke Island, B.aemula was noted to shed its winged seeds over time between (as well as after) fire, and germinate and grow readily with little predation by herbivores.|$|E
5|$|Ash {{accumulation}} {{will also}} affect pasture, plants and trees which {{are part of}} the horticulture and agriculture industries. Thin ash falls (<20 mm) may put livestock off eating, and can inhibit transpiration and photosynthesis and alter growth. There may be an increase in pasture production due to a mulching effect and slight fertilizing effect, such as occurred following the 1980 Mount St. Helens and 1995/96 Mt Ruapehu eruptions. Heavier falls will completely bury pastures and soil leading to death of pasture and sterilization of the soil due to oxygen deprivation. Plant <b>survival</b> <b>is</b> dependent on ash thickness, ash chemistry, compaction of ash, amount of rainfall, duration of burial and the length of plant stalks at the time of ash fall. The acidic nature of ash will lead to elevated soil sulfur levels and lowered soil pH, which can reduce the availability of essential minerals and alter the soil’s characteristics so that crops and plants will not survive. Ash will also impact upon arable crops, such as fruit, vegetables and grain. Ash can burn plant and crop tissue reducing quality, contaminate crops during harvest and damage plants from ash loading.|$|E

5|$|Christian apologist and philosopher Alvin Plantinga, a {{supporter}} of intelligent design, has formalized and revised the improbability argument as the evolutionary argument against naturalism, which asserts that it is irrational to reject a supernatural, intelligent creator because the apparent probability of certain faculties evolving is so low. Specifically, Plantinga claims that evolution cannot account for the rise of reliable reasoning faculties. Plantinga argues that whereas a God {{would be expected to}} create beings with reliable reasoning faculties, evolution would be just as likely to lead to unreliable ones, meaning that if evolution is true, it is irrational to trust whatever reasoning one relies on to conclude that it is true. This novel epistemological argument has been criticized similarly to other probabilistic design arguments.

5|$|HTT is {{expressed}} in all mammalian cells. The highest concentrations {{are found in the}} brain and testes, with moderate amounts in the liver, heart, and lungs. The function of HTT in humans is unclear. It interacts with proteins which are involved in transcription, cell signaling, and intracellular transporting. In animals genetically modified to exhibit HD, several functions of HTT have been found. In these animals, HTT is important for embryonic development, as its absence is related to embryonic death. Caspase, an enzyme which plays a role in catalyzing apoptosis, is thought to be activated by the mutated gene through damaging the ubiquitin-protease system. It also acts as an anti-apoptotic agent preventing programmed cell death and controls the production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, a protein which protects neurons and regulates their creation during neurogenesis. HTT also facilitates vesicular transport and synaptic transmission and controls neuronal gene transcription. If the expression of HTT is increased and more HTT produced, brain cell <b>survival</b> <b>is</b> improved and the effects of mHTT are reduced, whereas when the expression of HTT is reduced, the resulting characteristics are more typical of the presence of mHTT. In humans the disruption of the normal gene does not cause the disease. It is thought that the disease is not caused by inadequate production of HTT, but by a gain of toxic function of mHTT.|$|E
5|$|Optimum {{growth of}} E. coli occurs at 37°C (98.6°F), but some {{laboratory}} strains can multiply at temperatures up to 49°C (120°F). E. coli {{grows in a}} variety of defined laboratory media, such as lysogeny broth, or any medium that contains glucose, ammonium phosphate, monobasic, sodium chloride, magnesium sulfate, potassium phosphate, dibasic, and water. Growth can be driven by aerobic or anaerobic respiration, using a large variety of redox pairs, including the oxidation of pyruvic acid, formic acid, hydrogen, and amino acids, and the reduction of substrates such as oxygen, nitrate, fumarate, dimethyl sulfoxide, and trimethylamine N-oxide. E. coli is classified as a facultative anaerobe. It uses oxygen when it is present and available. It can, however, continue to grow in the absence of oxygen using fermentation or anaerobic respiration. The ability to continue growing in the absence of oxygen is an advantage to bacteria because their <b>survival</b> <b>is</b> increased in environments where water predominates.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Relative {{survival}} estimates cancer {{survival in}} the absence of other causes of death. Previous work has shown that standard errors of non-standardised relative <b>survival</b> may <b>be</b> substantially overestimated by the conventionally used method. However, evidence was restricted to non-standardised relative survival estimates using Hakulinen’s method. Here, we provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the accuracy of standard errors including age-standardised survival and estimation by the Ederer II method. METHODS: Five- and ten-year non-standardised and age-standardised relative <b>survival</b> <b>was</b> estimated for patients diagnosed with 25 common forms of cancer in Finland in 1989 – 1993, using data from the nationwide Finnish Cancer Registry.

40|$|Introduction:Management of {{pulmonary}} metastasis of non-small cell {{lung cancer}} (NSCLC) remains controversial. We reviewed our surgical treatment for pulmonary metastasis of NSCLC. Methods:Seventy-six patients with pulmonary metastasis of NSCLC underwent pulmonary resections in two institutes {{during the past}} 10 years. Eighteen patients with simultaneous same lobe metastasis as the primary lesion underwent mostly lobectomies. Sixteen patients with simultaneous different lobe metastasis underwent combined margin-free resections. Forty-nine pulmonary metastasectomies were performed in 42 patients with recurrent lung cancer. Overall survival and disease-free survival in each group were examined, and factors affecting <b>survivals</b> <b>were</b> investigated. Results:In the patients with the same lobe metastasis 5 -year <b>survival</b> <b>was</b> 79. 6 %, and median and 5 -year disease-free <b>survivals</b> <b>were</b> 39. 1 months and 41. 3 %. In the patients with simultaneous different lobe metastasis median survival and 5 -year <b>survival</b> <b>were</b> 37. 7 months and 30. 7 %, and median and 5 -year disease-free <b>survivals</b> <b>were</b> 13. 3 months and 12. 5 %, respectively.

5|$|The {{northern}} mockingbird is {{a species that}} is found in both urban and rural habitats. There are now more {{northern mockingbird}}s living in urban habitats than non-urban environments, so they are consequently known as an urban-positive species. Biologists have long questioned how northern mockingbirds adapt to a novel environment in cities, and whether they fall into the typical ecological traps that are common for urban-dwelling birds. A comparative study between an urban dwelling population and a rural dwelling one shows that the apparent <b>survival</b> <b>is</b> higher for individuals in the urban habitats. Lower food availability and travel costs {{may account for the}} higher mortality rate in rural habitats. Urban birds are more likely to return to the nest where they had successfully bred the previous year and avoid those where breeding success was low. One explanation for this phenomenon is that urban environments are more predictable than non-urban ones, as the site fidelity among urban birds prevents them from ecological traps. Mockingbirds are also able to utilize artificial lighting in order to feed nestlings in urban areas such as residential neighborhoods into the night in contrast to those that do not nest near those areas. The adaptation of mockingbirds in urban habitats has led it to become more susceptible to lead poisoning in Baltimore and Washington, D.C. populations.|$|E

Feathertail’s brother Stormfur and the ThunderClan apprentice Squirrelpaw also accompany them. After a long journey, the group discover a lake {{that they can use}} as their new territory, which they name ‘sun-drown-place.’ Whilst journeying back to report their finding to the Clans, the travelling cats meet a new community called The Tribe of Rushing Water, who are being terrorized by a mountain lion. Feathertail sacrifices her life to kill the mountain lion and save the Tribe. The remaining cats return to their Clans and relay the message. Together, the four Clans travel to their new territory, although many cats perish along the way. During this journey, the boundaries between the Clans begin to blur. Crowfeather (formerly Crowpaw) falls in love with the ThunderClan medicine cat Leafpool; however, as they are from different Clans, they are forbidden from being together. Additionally, Leafpool’s status as a medicine cat dictates she can never have a mate or give birth to kits. They decide to secretly run away together, but return when the ThunderClan camp is attacked by badgers. Leafpool’s mentor, Cinderpelt, dies in the battle, and Leafpool decides that she must remain with her Clan. Meanwhile, Brambleclaw is torn between his loyalty to his Clan and his loyalty to his dead father. He dreams of one day becoming Clan deputy, an ambition that is heightened when he discovers that his father, Tigerstar, can visit him in his dreams. Furthermore, Brambleclaw learns that he has a RiverClan half-brother named Hawkfrost. The two grow close, much to the disdain of Squirrelflight (formerly Squirrelpaw). However, Hawkfrost’s bloodthirsty nature is revealed when he traps the ThunderClan leader Firestar, and orders Brambleclaw to murder him. Brambleclaw instead kills Hawkfrost. In return, Firestar accepts the young warrior for who he is, and Brambleclaw is appointed the new deputy of ThunderClan. He later begins a relationship with Squirrelflight.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Radiotherapy (RT) with {{or without}} {{chemotherapy}} (CT) {{plays an important role}} as exclusive treatment in patients with head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC). Unfortunately, in some cases, benefit for patients is not recorded and only treatment-related complications are registered. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data relating to Akt 1 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and response to treatment of 46 patients treated with exclusive RT or RT-CT for HNSCC were evaluated. RESULTS: For heterozygous patients median overall <b>survival</b> <b>was</b> 28. 5 months, while for the wild-type group median overall <b>survival</b> <b>was</b> 10. 9 (p= 0. 019). Three-year <b>survival</b> <b>was</b> 85...|$|R
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the first year}} survival of sagebrush seedlings planted as compensatory mitigation for the Integrated Disposal Facility Project. Approximately 42, 600 bare root seedlings and 26, 000 pluglings were planted at a mitigation site along Army Loop Road in February 2007. Initial baseline monitoring occurred in March 2007, and first summer <b>survival</b> <b>was</b> assessed in September 2007. Overall <b>survival</b> <b>was</b> 19 %, with bare root survival being marginally better than pluglings (21 % versus 14 %). Likely major factors contributing to low <b>survival</b> <b>were</b> late season planting and insufficient soil moisture during seedling establishment...|$|R
