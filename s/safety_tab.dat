50|$|The Dilagrama {{basically}} {{consists of}} a grenade adapter that fits {{the barrel of the}} G3. It is based on the US militarys M1A2 Grenade Adapter, a modified M1 Grenade Adapter used with the M26-series Defensive Grenade. The adapter {{consists of a}} 3-pronged bracket for holding and securing the grenade (with the lever held down by a breakaway <b>safety</b> <b>tab</b> on the third prong), the tubular body for fitting to the launcher, and the tailfin assembly. The Dilagrama is launched with the use of special blank ammunition. The <b>safety</b> <b>tab</b> holding the grenades arming lever breaks away when launched, arming the grenade in mid-air. Depending on the range, the grenade will then either air-burst over the target or impact and then detonate.|$|E
50|$|When {{drilling}} a fastener, {{the choice}} of where to drill {{it depends on the}} type of fastener and to what it will be wired. The alternative to drilling holes in fasteners is to use <b>safety</b> wire <b>tabs</b> (see <b>Safety</b> wire <b>tabs</b> section below), or to purchase pre-drilled fasteners.|$|R
50|$|The 2002 Australian Winter Paralympic {{team had}} an {{extensive}} list of sponsors, including the Australian Sports Commission, Energy Australia, Fforesite, the Motor Accident Authority, Telstra, Workcover NSW, Workcover <b>Safety</b> Victoria, <b>TAB,</b> Clubs NSW, Yakka, and Rogen.|$|R
50|$|<b>Safety</b> wire <b>tabs</b> are washers {{that are}} used to secure {{fasteners}} by transferring the force of the safety wire {{to the head of the}} fastener to be secured. They are installed just like any other washer, after which the sides of the tab are bent up to make contact with the sides of the head of the fastener. One side of the tab is longer than the other with a small hole at the top, through which safety wire is threaded. Once the Safety Wire is properly installed, the sides of the tab transfer the force of the safety wire to the fastener, as though the fastener itself had been drilled and had the safety wire run though it.|$|R
50|$|The {{advantage}} of <b>safety</b> wire <b>tabs</b> {{is that the}} fastener to be secured {{does not need to}} be drilled, which can be advantageous for fasteners that should not or cannot be drilled because of size or damage concerns. They can also be useful when a fastener needs to be replaced, the replacement is not already drilled, and circumstances do not afford the time or tools to properly prepare the replacement fastener. The disadvantages are that it adds extra distance between the head of the fastener and the surface to which it is to be secured, and it is not as secure as securing the wire directly to the fastener itself as the tab could be a point of failure if it somehow unbends or the hole breaks (which is more likely than the hole in a drilled fastener failing due to the thinness and malleability of the material from which it is made).|$|R
