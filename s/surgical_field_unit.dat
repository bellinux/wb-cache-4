50|$|Medical staff, {{who were}} {{involved}} early in the planning of the invasion of Italy, developed a plan to evacuate casualties back to the landing beaches where additional clearing stations and <b>field</b> <b>surgical</b> <b>units,</b> as well as special beach medical sections would be located. These would be available {{for the care of}} the casualties until they could be evacuated by landing craft to Sicily itself or to nearby hospital ships. The units which would put this plan into effect included a field ambulance accompanying each brigade, two <b>field</b> <b>surgical</b> <b>units,</b> a <b>field</b> dressing station and a <b>field</b> transfusion <b>unit.</b> Their role was to set up an advanced surgical center near the advanced dressing station in Reggio. All of the remaining divisional medical resources were to have crossed to Italy by D-Day +7. In addition, plans were made for landing strips to be made available and prioritization of those casualties who might require air transport.|$|R

50|$|The Canadians {{landed on}} 3 September 1943 with {{negligible}} opposition and secured their objectives {{by the end}} of the day. The first casualty to be treated by 4 Field Ambulance in Italy was on 7 September when the unit was set up in Delianuova along with No. 1 <b>Field</b> <b>Surgical</b> <b>Unit</b> and No. 1 <b>Field</b> Transfusion <b>Unit.</b> On 8 September the surrender of Italy was announced. At this time the Canadian axis of advance was moving mainly to the east coast road and soon Locri was in 3rd Brigade hands. By the 13th the Unit moved into Marina di Catanzaro and were joined by their rear-party with additional vehicles and equipment. This brought them up to war establishment for the first time since the original landing.|$|R
5000|$|In the United States Army, Medical Detachments (Forward Surgical), {{popularly known}} as Forward Surgical Teams (FST), are small, mobile <b>surgical</b> <b>units</b> <b>fielded</b> since the 1990s. FSTs are {{utilized}} {{in a variety of}} ways, and can fielded with support elements, including a Forward Support Medical Company (FSMC), Area Support Medical Company (ASMC), Brigade Medical Company also known as C-Med or in some cases stand alone (although The FST is not designed, staffed, or equipped for standaloneoperations or for conducting sick-call operations.Augmentation requirements are discussed in FM 4-02.25) to provide a surgical capability at Role 2 for those patients unable to survive MEDEVAC to Role 3 (hospital) care. Surgeons perform damage control surgery on combat casualties within the [...] "golden hour" [...] of injury whenever possible. Casualties can then be packaged for medical evacuation to a higher level of care. The FST typically includes 20 staff members: 4 surgeons, 3 RNs, 2 certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs), 1 administrative officer, 1 detachment sergeant, 3 licensed practical nurses (LPN)'s, 3 surgical techs and 3 medics.|$|R
40|$|Background: Reduction of {{intraoperative}} bleeding {{is necessary}} to achieve the ideal <b>surgical</b> <b>field</b> for the endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS). Intraoperative intra nasal bleeding is influenced by various anesthetics. This study compared <b>surgical</b> <b>field</b> condition between propofol/remifentanil (PR) based anesthesia and desflurane/remifentanil (DR) based anesthesia. Methods: American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status class I or II patients undergoing ESS {{were randomly assigned to}} group PR (n = 36) or group DR (n = 32). The extent of the preoperative surgical lesion was classified as high (> 12) and low (≤ 12) Lund-Mackay (LM) scores according to the computed tomography findings. The target mean blood pressure was maintained at 70 - 80 mmHg. Only one surgeon was involved in rating the visibility of the <b>surgical</b> <b>field</b> on a numeric rating scale (NRS) every 10 minutes. Results: There was a different <b>surgical</b> <b>field</b> grade from PR to DR. The mean (SD) <b>surgical</b> <b>field</b> score of NRS for the PR and DR was 2. 3 (0. 57) and 2. 7 (0. 67), respectively (P = 0. 006). Especially in the high-LM score patients, the mean (SD) of <b>surgical</b> <b>field</b> score for the PR and DR was 2. 4 (0. 67) and 3. 0 (0. 63), respectively (P = 0. 012). Conclusions: In the high-LM score patients, PR based anesthesia resulted in better <b>surgical</b> <b>field</b> condition for ESS than DR based anesthesia. In ESS, PR based anesthesia is considered to be helpful. (Korean J Anesthesiol 2012; 63...|$|R

40|$|Heater-cooler units (HCUs) were {{recently}} {{identified as a}} source of Mycobacterium chimaera causing surgical site infections. We investigated transmission of this bacterium from HCUs to the <b>surgical</b> <b>field</b> by using a thermic anemometer and particle counter, videotape of an operating room equipped with an ultraclean laminar airflow ventilation system, and bacterial culture sedimentation plates in a nonventilated room. Smoke from the HCU reached the <b>surgical</b> <b>field</b> in 23 s by merging with ultraclean air. The HCU produced on average 5. 2, 139, and 14. 8 particles/min in the <b>surgical</b> <b>field</b> at positions Off, On/oriented toward, and On/oriented away, respectively. Culture plates were positive for M. chimaera < 5 m from the HCU in the test room. These experiments confirm airborne transmission of M. chimaera aerosols from a contaminated HCU to an open <b>surgical</b> <b>field</b> despite ultraclean air ventilation. Efforts to mitigate infectious risks during surgery should consider contamination from water sources and airflow-generating devices. 27070958 PMC 488007...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Since {{the advent}} of endonasal skull base surgery, {{internal}} carotid artery (ICA) injury has been considered the most dramatic and challenging intraoperative complication. A large vascular injury creates an immediately challenging surgical scenario with rapid blood loss that may result in exsanguination of the patient. Recently we have developed an animal model of the endoscopic, endonasal vascular injury. We describe important surgical steps required in managing the <b>surgical</b> <b>field</b> during a catastrophic vascular event. Methods: A total of 42 endoscopic carotid artery injuries and 25 endoscopic venous injuries were performed. Throughout the injuries, the "two-surgeon" technique was used to achieve <b>surgical</b> <b>field</b> control. Videoendoscopy was performed throughout the implementation of these surgical techniques. Results: Techniques found useful in controlling the <b>surgical</b> <b>field</b> included the two-surgeon technique, careful selection of the most appropriate nostril for endoscope positioning, large bore suction placement, suction guidance of the vascular stream through the contralateral nostril, and avoidance of suction obstruction. Only once the <b>surgical</b> <b>field</b> could be controlled can the injury site be addressed. Conclusions: Controlling the endoscopic endonasal <b>surgical</b> <b>field</b> during vascular injuries relies on {{the cooperation of the}} surgical team and a step-based approach including careful endoscopic maneuvering within the nasal corridor, and appropriate suction selection and positioning with respect to the endoscope.

40|$|Background and Aims: Endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) {{provides}} a challenge {{and an opportunity}} to the anesthesiologists to prove their mettle and give the surgeons a <b>surgical</b> <b>field</b> which can make their delicate surgery safer,more precise and faster. The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate the <b>surgical</b> <b>field</b> and the rate of blood loss in patients premedicated with oral clonidine versus oral diazepam for endoscopic sinus surgery. Material and Methods: ASA I or II patients who were scheduled to undergo ESS were randomly allocated to group D (n = 30) or group C (n = 30). The patients′ vital parameters, propofol infusion rate, and rate of blood loss were observed and calculated. The surgeon, who was blinded, rated the visibility of the <b>surgical</b> <b>field</b> from grade 0 - 5. Results: In the clonidine group, the rate of blood loss, the surgical time, propofol infusion rate was found to be statistically lower as compared to the diazepam group. Also a higher number of patients in the clonidine group had a better surgical score (better <b>surgical</b> <b>field)</b> than the diazepam group and vice versa.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Bleeding during {{endoscopic}} sinus surgery (ESS) {{may increase}} complications and negatively effect the surgery and its outcome. The {{aim of this}} study was to compare the <b>surgical</b> <b>field</b> in patients in whom total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) is used as opposed to inhalation anesthesia. A prospective randomized controlled trial was performed. METHODS: Fifty-six patients undergoing ESS were randomly assigned to receive either inhaled sevoflurane with incremental doses of fentanyl (n = 28) or TIVA via a propofol and remifentanil infusion (n = 28) for their general anesthesia. The <b>surgical</b> <b>field</b> was graded every 15 minutes using a validated scoring system. RESULTS: The two groups were matched for surgical procedure and computed tomography scores. Patients in the TIVA group were found to have a significantly lower surgical grade score than in the sevoflurane group (p < 0. 001). Surgical grade score increased with time in both groups. Mean arterial pressure and pulse were found to influence the <b>surgical</b> <b>field</b> independently (p = 0. 003 and p = 0. 036 respectively). Mean <b>surgical</b> <b>field</b> grade scores were higher in the patients with allergic fungal sinusitis and nasal polyposis as opposed to chronic rhinosinusitis without polyps or fungus. Lund-Mackay computed tomography scores were found to correlate positively with surgical grade (Spearman rank correlation, p = 0. 001). CONCLUSION: In patients undergoing ESS, TIVA results in a better <b>surgical</b> <b>field</b> than inhalational anesthesia...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{effect of}} {{tranexamic}} acid (TXA) on bleeding and improvement of <b>surgical</b> <b>field</b> during functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) {{is not clear}} yet. This {{study was conducted to}} answer this question. Methods: This trial was conducted on 60 patients with chronic sinusitis at Beasat Hospital, Hamadan, Iran, from April to November 2013. Thirty patients in the intervention group received three pledgets soaked with TXA 5 % and phenylephrine 0. 5 % for 10 minutes in each nasal cavity before surgery. Thirty patients in the control group received phenylephrine 0. 5 % with the same way. The amount of bleeding and the quality of <b>surgical</b> <b>field</b> were evaluated at 15, 30, and 45 minutes after the start of surgery using Boezaart grading. Results: The quality of the <b>surgical</b> <b>field</b> in the intervention group compared to the control group was significantly better in the first quarter (P = 0. 002) and the second quarter (P = 0. 003) but not in the third quarter (P = 0. 163). Furthermore, the amount of bleeding was much less during all periods in the intervention group than in the control group (P = 0. 001). Conclusion: Topical TXA can efficiently reduce bleeding and improve the <b>surgical</b> <b>field</b> in FESS in patients with rhinosinusitis. Based on these findings, topical TXA may be a useful method for providing a suitable <b>surgical</b> <b>field</b> during th...|$|R

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of pterygopalatine fossa infiltration with lidocaine and adrenalin on bleeding in the <b>surgical</b> <b>field</b> during endoscopic sinus surgery. Methods: A prospective blind randomized controlled trial was performed. Fifty-five patients were randomized to receive a unilateral transoral infiltration of the pterygopalatine fossa with 2 mL of 2 % lidocaine and 1 : 80, 000 adrenalin. The operating surgeon was blinded as to which side had been infiltrated at the start of surgery. The <b>surgical</b> <b>field</b> was graded on a previously validated <b>surgical</b> <b>field</b> grading scale every 15 minutes with the side being operated on alternated every 30 minutes. The pulse, mean arterial blood pressure, and endtidal CO 2 concentration were monitored with each <b>surgical</b> <b>field</b> observation. Results: At each individual time point from 30 minutes to 3. 5 hours there was a significant difference in surgical grade between injected and noninjected sides in favor of the injected side (p = 0. 01). The difference between surgical grades averaged across all time points was slight but significant. The injected side had an overall mean of 2. 59 (SE, 0. 22) compared with 2. 99 (SE, 0. 23) for the noninjected side. Heart rate also was found to correlate independently to surgical grade. Conclusion: Injection of the pterygopalatine fossa resulted in an improved <b>surgical</b> <b>field</b> during endoscopic sinus surgery.

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} whether orally administered steroids might improve <b>surgical</b> <b>field</b> conditions during functional endoscopic sinus surgery. Methods: Total blood loss and visualization of the <b>surgical</b> <b>field</b> during the <b>surgical</b> procedure were compared in 2 groups of 18 patients each with severe nasal polyposis. The groups were similar in respect to age, body mass index, general health status, incidence of allergy, bronchial asthma, aspirin triad, and stage of disease. One group received 30 mg of prednisone daily for 5 consecutive days before the operation. The second group served as a control. Results: Although the total blood loss was only slightly less in the steroid group, the visual conditions of the <b>surgical</b> <b>field</b> improved significantly. Conclusions: Better <b>surgical</b> <b>field</b> conditions were the results of the powerful anti-inflammatory and antiedematous activity of the drug, which facilitated blood and secretion evacuation from the operated area and prevented the optic system from staining.

40|$|Program/Poster no. 888. 6 /VV 8 The <b>surgical</b> <b>field</b> {{is often}} {{obscured}} {{with blood and}} debris during an operation. In addition, clearing debris from the <b>surgical</b> <b>field</b> usually requires irrigating the site with saline. Saline is only a temporary solution {{and needs to be}} continuously applied to maintain a clear <b>surgical</b> <b>field.</b> This poses several issues: 1) Any contamination in existence will easily spread; 2) a small opening will require alternating between irrigation and operating and 3) during neural operations movement of liquid can result in a massive infection leading to post-operative complications.

40|$|Background and Aims: Most vital {{aspect of}} Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (ESS) is an optimal {{visibility}} in the <b>surgical</b> <b>field.</b> This invariably requires controlled hypotension to facilitate surgical dissection and to decrease operative time. We used esmolol and magnesium sulfate to achieve controlled hypotension and assessed {{the quality of}} the <b>surgical</b> <b>field</b> in ESS. Material and Methods: A total of 30 patients undergoing ESS, were enrolled in three parallel groups of 10 patients each in a prospective randomized double-blind study. “Magnesium Sulfate group” received magnesium sulfate 40 mg/kg intravenously (i. v.) as a bolus over 10 min before induction of anesthesia, followed by 15 - 30 mg/kg/h through infusion. “Esmolol group” received 0. 5 mg/kg i. v. bolus over 10 min after induction followed by 150 - 300 μg/kg/min infusion and “control group” received normal saline in same volume schedule. The primary aim was to assess the quality of <b>surgical</b> <b>field,</b> using Fromme scale. Category Scale values of all the three groups were compared using Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance (ANOVA) test. Hemodynamic data was compared using ANOVA test.

Recent {{studies suggest that}} α 2 agonists could provide desired <b>surgical</b> <b>field,</b> sedation and analgesia. The present study was aimed to evaluate the clinical effects of dexmedetomidine infusion as anaesthetic adjuvant during middle ear surgery using operating microscope. Methods: Sixty four adult patients aged 18 - 58 years, American Society of Anaesthesiologists Grades I and II, of both gender were randomised into two comparable equal groups of 32 patients each for middle ear surgery under general anaesthesia with standard anaesthetic technique. After induction of general anaesthesia, patients of Group I were given dexmedetomidine infusion of 0. 5 μg/kg/h and patients of Group II were given placebo infusion of normal saline. Isoflurane concentration was titrated to achieve a systolic blood pressure 30 % below the baseline value. All patients were assessed intra-operatively for bleeding at <b>surgical</b> <b>field,</b> haemodynamic changes, awakening time and post-operative recovery. Results: Statistically significant reduction was observed in the required percentage of isoflurane (0. 8 ± 0. 6 %) to maintain the systolic blood pressure 30 % below the baseline values in patients receiving dexmedetomidine infusion when compared to those receiving placebo infusion (1. 6 ± 0. 7 %). Patients receiving dexmedetomidine infusion had statistically significant lesser bleeding at <b>surgical</b> <b>field</b> (P < 0. 05).
