5|$|Between 1985 and 2007, only {{an average}} of 18 <b>sockeye</b> <b>salmon</b> {{returned}} to Idaho each year. Serious conservation efforts by wildlife biologists and fish hatcheries have captured the few remaining wild <b>sockeye</b> <b>salmon,</b> collected their sperm and eggs, and in a laboratory, have them spawn. Instead of spawning naturally, these sockeye begin their lives in an incubator in a fishery biologist's laboratory. These baby salmon then are transported by ship, bypassing the dams. (The dams can hurt juvenile baby <b>sockeye</b> <b>salmon</b> with their powerful tides and currents, which suck the baby salmon down.) Another conservation effort that has helped the salmon recover, is the destruction of old, outdated dams, such as the Lewiston Dam on the Clearwater River, {{a tributary of the}} Snake. After destroying the dam, salmon populations noticeably recovered.|$|E
5|$|The river {{supported}} species including chinook salmon, coho salmon, and <b>sockeye</b> <b>salmon,</b> {{as well as}} steelhead, white sturgeon, and Pacific lamprey. It {{is known}} that before the construction of dams on the river, there were three major chinook salmon runs in the Snake River; in the spring, summer and fall, totaling about 120,000fish, and the <b>sockeye</b> <b>salmon</b> run was about 150,000. The historical barrier to fish migration on the Snake River was Shoshone Falls, a waterfall that occurs as the Snake River passes through the Snake River Plain.|$|E
5|$|Of the 28 {{fish species}} {{present in the}} forest, 11 are not native and have been {{introduced}} by humans. Rainbow trout, chinook salmon, westslope cutthroat trout, bull trout, and mountain whitefish are all native {{to some of the}} forest's waterways, while brook trout are a common invasive species that compete with the forest's salmonids. The forest's management indicator species is bull trout because they are sensitive to habitat changes and depend on specific habitat conditions. <b>Sockeye</b> <b>salmon</b> are native to the Salmon River watershed {{in the northern part of}} the forest, but dam construction on the Columbia and Snake rivers has hampered the migration of this anadromous fish and caused its population to collapse. Warm Lake supports the forest's only native population of Kokanee salmon, the resident (non-migratory) form of <b>sockeye</b> <b>salmon.</b> However, due to introductions by humans, Anderson Ranch, Arrowrock, Lucky Peak, and Deadwood reservoirs now support populations of Kokanee salmon. To provide additional recreational fishing opportunities, the Idaho Department of Fish and Game stocks several of the forest's waterways with rainbow trout, while reservoirs are also stocked with Kokanee or chinook salmon and Lake Cascade is stocked with coho salmon and steelhead, the anadromous form of rainbow trout.|$|E
50|$|Diatoms form {{most of the}} phytoplankton, with Cyclotella, Melosira, Stephanodiskus and Synedra. Dominant copepod {{species in}} summer 2011 include Cyclops scutifer and the {{dominant}} cladocerans Daphnia longiremis. Other species as well as rotifers are also present, they constitute sources of food for <b>sockeye</b> <b>salmons.</b> A number of annelid species are also found, many of the species that are found in neighbouring waters cannot {{be found in the}} lake. The chironomid midge Chaetocladius tatianae is endemic to the Kurile Lake watershed.|$|R

5|$|Downriver of the Hells Canyon is the Lower Snake River Project, {{authorized}} by the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1945, which {{was created by the}} U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to create a navigable channel on the Snake River from its mouth to the beginning of Hells Canyon. These dams are, in downstream order: Lower Granite Lock and Dam, Little Goose Lock and Dam, Lower Monumental Lock and Dam, and Ice Harbor Lock and Dam. Dredging work was also done throughout the length of the navigation channel to facilitate ship passage. These dams form a cascade of reservoirs with no stretches of free-flowing river in between. Immediately below Ice Harbor Dam is Lake Wallula, formed by the construction of the McNary Dam on the Columbia River. (McNary Dam {{is not part of the}} Lower Snake River Project.) Above Lower Granite Dam, the river channel from Lewiston to Johnson Bar, just below Hells Canyon, is also maintained for jet-boats as this section is too rugged for ships. These dams have been proposed for removal, and if they were to be removed, it would be the largest dam removal project ever undertaken in the United States. The removal has been proposed on the grounds that it would restore salmon runs to the lower Snake River and the Clearwater River and other smaller tributaries. Idaho's Snake river once teemed with <b>sockeye</b> <b>salmon.</b> However, there are almost no wild <b>sockeye</b> <b>salmon</b> left in the river due to a number of factors.|$|E

50|$|Some of {{the best-known}} {{anadromous}} fishes are the Pacific salmon species, such as Chinook (king), coho (silver), chum (dog), pink (humpback) and <b>sockeye</b> (red) <b>salmon.</b> These salmon hatch in small freshwater streams. From there they migrate to the sea to mature, living there for two to six years. When mature, the salmon return to the same streams where they were hatched to spawn. Salmon are capable of going hundreds of kilometers upriver, and humans must install fish ladders in dams to enable the salmon to get past. Other examples of anadromous fishes are sea trout, three-spined stickleback, and shad.|$|R
40|$|Steroidogenic factor 1 (SF- 1) or Ad 4 BP is {{a member}} of the fushi tarazu factor 1 (FTZ-F 1) family and an orphan nuclear re-ceptor that plays an {{important}} role in the hypothalamus-pitui-tary-gonadal axis and the adrenal cortex. Although its critical role in the differentiation of adrenals, gonads, and pituitary gon-adotropes has been well demonstrated, regulatory function of SF- 1 during sexual maturation is yet to be examined. To inves-tigate the potential role of SF- 1 in sexual maturation, expression of two salmon FTZ-F 1 homolog genes, sFF 1 -I and sFF 1 -II, was examined in the pituitaries of chum and <b>sockeye</b> <b>salmons,</b> using specific and sensitive RNase protection assays. Only sFF 1 -I mRNA was found in the pituitary and other organs, such as the ovary, spleen, liver, brain, and skeletal muscle. In chum salmon during upstream migration from the bay to the hatchery, the level of sFF 1 -I mRNA in the male fish was increased on the midway in the river, where the levels of gonadotropin a- and IIb-subunit mRNAs were increased. In maturing sockeye salm-on, the expression of the sFF 1 -I gene was elevated in the mature male fish, but the administration of GnRH analog did not further enhance the expression. These results indicate that sFF 1 -I gene expression in the pituitary is upregulated in maturing salmon, and this upregulation may not depend on GnRH. anterior pituitary, FSH, gene regulation, GnRH, LH, seasonal reproductio...|$|R
25|$|Bristol Bay {{is home to}} the world's largest salmon run. All five Eastern Pacific species spawn in the bay's {{freshwater}} tributaries. Commercial fisheries {{include the}} world's largest <b>sockeye</b> <b>salmon</b> fishery. The Kvijack River has the single largest red salmon run in the world. The Kvijack drains from Lake Iliamna, which is downstream of the deposit. Along with herring and other fisheries, salmon account for nearly 75% of local jobs.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} {{evidence}} that the <b>sockeye</b> <b>salmon</b> are affected by thermal conditions and their responses to temperature are relatively strong and tend to vary from region to region. Canada has also used the Species at Risk Act to {{recognize the importance of}} biological diversity when it come to the conservation of the salmon population. This means that multiple species of salmon would be looked at when it comes to conservation as well as multiple areas that each species live in. COSEWIC, a Canadian organization for the conservation of species, has named the Interior Fraser River Coho, the Cultus Lake Sockeye, and the Sakinaw Lake Sockeye to all be endangered. In British Columbia <b>sockeye</b> <b>salmon</b> in four different watersheds were certified by the Marine Stewardship Council, or MSC, as sustainable fisheries in July 2010 and the certification is good for a period of five years. In 2011 MSC also certified the Pink Salmon Fishery and as of 2012 The Chum Salmon Fisheries started their review under the MSC to become certified as a sustainable fishery.|$|E
25|$|Poaching is {{a threat}} to Oncorhynchus salmon and steelhead populations in Russia. It is {{estimated}} that illegal catching of salmon is 1.5 times more than the reported catch. The Wild Salmon Center is working with Russian authorities to try to help improve traceability systems so that markets can distinguish between legal sustainable salmon and the illegal salmon. The Wild Salmon Center has secured some of its protected locations for the salmon populations. In efforts with the WWF, the Wild Salmon Center was also able to have a <b>Sockeye</b> <b>Salmon</b> fishery certified as completely sustainable in 2012. The Iturup Island Pink and Chum Salmon Fishery was first certified in 2009 and was the first Russian salmon fishery to receive certification in sustainability by MSC. Other fisheries that were certified by MSC include the Northeast Sakhalin Island Pink Salmon, certified in June 2012, and the Ozernaya River <b>Sockeye</b> <b>Salmon,</b> certified in September 2012.

Some common wetland species seen today include the Beaver (Castor canadensis), River Otter (Lutra canadensis). Chinook, Coho, <b>Sockeye</b> and Kokanee <b>salmon</b> species have been observed, as well as Trout and Bass species. The wetland also hosts a variety of reptiles and amphibians, including the Pacific treefrog (Pseudacris regilla), Red-legged frog (Rana aurora), Bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana), Common garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis), and the Northwestern garter snake (Thamnophis ordinoides).|$|R
25|$|Historically, in late May {{and early}} June, Nez Perce villagers crowded to {{communal}} fishing sites to trap eels, steelhead, and chinook salmon, or haul in fish with large dip nets. Fishing took place {{throughout the summer}} and fall, first on the lower streams {{and then on the}} higher tributaries, and catches also included salmon, sturgeon, whitefish, suckers, and varieties of trout. Most of the supplies for winter use came from a second run in the fall, when large numbers of <b>Sockeye</b> <b>salmon,</b> silver, and dog salmon appeared in the rivers.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{abundant}} fishes in Lake Shannon is kokanee salmon, but this population is said to differ from true kokanee. True kokanees are established in freshwater, but the kokanees of Lake Shannon may be the by-product of <b>sockeye</b> <b>salmon</b> and coho salmon that spawned in tributaries of the lake ‚Äî including Sulphur Creek and Thunder Creek ‚Äî either via natural spawining gravels or artificially constructed ones. Some of the fry escaped the conduits that carry outmigrating young salmon into the lower Baker and the Skagit, establishing a population of kokanee.|$|E
25|$|Problems {{that can}} arise from {{selective}} harvesting are smaller reproducing adult fish, {{as well as}} the unexpected mortality of the fish which sustain injuries from the gillnet but are not retained in the fishery. Most salmon populations include several age classes, allowing for fish of different ages, and sizes, to reproduce with each other. A recent 2009 study looked at 59 years of catch and escapement data of Bristol Bay <b>sockeye</b> <b>salmon</b> to determine age and size at maturity trends attributable to the selectivity of commercial gillnet harvests. The study found that the larger females (>550mm) of all age classes were most susceptible to harvest. The study suggests that smaller, younger fish were more likely to successfully traverse the gillnet fishery and reproduce than the larger fish. The study also found that the average length of sockeye harvested from 1946‚Äì2005 was 8mm larger than the sockeye who escaped the gillnet fishery to spawn, reducing the fecundity of the average female by 5%, or 104 eggs. If a salmon enters a gillnet, but manages to escape, it can sustain injuries. These injuries can lead to a lower degree of reproductive success. A study aimed at quantifying mortality of Bristol Bay <b>sockeye</b> <b>salmon</b> due to gillnet-related injuries found that 11‚Äì29% of sockeye sustained fishery-related injuries attributable to gillnets, and 51% of those fish were expected to not reproduce.|$|E

During the salmon run season, there is a greater prevalence of black bears in the area, attracted by the abundance of fish in the river.|$|R
25|$|Male {{pink salmon}} and some <b>sockeye</b> <b>salmon</b> develop {{pronounced}} humps {{just before they}} spawn. These humps may have evolved because they confer species advantages. The humps make it less likely the salmon will spawn in the shallow water at margins of the streambed, which tend to dry out during low water flows or freeze in winter. Further, riffles can contain many salmon spawning simultaneously, as in {{the image on the}} right. Predators, such as bears, {{will be more likely to}} catch the more visually prominent humped males, with their humps projecting above the surface of the water. This may provide a protective buffer for the females.|$|E
25|$|The {{degree of}} damage is also {{dependent}} on the species of sea lice, the developmental stages that are present, {{and the number of}} sea lice on a fish. There is little evidence of host tissue responses in Atlantic salmon at the sites of feeding and attachment, regardless of the development stage. In contrast, coho and pink salmon show strong tissue responses to L. salmonis characterized by epithelial hyperplasia and inflammation. This results in rejection of the parasite within the first week of infection in these species of salmonids. Heavy infections of farmed Atlantic salmon and wild <b>sockeye</b> <b>salmon</b> (Oncorhynchus nerka) by L. salmonis can lead to deep lesions, particularly on the head region, even exposing the skull.|$|E
