5|$|During the 1890s, Harvard Law School was {{pioneering}} the casebook {{method of}} teaching introduced by Dean Christopher Langdell. Apart from Langdell, Hand's professors included Samuel Williston, John Chipman Gray, and James Barr Ames. Hand preferred those teachers who valued {{common sense and}} fairness, and ventured beyond casebook study into the philosophy of law. His favorite professor was James Bradley Thayer, who taught him evidence {{in his second year}} and constitutional law in his third. A man of broad interests, Thayer became a major influence on Hand's jurisprudence. He emphasized the law's historical and human dimensions rather than its certainties and extremes. He <b>stressed</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> courts to exercise judicial restraint in deciding social issues.|$|E

25|$|Early on, Leopold was {{assigned}} to hunt and kill bears, wolves, and mountain lions in New Mexico.

In 1987, he co-authored the Contributions to the Slovenian National Program, published in the 57th issue of the Nova revija journal. The text was written as the response to the Memorandum of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts of 1986, and set the grounds for a political opposition to the Communist regime. It was also the first legally published publication openly advocating Slovenia's independence from Yugoslavia. Puƒçnik's article was centred on issues of democratization and political plurality, and openly <b>stressed</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> Slovenia's full sovereignty in order to secure such development.|$|E
25|$|He usually {{refrained from}} {{intervening}} {{directly into the}} political debate while serving as President. However, he often addressed general issues, without mentioning their connection to the current political debate, in order to state his opinion without being too intrusive. His interventions have frequently <b>stressed</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> all parties to respect the constitution and observe the proprieties of political debate. He was generally held in high regard by all political forces represented in the parliament. The possibility of persuading Ciampi to stand {{for a second term}} as President ‚Äì the so-called Ciampi-bis ‚Äì was widely discussed, despite his advancing age, but it was officially dismissed by Ciampi himself on 3 May 2006, just a few days before his mandate expired.

Accepting responsibility for the worst (and second-only) defeat of a sitting government in modern Japanese history, As≈ç immediately resigned as LDP president.|$|E
25|$|In his old age Yan {{also found}} {{time to work on}} a {{dictionary}} and related literary projects. In his 26 chapter book Yanshi jiaxun È°èÊ∞èÂÆ∂Ë®ì ("The Family Instructions of Master Yan") Yan Zhitui left an entire written compendium of his own philosophy and life-advice to his sons, advising them on which paths to take and which paths to avoid in order to gain success in life. In addition, he also made observations about the differences between Northern and Southern China of his time, especially in regards to language, customs, and culture. He wrote that he formed many bad habits in life that took years to overcome because his elder brother had not been strict enough with him in the absence of their father. He stressed the need to acquire a good education, since well-educated ministers were chosen for posts, while others who had prestigious family lines for centuries wound up working on farms or tending to horses in the stable if they were not properly educated. Although he <b>stressed</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> mastering calligraphy, painting, and playing the musical instrument of the lute (guqin), he warned against them from practicing too much and gaining too much skill. This was because those of higher rank, in a degrading and humiliating fashion, could easily call upon them to constantly entertain and produce fanciful calligraphy, poetry, or a musical song on the spot. Yan Zhitui was an antiquarian {{when it came to the}} prized calligraphy in his family's collection, with written pieces in his possession that were originally penned by the masters of early calligraphy, Wang Xizhi and his son Wang Xianzhi.|$|E
25|$|At the plenary sessions, {{addresses}} {{were made}} by the chairman of the year's annual meetings, as well as the heads of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank at SSICEC. The three parties <b>stressed</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> the World Trade Organization's Doha Round talks to resume. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that the impasse in the Doha Round of trade negotiations carries a heavy cost and a high risk, and will extend beyond economics. Lee added that good governance is the key to help economies to open up in the era of globalisation and improve the lives for the people. He also outlined the roles of a good government in managing the process of changes. Lee said that governments must win the support of globalisation from the people and give them better opportunities. At the opening speech of IMF managing director Rodrigo de Rato said the world leaders must quickly revive the Doha Round of trade talks to prevent a damaging shift towards protectionism. De Rato also said that the world is having a period of high growth and low inflation unseen since the 1960s, and a solid growth in the economy could be expected in the following year. He added that the global growth cycle may turn and the best hope for good performance lies in further increase in international trade. The three risks to world economic prospects include rising oil prices, disorderly unwinding of global payments imbalances, and the prevention of trade. World Bank president Paul Wolfowitz told donor countries to increase aid to poor nations, and wealthy nations to put Africa as the top of the priority list of poverty fighting.|$|E
