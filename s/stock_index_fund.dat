50|$|Growth {{in assets}} {{accelerated}} after {{the beginning of}} the bull market in 1982, and other mutual fund companies began to copy the indexing model. These copy funds were not successful since they typically charged high fees, which defeated the purpose of index funds. In December 1986, Vanguard launched its second mutual fund, a bond index fund called the Total Bond Fund, which was the first bond index fund ever offered to individual investors. One earlier criticism of the First Index fund was that it was only an index of the S&P 500. In December 1987, Vanguard launched its third fund, the Vanguard Extended Market Index Fund, an index fund of the entire stock market, excluding the S&P 500. Over the next five years, other funds were launched, including a small cap index fund, an international <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> <b>fund,</b> and a total stock market index fund. During the 1990s, more funds were offered, and several Vanguard funds, including the S&P 500 index fund and the total stock market fund, became among the largest funds in the world, and Vanguard became the largest mutual fund company in the world. Noted investor John Neff retired as manager of Vanguard's Windsor Fund in 1995, after a 30 year career in which his fund beat returns of the S&P 500 index by an average of 300 basis points per year.|$|E

The interest rate and the expected rate of inflation follow a correlated Ornstein–Uhlenbeck processes and the risk premia are constants.

Closed form solutions are obtained in a dynamic portfolio optimization model.

For example, in June 2007, the London Stock Exchange {{launched a new}} system called TradElect that promises an average 10 millisecond turnaround time from placing an order to final confirmation and can process 3,000 orders per second. Since then, competitive exchanges have continued to reduce latency with turnaround times of 3 milliseconds available. This is of great importance to high-frequency traders, {{because they have to}} attempt to pinpoint the consistent and probable performance ranges of given financial instruments. These professionals are often dealing in versions of <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> <b>funds</b> like the E-mini S&Ps, because they seek consistency and risk-mitigation along with top performance. They must filter market data to work into their software programming so that there is the lowest latency and highest liquidity at the time for placing stop-losses and/or taking profits. With high volatility in these markets, this becomes a complex and potentially nerve-wracking endeavor, where a small mistake can lead to a large loss.

40|$|Problem: For {{what type}} of investors are <b>index</b> <b>funds</b> versus {{exchange-traded}} <b>index</b> <b>funds</b> best suited? Objective: The purpose of the paper is to determine how an <b>index</b> <b>fund</b> or an exchange-traded <b>index</b> <b>fund</b> (ETF) suits different types of investors with different requirements {{in terms of time}} frame, investment size and purpose of investment. The comparison is based on fees and trade practicality. This is going to describe the advantages and disadvantages with the two different financial instruments. Method: The study is a comparative study using two methods; one of which is a case study, the other is a qualitative interview. The case study focuses on fees and is made on an exchange traded fund (XACT OMXS 30) and a simple equity <b>index</b> <b>fund</b> (Erik Pensér equity enhanced index). The interview is a more general comparison of the differences between ETFs and <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> <b>funds.</b> Focus here is on trade practicality. Results: The study concludes that XACT OMXS 30 is more suitable for a large investor, that makes fewer transactions and that saves on long term. Erik Pensér equity enhanced <b>index</b> <b>fund</b> is suitable for both short and longer term investors. However, taken to extremes XACT OMXS 30 is always cheaper than Erik Pensér in the long term. Regarding purpose of investment, when doing monthly saving Erik Pensér is more beneficiary whilst the differences are less evident when saving on yearly basis. The study also shows is that the commission is most critical for which of the two investigated funds the investor should choose. Generally, ETFs is better suited for active traders as transaction are more flexible. Also, a benefit of ETFs for active traders is that they have made it easier to speculate on short term volatility on the stock exchange (e. g. using Bull & Bear with leverage). ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{shows that}} a {{corporate}} manager compensated in stock options makes corporate decisions to maximize stock option value. Overinvestment is a consequence if risk increases with investment. Facing the choice of hedging corporate risk with forward contracts on a <b>stock</b> market <b>index</b> <b>fund</b> and insuring pure risks the manager will choose the latter. Hedging with forwards reduces weight in both tails of corporate payoff distribution and thus reduces option value. Insuring pure risks reduces the weight in the left tail where the options are out-of-the-money and increases the weight in the right tail where the options are in-the-money; the effect {{is an increase in}} the option value. Insurance reduces the overinvestment problem but no level of insurance coverage can reduce investment to that which maximizes the shareholder value.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the demand for}} a firm’s common stock by wealthy relative to less wealthy individual investors and by indi-vidual relative to institutional investors as a finction of risk, in-formation environment (proxied by firm size and S&P 500 membership), and form of return payout (i. e., dividends versus cap-ital gains). The findings indicate that among individual investors demand for the stocks of riskier, larger, and low-dividend-yield firms increases with wealth. The findings also suggest that relative to individual investors, institutional investors prefer the stocks of larger firms, S&P 500 firms, and firms paying low dividend yields. Overall, {{these results suggest that}} investors find a number of jirm-specijic factors important in their investment choices and that the importance of such factors varies systematically with investor size. Studies in financial economics often ask the question of what, if any, firm-specific attributes other than risk and expected (before-tax) return in-fluence aggregate demand (i. e., price) for a firm’s stock. This paper asks a different, but related, question: what firm-specific attributes influence rela-tive demand among investor types for a firm’s stock? A knowledge of factors influencing relative demand is important for at least two reasons. First, relative demand preferences can translate into aggregate demand ef-fects. Harris and Gurel (1986). for example, find that because institutional investors, particularly <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> <b>funds,</b> prefer S&P 500 firms as invest-ments, the stock price of a firm increases (decreases) if the firm is added to (dropped from) the S&P 500. Thus, a relative preference on the part of institutional investors for S&P 500 firms appears to influence aggregate demand. For a summary of similar arguments relating to dividend tax cli...|$|R

40|$|The great {{growth of}} mutual funds (FIM) in Spain over recent years raises the {{question}} whether an investor adopting a passive management strategy can consider those funds as a serious alternative to direct investment in the stock exchange.

It studies the Spanish stock funds versus the alternative of direct investing in the stock exchange using the <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> Ibex 35 as the benchmark. One can say that a fund replicates the benchmark index when both variables share common trends in the long run. Therefore, cointegration methodology is used to determine the longrun relationship between the funds value and Ibex 35. It is found that 11 out of 63 funds are cointegrated with the <b>stock</b> <b>index,</b> hence those <b>funds</b> could be used for investors seeking a passive management strategy. ...|$|R
