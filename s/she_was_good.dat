It was not until after she had injured herself that Clara's mother began to question her playing with the boys. Clara's mother decided she should focus on more feminine skills. She invited one of Clara's female cousins over to help develop her femininity. From her cousin, she gained proper social skills as well.|$|E

I have been harsh, unkind, cruel, sulky to her ever since we left home--yet <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> to me. I have torn her from all those whom she loves, with the {{intention}} that she should never see them again--yet <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> to me. <b>She</b> might have left me to die, and might easily have gone home by herself, {{and it would have}} served me right, but--but <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> to me. I am not a man. I am a beast--a bear--a fox--a walrus--" ...|$|R

25|$|Filbert's {{plans for}} Nina have changed when she grew older. Instead of a {{professional}} music career, he wanted his daughter to earn college degree, and {{to join him in}} the United States to find work. She took up Accountancy at Miriam College, since <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> at numbers. Her father insisted that she would take up Law as a latter course. Because of too much love for singing, she disobeyed her father and joined different bands. He eventually gave up on trying to stop her, and just told her to maintain good grades. She did get good grades, and was even a consistent dean's lister.|$|E
25|$|Wagner {{was born}} in Gainesville, Florida. Her parents {{required}} her and her two brothers to participate in sports. Her brothers picked American football and soccer; she attempted ballet, softball and soccer before discovering that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> at swimming.

After her father retired from army service, her family moved to Gainesville, and she attended the International Baccalaureate program at Eastside High School in Gainesville. While in high school, Wagner swam for the Eastside swim team for one semester, and trained for national and international competition with the Florida Aquatics club team under coach Kevin Thornton.|$|E
25|$|Valentine {{was born}} in 1907, in Blackheath, England. She had a brother named Bryan Valentine who played for England between 1933/34 and 1938/39 and was {{the captain of the}} Kent county cricket team. A medium pace bowler, Valentine did not possess strong batting skills like her brother who had a batting average of 64.85 in Test cricket. With a small build, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> at Lacrosse. At the {{domestic}} level, Valentine played for Kent and Middlesex. She also represented other minor teams such as Women's Cricket Association, Cobham Ladies, London and District Women, The Cuckoos, Berkhamsted and District Women, South of England Women, Women's Cricket Association Ramblers, Miss Doman's Touring XI, Midlands Women and Rest of England Women. She played three matches between 1930 and 1933 for the Women's Cricket Association. In the first match against Michael Singleton's XI, Valentine was the best bowler for her side, picking up 4 wickets for 20 runs. In the second match against J Singleton's XI, she scored 4 runs and remained not out when the team declared their innings. Valentine was not given the chance to bowl and the match ended in a draw.

500|$|During {{her time}} at Oxford, she was noted for her {{isolated}} and serious attitude. At Oxford, {{she met a}} young man named Tony Bray (1926–2014) who was impressed by her and later recalled that she was [...] "very thoughtful and a very good conversationalist. That's probably what interested me. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> at general subjects". Her enthusiasm for politics as a girl made him think of her as [...] "unusual". Bray met Roberts' parents and described her father as [...] "slightly austere" [...] and [...] "totally correct" [...] and her mother as [...] "very proper" [...] and [...] "motherly".|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to Jo {{has been}} generally positive. Diana Steenbergen of IGN favored Jo from the beginning, deeming her [...] "tough and direct, and also female, something the boys don't {{have a lot}} of in their lives right now". She also believed that Jo and Dean had a [...] "natural chemistry" [...] between them, which continues even with her reappearance in the fifth season. However, Steenbergen was confused by Jo's anger at Sam and Dean over John Winchester's involvement in her father's death, feeling that the show's producers may have added it to the story as an excuse for Jo's removal from the series. While Tina Charles of TV Guide was at first unsure about the character, she wrote that by the episode [...] "No Exit", [...] "Tal did step things up and kinda won me over". She believed that while Jo did not make a good love interest for Dean, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> in a [...] "sisterly or friendly fellow-ghostbuster way", deeming her as [...] "someone they can count on in a pinch". Overall, Charles felt that Jo [...] "fit into that world, whether she was a little overzealous or not".|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Breakaway" [...] {{was directed by}} Dave Meyers, which was shot in two days from July 10 to July 11, 2004. In the video, the younger version of Clarkson was played by Lindsey Krueger. According to Meyers, working with Clarkson was a pleasant experience because he felt <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> and honest, although he had initial doubts in the beginning. He explained, [...] "I was a little worried, her coming off 'American Idol,' it inherently feels manufactured and I didn't {{know how much of}} it was true artistry. But when I met her, she really does have a good, solid vibe. It was an honor to bring some of that out of her." [...] Since the song is autobiographical, Clarkson decided to act out most of the lyrics in the video. Meyers also realized that the song was featured in The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement and he struggled {{to find a way to}} address the film-footage in the music video, saying [...] "Since it's a movie tie-in, the idea stems from trying to figure out a new way of addressing the film-footage requirement they put on you, so we came up with the idea of her attending the premiere, which is very much something she will do in real life." ...|$|E

2500|$|Upon Watson {{reaching}} the 2011 French Open second round, Andy Murray commented [...] "When I saw {{her for the}} first time, I thought <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>good.</b> I like the way she moves on the court. She's very balanced". Bollettieri stated that Watson's [...] "game is based on great movement, but she's not afraid to whack the ball. She's not easy to beat. She has very good ground strokes, though she can over-hit and strike the ball a little too flat at times".|$|E
2500|$|John Marshall, another {{archeologist}} at Mohenjo-daro, {{described the}} figure as [...] "a young girl, {{her hand on}} her hip in a half-impudent posture, and legs slightly forward as she beats time to the music with her legs and feet." [...] The archaeologist Gregory Possehl said of the statuette, [...] "We may not be certain that she was a dancer, but <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> at what she did and she knew it". The statue led to two important discoveries about the civilization: first, that they knew metal blending, casting and other sophisticated methods of working with ore, and secondly that entertainment, especially dance, was part of the culture.|$|E
2500|$|Perkins {{was born}} to Thomas and Anna Perkins at Marston Jabbett in the parish of Bulkington, Warwickshire, England in 1558, {{the year in which}} the Protestant Elizabeth I succeeded her Catholic sister Mary as Queen of England. [...] Perkins lived his entire life under Elizabeth I, dying one year before the Virgin Queen's own death in 1603. [...] Perkins's {{relationship}} with Elizabeth was ambiguous: on the one hand, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>Good</b> Queen Bess, the monarch under whom England finally and firmly became a Protestant nation; on the other hand, Perkins and {{the other members of the}} Puritan movement were frustrated that the Elizabethan settlement had not gone far enough and pushed for further Reformation.|$|E

2500|$|Jacqueline Wilson {{was born}} in Bath, Somerset, in 1945. Her father was a civil servant; her mother was an {{antiques}} dealer. Jacqueline {{spent most of her}} childhood in Kingston upon Thames, where she went to Latchmere Primary School. She particularly enjoyed books by Noel Streatfeild, as well as American classics like Little Women and What Katy Did. At the age of seven, she filled Woolworths notebooks with stories of her imaginary games. At the age of nine she wrote her first [...] "novel" [...] which was 21 sides long. That story, Meet the Maggots, was about a family with seven children. Although <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> at English, she had no interest in mathematics; she would often stare out of the window and imagine rather than pay attention to the class, leading her final-year teacher at Latchmere to nickname her [...] "Jacky Daydream". Jacqueline Wilson later used the nickname as the title of the first stage of her autobiography.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2002, it was {{reported}} that Lucy Benjamin had quit her role of Lisa. She commented, [...] "I’ve had a wonderful five years and I’m terribly excited by the [...] storyline.” EastEnders executive producer Louise Berridge added, “This {{is going to be a}} very demanding story to play but I know Lucy will do a fabulous job. She’s an actress with a terrific future.” Despite initial claims that the actress had decided to leave, she later admitted that the producers had axed the character. Discussing Lisa's exit, Lucy Benjamin's boyfriend of the time, actor Steve McFadden who plays Phil Mitchell, said, [...] "Lucy didn’t feel comfortable with lying. There’s a stigma attached to being given the boot but she felt stupid pretending she’d decided to pack in a great job. It was hard for her and she was very upset but she’s come through it. I felt for her but soaps are led by storylines and Lucy was told that the writers had come up with a brilliant plot that was too good to say no to.I guess Lucy’s character was so central to the plot that eventually it blew up in her face. I’m proud of the fact that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> enough to come to the forefront of the show. Lucy did so well to make her mark on EastEnders in the first place because Lisa arrived on the Square on her own. She wasn’t part of a family, which means she was more vulnerable to the chop. She was only on a three-month contract but she made it a success and ended up being part of the cast for four years. If you are part of a screen family on EastEnders you are practically bomb-proof, no matter what your ability is as an actor." ...|$|E
