40|$|Over 8, 000 {{adolescents}} and young adults (4, 111 males; 4, 085 females) reported on several HIV-related risk behaviors during enrollment into 10 service demonstration projects targeted to youth living with, or at risk for, HIV.

Males who had injection drug risk histories, had <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> HIV positive partner, had sexually transmitted diseases, had <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> males, and/or were homeless had an inflated risk of being HIV positive.
