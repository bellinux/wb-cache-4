Forty-one collegiate football players (mean age 20. 1 years) completed either a 10 -week weight training (WT) or weight training plus <b>slide</b> <b>board</b> (WTSB) program. The following pre- and posttests were administered: the lateral shuttle run (LSR), the lower extremity functional test (L. E. F. T.), the cone test, the box test, and the squat and bench press tests. Following the pretesting evaluation, subjects were randomized into a WT group (N = 17) and a WTSB group (N = 24) i based on their pretesting stxength and agility scores. Both groups underwent 10 -weeks of weight training, however, the WTSB group added a 3 day/week <b>slide</b> <b>board</b> training. Data were analyzed using a 2 -way ANOVA with repeated measures. It was found that there were significant differences (p . 05). For the box test, there were different responses between groups from pre- to post testing. The WT had a significantly (p <. 05) lower score on post testing than pretesting, and this decline in performance was significantly (p c. 05) different from the responses of the WTSB group.

Work process and defect about structure of escort mechanism in existence is firstly analyzed in depth, design concept and implementation methods of the new escort mechanism are then studied. Three-dimensional structure and work process are presented, and performance comparison between the new-style structure and the old one is conducted. Application study is launched at last. The innovative escort mechanism and <b>slide</b> <b>board</b> are movably connected and lumped together. In consequence, the escort mechanism will stop and then be hung at the column, while the tool slide continues to move down until broaching stop. The new-style escort mechanism has superiority such as low cost, high robust and good safety, and so on, which make it adaptive and useful for structural optimization of broaching machine.

40|$|Introduction Exercise {{prescription}} from indices {{obtained from}} cycling or running treadmill incremental tests {{does not seem}} suitable for speed skaters. However, the specificity of laboratory skating assessments remains to be established. Purpose This study intended to assess the test–retest reliability of an incremental test performed on a <b>slide</b> <b>board</b> (SB), and its validity compared with a cycling protocol {{in order to determine}} aerobic performance indices in speed skaters. Methods Ten competitive inline speed skaters performed two incremental tests on an SB and one cycling incremental test. The intensity of SB test was determined by cadence, starting at 30 push-offs/min and increasing by three push-offs/min each minute, until volitional exhaustion. Maximal and submaximal values related to the anaerobic threshold (AT) of oxygen uptake (VO 2), pulmonary ventilation (VE), respiratory exchange (RER), heart rate (HR), rating of perceived effort (RPE), cadence (CAD), and blood lactate concentration ([Lac]max) were measured. Results No significant differences were found in any of the variables between test–retest on SB. High relative (ICC > 0. 9) and absolute reliability (typical error of measure as CVTEM 0. 8).

Para que sejam eficazes, os testes para a avaliação da {{performance}} e determinação de índices para prescrição das intensidades do treinamento devem ser válidos, confiáveis e específicos. Contudo, a simulação do movimento de patinação em ambiente laboratorial é cara e difícil de ser realizada, enquanto que a avaliação em ambiente externo dificulta o controle do protocolo e a mensuração das variáveis necessárias. A prescrição do exercício de patinação a partir de índices advindos de testes em cicloergômetro ou esteira de corrida não é apropriada. Objetivos. Investigar a reprodutibilidade e validade de dois protocolos incrementais máximos de patinação em <b>slide</b> <b>board</b> (SB) para determinar os índices fisiológicos aeróbios máximos e submáximos em patinadores. Método. Dez patinadores realizaram duas vezes (teste e reteste) um teste incremental máximo "curto" em SB, que teve início a uma cadência de 30 passos por minuto (ppm), aumentando três ppm a cada minuto. O mesmo grupo realizou um protocolo incremental em cicloergômetro com incremento de cadência. Um segundo grupo de dez patinadores realizou um teste incremental máximo "longo" em SB, iniciando a 30 ppm, com incremento de três ppm a cada três minutos. Este grupo realizou também o protocolo curto em SB e um protocolo concorrente em cicloergômetro com incremento de carga. Os patinadores foram classificados em dois grupos, de acordo com as características do treinamento: "competitivos" (treinamento estruturado acima de 6 horas semanais) e "recreacionais" (patinação livre de até 4 horas semanais). Os valores máximos e submáximos, relacionados ao ponto de deflexão da frequência cardíaca (PDFC), de consumo de oxigênio (VO 2), ventilação (VE), troca respiratória (RER), frequência cardíaca (FC), percepção subjetiva de esforço (PSE), cadência (CAD), potência (P) e concentração de lactato ([Lac]), bem como o índice de rítmo (%R) no teste foram determinados. Para análise de reprodutibilidade e validade foram utilizados: o teste t de Student, o teste de correlação intraclasse (ICC), o erro típico de medida (ETM), o coeficiente de correlação de Pearson e os limites de concordância (95 %LC). Os coeficientes das retas de regressão individuais da FC, VO 2 e [Lac] foram comparados. Foi realizada uma análise de regressão múltipla para previsão do VO 2 max, utilizando o método de seleção stepwise. Resultados. Não foram encontradas diferenças significativas entre as variáveis durante o teste e o reteste em SB. Uma boareprodutibilidade absoluta (ICC > 0, 9) e relativa (ETM Abstract: Introduction. To be effective, {{the performance}} evaluations for exercise prescription must be valid, reliable and movement-specific. However, a specific laboratory skating assessments are expensive {{and difficult to}} simulate in the laboratory, while field tests are difficult to precisely control the protocol and to acquire the physiological data needed. Frequently, the exercise prescription for skaters is based on indices obtained from cycling or running treadmill incremental tests, despite {{it does not seem}} suitable. Purpose. This study intended to assess {{the reliability and validity of}} two incremental <b>slide</b> <b>board</b> (SB) skating tests to determine aerobic indices of performance in skaters. Method. Ten skaters perfomed twice (test and retest) a "short" SB maximal incremental test, wich started with 30 push-offs per minute (ppm), increasing three ppm each minute. The same group performed a concurrent incremental cadence cycling test. A second group of ten skaters performed a "long" SB maximal incremental protocol, wich started with 30 ppm, increasing three ppm each three minutes. This group performed also the short SB protocol and a concurrent incremental load cycle testing. The participants were classified in two groups, according to the training characteristics: "competitives" (training program over 6 hour per week) and "recreationals" (free skating lower than 4 hours per week). Maximal and submaximal values associated to the heart rate deflection point (HRDP) of oxygen uptake (VO 2), pulmonary ventilation (VE), respiratory exchange (RER), heart rate (HR), rating of perceived effort (RPE), cadence (CAD), power output (P) and blood lactate concentration ([Lac]max), as well as the rhythm index (%R) during the tests were measured. To determine the reliability and validity the follow statitiscal analisys were used: t test, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), typical error of measure (TEM), Pearson's coefficient and 95 % of the limits of agreement (95 % LA). The indivídual linear regression equations of HR, VO 2 and [Lac] were determined, and the slopes of the regression lines were compared. Multiple regression analysis was performed to predict VO 2 max, and the stepwise method was used to select the independent variables. Results: No significant differences between test-retest on SB were found for all variables. High relative (ICC > 0. 9) and absolute reliability (TEM < 3. 5 %) were found for VO 2 max, HRmax, CADmax, CADPDFC, and RPEPDFC. High correlations were found for FCmax, CADmax,CADrelmax, CADPDFC, CADrelPDFC, VO 2 max and VO 2 PDFC for SB long protocol. In comparison to SB test, the [Lac]max was significantly higher and RPEAT was lower during cycling protocol. High correlations were found for Pmax, FCmax, FCOBLA, VO 2 OBLA, VO 2 max, VEmax, INTOBLA, POBLA and [Lac]OBLA between SB and cycle ergometer long protocols. REROBLA, VO 2 OBLA, and VEmax didn't show differences. The slope of the regression lines of HR, VO 2 and [Lac] weren't different among protocols. Significant correlations were found for most maximal variables and for submaximal HR between short and long SB protocols. CADmax explained around 50 % of VO 2 max obtained during short SB protocol, and %R was strongly correlated with CADmax. The "competitive" group had higher VO 2 max, CADmax, Pmax, Pmaxrel, VO 2 LV 2, PrelLV 2 and %R compared with the recreacional group. Conclusions: The findings suggest that the short SB test is reliable and valid to evaluate maximal and submaximal physiological indices associated with aerobic performance of skaters. The long SB protocol elicited physiological responses similar and correlated with the ones found on cycle ergometer, pointing out to the valididty of the SB test to adequately measure aerobic indices. However, the differences found in some absolute values of some variables reflect the physiological particularity of the skating laboratory tests and the inapropriated use of cycle ergometer tests to evaluate skaters...|$|E
