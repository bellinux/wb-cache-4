50|$|Coal {{workings}} and wastes at Monkridding near Kilwinning {{were recorded}} by Timothy Pont in 1608, extending between 50 acre and 100 acre, {{associated with the}} limestone.

50|$|Much of Targmanchats Vank is {{currently}} in ruin {{with the exception of}} the extant eastern portion of the church's wings. Massive sections of other walls remain relatively intact, though toppled from their original foundations and strewn about the premises. The church is mostly unadorned and simple in style. There are some gravestones as well as other more ancient carved <b>stones</b> nearby. The <b>workings</b> of a modern restoration attempt with the start of a new foundation and structural steel supports are clearly visible.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{location of}} the municipal seat was on the block bound by King, Frederick, Duke and Scott streets and home today to Market Square Shopping Centre; the first city hall was built in 1919 by William Henry Eugene Schmalz (son of Mayor W.H. Schmalz) faced King, with the area towards Duke hosting the weekly Kitchener Farmer's Market (operating from 1869 to 1872 which relocated to building in rear), rebuilt 1907 and lasted until 1973. The last of the city halls on the site was built in 1924 replacing the Victorian structure topped with a cupola with a three-story Renaissance Revival (similar to St. Lawrence Hall in Toronto) porticoed building topped with a clock tower. It was demolished in 1973 in a decision controversial to this day. The <b>stones</b> and <b>workings</b> of the clock tower were labelled and stored. While City Hall moved, the Farmer's Market was relocated within the same small location (in Market Square Mall) from 1973 to 2004.|$|R
50|$|Research shows {{occupation}} since prehistoric times, and caves {{along the}} river Kirmir contain <b>stone</b> <b>workings</b> apparently by the Hittites (2000 BC). Later the area was occupied by Phrygians, Ancient Romans and Byzantines (one of the caves has a carved cross from the early spread of Christianity under Roman rule).|$|E

50|$|Progressive {{closures}} of the quarries led to {{the decline}} of this once thriving local community in the 20th century. The old flooded Monkredding Quarry at NS329452 is a Provisional Local Nature Conservation Site as designated by the Scottish Wildlife Trust in co-operation with North Ayrshire Council.Coal workings and wastes at Monkridding near Kilwinning were recorded by Timothy Pont {{as far back as}} 1608, extending between 50 acre and 100 acre, associated with the limestone.
