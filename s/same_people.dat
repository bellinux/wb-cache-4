5|$|As {{a result}} of the war, the Ho-Chunk tribe was {{compelled}} to cede the lead mining region to the United States. The Americans also increased their military presence on the frontier, building Fort Winnebago and reoccupying two other abandoned forts. The conflict convinced some officials that Americans and Indians could not live peaceably together, and that the Natives should be compelled to move westward, a policy known as Indian removal. The Winnebago War preceded the larger Black Hawk War of 1832, which involved many of the <b>same</b> <b>people</b> and concerned similar issues.|$|E
5|$|Season 7, set 65 {{days after}} the end of Redemption, begins at 8:00a.m. Jack is {{assisted}} by the FBI and covert operatives when the firewall for America's federal computer infrastructure is breached by the <b>same</b> <b>people</b> responsible for a conflict in Sangala. Jack must uncover corruption within President Taylor's administration, which has allowed the Sangalans to raid the White House and capture Taylor. She is later blackmailed by a fictional private military company in an attempt to release biological weapons on U.S. soil.|$|E
5000|$|Usually, new {{rates were}} {{introduced}} by special decrees of the Government. In a few cases, {{this was done}} by the circularised orders of the postal administration known as [...] "post office circulars". The rates for international postage were established by the <b>same</b> <b>People's</b> Commissariat for Posts and Telegraphs, later superseding by the Ministry of Communications of the USSR.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is unclear}} whether [...] "Hutaym" [...] refers to the <b>same</b> <b>peoples</b> as [...] "Huteimi", because {{although}} they inhabit geographically similar areas, their lifestyles are profoundly different, as the Hutaym life is described by R. Khanam in his Encyclopaedic Ethnography of Middle-East and Central Asia as [...] "raising exceptional breeds of camels, with exceptions being primarily ass nomads". It is possible that they do refer to similar peoples, but in different time periods.|$|R

5|$|A {{possible}} {{reason for the}} willingness of the Franks to connect themselves with the Kentish court is the fact that a Frankish king, Chilperic I, is recorded as having conquered a people known as the Euthiones during the mid-sixth century. If, as seems likely from the name, these people were the continental remnants of the Jutish invaders of Kent, then {{it may be that the}} marriage was intended as a unifying political move, reconnecting different branches of the <b>same</b> <b>people.</b> Another perspective on the marriage may be gained by considering that it is likely that Æthelberht was not yet king at the time he and Bertha were wed: it may be that Frankish support for him, acquired via the marriage, was instrumental in gaining the throne for him.|$|E
5|$|Le Père Goriot, {{especially}} in its revised form, marks an important early instance of Balzac's trademark use of recurring characters: persons from earlier novels appear in later works, usually during significantly {{different times of}} life. Pleased with the effect he achieved {{with the return of}} Rastignac, Balzac included 23 characters in the first edition of Le Père Goriot that would recur in later works; during his revisions for later editions the number increased to 48. Although Balzac had used this technique before, the characters had always reappeared in minor roles, as nearly identical versions of the <b>same</b> <b>people.</b> Rastignac's appearance shows, {{for the first time in}} Balzac's fiction, a novel-length backstory that illuminates and develops a returning character.|$|E
5|$|The Master {{spends most}} of his time {{drinking}} alcohol, and people begin trying to convince him to move into a nursing home, where no dogs are allowed. One summer, an outbreak of rabies spreads through the fox population. After one infected fox attacks a group of human children, the <b>same</b> <b>people</b> approach the Master and ask his help in killing the foxes. He uses traps and poison to try to kill as many foxes as possible; however, the poison also kills domestic animals. After a human child dies from eating it, the humans remove all of the poison, then the Master organizes a hunt in which large numbers of people line up and walk straight into the woods, flushing out foxes to be shot. The aging Tod escapes all three events, as well as an attempt at coursing him with greyhounds.|$|E
50|$|Selencia is {{mentioned}} {{twice in the}} first book of Gallus Anonymus' Gesta principum Polonorum (The Poles' princes' deeds), a chronicle composed in Piast Poland between 1112 and 1118 to glorify the Piast dynasty in general, and the contemporary Piast ruler Boleslaw III Wrymouth in particular. The first mention is written in the present tense, describing Boleslaw III Wrymouth's fight against his pagan neighbors at the Baltic Sea - Selencians, Pomeranians and Old Prussians, while the second mention refers to Boleslaw I Chrobry's fight against the <b>same</b> <b>peoples.</b>|$|R

On August 11, 1845 at the introduction of Jesse Applegate the body passed a law against dueling within a half hour that Governor Abernethy also signed within 30 minutes of the bill's introduction. A new legislature met beginning on December 2, with Robert Newell serving as {{the speaker of the}} body through December 10 and Henry A. G. Lee assuming the post until the conclusion of the session on December 19. Polk District was created during the session, with the bill passed on December 19. John E.

2500|$|Comparisons {{of income}} over time should adjust {{for changes in}} average age, family size, number of breadwinners, and other {{characteristics}} of a population. Measuring personal income ignores dependent children, but household income also has problems – a household of ten has a lower standard of living than one of two people, though the income of the two households may be the <b>same.</b> <b>People's</b> earnings tend to rise over their working lifetimes, so [...] "snapshot measures of income inequality can be misleading." [...] The inequality of a recent college graduate and a 55-year-old {{at the peak of}} his/her career is not an issue if the graduate has the same career path.|$|R
