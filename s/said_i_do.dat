60|$|That either {{dream is}} to be {{regarded}} as in any way significant or prophetic beyond what I have categorically <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not for one moment suggest.|$|E
60|$|What next {{might have}} been <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know, for just then we were {{interrupted}} by a visit from our common banker, and the discourse was necessarily changed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why {{have you}} been so kind to him?" [...] she asked timidly. [...] "From what he <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not {{think that he was}} very useful to you, and, indeed, you and he are so different." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not like}} to hear our race called sheep, and <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not think they were.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not know, but {{hoped it}} might be the next-door dog.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nay,' {{says the}} other, 'I only knew you <b>said</b> so; <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not {{think you would}} have acted so from what <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> nor <b>do</b> <b>I</b> think I gave you any reason.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{you do not}} understand," [...] she answered, {{smiling at}} him. [...] "What I <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not wish to be}} forgotten. Only--just at that moment, it sounded natural enough--and today--I think that I am a little ashamed." ...|$|E
6000|$|Miss Mary (to SANDY, hurriedly and excitedly). You {{have heard}} what that woman <b>said.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not ask you under what alias you are known here: I only ask a single question.--Is SHE your wife? {{are you the}} father of her child? ...|$|E
6000|$|As I have <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not {{understand}} German, but Mrs. Colesworthy knows the language well, and, {{stepping up to}} the man, she said (she afterward told me {{the meaning of the}} words that passed between them): [...] "Are you Dr. Hildstein?" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Some {{say that}} I would be unpopular if I remove the fuel subsidies. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not seek popularity", he said.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> and {{proceeded}} to hint {{that it would be}} advisable for him to go below now and take a rest.|$|R
6000|$|... "You were {{speaking}} of her," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said</b> to the boy, who was half-sitting, half-crouching {{against the side}} of the tunnel. [...] "What was it you <b>said?</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not hear." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I understand, Sir John; but, as I have <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not think}} {{we should all be}} told until the blow is ready to be struck, as they would be afraid that some one might inform against them, if time and {{opportunity}} were granted them." ...|$|E
60|$|Where {{are those}} brutes, your enemies, <b>said</b> <b>I,</b> <b>do</b> {{you know where}} they are gone? There they lye, sir, said he, {{pointing}} to a thicket of trees; my heart trembles, for fear they have seen us, and heard you speak, if they have, they will certainly murther us all.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{have not}} the {{slightest}} idea of {{falling in love with}} him. In spite of what I <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> hope that I can help it. And then I feel to him just as though he were my brother. I've got almost to know what it would be to have a brother." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not know, but {{we could}} try a dog and see. So he sent out an aide-de-camp to give the order to add the dog.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{it was n't}} a lie," [...] Punch would begin, {{charging}} into a laboured {{explanation that}} landed him more hopelessly in the mire. [...] "I <b>said</b> that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> n't say my prayers twice over in the day, and that was on Tuesday. Once <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> <b>I</b> know <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> but Harry <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> n't," [...] and so forth, till the tension brought tears, and he was dismissed from the table in disgrace.|$|R
6000|$|... "What could I say? Of course <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not know. <b>I</b> {{suppose he}} was meditating whether you would live here {{and ask him}} to dinner on Sundays!" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{have been}} led to say these few words, not at all from a desire to {{supplement}} my father's biography of himself, but to mention the main incidents in his life after he had finished his own record. In what I have here <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not think I have exceeded his instructions.|$|E
60|$|As I have above <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not {{discern the}} purpose of the writer of this paper; but it would be {{impossible}} to illustrate more clearly this chronic insanity of infidel thought which makes all nature spectral; while, with exactly correspondent and reflective power, whatever is dreadful or disordered in external things reproduces itself in disease of the human mind affected by them.|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot help that," [...] he said stoutly. [...] "People {{often say}} things of each other, in private, {{especially}} if they are out of temper, that they don't quite mean, and it would make terrible mischief if such things were repeated. Whatever your father <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not want to hear it, and it would be very wrong of you to repeat it." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{explained}} my situation, but <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not doubt}} {{but the two}} ships would gradually drift together. [...] "Is there no one to lower your boat?" [...] I asked.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not see how}} a {{blind man}} could be a guide: but at that he laughed aloud, and said his stick was eyes enough for an eagle.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was very}} dull, {{and there was}} nothing more to be <b>said.</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> come away early, and perhaps have given affront. I hope you will accept the {{compliment}} implied." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will open}} that packet, {{but from what}} my mother <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not {{think it will be}} of any {{interest}} to me, now. I fancy, by what she said, that it contained simply my father's instructions as to what she was to do, in the event of his death during the campaign. I don't see what else it can be." ...|$|E
60|$|The present was my next {{experiment}} of this kind, which I {{purpose to}} describe more at length, for convenience putting {{the experience of}} two years into one. As I have <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not propose to write an ode to dejection, but to brag as lustily as chanticleer in the morning, standing on his roost, if only to wake my neighbors up.|$|E
60|$|By {{all that}} I have <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not deny but {{that many of}} the people of God may die corporeally, by the hand of the beast, in this second war that shall be made by him against the {{witnesses}}. But should as many more die, that will not prove that that death will be that that by the killing of the witnesses is intended.|$|E
6000|$|Why {{this was}} <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not understand; but Rupert laughed at it, {{as if it}} were a capital thing. To mend the matter, he added, a little boisterously for him-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Aunt Maria said so. She <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not feel. Oh, if I {{could only}} die before he grows up to let one see it. Why wont {{you begin to}} hate me?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not know}} for certain; but that when my mate {{went in for}} grub, two days before, he had heard say that you had been along there that morning.|$|R
60|$|Then, {{seeing that}} the commandant was utterly uncompromising, Marais went up to his nephew and whispered {{to him for a}} while. What he <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know. The result of it was, however, that after favouring both Retief and myself with an angry scowl, Pereira turned and walked to where his horse stood, mounted it, and rode off, {{followed}} by two Hottentot after-riders.|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly. At {{the same}} time, after {{what you have}} <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not feel {{justified}} in deciding on this matter entirely by myself. One of Lord Holchester's executors {{is now in the}} house. There can be no impropriety in your seeing him--if you wish it. You are at liberty to say, from me, that I leave it entirely to his discretion to decide what ought to be done." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{you agree}} with him? My dear aunt (as you have often <b>said),</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> nothing like other people. I am {{interested}} in this case. I cannot abandon a forlorn {{woman who has been}} confided to me to the tender mercies of strangers, so long as there is any hope of my making discoveries which may be instrumental in restoring her to herself--perhaps, also, in restoring her to her friends.|$|E
6000|$|Something {{gleamed in}} the shadow of the nearer bungalow, and a man's voice {{answered}} from within. What he <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not catch, but suddenly I heard Nettie calling very distinctly, [...] "We've been bathing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly! <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not understand." [...] The {{feeling of}} having scored a point made Derek {{feel a little}} better. [...] "I admit it. Your {{behaviour}} is incomprehensible. Where did you meet this fellow?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not understand, and he {{said what}} he wanted was my true name, for he guessed I picked up this one since I stole my last chickens. They all laughed loudly at that.|$|R
