40|$|The world’s most {{expensive}} <b>motor</b> <b>fuel</b> (gasoline, diesel and LPG) is sold most {{likely in the}} Republic of Turkey. This paper investigates the key {{issues related to the}} <b>motor</b> <b>fuel</b> prices in Turkey. First of all, the paper analyses the main reason behind high prices, namely <b>motor</b> <b>fuel</b> taxes in Turkey. Then, it estimates the elasticity of <b>motor</b> <b>fuel</b> demand in Turkey using an econometric analysis. The findings indicate that <b>motor</b> <b>fuel</b> demand in Turkey is quite inelastic and, therefore, not responsive to price increases caused by an increase in either pre-tax prices or taxes. Therefore, fuel market in Turkey is open to opportunistic behaviour by firms (through excessive profits) and the government (through excessive taxes). Besides, the paper focuses on the impact of high <b>motor</b> <b>fuel</b> prices on road transport associated activities, including the pattern of passenger transportation, motorization rate, fuel use, total kilometers travelled and CO 2 emissions from road transportation. The impact of <b>motor</b> <b>fuel</b> prices on income distribution in Turkey and Turkish public opinion about high <b>motor</b> <b>fuel</b> prices are also among the subjects investigated {{in the course of the}} study. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} motor {{transport}} on air pollution, especially in big cities, is constantly increasing {{due to the}} rapid growth of the number of cars, which is accompanied by increased consumption of fuels derived from petroleum. In view of the significant influence of the quality of <b>motor</b> <b>fuels</b> on the indicators of vehicles operation, there is an urgent need to improve it. The aim of this work is {{to solve the problem of}} choice and justification of the priority areas to improve the environmental and performance properties of <b>motor</b> <b>fuels.</b> Analysis was carried out on the influence of the chemical content of <b>motor</b> <b>fuels</b> on their environmental and operational properties. The requirements for <b>motor</b> <b>fuel</b> quality based on analytical investigation were formulated. Medium-term and strategic measures for the oil refining industry to improve the quality of <b>motor</b> <b>fuels</b> were justified. A tech-nology of high-quality <b>motor</b> <b>fuel</b> production based on a highly efficient residueless oil refining scheme was developed. A highly effective multifunctional additive for the integrated and rapid improvement of <b>motor</b> <b>fuel</b> quality was developed and comprehensively investigated. Keywords:, environmental and operational characteristics of vehicles, multifunctional <b>fuel</b> additive, <b>motor</b> <b>fuels,</b> oil-refining industry, residueless oil refining. ...|$|R

50|$|The BC {{government}} {{chose not}} to reduce the carbon tax and/or other taxes on <b>motor</b> <b>fuels</b> such as transportation infrastructure and transit taxes and then add the HST. This decision meant that businesses which purchase <b>motor</b> <b>fuel</b> to operate their businesses were unable to deduct any of the provincial taxes they pay on <b>motor</b> <b>fuels</b> from the HST they collect on their sales. This outcome is particularly harsh on businesses {{that had not been}} required to collect the PST but must use <b>motor</b> <b>fuels</b> to operate their businesses, such as sightseeing and adventure tour businesses.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the issue of {{transparency}} in the pricing process for <b>motor</b> <b>fuels,</b> vis-à-vis the collusion charges between oil companies (for which no evidence is found) and the «myth» of «one» national price for <b>motor</b> <b>fuels.</b> Such an approach ignores both the competition between oil companies, and the large geographical differences. The paper concludes by identifying some structural rigidities in the <b>motor</b> <b>fuel</b> distribution, that are largely due to legislation or regulatory failures. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Motor</b> <b>fuel</b> {{taxes at}} {{state and federal}} levels have {{traditionally}} been earmarked for transportation investments, supporting road construction, maintenance, and operations, and increasingly public transit. Recently, elected officials {{have been reluctant to}} raise fuel taxes despite increases in the cost of transportation programs. Other forms of support, especially borrowing and local sales taxes are playing larger roles in transportation finance. Raising fuel taxes would be more effective, efficient and equitable than the alternatives that are increasingly more popular. It is difficult to find support among elected officials for proposals to raise taxes of any sort. Yet, from whatever direction I approach transportation policy, I uncover reasons that <b>motor</b> <b>fuel</b> taxes should be higher. Unless the community represented by readers of this journal make these arguments {{they are likely to be}} completely unknown to governors, legislators, and citizens who have a great deal to gain from higher <b>motor</b> <b>fuel</b> taxes.

25|$|One early {{example of}} {{inventory}} proportionality {{used in a}} retail application in the United States was for <b>motor</b> <b>fuel.</b> <b>Motor</b> <b>fuel</b> (e.g. gasoline) is generally stored in underground storage tanks. The motorists {{do not know whether}} they are buying gasoline off the top or bottom of the tank, nor need they care. Additionally, these storage tanks have a maximum capacity and cannot be overfilled. Finally, the product is expensive. Inventory proportionality is used to balance the inventories of the different grades of <b>motor</b> <b>fuel,</b> each stored in dedicated tanks, in proportion to the sales of each grade. Excess inventory is not seen or valued by the consumer, so it is simply cash sunk (literally) into the ground. Inventory proportionality minimizes the amount of excess inventory carried in underground storage tanks. This application for <b>motor</b> <b>fuel</b> was first developed and implemented by Petrolsoft Corporation in 1990 for Chevron Products Company. Most major oil companies use such systems today.|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} based on the {{application}} of mathematical methods of statistical analysis {{that can be used to}} predict the development of <b>motor</b> <b>fuel</b> consumption in the Republic of Serbia. It {{is based on}} the linear dependence of consumption growth of <b>motor</b> <b>fuel</b> from the development of gross domestic product per capita, which is then corrected by introducing five additional influencing parameters. The model results indicate that the total consumption of <b>motor</b> <b>fuels</b> in Serbia from 2010 to 2025 will be increased by 26. 5 %. Individual consumption of <b>motor</b> <b>fuels</b> shows different market tendencies. Diesel fuel consumption expects to continue intensive growth to 2025, even though slightly slower than the achievements in the last decade. The current trend of declining demand for gasoline will be stopped from 2014 - 2015, then followed by slow growth of demand by 2025.
