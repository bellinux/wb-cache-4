5000|$|Metal fires {{represent}} a unique hazard {{because people are}} often {{not aware of the}} characteristics of these fires and are not properly prepared to fight them. Therefore, even a <b>small</b> <b>metal</b> fire <b>can</b> spread and become a larger fire in the surrounding ordinary combustible materials. Certain metals burn in contact with air or water (for example, sodium), which exaggerate this risk. Generally speaking, masses of combustible metals do not represent great fire risks because heat is conducted away from hot spots so efficiently that the heat of combustion cannot be maintained. In consequence, significant heat energy is required to ignite a contiguous mass of combustible metal. Generally, metal fires are a hazard when the metal {{is in the form of}} sawdust, machine shavings or other metal [...] "fines", which combust more rapidly than larger blocks. <b>Metal</b> fires <b>can</b> be ignited by the same ignition sources that would start other common fires.|$|R

30|$|Davidson and Mainfort’s (2008) {{findings}} illustrate {{what remains}} of the nineteenth century clothing and accessories after 100 -plus years of burial. It can be extrapolated that <b>small</b> <b>metal</b> components <b>can</b> be expected to remain long after the common types of fibers available (e.g., cotton, linen, wool, silk) in the nineteenth century have decayed. This finding leads to preliminary recommendations for green burial practices via the use of clothing and textiles made from natural fibers (e.g., cotton, linen, wool, silk) with a minimum of non-textile fastenings and other components. As Bellacouche suggests, a natural burial that uses wool felt made from the wool of local sheep reduces the carbon footprint of shrouds and eco-coffins (Bellacouche, n.d.). Therefore, locally sourced materials should be used whenever possible. Further, soil composition and local microflora in natural burial grounds should be examined so that textiles can be chosen to be compatible with desired rates of decay.|$|R
30|$|In addition, if CNT {{emitters}} are operated at a {{high voltage}} or {{at a high}} electric field, electrical arcing (or vacuum breakdown) can occur. Arcing can be initiated by the removed CNTs[17], impurities on the CNTs or substrates[18, 19], protrusion of CNTs[10], low operating vacuum[10], and a very high electric field[20 – 23]. Since arcing is accompanied with a very high current flow and it can produce a plasma channel near the emitter, CNTs are seriously damaged or sometimes CNTs are almost completely removed from the substrate by the arcing events[17, 20]. Detachment of CNTs from a substrate is an irreversible catastrophic phenomenon for a device operation[14]. In addition to the detachment of CNTs, arcing induces a sudden voltage drop, and thus, device operation is stopped. Therefore, for a stable operation of a device using CNT emitters, arcing should be prevented. Particularly, CNT emitters on <b>small</b> <b>metal</b> tips (diameter < 1 mm) are necessary for miniature X-ray tubes[1 – 4] and micro-focus X-ray tubes[6, 7]. <b>Small</b> <b>metal</b> tips produce much higher electric field than flat substrates at the same applied voltage due to their sharp geometry. As a consequence, CNT emitters on <b>small</b> <b>metal</b> tips <b>can</b> suffer from much serious and frequent arcing, and hence, stable operation of the CNT emitters against arcing is a big issue[4, 14].|$|R

40|$|Diamond and zinc-blende {{photonic}} crystals are studied both in {{the purely}} dielectric case and {{in the presence of}} small inclusions of a low absorbing metal. It is shown that <b>small</b> <b>metal</b> inclusions <b>can</b> have a dramatic effect on the photonic band structure. Several complete photonic band gaps (CPBG’s) can open in the spectrum, between the 2 nd- 3 rd, 5 th- 6 th, and 8 th- 9 th bands.

The 2 nd- 3 rd CPBG is the most important CPBG, because it is the most stable against disorder. For a diamond and zinc-blende structure of nonoverlapping dielectric and metallodielectric spheres, a CPBG begins to decrease with an increasing dielectric contrast roughly at the point where another CPBG starts to open–a kind of gap competition. A CPBG can even shrink to zero when the dielectric contrast increases further. Metal inclusions have the biggest effect for th...|$|R
40|$|The {{morphology}} of <b>small</b> <b>metal</b> clusters <b>can</b> have a {{big impact}} on their electronic, magnetic, and chemical properties. This has been shown earlier, for example, for Au(20) clusters on MgO(001), where planar and tetrahedral geometries are possible for the gold atoms. While the planar geometry is more desirable for catalytic applications, it is disfavored in the usual situation. While earlier suggestions that have been made for tilting this balance in favor of the planar isomer are of considerable fundamental interest, they do not easily lend themselves to practical applications. Here, we suggest a conceptually simple but practicable way of achieving the same goal: viz., by doping the MgO substrate with Al atoms. We show, by performing density functional theory calculations, that this stabilizes the planar over the tetrahedral arrangement by an energy difference that is linearly proportional to the dopant concentration and is insensitive to the position of the dopant atom. The charge transferred to the Au cluster also depends monotonically on the doping concentration. This work is of interest for possible applications in the field of gold nanocatalysis...|$|R

While microporous carbons are excellent adsorbents for small molecules they are not as effective for larger species. A new low temperature approach to activation using an oxygen gas pulsing technique to achieve a carbon with controllable meso/micropore structure is described which also minimises metal sintering. The porosity of the samples was analysed by nitrogen adsorption at 77 K. Microporous metal-doped ASC carbon showed significant increases in the level of mesoporosity, its mesopore volume increasing from 0. 06 to 0. 24 cm 3 g− 1. However, undoped BPL carbon treated under the same conditions remained unchanged. The catalytic effect of the metals in the ASC carbon is thought to account for the observed mesopore development.
