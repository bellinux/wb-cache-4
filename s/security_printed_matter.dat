Another descriptor that is useful in describing the materials produced by <b>Printed</b> <b>Matter</b> is book art.

5000|$|The legal {{analysis}} of this issue speaks in terms of [...] "printed matter" [...] that is imprinted upon a [...] "substrate." [...] For example, letters might be printed {{on a piece of}} paper as substrate, in an extreme case. Or digitized information (the <b>printed</b> <b>matter),</b> such as a jpeg file representative of the Mona Lisa, might be encoded in an EPROM memory chip as substrate. A computer program (the <b>printed</b> <b>matter)</b> might be encoded in a computer-readable medium such as a hard disk (the substrate)----and thus be the subject of a so-called Beauregard claim. The current {{legal analysis}}, as expressed in the definitive decision on <b>printed</b> <b>matter,</b> In re Gulack, is as follows: The differences between a newly claimed substrate bearing <b>printed</b> <b>matter</b> and a prior art substrate, where the only point of departure from the prior art is in the <b>printed</b> <b>matter</b> itself, are not entitled to patentable weight unless the <b>printed</b> <b>matter</b> and the substrate have a new and unobvious functional relationship. The analysis is thus essentially an obviousness analysis under section 103 of the patent law, rather than (as it was in earlier times) an analysis of statutory subject matter under what is now section 101 of the patent law.|$|R

40|$|The <b>printed</b> <b>matter</b> {{doctrine}} is {{a branch of}} the section 101 doctrine of patent eligibility that, among other things, prevents the patenting of technical texts and diagrams. The contemporary formulation of the {{doctrine is}} highly problematic. It borders on incoherency in many of its applications, and it lacks any recognized grounding in the Patent Act. Yet, despite its shortcomings, courts have not abandoned the <b>printed</b> <b>matter</b> doctrine, likely because the core applications of the doctrine place limits on the reach of the patent regime that are widely viewed as both intuitively 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 7 correct 2 ̆ 2 and normatively desirable. Instead of abandoning the doctrine, courts have marginalized it. They have retained the substantive effects of the <b>printed</b> <b>matter</b> doctrine but avoided analyzing it whenever possible. This Article adopts a different approach: it takes the <b>printed</b> <b>matter</b> doctrine seriously. It reinterprets the <b>printed</b> <b>matter</b> doctrine as the sign doctrine, revealing both the conceptual coherence hidden in the doctrine 2 ̆ 7 s historical applications and the doctrine 2 ̆ 7 s as-of-yet unnoticed statutory grounding. The key to this reconceptualization is recognizing that the <b>printed</b> <b>matter</b> doctrine is in effect already based on semiotic principles. The <b>printed</b> <b>matter</b> doctrine purports to be about information, but it is actually about signs. It purports to curtail the patenting of worldly artifacts, but it actually curbs the reach ofpatent protection into mental representations in the human mind. To support these arguments, this Article offers a course in 2 ̆ 2 Semiotics 101 2 ̆ 2 : a semiotics primer strategically targeted on the principles that prove to be relevant to the section 101 doctrine ofpatent eligibility. This Article also examines one unexpected consequence of taking the <b>printed</b> <b>matter</b> doctrine seriously and adopting a semiotic framework. It reconsiders the patentability of a class of software inventions which are defined here as 2 ̆ 2 computer models. 2 ̆ 2 As a matter of semiotic logic, the routine patentability of newly invented computer models under the contemporary patent eligibility doctrine cannot be reconciled with the categorical unpatentability of mechanical measuring devices with new labels under the <b>printed</b> <b>matter</b> doctrine...|$|R
