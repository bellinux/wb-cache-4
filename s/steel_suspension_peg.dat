The Union Bridge is in the foreground, but its main span has been replaced, {{after many years of}} ferry service only, with a <b>steel</b> <b>suspension</b> bridge.|$|R
50|$|The {{bottom of}} the balloon is {{attached}} to a parachute, which is then attached by <b>steel</b> <b>suspension</b> cables to the payload. A flight is terminated by firing an explosive squib which separates the parachute from the balloon. A rip line simultaneously tears open the top of the balloon. The balloon quickly deflates and falls to the ground, to be recovered and disposed of (balloons are single use). The payload descends, suspended by the parachute, and is recovered by the ground crew.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of quasi-static and dynamic testing of glass fiber-reinforced polyester leaf suspension for rail freight vehicles named Euroleaf. The principal elements of the suspension's design and manufacturing process are initially summarized. Comparison between quasi-static tests and finite element predictions are then presented. The Euroleaf suspension have been mounted on a tipper wagon and tested dynamically at tare and full load on a purpose-built shaker rig. A shaker rig dynamic testing methodology has been pioneered for rail vehicles, which follows closely road vehicle suspension dynamic testing methodology. The use and evaluation of this methodology have demonstrated that the Euroleaf suspension is dynamically much softer than <b>steel</b> <b>suspensions</b> even though it is statically much stiffer. As a consequence, the suspension dynamic loading at laden loading conditions is reduced compared to the most advanced <b>steel</b> leaf <b>suspension</b> over shaker rig track tests...|$|R
50|$|As of January 6, 2010, the {{suspension}} {{bridge to the}} light house was closed to public access. According to the Federal Highway Administration, the bridge, which was 56 years old, started to rust. It underwent repairs in 1979 and again in 1991, but the metal components {{were not able to}} stand up to the sea spray. The new span reopened April 13, 2012. The new bridge construction cost a little over $1 million. It is made of tropical hardwood with <b>steel</b> <b>suspension</b> cables and attachments.|$|R
25|$|The {{intermediate}} cars sit on type MD530 bogies with <b>steel</b> <b>suspension</b> and an {{axle base}} of 2500mm. New wheels have {{a diameter of}} 920mm. They are replaced when they reach a diameter of 860mm. The cars are coupled 900mm above the rails by a semi-automatic coupling that was designed specifically for the ICE1. It couples two brake pipes, two electric trainlines, cables and two fibre optic cables. The passage between two cars is 1.1m wide and 2.05m high. Unlike on the InterCityExperimental, they are not positive locked on the outside.|$|R
50|$|Engines are {{identical}} 3.0 litre V6 units tuned by Kit Berta to produce approximately 350 hp. Chassis (tubular <b>steel),</b> <b>suspension</b> (control front, independent rear), tires (Pirelli PZero slicks on 18 inch cast aluminium wheels) and gearboxes (Mark Saenz H-Pattern 5 speed) are all identical control items. The vehicles also run a uniform body kit consisting of front splitter/air dam, side skirts, and rear wing. Body modifications {{are allowed to}} present a more race oriented look (such as flared wheel arches and widened bodies), but this is also strictly controlled to keep all the vehicles even.|$|R
5000|$|The Kingston-Port Ewen Suspension Bridge, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the [...] "Rondout Creek bridge", [...] "Old Bridge" [...] or [...] "Wurts Street Bridge", is a <b>steel</b> <b>suspension</b> bridge spanning Rondout Creek, near where it empties into the Hudson River. It connects the City of Kingston to the north, with the village of Port Ewen to the south.
