Brian laments that he sacrificed his core beliefs for nothing, but Lois intervenes because he helped ban cannabis (and she also points out how Stewie got to build a nice fort from all of Brian's unsold books). A distraught Quagmire arrives at the household and informs Peter that he is <b>still</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> James and offers a reward of $50.

25|$|Due to {{the views}} and history, {{homes in the}} area still command a high price.
