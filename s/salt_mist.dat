Following the voluntary phaseout of PFOS by 3 M, EPA took prompt regulatory action on March 11, 2002, 5 and December 9, 2002, 6 by publishing two significant new use rules (SNURs) under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) to limit any future manufacture or importation of 88 PFAS chemicals specifically included in that phaseout. Furthermore, on October 9, 2007, 7 EPA published another SNUR on 183 additional PFAS chemicals.

40|$|AbstractQuantitative {{characterization}} techniques {{based on}} fracture mechanics were proposed {{and used to}} examine the interface strength in multilayered structures. Novel in situ micro-fracture testing for nanolayers inside a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) is developed to observe fracture evolution during bending deformation of nanolayered films. Other quantitative technique on interface fracture mechanics has been the 4 -point bending or double cantilever beam bending methods. In this paper we will discuss about these two techniques and their applications. In particular, the Double Cantilever Beam bending test method using Delaminator v 8. 2 Adhesion testing system has been used to quantify the adhesion strength between the Solar PV backsheet and encapsulant. The environmental conditions in tropical countries makes the photovoltaics components vulnerable to <b>salt</b> <b>mist</b> and water vapour as well as acid penetration. Under moisture condition, the hydrolysis reaction of water vapour with backsheet materials release acetic acid, causing delamination and further corrosion of the encapsulant and inter-metallic connectors on solar cells by the <b>salt</b> <b>mist</b> leading to electrical shorts, heat accumulation and fire. Understanding the interface strength between these two materials and its degradation with typical environments in tropical and near-ocean regions is instrumental to enable robust and reliable solar PV technology for such regions...|$|E

Laspra, a micritic limestone typical for the Spanish region of Asturias, and Repedea, an oolitic limestone from Moldavia, Romania were selected for the present study, due to their regional / national significance and level of usage. As for the siloxane-based water repellents, three worldwide used products, namely Lotexan-N, Silres® BS 290 and Tegosivin HL 100 and a newly synthesized nanocomposite material, TMSPMA, obtained starting from the 3 (trimethoxysilyl) propyl methacrylate as a precursor were investigated. The limestones and the water repellents were thoroughly characterized using specific techniques. The coating of the two monumental stones with the mentioned products and the investigation of coating efficiency yielded {{to the conclusion that}} all treatments induce good water repellent properties. The treated limestones were afterwards submitted to different artificially accelerated ageing tests – resistance against UV irradiation, resistance to <b>salt</b> <b>mist</b> action and resistance to SO 2 action in the presence of humidity –, the results being analyzed according to standardized evaluation methods. The durability of the treated stones was proved to depend on both stone characteristics and water repellent chemical structure. All four water repellents induced a good protection against UV irradiation, no significant differences among them being noticed. As far as the resistance to <b>salt</b> <b>mist</b> action is concerned, the product that afforded the best results when applied on Laspra was TMSPMA, and on Repedea, Silres® BS 290 or / and TMSPMA showed the highest efficiency.

These are coating systems based on alkyd and acrylic resins. Anorganic anticorrosion system is represented by a coating created by hot-dip galvanising. A system of duplex protection created by hot-dip galvanising and organic alkyd‑urethane coating system will also be examined. The experimental section of the publication can be divided into two sub-domains. The first is focused on the analysis of the mechanical properties of anticorrosion coating. The analysis is performed via the Erichsen elasticity test according to EN ISO 1520 : 2001 and a pull-off test according to EN ISO 4624 : 2003.

40|$|The {{durability}} of stone building materials {{is an issue}} of utmost importance in the field of monument conservation. In {{order to be able to}} preserve our built cultural heritage, the thorough knowledge of its constituent materials and the understanding of the processes that affect them are indispensable. The main objective of this research was to evaluate the {{durability of}} a special stone type, the crystalline stones, in correlation with their intrinsic characteristics, the petrophysical properties. The crystalline stones are differentiated from the cemented stones on the basis of textural features. Their most important specific property is the usually low, fissure-like porosity. Stone types of significant monumental importance, like the marble or granite belong to this group. The selected materials for this investigation, indeed, are a marble (Macael marble, Spain) and a granite (Silvestre Vilachán granite, Spain). In addition, an andesite (Szob andesite, Hungary) also of significant monumental importance was selected. This way a wide range of crystalline rocks is covered in terms of petrogenesis: stones of metamorphic, magmatic and volcanic origin, which can be of importance in terms of mineralogical, petrological or physical characteristics. After the detailed characterization of the petrophysical properties of the selected stones, their durability was assessed by means of artificial ageing. The applied ageing tests were: the salt crystallization, the frost resistance in pure water and in the presence of soluble salts, the <b>salt</b> <b>mist</b> and the action of SO 2 in the presence of humidity. The research aimed at the understanding of the mechanisms of each weathering process and at finding the petrophysical properties most decisive in the degradation of these materials. Among the several weathering mechanisms, the most important ones were found to be the physical stress due to crystallization pressure of both salt and ice, the thermal fatigue due to cyclic temperature changes and the chemical reactions (mostly the acidic attack) between the mineral phases and the external fluids. The properties that fundamentally control the degradation processes, and thus the durability of stones were found to be: the mineralogical and chemical composition; the hydraulic properties especially the water uptake, the permeability and the drying; the void space structure, especially the void size and aperture size distribution and the connectivity of the porous space; and the thermal and mechanical properties. Because of the complexity of the processes and the high number of determining properties, no mechanisms or characteristics could be identified as typical for crystalline stones. The durability or alterability of each stone type must be assessed according to its properties and not according to the textural or petrophysical classification they belong to. Finally, a critical review of standardized methods is presented, based on which an attempt was made for recommendations of the most adequate methodology for the characterization and durability assessment of crystalline stones...|$|E
40|$|The current {{trend for}} multi-functioning miniaturised devices has driven {{research}} and development of higher density electronics. This has a significant impact on electronics packaging, especially in solder joints with reduction in solder contact area. This current trend has placed a challenge in ensuring the reliability of the soldered joint. Concerns on solder joint reliability in terms of its mechanical, electrical, and corrosion behaviour is critical to the operation of the overall electronic device. This work studies the lead-free solder formulation, Fe/Al added Sn- 1. 0 Ag- 0. 5 Cu (SAC 105) solder alloy, in terms of solder joint integrity exposed to the corrosive environment. Test specimens of printed circuit board (PCB) solder board mounted with solder balls of the mentioned formulations were fabricated. Simulation of corrosive environment using <b>salt</b> <b>mist.</b> A solder ball shear test was performed to observe joint strength (solder/substrate interface). Potentiodynamic polarization was conducted to provide an electrochemical understanding of the corrosion mechanism for these solder alloys in a salt solution. With addition of Al, material experience better passivation that increase the corrosion resistance. The corrosion resistance of Al-added was found better than SAC 105, whilst the Fe added solder was comparable to SAC 105. It {{is interesting to note that}} for Fe-added SAC 105, formation of passivation layer provides resistance towards aqueous environment, which is beneficial as Fe was initially thought to be susceptible to corrosion. Microstructural study and element mapping were carried out to complement the analysis of the potentiodynamic and shear stress studies, especially in correlating the role of intermetallic compounds (IMCs) to mechanical performance. The minor alloying addition of Fe or Al in SAC 105 solder formed intermetallic compounds (IMC) FeSn 2 for Fe-addition, and Al-Cu and Al-Ag for Al addition. The presence of these IMCs have significant impact on mechanical properties after exposure to an aqueous environment. These IMCs, although chemically inert, impose a potential difference between the elements within the alloy and encourage dissolution which results in modification of the mechanical and surface properties. The ball shear test performed has indicated that the addition of Fe/Al to the SAC 105 alloy results in preservation of the joint strength despite excessive exposure to the corrosive environment. Specimens containing solder balls of Fe/Al added SAC 105 have shown to perform similar to SAC 105. The addition of Al has altered the material surface with a more densely-packed corrosion product which hinders the creation of crevices on the surface that may encourage further corrosion. On the other hand, for the case of Fe-added SAC solder, the presence of FeSn 2 IMC through Fe addition created a more noble microstructure within the SAC 105 alloy. Finite element analysis (FEA) simulates the impact of solder ball size on the shear strength of the solder/substrate joint. Conclusively, the evaluation of solder joints of Fe or Al added SAC 105 have shown good mechanical improvement and enhanced corrosion resistance over SAC 105. This demonstrates an improvement of the SAC 105 solder formulation by using cost-effective and commonly available additions such as Fe and Al...|$|E
