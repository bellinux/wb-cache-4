5|$|The AKC {{accepted}} {{registration of}} the new breed in 1926, two years after Miniature Schnauzers {{were introduced to the}} United States. They were originally known as Wirehaired Pinschers. International Kennel Club classifications vary; in the United Kingdom and Australia they fall within the Utility Group, while in Canada they are in the Working Group. In the AKC the Miniature <b>Schnauzer</b> is classed with the terriers. It was recognized by the United Kennel Club in 1948 and also classed as a terrier. The start of the modern Miniature <b>Schnauzer</b> is generally considered to begin with Ch. Dorem Display, the first Miniature <b>Schnauzer</b> to win Best in Show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. He was born 5 April 1945 and lived to be nearly fourteen. Almost every living Miniature <b>Schnauzer</b> in America can trace its lineage back to Dorem Display.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} records surrounding {{development of}} the Standard <b>Schnauzer</b> in Germany come from the late 19th century. They were originally bred to be medium-sized farm dogs in Germany, equally suited to ratting, herding, and guarding property. As time passed, farmers bred the Standard <b>Schnauzer</b> into a smaller, more compact size for ratting by combining it with the Affenpinscher and Miniature Poodle. The first recorded Miniature <b>Schnauzer</b> appeared in 1888, and the first exhibition was held in 1899.|$|E
5|$|The white <b>Schnauzer</b> {{is one of}} four color {{varieties}} of the Miniature <b>Schnauzer</b> currently recognized by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale. However, they are not accepted for conformation showing by the American Kennel Club and Canadian Kennel Club. The controversy rests on the disputed origins of the white variation: whether it was contained within the genes of the originally recognized breed, or whether it was the result of subsequent modifications. Since the other two <b>Schnauzer</b> types have never been available in a white variation, and the original German standard never included white as an acceptable color, the AMSC chooses not to recognize white.|$|E
40|$|Idiopathic {{hypertriglyceridemia}} {{has been}} reported in Miniature <b>Schnauzers.</b> However, studies investigating the prevalence of this disorder in a large population of Miniature <b>Schnauzers</b> are lacking. 192 healthy Miniature <b>Schnauzers</b> and 38 healthy dogs of other breeds (control dogs) were enrolled in this study. Serum triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations were measured and statistically compared between the Miniature <b>Schnauzers</b> and the control group. Dogs were categorized based on their age, and median serum triglyceride concentrations were compared among different age groups. A total of 63 (32. 8 %) of the 192 Miniature <b>Schnauzers</b> had serum triglyceride concentrations above the upper limit of the reference range. In contrast, of the 38 control dogs, only 2 (5. 3 %) had serum triglyceride concentrations above the upper limit of the reference range. The median serum triglyceride concentration in Miniature <b>Schnauzers</b> was 73. 5 mg/dL, which was significantly higher compared to that of the control group (median: 55 mg/dL; p= 0. 0005). Serum cholesterol concentration was above the upper limit of the reference range in 9 (9. 0 %) of 100 Miniature <b>Schnauzers</b> and in 2 (5. 3 %) of the control dogs. Mean serum cholesterol concentrations were not significantly different between the 2 groups (p= 0. 1374). Median serum triglyceride concentrations in Miniature <b>Schnauzers</b> increased significantly with age (p< 0. 0001), and there was a significant positive correlation between serum triglyceride concentration and age (Spearman r= 0. 47; p< 0. 0001). There was no difference in serum triglyceride concentrations between male and female Miniature <b>Schnauzers</b> (p= 0. 48). Healthy Miniature <b>Schnauzers</b> had a high prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia compared to healthy dogs of other breeds. Both the prevalence and severity of hypertriglyceridemia increased with age. To determine whether hypertriglyceridemia in healthy Miniature <b>Schnauzers</b> was associated with increased serum liver enzyme activities, 65 Miniature <b>Schnauzers</b> with normal serum triglyceride concentrations (group 1), 20 Miniature <b>Schnauzers</b> with slightly increased serum triglyceride concentrations (group 2), and 20 Miniature <b>Schnauzers</b> with moderately to severely increased serum triglyceride concentrations (group 3) were evaluated. Questionnaires regarding each dog’s medical history were collected, and serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and ã-glutamyltransferase (GGT) activities were measured. Median serum ALP activity was significantly higher in group 3 than in group 1 or 2, but was not significantly higher in group 2 than in group 1. Median serum ALT activity was significantly higher in group 3 than in group 1, but was not significantly different between any of the other groups. Compared with group 1, group 2 and 3 {{were significantly more likely to}} have an increased serum ALP activity (odds ratio, 26. 2 and 192. 6, respectively). Group 3 was also significantly more likely to have an increased serum ALT activity (odds ratio, 8. 0), serum AST activity (odds ratio, 3. 7), or serum GGT activity (odds ratio, 11. 3), than group 1. Group 3 was significantly more likely (odds ratio, 31. 0) to have. 2 high serum liver enzyme activities than was group 1. Results suggested that moderate to severe hypertriglyceridemia was associated with high serum liver enzyme activities in Miniature <b>Schnauzers...</b>|$|R
5|$|A UK Kennel Club survey {{puts the}} median {{lifespan}} of Miniature <b>Schnauzers</b> {{at a little}} over 12 years. About 20% lived to >15 years. While generally a healthy breed, Miniature <b>Schnauzers</b> may suffer health problems associated with high fat levels. Such problems include hyperlipidemia, which may increase the possibility of pancreatitis, though either may form independently. Other issues which may affect this breed are diabetes, bladder stones and eye problems. Feeding the dog low- or non-fatty and unsweetened foods may help avoid these problems. Miniature <b>Schnauzers</b> are also prone to comedone syndrome, a condition that produces pus filled bumps, usually on their backs, {{which can be treated}} with a variety of methods. Miniature <b>Schnauzers</b> should have their ears dried after swimming due to a risk of infection, especially those with uncropped ears; ear examinations {{should be part of the}} regular annual check up. Miniature <b>Schnauzers</b> are also prone to von Willebrand disease (vWD). vWD in dogs is an inherited bleeding disorder that occurs due to qualitative or quantitative deficiency of von Willebrand factor (vWF), a multimeric protein that is required for platelet adhesion.|$|R
5|$|Giant <b>Schnauzers</b> require regular grooming. Their beard {{can collect}} drool and food particles, making {{frequent}} cleanings essential. If being shown, their coat {{needs to be}} stripped every two to four weeks. If they are simply a companion animal, the coat can be clipped instead. Some Giant <b>Schnauzers</b> have an allergy to shampoo.|$|R
5|$|The Giant <b>Schnauzer</b> is {{a working}} breed of dog {{developed}} in the 17th century in Germany. It is {{the largest of the}} three breeds of Schnauzerthe other two breeds being the Standard <b>Schnauzer</b> and the Miniature <b>Schnauzer.</b> Numerous breeds were used in its development, including the black Great Dane, the Bouvier des Flandres, and the German Pinscher. Originally bred to assist on farms by driving livestock to market and guarding the farmer's property, the breed eventually moved into the city, where it worked guarding breweries, butchers' shops, stockyards and factories. It was unknown outside of Bavaria until it became popular as a military dog during World War I and World War II.|$|E
5|$|In modern times, the Giant <b>Schnauzer</b> {{is used as}} {{a police}} dog; is trained for obedience, dog agility, herding, search and rescue, and schutzhund; and is shown in {{conformation}} shows. They are also used for carting. In Europe, the breed is considered {{to be more of a}} working dog than a show dog. The focus in many European <b>Schnauzer</b> clubs is not so much on conformation shows, but on the working ability of the breed. In several countries, including Germany, dogs must achieve a Schutzhund Champion title before they can qualify to be a conformation champion.|$|E
5|$|The Giant <b>Schnauzer</b> was {{originally}} bred as a multipurpose farm dog for guarding property and driving animals to market. By {{the turn of}} the 20th century the Giant <b>Schnauzer</b> was being used as a watchdog at factories, breweries, butcheries, and stockyards throughout Bavaria. It was unknown outside Bavaria until it was used as a military dog in World War I and World War II. The first Giant Schnauzers were imported to America in the 1930s, but they remained rare until the 1960s, when the breed became popular. In 1962, there were 23 new Giant Schnauzers registered with the American Kennel Club; in 1974 this number was 386; in 1984 it was over 800 and in 1987 it was around 1000 animals. In 2012, there were 94 new dogs registered, down from 95 in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Some Giant <b>Schnauzers</b> develop central {{diabetes}} insipidus, {{autosomal recessive}} hypothyroidism, selective malabsorption of cobalamin, narcolepsy, cataplexy, and various seizure disorders. Some are also sensitive to sulphonamides and gold. Bone diseases and joint problems are also an issue. The most common {{causes of death}} in Giant <b>Schnauzers</b> are lymphoma and liver cancer, followed by heart attacks and heart failure.|$|R
50|$|Standard <b>Schnauzers</b> {{are around}} 1.5 ft tall at the {{shoulder}} and weigh 30 to 45 lb. They are {{in the group of}} working dogs.

5|$|The first Giant Schnauzers {{emerged from}} Swabia in the German state of Bavaria, and Württemberg in the 17th century. These {{original}} Giant Schnauzers were considered a rough-coated {{version of the}} German pinscher breeds, and their hair was thought to help them withstand the harsh German winters and bites from vermin. The origins of the breed are unclear, but sources speculate it originated through some combination of black Great Danes, German Shepherds, Rottweilers, Dobermans, Boxers, Bouvier des Flandres, Thuringian Shepherds, and the Standard <b>Schnauzer.</b>|$|E
5|$|They have dense coarse {{coat that}} protects {{them from the}} weather and from vermin. Giant Schnauzers come in two color patterns: Solid black, and a color known as pepper and salt, with banded hairs of {{alternating}} white and black, appearing gray hairs at a distance. Where legal, they are shown with cropped ears and docked tails. Like other schnauzers, they have a distinct beard and eyebrows. Today, the Giant <b>Schnauzer</b> participates in numerous dog sports, including Schutzhund. It is also used as a police dog.|$|E
5|$|Schnauzers have a {{specific}} groom cut that is standard among the <b>Schnauzer</b> breed. Schnauzers require regular grooming, either by stripping (mostly seen in show dogs), or by clipping (a short-cut usually reserved for family pets). Stripping removes the loose, dead coat; it may be done by hand, called finger stripping, or plucking, or with a stripping knife; either way, it is a laborious process. Many Miniature Schnauzers who are family pets have regular grooming appointments to have their hair clipped; clipping, using a mechanical clippers (or shaver), produces a soft, silky, skin-close trim. Whether stripped or clipped, the coat is close at the body, and falls into a fringe-like foundation on its undercarriage, called furnishings, which can be left to grow, but must be combed regularly. All Schnauzers, whether they are Miniatures, Standards, or Giants, often sport a beard, created by allowing the hair around their noses to grow out. Left unclipped or unstripped, the body hair will grow two to four inches, and will often tangle into mats and curls.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Schnauzers</b> have {{distinctive}} beards and long, feathery eyebrows. They {{are generally}} either a {{salt and pepper}} color, black, or white, {{but they can be}} brown also. Some owners shave their <b>Schnauzers</b> down the back while the hairs on their legs are kept long and curly, but this changes the coat colour, so show <b>schnauzers</b> especially will have their back coat [...] "stripped" [...] by hand, to encourage the salt and pepper pattern to emerge. It was traditional to have the tails docked and the ears cropped to give an alert appearance. It was common to crop the ears and dock the tails on working dogs. As these are ratters, these procedures don't give the rat anything to grab on to when being attacked and therefore cannot fight back. Cropping and docking are now illegal in the European Union, Australia and New Zealand, and are becoming less common elsewhere. The <b>schnauzer's</b> beard and leg hair should be brushed often to prevent mats from forming.|$|R
40|$|Background: Primary {{hypothyroidism}} is {{a common}} endocrinopathy in dogs. In contrast, central hypothyroidism is rare in this species. Objectives: The objective {{of this article is}} to describe the occurrence and clinical presentation of central hypothyroidism in Miniature <b>Schnauzers.</b> Additionally, the possible role of the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) -releasing hormone receptor (TRHR) gene and the TSH beta (TSHB) gene was investigated. Animals: Miniature <b>Schnauzers</b> with proven central hypothyroidism, based on scintigraphy, and the results of a 3 -day-TSH-stimulation test, or a TSH-releasing hormone (TRH) -stimulation test or both, presented to the Department of Clinical Sciences of Companion Animals at Utrecht University or the Department of Medicine and Clinical Biology of Small Animals at Ghent University from 2008 to 2012. Methods: Retrospective study. Pituitary function tests, thyroid scintigraphy, and computed tomography (CT) of the pituitary area were performed. Gene fragments of affected dogs and controls were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Subsequently, the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequences of the products were analyzed. Results: Central hypothyroidism was diagnosed in 7 Miniature <b>Schnauzers.</b> Three dogs had disproportionate dwarfism and at least one of them had a combined deficiency of TSH and prolactin. No disease-causing mutations were found in the TSHB gene and the exons of the TRHR gene of these <b>Schnauzers.</b> Conclusions and clinical importance: Central hypothyroidism could be underdiagnosed in Miniature <b>Schnauzers</b> with hypothyroidism, especially in those of normal stature. The fact that this rare disorder occurred in 7 dogs from the same breed suggests that central hypothyroidism could have a genetic background in Miniature <b>Schnauzers...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between hyperlipidemia and pancreatitis remains obscure in dogs. The {{aim of the}} present study was to investigate any possible association between hyperlipidemia and pancreatitis in dogs. In the first part of the study, Miniature <b>Schnauzers</b> with hypertriglyceridemia were found to have significantly higher serum cPLI concentrations than Miniature <b>Schnauzers</b> with normal serum triglyceride concentrations (P= 0. 0001). Also, Miniature <b>Schnauzers</b> with severe hypertriglyceridemia (> 862 mg/dL) had 4. 5 times higher odds (P= 0. 0343) for having a serum cPLI concentration consistent with pancreatitis. In the second part of the study, 17 Miniature <b>Schnauzers</b> prospectively enrolled with a history of pancreatitis were significantly more likely to have hypertriglyceridemia (71 percent) after resolution of pancreatitis than 34 age-matched Miniature <b>Schnauzers</b> without a history of pancreatitis (33 percent; odds ratio= 5. 02; P= 0. 0163). For the third part of the study, assessment of the feasibility and usefulness of a novel density gradient ultracentrifugation method using NaBiEDTA for lipoprotein profiling in dogs was attempted. Density gradient ultracentrifugation using NaBiEDTA was found to be useful for the study of lipoprotein profiles in dogs. Significant differences were detected in the lipoprotein profiles (mainly involving TRL and specific LDL fractions) among healthy Miniature <b>Schnauzers,</b> dogs of various other breeds, and hypertriglyceridemic Miniature <b>Schnauzers.</b> In the fourth part of the study, the effect of a commercially available low-fat diet on serum lipid and pancreas-specific lipase (Spec cPL) concentrations and lipoprotein profiles in Miniature <b>Schnauzers</b> with primary hypertriglyceridemia was evaluated. The study diet was found to be effective in significantly reducing serum triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations and changing the lipoprotein profiles of the dogs studied within 2 months. However, there was no significant effect of the study diet on serum Spec cPL concentrations. In the last part of the study, serum triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations and lipoprotein profiles were compared between dogs with naturally occurring pancreatitis and healthy dogs. The majority of dogs with naturally occurring pancreatitis had normal serum triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations. Important differences were identified in lipoprotein profiles between dogs with pancreatitis (higher LDL 2, LDL 3, and LDL 4 fractions and lower TRL, HDL 2 a, and HDL 3 c fractions) and healthy control dogs...|$|R

500|$|The Miniature <b>Schnauzer</b> is a {{breed of}} small dog of the <b>Schnauzer</b> type that {{originated}} in Germany in the mid-to-late 19th century. Miniature Schnauzers developed from crosses between the Standard <b>Schnauzer</b> {{and one or}} more smaller breeds such as the Poodle and Affenpinscher, as farmers bred a small dog that was an efficient ratting dog. They are described as [...] "spunky" [...] but aloof dogs, with good guarding tendencies without some guard dogs' predisposition to bite. Miniature Schnauzers are recognized in three colors internationally: solid black, black and silver, and a color known as 'salt and pepper'. There is a controversial fourth color variant in Miniature Schnauzers, pure white, which is not recognized universally.|$|E
500|$|Although the Giant <b>Schnauzer</b> {{is called}} 'Giant', {{this is not}} in {{comparison}} to other large dog breeds such as the Great Dane or the Rottweiler, but instead {{in comparison to the}} Standard and Miniature Schnauzers.

40|$|The plasma lipoproteins of 6 {{clinically}} healthy lipemic miniature <b>schnauzers</b> (HLMS), 11 {{clinically healthy}} non-lipemic miniature <b>schnauzers</b> (HNMS), and 3 diabetic lipemic miniature <b>schnauzers</b> (DLMS) were evaluated {{through the use}} of ultracentrifugation, lipoprotein electrophoresis, and biochemical tests. For comparison, the plasma lipoproteins of 8 healthy dogs of other breeds (HDOB) and 3 diabetic dogs of other breeds (DDOB) were similarly evaluated. Lipemia ranged from slight to marked in the HLMSs, and was marked in the DLMSs. The HDOBs and DDOBs all had clear plasma. Four of the HNMSs had historical evidence of fasting lipemia, yet had clear plasma when sampled for the present study. ^ The lipemic miniature <b>schnauzers</b> (HLMSs and DLMSs) all had hypertriglyceridemia associated with excess VLDL, and the most markedly lipemic dogs had chylomicronemia as well. Hypercholesterolemia and hyperphospholipidemia were present in dogs with marked lipemia; all or most of these excess lipids were associated with the VLDL and chylomicrons. Four of the HLMSs lacked detectable amounts of LDL. Four of the HNMSs had mild hypertriglyceridemias associated with increased amounts of VLDL, and all 4 of these dogs lacked LDL. Two of the hypertriglyceridemic HNMSs were dogs with historical evidence of fasting lipemia. The plasma lipoproteins of the DDOBs were essentially indistinguishable from those of the HDOBs, whereas the lipoproteins of the DLMSs were very {{similar to those of the}} most markedly lipemic HLMSs. ^ The results indicate that the hyperlipidemia of miniature <b>schnauzers</b> is due to a familial disorder resulting in delayed clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins from the circulation. It appears likely that, while some affected dogs have only a type IV hyperlipoproteinemia due to the effects of the familial disorder alone, others have converted to type V hyperlipoproteinemia because of complicating conditions, such as a high fat diet or development of acquired diseases that also cause hypertriglyceridemia. The familial disorder of the miniature <b>schnauzers</b> bears similarities to familial hypertriglyceridemia in humans. Affected dogs may be at risk of developing pancreatitis and/or diabetes mellitus. ...|$|R
