5|$|From 1872 to 1953, and 1954 to 1957, the Scotland {{national}} team {{was appointed by}} a <b>selection</b> <b>committee.</b> Andy Beattie was manager for six matches in 1954 when Scotland competed at their first World Cup. After the tournament the <b>selection</b> <b>committee</b> resumed their duties, continuing until the appointment of Matt Busby in 1958. Busby was initially unable to assume his duties due to the serious injuries he sustained in the Munich air disaster.|$|E
5|$|Each {{participating}} {{team was}} selected by the bowl game's <b>selection</b> <b>committee,</b> which had paid contracts with the participating football conferences. The Chick-fil-A Bowl had the second pick of bowl-eligible teams from the Atlantic Coast Conference and the fifth pick from eligible teams in the Southeastern Conference. In picking Virginia Tech and Tennessee, the <b>selection</b> <b>committee</b> bypassed teams with better or similar records {{in order to create}} a matchup appealing to television audiences. Pregame media coverage focused on the close geographic rivalry between the two teams and the success of Tennessee head coach Lane Kiffin in reversing his team's poor fortune from the previous season.|$|E
5|$|The valid {{nominations}} {{are placed}} before the <b>selection</b> <b>committee</b> constituted by the Government. This twelve member committee {{consists of a}} Chairperson nominated by the Ministry, four Olympians or previous recipients of Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna or Arjuna Award, three sports journalists/experts/commentators, one sportsperson/expert/administrator associated with parasports, one sports administrator, the Director General of SAI, and the Joint Secretary of Department of Sports, with not more than one sportsperson from a particular discipline included in the committee. When instituted in 1991–92, the award was given for the performance by a sportsperson in a year. Based on the suggestions provided by 2014 award <b>selection</b> <b>committee</b> headed by Kapil Dev, the Ministry revised the criteria in February 2015 to consider the performance {{over a period of}} four years.|$|E

5|$|Canada's Walk of Fame accepts {{nominations}} for potential inductees {{from the public}} year-round, culminating with their National Nomination Promotion {{during the month of}} April. In 2000, prior to the introduction of the online voting system, over 30,000 nominations were received via letters, fax and e-mail. Now submissions are accepted on the official Canada's Walk of Fame website and thousands of nominations are received every year, which are then sent to <b>selection</b> <b>committee</b> for consideration.|$|E
5|$|For a given discipline, {{not more}} than two sportspersons, one male and one female, are given highest marks. The {{committee}} may not recommend the award to the sportsperson with the highest marks across disciplines but can only recommend {{the recipient of the}} highest aggregate marks in a particular sports discipline. The recommendations of the <b>selection</b> <b>committee</b> are submitted to the Union Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports for further approval.|$|E
5|$|In {{choosing}} the SEC opponent, the Chick-fil-A Bowl <b>selection</b> <b>committee</b> {{had the right}} to select the first SEC school after the Bowl Championship Series, Cotton Bowl Classic, Capital One Bowl, and Outback Bowl made their selections. Just as in the ACC, the <b>selection</b> <b>committee</b> could not select an SEC team with two fewer losses than the highest available team. After the 2009 regular season ended, SEC champion Alabama was selected for the national championship game, and SEC runner-up Florida was picked by the Sugar Bowl to fill the SEC's BCS tie-in. The Cotton Bowl selected Ole Miss, the Capital One Bowl picked LSU, and the Outback Bowl took Auburn. For its pick, the Chick-fil-A Bowl bypassed local team Georgia (No.2 in the SEC's eastern division) for Tennessee (No.3 in the division) in order to set up a game against two geographic rivals and because Tennessee had defeated Georgia in a head-to-head matchup.|$|E

5|$|In {{choosing}} the SEC opponent, the Chick-fil-A Bowl <b>selection</b> <b>committee</b> {{had the right}} to select the first SEC school after the Bowl Championship Series, Cotton Bowl Classic, Capital One Bowl, and Outback Bowl made their selections. Just as in the ACC, the <b>selection</b> <b>committee</b> could not select an SEC team with two more losses than the highest available team. The bowl earned the right to select these teams via its multimillion-dollar payout system, which guarantees {{a certain amount of money}} to the participating conferences. Prior to 2006, the Chick-fil-A Bowl (then known as the Peach Bowl) matched the No.5 team in the SEC versus the No.3 team in the ACC. After the bowl increased its payout to $2.8million per squad, it then was given the second pick from the ACC, with the Gator Bowl dropping to third.|$|E
5|$|Leeman Bennett, {{the former}} {{head coach of the}} Atlanta Falcons and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, served as {{chairman}} of the <b>selection</b> <b>committee,</b> which had the task of picking the best teams from those made available by the selection criteria set by the two conferences. The committee would have approximately onemonth to select the twoteams that would attract the most people to the game and generate the largest possible television audience. This fact helped eliminate ACC runner-up Georgia Tech from the selection process, as the Yellow Jackets had already played Georgia earlier in the season, thus making a potential Georgia-Georgia Tech showdown less attractive. In addition, that matchup, while attractive to football fans in the Atlanta area (the site of the Chick-fil-A Bowl and home to Georgia Tech), would have less appeal to television viewers outside the Georgia area. Supervising the <b>selection</b> <b>committee</b> was the Chick-fil-A Bowl Executive Committee, which consisted of representatives from various Atlanta businesses and the Chick-fil-A corporation.|$|E

5|$|After Malky MacDonald {{took charge}} of two games on a {{caretaker}} basis, Bobby Brown was appointed manager. Brown was the first Scotland manager to be given full control of the team, as until then the SFA <b>selection</b> <b>committee</b> had continued to choose the players. Scotland achieved {{one of their most}} famous victories in his first game in charge, a 3–2 win against 1966 World Cup winners England at Wembley. The team generally performed well under Brown, but were drawn with West Germany in 1970 FIFA World Cup qualification. Scotland needed to avoid defeat in Hamburg to keep their qualification hopes alive, but lost 3–2.|$|E
