5|$|In the 1964 renumbering, the {{legislative}} designation {{was changed to}} Route 680. SR 17 was officially moved to former Route 5 between <b>San</b> <b>Jose</b> <b>and</b> Warm Springs, which {{had not had a}} signed designation since the Nimitz Freeway (then I-680) was constructed, but this was instead marked as part of SR 238 (which replaced SR 9 north of Mission <b>San</b> <b>Jose),</b> <b>and</b> SR 17 remained signed along the Nimitz Freeway. This was very short-lived, as the Bureau of Public Roads approved a shift in the south end of I-680 in October 1964. The legislature changed the routes in 1965, swapping Routes 17 and 680 south of Warm Springs, and creating a new SR 262 on the short roadway at Warm Springs where they had overlapped to switch sides. However, until I-680 was completed in the early-to-mid 1970s, it remained signed along the Nimitz Freeway, and the old road between <b>San</b> <b>Jose</b> <b>and</b> Warm Springs continued to be marked as SR 238. One more change was made to the routing of I-680: in July 1973, the remainder of SR 21, from Benicia to Fairfield, was added to the Interstate Highway System. This became the new alignment of I-680, and the old route to Vallejo became I-780. The corresponding changes were made by the state legislature in 1976.|$|E
5|$|Between 1703 and 1753, reducciones were {{established}} at <b>San</b> <b>José</b> <b>and</b> San Andrés on Lake Petén Itzá, Santa Ana {{just south of}} the lake, and at San Luis, Santo Toribio and Dolores in the south (not to be confused with Dolores del Lakandon). Each of these mission towns had its own minister who answered to the vicario general with the Spanish garrison at Nuestra Señora de los Remedios y San Pablo. In {{the first decades of the}} 18th century, churches were built in five colonial towns: Dolores, Remedios, San Andrés, <b>San</b> <b>José</b> <b>and</b> Santo Toribio. The church in Dolores was built in 1708; the construction was probably overseen by Juan Antonio Ruiz y Bustamante. In 1699 there were nine priests in Petén but thereafter there was usually a shortage of clergy in colonial Petén. In spite of the objections of the Dominicans who had been working in southern Petén, the Franciscans continued to provide clergy from Yucatán, and it was the Franciscans who oversaw the spiritual welfare of Petén during the colonial period.|$|E

5|$|The Bureau of Public Roads {{approved}} urban {{routes of}} the Interstate Highway System on September 15, 1955, including a loop around the San Francisco Bay, soon numbered I-280 and I-680. The east half (I-680) {{began at the}} interchange of US 101 north of downtown <b>San</b> <b>Jose</b> <b>and</b> followed the Nimitz Freeway (SR 17/Route 69, now I-880) to the split at Warm Springs (the present location of SR 262), SR 21 to Benicia, and Route 74 (no sign route number) to I-80 in Vallejo. The first piece of I-680 freeway built, other than the pre-existing Nimitz Freeway, was in the late 1950s, along the SR 24 overlap between North Main Street in Walnut Creek and Monument Boulevard in Pleasant Hill. A southerly extension, bypassing downtown Walnut Creek to South Main Street, opened on March 22, 1960, connecting with the SR 24 freeway to Oakland. In the next decade, the freeway was completed from Vallejo south to SR 238 at Mission <b>San</b> <b>Jose,</b> <b>and</b> the roadway north from Benicia to Fairfield, which became the only remaining piece of SR 21, was also upgraded to freeway standards.|$|E
5|$|The Proyecto Arqueológico Motul de San José (Motul de San José Archaeological Project) {{has been}} {{investigating}} Motul de <b>San</b> <b>José</b> <b>and</b> its satellites from 1998 to 2008, {{under the direction of}} Antonia Foias of Williams College and Kitty Emery of the Florida Museum of Natural History.

5|$|A {{particularly}} rare feature {{found on}} Motul de San José ceramics {{is the so-called}} X-ray style, showing a figure wearing a mask but also portraying his face underneath it. All the other representations using this rare style are depicted on Late Classic sculptures at sites with which {{it is known that}} Motul de San José had contact at this time, including Dos Pilas, Machaquila, Tikal and Yaxchilan. This X-ray style has been found on at least nine painted vessels from Motul de <b>San</b> <b>José</b> <b>and</b> is also used {{on the west side of}} Stela 2.|$|E

5|$|As {{it connects}} to I-580, I-205 is a frequently-congested major {{commuter}} {{route to the}} Bay Area. Signs on eastbound I-580 instruct travelers to take I-205, SR120, and SR99 to reach Modesto instead of using the direct, but non-freeway, route SR132. I-205 also serves to connect the Bay Area with popular weekend destinations such as Yosemite, Reno, and Lake Tahoe. The Altamont Commuter Express provides commuters with an alternate route over Altamont Pass to <b>San</b> <b>Jose</b> <b>and</b> San Francisco, the latter through a transfer to BART.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} precolonial Guyangan Cave System in Banton, the {{province}} also has several heritage sites built during the Spanish colonial period. In Romblon town, the forts of San Andres and Santiago served as fortifications against Muslim pirates in the 17th century, while the St. Joseph Cathedral and Belfry houses a centuries-old {{image of the}} Santo Niño de Cebú or the Holy Child. Both heritage sites were declared National Cultural Treasures by the National Museum. The town also has two Spanish-era bridges that were declared Important Cultural Treasures. A similar fort in Banton, the centuries-old Fort <b>San</b> <b>Jose</b> <b>and</b> Banton Church, {{were built in the}} 1600s and was also used as defenses against Muslim pirates.|$|E
5|$|Early Classic ceramic finds {{are scarce}} at Motul de <b>San</b> <b>José</b> <b>and</b> {{those that have}} been found were a minor {{component}} in mixed fill deposits. This suggests that Motul de San José was largely abandoned in the Early Classic. The best examples of Early Classic pottery come from outside of Motul de San José itself, with several complete ceramic vessels being recovered during the construction of a modern language school in Trinidad de Nosotros and some fragments of Early Classic pottery being retrieved from a looted chultun at Wakutal.|$|E

5|$|The Ik-style ceramic corpus {{includes}} {{a set of}} features such as hieroglyphs painted in a pink or pale red colour and scenes with dancers wearing masks. One of the most distinctive features is the realistic representation of subjects as they appeared in life, {{something that is very}} rare in Mesoamerican art. The corpus is represented by more than 30 intact vessels, the majority of unknown provenance, which have been compared to ceramic fragments recovered from Motul de <b>San</b> <b>José</b> <b>and</b> its satellite sites. The subject matter of the vessels includes courtly life from the Petén region in the 8th century AD, such as diplomatic representations, feasting, bloodletting, scenes of warriors and the sacrifice of prisoners of war.|$|E
5|$|The {{full extent}} of {{occupation}} and activity in the Motul de San José area is not well understood for the Postclassic Period. It is known {{that there was a}} moderate occupation of the area during the Early Postclassic period, between AD 1000 and AD 1250. Early Postclassic construction and ceramics have been identified at Motul de <b>San</b> <b>José</b> <b>and</b> all of its satellite sites, but construction was small scale and distribution of pottery was limited. La Trinidad de Nosotros was apparently a small village at this time and has produced some of the best examples of Early Postclassic ceramics.|$|E
5|$|Transportation in the San Francisco Bay Area is {{reliant on}} a complex {{multimodal}} infrastructure consisting of roads, bridges, highways, rail, tunnels, airports, and bike and pedestrian paths. The development, maintenance, {{and operation of}} these different modes of transportation are overseen by various agencies, including the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, and the Metropolitan Transportation Commission. These and other organizations collectively manage several interstate highways and state routes, two subway networks, two commuter rail agencies, eight trans-bay bridges, transbay ferry service, local bus service, three international airports (San Francisco, <b>San</b> <b>Jose,</b> <b>and</b> Oakland), and an extensive network of roads, tunnels, and paths such as the San Francisco Bay Trail.|$|E
