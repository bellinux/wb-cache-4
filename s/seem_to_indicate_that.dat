5|$|Thermal {{oxidation}} of trace {{quantities of}} curium hydride (CmH2–3) {{has been reported}} to produce a volatile form of CmO2 and the volatile trioxide CmO3, one of the two known examples of the very rare +6 state for curium. Another observed species was reported to behave similarly to a supposed plutonium tetroxide and was tentatively characterized as CmO4, with curium in the extremely rare +8 state; |journal=Radiochemistry |volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=46–51 |publisher=SP MAIK Nauka/Interperiodica |doi=10.1134/S1066362213010098 }} however, new experiments <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> CmO4 does not exist, and have cast doubt on the existence of PuO4 as well.|$|E
5|$|The {{damage to}} Lal Masjid was extensive. The {{entrance}} hall was completely burned out, the ceiling scorched, {{and the red}} walls above the oval doorway blackened. However, the mosque itself sustained less damage than the Jamia Hafsa seminary. Bullet casings were found all over the mosque roof, and the inside of Lal Masjid was turned coal black from the militants trying to set the mosque on fire using gasoline bombs. Militants used the mosque's two white minarets as vantage points, resulting in damage to the minarets. One minaret was completely destroyed, and its speakers were hanging from their wires. The dome, however, was not damaged during the 36-hour battle. The {{director general of the}} Inter Services Public Relations said photographs of the bodies <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> there were foreigners among the dead.|$|E
25|$|The {{dedication}} of the parish church to St. Petrock would <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> it {{was built on the}} site of an existing British settlement.|$|E

25|$|The above would <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> the print, if {{the work}} of Sadamasu I, belongs to the period 1837-1843, with 1839—as the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston claims—being a likely date.|$|E
25|$|In 270, {{four states}} from the Western Regions {{were said to have}} {{presented}} tribute: Karashahr, Turpan, Shanshan, and Kucha. Some wooden documents from Niya <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> contacts were also maintained with Kashgar and Khotan around this time.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, the {{language}} that is used, Pigeon argued, would <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> the Bill of Rights merely enacts a rule of construction. As such, Pigeon asserted, the Bill of Rights does not allow the courts not to decline to apply the law.|$|E

25|$|Judging {{by these}} family records {{and the fact}} that Policarpa was born between her two {{religious}} brothers, she would appear to have been born between 1791 and 1796. The records also <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> the Salavarrieta family lived in Guaduas and moved to Bogotá after Manuel was born in 1796.|$|E
25|$|In addition, as {{mentioned}} in the tribunal's report, Gunby was apparently successful in rallying his troops who then fired one or two rounds at the oncoming British soldiers which would <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> the Maryland troops were not panicked as Greene's comments, the tribunal's report and Henry Lee's account seem to allude.|$|E
25|$|It was {{originally}} {{believed that this}} process simply awakened the love each of these people already had inside them, allowing them to love without being inhibited by other emotions. Statements by Fatality after her ring is destroyed <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> the conversion process instead forces the convert to feel love regardless of their actual feelings, placing them essentially under mind control.|$|E

25|$|Additionally, {{while most}} {{women in the}} United States {{apparently}} {{have a negative view}} of menopause as a time of deterioration or decline, some studies <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> women from some Asian cultures have an understanding of menopause that focuses on a sense of liberation and celebrates the freedom from the risk of pregnancy. Postmenopausal Indian women can enter Hindu temples and participate in rituals, marking it as a celebration for reaching an age of wisdom and experience.|$|E
25|$|They also practiced {{forms of}} Esoteric Christianity, Mysticism (Christian mysticism), and Rapp often {{spoke of the}} virgin spirit or Goddess named Sophia in his writings. Rapp was very {{influenced}} by the writings of Jakob Böhme, Philipp Jakob Spener, and Emanuel Swedenborg, among others. Also, at Economy, there are glass bottles and literature that <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> the group was interested in (and practiced) alchemy. Other books found in the Harmony Society's library in Economy, include those by the following authors: Christoph Schütz, Gottfried Arnold, Justinus Kerner, Thomas Bromley, Jane Leade, Johann Scheible (Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses), Paracelsus, and Georg von Welling, among others.|$|E
25|$|Since the CMB {{came into}} existence, it has {{apparently}} been modified by several subsequent physical processes, which are collectively {{referred to as}} late-time anisotropy, or secondary anisotropy. When the CMB photons became free to travel unimpeded, ordinary matter in the universe was mostly {{in the form of}} neutral hydrogen and helium atoms. However, observations of galaxies today <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> most of the volume of the intergalactic medium (IGM) consists of ionized material (since there are few absorption lines due to hydrogen atoms). This implies a period of reionization during which some of the material of the universe was broken into hydrogen ions.|$|E

25|$|Based on the Pairi {{inscription}} {{dated to}} her 3rd Regnal Year, it appears she enjoyed a sole reign. How {{much of her}} reign was as coregent and how much as sole ruler {{is a matter of}} debate and speculation. The same tomb inscription mentions an Amun temple in Thebes, perhaps a mortuary complex, which would <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> the Amun proscription had abated and the traditional religion was being restored towards the end of her reign. Since much of her funeral equipment was used in Tutankhamen's burial, it seems fairly certain she was denied a pharaonic burial by her successor. The reasons for this remain speculation, as does a regency with Tutankhaten.|$|E
25|$|It {{is not yet}} known {{exactly how}} much wave energy is {{available}} to heat the corona. Results published in 2004 {{using data from the}} TRACE spacecraft <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> there are waves in the solar atmosphere at frequencies as high as 100 mHz (10 second period). Measurements of the temperature of different ions in the solar wind with the UVCS instrument aboard SOHO give strong indirect evidence that there are waves at frequencies as high as 200Hz, well into the range of human hearing. These waves are very difficult to detect under normal circumstances, but evidence collected during solar eclipses by teams from Williams College suggest the presences of such waves in the 1–10Hz range.|$|E
25|$|When the Europeans {{began to}} explore the islands in the late Middle Ages, they {{encountered}} several indigenous peoples living at a Neolithic level of technology. Although the prehistory of the settlement of the Canary Islands is still unclear, linguistic and genetic analyses <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> {{at least some of}} these inhabitants shared a common origin with the Berbers of Tamazgha. The pre-colonial inhabitants came to be known collectively as the Guanches, although Guanches was originally the name for only the indigenous inhabitants of Tenerife. From the 14th century onward, numerous visits were made by sailors from Majorca, Portugal and Genoa. Lancelotto Malocello settled on Lanzarote in 1312. The Majorcans established a mission with a bishop in the islands that lasted from 1350 to 1400.|$|E

25|$|Having {{achieved}} the chief {{object of his}} career, Alexander spent {{the last decade of}} his life consolidating his position in Ross. His charters <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> he was chiefly based at the castles of Dingwall and Inverness, and rarely anywhere else. The large number of charters issued by Alexander at Inverness is probably explained by his role as Justiciar of Scotia. Alexander's move east led to less direct lordship in the west, his original political heartland. Alexander's bastard sons Uisdean (Hugh of Sleat) and Gilleasbaig ("Celestine") were given Sleat and Lochalsh respectively, Domhnall Ballach became more independent in Islay and Kintyre, Clan MacLeod kindred took greater control in Skye and Lewis, Clan MacLean greater control in Mull and Clan MacKintosh greater control in Lochaber.|$|E
25|$|Both {{iconography}} and the finds {{of human}} skeletons in ritual contexts <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> human sacrifice {{played a significant}} part in Moche religious practices. These rites appear to have involved the elite as key actors in a spectacle of costumed participants, monumental settings and possibly the ritual consumption of blood. The tumi was a crescent-shaped metal knife used in sacrifices. While some scholars, such as Christopher B. Donnan and Izumi Shimada, argue that the sacrificial victims were the losers of ritual battles among local elites, others, such as John Verano and Richard Sutter, suggest that the sacrificial victims were warriors captured in territorial battles between the Moche and other nearby societies. Excavations in plazas near Moche huacas have found groups of people sacrificed together and the skeletons of young men deliberately excarnated, perhaps for temple displays.|$|E
25|$|Hermann Schögl, a Swiss Egyptologist, {{agrees with}} the medical and DNA {{findings}} of the teams working under Zahi Hawass, but disputes several of the identifications of the royal and noble mummies. Schögl agrees that the head injuries which the Lady received were lethal, and has suggested that she {{was killed in a}} chariot accident. Schögl believes that the Younger Lady is Nefertiti, and that she was killed in a chariot accident during regnal year 14 of Akhenaten's reign. However, the archaeological findings from Akhenaten's reign <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> Nefertiti was still alive during regnal year 16, two years following the date Schögl has chosen for her death. Marianne Eaton-Krauss, another Egyptologist, finds Schögl's alternative royal genealogy for the 18th dynasty and his attempted reconstruction of the final years of Akhenaten's reign to be rather unconvincing.|$|E
5|$|More recently, {{the most}} {{extensive}} collection of phonetic data so far in Mongolian studies {{has been applied to}} a partial account of stress placement in the closely related Chakhar dialect. The conclusion is drawn that di- and trisyllabic words with a short first syllable are stressed on the second syllable. But if their first syllable is long, then the data for different acoustic parameters <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> support conflicting conclusions: intensity data often <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> the first syllable is stressed, while F0 <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> it is the second syllable that is stressed.|$|R
40|$|Lattice work, {{exploring}} the Higgs mass triviality bound, <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> a strongly interacting scalar {{sector in the}} minimal standard model cannot exist while low energy QCD phenomenology <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> it could. We attack this puzzle using the 1 /N expansion and discover a simple criterion for selecting a lattice action that {{is more likely to}} produce a heavy Higgs particle. Our large $N$ calculation suggests that the Higgs mass bound might be around $ 850 GeV$, which is about 30 % higher than previously obtained...|$|R
