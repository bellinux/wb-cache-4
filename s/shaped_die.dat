Aluminium Silicon Carbide (Al-SiC) nano-MMC has better mechanical properties than micro-MMC and has extremely high strength and hardness. The Al-SiC nano-composites were fabricated using powder metallurgy method to produce a more uniform distributed structure. Compactions of the nano-composites were performed using hydraulic press and a cylindrical <b>shaped</b> <b>die.</b> Two compaction loads, 15 Ton and 20 Ton, have been used to fabricate the nano-composite. The Al-SiC nano-composites have been sintered in two different temperatures. Green uniaxial press compacts in the different compaction load of 15 Ton and 20 Ton were sintered at the temperatures of 580 °C and 600 °C. The heating rate of the sintering process was 5 °C/min and the sintering time varied between at 4 hour and 5 hour. Hardness and density of the nano-composites were investigated. Besides that, the microstructure of sintered nano-composites has been examined and characterized. It was found that the compaction load and sintering temperatures have significantly affected the mechanical properties and microstructure of the nano-composites. Green and theoretical density increased with the increment of compaction pressure. Besides that, the nano-composites have a better hardness value with higher compaction load and higher sintering temperature. It is found in the research that the nano-composite with 20 Ton compaction load and 600 °C sintering temperature provided better hardness value and microstructure as compared to the samples fabricated by other compaction load and sintering temperature.

40|$|In {{subatomic}} particle physics, unstable particles {{can be studied}} with a so-called vertex detector placed inside a particle accelerator. A detecting unit close to the accelerator bunch of charged particles must {{be separated from the}} accelerator vacuum. A thin sheet with a complex 3 D shape prevents the detector vacuum from polluting the accelerator vacuum. Hence, this sheet should be completely leak tight with respect to gases. To produce such a complex thin sheet, superplastic forming can be very attractive if a small number of products is needed. This is a forming process in which a sheet of superplastic material is pressed into a one-sided die by means of gas pressure. In order to develop a material model which can be used in superplastic forming simulations, uniaxial and biaxial experiments are necessary. The uniaxial, tensile, experiments provide information about the one-dimensional material data, such as the stress as a function of equivalent plastic strain and strain rate. These data are extracted from the experiments by using inverse modeling, i. e. simulation of the tensile experiment. To fit these curves into a general material model, three parts in the uniaxial mechanical behavior are considered: initial flow stress, strain hardening and strain softening caused by void growth. Since failure in superplastic materials is preceded by the nucleation and growth of cavities inside the material, the void volume fractions of the tested specimens were also observed. A very important factor in this research is the study of the permeability of the formed sheet with respect to gas. If internal voids start to coalesce, through-thickness channels will start to form, thereby providing a gas leak path. To study the twodimensional behavior, including the gas leakage, bulge experiments were performed. Within these experiments, circular sheets were pressed into a cylindrically <b>shaped</b> <b>die.</b> From these experiments it followed that the plastic straining is dependent on an applied backpressure during the forming stage.

40|$|Abstract Due {{to their}} special shapes, compositions, {{chemical}} and physical properties, one dimensional (1 D) or quasi 1 D metal oxide nanostructures are widely employed in gas sensor devices and many others. Tetrapods (TPs) nanostructures {{are one of}} the many different ZnO shapes, that could be exploited for high-performance chemical sensors. TPs structures can be obtained by vapor phase growth, which is a simple and cost-effective approach for growing micro and nanoparticles on a relatively large scale. Microsystems technology intrinsically offers a powerful tool to obtain low cost, high efficiency and long-term devices. In Microsystems technology, micromachined hotplates are mainly used for sensor applications where the active sensing material is deposited onto the membrane integrated with electrical stimuli and readout. The microhotplate presents a series of advantages such as miniaturized size, fast response, high sensitivity, low power consumption and implementable selectivity. In this view, a nanostructured layer on a thin membrane allows for increasing the sensing performance and obtaining a highly sensitive sensor, while decreasing power consumption. The current efforts to integrate nanostructures on a microdevices, lack to find out a cost-efficient method. In this thesis the process for the fabrication of a Micro Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) based gas sensor that integrates a ZnO TPs layer is successfully developed. In particular, the integration of the nanostructures is achieved using a cost-effective patterning method. TPs are dispersed in a 2 -propanol (IPA) suspension and precipitated onto the membrane. The nanostructures form a sensitive layer patterned through a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) physical mask with a central window. The deposition of TPs is performed by centrifugation in order to obtain a homogeneous dispersion and a as thin as possible packed layer on the membrane. The final device is a square <b>shaped</b> <b>die,</b> with a suspended Si 3 N 4 membrane in the centre. The interdigitated Au/Ti electrodes and a Pt/Ta resistor are fabricated on the suspended Si 3 N 4 membrane. In particular, the Pt/Ta resistor is embedded in a dielectric layer in order to optimize the temperature distribution and is used both for heating the microhotplate and getting temperature readout. A highly porous film of entangled ZnO TPs is deposited between the interdigitated electrodes ensuring the electrical contact. Such a device is able to respond as a variable resistance as a function of gas target concentration at determinate temperatures. The device is tested by varying the concentration of target gases in the atmosphere of a test chamber. The sensor response proves the device functionality and, with the top-down integration approach, enables Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) productio...|$|E
40|$|This thesis has {{presented}} experimental and finite element (FE) {{analyses of the}} static and ultrasonic forming of two metals; aluminium 1050 and magnesium AM 50. Aluminium and magnesium {{are considered to be}} soft metals and can be easily shaped by any of the main industrial metalworking processes. Frequently aluminium and magnesium {{have been the subject of}} research studies. These two metals most commonly chosen in manufacturing industry because of their cost, mechanical properties and flexibility in processing. In this research, simple compression and forming tests were designed and the effects of superimposed ultrasonic excitation on workpiece and die, which is tuned to a longitudinal mode at 20. 8 kHz, were studied via stress-strain measurements. Research through experiments and finite element simulations studies in the application of ultrasonic excitation has been carried out to gain quantitative understanding of the mechanisms of improvement in ultrasonic forming characteristics, such as a reduction in material flow stress and oscillatory stress. This research study has shown these mechanisms by applying ultrasonic vibration to the tool and die in the forming test and, similarly, effects were measured and predicted in the experimental and numerical analysis. The development and application of high power ultrasonic techniques in forming processes required the use of specifically designed ultrasonic components to correctly transmit the energy from the transducer to the workpiece and die interface. The application along with the ultrasonic vibration amplitude required for the process, were considered in order to design the most suitable horn profile. In this study, a 20 kHz transducer was used to provide up to 10 µm of peak-to-peak vibration amplitude, depending on the generator setting. Therefore, the booster and horn were designed to provide a range of ultrasonic vibration amplitudes between 5 to 20 µm and also used as a tool and die in the study of ultrasonic metal forming. The horn was designed using finite element modelling (FEM), and modal frequencies and associated mode shapes were subsequently confirmed using experimental modal analysis (EMA). The ultrasonic system has been measured and calculated as having a longitudinal mode of vibration at 20. 8 kHz and to provide an amplitude gain of four. In this study, a generator uses mains electricity to generate a high frequency ultrasonic signal to drive the transducer, which is tuned to a specific frequency of 20 kHz. The booster and horn were designed to meet the criteria of transducer, which is to provide a longitudinal vibration at tuned frequency of 20 kHz. However, the profile of booster and horn have been measured and calculated as having a longitudinal mode of vibration at 20. 8 kHz, which is considered close to the transducer tuned frequency. The review of previous studies of superimposed ultrasonic excitation on upsetting showed that the most experimental characterisations of the volume effects mainly depended on an interpretation of measurements of the mean flow stress, and have neglected the oscillatory stress. In this study, the characteristics of oscillatory stress and the material behaviour in plastic deformation when superimposed ultrasonic excitation is applied on a static compression test under dry friction were considered. The effects were explained in terms of flow stress reduction, oscillatory stress, mean flow stress, maximum and minimum path of oscillatory stress in the stress-strain diagram. The results showed that the static flow stress of compressive deformation was lowered by the ultrasonic vibration superimposed on the static load and this phenomenon has been referred to as the material softening mechanism which is influenced by volume and surface effects. The volume effect is defined as a reduction in flow stress of the material being formed and the surface effect is defined as a reduction in frictional conditions at the interface between the vibrating device and the workpiece. Finite element models were used to investigate numerically the volume and surface effects during ultrasonically assisted compression. The finite element models were developed using material model parameters which were identified from the experimental analysis. The influence of volume and surface effects were investigated separately in the FE model and it was shown that the volume effect dominated the effective material softening results during ultrasonic excitation. The application of ultrasonic excitation on metals under plastic deformation conditions has been investigated previously. Most researchers have reported that superimposing ultrasonic excitation on metal working processes reduced the material flow stress. A further study of superimposed ultrasonic excitation on a static load during elastic deformation in metal working was not investigated, so it is not possible to determine the effect of ultrasonic excitation on the material. In this study, the investigation of oscillatory stress behaviour in the ultrasonic compression test of cylinder metal specimens during elastic deformation was carried out. In the stress-strain diagram, the ultrasonic vibration was shown to have lowered the static flow stress during elastic deformation under dry contact conditions and it was found that the reduction in static flow stress linearly increased with ultrasonic vibration amplitude. The stress reduction was influenced by volume and surface effects which occurred during the superimposed ultrasonic excitation. The results also showed that the maximum path of oscillatory stress exceeded the static flow stress, however, the mean flow stress is lower than the static flow stress at the onset of ultrasonic excitation. To investigate the influence that volume and surface effects have on material softening during experimental compression tests, a series of FE models were developed. As mentioned previously, the FE models were developed using material model parameters which were identified from the experimental analysis in Figure A 1, however, the mechanism of flow stress reduction which is related to acoustic softening and friction reduction which is labelled as (i) cannot be predicted in FE models. The FE models adopted the material softening effects in order to simulate realistic stress reduction compared with experimental results. The significant stress reduction in the FE analysis was obtained by adjusting the yield stress and contact conditions parameter. It was concluded that the surface effect dominated the stress reduction during metal upsetting test in elastic deformation. The study continued to a simple forming test where samples of flat sheet metal were forced into a <b>shaped</b> <b>die</b> by a shaped plunger on a test machine. The results of this study illustrated how ultrasonically assisted metal forming resulted in a lowering of the static forming force during ultrasonic excitation of the die. As a result, the static forming force was seen to be reduced by ultrasonic excitation of the die and the path of the maximum oscillatory force was observed to be parallel to or below the path of the static forming force. Force reduction was measured in these experiments using a high power ultrasonic transducer and also by tuning the die and then the punch during the metal forming test. It was found that a good coupling between punch, specimen and die allowed ultrasonic energy to be effectively transferred into the materials during superimposed ultrasonic excitation in the static forming test. This thesis has concluded that evaluation of the benefits of ultrasonic excitation not only relied on measurements of the mean flow stress alone but also on measurement of the oscillatory stress during superimposed ultrasonic excitation on forming tests. Findings on the effectiveness of ultrasonic excitation led the study to recognize that the lack of understanding of the effects of ultrasonic excitation on the forming process has resulted in difficulties in maximising the benefits and applications of this technology. ...|$|E
