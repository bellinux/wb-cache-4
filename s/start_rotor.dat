50|$|A major {{engineering}} refinement in the C.19 was {{the means}} to mechanically <b>start</b> the main <b>rotor</b> spinning; in earlier de la Cierva designs, the rotor had to be turned by hand or by pulling a rope, unless there was space for a takeoff run. In the C.19 Mk I, this was done aerodynamically. The tail unit of this mark was a biplane structure with endplate fins and rudders. To <b>start</b> the <b>rotor,</b> elevators and tailplanes were fixed in a near vertical position and the engine started. The wash from the propeller was deflected upwards by the tail unit through the rotor, rotating it. For the first time, this made the autogyro independent of ground crew when starting, and private ownership was a practical proposition.|$|R

A brute-force attack is possible: one could imagine using 100 code clerks who each tried to decode a message using 1000 distinct rotor settings. The Poles developed card catalogs so they could easily find rotor positions; Britain built [...] "EINS" [...] (a common German word) catalogs. Less intensive methods were also possible. If all message traffic for a day used the same <b>rotor</b> <b>starting</b> position, then frequency analysis for each position could recover the polyalphabetic substitutions. If different <b>rotor</b> <b>starting</b> positions were used, then overlapping portions of a message could be found using the index of coincidence. Many major powers (including the Germans) could break Enigma traffic if they knew the rotor wiring. The German military knew the Enigma was weak.|$|R

These bacteria modulate their swimming direction towards favorable environments by biasing {{the direction of}} flagellar rotation in response to various stimuli. In contrast, Rhodobacter sphaeroides expresses a single subpolar flagellum that rotates only CW and responds tactically {{by a series of}} biased stops and <b>starts.</b> <b>Rotor</b> protein FliG transiently links the MotAB stators to the rotor, to power rotation and also has an essential function in flagellar export. In this study, we sought to determine whether the FliG protein confers directionality on flagellar motors by testing the functional properties of R. sphaeroides FliG and a chimeric FliG protein, EcRsFliG (N-terminal and central domains of E. coli FliG fused to an R. sphaeroides FliG C terminus), in an E. coli FliG null background. The EcRsFliG chimera supported flagellar synthesis and bidirectional rotation; bacteria swam and tumbled in a manner qualitatively {{similar to that of the}} wild type and showed chemotaxis to amino acids. Thus, the FliG C terminus alone does not confer the unidirectional stop-start character of the R. sphaeroides flagellar motor, and its conformation continues to support tactic, switch-protein interactions in a bidirectional motor, despite its evolutionary history in a bacterium with a unidirectional motor...|$|R

50|$|The three {{rotor blades}} were {{mounted on a}} ring {{assembly}} supported by bearings, allowing free rotation around the fuselage. At {{the end of each}} was a ramjet. To <b>start</b> the <b>rotors</b> spinning, simple rockets would have been used. As the speed increased, the flow of air would have been sufficient for the ramjets to work and the rockets would expire. The pitch of the blades could be varied with the effect of changing the speed and the lift produced. There was no reaction torque to cause a counter rotation of the fuselage, since the rotor blades were driven at their tips by the ramjets. Fuel was carried in the fuselage tanks, and was piped through the centre support ring and along the rotors to the jets.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe straight-bladed {{vertical}} axis wind turbine (SB-VAWT) receives more attentions recently for its goodness of simple design, low cost and good maintenance.

Based on the wind tunnel tests data, a small scaled combined type SB-VAWT (CSB-VAWT) which has 50 W rated power output was designed.

Because there is often no explicit <b>starting</b> mechanism, the <b>rotor</b> of a motor operating from a constant frequency mains supply must be very light so that it is capable of reaching running speed within one cycle of the mains frequency. Alternatively, the rotor may be provided with a squirrel cage, so that the motor starts like an induction motor, once the rotor is pulled into synchronism with its magnet, the squirrel cage has no current induced in it and so plays no further part in the operation.|$|R

This was to stop the enciphering clerk from making up a starting position that was not random, for instance AAA or ABCABC. These were listed in an attached booklet. The last security measure implemented at the time, was classifying messages by grade, i.e. general, officer, staff, with fewer cryptographic resources available to personnel the further down the rank hierarchy, and progressively more power cryptography the higher rank you were.|$|R

50|$|If {{the brush}} axis is {{displaced}} {{at an angle}} to the magnetic axis, a net voltage is induced at the brush terminals which will produce current in the armature. The current in the armature circuit will produce its own magnetic field, with North and South poles, but in this condition, the North Pole is not directly under the North pole of the magnetic axis and the South Pole is not directly above the South Pole of the magnetic axis. The poles of the armature are slightly displaced from those of the stator. In this condition, the N-pole of the stator field will repel the N-pole of the rotor field and the S-pole of stator field will repel the S-pole of the rotor field, so the <b>rotor</b> <b>starts</b> rotating.|$|R

Metal mesh gas foil bearings are a low cost alternative to replace oil-lubricated bearings in passenger vehicle turbochargers. However, during <b>rotor</b> <b>start</b> up and shut down, the rotor operates {{in contact with}} the foil bearings thus demanding of a large break-up torque to overcome the dry friction. Early rotor lift-off in the bearings enables nearly friction free operation. Measurements of break-up torque on a metal mesh bearing as a function of shaft speed and static load are obtained in an existing turbocharger driven test rig. Bearing performance characteristics such as power loss and ultimate load capacity are experimentally determined. The bearing experiences the highest torque at low shaft speeds, dropping significantly once the rotor lifts off. Increases in static load lead to an increase in bearing break-up torque and delay rotor lift off to a higher speed...|$|R

The method, which was often memorized by the cipher clerk, was to change the rotor order and the ring positions. The clerk would add 3 to the key lists Rotor number, so when Rotor II was to go into the left hand position, Rotor V would go in instead, and thus the clerk would set alphabet rings on the successive rotors respectively 4,5,6 places. Thus the key lists ring positions KYD would be set to ODJ. A special cue word would initiate these changes, the first of these were called Aldebaran. So the clerks notebook would contain Aldebaran, R 3, L 456 in which R stood for rotor and L for letter.|$|R
