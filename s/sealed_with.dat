5|$|Romeo & Juliet: <b>Sealed</b> <b>with</b> a Kiss is a 2006 American {{animated}} romantic fantasy film loosely {{following the}} play Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare. The film {{is about two}} star-crossed seals, Romeo and Juliet (voiced by Daniel and Patricia Trippet respectively), who fall in love against the wishes of their warring families. It was released in Europe in mid-2006 and on October 27 in the United States.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Three {{dimensional}} solid-fluid interaction {{numerical analysis}} models {{of both the}} finger <b>seal</b> <b>with</b> herringbone-grooved pad and the finger <b>seal</b> <b>with</b> herringbone-grooved rotor were established in order to study the performance of hydrodynamic finger seal. The models investigated fluid radial under pad force and fluid leakage {{as a function of}} both the rotor speed and the high- to low-pressure differential. It was shown that the finger <b>seal</b> <b>with</b> herringbone-grooved structure in pad or in rotor could bring lift force under the finger pad so as to keep the finger seal in non-contacting status. For the two types of finger seal, their load carrying ability and fluid leakage varying with the pressure differential were almost same. In the same velocity of rotor surface, the load carrying capacity of the finger <b>seal</b> <b>with</b> herringbone- grooved rotor was greater and the leakage was less than that of the finger <b>seal</b> <b>with</b> herringbone-grooved pad respectively. With the conditions of rotor structure allowing, it is suggested to select the finger <b>seal</b> <b>with</b> herringbone-grooved rotor first for designing the hydrodynamic finger <b>seal</b> <b>with</b> herringbone-grooved structure...|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Centrifugal compressors are increasingly required to operate in higher pressure, higher speed, and large fluid density. In these conditions, compressors are susceptible to rotordynamic instabilities. To avoid this situation, labyrinth seals have been modified by (a) using swirl brakes, and (b) using shunt injection. In some cases, labyrinth seals have been replaced entirely by honeycomb seals. In shunt injection, the gas is taken from the diff-user or discharge volute, and injected into an upstream cavity of the labyrinth seal. The injection can be radial or against rotation. Even though labyrinth <b>seals</b> <b>with</b> shunt injection have successfully been used since 1970 s, this thesis contains the first measured rotordynamic data for labyrinth <b>seals</b> <b>with</b> shunt injection. A comparison has been made between labyrinth <b>seals,</b> <b>with</b> and without swirl brakes, labyrinth <b>seal</b> <b>with</b> shunt injection (radial and against rotation), and a honeycomb seal. The leakage comparison demonstrates that the honeycomb seal has the best flow control, and the labyrinth <b>seals</b> <b>with</b> shunt injection the worst. For low and medium running speed, and most conditions, the labyrinth <b>seal</b> <b>with</b> injection against rotation has the best rotordynamic stability followed in order by the honeycomb seal, radial shunt injection, and the labyrinth <b>seal</b> <b>with</b> and without swirl brakes. When running speed increases, the effective damping decreases for the labyrinth <b>seal</b> <b>with</b> injection against rotation. For high speed and high pressure ratio across the seal, the honeycomb seals have better rotordynamic performance. In centrifugal compressors, the selection of the seal should be cautiously analyzed. <b>Seals</b> <b>with</b> shunt injection against rotation will have a better performance due to possibility of a higher pressure injection ratio. On the other hand, honeycomb seals will have a better stability control due to the higher density of the fluid...|$|R
5|$|Xenon gas can {{be safely}} kept in normal sealed glass or metal {{containers}} at standard temperature and pressure. However, it readily dissolves in most plastics and rubber, and will gradually escape from a container <b>sealed</b> <b>with</b> such materials. Xenon is non-toxic, although it does dissolve in blood and belongs to {{a select group of}} substances that penetrate the blood–brain barrier, causing mild to full surgical anesthesia when inhaled in high concentrations with oxygen.|$|E
5|$|A {{fusible plug}} is a {{threaded}} metal cylinder usually of bronze, brass or gunmetal, with a tapered hole drilled completely through its length. This hole is <b>sealed</b> <b>with</b> a metal {{of low melting point}} that flows away if a pre-determined, high temperature is reached. The initial {{use of the}} fusible plug was as a safety precaution against low water levels in steam engine boilers, but later applications extended its use to other closed vessels, such as air conditioning systems and tanks for transporting corrosive or liquefied petroleum gasses.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal's {{dominance}} of the decade was <b>sealed</b> <b>with</b> a second FA Cup in 1935–36, winning 1–0 against Sheffield United with a goal from Drake. Arsenal faded in the League somewhat after the 1934–35 title, and were weakened by the retirement of Alex James and the club's inability to replace him, as well as long-term injuries to several other key players such as Herbie Roberts and Joe Hulme. Nevertheless, they won a fifth League title in 1937–38, pipping Wolves {{on the final day}} of the season, to cap off a highly successful decade.|$|E

5|$|From 1978 to 1981, Sai Tso Wan Landfill (晒草灣堆填區) served East Kowloon. Approximately 1.6million tonnes of {{domestic}} waste and commercial waste were {{dumped in the}} site during its four-year operation. The disposed waste stacked up to 65 metres high. After its closure in 1981, it was <b>sealed</b> <b>with</b> soil and planted over with Grasslands and trees. Sin Fat Road, which runs {{up the hill and}} hosts Sceneway Garden Minibus Terminus, was constructed. Sai Tso Wan Landfill was later rebuilt into Sai Tso Wan Recreation Ground.|$|E
5|$|On Richard's {{accession}} {{to the throne}} of England in 1189 Longchamp became Chancellor of England. Longchamp paid 3,000 pounds (£) {{for the office of}} Chancellor. This was followed by an increase in the price of having chancery documents <b>sealed</b> <b>with</b> the Great Seal, necessary for their authentication, perhaps to help Longchamp recoup the cost of office. At the council held at Pipewell on 15September 1189, the King raised Longchamp to the bishopric of Ely. Richard named three other bishops at the same time: Godfrey de Lucy to Winchester, Richard FitzNeal to London, and Hubert Walter to Salisbury. Longchamp was consecrated on 31December 1189 and enthroned at Ely on 6January 1190.|$|E

5|$|The loop itself still exists, {{although}} it was penetrated by a bomb and flooded during the Blitz in the Second World War. Fortunately, the loop had been sealed off years before. In September 1938, during the Sudeten Crisis, when war appeared imminent, the Bakerloo and Northern line tunnels at Embankment were temporarily <b>sealed</b> <b>with</b> concrete to protect against flooding through bombing. The blockage was removed after {{little more than a}} week once the crisis had passed. At the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, the tunnels were blocked again until electrically powered emergency doors could be installed in the tunnel mouths. The tunnels reopened in December 1939.|$|E
5|$|Burial 10 is {{the tomb}} of Yax Nuun Ayiin. It is located beneath Structure 34 in the North Acropolis. The tomb {{contained}} a rich array of offerings, including ceramic vessels and food, and nine youths were sacrificed to accompany the dead king. A dog was also entombed with the deceased king. Pots in the tomb were stuccoed and painted and many demonstrated a blend of Maya and Teotihuacan styles. Among the offerings was an incense-burner {{in the shape of}} an elderly underworld god, sitting on a stool made of human bones and holding a severed head in his hands. The tomb was <b>sealed</b> <b>with</b> a corbel vault, then the pyramid was built on top.|$|E
5|$|The British Admiralty's {{official}} report {{into the}} disaster condemned the defences at Scapa Flow, and censured Sir Wilfred French, Admiral Commanding Orkney and Shetland, for their unprepared state. French {{was placed on}} the retired list, despite having warned the previous summer of Scapa Flow's deficient anti-submarine defences, and volunteering to bring a small ship or submarine himself past the blockships to prove his point. On Churchill's orders, the eastern approaches to Scapa Flow were <b>sealed</b> <b>with</b> concrete causeways linking Lamb Holm, Glimps Holm, Burray and South Ronaldsay to Mainland. Constructed largely by Italian prisoners of war, the Churchill Barriers, as they became known, were essentially complete by September 1944, though they were not opened officially until just after VE Day in May 1945. They now form part of the transport infrastructure of Orkney, carrying the A961 road between the islands.|$|E

5|$|The safety fougasse design had the {{advantage}} that without the propelling charge the fougasse was sufficiently safe {{that it did not}} require a guard. Banks records that installing the charge only when there was clear danger relatively close at hand was a safety feature required to protect the public from accidents. The ammonal used for the main propellant charge is a cheap industrial explosive that is notoriously hygroscopic, becoming less effective when it absorbs moisture. Even though the charge was packed into a rubber bag in a tin and <b>sealed</b> <b>with</b> insulating tape, {{it would not have been}} a good idea to store it for long in the damp conditions of a flame fougasse installation.|$|E
5|$|De Gray's {{ability to}} raise money made him useful to John. In 1213 de Gray mustered 500knights during a period when Philip II was {{threatening}} to invade England, bringing this force over from Ireland along with mounted men-at-arms to support the king in England. In May 1213, John and Innocent finally resolved the dispute over Langton's election to Canterbury, {{and part of the}} settlement was that John gave Ireland and England to Innocent and received them back from the pope, making John a papal vassal. The settlement was <b>sealed</b> <b>with</b> a treaty, to which de Gray was one of the witnesses. After John settled with the papacy, de Gray {{was not included in the}} general pardon, and had to go to Rome to be pardoned. While in that city the bishop was named as one of the guarantors of a new financial arrangement between the king and the pope dealing with feudal payments from England, which lowered the lump sum that had to be paid before Innocent would lift the interdict. After Innocent pardoned de Gray, the pope recommended his election as Bishop of Durham in 1213; but de Gray died during his journey back to England on 18 October 1214, at Saint-Jean-d'Angély in Poitou. He was buried in Norwich Cathedral, but his tomb has not survived.|$|E
5|$|From the 13th century onwards, the Court of Common Pleas could issue its own writs, {{and was not}} {{dependent}} on the Court of Chancery, where such documents usually originated. These were <b>sealed</b> <b>with</b> the Great Seal of the King until at least 1338, along with the seal of the justices; the Chancery writs had their own independent seal. Documents were, from 1350, considered acceptable if only marked with the seal of the justices. In 1344, the king created a separate seal for the Common Pleas, allowing them to process cases without involving the Chancery or the king. The court stood {{on an equal footing}} with the Exchequer of Pleas, Court of Chancery and King's Bench in relation to transferring cases between them. Any errors {{on the part of the}} Common Pleas would be corrected by the King's Bench through a separate action brought there. Thanks to the Bill of Middlesex and other legal fictions, the King's Bench gained much of the Common Pleas's jurisdiction, although the Common Pleas remained the sole place where real property claims could be brought.|$|E

5|$|In summer 1209, {{after the}} Latin Emperor Henry of Flanders (r. 1205–16) quelled a revolt of the Lombard barons of Thessalonica {{and brought the}} Kingdom of Thessalonica under his {{effective}} control, Michael sent envoys to propose an alliance. Henry distrusted Michael's sincerity, but sent an embassy to Epirus with his terms, which amounted to Michael declaring himself a vassal of the Latin Empire. Michael was able to sidestep an outright declaration of submission by offering the hand of his eldest daughter to the Emperor's brother, Eustace, {{and a third of}} his lands as her dowry. Henry accepted, and the peace agreement was <b>sealed</b> <b>with</b> the marriage of Eustace and Michael's daughter. Finally, in early 1210, Michael's envoys, the Bishop of Tzernikon Theodore and Symeon Kounales, met with the Venetian duke of Dyrrhachium, Marino Vallaresso, and negotiated a treaty, confirmed by oath on 20 June. Thereby Michael accepted to become a vassal of Venice, holding his lands in fief from Venice as confirmed in a charter issued by Doge Pietro Ziani (r. 1205–29). Michael granted the Venetians extensive trading privileges and tax exemptions, just as they had enjoyed under the chrysobulls of Emperor Manuel I Komnenos (r. 1143–80), promised to expedite the grain exports to Venice, and to assist in any shipwreck of a Venetian vessel off the Epirote coast. In addition, as a sign of his vassalage he would pay to the Venetian duke of Dyrrhachium an annual tribute of 42 litrai of gold hyperpyra in two instalments, and send annually a rich brocade for the altar of St. Mark's Basilica and one for the Doge.|$|E
