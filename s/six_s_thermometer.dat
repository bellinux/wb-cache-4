5000|$|The [...] "thousand tonner" [...] type {{included}} 26 destroyers in five classes: four Cassins, four Aylwins, <b>six</b> <b>s,</b> <b>six</b> <b>s,</b> and <b>six</b> <b>s.</b> The {{ships were}} commissioned 1913-17. As the type developed the gun armament of four 4 inch (102 mm) guns remained the same, torpedo armament greatly increased, and displacement rose by about 100 tons. The O'Briens introduced the 21 in torpedo to the US destroyer force, {{but the number}} of tubes remained at eight. In the Sampsons, torpedo armament was increased to twelve 21 inch (533 mm) tubes by replacing the twin mounts with triple mounts. The subsequent [...] "flush deck" [...] types retained the gun and torpedo armament of the Sampsons on a new hull with displacement increased by about 100 tons, and with a new engineering plant. The thousand tonners also debuted US destroyer anti-aircraft armament: two 1-pounder (37 mm) autocannons were specified for the Tuckers but not fitted until the Sampsons.|$|R

Her completed hull was launched on 26 October 1912, and construction, including fitting-out, was completed by 1 August 1914, four days after Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. Following the outbreak of World War I, Saida was assigned as the flotilla leader for the First Torpedo Flotilla, which included the <b>six</b> <b>s,</b> <b>six</b> <b>s,</b> ten torpedo boats, and a depot ship. Following the Italian declaration of war against Austria-Hungary in May 1915, most of the Austro-Hungarian fleet sortied in a surprise attack on various points on the Italian coast.

40|$|Fifty {{participants}} {{were exposed to}} a simple discrimination-training procedure during which <b>six</b> <b>S</b> 1 functions were established for six arbitrary stimuli, and S 2 functions were established for a further six stimuli. Following this training, each participant was exposed to one of five conditions. In the S 1 condition, {{participants were}} exposed to a stimulus equivalence training and testing procedure using only the <b>six</b> <b>S</b> 1 stimuli as samples and comparisons. In the S 1 /S 2 condition, participants {{were exposed to the}} same training and testing sequence as in the S 1 condition, the difference being that three S 1 and three S 2 stimuli were used as sample and comparison stimuli, with each set of three corresponding to the trained equivalence relations. In the S 1 /S 2 mixed condition, the S 1 and S 2 stimuli were assigned to their roles as samples and comparisons in a quasi-random order. In the S 2 condition, all <b>six</b> <b>S</b> 2 stimuli were used. The no-function condition served as a control con-dition and employed stimuli for which no stimulus-control functions had been established. The results showed that, on average, participants required more testing trials to form equivalence rela-tions when the stimuli involved were functionally similar rather than functionally different. Moreover, participants required more test trials to form equivalence relations when novel arbitrary stimuli, rather than functionally distinct stimuli, were used as samples and comparisons.
