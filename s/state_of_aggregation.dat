60|$|The most {{interesting}} case {{for us is}} that of the two species of Saxifraga, as this genus is distantly allied to Drosera. Their glands absorb matter from an infusion of raw meat, from solutions of the nitrate and carbonate of ammonia, and apparently from decayed insects. This was shown by the changed dull purple colour of the protoplasm within the cells of the glands, by its <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggregation,</b> and apparently by its more rapid spontaneous movements.|$|E
60|$|Two insurmountable {{objections}} {{are presented}} by this series. The first is, that the progression {{is but a}} broken one. Neptune is denser than Saturn, which, by the hypothesis, it ought not to be. Uranus is denser than Jupiter, which it ought not to be. Uranus is denser than Saturn, and the Earth is denser than Venus--facts which not only give no countenance to, but directly contradict, the alleged explanation. The second objection, still more manifestly fatal, is the low specific gravity of the Sun. If, when {{the matter of the}} Sun filled the orbit of Mercury, its <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggregation</b> was such that the detached ring formed a planet having a specific gravity equal to that of iron; then the Sun itself, now that it has concentrated, should have a specific gravity much greater than that of iron; whereas its specific gravity is only half as much again as that of water. Instead of being far denser than the nearest planet, it is but one-fifth as dense.|$|E
60|$|Turning now to {{the action}} of organic substances, the glands on which bits of raw meat were placed became dark-coloured; and in 18 hrs. their {{contents}} were conspicuously aggregated. Several glands with bits of albumen and fibrin were darkened in between 2 hrs. and 3 hrs.; but in one case the purple colour was completely discharged. Some glands which had caught flies were compared with others close by; and though they did not differ much in colour, there was a marked difference in their <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggregation.</b> In some few instances, however, {{there was no such}} difference, and this appeared to be due to the insects having been caught long ago, so that the glands had recovered their pristine state. In one case, a group of the sessile colourless glands, to which a small fly adhered, presented a peculiar appearance; for they had become purple, owing to purple granular matter coating the cell-walls. I may here mention as a caution that, soon after some of my plants arrived in the spring from Portugal, the glands were not plainly acted on by bits of meat, or insects, or a solution of ammonia--a circumstance for which I cannot account.|$|E

60|$|Without further argument, it will, we think, be {{sufficiently}} {{clear that the}} sciences are none of them separately evolved--are none of them independent either logically or historically; but {{that all of them}} have, in a greater or less degree, required aid and reciprocated it. Indeed, it needs but to throw aside these, and contemplate the mixed character of surrounding phenomena, to at once see that these notions of division and succession in the kinds of knowledge are none of them actually true, but are simple scientific fictions: good, if regarded merely as aids to study; bad, if regarded as representing realities in Nature. Consider them critically, and no facts whatever are presented to our senses uncombined with other facts--no facts whatever but are in some degree disguised by accompanying facts: disguised in such a manner that all must be partially understood before any one can be understood. If it be said, as by M. Comte, that gravitating force should be treated of before other forces, seeing that all things are subject to it, it may on like grounds be said that heat should be first dealt with; seeing that thermal forces are everywhere in action; that the ability of any portion of matter to manifest visible gravitative phenomena depends on its <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggregation,</b> which is determined by heat; that only by the aid of thermology can we explain those apparent exceptions to the gravitating tendency which are presented by steam and smoke, and so establish its universality, and that, indeed, the very existence of the solar system in a solid form is just as much a question of heat as it is one of gravitation.|$|E

50|$|Indirect techniques. As many {{properties}} of colloidal suspensions {{depend on the}} <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggregation</b> of the suspended particles, various indirect techniques {{have been used to}} monitor particle aggregation too. While {{it can be difficult to}} obtain quantitative information on aggregation rates or cluster properties from such experiments, they can be most valuable for practical applications. Among these techniques settling tests are most relevant. When one inspects a series of test tubes with suspensions prepared at different concentration of the flocculant, stable suspensions often remain dispersed, while the unstable ones settle. Automated instruments based on light scattering/transmittance to monitor suspension settling have been developed, and they can be used to probe particle aggregation. One must realize, however, that these techniques may not always reflect the actual aggregation state of a suspension correctly. For example, larger primary particles may settle even in the absence of aggregation, or aggregates that have formed a colloidal gel will remain in suspension. Other indirect techniques capable to monitor the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggregation</b> include, for example, filtration, rheology, absorption of ultrasonic waves, or dielectric properties.|$|E

50|$|Polysilazanes are colorless to {{pale yellow}} liquids or solid materials. Conditional of manufacturing, the liquids often contain {{dissolved}} ammonia {{that can be}} detected by smell. The average molecular weight can range from a few thousand to approximately 100,000 g/mol while the density normally lies around 1 g/cm3. The <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggregation</b> and the viscosity are both dependent on the molecular mass and the molecular macrostructure. Solid polysilazanes are produced by chemical conversion of the liquid materials (crosslinking of smaller molecules).

As a rule, polysilazane solids behave as thermosetting polymers, but in some cases, thermoplastic processing is possible.|$|E
50|$|Thermodynamic data {{is usually}} {{presented}} as a table or chart of function values for one mole of a substance (or {{in the case of}} the steam tables, one kg). A thermodynamic datafile is a set of equation parameters from which the numerical data values can be calculated. Tables and datafiles are usually presented at a standard pressure of 1 bar or 1 atm, but in the case of steam and other industrially important gases, pressure may be included as a variable. Function values depend on the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggregation</b> of the substance, which must be defined for the value to have any meaning. The <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggregation</b> for thermodynamic purposes is the standard state, sometimes called the reference state, and defined by specifying certain conditions. The normal standard state is commonly defined as the most stable physical form of the substance at the specified temperature and a pressure of 1 bar or 1 atm. However, since any non-normal condition could be chosen as a standard state, it must be defined in the context of use. A physical standard state is one that exists for a time sufficient to allow measurements of its properties. The most common physical standard state is one that is stable thermodynamically (i.e., the normal one). It has no tendency to transform into any other physical state. If a substance can exist but is not thermodynamically stable (for example, a supercooled liquid), it is called a metastable state. A non-physical standard state is one whose properties are obtained by extrapolation from a physical state (for example, a solid superheated above the normal melting point, or an ideal gas at a condition where the real gas is non-ideal). Metastable liquids and solids are important because some substances can persist and be used in that state indefinitely. Thermodynamic functions that refer to conditions in the normal standard state are designated with a small superscript °. The relationship between certain physical and thermodynamic properties may be described by an equation of state.|$|E
5000|$|To {{elaborate}} on this, Clausius states {{that in all}} cases in which heat can perform mechanical work, these processes always admit to being reduced to the “alteration {{in some way or}} another of the arrangement of the constituent parts of the body.” To exemplify this, Clausius moves into a discussion of change of state of a body, i.e. solid, liquid, gas. For instance, he states, “when bodies are expanded by heat, their molecules being thus separated from each other: in this case the mutual attractions of the molecules on the one hand, and external opposing forces on the other, insofar as any such are in operation, have to be overcome. Again, the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggregation</b> of bodies is altered by heat, solid bodies rendered liquid, and both solid and liquid bodies being rendered aeriform: here likewise internal forces, and in general external forces also, have to be overcome.” ...|$|E

In this work, a variable concentration of halide vacancies and dipoles has been obtained by irradiating samples at different times after a severe quenching. The influence of these concentrations on the kinetics of coloring has been thoroughly studied for NaCl : Ca++ (100 pprn), NaCl : Mn++ (90 ppm) and NaCl : Pb++ (80 - 600 ppm). The following techniques have been used to characterize the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggregation</b> and charge of the impurity : EPR, UV absorption, photo and thermoluminescence and ionic conductivity. The most important results are : 1) During the first stage of dipole aggregation where the dipole concentration decreases as much as 90 %, the F-coloring efficiency for the three systems is essentially constant. 2) On the contrary, other techniques reveal a number of processes which very strongly depend on the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggregation</b> of the impurity, e. g. a) In NaCl : Ca++, a well defined UV band at 200 mµ appears, whose intensity is proportional to the concentration of dipoles {{at the start of the}} irradiation. b) In NaCl : Mn++, the thermoluminescence and EPR spectra indicate that the rate of the valence changing reactions Mn++ → Mn+ → Mn 0 is strongly dependent on the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggregation</b> of the impurity.
