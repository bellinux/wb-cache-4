5|$|Prior {{to their}} conquest of north China and the {{establishment}} of the Liao dynasty, the Khitans had no written language.

50|$|The {{spread of}} Burmese {{language}} {{was accompanied by}} that of the Burmese <b>script.</b> The <b>script</b> was developed from either the Mon <b>script</b> or the Pyu <b>script.</b> Mainstream scholarship holds that the Burmese <b>script</b> was developed from the Mon <b>script</b> in 1058, a year after Anawrahta's conquest of the Thaton Kingdom. But recent research by Aung-Thwin argues that the Burmese <b>script</b> may instead have been derived from the Pyu <b>script</b> in the 10th century, and that the Burmese <b>script</b> was the parent of the Burma Mon <b>script.</b> He argues that the Mon <b>script</b> found in Burma was sufficiently different from the older Mon <b>script</b> found in the Mon homelands of Dvaravati or Haripunjaya (in present-day Thailand) with no archaeological evidence to prove any linkage between the two. On the other hand, Aung-Thwin continues, the latest archaeological evidence dates the Burmese <b>script</b> 58 to 109 years ahead of the Burma Mon <b>script.</b> The earliest Burma Mon <b>script</b> (at Prome) is dated to 1093 while the earliest Burmese <b>script</b> (the copper-gilt umbrella inscription of the Mahabodhi Temple) is dated to 1035. Indeed, if a recast 18th century copy of an original stone inscription is permissible as evidence, the Burmese <b>script</b> had already been in use at least since 984 CE.|$|R
