60|$|While these general causes {{were at work}} {{a special}} misfortune had befallen the house of Girdlestone. Finding that their fleet of old sailing vessels was too slow and clumsy to compete with more modern ships, they had bought in two first-rate steamers. One was the Providence, a fine <b>screw</b> <b>vessel</b> of twelve hundred tons, {{and the other was}} the Evening Star, {{somewhat}} smaller in size, but both classed A1 at Lloyd's. The former cost twenty-two thousand pounds, and the latter seventeen thousand. Now, Mr. Girdlestone had always had a weakness for petty savings, and in this instance he determined not to insure his new vessels. If the crazy old tubs, for which he had paid fancy premiums for so many years with an eye to an ultimate profit, met with no disaster, surely those new powerful clippers were safe. With their tonnage and horse-power they appeared to him to be superior to all the dangers of the deep. It chanced, however, by that strange luck which would almost make one believe that matters nautical were at the mercy of some particularly malignant demon, that as the Evening Star was steaming up Channel in a dense fog on her return from her second voyage, she ran right into the Providence, which had started that very morning from Liverpool upon her third outward trip. The Providence was almost cut in two, and sank within five minutes, taking down the captain and six of the crew, while the Evening Star was so much damaged about the bows that she put into Falmouth in a sinking condition. That day's work cost the African firm more than five and thirty thousand pounds.|$|E

50|$|The steam {{cargo ship}} was {{originally}} built in 1893 as yard number 406 by British builders Richardson, Duck & Co., located in Thornaby, Stockton-on-Tees. The engine {{was built by}} Blair & Co. Ltd., also in Stockton-on-Tees. The iron cargo ship was launched in June 1893 in Stockton. SS Athen was a single <b>screw</b> <b>vessel</b> with a 1 x 3 cyl. triple expansion engine (serial No. 1149), consisting of two boilers and a single shaft. She managed 9 knots on her trial, and was 2,199 grt, whilst having dimensions of 277.5 and 37.5 feet. The ship was owned by A. C. de Freitas & Co. in Hamburg until 1901, when it was sold to Hamburg Amerikanische Packetfahrt A.G. - Hamburg-Amerika Linie - HAPAG of Hamburg. It was sold again in 1903 to its third and final owners Gätjens & Jarke in Hamburg.|$|E

The words of the Admiralty Order stated she should be [...] "a wood <b>screw</b> <b>vessel</b> complete of Highflyers class in exchange when built". This made her a small wooden frigate to a design by the Surveyor's Department of the Admiralty on 25 April 1847; {{she and her sister}} Highflyer were redesignated as corvettes in 1854. In common with other screw corvettes of the time, she was envisaged as a steam auxiliary, intended to cruise under sail with the steam engine available for assistance. Commensurately she was provided with a full square sailing rig. Her oscillating two-cylinder inclined single-expansion steam engine, provided by the builders, was quite different from Highflyers, but developed broadly the same power — [...] — and drove a single screw.|$|E

50|$|Returning by Route Z, the Mona's Isle {{came under}} fire from German shore {{batteries}} from the French coast. Many shells exploded close to the ship sending plumes of white water {{into the air and}} with water spraying over the decks. A number of shells failed to explode as they hit the ship, but one fell aft and smashed the rudder. The Mona's Isle was a triple <b>screw</b> <b>vessel,</b> so by careful use of port and starboard engines, the ship was able to reach the safety of Dover, but not before a Bf 109 had strafed the ship a couple of times killing 23 and wounding 60 others. Using the same route, two coasters, the Sequacity and the Yewdale headed for Dunkirk, and along the French coast they both came in for the same treatment. Sequacity suffered two direct hits, one into her starboard side, the other into the engine room and she started to sink, the crew being rescued by the Yewdale, which aborted the mission and returned to Dover.|$|E
40|$|Results of a {{computational}} {{study on}} the hydrodynamic perfor- mance of twisted and untwisted rudders for a single <b>screw</b> <b>vessel</b> are presented. Ship flow simulations are performed by using a hybrid RANSE/BEM model. Numerical predictions by RANSE and BEM solvers are validated through comparisons against ex- perimental data for the ship considered in the study. The com- parative analysis of untwisted and twisted rudders is carried out by fully–appended ship flow simulations at uniform ship speed and rudder angles between 0 and 20 degrees. Numerical results predict comparable manoeuvring capabilities for the alternative layouts, whereas the twisted design allows to mitigate negative pressure peaks observed on the untwisted rudder surface over a range of helm angles...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} ship {{manoeuvrability}} has reached nowadays a significant consideration, both for merchant ships, with {{the adoption of}} IMO standards, and naval ships, with the production of various documents by NATO Specialist Teams. In literature many works regarding manoeuvrability of single screw slow/medium speed ships can be found, while a lack of information exists for what regards twin screw ships (cruise ships, RoRo ferries, megayachts, naval vessels), characterised by different form coefficients and more complex stern configuration due to appendages like skegs, shaft lines and brackets that can strongly affect manoeuvrability behaviour. In this hydrodynamic coefficients {{of a series of}} twin screw naval vessels have been evaluated considering different semi-empirical formulations proposed by various authors and standard manoeuvres (turning circle and zig-zag) have been simulated {{with the aid of a}} simulator tool. Discrepancies of predicted manoeuvres with respect to experimental full scale ones have been analysed considering parameters involving stern appendages and hull main dimensions in order to select most suitable regressions to study twin <b>screw</b> <b>vessel</b> manoeuvring performance in the earlier design stages. Moreover, linear hydrodynamic coefficients corrections related to stern appendages contribution have been developed on the basis of results of a system identification technique and of an analysis of a set of experimental data at PMM for a ship model equipped with different stern appendages configurations...|$|E
