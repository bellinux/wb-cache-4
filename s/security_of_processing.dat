The distributed processing could have several advantages for wireless sensor networks. First of all, in WSN computation is typically much less energy consuming than communication. Secondly, in-network processing enables WSN to provide more complex services to application layer, and not only data gathering functionality. However, in addition to computational overhead, in-network {{data processing}} introduces also many challenging <b>security</b> issues. Most <b>of</b> them are still open and require development <b>of</b> innovative <b>security</b> mechanisms.

To remain competitive, mobile devices and applications need to quickly perform tasks with as minimal as possible impact on battery life.

40|$|In recent years, the {{security}} and privacy aspects of IoT has received considerable attention from the industry and research communities. Because IoT will be more pervasive in the everyday life of the citizens {{and it may be}} used in safety related applications (e. g., road transportation), IoT security threats may be more damaging than conventional Internet <b>security</b> threats. Because <b>of</b> <b>processing</b> and memory constraints, the provision <b>of</b> <b>security</b> functions could be quite challenging in IoT. In addition, IoT devices must operate in a dynamic environment in terms of communication interfaces and fast upgrade cycle (e. g., patching), which imposes severe requirements to designer and developers in terms <b>of</b> <b>security.</b> Privacy aspects are also relevant because of the large amount of data collected by IoT sensors.

40|$|Cryptography is an {{essential}} practice required for secure communication between two parties. It preserves the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and authenticity of information thereby enhances the <b>security</b> <b>of</b> the data <b>processing</b> system and the information flow within an organization. Symmetric and asymmetric key cryptography are used for encryption and decryption of a message. Symmetric key cryptography is {{the most commonly used}} cryptography as it is fast and feasible for use in decrypting bulk messages and requires less computer resources. Chosenplaintext attacks have been proposed for symmetric key cryptography as it uses single secret key to encrypt different messages. This paper introduces a novel symmetric key cryptography, where multiple random secret keys can be used to encrypt different messages, which is insecure under cipher text-only attacks, a weaker form of attack than chosenplaintext attacks...|$|R

In association with data interference and data trustworthiness, in the same route as depsky we scatter the data and metadata into differing cloud suppliers, and we apply the puzzle giving computation on the set away data in the cloud supplier. Rather than using plain puzzle offering using open key figures we use Shamir's riddle giving count. Hereafter, rehashing data into multi-fogs by using a multi-offer strategy may lessen the peril of data interference and assemble data respectability.

40|$|How to {{generate}} provably true randomness with minimal assumptions? This question {{is important not}} only for the efficiency and the <b>security</b> <b>of</b> information <b>processing,</b> but also for understanding how extremely unpredictable events are possible in Nature. All current solutions require special structures in the initial source of randomness, or a certain independence relation among two or more sources. Both types of assumptions are impossible to test and difficult to guarantee in practice. Here we show how this fundamental limit can be circumvented by extractors that base security on the validity of physical laws and extract randomness from untrusted quantum devices. In conjunction with the recent work of Miller and Shi (arXiv: 1402 : 0489), our physical randomness extractor uses just a single and general weak source, produces an arbitrarily long and near-uniform output, with a close-to-optimal error, secure against all-powerful quantum adversaries, and tolerating a constant level of implementation imprecision. The source necessarily needs to be unpredictable to the devices, but otherwise can even be known to the adversary. Our central technical contribution, the Equivalence Lemma, provides a general principle for proving composition <b>security</b> <b>of</b> untrusted-device protocols. It implies that unbounded randomness expansion can be achieved simply by cross-feeding any two expansion protocols. In particular, such an unbounded expansion can be made robust, which is known for the first time. Another significant implication is, it enables the secure randomness generation and key distribution using public randomness, such as that broadcast by NIST's Randomness Beacon. Our protocol also provides a method for refuting local hidden variable theories under a weak assumption on the available randomness for choosing the measurement settings.

40|$|Many quantum {{information}} tasks rely on entanglement, {{which is}} used as a resource, for example, to enable efficient and secure communication. Typically, noise, accompanied by loss of entanglement, reduces the efficiency of quantum protocols. We develop and demonstrate experimentally a superdense coding scheme with noise, where the decrease of entanglement in Alice's encoding state does not reduce the efficiency of the information transmission. Having almost fully dephased classical two-photon polarization state at the time of encoding with concurrence 0. 163 ± 0. 007, we reach values of mutual information close to 1. 52 ± 0. 02 (1. 89 ± 0. 05) with 3 -state (4 -state) encoding. This high efficiency relies both on non-Markovian features, that Bob exploits just before his Bell-state measurement, and on very high visibility (99. 6 %± 0. 1 %) of the Hong-Ou-Mandel interference within the experimental set-up.
