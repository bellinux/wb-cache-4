50|$|The Delco <b>ignition</b> <b>system,</b> {{also known}} as the Kettering <b>ignition</b> <b>system,</b> is a type of Inductive {{discharge}} <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> invented by Charles F. Kettering. It was first sold commercially on the 1910 Cadillac and was manufactured by Delco. Over time, this system was used extensively by all automobile and truck manufacturers until the development of capacitor discharge <b>ignition</b> (electronic <b>ignition)</b> <b>systems</b> in the 1960s. Delco <b>ignition</b> <b>systems</b> were also used by a number of early aircraft engines.|$|R

Kettering {{and his company}} Dayton Engineering Laboratories Company (Delco) goes into production for Cadillac. The Kettering <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> is a mechanically-switched version of a flyback boost converter; the transformer is the ignition coil. Variations of this <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> were used in all non-diesel internal combustion engines until the 1960s when it was displaced with capacitive discharge <b>ignition</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R
40|$|With the {{intention}} of improving ignition performance of natural gas engine, a dual-coil <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> was devised according to energy superposition principle. Using Multisim software and experimental apparatus, the variation of secondary voltage along with discharge time interval was studied by taking simulation and experimental methods. The results show that dual-coil <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> can enhance the secondary voltage, increase spark duration and accomplish multiple discharge under different discharge time interval compared with single-coil <b>ignition</b> <b>system.</b> So the dual-coil <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> is conducive to reliable ignition for natural gas engine under different working conditions and it provides a way to optimize the <b>ignition</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R
2500|$|Ballast {{was also}} a {{component}} used in early model automobiles engine [...] that lowered the supply voltage to the <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> after the engine had been started. Starting the engine requires {{a significant amount of}} electrical current from the battery, resulting in an equally significant voltage drop. To allow the engine to start, the <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> was designed to operate on this lower voltage. But once the vehicle was started and the starter disengaged, the normal operating voltage was too high for the <b>ignition</b> <b>system.</b> To avoid this problem, a ballast resistor was inserted in series with the <b>ignition</b> <b>system,</b> resulting in two different operating voltages for the starting and <b>ignition</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{was done to}} examine the effects of elevated initial tube pressure in the Pulse Detonation Engine (PDE). Measured parameters were the ignition time, deflagration to detonation transition (DDT) run-up distance, DDT times, and Chapman-Jouguet (C-J) velocity. Mixed with air, three fuels, i. e., aviation gasoline, ethylene, and hydrogen, were tested at various initial pressures and equivalence ratios. An aftermarket automotive <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> was employed, along with two plasma <b>ignition</b> <b>systems</b> to quantify the benefits of each. Measured results show a reduction in the ignition time of roughly 50 % and in the DDT distance of roughly 30 %, for all three fuels at an initial tube pressure of 3 atmospheres. With atmospheric initial tube pressure, the transient plasma <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> yielded the shortest ignition times, followed by the thermal plasma <b>ignition</b> <b>system,</b> and lastly the aftermarket automotive <b>ignition</b> <b>system.</b> At roughly 2 atmospheres of initial pressure the thermal plasma <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> showed no benefit over the aftermarket automotive <b>ignition</b> <b>system.</b> C-J wave speeds have shown to increase with elevated initial pressure, and agree with numerical results. In addition to the experimental results, a brief Chemkin analysis was done to model the aftermarket automotive <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> to estimate <b>ignition</b> times of the mixtures at pressures that were not tested.

40|$|To improve {{combustion}} {{stability of}} DISI-engines a plasma <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> {{was developed and}} investigated. Due to its special set-up the plasma <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> allows extremely short discharges with much higher efficiency than conventional coil <b>ignition</b> <b>systems.</b> <b>Ignition</b> of lean mixtures is improved by the generation of an enlarged fame kernel at homogeneous and stratified engine operation as well. At stratified engine operation the plasma <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> leads to a larger process window and to slightly higher fuel consumption, {{which is due to}} a shifted process position.

50|$|The term also {{referred}} to a (now obsolete) automobile engine component that lowered the supply voltage to the <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> after the engine had been started. Because cranking the engine causes a very heavy load on the battery, the system voltage can drop quite low during cranking. To allow the engine to start, the <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> was designed to operate on this lower voltage. But once cranking is finished, the normal operating voltage would overload the <b>ignition</b> <b>system.</b> To avoid this problem, a ballast resistor was inserted in series with the <b>ignition</b> <b>system.</b>|$|R

50|$|Laser {{ignition}} {{is considered}} as a potential <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> for non-hypergolic liquid rocket engines and reaction control systems which need an <b>ignition</b> <b>system.</b> Conventional <b>ignition</b> technologies like torch igniters are more complex in sequencing and need additional components like propellant feed lines and valves. Therefore, they are heavy compared to a laser <b>ignition</b> <b>system.</b> Pyrotechnical devices allow only one ignition per unit and imply increased launch pad precautions as they are made of explosives.|$|R
