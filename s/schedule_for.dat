5|$|The {{decompression}} schedule may {{be derived}} from decompression tables, decompression software, or from dive computers, and these are commonly based upon a mathematical model of the body's uptake and release of inert gas as pressure changes. These models, such as the Bühlmann decompression algorithm, are designed to fit empirical data and provide a decompression <b>schedule</b> <b>for</b> a given depth and dive duration.|$|E
5|$|The {{group was}} renamed Gipsy in 1969, which they {{considered}} more macho and Western-sounding. The <b>schedule</b> <b>for</b> the band, {{which had no}} manager, became increasingly busy, since they had begun giving regular performances at Ismail Marzuki Park.

After the contract was won, NSB Anbud announced the <b>schedule</b> <b>for</b> the Gjøvik Line. The number of train services would increase by 40%. Three stations serving the recreational area Nordmarka outside Oslo would be dropped—Elnes, Stryken and Bjørgeseter. Skogsholm tried to make an agreement with NSB to not abandon all the stations, but since this had not {{been part of the}} PSO tender, an agreement could not be made and the service was canceled.|$|E

The promotional campaign stressed the unique qualities of a live theater performance as entertainment over television and film. PCS's productions were presented in the Winningstad and Newmark theatres in Portland through the 2005–2006 season. Portland Center Stage moved to the new Gerding Theater at the Armory beginning with the 2006–2007 season.|$|E
5|$|Disney {{initially}} envisioned Toy Story 2 as a direct-to-video sequel.

When story reels proved promising, Disney upgraded the film to theatrical release, but Pixar was unhappy with the film's quality. Lasseter and the story team redeveloped the entire plot in one weekend. Although most Pixar features take years to develop, the established release date could not be moved and the production <b>schedule</b> <b>for</b> Toy Story 2 was compressed into nine months.|$|E
5|$|Dive tables or {{decompression}} {{tables are}} tabulated data, {{often in the}} form of printed cards or booklets, that allow divers to determine a decompression <b>schedule</b> <b>for</b> a given dive profile and breathing gas. In some cases they may also specify an altitude range. The choice of tables for professional diving use is generally made by the organization employing the divers, and for recreational training it is usually prescribed by the certifying agency, but for recreational purposes the diver is generally free to make use of any of the range of published tables, and for that matter, to modify them to suit himself or herself.|$|E

Using the robotic arm, McArthur, Altman, and Johnson worked through the procedures to inspect the wing leading-edge panels, reinforced carbon-carbon nose cap, and heat shield tiles. After evaluating the weather reports, managers on the ground slightly refined the <b>schedule</b> <b>for</b> landing, opting to bring the shuttle home one orbit early {{to try to avoid}} the possibility of showers that would prevent a landing on Friday. The new landing opportunity would bring the crew home at 10:01am EDT.|$|E
