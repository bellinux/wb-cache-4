By the 20thcentury, fire <b>suppression</b> and the lowering of water tables by draining swamps led {{to the establishment of}} dense conifer forests where mixed and open conifer-oak woodlands had previously grown. Fire <b>suppression</b> polices have been replaced by a fire management program which includes the annual use of prescribed fires.

5|$|In Herring v. United States, , Ginsburg dissented to the Court's {{decision}} not to suppress evidence due to a police officer's failure to update a computer system. In contrast to Justice Roberts' emphasis on <b>suppression</b> {{as a means to}} deter police misconduct, Ginsburg took a more robust view on the use of <b>suppression</b> as a remedy for a violation of a defendant's Fourth Amendment rights. Ginsburg viewed <b>suppression</b> as a way to prevent the government from profiting from mistakes, and therefore as a remedy to preserve judicial integrity and respect civil rights. She also rejected Roberts' assertion that <b>suppression</b> would not deter mistakes, contending making police pay a high price for mistakes would encourage them to take greater care.|$|E

5|$|Breastfeeding causes {{negative}} feedback to occur on pulse secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Depending {{on the strength}} of the {{negative feedback}}, breastfeeding women may experience complete <b>suppression</b> of follicular development, but no ovulation, or normal menstrual cycle may resume. <b>Suppression</b> of ovulation is more likely when suckling occurs more frequently. The production of prolactin in response to suckling is important to maintaining lactational amenorrhea. On average, women who are fully breastfeeding whose infants suckle frequently experience a return of menstruation at fourteen and a half months postpartum. There is a wide range of response among individual breastfeeding women, however, with some experiencing return of menstruation at two months and others remaining amenorrheic for up to 42 months postpartum.|$|E

We investigate the observable effects of the scatterigng off such <b>suppressions</b> in bulk samples by treating the order parameter "hole" as a pointlike off-diagonal scatterer treated within a self-consistent t-matrix approximation. Strong scattering potentials lead to a finite-energy spectral feature in the d-wave "impurity band", the observable effects of which include enhanced low-temperature microwave power absorption and a stronger sensitivity of the London penetration depth to disorder than found previously in simpler ``dirty'' d-wave models.

40|$|In reduced animal {{preparation}} (cat fictive locomotion) most of {{our knowledge}} on the phase-dependent modulation of cutaneous reflexes concerns early- (P 1 responses) rather than medium-latency (P 2) responses. In contrast, in humans, virtually only P 2 responses have been studied because P 1 responses are relatively rare in adults. In this work, human P 1 and P 2 responses following sural nerve stimulation were compared in BF (biceps femoris). Some 14 % of all subjects showed P 1 responses, which could be either suppressive or facilitatory. The suppressive responses were most common, and they occurred primarily at end swing. When a subject showed both suppressive P 1 and P 2 responses, the P 2 <b>suppressions</b> were stronger than the P 1 <b>suppressions</b> (as measured in the same phase at end swing). However, the P 2 <b>suppressions</b> were less consistent across subjects than the P 1 <b>suppressions.</b> In some subjects, there were also facilitatory P 1 responses, mostly throughout stance (when facilitatory P 2 responses occur as well). These facilitatory P 1 responses were consistent across experimental conditions in these subjects. Similar to the cat, the facilitatory P 1 responses were {{much smaller than the}} facilitatory P 2 responses. It is concluded that P 1 and P 2 reflexes can appear independently from each other, but that their modulation in the step cycle is mostly quite similar in some phases of the step cycle (end swing) ...|$|R

40|$|Habituation {{kinetics}} {{were found}} to vary considerably in different polysynaptic pathways of the brain stem in man. The exteroceptive reflex of the digastric muscle habituates markedly, even for stimuli repeated at 1 -min intervals. The second component of the blink reflex habituates for intervals below about 8 sec, but this can largely be prevented by steady voluntary contraction of the muscle. On the other hand the exteroceptive <b>suppressions</b> of the masseter muscle only disclose slight habituation of their late component ES 2 and no habituation of the early component ES 1. This {{does not appear to}} be affected by voluntary activation since the suppressive effects present the same pattern in relaxed masseter muscles tested by proprioceptive reflex activation. Exteroceptive reflexes and exteroceptive <b>suppressions</b> of similar latencies disclose genuine and important differences in their habituation kinetics. Â© 1976.

5|$|RNA {{interference}} (RNAi) is {{a biological}} {{process in which}} RNA molecules inhibit gene expression or translation, by neutralizing targeted mRNA molecules. Historically, it was known by other names, including co-suppression, post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS), and quelling. Only after these apparently unrelated processes were fully understood did it become clear that they all described the RNAi phenomenon. Andrew Fire and Craig C. Mello shared the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work on RNA interference in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, which they published in 1998. Since the discovery of RNAi and its regulatory potentials, it has become evident that RNAi has immense potential in <b>suppression</b> of desired genes. RNAi {{is now known as}} precise, efficient, stable and better than antisense technology for gene <b>suppression.</b>|$|E
