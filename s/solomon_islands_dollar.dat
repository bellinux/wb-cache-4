2500|$|The term [...] "dollar" [...] {{has also}} been adopted by other {{countries}} for currencies which do not share a common history with other dollars. Many of these currencies adopted the name after moving from a £sd-based to a decimalized monetary system. Examples include the Australian dollar, the New Zealand dollar, the Jamaican dollar, the Cayman Islands dollar, the Fiji dollar, the Namibian dollar, the Rhodesian dollar, the Zimbabwe dollar, and the <b>Solomon</b> <b>Islands</b> <b>dollar.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>Solomon</b> <b>Islands</b> <b>dollar</b> was {{introduced}} in 1977, replacing the Australian dollar at par, following independence. Until 1979, the two dollars remained equal, then for five months the SI$ was pegged at SI$1.05 = A$1, and later floated. Economic stagnation ensued, so over the next 28 years, and especially {{during the civil war}} of 2000-2003, inflationary pressure reduced the <b>Solomon</b> <b>Islands</b> <b>dollar</b> to be worth 15 Australian cents.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Solomon</b> <b>Islands</b> <b>dollar</b> did not descend {{directly}} from the Spanish pieces of eight, {{as is the case}} with the US, the Canadian, and East Caribbean dollars; several other currencies called [...] "dollars" [...] are also not direct descendants, e.g., the Australian and Jamaican currencies. The <b>Solomon</b> <b>Islands</b> <b>dollar</b> is an offshoot of the Australian dollar, which is in turn essentially a half pound sterling. Australia followed the pattern of South Africa in that when it adopted the decimal system, it decided to use the half pound as its unit.|$|E
50|$|In January 2013, Fanalei villagers on {{the island}} of Malaita in the <b>Solomon</b> <b>Islands</b> {{slaughtered}} close to 900 dolphins in retaliation for a payment dispute with Earth Island Institute. The dolphin slaughter occurred after villagers refused to renew a memorandum of understanding with Earth Island Institute that expired in April 2012. Villagers claim EII promised them $2.4 million <b>Solomon</b> <b>Island</b> <b>Dollars</b> (about $335,000 U.S.) to stop trading dolphins and dolphin-derived products for two years, but only received $700,000.|$|R

50|$|Between 1942 and 1944, the Solomon Islands were {{occupied}} by Japan and the Oceania pound circulated. The Australian pound returned {{after the war}} and was replaced by the Australian dollar in 1966. This was, in turn, replaced by the <b>Solomon</b> <b>Islands</b> <b>dollar</b> in 1977.

5000|$|On November 6, 2006, Taylan and his Pacific Wrecks crew sailed {{into the}} Solomon Islands to explore Guadalcanal Campaign {{battlefield}} sites. The team inadvertently stumbled onto a salvage operation underway at Ballale Island which housed a Japanese air base during the war. [...] When the group went {{to inform the}} Solomon Island Royal Police of what they believed to be an illegal salvage operation, their passports were confiscated and they were confined to their boat and charged with entering the country illegally. Taylan and his crew were under boat arrest for six weeks to await trial.

40|$|With continual {{changes made}} and {{reviews of the}} {{exchange}} rate regime of Solomon Islands {{it is imperative that}} a proper forecasting modelling tool is established. The use of neural network models in exchange rate forecasting has received much attention in recent research. In this paper we propose an artificial neural network (ANN) model for forecasting exchange rates of the <b>Solomon</b> <b>Islands</b> <b>dollar</b> (SBD) against Euro (EUR). We use daily exchange rate data during the period of January 5, 1998 to June 30, 2014. The proposed model is compared with a naive method as a benchmarked method. Further, it is compared with single exponential smoothing; double exponential smoothing with trend; and Holt-Winter multiplicative and additive seasonal and multiple linear regression models. The performance of the models was measured by using various error functions such as root mean square error, mean absolute error, and mean absolute percentage error. The validation tests of the models were also carried out using different goodness of fit measures such as R-square, bias and tracking signal. The empirical result reveals that the proposed model is an efficient tool for forecasting SBD against Euro more accurately than are regression and time series models...|$|E
