5|$|Another {{definition}} sees {{language as}} a formal system of signs governed by grammatical rules of combination to communicate meaning. This definition stresses that human languages {{can be described as}} closed structural systems consisting of rules that relate particular <b>signs</b> <b>to</b> particular meanings. This structuralist view of language was first introduced by Ferdinand de Saussure, and his structuralism remains foundational for many approaches to language.|$|E
5|$|The city of Minneapolis had {{connected}} 30 {{security cameras}} and 35 electronic street <b>signs</b> <b>to</b> the network {{by the end}} of 2010, with the intention to connect 50 network-enabled parking meters and 10 garbage trucks to the system in the near future. Fire and police conversion to the citywide network was also underway, though the city was taking necessary precautions to ensure that the two services, who will ultimately have their own dedicated frequency, continue to offer uninterrupted public safety service.|$|E
5|$|An {{automatic}} {{traffic monitoring}} and guidance {{system is in}} place along the motorway. It consists of measuring, control and signalling devices located in zones where driving conditions may vary, such as at interchanges, viaducts, bridges, tunnels and zones where fog and strong wind are known to occur. The system uses variable traffic <b>signs</b> <b>to</b> communicate changing driving conditions, possible restrictions and other information to motorway users. The A2 motorway mainly runs through the plains and rolling hills of Hrvatsko Zagorje region, although the northernmost sections of the route traverse rugged terrain, requiring a number of viaducts and long tunnels along the route.|$|E

The system uses variable traffic <b>signs</b> <b>to</b> communicate changing driving conditions, possible restrictions, and other information to motorway users. The A9 motorway mainly runs through the coastal plains and rolling hills of Istria, although {{the northern part of}} the route traverses two large valleys, requiring two large structures, the Mirna Bridge and the Limska Draga Viaduct, to carry the route across.|$|E
5|$|Depending on modality, {{language}} structure can {{be based}} on systems of sounds (speech), gestures (sign languages), or graphic or tactile symbols (writing). The ways in which languages use sounds or <b>signs</b> <b>to</b> construct meaning are studied in phonology. The study of how humans produce and perceive vocal sounds is called phonetics. In spoken language, meaning is produced when sounds {{become part of a}} system in which some sounds can contribute to expressing meaning and others do not. In any given language, {{only a limited number of}} the many distinct sounds that can be created by the human vocal apparatus contribute to constructing meaning.|$|E
5|$|Empire of the Sun {{was filmed}} at Elstree Studios in the United Kingdom, and on {{location}} in Shanghai and Spain. The filmmakers searched across Asia {{in an attempt to}} find locations that resembled 1941 Shanghai. They entered negotiations with Shanghai Film Studios and China Film Co-Production Corporation in 1985. After a year of negotiations, permission was granted for a three-week shoot in early March 1987. It was the first American film shot in Shanghai since the 1940s. The Chinese authorities allowed the crew to alter <b>signs</b> <b>to</b> traditional Chinese characters, as well as closing down city blocks for filming. Over 5,000 local extras were used, some old enough to remember the Japanese occupation of Shanghai 40 years earlier. Members of the People's Liberation Army played Japanese soldiers. Other locations included Trebujena in Andalusia, Knutsford in Cheshire and Sunningdale in Berkshire. Lean often visited the set during the England shoot.|$|E

5|$|In 1949 the Railway Executive {{decided on}} {{standard}} types of <b>signs</b> <b>to</b> {{be used at}} all stations. Lettering was to use the Gill Sans typeface on a background of the regional colour. Gill Sans was also used in much of its printed output, very often in capitals-only settings for signage. Specially drawn variations were developed by the Railway Executive (part of the British Transport Commission) for signs in its manual {{for the use of}} signpainters painting large signs by hand. Other users included Penguin Books' iconic paperback jacket designs from 1935 and British official mapping agency Ordnance Survey. It was also used by London Transport for documents which could not be practically set in Johnston. Paul Shaw, a historian of printing, has described it as a key element of the 'Modernist classical' style from the 1930s to the 1950s, that promoted clean, spare design, often with all-capitals and centred setting of headings.|$|E
5|$|The {{large number}} of {{tourists}} can have negative effects; wildlife may be disturbed, particularly species that breed in exposed areas, such as ringed plovers, and plants can be trampled, which is a particular problem in sensitive habitats such as sand dunes and vegetated shingle. Damage can be reduced by measures such as wardening the breeding colonies and using fences, boardwalks and <b>signs</b> <b>to</b> control access. The access paths to the hides, other than the northernmost, are largely boardwalked, and an extensive programme of fence replacement and improvements to the control of water levels on the reserve took place in 2010–2011.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days of World War II, some maps showed the western {{terminus}} of US 80 at the Cabrillo National Monument on Point Loma, running north on Catalina Boulevard, north then east on Cañon Street, northeast on Rosecrans Street, southeast on Lytton Street, east on Barnett Avenue, south on Pacific Highway (US 101) and finally east on Market Street, before continuing north along Park Boulevard to El Cajon Boulevard. US 395 ran concurrently along the route from downtown San Diego to the intersection with Fairmount Avenue. By 1942, the US 395 concurrency had been removed. With the completion of the Cabrillo Freeway, between 1946 and 1948, US 80 shifted from Park Boulevard to 11th Avenue north onto the new freeway before continuing east onto El Cajon Boulevard towards La Mesa. The final San Diego alignment, with <b>signs</b> <b>to</b> be placed in 1954, moved the western terminus to the intersection with US 101 where it traveled east on what was known as Camino del Rio and Alvarado Canyon Road, and then continuing on the Mission Valley road towards La Mesa. According to Caltrans district engineer Jacob Dekema, during the 1950s, the parts of Camino Del Rio and Rosecrans Street from Lytton Street and Rosecrans Street to Pacific Highway were considered a part of US 80.|$|E
