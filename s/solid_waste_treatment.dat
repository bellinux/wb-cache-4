During the composting assays physical, physico-chemical, chemical and microbiological parameters were followed. The enzymatic activities of phosphatases, proteases, lipases (C 10), N-acetyl-#beta#-glucosaminidase, #beta#-glucosidase, total cellulases and polyphenol oxidases were also determined. The phyto toxicity was evaluated through the germination index. Results showed that enzymatic activities {{are related to the}} physico-chemical and chemical changes through the whole process and the microbiological populations. Along the composting process the organic nitrogen was mineralized. Nitrogen content decreased mostly through ammonia volatilization which was more significant during the thermophilic phase and at high values of ph. Nitrogen losses can be recovered through asymbiotic nitrogen fixation, for which the activity of cellulolytic microorganisms and enzymatic activities of cellulases seems to be very importantAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.

The Department of Tourism of the Government of India invited Rudy Matt, in 1960 to select a suitable location for such purpose. Matt zeroed in on Gulmarg as suitable location for development of a Winter sports destination in India. In 1968, Institute of Skiing and Mountaineering was established in Gulmarg to train ski instructors. Over the next decade Indian planners invested [...] to transform Gulmarg into a world class ski destination. Gulmarg became a centre for skiers from Asian nations. In mid-1980s, Heli-skiing was introduced in Gulmarg {{in collaboration with the}} Swiss skier Sylvain Saudan of Himalaya Heli-Ski Club of France.In the 1990s, the rise of militancy in Jammu and Kashmir affected tourism in Gulmarg. With the abatement of terrorism in the area, tourism started to recover in late 1990s. Work on the cable car project between Gulmarg and Apharwat Peak, which was commissioned in 1988 by Government of Jammu and Kashmir but was subsequently abandoned due to militancy in 1990, was resumed in 1998. In May 1998, Phase 1 of the project, between Gulmarg and Kongdori, began its commercial operation. In May 2005, Phase 2 of the project was also inaugurated {{making it one of the}} longest and highest rope ways of Asia. The chairlift installed as a part of Phase 3 of the project began its operations in 2011. India’s National Winter Games were held in Gulmarg in 1998, 2004 and 2008.

This study aim to evaluate the potential amount of GHG mitigation from current domestic <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> <b>treatment</b> technologies in Vietnam including landfills and composting from various management scenarios. In oder to use Tier 2 model of IPCC 2006 for GHG estimation from landfills, an analysis on current household solid waste management system of the city was obtained by using material flow analysis approach. A case study in Hanoi, the capital city of Vietnam was carried out in this research. As a result, there was a reduced of over 70 % of the amount of CH 4 emissions and  up to 53 % of total GHG saving (CO 2 -eq) from avoiding organic waste to landfill. In addition, applying an energy recovery from LFG system to available landfills would lead to aproximately 75 % of GHG saved compare to current emission of waste sector.

The {{experiment was}} arranged as split plots based on a randomized complete block design with two factors and three replications. Main plot included five levels of nitrogen fertilizer (100, 150, 200, 250 and 300 kg N. ha- 1) and sub plots included four levels of municipal <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> compost (10, 20, 30 and 40 t. ha- 1). The Results showed that the highest fresh ear and grain yield resulted from application of 200 kg N. ha- 1 and 40 t. ha- 1 compost. The grain quality analysis showed that nitrogen had significant effect on grain nitrogen percent and had not significant effect on grain phosphorus and nitrogen content. Also, compost had significant effect on grain nitrogen and phosphorus percent but had no significant effect on grain potassium percent. Soil analysis results showed that effect of compost on organic matter, EC and pH and interactions between nitrogen and compost were significant only on soil nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus percent. Nitrogen had no significant effect only on soil nitrogen percent. Also, {{the results showed that}} optimum amount of grain nitrogen and phosphorus percent were gained by using 40 t. ha- 1 municipal <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> compost and optimum amount of grain potassium percent was achieved by using 30 t. ha- 1 municipal <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> compost.
