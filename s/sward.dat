25|$|In {{the midst}} of the riot the House was {{discovered}} to be on fire. The flames spread rapidly, and of the stately pile there soon remained no more than the gaunt and blackened walls. Before it was too late the booty had been dragged out upon the <b>sward,</b> and the country people flocked in crowds to buy the cheese, the bacon, and the wheat which had been stored within. Prizes of greater value were reserved for more appreciative chapmen.|$|E
25|$|The {{remnants}} of a moat or ditch are discernible and {{the summit of the}} mote has a D-shaped concavity that is defended on the landward sides by a substantial and steep curved earth bank. 10m is the approximate internal width and the substantial earth bank is up to 9m thick and has a height above the interior floor of 1.8m. The exterior height from ground level is around 5m. Beech tree plantings, natural scrub and a typical woodland <b>sward</b> covers the ring-work that was once ringed with a wood palisade rather than a stone wall.|$|E
25|$|The {{land was}} left emptied of its cattle and its people, {{enabling}} the colonial powers Germany and Britain {{to take over}} Tanzania and Kenya with little effort. With greatly reduced grazing, grassland turned rapidly to bush. The closely cropped grass <b>sward</b> was replaced {{in a few years}} by woody grassland and thornbush, ideal habitat for tsetse flies. Wild mammal populations increased rapidly, accompanied by the tsetse fly. Highland regions of east Africa which had been free of tsetse fly were colonised by the pest, accompanied by sleeping sickness, until then unknown in the area. Millions of people died of the disease in the early 20th century.|$|E

She switched careers again {{to work with the}} National Environmental Education and Training Foundation as senior director for education and environment and then in 2004 became Deputy Executive Director of the Audubon Naturalist Society of the Central Atlantic States. She led their Environmental Education department until her death in 2008. During her time there she worked to get the ANS Nature Preschool started, began the GreenKids program (an outreach program that sends naturalists to Montgomery County, Maryland schools), and helped start the Loudoun Environmental Stewardship Alliance.

500|$|To {{the north}} of the river bank {{northwest}} of Langport are the Aller and Beer Woods and Aller Hill biological Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). Aller and Beer Woods is a Somerset Wildlife Trust reserve. It consists of large blocks of semi-natural ancient woodland along the west-facing slope of Aller Hill, overlooking King's Sedgemoor. The reserve is about [...] and the underlying geology of most of it is Lias limestone. Prior to the 20thcentury it appears to have been managed for centuries as traditional coppice woodland, and it provides an outstanding example of ancient escarpment woodland. The woodland is a variant of the calcareous ash/wych elm stand-type, with pedunculate oak (Quercus robur), and ash (Fraxinus excelsior) the dominant canopy trees throughout, and with scattered concentrations of wych elm (Ulmus glabra). Ancient woodland indicators include small-leaved lime (Tilia cordata), and wild service tree (Sorbus torminalis), both of which are locally common. Plants of particular interest include bird's nest orchid (Neottia nidus-avis), greater butterfly orchid (Platanthera chlorantha) and the very rare Red Data Book species purple gromwell (Lithospermum purpurocaeruleum). Aller Hill contains three species of plant which are nationally rare and a further three which are of restricted distribution in Somerset. The central area contains a <b>sward</b> dominated by sheep's fescue (Festuca ovina) in combination with yellow oat-grass (Trisetum flavescens) and quaking-grass (Briza media). Salad burnet (Sanguisorba minor) forms a major component of the <b>sward</b> with the two nationally rare species rough marsh-mallow (Althaea hirsuta) and nit-grass (Gastridium ventricosum), also present.|$|E

60|$|Three {{minutes later}} they were {{breasting}} through a low thicket of evergreen. High overhead the tall trees made a continuous roof of foliage.

2500|$|<b>Sward</b> then {{switched}} in mid-career from academic to {{nonprofit organization}} executive. She stated {{in an interview}} with Association Management magazine that one reason was a low threshold of boredom, but also emphasized the need to stretch one's skills. She said, [...] "As a professor I really didn't manage anything. The focus was on the intellectual work. So when I switched to association management, I {{had to learn how to}} manage programs, delegate, work with committees, raise money, work with budgets." ...|$|E
2500|$|Oh, praised be {{the beauty}} of this earth; the beauty, and the bloom, and the mirthfulness thereof! The first worlds made were winter worlds; the second made, were vernal worlds; the third, and last, and perfectest, was this summer world of ours. In the cold and nether spheres preachers preach of earth, as we of Paradise above. Oh, there, my friends, they say, they have a season, in their {{language}} known as summer. Then their fields spin themselves green carpets; snow and ice are not in all the land; then a million strange, bright, fragrant things powder that <b>sward</b> with perfumes; and high majestic beings, dumb and grand, stand up with outstretched arms, and hold their green canopies over merry angels--men and women--who love and wed, and sleep and dream, beneath the approving glances of their visible god and goddess, glad-hearted sun, and pensive moon! ...|$|E

60|$|At {{another time}} we find him {{working for a}} part of two days with Peter, his smith, to make a plough on a new {{invention}} of his own. This, {{after two or three}} failures, he accomplished.

She won the competition, winning P4 million worth of cash and prizes. Her chosen charity, women's rights advocate [...] "Gabriella" [...] (the sister party of Bayan Muna), received P1 million. She did one movie, Binibining K with Troy Montero in 2006.|$|R
2500|$|The reserve {{has been}} {{declared}} a Ramsar site and a Special Protection Area (SPA). In summer the salt marsh supports large numbers of breeding birds including black-headed gull, European herring gull, lesser black-backed gull, common tern and common redshank. Skylark, meadow pipit and linnet nest in significant numbers on the grazing marsh. [...] Management of the site involves grazing the salt marsh with cattle to maintain the short <b>sward</b> on which wintering wildfowl (especially Eurasian wigeon and the pink-footed goose) depend. The main area of salt marsh is grazed by approximately 800 cattle from May to October, forming {{one of the largest}} single herds of cattle in the UK. Wildfowling takes place on much of the reserve and improved management has contributed to {{the increase in the number}} of birds visiting the site. A group of volunteers led by the local Wildfowlers Association carries out much of the valuable maintenance work on the reserve.|$|E

60|$|The valley {{looked even}} lovelier by morning; {{and soon the}} road descended {{to the level of}} the river. Here, in a place where many {{straight}} and prosperous chestnuts stood together, making an aisle upon a <b>swarded</b> terrace, I made my morning toilette in the water of the Tarn. It was marvellously clear, thrillingly cool; the soap-suds disappeared as if by magic in the swift current, and the white boulders gave one a model for cleanliness. To wash in one of God's rivers in the open air seems to me a sort of cheerful solemnity or semi-pagan act of worship. To dabble among dishes in a bedroom may perhaps make clean the body; but the imagination takes no share in such a cleansing. I went on with a light and peaceful heart, and sang psalms to the spiritual ear as I advanced.|$|R
6000|$|... 38. First, for Helvetia. Well do I {{remember}} the thrilling and exquisite moment when first, first {{in my life}} (which had not been over long), I encountered, in a calm and shadowy dingle, darkened with the thick spreading of tall pines, and voiceful with the singing of a rock-encumbered stream, and passing up towards the flank of a smooth green mountain, whose <b>swarded</b> summit shone in the summer snow like an emerald set in silver; when, I say, I first encountered in this calm defile of the Jura, the unobtrusive, yet beautiful, front of the Swiss cottage. I thought it the loveliest piece of architecture I had ever had the felicity of contemplating; yet it was nothing in itself, nothing but a few mossy fir trunks, loosely nailed together, {{with one or two}} gray stones on the roof: but its power was the power of association; its beauty, that of fitness and humility.|$|R
