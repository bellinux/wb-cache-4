5|$|The {{group were}} <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> see how small and {{technically}} basic the studio was, {{with only one}} microphone in {{the centre of the}} room. Phillips demanded that they pay for the recording before they set up the equipment, so each member paid 3 shillings and 6 pence, but he then asked for an extra surcharge (£1) {{to cover the cost of}} transferring the tape recording to acetate disc. As this was too expensive, Phillips said that for a cut-rate price they would not be taped first, but record directly to vinyl.|$|E
50|$|True {{boarding}} assaults in the 19th, 20th, {{and early}} 21st centuries became extremely rare, generally by small boats or by divers, {{who entered the}} target vessel surreptitiously and exploited total <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> seize control before resistance could be effectively organized. Modern-day pirates in motorboats similarly depend on speed, stealth and <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> take their targets, usually unarmed and poorly defended, without serious resistance.|$|R

5|$|According to phylogenetic {{analyses}} {{based on}} the sequences of both the S and M segments, OROV is most {{closely related to the}} clade formed by BAYV, CATV, BCCV, and Muleshoe virus (MUL; from the hispid cotton rat). In 2009, Piet Maes and colleagues proposed that the closely related BAYV, BCCV, and MUL be united into a single species. Chu and colleagues were <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> find that the same species, Oryzomys couesi, harbored different viruses (OROV and CATV), though noted that the subspecies infected by the two viruses were different. In 2010, Delton Hanson and colleagues suggested on the basis of various lines of evidence, including the presence of different hantaviruses, that western Mexican populations of Oryzomys couesi represent a different species, Oryzomys mexicanus.|$|E
