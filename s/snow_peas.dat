40|$|The {{metabolism}} of glyoxylate {{released as}} a result of ureide catabolism in the developing fruits of legumes was examined through an investigation of alanine-, glutamate- and serine-glyoxylate aminotransferase activity in these tissues. A study of the distribution of these activities among the tissues of the developing fruits of two ureide-transporting legumes, French bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) and an amide-transporter, <b>snow</b> <b>pea</b> (Pisum sativum), was conducted. Serine-glyoxylate aminotransferase activity in each species was very low relative to the alanine- and glutamate-glyoxylate aminotransferase activity. In all three species most of the aminotransferase activity was in the pods. In cowpea, alanine- and glutamate-glyoxylate aminotransferase activity was high in the embryos relative to the seed coats, whereas in French bean and <b>snow</b> <b>pea</b> the seed coats had higher activity than the embryos. Three glyoxylate aminotransferases were isolated and partially purified from extracts of French bean and <b>snow</b> <b>pea</b> developing fruits. These were a serine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (SGAT), which primarily catalyzes the serine glyoxylate aminotransferase reaction; a glutamate-glyoxylate aminotransferase (GGAT), which catalyzes both the glutamate- and alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase reactions; and an alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGAT), which catalyzes the alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase reaction. Sucrose-density gradient ultracentrifugation indicated that the SGAT and GGAT from French bean fruits are located in the peroxisomes, and that the AGAT is located outside the peroxisomes, probably in the mitochondria or chloroplasts. These results confirm the existence of an alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGAT) as an enzyme distinct from the GGAT. The results of initial velocity kinetic studies of the enzymes isolated from French bean and <b>snow</b> <b>pea,</b> conducted at pH 7. 1, were consistent with a Ping Pong reaction mechanism involving pyridoxal phosphate as a co-enzyme. The Km values obtained for the substrates of the enzymes were in all cases higher for the amino acid than for glyoxylate. For the French bean enzymes the Km for the amino acids was about ten-fold higher than that for glyxoylate. The affinity of the <b>snow</b> <b>pea</b> enzymes for glyoxylate was less than that of the French bean enzymes. Alanine--ketoglutarate aminotransferase activity was associated with the GGAT and this activity was reversible, in contrast to the alanine- and glutamate-glyoxylate aminotransferase activity of this enzyme. The reversible aspartate--ketoglutarate aminotransferase activity of the French bean developing fruits was not catalyzed by the glyoxylate aminotransferases. The pH optimum of the GGAT and the SGAT from French bean was approximately 8. 3. The molecular weight of the GGAT and AGAT from French bean estimated by gel filtration was 104 kDa. 	The results are discussed {{in the context of the}} metabolic pathway of ureide catabolism, and its location within the fruits of different ureide transporting legumes...|$|R
40|$|Thirty-three edible-pod pea (Pisum sativum L.) lines {{selected}} from single plants within 11 <b>snow</b> <b>pea</b> landraces and three elite cultivars were evaluated for their horticultural value in three field trials at Pontevedra and Lugo (Northwestern Spain). Field performance was estimated according to six traits related to earliness and duration, while horticultural value {{was determined by}} five pod traits. The global pod quality was estimated by a taste panel. Lines showed significant differences in nine quantitative traits. Significant differences were found among means of five landraces and the lines selected within them for pod length, width and weight. Cluster and principal component analysis identified a main group of 16 lines derived mainly from landraces PSM- 0112 and PSM- 0227 that had desirable earliness and pod quality.

40|$|The {{effect of}} fungal {{infection}} by Metarhizium anisopliae on feeding and oviposition of adult Liriomyza huidobrensis was examined on three host plants, faba bean (Vicia faba), French bean (Phaseolus vuklgaris) and <b>snow</b> <b>pea</b> (Pisum sativum) in the laboratory. Flies were contaminated with dry conidia {{and allowed to}} feed and oviposit on the different host plants. Mortality in L. huidobrensis varied between 14 % and 20 % in the controls and between 77 % and 100 % in fungal treatments 120 h post-infection for the three host plants. L. huidobrensis made more punctures (47. 3 – 52. 6 cm- 2) in the control than in the fungal treatments (23. 1 – 26. 9 cm- 2) for the three host plants. The cumulative average number of punctures cm- 2 /female by L. huidobrensis was higher in the controls than in fungal treatments from 72 h post-treatment in faba bean (12. 2 vs. 8. 2) and French bean (14. 8 vs. 8. 9), and from 48 h post-inoculation in <b>snow</b> <b>pea</b> (8. 5 vs. 5. 7). Female L. huidobrensis laid more eggs in the control (0. 6 – 6. 1) than in fungal treatments (0. 2 – 1. 5) across the host plants tested. The cumulative mean number of eggs cm- 2 /female was significantly higher in the controls than in fungal treatments from 48 h post-treatment in faba bean (0. 4 vs. 0. 2) and French bean (0. 1 vs. 0), and 96 h post-inoculation in <b>snow</b> <b>pea</b> (0. 2 vs. 0. 1). The host plant {{did not affect the}} average total number of punctures but had a significant effect on egg laying, with faba bean harboring greater number of eggs in both control and fungal treatments. A proper timeline application of the fungus before onset of feeding and oviposition peaks will be crucial in field suppression of the pest using M. anisopliae. In addition, a great consideration must be given to the target host plants prior to application of the fungus. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|Background: Trigonelline {{occurs in}} many dietary food plants {{and has been}} found to have anti-carcinogenic activity. Trigonelline is also found in coffee {{which is one of the}} most widely {{consumed}} beverages. Many epidemiological studies have reported that coffee consumption has an inverse relationship with the risk of cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. It would be interesting to investigate whether trigonelline is an ideal chemoprevent agent to prevent cancer progression. Methods: The protein expression was performed by western blotting. The trigonelline content in <b>snow</b> <b>pea</b> (Pisum sativum) was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The migratory activity of human hepatocarcinoma cells (Hep 3 B) was assessed by using a wound migration assay. The percentage of each phase in the cell cycle was analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer. Gene expression was detected by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction techniques. Native gel analysis was performed to analyze the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase and glutathione peroxidase. Results: According to the data of HPLC analysis, P. sativum, which is a popular vegetable, has relatively high content of trigonelline. Our findings suggest that trigonelline is an efficient compound for inhibiting Hep 3 B cell migration. Trigonelline inhibited the migration of hepatoma cells at concentrations of 75 – 100 µM without affecting proliferation. Raf/ERK/Nrf 2 protein levels and further downstream antioxidative enzymes activity, such as SOD, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase, significantly decreased after treatment with 100 µM of trigonelline for 24 h. The migration inhibition of trigonelline is also related to its ability to regulate the matrix metalloproteinases 7 (MMP- 7) gene expression. Conclusions: In this study, protein kinase Cα (PKCα) and Raf/ERK/Nrf 2 signaling pathway and MMP- 7 gene expression were involved in the trigonelline-mediated migration inhibition of Hep 3 B cells. We also demonstrated that trigonelline inhibits Hep 3 B cell migration through downregulation of nuclear factor E 2 -related factor 2 –dependent antioxidant enzymes activity. This study analyzed the trigonelline content in a popular vegetable, <b>snow</b> <b>pea,</b> as a representative proof to prove that trigonelline is often found in the daily intake of food. Our finding suggested that trigonelline should be a useful chemopreventive agent derived from the daily intake of food to prevent cancer progression...|$|R

40|$|Phenolic acids {{are thought}} to be {{beneficial}} for human health and responsible for vegetables’ health-promoting properties. Free, conjugated, and bound phenolic acids of seven commonly consumed vegetables, including kidney bean, cow <b>pea,</b> <b>snow</b> <b>pea,</b> hyacinth bean, green soy bean, soybean sprouts and daylily, from the regions of Beijing, Hangzhou, and Guangzhou, were identified and quantified by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Three vegetables, namely green soy bean, soybean sprouts, and daylily (Hemerocallis fulva L.), from the Beijing region contained higher concentrations of total phenolic acids than those from the Hangzhou and Guangzhou regions. The results indicated that the phenolic acid content in the seven vegetables appeared to be species-dependent. The highest content of phenolic acids was found in daylily, followed by green soy bean, while the least amounts were identified in kidney bean and hyacinth bean. Typically, phenolic acids are predominantly found in conjugated forms. Principle component analysis (PCA) revealed some key compounds that differentiated the seven vegetables. Green soy bean, compared to the other six vegetables, was characterized by higher levels of syringic acid, ferulic acid, vanillic acid, and sinapic acid. Other compounds, particularly p-coumaric acid, neochlorogenic acid, and caffeic acid, exhibited significantly higher concentrations in daylily. In addition, p-coumaric acid was the characteristic substance in cow pea.

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} novel method for {{deriving}} a structural {{model of a}} plant root system from 3 D Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data of soil grown plants and use it for plant root system analysis. The structural model allows calculation of physiologically relevant parameters. Roughly speaking, MRI images show local water content of the investigated sample. The small, local amounts of water in roots require a relatively high resolution, which results in low SNR images. However, the spatial resolution of the MRI images remains coarse relative to the diameter of typical fine roots, causing many gaps in the visible root system. To reconstruct the root structure, we propose a three step approach: 1) detect tubular structures, 2) connect all pixels {{to the base of}} the root using Dijkstras algorithm, and 3) prune the tree using two signal strength related thresholds. Dijkstras algorithm determines the shortest path of each voxel {{to the base of the}} plant root, weighing the Euclidean distance measure by a multi-scale vesselness measure. As a result, paths running within good root candidates are preferred over paths in bare soil. We test this method using both virtually generated MRI images of Maize and real MRI images of Barley roots. In experiments on synthetic data, we show limitations of our algorithm with regard to resolution and noise levels. In addition we show how to use our reconstruction for root phenotyping on real MRI data of barley roots and <b>snow</b> <b>pea</b> in soil. Extending our conference publication (schulz 123 d), we show how to use the structural model to remove unwanted structures, like underground weeds...|$|R
