40|$|This was {{a tricky}} shot, I was {{snorkeling}} when I <b>spotted</b> this <b>blenny</b> under a xmas tree worm. It took me forever {{to get this}} shot, i had to approach very slowly because whenever the goby darted in, it triggered the xmas worm to retract. After over an hour of failed attempts I managed to hold my breath long enough to approach slowly and snap this shot, 2 seconds later both blenny and worm had retracted. [URL]...|$|R
5000|$|The Worthing Lumps are a {{range of}} {{underwater}} chalk cliffs about 5 mi off the Worthing coast. [...] They face north, rise as high as 10 ft and have areas of small rocks and sand at their base. [...] They have been designated a Marine Site of Nature Conservation Interest (SNCI), and are an important breeding and visiting ground for sea creatures such as lesser <b>spotted</b> dogfish, tompot <b>blenny,</b> gobies, triggerfish and piddocks, and for birds such as the red-breasted merganser. [...] There are few undersea chalk cliffs in the waters around Britain: Sussex has several, and the Lumps {{have been described as}} the best example.|$|R
40|$|Fish species inhabiting the Barents Sea display great {{seasonal}} and between-year {{variation in}} abundance and distribution. This study describes the assemblages and distributions of fish {{species in the}} south-western part of the Barents Sea which includes the Polar front. The area has an unpredictable environment due to variable inflow of Atlantic water and assemblages and distributions of fish species differ between Arctic and Atlantic water masses. These assemblages can be identified as distinct groups corresponding to the different environments. In the period 1997 – 1999, 57 fish species and shrimp were identified and 32 species/species groups {{were used in the}} statistical analyses. Cluster and Correspondence analyses (CA) showed that the fish community consists of four different assemblages: A Northern, a Southern, a Deep and a Central group. In the Northern assemblage, species composition and spatial distribution varied least. The Central assemblage was the most variable. The Northern group included Polar cod, Atlantic poacher, <b>spotted</b> snake <b>blenny</b> and two species from the sculpin family. The Southern group included haddock and Norway pout. The Deep group included northern wolffish and long rough dab. Temperature explained 22 % of the variation in the species data, and depth 12 % of the variation. The assemblages are coherent with previous zoogeographic studies from the Barents Sea...|$|R
