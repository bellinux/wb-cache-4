2500|$|Every {{morning before}} {{beginning}} work, I visited the animals. One of the elephants, Candy, loved to be scratched on the belly behind her foreleg. I'd scratch {{her and she}} would lean farther and farther toward me until there was some danger of her toppling over on me. One time I started {{to walk away from}} her, and <b>she</b> <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> took my wrist with her trunk and pulled me back to her side. It was a command: [...] "Don't stop!" [...] I used it in the picture. Noah scratches the elephant's belly and walks away, and the elephant pulls him back to her time after time.|$|E

50|$|As {{the police}} take Tallulah away, Margo {{promises}} {{to help her}} however she can. When the detective asks if Lu has a habit of taking toddlers into protective custody, Lu says nothing and smiles ruefully. Some time later, Margo wanders through the park before lying in the grass, recalling her conversation with Tallulah about letting go. She starts floating away happily, but when she sees Tallulah and Nico below her, <b>she</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> grabs a tree branch to hold on.|$|R
2500|$|The video {{features}} Yamaguchi in {{the role}} of a black shawled ferryman, transporting a woman played by Ayami Nakajō across a darkened lake. As they progress across the lake, there are flashbacks to a [...] "painful story" [...] between her and a man, played by Akira Kameyama. Later in the video, the woman is shown embracing the man as he lies collapsed on a skating rink. He appears on the boat, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> touches him, but he is no longer there. She sees him standing {{on the edge of the}} lake, and smiles at him.|$|R

The woman sits on the well's edge at left, a length of linen draped over her leg. <b>She</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> caresses the face of the young male child to the right, who clasps her wrist. A satin-like material is lain below him, also {{on the edge of the}} well. By the woman's feet, an object that appears to be either a spinning or roulette wheel can be seen. In the distance, sparse trees and mountains can be seen...|$|R

6000|$|Then Lynette {{entered the}} {{pavilion}} very softly and <b>she</b> <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> touched Axatalese upon {{the shoulder and}} therewith he immediately awoke.

[...] And Axatalese did so.|$|E

60|$|However, {{there was}} {{physical}} suffering. It came and went, and at such moments {{she saw the}} traces {{of it in the}} tightening of his lips, and longed with womanly intuition to alleviate it. She had not spoken--although she could have cried aloud; she knew not what to say. And then suddenly <b>she</b> <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> touched his hand. Nor could she have accounted for the action.|$|E

60|$|Perplexed and troubled, {{she climbed}} the stairs again. No sound came from the Judge's room Perhaps Clarence would be back at any moment. Perhaps her father was in danger. She sat down to think,--her elbows on the desk in front of her, her chin in her hand, her eyes {{at the level of}} a line of books which stood on end.--Chitty's Pleadings, Blackstone, Greenleaf on Evidence. Absently; as a person whose mind is in trouble, <b>she</b> <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> took one of them down and opened it.

6000|$|... (Margaret {{looks at}} {{documents}} lying on open cover of dispatch box and glancing quickly about room, takes a sudden resolution. She seizes documents, makes {{as if to}} run wildly from the room, stops abruptly to reconsider, and changes her mind. She looks about room for a hiding place, and her eyes rest on portrait of Lincoln. Moving swiftly, picking up a light chair on the way, she goes to corner of bookcase nearest to portrait, steps on chair, and from chair to ledge of bookcase where, clinging, <b>she</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> up and drops documents behind portrait.

60|$|The tragic {{beauty of}} her, the {{certainty}} of some monstrous crime to youth and innocence, {{the presence of an}} agony and terror that unfathomably seemed not to be for herself--these transfixed the court and the audience, and held them silenced, till <b>she</b> <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> blindly <b>and</b> then sank in a heap to the floor.|$|R
6000|$|... "Grandfather Quack {{told her}} the whole story and how Old Mother Nature did laugh when he {{described}} how frightened {{he was when he}} fell in that time. Suddenly <b>she</b> <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> caught him by the bill. 'I don't think much of that bill for poking about in the mud,' said she. 'How will this do?' She let go, and Grandfather Quack found he had a broad bill just suited for getting food out of the mud. Then Old Mother Nature bade him hold forth first one foot and then the other. Between the toes she stretched a tough skin clear to the toe nails. 'Now let me see you swim,' said she.|$|E
60|$|She {{had been}} looking at him, puzzled. Years of {{association}} with Uncle Chris had enabled her to read his moods quickly, and she was sure {{that there was something}} on his mind. It was not likely that the others had noticed it, for his manner was as genial and urbane as ever. But something about him, a look in his eyes that came and went, an occasional quick twitching of his mouth, told her that all was not well. She was a little troubled, but not greatly. Uncle Chris was not the sort of man to whom grave tragedies happened. It was probably some mere trifle which she could smooth out for him in five minutes, once they were alone together. <b>She</b> <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> patted his sleeve affectionately. She was fonder of Uncle Chris than of anyone in the world except Derek.|$|E

5000|$|The men {{then return}} to take the children's mother, the baby, and June Star to the woods for the same purpose as Bailey and the boy. The {{grandmother}} begins pleading for her own life. When The Misfit talks to her about Jesus, he expresses his doubts about His raising Lazarus from the dead. As he speaks, The Misfit becomes agitated and angry. He snarls into the grandmother's face and claims that life has [...] "no pleasure but meanness". In her growing confusion, she thinks that The Misfit is going to cry, so <b>she</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> touches his shoulder tenderly, saying [...] "Why you're one of my babies.

5000|$|As Emily tried {{desperately to}} get Hunter to stay in Oakdale he was {{extremely}} resistant thinking she only wanted him to stay {{so that he could}} help her at The Intruder, but she told him that {{it had nothing to do}} with that and that she's his mother. Confused at her revelation Hunter takes it hard thinking that she's messing with him to get him to stay, but she explains to him how even though Aurora raised him she wasn't his biological mother, because he's her biological son in the same way that Alison is her biological daughter. Still not understanding what she was telling him Emily told him how her fertilized eggs were stolen and transferred to the University of Chicago where his mother worked, and she was then implanted with one of the eggs; however, Hunter still chose not to believe what she was saying to him. As she tried to get Hunter to understand Emily suggested that maybe because of her age Aurora couldn’t get pregnant in the traditional way and knew that Larry could help her but he's confused as to how his mother knew Larry, until Emily told him that Larry admitted being his mother's lover and that his money clip was engraved [...] "To Tristan From Isolde" [...] and he told her of how his mother once called him Tristan after her stroke and she promised to keep his secret forever. Struggling to accept the news Hunter asked Emily for proof and she gave him the DNA results which confirmed that she's his mother and she tells him that he was a little wrong thinking he had no family in town, because he has her along with his grandmother Susan, his half-brother Daniel. He then asked her about Alison and said that if Daniel's his half-brother then she must be his half-sister, but Emily explained that she's his sister as they have the same biological parents, which made him feel sick and he quickly left the room leaving a confused Emily behind. Later, Alison finds Hunter at Java but when <b>she</b> <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> touched his shoulder he quickly pulled away telling her never to touch him. He then had to explain to her that nothing could never happen between them because, every time that he's with her the thoughts he has are those that one should never have about their sister, and he was confused to find that she didn’t know what he was talking about. Hunter then explained to Alison how they have the same biological parents, and they then discovered why they had some special connection, but he felt that he had to leave as the feelings he had for her were too toxic and strong, but she was willing to see where their new sibling relationship lead and that she understood what he was going through as she went through he same thing when she learned that Emily was her biological mother and that it didn’t change how she felt because, Susan was her true mother as she raised her in the same way that Aurora raised him, but was unable to accept it Hunter chose to leave town. Afterwards, Alison went to see Emily and told her how Hunter thought he was in love with her, much to Emily's horror and she gets even more hurt when Alison tells her how Hunter left, because she wanted a new child and now she learned that she already had one.|$|E
40|$|We make how {{a person}} acts intelligible by {{revealing}} it as rational {{in the light of}} what she perceives, thinks, wants and so on. For example, we might explain that <b>she</b> <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> picked up a glass because she was thirsty and saw that it contained water. In doing this, we are giving a causal explanation of her behaviour in terms of her antecedent beliefs, desire...|$|E
60|$|In {{an instant}} <b>she</b> <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> her hand <b>and</b> tossed the turtle into the boiling water; and then, with {{a cry of}} horror at her own action, she drew back {{to see what would}} happen.|$|R
6000|$|She assumed {{again the}} willowy, a position, her fingers clasped across her knee, her eyes supplicatingly raised to Janet.

60|$|Suddenly, {{out of the}} mist, {{she heard}} voices. The waiter was {{standing}} beside him with the bill. <b>She</b> <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> her hand <b>and</b> took it. The usual few mistakes had occurred. She explained them, good temperedly, and the waiter, with profuse apologies, went back to have it corrected.|$|R
60|$|The crowd {{gave way}} to them, and they had all but reached him. He was hatless and bespattered, but his tender eyes had neither fear nor anger in them. <b>She</b> <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> her arms <b>and</b> called to him.

60|$|Half turning, the {{old woman}} {{looked up at the}} {{standing}} man, her worn face lighting with a proud <b>and</b> wonderful smile. <b>She</b> <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> one veined <b>and</b> calloused hand and took one of her son's. Then smiling cheerily down at the prostrate man, she continued to dip the handkerchief, in the waiting-room tin washbasin and gently apply it to his temple. She had the benevolent garrulity of old age.|$|R

60|$|They {{came upon}} a sort of stage, which {{accommodated}} three rows of men; and she caught her {{first glimpse of the}} squared ring. She was on a level with it, and so near that <b>she</b> could have <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> touched its ropes. She noticed that it was covered with padded canvas. Beyond the ring, and on either side, as in a fog, she could see the crowded house.|$|R
60|$|She {{shook her}} head. 'When {{the moon is}} full, when the moon is full,' she muttered. Then she peered all round, and listened. A blue bird rose {{screaming}} from its nest and circled over the dunes, and three spotted birds rustled through the coarse grey grass and whistled to each other. There was no other sound save {{the sound of a}} wave fretting the smooth pebbles below. So <b>she</b> <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> her hand, <b>and</b> drew him near to her and put her dry lips close to his ear.|$|R
5000|$|Marmee Noir may be {{thousands}} of miles physically from Anita, but <b>she</b> can still <b>reach</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> touch the necromancer. When Anita loses consciousness, Marmee Noir wakes her and slashes her shirt open despite being so far away. However, she does not reveal why she is so interested in Anita. It could be that she wants Anita for her own human servant, as other Masters of the City may as well. When the link between Anita and Jean-Claude is broken, they believe that Anita may have been marked by Marmee Noir, but once Anita reclaims her anger from Richard the link is back. Marmee Noir cannot understand Anita's rage because it belongs to Anita and was not passed down from her to any of Marmee Noir's vampire descendants.|$|R

Though his life was spared, Kwon-yoo was castrated by Hwa-yeon's father for daring to elope with her {{and he is now}} resentful and embittered towards both of them. Kwon-yoo has aligned himself with Minister Yoon and the Queen Mother to find power in his new position and rebuffs Hwa-yeon. Hwa-yeon's efforts to free her father and rescue him from execution are sabotaged by Kwon-yoo, who directly undermines Sung-won's exoneration orders to ensure the man's death. Kwon-yoo agrees to assassinate Hwa-yeon and her child with a block of poisonous aconite received from Minister Yoon by the orders of the Queen Mother, who wishes to secure her position and remove Hwa-yeon from influencing Sung-won.|$|R
