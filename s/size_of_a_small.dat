These representations must satisfy some conditions of coverage, i. e. providing <b>a</b> good approximation <b>of</b> the non-dominated set, spacing, i. e. without redundancies, and cardinality, i. e. with the smallest possible number of points.

Among these, the kernels of small, or possibly optimal, cardinality are claimed to be good representations of the non-dominated set. We first establish some general properties on ε-kernels.
