5000|$|However Antonio de Dios {{has also}} been heavily criticized by some conservationists for his {{commercial}} interests in the <b>Spix's</b> <b>macaw,</b> one of the rarest birds in the world, despite his success in captive breeding the species.

50|$|The {{foundation}} is particularly active in conserving the most endangered parrot {{species in the}} world, both with captive breeding (such as with the critically endangered <b>Spix's</b> <b>macaw)</b> and field projects as well (such as with the equally critically endangered indigo-winged parrot).|$|R
25|$|Various {{accounts}} relate {{that the}} birds were more common in Pernambuco than in Bahia through the 1960s but not later. <b>Spix's</b> <b>macaw</b> was most recently (1974–1987) known in the Río São Francisco valley, in northeastern Brazil, principally in the basins {{on the south side}} of the river in the State of Bahia. In 1974, ornithologist Helmut Sick, based on information from traders and trappers, extended the possible range of the <b>Spix's</b> <b>macaw</b> to embrace the northeastern part of the state of Goias and the southern part of the state of Maranhao. Other ornithologists reporting the bird in various parts of the state of Piaui further extended the range to a vast area of the dry interior of northeast Brazil.|$|R
5000|$|Rio is a 2011 American 3D computer-animated {{adventure}} film {{produced by}} Blue Sky Studios {{and directed by}} Carlos Saldanha. The title refers to the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro, where the film is set. The film features the voices of Jesse Eisenberg, Anne Hathaway, Jemaine Clement, Leslie Mann, George Lopez, and Jamie Foxx. It {{tells the story of}} Blu (Eisenberg), a male <b>Spix's</b> <b>macaw</b> who is taken to Rio de Janeiro to mate with a free-spirited female <b>Spix's</b> <b>macaw,</b> Jewel (Hathaway). The two eventually fall in love, and together they have to escape from being smuggled by Nigel (Clement), a cockatoo. The theme song, [...] "Telling the World" [...] was performed by Taio Cruz.|$|R

2500|$|One of the {{earliest}} records (and one of very few at all) of a <b>Spix's</b> <b>macaw</b> in a public zoo was a dramatic display of [...] "the four blues" [...] including Spix's, glaucous, hyacinth, and Lear's macaws in 1900 at the Berlin Zoo.|$|R
25|$|Two of {{the birds}} were {{captured}} for trade in 1987. A single male, paired with a female blue-winged macaw, was discovered at the site in 1990. A female <b>Spix's</b> <b>macaw</b> released from captivity at the site in 1995 was killed by collision with a power line after seven weeks. The last wild male disappeared from the site in October 2000; his disappearance was thought to have marked the extinction of this species in the wild. However, wild <b>Spix's</b> <b>macaws</b> may have been sighted in 2016.. While the IUCN Red List views its status as Critically Endangered and possibly extinct in the wild, ornithologist Nigel Collar of Birdlife International, the authority for the IUCN Redlist of birds now calls this bird extinct in the wild.|$|R
2500|$|The mating call of <b>Spix's</b> <b>macaw</b> can be {{described}} as the sound [...] "whichaka". The sound is made by creating a low rumble in the abdomen bringing the sound up to a high pitch. Its voice is a repeated short grating. It also makes squawking noises.|$|R
50|$|The {{preserve}} {{is known}} for breeding endangered and threatened species of animals and vascular plants, including the beira antelope, golden-headed lion tamarin, dibatag, Encephalartos, Sudan cheetah and North African ostrich. It is most noted for its breeding of <b>Spix's</b> <b>macaw,</b> one of the rarest bird species in the world.|$|R
25|$|In the 2009–2010 {{breeding}} season, {{a research}} collaboration between Loro Parque Fundación of Tenerife, Canary Islands and the University of Giessen in Germany used {{a new technique}} developed for semen collection and tested in many other parrot species on the <b>Spix's</b> <b>macaws.</b> However, artificial insemination was not used in this case.|$|R
