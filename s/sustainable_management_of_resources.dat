50|$|Over {{the past}} two centuries a growing {{environmental}} movement has emerged that is concerned about humankind's effects on the Earth. The key issues of this socio-political movement are the conservation of natural resources, elimination of pollution, and the usage of land. Although diverse in interests and goals, environmentalists as a group tend to advocate <b>sustainable</b> <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> and stewardship of the environment through changes in public policy and individual behavior. Of particular concern is the large-scale exploitation of non-renewable resources. Changes sought by the environmental movements are sometimes in conflict with commercial interests due to the additional costs associated with managing the environmental impact of those interests.|$|E

Computation of the weight in AHP is subjective and judgmental, thus the prioritization of resources can be varied while sustaining the mathematical requirements of AHP calculations.

The first deals with the security of individual property rights on established agricultural lands and their effects on agricultural production and employment. The second involves tenurial arrangements on forested areas and their impact on the <b>sustainable</b> <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources.</b> The analysis concludes that strengthening property rights should be an important part of a strategy to reduce deforestation rates in the region. However, it also suggests that tenurial reforms are not a solution by themselves to prevent excessive land clearing.
