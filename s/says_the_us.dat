2500|$|The {{government}} {{was criticized for}} its decision to tow the ailing wreck out to sea [...] where it split in two [...] rather than in to a port. World Wildlife Fund's senior policy officer for shipping Simon Walmsley believed most of the blame lay with the classification society. [...] "It was reported as being substandard {{at one of the}} ports it visited before Spain. The whole inspection regime needs to be revamped and double-hulled tankers used instead," [...] he <b>says.</b> <b>The</b> <b>US</b> and most other countries are phasing out single-hulled tankers by 2012.|$|E

5000|$|Gary Sick, an Iran {{expert at}} Columbia University, <b>says</b> <b>the</b> <b>U.S.</b> {{made a mistake}} by {{allowing}} Americans to collect such large damages in these uncontested cases.

5000|$|Walker has {{compared}} the present-day United States to the Roman Empire in its decline, <b>saying</b> <b>the</b> <b>U.S.</b> government is on a [...] "burning platform" [...] of unsustainable {{policies and practices}} with fiscal deficits, expensive overcommitments to government provided health care, swelling Medicare and Social Security costs, the enormous expense of a prospective universal health care system, and overseas military commitments threatening a crisis if action is not taken soon.|$|R
50|$|Other {{legal experts}} {{point to the}} fact that <b>the</b> current <b>U.S.</b> {{government}} did not exist prior to June 21, 1788 when the United States Constitution was ratified. Therefore, they <b>say</b> <b>the</b> <b>U.S.</b> government inherited <b>the</b> institution of slavery, and cannot be held legally liable for the enslavement of Africans by Europeans prior to that time. Figuring out who was enslaved by whom in order to fairly apply reparations from <b>the</b> <b>U.S.</b> government only to those who were enslaved under U.S. laws, would be an impossible task.|$|R

50|$|Producer Milton Sperling, who had {{frequently}} quarreled with Lang on the set, {{thought the}} final scene ridiculous, since the audience knew the Germans had no nuclear capacity. Ironically, screenplay writers Lardner and Maltz became two of the Hollywood Ten, accused of adding communist dogma to movie scripts such as this one. Writing a script <b>saying</b> <b>the</b> <b>US</b> could not keep nuclear secrets from the USSR, such as in this film, {{was just one of}} many accusations against the Ten.|$|R

5000|$|By March 2007, the ISG report {{had been}} {{downloaded}} more than 1.5 million times, {{according to the}} US Institute for Peace website. The Report is readily available for direct reading. Some (of many) results include: assessing stability as 'elusive' and the situation as [...] "deteriorating", that all of Iraq's neighbors (including Iran and Syria) must be included in an external diplomatic effort to stabilize Iraq, that worldwide commitments limit the U.S. from greatly increasing troop strength in Iraq, and that U.S attention on Iraq diverted resources from Afghanistan (an imbalance which the Report <b>says</b> <b>the</b> <b>U.S.</b> should restore to prevent Taliban and Al-Queada resurgence). There are many more recommendations.|$|E

5000|$|Hadi al-Amiri criticized {{those who}} were [...] "kissing the hands of <b>the</b> Americans", <b>saying</b> that <b>the</b> <b>US</b> {{failed to live up}} to its {{promises}} to help Iraq fight ISIL, unlike the [...] "unconditional" [...] assistance being given by Iran.|$|R
