5|$|After 1872, steel {{started to}} be {{introduced}} as a material for construction. Compared to iron, steel allows for greater structural strength for a lower weight.

5|$|The {{modern era}} in {{steelmaking}} {{began with the}} introduction of Henry Bessemer's Bessemer process in 1855, the raw material for which was pig iron.

The Gilchrist-Thomas process (or basic Bessemer process) was an improvement to the Bessemer process, made by lining the converter with a basic material to remove phosphorus.|$|E
