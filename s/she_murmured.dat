500|$|Elizabeth {{was well}} known for her dry witticisms. On hearing that Edwina Mountbatten was buried at sea, she said: [...] "Dear Edwina, she always liked to make a splash." [...] Accompanied by the gay writer Sir Noël Coward at a gala, she mounted a {{staircase}} lined with Guards. Noticing Coward's eyes flicker momentarily across the soldiers, <b>she</b> <b>murmured</b> to him: [...] "I wouldn't if I were you, Noël; they count them before they put them out." ...|$|E
2500|$|On the Sunday {{morning she}} felt weaker {{and asked if}} she could be taken back to Haworth. The doctor {{confirmed}} that she was near to death and Anne thanked him for his candour. [...] "Take courage, take courage" [...] <b>she</b> <b>murmured</b> to Charlotte. She died at 2pm on Monday 18 May. She is buried in the cemetery of St Mary's of Scarborough. Her gravestone carried an error in her age in the inscription because she {{died at the age of}} 29 and not at 28. It was noticed by Charlotte during her only visit, and she had the intention of asking the mason to correct it. Ill health did not leave him time to effect the repair and the tombstone remained in the same state until replaced by the Brontë Society in April 2013.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>murmured</b> something; {{but seemed}} to find it {{difficult}} to frame her answer.|$|E
5000|$|Margarete {{appears to}} have {{initially}} been taken aback, then her face softens and <b>she</b> <b>murmurs</b> [...] "Poor children!" ...|$|R
60|$|GERTY: With all my worldly goods I thee and thou. (<b>She</b> <b>murmurs)</b> You did that. I hate you.|$|R
6000|$|... "He is very nice," [...] <b>she</b> <b>murmurs,</b> [...] "but I {{suppose you}} are right. I suppose {{that sort of}} man does get on your nerves after a time." ...|$|R
60|$|Miss Naylor {{crossed the}} room; bowing, <b>she</b> <b>murmured</b> an apology, and also disappeared.|$|E
60|$|Through the sobs that well-nigh choked her <b>she</b> <b>murmured</b> {{the promise}} he desired.|$|E
60|$|She {{followed}} him to the door. 'What an uncivil thing to say!' <b>she</b> <b>murmured</b> in surprise.|$|E
60|$|EILEEN (dully--without {{opening her}} eyes). There's no pain. (There is another pause--then <b>she</b> <b>murmurs</b> indifferently.) There are {{chairs in the}} room you can bring out {{if you want to}} sit down.|$|R
6000|$|The heroine, too, {{shares the}} same point of view. [...] "Take me," [...] <b>she</b> <b>murmurs</b> as <b>she</b> falls into the hero's embrace, [...] "be my cave-man." [...] As she says it there is, so the writer assures us, {{something}} of the fierce light of the cave-woman in her eyes, the primordial woman to be wooed and won only by force.|$|R
6000|$|It is Ginevra {{who speaks}} first. She {{is indeed the}} bolder of the two. She grips Amy's hand and says quite firmly, 'Amy, shall we go to another to-night?' This does not puzzle Amy, she is {{prepared}} for it, her honest grey eyes even tell that she has wanted it, but {{now that it is}} come she quails a little. 'Another theatre?' <b>she</b> <b>murmurs.</b> 'Ginevra, that would be five in one week.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>murmured,</b> {{considered}} her own life, {{but could not}} describe how it looked to her now.|$|E
60|$|The perturbed little brain had {{reckoned}} wrong. 'Well, {{it must be}} a Friday,' <b>she</b> <b>murmured</b> in a reverie.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think I will, Macumazahn," [...] <b>she</b> <b>murmured,</b> whereon I {{collapsed}} into silence, feeling {{that things were}} getting beyond me.|$|E
60|$|She rushes about {{preparing}} a meal for him, {{every bit of}} her wanting to cry out to every other bit, 'Oh, glory, glory, glory!' For a moment she hovers behind his chair. 'Kenneth'! <b>she</b> <b>murmurs.</b> 'What?' he asks, no longer aware that she is taking a liberty. 'Nothing,' she says, 'just Kenneth,' and is off gleefully for the tea-caddy. But when his tea is poured out, and he has drunk a saucerful, the instinct of self-preservation returns to him between two bites.|$|R
6000|$|... "Safe, safe, safe," [...] {{the heart}} of the house beats proudly. [...] "Long years--" [...] he sighs. [...] "Again you found me." [...] "Here," [...] <b>she</b> <b>murmurs,</b> [...] "sleeping; in the garden reading; laughing, rolling apples in the loft. Here we left our treasure--" [...] Stooping, their light lifts the lids upon my eyes. [...] "Safe! safe! safe!" [...] the pulse of the house beats wildly. Waking, I cry [...] "Oh, is this your buried treasure? The light in the heart." ...|$|R
5000|$|Winter arrives, {{and with}} it the lean times the friends had anticipated. The mouse proposes a trip to the church to {{retrieve}} the provisions stored there. When she beholds the empty pot, enlightenment dawns on the mouse: [...] "First 'Top-off,' [...] " [...] <b>she</b> <b>murmurs,</b> [...] "then 'Half-gone,' and then ..." [...] The cat warns her to say no more, but the mouse persists. The cat pounces on the mouse and eats her up. [...] "And that is the way of the world," [...] the story closes.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Beautiful earth!' <b>she</b> <b>murmured</b> {{softly to}} herself, 'Thy {{mountains}} are the watch-towers of angels, thy moonlight is {{the shadow of}} God!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No,' <b>she</b> <b>murmured.</b> A heavy thrill {{ran down}} her nerves, heavy, almost pleasure, almost pain. 'What can be done?' she added.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Poor Mysie,' exclaimed Lord Rotherwood, {{bursting}} {{out laughing}} at the idea, and at Lady Merrifield's look as <b>she</b> <b>murmured,</b> 'My Mysie!' ...|$|E
60|$|I saw my mother's lips move, and I knew <b>she</b> was <b>murmuring</b> {{a thanksgiving}} {{to the power}} which had {{preserved}} her husband and son through the late struggle.|$|R
6000|$|In {{the same}} mood, looking {{far down the}} future, thou sangest of thy lady's age, the most sad, the most {{beautiful}} of thy sad and beautiful lays; for if thy bees gathered much honey 't was somewhat bitter to taste, {{as that of the}} Sardinian yews. How clearly we see the great hall, the grey lady spinning and humming among her drowsy maids, and how they waken at the word, and she sees her spring in their eyes, and they forecast their winter in her face, when <b>she</b> <b>murmurs</b> ''Twas Ronsard sang of me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah! give it me,' <b>she</b> faintly <b>murmured,</b> {{extending}} her hand; {{and then}} she added, in a firmer and livelier tone, 'and did you really wear it near your heart!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will not}} always say so," [...] <b>she</b> <b>murmured.</b> [...] "You have {{everything}} in your favour now--youth, strength, experience, and reputation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your {{interest}} in your fellow creatures," [...] <b>she</b> <b>murmured</b> demurely, [...] "is wonderful, but couldn't you concentrate {{it just a}} little?" ...|$|E
60|$|She {{turned over}} some {{embroidered}} slippers on a booth, {{and seemed to}} be inspecting them. 'But my children?' <b>she</b> <b>murmured</b> anxiously.|$|E
6000|$|... "It wouldn't {{have helped}} YOU" [...] Mrs. Brook retorted. [...] "And won't {{you have to}} say it's ALL you were to get?" [...] <b>she</b> pityingly <b>murmured</b> to her other visitor.|$|R
60|$|The {{note was}} placed in Emily's hands, and with a bow from Lord Rotherwood, <b>she</b> retreated, <b>murmuring</b> to herself the remonstrance which she had not courage to bestow upon the Marquis.|$|R
6000|$|A very mean diddle is this. A lady is insulted in {{the street}} by a diddler's accomplice. The diddler himself flies to her assistance, and, giving his friend a {{comfortable}} thrashing, insists upon attending the lady to her own door. He bows, with his hand upon his heart, and most respectfully bids her adieu. She entreats him, as her deliverer, to walk in and be introduced to her big brother and her papa. With a sigh, he declines to do so. [...] "Is there no way, then, sir," [...] <b>she</b> <b>murmurs,</b> [...] "in which I may be permitted to testify my gratitude?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My sister," [...] <b>she</b> <b>murmured,</b> [...] "is so independent. She is Bohemian to the finger-tips. She {{makes me}} feel terribly old-fashioned." ...|$|E
6000|$|Jane Porter shuddered. [...] "The mysterious jungle," [...] <b>she</b> <b>murmured.</b> [...] "The terrible jungle. It renders {{even the}} manifestations of {{friendship}} terrifying." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{looked up}} swiftly. 'It's very tiresome, I can't find {{anywhere}},' <b>she</b> <b>murmured,</b> 'I can't find anywhere the--the little red box key.' ...|$|E
6000|$|When I {{watch my}} child, {{who is not}} yet three years old, I can see so many signs of {{knowledge}} from beyond her own mind; why else should she be so excited when a little boy passes outside the window, and take so little interest in a girl; why should she put a cloak about her, and look over her shoulder to see it trailing upon the stairs, as she will some day trail a dress; and why, above all, as she lay against her mother's side, and felt the unborn child moving within, did <b>she</b> <b>murmur,</b> [...] "Baby, baby?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'She {{shook her}} head and went on her way. Yet she was a little moved. [...] "He did it on principle," [...] <b>she</b> would <b>murmur.</b> [...] "He had no {{animosity}} towards them, and profited nothing!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 11. 8, 9. A drear Murmur, {{between their}} songs, {{is all the}} woodmen hear. Echo will not now repeat the songs of the woodmen; <b>she</b> merely <b>murmurs</b> some snatches of the 'remembered lay' of Adonais.|$|R
