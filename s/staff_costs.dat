25|$|The mean {{annual salary}} {{of a medical}} {{specialist}} is $175,011 in the US, and $272,000 for surgeons. However, because of commodity inflation, increasing negligent costs, steep price rise of rental, the annual salary range of a medical specialist varies and is not rising as fast as other professional pay. Often, especially in the United States, physicians practice in groups of specialists within a particular medical specialty. These practice groups are often formed to help reach economies of scales in rental, insurance and <b>staff</b> <b>costs</b> {{as well as other}} benefits of practicing with other professionals and are typically governed by various legal documents.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} years of the line, it had been {{operated}} under the train staff and ticket system; the sections were Monmouth Troy to Wyesham Junction, Wyesham Junction to Tintern, and Tintern to Wye Valley Junction. This basic system was rather limiting, and in 1907 the Great Western Railway implemented the electric train staff system, with more sections: Troy, Wyesham Junction, Redbrook, Bigsweir, Tintern, Tidenham and Wyesham Junction were the new staff stations. In addition an electric train tablet system was installed, enabling long section working at quiet periods. Nevertheless, the system incurred significant additional signalling <b>staff</b> <b>costs,</b> and in 1927 a rationalisation scheme was introduced, in which several of the staff stations were abolished.|$|E

On the other hand, NWSC was in bad condition with regard to operational and financial aspects.

40|$|Potential {{benefits}} to reducing turnover times are both quantitative (e. g., complete more cases and reduce <b>staffing</b> <b>costs)</b> and qualitative (e. g., improve professional satisfaction). Analyses {{have shown the}} quantitative arguments to be unsound except for reducing <b>staffing</b> <b>costs.</b> We describe a methodology by which each surgical suite can use its own numbers to calculate its individual potential reduction in <b>staffing</b> <b>costs</b> from reducing its turnover times. Calculations estimate optimal allocated operating room (OR) time (based on maximizing OR efficiency) before and after reducing the maximum and average turnover times. At four academic tertiary hospitals, reductions in average turnover times of 3 to 9 min would result in 0. 8 % to 1. 8 % When surgeons evaluated the performance of an academic anesthesiology department, they rated turnover times {{as the most important}} quality attribute with below average performance (1).

40|$|This study applied panel {{analysis}} {{to determine the}} factors influencing interest margins in Nigeria using bank-specific, sector-specific and macroeconomic data ranging from 2010 :Q 1 to 2014 :Q 2.

The result shows that credit risk, growth in loans and advances, <b>staff</b> operating <b>cost,</b> GDP growth, inflation rate and money supply growth are significant determinants of interest margins in Nigeria. Consistent with previous studies, <b>staff</b> <b>cost</b> exerts highest impact on interest margins followed by fixed effects term. Further analysis of the banks' fixed effects reveals that seven banks control about 64 %, which raises a policy concern for banks' supervisors.
