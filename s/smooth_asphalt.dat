In September 2006, it was announced that the entire bridge would be resurfaced, only five years after the last resurfacing. This was completed in November 2009 by the construction firm Stirling Lloyd. However, the surfacing was carried out by the Swiss firm Aeschlimann using its own workforce and also importing all the plant used. A new type of asphalt called Gussasphalt was used on the bridge deck. In addition to having a smooth, skid-resistant finish, it requires no compaction and can be applied in very thin layers, thus reducing the weight added to the bridge. It is also flexible and as a result should last longer than the previous resurfacing.|$|E

40|$|Wave {{overtopping}} initiates {{erosion of}} dikes, thereby compromising the safety against flooding. Structures integrated in a grass covered dike may decrease the resistance against erosion. In this study, CFD modelling {{is used to}} assess the effect of an asphalt road on top of the dike crest on the initiation of erosion due to wave overtopping. The Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations are solved via a k-ε turbulence model. Two wave overtopping experiments are used for validating the hydrodynamics and the coupled hydrodynamic-erosion model. The amount of scour caused by overtopping waves is predicted by combining the shear stresses from the CFD model with an erosion model including grass erosion. Both the hydrodynamics and scour depths show good agreement with the measurements. Results show that a dike profile with a road on top of the crest is more vulnerable to erosion development than a bare grass covered dike profile. This is caused by a combination of the <b>smoother</b> <b>asphalt</b> section and the damaged berms at the transitions of the asphalt with the grass cover...|$|R

This paper will give us a unique opportunity to highlight the historical use of street cleaning as a method for reducing stormwater pollutants, and will examine newly emerging street cleaning technologies. There have been many misconceptions concerning this potential stormwater management control. This paper will examine the limitations of street cleaning, and describe how it can be more effective.

Early Street Cleaning Tests Factors significantly affecting street cleaning performance include particle loadings, street texture, street moisture, parked car conditions, and equipment operating conditions (Pitt 1979).

40|$|Abstract—Systematic {{characterization}} of the scattering behavior of traffic targets, clutter, and their associated interactions are {{required in order to}} design and assess the performance of millimeter-wave-based sensors for automated highway system (AHS) applications. In this paper, the polarimetric radar backscatter response of various road surfaces is investigated both theoretically and experimentally. In general, it is found that the overall scattering response of road surfaces is composed of volume and surface scattering components. Recently a hybrid volume scattering model was developed for predicting the backscatter response of <b>smooth</b> <b>asphalt</b> surfaces at millimeterwave frequencies. There, only the volume scattering was accounted for, however, experimental results show that the surface scattering cannot be ignored when the surface roughness parameters become comparable to the radar wavelength. In this paper, the previous study is extended to include the radar backscatter response of concrete surfaces, snow-covered smooth surfaces, and rough asphalt or concrete surfaces. Radiative transfer (RT) theory is used to model the volume scattering and the integral equation model is used to describe the surface scattering. Asphalt and concrete mixtures are dense random media whose extinction and phase matrices are characterized experimentally. Ice and water over asphalt and concrete surfaces are modeled by homogeneous layers. Fresh snow is modeled by a sparse random medium whose extinction and phase matrices are obtained analytically. The University of Michigan 94 -GHz polarimetric radar system was used to perform polarimetric backscatter measurements of the aforementioned road surfaces at near grazing incidence angles (70 – 88). Comparison of the measured and theoretically predicted backscattering coefficients and polarimetric phase difference statistics shows excellent agreement.

40|$|The {{progressive}} {{increase of}} tire-size has concurred to a sensitive {{improvement of the}} adherence with consequent increase of car safety. However, the wide tires have problems to expel the water in excess in heavy rain condition. For this reason {{the phenomenon of the}} aquaplaning is increasingly felt and is the cause of several automotive accidents. It is not a case that nearly all tire manufacturers supply "rain" tires and adherence in wet conditions is highly advertised. A typical accident happens when aquaplaning occurs in motorway at high speed. One or more tires lose adherence and the car begins to spin. If the pilot is not able to regain the initial direction, the car may hit the guardrail or another car. In this case the modern control systems like the ESP (Electronic Stability Program) and the ASR (Anti Skid Regelung) do not have time or are not able to manage a pre-spin or spin situation at elevated slip-angles. In this paper, a fuzzy control system able to deal with these conditions is introduced. The car has been simulated with a 9 DOF lumped-mass model that {{does not take into account}} suspensions and it considers a rigid car on <b>smooth</b> <b>asphalt.</b> The model of adhesion of the tire, instead, takes into account the effect of transverse forces on the longitudinal adherence. An expert pilot controls a high-speed spin with difficulty also. In this paper, a fuzzy control system that is able to control the brake torque on each single tire has been considered. The fuzzy control system works quite well and the car does not even enter in a true spin if enough adherence is present or if the slippery zone on asphalt is limited...|$|E

40|$|A non-contact, {{non-destructive}} {{method is}} described {{that allows the}} user to measure pavement texture and loaded and unloaded profiles from a moving vehicle. ^ The device uses laser distance measuring gages. The gages are arranged such that their readings can be interpreted to give the loaded and unloaded pavement profiles and a measure of its texture. Four gages are mounted on a rigid beam that, in turn, is mounted {{on the side of}} a load vehicle. The gages read the distance to the pavement. Three of the gages are located outside the range of influence of the load wheel, and hence the pavement below these gages is undeflected. One of the gages is adjacent to the load wheel to measure the induced deflection. An algorithm is presented that relates all measurements to a common datum. ^ The three gages yield readings that are interpreted to give the profile (do the surveying). The gages make so many readings and so quickly, that the standard deviation of the readings, taken over a short time period, gives a measure of the texture. ^ A prototype device was constructed and tested. The results were: (1) Pavement profiles were calculated using the new system. These compare favorably, though not completely, with the transit surveys. (2) Standard deviations were recorded. These readings were taken over concrete, asphalt and porous friction surface pavements. Differences were noted between the textures of concrete (<b>smooth)</b> and <b>asphalt</b> (rough) pavements.

40|$|Electric and hybrid {{vehicles}} {{are becoming a}} more and more frequent addition in car manufacturers’ fleets of vehicles. Noise and vibrations in these vehicles differ from the noise and vibrations produced in a combustion engine car. Sound quality of combustion engines have previously been researched but little information {{is to be found}} on the sound quality of electric vehicles. In this study the perception of the tonal components produced by the electric motor in a pure electric car is investigated. The tones were rated on annoyance and well sounding scales by 30 subjects in a listening test and the threshold of when the tones become audible was investigated. Coupled to the subjects’ ratings is a measure called prominence ratio. Prominence ratio is used in the IT industry to classify the prominence of tonal components in IT-products. Sound files used in the listening test were recorded in a Volvo C 30 electric on <b>smooth</b> and rough <b>asphalt</b> at constant speeds of 50 km/h, 80 km/h and 0 - 100 km/h acceleration. The recorded files were filtered to suppress existing tonal components. Synthesized tones, created to represent the tones produced by the electric motor, were added to the filtered sound files. The synthesized tones were generated in two programs, either Pure Data or Head Acoustics Artemis. The results from the listening test show that the presence of tones in the interior sound of a car leads to an increase in annoyance compared to when the tones are not heard. In the study, tones below 1 kHz were harder to detect than tones above 1 kHz. The low frequency tones were detected by more than 50 % of the subjects at values of prominence ratio between 1 - 4 dB and the higher tones were detected at 0 dB.

40|$|Chemical {{application}} forms {{an important part}} of winter maintenance activities with the aim of upholding a high level of accessibility, regularity and safety of roads during winter time. The quantity of chemical on the road surface is crucial for the road surface conditions and will determine whether ice formation or snow compaction occurs. For decision makers it is therefore essential to ensure that there is a sufficient quantity of salt on the road surface according to the prevailing road and weather conditions. At the same time adverse environmental effects are well documented. Therefore, {{there is a need to}} use as little chemical as possible while still ensuring safe driving conditions. An optimized chemical usage requires that decision-makers have sufficient knowledge of the quantity of chemicals on the road surface at any time. The scope of this study is to acquire knowledge of how the quantity of salt on the road surface changes after application under different conditions and thereby to learn about the durability of salting actions. Further, it is to identify the physical processes that control the changes in the quantity of salt after application and important factors behind these processes. To study the questions addressed, field observations have been conducted. The field observations have been carried out on an ordinary road, open for traffic. The method has been to document the salt quantity before and after application. During the observations the salt and water quantity on the road surface was measured along with weather parameters, traffic data and data from the maintenance trucks. The salt quantity has been measured with the Sobo 20 instrument. Sobo 20 is a portable instrument that allows measurements on several locations and in different positions in the cross profile of the road. The unique feature of Sobo 20 is that the instrument itself adds measuring fluid onto the road surface during the measuring procedure and thereby is able to calculate the salt quantity on the road surface in terms of quantity per unit area. To document the accuracy and limitations of the instrument, some tests have been conducted. The conclusion is that Sobo 20 accurately measures the quantity of salt as brine, on both <b>smooth</b> surfaces and <b>asphalt</b> pavements. However, it only detects between 5 and 6 % of dry salt particles. Re-crystallized salt, made of finer grains, is detected at 58 % on smooth surface and 49 % on asphalt pavement. When using the Sobo 20 for the measurement of dry or pre-wetted salt, the displayed value must be interpreted only as the quantity of dissolved salt on the road surface, and not the total salt quantity. The field observations clearly show that there are large spatial variations in salt quantity after application due to the effect of traffic. There is large variation in the cross-section profile of the road. Not surprisingly, higher quantities are measured at road edges, between wheel tracks and at the centre of the road compared to inside wheel tracks. This is explained by salt gathering because of the traffic effect and the fact that there are higher quantities of water in these areas that allow more salt to dissolve. For the further examination of the changes in salt quantity as a function of time or traffic, it has been chosen to focus mainly on the salt quantity in wheel tracks. The results show significant differences in the quantity of salt after application between the various observations, and some of these differences can clearly be explained by the quantity of water on the road surface. The quantity of water on the road surface determines the quantity of salt after application. Wet road surfaces both dissolve and loose salt more rapidly than moist road surfaces. The data also show that there is a surprisingly rapid loss of salt, especially on wet road surfaces. After 200 to 400 passing vehicles, the quantity of salt equals that before application. Further, it is also clear that the measured salt quantity after application cannot be described by a simple linear or exponential decrease in salt quantity. Shortly after application there is an increase in the measured salt quantity, thereafter followed by a decrease in salt quantity. Based on the results from the field observations, three different physical processes that control the changes in salt quantity after application are identified. They are initial loss, dissolution of salt, and loss of salt. The initial loss of salt occurs at the time of spreading. The dissolution process is the process whereby solid salt dissolves in the water or brine present on the road surface. The process is mainly time-dependent and is relevant when spreading dry or prewetted salt. The loss of salt after application is time and traffic dependent and three distinct mechanisms have been identified that remove salt from the road surface: blow-off, spray-off and run-off. Blow-off is described as solid salt that is blown off the road surface by traffic, spray-off is dissolved salt sprayed off the road surface by traffic, while run-off is drainage of dissolved salt from the road surface. From the identification of the processes that control the salt quantity after application, a physically based model for the salt quantity is proposed. The model is certainly based on several simplifications and assumptions. The most important are that the dissolution and loss processes are independent, that there are linear relationship between time and traffic and that there is no run-off. The model is adapted to the empirical data from the field observations. The analyses show that the model produces a satisfactory fit with the data from the field observations, and it therefore seems reasonable to conclude that these processes and the model developed can explain the changes in salt quantity after application. Although the model seems to fit the data for salt measurements, it is realized that it makes some assumptions and simplifications that may be incorrect. To achieve a more precise model, further development is needed, for example the introduction of a function describing run-off and the incorporation of the effect of different vehicle types. In addition to a more complex model, data of higher quality are needed. The main results of this study are in the identification of the physical processes and in the principle of building a physically based model for the salt quantity on road surfaces. The attempt to understand the physical processes is essential to achieve a more thorough understanding of the phenomena of salt quantity on road surfaces after application.
