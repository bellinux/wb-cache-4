The performance of individu-als against organizational goals determines whether the organization meets its goals. The basic objectives of {{performance evaluation}}s are two-fold: firstly to reward employees for meeting organizational objectives and secondly to identify which objectives are not met and to develop action plans to ensure they are achieved in future. The present paper uses analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to evaluate employees performances based upon the criteria: quantity/quality of the work, planning/organization, initiative/commitment, teamwork/cooperation, communication and external factors. Each of these criteria has been divided into 3 subcriteria. Two hundred and ninety-four employees of Inter <b>System</b> <b>Maintenance</b> <b>Services</b> Sdn. Bhd. are evaluated on these subcriteria. Overall ranking of the employees has been obtained using the absolute measurement procedure of AHP...|$|E
40|$|Construction {{sector in}} Indonesia, {{especially}} for road construction projects are progressing very rapidly in recent years. Indonesia is intensively implementing the road construction project, from new road construction, road maintenance and repairs. Road construction sector in Indonesia is mostly using the conventional contract system, with {{a lump sum}} or unit price. In this conventional contract service user must fully bear {{the risks associated with}} the quality of work that is to be maintained. It required an innovative method in order to contract the service user and the service provider can be better off, for example with the system performance based contracting (PBC). This study will analyze the differences between the PBC system and conventional system by comparing the life cycle project, project coordination line, the construction, the maintenance period, and the budget plan contract. The research method used was a descriptive analytical methods and data collection through direct field observations and interviews with project case studies Construction Project Semarang-Bawen Road with PBC and Construction Project Semarang-Solo Highway. From the results, the fact that the PBC has a single stage system that is not present in the conventional contract there is <b>system</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>services.</b> At the PBC system imposed fines ranging from construction period while the conventional system of fines awarded the contract if the contract or is unable to complete the construction work by the duration of time that has been given. At the PBC system there is not planning consultant contracts while the conventional system, there are consultants planning consultant. At the PBC system maintenance is faster than the conventional contract system maintenance.

30|$|Consequently, it is {{attractive}} {{for the second}} life manufacturer to reduce costly but quality-ensuring repurposing activities (e.g., disassembly, inspection, repairs, replacements, and testing) to a minimum. Moreover, instead of integrating costly low-maintenance, fail-safe components and additional safety mechanisms into the repurposed battery <b>systems,</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>services</b> and remote monitoring might be offered to the customer. Corresponding policies of the second life manufacturer {{increase the risk of}} defects, limit the longevity of the battery system, and might also affect the automotive OEM. Even though the automotive OEM delegates his obligations, a negative performance of the second life manufacturer in his tasks of repurposing and recycling used EVBs can rebound upon the OEM and damage its brand (ATI:MD°# 3). Overall, the potential revenue from repurposing the used EVBs will only make a very small part of the OEM’s business, whereas it is the core business of the second life manufacturer. One may thus expect the OEM to act rather risk-averse, whereas the second life manufacturer might have to take risks to establish himself as a player on the market. However, despite this risk, the automotive OEM is not able to fully monitor the second life manufacturer’s actions (hidden action). Without a further (financial) alignment of the OEM’s and the second life manufacturer’s interests and the securing of a compliant behavior of both parties, this may lead to moral hazard (EC# 2).|$|R

Subway cars in classes R26 to R46 went through general overhaul programs to fix and rehabilitate rolling stock. Older equipment (any car classes with contract numbers below R32s on the B Division and R26s on the A Division) were retrofitted with air conditioning. The red tag areas were incrementally repaired and welded rail could be seen on many lines {{by the end of the}} 1980s. At the end of the century, the MDBF rates for the entire system were at record highs and steadily increasing. The Franklin Avenue Shuttle, however, was worse in 1989 than it was in 1980, and necessitated a complete renovation by 1998, because the MTA planned to abandon the line by the end of the century.|$|R

40|$|Facility {{maintenance}} management (FMM) {{has become an}} important topic for research on the operation phase of the construction life cycle. Managing FMM effectively is extremely difficult owing to various factors and environments. One of the difficulties is the performance of 2 D graphics when depicting <b>maintenance</b> <b>service.</b> Building information modeling (BIM) uses precise geometry and relevant data to support the <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> of facilities depicted in 3 D object-oriented CAD. This paper proposes a new and practical methodology with application to FMM using BIM technology.

The BIMFMM system is then applied in selected case study of a commercial building project in Taiwan to verify the proposed methodology and demonstrate its effectiveness in FMM practice.

40|$|The {{field of}} {{industrial}} maintenance management is evolving constantly, as {{the trend of}} servitization and outsourcing of support <b>services</b> affect <b>maintenance</b> operations. In-house maintenance organizations have moved at least partly towards inter-organizational relationships in different company networks (consisting of customer companies, service providers and equipment providers). Hand in hand with structural change, new valuecreating opportunities have emerged. Equipment providers enter the service market {{more and more often}} to level out cyclical changes in equipment sales. In addition, an increasing number of companies that focus primarily on <b>maintenance</b> <b>services</b> have entered the market (often as a result of outsourced in-house operations). The purpose of this thesis is to clarify the nature of <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> value and capture the different value creation strategies in service networks. First, the study identifies what the value creating elements and features in industrial <b>maintenance</b> <b>services</b> are. Second, the study explores how <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> operations are currently managed. Thirdly, the thesis studies what the prerequisites for successful <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> networks are. The thesis employs the mixed methods approach where both quantitative and qualitative methods are used in the empirical part of the research. The survey method is utilized for quantitative data collection in order to decipher the complex nature of <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> value. After quantitative analysis, a qualitative case study is used to explain the identified value creation strategies and the role of networks in value creation further. The findings of this thesis indicate that successful <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> networks are created stagewise by utilizing comprehensive value creation capabilities. The thesis offers three main contributions to the field. First, it presents a framework for successful <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> networks where different value creation strategies at different relationship and offering levels in <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> networks are identified. Second, it provides a multidimensional value construct where the comprehensive value of <b>maintenance</b> <b>services</b> is presented.
