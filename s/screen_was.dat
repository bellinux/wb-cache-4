5|$|Chase's {{decision}} {{to end the}} last episode abruptly with just a black <b>screen</b> <b>was</b> controversial. While Chase has insisted {{that it was not}} his intention to stir controversy, the ambiguity over the ending and question of whether Tony was murdered has continued for years after the finale's original broadcast and has spawned numerous websites devoted to finding out his true intention.|$|E

5|$|Smoke screens have {{continued}} {{to be used by}} attackers and defenders as a means of sowing confusion and hiding movements. During naval battles in the 18–19th centuries, shots were sometimes fired early so a defensive <b>screen</b> <b>was</b> erected before the ships converged, to spoil the aim of the enemy.|$|E
5|$|A Gothic <b>screen</b> <b>was</b> {{also added}} to the Norman nave at Peterborough, {{but this is an}} {{architectural}} oddity with no precedent or successor. The screen is composed of three enormous open arches, the two outer ones being much wider than that which frames the central door. The overwhelming composition is somewhat spoilt by the later porch and the fact that two towers of very different height pop up from behind the screen. Despite this, it is {{regarded as one of the}} supreme masterpieces of Gothic, revealing the enormous diversity and imagination of English medieval architects.|$|E
5|$|By far {{the most}} {{expensive}} variant in the BA range, the Fairmont Ghia featured leather upholstery, wood grain highlights, full power options and a unique suspension assembly. The premium sound system, which incorporated a full-colour LCD <b>screen,</b> <b>was</b> standard, and the centre console stack was characterised by an analogue clock. Reverse parking sensors were available {{for the first time}} in the BA, standard on the Ghia. The sensors feature an automatic turn-off function for use when towing a boat or trailer for example.|$|E

5|$|Commissioner Edward Keith-Roach {{described}} {{the screen as}} violating the Ottoman status quo that forbade Jews from making any construction in the Western Wall area. He informed the Jewish community that the removal had been carried out under his orders after receiving a complaint from the Supreme Muslim Council. The Arabs were concerned that the Jews were trying to extend their rights at the wall and with this move, ultimately intended to take possession of the Al-Aqsa Mosque. The British government issued an announcement explaining the incident and blaming the Jewish beadle at the Wall. It stressed that {{the removal of the}} <b>screen</b> <b>was</b> necessary, but expressed regret over the ensuing events.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of the PlayStation 2, Sony {{reported}} that the new system had compatibility issues with the Final Fantasy V half of Final Fantasy Anthology. The game experienced a bug where if players attempted to save their games, a graphical error would occur. Square then released a statement that only the look of the save <b>screen</b> <b>was</b> corrupted, and saving was still possible, and if players wished, repeatedly going {{into and out of the}} save screen would make a normal screen eventually appear. This incompatibility was fixed for the PAL and Greatest Hits releases of Final Fantasy Anthology.|$|E

5|$|In the 2000 ceremony, a dove {{image was}} {{projected}} on an enormous white cloth {{held by the}} athletes on the stadium floor. In 2004, an LED <b>screen</b> <b>was</b> used. In 2006, acrobats formed {{the shape of a}} dove. The 2008 ceremony had fireworks representing doves. In 2010, dove figures were projected on the stage floor. The 2012 ceremony had bicyclists with dove-wings, lit by LEDs. In the 2014 ceremony several dancers, holding strands of blue LED lights, danced on the shape of a dove projected on the stadium floor. In the 2016 ceremony , children with dove shaped kites were seen running with the first Olympic Laurel winner, Kipchoge Keino.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the best}} known nativity scene in America is the Neapolitan Baroque Crèche {{displayed}} annually in the Medieval Sculpture Hall of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Its backdrop is a 1763 choir screen from the Cathedral of Valladolid and a twenty-foot blue spruce decorated {{with a host of}} 18th-century angels. The nativity figures are placed at the tree's base. The crèche was the gift of Loretta Hines Howard in 1964, and the choir <b>screen</b> <b>was</b> the gift of The William Randolph Hearst Foundation in 1956. Both this presepio and the one displayed in Pittsburgh originated from the collection of Eugenio Catello.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1940, British {{aircraft}} {{were increasingly}} {{equipped with the}} IFF Mk.

IFF was a responder that sent out a pulse of radio signal immediately on reception of a radio signal from a radar system. The IFF's transmission mixed with the radar's own pulse, causing the blip to stretch out in time from a small peak to an extended rectangular shape.|$|E

The product of network <b>screening</b> <b>is</b> a list of sites that are ranked by priority for the conduct of detailed engineering studies. In turn, cost-effective projects are formulated from the studies. With the purpose of laying the foundation for improved network screening, the role of network <b>screening</b> <b>is</b> clarified, and how project cost and safety benefit can be antic-ipated at the time of <b>screening</b> <b>is</b> examined. The strengths and weaknesses of alternative assumptions on which the anticipation of safety benefit can be based are discussed. A way to guard against misallocation of resources due to the randomness of accident counts is suggested, and a method for finding peak sites within road sections <b>is</b> proposed. <b>Screening</b> <b>is</b> the low-cost examination of all entities of a population.

5|$|The {{scene in}} which Terrell kills Jedda, a Regula scientist, by {{vaporizing}} him with a phaser was filmed in two takes. Winfield and the related actors first played out the scene; this footage became the background plate. A blue <b>screen</b> <b>was</b> wheeled onto the set and actor John Vargas, {{the recipient of the}} phaser blast, acted out his response to being hit with the energy weapon. A phaser beam element was placed on top of the background plate, and Vargas' shots were optically dissolved into an airbrushed disintegration effect which matched Vargas' position in every frame.|$|E
5|$|Aisles {{were added}} to the nave in the 14th century, first on the north side and then on the south, {{doubling}} the seating capacity. More windows were also installed in the nave. A century later, a timber porch was built on the north side, the chancel arch was widened and a rood <b>screen</b> <b>was</b> installed, a standard feature of churches in the medieval era, as were wall decorations and paintings. Ecclesiastical feeling moved in favour of austere, whitewashed walls, screens and pillars by the 17th century, and Parliament decreed these changes in the 1640s. The vicar of Ifield, Reverend Robert Goddin, was a strict Protestant who was strongly opposed to Catholic-style worship, ceremony and church decoration, and he enforced the new style rigorously. The rood screen and all internal decoration were removed at this time.|$|E

A memorial tablet to James was erected in 1933 in the chapel of Rossall School; it was unveiled by Lord Derby, president of the Rossall School Corporation. A oak chancel <b>screen</b> <b>was</b> also erected as a memorial to James in St Mary's Church, Panteg, with the unveiling in 1935 being carried out by Lord Trevethin, a friend of James since childhood.

5|$|One {{reviewer}} {{criticized the}} decision to underclock the ATI Mobility Radeon X1600 graphics card by about 30percent its original speed. The notebook was also noted for running hot. Users complained that upgrading system memory was harder than in older Apple notebooks. Since the dimensions for the 15-inch MacBook Pro were tweaked slightly from the 15-inch PowerBook G4, older accessories such as notebook sleeves did not work with the new models. Some users noted a slight flickering when the <b>screen</b> <b>was</b> on lower brightness settings. Apple increased the battery capacity by 10 Wh, going from 50 in the PowerBook G4 to 60, but the more powerful Core Duo CPU required more power. Battery life therefore remained {{about the same as}} in previous models, at three-plus hours.|$|E
5|$|The Circus Starring Britney Spears, {{commonly}} referred to as the Circus Tour, was the seventh concert tour by American singer Britney Spears. It was launched in support of her sixth studio album, Circus (2008). Rumors of a tour arose as early as October 2007, after Spears released her fifth studio album Blackout; however, it was cancelled due to unknown reasons. The tour was officially announced in December 2008, with dates for American and British venues revealed. The stage was composed of three rings and set in-the-round to resemble an actual circus. Fashion designers Dean and Dan Caten created the costumes. A giant cylinder <b>screen</b> <b>was</b> set above the stage to showcase videos and backdrops. Effects were provided by Solotech. Magician Ed Alonzo joined Spears during the second act. The setlist was composed generally from her albums In the Zone, Blackout and Circus. Spears announced she would tour Australia {{for the first time in}} June 2009.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{music was}} {{composed}} by Peter McConnell, Michael Land and Clint Bajakian. The three had {{worked together to}} share the duties equally of composing the music for Monkey Island 2 and Fate of Atlantis, and continued this approach for Day of the Tentacle. According to McConnell, he had composed most of the music {{taking place in the}} game's present, Land for the future, and Bajakian for the past, outside of Dr. Fred's theme for the past which McConnell had done. The music was composed around the cartoonist nature of the game play, further drawing on Looney Tunes' use of parodying classical works of music, and playing on set themes for all of the major characters in the game. Many of these themes had to be composed to take into account different processing speeds of computers at the time, managed by the iMUSE music interface; such themes would include shorter repeating patterns that would play while the game's screen scrolled across, and then once the <b>screen</b> <b>was</b> at the proper place, the music would continue on to a more dramatic phrase.|$|E
50|$|However more {{material}} can <b>be</b> <b>screened</b> at once for a vibrating screen {{compared to a}} trommel <b>screen.</b> This <b>is</b> because {{only one part of}} the screen area of the trommel <b>screen</b> <b>is</b> utilised during the screening process whilst the entire <b>screen</b> <b>is</b> used for a vibrating <b>screen.</b> Trommel <b>screens</b> <b>are</b> also more susceptible to plugging and blinding, especially when different sized <b>screen</b> apertures <b>are</b> in series. Plugging is when material larger than the aperture may become stuck or wedged into the apertures and then may be forced through which is undesirable.
