The church permitted the remarriage of widows (as taught by the apostle Paul, not traditionally allowed in East Asian societies), prohibited concubinage and polygamy, and forbade cruelty to or desertion of wives. Christian parents were taught to regard their children as gifts from God, and were required to educate them. Arranged child marriages and the neglect of daughters (who were often regarded as less desirable than sons in Asian culture) were prohibited.|$|E

40|$|Consumer {{emancipation}} of consumption-related yet market-distanced social entities {{is developed}} and explored {{in this paper}} as a process conditioning communication about ideologies, meanings, norms, and values in the <b>social</b> form of <b>emancipation.</b> A <b>social</b> form of <b>emancipation</b> is theorized as an operationally closed, self-referential, and consumption-related social system, which, by social communication, {{is engaged in a}} permanent process of ensuring a social distinction between itself and its environment, which is the only device to be used to reproduce itself in the course of time. Interviews conducted with Napster consumers, netnographic fieldwork, observations, and archival data were collected {{over the past two years}} to map micro-emancipatory consumption discourse and practices and build an understanding of the moderato social processes constructing Napster as a subculture community. Our findings reveal that consumer emancipation is the reassurance of social difference through communication, and the implicit self-paradoxification of centering into the cultural crosshairs of the <b>social</b> form of <b>emancipation</b> those entities it wishes to distance from. Implications for consumer research are considered in a concluding section...|$|R

Meanwhile Diderot deserves credit for treating the position and character of women in a civilised society with a sense of reality; and for throwing aside those faded gallantries of poetic and literary convention, that screen a broad and dolorous gulf.|$|E

40|$|Development is {{a project}} of hope, guided by the {{aspiration}} for greater <b>social</b> justice and <b>emancipation</b> {{of the poor and}} disadvantaged in the world. Over the past decade postdevelopment critics have argued that this project of hope has failed, and, instead of creating a fairer world, development can only serve to perpetuate uneven power relationships. Emerging work by postdevelopment authors reinvigorates the positive promise of development as a project toward <b>emancipation</b> and <b>social</b> justice. Discursive practices of development professionals in northern Thailand illustrate how one might conceive of a postdevelopment practice in which aspirations toward <b>social</b> justice and <b>emancipation</b> can coexist alongside the messy realities of development work. Drawing on contemporary discourse theory, Ernesto Laclau's conceptualization of hegemonic struggle provides conceptual tools for thinking beyond the bind of development-as-power.
