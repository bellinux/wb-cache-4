25|$|In 1916, {{only two}} years after the school opened, the {{original}} buildings were destroyed in a fire. The school was rebuilt on its present site in 1917. Kathleen Worrell, wife of the school's first dean Steve H. Worrell, had <b>seen</b> <b>pictures</b> of Bhutanese buildings in an April 1914 issue of National Geographic. Noting the similarity of mountainous Bhutan (which is in the Himalayas) to the location of the campus, she suggested the new buildings be in the style of Bhutanese dzongs (monastic fortresses), with massive sloping walls and overhanging roofs. This idea was enthusiastically accepted by all.|$|E

500|$|The insurgents {{responded by}} attacking the Marines in small groups, often armed with RPGs. According to General Natonski, many insurgents had <b>seen</b> <b>pictures</b> of the Abu Ghraib scandal and were {{determined}} {{not to be taken}} alive. By 20 November, Marines had reached the southern boundary of the city, but pockets of insurgents still remained. The assault battalions divided the city into areas and crisscrossed their assigned areas in an attempt to find the insurgents. Four days later Zarqawi released an audiotape condemning Sunni Muslim clerics for their lack of support, claiming [...] "hundreds of thousands of the nation's sons are being slaughtered." [...] The fighting slowly ebbed and by 16 December the US had begun to reopen the city and allow residents to return.|$|E

2500|$|Shortly after Bush {{announced}} the Space Exploration Initiative, {{which included a}} manned landing on Mars, Quayle was asked his thoughts on sending humans to Mars.

2500|$|Research with captive African grey parrots, {{especially}} Irene Pepperberg's {{work with}} an individual named Alex, has demonstrated they possess the ability to associate simple human words with meanings, and to intelligently apply the abstract concepts of shape, colour, number, zero-sense, etc. According to Pepperberg and other scientists, they perform many cognitive tasks {{at the level of}} dolphins, chimpanzees, and even human toddlers. Another notable African grey is N'kisi, which in 2004 was said to have a vocabulary of over 950 words which she used in creative ways. For example, when Jane Goodall visited N'kisi in his New York home, he greeted her with [...] "Got a chimp?" [...] because he had <b>seen</b> <b>pictures</b> of her with chimpanzees in Africa.|$|E
2500|$|There was a {{tradition}} that the Central Asian Naimans and their Christian relatives, the Keraites, were descended from the Biblical Magi. This heritage passed to the Mongol dynasty of Genghis Khan when Sorghaghtani, niece of the Keraite ruler Toghrul, married Tolui the youngest son of Genghis and became the mother of Möngke Khan {{and his younger brother}} and successor, Kublai Khan. Toghrul became identified with the legendary Central Asian Christian king, Prester John, whose Mongol descendants were sought as allies against the Muslims by contemporary European monarchs and popes. Sempad the Constable, elder brother of King Hetoum I of Cilician Armenia, visited the Mongol court in Karakorum in 1247–1250 and in 1254. He wrote a letter to Henry I [...] King of Cyprus and Queen Stephanie (Sempad’s sister) from Samarkand in 1243, in which he said: “Tanchat , which is the land from whence came the Three Kings to Bethlehem to worship the Lord Jesus which was born. And know that the power of Christ has been, and is, so great, that the people of that land are Christians; and the whole land of Chata [...] believes those Three Kings. I have myself been in their churches and have <b>seen</b> <b>pictures</b> of Jesus Christ and the Three Kings, one offering gold, the second frankincense, and the third myrrh. And it is through those Three Kings that they believe in Christ, and that the Chan and his people have now become Christians”. The legendary Christian ruler of Central Asia, Prester John was reportedly a descendant of one of the Magi.|$|E
