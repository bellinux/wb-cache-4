Because the 649 <b>seizure</b> <b>signal</b> components were collected from multiple channels of both left and right hemispheres, we examined {{the distribution of the}} IF classes related to each EEG channel and for the two hemispheres to check if there is any preferential tendencies.

40|$|The {{systems for}} {{prediction}} of epileptic seizure investigated {{in recent years}} mainly rely on the traditional nonlinear analysis of the brain signals from intracranial electroencephalograph (EEG) recordings. The overall objective of this work focuses on investigation of the predictability of seizure from the scalp signals by applying effective blind source separation (BSS) techniques to scalp EEGs, in which the epileptic seizures are considered as independent components of the scalp EEGs. The ultimate goal {{of the work is}} {{to pave the way for}} epileptic seizure prediction from the scalp EEG. The main contributions of this research are summarized as follows. Firstly, a novel constrained topographic independent component analysis (CTICA) algorithm is developed for the improved separation of the epileptic <b>seizure</b> <b>signals.</b> The related CTICA model is more suitable for brain signal separation due to the relaxation of the independence assumption, as the source signals geometrically close to each other are assumed to have some dependencies. By incorporating the spatial and frequency information of <b>seizure</b> <b>signals</b> as the constraint, CTICA achieves a better performance in separating the <b>seizure</b> <b>signals</b> in comparison with other conventional ICA methods. Secondly, the predictability of seizure is investigated. The traditional method for quantification of the nonlinear dynamics of time series is employed to quantify the level of chaos of the estimated sources. The simultaneously recorded intracranial and scalp EEGs are used for the comparison of the results. The experiment results demonstrate that the separated seizure sources have a similar transition trend as those achieved from the intracranial EEGs. Thirdly, simultaneously recorded EEG and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is studied in order to validate the activated area of the brain related to the seizure sources. An effective method to remove the fMRI scanner artifacts from the scalp EEG is established by applying the blind source extraction (BSE) algorithm. The results show that the effect of fMRI scanner artifacts has been reduced in scalp EEG recordings. Finally, a data driven model, spatial ICA (SICA) subject to EEG as the temporal constraint is proposed in order to detect the Blood Oxygen-Level Dependence (BOLD) from the seizure fMRI. In contrast to the popular model driven method General Linear Model (GLM), SICA does not rely on any predefined hemodynamic response function. It is based on the fact that brain areas executing different tasks are spatially independent. Therefore SICA works perfectly for non-event-related fMRI analysis such as seizure fMRI. By incorporating the temporal information existing within the EEG as the constraint, the superiority of the proposed constrained SICA is validated in terms of better algorithm convergence and a higher correlation between the time courses of the component and the <b>seizure</b> EEG <b>signals</b> as compared to SICA...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The implantable {{closed-loop}} system for epileptic seizure detection and neuromodulation {{is getting more}} attention in recent years. The architecture design for <b>seizure</b> <b>signal</b> sensing and analyzing has been proposed, but {{the implementation of the}} classifier for unsupervised seizure detection is still strongly desired. The k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classification algorithm is one commonly used classifiers in previous researches, yet it needs the training data from both non-seizure and seizure EEG/ECoG states, which are difficult to be collected. Also, the large size of the training set and the concept of the exhaustive search for nearest neighbors make the classification procedure power-consuming. In this paper, we propose a sub-microwatt KNN classifier which only requires the non-seizure EEG/ECoG for training. The size of the training set memory as well as the leakage power is saved by 50 %. The processing dynamic power is further reduced by 93. 9 % due to the early termination scheme. This work achieves the sensitivity of 98. 04 % and the false alarm rate of 1. 97 % with optimized power consumption at sub-microwatt, and is suitable for the implantable devices. ...|$|E

An analysis of EEG data from three patients experiencing epileptic seizures is made using the developed measure, resulting in successful identification of increased potential difference in portions of the brain that correspond to physical symptoms demonstrated by the patients. A mapping then is devised to transport the measure data onto the surface of a high-dimensional manifold, enabling the analysis of seizures using directional statistics and manifold theory.

30|$|Nowadays, the {{detection}} of EEG signals is an important key issue in biomedical research for diagnosis and evaluation.

EEG signals indicate the electrical activity of the brain and contain useful information about the brain state to study brain function [2]. The identification of different category EEG signals is traditionally performed by experts based on the visual interpretation. The manual scoring is subject to human errors and it is time consuming, costly process, and not sufficient enough for reliable information [3, 4].

30|$|For a multi-component signal, {{consisting}} of a sum {{of two or more}} mono-component signals, the notion of a single IF becomes inappropriate. To characterise this type of signals, each mono-component is assigned its own IF. Among several IF estimation methods specifically designed for multi-component signals that were previously proposed by some of the authors of this article in[21, 27], the method in[21] is selected; it estimates IFs of multi-component signals by detecting and linking the local peaks of the TFD. This method has the advantage of not requiring prior knowledge about the signal under analysis except that its components are clearly separated in the time-frequency (TF) domain; a condition often satisfied by newborn EEG signals. The method has been successfully applied to biomedical signals such as EEG and ECG[20, 28, 29]. As <b>seizure</b> <b>signals</b> mostly have a high signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio[16, 22], we decided to use this more established method for IF estimation rather than, for example, using the more recently proposed method for extracting IF from signals with low SNR[27].

An in-depth analysis of the previously proposed autocorrelation and spectrum seizure detection techniques identified the detection criteria that can be readily extended to the TF domain.

Fifty million people worldwide suffer from epilepsy; after Alzheimer’s and stroke, it is the third widespread nervous disorder.

By selecting effective features from <b>seizure</b> and non-seizure <b>signals</b> of each individual and putting them into two categories, the proposed algorithm detects the onset of seizures quickly and with high sensitivity. Method: In this algorithm, L-sec epochs of signals are displayed in form of a thirdorder tensor in spatial, spectral and temporal spaces by applying wavelet transform. Then, after applying general tensor discriminant analysis (GTDA) on tensors and calculating mapping matrix, feature vectors are extracted. GTDA increases the sensitivity of the algorithm by storing data without deleting them. Finally, K-Nearest neighbors (KNN) is used to classify the selected features.

This acquisition process leads to a collection of huge amounts of irrelevant data, only to be discarded during the compression stage of the signals. Furthermore, transients, which are common in EEG signals, are not bandlimited. Hence, Shannon's sampling theory {{cannot be applied to}} sampling EEG signals. Over the last few years, advancements in signal processing and data acquisition introduced a new sampling theory known as compressive sampling or compressed sensing [10]. Aviyente proposed a compressed sensing framework for EEG compression by exploiting the sparsity of EEG signals in a Gabor frame [11]. This method, however, does not operate on the analog EEG signals directly. Compressive sampling, on the other hand, asserts that its acquisition system directly translates analog signals into compressed digital form so that one can recover super-resolved signals from a few measurements [10]. Similarly, we propose to approach the problem of compressing EEG signals at source. In order to address the nonbandlimitedness of the EEG signals, our compression method will be based on the theory of sampling signals with finite rate of innovation (FRI) [12].
