I {{suffered}} the last and worst of many indignities at my husband's hands--at the very time when I first <b>saw,</b> <b>set</b> plainly before me, the way to take his life. He went out toward noon next day, to go his rounds among the public houses; my mind being then strung up to deliver myself from him, for good and all, {{when he came back}} at night.|$|E
60|$|I must confess, also, {{that the}} bad {{examples}} which I <b>saw</b> <b>set</b> by men professing to be Christians, {{had a strong}} tendency to disgust me with religion. The great mistake I made was, in supposing I had undergone any real change of heart. Circumstances disposed me to reflect, and reflection brought me to be serious, on subjects that I had hitherto treated with levity; but the grace of God was still, in a great degree, withheld from me, leaving me a prey to such arguments {{as those of the}} steward, and his great prophet and master, Mr. Paine.|$|E
60|$|It may be well {{if we go}} {{to school}} in Asia, for the {{distance}} from life in European art has come from little but difficulty with material. In half- Asiatic Greece Kallimachos could still return to a stylistic management of the falling folds of drapery, after the naturalistic drapery of Phidias, and in Egypt the same age that saw the village Head-man carved in wood for burial in some tomb with so complete a naturalism <b>saw,</b> <b>set</b> up in public places, statues full of an august formality that implies traditional measurements, a philosophic defence. The spiritual painting of the 14th century passed on into Tintoretto and that of Velasquez into modern painting with no sense of loss to weigh against the gain, while the painting of Japan, not having our European Moon to churn the wits, has understood that no styles that ever delighted noble imaginations have lost their importance, and chooses the style according to the subject. In literature also we have had the illusion of change and progress, the art of Shakespeare passing into that of Dryden, and so into the prose drama, by what has seemed when studied in its details unbroken progress. Had we been Greeks, and so but half-European, an honourable mob would have martyred though in vain the first man who set up a painted scene, or who complained that soliloquies were unnatural, instead of repeating with a sigh, 'we cannot return to the arts of childhood however beautiful.' Only our lyric poetry has kept its Asiatic habit and renewed itself at its own youth, putting off perpetually what has been called its progress in a series of violent revolutions.|$|E
50|$|Using {{the same}} {{mechanical}} design as the Morrill or Taintor <b>saw</b> <b>sets,</b> several manufacturers repositioned the handles {{to be held}} parallel to the blade, rather than perpendicular as with the original Morrill design. This is the form referred to as pistol-grip, due to its mild resemblance to {{the profile of a}} pistol. This form includes the 42 series from Stanley (X,W and 442), an E. C. Stearns design, as well as some contemporary <b>saw</b> <b>sets.</b>|$|R
50|$|Automated <b>saw</b> <b>sets</b> use machine {{automation}} {{rather than}} the user to move the setting mechanism between teeth. The mechanized nature should also apply the same pressure to each tooth.|$|R
50|$|To {{prevent the}} body of the blade binding and for other {{enhancements}} to the cutting action, the teeth can be set (angled out) from the blade. Teeth can be set in several patterns: single-sided set, alternating set or a patterned set. Most Western and Asian handsaws use an alternating set, whereby a tooth is set the opposite direction from the preceding one. Specialized tools like veneer saws or flush-cut <b>saws</b> may be <b>set</b> only to one side. Some hacksaws and machine saw blades have patterned sets that may require specially designed <b>saw</b> <b>sets</b> to create.|$|R

50|$|<b>Saw</b> <b>set</b> {{is a term}} {{applied to}} various forms of a tool used in the tuning and {{sharpening}} of saw blades. The <b>saw</b> <b>set</b> is used to adjust the set, or distance the saw tooth is bent away from the saw blade.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{milestone}} was {{the introduction}} of the Taintor [...] "positive" [...] <b>saw</b> <b>set.</b> It utilizes a multi-position anvil and a special cam that clamps to the blade before the plunger pushes against the tooth. The cam was designed to prevent the <b>saw</b> <b>set</b> moving once aligned with a tooth.|$|E

50|$|The {{simplest}} {{form of a}} lever <b>saw</b> <b>set</b> is a plate, usually of metal, {{thick enough}} to only fit over one tooth {{at a time and}} notched to a depth less than that of the tooth. To more easily create a consistent set, a stop of some form is added to the design ensuring the tool be levered to the same angle on each tooth. These stops (also, stop blocks) can be adjustable {{as in the case of}} the thumbscrews on the <b>saw</b> <b>set</b> in Fig. C.|$|E
50|$|The {{essential}} {{components of}} this type of <b>saw</b> <b>set</b> are an anvil and a striking tool, often a hammer. These tools range from common blacksmith's equipment to specially designed and marketed saw sets.|$|E
50|$|July 5 <b>saw</b> Beijing <b>set</b> a new highest {{temperature}} {{record at}} 40.3 C. Near record heat waves hit both Gansu Province, Guizhou and Inner Mongolia on the 5th.|$|R

5000|$|The {{inventor}} Charles Morrill {{introduced a}} <b>saw</b> <b>set</b> with a plunger {{based on his}} patent. [...] This design, as well as improvements added to it, came into prolific use and in the United States are frequently found with woodworking tools. An image of a Morrill design <b>saw</b> <b>set</b> is found at {{the introduction of the}} article. The plunger (also, pin) pushes against the saw tooth when the handles are squeezed together. The other face of the saw tooth rests against an anvil and the whole saw blade is held at the desired angle to the anvil by a stop or rest. On most designs both the anvil and the rest are adjustable.|$|E
50|$|One {{advantage}} of this design is that many lever saw sets can bend the tooth either direction. An alternating set can be made without turning the saw or <b>saw</b> <b>set</b> around as is generally necessary with Hammer or Pliers style saw sets.|$|E
50|$|Two-handled, or pistol-grip saw sets use {{the action}} of two handles closing to move cams or plungers. A pistol-grip style tool is most often what is {{thought of as a}} <b>saw</b> <b>set</b> in {{contemporary}} discussions of saw maintenance, especially amongst hand tool enthusiasts.|$|E

50|$|Saw sets come in many forms: from improvised to intricate, {{specially}} designed mechanisms. The {{demand for a}} more capable <b>saw</b> <b>set</b> is clear, as from 1810 to 1925 almost 900 different saw sets were patented. Saw sets can be categorized by the mechanical principle under which they operate.|$|E
50|$|The {{first game}} in the series, <b>Saw,</b> <b>set</b> between first and second film in the series, was {{initially}} released on October 6, 2009. with a sequel Saw II: Flesh & Blood, released on October 19, 2010 for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, ten days before {{the release of the}} seventh film, Saw 3D.|$|E
50|$|This type of <b>saw</b> <b>set</b> can {{be called}} lever, plate, wrest, spring or comb. The plate that forms {{the body of the}} tool is fitted over the saw and levered {{perpendicular}} to the saw blade which springs or bends the tooth to an angle. The name comb likely refers to versions with many slots which bears resemblance to a comb for hair.|$|E
