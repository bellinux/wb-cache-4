5|$|Firearm {{owners are}} allowed to {{practice}} only at licensed shooting ranges and may otherwise use the firearm only in case of self-defense, or when permitted by other laws (e.g. hunting). As of 2014, there are almost two hundred places opened for the public. Any adult can visit such a range and <b>shoot</b> <b>from</b> available weapons, without restrictions or permits. A person without a gun license has to be supervised (if younger than 18, then by a person at least 21 years old {{who has been a}} holder of a gun license for at least 3 years).|$|E

Aguilera then produces silhouettes of a catwoman style figure, until Aguilera as the catwoman character is shown, wearing a leather catsuit with cat ears, lighting bolts <b>shoot</b> <b>from</b> her hands until another scene featuring the same character shows her alongside a black motorbike holding a gun. Shots of both the blue haired character and catwoman lead to a scene featuring a blond Aguilera moving inside of the screens accompanied by multi-colored digital waves, before shots of the catwoman style character on a motorbike, shooting the gun are presented. Shots of the different scenes including one of Aguilera at the desk accompanied by a toy robot are shown finishing as Aguilera turns the screens off.|$|E

5|$|The film {{suffered}} setbacks {{in development}} in December 2002. Rudin left Unfortunate Events over budget concerns. While Sonnenfeld and Carrey remained, Sonnenfeld admitted he was skeptical of Paramount's $100million budget. The studio decided that changing the <b>shoot</b> <b>from</b> Hollywood to Wilmington, North Carolina {{would be less}} expensive. The April 2003 start date was also pushed back. Paramount eventually settled the situation in January 2003 by enlisting help from DreamWorks to co-finance the film, but Sonnenfeld vacated the director's position. Rudin and Sonnenfeld had no involvement with the film afterward, but were credited as executive producers. Carrey remained with approval over the hiring of the next director.|$|E

25|$|The center sets up {{in front}} of the {{opposing}} team's goalie and scores the most individually (especially during lower level play where flats do not have the required strength to effectively <b>shoot</b> <b>from</b> outside or to penetrate and then pass to teammates like the point guard in basketball, or center midfield player in soccer). The center's position nearest to the goal allows explosive shots from close-range.|$|E
25|$|Milner has {{the ability}} to pass {{accurately}} and <b>shoot</b> <b>from</b> a great distance from goal. As a result, he usually goes forward for set pieces and is often a candidate to take corners and free kicks. Critical opinion is divided as to Milner's crossing ability. While some commentators have been critical of his ability in this area, other journalists have said that Milner can produce accurate crosses.|$|E
50|$|As a redshirted {{junior at}} Missouri in 2012-13, Ross {{was the top}} scorer in the Southeastern Conference off the bench, {{averaging}} 11.0 points on 44 percent <b>shooting</b> <b>from</b> the floor and 41.7 percent <b>shooting</b> <b>from</b> three-point range in 24 contests off the pine.

The Burrs' daughter, Theodosia, was taught dance, music, several languages, and learned to <b>shoot</b> <b>from</b> horseback. Until her death at sea in 1813, she remained devoted to her father. Not only did Burr advocate education for women, upon his election to the New York State Legislature, he submitted a bill to allow women to vote.|$|E
25|$|The machine, {{dubbed the}} Million Volt Oscillator was {{installed}} in the band balcony overlooking the arena.

The chief engineer of the General Electric Company estimated that the discharges were at least 1,300,000 volts.|$|E
25|$|As a prospect, Bargnani drew many {{comparisons}} to German NBA player Dirk Nowitzki, mainly {{due to his}} ability to <b>shoot</b> <b>from</b> the perimeter, his mobility despite his size, and his ball-handling skills. Bargnani entered the 2006 NBA draft and was selected first overall by the Toronto Raptors. He is the first European player, sixth non-American player, and second player without U.S. college or high school experience to be drafted first overall, after Yao Ming.|$|E

In his first season with the club, he didn't get much playing time, averaging only 9 minutes played per game. In his second season with Baskonia, he averaged 4.8 points per game, on 56% <b>shooting</b> <b>from</b> the field, and 47% <b>shooting</b> <b>from</b> 3 point range, three in 13 minutes played per game.

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of his college career, McLemore was considered to be either a late first-round or early second-round prospect. However, during his first season as a redshirt freshman, McLemore averaged 16.3 points, 5.3 rebounds, and 2.0 assists, with 50.7% <b>shooting</b> <b>from</b> the field and 86.7% <b>shooting</b> <b>from</b> the foul line, and was named a finalist for the John R.

25|$|At sea, {{manoeuvres}} {{were slightly}} different {{and more complex}} because the operator would {{need to find a}} proper and stable place to fire. Some Hwacha operators preferred to be on the rowers' deck where they were able to <b>shoot</b> <b>from</b> the windows, while others preferred to be on the main deck so they could shoot at the sails of the enemy ships. These kind of manoeuvres were particularly seen on Korean Panokseon warships.|$|E
25|$|MGM {{inherited}} the production when it took {{over control of}} Goldwyn studios; with the film over budget and getting out of control, the studio halted production and relocated the <b>shoot</b> <b>from</b> Italy to California, {{under the supervision of}} Irving Thalberg. Before they had even returned from Italy, MGM would fire Mathis, Brabin, and stars George Walsh and Gertrude Olmstead; MGM replaced them with director Fred Niblo, screenwriters Bess Meredyth and Carey Wilson, and stars Ramon Novarro and May McAvoy.|$|E
25|$|Others {{were not}} so affable. In fact, some stars hedged: Richard Gere, a friend of Wessler's, said yes—but also {{said he would not}} be {{available}} for more than a year. So Wessler waited him out, convinced his sketch was good. Gere eventually called Wessler and told him he was free to shoot, on just a couple of conditions: They had to do it in four days, and they needed to relocate the <b>shoot</b> <b>from</b> Los Angeles to New York City.|$|E
5000|$|Week 5 - For the week, Kool {{averaged}} 23.5 {{points per}} game on 45.7% <b>shooting,</b> 42.9% <b>shooting</b> <b>from</b> three-point range and 100% <b>shooting</b> <b>from</b> the free throw line.

25|$|Morin {{was known}} as a goal scorer in juniors. He has the ability to <b>shoot</b> <b>from</b> {{anywhere}} and find open space to shoot, often going {{to the front of the}} net and finding space to score. He possesses a quick release that accompanies a solid shot. Morin is considered a gritty player for a goal scorer, he plays hard and has a bit of an edge in his game. He plays a solid all-round game, possesses a high hockey IQ, and competes every shift.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, work on Bande Mataram {{and other}} {{publications}} continued unabated. These were shipped by Acharya to India through contacts in Pondicherry, and at times under false covers including those of The Pickwick Papers. V.V.S. Iyer later returned to India, where he began training the Indian underground movement on explosives and bombs. On 17 June 1911, a young Indian revolutionary {{by the name of}} Vanchi Iyer fatally shot Robert D'escourt Ashe at Tirunelveli. Ashe had been a district collector who had earned notoriety for himself for his role in suppression of nationalist agitation and Swadeshi movement in 1908. Vanchi himself had learnt to <b>shoot</b> <b>from</b> Iyer in Pondicherry. The 1918 sedition committee report blamed Acharya for instigating, organising and planning the assassination.|$|E
25|$|After test screenings, it {{was decided}} to re-shoot Captain Kirk's death. Originally, Kirk was shot and killed by Doctor Soran, but it was felt by the test {{audience}} {{that this was not a}} fitting death for such an iconic character. The re-shoot changed the manner of his death, so that instead, he sacrifices himself by leaping across a broken walkway to retrieve Soran's control pad and de-cloak the trilithium warhead. As the production crew had already spent weeks removing traces of their <b>shoot</b> <b>from</b> the Valley of Fire, the set had to be rebuilt under a very tight schedule, followed by effects work to remove wires and rigging in time for the footage to be included in the final cut.|$|E
