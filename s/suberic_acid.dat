40|$|The Mediterranean diet (MD) is {{considered}} a dietary pattern with beneficial effects on human health. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the effect of an MD on urinary metabolome by comparing subjects at 1 and 3 years of follow-up, after an MD supplemented with either extra-virgin olive oil (MD + EVOO) or nuts (MD + Nuts), to those on advice to follow a control low-fat diet (LFD). Ninety-eight nondiabetic volunteers were evaluated, using metabolomic approaches, corresponding to MD + EVOO (n = 41), MD + Nuts (n = 27), or LFD (n = 30) groups. The 1 H NMR urinary profiles were examined at baseline and after 1 and 3 years of follow-up. Multivariate data analysis (OSC-PLS-DA and HCA) methods were used to identify the potential biomarker discriminating groups, exhibiting a urinary metabolome separation between MD groups against baseline and LFD. Results revealed that the most prominent hallmarks concerning MD groups were related to the metabolism of carbohydrates (3 -hydroxybutyrate, citrate, and cis-aconitate), creatine, creatinine, amino acids (proline, N-acetylglutamine, glycine, branched-chain amino acids, and derived metabolites), lipids (oleic and <b>suberic</b> <b>acids),</b> and microbial cometabolites (phenylacetylglutamine and p-cresol). Otherwise, hippurate, trimethylamine-N-oxide, histidine and derivates (methylhistidines, carnosine, and anserine), and xanthosine were predominant after LFD. The application of NMR-based metabolomics enabled the classification of individuals regarding their dietary pattern and highlights the potential of this approach for evaluating changes in the urinary metabolome at different time points of follow-up in response to specific dietary interventions...|$|R

Chemical analysis of the organic compounds was conducted using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled to electrospray ionization high-resolution mass spectrometry (ESI-HRMS) for dicarbonyls and long-chain carboxylic acids and ion chromatography for short-chain carboxylates. Long-term records of the carboxylic acids and dicarbonyls, {{as well as their}} source apportionment, are reported for western Europe. This is the first study comprising long-term trends of dicarbonyls and long-chain dicarboxylic acids (C 6 –C 12) in Alpine precipitation. Source assignment of the organic species present in the ice core was performed using principal component analysis. Our results suggest biomass burning, anthropogenic emissions, and transport of mineral dust to be the main parameters influencing the concentration of organic compounds. Ice core records of several highly correlated compounds (e. g., p -hydroxybenzoic acid, pinic <b>acid,</b> pimelic, and <b>suberic</b> <b>acids)</b> can be related to the forest fire history in southern Switzerland. P -hydroxybenzoic acid was found to be the best organic fire tracer in the study area, revealing the highest correlation with the burned area from fires. Historical records of methylglyoxal, phthalic acid, and dicarboxylic acids adipic acid, sebacic acid, and dodecanedioic acid are comparable with that of anthropogenic emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The small organic acids, oxalic acid and formic acid, are both highly correlated with calcium, suggesting their records to be affected by changing mineral dust transport to the drilling site...|$|R

40|$|Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) are {{currently}} in trial or are in clinical use {{for the treatment of}} a number of tumor types. The clinical efficacy of HDACis can be partly attributed to the modulation of the cell cycle by the HDACis. Here, we have examined the effects of N-(2 -aminophenyl) - 4 -((4 -pyridin- 3 -ylpyrimidin- 2 -ylamino) methyl) benzamide (MGCD 0103), a class I-selective histone deacetylase inhibitor, on the cell cycle and cell killing. Surprisingly, MGCD 0103 treatment failed to initiate a G(1) -phase arrest but caused marked accumulation of cells in G(2) /M at 6 and 12 h after treatment and was cytotoxic 24 h after treatment. These cell cycle effects were considerably distinct from the effects of <b>suberic</b> bishydroxamic <b>acid,</b> a representative of the pan-isoform HDACi used in this study. MGCD 0103 shared the ability of the pan-isoform HDACi to trigger defective mitosis and promote mitotic slippage. Likewise, it also specifically targeted tumor cells and was nontoxic to normal nontransformed cells. However, MGDC 0103 also seemed to disrupt normal microtubule spindle formation, whereas HDACis generally have only a minor effect on spindle formation. The effect of MGCD 0103 on spindle formation was shown to be a consequence of microtubule destabilization. This is the first example of an HDACi with microtubule destabilizing activity, and the combined effects of this drug have advantages for its therapeutic use...|$|R
30|$|The monocarboxylic acids {{are related}} to the oil {{modification}} and <b>suberic</b> and azealic <b>acid</b> are common oxidation products of a siccative oil [11, 15].

The rosin compounds identified were dehydroabietic acid (DHA), 7 -oxo DHA, and 7 -methoxy-tetradehydroabietic acid which are oxidation products of abietic acid and markers for resin of the Pine tree family (Pinaceae) [17 – 20]. The presence rosin may indicate that oil modification was performed with tall oil fatty acids (TOFA), a by-product from the paper industry which finds major use in alkyds [2, 15]. However, a direct addition of rosin to the oil modified alkyd or pigment modification can not be excluded.|$|R

The AD/GLU cocrystal was less stable than neat AD phase and the previously reported AD cocrystals with other dicarboxylic acids, such as <b>suberic</b> <b>acid</b> and succinic acid. This suggests that the intermolecular interactions of the AD/GLU cocrystal are probably weaker than the other crystal phases.

It was found that CO could be released faster and in a larger quantity when the amount of acid added to the solvent was increased while other desorption conditions were maintained unchanged. Adipic acid appeared {{to be more effective}} than phthalic, <b>suberic</b> and sebacic <b>acids</b> in enhancing solvent regeneration rate. Among the three amines investigated, MEA had the highest CO desorption rate, while DEA saved the most energy.

Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) are a class of anticancer agents that affect many cellular processes, including mitosis. Here we examine the mechanism by which these drugs disrupt mitosis. We have used Drosophila melanogaster embryos to demonstrate that treatment with the HDACi 100 mu g/ml <b>suberic</b> bishydroxamic <b>acid</b> (IC(50) 12 mu g/ml), conditions that induce extensive H 3 K 9 acetylation and aberrant mitosis in mammalian cells, induced aberrant mitosis in the absence of de novo transcription. We have examined the effect of the same treatment on the levels of H 3 K 9 modification and HP 1 binding in human cancer cells and found only minor effects on H 3 K 9 methylation and HP 1 binding. Complete loss of trimethylated H 3 K 9 or depletion of HP 1 alpha and beta had no effect on mitosis, although specific depletion of histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC 3) replicates the mitotic defects induced by the drugs without increasing H 3 K 9 acetylation. These data demonstrate that H 3 K 9 methylation and HP 1 binding are not the targets responsible for HDACi-induced aberrant mitosis, but it is a consequence of selective inhibition of HDAC 3...|$|R
40|$|Intravenous {{administration}} of dodecanedioate (or hexadecanedioate) to anaesthetized rats {{resulted in the}} urinary excretion of medium-chain dicarboxylic <b>acids</b> (adipic, <b>suberic</b> and sebacic <b>acids).</b> In control animals, the recovery of infused dodecanedioate {{in the form of}} urinary medium-chain dicarboxylic acids corresponded to 30 % of the infused dose (22 mumol/ 100 g body mass). This excretion was markedly increased in riboflavin-deficient rats (75 % of the infused dose) while it was severely decreased in clofibrate-treated animals (less than 5 %). The initial velocity of this process was similar in both control and riboflavin-deficient rats. In control animals, halving the infused dose of dodecanedioate to 11 mumol/ 100 g body mass resulted in a halving of the initial rate of the urinary appearance of medium-chain dicarboxylates, while doubling the amount of dicarboxylate administered to 44 mumol/ 100 g body mass did not further modify this velocity, but rather prolonged the duration of the excretion of the resulting products. In riboflavin-deficient and clofibrate-treated rats, the hepatic peroxisomal dicarboxylyl-CoA beta-oxidation activity measured as dicarboxylyl-CoA H 2 O 2 -generating oxidase and cyanide-insensitive dicarboxylyl-CoA-dependent NAD+ reduction was increased about threefold and tenfold, respectively. Dicarboxylyl-CoA synthetase activity was normal in the clofibrate-treated rat livers but was increased more than tenfold in the livers from the riboflavin-deficient animals. This work provides evidence that in the rat both mitochondria and peroxisomes are involved in the catabolism of dicarboxylates...|$|R

However, GA has showed limited durability including calcification, mechanical failure and toxicity. To overcome those unsolved problems, we analyzed the crosslinking differences of primary amines, GA and genipin in their mechanical and biochemical properties with a single or double crosslinking agent for clinical application. Materials and Methods: Samples were divided into 3 groups; control, single crosslinking fixation and double crosslinking fixation after decellurarization using bovine pericardium. For analysis of the biochemical and mechanical properties of each crosslinking method, tensile strength, percentage strain, thermal stability, resistance to pronase, nynhydrin and cytotoxicity test were studied. Results: Combined hexamethylene diamine and <b>suberic</b> <b>acid</b> in the carbodiimide hydrochloride/N-hydroxysucinimide solution (EDC/NHS) after decellurarization, tensile strength and strain percentage were not statistically significant compared to the single crosslinking treated groups (p> 0. 05).

In this study 9 carboxylic acids, 11 organosulfates (OSs) and 2 nitrooxy organosulfates (NOSs) were determined in daily aerosol particle filter samples from Vavihill measurement station in southern Sweden during June and July 2012. Several of the observed compounds are photo-oxidation products from biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs). Highest average mass concentrations were observed for carboxylic acids derived from fatty acids and monoterpenes (12. [*] 3 [*]±[*] 15. [*] 6 and 13. [*] 8 [*]±[*] 11. [*] 6  ng m − 3, respectively).

A principal component (PC) analysis identified four components, where the one with highest explanatory power (49  %) displayed clear impact of coniferous forest on measured mass concentration of a majority of the compounds. The three remaining PCs were more difficult to interpret, although azelaic, <b>suberic,</b> and pimelic <b>acid</b> were closely related to each other but not to any clear surface category.

Sebacate was administered either as intra-peritoneal (i. p.) bolus (six doses ranging from 10 mg to 320 mg) or as oral bolus (two doses: 80 and 160 mg). Plasma and urinary concentrations of Sb and urinary concentrations of Sb and its products of beta-oxidation (<b>suberic</b> and adipic <b>acids)</b> were measured by an improved method using gas-liquid chromatography/mass-spectrometry. A single compartment with two linear elimination routes was selected after {{no increase in}} significance was shown by an additional compartment and after a saturable mechanism {{was found to be}} unsuitable. Both renal and non-renal elimination parameters were obtained by Marquardt non linear fitting of plasma concentrations together with urinary elimination. The data reported are calculated from the analysis on the whole population of rats and referred to an average body weight (bw) of 100 g. The Sb half-time was 31. 5 min. The tissue elimination rate was 0. 0122 min- 1. The overall volume of distribution was found to be 26. 817 ml/ 100 g bw. The renal clearance was 0. 291 ml/min/ 100 g of bw, which is much less than the value of GFR reported in literature (about 1 ml/min/ 100 g bw), suggesting the presence of Sb reabsorption from the ultrafiltrate. The value of Sb renal clearance was found to be a concentration-independent function, suggesting the presence of a passive back-diffusion.

40|$|Sildenafil {{is a drug}} used {{to treat}} erectile {{dysfunction}} and pulmonary arterial hypertension. Because of poor aqueous solubility of the drug, the citrate salt, with improved solubility and pharmacokinetics, has been marketed. However, the citrate salt requires an hour to reach its peak plasma concentration. Thus, to improve solubility and bioavailability characteristics, cocrystals and salts of the drug have been prepared by treating aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with sildenafil; the N-methylated piperazine of the drug molecule interacts with the carboxyl group of the acid to form a heterosynthon. Salts are formed with oxalic and fumaric acid; salt monoanions are formed with succinic and glutaric acid. Sildenafil forms cocrystals with longer chain dicarboxylic acids such as adipic, pimelic, <b>suberic,</b> and sebacic <b>acids.</b> Auxiliary stabilization via C-H center dot center dot center dot O interactions is also present in these cocrystals and salts. Solubility experiments of sildenafil cocrystal/salts were carried out in 0. 1 N HCl aqueous medium and compared with the solubility of the citrate salt. The glutarate salt and pimelic acid cocrystal dissolve faster than the citrate salt in a two hour dissolution experiment. The glutarate salt exhibits improved solubility (3. 2 -fold) compared to the citrate salt in water. Solubilities of the binary salts follow an inverse correlation with their melting points, while the solubilities of the cocrystals follow solubilities of the coformer. Pharmacokinetic studies on rats showed that the glutarate salt exhibits doubled plasma AUC values in a single dose within an hour compared to the citrate salt. The high solubility of glutaric acid, in part originating from the strained conformation of the molecule and its high permeability, may be the reason for higher plasma levels of the drug...|$|R

40|$|L-bifunctional enzyme (Ehhadh) {{is part of}} the {{classical}} peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation pathway. This pathway is highly inducible via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha) activation. However, no specific substrates or functions for Ehhadh are known, and Ehhadh knockout (KO) mice display no appreciable changes in lipid metabolism. To investigate Ehhadh functions, we used a bioinformatics approach and found that Ehhadh expression co-varies with genes involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and in mitochondrial and peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation. Based on these findings and the regulation of Ehhadh's expression by PPAR alpha, we hypothesized that the phenotype of Ehhadh KO mice would become apparent after fasting. Ehhadh mice tolerated fasting well but displayed a marked deficiency in the fasting-induced production of the medium-chain dicarboxylic acids adipic and <b>suberic</b> <b>acid</b> and of the carnitine esters thereof. The decreased levels of adipic and <b>suberic</b> <b>acid</b> were not due to a deficient induction of omega-oxidation upon fasting, as Cyp 4 a 10 protein levels increased in wild-type and Ehhadh KO mice.

Solubility of isoniazid–carboxylic acid cocrystals tends to increase with increasing solubility of the acid...|$|E

A number of binary co-crystals were synthesised using different solvents, different stoichiometric ratios (ratio of starting materials) and different methods of synthesis (solvent-mediated crystallisation, solvent-drop grinding and neat grinding), {{with a view to}} investigate solvent and stoichiometric effects on the materials formed. Selected α,ω-alkanedicarboxylic acids (HOOC-(CH_ 2) _n-COOH) were crystallised with nicotinamide for n = 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7 and isonicotinamide for n = 5, 6, 7 yielding 12 new solid materials. The melting point of the starting materials and new products are determined and analysed, and the new crystalline materials characterised using NMR, FTIR, powder X-ray diffraction data (PXRD) and single X-ray diffraction data (SXRD). For azelaic acid : nicotinamide (1 : 1), structure solution was carried out using powder X-ray diffraction data and the direct space methods are applied through differential evolution (DE) approach. The crystal structure of adipic acid : nicotinamide (1 : 2) was solved using single crystal X-ray diffraction. The crystal structures of both, display strong O-H…. N(pyridine), O-H^…. O=C and N-H^…. O=C intermolecular bonds. Other new materials formed were oxalic acid:nicotinamide (1 : 1 and 1 : 2), malonic acid : nicotinamide (1 : 1 and 1 : 2), succinic acid : nicotinamide (1 : 1), pimelic acid : nicotinamide (1 : 1), <b>suberic</b> <b>acid</b> : nicotinamide (1 : 1), azelaic acid : nicotinamide (1 : 1), pimelic acid : isonicotinamide (1 : 1), <b>suberic</b> <b>acid</b> : isonicotinamide (1 : 1 and 1 : 2) and azelaic acid : isonicotinamide (1 : 1), but these were not fully characterised by X-diffraction...|$|E

N,N′-diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC) in 15  mL THF, and 8.47  g (46.0  mmol, 4.0  eq.) pentafluorophenol in 15  mL THF were successively added. The progress of the active ester formation was monitored using TLC (ethyl acetate/petroleum ether (55 – 65  °C) (1 / 9)). After approximately 2  h at rt, the reaction mixture was filtered, and the solvent was evaporated in vacuo. The crude product was purified via silica gel flash chromatography using an eluent mixture of ethyl acetate/petroleum ether (1 / 9). Di-pentafluorophenyl suberate (Sub(OPfp) 2) was obtained as a yellow crystalline solid.

40|$|We {{utilised}} {{a simple}} bidirectional (N→C and C→N) solid phase synthesis strategy entailing conventional solid phase peptide synthesis and fragment condensation with a water-soluble carbodiimide to synthesise a model anionic glycylglycine bolaamphiphile containing a <b>suberic</b> <b>acid</b> linker moiety, namely N,N′-suberoyldiglycylglycine. The synthetic suberoyldiglycylglycine was purified using its inherent ability to rapidly self-assemble {{in an aqueous}} acidic solution (0. 1 % trifluoroacetic acid). Monitoring of the rapid assembly process corroborated our visual observation and confirmed packing-directed self-assembly rather than non-specific aggregation or precipitation. The progress of suberoyldiglycylglycine self-assembly was observed to be via the formation of oligomers in the solution, which then self-assembled to form layered β-sheet type macrostructures. Within 24 h, nanotubes grew from these macrostructures and eventually combined to formed microtubes, which we isolated after 5 - 7 days. © 2012 European Peptide Society and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E
