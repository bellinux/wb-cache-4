Small molecule semiconductors are quite often insoluble and typically require deposition via vacuum sublimation. While usually thin films of soluble conjugated polymers. Devices based on conductive polymers can be prepared by solution processing methods. Both solution processing and vacuum based methods produce amorphous and polycrystalline films with variable degree of disorder. [...] "Wet" [...] coating techniques require polymers to be dissolved in a volatile <b>solvent,</b> <b>filtered</b> and deposited onto a substrate. Common examples of solvent-based coating techniques include drop casting, spin-coating, doctor-blading, inkjet printing and screen printing. Spin-coating is a widely used technique for small area thin film production. It {{may result in a}} high degree of material loss. The doctor-blade technique results in a minimal material loss and was primarily developed for large area thin film production. Vacuum based thermal deposition of small molecules requires evaporation of molecules from a hot source. The molecules are then transported through vacuum onto a substrate. The process of condensing these molecules on the substrate surface results in thin film formation. Wet coating techniques can in some cases be applied to small molecules depending on their solubility.|$|R

We used a 15 min high-performance liquid chromatography–diode array detection (UHPLC– DAD) –high-resolution MS method (electrospray ionization (ESI) + or ESI−), followed by 10 – 60 s of automated data analysis for up to 3000 relevant elemental compositions.

Many conventional process water treatment plants incorporate sand filters, which readily clean the water from suspended matters. However, at some circumstances the sand filters do not remove high enough concentrations of metals. This master thesis compares the water treatment abilities of activated cork, produced by Spikes & Cogs AB, to those of the sand filters used at steel making company Ovako Hofors AB in Hofors. As an on-site pilot study, the thesis investigates the cleaning capacity of three types of activated cork filters: Fats, Oils and <b>Solvents</b> (FOSS) <b>filter,</b> Fast Acting Digesting Enzymes (FADE) filter, and Metal Adsorption and Concentration (MAAC) filter. The cork filters were compared to the sand filters during normal operation and, because of previous problems with the stability of the sand filter performance, during stress tests. The results show that the cleaning capacity of the sand filters is higher than the cleaning capacity of the cork filters at normal operation. At the conditions of the stress tests, at which the sand filters do not function, the cleaning capacity of the cork filters was somewhat lowered but was still well within acceptable limits. An important result from the experiments is that the cork filters neutralize the pH. The sand filters are sensitive to changes in the pH, meaning that the cork filters could function as a buffering unit prior to the sand filters...|$|R

The oleoresin and ethanol were recovered in a round-bottom flask. The ethanol was then evaporated from the oleoresin using a rotary evaporator (Glas-Col 009 A EV 2012 S, Vol: 120 vac, 60  Hz, Amps 2). Oleoresin was further analyzed by HPLC and CPC. The oleoresin adhered flask wall during evaporation and required an additional 10  mL of solvent—either HPLC or CPC mobile phase—plus 5  min in an ultrasonic bath to release into the solution. The mixture of oleoresin and CPC <b>solvent</b> was <b>filtered</b> using a 0.45  µm syringe filter (CR 25  mm PTFE membrane filter, PALL) before further analysis by either HPLC or purification via CPC.|$|R
30|$|All {{reagents}} and solvents {{were purchased}} from commercial sources and used without further purification except otherwise specified. Peptides DOTATATE, DOTATOC, and NODAGA-JR 11 {{and the cold}} standards of their natural gallium (natGa) complexes were prepared by standard fmoc solid-phase peptide synthesis according to literature procedures (Fani et al. 2012 b; Heppeler et al. 1999). C 18 Sep-Pak cartridges (1  cm 3, 50  mg) were obtained from Waters Corporation (Milford, MA) and pre-washed with ethanol followed by deionized (DI) water prior to use. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) purification and quality control were performed on a semi-preparative column (C 18, 5  μm, 250 [*]×[*] 10  mm), or an analytical column (C 18, 5  μm, 250 [*]×[*] 4.6  mm) respectively, both purchased from Phenomenex (Torrance, CA) and used on an Agilent 1260 infinity platform (Santa Clara, CA). Triethylammonium phosphate buffer (TEAP), phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and acetonitile (MeCN) were used for HPLC elution. TEAP buffer (pH  7.3) was prepared by titrating triethylamine (8  mL) with o-phosphoric acid in DI water (1  L), and PBS (pH  7.4) was prepared by dissolving PBS powder or tablets in DI water. The pH was monitored using a Denver Instrument UltraBasic Benchtop pH meter (Bohemia, NY), and <b>solvents</b> were <b>filtered</b> using 0.2  μm filters (Whatman, GE Healthcare or Durapore, Merck Milliproe) prior to use. 68 Ga was eluted from a 50  mCi 68 Ge/ 68 Ga generator (iThemba LABS, South Africa) and purified according to reported methods (Lin et al. 2015). 67 Ga-citrate was purchased from Isologic (Burlington, Canada) and also purified following the same procedures. The activity was measured using a Capintec (Ramsey, NJ) CRC®- 25 R/W dose calibrator.|$|R
