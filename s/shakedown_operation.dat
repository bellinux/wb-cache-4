5000|$|In July 1971, James K. Polk {{began her}} first [...] at Newport News Shipbuilding in Newport News, Virginia, for nuclear {{refueling}} and conversion of her ballistic missile system {{to support the}} Poseidon C-3 ballistic missile. She completed her conversion in late 1972 and commenced a rigorous schedule of sea trials and exercises, culminating in the Demonstration and <b>Shakedown</b> <b>Operation</b> (DASO) of her Poseidon missile system, which tested her ballistic missile system and crew by requiring the launch of a Poseidon C-3 missile from the submarine.|$|E
50|$|Following her commissioning, John Adams {{completed}} sixteen deterrent patrols while {{assigned to}} the United States Atlantic Fleet After her sixteenth patrol, she entered Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington for overhaul and modernization in August 1968. She completed overhaul on 10 August 1969 and returned to sea as {{a unit of the}} United States Pacific Fleet. Both the Blue Crew and the Gold Crew shot two Polaris ballistic missiles during a Demonstration and <b>Shakedown</b> <b>Operation</b> (DASO) following the overhaul. She conducted sixteen more deterrent patrols as a unit of the Pacific Fleet.|$|E
5000|$|In the mid-1980s, Ulysses S. Grant {{underwent}} a refueling overhaul at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, in Kittery, Maine. After the overhaul period, the Blue Crew completed {{what was called}} [...] "The best DASO (Demonstration and <b>Shakedown</b> <b>Operation)</b> in 10 years," [...] which concluded with the firing of a test missile on 31 July 1987. Ulysses S. Grant then returned to Naval Submarine Base New London, Connecticut, where the Gold Crew, {{under the command of}} Commander Michael P. McBride, took Ulysses S.

[...] Vengeance then went through trials from January 2016 to June 2016 and fired an unarmed D5 missile during her Demonstration and <b>Shakedown</b> <b>Operation</b> (DASO) which allowed her to return to the fleet. Whilst the firing of the missile was a success, the missile itself suffered a failure during flight and the test was terminated.|$|E
50|$|On 23 April 1983, Lafayette {{celebrated the}} 20th anniversary of her commissioning. Although {{the ship had}} already {{completed}} Alpha and Bravo sea trials while in the shipyard, a change of command ceremony held on 20 May officially welcomed {{her back into the}} operational fleet. Both crews subsequently completed a shakedown period consisting of an Operational Reactor Safeguards Examination (ORSE), a Mk. 48 torpedo certification, a demonstration and <b>shakedown</b> <b>operation</b> and a Nuclear Weapons Acceptance Inspection. Following this, on 28 December, the Gold crew began a post-overhaul upkeep in Charleston, awaiting deployment for Patrol 52.

40|$|A {{frequency}} analysis {{was made of}} the VBWR stability test data. Interpretation of the steady-state noise observed in the stability tests involved consideration of several possible sources of excitation. One of these, a theory of water surface waves, is summarized. Visual and destructive examinations were made of selected fuel rods. Fretting corrosion of the Zircaloy-clad fuel rods against stainless steel spacers was observed. Evidence that UO/sub 2 / thermal conductivity increases with time was obtained. Hot gas isotatic pressed fuel rods failed after 316 Mwd/T irradiation and 5 months storage under water. <b>Shakedown</b> <b>operation</b> of a 7 -rod test section for measuring burnout heat flux was conducted. A comparison of measured and calculated isotopic composition for uranium and plutonium isotopes after 400 Mwd/T irradiation indicated that the calculations underestimate capture in U/sup 238 / and overestimate capture in Pu/ sup 239 /. Flux wire irradiations provided axial and radial flux profiles and the ratio of thermal to fast flux as a function of axial position. (M. C. G. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{conjunction}} with <b>shakedown,</b> <b>operation,</b> and desulfurization testing at the Morgantown Energy Technology Center (METC) 10 in. Fluid Bed Gasification and Cleanup facility, {{a series of}} tests was completed in cooperatation with Shell Synthetic Fuels, Incorporated to obtain data relevent to the design and operation of dry particulate solids filters, and Nahcolite as a chloride removal sorbent. Shell Synthetic Fuels Incorporated provided 60 mm O. D. {times} 40 mm I. D. {times} O. 5 m long silicon carbide, LayCer{trademark} 70 / 3 candle filters for use in filtering coal gas from the METC gasifier.

Details of the cooperative research and development agreement (CRADA) are found in CRADA 93 - 011. This report contains METC`s contribution to CRADA 93 - 011. Seven gasifier runs were conducted over an eighteen month period to accumulate 868 hours of operation. During this time, 3 filters were used 2 at a time to give individual candle usage of 254 hours, 525 hours, and 868 hours, respectively.
