500|$|On 30 March 2010, Alan Johnson, {{the then}} Home Secretary, {{announced}} mephedrone {{would be made}} illegal [...] "within weeks" [...] after the ACMD sent him {{a report on the}} use of cathinones. The legislation would make all cathinones illegal, which Johnson said would [...] "stop unscrupulous manufacturers and others peddling different but similarly harmful drugs". The ACMD had run into problems with the UK Government in 2009 regarding drugs policy, after the government did not follow the advice of the ACMD to reclassify ecstasy and cannabis, culminating in the dismissal of the ACMD chairman, David Nutt, after he reiterated the ACMD's findings in an academic lecture. Several members resigned after he was sacked, and prior to the announcement that mephedrone was to be banned, the trend continued when Dr Polly Taylor resigned, saying she [...] "did not have trust" [...] in the way the government would use the advice given by the ACMD. Eric Carlin, a member of the ACMD and former chairman of the English Drug Education Forum, also resigned after the announcement. He said the decision by the Home Secretary was [...] "unduly based on media and political pressure" [...] and there was [...] "little or no discussion about how our recommendation to classify this drug would be likely to impact on young people's behaviour." [...] Some former members of the ACMD and various charity groups expressed concern over the banning of the drug, arguing it would inevitably criminalise users, particularly young people. Others expressed concern that the drug would be left in the hands of black market dealers, who will only compound the problem. Carlin's resignation was specifically linked to the criminalisation of mephedrone, he stated: [...] "We need to review our entire approach to drugs, dumping the idea that legally-sanctioned punishments for drug users should constitute a main part of the armoury in helping to <b>solve</b> <b>our</b> country’s drug problems. We need to stop harming people who need help and support".|$|E

2500|$|In {{response}} {{to the events of}} June 14, representatives of Oaxaca's state regions and municipalities, unions, non-governmental organizations, social organizations, cooperatives, and parents convened to form the Popular Assembly of the Peoples of Oaxaca (APPO, from its Spanish name, Asamblea Popular de los Pueblos de Oaxaca). On June 17 APPO reestablished encampments in the zocalo and declared itself to be the governing body of Oaxaca, plunging the city into a state of civil rebellion. Barricades were constructed across some streets in an effort to prevent further police raids. [...] APPO began to seek country-wide solidarity with their movement and urged other states within Mexico to similarly organize popular assemblies at every level of social organization: neighborhoods, street blocks, unions, and towns. Various municipality offices across the state closed in unity. [...] A popular mantra was, “No leader is going to <b>solve</b> <b>our</b> problems”.|$|E

[...] "Texas can no longer wait for our federal government to <b>solve</b> <b>our</b> illegal immigration problem," [...] Friedman said. [...] "These are steps that Texas can immediately take to help stem the tide of illegal immigrants penetrating our border."
