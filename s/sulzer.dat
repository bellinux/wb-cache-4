Canucks General Manager Mike Gillis acknowledged the trade {{as an effort to}} balance his team out by trading Hodgson's skill and finesse in return for Kassian's size and toughness. Analysts from TSN and The Vancouver Sun also echoed the sentiment, commenting that while the Canucks gained elements in Kassian that were required to succeed in the playoffs, Hodgson's skill set reflected the style of play that Vancouver's success was based upon.|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{we have come to}} {{recognize}} more and more the significance of Classic theoretical sources for our understanding of the Classic style. J. Schulz definition is often recognized as the most well known. The symphony article in volume 2 was written by J. A. P. Schulz (1747 - 1800), probably in 1773 when he was twenty-six. Although the great Berlin theorist J. P. Kirnberger had been responsible for all the music articles in <b>Sulzer's</b> Theorie up to the one on "Modulation," Schulz furnished material for this and succeeding articles, becoming the sole author of all articles starting with the letter "S" {{to the end of the}} alphabet. <b>Sulzer's</b> Theorie had remarkable success. Especially striking in Schulz's definition is his enumeration of textural contrasts that include both homophonic and imitative settings, unison passages, and independent bass and middle voices. These comments underscore the great importance of textural diversification in Classic music, a still neglected trait of Classic style...|$|R
