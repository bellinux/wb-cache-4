5|$|The {{success of}} the first Spider-Man film led Dunst to reprise her role as Mary Jane Watson in 2004 in Spider-Man 2. The movie was well {{received}} by critics and a financial success, setting a new opening weekend box office record for North America. With revenue of $783million worldwide, {{it was the second}} highest-grossing film in 2004. Also in 2004, Dunst co-starred opposite Paul Bettany in the romantic comedy Wimbledon where she portrayed a rising tennis player in the Wimbledon Championships, while Bettany portrayed a fading former tennis star.

5000|$|The initial Billboard review from October 12 1963 commented Vaughan was [...] "really {{swinging}} on this album", {{and described}} it as a [...] "must for <b>Sassy's</b> fans" [...] and that there was [...] "radiation {{on both sides of the}} footlights".|$|R

[...] Another music video, filmed live at the Café de Paris was also released.|$|R

25|$|David Kronke, The Daily News of Los Angeles (April 22, 2001) — Nero Wolfe, alas, is {{undone by}} uneven {{performances}} {{and a sense}} that it's more witty and urbane than it really is. Hutton is too antic — {{he seems to be}} playing the <b>sassy</b> newsroom copy boy in a '30s B-picture — and his narration tries far too hard to push jokes that just aren't funny. Maury Chaykin, a normally reliable character actor, is alternately flat or rudderlessly blustery as Wolfe.|$|E

However, Team Dresch were active as late as 1998, The Gossip were active from 1999, Bratmobile reformed in 2000 and, perhaps most prolific of all, Sleater-Kinney were active - initially - from 1994 to 2006, releasing 7 albums.|$|E

5000|$|In its {{review on}} January 12, 1959, Time {{magazine}} called this album, [...] "An infectious musical dialogue {{between two of}} the <b>sassiest</b> fancy talkers in the business. C. & C. give slick and witty readings to a selection of retreads — 'On a Slow Boat to China', 'You Came a Long Way from St. Louis' — and introduce a punchy, potential hit named 'Calcutta'. One of the most intriguing vocal entertainments since Noel Coward had his famous chat with Mary Martin." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Scott Yanow awarded After Hours three stars {{and said that}} [...] "the {{emphasis}} throughout is exclusively on <b>Sassy's</b> magnificent voice. The program mostly sticks to ballads, {{with a couple of}} exceptions...and is a quiet and intimate affair, with Vaughan more subtle than she sometimes was. Despite a lightweight version of [...] "My Favorite Things" [...] that will not remind listeners of John Coltrane, this is an excellent if brief set (34-and-a-half minutes) with some fine jazz singing".|$|R
25|$|Around this time, she {{was criticized}} {{by members of}} the black {{community}} for the roles she accepted and for pursuing roles aggressively rather than rocking the Hollywood boat. For example, in The Little Colonel (1935), she played one of the black servants longing to return to the Old South, but her portrayal of Malena in RKO Pictures's Alice Adams angered white Southern audiences, because she stole several scenes from the film's white star, Katharine Hepburn. McDaniel ultimately became best known for playing a <b>sassy</b> and opinionated maid.|$|E
25|$|A {{prominent}} antiheroine, Ivy Slade is a <b>sassy</b> {{and intelligent}} girl {{introduced in the}} fifth novel. During the series' second arc (books 5–8), she reveals a firm hostility toward all things associated with Billings House. She {{is described as a}} match for the Billings Girls in terms of beauty and glamour. However, she is the only character known to have declined an invitation to join the dorm. Eventually, Ivy and Reed form a truce in the interests of a common goal, leading to a friendship between the two. She finally fulfills her destiny and becomes a Billings Girl later in the series, at Reed's request.|$|E
25|$|Around {{the time}} of her second divorce, she became disenchanted with Roulette Records. Roulette' {{finances}} were even more deceptive and opaque than usual in the record business and its recording artists often had little to show for their efforts other than some excellent records. When her contract with Roulette ended in 1963, Vaughan returned to the more familiar confines of Mercury Records. In the summer of 1963, Vaughan went to Denmark with producer Quincy Jones to record four days of live performances with her trio, <b>Sassy</b> Swings the Tivoli, an excellent example of her live show from this period. The following year, she made her first appearance at the White House, for President Johnson.|$|E
50|$|In Birthright, Martha is <b>sassier</b> {{and more}} {{at odds with}} her husband over how Clark should live than in {{previous}} comic incarnations. Because Jonathan {{has little to do}} with the creation of the Superman identity, Martha plays a more prominent role in this regard. She is also far more technologically savvy than ever before, communicating with Clark via encrypted e-mail as he travels around the world. In contrast, Jonathan is more withdrawn, struggling with insecurities and anger issues that stem from his treatment by his verbally abusive father, Matthew Kent.|$|R
5000|$|... "Moving on Up" [...] is an uptempo dance-pop {{and house}} song with {{elements}} of disco, and follows in the footstep of previous single [...] "One Night in Heaven" [...] although {{this time with}} much more a <b>sassier,</b> angry edge. It has a harder edge focusing {{on the end of}} a relationship from the perspective of a spurned lover. The song was recorded at The Roundhouse Studios in Chalk Farm, London. The backing vocals during the chorus is sung by vocalist Juliet Roberts who was featured prominently on the last single.|$|R
5000|$|Despite {{some initial}} outcry against another romantic {{interest}} for a companion, {{the character of}} Danny Pink and Anderson's portrayal of him were mostly positive following his first appearance. Malcolm Stewart of CultBox praised Danny for being starkly different from the characters of Rory Williams and Mickey Smith, who he claimed were [...] "defined {{in relation to their}} girlfriends and... kept on a leash by their better <b>sassier</b> halves", and commented that, unlike them, Danny did not feel [...] "emasculated" [...] and was a more [...] "straightforward, unassuming proposition".|$|R
