40|$|Background and Aim: Pertussis {{vaccination}} in {{this country}} {{has been going on for}} many years and active infection or vaccination will provide immunity in 85 % of cases. However, every 2 - 5 years outbreaks in unprotected adults creates an epidemy for children and infants. Based on conserved genomic <b>sequences,</b> <b>Real</b> <b>time</b> PCR could be an easy, cost- benefit, fast and highly sensitive method for pertussis detection. Materials and Methods: A total of 170 nasopharyngeal swabs of infants with history of cough for more than 2 weeks were collected. In the first stage, Bordetella pertussis bacteria detection was performed by culture and followed by <b>Real</b> <b>time</b> PCR using a commercial kit and then repeated with newly designed primers.

40|$|The {{proposed}} {{system is}} named Image Talk: a realtime synthetic talking head using one single image with Chinese text-to-speech capability. Image Talk uses one single image to automatically create video-like talking <b>sequences</b> in <b>real</b> <b>time.</b> The image can be acquired from photographs, video clips, or hand drawn characters. This interactive system accepts Chinese text input and talks back in Mandarin Chinese, generating facial expression in <b>real</b> <b>time.</b> Image Talk analyzes Chinese text by converting it {{to a standard}} Pinyin system used in Taiwan and fetches the associated facial expressions from an expression pool dynamically. The expressions are synchronized with the synthetic speech and played back in the video-like talking <b>sequence</b> in <b>real</b> <b>time.</b> Image Talk also incorporates eye blinking, small-scale head rotation and translation perturbations, to make the results more natural. The generic Talk Mask is also easy to switch to any other facial or non-facial images, such as dogs, for special effects.

As we have seen, the GPU 3 D-DWT algorithm obtains good speed-ups, up to 16 in the GT 540 M platform and up to 39 in the GTX 280. Using these optimizations, the proposed encoder (3 D-LTW) is a very fast encoder, specially for Full-HD video resolutions, being able to compress a Full-HD video <b>sequence</b> in <b>real</b> <b>time.</b>|$|R

40|$|MicroRNAs {{comprise}} {{a family of}} small non-coding RNAs that modulate several developmental and physiological processes including pregnancy. Their ubiquitous presence is confirmed in mammals, worms, flies and plants. Although rapid advances {{have been made in}} microRNA research, information on stable reference genes for validation of microRNA expression is still lacking. <b>Real</b> <b>time</b> PCR is a widely used tool to quantify gene transcripts. An appropriate reference gene must be chosen to minimize experimental error in this system. A small difference in miRNA levels between experimental samples can be biologically meaningful as these entities can affect multiple targets in a pathway. This study examined the suitability of six commercially available reference genes (RNU 1 A, RNU 5 A, RNU 6 B, SNORD 25, SCARNA 17, and SNORA 73 A) in maternal-fetal tissues from healthy and spontaneously arresting/dying conceptuses from sows were separately analyzed at gestation day 20. Comparisons were also made with non-pregnant endometrial tissues from sows. Spontaneous fetal loss is a prime concern to the commercial pork industry. Our laboratory has previously identified deficits in vasculature development at maternal-fetal interface as one of the major participating causes of fetal loss. Using this well-established model, we have extended our studies to identify suitable microRNA reference genes. A methodical approach to assessing suitability was adopted using standard curve and melting curve analysis, PCR product <b>sequencing,</b> <b>real</b> <b>time</b> PCR expression in a panel of gestational tissues, and geNorm and NormFinder analysis.
