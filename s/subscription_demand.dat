40|$|The paper {{determines the}} effects of {{different}} influencing variables on the media company’s optimal subscription and advertising prices and editorial content. The company maximizes profit consisting of subscription and advertising revenue, minus the costs of content, advertising, and circulation, by setting the subscription and advertising prices {{and the amount of}} editorial content. <b>Subscription</b> <b>demand</b> {{is a function of the}} subscription price, the media’s editorial content, and advertising, and advertising demand a function of the advertising price and circulation. The condition for the circulation spiral to be finite is derived. It is shown that an increase in a variable or a parameter (e. g. circulation demand) causes the respective price to increase only if the demand for the other product (advertising) is elastic enough, the price declining if the other product’s demand is less elastic. Moreover, the increase leads to an increase in editorial content if advertising demand is elastic, and to a decrease in the advertising price. An increase in advertising demand leads to an increase in the advertising price if <b>subscription</b> <b>demand</b> is elastic enough, and to a decrease in the subscription price and editorial content. An increase in the marginal effect of editorial content on subscriptions leads to an increase in editorial content without affecting the prices...|$|E

Externalities arise when firms discriminate between on- and off-net calls or when <b>subscription</b> <b>demand</b> is elastic. This literature predicts that profit decreases and consumer surplus increases when termination charges increase. This is puzzling since in reality regulators are pushing termination rates down while being opposed to do so by network operators.

40|$|Previous research, {{assuming}} linear pricing, {{has argued}} that telecommunications networks may use a high access charge {{as an instrument of}} collusion. I show that this conclusion is difficult to maintain when operators compete in nonlinear pricing: (i) As long as <b>subscription</b> <b>demand</b> is inelastic, profits can remain independent of the access charge, even when customers are heterogeneous and networks engage in second-degree price discrimination. (ii) When demand for subscriptions is elastic, networks may increase profits by agreeing on an access charge below marginal cost (relative to cost-based access pricing). Welfare is typically increased by setting the access charge above marginal cost. 1...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} optimal {{sampling and}} pricing of paid content for publishers of news websites. Publishers offer free content samples both to disclose journalistic quality to consumers and to generate online advertising revenues. We examine sampling where the publisher sets {{the number of}} free sample articles and consumers select the articles of their choice. Consumerslearn from the free samples in a Bayesian fashion and base their subscription decisions on posterior quality expectations. We show thatsampling enhances <b>subscription</b> <b>demand</b> only if consumers have low quality expectations in relation to actual quality. Taking advertising and subscription revenues into account, {{we find that the}} publisher should employ either a paid-only or a free content strategy when consumers have high quality expectations. When consumers have low quality expectations, employing a sampling strategy may be optimal for the publisher...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} how access pricing affects network {{competition}} when <b>subscription</b> <b>demand</b> is elastic and each network uses non-linear prices and can apply termination-based price discrimination. In {{the case of}} a fixed per minute termination charge, we find that a reduction of the termination charge below cost has two oppos- ing effects: it softens competition but helps to internalize network externalities. The former reduces mobile penetration while the latter boosts it. We find that firms al- ways prefer termination charge below cost for either motive while the regulator prefers termination below cost only when this boosts penetration. Next, we consider the retail benchmarking approach (Jeon and Hurkens, 2008) that determines termination charges as a function of retail prices and show that this approach allows the regulator to increase penetration without distorting call volumes.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the problem of allocating fixed {{resources}} between two types of demands; (a) spot demand; and (b) package (<b>subscription)</b> <b>demand</b> [...] -demand that is satisfied by selling usage rights over a prespecified time period prior to actual consumption. In Model 1, a probabilistic spot demand for a single resource, stationary over time, is assumed together with externally determined spot and package pricing. It is shown that the optimal (profit maximizing) policy is to sell all the packages in the first period and the optimal number of packages to offer is derived. Model 1 is extended to the case when the package offers rights to any one of a number M of resources at a given time; similar conclusions are obtained. In Model 2, package price {{is considered to be a}} decision variable. It is shown that the optimal price should be monotonically nondecreasing over time, implying that the number of packages offered for sale each period will not increase over time. Finally, managerial uses of the proposed models for entertainment, leisure and tourist services are reviewed. marketing, marketing: pricing...|$|E
40|$|Prior Hong Kong-based {{studies have}} dealt {{predominantly}} with Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) configured in a single-tranche offer form (see McGuinness (1992); Cheng et al. (2004); Fung et al. (2004); Vong (2006) {{for the main}} board; and Vong and Zhao (2008) for the Growth Enterprise Market (GEM)). This study revisits the issue by examining a recent set of IPOs utlizing a dual-tranche offer form, in which a local retail offer {{is accompanied by a}} book-built placing. This mechanism utilizes a number of features ('claw-backs', adjustable offer prices and over-allotment options) which allow for important supply and demand adjustments during the offer period. The absence of such features within the single-tranche offer form, which prevailed right up {{to the end of the}} 1990 s, suggests radically different pricing characteristics across single- and dual-tranche regimes. Assessment is first made of ex-ante type variables, constructed using publicly available data prior to the close in retail applications. Average retail subscription rates on issues immediately prior to a given offering, the clustering of IPOs and the performance of the overall Hong Kong secondary market in the period surrounding the retail application window all serve as significant factors in explaining both IPO returns and excess <b>subscription</b> <b>demand.</b> Mainland PRC-incorporation (H-share issuers), advising sponsorship quality, an issuer's propensity to disclose a forecast of earnings and price-to-earnings levels also appear significant. In terms of ex-post variables, both IPO underpricing and <b>subscription</b> <b>demand</b> were positively related to over-allotment option exercise and the SD of post-listing returns. Significantly, there is no evidence to support the notion that the incidence and/or size of subsequent seasoned equity issues helps to promote IPO underpricing. This is investigated by examining equity capital-raising activities over a 36 -month post-listing period. Given the mixed evidence to date (across markets and studies) on this issue, the results documented in this study provide an additional important data point to suggest that seasoned equity issuance is of second-order importance in relation to IPO underpricing. Finally, a measurement form for excess demand was also developed to reflect the idiosyncratic nature of the dual-tranche allotment mechanism. Subscription numbers were evaluated in relation to retail tranche supply adjustments, arising from 'claw-backs' and employee share allotments. Consistent with Vong's (2006) earlier work on simple IPO subscription rates, after-market volatility appeared much more strongly tied to excess demand than to initial return levels. A number of analogues of excess demand, notably over-allotment option exercise and the proportion of shares allotted to retail applicants subscribing at the minimum order level, were significant in explaining initial returns. Finally, and consistent with Hanley (1993), higher initial return levels were apparent in issues priced towards the upper end of the offer price range. ...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{will conduct}} an {{analysis}} from an empirical perspective concerning broadcasting demand behavior and characteristics. More concretely, we will assume three options (subscription patterns), namely, nonsubscription, cable TV subscription, and subscription to broadcasting services via communications satellites (CS), {{and we will}} conduct an analysis of broadcasting service demand behavior using a discrete choice model. According to our result, price elasticity is low for cable TV and CS subscribers, which is a contrast to the United States, where price elasticity for paid broadcasting is high. It shows that factors other than price {{continue to have a}} strong influence on demand behavior (subscription choices) in the Japanese market for regular and paid broadcasting (the multichannel market) and that the market has not yet entered the phase of price competition between cable TV and CS broadcasting. With regard to channel number elasticity, the figures are high for basic channel service and low for special channel services. This indicates that basic services are an important concern for viewers. This suggests that, in line with reports that the spread of cable TV in the United States was promoted by difficulty in receiving terrestrial broadcasts, basic channel services may be more important than special channels as keys to the spread of paid broadcasting in Japan. <b>Subscription</b> <b>demand,</b> Broadcasting service, Pay-TV, Discrete choice model, Price/Channel elasticity...|$|E
