We nd that extreme media outlets do not in uence polit-ical outcomes, and that new entry always increases the chance that political parties adopt the policy favored by the median voter. A slightly partisan media outlet, which is trusted by the <b>supporters</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>party,</b> is more eective than a completely cen-trist one in inducing the party to adopt less partisan policies. In a commercial media market, voter welfare is typically higher under duopoly than under monopoly. JEL classication. D 72, L 8...|$|E
40|$|Historically, the {{emergence}} of mass politics has depended upon a minimum of social heterogeneity (LaPalombara and Weiner 1966; Dahl 1966; Lipset and Rokkan 1967). Religious, economic, ethnic, linguistic, and regional differences provided social cleavages along which organizations, especially political ones, developed. The number, salience and centrality, and political significance of the cleavages varied among societies but the existence of differences, their expression as groups within the larger society, and their politicization are virtual constants. In all mass democracies, not excluding the United States, parties are instruments of collective action through which groups promote and protect interests which are not satisfied by the usual operation of the social structure and markets. As a result, groups provide the working politician with {{a guide to the}} elec- torate, and it is the rare one who deals with it in any other fashion. The variety of groups with which parties and office-seekers must deal varies greatly among societies. In some cases the lines of cleavage are few and, relatively speaking, simple: parties coincide with a few groups, and sometimes only one. In other cases, <b>supporters</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>party</b> are religiously, ethnically, racially, linguis- tically, and class heterogeneous; no group, however defined, represents more than a fraction of a party's supporters (Rose and Urwin 1969). Whether their base is heterogeneous or homogeneous, politicians reinforce it through their appeals to the electorate. The heterogeneity of a party's support is, however, an important variable. Parties with a homogeneous clientele present a homogeneous programmatic face to the electorate because, ceteris paribus, the interests and concerns of their supporters are more focused. Heterogeneous par- ties, by contrast, enjoy agreement on a smaller number of issues because, again, ceteris paribus, the social and economic differences which divide their supporters also promote inconsistent issue agendas among them. The apparent programmatic vagueness of the American parties reflects the diversity of their coalitions. Southern California is an appropriate observatory for the study of party coalitions because it offers an opportunity to examine further some political con- sequences of social heterogeneity. Two issues are examined in this paper. First, how is the social diversity of the electorate represented in the parties? Do the parties mobilize groups different from those in the national parties? Do the "new" ethnics have a particular impact on the coalitions? Second, how do the local parties represent the policy agendas of the groups that constitute their support base...|$|E
40|$|Particular {{perspectives}} {{influence how}} individuals think about politics. But how do members and <b>supporters</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single <b>party</b> create <b>a</b> collective perception <b>of</b> its ethos – what {{it stands for}} and where its future lies? Karl Pike examines these concepts {{in relation to the}} Labour Party, and explains how ethos can affect political direction...|$|R
5000|$|It {{was founded}} in February 2008 as <b>a</b> {{continuation}} <b>of</b> the [...] "Liberal Clubs" [...] and of the Liberal-Popular Union by some members of Forza Italia who decided to switch to UDC because of {{their opposition to the}} foundation of The People of Freedom or, at least, in the way traced by Silvio Berlusconi. In fact Adornato was once the keenest <b>supporter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new <b>party</b> <b>of</b> the centre-right.|$|R
50|$|After {{the events}} of August 19-21, 1991, Tyulkin became <b>an</b> {{initiator}} <b>of</b> the convocation of Russian communists. This established him as <b>supporter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> working <b>party</b> (РКРП) in Ekaterinburg (November 1991). At the congress {{he was elected to}} the central committee of RCWP and came to Оргбюро ЦК. He was one of four secretaries to the organization bureau. He achieved registration <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>party</b> (set) in the Ministry of Justice. In 1993, Tyulkin was elected to the First secretary ЦК РКРП.|$|R
5000|$|The Amnesty International {{has called}} upon the Bangladesh {{government}} for giving better protection to the minority Hindus in the country. In a 6 March report, titled 'Bangladesh: Wave of Violent Attacks Against Hindu Minority’, the Amnesty said {{as many as}} 40 Hindu temples were vandalised in attacks by <b>supporters</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Islamic <b>party.</b> Several hundred were rendered homeless as shops and houses belonging to the Hindu community were burnt down over the past week, it said. The report gave Bangladesh's war crimes trial as the [...] "context" [...] to the violence against the Hindus.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> group <b>of</b> {{republicans}} had founded <b>a</b> <b>party,</b> Saor Éire, in 1931, {{but it was}} banned later in the year. Despite this, many figures on the left wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) felt that the creation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new <b>party</b> remained <b>a</b> priority, as they feared that supporters would otherwise turn to Fianna Fáil and the Communist Party of Ireland. The IRA organised <b>a</b> convention <b>of</b> its members in March 1934, which voted against creating <b>a</b> new <b>party</b> by <b>a</b> majority <b>of</b> one. The <b>supporters</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new <b>party,</b> including Ryan, Michael Price, Gilmore, O'Donnell and Mick Fitzgerald, then walked out, and proceeded {{to create a new}} organisation.|$|R
2500|$|Where {{preferential}} {{voting is}} used for the election <b>of</b> <b>an</b> assembly or council, parties and candidates often advise their supporters on their lower preferences, especially in Australia where a voter must rank all candidates to cast a valid ballot. This can lead to [...] "preference deals", <b>a</b> form <b>of</b> pre-election bargaining, in which smaller parties agree to direct their voters in return for support from the winning party on issues critical to the small party. However, this relies on the assumption that <b>supporters</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> minor <b>party</b> will mark preferences for another party based on the advice that they have been given.|$|R
50|$|The Shakman decrees were <b>a</b> series <b>of</b> Federal {{court orders}} {{regarding}} government employment in Chicago, which were issued in 1972, 1979, and 1983, {{in response to}} a lawsuit filed by civic reformer Michael Shakman. The decrees barred the practice of political patronage, under which government jobs are given to <b>supporters</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> politician or <b>party,</b> and government employees may be fired for not supporting a favored candidate or party.|$|R
50|$|As {{sound systems}} {{continued}} to gain in popularity through the 1960s and 1970s, they became politicized in many instances. Many sound systems, and their owners, were labeled as <b>supporters</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> particular political <b>party</b> (such as the PNP or the JLP), {{but most of}} the sound systems tried to maintain political neutrality. Nevertheless, as a cultural and economic phenomenon, the sound system was affected by the vast socio-political changes taking place in Jamaica at this time.|$|R
50|$|In {{his youth}} he was <b>a</b> <b>supporter</b> <b>of</b> O Trabalho, <b>a</b> <b>party</b> {{linked to the}} French Organisation Communiste Internationaliste (OCI). He broke with this {{international}} current {{to work closely with}} Lula in the PT. He worked at Banespa bank and was associated with unions. He was elected a federal deputy in the Congress three times, from 1987 to 1998, and was the coordinator of the presidential campaigns for Lula in 1989 and 1998.|$|R
2500|$|On 11 April 2007, {{the police}} filed murder charges against Hasina, alleging that she masterminded the killing in October 2006 <b>of</b> four <b>supporters</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> rival {{political}} <b>party.</b> The four alleged victims were {{beaten to death}} during clashes between the Awami League and rival party activists. Deputy police commissioner, Shahidul Haq Bhuiyan, said [...] "detective branch police submitted the charge-sheet of the case to a Dhaka court today after carrying out investigations and taking evidence". Hasina was visiting the United States at the time.|$|R
50|$|The North Wexford by-election, 1892 was a {{parliamentary}} by-election {{held for the}} United Kingdom House of Commons constituency of North Wexford on 11 March 1892. The vacancy arose because of {{the resignation of the}} sitting member, John Redmond of the Irish Parliamentary Party, in order to contest the seat of Cork City, following the death of its MP, Charles Stewart Parnell; Redmond, as <b>a</b> <b>supporter</b> <b>of</b> Parnell following <b>a</b> <b>party</b> split, was chosen to run as representative of the Parnellite faction.|$|R
5000|$|Violence or {{the threat}} of violence: In its {{simplest}} form, voters from a particular demographic or known to support <b>a</b> particular <b>party</b> or candidate are directly threatened by <b>supporters</b> <b>of</b> another party or candidate or by those hired by them. In other cases, <b>supporters</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> particular <b>party</b> make it known that if a particular village or neighborhood is found to have voted the 'wrong' way, reprisals will be made against that community. Another method is to make <b>a</b> general threat <b>of</b> violence, for example a bomb threat which has the effect <b>of</b> closing <b>a</b> particular polling place, thus {{making it difficult for}} people in that area to vote. [...] One notable example of outright violence was the 1984 Rajneeshee bioterror attack, where followers of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh deliberately contaminated salad bars in The Dalles, Oregon, in an attempt to weaken political opposition during county elections.|$|R
30|$|It is {{easy for}} the rabble-rousing parties to prey on discontent, fear, and lack of {{understanding}} of the complicated EU processes to turn people against the EU as a whole, their national leaders, and against anyone who is different and who may be seen as taking part of the pie to which they believe they should have exclusive rights. These voters are generally not committed <b>supporters</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> populist <b>party,</b> but they make up the majority of the parties’ electoral support. Research has shown that the profile of these voters changes from country to country, but the overall commonality, more than age, gender, or unemployment, is <b>a</b> lower level <b>of</b> education [47]. Early-school leavers, also one of the largest portions of unemployed youth in Europe, may be especially receptive to populist messaging [23], and the lack of investment in education across Europe is directly contributing to the electoral prospects of populists.|$|R

50|$|In 2009 Guadagnini {{stood as}} UDC {{candidate}} for the European Parliament, {{but he was not}} elected. Increasingly marginalized within his party, he started to be interested in Venetian nationalism. Within the DC and the UDC, Guadagnini had been <b>an</b> ardent <b>supporter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Venetian centre-right <b>party,</b> independent from Rome, so it was a logical choice for him to join Liga Veneto Autonomo (LVA) first and, finally, Veneto State (VS). Guadagnini was soon chosen as the party's candidate for President of the Province of Treviso in the 2011 provincial election. In the election he won just 1.5% of the vote and did better {{in the eastern part of}} the province (traditionally <b>a</b> stronghold <b>of</b> Liga Veneta-Lega Nord), and especially in Crespano del Grappa (8.9%), Paderno del Grappa (5.2%), Fonte (4.9%) and Borso del Grappa (3.6%).|$|R
5000|$|Puntervold placed {{himself on}} {{the right wing of}} the party, which held control of the party by and large until 1918. In 1920 he was more or less denounced by Edvard Bull, Sr. who wrote in Det 20de Aarhundre of [...] "right-wing {{socialism}} and puntervoldery". When the Labour Party split in 1921, Puntervold joined the more right-wing Social Democratic Labour <b>Party,</b> and became <b>a</b> leading figure in this party. Writing in Arbeider-Politikken, he was <b>a</b> part <b>of</b> the early <b>supporters</b> <b>of</b> such <b>a</b> new <b>party.</b> He was also chairman of Arbeider-Politikken, which became the official party newspaper, from 1920 to 1927. He took part at the founding congress of the Labour and Socialist International in 1923; the other Norwegian delegates were Magnus Nilssen, Arne Magnussen and Olav Kringen.|$|R
40|$|We analyze {{a simple}} opinion {{formation}} model consisting <b>of</b> two <b>parties,</b> <b>A</b> and B, and <b>a</b> group I, <b>of</b> undecided agents. We {{assume that the}} <b>supporters</b> <b>of</b> <b>parties</b> <b>A</b> and B do not interact among them, but only interact through the group I, {{and that there is}} <b>a</b> nonzero probability <b>of</b> <b>a</b> spontaneous change <b>of</b> opinion (<b>A</b> I, B I). From the master equation, and via van Kampen's Ω-expansion approach, we have obtained the “macroscopic” evolution equation, as well as the Fokker-Planck equation governing the fluctuations around the deterministic behavior. Within the same approach, we have also obtained information about the typical relaxation behavior of small perturbations.

40|$|In this article, {{we report}} the results <b>of</b> <b>an</b> e-democracy {{experiment}} in which <b>a</b> group <b>of</b> <b>supporters</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large political <b>party</b> {{were asked to}} debate online about ways to reform the electoral law. We compare a traditional forum with an online collaborative argumentation platform to capture the various proposals and their associated pros and cons. The {{aim of this study}} is to assess the capability of this tool to support online collective deliberation in a real-world case, as compared to an online discussion supported by a forum. By comparing users’ experience across several metrics related to usability, activity levels, and quality of collaboration, our findings show that the forum produced more activity and ideas and its users perceived <b>a</b> better quality <b>of</b> the collaboration process, while the argumentation tool helped to reduce the amount of self-referential arguments and encourage viewing and rating of others’ posts...|$|R
50|$|Finding it {{difficult}} to re-establish himself in the British political system and due to economic issues caused by {{a decrease in the}} performance of his plantations on the Leeward Islands, he switched allegiances to become <b>a</b> <b>supporter</b> <b>of</b> Pitt, throwing <b>a</b> <b>party</b> at his house on 15 August 1793 at which the Prime Minister, Pitt, was present. It was due to this switch of allegiance that he became Baron Lavington in the peerage of Ireland on 1 October 1795. Payne was also elected as MP for New Woodstock in October 1795, retaining this seat until 1799. He did not vote on the abolition of the slave trade during this his fourth tenure as an MP. This was likely due to his own need for the continuation of the slave trade in order that his plantations on the Leeward Islands did not cause him further economic issues.|$|R
50|$|As the PSDMR had disbanded in 1899 in the {{aftermath}} of the defection of several of its leaders to the National Liberal Party (PNL), Wexler was one <b>of</b> the <b>supporters</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> renewed socialist <b>party.</b> Thus, between 1899 and 1900, became a regular writer for Lumea Nouă, by then edited by <b>a</b> group <b>of</b> mostly proletarian socialists. Towards the same objective, in August 1903 he established the Iaşi Circle of Social Studies, of which he was one of the foremost lecturers, with the support of Dr. Ghelerter. Many of the students attending the Circle would later become leading figures of the Romanian socialist movement: Mihail Gheorghiu Bujor, Ion Sion, Ottoi Călin, Ilie Moscovici. Wexler's lecture topics included party tactics, the Erfurt Program, the history of Christianity and the Jewish question. During the Circle sessions he exposed A. C. Cuza's PhD thesis as a plagiarism, with many of the arguments being later presented in a book published by another member of the Circle, Emanoil Socor. Active in the Socialist Union of Romania, established in 1907, he was elected during its January 1908 conference a member in the commission tasked with revising the political program of the organization. The commission also included Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea, Christian Rakovsky, Mihail Gh. Bujor, N. D. Cocea and Ion Sion. Beginning with the refoundation of the Social Democratic Party (PSD) in 1910, Wexler was to become one of the main leaders of its Iaşi section. In 1914, together with Dr. Ghelerter, he rented a building in Iaşi that would serve during the following years both as their home and the headquarters of the local Social-Democratic Club and Trade Union Commission.|$|R
