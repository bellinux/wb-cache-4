25|$|A {{number of}} studies have found that SWB {{constructs}} are strongly associated with a range of personality traits, including those in the five factor model. Findings from numerous personality studies show that genetics account for 20-48% of the variance in Five-Factor Model and the variance in subjective well-being is also heritable. Specifically, neuroticism predicts poorer subjective well-being whilst extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness and openness to experience tend to predict higher subjective well-being. A meta-analysis found that neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness were <b>significantly</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> all facets of SWB examined (positive, negative, and overall affect; happiness; life satisfaction; and quality of life). Neuroticism was the strongest predictor of overall SWB and is the strongest predictor of negative affect.|$|E
25|$|Some {{forms of}} sexual violence, such as gang rape, are {{predominantly}} committed by young men. Sexual aggression {{is often a}} defining characteristic of manhood in the group and is <b>significantly</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the wish {{to be held in}} high esteem. Sexually aggressive behavior among young men has been linked with gang membership and having delinquent peers. Research also suggests that men with sexually aggressive peers are also much more likely to report coercive or enforced intercourse outside the gang context than men lacking sexually aggressive peers. Gang rape is often viewed by the men involved, and sometimes by others too, as legitimate, in that it is seen to discourage or punish perceived immoral behavior among women, such as wearing short skirts or frequenting bars.|$|E

There remain, however, many differences of opinion over whether other films of the era, among them a number of well-known ones, qualify as film noirs or not. For instance, The Night of the Hunter (1955), starring Robert Mitchum in an acclaimed performance, is treated as a film noir by some critics, but not by others. Some critics include Suspicion (1941), directed by Alfred Hitchcock, in their catalogues of noir; others ignore it.

500|$|In 2015 {{researchers}} Limb, Limb, Limb and Limb {{published a}} paper on their study into the effect of surnames on medical specialisation. They looked at 313,445 entries in the medical register from the General Medical Council, and identified surnames that were apt for the speciality, for example, Limb for an orthopaedic surgeon, and Doctor for medicine in general. They found that the frequency of names relevant to medicine and to subspecialties was much greater than expected by chance. Specialties that had the largest proportion of names specifically relevant to that specialty were those for which the English language has provided {{a wide range of}} alternative terms for the same anatomical parts (or functions thereof). Specifically, these were genitourinary medicine (e.g., Hardwick and Woodcock) and urology (e.g., Burns, Cox, Ball). Neurologists had names relevant to medicine in general, but far fewer had names directly relevant to their specialty (1 in every 302). Limb, Limb, Limb and Limb did not report on looking for any confounding variables. In 2010 Abel came to a similar conclusion. In one study he compared doctors and lawyers whose first or last names began with three-letter combinations representative of their professions, for example, [...] "doc", [...] "law", and likewise found a significant relationship between name and profession. Abel also found that the initial letters of physicians' last names were <b>significantly</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> their subspecialty. For example, Raymonds {{were more likely to be}} radiologists than dermatologists.

40|$|Background: Mounting {{clinical}} and experimental {{evidence suggests that}} the shift of carcinomas towards a mesenchymal phenotype is a common paradigm for both resistance to therapy and tumor recurrence. However, the mesenchymalization of carcinomas has not yet entered clinical practice as a crucial diagnostic paradigm. Methodology/Principal Findings: By integrating in silico and in vitro studies with our epithelial and mesenchymal tumor models, we compare herein crucial molecular pathways of previously described carcinoma-derived mesenchymal tumor cells (A 17) with that of both carcinomas and other mesenchymal phenotypes, such as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), breast stroma, and various types of sarcomas. We identified three mesenchymal/stromal-signatures which A 17 cells shares with MSCs and breast stroma. By using a recently developed computational approach with publicly available microarray data, we show that these signatures: 1) <b>significantly</b> <b>relates</b> <b>to</b> basal-like breast cancer subtypes; 2) <b>significantly</b> <b>relates</b> <b>to</b> bone metastasis; 3) are up-regulated after hormonal treatment; 4) predict resistance to neoadjuvant therapies.

40|$|Thesis (M. A. (Industrial Psychology)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007 Emotional {{intelligence}} {{is a growing}} area of behavioural research; it recently grabbed the attention {{of some of the}} major organisations worldwide. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the relationship between wellness and emotional intelligence in order to develop a structural model of psychological well-being. The following constructs were looked at, Optimism, Sense of Coherence, Life Satisfaction, Emotional Intelligence are all seen as good indicators of Psychological well-being. A cross-sectional design was used for this study. The participants (N= 324) were students within the field of economic science. The Schutte Emotional Intelligence Scale, the Life Orientation Test Revised, the Satisfaction with Life Scale and the Orientation to Life scale were administered. Using a principal component analysis, a six-dimension factor structure for emotional intelligence among students emerged, explaining 45, 24 % of the variance. These factors were labelled positive affect, emotions-others, happy emotions, emotions-own, nonverbal emotions and emotional control. The most significant correlations found in this study was that Sense of Coherence is <b>significantly</b> positively <b>related</b> <b>to</b> Emotions Management and Life Satisfaction and <b>significantly</b> positively <b>related</b> <b>to</b> Emotions-Own, Happy Emotions, Positive Affect and Optimism. Sense of Coherence was negatively <b>related</b> <b>to</b> Pessimism. Emotions Management is <b>significantly</b> positively <b>related</b> <b>to</b> Emotions-Own, Happy Emotions, Positive Affect, Optimism and Life Satisfaction. Positive affect is <b>significantly</b> positively <b>related</b> <b>to</b> Optimism. Pessimism is <b>significantly</b> negatively <b>related</b> <b>to</b> Life Satisfaction. Optimism is <b>significantly</b> positively <b>related</b> <b>to</b> Life Satisfaction. After conducting a second factor analysis on the factors of the SEIS, LOT-R, SOC and SWLS, two factors were extracted, namely interpersonal and intrapersonal mastery. Using these factors, along with the results of the product-moment correlations, a psychological well-being model was designed and compiled. The results showed that Interpersonal mastery consisted of Positive Affect, Emotional Management, Sense of Coherence, Life Satisfaction and Optimism. Intrapersonal mastery consisted of Emotions-Others, Emotions-Own, Happy Emotions and Non-Verbal Emotions. It is evident from the above that the psychological well-being model consisted of intrapersonal mastery and environmental mastery. Recommendations for future research were made. Master...|$|R

2500|$|In {{personality}} psychology, {{researchers have}} generally {{agreed on a}} five-factor model of personality. The five factors are extraversion (i.e. social, outgoing), agreeableness (i.e. trusting, helpful), neuroticism (i.e. worried, anxious), openness to experience (i.e. imaginative, creative), and conscientiousness (i.e. organized, careful). [...] Nature relatedness (overall) is <b>significantly</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness to experience. In addition, a subscale of nature relatedness (nature relatedness-experience) is negatively related with neuroticism. These authors describe the nature relatedness person {{as someone who is}} more adventurous, easy going, and gregarious. It may also be that highly nature related people are more environmental friendly because of the positive (albeit weak) relationship with conscientiousness. Evidence suggests that people vary in their subjective sense of connectedness with nature much like any of the five factors listed above. Supportive of these results, a recent study has found that environmental engagement (protecting the environment, electricity conservation and environmental values) is related to agreeableness, conscientiousness and openness to experience. Another study found that nature connectedness accounted for (mediated) the relationship between openness and pro-environmental behaviours.|$|E

However, thus far, {{there has been an}} absence of literature with respect to the relationship between the Five Factor Model OCEAN personality dimensions and perceptions of parent behavior as outlined in the parent development theory (PDT). The {{purpose of this study is}} to build upon previous research by using the PDT and the OCEAN personality trait theory. The aim is to examine how OCEAN personality domains (i. e., openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism) <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> parental views regarding the value of positive parenting characteristics (i. e., bonding, discipline, education, general welfare and protection, responsivity, sensitivity) and negative parenting characteristics. In addition, demographic information such as age, gender, and ethnicity is considered to further inform the relationship between personality and perceptions of parenting behavior. ^ Findings reveal a significant positive relationship between most OCEAN personality characteristics and parent behavior importance perceptions. Notably, agreeableness had a significant positive correlation with all positive parenting characteristics, while extraversion and neuroticism did not <b>significantly</b> <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> any of the parenting characteristics except when parent gender was considered. Additionally, conscientiousness and openness were <b>significantly</b> positively <b>related</b> <b>to</b> all positive parenting characteristics other than discipline. Furthermore, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness <b>significantly</b> positively <b>related</b> with the positive parenting index, while extraversion and neuroticism did not.
