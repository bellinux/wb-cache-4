5|$|The growing {{popularity}} of worship of a more benign form of Kaali, as Daksinakali, is often attributed to Krishnananda Agamavagisha. He was a noted Bengali leader of the 17th century, author of a Tantra encyclopedia called Tantrasara. According to hearsay - Kaali appeared {{to him in a}} dream and told him to popularize her in a particular form that would appear to him the following day. The next morning he observed a young woman making cow dung patties. While placing a patty on a wall, <b>she</b> <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> alidha pose, with her right foot forward. When she saw Krishnananda watching her, she was embarrassed and put her tongue between her teeth. Krishnananada took his previous worship of Kali out of the cremation grounds and into a more domestic setting. Krishnananda Vagamavagisha was also the guru of the Kaali devotee and poet Ramprasad Sen.|$|E

25|$|Then, {{high on a}} crag jutting {{over the}} river just above the cataract, she saw him! Her lost lover had not forgotten. Even above {{the roar of the}} water she heard him call her name. <b>She</b> <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> canoe, waved her arms and screamed for help. Though he knew his chances of saving his beloved were slim at best, the young Englishman did not {{hesitate}} for a moment. He leaped from the overhanging bluff and plunged into the whitened water, just as Lillinonah's canoe struck a rock {{in the middle of the}} river and capsized, spilling her into the frothy current. Swiftly as he could, he swam to her side and clasped her body to him. Alas, neither realized that it was already too late. Still wrapped in loving embrace, the doomed pair disappeared into the boiling falls and were crushed to death as they were hurled to the rocks in the broad pool below.|$|E

500|$|... "G.U.Y." [...] was {{included}} in the setlist of her Manhattan residency show at Roseland Ballroom. Following the performance of [...] "Applause", Gaga appeared in a white jumpsuit and green colored wig which she had introduced during the Artpop era. <b>She</b> <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of the Ballroom stage and sang the opening lyrics while purple neon lights flooded the stage. On April 2, her performance of the song was broadcast on Late Show with David Letterman along with her song [...] "Dope". Amanda Holpuch from The Guardian recalled that the performance of [...] "G.U.Y." [...] received [...] "as much love as [...] first big hit 'Just Dance'". April Spanos from The Village Voice rendered the performances of [...] "Applause" [...] and [...] "G.U.Y." [...] as the [...] "power duo" [...] of the night. She added that the latter was [...] "particularly pleasant to hear live; the Zedd beat was made to be experienced in a club and its crunch was felt all over the dancefloor." [...] Conversely, Hilary Hughes from USA Today felt that the simplest moments of the performances were the ones featuring toned down versions of her singles like [...] "Born This Way" [...] and [...] "Poker Face", rather than the [...] "extravagant" [...] choreography during [...] "Bad Romance" [...] and [...] "G.U.Y." [...] On {{the final day of the}} Roseland shows, Gaga took a bow with her dancers after the performance, saying [...] "Roseland, thank you for all the wonderful memories you've given us... Thank you for giving us this historic opportunity." ...|$|E

Through much of her later life, she published the journal Choice, which presented a right-wing stance but was generally independent of any political party.|$|E

The kind of singing she did cannot be taught, it can't be studied in books, it can't be written down. Long experience as a singer and wide-open ears were her only teachers, and she learned her lessons well." ...|$|E
