40|$|Computer {{simulation}} {{is being}} increasingly {{used as a}} teaching tool. Having developed a computer-generated virtual focimeter, {{we are now in}} the process of developing a computer-generated virtual <b>streak</b> <b>retinoscope</b> to teach the principles of retinoscopy and the effect of residual refractive error and mirror movement on the pupil reflex. One of the important requirements was to provide as accurate a simulation as possible for the completely general case of an astigmatic patient and a streak in any orientation being moved also in any orientation. This required a thorough understanding of the optical theory of the retinoscope and equations that describe the behaviour of the pupil reflex. We have taken this opportunity to review the optics of the <b>streak</b> <b>retinoscope</b> and derive equations for the behaviour of the pupil streak reflex. <br /...|$|E

40|$|In medical ophthalmology, {{refractive}} {{studies have}} {{become an integral part}} of a complete ophthalmic examination and second only to a slit-lamp biomicroscopic examination in determining visual function and ability. This study shows that the same ideology applies to refractive studies on dogs. The refraction technique has evolved in process, with refinement of the technology and methods used; with the development of handheld autorefractors utilised in paediatric refraction. Fifty guide dogs completed this study however five of the dogs were subsequently excluded and replaced because of poor compliance. Forty six of the dogs were Labrador Retrievers; one was a Golden Retriever, one a Great Dane cross, one a Labrador cross and one a cross breed. The median sample age was 17 months with an interquartile range (IQR) of 13 to 34 months. We validated the agreement in refractive error measurement between the Welch Allyn ™ "SureSight" (WASS) autorefractor to the traditional Welch Allyn ™ handheld <b>streak</b> <b>retinoscope</b> (SR) by two experienced investigators, due to previous studies showing variability in measurement for both instruments. The refractive state for 60 °/o of the guide dogs sampled at South African Guide Dogs Association (SAGDA) were emmetropic (- 0. 5 to + 0. 5 D), 34 % were hypermetropic (>+ 0. 5 D) with 6 % myopic (- 0. 50 cylinder) was detected more readily on the WASS (37 dogs) than on the SR (9 dogs). Between investigators the MSE measurements differed significantly (P = 0. 02), with the average agreement on the SR slightly better than the WASS. Overall, the handheld manual <b>streak</b> <b>retinoscope</b> remains the more practical, cost effective and efficient instrument for objective refraction in dogs. We can also conclude, that current subjective criteriae utilised in the selection of guide dogs at SAGA can be further improved by including objective methods of refraction.

40|$|AIM:To {{explore the}} microfluctuation change of eye {{accommodation}} in adolescents with ametropic amblyopia under same amount comprehensive amblyopia treatment and the efficacy for dominant eye. METHODS:Teenagers who took routine physical examination were {{chosen as the}} research object. Copper card method was used to identify the dominant eye and the main eye in adolescents with ametropic amblyopia which was the observation group, 63 cases with 63 eyes each. Sixty subjects with emmetropia were as the normal group. The research objects underwent mydriasis optometry, computer optometry and <b>streak</b> <b>retinoscopes</b> to determine the diopter. The patients with ametropic amblyopia were treated with same amount comprehensive amblyopia treatment, and wearing glasses. There was not any treatment for normal group. The curative effect of same amount comprehensive amblyopia treatment were tested between the observation group and the control group when treating at 1, 3, 6 and 12 mo respectively. Microfluctuation changes when reading at the distance of 25, 33 and 50 cm(5 min for every distance) {{of the two groups}} were tested. Then the low frequencies(LFC) of microfluctuation change was calculated and analyzed. The whole eye aberration of the normal group and the observation group were tested with i-Trace Wave Scan Wavefront, and the corneal aberration was collected and calculated with Humphrey corneal topographer. Microfluctuation changes of the two groups were compared and the relation between the accommodation index and the wavefront aberration was analyzed. RESULTS:Through statistical analysis, the LFC value of the observation group at 25, 33 and 50 cm respectively was 0. 086 ± 0. 022, 0. 057 ± 0. 032 and 0. 041 ± 0. 028 D 2 /Hz, which was significantly higher than the LFC value of the normal group which was 0. 047 ± 0. 023, 0. 037 ± 0. 021, 0. 027 ± 0. 011 D 2 /Hz(P CONCLUSION:Under the same amount treatment, the short-term curative effect of dominant eyes in children with ametropic amblyopia is superior to the non-dominant ones. While the differences of medium and long-term efficacy have no statistical significance. There is no difference on corneal aberration between dominant and non-dominant eyes. At near distance, the LFC of microfluctuation change was higher in amblyopia patients than that in normals...|$|R
40|$|AIM:To {{compare the}} {{difference}} between diopter of refration measured after cycloplegic mydriasis with retinoscopy and hand-held autorefractor so as to explore the feasibility of using hand-held autorefractor for refraction screening in cadet candidates. METHODS:Respectively using hand-held autorefractor and <b>streak</b> <b>retinoscope</b> to do optometry examination in 317 cadet candidates students(634 eyes) after mydriasis. Main index of refraction values(spherical, cylindrical mirror degree and axial) were analyzed by difference test and correlation analysis. And the elimination rate was comparatively analyzed. RESULTS:Diopters of sphere and cyclic refraction measured by hand-held autorefration {{were significantly higher than}} those by retinoscopy(P r = 0. 733, 0. 694), axial of refration measured by these two methods were non-significant(P > 0. 05). The disqualifying rate using autorefraction was much higher than that using retinoscopy. It was easy to be wrongly eliminated. CONCLUSION:Because of the high correlation between diopters of autorefraction measured by retinascopy and autorefractor, autorefraction has application value in refraction screening in cadet candidates with normal vision...|$|E

To critically analyze {{the need for}} supplementation of Vitamin A, to children of low socioeconomic strata. Methods: Students were examined from 2 primary schools. Visual acuity was tested using Snellen's chart, Pictogram and Landolt C chart. Detailed anterior and posterior segment examination using Binocular loop, Ophthalmoscope and <b>Streak</b> <b>retinoscope.</b> RESULTS: Total no of 560 children of age 3 to 13 yr were screened from 2 primary schools. Statistically {{significant difference was found}} {{in the age of the}} study subject and presence of refractive errors. Percentage of students having Refractive error: myopia (29. 64 %) is the major cause of refractive error, followed by astigmatism (4. 28 %) hypermetropia (3. 25 %) and amblyopia (1. 25 %). Conclusion: It was observed that many children had high refractive error and were undiagnosed. The possible reason could be ignorance on the part of teachers and parents, even when the children have vision related complains. Also the children in the younger age-group lack the acumen to judge whether they can see clearly or not. Prevalence of Vitamin A deficiency appears reduced in urban areas.

40|$|Background : Current {{amblyopia}} {{screening methods}} are not cost effective. Aim : To evaluate the diagnostic capability of a modified Br&# 252;ckner test (MBT) for amblyopiogenic risk factors. Materials and Methods : We applied the MBT using the <b>streak</b> <b>retinoscope</b> to identify anisometropia and strabismus by noting an inter-ocular difference in movement and glow, from children who failed 6 / 9 Snellen on community vision screening, followed by comprehensive eye examination. Statisitics : Data {{were analyzed by}} 2 &# 935; 2 tables for diagnostic test parameters (95 &#x 0025; CI). Results : From 7998 children vision-screened, 392 failed 6 / 9 VA and were referred. Since 34 failed to reach the centers, and 15 were excluded due to poor/ no glow, data from 343 was analyzed. The prevalence of anisometropia of 0. 5 D was 17 &#x 0025;, of 1 D was 11 &#x 0025; and of strabismus 5 &#x 0025;. For the MBT the accuracy was &# 8805; 90 &#x 0025; (95 &#x 0025;CI 89 &#x 0025; to 97 &#x 0025;) over the three outcomes. The sensitivity, specificity, NPV and &#x 002 B;LR for anisometropia of 0. 5 D were: 0. 57 (0. 48, 0. 64), 0. 97 (0. 95, 0. 98), 0. 92 (0. 90, 0. 93) and 18 (9. 7, 35); for 1 D: 0. 74 (0. 60, 0. 82), 0. 95 (0. 94, 0. 97), 0. 97 (0. 95, 0. 98) and 16 (9. 3, 28); and for strabismus: 0. 5 (0. 32, 0. 66), 0. 98 (0. 97, 0. 98), 0. 97 (0. 96, 0. 98) and 20 (9. 1, 42). Conclusion : Our data suggests that the MBT is highly accurate and useful for ruling in anisometropia and strabismus in children who fail 6 / 9 Snellen. The MBT needs further validation, both by different care givers and on differing populations. It offers an affordable, portable, and clinically useful tool to detect anisometropia and strabismus. We suggest that performing an MBT prior to uniocular retinosocpy should be a routine practice...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{syndrome}} Multiple Congenital Ocular Anomalies (MCOA) is a congenital {{eye disease}} in horses. Previous {{studies have shown}} that both the MCOA syndrome and the silver coat color in horses are caused by the same missense mutation in PMEL 17. Horses homozygous for the Silver mutation (TT) are affected by multiple eye defects causing visual impairment or even blindness. Horses heterozygous for the Silver mutation (CT) usually have iridociliary cysts, occasionally extending into the peripheral retina. Clinical signs of visual impairment seem to be very rare in these horses. However, a recent study reported that Comtois horses carrying the Silver mutation had deeper anterior chambers of the eye compared to Wild-type horses. This could potentially cause refractive errors. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to study refraction of the eye in horses heterozygous for the Silver mutation to investigate if they have refractive errors. Ninety-four Icelandic horses were examined. All horses were genotyped for the missense mutation in PMEL 17. Each of the 47 CT horses was matched by a Wild-type (CC) horse of the same age ± 1 year. A brief ophthalmic examination was performed and questionnaires regarding signs of visual impairment were filled out by the owners. Skiascopy was performed using a <b>streak</b> <b>retinoscope</b> (Heine Beta 200) and Trousseau racks without dilation of the pupils. Association between refraction and age, eye, genotype and sex was tested by linear mixed-effect model analysis. Pairwise interactions between each fixed factor (age, eye, genotype and sex) were included in the model. Results: The mean refraction value ± SE was 0. 00 ± 0. 12 D for the right eye and 0. 03 ± 0. 10 D for the left eye in CT horses compared to 0. 22 ± 0. 05 D for both right and left eye in Wild-type horses. The interaction between age and genotype had a significant impact on the refractive state (P= 0. 001). A deviation towards myopia (nearsightedness) could be observed in CT horses older than 200 months (16. 7 years). In the questionnaire, forty-one CT horse owners (87. 2...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} constant flickering light on refractive development, the role of serotonin (i. e. 5 -hydroxytryptamine, 5 -HT) and 5 -HT 2 A receptor in myopia induced by flickering light in guinea pigs. Forty-five guinea pigs were randomly divided into three groups: control, form deprivation myopia (FDM) and flickering light induced myopia (FLM) groups(n = 15 for each group). The right eyes of the FDM group were covered with semitransparent hemispherical plastic shells serving as eye diffusers. Guinea pigs in FLM group were raised with illumination of a duty cycle of 50 % at a flash frequency of 0. 5 Hz. The refractive status, axial length (AL), corneal radius of curvature(CRC) were measured by <b>streak</b> <b>retinoscope,</b> A-scan ultrasonography and keratometer, respectively. Ultramicroscopy images were taken by electron microscopy. The concentrations of 5 -HTin the retina, vitreous body and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) were assessed by high performance liquid chromatography, the retinal 5 -HT 2 A receptor expression was evaluated by immunohistofluorescence and western blot. The refraction of FDM and FLM eyes became myopic from some time point (the 4 th week and the 6 th week, respectively) {{in the course of}} the experiment, which was indicated by significantly decreased refraction and longer AL when compared with the controls (p< 0. 05). The concentrations of 5 -HT in the retina, vitreous body and RPE of FDM and FLM eyes were significantly increased in comparison with those of control eyes (both p< 0. 05). Similar to FDM eyes, the expression of retinal 5 -HT 2 A receptor in FLM eyes was significantly up-regulated compared to that of control eyes (both p< 0. 05). Western blot analysis showed that retinal 5 -HT 2 A receptor level elevated less in the FLM eyes than that in the FDM eyes. Moreover, the levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine in FDM and FLM groups generally decreased when compared with control groups (all p< 0. 05). Constant flickering light could cause progressive myopia in guinea pigs. 5 -HT and 5 -HT 2 A receptor increased both in form deprivation myopia and flickering light induced myopia, indicating that 5 -HT possibly involved in myopic development via binding to 5 -HT 2 A receptor...|$|E
