5|$|Penicillium moulds cause {{soft rot}} such as of apples, while Aspergillus moulds create patches {{on the surface}} of old bread, yoghurt and many other foods. Yeasts spoil sugary foods such as plums and jams, fermenting the sugars to alcohol. Scientific {{understanding}} of <b>spoilage</b> began in the 19th century with works such as Louis Pasteur's 1879 Studies on Fermentation, which investigated the <b>spoilage</b> of beer.|$|E
5|$|All {{vegetables}} {{benefit from}} proper post harvest care. A {{large proportion of}} vegetables and perishable foods are lost after harvest during the storage period. These losses may {{be as high as}} thirty to fifty percent in developing countries where adequate cold storage facilities are not available. The main causes of loss include <b>spoilage</b> caused by moisture, moulds, micro-organisms, and vermin.|$|E
5|$|Caching is {{inhibited}} by {{the presence}} of Steller's jays (Cyanocitta stelleri) and grey jays from adjacent territories, which follow resident grey jays to steal cached food. Grey jays carry large food items to distant cache sites for storage more often than small food items. To prevent theft, they also tend to carry valuable food items further from the source when caching in the company of one or more grey jays. Scatterhoarding discourages pilferage by competitors, while increased cache density leads to increased thievery. In southern portions of the grey jay's range, food is not cached during summer because of the chance of <b>spoilage</b> and the reduced need for winter stores.|$|E
5|$|Haylage, {{also known}} as Round bale silage is a term for grass sealed in {{airtight}} plastic bags, a form of forage that is frequently fed in the United Kingdom and continental Europe, but is not often seen in the United States. Because haylage {{is a type of}} silage, hay stored in this fashion must remain completely sealed in plastic, as any holes or tears can stop the preservation properties of fermentation and lead to mold or <b>spoilage.</b> Rodents chewing through the plastic can also spoil the hay introducing contamination to the bale. If a rodent dies inside the plastic, the subsequent botulism toxins released can contaminate the entire bale.|$|E
5|$|Hygiene {{is a set}} of {{practices}} to avoid infection or food <b>spoilage</b> by eliminating microorganisms from the surroundings. As microorganisms, in particular bacteria, are found virtually everywhere, harmful microorganisms may be reduced to acceptable levels rather than actually eliminated. In food preparation, microorganisms are reduced by preservation methods such as cooking, cleanliness of utensils, short storage periods, or by low temperatures. If complete sterility is needed, as with surgical equipment, an autoclave is used to kill microorganisms with heat and pressure.|$|E
5|$|Terphenylquinones are {{chemical}} compounds that are widely distributed among the Basidiomycetes division of fungi. Ascocoryne sarcoides {{has been shown}} to contain a terphenylquinone named ascocoryninâ€”a chemical derivative of the compound benzoquinone. This pigment, when in alkaline solution, turns a dark violet, similar in color to the fruit bodies of the fungus. Ascocorynin has moderate antibiotic activity, and was shown in laboratory tests to inhibit the growth of several Gram-positive bacteria, including the widely distributed food <b>spoilage</b> organism Bacillus stearothermophilus; however, it has no effect on the growth on Gram-negative bacteria, nor does it have any anti-fungal activity.|$|E
5|$|The {{objective}} of preserving vegetables is {{to extend their}} availability for consumption or marketing purposes. The aim is to harvest the food at its maximum state of palatability and nutritional value, and preserve these qualities for an extended period. The main causes of deterioration in vegetables after they are gathered are the actions of naturally-occurring enzymes and the <b>spoilage</b> caused by micro-organisms. Canning and freezing are {{the most commonly used}} techniques, and vegetables preserved by these methods are generally similar in nutritional value to comparable fresh products with regards to carotenoids, vitamin E, minerals. and dietary fiber.|$|E
5|$|The {{possible}} {{existence of}} unseen microbial life was suspected from ancient times, {{such as in}} Jain scriptures from 6th century BC India, and the 1st century BC book On Agriculture by Marcus Terentius Varro. Microbiology, {{the scientific study of}} microorganisms, began with their observation under the microscope in the 1670s by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek. In the 1850s, Louis Pasteur found that microorganisms caused food <b>spoilage,</b> debunking the theory of spontaneous generation. In the 1880s Robert Koch discovered that microorganisms caused the diseases tuberculosis, cholera, and anthrax.|$|E
5|$|The sinew, {{soaked in}} animal glue, is then laid in layers {{on the back}} of the bow; the strands of sinew are {{oriented}} along the length of the bow. The sinew is normally obtained from the lower legs and back of wild deer or domestic ungulates. Traditionally, ox tendons are considered inferior to wild-game sinews since they have a higher fat content, leading to <b>spoilage.</b> Sinew will extend farther than wood, again allowing more energy storage.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{sun drying}} {{has been used}} for some {{products}} such as tomatoes, mushrooms, and beans, spreading the produce on racks and turning the crop at intervals. This method suffers from several disadvantages including lack of control over drying rates, <b>spoilage</b> when drying is slow, contamination by dirt, wetting by rain, and attack by rodents, birds, and insects. These disadvantages can be alleviated by using solar powered driers. The dried produce must be prevented from reabsorbing moisture during storage.|$|E
5|$|Antioxidants {{are used}} as food {{additives}} to help guard against food deterioration. Exposure to oxygen and sunlight are the two main factors in the oxidation of food, so food is preserved by keeping {{in the dark and}} sealing it in containers or even coating it in wax, as with cucumbers. However, as oxygen is also important for plant respiration, storing plant materials in anaerobic conditions produces unpleasant flavors and unappealing colors. Consequently, packaging of fresh fruits and vegetables contains an ~8% oxygen atmosphere. Antioxidants are an especially important class of preservatives as, unlike bacterial or fungal <b>spoilage,</b> oxidation reactions still occur relatively rapidly in frozen or refrigerated food. These preservatives include natural antioxidants such as ascorbic acid (AA, E300) and tocopherols (E306), as well as synthetic antioxidants such as propyl gallate (PG, E310), tertiary butylhydroquinone (TBHQ), butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA, E320) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT, E321).|$|E
5|$|Grey jays are {{classified}} as least concern (LC) according to the IUCN Red List, having stable populations over a very large area of boreal and subalpine habitats only lightly occupied by humans. Significant human impacts may nevertheless occur through anthropogenic climate warming. Grey jays at the northern edges of their range may benefit from the extension of spruce stands out onto formerly treeless tundra. A study of a declining population {{at the southern end}} of the grey jay's range linked the decline in reproductive success to warmer temperatures in preceding autumns. Such warm temperatures may trigger <b>spoilage</b> of the perishable food items stored by grey jays upon which success of late winter nesting partly depends.|$|E
5|$|Many fungi produce biologically active compounds, {{several of}} which are toxic to animals or plants and are {{therefore}} called mycotoxins. Of particular relevance to humans are mycotoxins produced by molds causing food <b>spoilage,</b> and poisonous mushrooms (see above). Particularly infamous are the lethal amatoxins in some Amanita mushrooms, and ergot alkaloids, which {{have a long history}} of causing serious epidemics of ergotism (St Anthony's Fire) in people consuming rye or related cereals contaminated with sclerotia of the ergot fungus, Claviceps purpurea. Other notable mycotoxins include the aflatoxins, which are insidious liver toxins and highly carcinogenic metabolites produced by certain Aspergillus species often growing in or on grains and nuts consumed by humans, ochratoxins, patulin, and trichothecenes (e.g., T-2 mycotoxin) and fumonisins, which have significant impact on human food supplies or animal livestock.|$|E
5|$|Bill Pugh, {{the chief}} {{plastics}} designer at Cascelloid, based in Leicester, and former Royal Air Force pilot, created {{a prototype of}} the blown lemon-shaped plastic shaped container based upon Hack's idea sometime in the 1950s, {{as well as other}} types of blown containers. Pugh's experimented with the initial design until he was satisfied with its appearance. This plastic lemon product was then used for Hax lemon juice. Edward Hack, Ltd. produced and marketed Hax brand squeezable plastic lemon containers filled with two ounces of Sicilian lemon juice. Per Edward Hack, Ltd., the juice was unfiltered, had no water added to it, and contained a preservative to prevent <b>spoilage.</b> Retailers could purchase the product in packs of six bags that contained 12 squeeze packs each, totalling 72 units. Upon introduction to the marketplace, Hax juice and the plastic lemon design received some press coverage. The Hax logo used on Hax lemon juice dates back to at least 1935, at which time it was used in advertisements for Hax brand iodine pencils and Hax brand aspirin.|$|E
5|$|President Bush also {{declared}} Washington, D.C., as {{a disaster}} area {{two days after}} Isabel passed through the area. The United States Department of Agriculture approved a request for an emergency food stamp program for two weeks {{for the city to}} ensure those who lost food {{as a result of the}} hurricane would not go hungry. By eight days after the hurricane, the Department of Employment Services created disaster unemployment benefits for those who lost their work as a direct result of Isabel. By 11days after Isabel, the government approved $5.21million in disaster assistance (2003USD, $ USD). The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers delivered nearly 800,000pounds (363,000kg) of dry ice to four distribution sites for use with cold food storage to areas in the District suffering from power outages. Various groups joined to provide more than 15,000meals for residents who lost stored food due to <b>spoilage</b> resulting from the power outages. Volunteers assisted in distributing 515tons (467t) of ice, along with 21,000 sandbags throughout the district. Officials opened two disaster recovery centers which moved through the neighborhoods of the district. Ultimately, nearly 1,500residents in the district applied for federal assistance, with FEMA providing the residents more than $600,000 in aid (2003USD, ($ USD).|$|E
5|$|There {{was also}} the {{secondary}} capital city of Luoyang, which was the favored capital of the two by Empress Wu. In the year 691 she had more than 100,000 families (more than 500,000 people) from around the region of Chang'an move to populate Luoyang instead. With {{a population of about}} a million, Luoyang became the second largest city in the empire, and with its close proximity to the Luo River it benefited from southern agricultural fertility and trade traffic of the Grand Canal. However, the Tang court eventually demoted its capital status and did not visit Luoyang after the year 743, when Chang'an's problem of acquiring adequate supplies and stores for the year was solved. As early as 736, granaries were built at critical points along the route from Yangzhou to Chang'an, which eliminated shipment delays, <b>spoilage,</b> and pilfering. An artificial lake used as a transshipment pool was dredged east of Chang'an in 743, where curious northerners could finally see the array of boats found in southern China, delivering tax and tribute items to the imperial court.|$|E
5|$|Abundant worldwide, most fungi are {{inconspicuous}} {{because of}} the small size of their structures, and their cryptic lifestyles in soil or on dead matter. Fungi include symbionts of plants, animals, or other fungi and also parasites. They may become noticeable when fruiting, either as mushrooms or as molds. Fungi perform an essential role in the decomposition of organic matter and have fundamental roles in nutrient cycling and exchange in the environment. They have long been used as a direct source of human food, in the form of mushrooms and truffles; as a leavening agent for bread; and in the fermentation of various food products, such as wine, beer, and soy sauce. Since the 1940s, fungi have been used for the production of antibiotics, and, more recently, various enzymes produced by fungi are used industrially and in detergents. Fungi are also used as biological pesticides to control weeds, plant diseases and insect pests. Many species produce bioactive compounds called mycotoxins, such as alkaloids and polyketides, that are toxic to animals including humans. The fruiting structures of a few species contain psychotropic compounds and are consumed recreationally or in traditional spiritual ceremonies. Fungi can break down manufactured materials and buildings, and become significant pathogens of humans and other animals. Losses of crops due to fungal diseases (e.g., rice blast disease) or food <b>spoilage</b> can have a large impact on human food supplies and local economies.|$|E
5|$|In early 1942, Zyklon B {{emerged as}} the {{preferred}} killing tool of Nazi Germany for use in extermination camps during the Holocaust. The chemical was used to kill roughly one million people in gas chambers installed in extermination camps at Auschwitz-Birkenau, Majdanek, and elsewhere. Most {{of the victims were}} Jews, and by far the majority killed using this method died at Auschwitz. Zyklon B was supplied to concentration camps at Mauthausen, Dachau, and Buchenwald by the distributor Heli, and to Auschwitz and Majdanek by Testa. Camps also occasionally bought Zyklon B directly from the manufacturers. Of the 729 metric tons of Zyklon B sold in Germany in 1942â€“44, 56 metric tons (about 8 per cent of domestic sales) were sold to concentration camps. Auschwitz received 23.8 tons, of which 6 tons were used for fumigation. The remainder was used in the gas chambers or lost to <b>spoilage</b> (the product had a stated shelf life of only three months). Testa conducted fumigations for the Wehrmacht and supplied them with Zyklon B. They also offered courses to the SS in the safe handling and use of the material for fumigation purposes. In April 1941, the German agriculture and interior ministries designated the SS as an authorized applier of the chemical, and thus they were able to use it without any further training or governmental oversight.|$|E
25|$|Irradiation is used {{to reduce}} post harvest losses. It reduces populations of <b>spoilage</b> {{micro-organisms}} in the food and can slow down {{the speed at which}} enzymes change the food and therefore slows <b>spoilage,</b> ripening, and inhibits sprouting (e.g. of potato, onion and garlic).|$|E
25|$|The lack of acid, {{which protects}} orange juice against <b>spoilage</b> in other groups, renders them {{generally}} unfit for processing as juice, {{so they are}} primarily eaten. They remain profitable in areas of local consumption, but rapid <b>spoilage</b> renders them unsuitable for export to major population centres of Europe, Asia, or the United States.|$|E
25|$|During {{commercial}} {{filling it}} is common to use a flame to sterilize the rim and lid of jars to destroy any yeasts and molds which may cause <b>spoilage</b> during storage. Steam is commonly injected immediately prior to lidding to create a vacuum, which both helps prevent <b>spoilage</b> and pulls down tamper-evident safety button when used.|$|E
25|$|This is {{a process}} that protects against <b>spoilage</b> by {{eliminating}} bacteria, yeasts and molds.|$|E
25|$|To improve {{tenderness}} of beef, it {{is often}} aged (i.e., stored refrigerated) to allow endogenous proteolytic enzymes to weaken structural and myofibrillar proteins. Wet aging is accomplished using vacuum packaging to reduce <b>spoilage</b> and yield loss. Dry aging involves hanging primals (usually ribs or loins) in humidity-controlled coolers. Outer surfaces dry out and can support growth of molds (and <b>spoilage</b> bacteria, if too humid), resulting in trim and evaporative losses.|$|E
25|$|Acetic acid in wine, often {{referred}} to as volatile acidity (VA) or vinegar taint, can be contributed by many wine <b>spoilage</b> yeasts and bacteria. This can be from either a by-product of fermentation, or due to the <b>spoilage</b> of finished wine. Acetic acid bacteria, such as those from the genera Acetobacter and Gluconobacter produce high levels of acetic acid. The sensory threshold for acetic acid in wine is >700mg/L, with concentrations greater than 1.2-1.3 g/L becoming unpleasant.|$|E
25|$|Compressed tea (such as Pu-erh) is {{produced}} for convenience in transport, storage, and ageing. It {{can usually be}} stored longer without <b>spoilage</b> than loose leaf tea.|$|E
25|$|Organised {{retailers}} {{will reduce}} waste by improving logistics, creating cold storage to prevent food <b>spoilage,</b> improve hygiene and product safety, reduce counterfeit trade and tax evasion on expensive item purchases, and create dependable supply chains for secure {{supply of food}} staples, fruits and vegetables. They will increase choice and reduce Indiaâ€™s rampant inflation by reducing waste, <b>spoilage</b> and cutting out middlemen. Fresh investment in organised retail, the supporters of retail reform claim will generate 10 million new jobs by 2014, about five to six million of them in logistics alone.|$|E
25|$|P. roqueforti {{is known}} {{to be one of the}} most common <b>spoilage</b> molds of silage. It is also one of several {{different}} moulds that can spoil bread.|$|E
25|$|Irradiation is used {{to create}} shelf stable products. Since {{irradiation}} reduces the populations of <b>spoilage</b> microorganisms and because pre-packed food can be irradiated, the packaging prevents recontamination into the final product.|$|E
25|$|Wine {{preservation}} and dispensing systems {{have also been}} developed that store wine at their optimal temperatures and use nitrogen gas to dispense the wine. Nitrogen gas helps prevent wine from oxidation and premature <b>spoilage.</b>|$|E
25|$|Under {{hygienic}} {{conditions and}} without other treatment, meat {{can be stored}} at above its freezing point (â€“1.5Â°C) for about six weeks without <b>spoilage,</b> during which time it undergoes an aging process that increases its tenderness and flavor.|$|E
25|$|All {{fruits and}} {{vegetables}} should be rinsed before eating. This recommendation also applies to produce with rinds or skins that are not eaten. It should be done just before preparing or eating to avoid premature <b>spoilage.</b>|$|E
25|$|Good hygiene {{can prevent}} the spread of disease and {{otherwise}} improve the health and growth rate of snails. Food is replaced daily in order to prevent <b>spoilage.</b> Earthworms added to the soil help keep the pen clean.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{greatest}} risk of over supplementing a must is that excess nitrogen and other nutrients will be left behind after fermentation is complete. This can create microbial instability as <b>spoilage</b> organisms can use these excess nutrients.|$|E
25|$|Food safety {{advocates have}} criticized the FDA for {{allowing}} meat manufacturers to use carbon monoxide gas mixtures during the packaging process to prevent discoloration of meat, a process that may hide signs of <b>spoilage</b> from the consumer.|$|E
25|$|The <b>spoilage</b> of meat occurs, if untreated, in {{a matter}} of hours or days and results in the meat {{becoming}} unappetizing, poisonous or infectious. <b>Spoilage</b> is caused by the practically unavoidable infection and subsequent decomposition of meat by bacteria and fungi, which are borne by the animal itself, by the people handling the meat, and by their implements. Meat can be kept edible for a much longer time â€“ though not indefinitely â€“ if proper hygiene is observed during production and processing, and if appropriate food safety, food preservation and food storage procedures are applied. Without the application of preservatives and stabilizers, the fats in meat may also begin to rapidly decompose after cooking or processing, leading to an objectionable taste known as warmed over flavor.|$|E
25|$|As with {{environmental}} economics, {{care must be}} taken to ensure a complete view of the costs and benefits involved. For example, paperboard packaging for food products is more easily recycled than most plastic, but is heavier to ship and may result in more waste from <b>spoilage.</b>|$|E
