It increases throughput by moving some computing tasks from the ground to the spacecraft and saves money by allowing the use of modern programming languages.|$|E

5|$|Given that Moreno González's {{body was}} never {{recovered}} from the December 2010 shootout where officials said he was killed, there were rumors that he was alive and secretly leading the Knights Templar Cartel, the <b>split-off</b> group of La Familia Michoacana. On June 2011, members of La Familia Michoacana set up several public banners throughout the state of Guerrero with written messages directed to the former President Calderón and his security spokesman Alejandro Poiré. The banners proclaimed that Moreno González was in fact alive and leading the Knights Templar Cartel, {{and that the government}} was allegedly covering him up. The rumors were immediately denied by the Mexican government, which stood firm that the drug lord was killed by federal forces on December 9, 2010. Rumors sparked again in October 2011 following the arrest of Mario Buenrostro Quiroz, a drug trafficker who headed a Mexico City-based gang known as Los Aboytes. In a videotaped police confession, he told authorities that Moreno González was still alive and heading the cartel. Intelligence agency InSight Crime said the rumors were probably part of a campaign of the Knights Templar Cartel to win prestige from La Familia Michoacana by saying that their leader is in fact alive and still supporting the group. On 27 October 2012, the Mexican Army raided a safe house in Apatzingán where they believed the drug lord Enrique Plancarte Solís was hiding. Though the raid was ultimately unsuccessful because Plancarte Solís managed to avoid capture by sending several gunmen from his inner circle to battle off the soldiers, the authorities discovered several documents written for Moreno González. The Army gave the documents to the intelligence agency SIEDO for further investigation.|$|E

40|$|Yearling {{male and}} adult female {{reindeer}} (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) {{are similar in}} size and shape. If sexual clues are hidden, {{it can be difficult}} to distinguish between them. Antlers can be a useful aid in classifying yearling males and adult females, depending on whether specific antler characteristics are identifiable for these two groups. We recorded antler characteristics in a domestic reindeer herd (V&aring;g&aring;) and found considerable overlap in antler height, width and circumference between the different age and sex groups. Total tines and number of tine <b>split-offs</b> are use&not;ful for the field biologist when discriminating among adult females, yearling males and 2. 5 year-old males. For example, when using the tine <b>split-offs</b> with the suggested classification, 79 % of the observed adult females and 76 % of the yearling males were classified correctly. The antler height, width and circumference provide other biological dif&not;ferences between groups, but are not easy to use to identify free ranging reindeer. This is due to the great overlap in antler size between the groups and measuring difficulties in a field study situation. Male and female calves have very similar antlers, and only the antler width is possible for sex discrimination, giving 67 % accuracy of discriminating between these two groups...|$|R

We also study the role of the family in shaping transfer behavior, and find that transfer behavior of adults living outside of their household of origin is significantly associated with parent or origin household transfer behavior. Our estimation strategy is based on the method of maximum simulated likelihood (MSL), which allows us to account for the correlation in error terms within and across generations. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} improved estimation of measures of firm dynamics and job creation and destruction. In keeping with a novel approach recently developed in the Scandinavian countries and the U.

The study is based on a linked employer-employee data set covering all private employment in Belgium. The employee flow approach results in a substantial quality improvement of the measures discussed. In the period of observation, we find that 35 to 50 per cent of total entries and exits of firms with at least 10 employees does not coincide with the real opening or closing of a firm. After correcting for these spurious events, job creation and destruction levels are substantially revised downwards. Besides affecting average levels, correcting for employee flows also strongly reduces annual variation in estimated measures, especially at the sectoral level. status: publishe...|$|R
25|$|Carl Jung {{believed}} that the collective unconscious, which reflects the cosmic order {{and the history of}} the human species, is {{the most important part of}} the mind. It contains archetypes, which are manifested in symbols that appear in dreams, disturbed states of mind, and various products of culture. Jungians are less interested in infantile development and psychological conflict between wishes and the forces that frustrate them than in integration between different parts of the person. The object of Jungian therapy was to mend such splits. Jung focused in particular on problems of middle and later life. His objective was to allow people to experience the <b>split-off</b> aspects of themselves, such as the anima (a man's suppressed female self), the animus (a woman's suppressed male self), or the shadow (an inferior self-image), and thereby attain wisdom.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine if a {{conflict}} of interest arises when auditors opine on an internal control system that consists of an information system recently designed and implemented by their own firm. Design/methodology/approach – A sample of companies was selected that had a financial information design and implementation service (FISD) disclosure in 2000 - 2001 and a Section 404 internal control report issued in 2004 - 2005. Both descriptive statistics and logistic regression results provide insight into the relation between the type of internal control report issued and the FISD provider. Findings – After considering the type of auditor change (forced versus voluntary) and the timing of the consulting division <b>split-offs,</b> the results suggest that a material weakness internal control report is less likely if the same audit firm issued the internal control opinion and performed the FISD service. This result lends some support to the regulator's concern that certain types of non-audit services (NAS) may cause auditors to audit their own work. Originality/value – This study contributes to the literature by examining if the performance of a certain type of NAS (FISD) resulted in auditors auditing their own work when opining on certain internal control systems. To the author's knowledge, this is the first study of its type in relation to auditors auditing their own work.
