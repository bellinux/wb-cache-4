5|$|Safdarjung's Tomb is a {{sandstone}} {{and marble}} mausoleum in New Delhi, India. It {{was built in}} 1754 in the late Mughal Empire style for the statesman Safdarjung. The monument has an ambiance of <b>spaciousness</b> and an imposing presence with its domed and arched red brown and white coloured structures. Safdarjung was made prime minister of the Mughal Empire (Wazir ul-Mamlak-i-Hindustan) when Ahmad Shah Bahadur ascended the throne in 1748.|$|E
5|$|Prince Ivan III {{introduced}} Renaissance architecture to Russia {{by inviting}} {{a number of}} architects from Italy, who brought new construction techniques and some Renaissance style elements with them, while in general following the traditional designs of Russian architecture. In 1475 the Bolognese architect Aristotele Fioravanti came to rebuild the Cathedral of the Dormition in the Moscow Kremlin, which had been damaged in an earthquake. Fioravanti was given the 12th-century Vladimir Cathedral as a model, and he produced a design combining traditional Russian style with a Renaissance sense of <b>spaciousness,</b> proportion and symmetry.|$|E
5|$|Ruisdael's {{work from}} c. 1646 {{to the early}} 1650s, when {{he was living in}} Haarlem, is characterised by simple motifs and careful and {{laborious}} study of nature: dunes, woods, and atmospheric effects. By applying heavier paint than his predecessors, Ruisdael gave his foliage a rich quality, conveying a sense of sap flowing through branches and leaves. His accurate rendering of trees was unprecedented at the time: the genera of his trees are the first to be unequivocally recognisable by modern-day botanists. His early sketches introduce motifs that would return in all his work: a sense of <b>spaciousness</b> and luminosity, and an airy atmosphere achieved through pointillist-like touches of chalk. Most of his thirty black chalk sketches that survive date from this period.|$|E
5|$|The club had {{its origins}} around 1895, with Briarcliff founder Walter W. Law's private nine-hole course on his estate, which became {{available}} to Briarcliff Lodge guests, and was {{then known as}} the Briarcliff Golf Club. In 1922, Devereux Emmet designed a course across the street with eighteen holes, and thus Briarcliff Country Club was founded that year. The name was changed in 1927 to avoid confusion, to Briar Hills Country Club. Briar Hills opened in May 1929 with a new clubhouse; construction began in May 1928 and utilized local stones for the building's exterior. The interior was noted for its design and <b>spaciousness.</b> In 1936, A. W. Tillinghast redesigned the course. In 1948, Henry Law's son Theodore sold the club to local businessmen who renamed it Briar Hall Golf and Country Club. The 1964 Metropolitan Open was hosted at Briar Hall; Jack Patroni won the championship. In 1980, ownership of the club changed hands again.|$|E

25|$|The {{passenger}} berths {{were arranged}} around two large central saloons—a dining saloon and a grand saloon—into which they opened. Each saloon was illuminated by several large-diameter ventilated columns of patterned glass which stretched {{from the floor}} to a skylight in the spar deck above, while stained glass windows in the stern provided additional light. The saloons were richly carpeted, furnished with variegated Italian marble tables and superior quality furniture, and finished in a combination of woods, including rose, satin and olive. Mirrors around the walls enhanced the effect of <b>spaciousness.</b> A ladies' drawing-room was also provided.|$|E
25|$|According to Stephen Hill, {{co-founder of}} a radio show called Hearts of Space, the term is used to {{describe}} music that evokes a feeling of contemplative <b>spaciousness.</b> Hill states that space music can range in character, the sonic texture of the music can be simple or complex, it can be instrumental or electronic, it may lack conventional melodic, harmonic, or rhythmic features, and may be less concerned with the formal compositional schemes associated with other styles of music. Hill proposes that space music can be found within {{a wide range of}} genres. Some claim that music from the western classical, world, Celtic, traditional, experimental and other idioms also falls within the definition of space music.|$|E
25|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, the monastic lands granted by Henry VIII {{were not on}} their own {{sufficient}} to ensure Trinity's eventual rise. In terms of architecture and royal association, {{it was not until}} the Mastership of Thomas Nevile (1593–1615) that Trinity assumed both its <b>spaciousness</b> and its courtly association with the governing class that distinguished it since the Civil War. In its infancy Trinity had owed a great deal to its neighbouring college of St John's: in the exaggerated words of Roger Ascham Trinity was little more than a colonia deducta. Its first four Masters were educated at St John's, and it took until around 1575 for the two colleges' application numbers to draw even, a position in which they have remained since the Civil War. In terms of wealth, Trinity's current fortunes belie prior fluctuations; Nevile's building campaign drove the college into debt from which it only surfaced in the 1640s, and the Mastership of Richard Bentley adversely affected applications and finances. Bentley himself was notorious for the construction of a hugely expensive staircase in the Master's Lodge, and for his repeated refusals to step down despite pleas from the Fellows.|$|E

500|$|It seems {{probable}} {{from this}} description that the mosque had a portal that projected from the wall, {{as did the}} earlier Great Mosque of Mahdiya. In other respects {{it seems to have}} resembled the al-Azhar mosque in layout, architecture and decoration. Although the geographers al-Muqaddasi and Ibn Hawqal both praised this mosque, neither left specific descriptions of this or any other mosque. Thus Ibn Hawqal says of it only that, [...] "It is one of the mosques distinguished by the <b>spaciousness</b> of its court, elegance of construction, and the fineness of its ceilings." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{street is}} {{distinguished}} by the [...] "set back" [...] housing lines {{originally intended to}} provide an atmosphere of <b>spaciousness</b> along the thoroughfare. The original 1756 act to create the New Road prohibited the construction of any building within [...] of its side. Though the area had been {{designed to be a}} pleasant suburb, the arrival of railways in the 1840s turned the road into an industrial urban street, with factories and workshops aligning the road. The original bylaw restricting property {{on the front of the}} road was ignored and shops were built on top of gardens.|$|E

On {{each side of the}} saloon, seven corridors opened onto four berths each, for a total number of berths per side of 28, 56 altogether. The forward end of the saloon was connected to a stewards' galley, while the opposite end contained several tiers of sofas. This saloon was apparently the ship's most impressive of all the passenger spaces. Columns of white and gold, 24 in number, with [...] "ornamental capitals of great beauty", were arranged down its length and along the walls, while eight Arabesque pilasters, decorated with [...] "beautifully painted" [...] oriental flowers and birds, enhanced the aesthetic effect. The archways of the doors were [...] "tastefully carved and gilded" [...] and surmounted with medallion heads. Mirrors around the walls added an illusion of <b>spaciousness,</b> and the walls themselves were painted in a [...] "delicate lemon-tinted hue" [...] with highlights of blue and gold.|$|E
500|$|The former liner was reacquired by the Ward Line in 1927 and {{underwent}} a major refit — removal {{of one of}} its stacks and modernization of its interiors — at Todd Shipyard in Seattle, returning to passenger service in the following year. Havana was placed on the New York–Cuba service, where business thrived, in part because of Prohibition in the United States. Ward Line cruises to Havana were one of the quickest and least expensive ways to what one author called [...] "alcohol-enriched vacations". The success of the Cuba routes attracted the attention of Cunard Line who added service from New York to Cuba with select cruises of [...] in 1928, a full season of cruises on [...] in 1929, and the addition of RMS Carmania the following season.

500|$|The Library {{became more}} {{important}} during the 18th century; {{prior to that}} it had been a small, little-used collection of books. In 1725 it was proposed by the Pension that [...] "a publick Library be sett up and kept open for ye use of ye society", and that more books be purchased. The first order of new books was on 27 June 1729 and consisted of [...] "a collection of Lord Bacon's works". In 1750 the Under-Steward of the Inn made a new catalogue of the books, and in 1789 the Library was moved to a new room between the Hall and the Chapel. In 1840 another two rooms were erected in which to store books, and in 1883 a new Library was constructed with space to store approximately 11,000 books. This was rapidly found to be inadequate, and in 1929 a new Library, known as the Holker Library after the benefactor, Sir John Holker, was opened. The library, although impressive looking, was not particularly useful; Francis Cowper wrote that: Though impressive to look at, the new building was something less than a success as a library. The air of <b>spaciousness</b> was produced at the expense of shelf room, and though in the octagon [...] the decorative effect of row upon row of books soaring upwards towards the cornice was considerable, the loftiest were totally inaccessible save to those who could scale the longest and dizziest ladders. Further, the appointments were of such surpassing mag-nificence that no ink-pots were allowed in the room for fear of accidents.|$|E

[...] Just a few older houses still remain, mostly on the south side.|$|E
2500|$|The East London {{churches were}} {{intended}} for mission work in poor, crowded areas, and built on restricted budgets. [...] The Church Builder said of them They are spacious in plan, affording ample accommodation for the estimated congregations, {{and an almost}} lavish supply of room besides in unseated aisles and transepts. They are all also of unusual height. Their effect is obtained partly by this <b>spaciousness</b> and height, partly by the fine proportions of all the parts, partly by a bold, severe dignity {{in the style of}} design.|$|E
2500|$|Reverberation {{and delay}} effects {{are widely used}} in sound {{reinforcement}} systems to enhance {{the sound of the}} mix and create a desired artistic effect. Reverb and delay add a sense of <b>spaciousness</b> to the sound, imitating the sound of a singing voice or instrument in a large, reverberant hall. Many mixing boards designed for live sound include on-board reverb effects. [...] Modulation effects such as flanger, phaser, and chorus are also applied to some instruments. [...] An exciter [...] "livens up" [...] the sound of audio signals by applying dynamic equalization, phase manipulation and harmonic synthesis of typically high frequency signals.|$|E
2500|$|Leavis' {{appraisal}} {{of it has}} been hailed as the beginning of the critical consensus that still exists towards the novel, in which it is recognised not only as Eliot's finest work but also {{as one of the greatest}} novels in English. V. S. Pritchett, in The Living Novel, two years earlier, in 1946 had written that [...] "No Victorian novel approaches Middlemarch in its width of reference, its intellectual power, or the imperturbable <b>spaciousness</b> of its narrative [...] I doubt if any Victorian novelist has as much to teach the modern novelists as George Eliot [...] No writer has ever represented the ambiguities of moral choice so fully".|$|E
2500|$|Watts also {{later wrote}} of a mystical dream he {{experienced}} while ill with a fever as a child. During {{this time he}} was influenced by Far Eastern landscape paintings and embroideries that had been given to his mother by missionaries returning from China. The few Chinese paintings Watts was able to see in England riveted him, and he wrote [...] "I was aesthetically fascinated with a certain clarity, transparency, and <b>spaciousness</b> in Chinese and Japanese art. It seemed to float...". These works of art emphasized the participatory relationship of man in nature, a theme that stood fast throughout his life, and one that he often writes about. See, for instance, the last chapter in The Way of Zen.|$|E

It is painted with exquisite taste a pure white, for any attempt at ornamentation would mar its graceful and beautiful proportions; and gilding and gingerbread work are used with a sparing and chastened hand in all parts of this splendid vessel.|$|E
2500|$|The Arcade in Providence, Rhode Island {{introduced}} the retail arcade concept to the United States in 1828 and {{is arguably the}} oldest [...] "shopping mall" [...] in the country. The Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II in Milan, Italy followed in the 1870s and is closer to large modern malls in <b>spaciousness.</b> Other large cities created arcades and shopping centers in the late 19th century and early 20th century, including the Cleveland Arcade, and Moscow's GUM, which opened in 1890. When the Cleveland Arcade opened in 1890, it {{was among the first}} indoor shopping arcades in the US, and like its European counterparts, was an architectural triumph. Two sides of the arcade had 1,600 panes of glass set in iron framing and {{is a prime example of}} Victorian architecture. Sydney's Queen Victoria Markets Building, opened in 1898, was also an ambitious architectural project.|$|E
2500|$|In the UK, {{the reviews}} were favourable. Paul Morley of NME praised the album as [...] "honest, direct and distinctive", while Betty Page of Sounds dubbed the band the [...] "young poets of the year". Melody Maker hailed it as a [...] "rich" [...] record, with {{reviewer}} Lyndyn Barber writing that [...] "Boy {{is more than}} just a collection of good tracks assembled in an arbitrary order", and that it had [...] "youthful innocence and confusion". The Guardian wrote that it was a [...] "strong debut album", but that [...] "it only needs slightly stronger melodies to be very impressive". Time Outs critic Ian Birch hailed Boy as a [...] "timely" [...] album and said, [...] "Firing off a tradition laid down by the like of Magazine, [...] the Banshees and Joy Division, U2 have injected their own brand of grace and sinewy <b>spaciousness</b> to create a romanticism exactly right for those who sport chunky riffs and mackintoshes". Declan Lynch of Irish magazine Hot Press remarked that he found Boy [...] "almost impossible to react negatively to".|$|E
2500|$|As {{consumer}} {{per capita}} income increased in the early 1960s, the U.S. automobile market expanded. Whereas American Motors’ profitable marketing strategy under George W. Romney had concentrated on compact, economical cars, Romney's successor as CEO, Roy Abernethy, saw larger, more prestigious and luxurious models as a new profit opportunity. The objective was {{to compete with the}} [...] "Big Three" [...] automobile manufacturers (General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler) by expanding AMC's model lines into additional market segments; particularly by developing a sporty, roomy, 6-passenger sedan that would occupy a unique niche in the market. The idea was that the new car would be a distinctive, low-volume model symbolizing a new Rambler look and spearheading a full product line. To be a distinctive competitor in the big league with the Big Three, it was decided that it should be flashy and intermediate-sized, and in an era when other automakers were stressing the power of muscle cars for their intermediate-sized image vehicles, the new model - the Marlin - was to feature comfort and <b>spaciousness.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{interior}} layout of Hamburg {{was based on}} an axial design, with a central passageway running through the ship on each deck. In order to accomplish this, the funnel uptakes had to be divided. The first notable passenger liner to have featured such a design had been another German ship, SS Vaterland of 1914. <b>Spaciousness</b> was an important factor in interior design, and the feeling of space in the interiors was another reason for the ship's nickname as [...] "The Space Ship". [...] A major factor in establishing this sense of space was the effectively designed galley, restaurant and crew mess complex located in the forward part of decks 4 and 5. The galley was linked by direct vertical cores to service areas on the upper deck lounges, the whole design minimizing the space required for effective catering of the passengers and crew. This space-effective design also dictated that almost all public rooms are located {{at the front of the}} ship (a notable exclusion being the theatre), while all cabins are located on the rear part of the three decks below the promenade deck.|$|E
2500|$|In 1999, Jonathan Romney {{discussed}} Kubrick's {{perfectionism and}} dispelled others' initial arguments {{that the film}} lacked complexity: [...] "The final scene alone demonstrates what {{a rich source of}} perplexity The Shining offers [...] look beyond the simplicity and the Overlook reveals itself as a palace of paradox". Romney further explains:The dominating presence of the Overlook Hotel – designed by Roy Walker as a composite of American hotels visited in the course of research – is an extraordinary vindication of the value of mise en scène. It's a real, complex space that we don't just see but come to virtually inhabit. The confinement is palpable: horror cinema is an art of claustrophobia, making us loath to stay in the cinema but unable to leave. Yet it's combined with a sort of agoraphobia – we are as frightened of the hotel's cavernous vastness as of its corridors' enclosure. ... The film sets up a complex dynamic between simple domesticity and magnificent grandeur, between the supernatural and the mundane in which the viewer is disoriented by the combination of <b>spaciousness</b> and confinement, and an uncertainty as to just what is real or not.|$|E
2500|$|The {{domestic}} {{terminal building}} currently measures [...] and handles 47.4 lakh passengers a year. The revamped {{design of the}} domestic terminal building will accommodate twice as many passengers in a three-storey structure 984ft long. The new design, based on the organisation of security and passenger circulation, centres around two lush, ecologically sustainable gardens each measuring nearly an acre and includes a parking garage with a green roof over 300m long and rainwater capture systems collectively known as the [...] "green gate" [...] of the terminal. Expansive glass curtain walls will be incorporated to boost the feeling of airiness and <b>spaciousness,</b> as will skylights. The new terminal will have three levels. The departure area will be featured on the top level with the arrivals section on ground level. The arrivals section will form the base for airlines and other offices with the basement reserved for luggage scanners. The domestic terminal covers 67,700sqm and will also have a provision of seven gates, two hard-stand hold rooms and 52 check-in counters, besides eight counters for e-ticketing. The international terminal will cover 59,300sqm with the provision of two gates with multiple hard-stand hold rooms, 52 check-in counters, eight counters for e-ticketing, 18/10 immigration/Custom counters for handling passenger arrival and 18/4 immigration/Custom counters for outgoing passengers.

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1850s, Lathers {{decided to build}} a number of [...] "investment" [...] houses on {{a portion of his}} {{property}} which was later named [...] "Lathers Woods". Once again he retained his friend Davis the architect for this project which included a total of four homes, [...] three of them designed in 1858 (including [...] "Tudor Villa", [...] "The Rambler" [...] and [...] "Gothic Cottage"), and one the following year in 1859 ("Pointed Villa"). The homes were well planned for <b>spaciousness</b> and dignity of interior effect considering their not extravagant dimensions. [...] In 1890, the artist Frederick Remington purchased one of these cottages from which he created his estate and studio where he lived most of his artistic career. The Remingtons' substantial gothic revival house located at 301 Webster Avenue, featured a sweeping lawn which sloped south toward Long Island Sound, providing views on three sides of the countryside. Remington called it [...] "Endion", an Algonquin word meaning [...] "the place where I live". [...] Remington and his wife, Eva, moved to New Rochelle in 1890, three years after he had begun his professional career as an illustrator and painter. The community was close to New York City affording easy access to the publishing houses and galleries necessary for the artist, and also rural enough to provide him with the space he needed for horseback riding, and other physical activities that relieved the long hours of concentration required by his work. Moreover, an artists' colony had grown up in the town, so that the Remingtons counted among their neighbors writers, actors, and artists such as Augustus Thomas, also from Lathers Hill, and Francis Wilson, Julian Hawthorne, Edward Kemble.|$|E
