5|$|In the Catch 'Em Mode, players must {{reveal a}} {{silhouette}} of a Pokémon by hitting bumpers. Once it is revealed, players must hit the Pokémon that appears three times with the ball as it sits in one spot before the time runs out. Egg Mode is a similar concept, though the baby Pokémon roam around the board as opposed to standard Pokémon, which stand still. As opposed to being timed, players must capture it before it returns from whence it came. Evolution Mode is also similar, requiring players to hit all of the evolution item markers in order to evolve their Pokémon that they have caught or hatched. These include several traditional means of evolution in the Pokémon series, such as stones and experience points. Lastly, Travel Mode allows players to leave the current location on their pinball board, allowing them to capture more kinds of Pokémon {{not found in the}} current area. Ruby & Sapphire featured additional bonus modes that often diverge from the standard gameplay. These modes sometimes feature rare Pokémon such as Groudon, Kyogre, and Rayquaza, and take place on separate fields. Outside of the gameplay, players may also view the Pokémon they have caught, listen to sound effects and music from the game, and view their high <b>scores</b> <b>for</b> <b>each</b> board.|$|E
25|$|Points (terminology {{of which}} differs from {{variation}} to variation) are obtained by matching the winning hand with different criteria scoring different values. The points obtained may be modified into <b>scores</b> <b>for</b> <b>each</b> player using some (typically exponential) functions. Some criteria may be also {{in terms of}} both points and score.|$|E
25|$|After {{the three}} rounds have been {{completed}} and final scores tabulated, the individual place <b>scores</b> <b>for</b> <b>each</b> dancer are read in public and simultaneously revealed on video displays throughout the venue.

25|$|The current {{measure of}} Mayer and Salovey's model of EI, the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT) {{is based on}} a series of emotion-based {{problem-solving}} items. Consistent with the model's claim of EI as a type of intelligence, the test is modeled on ability-based IQ tests. By testing a person's abilities on each of the four branches of emotional intelligence, it generates <b>scores</b> <b>for</b> <b>each</b> of the branches as well as a total score.|$|E
25|$|The {{highest and}} lowest <b>scores</b> <b>for</b> <b>each</b> finalist are dropped, the {{remaining}} seven scores are added together, {{and the top}} three scores designate the second runner-up, first runner-up, and winner, International Mr. Leather. A tie for the title is resolved by adding to the tally the dropped scores of the two contestants; if the stalemate continues then each of the nine judges must vote for {{only one of the}} contestants in question.|$|E
25|$|The judge's {{highest and}} lowest <b>scores</b> <b>for</b> <b>each</b> {{contestant}} in each criteria are dropped, and the contestant's remaining seven scores are tallied {{to determine the}} 20 contestants with the highest combined scores to proceed as finalists at the Sunday IML contest event. The only time that the dropped scores {{are included in the}} tally is when there is a tie for the 20th place; the contestants in question have their dropped scores included in the tally but if the stalemate continues then each of the nine judges must vote for only one of the two contestants. Preliminary judging scores are not carried forward. There are also two tally masters.|$|E

25|$|Once he had {{finished}} work on the theme demos, Sawano created the score for orchestra and band. He created the broader orchestral elements on his computer, adding the smaller layers and elements himself so he had complete control over how the score evolved. To help with this, {{he went to a}} music copyist and had them create <b>scores</b> <b>for</b> <b>each</b> individual instrument. After creating the main theme and the core musical themes, he then moved on {{to the rest of the}} soundtrack—estimated at over ninety tracks—over three different periods during production. Due to Takahashi's liking for Sawano's music, Sawano had the freedom to stick to his musical style. The score was directed and co-produced by Legendoor's Yasushi Horiguchi, who was brought on board the project alongside Sawano.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, the only mode available is Lammy's Solo mode. After clearing a level with Lammy (except Stage 1), the player unlocks Co-op and Vs. modes for Lammy and Rammy. These modes can be played with a second player, or one player with a computer partner (with the option to use one controller for both available after completing all Co-op levels), controlling Lammy (purple line) and Rammy (black line) with play alternating between the two. In Co-op mode, the two players must play harmoniously to progress, with points and rank changes determined by how well they both performed (e.g. if Player 1 performs slightly well on a line but Player 2 performs really badly on the next, the result will be a negative score and a rank drop.) Conversely in Vs. mode, players must try to outperform each other, with points earned or depleted depending on the differences between each player's <b>scores</b> <b>for</b> <b>each</b> set of lines. Completing Lammy's solo mode also unlocks Parappa's Solo mode, in which players control Parappa as he uses rap skills in his own interpretations of each of the stages.|$|E

500|$|Just as in {{traditional}} D games, the player starts {{by building a}} party of up to six characters, deciding the race, sex, class and ability <b>scores</b> <b>for</b> <b>each.</b> The player's party is enlisted to help the settled {{part of the city}} by clearing out the marauding inhabitants that have taken over the surroundings. The characters move on from one area to another, battling bands of enemies as they go and ultimately confronting the powerful leader of the evil forces. During play the player characters gain experience points, which allow them to increase their capabilities. The game primarily uses a first-person perspective, with the screen divided into sections to display pertinent textual information. During combat sequences, the display switches to a top-down [...] "video game isometric" [...] view.|$|E
