2500|$|In {{recent years}} {{a number of}} {{instrument}} builders have started lines of [...] "high-end," [...] hand-made whistles, which can cost hundreds of dollars US each — expensive in comparison to cheap whistles, but nevertheless cheaper than most other instruments.

2500|$|Elsewhere, {{animals have}} widely {{been used as}} [...] "milk siblings" [...] for infants to toughen the nipples and {{maintain}} the mother's milk supply. In Persia and Turkey puppies were used for this purpose. The same method was practiced in the United States in the early 19th century; William Potts Dewees recommended in 1825 that from the eighth month of pregnancy, expectant mothers should regularly use a puppy to harden the nipples, improve breast secretion and prevent inflammation of the breasts. The practice seems to have fallen out of favour by 1847, as Dewees suggested using a nurse or some other <b>skilled</b> <b>person</b> {{to carry out this}} task rather than an animal. Tribal peoples around the world have used many types of animals for the same purpose. Travelers in Guyana observed native women breastfeeding a variety of animals, including monkeys, opossums, pacas, agoutis, peccaries and deer. Native Canadians and Americans often breastfed young dogs; an observer commented that the Pima people of Arizona [...] "withdrew their breasts sooner from their own infants than from young dogs." ...|$|E
50|$|This was a {{feudal system}} made {{to keep the}} youth of society away from {{learning}} such skills. According to this system the <b>skilled</b> <b>persons</b> became slaves to the feudal landlords and the agricultural castes, who were rewarded with lands and territories as they were loyal to Britain rather than their own people. The assets of these <b>skilled</b> <b>persons</b> were seized or awarded to feudal Chiefs and their relatives. The people belonging to these castes were deprived of some rights like government jobs, sale and purchase of property (exceeding a particular limit), education, etc. Due to this act the respectable became the most reviled in the society. Their profession became their caste {{for more than two}} centuries. So the title of small caste was given by the British to the <b>skilled</b> <b>persons</b> of the society belonging to the major castes of the society.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the link between}} ethnicity and the choice of residing in ethnically segregated neighborhoods. Data drawn from the National Longitudinal Surveys of Youth show that there exist strong human capital externalities both within and across ethnic groups. As a result, the segregation choices made by particular households depend both on the household's economic opportunities and on aggregate characteristics of the ethnic groups. The evidence suggests that highly <b>skilled</b> <b>persons</b> who belong to disadvantaged groups have lower probabilities of ethnic residential segregation relative to the choices made by the most <b>skilled</b> <b>persons</b> in the most skilled groups. ...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: With {{the opening}} {{up of the}} South African economy, {{following}} its successful democratisation and adherence to a strict programme of trade liberalisation, the number of highly-skilled (professionals, managers and technicians) persons employed showed strong growth, {{while the number of}} less <b>skilled</b> <b>persons</b> in employment declined (Whiteford & van Seventer, 1999 : 3). Unemployment remains one of the major macroeconomic problems facing this country. The official unemployment rate in September 2005 was 26, 7 per cent (Statistics South Africa, 2006 a: iv). In spite of the recent positive news on the unemployment front, the foreseeable future is evidenced by large numbers of unemployed people. Department of HE and Training approved lis...|$|R
