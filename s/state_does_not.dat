5|$|As of 2005, South Dakota has {{the lowest}} per capita total state tax rate in the United States. The <b>state</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> levy {{personal}} or corporate income taxes, inheritance taxes, or taxes on intangible personal property. The state sales tax rate is 4.5 percent. Various localities have local levies so in some areas the rate is 6 percent. The state sales tax {{does not apply to}} sales to Indians on Indian reservations, but many reservations have a compact with the state. Businesses on the reservation collect the tax and the state refunds to the Indian Tribes the percentage of sales tax collections relating to the ratio of Indian population to total population in the county or area affected. Ad valorem property taxes are local taxes and are a large source of funding for school systems, counties, municipalities and other local government units. The South Dakota Special Tax Division regulates some taxes including cigarette and alcohol-related taxes.|$|E

25|$|Critics {{counter that}} {{although}} few fragments of chariots {{have been found}} in the Middle East, there are many images of ancient chariots on pottery and frescoes and in many sculptures of Mediterranean origin, thus confirming their existence in those societies.

25|$|In the United States, {{each state}} {{department}} of education determines if the needs of gifted students will be addressed as a mandatory function of public education. If so, the state determines the definition of which students will be identified and receive services, but {{may or may not}} determine how they shall receive services. If a <b>state</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> consider gifted education mandatory, individual districts may, thus the definition of what gifted is varies from state or district.|$|E

25|$|The <b>state</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> control {{university}} syllabuses, {{but it does}} influence admission procedures {{through the}} Office for Fair Access (OFFA), which approves and monitors access agreements to safeguard and promote fair access to higher education. The independent Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education inspects universities to assure standards, advises on the granting of degree awarding powers and University title, and maintains the Quality Code for Higher Education, which includes the Framework for Higher Education Qualification. Unlike most degrees, the state has control over teacher training courses, and standards are monitored by Ofsted inspectors.|$|E

25|$|In 2012, the State of Utah {{passed the}} Utah Transfer of Public Lands Act {{in an attempt}} to gain control over a {{substantial}} portion of federal land in the state from the federal government, based on language in the Utah Enabling Act of 1894. The <b>State</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> intend to use force or assert control by limiting access {{in an attempt to}} control the disputed lands, but does intend to use a multi-step process of education, negotiation, legislation, and if necessary, litigation as part of its multi-year effort to gain state or private control over the lands after 2014.|$|E
25|$|Firstly, certain {{costs are}} {{difficult}} to avoid and are shared by everyone, such as the costs of housing, pensions, education and health care. If the <b>state</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> provide these services, then for those on lower incomes, the costs must be borrowed and often those on lower incomes {{are those who are}} worse equipped to manage their finances. Secondly, aspirational consumption describes the process of middle income earners aspiring to achieve the standards of living enjoyed by their wealthier counterparts and one method of achieving this aspiration is by taking on debt. The result leads to even greater inequality and potential economic instability.|$|E
25|$|To {{create a}} {{population}} inversion under these conditions, {{it is necessary}} to selectively remove some atoms or molecules from the system based on differences in properties. For instance, in a hydrogen maser, the well-known 21cm wave transition in atomic hydrogen, where the lone electron flips its spin state from parallel to the nuclear spin to antiparallel, can be used to create a population inversion because the parallel state has a magnetic moment and the antiparallel <b>state</b> <b>does</b> <b>not.</b> A strong inhomogeneous magnetic field will separate out atoms in the higher energy state from a beam of mixed state atoms. The separated population represents a population inversion which can exhibit stimulated emissions.|$|E
