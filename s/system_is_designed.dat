5|$|GM {{recommends}} that a Volt battery fire be fought with water rather than dry chemicals, and rates the Volt battery as having no explosion or electrocution hazard {{as the result}} of a collision. The high-voltage <b>system</b> <b>is</b> <b>designed</b> to shut down automatically in the event of an airbag deployment, and to detect a loss of communication from an airbag control module. During the Volt development the lithium-ion battery pack was subjected to a wide range of tests, including overcharge, discharge, vibration, excessive heat and cold, short circuit, humidity, fire, crush, water immersion, salt water immersion, and nail penetration.|$|E
5|$|Since its return, {{the tournament}} has used an unusual point scoring system. As with most league competitions, three points are awarded for a win, {{one for a}} draw and zero for a loss. An {{additional}} point, however, is awarded for each goal scored. The <b>system</b> <b>is</b> <b>designed</b> to reward teams that adopt a more attacking style of play. Each entrant plays two matches, with the winner being the club that finishes {{at the top of}} the table. The original competition was held at De Meer, Ajax's home between 1934 and 1996. The Amsterdam Arena has played host to the event since its return.|$|E
40|$|Authentication <b>systems</b> <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> to {{give the}} right person access to an organization's {{information}} system and to restrict it from the wrong person. Such <b>systems</b> <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> by IT professionals to protect an organization's assets (e. g., the organization's network, database, or other information). Too often, such <b>systems</b> <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> around technical specifications without regard for the end user. We argue that doing so may actually compromise a system's security.

5|$|The {{architecture}} of the Xgrid <b>system</b> <b>is</b> <b>designed</b> around a job based system; the controller sends agents jobs, and the agents return the responses. The actual computation that the controller executes in an Xgrid system {{is known as a}} job. The job contains all the files required to complete the task successfully, such as the input parameters, data files, directories, executables and/or shell scripts, the files included in an Xgrid job must be able to be executed either simultaneously or asynchronously, or any benefits of running such a job on an Xgrid is lost. Once the job completes, the controller can be set to notify the client of the task's completion or failure, for example by email. The client can leave the network while the tasks are running. It can also monitor the job status on demand by querying the controller, although it cannot track the ongoing progress of individual tasks.|$|E
5|$|The game {{featured}} advanced {{artificial intelligence}} {{due to the}} inclusion of the game's squad command system. Adams and Lugo will assist Walker in battles and react to the battle situation accordingly even if they are not given any orders. They will also analyse the situation when instructed and decide the best approach to defeat enemies. The battle command system was designed to be accessible and easy to use, so that players would not have {{to spend a lot of}} time managing the squad. Lugo and Adams may get severely injured and if both of them die, the game ends. This mechanic prompts the player to rescue them as quickly as possible, and the <b>system</b> <b>is</b> <b>designed</b> to create tense situations. The AI for enemies is affected by various factors, including visibility and hearing.|$|E
5|$|The {{growth in}} Commercial Air Transport (CAT) has eroded the {{operational}} freedom of GA, {{both in the}} air and on the ground at larger airports. Difficulty with access to larger airports is compounded by a {{decline in the number of}} aerodromes generally, and existing sites are often threatened with closure and re-development for more profitable uses. The UK planning <b>system</b> <b>is</b> <b>designed</b> to focus on local issues, and consideration of the national impact of GA operations is not within its remit. This makes aerodrome development difficult, often subjecting those that successfully negotiate the process to restrictions in use.|$|E

5|$|Before any {{products}} are sold, the company pre-cooks the ingredients and holds {{them in a}} heated holding cabinet. To ensure that product consistency is maintained and {{to reduce the amount}} of products discarded as waste, Burger King utilizes a computerized monitoring system created by Integrated Control Corp, or ICC. The system, called Kitchen Minder, monitors time and temperature in the cabinets and notifies staff and managers when to prepare more food and discard older products. Initially developed from 1998 to 2000, the <b>system</b> <b>is</b> <b>designed</b> to work with a holding cabinet system that was developed by Duke. The initial test designs were time-consuming to program because each bay in the holding units had to be programmed manually. This meant several minutes were required for each product, which added up to several hours to program up to six units with eight bays each. When BK finally deployed the system in 2001, the updated units utilized a Palm Pilot to configure the units using a custom program designed to easily configure the units via Infrared or serial port. A kitchen flow software system that helps centralize information about the system was deployed in 2007; combined with the new equipment, it helped further reduce costs for the company and its franchises by calculating projected sales and actual usage. Along with the holding system, Burger King deployed newer high-speed toasters to decrease make times; the new toasters, while faster, require more maintenance, which increases overall labor costs.|$|E
