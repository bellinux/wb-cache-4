50|$|By exposing part of {{the winding}} coils and making the {{secondary}} connection through a sliding brush, a continuously variable turns ratio can be obtained, allowing for very smooth control of output voltage. The output voltage {{is not limited to}} the discrete voltages represented by actual number of turns. The voltage can be smoothly varied between turns as the brush has a relatively high resistance (compared with a metal contact) and the actual output voltage is a function of the relative area of brush in contact with adjacent windings. The relatively high resistance of the brush also prevents it from acting as a <b>short</b> <b>circuited</b> <b>turn</b> when it contacts two adjacent turns. Typically the primary connection connects to only a {{part of the}} winding allowing the output voltage to be varied smoothly from zero to above the input voltage and thus allowing the device to be used for testing electrical equipment at the limits of its specified voltage range.|$|E
50|$|Rotating {{magnetic}} fields {{are also used}} in induction motors. Because magnets degrade with time, induction motors use short-circuited rotors (instead of a magnet) which follow the rotating magnetic field of a multicoiled stator. In these motors, the <b>short</b> <b>circuited</b> <b>turns</b> of the rotor develop eddy currents in the rotating field of the stator which in turn move the rotor by Lorentz force. These types of motors are not usually synchronous, but instead necessarily involve a degree of 'slip' in order that the current may be produced due to the relative movement {{of the field and}} the rotor.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} PMSM under <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> in <b>turns</b> at different speed and torque values. PMSM in a healthy state and under fault conditions is simulated at different working points using a Flux 2 D, two-dimensional (2 -D) finite element analysis (FEA). Currents and flux density are presented and their harmonic content is obtained. In addition, harmonics content is compared to one obtained from a healthy motor. This paper applies the appropriate tools for determining the fault condition from the current analysis as Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) with Wigner Ville Distribution (WVD). The EMD and WVD are used to fault detection in the operation range of PMSM. Simulated and experimental stator current spectra from healthy and faulty machines are obtained and compared. I...|$|R

In fact, for the modelling of stationary defects such as <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> between <b>turns</b> in the same phase, we introduce only in the matrix the coefficients of resistance and inductance of stator and in the mutual inductance stator-rotor. These coefficients take account the number of turns in short-circuit deducted from the total number of turns in the same phase; in this way we obtain the number of useful turns. In addition, all these faults involved, will be used for the creation of the database that will be used to develop an automated system failures of the induction machine...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{commercial}} aircraft {{are becoming increasingly}} dependent on electrical power. More {{and more of the}} systems traditionally powered by hydraulics or pneumatics are being migrated to run on electricity. One consequence of the move towards electrical power is the increase in the storage capacity of the bat- teries used to supplement the power generation. The increase in battery size increases the maximum stress that a <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> failure can put on the power distribution system. Although such failures are extremely rare, the fail safe switches in the distribution system must be capable of handling extremely high energy <b>short</b> <b>circuits</b> and <b>turning</b> off the power to protect the electrical systems from damage. Traditionally aircraft have used electromechanical relays in this role. However, they are large, heavy and slow to switch. As the potential power level is increased, the slow switching becomes more of a problem. The solution is a semiconductor switch. An IGBT can handle the high <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> currents and switches fast enough to prevent <b>short</b> <b>circuits</b> damaging key systems. However, the inherent voltage drop in the forward current path significantly reduces its efficiency during nominal operation. A power MOSFET would be considerably more efficient than an IGBT during nominal operation. However, during high current surges, the ohmic behaviour of the switch leads to extremely high power loss and thermal failure. In this thesis a solution to this problem is presented. A new class of semiconductor device is proposed that has the highly efficient low current performance of the power MOSFET and the high current handling capability of the IGBT. The device has been named the Hybrid Unipolar Bipolar Field Effect Transistor or HUBFET. The HUBFET operates in unipolar mode, like a MOSFET, at low currents and in bipolar mode, like an IGBT, at high currents. The structure of the HUBFET is a merging of the MOSFET and IGBT. It is a vertical device with a traditional MOS gate structure, however the backside consists of alternating regions of both N-type and P-type doping. Through simulation the key on-state characteristics of the HUBFET have been shown. Fabricated test modules have been tested to validate the simulations and to show how the HUBFET can dynamically transistion from unipolar to bipolar mode during a <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> event. Following the proof of concept the pattern of implants on the backside of the device that give the HUBFET its characteristic were investigated and potential improvements to the design were identified...|$|R

Copper sulfide, which is formed when the corrosive sulfur in a mineral oil reacts with the copper conductors, {{is likely to}} diffuse into the paper tapes insulating the conductors. Since copper sulfide is partially conducting, the dielectric losses of the contaminated oil-impregnated-paper tapes are markedly increased; paper tapes {{in close proximity to}} the copper conductors are found to attain tan delta values > 1. 0 even at room temperature. It is highly likely that thermal instabilities develop at those sites at operating temperatures, leading to increased loss currents and, ultimately, <b>short</b> <b>circuits</b> between the <b>turns.</b> This sequence of events is substantiated by evidence from the field, which indicates large areas of thermally degraded insulations and charred breakdown regions along the coils, the extent of which becomes more pronounced at higher operating temperatures (toward the top of the windings) ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: This paper studies dynamic {{characteristics}} of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> in the pulsed current {{gas metal arc}} welding (GMAW-P). Design/methodology/approach: Welding experiments with different values of pulsing parameter and simultaneous recording of high speed camera pictures and welding signals (such as current and voltage) were used to identify different <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> conditions in GMAW-P. The investigation is based on the synchronization of welding signals and high speed camera to characterize different types of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> occurring in GMAW-P system. The behaviour of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> under the influence of different pulsing conditions is also investigated. Findings: It will be shown in the paper that <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> in GMAW-P occurs in different forms which can be categorized depending upon time of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> and phase (peak or base time) of the pulse. Further investigation involves study of the dynamic behaviour of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> with variation of different pulsing parameters. Research limitations/implications: The results show that by varying the pulse parameters, behaviour of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> in GMAW-P is changed. The pulse parameters can be adjusted to avoid occurrence of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> in GMAW-P. Future work should concentrate on development of practical indices in terms of pulse welding parameters for quantitative estimation of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> occurrence and avoidance. Originality/value: Determination of proper working parameters with GMAW-P is crucial for the appropriate selection of pulse welding parameters. As short-circuiting is common between the welding electrode and the workpiece in GMAW-P, so in order to estimate the working parameters and ensure stable GMAW-P understanding dynamic behaviour of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> in GMAW-P will be useful.

The investigation is based on the measurement of welding signals specifically current and voltage signals and their synchronization with high speed camera to investigate the <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> phenomenon in GMAW-P process. Findings: The results reveal that <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> can be detected using signal processing techniques and its severity can be predicted by using statistical models and artificial intelligence techniques in GMAW-P process. Research limitations/implications: Several factors are responsible for <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> occurrence in GMAW-P process.

Since <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> currents have strong nonlinear relation with decision variables of candidate transmission lines, current power grid planning models have defects of heavy computational burden and low solution accuracy. In an actual power grid planning project, instead of embedding constraints in the grid planning model, <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> currents are calculated after determining {{the power grid}} planning result.
