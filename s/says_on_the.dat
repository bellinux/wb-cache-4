According to Sankar Ghose, the announcement shook Gandhi, who reappraised his views and wrote many essays with {{his views on}} castes, inter-marriage and what Hinduism <b>says</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> subject. These views contrasted with those of Ambedkar. In actual elections of 1937, except for some seats in Mumbai where Ambekar's party won, India's untouchables voted heavily in favour of Gandhi's campaign and his party, the Congress.|$|E

500|$|The {{compilation}} received generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Music journalist Robert Christgau gave a positive review, stating that Madonna [...] "gleans goodies from the overrated Bedtime Stories and Ray of Light, mixes in the glorious soundtrack-only 'Beautiful Stranger' and the dismal soundtrack-only 'Don't Cry for Me Argentina', {{and hands it}} all over to Mirwais for sonic tweaking I'm not interested enough to pin down", while calling it as [...] "an essential package". A writer from the South Wales Echo gave a positive review, saying that GHV2 is [...] "an essential pop album" [...] and [...] "truly immaculate". MusicOMH's Michael Hubbard complimented the inclusion of [...] "Don't Cry For Me Argentina" [...] from Evita and [...] "Beautiful Stranger" [...] from the Austin Powers sequel , saying that they [...] "are worthy inclusions... compiling this collection didn't require much imagination, the end result does the job—the CD is exactly what it <b>says</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tin." ...|$|E

[...] Susannah Wells used the opportunity to ask how long Squires and her family were supposed to have been at the house, and was answered by Hall [...] "They were there six or seven weeks in all; they had been there about a fortnight before the young woman was brought in". [...] Amongst others, Thomas Colley and Mrs Canning also gave testimony. [...] Canning's former employer, John Wintlebury, told the court how he had deduced that it was Wells's house where Canning had been held. [...] Mary Myers and James Lord also claimed to have heard Canning say [...] "Wills or Wells", as did Robert Scarrat, a hartshorn-rasper and previously a servant in nearby Edmonton who had visited Wells's house on previous occasions.|$|E

500|$|He {{returned}} into non-League football {{after he}} signed for Conference National club Rushden & Diamonds in June 2006 on a two-year contract. He joined Torquay United of League Two on loan in September 2006 as {{cover for the}} injured Mickey Evans, but was recalled by Rushden due to an injury crisis in early November 2006. He had made five appearances for Torquay. Days later, he signed for another League Two club, Shrewsbury Town, originally on a two-month loan deal. His Shrewsbury debut came as a 60th-minute substitute in a 2–0 away defeat to Milton Keynes Dons on 18 November 2006, after hoping {{he would be able}} to play in the FA Cup tie against Hereford United. The loan was extended to the end of 2006–07 in January 2007. Following Shrewsbury's 2–0 home win over Notts County in February 2007, manager Gary Peters referred to Fortune-West as 'Ronseal', as he does [...] "exactly what it <b>says</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tin". His final appearance for Shrewsbury came in the 2007 League Two play-off Final against Bristol Rovers at Wembley Stadium on 26 May 2007, coming on as a substitute in the 80th-minute, as Shrewsbury lost 3–1. With the season over, Fortune-West returned to his parent club Rushden, who he left by mutual consent in August 2007.|$|E

Jeffries' view was shared by Mark Beaumont of NME who also deemed the song [...] "infectious", and Matt Jost of RapReviews.com who called it [...] "simply fun". Rory Cashin of Entertainment.ie described its production as [...] "overwhelmingly busy in a good way". In a State publication, Cashin deemed it a [...] "warped earworm" [...] and a [...] "belter". Rap-Up hailed it as Azalea's [...] "new anthem", and felt it was timed for the summer to [...] " [...] up the dancefloor". Similarly, Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly opined that the song was [...] "thumping" [...] and [...] "a thoroughbred entry in the song-of-summer race", while Juliana June Rasul of The Straits Times said it was [...] "a perfect summer pop song". In a publication for The Atlantic, Nolan Feeney highlighted it as a [...] "colorful butt-shaker".

500|$|The Huffington Post {{published}} {{a response from}} practising Muslim Afroze Zaidi-Jivraj, a graduate in English who had recently begun a masters degree student in theology at the University of Birmingham. She remarked that Holland's methodology was flawed because he had neglected to study the corpus of material on early Islamic history found in libraries across the Islamic world, instead using only sources he had obtained in Western libraries. She argued {{that he did not}} consult a single Islamic scholar of Islamic history, instead choosing the more [...] "exotic" [...] option of interviewing a Bedouin, and that although he had consulted Professor Seyyed Hossein Nasr– [...] "a token Muslim voice"– Nasr was a scholar of Islamic philosophy and not Islamic history. Asserting that Islam: The Untold Story was based on poor scholarship by assuming the superiority of secular Western historical inquiry over Islamic historical traditions, she argued that it would promote negative views of [...] "an already poorly-understood faith and its much-maligned adherents." [...] Abdullah al-Andalusi of the Muslim Debate Initiative sums Islam: the Untold Story as [...] "a missed opportunity to transcend an outdated Besserwissen approach to comparative religion, and to establish an inter-faith dialogue based on insightful mutual understanding and acceptance of who we are today. While informed revisionist readings of the history of all faiths, Islam included, is to be encouraged, Tom Holland’s TV show, an anti-Islamic polemic dressed up as history, does not do what it <b>says</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tin. In reality it’s just more post-9/11 telly fodder, a continuation of the Clash of Civilizations by other means." ...|$|E

500|$|Hopkins was {{generally}} expected to reprise his Academy Award-winning role. Hopkins did say in June 1999 {{that he would}} only be interested if the script was [...] "really good". Hopkins <b>says</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> making-of feature on DVD that he couldn’t {{make up his mind}} to commit. [...] "I was kind of surprised by this book, Hannibal. I thought it was really overreaching and so bizarre. So I couldn’t make up my mind about it all. Some of it I found intriguing, some I was a little doubtful about." [...] When the producers confirmed {{that they were going to}} film Harris' novel, Hopkins told them yes, but added: [...] "It needs some condensing." [...] The Hollywood Reporter would confirm that Hopkins had agreed to reprise his role in late December 1999, saying he had approved the latest [...] of the script by Steven Zaillian. Hopkins said he had no difficulty moving back into [...] "Lecter's mind". [...] "I just learned the lines and showed up and walked around as Hannibal Lecter. I thought, 'Do I repeat that same performance, or do I vary it?' Ten years had passed so I changed a bit." [...] In the book, Lecter uses bandages to disguise himself as a plastic surgery patient. This was left out of the film because Scott and Hopkins agreed to leave the face alone. Hopkins explains why: [...] "It's as if he's making a statement—'catch me if you can'. With his big hat, he's so obvious that nobody thinks he's Hannibal Lecter. I've always thought he's a very elegant man, a Renaissance man." [...] In the film, Lecter is first seen in Florence [...] "as the classical Lecter, lecturing and being smooth", according to Hopkins. When the film moves to the U.S., Hopkins changed his appearance by building up muscle and cropping his hair short [...] "to make him like a mercenary, that he would be so fit and so strong that he could just snap somebody in two if they got... in his way".|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly Chris Willman {{awarded the}} show an A- rating, and commended Knowles' ability {{to sing and}} dance simultaneously. Similarly, Shaheem Reid of MTV News commented, [...] "There are few (very few) ladies out there who can really sing, a lot who can dance, a lot more who look good — but really no other who can combine all three and add iconic star power like Miss Knowles, arguably the best {{all-around}} stage performer in the game right now." [...] J. Freedom du Lac of The Washington Post praised the concert's fast pace and called it a [...] "pure pop spectacle" [...] further describing it as [...] "brilliant... fiery". He noted that the opening, was with a [...] "dramatic, over-the-top entrance about which every aspiring diva dreams", but however he was disappointed in the show's ending. He further wrote, [...] "Though Beyoncé owned the spotlight, this being her 'Experience' and all, her band co-starred in the show, playing hard and tight behind the singer and vamping expertly for sustained periods whenever Beyoncé left the stage to change." [...] The Daily Mail John Aizleman {{was impressed with the}} high energy Knowles showed during the performance, and lauded the dance choreography, particularly that of [...] "Bills, Bills, Bills". However, Aizleman criticized the appearance of a dancer dressed as an angel at the end of [...] "Flaws and All" [...] as being awkward, and wrote that that moment was reminiscent of a [...] "misguided school nativity play". He further added, [...] "Big, brave and bold, the Beyoncé Experience is how pop music would work if it were choreographed by Busby Berkeley... If anyone had the temerity to doubt Beyoncé's star quality and her place in the diva pantheon, they would doubt no more after last night." [...] Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe wrote in her review that the tour title reminded her of a concert theme park rid and added [...] " [...] was an elaborate affair. It was part Vegas review, part hard-edged rock concert, part sweaty funk and soul revival, part diva concert hall performance, and almost all fun to watch as the singer threw herself into the various settings and costumes". Eamon Sweeney from the Irish Independent described Knowles' performance as [...] "the best pop show on the planet" [...] adding that the title of the tour [...] "does exactly what it <b>says</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tin". David Schmeichel of Jam! wrote that the [...] "Splashy Beyonce 'experience' gives a lesson in diva-hood for pop princesses everywhere", further praising her [...] "goddess" [...] like entrance, vocals and performance which he desrcibed as [...] "tightly scripted as her film forays". Ashante Infantry of the Toronto Star noted that the concerts served as a testament to Knowles' talent and power and compared her with [...] Prince for the versatility and musicianship and Tina Turner for the sass and sheer power. Herald Sun Cameron Adams also compared Knowles' performing ability to that of Prince, and stated, [...] "Beyoncé is an old-fashioned, all- round entertainer." [...] Jim Harrington writing for San Jose Mercury News graded the tour as an A-plus affair. A writer of The StarPhoenix praised the show, writing that Knowles [...] "set the stage on fire" [...] for two hours. The writer also added that she had [...] "an honest, God-given talent she's not afraid to share. Her songs, ranging from sultry to soulful were performed with all her heart... With a clear passion for showmanship and a voice not easily matched, Beyonce simply bypassed the mediocrity of most concerts and took her performance to another level." [...] Arielle Castillo of Miami New Times heavily praised Knowles' performance, writing that [...] "B performed like her life depended on it; fresh to death choreography, flawless vocals, crazysexy wardrobe and her trademark lioness mane all in A+ form... Beyonce gave the crowd all that they expected, and multiplied that by 1000." [...] She concluded her review by writing that the concert was reminiscent of a Las Vegas show due to the elaborate costumes, sets, and [...] "over-the-topness of the whole thing" [...] further praising Knowles for acting, dancing and singing on stage.|$|E

2500|$|Even {{though he}} was mentored by Democritus, Protagoras did not share his enthusiasm for the pursuit of mathematics.

[...] Protagoras was skeptical about the application of theoretical mathematics to the natural world; he did not believe they were really worth studying at all. [...] According to Philodemus, Protagoras said that [...] "The subject matter is unknowable and the terminology distasteful". [...] Nonetheless, mathematics was considered to be by some a very viable form of art, and Protagoras <b>says</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> arts, [...] "art (tekhnê) without practice and practice without art are nothing" [...] (Stobaeus, Selections 3.29.80).|$|E

The song was originally recorded for the Cast of Thousands record but omitted from the final album as the band felt it did not fit; the political lyrics suited the Warchild compilation. In 2009 Elbow contributed their cover of U2's [...] "Running to Stand Still" [...] to War Child Presents Heroes. Garvey explained: [...] "When the band first met each other aged 17, Mark and Craig's father Gareth would lend us his Volvo to get our gear around.
