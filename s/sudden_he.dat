Chao P. asks Kiyoaki to return him his emerald ring from the marquis's safe-keeping; he has not received a letter from Ying Chan in months, and is pining for her. Kiyoaki tears up the one last letter he receives from Satoko. One day, his mother leaves for the Ayakura villa in order to congratulate the family, casually informing him that the marriage to Prince Harunori will now definitely go ahead. All of a <b>sudden</b> <b>he</b> feels emotionally shattered, and spends the next few hours in a daze. This is the turning point of the novel.|$|E
500|$|During {{this period}} Chamberlin {{struggled}} with substance abuse. [...] During {{the recording of}} 1993's Siamese Dream in Marietta, Georgia, Chamberlin often disappeared {{for days at a}} time into the drug underworld of Atlanta, while the rest of the band feared for his life. He later said of his drug addiction that [...] "It's pretty textbook [...] Guy makes it in rock band, gets very full of himself, starts thinking he's indestructible, and all of a <b>sudden</b> <b>he</b> destroys himself." ...|$|E
500|$|American Pharoah's gentle {{demeanor}} is also distinctive, {{in that he}} is fond {{of people}} and, particularly for a young racehorse, surprisingly calm around them. As Baffert explained, [...] "Horses of his caliber are not that nice and sweet. They're just sort of tough. If I brought Bayern out here, you can't get near him, he's too aggressive. 's just so different than any horse I've ever had." [...] He was not always so calm, described initially as [...] "a {{little bit of a}} headcase," [...] but Baffert explained that after his anxiety-ridden first race, people worked with him, schooling him in the track paddock for about two weeks, when [...] "all the <b>sudden</b> <b>he</b> got really sweet and really mellow." ...|$|E

500|$|... "The Negotiation" [...] {{was written}} by supervising {{producer}} Michael Schur and directed by Jeffrey Blitz. It featured {{the end of the}} story arc featuring Roy Anderson's attempt to win back Pam, his former fiancée. Roy's portrayer, David Denman, reported he was [...] "really grateful" [...] that executive producer Greg Daniels allowed his character to develop, [...] "where all of a <b>sudden,</b> <b>he</b> wasn’t just a complete idiot but felt bad for being a bad boyfriend and wanted to try to get the girl back. It’s so rare to have that on a television show, because so often everyone wants you to be the same character every week. It was quite refreshing creatively to get to do that." [...] Referring to Jim and Pam, Denman felt it was [...] "inevitable that Romeo and Juliet had to get together" [...] and end the series' love triangle. [...] "Otherwise," [...] he explained, [...] "it gets kind of tiring and old. I think it was the appropriate time , and I had such a great experience working with all those guys." [...] Denman also added that Daniels' decision stemmed from a desire to advance the Jim–Pam storyline [...] "to the next stage," [...] rather than having anything to do specifically with Denman himself. Denman briefly returned in the series' fifth, seventh, and ninth seasons.|$|E
2500|$|During his American sojourn, Léger {{began making}} {{paintings}} in which freely arranged bands {{of color are}} juxtaposed with figures and objects outlined in black. Léger credited the neon lights of New York City {{as the source of}} this innovation: [...] "I was struck by the neon advertisements flashing all over Broadway. You are there, you talk to someone, and all of a <b>sudden</b> <b>he</b> turns blue. Then the color fades—another one comes and turns him red or yellow." ...|$|E
2500|$|The second show I {{ever saw}} of the Descendents {{was at the}} Dancing Waters in San Pedro. They broke into the set and he was playing guitar so hard and so angry that his pants fell down. He was an odd character, for sure. I can {{remember}} standing in line at a Misfits show {{and all of a}} <b>sudden</b> <b>he</b> just sat down on the ground and started holding his head like his ears were ringing or something, and said something to the effect of [...] "What am I doing here?

2500|$|Zhang Jingchuan, a Chinese mountaineer {{who survived}} the assault, {{described}} his ordeal in a press-conference held at Kunming in the Yunnan province of China. He recalled the attack being <b>sudden.</b> <b>He</b> {{said that he was}} shot at and a bullet flew over his head. After that, he stated he got out and started running blindly towards a trench [...] away. Upon reaching the trench he jumped in and stayed there for 40 minutes. After that he snuck out and made {{his way back to the}} cabin, where he called the police from a satellite phone. According to Zhang, a helicopter arrived nine hours after the incident, at first light, during which time he had grabbed an ice-axe and had moved to higher ground. Zhang Jingchuan also noted that before shooting the climbers, the attackers collected the climbers' passports and took their photos.|$|E
2500|$|On February 1, 2011, Sondheim joined former Salt Lake Tribune theatre critic Nancy Melich {{before an}} {{audience}} of 1,200 at Kingsbury Hall. Melich described the evening: He was visibly taken by the university choir, who sang two songs during the evening, [...] "Children Will Listen" [...] and [...] "Sunday", {{and then returned to}} reprise [...] "Sunday". During that final moment, Sondheim and I were standing, facing the choir of students from the University of Utah's opera program, our backs to the audience, and I could see tears welling in his eyes as the voices rang out. Then, all of a <b>sudden,</b> <b>he</b> raised his arms and began conducting, urging the student singers to go full out, which they did, the crescendo building, their eyes locked with his, until the final [...] "on an ordinary Sunday" [...] was sung. It was thrilling, and a perfect conclusion to a remarkable evening – nothing ordinary about it.|$|E
2500|$|One {{recurring}} {{mention is}} of a changeling or faerie {{who has a}} prodigious talent for music. The author (or the teller) of the tale states that the faerie has a particular flair {{when it comes to}} musical instruments, traditionally the fiddle or the pipes. He develops such a gift that anyone who listens will be enchanted by the music (like the Greek myth of the sirens). Commenting on the appearance of the faerie, the story teller recounts that he saw him living with two old brothers beyond the [...] "dogs well" [...] and he looked like a [...] "wizened wee monkey" ...the story teller estimates his age to be around 10 or 11 years but it appears that he could still could not walk, rather, [...] "bobbed". His gift on the tin whistle was second to none, his particular penchant being long-forgotten tunes. All of a <b>sudden</b> <b>he</b> disappeared, never to be heard of by the story-teller again.|$|E

2500|$|Dettori {{sent the}} colt into the lead {{soon after the}} start and set the pace from Highland Reel, Pleascach, Free Eagle and Found. Two furlongs from the finish Free Eagle made a forward move but as he {{challenged}} the favourite, Golden Horn veered to the right, hampering his challenger. Golden Horn kept on well in the closing stages to win by a length from Found, who stayed on to deprive Free Eagle of second. Following an inquiry by the racecourse stewards the result was allowed to stand. Dettori said [...] "It was a stellar field and he was showing what a good horse he is. Pat [...] came to me then I gave {{him a couple of}} cracks and I got the measure of him and I thought, right, come on, let’s go home. All of a <b>sudden,</b> <b>he</b> just took a right turn. He must have seen something". Gosden offered the view that the horse had swerved because of the shadow cast across the course by the grandstand.|$|E
2500|$|I {{had these}} pieces, these guitar pieces, that I {{wanted to put}} together. I had a whole idea {{of a piece of}} music that I really wanted to try and present to {{everybody}} and try and come to terms with. Bit difficult really, because it started on acoustic, and as you know it goes through to the electric parts. But we had various run-throughs [...] where I was playing the acoustic guitar and jumping up and picking up the electric guitar. Robert was sitting in the corner, or rather leaning against the wall, and as I was routining the rest of the band with this idea and this piece, he was just writing. And all of a <b>sudden</b> <b>he</b> got up and started singing, along with another run-through, and he must have had 80% of the words there ... I had these sections, and I knew what order {{they were going to go}} in, but it was just a matter of getting everybody to feel comfortable with each gear shift that was going to be coming.|$|E
2500|$|British rock critic Nick Kent wrote that, {{sometime}} in the mid-1960s: [...] "Wilson began getting wrapped up in big complicated ideas like 'Art' and 'Civilization'. People would tell him the most commonplace facts about such-and-such a composer or painter and Brian would just flip right out ... A visitor would read a fragment from a volume of Omar Khayyam and Brian Wilson would leap up, his head just awash with all this magical dumb inspiration, screaming 'Wow' and 'Too much' {{over and over again}} because he sensed right there and then that this guy had access to all the answers to the problems besetting our troubled universe. According to unnamed participants of the Smile sessions, [...] "If you came up to the house and introduced something new to Brian's thought processes–astrology, a different way to think about the relationship of Russia to China, anything at all–if all of a <b>sudden</b> <b>he</b> was into that, it would find its way into the music. You could hear a bit and say, 'I know where that feeling came from.'" [...] Tony Asher remembers that Wilson [...] "exhibit this awful taste. His choice of movies, say, was invariably terrible. ... every four hours we'd spend writing songs, there'd be about 48 hours of these dopey conversations about some dumb book he'd just read. Or else he'd just go on and on about girls." ...|$|E

2500|$|Nearly {{two years}} later, Carey was named referee of Super Bowl XLII. On working the NFL's {{championship}} game, Carey {{said it was}} a [...] "personal honor" [...] and understood the historical significance of being the first African American referee. On the significance of the event, he {{said it was a}} [...] "great sign of the evolution of our society that all barriers are eroding". During the fourth quarter, Carey's judgment was a factor in one of the important plays of the game. On third down, with just over a minute left in regulation, New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning received the snap in a shotgun formation and looked to pass the ball. New England Patriots defenders Richard Seymour, Jarvis Green, and Adalius Thomas grabbed and attempted to tackle Manning. Manning escaped the two defenders and threw a 32-yard pass to wide receiver David Tyree. Under NFL rules, officials are required to stop play when a player is [...] "in the grasp and control" [...] of the defense. Carey determined that [...] "grasp and control" [...] was never achieved since Manning's forward momentum did not stop. Speaking about the play, Carey said, [...] "I anticipated a sack. I didn't assume that was going to happen, but rarely do you see a quarterback escape when he's got that much weight on his back and being dragged by two or three guys who had a hold of him. I could see [...] head was just straight ahead. He was trying to break free with desperation. Then all of a <b>sudden</b> <b>he</b> spun out and then he started to come right back at me." ...|$|E

5000|$|Nesmith's {{departure}} from the tour was acrimonious. Jones was quoted by the Los Angeles Times as complaining that Nesmith [...] "made a new album with us. He toured Great Britain with us. Then all of a <b>sudden,</b> <b>he's</b> not here. Later, I hear rumors he's writing a script for our next movie. Oh, really? That's bloody news to me. He's always been this aloof, inaccessible person... the fourth part of the jigsaw puzzle that never quite fit in." ...|$|R
60|$|And then, {{all of a}} <b>sudden,</b> <b>he</b> stopped, and his {{jaw dropped}} {{as though he had}} remembered something.|$|E
