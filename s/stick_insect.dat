5|$|One of {{the most}} {{contentious}} issues amongst islanders {{in the 21st century}} is {{what to do about the}} rodent situation. Rodents have only been on the island since a ship ran aground in 1918 and have wiped out several endemic bird species and were thought to have done the same to the Lord Howe Island <b>stick</b> <b>insect.</b> There is a plan to drop 42 tonnes of rat bait across the island but the community is heavily divided.|$|E
5|$|Tourist {{accommodation}} {{ranges from}} luxury lodges to apartments and villa units. The currency is the Australian dollar, {{and there are}} two banks. There are no camping facilities on the island and remote-area camping is not permitted. To protect the fragile environment of Ball's Pyramid (which carries the last remaining wild population of the endangered Howe Island <b>stick</b> <b>insect),</b> recreational climbing there is prohibited. No pets are allowed without permission from the Board. Islanders use tanked rainwater, supplemented by bore water for showers and washing clothes.|$|E

50|$|Stick mantises {{should not}} be {{confused}} with <b>stick</b> <b>insects</b> (Phasmatodea) although the latter were long-considered close relatives of all mantises according to classification which is now often considered paraphyletic and outdated.

500|$|Compared {{to other}} <b>stick</b> <b>insects</b> (order Phasmatodea), the genus Timema is {{considered}} basal; that is, the earliest [...] "branch" [...] to diverge from the phylogenetic tree that includes all Phasmatodea. To emphasize this outgroup status, all <b>stick</b> <b>insects</b> {{not included in}} Timema are sometimes described as [...] "Euphasmatodea." ...|$|R
5|$|The Lord Howe Island <b>stick</b> <b>insect</b> {{disappeared}} from the main island soon after the introduction of rats in 1918. In 2001 a tiny population was discovered in a single Melaleuca howeana shrub {{on the slopes of}} Ball's Pyramid, has been successfully bred in captivity, and is nearing re-introduction to the main island. The Lord Howe stag beetle is a colourful endemic beetle seen during summer months. Another endemic invertebrate, the Lord Howe flax snail (or Lord Howe Placostylus), has also been affected by the introduction of rats. Once common, the species is now endangered and a captive breeding program is under way to save the snail from extinction.|$|E
5|$|Swaying {{behaviour}} is practised by highly cryptic {{animals such as}} {{the leafy}} sea dragon and the <b>stick</b> <b>insect</b> Extatosoma tiaratum. These animals resemble vegetation with their coloration, strikingly disruptive body outlines with leaflike appendages, {{and the ability to}} sway effectively like the plants that they mimic. E. tiaratum actively sways back and forth or side to side when disturbed or when there is a gust of wind, with a frequency distribution like foliage rustling in the wind. This behaviour may represent motion crypsis, preventing detection by predators, or motion masquerade, promoting misclassification (as something other than prey), or a combination of the two, and has accordingly also been described as a form of motion camouflage.|$|E
5|$|Movement {{catches the}} eye of prey animals {{on the lookout for}} predators, and of predators hunting for prey. Most methods of crypsis {{therefore}} also require suitable cryptic behaviour, such as lying down and keeping still to avoid being detected, {{or in the case of}} stalking predators such as the tiger, moving with extreme stealth, both slowly and quietly, watching its prey for any sign they are aware of its presence. As an example of the combination of behaviours and other methods of crypsis involved, young giraffes seek cover, lie down, and keep still, often for hours until their mothers return; their skin pattern blends with the pattern of the vegetation, while the chosen cover and lying position together hide the animals' shadows. The flat-tail horned lizard similarly relies on a combination of methods: it is adapted to lie flat in the open desert, relying on stillness, its cryptic coloration, and concealment of its shadow to avoid being noticed by predators. In the ocean, the leafy sea dragon sways mimetically, like the seaweeds amongst which it rests, as if rippled by wind or water currents. Swaying is seen also in some insects, like Macleay's Spectre <b>stick</b> <b>insect,</b> Extatosoma tiaratum. The behaviour may be motion crypsis, preventing detection, or motion masquerade, promoting misclassification (as something other than prey), or a combination of the two.|$|E

25|$|Pierce {{is known}} for his {{distinctive}} voice and, like his Frasier co-star, Kelsey Grammer, is often called upon to provide voice work.

Pierce refused credit for his Hellboy role because he felt it was the performance of Doug Jones, and not his own voice, which ultimately brought the character of Abe Sapien to life. He was the voice for Drix, a cold pill, in the animated comedy Osmosis Jones.|$|E
500|$|Mantises {{are among}} the insects most widely kept as pets. Because the {{lifespan}} of a mantis is only about a year, {{people who want to}} keep mantises often breed them. In 2013 at least 31 species were kept and bred in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and the United States. [...] In 1996 at least 50 species were known to be kept in captivity by members of the Mantis Study Group. The Independent described the [...] "giant Asian praying mantis" [...] as [...] "part <b>stick</b> <b>insect</b> with a touch of Buddhist monk", and stated that they needed a vivarium around 30cm (12in) on each side.

Both {{the north and south}} sections of the island are high ground of relatively untouched forest, in the south comprising two volcanic mountains, Mount Lidgbird (...) and Mount Gower which, rising to , is the highest point on the island. The two mountains are separated by the saddle at the head of Erskine Valley. In the north, where most of the population live, high points are Malabar (...) and Mount Eliza (...) [...] Between these two uplands is an area of cleared lowland with some farming, the airstrip, and housing. The Lord Howe Island Group of islands comprises 28 islands, islets and rocks.

60|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} how cases like these begin to arise, {{we must remember that}} first of all they start of necessity from very slight and indefinite resemblances, which succeed as it were by accident in occasionally eluding the vigilance of enemies. Thus, there are stick insects which only look like long round cylinders, not obviously stick-shaped, but rudely resembling a bit of wood in outline only. These imperfectly mimetic insects may often obtain a casual immunity from attack by being mistaken for a twig by birds or lizards. There are others, again, in which natural selection has gone a step further, so as to produce upon their bodies bark-like colouring and rough patches which imitate knots, wrinkles, and leaf-buds. In these cases the protection given is far more marked, and the chances of detection are proportionately lessened. But sharp-eyed birds, with senses quickened by hunger, the true mother of invention, must learn at last to pierce such flimsy disguises, and suspect a <b>stick</b> <b>insect</b> in the most innocent-looking and apparently rigid twigs. The final step, therefore, consists in the production of that extraordinary actor, the Xeroxylus laceratus, whose formidable name means no more than 'ragged dry-stick,' and which really mimics down to the minutest particular a broken twig, overgrown with mosses, liverworts, and lichens.|$|E
