5|$|In this treatise, Archimedes {{counts the}} number of grains of <b>sand</b> <b>that</b> will fit inside the universe. This book {{mentions}} the heliocentric theory {{of the solar system}} proposed by Aristarchus of Samos, as well as contemporary ideas {{about the size of the}} Earth and the distance between various celestial bodies. By using a system of numbers based on powers of the myriad, Archimedes concludes that {{the number of}} grains of sand required to fill the universe is 8 in modern notation. The introductory letter states that Archimedes' father was an astronomer named Phidias. The Sand Reckoner or Psammites is the only surviving work in which Archimedes discusses his views on astronomy.|$|E
5|$|The {{metropolitan}} areas of Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and West Palm Beach {{are located on}} a rise in elevation along the eastern coast of Florida, called the Eastern Coastal Ridge, that was formed as waves compressed ooids into a single formation. Along the western border of the Big Cypress Swamp is the Immokolee Ridge (or Immokolee Rise), a slight rise of compressed <b>sand</b> <b>that</b> divides the runoff between the Caloosahatchee River and The Big Cypress. This slight rise in elevation {{on both sides of}} the Everglades creates a basin, and forces water that overflows Lake Okeechobee to creep toward the southwest.|$|E
5|$|The {{waters in}} which Kimberella dwelt were {{occasionally}} disturbed by sandy currents, caused when sediments were whipped up by storms or meltwater discharge, and washed over the creatures. In {{response to this}} stress, the organisms appear to have retracted their soft parts into their shells; apparently they could not move fast enough to outrun the currents. Some organisms survived the current, and attempted to burrow out of the <b>sand</b> <b>that</b> had been deposited above them; some unsuccessful attempts can be seen where juveniles were fossilised {{at the end of}} a burrow a few centimetres long.|$|E

5|$|The {{remains of}} Kronan lie {{at a depth}} of 26m (85ft), 6km (3.7mi) east of Hulterstad, off the east coast of Öland. Since her rediscovery in 1980, there have been annual diving expeditions {{to the site of the}} wreck from June to August. By Baltic Sea standards, the {{conditions}} are good for underwater archaeological work; the wreck site is far from land, away from the regular shipping lanes, and has not been affected by pollution from the land or excessive growth of marine vegetation. The visibility, especially in early summer, is good and can be up to 20m. The seabed consists of mostly infertile <b>sand</b> <b>that</b> reflects much of the sunlight from the surface, aiding the surveying and documentation of the site with underwater cameras. Around 85% of the wreck site has been charted so far and Kronan has become one of the most extensive and well-publicized maritime archaeological projects in the Baltic Sea.|$|E
25|$|Black {{vitreous}} {{fragments of}} fused <b>sand</b> <b>that</b> had been solidified {{by the heat}} of the explosion were described from French test site in Algeria (Reggane site).|$|E
25|$|<b>Sand</b> <b>that</b> {{is blown}} {{by the wind}} inland to form sand dunes usually develop on shorelines where there is {{suitably}} strong winds. This can be a major sink for the sediment budget of a shoreline.|$|E

5000|$|For <b>sands</b> <b>that</b> can be {{compressed}}, e.g.: bentonite-bonded sand, {{also known}} as green sand, a compressed or rammed sample is used to check permeability.|$|R
25|$|Stabiliser: Lime or magnesia. In Anglo-Saxon glass {{the main}} {{stabiliser}} was lime. This {{may have been}} deliberately added to the glass batch, but may simply have been {{a component of the}} <b>sand</b> <b>that</b> was used. Roman writer Pliny stated that sand from the River Belus was particularly suitable for glass-making, this is a calcareous sand, rich in marine shells, and therefore lime.|$|E
25|$|Fine silica <b>sand</b> <b>that</b> {{is covered}} in a thin (3–6%) {{thermosetting}} phenolic resin and liquid catalyst is dumped, blown, or shot onto a hot pattern. The pattern is usually made from cast iron and is heated to 230 to 315°C (450 to 600°F). The sand is allowed {{to sit on the}} pattern for a few minutes to allow the sand to partially cure.|$|E
25|$|The {{validity}} of these theories {{depends on the}} identity of the original founders of the city: as recently as 2000, archaeological research has not found remains dating from the 11th/12th century within the limits of the modern city given the difficulty of excavating through metres of <b>sand</b> <b>that</b> have buried the remains over the past centuries. Without consensus, the etymology of Timbuktu remains unclear.|$|E

25|$|Sydney {{is made up}} {{of mostly}} Triassic rock with some recent igneous dykes and {{volcanic}} necks. The Sydney Basin was formed when the Earth's crust expanded, subsided, and filled with sediment in the early Triassic period. The <b>sand</b> <b>that</b> was to become the sandstone of today was washed from Broken Hill and laid down about 200 million years ago. The sandstone has shale lenses and fossil riverbeds.|$|E
25|$|Two major natural {{disasters}} that affected East Hampton include the Hurricane of 1938 and Hurricane Carol, in 1954, {{both of which}} found the Atlantic Ocean splitting the town in two at Napeague. The 1938 storm also washed up so much <b>sand</b> <b>that</b> the Cedar Point Lighthouse, which had been on an island, became connected to the mainland. The 1954 storm also toppled the MacKay Radio towers at Napeague.|$|E
25|$|The {{sand and}} gravel {{terraces}} {{are made up of}} pebbles with flint, quartz and quartzite. In places, there are deposits of brickearth, which is a mixture of clay and <b>sand</b> <b>that</b> has supported London's long-standing brick-making industry. On top of these natural layers are the deposits of hundreds of years of human occupation. In the oldest parts the City of London and the City of Westminster this layer can be up to 6 metres deep.|$|E

50|$|It is the {{striking}} white and fine <b>sands</b> <b>that</b> form the dunes of this area, {{at the intersection}} of Rio de la Plata and the mouth of the Solís Chico which give it its name.|$|R
25|$|Theba pisana usually {{lives in}} coastlands, {{in or near}} sandy habitats. In hot climates it aestivates often {{directly}} exposed to the sun, attached to grasses, shrubs or succulent plants, fence posts, tall weeds, and so on. It is common near beaches. In dunes it can live on nearly bare <b>sand</b> <b>that</b> is poorly fixed in place by grasses. In colder regions the snails do not aestivate, but they do climb on plants in dry weather. This snail does not survive serious winter frosts.|$|E
25|$|This {{sediment}} then {{enters the}} coastal system and is transported by longshore drift. A {{good example of}} the sediment budget and longshore drift working together in the coastal system is inlet ebb-tidal shoals, which store <b>sand</b> <b>that</b> has been transported by long shore transport. As well as storing sand these systems may also transfer or by pass sand into other beach systems, therefore inlet ebb-tidal shoal systems provide a good sources and sinks for the sediment budget.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} material characteristic is the sediment grain size, which must closely match the native material. Excess silt and clay fraction (mud) versus the natural turbidity in the nourishment area disqualifies some materials. Projects with unmatched grain sizes performed relatively poorly. Nourishment <b>sand</b> <b>that</b> {{is only slightly}} smaller than native sand can result in significantly narrower equilibrated dry beach widths compared to sand {{the same size as}} (or larger than) native sand. Evaluating material fit requires a sand survey that usually includes geophysical profiles and surface and core samples.|$|E
50|$|Yellow dunes are <b>sand</b> dunes <b>that</b> develop {{after the}} first set of embryo dunes appear. With an average depth of about 5m, with a soil to <b>sand</b> ratio <b>that</b> is small on the soil side (hence yellow dunes).|$|R

50|$|The Long Sand: The open {{expanse of}} desert <b>sands</b> <b>that</b> {{stretches}} across the Desert princedom. There is no water for miles, nor any {{shelter from the}} burning sun. The Long Sand {{is home to the}} Isulk'im, whom roam the Desert.|$|R
25|$|Singletary Lake {{is one of}} {{a series}} of Carolina bay lakes that stretch from New Jersey to Florida along the Atlantic Coastal Plain. Exactly how the lakes were formed remains a mystery. What is known is that Singletary Lake is not fed by any stream but relies entirely upon rain. The land beneath and {{surrounding}} the lake is mica-rich sandy clay and <b>sand</b> <b>that</b> is from the Upper Cretaceous era with a thin layer of Pleistocene deposits covering it. This land is lower than the surrounding land and drains very poorly, creating Singletary Lake.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, NYC Parks {{received}} a $6.3 million gift for improvements to Pelham Bay Park and twenty other parks around the city. NYC Parks {{used the money}} to renovate trails and clean up weeds. A renovation of Orchard Beach started in 1995, with a new sand-filling project to replace the <b>sand</b> <b>that</b> had been lost since the last such project in 1964. A proposal for a water park at Orchard Beach was revealed {{as part of a}} plan to bring visitors back to the beach. That proposal was effectively canceled in 1999 due to large opposition from City Island residents.|$|E
25|$|The {{island has}} rainforests, {{eucalyptus}} woodland, mangrove forests, wallum and peat swamps, sand dunes and coastal heaths. It {{is made up}} of <b>sand</b> <b>that</b> has been accumulating for approximately 750,000 years on volcanic bedrock that provides a natural catchment for the sediment which is carried on a strong offshore current northwards along the coast. Unlike on many sand dunes, plant life is abundant due to the naturally occurring mycorrhizal fungi present in the sand, which release nutrients in a form that can be absorbed by the plants. Fraser Island is home to a small number of mammal species, as well as a diverse range of birds, reptiles and amphibians, including the occasional saltwater crocodile. The island is protected in the Great Sandy National Park.|$|E
5000|$|When a new {{island was}} formed in the 1973 eruption, that was called Nishinoshima Shintō (literally, [...] "New Nishinoshima Island"), but due to erosion and {{shifting}} <b>sands,</b> <b>that</b> island joined the main island and {{ceased to be a}} separate entity.|$|R
50|$|Mauritania {{has four}} {{ecological}} zones: the Saharan Zone, the Sahelian Zone, the Senegal River Valley, and the Coastal Zone. Although the zones are markedly {{different from one}} another, no natural features clearly delineate the boundaries between them. Sand, varying in color and composition, covers 40 percent of {{the surface of the}} country, forming dunes that appear in all zones except the Senegal River Valley. Fixed sand dunes are composed of coarse, fawn-colored sand, while shifting ("mobile") dunes consist of fine, dustlike, reddish-colored <b>sands</b> <b>that</b> can be carried by the wind. Plateaus generally are covered with heavier blue, gray, and black <b>sands</b> <b>that</b> form a crusty surface over layers of soft, loose sand.|$|R
50|$|Within Bunge Land and the {{southwest}} corner of Kotelny Island, relatively unconsolidated sediments ranging in age from Early Cretaceous to Holocene overlie the above folded and faulted sedimentary rocks. The oldest of these sediments are Early Cretaceous alluvial clays, silts, and <b>sands</b> <b>that</b> contain layers of conglomerate, tuff, tuffaceous sandstone, coal, and, at top, rhyolite. The Late Cretaceous sediments are overlain by Late Eocene to Pliocene alluvial <b>sands</b> <b>that</b> contain layers of clay, silt, gravel, brown coal, and lignitized wood. The vast majority of Bunge Land is blanketed by Early Holocene marine sediments. Only in the central and southern parts of Bunge Land do either Late to Early Pleistocene marine sediments or very small patches of highly weathered Prequaternary deposits and bedrock underlie the surface.|$|R
