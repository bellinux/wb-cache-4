40|$|Preventing stock-out in a {{replenishment}} system, {{in which}} customer demand rates are stochastic with constant averages, {{can be accomplished}} via <b>safety</b> <b>stocks</b> hold at each customer. These <b>safety</b> <b>stocks</b> should be replenished back to their initial levels each time they are used. However, sometimes it occurs that a truck {{does not have enough}} capacity to carry the amount of the product the visited customers need to restore their <b>stocks</b> and <b>safety</b> <b>stocks</b> to their required levels. Therefore, the carried extra amount of the product, intended to replenish <b>safety</b> <b>stocks,</b> should be divided amongst the customers in some optimal or fair manner. To achieve this fair allocation, we propose and analyze two policies, the first called Fair-share and the second Ratio methods. Details on how these two methods are implemented, to achieve the level of service expected at each customer, are discussed and illustrated. In addition a simulation model is developed and used to compare the performance of each policy in the long run...|$|R

50|$|The {{amount of}} <b>safety</b> <b>stock</b> an {{organization}} chooses {{to keep on}} hand can dramatically affect their business. Too much <b>safety</b> <b>stock</b> can result in high holding costs of inventory. In addition, products which are stored for too long a time can spoil, expire, or break during the warehousing process. Too little <b>safety</b> <b>stock</b> can result in lost sales and, thus, {{a higher rate of}} customer turnover. As a result, finding the right balance between too much and too little <b>safety</b> <b>stock</b> is essential.|$|E
50|$|<b>Safety</b> <b>stock</b> {{is used as}} {{a buffer}} to protect {{organizations}} from stockouts caused by inaccurate planning or poor schedule adherence by suppliers. As such, its cost (in both material and management) is often seen as a drain on financial resources that results in reduction initiatives. In addition, time-sensitive goods such as food, drink, and other perishable items could spoil and go to waste if held as <b>safety</b> <b>stock</b> for too long. Various methods exist to reduce safety stock: these include better use of technology, increased collaboration with suppliers, and more accurate forecasting. In a lean supply environment, lead times are reduced, which can help minimize <b>safety</b> <b>stock</b> levels, thus reducing the likelihood and impact of stockouts.Due to the cost of <b>safety</b> <b>stock,</b> many organizations opt for a service level-led <b>safety</b> <b>stock</b> calculation; for example, a 95% service level could result in stockouts, but is at a level that is acceptable to the company. The lower the service level, the lower the requirement for <b>safety</b> <b>stock.</b>|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} aimed at filling the gap between theory and {{practice}} in the area of <b>safety</b> <b>stocks</b> under MRP environments. It is focused on providing a new methodology for dimensioning an overall buffer against uncertainty in market demand, which often plagues SMEs – that act as sub-contractors or suppliers within large projects or they have a reduced bargaining power – and adversely affects their performances. The proposed methodology suggests to split the amount of <b>safety</b> <b>stocks,</b> as dimensioned according to the traditional methodology, in “new” <b>safety</b> <b>stocks</b> to face the “usual ” demand variance and in “strategic ” stocks, to face peaks in market demand. To this purpose, a set of recommended guidelines is reported to effectively dimension and position <b>safety</b> and/or strategic <b>stocks</b> within products bills of materials and manufacturing pipelines. Finally, a case study is reported, where the benefits for the company coming from the adoption of the new proposed methodology lie in achieving the 95 % target service level even under peak demand conditions, being the value of <b>safety</b> <b>stocks</b> as a whole grown only by about 20 %.

40|$|International audience—The Guaranteed-Service Model (GSM) aims at {{determining}} the optimal placement {{and amount of}} <b>safety</b> <b>stocks</b> in a guaranteed-service supply chain. In the GSM, <b>safety</b> <b>stocks</b> are used to protect against demand variability up to specified demand bounds. The model does not address what happens when demand exceeds these bounds while in practice, companies might take extraordinary measures to handle the excess demand. For guaranteed-service supply chains, assessing the service level that results from carrying <b>safety</b> <b>stocks</b> is crucial to estimate the real frequency of extraordinary measures to be deployed. In the GSM literature, demand bounds are usually {{defined in terms of}} Cycle-Service-Level (CSL).

In this work, we integrate the impact of demand variability in a location-inventory model.

50|$|An Enterprise Resource Planning system (ERP system) {{can also}} help an {{organization}} reduce its level of <b>safety</b> <b>stock.</b> Most ERP systems provide a type of Production Planning module. An ERP module such as this can help a company develop highly accurate and dynamic sales forecasts and sales and operations plans. By creating more accurate and dynamic forecasts, a company reduces their chance of producing insufficient inventory for a given period and, thus, {{should be able to}} reduce the amount of <b>safety</b> <b>stock</b> that they require. In addition, ERP systems use established formulas to help calculate appropriate levels of <b>safety</b> <b>stock</b> based on the previously developed production plans. While an ERP system aids an organization in estimating a reasonable amount of <b>safety</b> <b>stock,</b> the ERP module must be set up to plan requirements effectively.|$|E
50|$|With a new product, <b>safety</b> <b>stock</b> can be {{utilized}} {{as a strategic}} tool until the company can judge how accurate their forecast is {{after the first few}} years, especially when used with a material requirements planning worksheet.

With a material requirements planning (MRP) worksheet a company can judge how much they will need to produce to meet their forecasted sales demand without relying on <b>safety</b> <b>stock.</b> However, a common strategy is to try and reduce the level of <b>safety</b> <b>stock</b> to help keep inventory costs low once the product demand becomes more predictable. This can be extremely important for companies with a smaller financial cushion or those trying to run on lean manufacturing, which is aimed towards eliminating waste throughout the production process.|$|E

30|$|In the {{following}} section, we extend the CLSP-L model formulation of Suerie and Stadtler (2003) as presented in Meistering and Stadtler (2017). First, we incorporate <b>safety</b> <b>stocks</b> {{depending on the}} production cycle length (subsequently called dynamic) to better cope with demand uncertainty. Therefore, <b>safety</b> <b>stocks</b> are determined internally by the model, corresponding to the actual production cycle length, which might vary in the planning interval. Note that <b>safety</b> <b>stocks</b> for different cycle lengths must be provided to the model as data. Thus, they must be determined in advance for every product j, period t and production cycle length τ ^T. Second, the looking beyond the planning horizon approach of Stadtler (2000) {{is applied to the}} model formulation to reduce the truncated horizon effect. Third, soft-capacity constraints are used to ensure feasibility, even if capacity is insufficient. As the complexity of the extended CLSP-L is still high, we split the planning interval to reduce complexity. Only the first part (t= 1,...,t^L) considers linked lot sizes, while t=t^L+ 1,...,t̅ neglects them. Thus, the top-level model is a mixture of an extended CLSP-L and an extended CLSP.|$|R

40|$|Supply Chain Management (SCM) {{has become}} a popular topic in recent years. One of the main {{discussion}} points is the effective management of inventories along the supply chain. Several inventory policies have been analyzed and compared to overcome the traditional tradeoff between high service levels and high inventory costs and vice versa. This paper describes how different demand data aggregation affects reorder point calculations in continuous inventory review systems and analyzes the impact on inventories, <b>safety</b> <b>stocks,</b> and service levels of the supply chain members. Based on a linear three-stage supply chain, four different forecasting scenarios based on simple means and variance calculations as well as moving average and moving variance estimations have been tested. To analyze potential effects for different supply chain settings, four demand patterns were implemented (stationary, season, trend, trend and season). The simulations reveal different effects depending on demand data aggregation and customer demand structure. Since the assumption of normally distributed demand data is violated for upstream suppliers in linear supply chains, difficulties arise particularly in calculating <b>safety</b> <b>stocks.</b> Aggregating order data can mitigate some of the biases in several cases. It is shown that forecasting monthly aggregated orders outperforms the other strategies in terms of lower mean inventories and <b>safety</b> <b>stocks,</b> but may lead to slightly lower service levels. ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{size of the}} <b>safety</b> <b>stock</b> {{depends on}} the type of {{inventory}} policy that is in effect. An inventory node is supplied from a [...] "source" [...] which fulfills orders for the considered product after a certain replenishment lead time. In a periodic inventory policy the inventory level is checked periodically (such as once a month) and an order is placed at that time as to meet the expected demand until next order. In this case, the <b>safety</b> <b>stock</b> is calculated considering the demand and supply variability risks during this period plus the replenishment lead time. If the inventory policy is continuous policy (such as an Order point-Order Quantity policy or an Order Point-Order Up To policy) the inventory level is continuously monitored and orders are placed with freedom of time. In this case, <b>safety</b> <b>stock</b> is calculated considering the risk of only the replenishment lead time. If applied correctly, continuous inventory policies can lead to smaller <b>safety</b> <b>stock</b> whilst ensuring higher service levels, in line with lean processes and more efficient overall business management.|$|E

This allocation process depends heavily on such problem characteristics as demand variation, cost structure, and lead-time structure. The introduction of capacity constraints shows that the bottleneck processes are dictating the planning.
