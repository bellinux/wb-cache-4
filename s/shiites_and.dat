5|$|Producers chose {{boys who}} were {{students}} of Tariq bin Ziad High School. The school was {{holding on to the}} notion of a united Iraq, even as the country was becoming increasingly racially and religiously segregated. Having worked in Iraq in 2003, Winter knew that the Baghdad district Karrada was mixed and integrated with high numbers of <b>Shiites</b> <b>and</b> Christians. She asked her former driver and translator, who had attended the school, if he would contact the principal. Initially the school was suspicious of their intentions, but decided to trust the judgement of Winter's translator. Principal Ra'ad Jawad selected eight boys {{to take part in the}} documentary because he knew they could be discreet about making the documentary, would not get bored, and would remain committed to filming their lives for a year. The producers wanted their cast to include girls, and had found a school and families willing to take part in the documentary, but the then-Minister of Education refused to let them take part. Jawad travelled to London to meet the producers and he was trained to operate the video cameras that the boys were to use. The cameras and tapes were sent into Iraq via the BBC News department, which were then passed onto the school. Jawad and two Iraqi associate producers trained the boys how to use the cameras. Two months into filming, four of the boys dropped out of the project, leaving Hayder Khalid, Anmar Refat, Ali Shadman, and Mohammad Raed. O'Mahoney and Winter never met the boys while the documentary was being produced because it was such a high-risk assignment.|$|E
25|$|After the Iranian Revolution, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini {{endeavored}} {{to bridge the}} gap between <b>Shiites</b> <b>and</b> Sunnis by declaring it permissible for Twelvers to pray behind Sunni imams and by forbidding criticizing the Caliphs who preceded Ali—an issue that had caused much animosity between the two groups. In addition, he designated the period of Prophet's Birthday celebrations from 12th to the 17th of Rabi Al-Awwal as the Islamic Unity Week. (There being a gap in the dates of when <b>Shiites</b> <b>and</b> Sunnis celebrate Muhammad's Birthday). However, this harmony was short lived.|$|E

25|$|Baghdad's {{population}} {{was estimated at}} 7.22 million in 2015. The city historically had a predominantly Sunni population, by the early 21st century around 82% of the city's population were Iraqi Shia. At {{the beginning of the}} 21st century, some 1.5 million people migrated to Baghdad, most of them <b>Shiites</b> <b>and</b> a few Sunnis.|$|E
25|$|According to Louis Massignon {{there are}} many {{different}} attitudes among <b>Shiites</b> <b>and</b> Sunnis about the Mubahalah. One of those disagreements is in terms of the approving of the verse of Quran on Mubahalah whether the verse III, 54 was with the presence of the five persons such as Fatima. According to Shia sources not only Mubahala happened with the presence of Fatima but also Fatima considered as someone who is standing back of prophet. In other words, some mystical sects refer to the symbolic role during that event. They try to interpret her as an image. This image shows a lighting matter. Some sects such as Nusayrieh believes that the Christians of Najran acknowledge to the place of Fatima as Maryam.|$|E

25|$|US and Iraqi {{officials}} accused AQI {{of trying}} to slide Iraq into a full-scale civil war between Iraq's majority <b>Shiites</b> <b>and</b> minority Sunni Arabs, with an orchestrated campaign of civilian massacres {{and a number of}} provocative attacks against high-profile religious targets. With attacks such as the 2003 Imam Ali Mosque bombing, the 2004 Day of Ashura and Karbala and Najaf bombings, the 2006 first al-Askari Mosque bombing in Samarra, the deadly single-day series of bombings in which at least 215 people were killed in Baghdad's Shiite district of Sadr City, and the second al-Askari bombing in 2007, they provoked Shiite militias to unleash a wave of retaliatory attacks, resulting in death squad-style killings and spiraling further sectarian violence which escalated in 2006 and brought Iraq to the brink of violent anarchy in 2007. In 2008, sectarian bombings blamed on al-Qaeda in Iraq killed at least 42 people at the Imam Husayn Shrine in Karbala in March, and at least 51 people at a bus stop in Baghdad in June.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{assassination}} of Gemayel in September 1982, Israel's position in Beirut became untenable and the signing of a peace treaty became increasingly unlikely. Outrage following Israel's role in the Phalangist-perpetrated Sabra and Shatila massacre, of mostly Palestinians and Lebanese <b>Shiites,</b> <b>and</b> Israeli popular disillusionment with the war {{would lead to a}} gradual withdrawal from Beirut to the areas claimed by the self-proclaimed Free Lebanon State in southern Lebanon (later to become the South Lebanon security belt), which was initiated following the 17 May Agreement and Syria's change of attitude towards the PLO. After Israeli forces withdrew from most of Lebanon, the War of the Camps broke out between Lebanese factions, the remains of the PLO and Syria, in which Syria fought its former Palestinian allies. At the same time, Shi'a militant groups began consolidating and waging a low-intensity guerrilla war over the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon, leading to 15 years of low-scale armed conflict. The Lebanese Civil War would continue until 1990, at which point Syria had established complete dominance over Lebanon.|$|E
500|$|In January 2005, free, {{democratic}} elections {{were held in}} Iraq {{for the first time}} in 50 years. According to Iraqi National Security Advisor Mowaffak al-Rubaie, [...] "This is the greatest day in the history of this country." [...] Bush praised the event as well, saying that the Iraqis [...] "have taken rightful control of their country's destiny". This led to the election of Jalal Talabani as President and Nouri al-Maliki as Prime Minister of Iraq. A referendum to approve a constitution in Iraq was held in October 2005, supported by most <b>Shiites</b> <b>and</b> many Kurds.|$|E

500|$|Although New Jersey {{performed}} her job expertly {{during the}} intervention in Lebanon some {{have criticized the}} decision to have New Jersey shell Druze and Syrian forces. Members of this camp allege that this action forced {{a shift in the}} previously neutral U.S. forces by convincing local Lebanese Muslims that the United States had taken the Christian side; New Jerseys shells had killed hundreds of people, mostly <b>Shiites</b> <b>and</b> Druze. In his memoir, General Colin Powell (at the time an assistant to Caspar Weinberger) noted that [...] "When the shells started falling on the Shiites, they assumed the American ‘referee’ had taken sides." ...|$|E
500|$|Earlier in his {{campaign}} {{the most important issue}} for Biden was the Conflict in Iraq. [...] In November 2006, Biden and Leslie Gelb, President Emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations, released a comprehensive strategy to end sectarian violence in Iraq. Rather than continuing the present approach or withdrawing, the plan calls for [...] "a third way": federalizing Iraq and giving Kurds, <b>Shiites,</b> <b>and</b> Sunnis [...] "breathing room" [...] in their own regions.

500|$|By late 2006, Biden's stance had shifted, and {{he opposed}} the troop surge of 2007, saying General David Petraeus was [...] "dead, flat wrong" [...] in believing the surge could work. Biden was instead a leading {{advocate}} for dividing Iraq into a loose federation of three ethnic states. In November 2006, Biden and Leslie H. Gelb, President Emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations, released a comprehensive strategy to end sectarian violence in Iraq. Rather than continuing the present approach or withdrawing, the {{plan called for}} [...] "a third way": federalizing Iraq and giving Kurds, <b>Shiites,</b> <b>and</b> Sunnis [...] "breathing room" [...] in their own regions. In September 2007, a non-binding resolution passed the Senate endorsing such a scheme. [...] However, the idea was unfamiliar, had no political constituency, and failed to gain traction. Iraq's political leadership united in denouncing the resolution as a de facto partitioning of the country, and the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad issued a statement distancing itself.|$|E
40|$|Shiites' {{historically}} tumultuous {{life has}} always been exposed to numerous charges. One of these charges is {{the claim that the}} Shiites have received their creed from the Mutazilites. Despite the antiquity of the charge and the fact that Shia scholars have tried to answer it, the charge is still in force. The present study seeks to review the historical roots of such allegations and tries to investigate their causes by referring to some old and modern sources. It also attempts to reply the charges by indicating the distinctions between the <b>Shiite</b> <b>and</b> Mutazilite theological systems and as a result the primacy of Shiite theology over the Mutazilite will be proved. To reject the claim saying the Shiites have obtained their creeds from the Mutazilites, we have mentioned numerous proofs, the titles of which are as follow: A) The refutations offered by the Shiites against the Mutazilites B) The rebukes of the Mutazilites by <b>Shiite</b> Imams <b>and</b> scholars C) The debates of <b>Shiite</b> Imams <b>and</b> scholars with the Mutazilites D) The conversion of some Mutazilites to the Shiism E) Shiism has been charged with "Rafḍ" by the Mutzilites. F)   The difference between <b>Shiite</b> <b>and</b> Mutazilite political position. G) The Shiite belief in infallible Imam, despite the Mutzilites.  H) The fundamental differences of <b>Shiite</b> <b>and</b> Mu'tazilite beliefs. In this research, to answer the question: "why the Shiites are called Mutazilite by some?" four different reasons have been offered which are as follow: A) <b>Shiite</b> <b>and</b> Mutazilite common views in some principles such as the idea of freewill, and rational good and evil. B) Studentship of Zaid bin Ali with Vasil bin 'Ata C) The Mutazilites calling themselves as the Shiite D) The practice of Taqiyyeh by some Shiite scholars Based on what was mentioned above, the differentiation of <b>Shiite</b> <b>and</b> Mutazilite theologies are proved. To prove the primacy of Shiite theology over that of Mutazilite, it is sufficient to refer to some of the remarks of Imam Ali (A). This is because at the time of Imam Ali's martyrdom, Vasil bin 'Ata had not been born yet. By referring to Imam Ali's remarks on justice, man's freewill, impossibility of seeing God in this world and the Hereafter, negation of similarity, and independent intellectual verdicts, which are regarded as similar beliefs in <b>Shiite</b> <b>and</b> Mutazilite theology, it is proved that the Shiites have obtained their theological teachings from their Imams and not from the Mutazilites or anyone els...|$|R
