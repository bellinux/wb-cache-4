5|$|The Sega Neptune was a two-in-one Genesis and 32X console which Sega {{planned to}} release in fall 1995, with the retail price {{planned to be}} <b>something</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> US$200. Sega {{cancelled}} the Neptune in October 1995, citing fears that it would dilute their marketing for the Saturn while being priced {{too close to the}} Saturn to be a viable competitor. Electronic Gaming Monthly used the Sega Neptune as an April Fools' Day prank in its April 2001 issue. The issue included a small article in which the writers announced that Sega had found a warehouse full of old Sega Neptunes, and were selling them on a website for only $50.|$|E
5|$|Edwin's renown comes {{largely from}} his {{treatment}} {{at some length}} by Bede, writing from an uncompromisingly English and Christian perspective, and rests on his belated conversion to Christianity. His united kingdom in the north did not outlast him, and his conversion to Christianity was renounced by his successors. When his kingship is compared with his pagan brother-in-law Æthelfrith, or to Æthelfrith's sons Oswald and Oswiu, or to the resolutely pagan Penda of Mercia, Edwin appears to be <b>something</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> {{a key figure in}} Britain {{during the first half of}} the 7th century. Perhaps the most significant legacies of Edwin's reign lay in his failures: the rise of Penda and of Mercia, and the return from Irish exile of the sons of Æthelfrith, which tied the kingdom of Northumbria into the Irish sea world for generations.|$|E
5|$|One {{month after}} Croatia {{declared}} its independence, the Yugoslav army and other Serb forces held <b>something</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> {{one-third of the}} Croatian territory, mostly in areas with a predominantly ethnic Serb population. The JNA military strategy partly consisted of extensive shelling, at times irrespective {{of the presence of}} civilians. As the war progressed, the cities of Dubrovnik, Gospić, Šibenik, Zadar, Karlovac, Sisak, Slavonski Brod, Osijek, Vinkovci, and Vukovar all came under attack by Yugoslav forces. The United Nations (UN) imposed a weapons embargo; this did not affect JNA-backed Serb forces significantly, as they had the JNA arsenal at their disposal, but it caused serious trouble for the newly formed Croatian army. The Croatian government started smuggling weapons over its borders.|$|E

25|$|There were no Dukes {{made between}} William the Conqueror and Henry II; they were {{themselves}} only Dukes in France. When Edward III of England declared himself King of France, {{he made his}} sons Dukes, to distinguish them from other noblemen, much as Royal Dukes are now distinguished from other Dukes. Later Kings created Marquesses and Viscounts to make finer gradations of honour: a rank something more than an Earl and <b>something</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> an Earl, respectively.|$|E
25|$|The Punitive Expedition {{is often}} {{portrayed as a}} failure because Pershing’s force failed to capture or kill Pancho Villa. This view is <b>something</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> the truth. While Pershing’s mission was to catch Villa if possible, Pershing’s orders from the War Department had {{directed}} him only to pursue and disperse the band of raiders that had attacked Columbus, not to eliminate Villa. In addition to the 69 bandits captured and killed during the fighting in Columbus on March 9, the Punitive Expedition had killed 248 and taken 19 prisoner by July 31.|$|E
25|$|Wilkins became vicar of Polebrook, Northamptonshire, in 1666; prebendary of Exeter in 1667; {{and in the}} {{following}} year, prebendary of St Paul's and bishop of Chester. He owed his position as bishop {{to the influence of}} George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham. Buckingham's approach to the religious problem of the day was comprehension, <b>something</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> religious tolerance but aimed at least at bringing in the Presbyterians among the nonconformists to the Church of England by some peaceful form of negotiation and arrangement. Wilkins too thought along these lines. He had been a sympathetic reader of John Humfrey's 1661 justification of his acceptance of re-ordination by William Piers, having already once been ordained in the Presbyterian style by a classis.|$|E

500|$|At the story's climax, Gawain is wounded superficially in {{the neck}} by the Green Knight's axe. During the medieval period, {{the body and the}} soul were {{believed}} to be so intimately connected that wounds were considered an outward sign of inward sin. The neck, specifically, was believed to correlate with the part of the soul related to will, connecting the reasoning part (the head) and the courageous part (the heart). Gawain's sin resulted from using his will to separate reasoning from courage. By accepting the girdle from the lady, he employs reason to do <b>something</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> courageous—evade death in a dishonest way. Gawain's wound is thus an outward sign of an internal wound. The Green Knight's series of tests shows Gawain the weakness that has been in him all along: the desire to use his will pridefully for personal gain, rather than submitting his will in humility to God. The Green Knight, by engaging with the greatest knight of Camelot, also reveals the moral weakness of pride in all of Camelot, and therefore all of humanity. However, the wounds of Christ, believed to offer healing to wounded souls and bodies, are mentioned throughout the poem in the hope that this sin of prideful [...] "stiffneckedness" [...] will be healed among fallen mortals.|$|E

500|$|The Library {{became more}} {{important}} during the 18th century; {{prior to that}} it had been a small, little-used collection of books. In 1725 it was proposed by the Pension that [...] "a publick Library be sett up and kept open for ye use of ye society", and that more books be purchased. The first order of new books was on 27 June 1729 and consisted of [...] "a collection of Lord Bacon's works". In 1750 the Under-Steward of the Inn made a new catalogue of the books, and in 1789 the Library was moved to a new room between the Hall and the Chapel. In 1840 another two rooms were erected in which to store books, and in 1883 a new Library was constructed with space to store approximately 11,000 books. This was rapidly found to be inadequate, and in 1929 a new Library, known as the Holker Library after the benefactor, Sir John Holker, was opened. The library, although impressive looking, was not particularly useful; Francis Cowper wrote that: Though impressive to look at, the new building was <b>something</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> a success as a library. The air of spaciousness was produced at the expense of shelf room, and though in the octagon [...] the decorative effect of row upon row of books soaring upwards towards the cornice was considerable, the loftiest were totally inaccessible save to those who could scale the longest and dizziest ladders. Further, the appointments were of such surpassing mag-nificence that no ink-pots were allowed in the room for fear of accidents.|$|E
