5|$|On {{the night}} of Sunday 8 May to Monday 9 May 1977, about 100 people were staying in the Hotel Polen, {{including}} {{a large group of}} Swedish tourists. About 6:20am, the hotel staff were preparing for breakfast service, when one of them noticed smoke that <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> from the freight elevator (which had not been used since the café-restaurant on the ground floor had closed the previous evening). The night porter was alerted. Contrary to instructions, he did not call the fire department immediately; instead, he poured some buckets of water into the shaft, in an attempt to subdue the fire. By the time he decided to call the fire department, the hotel was filling with smoke. The night porter was unable to reach the phone at the front desk because the fire had already reached it. The porter then ran outside, where he stopped the driver of a laundry truck serving the hotel, and instructed him to drive to the Hotel Krasnapolsky to warn them and to call the fire department.|$|E

After a week in Paris World War II breaks out. The 10 September 700 Swedes were transported by train from Paris to Dieppe. From Dieppe they were {{evacuated}} by two Swedish hired boats – over mined waters – to Gothenburg. Kristina Hedenström never returned to Sweden. She died in Paris in November 1943 only 33 years old.|$|E
500|$|The {{scholarly}} {{consensus is}} that Virgil began the hexameter Eclogues (or Bucolics) in 42 BC and {{it is thought that}} the collection was published around 39–8 BC (although this assertion is not without its detractors). The Eclogues (from the Greek word for [...] "selections") are a group of ten poems roughly modeled on the bucolic hexameter poetry ("pastoral poetry") of the Hellenistic poet Theocritus. The fourth of these Eclogues can be dated to around 40 BC, during a time when the Roman Civil war <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> to an end. ‘’Eclogue’’ 4 largely concerns {{the birth of a child}} (puer) who will become divine and eventually rule over the world. Classicist H. J. Rose notes that the poem “is in a sense Messianic, since it contains a prophecy (whether meant seriously or not) of the birth of a wonder-child of more than mortal virtue and power, who shall restore the Golden Age.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Also {{reported}} that same day, fighting in Idale and Daynuunay {{was said to}} have started the prior morning and continued through the next day. No stint in the fighting <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>coming,</b> as both sides continued to gather reinforcements. [...] Casualty figures were unavailable, but the numbers were expected to be in the hundreds easily. The report went on to refute ICU claim of victory, and stated the government again possession of Iidale and killed foreign fighters.|$|E
2500|$|By July, Darwin {{had decided}} to produce Natural Selection as a full {{technical}} treatise on species. Lyell <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> round to Darwin's ideas, but in private was agonising over the social implications if humans had animal ancestry, particularly now that race was becoming an issue, with Robert Knox describing races as different species and warning of racial wars. Hooker's verdict on the growing manuscript was [...] "incomparably more favourable" [...] than Darwin had anticipated, while Darwin tried to put over the point that [...] "external conditions do extremely little", it was the selection of [...] "chance" [...] variations that produced new species.|$|E
2500|$|To better police Syria, {{he built}} a royal {{residence}} at Tell Brak, a crossroads {{at the heart of}} the Khabur River basin of the Jezirah. Naram-Sin campaigned against Magan which also revolted; Naram-Sin [...] "marched against Magan and personally caught Mandannu, its king", where he instated garrisons to protect the main roads. The chief threat <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> from the northern Zagros Mountains, the Lulubis and the Gutians. A campaign against the Lullubi led to the carving of the [...] "Victory Stele of Naram-Suen", now in the Louvre. Hittite sources claim Naram-Sin of Akkad even ventured into Anatolia, battling the Hittite and Hurrian kings Pamba of Hatti, Zipani of Kanesh, and 15 others.|$|E

50|$|The book sold 25,000 {{copies in}} the first month after its release. Its {{popularity}} {{can be seen in the}} context of the rise of regional varieties of chick-lit. Sometimes referred to as 'ladki-lit', Indian chick-lit <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> of age.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, these provincial centers <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> {{into line}} at last," [...] said Mr. Clacton, and then Mary {{introduced}} him to Miss Hilbery, and he asked her, in a very formal manner, if she were interested [...] "in our work." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not for you, perhaps, but for me. It {{would be}} a great satisfaction- -and I have not many." [...] He <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> nearer; Catherine turned away. [...] "Can we not be friends again?" [...] he said.|$|E
6000|$|The sick-room was disgraced by more profanity. [...] "I {{would give}} {{my life to}} {{see the end of}} this," [...] said Bailey. There were indistinct shouts up stream. Once they <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> nearer, but they {{disappointed}} him.|$|E
60|$|He reeled {{out of the}} room. Anna was {{afterwards}} {{astonished at}} her own self-possession. She bound a scarf tightly round {{the place where the}} blood <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> from. Then she stood up and looked around the room.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} the campaign, QAI reboot {{itself and}} <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> back online. However, QAI's {{condition}} and loyalty is unknown.

6000|$|On {{the same}} day he sent word to Howells of the good luck which now [...] <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> his way. The Joan of Arc {{introduction}} was the [...] same that today appears in his collected works under the title of [...] Saint Joan of Arc.|$|E
60|$|He {{told us that}} it {{had been}} a fine day to-day, and we told him {{that it had been}} a fine day yesterday, and then we all told each other that {{we thought it would be}} a fine day to-morrow; and George said the crops <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> up nicely.|$|E
60|$|As we {{all made}} a dive among our {{snorting}} and plunging horses the sound <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> right into camp.

6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} somehow {{we have gone}} wrong," [...] Lisle exclaimed, after looking round, [...] "and the light <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> from the wrong quarter, altogether.

5000|$|But Pogo {{is still}} as irresponsible as before. He invites Jessica to {{come away with}} him and [...] "see the world". He even tries to break up her engagement, to Katharine's dismay.

50|$|After revelations that rustbacking {{connections}} <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> {{from all}} corners of the case, Kresh realizes that Tierlaw Verick hired the killer, Ottley Bissal, in order to secure rustbacking profits because Grieg <b>was</b> going <b>to</b> let the New Law robots go free and decide of their own accord whether to stay on Purgatory.|$|R
60|$|Westover {{wanted to}} laugh; {{but they all}} heard voices without, which <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> nearer, and he listened with the rest. He made out Frank Whitwell's voice, and his sister's; and then another voice, louder and gayer, rose boisterously above them. Whitwell flung {{the door open and}} plunged out into the night. He came back, hauling Jeff Durgin in by the shoulder.|$|E
60|$|M. le Comte {{had opened}} the near door and was half out of the {{carriage}} when a sound caught his ear which {{was in no way}} connected with the stranded vehicle and its team of snorting horses.

6000|$|Wheels were {{crashing}} up the hill. The horrible responsibility was over, {{the immediate}} terror gone, help <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> at the utmost speed, and tears of relief rushed into Rachel's eyes, tears that Lovedy must have perceived, for she spoke the first articulate words she had uttered since the night-watch had begun, [...] "Please, ma'am, don't fret, I'm going to poor mother." ...|$|E
60|$|There is {{also the}} plucky guest, who sees a ghost, and knows it is a ghost, and watches it, as it {{comes into the room}} and disappears through the wainscot, after which, as the ghost does not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> back, and there <b>is</b> nothing, consequently, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> gained by {{stopping}} awake, he goes to sleep.|$|R

It is simply not sustainable...|$|R
