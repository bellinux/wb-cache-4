5|$|<b>Sheep</b> <b>husbandry</b> is practised {{throughout}} {{the majority of}} the inhabited world, and has been fundamental to many civilizations. In the modern era, Australia, New Zealand, the southern and central South American nations, and the British Isles are most closely associated with sheep production.|$|E
5|$|The high {{concentration}} and more sedentary nature of shepherding in the UK allowed sheep especially adapted to their particular purpose and region to be raised, thereby {{giving rise to}} an exceptional variety of breeds {{in relation to the}} land mass of the country. This greater variety of breeds also produced a valuable variety of products to compete with the superfine wool of Spanish sheep. By the time of Elizabeth I's rule, sheep and wool trade was the primary source of tax revenue to the Crown of England and the country was a major influence in the development and spread of <b>sheep</b> <b>husbandry.</b>|$|E
5|$|Other than parasites and disease, {{predation}} is {{a threat}} to sheep and the profitability of sheep raising. Sheep have little ability to defend themselves, compared with other species kept as livestock. Even if sheep survive an attack, they may die from their injuries or simply from panic. However, the impact of predation varies dramatically with region. In Africa, Australia, the Americas, and parts of Europe and Asia predators are a serious problem. In the United States, for instance, over one third of sheep deaths in 2004 were caused by predation. In contrast, other nations are virtually devoid of sheep predators, particularly islands known for extensive <b>sheep</b> <b>husbandry.</b> Worldwide, canids—including the domestic dog—are responsible for most sheep deaths. Other animals that occasionally prey on sheep include: felines, bears, birds of prey, ravens and feral hogs.|$|E

40|$|Sheep breeds {{which are}} {{indigenous}} to arid and semi-arid regions {{are known for}} their ability to adapt to rustic environments, to climatic variations as well as to shortages in resources. Water scarcity, often combined with heat stress, is a common challenge facing these animals, causing physiological perturbations and affecting the animal's productivity. This review reports the effect of different forms of water stress on physiological indicators, blood parameters, thermoregulation and immunological status in sheep. Although the breed effect may be significant, the following are generally observed common responses: drop in feed intake and weight loss, increase in evaporative cooling through panting, production of a small volume of highly concentrated urine, haemoconcentration, high blood osmolality, and immunosuppression. Prolonged water shortage may affect lamb birth weight and survival, and lead to a decrease in milk production, especially in non-adapted breeds, which could lead to important economic losses, as reported in heat-stressed <b>sheep</b> <b>husbandries.</b> Novel stress alleviation approaches are also presented, such as vitamin C supplementation...|$|R
50|$|Sheep {{farming is}} the raising and {{breeding}} of domestic sheep. It is {{a branch of}} animal <b>husbandry.</b> <b>Sheep</b> are raised principally for their meat (lamb and mutton), milk (sheep's milk), and fiber (wool). They also yield sheepskin and parchment.|$|R
5|$|In South America, {{especially}} in Patagonia, {{there is an}} active modern sheep industry. Sheep keeping was largely introduced through immigration to the continent by Spanish and British peoples, for whom sheep were a major industry during the period. South America has {{a large number of}} sheep, but the highest-producing nation (Brazil) kept only just over 15 million head in 2004, far fewer than most centers of <b>sheep</b> <b>husbandry.</b> The primary challenges to the sheep industry in South America are the phenomenal drop in wool prices in the late 20th century and the loss of habitat through logging and overgrazing. The most influential region internationally is that of Patagonia, which has been the first to rebound from the fall in wool prices. With few predators and almost no grazing competition (the only large native grazing mammal is the guanaco), the region is prime land for sheep raising. The most exceptional area of production is surrounding the La Plata river in the Pampas region. Sheep production in Patagonia peaked in 1952 at more than 21 million head, but has steadily fallen to fewer than ten today. Most operations focus on wool production for export from Merino and Corriedale sheep; the economic sustainability of wool flocks has fallen with the drop in prices, while the cattle industry continues to grow.|$|E

25|$|Other than parasites and disease, {{predation}} is {{a threat}} to sheep health and thereby the profitability of sheep raising. Sheep have very little ability to defend themselves, even when compared with other prey species kept as livestock. Even if sheep are not directly bitten or survive an attack, they may die from panic or from injuries sustained. However, the impact of predation varies dramatically with region. In Africa, Australia, the Americas, and parts of Europe and Asia predators can be a serious problem. In contrast, some nations are virtually devoid of sheep predators. Many islands that are known for extensive <b>sheep</b> <b>husbandry</b> are suitable largely because of their predator-free status. Worldwide, canidsincluding the domestic dogare responsible for the majority of sheep deaths. Other animals that prey on sheep include: felines, pandas, bears, birds of prey, bats, feral hogs, and hyenas. Sheep deaths have even been attributed to cryptids such as the Chupacabra, big cats in Britain, and the Drekavac.|$|E

500|$|For centuries, the {{husbandry}} of Herdwick sheep {{has been}} a large factor in shaping the culture and terrain of the Lake District. Topographically, grazing by sheep continues to keep the hillsides of fells largely treeless, and the ubiquitous dry stone walls of the valleys were built to protect grazing land and to confine livestock.

500|$|<b>Sheep</b> <b>husbandry</b> {{spread quickly}} in [...] Europe. Excavations {{show that in}} about 6000 BC, during the Neolithic period of prehistory, [...] the Castelnovien people, living around Châteauneuf-les-Martigues near present-day Marseille {{in the south of}} France, [...] were among the first in Europe to keep {{domestic}} sheep. Practically from its inception, ancient Greek civilization relied on sheep as primary livestock, and were even said to name individual animals. Scandinavian sheep of a type seen today — with short tails and multi-colored fleece — were also present early on. Later, the Roman Empire kept sheep on a wide scale, and the Romans were an important agent in the spread of sheep raising through much of Europe. Pliny the Elder, in his Natural History (Naturalis Historia), speaks at length about sheep and wool. Declaring [...] "Many thanks, too, do we owe to the sheep, both for appeasing the gods, and for giving us the use of its fleece.", he goes on to detail the breeds of ancient sheep and the many colors, lengths and qualities of wool. Romans also pioneered the practice of blanketing sheep, in which a fitted coat (today usually of nylon) is placed over the sheep to improve the cleanliness and luster of its wool.|$|E
500|$|Sheep {{may fall}} victim to poisons, {{infectious}} diseases, and physical injuries. As a prey species, a sheep's system is adapted to hide the obvious signs of illness, to prevent being targeted by predators. However, some signs of ill health are obvious, with sick sheep eating little, vocalizing excessively, and being generally listless. Throughout history, {{much of the money}} and labor of <b>sheep</b> <b>husbandry</b> has aimed to prevent sheep ailments. Historically, shepherds often created remedies by experimentation on the farm. In some developed countries, including the United States, sheep lack the economic importance for drug companies to perform expensive clinical trials required to approve more than a relatively limited number of drugs for ovine use. However, extra-label drug use in sheep production is permitted in many jurisdictions, subject to certain restrictions. [...] In the US, for example, regulations governing extra-label drug use in animals are found in 21 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) Part 530. [...] In the 20th and 21st centuries, a minority of sheep owners have turned to alternative treatments such as homeopathy, herbalism and even traditional Chinese medicine to treat sheep veterinary problems. Despite some favorable anecdotal evidence, the effectiveness of alternative veterinary medicine has been met with skepticism in scientific journals. The need for traditional anti-parasite drugs and antibiotics is widespread, and is the main impediment to certified organic farming with sheep.|$|E
