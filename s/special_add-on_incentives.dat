5000|$|In the United States, Commodore {{offered the}} Commodore Information Network, a CompuServe SIG devoted to its {{products}} and users. Later, Quantum Computer Services (which became America Online) offered an online service called Quantum Link for the C64 that featured chat, downloads, and online games. In the UK, Compunet {{was a very}} popular online service for C64 users (requiring special Compunet modems) from 1984 to the early 1990s. In Australia, Telecom (now Telstra) ran an online service called Viatel and sold modems for the C64 for use with the service. In Germany the very restrictive rules of the state-owned telephone system prevented widespread use of inexpensive, non-telco licensed modems, prompting the use of inferior acoustic couplers instead. Access to Bildschirmtext, the state-owned telco's own dial-up online service, was possible via <b>special</b> <b>add-on</b> hardware like the Commodore [...] "BTX Decoder Modul" [...] or the Commodore [...] "BTX Decoder Modul II".|$|R

5000|$|Custom and {{specials}} motorcycles {{are similar}} to the above but tend to be super sport type motorcycles, or at least high-performance based, using many <b>special</b> <b>add-on</b> parts, one-of-a-kind or limited series frames, racing wheels and parts or hand-made components to maximise performance. While modifying motorcycles is an activity as old as the motorcycle itself, the [...] "special" [...] culture or [...] "streetfighter" [...] began to flourish in the mid-1970s {{as a response to the}} myriad high performance Japanese motorcycles then available, but whose power far exceeded their handling. Individuals would choose premanufactured parts from catalogs or from other bikes and redesign their particular machine to suit their desires. In general this activity is limited to one-of-a-kind vehicles and, as with custom motorcycles, uses very little genuine engineering or design methodology, although some small-scale manufacturers exist who make limited runs of a given model. In some cases, these tiny specialists were successful enough to grow into full-scale OEM companies such as the Buell Motorcycle Company and Bimota of Italy.|$|R
40|$|In the Ion Beam Center (IBC), various set-ups – {{electrostatic}} accelerators, ion implanters, plasma-based {{ion implantation}} equipment, low-energy ion tools, an ion microscope etc. – {{are combined into}} a unique facility for research and applications using ion beams. Almost all ions from stable chemical nuclides {{are available in the}} ion energy range from 10 eV to about 60 MeV. In addition to broad beams, also focused (down to 1 nm) and highly-charged (charge state up to 45 +) ion beams, or ions extracted from a plasma can be provided. In total, the IBC operates more than 30 dedicated tools or beamline end-stations. The specific expertise of IBC is the modification and analysis of solids by energetic ions aimed to develop novel materials for information technology, electronics or energy systems. In addition, ion beam analysis techniques became of increasing importance for interdisciplinary fields like geochemistry, climate or environmental research and resources technology. <b>Special</b> <b>add-on</b> services offered ensure a successful realization of user experiments.

40|$|Cyclotides, {{a family}} of {{approximately}} 50 mini-proteins isolated from various Violaceae and Rubiaceae plants, are characterized by their circular peptide backbone and six conserved cysteine residues arranged in a cystine knot motif. Cyclotides show {{a wide range of}} biological activities, making them interesting targets for both pharmaceutical and agrochemical research, but little is known about their natural function and the events that trigger their expression. An investigation of the geographical and seasonal variations of cyclotide profiles has been performed, using the native Australian violet, Viola hederacea, and the Swedish sweet violet, Viola odorata, as model plants. The results showed that in the Australian violet the relative peptide levels of some cyclotides remained almost constant throughout the year, while other cyclotides were present only at certain times of the year. Therefore, it appears that V. hederacea expresses a basic armory of cyclotides as well as <b>special</b> <b>add-ons</b> whose levels are influenced by external factors. In the Swedish violet, cyclotide levels were increased up to 14 times during the warmest period of the year. The larger variation in expression levels of the Swedish plants may be a reflection of a greater climatic variation...|$|R

LiveTalk was used extensively by Bharatiya Janata Party in its 2014 Lok Sabha campaign to reach Media Dark Regions in India. It broadcast Narendra Modi's speeches directly via phone call.|$|R
40|$|Ontario's {{universal}} health insurance system has placed few {{constraints on the}} clinical and economic autonomy of medical doctors. Although fees are standardized, most physicians remain in private fee-for-service practice and thereby retain control of the mix and volume of services. Utilization review is minimal. While organized medicine has argued that health care is 'under-funded', the government is pressing for better use of extant resources through firmer management of the medical services sector. The Ontario Medical Association (OMA), the major bargaining agent for doctors in the province, has accordingly sought to protect professional autonomy by developing voluntary self-regulatory approaches that obviate the need for external controls over physician practice patterns. Part of this strategy is promulgation of practice guidelines. Tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), a clot-lysing drug for myocardial infarction, was released in late 1987, and, at C$ 2950 per treatment, constituted an unforeseen add-on cost for hospitals. The OMA subsequently convened an expert panel to develop guidelines for thrombolysis in myocardial infarction. Among the unanticipated results was the conclusion that insufficient evidence had accumulated to recommend routine use of t-PA instead of streptokinase, an older drug costing C$ 290. The OMA panel's guidelines were approved by the OMA executive, and led the government to reject <b>special</b> <b>add-on</b> funding for hospitals purchasing t-PA. The OMA's position and government decision provoked negative reactions from the OMA's own cardiology section. Indicative of clinicians' feelings, a follow-up survey of cardiologists and internists showed that only 28 % of respondents were indifferent between t-PA and streptokinase, while 64 % preferred t-PA. On the other hand, 74 % supported clinical policy development by the OMA, while 94 % opposed direct government involvement in guideline-setting. The case of the OMA thrombolysis guidelines illustrates a strategic conundrum facing Canadian organized medicine. Professional activism in guideline-setting may in theory protect the individual practitioner's autonomy by offering a voluntary alternative to utilization management by government, {{and is likely to}} strengthen the collective influence of organized medicine. However, among the risks are alienation of practitioners who see professional guidelines and government control as {{two sides of the same}} regulatory coin, and the transmogrification of voluntary guidelines into parameters for cost control and utilization management by government or hospitals. Future initiatives will depend on how these benefits and risks are weighed. ...|$|R
