Within a <b>single</b> <b>institutional</b> <b>framework</b> (e. g., Swiss federal corporate law), we use language (German and French) and religion (Roman Catholicism and Protestantism) as proxies for culture. These groups share a distinct set of values particularly in their tolerance for hierarchical structures. We observe that firms in Swiss–French areas and firms in Roman Catholic cantons {{are more likely to}} have one-tier boards, whereas two-tier boards are more prevalent in Swiss–German areas and Protestant cantons. Furthermore, board composition is significantly driven by language. In contrast, ownership and equity structure are not significantly related to culture...|$|E

One work influences another, bringing to the field a spirit of competition and cooperation that reaches an intensity rarely found in other disciplines" (x). In these remarks on "contemporary studies," Jerome Klinkowitz takes for granted that contemporary writers and their critics belong to one "discipline," the academic discipline of literary study. This affiliation of criticism and creative writing within a <b>single</b> <b>institutional</b> <b>framework</b> does indeed compound the influence that critic and author have on one another's work, as it multiplies the opportunities and the incentives for cooperation; but rather than simply celebrating this fact, as Klinkowitz does, we ought to inquire into the consequences of the professional interaction and practical interdependence of author and critic, particularly as it affects the creativity of the former and the judgment of the latter. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|E
40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{potential problems}} with the governmental structure of the European Union. The Treaty on European Union (or 2 ̆ 2 Maastricht Treaty 2 ̆ 2) establishes procedures for the formulation of objectives and decision-making. Article C does speak of a <b>single</b> <b>institutional</b> <b>framework</b> of the Union, and Titles V and VI envisage specific tasks for the Council and the Commission. The European Parliament has no legal authority {{to take part in}} the procedure for formulating objectives and decision-making. Pursuant to Articles J. 7 and K. 6, the European Parliament has only a limited right to be informed by the Presidency of the Council and to present its position to the Council. The Parliament, however, may query the Council and take a position in its annual report. Further, judicial review by the Court of Justice is not possible. In those instances where the Council and the Commission share responsibility under a cooperative framework, they fail to exercise such powers in accordance with procedural provisions of the EC Treaty...|$|E
40|$|From the Introduction]. The European Community (EC) was {{initially}} only competent {{in the area}} of trade and gradually developed a common commercial policy. The 1970 s onwards saw increasing foreign policy co-operation in the framework of European Political Co-operation (EPC). Over the next two decades the increasing number of external activities of the Union highlighted the need for consistency between the EC’s external competencies conducted {{in the context of the}} first pillar and the intergovernmental ones of the second pillar and, to an growing extent, the third pillar. By the late 1990 s the European Union (EU) accounted for a greater percentage of global gross national product than the U. S. and Japan. The EU also contributes more to the UN budget and peacekeeping operations than either the U. S. or Japan. Given the enormous importance of the EU as a global actor and its potential to play an even more influential role, it is not difficult to see why concerns of consistency in the EU’s external activities are legitimate. Consistency has become something of a refrain. Most recently the consolidated Treaty on European Union (CTEU) states that, 'The Union shall be served by a <b>single</b> <b>institutional</b> <b>framework</b> which shall ensure the consistency and the continuity of the activities carried out in order to attain its objectives while respecting and building upon the acquis communautaire. ' [CTEU, 1997, Article 3] To this end, it is to the Union generally that the task of ensuring 'consistency in its external activities as a whole in the context of external relations, security, economic and development policies' falls. The Council and Commission are though charged with particular responsibility in this regard. The objective of achieving consistency in the Union’s external activities is to ensure that the Union can 'assert its identity on the international scheme. ' [CTEU, 1997, Article 2] In support of the general theme of consistency the European Council identified the aim of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) as being to enable the Union to speak with one voice. The same theme is returned to within the CFSP mechanisms, both directly but also indirectly through reference to 'common positions,' 'joint decisions,' 'joint actions,' and, most recently, 'common strategies. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to investigate the contribution of basic services namely water supply, electricity, sewerage, telephone, roads and drainage network etc. for urban living in Dhaka. In the last three and a half decades, Dhaka’s urban basic services governance has been functioning scantily because of supply shortage, sub-standard quality, lack of inter-operator coordination, resource constraints etc. Fragmented governance of urban services – which allowed functioning of several independent special purpose providers in the city - has been argued to be the key contributor by the concerned local researchers, academics, politicians, user groups etc. The same have professed integrated governance of these basic services under the single institutional canvas of a general-purpose metropolitan government headed by elected leadership as the potential remedy. The research is aimed at examining the prospects of metropolitan government for rendering improvements in this connection. In the process, the research investigated the institutional capacities of the selected service providers based on secondary information, carried out questionnaire interview on sampled users to gauge on their level of satisfaction with the present service governance. The above two investigations examined the effectiveness, equity, efficiency and responsiveness of the existing arrangement as in broad terms, these determines the governance performance. Additionally, the research reviewed cases of metropolitan government from overseas to learn how the arrangement can contribute in this regard. Investigation results from Dhaka align with the assertion that fragmented mode of governing urban basic services have caused the surfacing of the present ailing status. Review of overseas experiences revealed that metropolitan government arrangement has been quite successful in improving governance problems of urban services similar to Dhaka. Based on the results, the current research favors the establishment of a general-purpose metropolitan government in Dhaka with sole powers over urban basic services delivery and management. The research also suggests that key considerations for enacting such a governance arrangement needs to reflect on the prospects of consolidating functional and areal jurisdictions, financial affairs of urban basic services under its <b>single</b> <b>institutional</b> <b>framework.</b> The research is significant in context of Dhaka as well as Bangladesh in way that it crafts scope for conducting further examination on issues related to the strengthening of urban local government bodies, tentative functional domains and prospects of implementing metropolitan government in other Bangladeshi cities. published_or_final_versionKadoorie InstituteDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E

40|$|Empirical {{studies on}} the effect of sellers’ {{reputation}} on closing prices in online auctions present mixed results. A large number of studies addresses reputational effects in one country, especially in the US. Only a small number of cross-country studies inspect the moderating role of <b>institutional</b> <b>frameworks</b> on bidder behavior. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine if country-specific differences in the formal and informal <b>institutional</b> <b>framework</b> influence the effects of reputation and information signals on final prices in online auctions. From the perspective of the New Institutional Economics, management decisions and individuals’ characteristics are affected by the <b>institutional</b> <b>framework,</b> which consists of cultural aspects as well as a set of social and legal rules and regulations. Therefore, bidders that are influenced by one <b>institutional</b> <b>framework</b> have different preferences, expectations, and perceptions about reputation and information in online auctions than individuals socialized by another <b>institutional</b> <b>framework.</b> In order to examine the effects of reputation and information on prices as well as to asses cross-country similarities and differences in these effects, a sample of 6, 166 homogenous online auctions, conducted on the respective eBay websites in Germany, the UK, and the US, is analyzed. The results suggest that either the effects of reputation and product information variables vary significantly across countries or that different variables have an impact on prices in different countries. It can be concluded that country-specific <b>institutional</b> <b>frameworks</b> influence bidder behavior in international online auction markets. reputation, information, online auctions, cross-country studies...|$|R

40|$|Since {{human beings}} are not disembodied minds who {{instantly}} and costlessly absorb new knowledge, every scientific movement, {{if it is to}} flourish and advance, requires an <b>institutional</b> <b>framework.</b> By the <b>institutional</b> <b>framework</b> of a science, I mean a complementary set of means aimed at developing its ideas and theories, disseminating them among its active researchers and teachers, and inculcating them into its students and sympathetic public intellectuals. The institutions that constitute this framework include research institutes and libraries, graduate schools, regular conferences and colloquia, book series, and scholarly journals. Of course, the construction of such an <b>institutional</b> <b>framework</b> requires the power of disposal over real resources, that is property, and the will to employ such property exclusively and without deviation for the advancement of the science. 1 The travesties of National Socialist “biology, ” Soviet Socialist “physics ” and the Keynesian “New Economics” should teach us that the property base that composes a science’s <b>institutional</b> <b>framework</b> must be entirely private and independent of the State.
