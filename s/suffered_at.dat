After his return, Birch became {{addicted}} to painkillers, due to the facial injury he <b>suffered</b> <b>at</b> the Armageddon pay-per-view in December 2006. After a direct intervention by WWE owner Vince McMahon, Birch was released, and credits this with him beating his addictions.|$|E

5|$|On {{the other}} hand, Real Madrid was {{widely seen as}} the {{embodiment}} of the sovereign oppressive centralism and the fascist regime at management level and beyond– Santiago Bernabéu, the former club president for whom Real Madrid's stadium is named, fought on the Nationalist side during the Spanish Civil War. During the war, however, members of both clubs, such as Josep Sunyol and Rafael Sánchez Guerra, <b>suffered</b> <b>at</b> the hands of Francoists.|$|E

5|$|After his {{retirement}} as coach and athletic director in 1957, Crisp remained active {{at the university}} and served as director of intramural athletics through 1967. In 1970, he {{was inducted into the}} Alabama Sports Hall of Fame in recognition for his contributions to sport in the state. However, {{on the eve of his}} induction, Crisp died at University Hospital in Birmingham as a result of a heart attack he <b>suffered</b> <b>at</b> the Hall of Fame banquet on January 23, 1970. The Hank Crisp Indoor Facility on the University of Alabama campus, which was completed in October 1986, was renamed in honor of Crisp in April 1991.|$|E
5|$|Alexios's son John II Komnenos succeeded him in 1118 {{and ruled}} until 1143.

Famed for his piety and his remarkably mild and just reign, John was an exceptional example of a moral ruler at a time when cruelty was the norm. For this reason, he has been called the Byzantine Marcus Aurelius.|$|E

Mechanic Mack questions why Coulson would risk lives just to steal a quinjet, but Coulson explains that they need its ability to literally disappear, something they currently cannot do themselves following the injuries engineer Agent Leo Fitz recently <b>suffered</b> <b>at</b> the hands of Ward; he now struggles with technology and hallucinates the presence of Agent Jemma Simmons, who left S.H.I.E.L.D. some time earlier because of Fitz's condition.|$|E
5|$|Although this {{represented}} {{a huge number}} of available aircraft, the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service (IJNAS) was still recovering from losses <b>suffered</b> <b>at</b> the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June. While units were largely reconstituted in terms of quantity by this time, pilot quality was in clear decline. Moreover, though the overall number of planes committed to battle by 12October dwarfed any force that Japan had previously fielded in the air, the U.S. Navy's Fast Carrier Force was capable of committing a much larger, significantly better-trained force.|$|E
5|$|As {{that battle}} on the Somme dragged on, the Canadian Corps {{was brought up}} and the AIF was {{withdrawn}} from the line to re-organise and reform, having suffered almost 23,000 casualties {{over the course of}} the 45 days that they had been involved. The 5th Division had been so badly mauled, having been incapacitated by the losses they had <b>suffered</b> <b>at</b> Fromelles, that it was not until October that the 5th Division finally returned to the line and joined the 1st, 2nd and 4th Divisions on the Somme near Flers.|$|E

At the first game they beat the later champion Omonia, 2–1, in an away game at Makario Stadium in Nicosia. This defeat was the first Omonia <b>suffered</b> <b>at</b> the stadium since they began competing in it. Nea Salamina finished seventh for the season.|$|E

During his {{freshman}} year, he attempted to enlist in the military as a U.S. Navy cadet but was rejected because of a burned right hand that he had <b>suffered</b> <b>at</b> age three. Because of wartime demands, Virginia Tech was operating on a twelve-month schedule, and Kraft finished his degree in only two years. He graduated in December 1944 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering.|$|E

5|$|In the {{following}} years Montagu served the king in various capacities, primarily in the Scottish Wars. He was richly rewarded, and among other things received the lordship of the Isle of Man. In 1337, he was created Earl of Salisbury, and given an annual income of 1000 marks {{to go with the}} title. He served on the Continent {{in the early years of}} the Hundred Years' War, but in 1340 he was captured by the French, and in return for his freedom had to promise never to fight in France again. Salisbury died of wounds <b>suffered</b> <b>at</b> a tournament early in 1344.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, Real Madrid was {{widely seen as}} the {{embodiment}} of the sovereign oppressive centralism and the fascist regime at management level and beyond: Santiago Bernabéu, the former club president for whom their stadium is named, fought on the Nationalist side during the Spanish Civil War.

5|$|Poor {{organization}} {{among both}} North and South Korean units made {{it extremely difficult}} to estimate total casualties for both sides. Several units were completely destroyed in the fighting, making precise casualty counting difficult. A memo from the South Korean army claimed 3,800 North Korean killed and 181 captured in the P'ohang area from 17 August onward. However, casualty numbers are likely far higher. The NK 12th Division alone likely <b>suffered</b> <b>at</b> least 4,500 casualties {{on top of that}} number, reporting a strength of 6,000 on 5 August and only 1,500 on 17 August.|$|E

5|$|Suzuki's working {{title for}} this second {{autobiography}} was The Outsider, a title intended {{to express the}} author's view of his own role in society. The origin of this outsider feeling comes from isolation <b>suffered</b> <b>at</b> a Japanese Canadian internment camp during World War II. He was imprisoned there for being Japanese but shunned by other Japanese for being a third generation Canadian, speaking only English. His feeling of isolation continued during his early school years when the only other student of Japanese heritage was his twin sister. Suzuki's daughters acknowledged this perception of himself as an outsider but insist that the public views him very differently, {{as one of their}} own, leading to the simple The Autobiography title.|$|E
5|$|This British Empire victory, {{the first}} against the Ottoman Empire in the war, ensured {{the safety of}} the Suez Canal from ground attacks, and ended the Central Powers' ambitions of disrupting traffic through the canal by gaining control of the {{strategically}} important northern approaches to the Suez Canal. The pursuit by the Anzac Mounted Division which ended at Bir el Abd on 12 August began the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. Thereafter, the Anzac Mounted Division supported by the Imperial Camel Brigade were on the offensive, pursuing the German and Ottoman army many miles across the Sinai Peninsula, reversing in a most emphatic manner the defeat <b>suffered</b> <b>at</b> Katia three months earlier.|$|E
