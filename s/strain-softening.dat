Strain-softened soils, e.g. loose sands, can be triggered to collapse, either monotonically or cyclically, if the static shear stress {{is greater than the}} ultimate or steady-state shear strength of the soil. In this case flow liquefaction occurs, where the soil deforms at a low constant residual shear stress. If the soil strain-hardens, e.g. moderately dense to dense sand, flow liquefaction will generally not occur. However, cyclic softening can occur due to cyclic undrained loading, e.g. earthquake loading. Deformation during cyclic loading will depend on the density of the soil, the magnitude and duration of the cyclic loading, and amount of shear stress reversal. If stress reversal occurs, the effective shear stress could reach zero, then cyclic liquefaction can take place. If stress reversal does not occur, zero effective stress is not possible to occur, then cyclic mobility takes place.|$|E

40|$|The tensile and elastic {{properties}} of segmented copolyetheresteramides with crystallisable aramid units of uniform length were investigated. The aramid concentration ranged from 3 to 30 wt%. The effect of type of poly(tetramethyleneoxide) (PTMO) segment, having a different tendency to crystallise, on the tensile and elastic properties was studied. The fracture {{stress of the}} polymers {{was found to be}} mainly affected by the degree of strain-induced crystallisation of the PTMO phase and the molecular weight of the polymers and not by the aramid content. The fracture strain of the polymers is exceptionally high, ranging from 1300 to 2200 %. The shear modulus increased strongly with aramid content and ranged from 1. 5 to 118 MPa. The uniform aramid units are very effective in forming physical crosslinks. The yield stress increased linearly with the aramid content. The yield stress and the log modulus are nearly linearly related for materials with these uniform length crystallisable units. The change of the modulus as a function of prestrain was studied. Up to 160 – 180 % pre-strain the modulus decreases by a factor of 6 – 8, however, at higher strains the moduli increased again. The strong strain softening effect in the first 160 % strain must be due the breaking up of the interconnecting lamellar structure. The healing of the modulus of <b>strain-softened</b> samples was studied with time. The healing was very slow. The materials, especially the low-modulus types, are highly elastic. The stress relaxation decreases with decreasing aramid content and the compression set was found to have a minimum at 9 wt% aramid.

40|$|In this thesis, the 3 D {{structure}} and kinematics of the locally and mildly inverted Lower Austria Mesozoic Basin beneath the Alpine-Carpathian fold-and-thrust belt is described. This {{study has been}} carried out by the integrative interpretation of 2 D and 3 D seismic surveys, well and geophysical logs data and gravity maps. A basin-scale, 3 D structural model {{has been carried out}}, focused on the sub-thrust and foreland zones. The Late Eocene to Early Miocene Alpine–Carpathian fold-and-thrust belt resulted from the subduction of the European plate beneath the Adriatic one, and the subsequent continental collision between both plates. The Alpine–Carpathian foredeep and fold-and-thrust belt recorded the long-lasting involvement of the European crystalline basement in several deformation events: from late Variscan transtension, to Jurassic rifting, and Cretaceous to Neogene shortening. In this thesis, two additional basement fault reactivation events have been defined in relation to the Alpine-Carpathian Cenozoic shortening: an extensional reactivation event related to the bending of the European plate coeval with Egerian to Karpatian (ca. 28 – 16 Ma) thin-skinned thrusting; followed by the selective positive inversion of the basement faults in the sub-thrust and in the foreland during Karpatian to Badenian times (ca. 16 - 12. 5 Ma). The flexural bending of the European plate and the associated extensional fault reactivation were promoted by high lateral gradients of lithospheric strength in addition to the slab pull forces associated with subduction. Delamination of the European lithosphere during the final stages of collision around Karpatian times (ca. 16 Ma) promoted a large-wavelength uplift and an excessive topographic load. This topographic load was compensated by broadening the orogenic wedge through the compressional reactivation of the inherited fault array in the Euroepan plate beneath and ahead of the thin-skinned thrust system. Ultimately, collapse and deep burial of the Alpine-Carpathian tectonic wedge took place by the formation of the Pannonian basins system. To gain further insights in the deformational processes in sub-thrust and foreland settings, sandbox analogue models of brittle and brittle-viscous sand wedges have been carried out. The models aimed testing the influence of different topographic loads (i. e., thrust wedges) on the sub-thrust inversion of extensional basins, as well as the influence of the initial orientation of the extensional basins, and {{the presence or absence of}} weak detachment layers. Segmented half-graben basins -striking at 90 º, 45 º and 15 º to the extension direction- were created first, and then shortened using different angles for the basal detachment and topographic slope. A shallow layer of viscous polymer over the half- graben basin was included in one of the models. The experiments were analysed using time-lapse photography, topography laser scans and image-based 3 D voxels. The modelling results indicate a deformation sequence characterised by layer-parallel compaction, fault reactivation, thrust propagation and related folding. Fault reactivation and basin inversion were associated with layer-parallel compaction accomplished by slip along the basal detachment, prior to and in between pulses of thrusting. The results of the sandbox analogue models reveal a fundamental control imposed by the vertical load of the tectonic wedge and its integrated strength profile in the inversion of sub-thrust basins. Small vertical loads or strong gradients of vertical load have revealed as fundamental factors aiding in the inversion of buried, sub-thrust basins. The integrated strength profile resulted from the combination of inherited, <b>strain-softened</b> fault zones, as well as the presence or absence and distribution of weak, viscous horizons. The results of the sandbox models carried out indicate that the vertical load, its gradient over the sub-thrust basins and the inherited, <b>strain-softened</b> faults, are more important than the obliquity between the direction of shortening and the orientation of pre-existing fault systems. As indicated by the results of sandbox analogue models, the recurrent and long-lasting frictional reactivation of the Lower Austria basement fault array may have been favoured by fault-weakening mechanisms, as well as by steep gradients of vertical loads generated by thin-skinned out- of-sequence stacking of the Rhenodanubian Flysch located south of the inverted basement fault array...|$|R

In finite-difference method (FDM) differential equilibrium equations (i.e. strain-displacement and stress-strain relations) are solved. finite element method (FEM) uses the approximations to the connectivity of elements, continuity of displacements and stresses between elements. Most of numerical codes allows modelling of discrete fractures, e.g. bedding planes, faults.

5000|$|Also, in general, volume {{change is}} governed by {{considerations}} from elasticity and, this assumption being largely untrue for real soils, results in very poor matches of these models to volume changes or pore pressure changes. Further, elasto-plastic models describe the entire element {{as a whole and}} not specifically conditions directly on the failure plane, as a consequence of which, they do not model the stress-strain curve post failure, particularly for soils that exhibit <b>strain-softening</b> post peak. Finally, most models separate out the effects of hydrostatic stress and shear stress, with each assumed to cause only volume change and shear change respectively.

Consequently, models based on a metals based theory of plasticity are not able to model behavior of soils that is a result of anisotropic particle properties, one example of which is the drop in shear strengths post peak strength, i.e., <b>strain-softening</b> behavior. Because of this elasto-plastic soil models are only able to model [...] "simple stress-strain curves" [...] such as that from isotropic normally or lightly over consolidated [...] "fat" [...] clays, i.e., CL-ML type soils constituted of very fine grained particles.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} use intracrystalline {{deformation}} structures in quartz as palaeopiezometer and as indicator of palaeostress/strain orientation, the microstructure formation processes and the controlling parameters should be fully constrained. Reviewing genetic interpretations of quartz deformation microstructures {{in the literature}} shows that many often genetically inspired terms are being intermixed. Moreover, the formation processes of these microstructures are still disputed. Therefore, a purely descriptive terminology is proposed, categorising the intracrystalline extinction bands: fine extinction bands (FEBs), wide extinction bands (WEBs) and localised extinction bands (LEBs) of which the LEBs are subdivided in blocky (bLEB), straight (sLEB) and granular (gLEB) morphological types. With polarised light microscopy, FEBs are narrow (< 5 µm wide), densely spaced bands with a difference in extinction angle < 5 °. WEBs are broader (< 100 µm wide) bands with a difference in extinction angle < 20 °, sub-parallel to the projection of the c-axis towards the thin section. LEBs occur in conjugate sets showing opposite crystal lattice rotations (< 60 °) {{with respect to the}} crystal lattice outside the LEBs. Vein-quartz samples from the High-Ardenne slate belt (Belgium, Germany), (de-) formed at different stages during the late Palaeozoic Variscan orogeny, are selected because of their well-known (de-) formation history reconstructed in previous studies. Using polarised light microscopy, universal stage microscopy, a range of scanning electron microscopy techniques (forescatter imaging, electron backscatter diffraction and cathodoluminescence) and transmission electron microscopy bright field imaging, we contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the extinction band formation processes and the interplay between brittle and crystal-plastic deformation. A close relationship between fluid inclusions and the deformation microstructures is shown to be more important than previously thought. Fluid inclusions are suggested to cause strain softening, to impede crystal-plastic deformation and in some cases to be redistributed themselves. FEBs are demonstrated to represent a range of different nanostructures arising from a variety of formation processes. Moreover, two new nanostructures are identified that are not related to FEBs before. FEBs observable with polarised light microscopy can result from the optical effect of bands with a variable crystal lattice orientation, or of bands with a high dislocation density. Multiple FEBs per grain are common. For WEBs parallel to the c-axis, we follow the interpretation as commonly presented in the literature, explaining WEBs as tilt walls formed by basal slip, though a bounding effect of fluid inclusion planes is additionally emphasized. Similar to WEBs, bLEBs are suggested to form by crystal-plastic deformation, bounded by existing fluid inclusion planes. bLEBs form parallel to the orientations of maximum shear stress by a range of slip systems. The blocking of dislocations against fluid inclusions causes fluid inclusion decrepitation, with the shape of the decrepitated fluid inclusions in turn affecting the crystal-plastic deformation. Two types of sLEBs are distinguished, fluid inclusion-rich continuous extinction bands and fluid inclusion-poor en échelon arranged extinction bands. The first type is related to crystal-plastic deformation taking place inside the width of a fluid inclusion plane. The fluid inclusions are commonly redistributed parallel to FEBs present, or parallel to the involved slip plane. The second type of sLEBs are interpreted to be elongate subgrains formed by difficultly activated slip systems, in <b>strain-softened</b> zones, or in WEBs that are strain hardened with regards to the easy slip systems. gLEBs form in zones of intense strain, by dislocation pile-up against particles (e. g. fluid inclusion, micas) and subsequent recovery. Dauphiné twin boundaries are never considered crucial in the microstructure formation, they merely influence each other. We do not recommend FEBs for palaeopiezometry. FEBs and LEBs are, however, not randomly oriented and can therefore be used as indicators for palaeostrain and possibly palaeostress, on the condition that a high amount of orientation data is collected, as not all FEBs and LEBs are formed parallel to the maximum shear stress orientation. For every studied deformation microstructure, a new or adapted formation process is put forward. Especially the interaction between crystal-plastic deformation and fluid inclusions, and the geometrical relationships between the microstructures are innovative. Since the proposed formation processes are diverse, the use of a purely descriptive terminology for the microstructures is highly recommended. status: publishe...|$|R

It was also through the study commissioned by the Corps of Engineers (who after WWII became concerned about the influence of a possible atomic blast on the stability of embankments of the Panama Canal) that led Casagrande to become one of the first persons in the world to investigate the dynamic strength of soils.

5000|$|Zdeněk Bažant’s {{main focus}} is on {{mathematical}} modeling in mechanics of materials and structures. He has {{made significant contributions to}} several important engineering fields. E.g., in 1976 he showed by stability analysis that the concept <b>strain-softening</b> (then regarded by mechanics gurus as “insane”) does make sense if there is a finite material characteristic length that limits strain localization. Then, in 1983, he published a paradigm changing paper on the crack band model, which presented a simple way to handle nonlocal damage and avoid spurious mesh sensitivity. Both papers were hardly cited for two decades but then the citations exploded (even though the 1983 paper was declined in a premier American journal and then published in a French journal little known at that time; the citations of this papers now run several hundred a year and in 2016 exceeded 2600, on Google). The crack band model is now embedded in various commercial programs and is applied in user’s subroutines for concrete, rocks and comosites, and is the mainstay in design of large commercial composite airframes (e.g., at Boeing). [...] It was similar with Bažant’s (by now classical) material models for nonlocal damage, for energetic (non-statistical) size effect in quasibrittle fracture, for microplane constitutive modeling, for a solidifying material model for concrete creep, for calculations of moisture diffusion in nano-pores of concrete, and for his solution of elastic three-dimensional singularities at skew intersections of crack front line with a surface. They all became highly cited only recently. So did. his monumental treatise on stability of structures, innovative in treating the stability of fracture and damage, thermodynamics of structural stability, and objective stress rates for 3D bodies. Ditto his pioneering books on fracture and size effect in concrete, on concrete at high temperatures, and on concrete creep and shrinkage. Bažant is best known as the world leader in scaling research in solid mechanics. Bažant size effect law, with his demonstrations (mainly in six papers during 1976-91) of damage localization instabilitites and of spurious dependence of the early <b>strain-softening</b> models on element size, {{took a long time to}} sink in. But eventually it changed the design computations in concrete and geotechnical industry, and impacted the design practice in fiber composites (for large aircraft, ships and, car crashworthiness). The RILEM standard recommendation for testing of fracture energy and characteristic length of concrete (FMT/1990) is based on Bažant’s law. [...] Later Bažant extended his scaling research to statistical size effect. Exploiting the frequency law of interatomic bond breaks, he showed that, due to fracture process zone finiteness, the statistical strength of quasibrittle structures follows a graft of Gauss and Weibull distributions and exhibits a strong size effect, causing the safety factors and static and fatigue lifetimes of quasibrittle structures to be size dependent. He demonstrated that disregard of size effect was a major factor in many structural failures. His proposals of code provisions taking into account the size effect on shear failures of beams and slabs has been endorsed by ACI Committee 446 but not yet accepted for the ACI concrete design code. [...] Bažant’s microplane model for softening damage in concrete, rocks, composites, etc., in which the constitutive law is written in terms of stress and strain vectors on a generic plane, trades conceptual simplicity and clarity of physical interpretation for higher computational demands, which initially stifled applications but recently ceased to be an obstacle. The microplane model is now included in large-scale computer codes at U.S. national labs (EPIC, PRONTO, etc.) and in various commercial codes (ATENA, DIANA, SBETA, OOFEM). His microplane model for jointed rock is embedded, e.g., in ANSYS. With the microplane model, Bažant was able to capture the `vertex’ effect in softening damage, which is important for dynamics but cannot be simulated with the classical tensorial constitutive models (for concrete he also demonstrated by tests). He showed experimentally and theoretically that material strain softening reverses to hardening when the loading rate suddenly increases. [...] Bažant further made major theoretical and experimental contributions to the sustainability problems of infrastructure, to high temperature effects in nuclear containments and in tunnels exposed to fire, to thermodynamics and nano-mechanics of creep and shrinkage in hydrating cement, and to 3D singularities at fracture surface intersections. His Model B3 for practical prediction of concrete creep and shrinkage, calibrated by a worldwide database of thousands of laboratory tests assembled by his assistants, became an international standard recommendation (RILEM-CGS/1991). His nonlinear diffusion model for concrete is featured in Eurocode and widely used in durability analysis. His simple age-adjusted effective modulus method for concrete structure taking into account multi-decade chemical aging is embedded in the Eurocode as well as ACI standard recommendation. His unconditionally stable ‘exponential’ algorithm for rate-type concrete creep law is now standard in structural computations. [...] In finite strain theory and structural stability analysis, Bažant was the first to resolve the decades-old controversy about the 3D stability theories of Engesser, Haringx, Hencky, Truesdell, Biot, etc., as applied to soft-in-shear structures. In 1971, he showed by energy variational analysis that these theories correspond to different choices of objective stress rate and are all equivalent upon certain transformations of the tangential elastic moduli, and that some objective stress rates used in Abaqus, Ansys, LS-Dyna and other commercial codes do not conserve energy. This 1971 result was generally ignored until, a few years ago, Bažant demonstrated that the energy conservation error is non-negligible and can be of the order of 100% in the case of highly orthotropic structures, orthotropic damage, or high compressibility. Furthermore, he provided a coherent mechanical explanation of the collapse of WTC Towers in New York, and then derived the crush-down and crush-up differential equations of progressive collapse of tall buildings. [...] Bažant also developed a theory of the destructive alkali-silica reaction (ASR) in concrete (including the diffusion of expanding gel) which matches test results; a theory on hundred year prediction of concrete creep based on inverse analysis of observed excessive bridge deflections, coupled with Bayesian extrapolation of short-time test data; and predictions models B3 and B4 for concrete creep and shrinkage (both drying and chemical-autogenous) which became standard international recommendations of RILEM. He also formulated new theory chemical aging due to cement hydration from hours to centuries at variable temperature and humidity, and a theory for of microprestress (eigenstress) in hydrated cement originating from disjoining pressures of hindered adsorbed water in nanopores. He extended his probabilistic theory of quasibrittle failure to the size effect on residual strength and lifetime, and on Paris law the cyclic crack growths in quasibrittle materials, and showed an analosy with dielectric breakdown. He demonstrated his non-statistical size effect for the fracture of bones and of dental materials. [...] Recently, with his motivated group of assistants, Bažant works on stability and propagation of hydraulic fracture in gas or oil shale and mitigation of environmental risks of fracking; on size effect in fatigue crack growth in quasibrittle materials; and on energy absorption in composite crush cans for cars. Considering the body forces do to water diffusing into shale pores, he showed that hydraulic fracture must branch laterally, and determined their spacing inversely, based on gas production observations. He formulated a new theory of comminution of solids under impact due to release of kinetic energy of high-rate shearing, analogous to turbulence. He examined critically the new theory of ‘peridynamics’ and showed its limitations. Bažant strives in his contributions for practical relevance, originality, clarity and mathematical simplicity. Despite engaging in some super-computer simulations, he prefers analytical approaches as a way to reach deeper understanding, even at the cost of inevitable simplifications. At the same time, he has always extensively validated his results by experimental data and, when facing a vacuum of experimental evidence, conducted a host of innovative experiments with his own research team.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{two-dimensional}} {{finite element}} formulation for imbricate non-local <b>strain-softening</b> continuum is presented and numerically demonstrated. The only {{difference from the}} usual, local finite element codes is that certain finite elements are imbricated, i. e., they regularly overlap while skipping the intermediate mesh nodes. The element imbrication is characterized by gener-ating proper integer matrices that give the numbers of the nodes for each finite element and the numbers of the imbricate elements overlapping each local ele-ment. The number of unknown displacements remains {{the same as for}} a local finite element code, while the number of finite elements approximately dou-bles. Numerical results show that stable two-dimensional <b>strain-softening</b> zones of multiple-element width can be obtained, and that the solution exhibits proper convergence as the mesh is refined. The convergence is demonstrated for the load-displacement diagrams, for the strain profiles across the <b>strain-softening</b> band, and for the total energy dissipated by cracking. It is also shown that the local formulations exhibit incorrect convergence; they converge to solutions for which the energy dissipation dlde to failure is zero, which is physically unac-ceptable.

40|$|Damage {{models are}} {{developed}} within the continuum damage mechanics framework {{which allows the}} description of material degeneration with general constitutive equations. The difficulty {{in the description of}} damage behaviour increases with increasing complexity of the material behaviour. This is especially true when it comes to composite materials which have an orthotropic material behaviour. The conventional description of damage, i. e. the local continuum damage mechanics description, leads to <b>strain-softening</b> behaviour which is characterised by a decline in stress with simultaneously increasing strain. Due to <b>strain-softening</b> the tangent stiffness becomes negative which forces the wave speed to become imaginary in dynamic problems. Consequently the partial differential equations governing the dynamic problem change from hyperbolic to elliptic and, therefore, the initial boundary value problem no longer has a unique solution. Due to this the physical meaning becomes unrealistic. <b>Strain-softening</b> is limited to an infinitely small area in which waves are not able to propagate in a process called wave trapping. A displacement discontinuity in an area of width zero (localisation zone) develops. The strain becomes infinite in this zone and is accompanied with a zero stress. Areas outside the softening zone are not able to interact with the <b>strain-softening</b> domain. As a consequence the <b>strain-softening</b> domain acts similar to a free boundary at which waves reflect. The implementation of local continua with <b>strain-softening</b> behaviour in finite element codes leads to additional numerical problems. <b>Strain-softening</b> behaviour manifests itself in the smallest area possible which is a single point in analytical considerations. This area is defined by the element discretisation in finite element codes. Therefore, <b>strain-softening</b> leads to a pronounced mesh sensitivity of results in addition to mathematical and physical issues. This work aims to find a solution which removes problems associated to strain- softening. Its aim is to represent material behaviour due to damage realistically and enable numerical results to convergence to a unique solution. The <b>strain-softening</b> problem is the focus of this work. It was investigated using a 1 D wave propagation problem described by Bažant and Belytschko [1]. This simple experiment allows for an easy comparison of analytical and numerical results and therefore gives an insight into the problems connected to <b>strain-softening.</b> Furthermore, regularisation methods, specifically nonlocal and viscous methods, were investigated. Regularisation methods add additional terms to constitutive equations which keep the initial boundary value problem well-posed and enable a unique solution independent of the element discretisation. It was found that these methods are indeed capable of regulating the softening problem; however, they add additional difficulties in the description of material behaviour. A new approach to the <b>strain-softening</b> issues, unique at this point of time, was developed in this work which implements damage as an equivalent damage force. This approach is able to keep the initial boundary value problem stable and converge to a unique solution without adding additional terms in the constitutive equations, such as regularisation methods. This new approach to <b>strain-softening</b> was implemented for an isotropic material with scalar damage variable in DYNA 3 D successfully. Numerical results converged to a unique solution and were physically reasonable. The concept of an equivalent damage force was further developed to orthotropic material behaviour. This made an advanced representation, using an 8 th rank damage tensor, necessary. The 8 th rank damage tensor is able to represent anisotropic damage and it is also the most general damage representation possible...|$|E
40|$|We report linear and {{non-linear}} shear {{tests on}} rat skin, evidencing a <b>strain-softening</b> regime, from 1 % to 50 % strain, {{followed by a}} strong strain-hardening regime, leading to a ?deck chair-shaped? stress-strain curve. The <b>strain-softening</b> regime was never reported as such in the literature, possibly mistaken for the linear regime in experiments starting above 1 % deformation.

40|$|Feasibility of {{applying}} probabilistic FEM for random <b>strain-softening</b> media is explored. Based upon the incremental theory, a modified initial stress method is introduced associated with displacement control technique {{to deal with}} the <b>strain-softening</b> problem. A probabilistic finite-element formulation for <b>strain-softening</b> media is proposed based on the direct differentiation scheme on the suggested modified initial stress method. Adjoint vector method is applied to save the computational time for the problem involving large amount of random variables. An efficient reliability evaluation is then performed by the proposed probabilistic FEM, and displacement Taylor expansion scheme is suggested to avoid re-factorization of global stiffness matrix during the iterative computation of design point. A numerical example is given to demonstrate the proposed method. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in the literature regularize the <b>strain-softening</b> response of force-based frame elements by either modifying the constitutive parameters or scaling selected integration weights. Although the former case maintains numerical accuracy for strain-hardening behavior, the regularization requires a tight coupling of the element constitutive properties and the numerical integration method. In the latter case, objectivity is maintained for <b>strain-softening</b> problems; however, {{there is a lack}} of convergence for strain-hardening response. To resolve the dichotomy between strain-hardening and <b>strain-softening</b> solutions, a numerically consistent regularization technique is developed for force-based frame elements using interpolatory quadrature with two integration points of prescribed characteristic lengths at the element ends. Owing to manipulation of the integration weights at the element ends, the solution of a Vandermonde system of equations ensures numerical accuracy in the linear-elastic range of response. Comparison of closed-form solutions and published experimental results of reinforced concrete columns demonstrates the effect of the regularization approach on simulating the response of structural members...|$|E
40|$|Nonlocal {{continuum}} {{damage mechanics}} and random field theory {{are used to}} model the stochastic damage behavior of a <b>strain-softening</b> material with random field properties, The randomness in the damage process is introduced by considering the initial damage threshold and the local <b>strain-softening</b> behavior as a bivariate random Nataf field, defined by the marginal distributions and correlation matrix. A key component of the model is the introduction of two different length parameters: the characteristic length of the nonlocal damage model and the correlation distance for the random field. The probabilistic nonlocal damage model is illustrated by presenting finite-element analyses of direct-tension tests. It is found that the specimen exhibits a structural behavior representing a nonsymmetrical deformation and nonlinear stress-displacement curve. The influence of the crosscorrelation coefficient between the initial damage and the <b>strain-softening</b> behavior is discussed. The probabilistic nonlocal damage model is also capable of describing the deterministic and probabilistic size effect of structures. status: publishe...|$|E

In the present study, 1 g model tests are carried out to investigate the effect of cyclic loading on the bearing capacity of plate anchors in clay. The ultimate pullout capacity of plate anchors in clay decreases as the accumulated plastic shear strain grows due to the <b>strain-softening</b> of clay under cyclic loading.

40|$|Â© 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. In the {{presented}} article, the <b>strain-softening</b> {{process in}} rubber compounds filled with carbon black is investigated. First people to observe this process were Fletcher and Gent in 1954. Later, Payne did an extensive {{investigation of the}} process thus the test is generally known as Payne effect test. Based on the measured data, so-called Payne softening can be calculated. The Payne softening is broadly considered as {{the measure of the}} <b>strain-softening.</b> In order to investigate <b>strain-softening</b> behavior of a filled rubber compound several strain amplitudes are imposed during a Payne effect test. In this article, a two-point (rapid) version of the test containing only two strain amplitudes is introduced and verified statistically. This test has shown that for the investigation of the filler network disintegration in filled rubbers primarily the large deformations are important, notwithstanding the strain history of a sample. Moreover, the softening characteristic is observed in 30 % of the time of the original test. The new method is exemplified for a study of three different rubbers filled with various carbon blacks...|$|E
40|$|A {{gradient}} enhanced {{model is}} formulated which simulates micro-structurally induced wave dispersion and {{is capable of}} achieving mesh objective results when modelling <b>strain-softening</b> materials. Length scale parameters are introduced to incorporate both micro-inertial effects and strain smoothing. The model is formulated such that all the gradient enhancement terms are contained within the kinetic energy functional, whilst all non-linear terms {{are linked to the}} strain energy functional. In addition, discretisation of the governing equations is performed in a manner such that only C 0 C 0 -continuity is required and is symmetric in the elastic range. Dispersion analysis is performed to show the correct format that a constitutive model must conform to in order that regularisation of <b>strain-softening</b> material models will occur. This dispersion analysis is then used to explore how the two length scales may influence the width of the zone in which strain localisation takes place. The efficacy of the model in simulating <b>strain-softening</b> behaviour in a mesh objective manner and the effects of wave dispersion on damage initiation and accumulation are demonstrated in numerical examples.

40|$|A pragmatic <b>strain-softening</b> {{constitutive}} model, {{which is}} based on Modified Cam Clay, was applied to the simulation of the progressive failure of an embankment constructed on a deposit of sensitive (<b>strain-softening)</b> clay in Saga, Japan. A comparison of the predictions for this case indicates that if softening is ignored, only relatively small deflections and consolidation settlements are predicted, especially after construction. In contrast, for the case where softening is included in the analysis, progressive failure within the clay induces large shear deformations and finally failure of the embankment is predicted. This comparison suggests that softening-induced progressive failure should be considered in the design of embankments on such soils, and the residual strength of the deposit may have an important influence on the overall factor of safety of the construction. Detailed analyses of predicted excess pore water pressures, shear strains and shear stress levels in the ground indicate that considering the <b>strain-softening</b> process: (a) is associated with the buildup of excess pore water pressure; (b) promotes strain localization; and (c) results generally in a larger zone of soil involved in the failure...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDue to the {{complexity}} of soil-structure interaction, simple constitutive models typically used for interface elements in general computer programs cannot satisfy the requirements of discontinuous deformation analysis of structures that contain different interfaces. In order to simulate the <b>strain-softening</b> characteristics of interfaces, a nonlinear <b>strain-softening</b> interface constitutive model was incorporated into fast Lagrange analysis of continua in three dimensions (FLAC 3 D) through a user-defined program in the FISH environment. A numerical simulation of a direct shear test for geosynthetic interfaces was conducted to verify that the interface model was implemented correctly. Results of the numerical tests show good agreement with the results obtained from theoretical calculations, indicating that the model incorporated into FLAC 3 D can simulate the nonlinear <b>strain-softening</b> behavior of interfaces involving geosynthetic materials. The results confirmed the validity and reliability of the improved interface model. The procedure and method of implementing an interface constitutive model into a commercial computer program also provide a reference for implementation of a new interface constitutive model in FLAC 3 D...|$|E

Specimens were heated at temperatures within the range 120 – 200 °C for 1 h. Fracture energy was measured using a single-edge notched bending test and the <b>strain-softening</b> index was estimated by dividing the fracture energy by the maximum load. Adsorption properties were estimated using adsorption isotherms. Fiber saturation points (FSPs) were estimated by extrapolating the moisture adsorption isotherm curve. Langmuir’s adsorption coefficient and number of adsorption sites were obtained using Langmuir’s theory and the Hailwood-Horrobin theory, respectively. The fracture energy, FSPs, and specimen weights decreased at temperatures higher than 150 °C, but the critical point for the <b>strain-softening</b> index {{and the number of}} adsorption sites was shown to be 180 °C. We hypothesize that the fracture energy and FSP depend on the chemical structure of the cell wall, whereas the <b>strain-softening</b> behavior may be influenced by the number of adsorption sites, and in turn the number of hydrogen bonds in hemicellulose...|$|E
40|$|The {{experimentally}} observed stress {{decline in}} displacement-controlled exper-iments {{is referred to}} as <b>strain-softening.</b> Although microcracking is a commonly accepted reason for strain softening, the majority of theoretical developments is purely macroscopic. To overcome inherent shortcomings of this approach, we propose a micromechanics-based damage propagation law by combining (i) the propagation law for a single penny-shaped crack embedded in an innite matrix subjected to remote stress (taken from linear-elastic fracture mechanics) and (ii) stiness estimates for RVEs of a material damaged by in-teracting microcracks (based on continuum micromechanics). This combination provides theoretical evidence that propagation of interacting microcracks results in tensile <b>strain-softening,</b> as is observed in macroscopic laboratory tests on brittle materials. The initial degree of damage, i. e. the initial crack size and the number of cracks per unit volume, implies two dierent types of tensile strain-softening: (i) continuous <b>strain-softening</b> in case of initial damage beyond a critical value, and (ii) instantaneous stress drop at the peak load ("snap-back") in case of initial damage below a critical value. ...|$|E
