However, a big challenge faced by manufacturers now is to deal with various RFID/Auto-ID technologies which are necessary in different production situations yet entailing different development technologies. This paper presents an innovative all-in-one <b>Smart</b> <b>Gateway</b> technology for capturing real-time production data from various manufacturing resources attached to different types of RFID/Auto-ID devices. Each of such manufacturing resources forms a smart object (SO) while agent concept is introduced for encapsulating the heterogeneous SOs.

Smart objects and agents are dynamically deployed and reconfigured at a <b>Smart</b> <b>Gateway</b> in a 'plug and play' fashion. The joint work among smart objects is governed by an agent-based workflow management (AWFM) mechanism.

40|$|This {{deliverable}} is {{a companion}} document {{to the initial}} releases of the Lab Owner and Cloudservices (Smart Device and <b>Smart</b> <b>Gateway)</b> that have been delivered at M 21. These firstreleases implement the revised version of the Smart Device and <b>Smart</b> <b>Gateway</b> specificationsas defined in the revised version of D 4. 1 (M 21). The deliverable describes the softwarecomponents available on GitHub together with their documentation and provides all relatedlinks. Next to that, this deliverable provides some additional background information andexplains to choices made. In this initial release of the lab-owner services dedicated to new remote labs, we consider 4 alternative Lab Server implementations. A dedicated Lab Server is considered as a plugsolution combining hardware and software layers linking a physical lab to the Internet. Thesefour solutions target implementation on either desktop or embedded computers. The formercorresponds to typically lab-owner implementation in academic institutions and scientificorganizations. The latter corresponds to an emerging scheme enabling large scale deploymentof remote labs at low cost. Two software alternatives are proposed to expose the lab server tovarious clients following the Smart Device specifications (D 4. 1). The first alternative is based onLabVIEW and corresponds to the mainstream solution. The second one is based on JavaScriptand enables implementation on compact embedded computers. Examples of physical labsplugged using the proposed solutions are provided as templates to enable new remote labimplementations by lab owners. As defined in D 4. 1, the Smart Device specification is meant for implementing new remote labs,while the <b>Smart</b> <b>Gateway</b> {{on the other hand}} as a cloud service is meant for integrating legacylabs shared through existing third parties remote lab management systems (RLMS) within theGo-Lab infrastructure.

The latter deliverable has been submitted atM 30, {{and is the}} final document detailing the solution devised by Go-Lab for integratingnew and legacy remote laboratories (labs) in its infrastructure. Go-Labprovides two approaches to integrate remote laboratories: the Smart Deviceand the <b>Smart</b> <b>Gateway</b> approaches. While the first corresponds to the developmentand deployment of new labs, the second is destined for existing labs. Yet,both implement the Smart Device Paradigm as presented in D 4. 5, and brieflypresented in the Introduction of this document. Starting from the specificationspresented in D 4. 5, lab owners {{are expected to be}} able to create/adapt andsmoothly deploy their labs in the Go-Lab platform. In this deliverable we provide templates for lab owners to use in order to interfacetheir new physical labs with embedded devices (the Smart Devices). Thetemplates provide the architecture skeleton for the laboratory server applicationfollowing the Smart Device paradigm. The templates implement a set ofspecifications to ensure that they are scalable, readable, and maintainable; insuringthe ease and augmented use of these templates. Using the templates,lab providers are not concerned about the architecture of their lab servers. Thistask is alleviated by the templates. The targeted platforms are Node. js on BeagleBoneBlack (BBB), and LabVIEW on myRIO. We also provide example labsimplemented with the produced packages, as well as with other platforms andtechnologies. We also provide support for existing online laboratory systems with the SmartGateway. The <b>Smart</b> <b>Gateway</b> supports both real laboratories (e. g. Remlabnet) and simulation (e. g.

The touching point between a sensor network and the Internet is the gateway which translates between the link-layer protocols used in the Internet (Ethernet, Wi-Fi) and sensor networks (IEEE 802. 15. 4).

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{a secure}} and {{efficient}} authentication and authorization architecture for IoT-based healthcare is developed. Security and privacy of patients’ medical data are {{crucial for the}} acceptance and ubiquitous use of IoT in healthcare. Secure authentication and authorization of a remote healthcare professional is {{the main focus of}} this work. Due to resource constraints of medical sensors, it is infeasible to utilize conventional cryptography in IoT-based healthcare. In addition, gateways in existing IoTs focus only on trivial tasks without alleviating the authentication and authorization challenges. In the presented architecture, authentication and authorization of a remote end-user is done by distributed smart e-health gateways to unburden the medical sensors from performing these tasks. The proposed architecture relies on the certificate-based DTLS handshake protocol as it is the main IP security solution for IoT. The proposed authentication and authorization architecture is tested by developing a prototype IoT-based healthcare system. The prototype is built of a Pandaboard, a TI SmartRF 06 board and WiSMotes. The CC 2538 module integrated into the TI board acts as a <b>smart</b> <b>gateway</b> and the WisMotes act as medical sensor nodes. The proposed architecture is more secure than a state-of-the-art centralized delegation-based architecture because it uses a more secure key management scheme between sensor nodes and the <b>smart</b> <b>gateway.</b> Furthermore, the impact of DoS attacks is reduced due to the distributed nature of the architecture.

40|$|The {{design of}} smart homes, {{buildings}} and environments currently {{suffers from a}} low maturity of available methodologies and tools. Technologies, devices and protocols strongly bias the design process towards vertical integration, and more flexible solutions based on separation of design concerns are seldom applied. As a result, the current landscape of smart environments is mostly populated by defectively designed solutions where application requirements (e. g., end-user functionality) are too often mixed and intertwined with technical requirements (e. g., managing the network of devices). A mature and effective design process must, instead, rely on a clear separation between the application layer and the underlying enabling technologies, to enable effective design reuse. The role of <b>smart</b> <b>gateways</b> is to enable this separation of concerns and to provide an abstracted view of available automation technology to higher software layers. This paper presents a blueprint for the information technology (IT) architecture of smart buildings that builds on top of established software engineering practices, such as model-driven development and semantic representation, and that avoids many pitfalls inherent in legacy approaches.
