50|$|Several factors {{affect the}} rate <b>of</b> <b>descent</b> in autorotation: density altitude, gross weight, rotor {{rotational}} speed, and forward airspeed. The pilot's primary {{control of the}} rate <b>of</b> <b>descent</b> is airspeed. Higher or lower airspeeds are obtained with the cyclic pitch control just as in normal flight. Rate <b>of</b> <b>descent</b> is high at zero airspeed and decreases to a minimum at approximately 50 to 90 knots, depending upon the particular helicopter and the factors previously mentioned. As the airspeed increases beyond the speed that gives minimum rate <b>of</b> <b>descent,</b> the rate <b>of</b> <b>descent</b> increases again. Even at zero airspeed, the rotor is quite effective as it has nearly the drag coefficient of a parachute despite having much lower solidity.|$|R
