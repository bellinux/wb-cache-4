5|$|Kenwood {{has three}} floors: {{on the ground}} floor during the Lennon period the front door opened onto an {{entrance}} hall, where Lennon placed a suit of armour and a gorilla suit. Across the hall was a large living room, which had black carpets, two 18-foot <b>sofas</b> <b>and</b> a marble fireplace. To the left of the hall was a toilet, and through the living room was a dining room, where purple, velvet wallpaper was put up. Adjacent to the dining room, {{at the back of the}} house, was a small sunroom. This was decorated with various pictures, caricatures and stickers, such as the one from the Safe as Milk debut album (1967) by Captain Beefheart & His Magic Band, and one advertising the Monterey Pop Festival. Photos published by The Beatles Book Monthly show the shelves of the sunroom filled with articles such as a large, ornate cross, a Mickey Mouse doll and a mortar and pestle, reportedly used by Lennon to mix various combinations of cocaine, amphetamine, barbiturates and LSD. There was also a yellow sofa or chaise-longue upon which Lennon would spend much of his time. It was a present from his aunt, Elizabeth Smith (née Stanley) also known as Mimi. Behind the sunroom was the split-level kitchen where state-of-the-art appliances were installed, so complex that a tutor had to come and give the Lennons lessons in their use.|$|E

25|$|The Yerevan Kiosk (Revan Köşkü) {{served as}} a {{religious}} retreat of 40 days. It is a rather small pavilion with a central dome and three apses for <b>sofas</b> <b>and</b> textiles. The fourth wall contains the door and a fireplace. The wall facing the colonnade is set with marble, the other walls with low-cost İznik blue-and-white tiles, patterned after those of a century earlier.|$|E
40|$|Purpose. Critical {{illnesses}} {{are assessed}} {{according to the}} sequential organ failure assessment (<b>SOFA)</b> <b>and</b> acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II. Circulating ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) is a biomarker generated under ischemic and oxidative conditions and may reflect disease severity in preoperative patients. This study investigated the correlations of IMA with <b>SOFA</b> <b>and</b> APACHE II scores in inpatients admitted for colorectal surgery. Methods. We examined 27 patients with advanced colorectal cancers (mean age 69 years, men/women = 15 / 12). Correlations between <b>SOFA</b> <b>and</b> APACHE II scores in addition to preoperative serum IMA and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were analyzed. Results. The mean IMA level was 0. 5 [*]AU, and the median CRP level was 0. 6 [*]mg/dL. Median scores for <b>SOFA</b> <b>and</b> APACHE II were 2 and 12 points, respectively. Significant positive correlations between IMA <b>and</b> <b>SOFA</b> (r= 0. 45, P< 0. 05) and IMA and APACHE II (r= 0. 45, P< 0. 05) were identified which remained significant in confounder-adjusted analyses. In contrast, weak correlations were observed between CRP <b>and</b> the <b>SOFA</b> <b>and</b> APACHE II scores. Conclusions. The positive correlations between IMA <b>and</b> both <b>SOFA</b> <b>and</b> APACHE II scores suggest that serum IMA measurements reflect the severity of systemic failure in patients admitted for colorectal surgery in the preoperative phase...|$|R

The Renaissance Revival-style mantel (likely installed in 1852) {{was replaced by a}} French Empire mantel purchased by President Monroe in 1819. Although the some period antiques were found and placed in the room, most of the furniture were reproductions. A suite of reproduction French Directoire upholstered chairs and white-painted caned reproduction English Regency furniture replaced a suite of overstuffed Turkish style <b>sofas</b> <b>and</b> chairs.|$|E
25|$|Fry was {{accepted}} to the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Clown College, in Venice, Florida {{at the age}} of 19, graduating in 1981. He toured with the circus for the 1981 and 1982 season. He had the honor of being trained by three of the world's four Master Clowns: Lou Jacobs, Frosty Little, and Bobby Kay. He trained in heavy object balancing, which included six-foot tables, small canoes, a twenty-five foot ladder, a running chainsaw, other people, <b>sofas,</b> <b>and</b> a television set. In 1981, he became a Guinness Book of World Records record holder as part of a group that juggled the most objects at one time.|$|E
25|$|Breakfast Time was {{the first}} BBC breakfast programme, with Ron Neil as producer. It was {{conceived}} {{in response to the}} plans of the commercial television company TV-am to introduce a breakfast television show. Breakfast Times first broadcast was on 17 January 1983 and was presented by Frank Bough, Selina Scott, Nick Ross and Russell Grant. The atmosphere of the set was intended to encourage a relaxed informality; a set that mimicked a living-room rather than a studio, with red leather <b>sofas,</b> <b>and</b> Bough and Ross wearing jumpers and open-necked shirts. This allowed for an unconventional mix of authoritative and highbrow news and informative and entertainment features that made the show dominate the new genre and trounce the anticipated threat by the star-name commercial TV rival. So, a senior government minister might be subjected to intense questioning while sitting on the red sofa, to be then included in the presentation of a food cooking demonstration. Breakfast Time lasted 150 minutes, initially being transmitted between 6.30 am and 9 ammoving to a 6.50 am to 9.20 am slot on 18 February 1985.|$|E

25|$|However, most First Class {{rooms were}} left intact, {{save for the}} Salon Riviera and Salon Fontainebleau. The former was {{transformed}} into the Club International (dubbed Club-I by Norway aficionados), where every element of the original décor was removed. The square columns were made round with vertical aluminium fluting, the walls were repainted in a cream with baby-blue in the ceiling and wall niches, and all the original artwork and furniture was removed. In the corner niches oversized, crystal encrusted Neptune statues were placed, and similar crystal garlanded busts sat on brackets on the forward bulkhead. Lounge seating, <b>sofas</b> <b>and</b> rattan chairs were placed amongst potted ferns, giving the room an overall Miami art-deco feel. Only the railings and bronze, star-shaped light fixtures were original to the room. The latter space was gutted and remade into Checkers Cabaret; a small show lounge with abstract chrome palm trees around the columns, red lacquered wall panels, and a black-and-white checker board dance floor, again evoking a 1920s jazz club. The First Class Library remained untouched, and still used for the same purpose, while the Salon Debussy {{was turned into a}} shop, though its bronze décor and distinctive ceiling remained intact. To either side of these rooms ran the original First Class promenade decks, which were now turned into main circulation halls along the ship's principal public deck; the starboard dubbed Fifth Avenue and the port as Champs-Élysées, complete with columnar advertising posts similar to those found in Paris.|$|E
500|$|As NeXT expanded, more {{office space}} was needed. The company rented an office at 800 and 900 Chesapeake Drive in Redwood City, also {{designed}} by Pei. The architectural centerpiece was a [...] "floating" [...] staircase with no visible supports. The open floor plan was retained, although furnishings became luxurious, with $5,000 chairs, $10,000 <b>sofas</b> <b>and</b> Ansel Adams prints.|$|E
500|$|The Leary Line withdrew in January 1867, {{selling its}} George Leary to the Old Bay Line. Two years later, the Norfolk Journal of August 2, 1869, {{described}} the vessel {{as having a}} [...] "gorgeous style of furniture and elegant fittings...magnificently furnished with upholstered <b>sofas</b> <b>and</b> lounges of rich red velvet...". Another competitor, the Chesapeake Steamship Company, began directly competing on the Baltimore-Norfolk route in 1874. Controlled by the Southern Railway, a rival of the RF, {{it would be a}} formidable competitor until 1941, when the two steamship lines merged. Cargo traffic was also booming in the 1870s as the South recovered from the Civil War, resulting in the Old Bay Line's freight revenue surpassing passenger revenue {{by the end of the}} decade.|$|E

500|$|Drake {{ended his}} studies at Cambridge nine months before graduation, and in autumn 1969 moved to London. His father remembered [...] "writing him long letters, {{pointing}} out the disadvantages of going away from Cambridge... a degree was a safety net, if you manage to get a degree, at least {{you have something to}} fall back on; his reply to that was that a safety net was the one thing he did not want." [...] Drake spent his first few months in the capital drifting from place to place, occasionally staying at his sister's Kensington flat, but usually sleeping on friends’ <b>sofas</b> <b>and</b> floors. Eventually, in an attempt to bring some stability and a telephone into Drake's life, Boyd organised and paid for a ground floor bedsit in Belsize Park, Camden.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of sale in 2008, Pikes Hotel had 29 bedrooms, with a pool, sauna, health centre, and tennis court. Today it has 26 rooms with {{king-sized}} beds, one restaurant named Room 39 which has received much critical acclaim, and 2 bars. As of 2009 it costs £157 {{to stay at the}} hotel. The rooms retain the sense of the original farmhouse, and are furnished in the Moroccan style with some heavy dark wood furnishings. The rooms each have different themes, including [...] "Honeysuckle" [...] and [...] "Sunset", the latter of which is set behind the middle of three dark wood doors {{on the second floor of}} a small outhouse. According to author Stephen Armstrong, this room had a [...] "modest sitting room with a huge antique mirror, plush <b>sofas</b> <b>and</b> a CD player which didn't work. The bedroom was enormous, and the bathroom was decorated in a vaguely Moroccan style with a curtained bath nestling behind a low arch.|$|E
500|$|In 1938, Pflueger {{sailed to}} Paris with Grover Magnin, {{head of the}} I. Magnin {{department}} store chain, aboard [...] The two men investigated French shopping ideas that could be brought back and used at American department stores. Pflueger gained ideas from the ship's famous Art Deco adornments. Magnin and Pflueger went to Venice and Milan as well, but found very little of use to them on their short European trip. The $3million I. Magnin store on Wilshire (currently the Wilshire Galleria) opened in Los Angeles on February 10, 1939 with an interior completely devoted to Pflueger's concept of luxuriously separate boutique spaces within which individual sales items would receive unique attention. Pflueger's interior was attuned to women's fashions: the ground level floor was laid with rose-beige marble from France, pink velvet counter tops held gloves for trying on, rose-beige leather panels covered {{the walls of the}} shoe salon and the same leather served as covering for <b>sofas</b> <b>and</b> chairs that were provided by Neel D. Parker, interior designer and Pflueger's fellow club member from The Family. Grover Magnin continued to work with Pflueger on three more stores into the 1940s.|$|E

500|$|Luce {{refused to}} take any action to save himself—he had told Baalham, before the second officer's departure, that [...] "the fate of the ship shall be mine". When {{he could no longer}} render {{assistance}} to those still on board, he climbed with his young son to his command post atop the starboard paddle box, and waited for the end. By this time, many on board had become resigned to their fate; they huddled together for comfort while some sang hymns or recited scripture. A few still frantically sought for means of survival; those who could not find a place on the raft lashed together anything that might float—chairs, stools, caskets, <b>sofas</b> <b>and</b> doors, while Holland continued to fire the cannon. Peter McCabe, a waiter on his first transatlantic voyage, later described the scene: [...] "Several persons were floating about on doors and beds... I seized hold of a door which had been taken down to save passengers, and went into the sea, where I left the door and got upon the raft... A great many persons were trying to get on the raft... Among the number who were on it I saw four ladies". Many were lost from the raft when it fouled the sinking hull—a section broke off, spilling its occupants into the sea. After this, McCabe counted seventy-two men and four women either on or clinging to the structure, as it moved slowly away from the ship.|$|E
2500|$|A chair {{cover is}} a {{temporary}} fabric cover for a side chair. [...] They are typically rented for formal events such as wedding receptions to increase the attractiveness of the chairs and decor. The chair covers may come with decorative chair ties, a ribbon to be tied as a bow behind the chair. Covers for <b>sofas</b> <b>and</b> couches are also available for homes with small children and pets.
