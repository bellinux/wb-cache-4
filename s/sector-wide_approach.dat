25|$|In October 2006 the Kenyan Government {{initiated}} a <b>Sector-Wide</b> <b>Approach</b> (SWAp) to harmonise {{the activities of}} the development partners, the co-ordination and the implementation of projects. The SWAp helps to improve the sector dialogue between the Ministry and the donors and to strengthen cross-sectoral links. A common sector policy framework, monitoring as well as a common sector program and strategy are being developed by the major donor agencies. Since 2007 an Annual Water Sector Review (AWSR) is carried out which helps to foster the alignment of donor projects among other things. The Development Partners have formed the Water Sector Technical Group (WSTG) to improve co-ordination and harmonisation among themselves, as well as a Water Sector Working Group (WSWG) to co-ordinate with the government. The WSTG is led by a troika and a chair that rotates on an annual basis. In 2012, the troika included Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden.|$|E

Altogether, US$150million {{were to be}} spent under the program, which started in 2008 and was {{expected}} to run for five years. The major development partner involved in the program was the Danish International Development Agency, which alone provided US$66million. The other partners were the African Development Bank (US$27million), the Austrian Development Agency (US$19million), the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (US$14million), the UK's Department for International Development (US$10million), the EU (US$9million), the German Deutsche Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit, and the GermanKfW (US$6million). The program aimed to support {{the achievement of the}} sector targets. It intended to serve about 1,410,000 people in rural areas, 373,000 people in rural growth centers (RGCs) (communities with a population between 2,000 and 5,000 people), and 155,000 in small towns directly with water and to give them access to basic sanitation and hygiene facilities. Besides the extension of water supply and sanitation in rural areas, RGCs, and small towns, the program included the following components: water resources management, sector program support for capacity building, and sector reforms and water for production.|$|E

40|$|<b>Sector-wide</b> <b>approaches</b> {{are being}} widely adopted {{as a new}} aid modality, {{incorporating}} government ownership, partnership and a move from project to programme support. The literature to date on their performance in practice is, at best, mixed. This article reviews these issues {{in the light of}} the experience of arguably the world's oldest and largest SWAp, the Bangladesh health sector programme. A positive picture emerges of an evolutionary institutional adaptation towards a programme approach, with positive systemic effects on government processes and a reduction in transaction costs in dealing with donors. There are, however, negative aspects, notably, donor dominance in 'dialogue', though with limited influence on the government's actual strategy. Copyright 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{past decade}} has {{witnessed}} an increasing concerns over the effectiveness of project-based development assistance {{and the promotion of}} <b>sector-wide</b> <b>approaches</b> (SWAps) to health as a means to increase donor collaboration, consolidate local management of resources and undertake the policy and systems reform necessary to achieve a greater impact on health issues. The concept has gained the support of both the World Bank and the World Health Organisation, as well as key bilateral donors, and dominates current initiatives in development assistance for health.

40|$|Excerpt} The {{sustainable}} livelihoods approach improves understanding ofthe livelihoods of the poor. It organizes {{the factors}} that constrain or enhance livelihood opportunities, and shows how they relate. It can help plan development activities and assess the contribution that existing activities have made to sustaining livelihoods. The sustainable livelihoods approach facilitates the identification of practical priorities for actions {{that are based on}} the views and interests of those concerned but they are not a panacea. It does not replace other tools, such as participatory development, <b>sector-wide</b> <b>approaches,</b> or integrated rural development. However, it makes the connection between people and the overall enabling environment that influences the outcomes of livelihood strategies. It brings attention to bear on the inherent potential of people in terms of their skills, social networks, access to physical and financial resources, and ability to influence core institutions...|$|R

In 2009, the group identified weaknesses in the set of controls used to protect against fraud and corruption in projects supported by IDA lending. In 2011, the group recommended the Bank provide recognition and incentives to staff and management for implementing activities which implement the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness principles of harmonization and alignment, promote greater use of <b>sector-wide</b> <b>approaches</b> to coordination, and explain the reasons why when a country's financial management system is not used so that the client country may address those shortcomings. It also recommended that the Bank collaborate with development partners to strengthen country-level leadership of development assistance coordination by offering greater financial and technical support. Development economists, such as William Easterly, have conducted research which ranked the IDA as featuring the most transparency and best practices among donors of development aid.|$|R

40|$|This paper explores {{some of the}} {{opportunities}} and challenges that the increasing move towards <b>sector-wide</b> <b>approaches</b> (SWAps) offer gender mainstreaming. SWAps, as {{a new approach to}} aid and development, are growing in number, particularly in more aid-dependent country contexts. The paper introduces what is understood by SWAps and then explores the concept of gender mainstreaming, with particular reference to health. At a theoretical level the paper discusses the potential synergies between the goals of SWAps and gender mainstreaming in terms of promoting equity, efficiency and sustainability in health outcomes. However, early discussions of the SWAps process in the health sector in different countries reveal some emerging tensions and dilemmas for gender mainstreaming strategies, which are discussed. These are the relationship between government and donors, the involvement of district and civil society in the SWAp process, and, possibly, an increasingly biomedical approach to health. The paper concludes by laying out questions for further discussion and experience sharing...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the impact of}} a number of external influences on targets for education in developing countries and on national plans {{for the development of the}} education sector. Both the external pressure to develop Poverty Reduction Strategies in developing countries and the Millennium Development Goal process influence national education targets and plans. The paper argues that key inputs to education are increasingly driven by non-educators and examines the influence of non-educators on teacher recruitment and deployment, classroom construction and textbooks. The paper identifies the trend among multilateral and bilateral donors to provide financial assistance through general budget support and examines some of the international evidence on the impact on education systems of: (i) stand-alone projects, (ii) assistance provided within <b>sector-wide</b> <b>approaches,</b> and (iii) general budget support. World Bank evaluations of each mode of support to education within Uganda are then examined and discussed. The paper concludes with some lessons for educators.

40|$|This paper {{identifies}} {{and discusses}} some key {{issues and challenges}} in financing agriculture in Sub-Saharan Africa. The analysis first reviews recent trends in agricultural financing focusing on both external and domestic sources. The paper then discusses {{a number of issues}} and challenges that affect agricultural financing in SSA. The four areas, which show a certain degree of inter-relationship, are: government commitment to support agriculture; the role of public and private sector; emerging aid modalities to agriculture; and financing regional public goods. The paper stresses the importance of ensuring that agriculture is prioritized in the political processes of countries and that the government and the private sector play their rightful role in the financing of African agriculture. The paper notes that while the emerging agricultural financing mechanisms such as budget support and <b>sector-wide</b> <b>approaches</b> (SWAPs) present opportunities for enhancing the volume and effectiveness of agricultural support, they pose challenges to both donors and recipients. The paper also notes that the financing of regional public goods (RPGs) in agriculture, which has great potential in Africa, will require up-scaling and innovative financing...|$|R

40|$|This article {{considers}} a parallel marginalisation of Education for All (EFA) as a {{holistic approach to}} education, and the civil society actors and coalitions who address sidelined Dakar goals of early childhood care and education, adult literacy, quality and non-formal education.

One corollary has been a focus on the Millennium Development primary education and gender goals. The 2009 inauguration of the Civil Society Education Fund, through the EFA Fast Track Initiative, offers potential for reversing the situation. I present evidence from critical discourse analysis (CDA) of EFA policy documentation and processes, including fieldwork and interviews with key policy actors, conducted from 2007 - 2009. I consider how language and intertextuality instantiate elements of dominant global discourses in national education policies, and demonstrate pervasive inequalities in policy participation...|$|R
40|$|A {{study in}} three {{countries}} (Bangladesh, Ethiopia and Uganda) assessed progress against the Paris Principles for Aid Effectiveness (AE) in three sectors – water, {{health and education}} – to test {{the assumption that the}} water sector is lagging behind. The findings show that it is too simplistic to say that the water sector is lagging, although this may well be the case in some countries. The study found that wider governance issues are more important for AE than having in place sector-specific mechanics such as <b>Sector-Wide</b> <b>Approaches</b> alone. National political leadership and governance are central drivers of sector AE, while national financial and procurement systems and the behaviour of actors who have not signed up to the Paris Principles – at both national and global levels – have implications for progress that cut across sectors. Sectors and sub-sectors do nonetheless have distinct features that must be considered in attempting to improve sector-level AE. In light of these findings, using political economy approaches to better understand and address governance and strengthening sector-level monitoring is recommended as part of efforts to improve AE and development results in the water sector. ...|$|R
40|$|Danida has {{provided}} {{financial support to}} research networks {{with a view to}} creating better synergies between research and policy/operations. Six networks were reviewed in the fields of health; poultry; agriculture; governance, economic policy and public administration; water; and the environment. The task of research networks in knowledge management is four-fold: knowledge (a) production; (b) dissemination; (c) application; and (d) impact. Research is expected to perform all these tasks. The effectiveness and efficiency of the networks were adversely affected by two main factors. First, the changing aid architecture has involved decentralisation; liberalisation and untying; and budget support and <b>sector-wide</b> <b>approaches,</b> all of which have posed formidable challenges with regard to funding mechanism for research components. Second, the incomplete restructuring of the research council design in Denmark has left the development research community in limbo. Overall, the networks have been successful in consolidating the Danish resource base. They have also largely been successful in disseminating research findings to Danida. The networks have been less effective in bringing relevant knowledge through to application in sector programmes, in large measure due to the new aid architecture. Little is so far known about impact. The costeffectiveness of the networks is difficult to assess in precise terms. As one-stop facilities their performance is fairly efficient...|$|R
