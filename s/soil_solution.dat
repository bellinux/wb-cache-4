25|$|A calcium {{silicate}} feedstock, made from processed steel slag, {{can also be}} used to neutralize active acidity in AMD systems by removing free hydrogen ions from the bulk solution, thereby increasing pH. As the silicate anion captures H+ ions (raising the pH), it forms monosilicic acid (H4SiO4), a neutral solute. Monosilicic acid remains in the bulk solution to play many roles in correcting the adverse effects of acidic conditions. In the bulk solution, the silicate anion is very active in neutralizing H+ cations in the <b>soil</b> <b>solution.</b> While its mode-of-action is quite different from limestone, the ability of {{calcium silicate}} to neutralize acid solutions is equivalent to limestone as evidenced by its CCE value of 90-100% and its relative neutralizing value of 98%.|$|E

50|$|A <b>soil</b> <b>solution</b> also {{experiences}} {{osmotic potential}}. The osmotic potential {{is made possible}} due {{to the presence of}} both inorganic and organic solutes in the <b>soil</b> <b>solution.</b> As water molecules increasingly clump around solute ions or molecules, the freedom of movement, and thus the potential energy, of the water is lowered. As the concentration of solutes is increased, the osmotic potential of the <b>soil</b> <b>solution</b> is reduced. Since water has a tendency to move toward lower energy levels, water will want to travel toward the zone of higher solute concentrations. Although, liquid water will only move in response to such differences in osmotic potential if a semipermeable membrane exists between the zones of high and low osmotic potential. A semipermeable membrane is necessary because it allows water through its membrane while preventing solutes from moving through its membrane. If no membrane is present, movement of the solute, rather than of the water, largely equalizes concentrations.|$|E

40|$|During weathering, stable {{isotopes}} of Si and Mg are fractionated in soils, directly impacting <b>soil</b> <b>solutions</b> {{and river}} signatures. In a monolithological catchment, isotopic variations in rivers {{would rather be}} related to pedogenic processes such as mineral dissolution, sequestration in secondary minerals via neoformaton or adsorption, and plant uptake. However, separating inorganic from biologically driven isotopic fractionation remains complex. The present study investigates Mg and Si isotope fractionation in <b>soil</b> <b>solutions</b> from four typical Icelandic soils from a basaltic catchment (Borgarfjördur) : Histic Andosol, Histosol, Gleyic Andosol, Brown andosol.

Our results show that only the processes related to vegetation activity significantly fractionate Ca isotopes within the watershed. These fractionations occur during Ca uptake by roots and along the transpiration stream within the larch trees. Biomass degradation then significantly influences the Ca isotopic compositions of <b>soil</b> <b>solutions</b> and <b>soil</b> leachates via the release of light Ca. Furthermore, organic and organo-mineral colloids originated from organic matter degradation are thought to affect the Ca isotopic composition of <b>soil</b> <b>solutions</b> by preferential scavenging of 40 Ca. This imprint of organic matter degradation on the δ 44 / 40 Ca of <b>soil</b> <b>solutions</b> is much more significant for the warmer south-facing slope of the watershed than for the shallow and cold soil active layer of the north-facing slope, indicating that the available stock of biomass and the decomposition rates are critical parameters that regulate the impact of vegetation on the soil-water system.

Finally, biologically induced Ca fractionation observed at the soil profile scale is not visible in stream and river waters, whose isotopic variability {{in the course of the}} year is likely controlled by the lithological heterogeneity of the sources.

40|$|Incipient warming of peatlands at {{high latitudes}} is {{expected}} to modify soil drainage and hence the redox conditions, which has implications for Fe export from soils. This study uses Fe isotopes to assess the processes controlling Fe export {{in a range of}} Icelandic soils including peat soils derived from the same parent basalt, where Fe isotope variations principally reflect differences in weathering and drainage. In poorly weathered, well-drained soils (non-peat soils), the limited Fe isotope fractionation in <b>soil</b> <b>solutions</b> relative to the bulk soil (Δ 57 Fesolution-soil = - 0. 11 ± 0. 12 ‰) is attributed to proton-promoted mineral dissolution. In the more weathered poorly drained soils (peat <b>soils),</b> the <b>soil</b> <b>solutions</b> are usually lighter than the bulk soil (Δ 57 Fesolution-soil = - 0. 41 ± 0. 32 ‰), which indicates that Fe has been mobilised by reductive mineral dissolution and/or ligand-controlled dissolution. The results highlight the presence of Fe-organic complexes in solution in anoxic conditions. An additional constraint on soil weathering is provided by Si isotopes. The Si isotope composition of the <b>soil</b> <b>solutions</b> relative to the soil (Δ 30 Sisolution-soil = 0. 92 ± 0. 26 ‰) generally reflects the incorporation of light Si isotopes in secondary aluminosilicates. Under anoxic conditions in peat soils, the largest Si isotope fractionation in <b>soil</b> <b>solutions</b> relative to the bulk soil is observed (Δ 30 Sisolution-soil = 1. 63 ± 0. 40 ‰) and attributed to the cumulative contribution of secondary clay minerals and amorphous silica precipitation. Si supersaturation in solution with respect to amorphous silica is reached upon freezing when Al availability to form aluminosilicates is limited by the affinity of Al for metal-organic complexes. Therefore, the precipitation of amorphous silica in peat soils indirectly supports the formation of metal-organic complexes in poorly drained soils. These observations highlight that in a scenario of decreasing soil drainage with warming high latitude peatlands, Fe export from soils as Fe-organic complexes will increase, which in turn has implications for Fe transport in rivers, and ultimately the delivery of Fe to the oceans...|$|R

N 2 O concentrations in <b>soil</b> <b>solutions</b> (0. 09 - 16. 6 mu g N 1 (- 1)) were affected by events such as dry-wet cycles but did not reflect to the actual, indirect N 2 O emission at the soil-stream interface. It was assumed that N 2 O emission was due to N transformation processes. The N 2 O concentration at the spring was three times higher than the N 2 O concentrations in the <b>soil</b> <b>solutions.</b> Nevertheless, indirect N 2 O emission was still subordinate (2 O. The weekly amount of indirect N 2 O emissions depended only on the stream flow rate (62 % of the total annual amount). For this reason it was necessary to measure indirect NO emission at short intervals and at the interface between soil and stream over a longer time period. Our results and the results of the reviewed studies show that the default IPCC emission factor (EF 5 -g = 1. 5 %) overestimates the indirect N 2 O emission from ecosystems. The emission factor should therefore be lowered to about 0. 1 - 0. 3 %. In addition, the results indicate that indirect N 2 O emission is an insignificant pathway in the N cycle of most ecosystems. However, final judgement will depend on long-term studies. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. [References: 46...|$|R
