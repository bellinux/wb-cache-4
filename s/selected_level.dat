6000|$|Love-Antics and Dances.—The curious love-gestures {{of various}} birds, {{especially}} of the Gallinaceæ, have already been incidentally noticed; so that little need here be added. In Northern America, large numbers of a grouse, the Tetrao phasianellus, meet every morning during the breeding-season on a <b>selected</b> <b>level</b> spot, and here they run round and round in a circle of about fifteen or twenty feet in diameter, so that the ground is worn quite bare, like a fairy-ring. In these Partridge-dances, {{as they are called}} by the hunters, the birds assume the strangest attitudes, and run round, some to the left and some to the right. Audubon describes the males of a heron (Ardea herodias) as walking about on their long legs with great dignity before the females, bidding defiance to their rivals. With one of the disgusting carrion-vultures (Cathartes jota) the same naturalist states that “the gesticulations and parade of the males {{at the beginning of the}} love-season are extremely ludicrous.” Certain birds perform their love-antics on the wing, as we have seen with the black African weaver, instead of on the ground. During the spring our little white-throat (Sylvia cinerea) often rises a few feet or yards in the air above some bush, and “flutters with a fitful and fantastic motion, singing all the while, and then drops to its perch.” The great English bustard throws himself into indescribably odd attitudes whilst courting the female, as has been figured by Wolf. An allied Indian bustard (Otis bengalensis) at such times “rises perpendicularly into the air with a hurried flapping of his wings, raising his crest and puffing out the feathers of his neck and breast, and then drops to the ground;” he repeats this manœuvre several times successively, at the same time humming in a peculiar tone. Such females as happen to be near “obey this saltatory summons,” and when they approach he trails his wings and spreads his tail like a turkey-cock.[116] ...|$|E

5000|$|A {{more recent}} {{hypothesis}} {{propose that the}} central nervous system does not eliminate the redundant degrees of freedom, but instead it uses all of them to ensure flexible and stable performance of motor tasks. The central nervous system makes use of this abundance from the redundant systems instead of restricting them like previously hypothesized. Uncontrolled Manifold (UCM) Hypothesis provides a way to quantify the muscle synergy. This hypothesis defines [...] "synergy" [...] a little differently from that stated above; a synergy represents an organization of elemental variables (degrees of freedom) that stabilizes an important performance variable. Elemental variable is the smallest sensible variable {{that can be used to}} describe a system of interest at a <b>selected</b> <b>level</b> of analysis, and a performance variable refers to the potentially important variables produced by the system as a whole.

Pressing the space bar {{at the main}} screen will start the game at the <b>selected</b> <b>level,</b> or at the default level E if no level has been selected. When the game has started the player can control the diamond-shaped character by using the arrow keys or the numeric keypad to move around and/or push blocks. To push blocks, simply move into them. To pull blocks, the player must be adjacent to a block, then hold down the space bar while moving into an empty square. The ability to pull blocks is only available on the easier levels (A-I). Using the numeric keypad to move around allows for better movement, because it allows the player to move in all eight directions without combining the arrow keys.

All three problems can be solved geometrically, but because of the possibility that hardware acceleration is directly used, it is far more elegant implementations using the stencil buffer: 1.

In doing so, the stencil buffer, pixel of each polygon to be assigned to a specific value for the ground to which they belong. The distance between these values should be at least two, because for each plane to be used two values for two states: in the shadows and bright. 4.
