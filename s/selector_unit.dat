I-Shift borrowed from old transmission technologies like non-synchronised main gears which allowed a reduction in size and weight and a countershaft brake to achieve more precise shift control while matching engine rpm to transmissions rpm e.g. TECU requests the EECU to correct engine rpm so as to synchronise the rpm to effect a smooth gear change, similar to double declutching.|$|R

40|$|A {{visualization}} method so far {{not mentioned}} in the literature has been recently developed by the authors as a useful validation supplement to numerical flowfield computations in the design of microfluidic devices. The method is based upon water vapour condensation on device channel walls. It is extremely easy to set up with minimum expense – and yet it is very reliable. As an application example, the paper shows the method used in study of properties of a microfluidic valve intended for switching gaseous sample flows in a microfluidic <b>selector</b> sampling <b>unit.</b> A scaled-up model of the valve was built, as usual, in transparent acrylic material, making possible observation and photo-recording of the deposition and subsequent drying of the condensed droplets. The scaling-up slowed down the time scale enough for investigating the transition processes which takes place as the flow in the valve is switched on and off. ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to interconnecting the supergrid system, the West Burton 400 kV substation also feeds {{into the local}} 132 kV network. This connection is made via two 240 MVA, 400/132 kV auto-transformers manufactured by Associated Electrical Industries. The windings consists of a tertiary winding, a common, a tapping and a series winding. They are arranged so that the helical single layer tertiary winding is nearest the core, the continuous disc common winding next, followed by the interleaved full-length helical type tapping winding and the multi-layer type series winding and line shield. A continuously transposed conductor was used to minimise eddy current losses and reduce the space requirement of the windings. High speed resistor tap changers are provided on the 132 kV side of each transformer, giving a tapping range of plus 15% to minus 5%. The tapping winding has 7 taps which {{in conjunction with a}} buck/boost switch provide fourteen steps. The fixed contacts of each of the two rotary tap <b>selector</b> <b>units</b> associated with each phase are connected to one half of the tappings from the windings while the moving contacts are connected to the diverter switches. The diverter switch assembly, together with the transition resistors and operating mechanism is mounted on top of the 132 kV bushing which forms {{an integral part of the}} tap changer. Erection of the transformer was carried out inside a translucent plastic dome, inflated by a small blower. This allowed the work to continue regardless of the weather and thus reduced the time normally taken for erecting large transformers in the open. By working day and night within the plastic dome the time for erection on site was reduced from an estimated 8 weeks to 3 weeks. Completely assembled, each transformer is 14.94 m (49 ft) long, 10.06 m (33 ft) wide, and weighs 325.1 tonnes (320 tons) made up of 154.4 tonnes (152 tons) of steel, 30.48 tonnes (30 tons) of copper, and 19.3 tonnes (19 tons) of insulation and 98,420 litres (26,000 gallons) of oil. The current line entries for the 132 kV switch house are North Greetwell - Lincoln 1, Retford - Worksop - Checkerhouse 2, North Greetwell - Lincoln 2 and Retford - Worksop - Checkerhouse 1 ...|$|R
40|$|The on-load {{tap changer}} (OLTC) is an {{inevitable}} part of a regulating transformer, which allows the fluent regulation of the power parameters on load without interruption. The purpose of the OLTC is on load switching on the transformer's primary side. This arrangement has to be reliable because of the setting of all parameters into network, namely current, voltage and power output. From there the constructional demands on switching devices appear, which are divided into on-load changers, off-load changers and off-circuit changers. Particularly OLTC is the most sophisticated arrangement among them and it consists of these parts: a diverter switch, upper part, <b>selector,</b> motor-drive <b>unit</b> and a driving shaft. The aim of the thesis was to analyze the technical function of these parts, to indicate important options and demands on functionality and trouble-free operation of the system, and to indicate and justify the possible direction of the OLTC development tendency and to present the kind of diagnostics. The result {{of the work is}} the presentation of a modern tap changing system TADS and its perspectives of using in regulation transformers.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the development and manufacture of a fluidic variable event control system for turret lathes, which can be programmed to give any desired tool-slide length of travel in increments of 0. 001 inch. The system consists of pneumatic-hydraulic machine actuating cylinders, fitted with sensors to provide machine information, and a control cabinet containing the logic, counter, address and programme systems. Control of events, such as the engagement of the cross-slide, change of feed etc., have been related to the ram-slide motion; fluid displaced from the ram-slide actuating cylinder is metered into either a storage tank or slave cylinders in the control cabinet which, repeat and amplify the motion. Sensing units fitted to the slave cylinders, are programmed to inform the Logic System when the machine slide has travelled the required distance for an event, which initiates command signals to the address system. Programming a selection of events, their sequence and distance to be travelled by a tooling arrangement is achieved by sing multi-channel selector units. Each unit has six programme channels and controls and event, such as the rate of feed for each turret face. On receipt of a start signal, programme channel number 1 of each <b>selector</b> <b>unit</b> is energised, turret face number 1 is presented to the component material and the events programmed take place. When the sequence of operations for that turret face have been completed, the slides return to their starting point. Indexing of the turret to present face number 2 energises programme channel number 2 to control events for this face. This process is repeated until turret face number 6 and programme channel number 6 has been used; the component has now been completed and the cycle is repeated. The programme is not pre-determined such as when using plug board, punched card or tape, and can be varied by shop floor personnel adjusting the programme selector units while the machine is in operation. This feature not only enables component lengths to be adjusted, but as the choice of such events as speed, feed, or when to start the cross-slide may be varied to suit the actual working conditions, optimum production performance is more readily achieved...|$|E
40|$|With {{the present}} contribution, we {{demonstrate}} that the baseline separation of ketoprofen enantiomers can be successfully achieved (α = 1. 09; R(S) = 1. 60) in the reversed-phase mode of elution with a commercially available anion-exchange-based chiral stationary phase, incorporating the quinine 2, 6 -diisopropylphenyl carbamate derivative as the enantioresolving unit. Focused modification of the eluent composition indicated a stereoselective role of hydrophobic and π-π interactions between the <b>selector</b> and selectand <b>units,</b> besides the prime ionic intermolecular interaction. The mechanistic hypotheses based on the chromatographic data were confirmed by in silico molecular dynamic simulations, which allowed us to establish the network of selector-selectand interactions underlying the stereorecognition process at a molecular level.
