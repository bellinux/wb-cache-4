We have developed relatively simple but effective mathematical models of multi-needle puncture prostate using nonlinear spring–damper model; based on Automatic Dynamic Analysis of Mechanical Systems or dynamics module, displacement simulation for prostate is performed, and simulation results indicate that the multi-needle puncture mechanism could reduce prostate displacement in the y- or z-direction. Then aiming at the limitation of human body structure space and seed implant needle insertion path, a revolute-revolute-translational-type prostate seed implantation robot with three-dimensional transrectal ultrasound navigation is designed.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to develop a dynamic mathematical model of the rectifier-inverter induction motor drive system from first principles using the MATLAB program. Two MATLAB friendly-user interfaces were developed that allow assessment of system stability for Light load - low frequency operation. The MATLAB programs developed can be used to study system stability for zero-input response as well as the complete system response. The linearized drive model was obtained by applying Small-Displacement Theory to the <b>static</b> <b>drive</b> system. System equations were derived, and a linear algebraic model was used to describe the system in steady state conditions. The dynamics of the system are presented in matrix form relating small changes in the terminal voltage and load torque to perturbations in currents and mechanical speed of the motor. The dynamic equations are incorporated in the two MATLAB programs. Two user-friendly interfaces were designed to facilitate investigating the effect of different system parameters on system stability. The results are displayed as contours of instability regions that change as machine or filter parameters change. It is worth mentioning that a similar work has been done by T. A Lipo and P. C Kruse in 1968 and 1969. However, due to limited computing facilities at that time, the approach and computer simulation used were more complicated.

40|$|Harmonic {{analysis}} in power systems {{is a challenge}} that is always evolving due to a constantly changing power grid. Advances in power electronics {{have led to the}} installation of many new non-linear power loads, such as power converters, arc furnaces and motor drive systems, which in turn change the existing infrastructure and inject new types of harmonics. This study analyzes a <b>static</b> Kramer <b>drive</b> system for its harmonic behavior. The system is broken down component-by-component and analyzed. The {{analysis in}}cludes classical harmonics of integer multiple of the fundamental frequency as well as sub-harmonics and interharmonics. This paper shows that there are significant harmonic issues in a <b>static</b> Kramer <b>drive</b> that are likely to be present in similar drive systems. Due to the unknown frequencies at which interharmonics and sub-harmonics arise it is difficult to estimate the magnitude and phase of these harmonics. It is proposed that state estimation techniques such as digital filtering coupled with windowing techniques can be used to properly pinpoint the frequency components, magnitudes and phases of harmonics, interharmonics and sub-harmonics in the motor drive systems. Once identified, the harmonics, interharmonics and sub-harmonics can be eliminated by means of passive filtering or self-tuning active filtering. The optimal methods of estimation of harmonics, interharmonics and sub-harmonics will be both developed analytically and through the means of simulation with the use of CAD tools such as PSCAD and MATLAB.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the nature (i. e. static or dynamic) of fusimotor drive to the flexor hallucis longus (FHL) and flexor digitorum longus (FDL) muscles during locomotion we recorded Ia and group II muscle spindle afferent responses to sinusoidal stretch (0. 25 and 1 mm amplitude, respectively, 4 – 5 Hz) in a decerebrate cat preparation. FHL Ia and group II afferents generally had increased discharge rates and decreased modulation to stretch throughout the step cycle, compared to rest, suggesting raised <b>static</b> γ <b>drive</b> at all locomotor phases. Although the modulation of Ia afferents was reduced during locomotion, most (13 of 18) showed a clear increasing trend during homonymous muscle activity (extension). This was consistent with phasic dynamic γ drive to FHL spindles linked with α drive. In agreement with previous reports, FHL gave a single burst of EMG activity during the step cycle while FDL α drive had two components. One was related to extension while the other comprised a brief burst {{around the end of}} this phase. Typically FDL Ia and group II afferents also had elevated firing rates and reduced modulation at all locomotor phases, again implicating <b>static</b> γ <b>drive.</b> Half the afferents (seven Ia, three group II) showed increased discharge during extension, suggesting phasic <b>static</b> γ <b>drive.</b> There was no γ drive associated with the late FDL α burst. In conclusion, the γ drives to FHL and FDL differed during locomotion. FHL, which has the α drive of a classic extensor, received γ drive that closely resembled other extensors. The γ drive of FDL, which exhibits both extensor and flexor α synergies, did not match either muscle type. These observations are compatible with the view that fusimotor drive varies in different muscles during locomotion according to the prevailing sensorimotor requirements...|$|R

This includes the conventional compensation features such as power factor improvements, harmonic compensation and neutral current elimination in a three-phase four-wire system.

The compensation based on instantaneous p-q-r theory is analysed comprehensively for the proposed compensator. A new approach to eliminate the neutral current completely from four-wire systems with p-q-r theory is suggested. A control system for multi-functional compensation is designed based on instantaneous p-q-r theory.
