5|$|Aas-paas barse, Dilli pani tarse, {{literally}} {{meaning it}} pours all around, while Delhi lies parched. An {{allusion to the}} sometimes <b>semi-arid</b> climate of Delhi, it idiomatically refers to situations of deprivation when one is surrounded by plenty.|$|E
5|$|Northwest Argentina is {{predominantly}} dry, hot, and subtropical. Owing to its rugged topography, {{the region is}} climatically diverse, depending on the altitude, temperature, and distribution of precipitation. Consequently, vegetation differs within these different climate types. In general, the climate {{can be divided into}} two main types: a cold arid or <b>semi-arid</b> climate at the higher altitudes, and warmer subtropical climate in the eastern parts of the region. Under the Köppen climate classification, the region has 5 different climate types: <b>semi–arid</b> (BS), arid (BW), temperate climate without a dry season and with a dry season (Cf and CW respectively), and an alpine climate at the highest altitudes.|$|E
5|$|The area {{inhabited}} by A. longicervia {{is thought to}} have experienced significant climatic fluctuations during the Early Cretaceous, ranging from arid or <b>semi-arid</b> to more humid conditions. The substrate in the region was mostly composed of lacustrine sediments and volcanic rocks.|$|E
5|$|A <b>semi-arid</b> desert or a steppe is {{a version}} of the arid desert with much more rainfall, {{vegetation}} and higher humidity. These regions feature a <b>semi-arid</b> climate and are less extreme than regular deserts. Like arid deserts, temperatures can vary greatly in semi deserts. They share some characteristics of a true desert and are usually located at the edge of deserts and continental dry areas. They usually receive precipitation from 250mm (10in) to 500mm (20in) but this can vary due to evapotranspiration and soil nutrition. Semi deserts {{can be found in the}} Tabernas Desert (and some of the Spanish Plateau), The Sahel, The Eurasian Steppe, most of Central Asia, the Western US, most of Northern Mexico, portions of South America (especially in Argentina) and the Australian Outback. They usually feature BSh (hot steppe) or BSk (temperate steppe) in the Köppen climate classification.|$|E
5|$|Butterflies {{navigate}} using a time-compensated sun compass. They can see {{polarized light}} and therefore orient even in cloudy conditions. The polarized light near the ultraviolet spectrum {{appears to be}} particularly important. Many migratory butterflies live in <b>semi-arid</b> areas where breeding seasons are short. The life histories of their host plants also influence butterfly behaviour.|$|E
5|$|For a city {{situated}} so {{near the}} equator, Mogadishu has a relatively dry climate. It {{is classified as}} hot and <b>semi-arid</b> (Köppen climate classification BSh), as with much of southeastern Somalia. By contrast, towns in northern Somalia generally have a hot arid climate (Köppen BWh).|$|E
5|$|For {{the past}} ten years, the International Crops Research Institute for the <b>Semi-Arid</b> Tropics (ICRISAT) has been {{assisting}} Zimbabwe's farmers to adopt conservation agriculture techniques, a sustainable method of farming that can help increase yields. By applying the three principles of minimum soil disturbance, legume-based cropping {{and the use of}} organic mulch, farmers can improve infiltration, reduce evaporation and soil erosion, and build up organic soil content.|$|E
5|$|Habitat types include polar, temperate, {{subtropical}} and tropical. The terrestrial {{vegetation type}} may be forest, steppe, grassland, <b>semi-arid</b> or desert. Fresh water habitats include marshes, streams, rivers, lakes, ponds and estuaries, and marine habitats include salt marshes, the coast, the intertidal zone, reefs, bays, the open sea, the sea bed, deep water and submarine vents.|$|E
5|$|People have {{struggled}} to live in deserts and the surrounding <b>semi-arid</b> lands for millennia. Nomads have moved their flocks and herds to wherever grazing is available and oases have provided opportunities for a more settled way of life. The cultivation of <b>semi-arid</b> regions encourages erosion of soil {{and is one of}} the causes of increased desertification. Desert farming is possible with the aid of irrigation and the Imperial Valley in California provides an example of how previously barren land can be made productive by the import of water from an outside source. Many trade routes have been forged across deserts, especially across the Sahara Desert, and traditionally were used by caravans of camels carrying salt, gold, ivory and other goods. Large numbers of slaves were also taken northwards across the Sahara. Some mineral extraction also takes place in deserts and the uninterrupted sunlight gives potential for the capture of large quantities of solar energy.|$|E
5|$|The Chaco {{region in}} the center-north has a {{subtropical}} climate with hot, humid summers and mild, dry winters. Under the Köppen climate classification, the west has a <b>semi-arid</b> climate (Bs) while the east has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa). Chaco {{is one of the}} few natural regions in the world located between tropical and temperate latitudes that is not a desert. Precipitation and temperature are relatively homogeneous throughout the region.|$|E
5|$|The area {{comprises}} <b>semi-arid</b> stony ridges, claypans and a stony plateau, {{and experiences}} a sub-tropical climate, {{with a wet}} season between January and March. The vegetation is mostly scrubland, including spinifex grasslands. The fauna is generally typical of Australian desert environments, and includes the red kangaroo, the eastern wallaroo, the northern nail-tail wallaby, and the spinifex hopping mouse.|$|E
5|$|The {{black mamba}} is {{primarily}} terrestrial, but occasionally arboreal, especially where {{it occurs in}} forest. Typically it inhabits neglected areas of scrub, termite mounds, abandoned burrows and rock crevices. It is adapted to terrain ranging from savannah and woodland to rocky slopes and dense forests. The black mamba prefers moderately dry environments such as light woodland and scrub, rocky outcrops, and <b>semi-arid</b> dry savannah, to dense forest or arid desert.|$|E
5|$|The genus Iridomyrmex inhabits rural, arid, and <b>semi-arid</b> areas. Nests {{are found}} in Acacia, Agathis, Banksia, Casuarina and Eucalyptus woodland, in pastures, Callitris forests, city parks, farmlands, grasslands, heath, sand dunes, savanna woodland, swamps, urban gardens, wet rain-forests, wet and dry sclerophyll woodland, and even in {{buildings}} such as hotels and houses.|$|E
5|$|The {{leaflets}} of {{the plant}} are obovate-oblong and equal-sided, and of a silky texture. The fruits (legumes) are typically one to two inches (2.5 to 5.1cm) long and contain six or seven brownish seeds. The species typically grows {{in areas where the}} soils are relatively deep, especially in <b>semi-arid</b> and wadi areas, and on terraces and slight inclines and hills.|$|E
5|$|The {{moisture}} classification includes climatic {{classes with}} descriptors such as hyperhumid, humid, subhumid, subarid, <b>semi-arid</b> (values of −20 to −40), and arid (values below −40). Humid regions experience more precipitation than evaporation each year, while arid regions experience greater evaporation than precipitation {{on an annual}} basis. A total of 33percent of the Earth's landmass is considered either arid or <b>semi-arid,</b> including southwest North America, southwest South America, most of northern and {{a small part of}} southern Africa, southwest and portions of eastern Asia, as well as much of Australia. Studies suggest that precipitation effectiveness (PE) within the Thornthwaite moisture index is overestimated in the summer and underestimated in the winter. This index can be effectively used to determine the number of herbivore and mammal species numbers within a given area. The index is also used in studies of climate change.|$|E
5|$|The {{region is}} <b>semi-arid,</b> and the {{vegetation}} is generally scrubland. Muckaty Station {{lies at the}} boundary of two bioregions, Tanami and Sturt Plateau. The Tanami bioregion is made up primarily of sandplains vegetated with bootlace oak (Hakea lorea), desert bloodwoods (Corymbia species), acacias and grevilleas, together with spinifex grasslands. The Sturt Plateau bioregion also includes spinifex grasslands, but with a canopy of bloodwood trees.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} found in the Brazilian <b>semi-arid</b> region in the National Park of Catimbau, in July 2007. It was {{described}} as new to science in a 2010 Mycotaxon publication by Felipe Wartchow of the Universidade Federal de Pernambuco. L.rupestris is one of 19 species of Lactarius known from Brazil. The epithet rupestris refers to the campos rupestres montane savanna—the ecoregion where the type species was collected.|$|E
5|$|The stone-curlews are a {{group of}} largely {{tropical}} waders in the family Burhinidae. They are found worldwide within the tropical zone, with some species also breeding in temperate Europe and Australia. They are medium to large waders with strong black or yellow-black bills, large yellow eyes and cryptic plumage. Despite being classed as waders, most species have a preference for arid or <b>semi-arid</b> habitats.|$|E
5|$|The vast size, {{and wide}} range of altitudes, {{contribute}} to Argentina's diverse climate. Argentina possesses {{a wide variety of}} climatic regions ranging from subtropical in the north to subantarctic in the far south. Lying between those is the Pampas region, which features a mild and humid climate. Consequently, there is a wide variety of biomes in the country, including subtropical rain forests, <b>semi-arid</b> and arid regions, temperate plains in the Pampas, and cold subantarctic in the south. However, despite the diversity of biomes, about two-thirds of Argentina is arid or <b>semi-arid.</b> In general, Argentina has four main climate types: warm, moderate, arid, and cold, all determined by the expanse across latitude, range in altitude, and relief features. Argentina is best divided into six distinct regions reflecting the climatic conditions of the country as a whole. From north to south, these regions are Northwest, Chaco, Northeast, Cuyo/Monte, Pampas, and Patagonia. Each climatic region has distinctive types of vegetation.|$|E

5|$|A {{study by}} {{researchers}} at the International Crops Research Institute for the <b>Semi-Arid</b> Tropics (ICRISAT) found that growing sweet sorghum instead of grain sorghum could increase farmers incomes by US$40 per hectare per crop because it can provide food, feed and fuel. With grain sorghum currently grown on over 11 million hectares (ha) in Asia and on 23.4 million ha in Africa, a switch to sweet sorghum could have a considerable economic impact.|$|E
5|$|Agaricus deserticola, {{commonly}} known as the gasteroid agaricus, is a species of fungus in the family Agaricaceae. Found only in southwestern and western North America, A.deserticola is adapted for growth in dry or <b>semi-arid</b> habitats. The fruit bodies are secotioid, meaning the spores are not forcibly discharged, and the cap does not fully expand. Unlike other Agaricus species, A.deserticola does not develop true gills, but rather a convoluted and networked system of spore-producing tissue called a gleba. When the partial veil breaks or pulls away from the stem or the cap splits radially, the blackish-brown gleba is exposed, which allows the spores to be dispersed.|$|E
5|$|At {{the base}} of the deposit, these {{sandstones}} are reddish brown, very micaceous and shaley, sometimes containing calcareous nodules, ferruginous concretions and vegetable wax; above, they are gray and quartziferous. This is the Aye formation, including spiriferida like Cyrtospirifer verneuili, Rhynchonellida as Rhynchonella pugnus and R. boloniensis, some Orthoceras, Orthis striatula or Atrypa reticularis Well-preserved feldspar and mica probably come from wind erosion under a <b>semi-arid</b> climate of mountains present in the Netherlands today and extending to Düsseldorf.|$|E
5|$|Denver {{lies within}} the <b>semi-arid,</b> {{continental}} climate zone (Köppen climate classification BSk). It has four distinct seasons and receives a modest {{amount of precipitation}} spread throughout the year. Due to its inland location on the High Plains, {{at the foot of}} the Rocky Mountains, Denver, like all cities along the eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains, is subject to sudden changes in weather. Contrary to the popular belief that Denver receives 300 days of sunshine a year, the city can actually expect to receive an average of 115 clear days, 130 partly cloudy days, and 120 cloudy days each year.|$|E
5|$|Horses {{and other}} members of the genus Equus are adapted by {{evolutionary}} biology to eating small amounts of the same kind of food all day long. In the wild, horses ate prairie grasses in <b>semi-arid</b> regions and traveled significant distances each day in order to obtain adequate nutrition. Therefore, their digestive system was made to work best with a small but steady flow of food that does not change much from day to day.|$|E
5|$|In Queensland, koalas are {{unevenly}} distributed and uncommon {{except in}} the southeast, where they are numerous. In New South Wales, they are abundant only in Pilliga, while in Victoria they are common nearly everywhere. In South Australia, koalas were extirpated by 1920 and subsequently reintroduced. Koalas {{can be found in}} habitats ranging from relatively open forests to woodlands, and in climates ranging from tropical to cool temperate. In <b>semi-arid</b> climates, they prefer riparian habitats, where nearby streams and creeks provide refuge during times of drought and extreme heat.|$|E
5|$|In its {{southern}} range Tyrannosaurus lived alongside the titanosaur Alamosaurus, the ceratopsians Torosaurus, Bravoceratops and Ojoceratops, hadrosaurs {{which consisted of}} a species of Edmontosaurus, Kritosaurus and a possible species of Gryposaurus, the nodosaur Glyptodontopelta, the oviraptorid Ojoraptosaurus, possible species of the theropods Troodon and Richardoestesia, and the pterosaur Quetzalcoatlus. The region {{is thought to have}} been dominated by <b>semi-arid</b> inland plains, following the probable retreat of the Western Interior Seaway as global sea levels fell.|$|E
5|$|It {{occurs in}} a wide variety of habitats, {{including}} riparian woodlands such as river red gum, bimble box and black box with an understory of lignum or saltbush; mallee woodland, especially where mixed with thickets of Broombush or Emu Bush; woodlands of Native Pine growing on sand ridges; and <b>semi-arid</b> scrubland dominated by Acacia including lancewood. On the coast The striped honeyeater is found in swamp forests of paperbark and Casuarina, and in developed areas containing native and exotic trees and shrubs such as caravan parks, reserves, gardens, and farms and orchards.|$|E

5|$|South Dakota has a humid {{continental}} climate {{in the east}} and in the Black Hills, and a <b>semi-arid</b> climate in the west outside of the Black Hills, featuring four very distinct seasons, and the ecology of the state features plant and animal species typical of a North American temperate grassland biome. A number of areas under the protection of the federal or state government, such as Badlands National Park, Wind Cave National Park, and Custer State Park, are located in the state.|$|E
5|$|South Dakota {{has several}} sites {{administered}} by the National Park Service. Two national parks have been established in South Dakota, both in the state's southwestern part. Wind Cave National Park, established in 1903 in the Black Hills, has an extensive cave network {{as well as a}} large herd of bison. Badlands National Park was created in 1978. The park features an eroded, brightly colored landscape surrounded by <b>semi-arid</b> grasslands. Mount Rushmore National Memorial in the Black Hills was established in 1925. The sculpture of four U.S. Presidents was carved into the mountainside by sculptor Gutzon Borglum.|$|E
5|$|The Cape sparrow or mossie (Passer melanurus) is a bird of the sparrow family Passeridae {{found in}} {{southern}} Africa. A medium-sized sparrow at , it has distinctive plumage, including large pale head stripes in both sexes. Its plumage is mostly coloured grey, brown, and chestnut, {{and the male}} has some bold black and white markings on its head and neck. The species inhabits <b>semi-arid</b> savannah, cultivated areas, and towns, and ranges from the central coast of Angola to eastern South Africa and Swaziland. Three subspecies are distinguished {{in different parts of}} its range.|$|E
5|$|The Patagonian {{climate is}} {{classified}} as arid to <b>semi-arid</b> and temperate to cool temperate. One defining characteristic are the strong winds from the west which blow year round (stronger in summer than in winter), which favors evaporation and {{is a factor in}} making the region mostly arid. There are three major factors that influence the climate of the region: the Andes, the South Pacific High and South Atlantic High, and an isolation that is more pronounced in eastern than western areas.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} of southeastern trade winds and northwestern monsoons produces a hot rainy season (November–April) with frequently destructive cyclones, and a relatively cooler dry season (May–October). Rain clouds originating over the Indian Ocean discharge {{much of their}} moisture over the island's eastern coast; the heavy precipitation supports the area's rain forest ecosystem. The central highlands are both drier and cooler while the west is drier still, and a <b>semi-arid</b> climate prevails in the southwest and southern interior of the island.|$|E
5|$|The cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) is {{an annual}} {{herbaceous}} legume from the genus Vigna. Due to its tolerance for sandy soil and low rainfall {{it is an}} important crop in the <b>semi-arid</b> regions across Africa and other countries. It requires very few inputs, as the plants root nodules are able to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it a valuable crop for resource poor farmers and well-suited to intercropping with other crops. The whole plant is used as forage for animals, with its use as cattle feed likely responsible for its name.|$|E
