2500|$|Modern {{high-voltage}} enthusiasts usually build Tesla coils {{similar to}} some of Tesla's [...] "later" [...] 2-coil air-core designs. These typically consist of a primary tank circuit, a series LC (inductance-capacitance) circuit composed of a high-voltage capacitor, spark gap and primary coil, and the secondary LC circuit, a <b>series-resonant</b> <b>circuit</b> consisting of the secondary coil plus a terminal capacitance or [...] "top load". In Tesla's more advanced (magnifier) design, a third coil is added. The secondary LC circuit is composed of a tightly coupled air-core transformer secondary coil driving {{the bottom of a}} separate third coil helical resonator. Modern 2-coil systems use a single secondary coil. The top of the secondary is then connected to a topload terminal, which forms one 'plate' of a capacitor, the other 'plate' being the earth (or [...] "ground"). The primary LC circuit is tuned so that it resonates at the same frequency as the secondary LC circuit. The primary and secondary coils are magnetically coupled, creating a dual-tuned resonant air-core transformer. Earlier oil-insulated Tesla coils needed large and long insulators at their high-voltage terminals to prevent discharge in air. Later Tesla coils spread their electric fields over larger distances to prevent high electrical stresses in the first place, thereby allowing operation in free air. Most modern Tesla coils also use toroid-shaped output terminals. These are often fabricated from spun metal or flexible aluminum ducting. The toroidal shape helps to control the high electrical field {{near the top of the}} secondary by directing sparks outward and away from the primary and secondary windings.|$|E
50|$|The quarter-wave {{elements}} imitate a series-resonant electrical element due to {{the standing}} wave present along the conductor. At the resonant frequency, the standing wave has a current peak and voltage node (minimum) at the feed. In electrical terms, this means the element has minimum reactance, generating the maximum current for minimum voltage. This is the ideal situation, because it produces the maximum output for the minimum input, producing the highest possible efficiency. Contrary to an ideal (lossless) <b>series-resonant</b> <b>circuit,</b> a finite resistance remains (corresponding to the relatively small voltage at the feed-point) {{due to the}} antenna's radiation resistance {{as well as any}} actual electrical losses.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a technique for simultaneous dual-band {{operation of a}} slot based frequency selective surface (FSS). The dual-band function is achieved by the inclusion of <b>series-resonant</b> tuned <b>circuits</b> positioned at each slot centre, therefore functioning as a passive frequency selective switch. A surface offering pass-bands in the WLAN bands of 2. 45 and 5 GHz is presented and its performance evaluated both by computer simulation, and also practical measurements of a prototype surface. Results indicate a significant level of stability is achieved for centre frequency while operational bandwidths decrease and insertion losses increase somewhat with incident angle. The lumped components used are identified {{as a source of}} insertion loss...|$|R
40|$|A 3 DFT gradient-echo {{technique}} {{has been developed}} which, in conjunction with <b>series-resonant</b> gradient-coil <b>circuits,</b> can produce three-dimensional NMR images with an echo time of less than 100 mu s. The method involves a read-gradient waveform composed of two sinusoids of different frequencies. This is an improvement on previous imaging sequences using a single sinusoid where only half of k space was sampled and where the second half was calculated using conjugate symmetry. The inaccuracies involved in the necessary ''cut and paste'' of k space inevitably lead to artifacts in the final image. The important features of the new method are that with suitable phase encoding all octants of k space are sampled, the RF pulse is applied when the gradients are all zero, and the echo forms when the gradient is essentially constant. This method will allow more extensive application of solid imaging techniques to biological samples in vivo...|$|R

The operating principle of utility is AC-low frequency to AC-high frequency and AC power frequency conversion circuit which is defined as high frequency cyclo inverter. This synthesized converter {{can be considered as}} a multi-output extension of a full-bridge topology where the AC to DC conversion is done by a bridge converter and again the required multi output AC is obtained with the help of <b>series-resonant</b> inverter <b>circuit.</b> It allows the control of outputs, simultaneously and independently, up to their rated power reducing the component requirement along with the multi converter solution. The additional advantage of such a circuit is that the AC side line current harmonic components and power factor characteristics are improved. This Circuit is simulated using MATLAB Simulink and the simulation results are shown. 1...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1986 A DC-to-DC power {{converter}} was designed {{on the basis}} of pulse-area modulation which is applied to a <b>series-resonant</b> <b>circuit</b> with internal frequency of 10 Khz The <b>series-resonant</b> <b>circuit</b> was placed directly in the energy path which provides a means for the thyristors to be naturally commutated. The design was tested by simulation of the converter with the ElectroMagnetic Transients Program (EMTP). It was found that the converter operates only with a unique reference signal (4. 0 Amps). Deviations from this signal failed to produce a DC waveform at the output terminal. This problem is resolved by including a PEAK CURRENT LIMITER to the controller...|$|E

40|$|Abstract-The series-resonant {{converter}} {{is one of}} {{the major}} classes of electronic power converters that are extensively ap-plied in dc-dc conversion. This technology transfers bulk en-ergy efficiently through a <b>series-resonant</b> <b>circuit</b> in the direct path of the energy transfer. This resonant converter forms a high-frequency ac link between the voltage sources connected to the input and output terminals. The high-frequency link is ex-ploited in the application of a modulation process, thus avoid-ing the use of bulky and expensive low-order harmonic filters. The achievable high-pulse repetition frequency is rooted in the efficient turn-off mechanism of the semiconductor switches and does not compromise their reliability. The classical objective of an ac-dc converter is to control the (average value of the) output waveform (often the output volt-age). The energy emanated from the source is adapted by pas...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} single power-conversion ac-dc {{converter}} with {{high power factor}} and high efficiency. The proposed converter is derived by integrating a full-bridge diode rectifier and a series-resonant active-clamp dc-dc converter. To obtain a high power factor without a power factor correction circuit, this paper proposes a novel control algorithm. The proposed converter provides single power-conversion by using the novel control algorithm for both power factor correction and output control. Also, the active-clamp circuit clamps the surge voltage of switches and recycles the energy stored in the leakage inductance of the transformer. Moreover, it provides zero-voltage turn-on switching of theswitches. Also, a <b>series-resonant</b> <b>circuit</b> of the output-voltage doublerremoves the reverse-recovery problem of the output diodes. The proposed converter provides maximum power factor 0. 995 and maximum efficiency of 95. 1 % at the full load. The operationprinciple of the converter is analyzed and verified. Experimentalresults for a 400 W ac-dc converter at a constant switching frequencyof 50 kHz are obtained to show the performance of theproposed converter...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The present paper {{considers}} {{the connection between}} complex input impedance and the physical dimensions for planar ultra wideband (UWB) antennas. The first time the effect of both the actual radiator width and length for impedance behaviour is comprehensively presented. Also the effect of feed point dimensions on complex impedance is studied. The investigations involve both UWB single-resonant dipoles to cover bandwidth ≥ 500 MHz and a multi-resonant dipole for the entire Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) frequency band of 3. 1 – 10. 6 GHz. Lumped-element equivalent circuits are used identically with 3 D antenna simulations in order to observe the corresponding impedance behaviour with the studied antennas. The used equivalent circuits consisting of series-and parallel-resonant stages are widely accepted in the open literature. The <b>series-resonant</b> <b>circuit</b> of equivalent is observed to have the analogue to the antenna feeding area. The physical dipole dimensions {{in terms of a}} length and width are connected to parallel-resonant part, which mainly determines the antenna input impedance. The resistance of a parallel-resonant stage behaves as the maximum value of real part of dipole impedance with an influence on bandwidth together with the ratio of parallel capacitance C and inductance L. The increase of the antenna physical width has an effect on bandwidth, because of the wider the antenna, the higher the capacitance in the antenna feed. Since the traditional dipoles are used for these studies, the results can be extended in several ways for other antenna types or, for instance, to verify the effect of body tissue, close to a wearable antenna. 1...|$|E
