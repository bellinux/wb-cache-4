5|$|Alien <b>Soldier</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} in 1995 on a physical cartridge format in Australia, Europe and Japan. In North America, {{the game was}} delivered exclusively through the Sega Channel cable service. Released late in the Mega Drive's lifecycle and {{after the release of}} the Sega Saturn, Alien Soldier pushed the system to its technical limits. Suganami wished he continued working on it after release, believing he could have improved on the story and graphics. Years later, Yosuke Okunari of Treasure addressed concerns that Alien <b>Soldier</b> <b>was</b> released as an incomplete game, stating that the notion is only derived from Suganami having originally had large ambitions that were never realized.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, Domitian {{appears to}} have been very popular among the soldiers, {{spending}} an estimated three years of his reign among the army on campaigns—more than any emperor since Augustus—and raising their pay by one-third. While the army command may have disapproved of his tactical and strategic decisions, the loyalty of the common <b>soldier</b> <b>was</b> unquestioned.|$|E

5|$|The basic {{equipment}} of a 4th-century foot <b>soldier</b> <b>was</b> {{essentially the same}} as in the 2nd century: metal armour cuirass, metal helmet, shield and sword. Some evolution took place during the 3rd century. Trends included the adoption of warmer clothing; the disappearance of distinctive legionary armour and weapons; the adoption by the infantry of equipment used by the cavalry in the earlier period; and the greater use of heavily armoured cavalry called cataphracts.|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} {{action of the}} {{campaign}} took place on June 9 between cavalry forces at Brandy Station, near Culpeper, Virginia. The 9,500 Confederate cavalrymen under Stuart were surprised by Maj. Gen. Alfred Pleasonton's combined arms force of two cavalry divisions (8,000 troopers) and 3,000 infantry, but Stuart eventually repulsed the Union attack. The inconclusive battle, the largest predominantly cavalry engagement of the war, proved {{for the first time}} that the Union horse <b>soldier</b> <b>was</b> equal to his Southern counterpart.|$|E

5|$|A major {{influence}} in The Winter <b>Soldier</b> <b>was</b> conspiracy fiction from the 1970s such as Three Days of the Condor, with the script also drawing from the Winter Soldier story arc written by Ed Brubaker. The script {{was written in}} 2011, with the Russo brothers entering negotiations to direct in June 2012 and casting beginning the following month. Principal photography commenced in April 2013 in Los Angeles, California before moving to Washington, D.C. and Cleveland, Ohio. While the directors aimed for more realism, with focus on practical effects and intense stunt work, 2,500 visual effects shots were done by six different companies.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the cavalry}} had been {{successful}} in protecting the park, by 1914 the average <b>soldier</b> <b>was</b> not cutout for the strenuous, diplomatic and tedious nature of the work, and {{the high level of}} training related to cavalry skills. World War I added further impetus to a transition back to civilian management, to relieve the army of a duty that could be performed by civilian rangers. In July 1914, the 1st Cavalry was withdrawn from Yellowstone and replaced with a composite unit of 200 cavalrymen from throughout the army, many of whom had served in Yellowstone previously.|$|E

Austin, later released all of the men, {{on the condition that}} they leave Texas and vow to stop fighting Texas residents. One wounded Mexican <b>soldier</b> <b>was</b> allowed to remain in Goliad, as was Captain Manuel Sabriego, who was married to a local woman. In secret, Sabriego began organizing a group of settlers in the Goliad area who sympathized with Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Palestinian Arab irregulars led by Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni and {{his local}} commander, Abd al-Halim Jawlani, battled British Army forces in Bani Na'im in December 1938. According to British {{military}} accounts, {{a resident of}} Bani Na'im called for intervention when the rebels entered the town. Israeli scholar Hillel Cohen wrote that Fakhri Nashashibi, a political rival of al-Husayni, informed military authorities on three rebel units forcing Bani Na'im's largely pro-Nashashibi inhabitants to join the revolt. The British promptly confronted a force of 100 irregulars. With British Air Force assistance, al-Husayni's troops dispersed and fled east of Bani Na'im where they were pinned down. British forces killed 60 rebels and captured 15. One British <b>soldier</b> <b>was</b> killed.|$|E
