40|$|Abstract-In {{this paper}} we apply a {{recently}} formulated gen-eral timing model of synchronous operation {{to the special}} case of latch-controlled pipelined circuits. The model accounts for multiphase synchronous clocking, correctly captures the be-havior of level-sensitive latches, handles both short- and long-path delays, accommodates wave pipelining, and leads to a comprehensive set of timing constraints. Pipeline circuits are important because of their frequent use in computer systems. We define their concurrency {{as a function of}} the clock schedule and degree of wave pipelining. We then identify a special class of clock schedules, coincident multiphase clocks, which provide a lower bound on the value of the optimum cycle time. We show that the region of feasible solutions for <b>single-phase</b> <b>clocking</b> can be nonconvex or even disjoint, and derive a closed-form expression for the minimum cycle time of a restricted but prac-tical form of <b>single-phase</b> <b>clocking.</b> We compare these forms of clocking on three pipeline examples and highlight some of the issues in pipeline synchronization.

In order to make the clock rate higher, at least two factors should be taken into account in clock-net routing. First, since the clock skew affects the clock period directly, exact zero skew is desired. Next, the delay time should be minimized in a clock net.

40|$|Aggressive design using level-sensitive latches {{and wave}} {{pipelining}} {{has been proposed}} to meet the increasing need for higher performance digital systems. The optimal clocking problem for such designs has been formulated using an accurate timing model. However, this problem {{has been difficult to}} solve because of its nonconvex solution space. The best algorithms to date employ linear programs to solve an overconstrained case that has a convex solution space, yielding suboptimal solutions to the general problem. A new efficient (cubic complexity) algorithm, Gpipe, exploits the geometric characteristics of the full nonconvex solution space to determine the maximum <b>single-phase</b> <b>clocking</b> rate for a closed pipeline with a specified degree of wave pipelining. Introducing or increasing wave pipelining by permanently enabling some latches is also investigated. Sufficient conditions have been found to identify which latches can be removed in this fashion so as to guarantee no decrease and permit a possible increase in the clock rate. Although increasing the degree of wave pipelining can result in faster clocking, wave pipelining is often avoided in design due to difficulties in stopping and restarting the pipeline under stall conditions without losing data, or in reduced rate testing of the circuit. To solve this problem, which has not previously been addressed, we present conditions and implementation methods that insure the stoppability and restartability of a wave pipeline...|$|E

The pipeline model uses level-sensitive latches as synchronizers and can allow wave pipelining. Gpipe is also used to explore the effect of removing nonsynchronizing and/or synchronizing latches on the maximum clock speed of the pipeline. A simple test shows which latches, if any, to remove to guarantee no decrease and permit a possible increase in the clock rate. 1 Pipeline and Clocking Model The pipeline and clocking model used in this program is based on the model described in [1]. The pipeline is modeled as a single closed loop with N stages separated by N synchronizers, which are chosen to be latches in this paper. Latches are harder to model, but impose less clocking overhead than flipflops[1]. Stages and the following latches are numbered consecutively from 0 to N Γ 1 and are characterized by the following parameters: Si and Hi: non-negative setup and hold time of latch i relative to the latching edge of clock Tc.

Consequently, they typically use multiple clock generators and can exhibit increased energy consumption on their clock distribution networks. Moreover, they are not attractive for high-speed design due to their high complexity and clock skew management problems. In this paper, we present TSEL, the first energy-recovering (a. k. a. adiabatic) logic family that operates with a single-phase sinusoidal clocking scheme. We also present SCAL, a source-coupled variant of TSEL with improved supply voltage scalability and energy efficiency. Optimal performance under any operating conditions is achieved in SCAL using a tunable current source in each gate. TSEL and SCAL outperform previous adiabatic logic families in terms of energy efficiency and operating speed. In layout-based simulations with 0. 5   m standard CMOS process parameters, 8 -bit carry-lookahead adders (CLAs) in TSEL and SCAL function correctly for operating frequencies exceeding 200 MHz. In comparison with corresponding CLAs in alternative logic styles that operate at minimum supply voltages, CLAs designed in our single-phase adiabatic logic families are relatively more energy efficient across {{a broad range of}} operating frequencies. Specifically, for clock rates ranging from 10 MHz to 200 MHz, our 8 -bit SCAL CLAs are 1. 5 to 2. 5 times more energy efficient than corresponding adders developed in PAL and 2 N 2 P and 2. 0 to 5. 0 times less dissipative than their purely combinational or pipelined CMOS counterparts.
