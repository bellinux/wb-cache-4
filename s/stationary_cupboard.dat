50|$|Ted {{was born}} in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex and {{attended}} Eastwood High School for Boys where {{he set up a}} small radio station in a <b>stationary</b> <b>cupboard</b> with the now BBC Radio 2 Steve Wright (DJ). The station was heard at lunchtimes over the schools PA system. After turning down the opportunity to become an assistant golf professional for a love of music, he left school at the age of 17 and joined Mother Mistro Music Publishers in London where he worked as a song plugger, securing airplay on artist releases. Following a short spell at Campbell Connelly publishers, he joined Carlin Music in 1973 (where he was known as Eddie Elliott), and achieved airplay and promotional success for many hit records including titles by Elvis Presley, The Three Degrees, Electric Light Orchestra and George Benson. His biggest success for Carlin came when he switched the B side of a Stylistics record to become the A side. Following massive airplay,‘You Make Me Feel Brand New’ reached number two in the UK singles chart in July 1974. In 1977 he was invited to join a new music division at Chappells Music Publishers and promoted the soundtracks of Saturday Night Fever and Grease, securing airplay, TV promotion and artist interviews.|$|E
5000|$|Miss Davina Bat (Una Stubbs) - Miss Bat is the {{slightly}} loopy Chanting teacher at Cackle's Academy during Series 1 and 2. She {{lives in the}} <b>stationary</b> <b>cupboard</b> in the staff room and has a habit of eating bizarre food, including flowers, fungus, sour milk and cat food. Miss Bat is also not the most reliable person in a crisis, as proved in the episode [...] "Alarms and Diversions" [...] when the emergency alarm reduces her to hysterics. In the episode [...] "Old Hats and New Brooms", Miss Bat surprises everyone by returning from Inner Mongolia (she usually spends the summer holiday in the staff-room cupboard). Miss Bat hates Miss Hardbroom and often argues with Miss Drill. When Miss Gimlet, the Second Year class tutor, left {{at the start of}} the new term, Miss Bat fought with Miss Drill over which of them should replace her. Miss Cackle eventually decided to let them share the position, but later put Miss Bat in charge of the First Year for half of the term. Miss Bat left Cackle's for unknown reasons at the end of Series 2 and was replaced by Miss Crotchet. (Miss Bat doesn't appear in The New Worst Witch).|$|E
50|$|William Seaton (Ian Ogilvy) is {{a writer}} who {{purchases}} an ancient ornate door from the Proprietor. He is unable to meet the Proprietor's asking price, but agrees a reduced price with him. When the Proprietor goes {{to the back of}} the shop to note Seaton's details, he leaves the till open. After Seaton leaves, the Proprietor starts counting the money in the till.Seaton's wife, Rosemary (Lesley-Anne Down) thinks the door is too grand to lead to a stationery cupboard, but when she touches it seems to be able to see what originally lay behind it. The Door begins to exert a strange fascination over Seaton, and he finds that when he opens it a mysterious blue room lies beyond. There, he finds the notes of Sir Michael Sinclair (Jack Watson), an evil occultist who created the door as a means to trap those who entered through it, so that Sinclair can take their souls and live forever.Seaton escapes, but when he tries to leave his house he finds that the door's influence has spread, and he and Rosemary are trapped. In a trance, Rosemary is unable to stop herself from opening to the door and entering the room, where she is incapacitated by Sinclair. Sinclair carries her through the doorway, mocking Seaton by asking him to follow, as two souls are better than one.Seaton starts to smash the door with an axe, and the room and Sinclair start to crumble. Seaton tries to rescue Rosemary, but is attacked by Sinclair. Seaton has Rosemary continue axing the door, and manages to break free. They continue demolishing the door, destroying the room and turning Sinclair to a skeleton and then dust when they break the door from its hinges. The door is gone, and the two hug warmly in front of what is now just a <b>stationary</b> <b>cupboard.</b> Back at the shop, the Proprietor finishes counting and finds all the money present and correct, hence the 'good' conclusion to the tale.|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{presentation}} is an application of Pearce and Cronin‟s (1980 a) Theory of Co-ordinated Management of Meaning to a user-led, user- run, mental health, peer advocacy service. An episode of communication is analysed. This suggests the usefulness of considering a „three levelled ‟ „charmed loop ‟ (Pearce and Pearce 2000 b: 13) of „reciprocal relationships ‟ between interpersonal relationships, life scripts and agency ethos. The agency ethos of mutualism is connected {{with the creation of}} a positive identity and the creation of comparatively egalitarian relationships. This charmed loop contrasts to the strange loop that is often found in professionally led mental health services. PAPER The focus of the paper is a locked stampbox that is kept in a dull grey metal <b>stationary</b> <b>cupboard</b> in what has been tactfully described as a small and rather „well-used ‟ (Action for Advocacy 2010) registered charity office, in a Northern, inner-city, low-income estate. The charity‟s main project is a peer advocacy service. The stamp box contains large and regular size First and Second Class stamps of approximately £ 60 in value, at any one time, and a small handwritten recording book. There are three main uses of the postage stamps in the box: first, letters can be sent by the Peer Advocates (PAs) representing the views of clients to other agencies; secondly, letters can be sent by th...|$|E
