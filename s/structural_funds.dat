The European Regional Development Fund's Objective One <b>structural</b> <b>funds</b> provided £7.5million through the Welsh European Funding Office, Corus Steelworks Regeneration Fund £7million and the Welsh Assembly Government provided the balance. By January2010, the total project cost, including the line extension to Ebbw Vale Town, had risen to an estimated £32.6million.|$|E
5|$|To {{stimulate the}} Northern economy, the {{government}} has organised a series of programmes to invest in and develop the region, of which the latest as of 2017 is the Northern Powerhouse. The North {{has also been a}} significant recipient of European Union <b>Structural</b> <b>Funds.</b> Between 2007 and 2013, EU funds created around 70,000 jobs in the region, and the majority of Northern Powerhouse funding comes from the European Regional Development Fund and the European Investment Bank. The loss of these funds following Brexit, combined with potential reductions in exports to the EU, has been identified as a threat to Northern growth.|$|E

40|$|This paper assesses {{and compares}} the {{experiences}} of 12 Objective 1 and 2 regions across the EU which conducted pilot projects on methods of promoting sustainable development by means of <b>Structural</b> <b>Fund</b> programmes. It demonstrates how the regions translated the concept of sustainable development into practical applications that are compatible with <b>structural</b> <b>funding</b> procedures, relevant {{to the needs of}} specific programme areas and acceptable to programme partnerships. The paper analyses their experiences in terms of developing new methodologies, redesigning programme objectives, adapting management tools and opening up procedures to greater participation and dialogue. A central argument is that the success of the efforts to promote sustainable development via <b>structural</b> <b>funding</b> depends to a considerable extent on the ability of those involved to address local or regional issues of concern, to build on existing procedures and objectives of programme management and to respect the institutional framework of operation.

25|$|The {{economy is}} € 25billion (2001 GDP figures). The islands {{experienced}} continuous growth during a 20-year period, up until 2001, {{at a rate}} of approximately 5% annually. This growth was fueled mainly by huge amounts of Foreign Direct Investment, mostly to develop tourism real estate (hotels and apartments), and European Funds (near €11billion euro in the period from 2000 to 2007), since the Canary Islands are labelled Region Objective 1 (eligible for euro <b>structural</b> <b>funds).</b> Additionally, the EU allows the Canary Islands Government to offer special tax concessions for investors who incorporate under the Zona Especial Canaria (ZEC) regime and create more than 5 jobs.|$|E
25|$|Therefore, in 1993, the {{government}} introduced {{a policy to}} actively promote multi-municipal companies through Decree-law 379/93. The main vehicle to advance the reform process was the public Holding Company Águas de Portugal created in the same year, {{which was to be}} the majority owner of the newly created multi-municipal companies alongside with the participating municipalities. The government provided preferential access to EU <b>structural</b> <b>funds</b> to those municipalities that {{agreed to participate in the}} new multi-municipal companies, which were gradually created beginning in 1995. There was a strong continuity of sector policies, despite a change in government from the Social Democratic Party to the Socialist Party of Primer Minister António Guterres after the elections of 1995.|$|E
25|$|Since {{joining the}} EU in 1973, Ireland has {{received}} over €17 billion in EU Structural and Cohesion Funds. These {{are made up}} of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF) and were used to increase investment in the education system and to build physical infrastructure. These transfer payments from members of the European Union, such as Germany and France, were as high as 4% of Ireland's gross national product (GNP). Ireland is unique among cohesion countries, having allocated up to 35% of its <b>Structural</b> <b>Funds</b> to human resource investments, compared with an average of around 25% for other cohesion fund recipients. The Irish economy's increased productive capacity is sometimes attributed to these investments, which made Ireland more attractive to high-tech businesses, though the libertarian Cato Institute has suggested that the EU transfer payments were economically inefficient and may have actually slowed growth. The conservative Heritage Foundation also attributed to transfer payments no significant role in causing growth.|$|E
40|$|This paper evaluates {{whether the}} {{learning}} mechanisms of the European Cohesion policy {{have contributed to}} improve {{the economic impact of}} <b>Structural</b> <b>Fund</b> expenditure over time. It analyses whether the evolution of the policy in response to greater internal monitoring and external scrutiny has resulted in a more efficient and better targeted Cohesion policy. This is tested using an econometric model which evaluates the effect of <b>Structural</b> <b>Fund</b> expenditure on the growth of regional GDP per capita —conditional on factor endowments, institutional quality and initial conditions— during the last programming periods for which full sets of data are available (1994 - 1999 and 2000 - 2006). The results of the analysis unveil an increase in the effectiveness of the policy in successive periods. This positive association is robust to controlling for the level of development of the country and the relative economic position of a region within a country. The results also show that, when structural factors are taken into consideration, <b>Structural</b> <b>Fund</b> investment tends to yield higher returns in better-off countries and wealthier regions within countrie...|$|R

25|$|Felipe González's {{second term}} as Prime Minister was {{characterized}} by economic growth, with public investments favoured by the <b>Structural</b> <b>Funds</b> coming from the European Economic Community to which Spain had recently accessed. The GDP grew by around or above 5% between 1987 and 1989 and unemployment decreased from 20.6% to 16.9%. This period also saw the consolidation of the welfare system reforms initiated during González's first term, allowed through a better financing derived from a relatively progressive tax system. However, the economic expansion fostered by the government's liberal policies also brought about an increase in wealth differences and of inequality, leading to social unrest {{and a loss of}} popularity for the ruling PSOE which was made apparent in the 1987 local, regional and European Parliament elections. By the end of 1988, the two major trade unions in Spain, CCOO and UGT, had called a general strike which succeeded in paralyzing the country and in forcing the González's government to negotiate a partial withdrawal of its economic policies.|$|E
