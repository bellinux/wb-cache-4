5000|$|Price transparency: Let's {{examine a}} scenario. An ad network {{packages}} display inventory to an agency at say $10 CPM (cost per mille - or cost per thousand impressions).

The real eCPM (effective CPM) of the campaign for the ad network is around $2.50, and is far from the agency’s claim of premium inventory. The marketer is however appeased with <b>screen</b> <b>grabs</b> of his ads appearing in premium positions, oblivious of the masquerade while the ad network walks away with a big margin.|$|R
60|$|This book {{turned up}} in the Early Canadiana Online {{collection}} of early books about Canada, and the scans of the pages to be found on the Canadiana website were acquired using the very new (2005) <b>screen</b> <b>grabbing</b> tool created by ABBYY. Canadiana publish their scans at five different scales, of which we used the middle one, except for the Appendix, where we used the largest size, and OCRed it in the usual manner. The reason for this was that the font size used by Nelsons for the Appendix was much smaller than that used for the bodytext of the book. The rest of the work was done using our Athelstane editing programs, just as we do all other books. So doing it was something of a technical feat.|$|R

There were also five <b>screen</b> <b>grabs</b> from games, which were altered and skewered, from which you had to answer, or guess, what game the shot was from. Mainly because of Bull Durham's first name, Mega used this character to bust PR bluffs and blunders in the Mega Drive marketing world, with hilarious consequences.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} clowning in practice-as-research, and explores tensions between aspiration and execution in interdisciplinary projects. It draws on documentary assets (video <b>screen</b> <b>grabs,</b> photographs, texts) from a version of Euripides’ Iphigenia at Aulis devised online and presented at The Light in Leeds as Ugly Scenes (Performance Studies international, Psi# 18). It is also an experiment in writing ‘for’ and ‘as’ idiots, bringing together four interlocuting voices: those of two academics ‘in conversation with’ their antagonists and clown-esque alter egos, Kurt Zarniko and Teddy Love. The performance involved collaboration between academics and artists in the UK, USA, and Greece {{in the form of}} online auditioning, online devising, and collaborative writing. Formed into an international company, the group used open-source software (Google Docs, Skype, and Snagit) as platforms that offer productive arenas for live performance and improvisation. These platforms have an inherent potential for technological calamity (which is understood as fruitful in clown and comic modes). The actual staging of this work by this international but amateur outfit presented numerous obstacles, comical ‘failures’ and shortcomings, and there remains a wealth of material that offers a rich resource for a visually striking critical reflection...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an architecture that affords mobile users greater trust and security when browsing the internet (e. g., when making personal/financial transactions) from public terminals at Internet Cafes or other unfamiliar locations. This {{is achieved by}} enabling web applications to split their client-side pages across a pair of browsers: one untrusted browser running on a public PC and one trusted browser running on the user's personal mobile device, composed into a single logical interface through a local connection, wired or wireless. Information entered via the personal device's keypad cannot be read by the PC, thwarting PC-based key-loggers. Similarly, information displayed on the personal device's screen is also hidden from the PC, preserving the confidentiality and integrity of security-critical data even {{in the presence of}} <b>screen</b> <b>grabbing</b> attacks and compromised PC browsers. We present a security policy model for split-trust web applications that defends against a range of crimeware-based attacks, including those based on active-injection (e. g. inserting malicious packets into the network or spoofing user-input events). Performance results of a prototype split-trust implementation are presented, using a commercially available cell phone as a trusted personal device...|$|R

40|$|Numerous {{videogames}} {{offer their}} players {{opportunities for the}} production and collection of images displayed and understood as photographs. For some the production of photograph-like images {{is central to the}} gameplay, for others it is an add-on activity, an option for the completist or aesthetically minded. Some games do not offer a photographic feature yet something in the quality of their graphics, virtual landscapes or virtual camera stimulates in their players the desire for image capture through <b>screen</b> <b>grabs.</b> But {{what is the nature of}} this simulation of photography? Is it merely a metaphor, or perhaps a remediation, offering a familiar frame to activities and processes that are quite different to photography? This essay will argue that neither the gothic rhetoric of media death / afterlife that attends new media, nor an unqualified application of the notion of remediation, are adequate for understanding the persistence and mutation of photographic media and aesthetics in the post-digital era. For other facets of photography, at least of photography as an everyday practice and experience, persist in videogames. The image that glows only with the electrons of the cathode ray tube or liquid crystal of the flat screen may still capture a moment, a frozen instant in the unfolding of a dynamic, kinetic environment. The virtual camera organizes the flux of digital data in time and as space, from as fixed a viewpoint as that established by the photographic lens and the camera obscura before it. Though videogame worlds will be the focus, the essay makes suggestions for the theorisation and study of media technological change more generally...|$|R
40|$|This artists' book is {{composed}} of three volumes, each taking a separate Gersht film work as its subject; Evaders, Will You Dance For Me and Offering. All three film works disguise dark and complex themes beneath seductive or hypnotic imagery. Will You Dance For Me depicts an 85 -year-old dancer swaying {{back and forth in}} a rocking chair, slowly recounting her experiences as a young woman in Auschwitz. Evaders explores Walter Bernjamin's ill fated escape from Nazi occupied France along the mountainous Lister Route. Offering presents a contemporary matador preparing for a bullfight and an expectant audience. These small and intimate books reflect on the creative thought process behind the making of each film. Together they create a seamless visual narrative and an insight into the mind of the artist. Each volume combines sources that have influenced Gersht including film stills, <b>screen</b> <b>grabs,</b> music videos and art historical paintings. From page to page they combine with Gersht’s own drawings, sketches, photographs and works from his wider portfolio that he considers relevant to these final film works. All of the images, original, found and sourced are treated equally and have been edited into sequences by the artist. The relationships between the images are not intended to be didactic but attempt to create a new experience from Gersht’s ideas and to contextualize his working process. Robert Rowland Smith, has written the accompanying softback text Gersht's Ghosts. The essay explores the themes of all three works and makes connections between the sourced, found and comparative images...|$|R
