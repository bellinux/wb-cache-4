50|$|Chung's joining of Grand National Party is {{an irony}} because his {{withdrawal}} from the presidential race in 2002 supporting Roh Moo-hyun was responsible for Grand National Party's failure in winning the presidential election.

40|$|Old English {{exhibits}} asymmetry in {{the subject}} position in the matrix topic-initial context : a full nominal subject typically follows the finite verb, resulting in the verb-second order, whereas a pronominal subject typically precedes it, resulting in the verb-third order. Old English also allows the pronominal object {{to appear in the}} so-called Wackernagel position in the <b>subordinate</b> context. These <b>facts</b> have led Kemenade (1987) to conclude that Old English pronouns are clitics requiring a host. According to the previous studies and the survey conducted in this paper, the clitic nature of pronouns carried over to Early Middle English and eventually got lost in Late Middle English. Under the recent minimalist conceptions advocated by Chomsky (2000, 2001 a, 2001 b) and the idea that language change is a reflex of the change in the process of parameter setting, it is claimed that obviation of the subject position asymmetry caused the loss of the clitic nature of pronouns, hence the loss of the Wackernagel pronominal object. It is also shown that the subject position asymmetry was obviated by the rise of either the systematic verb-third order or the systematic verb-second order in the matrix topic-initial context...|$|R

However, before going further into the role of literacy in facilitating individual self-expression, it is necessary to explore further the relationship between difference and inequality. For it is against this backdrop that the former acquires a particular significance and relevance. ...|$|R

Yet these two countries had the most extreme experience of housing bubbles during the 200 os, and both suffered a similar construction-related economic collapse that ruined their respective banking systems after 2008. The paper argues that the decision-making taking place within their very different domestic institutional frameworks was <b>subordinated</b> to the <b>fact</b> that they shared a similar form of international vulnerability. Both were extremely open to mobile international capital during the 2000 s. Their vulnerability to financialization resulted in a common experience of very rapid asset price inflation, which left both countries particularly exposed when the international financial collapse took place.

To look at these buildings today in terms of their affective material productivity, even if they can only be articulated incompletely, is to ask historians to undertake the kind of visual work that they are seldom accustomed to. It means staying the customary hastiness that sees architecture as mere instantiation of idea, and instead – while resisting the temptation to interpret architecture as merely the sum of its parts [...] requires a willingness to inquire into the materiality of aspects of architecture and objects which yield ‘nothing’ to see (such as dark areas within sculpture, non-figurative passages within architecture, the shine of silver, illegible letters of unknowable alphabets). Simultaneously we need also to widen our usual scope of vision to restore to architecture its affective elements that make it work. This is to require the mobility of architecture’s affect to engage us fully and temporally, rather than to dissect architecture into a “document”of a “social,” “political,” “cultural,” or “material” history, supposedly capable of embracing it fully, but to which it is, in <b>fact,</b> <b>subordinated...</b>|$|R
40|$|Dissertation (Ed. D., Educational Leadership) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2011. Leveraging {{behavior}} theory, {{coupled with}} a self-other-rater data collection process, this non-randomized quantitative study explored how differences in supervisor-subordinate upward influence behavior agreement and non-agreement affected supervisor ratings of subordinate effectiveness. Targets {{of the study were}} public college and university vice presidents (supervisors) and their direct reporting middle managers (subordinates). Eighty-one supervisor-subordinate dyads, or 162 individuals, participated in the study. Gathering data from study participants required the use of supervisor and subordinate influence behavior questionnaires (see Yukl, Seifert, & Chavez, 2008). In responding to questions presented in the questionnaires, subordinates provided ???self??? and supervisors provided ???other??? ratings on subordinate use of the eleven proactive influence behaviors considered. Previous research has demonstrated that subordinates who lacked an ability to successfully actualize upward influence behaviors diminished their likelihood of obtaining needed resources from supervisors (e. g., Applegate, 1982; Barry & Watson, 1996; Douglas & Gardner, 2004; Ferris, Judge, Rowland, & Fitzgibbons, 1994; Lamude & Scudder, 1995). The inappropriate selection, timing, and use of various upward influence behaviors has also been shown to have a deleterious effect on subordinate job performance ratings (Giacalone, 1985; Schlenker, 1980). As conjectured by Floyd and Wooldridge (1997) and Schilt and Lock (1982), the skillful use of upward influence behaviors by subordinates may be an important factor in the overall success of supervisors and organizations, in addition to subordinates. As few studies have considered supervisor-subordinate influence behavior agreement/non-agreement and its relationship to supervisor ratings of subordinate effectiveness within public institutions of higher education, further investigation of upward influence behavior and leader effectiveness within the context of these organizations was determined appropriate. For three of the influence behaviors investigated (i. e., rational persuasion, inspirational appeals, and consultation), study results indentified in-agreement/good and under-estimator subordinates as receiving significantly higher effectiveness ratings than subordinates who were in-agreement/poor or who over-estimated their use of these three influence behaviors. Although the study definitively established a relationship between increased subordinate effectiveness ratings and in-agreement/good and under-estimators, the study???s design did not seek to determine whether supervisors and subordinates were actually aware of the perceptions each held with regard to subordinate use of upward influence behaviors. Only the researcher knew???by analysis of the data???the actual levels of congruency (i. e., agreement/non-agreement) that existed between supervisors and <b>subordinates.</b> The <b>fact</b> that supervisors provided higher effectiveness ratings for subordinates who under-estimated their use of rational persuasion, consultation, and inspirational appeals, suggests that supervisor perceptions of subordinate influence behavior may be more important than actual agreement (i. e., in-agreement/good or in-agreement/poor), as perceptions, rather than realities, may significantly persuade supervisor ratings of subordinate effectiveness.

40|$|The {{results of}} several recent {{epidemiological}} surveys, shows that male sexual dysfunctions (e. g. erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation) are extremely {{prevalent in the}} general population. These sexual disorders are strongly associated with aging and are influenced {{by a variety of}} medical, psychiatric, life style factors and have a significant relationship with mood, state and interpersonal functioning and overall quality of life. An emerging point of view in the last two decade shows that a combination of psychological (e. g. temperamental and personality trait), physiological (e. g. endocrine data) and ecological (e. g. social status) variables seem to be the most relevant factors to explain the develop of this difficulties. Recent epidemiological paper point out the relationships between depression, low dominance score and erectile dysfunctions. In this context, the rank theory of depression (known also as defeat theory or resource loss theory) suggests that depression is highly correlated with perceptions of low rank and <b>subordinate</b> status.

However, being exposed to social stress does not necessarily predict subsequent pathological consequences, in fact social factors (i. e. dominance and submission) are a key factor in individual disease susceptibility.

40|$|A tradição de estudos hegelianos assumiu nos últimos decênios uma grande importância, tanto em referência a ampliação numérica dos trabalhos dedicados ao hegelianismo como em relação ao {{modus operandi}} de tematização e explicitação dos problemas e reflexões que lhe são oriundos. Dentro deste contexto de Renaissance da filosofia hegeliana, o problema do reconhecimento emerge como de importância capital na Hegel-Forschung. Todavia, a par deste novo interesse sobre o reconhecimento são raros os trabalhos que se propõem a enfrentar o tema reconhecimento desde a sua matiz lógica. O presente trabalho de pesquisa se propõe estabelecer a reconstrução da estrutura lógica do reconhecimento, exprimindo os seus níveis a partir da Wissenschaft der Logik. A presente tese de caráter hermenêutico bibliográfico se configura para a consecução de tal objetivo, dividindo internamente o trabalho em comento em 05 (cinco) capítulos. O primeiro capítulo se destina a situar o estado da arte nas pesquisas sobre o reconhecimento na filosofia contemporânea. O segundo capítulo constitui o primeiro nível do reconhecimento e apresenta a lógica operando como um denominador transitivo. O terceiro capítulo estabelece o segundo nível da estrutura lógica do reconhecimento e reconstitui as condições de interação subjetiva, a alteridade (Andersheit) como se explicitando por dois modos próprios: por referência (Beziehung) e por relação (Verhältnis). O quarto capítulo apresenta o terceiro estágio lógico do reconhecimento pela explicitação da subjetividade e os modos de relação da subjetividade a partir de seus metaníveis semântico-pragmáticos do: universal, {{particular}} e singular. Num segundo momento, o quarto capítulo expõe como a subjetividade se compreende enquanto dimensão teórica: como conhecer, e em sua dimensão prática como querer. Por fim, o quinto capítulo, expõe como os três metaníveis lógicos do reconhecimento, os quais seguem do conhecer (Kennen) ao reconhecer (Anerkennen), se fazem explicitar no processo histórico pelo recurso a Fenomenologia do Espírito em seu capítulo IV. O quinto capítulo objetiva ainda demonstrar que é possível reconstruir uma estrutura lógica sem subordinar os fatos à teoria. Espera-se por tanto, a título de conclusão, que mediante a explicitação e reconstrução lógica dos níveis da transitividade, da alteridade relacional, e da subjetividade enquanto unidade no sujeito entre o eu teórico e prático, se faça exprimir a estrutura lógica subjacente ao reconhecimento. During the last decades, {{the tradition of}} studies of Hegel has assumed great importance, as much referring {{to the amount of}} work dedicated to his philosophy as to the mode of operation of focusing and explaining the problems and reflections raised by him. In this context of the revival of Hegel’s philosophy, the problem of recognition emerges as of capital importance in the research about Hegel. However, {{in the context of this}} new interest about recognition, studies that go about pursuing the theme of recognition until its logical matrix are rare. The present study aims at establishing a reconstruction of the logical structure of recognition, expressing its levels starting from the Wissenschaft der Logik. The present theses of hermeneutic-bibliographic character is conceived to reach this aim, internally dividing the work in 05 (five) chapters. The first chapter aims at showing the state of research in the studies of recognition in contemporary philosophy. The second constitutes the first level of recognition and presents logic working as transitive denominator. The third chapter establishes the second level of the logical structure of recognition and reconstitutes the conditions of subjective interaction, the otherness (Andersheit) as being made explicit by two proper modes: by reference (Beziehung) and relationship (Verhältnis). The fourth chapter presents the third logical stage of recognition by making explicit the subjectivity and the mode of relationship of subjectivity starting from its semantic-pragmatic metalevels: the universal, the particular and the singular. In a second moment, the fourth chapter exposes how subjectivity is to be understood in its theoretic dimension as knowledge, and in its practical dimension as wish. Lastly, the fifth chapter shows how the three logical metalevels of recognition, which proceed from knowledge (Kennen) to recognition (Anerkennen), are made explicit in the historical process by the tool of the Phenomenology of Spirit in its fourth chapter. The fifth chapter also aims at showing that it is possible to reconstruct a logical structure without <b>subordinating</b> <b>fact</b> to theory. It is hoped, however, in terms of a conclusion, that in the face of a logical attempt at making explicit and reconstructing the levels of transitivity, of relational otherness and the subjectivity in terms of unity of subject between the theoretical and the practical I, the logical structure subjacent to recognition can be made to express itself. Die Tradierung von Studien über Hegel hat in den letzten Jahrzehnten sehr an Bedeutung gewonnen, und zwar sowohl was die zahlenmäβige Zunahme der Hegel gewidmeten Werke angeht, als auch im Hinblick auf den modus operandi der Theamtisierung und Präzisierung der Probleme und Reflexionen, die sich aus seinem Werk ergeben. In diesem Kontext der Renaissance der hegelschen Philosophie erscheint das Problem der Anerkennung als eines der wichtigsten der Hegelforschung. Freilich sind im Rahmen dieses neuen Interesses an der Anerkennung die Arbeiten selten, die darauf abzielen, das Thema Anerkennung von seiner logischen Wurzel her aufzugreifen. Die vorliegende Forschungsarbeit hat es sich zur Aufgabe gesetzt, die Rekonstruktion der logischen Struktur der Anerkennung herauszuarbeiten, wobei sie ihre Stufen anhand der Wissenschaft der Logik ausdrücken wird. Die vorliegende These von hermeneutisch-bibliografischem Charakter ist darauf angelegt, dieses Ziel zu erreichen, was sie in einer in 05 (funf) Kapitel aufgeteilten Struktur unternimmt. Die Aufgabe des ersten Kapitels ist es, den Forschungsstand über die Anerkennung in der zeitgenössischen Philosophie herauszuarbeiten. Das zweite Kapitel konstituiert die erste Schicht der Anerkennung und zeigt, wie die Logik als transitiver Nenner arbeitet. Das dritte Kapitel etabliert die zweite Schicht der logischen Struktur der Anerkennung und rekonstruiert die Konditionen der subjektiven Interaktion, die Andersheit als würde sie durch zwei ihr eigene Modi ausgedrückt: durch Beziehung und durch Verhältnis. Das vierte Kapitel stellt die dritte logische Schicht der Anerkennung vor durch die Präzisierung der Subjektivität und die Arten der Relation der Subjektivität, ausgehend von ihren semantisch-pragmatischen meta-Niveaus des Universellen, Partikulären und Singulären. In einer zweiten Argumentation stellt das viertel Kapitel dar, wie die Subjektivität in ihrer theoretischen Dimension als Wissen und in ihrer praktischen Dimension als Wollen zu verstehen ist. Das fünfte Kapitel schlieβlich stellt dar, wie die drei logischen Metaebenen der Erkenntnis, die sich aus dem Kennen und Anerkennen ergeben, im historischen Prozess erkennbar werden durch das Mittel der Phänomenologie des Geistes in seinem 4. Kapitel. Das fünfte Kapitel will auch zeigen, daβ es möglich ist, eine logische Struktur zu rekonstruieren, ohne die Fakten der Theorie zu unterwerfen. Wir erwarten deshalb als Schlussfolgerung, daβ angesichts der logischen Erklärung und Rekonstruktion der Schichten der Transitivität, des relationalen Andersseins und der Subjektivität in Bezug auf die Einheit des Subjekts zwischen dem theoretischen und praktischen Ich, die die Anerkennung betreffende logische Struktur sich zeigen wird...|$|R
