40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the water {{application}} efficiencies of sprinkler and furrow irrigation under conditions such that the best possible efficiencies for each method were obtained. A determination also was made of the uniformity of water distribution by sprinkler and furrow irrigation. Sprinkler and gravity irrigation were compared at the North Platte Agricultural Experiment Station of the University of Nebraska. The experimental plots were located in an area on the Northeast corner of the station, known as the Shelby land. The legal description of the area is the south 600 feet of the east ½ of the east ½ of the southeast ¼ of section 16, T 13 N, R 30 W. The soil on the experimental area was a Bridgeport very fine sandy loam. Eight plots, 56 by 500 feet, were used in the experiment. Four plots of Midland milo were irrigated with a portable sprinkler line and four with gated pipe into furrows. All plots except two were separated from the neighboring plots by 30 -foot strips of alfalfa An adequate water supply was available at the plot area. Water was taken from a pipeline which taps the penstock of the Platte Valley Public Power and Irrigation District power plant. A six-inch aluminum pipe line was used to take water from the field riser to the experimental plots. The line was laid along the south ends of the plots. A “T” in the main line near the plots being irrigated allowed water to be delivered to a <b>sprinkler</b> <b>lateral</b> to the gated pipe at the same time. Advisor: Paul E. Schleusene...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} the fourth in a series on {{friction}} factors for <b>sprinkler</b> <b>laterals.</b> The widely used friction correction factor F was developed by Christiansen for the hydraulic analysis of <b>sprinkler</b> <b>laterals.</b> A significant modification to this factor was the adjusted friction correction factor Fa. The adjusted friction correction factor can be used when the first sprinkler is {{a fraction of a}} full spacing from the lateral inlet. To design laterals with outlets and outflow at the downstream end, friction correction factor G was developed with the corresponding adjusted friction correction factor Ga. To calculate the average pressure head along a lateral, the average correction factors FAVG and GAVG were developed. These average correction factors can be used where friction correction factors F and G are used to analyze a lateral. This paper introduces two final adjusted average correction factors FaAVG and GaAVG, which can be used to determine the average pressure head in laterals analyzed using Fa or Ga. Use of these factors is demonstrated in an example...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the hydraulic and economic design of multi-diameter <b>sprinkler</b> irrigation <b>lateral</b> pipes with constant slope and similar, equally spaced sprinklers. The friction losses are estimated using the Darcy-Weisbach formula, {{taking into account}} the turbulent flow regions on the Moody diagram. Individual sprinklers are considered in estimating discharge and pressure along the lateral pipe. Other factors accounted for include: changes in velocity at sprinkler heads losses in sprinkler risers and pipe fittings and loss is due to the sudden contraction of pipes. A computer program is presented for the design of laterals having smaller downstream diameters such that hydraulic design criteria are met. This program provides economical designs for <b>sprinkler</b> irrigation <b>laterals.</b> Two numerical examples are presented in which some practical cases are analyze...|$|R
40|$|A {{computer}} model (SprinklerMod) {{was developed to}} simulate hydraulics of sprinkler irrigation systems. The objective {{of this paper is}} to describe mathematical background of this model for simulating pressures and discharges of <b>sprinklers</b> along the <b>laterals.</b> The model is capable of designing two types of laterals: <b>laterals</b> with fixed <b>sprinklers</b> and <b>laterals</b> with portable <b>sprinklers.</b> The model shows the simulation results in the forms of tables and graphs. Laterals with one or two diameters on uniform or non-uniform slopes can be designed. The model provides graphical presentation of percentage of sprinkler pressure variations for different lateral inside diameters. The Hazen- Williams equation was used for the calculation of friction losses. The required input parameters for lateral simulation are <b>lateral</b> type, desired <b>sprinkler</b> operating discharge and pressure head, spacing between sprinklers, distance of first <b>sprinkler</b> from <b>lateral</b> inlet, number of sprinklers operating on the lateral, riser height, Hazen- Williams pipe friction coefficient and lateral longitudinal slope or field elevations at each of the <b>sprinklers</b> on the <b>lateral.</b> Laterals are simulated such that average sprinkler pressures and discharges become equal to the values requested by the designer. Iterative procedures were implemented to simulate sprinkler pressures and discharges on laterals and the Newton- Raphson iterative method was used for calculating pressure of each of the <b>sprinklers</b> on the <b>laterals</b> with portable <b>sprinklers.</b> In order to evaluate the model, some example results of the model were compared with classical design results. Since there is no formula for the calculation of the required lateral inlet pressure in classical design of <b>laterals</b> with portable <b>sprinklers</b> in the scientific references, a new formula was developed. Averages of absolute percentage of variations of lateral inlet pressures for <b>laterals</b> with fixed <b>sprinklers</b> and with one or two-size diameters ranged from 0. 3 to 0. 7 percent, respectively. This value for laterals with portable sprinklers was 0. 1 percent. ...|$|R
40|$|Precise {{calculation}} of inlet pressure into <b>sprinkler</b> <b>laterals</b> {{is an important}} problem for proper distribution of uniformity. The adjusted average friction correction factor, FaAVG, provides the possibility of calculating the inlet pressure to mutli-outlet pressurized irrigation pipelines when the first outlet spacing from the pipe entrance is arbitrary. To investigate the effect of allowable head-loss in the lateral pipeline on inlet pressure, a new equation was developed for calculating this factor. A progression coefficient was assumed for variable discharge of the outlets. The results showed that though the inlet pressure of the lateral depends on the head loss between the outlets, it is negligible when more than 15 outlets are used. It was also concluded that when N is less than 15 and the ratio of distance between inlet and first outlet to outlet spacing is less than 1, the conventional approaches overestimate the inlet pressure. In this research, a new equation was also developed for Christiansen friction factor in which the first outlet is located {{at a fraction of}} outlet spacing. This new factor is dependent on the head loss between the first and last outlets, in addition to the number of outlets and the power of velocity equation. The results of applying this new factor showed good correlation with other researchers’ numerical results when a large number of outlets are coalesced...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} a new design technique for <b>sprinkler</b> irrigation <b>laterals</b> with equally spaced sprinklers and constant longitudinal slope. The technique uses the Darcy-Weisbach friction formula and {{accounts for the}} variation of the friction coefficient for a significant practical portion on a Moody diagram. The head loss in sprinkler risers as well as losses in lateral pipe fittings are considered. A computer program employing this technique is designed so as to provide sprinkler outflows and pressure head distributions along the lateral pipe. The results from two numerical examples are compared with results obtained from a widely used classical method. In some cases {{it is found that}} designs are substantially differen...|$|R
40|$|Pipelines with {{multiple}} outlets are used extensively for irrigation under {{various types of}} surface, sprinkler and trickle irrigation systems. In this research, a lateral pipeline with two diameters (tapered), laid on horizontal, uphill and downhill slopes that usually faced in design were investigated using back stepwise method. Effect of different parameters such as variation of friction factor along the pipeline, variation of discharge with head and velocity head on the total head loss and pressure along the pipeline was studied. Location of average operating pressure head along the pipeline for different slopes and tapering length ratios, which is important for computing the inlet and end pressures head, was estimated. Furthermore, empirical equations for estimating the ratio of head loss at location of average pressure head to the total head loss were developed. Then the pressure head at the upstream end or downstream end can be computed using friction correction factor method. The results showed that neglecting the effect of variation of friction factor underestimate the value of head loss along the lateral and neglecting the effect of variation in discharge overestimate the value of head loss, therefore, neglecting effects of the two parameters {{at the same time}} leads to a value of head loss very near to the value of exact solution. The velocity head have small effect on the head loss and can be neglected at <b>sprinkler</b> <b>laterals</b> but it has effect on the total head. Finally, example is given to show how to use the proposed empirical equations at inlet and end pressure computation...|$|R
40|$|The study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the effect of operating parameters of the sprinkler Super 10, manufactured by NaanDanJain, with green, yellow and blue nozzles on the hydraulic characterization, so that this information can contribute to a better dimensioning of systems and management of irrigated areas. For the determination of UC and UD the radial method was used and {{with the aid of}} computer application CATCH 3 D the overlapping of water slides with ten spacings was calculated. The results demonstrate that the mechanism used for the fractionation of the water jet of sprinkler Super 10 is efficient because it presented good uniformity of water distribution and low amplitude of precipitation. For high uniformity of distribution of water in the larger wetting radii, it is recommended to work with Super 10 sprinkler using the green nozzle, with a pressure of 40 mH 2 O and spacing between <b>sprinklers</b> and <b>lateral</b> lines 12 × 12 m...|$|R
40|$|The basic {{aim of the}} {{sprinkler}} irrigation method, as in other irrigation methods, is to apply irrigation water as uniformly {{as possible to the}} root zone. The uniform distribution of the applied water in {{sprinkler irrigation}} depends on factors such as sprinkler type, number and size of nozzles, arrangement of sprinklers, working pressure and the speed and direction of the wind. <b>Sprinkler</b> and <b>lateral</b> spacing should be determined by also taking the speed and direction of the wind into consideration. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the application limits and the curves of water distribution under different working pressures, spatial arrangement and nozzle diameters under field conditions of some irrigation sprinklers which are widely used in Turkey. The objective was to determine the most appropriate system arrangement by using a computer program called CATCH 3 D. Five sprinklers were tested in the experimental area of Ondokuz Mayis University Campus and their water distribution characteristics identified. The most suitable operating parameters for Bereket 3 : 12 x 18 m, Bereket 2 : 12 x 18 m, Egeyildiz 6 x 18 m, Goktepe 6 x 12 m and for Atesler sprinkler 12 x 18 m arrangement type were determined. </p...|$|R
40|$|Dairy manure {{increases}} the yields of dry bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) from eroded, furrow-irrigated soils and may increase corn (Zea mays L.) silage yield from steeper eroded areas under sprinkler irrigation. In a 2 -year field study in southern Idaho on Portneuf silt loam (coarse silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Durinodic Xeric Haplocalcid), {{the effects of}} a one-time, fall application of 29 or 72 Mg ha- 1 of dry manure or 22 or 47 Mg ha- 1 of dry compost on subsequent silage yield and nitrogen (N) uptake from previously eroded, sprinkler-irrigated hill slopes were evaluated. In October 1999, stockpiled or composted dairy manure was disked to a depth of 0. 15 m into plots with slopes from 0. 8 to 4. 4 %. After planting field corn in 2000 and 2001, a low-pressure, six-span traveling <b>lateral</b> <b>sprinkler</b> system was utilized to apply water at 28 mm h- 1 in amounts sufficient to satisfy evapotranspiration to 6. 4 - × 36. 6 -m field plots. Yields in 2000 were 27. 5 Mg ha- 1, similar among all rates of all amendments and a fertilized control. In 2001, compost applied at oven-dry rates up to 47 Mg ha- 1 increased yield compared to controls. Silage yield in 2001 increased initially then decreased with increasing manure applications. Where compost or manure was applied, regardless of rate, 2 -year average N uptake was 15 % greater than controls. Regardless of treatment or year, yields decreased linearly as soil slope increased...|$|R
