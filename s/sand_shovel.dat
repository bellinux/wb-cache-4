5000|$|The Days of <b>Sand</b> and <b>Shovels</b> - 3:45 - (Doyle Marsh, George Reneau) ...|$|R
50|$|The two Pandas {{competing}} in Dakar 2007 have been equipped specifically for this rally: so room {{has been found}} inside for accessories like aluminium platforms to help extricate the vehicles from soft <b>sand,</b> <b>shovels,</b> spare wheels, water reserves for the crew, and other specialised equipment useful for the occasion. The Fiat expedition to Dakar included a Fiat Sedici as service back-up, and three Iveco trucks to transport spares and technicians.|$|R
6000|$|... "But you did {{not seem}} to be exerting yourself," [...] Osip said. [...] "You were as cool and as quiet as if you had been <b>shovelling</b> <b>sand.</b> You even laughed when he rushed at you." ...|$|R
60|$|In some cases, {{the body}} of a cart may be taken down, and deep ruts having been dug {{on each side of the}} mass, the vehicle can be backed, till the {{axletree}} comes across it; then, after lashing and making fast, the <b>sand</b> can be <b>shovelled</b> from below the mass, which will hang suspended from the axletree, and may be carted away. Or a sledge may be built beneath the mass by burrowing below it and thrusting the poles beneath it. Then the remainder of the intervening <b>sand</b> can be <b>shovelled</b> away, and the mass, now resting directly upon the sledge, can be dragged away by a team of cattle.|$|R
60|$|They {{thought that}} this would be a fine plan, and {{wondered}} why they had not thought of it before. A few days afterwards, they decided to buy two little shovels with their money, one for each, so that they might <b>shovel</b> <b>sand</b> and gravel easier than with the wooden shovels that Jonas made.|$|R
500|$|The murders {{continued}} for two days, claiming {{a total of}} 33,771 victims. <b>Sand</b> was <b>shovelled</b> and bulldozed over the bodies and {{the sides of the}} ravine were dynamited to bring down more material. Anton Heidborn, a member of Sonderkommando 4a, later testified that three days later that there were still people alive among the corpses. Heidborn spent the next few days helping smooth out the [...] "millions" [...] of banknotes taken from the victims' possessions. The clothing was taken away, destined to be re-used by German citizens. Jeckeln's troops shot more than 100,000 Jews by the end of October.|$|R
50|$|Suna-mushi {{is a kind}} of bathing. First bathers put on a yukata. They {{are covered}} with sand and steamed by sands, which is {{agitated}} to be a moderate temperature. It is difficult to bath alone, so staff are on hand to <b>shovel</b> <b>sand</b> over bathers. Draping a towel around the head is advised to keep sand from sticking to it.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1980s when the planned economy {{was in the}} latest phase of its struggle, even {{technically}} advanced projects were attempted to be progressed by sending numbers of unskilled volunteers to help {{under the umbrella of}} Initiative Z. However, the lack of skills among volunteers often resulted in contra-productive outcome and faulty results of volunteer work, although well hidden, regularly led to even longer delays. Many participants recalled futile work be ordered upon them, for illustration having to shuffle a large heap of <b>sand</b> with <b>shovels</b> and wheelbarrows the whole day by 20 meters, just to witness it being relocated by a machine to its original location in the following working days.|$|R
50|$|The show also {{featured}} woodchopping contests, contest involving <b>sand</b> and blue-metal <b>shovelling,</b> sheaf tossing, track-cycle sprint-racing on rollers (with world champion cyclist Sid Patterson taking on all comers), and {{a game of}} indoor football invented specifically for that show in that particular studio space. The show was also famous for having champion VFL footballers of the day appearing on the show to contest the Handball Competition, and receive prizes such as meat pies and hairdriers.|$|R
40|$|Photograph {{of two men}} digging {{around a}} cross for a funeral in the desert, [s. d. ]. One man {{can be seen from}} behind digging a hole in the <b>sand</b> with a <b>shovel.</b> A second man holds up a tall wooden cross in the hole with both of his hands as he looks upward at the cross. Both men wear jackets, while the second is wearing a hat. Shrubs and {{mountains}} are visible in the background...|$|R
50|$|The {{play has}} four scenes. It {{opens with a}} lengthy mimed {{sequence}} in which John and Winston, two cell mates in prison on Robben Island, <b>shovel</b> <b>sand</b> in the scorching heat, dumping the sand {{at the feet of}} the other man, so that the pile of sand never diminishes. This is designed to exhaust the body and the morale of the prisoners. It later includes a play within a play, as Winston and John perform a condensed two-person version of Antigone by Sophocles.|$|R
5000|$|It enjoys [...] {{in the sun}} in {{the morning}} and evening. When threatened, the lizard will shoot blood out of the corners of its eyes. However, this is mainly used in desperate emergencies, else it will try to run to the nearest bush it can find, dive in a rodent's burrow, or bury/shuffle into the <b>sand</b> like a <b>shovel.</b> If it is grabbed, it will swell, hiss, stab with its horns, and try to bite. If further {{provocation}} occurs, the blood-squirting starts.|$|R
50|$|Periwinkle {{is nervous}} {{about going to}} school. To help him, Blue and Joe turn Blue's house into a make-believe {{kindergarten}} with games about science, math, rhyming, art, and more. Choose from five games with Blue, Joe, and friends, while three adjustable levels of difficulty match children's growth. Play Refrigerator Rhymes in Blue's kitchen, tell time with Tickety, learn math at the <b>Sand</b> Table with <b>Shovel</b> and Pail, and—at Peri's fort—there's Super Science.Differences between the episode and the video game1. In the season 5 episode Ms. marigold is Present. But in the video game she's not.|$|R
50|$|Masonry piers {{were built}} to heights of almost 120 ft, about {{the height of}} a ten-story building. About 78 ft of that span was driven through the sandy {{riverbed}} until it hit bedrock. Eads implemented a building method that he had observed in Europe, whereby masonry was set atop a metal chamber filled with compressed air. Stone was added to the chamber, which caused the caisson to sink. Workers then dove into the caisson to <b>shovel</b> <b>sand</b> into a pump that shot it out into the air so the masonry could be sunk into the riverbed. Thirteen men died during this process and two were paralyzed, suffering from what we now know as the bends. Still today, the Eads Bridge is built on the deepest pneumatic caisson ever constructed.|$|R
5000|$|In late of 1792, he {{directed}} {{the construction of}} what later became the White House. Thus, on 12 October this year, Pedro Casanave buried the first stone in the building (date that coincides with the 300th anniversary of the Discovery of Americas by Christopher Columbus). This took place when, one day, after a big party at the tavern [...] "The Fountain Inn" [...] (where the upper class normally met), the inaugural procession came to a solar (where would be built the Presidential Palace) and some workmen (after open a small hole in the ground), gave him the stone to Casanave and he buried it, covering it with <b>sand</b> (using a <b>shovel</b> for it). It is known that, before placing it, he had placed, under, a bronze plaque in which can read: ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} over 18 months at Strawberry Studios in Stockport and The Manor in Shipton-on-Cherwell, Oxfordshire, with Godley, Creme and engineer Martin Lawrence going to extraordinary lengths to create its special effects. At one point, {{to create the}} impression that the listener is inside a coffin during a burial, a binaural [...] "head" [...] microphone unit was placed behind a board {{at the foot of a}} flight of stairs, while Godley <b>shovelled</b> <b>sand</b> on to it. Three days were spent producing a saxophone sound from an electric guitar; each note of a guitar solo was recorded separately and faded in on the track, which was then sent through a speaker and out of a rubber hose with perforated cigarette paper at the end. Enough pressure was displaced by forcing the sound through the holes of the cigarette paper to give the rasp of a saxophone.|$|R
60|$|So {{here again}} I was thrown upon a cruel world with only six dollars {{between myself and}} the wolf. Again I fell back upon my {{physical}} powers. I made the round of all the factories seeking manual labor. I {{went out on the}} Catfish, where, through great sheds erected for the manufacture of farm machinery, I passed from superintendent to foreman, from foreman to boss,--eager to wheel <b>sand,</b> paint woodwork, <b>shovel</b> coal--anything at all to keep from sending home for money--for, mind you, my father or my uncle would have helped me out had I written to them, but I could not do that. So long as I was able to keep a roof over my head, I remained silent. I was in the world and I intended to keep going without asking a cent from anyone. Besides, the grandiloquent plans for travel and success which I had so confidently outlined to Burton must be carried out.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the printer}} {{finishes}} its work, the final structure must be extruded from the <b>sand.</b> Workers use <b>shovels</b> {{to take out}} the excess sand and reveal the final product. The magnesium oxide mixed in with the sand causes the sand to become an active participant rather than inert during the reaction with the binder. If the sand was inert, the resulting material would be more like concrete in that the sand would be only slightly bound together, but because of the MgO, the final product is a mineral-like material with a microcrystalline structure. Compared to concrete, which has low resistance to tension and as a result needs iron reinforcement, D-Shape's structures have relatively high tension resistance and require no iron reinforcement. The entire building process is reported to take a quarter of the time and a third to a half of the cost [...] it would take to build the same structure with traditional means using portland cement, the material currently used in building construction.|$|R
60|$|This {{morning the}} girls are all out {{on the beach in}} pairs and threes, the pupils being all happily shut up with their tutor. I see the invalid lady creep out with her beach-rest from the {{intermediate}} house, and come down to her usual morning station {{in the shade of a}} rock, unaware, poor thing, that it has been monopolised by Isa and Metelill. Oh, girls! why don't you get up and make room for her? No; she moves on to the next shady place, but there Pica has a perfect fortification of books spread on her rug, and Charley is sketching on the outskirts, and the fox-terrier barks loudly. Will she go on to the third seat? where I can see, though she cannot, Jane and Avice sitting together, and Freddy <b>shovelling</b> <b>sand</b> at their feet. Ah! at last she is made welcome. Good girls! They have seated her and her things, planted a parasol to shelter her from the wind, and lingered long enough not to make her feel herself turning them out before making another settlement out of my sight.|$|R
40|$|The {{robustness}} of Boolean operations between solids {{is crucial}} for the usability of a solid modeler like HP PE/SolidDesigner. Unfortunately, geometric modeling is like shoveling <b>sand.</b> With every <b>shovel</b> {{you pick up a}} bit of dirt. The numerically imperfect nature of geometric algorithms can challenge HP PE/SolidDesigner’s Boolean engine with contradictions and inconsistencies. The Boolean engine uses a perturbation method 1, 2 to push the frontier of robustness. This article explains the notion of model consistency and demonstrates what can go wrong inside a Boolean operation {{and what can be done}} to come up with a correct result anyway. Consistency of a Solid Looking at a solid we usually believe that it is mathematically correct, that is, that the edges are exactly on their adjacent faces and the edges meet exactly at their common vertices. In reality, however, the limited floating-point accuracy of a computer introduces errors. On the microscopic level there are gaps and holes everywhere (see Fig. 1). The tolerable amount of error is specified by the modeling resolution. The syste...|$|R

40|$|Larvae of the European {{stonefly}} Isoptena serricornis (Pictet) live {{buried in}} shifting sand and prefer erosional over depositional habitats. Specimens from Germany, Sachsen-Anhalt, were studied in laboratory streams. The species is univoltine. Eggs develop directly between ca 12 and 21 °C; at 7 °C development is delayed, at lower temperature it fails. Setal screens {{on the head}} are used to <b>shovel</b> <b>sand</b> away; screens also protect articulations. First instar larvae live on yolk reserves. Later instar larvae swallow entire Oligochaeta, larval Chironomidae and sediment-dwelling Leuctra nigra (Olivier) (Plecoptera, Leuctridae) were not eaten. Mode of hunting is unknown. Feeding larvae contain much sand in the fore-gut which may extend far into the abdomen. Individual sand grains may be half {{as wide as the}} head. Amount of sand in the gut decreases with body size; between 40 and 75 % of larval dry weight are ash. In view of gut structure, sand cannot be used to grind food; probably, sand is ballast permitting the larvae to live in erosional habitats. In the laboratory, adults emerged at dusk as soon as larvae were full grown. Adults ate little, and indiscriminately. Signalling was not observed, mating occured upon encounter, oviposition followed at the age of 8 - 10 days. Potential fecundity was 75 eggs or less. Eggs are large, compared with other Perloidea...|$|R
5000|$|The first coat of render is from 1/2 to 3/4 inches thick, and is mixed, {{dependant}} on {{the surface}} to be covered, in the proportions of {{from one part of}} cement to two of sand to one part to six of <b>sand.</b> A ½ <b>shovel</b> of Lime is often added to make the mix more pliable. After dampening the surface to be coated, two horizontal bands of render called [...] "screeds" [...] are applied, one at around head height and the other just above floor level, these are then marked for vertical/horizontal alignment, finished, then allowed to partially dry. In a process similar to laying concrete, the wall is then rendered to a slightly higher level than the screeds, and using a [...] "straight edge" [...] (screed), the Plasterer uses the screeds as guides removing the excess render and leaving a rough flat surface. For a lower cost finish or if a rough surface is specified the screeds can be dispensed with. The render is then finished with a float (a smooth flat wooden tool with handle) to fill or remove larger imperfections. For some applications where a stronger key is required the surface is scored by later use of a float with nails protruding from the base. If the render is to be the finished surface then a float with a sponge attached to the base is then used on the wall until the surface is blemish free.|$|R
60|$|The {{mine was}} a large open cutting, and the prisoners were {{employed}} in digging the sand and carrying it on hand-barrows {{to the place where}} it was to be washed. The work was not entirely performed by prisoners, as there were many free labourers also employed. Godfrey was given a shovel, and his work consisted in loading the sand and gravel, as the pickmen got it down, on to the barrows. Being unaccustomed to work, his back ached and his hands were blistered {{by the end of the}} day; but he knew, from his experience in rowing, that this would pass off before long. At any rate the labour was far easier than he had anticipated. He had expected to see overseers with whips, but there was nothing of the sort. A few men directed the labour, and spoke sharply enough if they saw any of the prisoners shirking, but there was nothing to distinguish it from any other work of the kind, save the Cossack guards here and there leaning upon their muskets, and certainly the men worked no harder than ordinary labourers would do. Indeed, when the time was up and the prisoners started on their return towards the prison, the free labourers continued their work, and would do so, he afterwards learned, for some hours, as it would take a considerable time for all the sand obtained during the day to be thoroughly washed up and the gold extracted. Godfrey had at first looked narrowly at the <b>sand</b> as he <b>shovelled</b> it, for specks of gold, but had seen none; and indeed the proportion of gold at the mines of Kara was so small that they would not have paid if worked by free labour; but the produce served to lessen the expenses of the prisons, and the mines afforded work to the convicts. The prisoners were not forbidden to talk, and Godfrey, who had happened to be placed next to a young fellow of the better class, learned a good many particulars as to the mines. He had seen no women at them, and asked if they were not employed at that labour.|$|R
