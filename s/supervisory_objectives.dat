Analysis shows the AIRB approach undercapitalizes credit risk relative to regulatory targets and allows wide variation in capital requirements for a given exposure owing to ambiguity in the definitions of loss given default and exposure at default.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} conclusion {{drawn from}} the recent financial crisis is that the supervision and regulation of financial firms in isolation - a purely microprudential perspective - are not sufficient to maintain financial stability. Rather, a macroprudential perspective, which evaluates and responds to the financial system as a whole, seems necessary, and the ongoing discussions of regulatory reform in the United States underscore this view. The recently concluded Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP), {{better known as the}} bank 'stress test,' is one example of how the macro- and microprudential perspectives can be joined to create a stronger supervisory framework that addresses a wider range of <b>supervisory</b> <b>objectives.</b> This paper reviews the key features of the SCAP and discusses how they can be leveraged to improve bank supervision in the future...|$|E

40|$|Using a {{one common}} factor Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) {{equilibrium}} model of credit risk, this paper derives unbiased capital allocation rules for portfolios in which idiosyncratic risk is fully diversified. When these rules are {{compared with the}} Basel II Internal Ratings Based (IRB) minimum capital requirements for corporate exposures, the comparison shows that the Basel Advanced IRB (A-IRB) approach drastically undercapitalizes portfolio credit risk relative to the supervisory target of a 99. 9 percent bank solvency rate. Estimates show that Basel regulations will allow fully compliant A-IRB banks to have default rates that exceed 5 percent. In contrast, the Foundation IRB minimum capital requirements allocate multiple times the capital necessary to achieve the <b>supervisory</b> <b>objective.</b> These results raise {{a number of important}} issues including the potential for increased systemic risk as regulatory capital rules promote banking sector consolidation and poor risk management standards in A-IRB banks...|$|R
40|$|In {{financial}} market studies, public supervision {{has rarely been}} found to have any effects on {{financial market}} development. This is true, even though the primary objective of supervisory legislation is the limitation of market failures and externalities. Studies conducted by eg the World Bank and La Porta & al imply that whereas private enforcement contributes to financial market development, there is limited evidence that public supervision does the same. The objective of the paper is to empirically investigate the relation between public supervision and financial market development. This is done by focusing on major legislative features directing the supervisor and hence affecting market participant activities. The markets investigated comprise banks, investment firms, investment fund companies and listed companies in the United States, United Kingdom, Sweden, Finland, Poland and Estonia for the years 1996 to 2005. The results suggest that certain features of public supervision correlate with financial market development. Strong legal obligations for the supervisor to develop legislation correlate significantly with higher company market values. Emphasizing economic aspects in the formulation of <b>supervisory</b> <b>objectives</b> corresponds with higher market profitability. Furthermore, severe monetary sanctions applicable to company directors correlate negatively with market growth. Unexpectedly, {{the same is true for}} a high degree of supervisory independence. The results imply links between public supervision and financial market development in a manner not always in line with previous research. Why this is the case, requires further investigation. One possible explanation may be methodological, based on the fact that in the present study legislative features are perceived in a conceptual rather than a technical manner. financial institution; regulation; supervision; utility...|$|E

A mobile learning intervention aimed at strengthening supervisory support for community health workers (CHWs) in Kibera and Makueni, Kenya, created a WhatsApp group for CHWs and their supervisors to support supervision, professional development, and team building. We analyzed 6 months of WhatsApp chat logs (from August 19, 2014, to March 1, 2015) and conducted interviews with CHWs and their supervisors to understand how they used this instant messaging tool. During the study period, 1, 830 posts were made by 41 participants. Photos were {{a key component of}} the communication among CHWs and their supervisors: 430 (23. 4 %) of all posts contained photos or other media. Of the remaining 1, 400 text-based posts, 87. 6 % (n =  1, 227) related to at least 1 of 3 defined supervision objectives: (1) quality assurance, (2) communication and information, or (3) supportive environment. This supervision took place in the context of posts about the roll out of the new mobile learning intervention and the delivery of routine health care services, as well as team-building efforts and community development. Our preliminary investigation demonstrates that with minimal training, CHWs and their supervisors tailored the multi-way communication features of this mobile instant messaging technology to enact virtual one-to-one, group, and peer-to-peer forms of supervision and support, and they switched channels of communication depending on the <b>supervisory</b> <b>objectives.</b> We encourage additional research on how health workers incorporate mobile technologies into their practices to develop and implement effective supervisory systems that will safeguard patient privacy, strengthen the formal health system, and create innovative forms of community-based, digitally supported professional development for CHWs...|$|E
40|$|Concern with bank {{failures}} and crises {{due to the}} increased volume and complexity of banking risks has emphasised banking regulatory policy that is aimed towards helping to ensure bank safety. In response to the changing banking environment, prudential supervision has increased in importance. This study is an empirical evaluation {{of the impact of}} the present and evolving supervisory system in Zimbabwe. The ultimate aim is to identify the most appropriate system that can best meet <b>supervisory</b> <b>objectives.</b> It is found that capital adequacy supervision is a central requirement for effective supervision. Three research methods were applied to the problem: field survey, theory and related statistical analysis, and simulation. The field survey established the pressures leading to supervision, and the objectives, instruments and likely effects of supervision in Zimbabwe. Theory and practical policy considerations were then used to draw out the potential empirical effects of supervision. For statistical testing purposes, supervision was proxied as the imposition of capital adequacy constraints. The general methodological approach used was to analyse trends in performance and condition of banks before and after the implementation of supervision. Since the Zimbabwean supervisory system is new, a comparative study of other developing countries' supervision was undertaken. Non-statistical, financial simulation experiments were then carried out to illustrate more clearly the important policy implications of the results. xviii The results confirmed the importance of capital adequacy analysis. It was concluded that capital ratios should be strengthened as volume of operations increased and the operating environment became risky. Whilst gearing ratios were useful in relating the volume of operations to capital strength, the results indicated the comparative suitability of adopting the risk assets ratios which facilitates more detailed risk appraisal. However, it was concluded that capital ratios, used alone, are not adequate indicators of overall prudential soundness. Close and adequate monitoring of all bank operations are also essential...|$|E

40|$|This {{comparative}} analysis discusses {{the differences between}} the structure and systems of bank regulation operating in the UK, Germany, Italy and the US. The importance of harmonisation in achieving stated <b>supervisory</b> <b>objectives</b> is also emphasised. The main objective of this chapter is to illustrate how the external auditor's role could be harnessed more efficiently in the UK banking regulatory and supervisory process. This is of particular importance given the reduced supervisory role which the Bank of England has assumed since banking regulatory and supervisory powers and functions were transferred to the Financial Services Authority. External audits and in particular external auditors, have a greater role to play in bank regulation and supervision than was the case over 20 years ago. This is so mainly as a result of globalisation. The need for a single regulator which regulates not just the banking sector, but also the insurance and securities sectors, has arisen principally because of the rise of conglomerate firms. Single regulators are able to manage more effectively cross sector services' risks. Correspondingly, the functional overlaps between banking, insurance and securities business and their universal scope {{make it more difficult for}} a regulator to observe and comprehend such businesses. The difficulty of measuring and assessing risk within such institutions along with the speed with which assets can be adjusted in derivatives markets has led to more emphasis being placed on internal managerial control. Consideration is also being given to the structures that can be put in place to re inforce the incentives of all parties involved – not just to management but all parties including auditors and regulators. Because banking has evolved to a stage where conglomerates now have a significant presence and provide a range of services (and not just banking services), and because of the growing presence of international firms, the role of the external auditor has become so important. ...|$|E
40|$|PhDThis thesis {{presents}} a critical analysis {{and evaluation of}} the current Korean banking regulatory and supervisory system. The objective is to identif' continuing structural weaknesses of the Korean banking system and to suggest areas of regulatory and supervisory system reform. The focus of this analysis and evaluation is centred around the following three questions: (1) Who should be the regulator? (2) What substantive standards of supervision should be applied? and (3) Administratively, in what manner should these standarus be applied? Finally, the causes, responses, and implications for reform as to the recent Korean financial crisis are discussed. The Korean banking system has been characterised as a "governmental control system" for credit allocation. This system, with lax prudential regulation and supervision, creates inevitable problems for the banks. For example, Korean banks have been largely precluded from true market and commercially oriented practices and {{have been exposed to}} significant credit and other risks due to governmental policy directed lending and other non-commercially induced banking practices. The main theme of this thesis is that Korea's reformed and restructured regulatory and supervisory system should be structurally removed from undue governmental and political interference; that is, should be sufficiently divorced and protected from governmental economic policy objectives and, more generally, from objectives that are inconsistent with "safety and soundness" based banking regulatory and <b>supervisory</b> <b>objectives</b> and with market oriented practices. Balancing this structural independence and market orientation, a reformed and restructured system should provide a high degree of transparency and accountability. Reform should aim not only at establishing effective supervisory standards, but also at ensuring effective monitoring and enforcement. A first step to the reform is for the government to define and adhere to a primary policy objective of banking policy, i. e. "financial stability" through sound and effective Korean banking regulation and supervision. To achieve such financial stability, Korea will need to implement appropriate measures that can ensure that the banking system is "safe and sound", consistently with evolving international standards; that banks are free from undue governmental and political interference and control; and that the banking system operates within a competitive and commercially driven market environment. The financial crisis in 1997 has demonstrated many of the current weaknesses of the Korean financial system. The need for certainty of process, for a clear, realistic and transparent timetable for restructuring, and for an effective exit policy for troubled commercial banks, are some of the lessons to be learned from this crisis...|$|E
40|$|Effective problem bank {{identification}} and resolution {{is crucial to}} ensure not only the soundness of a bank {{but also for the}} resilience of the financial system as a whole since banks are dominant players in the financial system. Successful problem bank management will reduce the potential of both individual bank failures and banking crisis as well as minimise resolution costs. Hence, a comprehensive, clear framework and guidelines for dealing with problem banks is crucial. This study aims at two main objectives: (i) to analyse the framework and process of problem {{bank identification}}, intervention and resolution in the SEACEN countries; and (ii) to identify key issues and lessons learned for an effective problem bank management. In general, bank supervisors in nine SEACEN surveyed countries have a clear legal and prudential framework in dealing with problem banks. However, the level of progress diverges from country to country depending on their legal and political settings as well as economic development. Crisis hit countries (Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand), and countries experiencing banking system distresses (Philippines and Republic of China, Taiwan) appear to have a more developed framework, particularly on crisis management. Supervisory authorities in the crisis countries have enhanced the effectiveness of their banking supervision along with the post-crisis bank restructuring program. However, non crisis hit countries (Cambodia, Nepal, Papua New Guinea and Sri Lanka) have a less comprehensive framework. Non-crisis countries mostly are yet to have an explicit deposit insurance scheme and develop a crisis management framework. Among key challenges for bank supervisors is to ensure both macro and micro <b>supervisory</b> <b>objectives</b> ¨C to maintain financial stability and ensure depositor protection ¨C are effectively attained. In practice, it often is difficult to identify and measure as well as manage systemic risk which requires different skills and methodologies. Therefore, it is imperative to perform ¨C and enhance the efficacy of ¨C macro-prudential surveillance to identify, monitor and mitigate the risks to the financial system. For countries which are yet to have a crisis management framework it is important to develop comprehensive financial safety nets, consisting of: (i) an explicit and limited deposit insurance scheme; (ii) a well-defined and transparent LLR both in normal times and during systemic crises; and (iii) a clear crisis management framework. Deposit insurance and LLR can be important tools for crisis management, but they are not sufficient to prevent banking crises. They should be used along with measures such as market discipline and prudential banking supervision. A well-devised framework is essential, but effective implementation is much more important. It is necessary to perform a crisis simulation regularly in order to increase readiness in managing crisis Therefore, capacity building is indispensable. ...|$|E

40|$|The global {{financial}} crisis has uncovered {{a number of}} weaknesses in the supervision and regulation of cross border banks. One such weakness {{was the lack of}} effective cooperation among banking supervisors. Since then, international bodies, such as the G- 20, the Financial Stability Board and the Basel Committee have actively promoted the use of <b>supervisory</b> colleges. The <b>objective</b> {{of this paper is to}} explore the obstacles to effective cross border supervisory information sharing. More specifically, a schematic presentation illustrating the misalignments in incentives for information sharing between home and host supervisors under the current supervisory task-sharing anchored in the Basel Concordat is developed. This paper finds that in the absence of an ex ante agreed upon resolution and burden-sharing mechanism and deteriorating health of the bank, incentive conflicts escalate and supervisory cooperation breaks down. The promotion of good practices for cooperation in supervisory colleges is thus not sufficient to address the existing incentive conflicts. What is needed is a rigorous analysis and review of the supervisory task-sharing framework, so that the right incentives are secured during all stages of the supervisory process. For this purpose, it is essential that policy makers integrate and harmonize the current debates on crisis management, resolution policy and good supervisory practices for cross border banking supervision.

40|$|An {{important}} {{lesson from the}} financial crisis {{points to the need}} for banks to improve and strengthen their capital planning processes. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision provides a forum for regular cooperation on banking <b>supervisory</b> matters. Its <b>objective</b> is to enhance understanding of key supervisory issues and improve the quality of banking supervision worldwide. The Basel Committee III presents sound practices observed at some banks to foster overall improvement in the capital planning processes of banks required to implement the Basel III framework. It is not intended to outline a one-size-fits-all approach to capital planning, as it is understood that banks would need to adopt solutions that are tailored to their individual circumstances (BCBS, 2010). Indian banking system has withstood the pressure of global financial turmoil because of: (i) upsurge in domestic saving rate, and (ii) improvement in the capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR). The various factors that led to and precipitated the crisis are now well known and documented. Therefore, this paper does not discuss the causes of the financial crisis but focuses on the actions taken so far by the government, central bankers and regulators over the last one year for strengthening financial regulation and supervision. This paper investigates the proximately explanatory factors behind the cross country differentials in the capital to risk weighted assets ratio.

Barth, Chen Lin and Clas Wihlborg This book {{is aimed}} at {{researchers}} and students of financial institutions in academia {{as well as in}} private financial institutions and public regulatory and <b>supervisory</b> authorities. Its <b>objective</b> is to bring the reader to the frontier of research on governance of financial institutions by interpreting and reviewing current research, as well as to push the frontier by presenting original research on new aspects of financial institution governance. To inspire future research the book also includes chapters on governance policy issues that require more attention by researchers. The recent financial crisis has stimulated a debate on governance of financial institutions as well as research on effects of governance arrangements on the risk-taking, performance and behavior of financial institutions more generally. Furthermore, researchers are asking how regulation, legislation, politics and other factors influence governance of financial institutions and, thereby, their behavior in different dimensions. The contents of this book reflect this variety of research on financial institutions with governance as the unifying theme. For many countries around the world the recent financial crisis was the worst they had experienced since the Great Depression of the 1930 s. Financial institutions clearly were the center of attention as a large number of them either failed or were bailed out by governments during 2007 to 2010.

40|$|Abstract (english) Objectives The main {{objective}} of this work is to design methods and proceadures enhancing effectiveness and efficiency of IT audit in banks with the accent given to their use by the <b>supervisory</b> authorities. Another <b>objective</b> of the work (and an essential starting point at the same time) is a summary and assesment of methods and proceadures developed and implemented into the CNB practice with regard to banking supervision {{in the area of}} information systems. Objectives Achievement From the methodological point of view the esential starting point of the work was represented by above mentioned objectives that were used for elaboration of a set of questions. Questions enabled to set up the hypotheses. (Another more particular hypotheses were defined in order to design the particular solutions in chapter 5.) Futhermore, the critical factors (problems) were defined in the process of the questions analyses. Subsequently, the solutions were specified. The solutions confirmed the hypotheses which reflected the achievement of the objectives. Description, categorisation, analyses, screening, modelling, comparative analyses and sample testing were used to achieve the objectives. In particular, the solutions that were elaborated, making use of methods described above, enhance effectiveness and efficiency of IT audit in banks. Moreover, the CNB's proceadures and methods were introduced and assesed within the work. Scientific Contribution The work brings an evidence of correlation between the quality of IT audit in banks and their economical performance. With this regard the work contributes with original conclusions, benchmarks and proceadures that may be used by banks, supervisory authorities and IT auditors. These conclusions are achieved by description, categorisation, analyses, modelling and screening research highlighting the role of the rentability, the productivity, the risks, the inovations and the economical value of information. Furthermore, the IT audit and IT supervision in banks are specified. They are also compared and contrast to the other audit cathegories. The work presents important peaces of evidence regarding the role of IT audit in this context. This is made by description, cathegorisation and analyses. Another contribution represents proceadures and methods developed and implemented (to the large extend by author) in the field od IT banking supervision in the Czech Republic. This delivers valuable outputs for foreign supervision authorities, banks and auditors. The work lead to original solutions of critical factors. These solutions are to use by IT audit and IT supervision (and also in audit work generally). The solutions make use of ceartain atributes of Capability Maturity Model (CMM) and were elaborated in the proces of decsription, cathegorisation, screening research, comparative analyses, hypotheses seting and testing. The solutions enhances acuracy and objectiveness of assesment done by IT auditors.
