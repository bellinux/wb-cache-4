His contributions to refining the dying process and his theories on colour brought much praise by the well known poet and artist Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.|$|E
5|$|Many regions have {{prescribed}} standards which ambulances should, or must, meet {{in order}} to be used for their role. These standards may have different levels which reflect the type of patient which the ambulance is expected to transport (for instance specifying a different standard for routine patient transport than high dependency), or may base <b>standards</b> <b>on</b> the size of vehicle.|$|E
5|$|While Playford {{was known}} for his use of price {{controls}} to restrain the price of living and therefore attract blue-collar workers to settle in the state and fuel industrialisation, South Australia was slow to introduce consumer protection laws in regards to quality control. It was believed that he was opposed to compulsory pasteurisation and other quality <b>standards</b> <b>on</b> milk to avoid offending his rural support base. Playford's reluctance to introduce regulations for tradesmen such as builders, electricians and plumbers were often seen to have resulted from his being a keen do-it-yourself handyman.|$|E

5|$|Five of the state's {{counties}} are wholly {{within the boundaries}} of sovereign Indian reservations. Because of the limitations of climate and land, and isolation from urban areas with more employment opportunities, living <b>standards</b> <b>on</b> many South Dakota reservations are often far below the national average; Ziebach County ranked as the poorest county in the nation in 2009. The unemployment rate in Fort Thompson, on the Crow Creek Reservation, is 70%, and 21% of households lack plumbing or basic kitchen appliances. A 1995 study by the U.S. Census Bureau found 58% of homes on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation did not have a telephone. The reservations' isolation also inhibits their ability to generate revenue from gaming casinos, an avenue that has proved profitable for many tribes closer to urban centers.|$|E
5|$|In five hours, Frederick lost 9,400 of the 30,000 men {{he brought}} into the battle, more than 30 percent of his army, {{including}} five generals, 101 guns, and nearly all the tents. Frederick required his generals {{to set an example}} of courage and leadership: they led from the front. The same rate of attrition applied throughout the officer corps, which lost half of its strength in the first three campaigns of the war. In addition to human losses, they lost valuable horses and draft animals, 70 munitions wagons, and, a blow to morale, 28 flags, and two <b>standards.</b> <b>On</b> the positive side, Retzow's corps of about 6,000 men, which had not arrived in time to participate in the fighting, remained intact; Frederick had pulled his troops together for an orderly retreat; and the King retained the confidence of his soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The Cambridge Water Company were {{a company}} {{responsible}} for providing potable water to the inhabitants of Cambridge and the surrounding areas. In 1976, they purchased a borehole outside Sawston to deal with rising demand. In 1980, a European Directive was issued requiring nations of the European Community to establish <b>standards</b> <b>on</b> the presence of perchloroethene (PCE) in water, which the United Kingdom did in 1982. It {{was found that the}} Sawston borehole was contaminated with PCE that had originated in a tannery owned by Eastern Counties Leather. Prior to 1980, there was no knowledge that PCE should be avoided or that it could cause harm, but the Cambridge Water Company brought a case against Eastern Counties Leather anyway.|$|E

5|$|When {{designing}} Queen Mary 2, {{the designers}} aimed {{to reduce the}} ship's {{impact on the environment}} by improving fuel efficiency and through better management of waste, not only to reduce fuel costs, but also to increase the service life of the ship, as it was predicted that tighter environmental regulations would be implemented while the ship was in service. Initial targets included the reuse of treated wastewater for non-potable uses and zero discharge of solid waste into the sea. For economic and other reasons, as well as to reduce energy consumption from incineration, some of these measures were not implemented. Queen Mary 2s environmental performance nevertheless is an improvement from that of many older ships, as well as international <b>standards</b> <b>on</b> waste.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the {{constitutional}} prohibition on state involvement in roads was removed. The Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) {{was created in}} 1905, and the department paid counties and townships to improve roads to state <b>standards.</b> <b>On</b> May 13, 1913, the State Reward Trunk Line Highways Act was passed, creating the State Trunkline Highway System. The MSHD assigned internal highway numbers to roads in the system, and in 1919, the numbers were signposted along the roads and marked on maps. The US Highway System was created in 1926, and highways in Michigan were renumbered {{to account for the}} new designations. Legislation in the 1930s consolidated control of the state trunklines in the state highway department. During the 1940s, the first freeways were built in Michigan. With the introduction of the Interstate Highway system in the 1950s, the state aborted an effort to build the Michigan Turnpike, a tolled freeway in the southeast corner of the LP. Construction on Michigan's Interstates started {{in the latter part of}} that decade and continued until 1992. During that period, several freeways were canceled in the 1960s and 1970s, while others were delayed or modified over environmental and political concerns. Since 1992, few additional freeways have been built, and in the early years of the 21st century, projects are underway to bypass cities with new highways.|$|E
5|$|Romania ordered 126 of {{the tanks}} on 14 August 1936 as the R-2 and {{received}} the first 15, which had been diverted from the Czech order, in April–May 1937 to display in a parade. They suffered from numerous teething problems and the Romanians put a hold on production until these issues were resolved. The constantly changing Romanian demands didn't help the situation, but they refused to accept any vehicles until trials were conducted in Romania. Three R-2s were shipped to Romania on 12 July 1938 for the trials, but Skoda knew which one would be chosen and prepared the vehicle well and it passed all tests. After disassembly and checks of the trial tank were completed, the Romanian commission approved the design on 23 August. In the meantime, the initial batch was returned to Skoda to be upgraded to current <b>standards</b> <b>on</b> 28 July. Shipments to Romania began on 1 September with 27 shipped before the Munich Crisis forced the Czechs to hold all remaining tanks in case they were needed. 5 finished tanks and 6 almost-finished tanks were appropriated and shipped to Slovakia although they were quickly returned after the Munich Agreement was signed. The last shipment departed on 22 February 1939.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} team {{felt that}} the original PlayStation era graphics of Rally 2.0 would not hold up to modern <b>standards</b> <b>on</b> a high pixel density mobile display. To improve the graphical quality they introduced modern shader-based rendering and overhauled the textures. The engine specifications for the vehicles were retained from the classic Rally games. Although the models for the vehicles were also preserved, developers increased their resolution and added more detail and graphical layers to the car bodies. Other features that were carried over include the chassis deformation effects and realistic buildup of dirt on the vehicles. PhysX-based collision detection was implemented to enable more objects and debris to scatter. Changes were also made to lighting, audio, controls, and user interface. The team decided to omit a number of Rally 2.0 features, such as multiplayer, manual transmission, variable gear ratios, weather reports, and the cockpit camera view. Game producer Pete Harrison cited creating a polished, core rallying experience for mobile as {{the focal point of}} the project and felt that some features would not be suitable for the short play sessions that they expected from a portable racing game.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{shock of}} the Spanish conquest was {{followed}} by decades of heavy exploitation of the indigenous peoples, allies and foes alike. Over the following two hundred years colonial rule gradually imposed Spanish cultural <b>standards</b> <b>on</b> the subjugated peoples. The Spanish reducciones created new nucleated settlements {{laid out in a}} grid pattern in the Spanish style, with a central plaza, a church and the town hall housing the civil government, known as the ayuntamiento. This style of settlement can still be seen in the villages and towns of the area. The introduction of Catholicism was the main vehicle for cultural change, and resulted in religious syncretism. Old World cultural elements came to be thoroughly adopted by Maya groups. The greatest change was replacement of the pre-Columbian economic order by European technology and livestock; this included the introduction of iron and steel tools to replace Neolithic tools, and of cattle, pigs and chickens. New crops were also introduced; however, sugarcane and coffee led to plantations that economically exploited native labour. Some indigenous elites such as the Xajil Kaqchikel noble family did manage to maintain a level of status into the colonial period. During {{the second half of the}} 18th century, adult male Indians were heavily taxed, often being forced into debt peonage. Western Petén and neighbouring Chiapas remained sparsely populated, and the Maya inhabitants avoided contact with the Spanish.|$|E

The civil government was either run directly by the Spanish and their descendents (the criollos) or was tightly controlled by them. The introduction of Catholicism was the main vehicle for cultural change, and resulted in religious syncretism. Old World cultural elements came to be thoroughly adopted by Maya groups, an example being the marimba, a musical instrument of African origin. The greatest change was the sweeping aside of the pre-Columbian economic order and its replacement by European technology and livestock; this included the introduction of iron and steel tools to replace Neolithic tools, and of cattle, pigs and chickens that largely replaced the consumption of game. New crops were also introduced; however, sugarcane and coffee led to plantations that economically exploited native labour. Sixty per cent of the modern population of Guatemala is estimated to be Maya, concentrated in the central and western highlands. The eastern portion of the country was the object of intense Spanish migration and hispanicization. Guatemalan society is divided into a class system largely based on race, with Maya peasants and artisans at the bottom, the mixed-race ladino salaried workers and bureaucrats forming the middle and lower class and above them the creole elite of pure European ancestry. Some indigenous elites such as the Xajil did manage to maintain a level of status into the colonial period; a prominent Kaqchikel noble family, they chronicled the history of their region.|$|E
