Such motion can cause fragmentation of the road <b>surface,</b> <b>damage</b> to bearings, and plastic deformation or breakage of components.

25|$|The {{skeleton}} {{had belonged}} to an individual who, based on evidence of osteoarthritis in the lumbar vertebrae, eburnation, and severe wear on the teeth with pulp exposure, was about 50 years old – relatively old for an early human – when he died. The bone structure had a gracile character, which contrasts with the morphology of modern indigenous Australians. Parts of the skeleton had deteriorated in situ: substantial portions of the skull were missing {{and most of the}} bones in the limbs have suffered <b>surface</b> <b>damage.</b>|$|E
30|$|The {{thicknesses}} of <b>surface</b> <b>damaged</b> layers {{formed by}} 60 -min HPT were estimated by spectroscopic ellipsometry and cross-sectional TEM. The surface morphologies of Si-QDSLs after a 60 -min HPT were measured by AFM. The etching of the <b>surface</b> <b>damaged</b> layer {{was performed by}} RIE using CF 4 [*]+[*]O 2 gas (4 % O 2 [*]+[*] 96 % CF 4). The gas flow rate, process pressure, and plasma power density were 10 sccm, 4  Pa, and 0.221  W/cm 2, respectively. The surface morphologies after etching were evaluated by AFM and spectroscopic ellipsometry.|$|R

25|$|After {{the fall}} of Goose Green, the British effort was now free to {{concentrate}} on Port Stanley (called Puerto Argentino by the Argentines). From the period between May 2 to May 28, there were three Vulcan sorties planned, but only one was carried out against Base Aérea Militar Malvinas. Argentine sources reveal that two soldiers were slightly injured but no damage was done to the airstrip. Another attempt against the airstrip was carried out during May 24. A package of four GR3s, flying at very low level to avoid radar detection, managed to drop retarding fuse bombs right on the runway. They were supported by two Sea Harriers tossing air burst bombs from high altitude to deceive the air defences. The low-angle fall, however, produced only <b>surface</b> <b>damage,</b> which was repaired six hours after the strike. Argentine sources acknowledge that a Pucará and an Aermacchi were also damaged. One of the GR3s was also hit either by debris, according to the British version, or by antiaircraft fire, according to Argentine sources.|$|E
500|$|Introduced in Resident Evil 3, the Nemesis was {{designed}} under {{the concept of}} a [...] "huge, overpowering monster that could use weapons and intelligently track you anywhere". During development, many different designs were considered. Although some elements remained constant among them, the early designs featured several different degrees of <b>surface</b> <b>damage,</b> as well as different options for clothing such as a protective vest instead of a coat or a nude design similar to the original Tyrant from Resident Evil.|$|E
500|$|Once activated, the ELTs emit a {{radio signal}} {{which can be}} {{detected}} by the satellites of the International Cospas-Sarsat Programme. The ELTs are designed to work {{at or near the}} water's <b>surface.</b> <b>Damage</b> during a crash, shielding by aircraft wreckage or terrain, and submersion in deep water are all factors which may prevent the signal's detection. In a review of accident records maintained by the ICAO over the past 30years, there were 173 accidents involving aircraft over [...] equipped with ELTs; of these, an effective ELT detection was made in only 39 accidents. No signals from ELTs aboard Flight370 were detected.|$|E

30|$|In this study, the {{dependence}} of hydrogen concentration and defect density in Si-QDSL films on the process temperature of HPT was investigated. Diffusion coefficients of hydrogen in Si-QDSLs for several treatment temperatures were estimated by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). Hydrogen incorporation was also investigated by Raman scattering spectroscopy. In addition, spin densities were measured by electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy, and the optimal temperature was explored. The influence of HPT {{on the surface of}} Si-QDSLs was also investigated. The surface morphologies of Si-QDSLs after HPT were measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM), and the thicknesses of the <b>surface</b> <b>damaged</b> layers were estimated by spectroscopic ellipsometry and cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The etching of the <b>surface</b> <b>damaged</b> layer was performed by reactive ion etching (RIE) using a tetrafluoromethane and oxygen (CF 4 [*]+[*]O 2) gas mixture.|$|R

2500|$|Beginning on May 30, 2003, foam {{impact tests}} were {{performed}} by Southwest Research Institute. They used a {{compressed air gun}} to fire a foam block of similar size and mass to that which struck Columbia, at the same estimated speed. To represent {{the leading edge of}} Columbias left wing, RCC panels from NASA stock, along with the actual leading-edge panels from Enterprise, which were fiberglass, were mounted to a simulating structural metal frame. At the beginning of testing, the likely impact site was estimated to be between RCC panel 6 and 9, inclusive. [...] Over many days, dozens of the foam blocks were shot at the wing leading edge model at various angles. [...] These produced only cracks or <b>surface</b> <b>damage</b> to the RCC panels.|$|E
2500|$|Many of the {{surrounding}} buildings were also either damaged or destroyed as the towers fell. 5 WTC suffered a large fire and a partial collapse of its steel structure. Other buildings destroyed include St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church, Marriott World Trade Center (Marriott Hotel 3 WTC), South Plaza (4 WTC), and U.S. Customs (6 WTC). The World Financial Center buildings, 90 West Street, and 130 Cedar Street suffered fires. [...] The Deutsche Bank Building, the Verizon Building, and World Financial Center 3 suffered impact damage from the towers' collapse, as did 90 West Street. One Liberty Plaza survived structurally intact but sustained <b>surface</b> <b>damage</b> including shattered windows. 30 West Broadway was damaged {{by the collapse of}} 7 WTC. The Deutsche Bank Building, which was covered in a large black [...] "shroud" [...] after September 11 to cover the building's damage, was deconstructed because of water, mold, and other severe damage caused by the neighboring towers' collapse.|$|E

2500|$|Glass {{containers}} typically receive two surface coatings, {{one at the}} hot end, {{just before}} annealing and one at the cold end just after annealing. At the hot end a very thin layer [...] of tin(IV) oxide is applied either using a safe organic compound or inorganic stannic chloride. Tin based systems {{are not the only}} ones used, although the most popular. Titanium tetrachloride or organo titanates can also be used. In all cases the coating renders the surface of the glass more adhesive to the cold end coating. At the cold end a layer of typically, polyethylene wax, is applied via a water based emulsion. This makes the glass slippery, protecting it from scratching and stopping containers from sticking together when they are moved on a conveyor. The resultant invisible combined coating gives a virtually unscratchable surface to the glass. Due to reduction of in-service <b>surface</b> <b>damage,</b> the coatings often are described as strengtheners, however a more correct definition might be strength-retaining coatings.|$|E

40|$|Fine-grain {{tungsten}} alloys {{could be}} one of the solutions for the plasma facing materials of future DEMO reactors. In order to evaluate the service performances of the newly developed W alloys under edge plasma irradiation and the synergetic effect of fusion plasma together with high heat flux, both low energy He ions and high energy H, H/He mixed neutral beam irradiation on W-ZrC, W-K, W-Y 2 O 3, W-La 2 O 3 and CVD-W coating were performed respectively at a liner plasma facility (Dalian Nationality University, China) and the neutral beam facility GLADIS (IPP, Germany). <b>Surface</b> <b>damages</b> were characterized, and the crack formation and extension behaviors under ELM-like transient loading after H and H/He mixed beam irradiation were also investigated in the 60 kW EMS- 60 facility (Electron beam Materials testing Scenario) at SWIP (Southwestern Institute of Physics, China). The experimental results indicated that <b>surface</b> <b>damages</b> induced by low or high energy H/He ion/neutral beam didn't closely correlate with the type of tungsten materials. However, H/He (6 at% He concentration) neutral beam induced more significant <b>surface</b> <b>damages</b> of the tested W materials than only H neutral beam irradiation under the similar irradiation conditions. Similarly, the mixed H/He pre-exposure remarkably reduced the critical power of crack initiation compared with the un-irradiated samples under 100 repetitive loads of 1 ms pulse, while no significant degeneration for the case of only H beam irradiation was observed...|$|R
