The balance between protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation is critical for the regulation of physiological processes and its unbalance is the cause of several diseases. Label-free biosensing techniques can provide improved devices for high throughput drug discovery platforms. We have developed two versatile methods to detect the release of protons (H+) associated with the protein phosphorylation catalysed by kinases [1]. The first approach is based on the pH-sensitive response of oxide semiconductor interfaces and the second method detects the pH changes in phosphorylation reaction using a commercial micro pH electrode. Detection on pH-sensitive silicon nitride (Figure 1) shows a remarkably high sensitivity and response. A good correlation was observed between our hypothesis and the experimental results.

This is because direct detection of pH variations is challenging due to the buffering capabilities of the solution and the technological difficulties in developing stable micro-pH electrodes.

This thesis concerns the optimization of the HEMT fabrication process based on an understanding of the physical mechanisms behind the operation of the device. Optimization of a manufacturing process relies on identification of the process steps that have the largest e®ect on the device operation. A simple and fast process for manufacturing large area HEMT devices has been developed. The process is used to find critical processing steps of the HEMT process. For example, it is shown that the ohmic contact annealing step is responsible for a reduction of charge carrier density. The decrease is material dependent and between 10 % and 40 % of the electrons are lost after annealing, resulting in an increase of sheet resistance of 5 % to 40 %. The process is also used to show that the annealing step is also responsible for a more than two orders of magnitude larger buffer leakage.
