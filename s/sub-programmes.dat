Progress can be witnessed in the improved selectivity of the projects, which have become fewer, with more funding and more focus on innovation, and of the involved partners, with increasing participation by universities and research centres. However, despite the maturity of the Nordic crossborder programme, many challenges lie ahead. In general, the Swedish-Norwegian border region continues to lag behind in the Scandinavian socio-economic context, in which the main urban agglomerations (Stockholm, Oslo, and Gothenburg) benefit from competitive territorial advantages such as human capital, knowledge centres, decision-making structures, access to capital, and accessibility. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E

40|$|Inner Scandinavia {{is one of}} the Swedish-Norwegian INTERRE G-A three <b>sub-programmes,</b> and {{has been}} working in operationalizing {{cross-border}} projects in the border area since 1994. To date, several cross-border strategies have been implemented, one for each programming period of the INTERRE G-A programme. This article investigates whether these strategies can be regarded as a type of cross-border planning mechanism in promoting territorial development of the border region. It does so by developing a typology, which captures the essentials of spatial planning, against the background of which the article also analyses Inner Scandinavia governance structures, which involves a whole set of interconnected territorial partnerships between five border counties: Hedmark, Østfold, Akershus (Norway), Värmland and Dalarna (Sweden). Here, the main goal is to see if the Inner Scandinavia governance structure, which was recently altered by the inclusion of the Hedmark–Dalarna cross-border committee, also known as TRU ST, is favourable to the implementation of a genuine and long-term cross-border spatial plan, with the ultimate goal of reducing the barrier effect and improving the territorial capital along the cross-border region. Project dokuments and interviews indicate that the existing cross-border governance model in Inner Scandinavia, led by the INTERRE G-A Steering Committee, produced substantial progresses in reducing the barrier effect, in all its dimensions, and in supporting the territorial development across the border area. Consequently, the role of other cross-border governance structures should be confined to promoting the active involvement and mobilization of local and regional actors in the cross-border cooperation process, and in implementing several cross-border projects with local/regional significance. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E

It outlines {{a vision for the}} development of Ireland’s marine sector and sets clear objectives aimed at achieving this vision, namely to: 1. Assist existing, and largely indigenous, marine sub-sectors to improve their overall competitiveness and engage in activity that adds value to their outputs by utilising knowledge and technology arising from research. 2. Build new research capacity and capability and utilise fundamental knowledge and technology to create new marine-related commercial opportunities and companies. 3. Inform public policy, governance and regulation by applying the knowledge derived from marine research and monitoring. 4.

Through this knowledge, the infrastructure can be further improved. Research database is a project within Roads and Traffic. In this project, data needs to be acquired for research into the effects of road and traffic characteristics on road safety. The quality and quantity of such data decide to an important degree how accurately possible effects can be determined. Therefore this project focuses on the development of a database in which characteristics of roads and the traffic on them, as well as the crashes that occur on these roads, are registered. Such a database has already been available in the United States since late 1980 s: the Highway Safety Information System (HSIS). The HSIS is part of a program of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), in which knowledge concerning road safety should be developed. In the HSIS, road, crashes and traffic data of nine states are registered: Illinois, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Utah, California, North Carolina, Washington State and Ohio. Since 2006, two urban centres have also been available in the HSIS, namely Bangor in Maine and Charlotte in North Carolina. The data that the states and municipalities provided to the HSIS is not specifically collected for the HSIS; it only uses and combines existing data. Since the HSIS appears to have characteristics that are desirable for the research database of SWOV, a pilot study to this system was performed. The results are in this report...|$|E
40|$|Magister Philosophiae (Land and Agrarian Studies) - MPhil(LAS) Land {{reform in}} South Africa {{emerged as one}} of the {{important}} policies for reconciliation, reconstruction and development of the country after years of racial segregation. Its implementation has been three-fold i. e. land restitution, redistribution and tenure reform. The initial <b>sub-programmes</b> of land redistribution i. e. Settlement Land Acquisition Grant (SLAG) and Land Redistribution for Agricultural Development (LRAD) have been confronted with numerous challenges and they have been criticised for influencing group owned projects due to their grant funding models. SLAG required beneficiaries to qualify as households and its failure to date has been largely attributed to unresolved conflicts amongst group members. Under LRAD, although beneficiaries qualified as individuals, the number of grants continued to be challenged by the increasing land prices, and as a result, group-owned projects continued to be created to match the land prices. Both models were demand-driven under the ‘willing buyer, willing seller’ principle. In 2006, government introduced a new model called the Proactive Land Acquisition Strategy (PLAS) which is a ‘supply-driven’ model but operating within the ‘willing buyer, willing seller’ principle. The structural changes introduced in 2010 placed PLAS as the sole land acquisition model under land redistribution. This research investigates the manner in which the implementation of this model assisted to resolve the gaps identified in its predecessors and the reasons thereof. Additionally, the research also investigates characteristics which persisted throughout and why such features persisted. The policy shift from a ‘demand-driven’ to a ‘supply-driven’ model has brought changes in terms of planning, implementation and resource mobilization.

This research focuses on the restitution and redistribution pillars of the land reform programme. The progress made in terms of both these <b>sub-programmes</b> has been disappointing. With reference to redistribution the government has set the target to redistribute 30 % of white owned commercial agricultural land to black persons by 2014. To date, less than 10 % of this target has been achieved and all indications are that the overwhelming majority of land which has been redistributed is not being used productively or have fallen into a state of total neglect. The state of the redistributed land can be attributed to a variety of causes, with the main cause being the government's inability to provide proper post-settlement support to land reform beneficiaries. Against this background it is clear that alternative options have to be identified in order to improve the result of land reform. This article identifies corporate social responsibility (CSR) as one of the missing ingredients in the recipe for a successful land reform programme. The article introduces CSR and discusses the business case for CSR; identifies its benefits; considers its possible limitations; and examines the major drivers behind the notion.

40|$|Introduction] The Seventh EU Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (FP 7) {{was one of}} the world's largest support {{programmes}} for research and development even though the sum of national research budgets in the EU is still higher. More than 2 ̆ 0 ac 55 bn, the third largest section of the European budget, have been invested in knowledge, innovation and human capital with the declared objective to increase the potential for economic growth and to improve European competitiveness. In this effort, FP 7 covered not only different themes and disciplines but addressed different stages of the innovation process and multiple, heterogeneous stakeholders. In the most general terms, the 7 th Framework Programme, as its predecessor, was adopted as an instrument to support the integration of a "European Research Area" (ERA) (Chou, 2012), a "system of research programmes integrating the scientific resources of the European Union", one "in which researchers, scientific knowledge and technology circulate freely" and suitable to "strengthening [the Union's] scientific and technological bases" (European Commission, 2000). It is defined as a clear complement to national research policy {{while at the same time}} addressing the same resources and people - to build a robust, overarching innovation system of strong players with complementary capacities, well networked across national borders. In recent years, following FP 7 's formal conclusion, various evaluation studies have been published, which come to an overall favourable assessment of the programme's achievements. Without doubt, these are relevant, valid and this very paper builds substantially on the many findings that they have established. Until now, however, the internal structure of what we refer to as "the Seventh Framework Programme" remains underexplored. Despite the fact that it has now already been notably adapted for Horizon 2020, little empirical evidence is available on the extent to which its different lines <b>sub-programmes</b> complemented each other, resonated with national efforts and, in so doing, led to satisfaction or frustration among their consortiums of beneficiaries.

The main objective of the paper is to analyse scientific research results and the newest international experience in the area and to provide interoperability guidelines and recommendations for the implementation of appropriate Lithuanian state programmes. The learning content and repositories recommendations are designed for the implementation of the Lithuanian education portal project as well as Lithuanian Virtual University (LVU) programme’s information services’ (LABT / eLABa) and e-learning services’ (LieDM) <b>sub-programmes.</b> The whole education institution recommendations are designed for the maintenance and development of LVU programme’s management services’ (LieMSIS) system. Design/methodology/approach – methods used for the general analysis of proposed interoperability guidelines (reccomendations) were bibliographic research and comparative analysis of Lithuanian and foreign scientific works published in periodicals and large-scale EU-funded interoperability projects deliverables. System analysis and comparative analysis methods were used in order to formulate and analyse systems’ interoperability guidelines and recommendations. The author employed the experimental research method while working in the appropriate EU-funded interoperability projects to form the guidelines (recommendations). In order to summarize the results, the evaluative research method was used. Findings – the international guidelines and recommendations presented in the paper could be suitable for implementation while developing Lithuanian state education information systems such as the Lithuanian education portal, the Lithuanian academic libraries’ (eLABa) system, the Lithuanian distance learning system (LieDM), and the Lithuanian universities’ management system (LieMSIS). Research limitations/implications – the paper presents the author’s viewpoint on the probable implementation of several well-known international approaches, standards and specifications to improve interoperability of the different components of the LVU programme. Practical implications – the proper implementation of the proposed interoperability guidelines and recommendations could considerably improve the interoperability level of Lithuanian state e-learning management systems. Originality/Value – this type of analysis has been performed and recommendations have been applied to the LVU case study {{for the first time in}} scientific literature.
