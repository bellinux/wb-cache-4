40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{through a}} legal analysis of some articles of the Cote d’Ivoire <b>Stepping</b> <b>Stone</b> <b>Agreement,</b> how ECOWAS can strengthened its approach in negotiating a comprehensive EPA for the region. These articles are scrutinized {{with a special}} focus on market access as to point out fields {{that need to be}} re-thinked with regard objectives set out in the agreement. It is argue that current bilateral and multilateral Trade and Investment Agreements are shrinking in their legal framework the policy space need for development in countries that need it the most. This study, underlines the fact that the legal provisions contain in the Cote d’Ivoire IEPA do reduce actually its ability to set up policies tool aim at achieving development goals. It is the sustainability of the IEPA legal provisions that is questioned under this topic with regard to sensitive issues such as the safeguard measures, the stand still clause, the MFN clause, the Rules of Origin etc… [...] In so doing, the analysis reveals as well the ambiguity of the IEPA relationship with the Cotonou Agreement and the multilateral trade rules of the WTO. This ambiguity is highlighted in an attempt to drawn the attention of the region on the fact that; if there is indeed a need to update the Economic Partnership Agreement currently negotiating with the EC, this cannot be done without first of all updating the negotiating approach of the region. In fact, its weak bargaining approach coupled with that overwhelming of the EC has resulted in the agreement currently on the table. Substantial changes can be made with this regard by acknowledging the insufficiencies in the legal framework of the IEPA but also in learning lesson from mistakes the region itself and Cote d’Ivoire have done in negotiating EPAs and its Interim version. Thus, since EPAs often triggered the debate on liberalization and what it may carry in terms of consequences on developing countries’ economies, examples of countries that took a different step toward liberalization and whose current situation may be use as a testimony by ECOWAS are quoted. Finally, propositions are made to ECOWAS region as to enlarge current development space while battling for more flexibility under the EPA. Dissertation (LLM) [...] University of Pretoria, 2010.

40|$|AbstractThe way attackers execute attacks is incredible, they execute attacking {{commands}} form intermediate {{compromised host}} {{to remain anonymous}} instead from their own computers. These intermediate hosts are called as <b>stepping</b> <b>stone</b> host and attacks that attackers perform using <b>stepping</b> <b>stones</b> are called as <b>stepping</b> <b>stone</b> attacks. One {{solution to the problem}} of <b>stepping</b> <b>stone</b> attack is to detect <b>stepping</b> <b>stone</b> host so that we can break attacking path created and used by the attacker. In this paper, we propose a <b>stepping</b> <b>stone</b> detection approach which analyses the traffic flowing through the host to find out whether this is a <b>stepping</b> <b>stone</b> host or normal host. Our approach classifies traffic into two categories <b>Stepping</b> <b>Stone</b> Traffic and Normal Traffic using Neural Network. If the traffic flowing through the host belongs to the class of <b>stepping</b> <b>Stone</b> Traffic this indicates that host whose traffic is being tested is a <b>stepping</b> <b>stone</b> host otherwise it is a normal host. Our approach allows attacker to insert chaff packets and fixed delay, reshuffling of packet, padding, and encryption of attacking traffic...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} one of {{the issues}} that are not covered by current <b>stepping</b> <b>stone</b> detection based researches. Although dropped packet problems are well-known problem in real network environment, all of the <b>stepping</b> <b>stone</b> detection researches just assume that dropped packet problems do not occur. <b>Stepping</b> <b>stone</b> detection research already in complex condition where each enhancement of the research attempts to solve problem such as encryption, delay and chaff without focused to solve dropped packet issues. For that situation, this research believes that to make sure that dropped packet problem can be solved; it should begin from the beginning of the <b>stepping</b> <b>stone</b> research. In other words, to solve dropped packet problem, we must solve it at the early stage of <b>stepping</b> <b>stone</b> research without combine it with current complex condition of <b>stepping</b> <b>stone</b> research. For that purpose, experiment has been executed by using NS- 2 to prove the existence of the dropped packet in <b>stepping</b> <b>stone</b> detection environment.

40|$|Network based intruders seldom attack {{directly}} {{from their own}} hosts but rather stage their attacks through intermediate “stepping stones ” to conceal their identity and origin. To track down and apprehend those perpetrators behind <b>stepping</b> <b>stones,</b> it is critically important {{to be able to}} correlate connections through <b>stepping</b> <b>stones.</b> Tracing intruders behind <b>stepping</b> <b>stones</b> and correlating intrusion connections through <b>stepping</b> <b>stones</b> are challenging due to various readily available evasive countermeasures by intruders: • Installing and using backdoor relays (i. e. netcat) at intermediate <b>stepping</b> <b>stones</b> to evade logging of normal logins. • Using different types of connections (i. e. TCP, UDP) at different portions of the connection chain through <b>stepping</b> <b>stones</b> to complicate connection matching. • Using encrypted connections (with different keys) across <b>stepping</b> <b>stones</b> to defeat any content based comparison. • Introducing timing perturbation at intermediate <b>stepping</b> <b>stones</b> to counteract timing based correlation of encrypted connections.

40|$|Acoustic metronomes {{and visual}} targets {{have been used}} in {{rehabilitation}} practice to improve pathological gait. In addition, they may be instrumental in evaluating and training instantaneous gait adjustments. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the efficacy of two cue types in inducing gait adjustments, viz. acoustic temporal cues in the form of metronome beeps and visual spatial cues in the form of projected <b>stepping</b> <b>stones.</b> Twenty healthy elderly (aged 63. 2  ±  3. 6  years) were recruited to walk on an instrumented treadmill at preferred speed and cadence, paced by either metronome beeps or projected <b>stepping</b> <b>stones.</b> Gait adaptations were induced using two manipulations: by perturbing the sequence of cues and by imposing switches from one cueing type to the other. Responses to these manipulations were quantified in terms of step-length and step-time adjustments, the percentage correction achieved over subsequent steps, and the number of steps required to restore the relation between gait and the beeps or <b>stepping</b> <b>stones.</b> The results showed that perturbations in a sequence of <b>stepping</b> <b>stones</b> were overcome faster than those in a sequence of metronome beeps. In switching trials, switching from metronome beeps to <b>stepping</b> <b>stones</b> was achieved faster than vice versa, indicating that gait was influenced more strongly by the <b>stepping</b> <b>stones</b> than the metronome beeps. Together these results revealed that, in healthy elderly, the <b>stepping</b> <b>stones</b> induced gait adjustments more effectively than did the metronome beeps. Potential implications for the use of metronome beeps and <b>stepping</b> <b>stones</b> in gait rehabilitation practice are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Network-based {{intrusions}} {{have become}} {{a serious threat to}} the users of the In-ternet. To help cover their tracks, attackers launch attacks from a series of previously compromised systems called <b>stepping</b> <b>stones.</b> Timing correlations on incoming and outgoing packets can lead to detection of the <b>stepping</b> <b>stone</b> and can be used to trace the attacker through each link. Prior work has sought to counter the possibility of the attacker employing chaff packets and randomized delays. To date, however, researchers have not accounted for the full range of techniques that a sophisticated attacker could apply. In this work, we show that such an attacker could avoid detection by the best known <b>stepping</b> <b>stone</b> detection methods. We propose a simple buffering technique that could be used by an attacker on a <b>stepping</b> <b>stone</b> to evade detection. This technique makes the timing of packets in the output flow of the <b>stepping</b> <b>stone</b> entirely independent of the timing of packets from the input flow, thereby eliminating the timing link that makes existing <b>stepping</b> <b>stone</b> detection methods possible. To accomplish this, we only require buffering at the <b>stepping</b> <b>stone</b> and enough chaff packets to generate a constant rate flow. This traffic has the characteristics of a multimedia stream, such as Voice over IP (VoIP), which is quite common on the Internet to...|$|R

40|$|With {{habitat loss}} and {{fragmentation}} having become {{two of the}} major threats to the viability of species, {{the question of how}} to manage landscapes for species conservation has attracted much attention. In this context, the planning of <b>stepping</b> <b>stones</b> has been proposed to increase connectivity in fragmented landscapes. We present a simulation study with a neutral landscape approach to assess the effects of <b>stepping</b> <b>stones</b> on colonization success. To that end, we used a spatially explicit, calibrated population model of the European lynx (Lynx lynx) coupled with structured landscapes, in which we could control the landscape parameters of dispersal habitat coverage and contagion, as well as the number and size of <b>stepping</b> <b>stones</b> available for breeding. In general, we found that colonization success increased with increasing habitat coverage but decreased with increasing habitat contagion, while the introduction of <b>stepping</b> <b>stones</b> had significant effects in critical situations. Especially at low to medium dispersal habitat coverage and high disperser mortality, <b>stepping</b> <b>stones</b> had a positive effect on colonization success when they were large enough to produce new dispersers, but negative effects when they were small and located in a way that dispersers would be distracted from more suitable breeding habitat patches. The latter clearly constituted a shading effect and argues for a thorough consideration of the trade-offs related to <b>stepping</b> <b>stone</b> size and location when implementing <b>stepping</b> <b>stones</b> as a conservation measure, especially when the number of individuals of conservation concern is low...|$|R

40|$|Locating {{the real}} {{source of the}} Internet attacks {{has long been an}} {{important}} but difficult problem to be addressed. In the real world, attackers can easily hide their identities and evade punishment by relaying their attacks through a series of compromised systems or devices called <b>stepping</b> <b>stones.</b> Currently, researchers mainly use similar features from the network traffic, such as packet timestamps and frequencies, to detect <b>stepping</b> <b>stones.</b> However, these features can be easily destroyed by attackers using evasive techniques. In addition, it is also difficult to implement an appropriate threshold of similarity that can help justify the <b>stepping</b> <b>stones.</b> In order to counter these problems, in this paper, we introduce the consistent causality probability to detect the <b>stepping</b> <b>stones.</b> We formulate the ranges of abnormal causality probabilities according to the different network conditions, and on the basis of it, we further implement to self-adaptive methods to capture <b>stepping</b> <b>stones.</b> To evaluate our proposed detection methods, we adopt theoretic analysis and empirical studies, which demonstrate accuracy of the abnormal causality probability. Moreover, we compare our proposed methods with previous works. The result shows that our methods in this paper significantly outperform previous works in the accuracy of detection malicious <b>stepping</b> <b>stones,</b> even when evasive techniques are adopted by attackers...|$|R
