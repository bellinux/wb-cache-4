40|$|The {{particle}} number method {{based on the}} Particle Measurement Programme (PMP) {{is part of the}} light duty legislation and starts to expand to other sectors as well. As a consequence systems for in <b>service</b> <b>conformity</b> and random driving emissions procedures will be necessary. These systems should be small and compact. The commercial systems at the moment are not ready for on-road use because the Particle Number Counters (PNCs) sensors (condensation particle counters, CPC) are sensitive to vibrations. For this reason a different concept has been suggested: Diffusion chargers (DC). The main target of this report was to evaluate theoretically and experimentally in the lab various PN-PEMS using diffusion chargers as PNCs as alternative technique to the PMP method for on-road measurements. It was shown theoretically that DCs introduce an extra 50 % uncertainty due to a size dependency since the size is not known during a test; PMP systems should have < 15 % differences [...] Then various protottype PN-PEMS were evaluated in the lab. It was shown experimentally that it is feasible to cover a size range of 35 - 90 nm (for polydisperse aerosol) with differences within - 33 % and + 50 % to the PMP system. Based on the experience gained during the evaluations a suitable calibration setup and procedure is recommended. In addition calibration specifications {{for the next generation of}} PN-PEMS is given. JRC. F. 8 -Sustainable Transpor...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of three Portable Emission Measurement Systems (PEMS) for Particulate Matter (PM) was assessed in our laboratory against reference instrumentation in engine dynamometer testing of five Heavy Duty Engines (HDEs) of different aftertreatment technologies. The candidate systems were designed around the minimum requirements of allowing a gravimetric {{determination of the}} total emitted PM mass and incorporating a real time particle sensor. All PEMS-PM systems were found to reproduce within ± 30 % the gravimetric PM results determined with reference measurement systems under non-regenerative operating conditions, at emission levels lying at and above the Euro VI limit of 10 mg/kWh. The use of prolonged sampling times envisaged in In <b>Service</b> <b>Conformity</b> (ISC) testing (> 120 min) {{was found to be}} beneficial, as it reduced the limit of detection of the PEMS-PM instrumentation to 1 - 3 mg/kWh (120 min) from 3 to 9 mg/kWh (30 min). The real time aerosol instrumentation exhibited a much higher sensitivity, being capable of quantifying emission levels below the EURO VI particle number limit of 6 × 1011 #/kWh. Some modifications were required though in two particle sensors that were based on diffusion charging, in order to avoid a disproportional increase in their responses in the presence of homogeneously nucleated particles. Passive regeneration of the particulate filter resulted in excessive emission of volatile PM but also large discrepancies between the PEMS-PM and reference systems. The accurate quantification of absolute emission levels of non-volatile PM from the real time sensors can assist in the identification of such excessive volatile PM fractions, to avoid properly working DPF systems to fail an ISC test.

With the sample of 150 conventional bank customers of Micro, Small and Medium enterprise in Surabaya and cities surround, analysis is done. This analysis is conducted by descriptive analysis, factor, and multiple regressions using SPSS 18. Relational benefits are expected by micro enterprise is that the customer intimacy to contact personnel, and trust over quality, both factors are influencing satisfaction. For small enterprises, relational benefits expected are that customer intimacy to contact personnel and also <b>conformity</b> of <b>services</b> and priority.

40|$|Pediatricians play {{a crucial}} role in {{counseling}} adolescents about numerous aspects of health and well-being. Anticipatory guidance for this age group includes discussion of risk-taking behaviors; drug, tobacco, and alcohol use; depression and suicide; sexuality and safe sex practices; family planning and dynamics; eating disorders; and a wide variety of other health and developmentally related topics. 19 ̆ 64 Counseling this age group may also include issues related to planning for higher education and future vocation. I propose that anticipatory guidance of adolescents should also include discussion about military service and alternatives, the laws regarding registration (and consequences for failure to register) with the Selective Service System (SSS), and the medical and psychological effects of war. Specific developmental challenges face adolescents who opt for (United States) or are required to participate in (many other countries) military service. By late adolescence, individuals have usually developed the ability to think in abstract terms, plan for their future, and engage in independent life choices, 5 yet this age group still lacks full psychosocial maturation. Exposure to the demands of military <b>service</b> (absolute <b>conformity</b> and obedience, lack of independence, separation from family, real risk of physical harm) places unique stresses on adolescents in peacetime and even more so during times of war. 5 The purpose of this commentary is to raise awareness among pediatricians and other providers of adolescent health care about current SSS laws, possible changes to such laws that could occur at any time, and options available to adolescents who, by reason of conscience, choose not to participate in military service or perhaps even register with the SSS. To my knowledge, this topic is rarely if ever discussed in the context of anticipatory guidance of adolescents facing educational and career choices, and extensive search of the literature failed to reveal any references on this topic.

40|$|The study {{develops}} {{an approach}} that tries to validate software functionality to work systems needs in SMEs. The formulated approach is constructed by using a SAAS based software i. e., work collaboration service (WCS), and SMEs as the elements of study. Where the WCS’s functionality is qualified to the collaboration needs that exist in operational and project work within SMEs. For this research constructivist approach and case study method is selected because {{the nature of the}} current study requires an in depth study of the work collaboration service as well as a detailed study of the work systems within different enterprises. Four different companies are selected in which fourteen interviews are conducted to gather data pertaining. The work systems method and framework are used as a central part of the approach to collect, analyze and interpret the enterprises work systems model and the underlying collaboration needs on operational and project work. On the other hand, the functional model of the WCS and its functionality is determined from functional model analysis, software testing, documentation and meetings with the service vendor. The enterprise work system model and the WCS model are compared to reveal how work progression differs between the two and make visible unaddressed stages of work progression. The WCS functionality is compared to work systems collaboration needs to ascertain if the service will suffice the needs of the project and operational work under study. The unaddressed needs provide opportunities to improve the functionality of the <b>service</b> for better <b>conformity</b> to the needs of enterprise and work. The results revealed that the functional models actually differed in how operational and project work progressed within the stages. WCS shared similar stages of work progression apart from the stages of identification and acceptance, and progress and completion stages were only partially addressed. Conclusion is that the identified unaddressed needs such as, single point of reference, SLA and OLA inclusion etc., should be implemented or improved within the WCS at appropriate stages of work to gain better compliance of the service {{to the needs of the}} enterprise an work itself. The developed approach can hence be used to carry out similar analysis for the conformance of pre-built software functionality to work system needs with SMEs...|$|R
