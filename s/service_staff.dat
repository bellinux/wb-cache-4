With this collection of services and facilities, skyscrapers of the period were often referred to as small cities in their own right.|$|E

On 17 May the following year, McNicoll wed Frances Mary Chadwick, a journalist, in the Hampstead register office. Made acting rear admiral in January 1957, McNicoll was appointed as Head of the Australian Joint <b>Service</b> <b>Staff</b> in London. He returned to Australia in February 1958 and was selected to serve as Deputy Secretary (Military) at the Department of Defence; McNicoll's rank was made substantive in July that year.|$|E

40|$|Technical {{services}} {{departments in}} academic libraries have long struggled to com-municate effectively with other library departments, particularly public services departments. As academic libraries acquire {{large numbers of}} digital resources, technical services departments are increasingly responsible for providing current information about those resources to public <b>services</b> <b>staff.</b> The authors of this paper describe the process of creating, testing, and implementing LibGuides (pro-prietary software for building library portals and facilitating information sharing in libraries) as {{a new way of}} communicating much-needed information between technical services and public <b>services</b> <b>staff</b> at Miami University Libraries. Academic libraries now provide patrons with large numbers of electronic resources. As the number of resources grows, so does the potential number of breakdowns in access. This potential for problems means communication is vital between the technical <b>services</b> <b>staff</b> who manage these resources and the public <b>services</b> <b>staff</b> who interact with patrons.

25|$|With {{the influx}} of foreigners, the {{population}} of non-English speaking foreigners in Singapore offers new challenges {{to the concept of}} language proficiency in the country. Foreigners in Singapore constitute 36% of the population and they dominate 50% of Singapore's service sectors. Thus, {{it is not uncommon to}} encounter <b>service</b> <b>staff</b> who are not fluent in English, especially those who do not use English regularly. In response to this situation, the Straits Times reported that from July 2010, foreigners working in service sectors would have to pass an English test before they can obtain their work permits.|$|E

25|$|Big Sur is sparsely {{populated}} with about 1,000 year-round residents, {{according to the}} 2000 U.S. Census, {{about the same number}} of residents found there in 1900. Big Sur residents include descendants of the original ranching families, artists and writers, <b>service</b> <b>staff,</b> along with wealthy home-owners. These wealthy homeowners, however, are usually only part-time residents of Big Sur. The mountainous terrain, environmental restrictions imposed by the Big Sur Coastal Use Plan, and lack of property and the expense required to develop available land, have kept Big Sur relatively unspoiled. The economy is almost completely based on service industries associated with tourism.|$|E
25|$|Deregulation is {{generally}} regarded as the catalyst for yield management in the airline industry, but this tends to overlook the role of Global Distribution Systems (GDSs). It is arguable that the fixed pricing paradigm {{occurs as a result}} of decentralized consumption. With mass production, pricing became a centralized management activity and customer contact staff focused on customer service exclusively. Electronic commerce, of which the GDSs were the first wave, created an environment where large volumes of sales could be managed without large numbers of customer <b>service</b> <b>staff.</b> They also gave management staff direct access to price at time of consumption and rich data capture for future decision-making.|$|E
