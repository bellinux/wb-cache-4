50|$|Cultivated bananas are parthenocarpic, i.e. {{the flesh}} of the fruit swells and ripens without its seeds being fertilized and developing. Lacking viable <b>seeds,</b> <b>propagation</b> {{typically}} involves farmers removing and transplanting part of the underground stem (called a corm). Usually this is done by carefully removing a sucker (a vertical shoot that develops {{from the base of the}} banana pseudostem) with some roots intact. However, small sympodial corms, representing not yet elongated suckers, are easier to transplant and can be left out of the ground for up to two weeks; they require minimal care and can be shipped in bulk.|$|R
25|$|Commercial bonsai growers may {{use any of}} {{the other}} means of obtaining starter bonsai material, from <b>seed</b> <b>propagation</b> to {{collecting}} expeditions, but they generally sell mature specimens that display bonsai aesthetic qualities already. The grower trains the source specimens {{to a greater or lesser}} extent before sale, and the trees may be ready for display as soon as they are bought. Those who purchase commercially grown bonsai face some challenges, however, particularly of buying from another country. If the purchaser's local climate does not closely match the climate in which the bonsai was created, the plant will have difficulties surviving and thriving. As well, importing living plant material from a foreign source is often closely controlled by import regulations and may require a license or other special import arrangement on the buyer's part. If a local commercial bonsai grower does not exist, buying from a distant one may be unsatisfactory.|$|E
50|$|Although the Iris {{can produce}} plenty to <b>seed,</b> <b>propagation</b> via {{division}} is quicker and more reliable.|$|E
50|$|This plant strikes {{easily from}} tip cuttings. Alternatively, <b>seed</b> <b>propagation</b> is also successful. Seeds may {{be treated by}} very hot (but not boiling) water for two minutes.

5000|$|Jatropha curcas {{has limited}} natural {{vegetative}} propagation {{and is usually}} propagated by <b>seed.</b> <b>Propagation</b> through seed (sexual propagation) leads {{to a lot of}} genetic variability in terms of growth, biomass, seed yield and oil content. Low seed viability and the recalcitrant nature of oil seeds also limit <b>seed</b> <b>propagation.</b> However, clonal techniques can help in overcoming these problems that hinder mass propagation of this tree-borne oilseed species. Vegetative propagation has been achieved by stem cuttings, grafting, budding as well as by air layering techniques. [...] The investigation leads to the recommendation that cuttings should be taken preferably from juvenile plants and treated with 200 micro gram per litre of IBA (rooting hormone) to ensure the highest level of rooting in stem cuttings. These vegetative methods have potential for commercial propagation of these plants.|$|E

50|$|Less common, {{but just}} as effective, is {{propagation}} by semi-hardwood cuttings. Branches consisting of the current or last season's growth can be cut into 30 cm sections and planted in a moist potting mixture. This method is slower than <b>seed</b> <b>propagation</b> (cuttings take {{a few months to}} root) but is the preferred method for ensuring new trees are true to form. As such, cuttings are a particularly common method of propagation for the rarer yellow-flowering variety of the tree.|$|E
50|$|Xanthomonas {{species can}} be easily spread in water, {{movement}} of infected material such as <b>seed</b> or <b>propagation</b> plants, and by mechanical means such as infected pruning tools.

They inject a number of effector proteins, including TAL effectors, into the plant by their secretion systems (i.e., type III secretion system).|$|R
5000|$|Covering an {{original}} area of 233000 km2, {{it has now}} lost an estimated 97% of its habitat to logging, agriculture, and silviculture. [...] People also eat the fruit and <b>seeds,</b> which reduces <b>propagation.</b> It is therefore listed as critically endangered.|$|R
50|$|Cycads can be {{cut into}} pieces to make new plants, or by direct {{planting}} of the <b>seeds.</b> <b>Propagation</b> by <b>seeds</b> is the preferred method of growth, and two unique risks to their germination exist. One is that the seeds have no dormancy, so the embryo is biologically required to maintain growth and development, which means if the seed dries out, it dies. The second is that the emerging radicle and embryo can be very susceptible to fungal diseases in its early stages, when in unhygienic or excessively wet conditions. Thus, many cycad growers pregerminate the seeds in moist, sterile media such as vermiculite or perlite. However pregermination is not necessary, and many report success by directly planting the seeds in regular potting soil. As with many plants, a combination of well-drained soil, sunlight, water and nutrients will help it to prosper. Although, because of their hardy nature, cycads do not necessarily require the most tender or careful treatment, they can grow in almost any medium, including soilless ones. One {{of the most common}} causes of cycad death is from rotting stems and roots due to over-watering.|$|R
5000|$|... ‘’Endospermum medullosum’’ can be {{propagated}} from seeds {{as well as}} vegetative cuttings. With <b>seed</b> <b>propagation,</b> seeds {{should be}} collected quickly when they mature and planted within a few days. The seeds should be collected when the fruits go from dark green to light green. Usually 9,000-9,600 fruits produce 30,000-35,000 seeds. The species has low seed viability; therefore it is beneficial to raise the plant from cuttings. These cuttings are usually taken from hedges in misty conditions.|$|E
50|$|This plant {{thrives on}} well-drained soils and endures heat and windy {{conditions}} well. The species tolerates sandy {{as well as}} medium loam soils, and it can even thrive in nutrient deficient soil. This plant tolerates mildly acid to mildly alkaline soils, but it cannot grow in shady conditions. Propagation is by seed or by runners; {{in the case of}} <b>seed</b> <b>propagation</b> bee pollination is required of vicinity female trees growing near male trees. Lemonade berry grows very well in coastal exposures. The fruits are enjoyed by many bird species including the road-runner.|$|E
5000|$|Guillot Fils {{revolutionized}} {{the production of}} rose rootstocks {{through the use of}} <b>seed</b> <b>propagation,</b> rather than rooting cuttings. He created two new classes of roses, the hybrid tea and the polyantha. He created the first Tea rose with anything like a true yellow color, 'Mme. Hoste', which was later used as the pollen parent for the still-popular yellow tea rose 'Lady Hillingdon'. His pink Tea rose 'Catherine Mermet' was a popular florist rose in the late 19th Century. [...] His nursery is still in operation in the 21st Century, and still hybridizes new rose varieties.|$|E
30|$|This stage {{consists}} in finding initial skin samples, {{from which the}} proper <b>seeds</b> for <b>propagation</b> are later created. In our method, this is achieved exclusively based on the analysis of a skin probability map obtained using a global skin color model (we utilize the Bayesian classifier here; however, other skin color models may also be exploited for this purpose). The initial skin seeds are extracted relying on the skin probability histogram and by analyzing the pixels in the spatial domain.|$|R

Light pruning improves flowering and improves the shrub's shape. Plants may be propagated from <b>seed,</b> though <b>propagation</b> from semi-mature cuttings is preferred for cultivars to preserve flower colour and form. One attractive form has apricot-coloured flowers.|$|R

While the structure resembles those of carnivorous plants, the wineberry plant does not get nutrients from insects caught in the sap: the sticky mucilage contains no digestive enzymes, surrounding tissues cannot absorb nutrients, and there are no protein-storage tissues. Also, unlike carnivorous plants, wineberry grows in nutrient-rich soil, so it need not resort to insect proteins as a source of nitrogen.|$|E
50|$|Dendrobium pulchellum is {{a gentle}} flower that grows only in cold to clement temperatures, {{flowering}} {{only from the}} end of winter into spring. Dendrobium pulchellum can be acknowledged from its fairly large white flower petals with remnants of purple and yellow pigments.Seed germination of orchids is very important for the production of hybrids. Through the production of hybrids, orchids can endure genetic diversity. After numerous comparative findings, it was concluded that symbiotic protocorms developed more promptly over asymbiotic germination methods versus symbiotic approaches. Symbiotic seedlings could now inoculate soil with fungi that is highly beneficial for the soil. Nonetheless, fungal compatibility is a vital key-point for successful symbiotic seed germination; assessments of the soil to understand the specifics of the fungal species will give us {{a better understanding of the}} symbiotic <b>seed</b> <b>propagation.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Invasive species often exploit {{disturbances}} to {{an ecosystem}} (wildfires, roads, foot trails) to colonize an area.

In such circumstances plants that can regenerate from their roots have an advantage. Non-natives with this ability can benefit from a low intensity fire burns that removes surface vegetation, leaving natives that rely on <b>seeds</b> for <b>propagation</b> to find their niches occupied when their seeds finally sprout.|$|R
40|$|Sternbergia sicula (Tineo ex Guss), Amaryllidaceae, is a bulbous {{perennial}} plant {{native of}} Eastern Mediterranean countries growing in rocky areas 100 to 1000 m high. It bears bright yellow flowers in early autumn before leaves {{appear in a}} rosette form. It is an attractive plant with potential use in commercial floriculture mainly as a landscape plant. <b>Seed</b> <b>propagations</b> as well as tissue culture techniques were investigated {{in order to determine}} the most effective ways to propagate this species. Seed collected from native plants in Crete were sown in vitro and in vivo under different light and temperature conditions for 6 weeks. Germination percentage was highest at 15 °C in darkness while at 25 °C and light the seeds did not germinate. Best results were obtained if seeds were pretreated in wet vermiculite at 20 °C for 4 weeks. For the in vitro culture, 0. 5 × 0. 5 cm explants were taken from bulbs of 5 cm circumference and cultured in MS basal medium supplemented with several combinations of BA and NAA at 25 °C for 12 weeks. Each explant produced 3 - 4 bulblets with BA alone. After subculturing, more and bigger bulblets were produced which were then transferred to soil. The use of Sternbergia for ornamental use seems promising however further research is required for determining the optimum conditions for its growth and development...|$|R
