5|$|Another {{possible}} way {{to separate the}} trivalent actinides is via solvent extraction chromatography using bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (abbreviated as HDEHP) as the stationary organic phase and nitric acid as the mobile aqueous phase.

5|$|In mathematics, {{particularly}} {{algebraic topology}} and homology theory, the Mayer–Vietoris <b>sequence</b> <b>is</b> an algebraic tool to help compute algebraic invariants of topological spaces, known as their homology and cohomology groups. The result {{is due to}} two Austrian mathematicians, Walther Mayer and Leopold Vietoris. The method consists of splitting a space into subspaces, for which the homology or cohomology groups may be easier to compute. The sequence relates the (co)homology groups of the space to the (co)homology groups of the subspaces. It is a natural long exact sequence, whose entries are the (co)homology groups of the whole space, the direct sum of the (co)homology groups of the subspaces, and the (co)homology groups of {{the intersection of the}} subspaces.|$|E

5|$|Like the {{fundamental}} group or the higher homotopy groups of a space, homology groups are important topological invariants. Although some (co)homology theories are computable using tools of linear algebra, many other important (co)homology theories, especially singular (co)homology, are not computable directly from their definition for nontrivial spaces. For singular (co)homology, the singular (co)chains and (co)cycles groups are often {{too big to}} handle directly. More subtle and indirect approaches become necessary. The Mayer–Vietoris <b>sequence</b> <b>is</b> such an approach, giving partial information about the (co)homology groups of any space by relating it to the (co)homology groups of two of its subspaces and their intersection.|$|E
