5|$|The early {{light was}} {{obscured}} {{by a black}} cloud through which shone flashes, which Pliny likens to sheet lightning, but more extensive. The cloud obscured Point Misenum near at hand and the island of Capraia (Capri) across the bay.

A rain of ash fell, causing Pliny to shake it off periodically to avoid being buried.

5|$|Reconstructions of the {{eruption}} {{and its effects}} vary considerably in the details but have the same overall features. The eruption lasted two days. The morning {{of the first day}} was perceived as normal by the only eyewitness to leave a surviving document, Pliny the Younger. In {{the middle of the day}} an explosion threw up a high-altitude column from which ash and pumice began to fall, blanketing the area. Rescues and escapes occurred during this time. At some time in the night or early the next day pyroclastic surges in the close vicinity of the volcano began. Lights were seen on the peak interpreted as fires. People as far away as Misenum fled for their lives. The flows were rapid-moving, dense and very hot, knocking down wholly or partly all structures in their path, incinerating or suffocating all population remaining there and altering the landscape, including the coastline. These were accompanied by additional light tremors and a mild tsunami in the Bay of Naples. By late afternoon of the second day, {{the eruption}} was over, leaving only haze in the atmosphere through which the <b>sun</b> <b>shone</b> weakly.|$|E

25|$|During the summer, blinds were fitted {{over the}} ends of all cars with normal staircases, so that when it rained or the <b>sun</b> <b>shone</b> {{directly}} into the driver’s eyes he could pull down this blind and gain a little protection. These blinds were fitted because of complaints from drivers {{that they had no}} protection at all from the weather on cars of this type, whereas they did gain a little protection on those fitted with reversed stairs.|$|E

25|$|The early {{light was}} {{obscured}} {{by a black}} cloud through which shone flashes, which Pliny likens to sheet lightning, but more extensive. The cloud obscured Point Misenum near at hand and the island of Capraia (Capri) across the bay. Fearing for their lives the population began to call {{to each other and}} move back from the coast along the road. Pliny's mother requested him to abandon her and save his own life, as she was too corpulent and aged to go further, but seizing her hand he led her away as best he could. A rain of ash fell. Pliny found it necessary to shake off the ash periodically to avoid being buried. Later that same day the ash stopped falling and the <b>sun</b> <b>shone</b> weakly through the cloud, encouraging Pliny and his mother to return to their home and wait for news of Pliny the Elder. The letter compares the ash to a blanket of snow. Evidently the earthquake and tsunami damage at that location were not severe enough to prevent continued use of the home.|$|E
25|$|In Portugal, {{where the}} saint's day is celebrated across the country, {{it is common}} for {{families}} and friends to gather around the fire in reunions called magustos, where they typically eat roasted chestnuts and drink wine, jeropiga (drink made of grape must and firewater) and aguapé (a sort of weak and watered-down wine). According to the most widespread variation of the cloak story, Saint Martin cut off half of his cloak in order to offer it to a beggar and along the way, he gave the remaining part to a second beggar. As he faced a long ride in a freezing weather, the dark clouds cleared away and the <b>sun</b> <b>shone</b> so intensely that the frost melted away. Such weather was rare for early November, so was credited to God's intervention. The phenomenon of a sunny break to the chilly weather on Saint Martin's Day (11 November) is called Verão de São Martinho (Saint Martin's Summer, veranillo de san Martín in Spanish) in honor of the cloak legend.|$|E
25|$|The first {{representative}} {{match of}} the 1884 season {{was held at}} Lancashire's ground, Old Trafford, making it the first such match played there. The practice {{at the time was}} that the host ground authority would select the team. First Lancashire asked Lord Harris to captain the side, but he refused as he was unhappy about the proposed selection of John Crossland, a bowler, who many considered a thrower. So Lancashire chose their captain and hero, A N Hornby instead. In the end, Crossland did not play. Billy Murdoch's Australians had the better of a draw against A N Hornby's English eleven. The game was scheduled as a three-day match, but rain made no play possible on the first day. When England did get to bat at 12.05pm on the second day, they lost their captain in the third over, and Grace went when the score was on 13, before rain intervened yet again to delay play. After {{a quarter of an hour}} play resumed, as did the England collapse: at lunch, they were 83 for 6. The <b>sun</b> <b>shone</b> throughout the interval, making the wicket even more difficult to play. Harry Boyle finished on 6 for 42 and Fred Spofforth on 4 for 42, with England dismissed at around 3.10pm for only 95. The Australians fared better, making 86 for 2. Three quick wickets, the third of them being George Bonnor, who was reluctant to go after being driven back onto his stumps, saw the Aussies collapse to 97 for 5. But the innings recovered, and they finished on 182. England fared much better in their second innings: it took the Australians an hour and a quarter to make their first breakthrough, although Alfred Lucas was dropped when England had only notched up six. England reached parity with only 3 wickets down—and as it was then 4.40am on the last day, a draw was a virtual certainty. The game ended with England 180 for 9.|$|E

500|$|More {{recently}} Gallagher, Pyle, and Fell interpreted inscriptions in West Virginia as {{a description}} in Celtic Ogham alphabet of the supposed winter solstitial marker at the site. The controversial translation was supposedly validated by a problematic archaeoastronomical indication {{in which the}} winter solstice <b>sun</b> <b>shone</b> on an inscription of the sun at the site. Subsequent analyses criticized its cultural inappropriateness, {{as well as its}} linguistic and archeaoastronomical claims, to describe it as an example of [...] "cult archaeology".|$|E
500|$|A {{few days}} later William Wordsworth with his brother John and their friend Mr Simpson made a trip up Helvellyn, setting out after breakfast and {{returning}} home at ten that evening. A year later, in October 1801, William and his sister Dorothy rode to Legburthwaite (to the inn at Thirlspot) {{and then to the}} top of Helvellyn before returning the same way. Dorothy recorded that it had been a glorious day. They had mists both above and below them, but the <b>sun</b> <b>shone</b> through and their views extended from the Scottish mountains to the sea at Cartmel. Wordsworth’s poem, Inmate of a mountain dwelling (1816), celebrating the captivating power of the old mountain, was dedicated [...] "To … on her first ascent to the summit of Helvellyn." ...|$|E
500|$|Weather {{conditions}} {{on the day of}} the race were described as [...] "excessively cold" [...] with [...] "a smart breeze" [...] although [...] "the <b>sun</b> <b>shone</b> brilliantly." [...] Oxford won the toss and elected to start from the Middlesex station, handing the Surrey side of the river to Cambridge. [...] The Light Blues took an early lead but Oxford were soon level with them by the time they passed the Star and Garter pub. [...] With the steadier stroke, Oxford took the lead and were clear of Cambridge by Craven Cottage. [...] They extended their lead further, to such an extent that even though the Light Blue cox Richards made a spurt at the Soap Works, his boat had been surrounded by the steamers, and overtaken by one. [...] The disruption from steamers would become so severe that in the 1864 race, both boat club presidents threatened to postpone the race unless the steamers remained behind the two crews.|$|E

2500|$|Similar {{elements}} {{are present in}} Beckett's first published novel, Murphy (1938), which also explores the themes of insanity and chess (both {{of which would be}} recurrent elements in Beckett's later works). The novel's opening sentence hints at the somewhat pessimistic undertones and black humour that animate many of Beckett's works: [...] "The <b>sun</b> <b>shone,</b> having no alternative, on the nothing new". Watt, written while Beckett was in hiding in Roussillon during World War II, is similar in terms of themes but less exuberant in its style. It explores human movement {{as if it were a}} mathematical permutation, presaging Beckett's later preoccupation—in both his novels and dramatic works—with precise movement.|$|E
2500|$|The {{winter of}} 1946–47 in the United Kingdom was harsh with heavy snowfalls disrupting {{communication}} and supply {{for about six}} weeks from January to March. February {{was one of the}} coldest months on record and the winter culminated in the wettest March for 300 years. Yet it was followed by what Playfair called a [...] "glorious summer" [...] in which fine weather prevailed and, as Wisden says, [...] "the <b>sun</b> <b>shone</b> throughout". This was {{in sharp contrast to the}} wet summer of 1946. Despite austerity and rationing, the country was still in post-war euphoria and there was great enthusiasm for sporting events. As Wisden reports, [...] "crowds thronged the grounds (and) Lord's was often full for county games".|$|E

2500|$|Weather {{proved to}} be a {{hindrance}} to the production, and sometimes delayed shooting. Luckily, the <b>sun</b> <b>shone</b> {{during the first week of}} September 2012, which was also the first week of location shooting. But skies were partly or completely overcast for the remainder of the shoot. Additional location shooting occurred the last week of October and first week of November. The weather turned much colder, with heavy rain and gale-force winds these two weeks. Location shooting atop Harbour Cliff was scheduled for the first few days of November, but the weather created such safety concerns that this had to be cancelled. The production moved to Clevedon, and the clifftop filming was rescheduled for a few days later. (Luckily, the weather had cleared by then.) ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{a letter}} to readers {{published}} {{on the front page}} of the September 4, 2008, edition, Lipsky announced that the paper had suffered substantial losses and would [...] "cease publication at the end of September unless we succeed in our efforts to find additional financial backing." [...] In particular, the paper's existing backers would not put forward more money unless new backers with capital were found. The chance that funding had of materializing was negated by the rapid onset of the late-2000s financial crisis, and The Sun ceased publication on September 30, 2008. It had approximately 110 employees at that time, and also made use of many freelance writers. Mayor of New York Michael Bloomberg commented that [...] "The <b>Sun</b> <b>shone</b> brightly, though too briefly," [...] and that its writers were [...] "smart, thoughtful, provocative".|$|E
2500|$|The Third Test at Melbourne saw Australia win the toss and bat first. [...] They made 397 {{thanks to}} centuries by Alan Kippax [...] and Jack Ryder. [...] England scored 417 with 200 by Hammond and 58 by Sutcliffe. [...] Australia then scored 351 with 107 by their captain Bill Woodfull and a maiden Test century by Bradman. [...] This left England needing 332 to win. [...] Australia had ended the 5th day (it was a {{timeless}} match) on 347–8 and the pitch was showing increasing signs of wear. [...] Overnight, a storm broke and soaked the pitch which, as the <b>sun</b> <b>shone</b> on {{it through the}} morning, became what Bradman later described as [...] "the worst sticky I ever saw". [...] The Melbourne pitch was [...] "infamous as {{the worst in the}} world after rain and under a hot sun". [...] Even Wisden admitted that it [...] "may fittingly be described as a beastly wicket".|$|E
