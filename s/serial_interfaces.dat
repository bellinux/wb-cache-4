25|$|The key {{parameters}} of SPI adapters are: the maximum supported frequency for the serial interface, command-to-command latency and the maximum length for SPI commands.

25|$|Both the HD and SD <b>serial</b> <b>interfaces</b> {{provide for}} 16 {{channels}} of embedded audio. The two interfaces use different audio encapsulation methods— SD uses the SMPTE 272M standard, whereas HD uses the SMPTE 299M standard. In either case, an SDI signal may contain up to sixteen audio channels (8 pairs) embedded 48kHz, 24-bit audio channels {{along with the}} video. Typically, 48kHz, 24-bit (20-bit in SD, but extendable to 24 bit) PCM audio is stored, in a manner directly compatible with the AES3 digital audio interface. These are placed in the (horizontal) blanking periods, when the SDI signal carries nothing useful, since the receiver generates its own blanking signals from the TRS.|$|E
50|$|Starting in {{the late}} 1980s, driven by the volume of IBM {{compatible}} PCs, HDDs became routinely available pre-formatted with a compatible low-level format. At the same time, the industry moved from historical (dumb) bit <b>serial</b> <b>interfaces</b> to modern (intelligent) bit <b>serial</b> <b>interfaces</b> and word <b>serial</b> <b>interfaces</b> wherein the low level format was performed at the factory.|$|E

5000|$|Recent {{physical}} {{versions of}} SCSISerial Attached SCSI (SAS), SCSI-over-Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP), and USB Attached SCSI (UAS)break {{from the traditional}} parallel SCSI standards and perform data transfer via serial communications. Although much of the SCSI documentation talks about the parallel interface, all modern development efforts use <b>serial</b> <b>interfaces.</b> <b>Serial</b> <b>interfaces</b> {{have a number of}} advantages over parallel SCSI, including higher data rates, simplified cabling, longer reach, and improved fault isolation. The primary reason for the shift to <b>serial</b> <b>interfaces</b> is the clock skew issue of high speed parallel interfaces, which makes the faster variants of parallel SCSI susceptible to problems caused by cabling and termination. [...] iSCSI preserves the basic SCSI paradigm, especially the command set, almost unchanged, through embedding of SCSI-3 over TCP/IP, predominantly on Ethernet which is also of serial nature.|$|E
