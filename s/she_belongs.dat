25|$|Mrs. Norval compromises her beliefs {{when she}} realizes {{the immensity of}} Lola's wealth. When she hears the news of her husband's death in Egypt, she enters a clandestine {{marriage}} with Mr. Hackwell, yielding to his advances even though she {{claims to be a}} chaste woman. The couple spends Lola's wealth extravagantly as Mr. Sinclair, who was entrusted with the bulk of Lola's wealth, sends them a monthly allowance intended for Lola. Mrs. Norval uses it to advance her family's social standing in the hopes of finding wealthier, more suitable matches for her daughters. She therefore embodies the idea of Manifest Destiny. She spends Lola's money as if it were hers, since she believes <b>she</b> <b>belongs</b> to the superior race. Lola's wealth corrupts her until she succumbs to brain fever.|$|E
25|$|Somalis are ethnically of Hamitic ancestry, {{but have}} genealogical beliefs that they descend {{from one of}} various Arabian patriarchs {{associated}} with the spread of Islam. They are segmented into various clan groupings, which are important kinship units that play a central part in Somali culture and politics. Clan families are patrilineal, and are divided into clans, primary lineages or subclans, and dia-paying kinship groups. The lineage terms qabiil, qolo, jilib and reer are often interchangeably used to indicate the different segmentation levels. The clan represents the highest kinship level. It owns territorial properties and is typically led by a clan-head or Sultan. Primary lineages are immediately descended from the clans, and are exogamous political units with no formally installed leader. They comprise the segmentation level that an individual usually indicates he or <b>she</b> <b>belongs</b> to, with their founding patriarch reckoned to between six and ten generations.|$|E
25|$|As {{concrete}} instances Dumézil {{makes that}} of Vedic goddess Sarasvatī and Avestic Anāhīta. Sarasvati as river goddess is first a goddess {{of the third}} function, of vitality and fertility associated to the deities of the third function as the Aśvin and of propagation as Sinīvalī. She is the mother and on her rely all vital forces. But {{at the same time}} <b>she</b> <b>belongs</b> to the first function as a religious sovereign: she is pure, she is the means of purifications and helps the conceiving and realisation of pious thoughts. Lastly she is also a warrior: allied with the Maruts she annihilates the enemies and, sole among female goddesses, bears the epithet of the warrior god Indra, vṛtraghnỉ, destroyer of oppositions. She is the common spouse of all the heroes of the Mahābhārata, sons and heirs of the Vedic gods Dharma, Vāyu, Indra and of the Aśvin twins. Though in hymns and rites her threefold nature is never expressed conjointly (except in Ṛg Veda VI 61, 12:: triṣadásthā having three seats).|$|E

25|$|However, in 1882 R. Mowat {{published}} an inscription in which Fortuna is called daughter of Jupiter, raising new questions and opening new perspectives in {{the theology of}} Latin gods. Dumézil has elaborated an interpretative theory according to which this aporia would be an intrinsic, fundamental feature of Indoeuropean deities of the primordial and sovereign level, as it finds a parallel in Vedic religion. The contradiction would put Fortuna both at the origin of time and into its ensuing diachronic process: it is the comparison offered by Vedic deity Aditi, the Not-Bound or Enemy of Bondage, that shows {{that there is no}} question of choosing one of the two apparent options: as the mother of the Aditya she has the same type of relationship with one of his sons, Dakṣa, the minor sovereign who represents the Creative Energy, being at the same time his mother and daughter, as is true for the whole group of sovereign gods to which <b>she</b> <b>belongs.</b> Moreover, Aditi is thus one of the heirs (along with Savitr) of the opening god of the Indoiranians, as she is represented with her head on her two sides, with the two faces looking opposite directions. The mother of the sovereign gods has thence two solidal but distinct modalities of duplicity, i.e. of having two foreheads and a double position in the genealogy. Angelo Brelich has interpreted this theology as the basic opposition between the primordial absence of order (chaos) and the organisation of the cosmos.|$|E

[...] An orthodox academic view still places Tamar's grave at Gelati, but a series of archaeological studies, beginning with Taqaishvili in 1920, has failed to locate it at the monastery.|$|E

[...] After a standoff, Daniel and Charlotte convince Juliet {{that they are not}} going to kill anyone; they are neutralizing the gas in case Ben decides to use it again, as he had twelve years earlier in an Others-led purge of Dharma.
