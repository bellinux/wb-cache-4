5000|$|When {{considering}} torque, {{the question}} of using dynamic or <b>static</b> <b>torque</b> for the application is key. For example, if a machine is running at a relatively low rpm (5-50 depending upon size) then dynamic torque is not a consideration since the <b>static</b> <b>torque</b> rating of the coupling will come closest to where the application is running. However, if a machine is running at 3,000rpm and the same full torque is required the result {{will not be the}} same because of the difference between static and dynamic torques. Almost all manufacturers put the static rated torque for their couplings in their catalog. If a specific response time is needed, the dynamic torque rating for a particular coupling at a given speed is required. In many cases, this can be significantly lower. Sometimes it can be less than ½ of the <b>static</b> <b>torque</b> rating. Most manufacturers publish torque curves showing the relationship between dynamic and <b>static</b> <b>torque</b> for a given series of couplings. (T-1) ...|$|E

Previous work on low-mass planets generally kept the planet {{on a fixed}} orbit, after which the torque on the planet was measured. In addition to these <b>static</b> <b>torques,</b> when the planet is allowed to migrate it experiences dynamical torques, which are proportional to the migration rate and whose sign depends on the background vortensity gradient. We show that in discs a few times more massive than the Minimum Mass Solar Nebula, these dynamical torques can have {{a profound impact on}} planet migration. Inward migration can be slowed down significantly, and if <b>static</b> <b>torques</b> lead to outward migration, dynamical torques can take over, taking the planet beyond zero-torque lines set by saturation of the corotation torque in a runaway fashion. This means the region in non-isothermal discs where outward migration is possible can be larger than what would be concluded from <b>static</b> <b>torques</b> alone.

This power, in turn, depends mainly on the mechanical torque required at the gearbox of the pumping unit. Thus, proper calculation of gearbox torques during the pumping cycle is crucial for determining the power requirements and operating costs of sucker-rod pumping. Torques on the crankshaft of the gearbox are classified as <b>static</b> <b>torques</b> required to move the polished rod and the counterweights, and inertial torques representing the energy stored in and released from the accelerating/decelerating parts of the pumping unit (Takacs 2003).|$|R

In this paper, a SRM with wedges is compared to the conventional one including some static and dynamic features.

5000|$|While the {{standard}} (Type 1 or T1) Torsen supports a <b>static</b> <b>torque</b> ratio of 50:50; i.e., input torque is supported equally across both output shafts, the T1 has a Torque Bias Ratio (TBR) of 2.7-4:1; i.e., it allows about 3 to 4 times the torque {{to be supplied}} to the most tractive output shaft than that {{is available on the}} least tractive shaft or, a torque split of between 25% to 75%. However, by nature the T1 Torsen is locked under most circumstances (output shafts locked together). Only when the TBR is reached (i.e., there is a greater torque difference across the output shafts than can be supported by the TBR) do the output shafts turn relative to each other, and the differential unlocks. This characteristic results in a relatively free torque movement between both outputs of the (centre) differential, within the limits of the TBR. Thus the <b>static</b> <b>torque</b> distribution of the T1 Torsen in a centre differential installation, rather than being 50:50, will mirror the weight distribution (both static and dynamic) of the vehicle due to the traction available at either (front:rear) output shaft. In a standard car, this is desirable from the perspective of stability, acceleration and traction, but can be undesirable in terms of handling (understeer). While {{the standard}} quattro Torsen T1 with 2.7:1 TBR is more than sufficient in most conditions, Torsen T1 differentials with higher TBRs (4:1) are available and can further limit understeer by supporting a wider torque split. A better solution, however, is to apportion a torque split directly between both output shafts (front & rear) and for this reason Audi has adopted the Type 3 (T3) Torsen design in the latest generations of quattro.|$|E

Coordination ability, one of the abilities that determine the repeatability of accurate shooting, is based on kinesthetic differentiation. The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate the strength component of kinesthetic differentiation ability and determine its relationship with shooting accuracy. Methods. Peak muscle torque of the elbow extensors under static conditions was measured in 12 young basketball players. Participants then reproduced the same movement at a perceived magnitude of 25 %, 50 %, and 75 % of <b>static</b> peak <b>torque,</b> with error scores calculated as a measure of kinesthetic differentiation.

No statistically significant relationships were found between the level of kinesthetic differentiation ability and field goal percentage.

The relatively high levels of elbow <b>static</b> peak <b>torque</b> suggest the importance of upper limb strength in contemporary basketball. The lack of a statistically significant difference between the right and left limbs decreases the risk of suffering injury.

In order to maintain or even enhance the machine performance while achieving high fault tolerant capability, novel modular, single layer winding switched reluctance machines (SRMs) with different pole numbers are proposed, which are supplied by rectangular wave current with different conduction angles. The influences of the pole number and flux gap width between E-core segmented stators on the electromagnetic performance have been investigated in terms of self- and mutual inductances, electromagnetic torque, copper loss, iron loss, and radial force.

40|$|Over {{the years}} an {{increasing}} {{attention has been}} devoted to ergonomic analyses even from the early stage of the design process. Ergonomic and human factor evaluations often require building a physical mock-up in order to provide an assessment of discomfort and ease of use. This process, using traditional methods, is very time demanding, especially when the design has to be modified and revalidated. Digital mock-up instead, enables manu- facturers to design digital prototypes of a product in full details, simulating its functions and predicting interaction among its different components. In order to take advantage of digital simulation to conduct ergonomic assessments digital substitutes of human beings (also called digital humans), able to interact with the digital mock-up in simulation environment, are required. Since these digital humans are required to simulate human beings in digital environments their resulting movements must be as human-like as possible. Although these digital human simulation tools are now advanced enough to correctly predict human-product and human-process interaction, even before a physical prototype is constructed, the animation process is still very time demanding, mainly because it still relies on key frame techniques. Moreover, the accuracy of the resulting simulations are strongly related to the experience of the operator. The aim of this thesis has been to develop an algorithm capable of speeding up the animation process of digital humans. An algorithm capable of conducting biomechanical analyses has been developed as well. Chapter 1 provides a general introduction underlining the need to use digital human simulation tools from the early stage of the design process. The main applications of digital technologies in industrial world are presented as well. Chapter 2 provides an overview of the the main digital human simulation tools currently available, highlighting their advantages and disadvantages. Chapter 3 describes the mathematical theory underlying the developed HuPOSE model. Both the kinematic and the biomechanical model are presented. The main contribution is the formulation of the inverse kinematic problem in terms of a single CLIK algorithm, using an Augmented Jacobian matrix. This approach suggested also the possibility of computing the <b>static</b> <b>torques</b> at the joints of a digital human by means of kineto-static duality. The computation of the <b>static</b> <b>torques</b> allowed to conduct a biomechanical analysis, in reference to a load-lifting task, very easily.
