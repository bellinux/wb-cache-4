25|$|Parnok's {{last great}} love was the Georgian physicist, Nina Vedeneyeva. The two may have met {{as early as}} 1927, through Tsuberbiller, a {{colleague}} of Vedeneyeva. Vedeneyeva's son, Yevgeny, was living in exile {{at that time and}} Tsuberbiller, who had written a textbook used for decades in the high schools of Russia, helped her obtain books for him to maintain his studies. In January, 1932, the relationship turned to romance, despite the facts that Parnok was still living with Tsuberbiller and Yevgeny disapproved of the relationship. As had happened before, her lover became her muse, inspiring her to write two cycles of poems, Ursa Major and Useless Goods. The frantic pace of her writing foretold the exhaustion she would suffer, which hastened her death, but Parnok was aware of the consequences. The references between these last two cycles and Parnok's adolescent poetry, make it clear that she had always known what <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> but until she reached her maturity, she {{did not know how to}} express her words. Their emotional bond, which accelerated after a trip to Vedeneyeva's summer cottage in Kashin in April, was destined to remain hidden from most of Vedeneyeva's family and friends. To keep up appearance of a mere friendship, they spent their summers apart.|$|E
500|$|Josh Taylor of Jesus Freak Hideout said, [...] "the way {{in which}} [...] {{continually}} addresses Britney Spears just seems the least bit odd", but commented on how pleasant the song is. A review by Idolator noticed [...] "Britney" [...] has [...] "a melody that dares to be clear and pretty in ways emo bands [...] don’t usually dare," [...] and commented how the song's [...] "strongly sung" [...] lyrics are [...] "sweet [...] not cynical at all." [...] The Denver Post reported that after the song's release, Spears' mother Lynne thanked Norman for writing the song, [...] "because it was all <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> to her daughter." [...] On the week of September 19, 2008, [...] "Britney" [...] peaked at number twenty-eight on Billboard Hot Christian Adult Contemporary chart.|$|E
500|$|After the {{completion}} of filming A League of Their Own, Madonna began working on her fifth studio album Erotica with Shep Pettibone. [...] "Rain" [...] {{was one of the}} first songs developed for the album, alongside [...] "Deeper and Deeper", [...] "Erotica", and [...] "Thief of Hearts", during the writing session in October and November 1991. According to Pettibone, these songs were essentially Madonna's stories and the things <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> [...] "Rain" [...] was written and produced together by Madonna and Pettibone. She had initially written the song for a musical version to be directed by Alek Keshishian based on the 1939 film, Wuthering Heights. Pettibone also sequenced, programmed, and played keyboards for the song. The recording process was engineered by P. Dennis Mitchell and Robin Hancock, while the mixing was engineered by Goh Hotoda. Another musician involved was Tony Shimkin, who provided the drum programming.|$|E

500|$|When Jam and Lewis {{agreed to}} produce Jackson's third studio album, {{they wanted to}} appeal {{primarily}} to the African American community, in addition to achieving crossover success on the pop music charts. Jam commented {{in an interview with}} Rolling Stone magazine, [...] "We wanted to do an album that would be in every black home in America... we were going for the black album of all time." [...] Before their association with Jackson, Jam and Lewis had originally planned to record an album with tracks they wrote for Sharon Bryant, but she found their lyrics and sound to be too [...] "rambunctious". The duo presented the same set of recordings to Jackson, who gave her input and took co-writing and co-production credits for the album's content. Jam and Lewis recalled that in order to collaborate with Jackson on the material, they spent the first week simply getting to know their new client. Lewis explained, [...] "We got into her head. We saw what she was capable of, what <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> where she wanted to be, what she wanted to be. We put together some songs to fit her as we saw her, as she revealed herself to us. It was as simple as that." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August, a re-routed tour {{schedule}} was announced {{with a greater}} emphasis on Canadian dates, where Taking the Long Way had gone five-times-platinum. The tour's shows themselves generally refrained from any explicit verbal political comments, letting the music, especially the central performance of [...] "Not Ready to Make Nice" [...] (which typically received a thunderous ovation during and after the song), speak for itself. [...] As part of the tour, the Dixie Chicks became the first major band to hire a designated blogger [...] "all-access" [...] to keep up with them in their promotional activities and tour. [...] When the Chicks performed again at Shepherds Bush Empire, site of [...] "The Incident", Maines joked that <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> something the audience hadn't heard before, but instead said, [...] "Just so y'all know, we're ashamed the President of the United States is from Texas," [...] to much laughter and applause.|$|E
2500|$|Adele later {{collaborated with}} famed {{musician}} and producer Dan Wilson to write [...] "Someone like You" [...] {{which was one}} of the final songs composed for the album. Prior to meeting with Wilson, Adele said she wrote some of the lyrics using her acoustic guitar. The two sat around the piano for two days and brainstormed various melodies and lyrics, and ultimately decided to keep the musical production sparse: [...] "We just wrote it on the piano and then we recorded it when it was written. It wasn't sort of like recording it and listening to it thinking 'where can we go next?' It was really old school." [...] During an interview with Billboard, Wilson stated that while writing the song, they wanted to make it as personal as possible. He added [...] "We didn't try to make it open-ended so it could apply to 'anybody.' We tried to make it as personal as possible. She may not have had a melodic hook or a specific lyrical idea, but she always knew what <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> She definitely had a master plan." [...] The song was recorded at Harmony Studios in West Hollywood, California with Wilson playing piano. Philip Allen engineered in the studio. The mixing was done by Tom Elmhirst and Dan Parry while the mastering was finished by Tom Coyne.|$|E
