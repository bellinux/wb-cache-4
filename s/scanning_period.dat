Due to its spatially resolved limit on detecting small inhomogeneities of dopants or composition changes, we here propose a constructive combination of numerical modeling and practical measurement to improve the spatial resolution by deconvolution algorithm. The relevant transfer function, obtained from numerical calculations, was successfully applied on real measurement data. Besides, an improvement in detecting the 1. 5 µm inhomogeneity has been achieved by applying one transfer function of the known tip setup {{on a set of}} Seebeck line scan signals, obtained with 6 µm tip-sample contact length, 3 µs signal capture time after contact, and 0. 75 µm <b>scan</b> <b>period.</b> The result showed that a system theoretical approach in terms of deconvolution algorithm could theoretically enhance the spatial resolution anyway, but is practically limited by the systemic preconditions (tip size, signal capture time, and <b>scan</b> <b>period)</b> and the signal to noise ratio of the captured thermovoltages. Therefore, we provide a clear understanding of systemic preconditions and their impacts on the detection of small inhomogeneities and thus the performance in the thermopower analysis...|$|R

40|$|In {{electronic}} support, receivers {{must maintain}} surveillance over the very wide {{portion of the}} electromagnetic spectrum in which threat emitters operate. A common approach is to use a receiver with a relatively narrow bandwidth that sweeps its centre frequency over the threat bandwidth to search for emitters. The sequence and timing of changes in the centre frequency constitute a search strategy. The search can be expedited, if there is intelligence about the operational parameters of the emitters that are likely to be found. However, it can happen that the intelligence is deficient, untrustworthy or absent. In this case, what is the best search strategy to use? A random search strategy based on a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) is proposed. When the search is conducted for emitters with a periodic scan, it is shown that there is an optimal configuration for the CTMC. It is optimal {{in the sense that the}} expected time to intercept an emitter approaches linearity most quickly with respect to the emitter 2 ̆ 7 s <b>scan</b> <b>period.</b> A fast and smooth approach to linearity is important, as other strategies can exhibit considerable and abrupt variations in the intercept time as a function of <b>scan</b> <b>period.</b> In theory and numerical examples, the optimum CTMC strategy is compared with other strategies to demonstrate its superior properties...|$|R
