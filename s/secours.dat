5|$|The {{government}} sponsored numerous {{initiatives aimed}} at improving conditions or achieving repatriation. At {{the request of the}} Vichy government, Georges Scapini, a deputy and World War I veteran, was appointed to lead a committee to monitor the treatment of French prisoners in Germany. Scapini's Service Diplomatique des Prisonniers de Guerre (Diplomatic Service of Prisoners of War; SDPG) was given responsibility to negotiate with the German authorities in all matters concerning prisoners of war. A government-backed national fund-raising campaign was run by the <b>Secours</b> National (National Aid) for the benefit of French prisoners. Among other activities, the <b>Secours</b> ran a week-long campaign nationally in 1941.|$|E

50|$|The Bon <b>Secour</b> National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) is {{not really}} located in Bon <b>Secour,</b> but nearby, along Ft. Morgan Road, on the island, over the Intracoastal Waterway bridge. The Bon <b>Secour</b> NWR {{consists}} of over 6700 acre of wildlife habitat lying directly west of Gulf Shores, Alabama, on the Fort Morgan peninsula (western sliver of the island) formed by the Intracoastal Waterway, Oyster Bay, Bon <b>Secour</b> Bay, and Mobile Bay. The refuge was established by the United States Congress in 1980 to provide habitat for non-game birds migrating south {{in the fall and}} north in the spring. The migration paths from Bon <b>Secour</b> lead south to lower Florida, the Caribbean, Mexico and Central America. The Bon <b>Secour</b> refuge also serves as one of the largest undeveloped parcels of land on the Alabama coast, with sand dunes which are a reminder of the Gulf Coast, as it formerly existed. Consequently, the Bon <b>Secour</b> National Wildlife Refuge has been named among the ten natural wonders of Alabama. It has become a birding Mecca.|$|R
50|$|Bon <b>Secour</b> is {{characterized}} by a coastal, Southern Gothic scenery with huge water oak trees covered in Spanish moss, great blue herons, brown pelicans, ever present bottle-nosed dolphin pods and the potent smell of salty gulf waters everywhere. The local commercial fisherman that make their living from the Gulf are no less salty but also friendly. Other than the relatively small, family owned, seafood processing plants, Bon <b>Secour</b> is primarily made up of many rural neighborhoods, most of which enjoy beautiful vistas of the Bon <b>Secour</b> River and Bon <b>Secour</b> Bay. Brown Pelicans are everywhere and locals often see alligators from time to time, plying the waters of the estuarial system from the head waters of the Bon <b>Secour</b> River to the bay. One can see baby bottle-nosed dolphins playing near the mouth of the river at any time. In Bon <b>Secour</b> one can catch bass, bream, fresh-water catfish, then travel a few miles down river, to the bay and catch all manner of salt water fish, shrimp, and oysters in the same day.|$|R
5|$|The Committee was {{established}} in September 1914, shortly after the German army occupied Brussels, under the name Comité Central de <b>Secours</b> et d'Alimentation ("Central Relief and Food Committee").

5|$|Born {{into the}} nobility, de Bourgoing was educated at court and married an {{artillery}} officer, Joseph Fortoul. Widowed, after raising her children, de Bourgoing chose {{the field of}} nursing {{as a means of}} helping alleviate poverty and participated in the first formal nursing classes offered in Paris. After she began working as a nurse, she went abroad with the Société de <b>Secours</b> aux Blessés Militaires, a forerunner of the French Red Cross, to work in North Africa. In 1907, she joined the SSBM and that same year, travelled to Morocco, where she established an infirmary in Casablanca. Fifteen months later, she assisted in disaster relief following an earthquake in Sicily.|$|E

5|$|In the 1980s, Van Dormael {{produced}} {{a number of}} short films. While {{he was a student}} at the INSAS, he wrote and directed the children's story Maedeli la brèche. The short film received the Honorary Foreign Film Award at the 1981 Student Academy Awards presented by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. The following year Van Dormael directed Stade 81, a documentary short film about the Paralympic Games. He later directed the short films Les voisins (1981), L'imitateur (1982), Sortie de <b>secours</b> (1983), and De boot (1985). His most famous short of the period is È pericoloso sporgersi (1984) which won the Grand Prix in international competition at the Clermont-Ferrand International Short Film Festival.|$|E
5|$|After the storm, the United Nations Disaster Management Team (UNDMT) {{assisted}} the Conseil National de <b>Secours</b> (CNS) in Madagascar with surveying areas affected by Hudah. The UNDMT also appealed for relief materials {{for at least}} 50,000–100,000people. Two light helicopters in Mahajanga and Sambava were dispatched to support two planes in providing assistance to affected populations. Médecins Sans Frontières(MSF) also provided food and medical aid. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) served as a channel for donations to relief efforts, and also made available US$50,000from the United Kingdom's Department for International Development(DFID) for immediate relief purposes. Although the Red Cross had appealed for relief materials for Madagascar before Hudah had hit, these materials would arrive in April, assisting residents affected by Hudah and serving as a backbone for a long-term rehabilitation plan. Due to inclement weather, surveys by humanitarian organizations on the island were not conducted until April4, a full two days after Hudah first struck the island. A Malagasy aircraft delived 6tonnes (6.6metric tons) of rice along with packages of other various supplies to affected regions. The CNS planned to deliver 10tonnes (11short tons) of rice to Antalaha. Although initial reports indicated that 24people were killed due to Hudah, later reports raised the death toll in Madagascar to 111.|$|E
5|$|In 1901, on {{receiving}} her diploma, de Bourgoing {{joined the}} Société de <b>Secours</b> aux Blessés Militaires (SSBM), forerunner of the French Red Cross, {{as a volunteer}} and began working at the Beaujon Hospital in Paris. As {{a result of her}} competence and the understanding she showed both patients and doctors, she was appointed president of the SSBM. In 1907, she sailed for Morocco with the French expeditionary force under General Antoine Marius Benoît Drude. As head of a team of SSBM volunteers, she established an infirmary in Casablanca, treating the wounded in the conflicts between the French and Moroccans. As conditions were difficult in Morocco, it was decided the wounded and seriously ill should be transported to Oran in Algeria where {{it would be easier to}} provide proper treatment. It was in October 1907 while she and two of her nurses were accompanying the wounded on a French naval crossing to Oran, that she first met General Hubert Lyautey, who was division commander there. After spending fifteen months in North Africa, she returned to France, only to leave shortly afterwards for the Italian port Messina in December where she and her nursing team helped care for the 80,000 victims of the 1908 earthquake. As a result of their exemplary services, they were decorated by Princess Hélène of Orléans.|$|E

Bon <b>Secour</b> is over 35 mi due east of the Alabama - Mississippi state line, near Gulf Shores, and over 45 mi west of Pensacola, Florida. The name [...] "Bon Secour" [...] derives from the French phrase meaning [...] "safe harbor" [...] due to the secluded location on the inside coast of the Fort Morgan peninsula of southern Alabama.|$|R

5000|$|Bon <b>Secour</b> has a rich history. It was {{originally}} a French fishing village settlement {{dating back to}} the late 19th century. Currently it is a Southern Gothic, waterfront community that serves as a safe harbor to a current commercial fishing fleet. Named by Jacques Cook, a French Canadian from Montreal, a member of Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville's colonizing expedition of 1699. He was a participant in the founding of Mobile in 1702. There are several major seafood industry businesses currently operating out of the Bon <b>Secour</b> estuary. Bon <b>Secour</b> Fisheries, Safe Harbor Seafood, Aquilla Seafood and Billy's Seafood all ship large quantities of Gulf of Mexico seafood to all areas of the United States. Bon <b>Secour</b> Fisheries is the oldest and biggest of them all, having been operating since the 1890s. The primary catch for the Bon <b>Secour</b> fishing fleet ranges from Mobile Bay shrimp to deep water [...] "Royal Red" [...] shrimp. Large shrimp boats line the shores of the Bon <b>Secour</b> River, docked at processing plants for packaging and shipment to all of America. One main point of pride within the community is the [...] "Alabama Wild Shrimp Program". Because wild shrimp caught by the local fleet must compete with farmed shrimp from overseas, economic pressures have driven many, multi-generational shimpers out of the business. As a result, the local shimpers, along with shrimpers out of the Mobile area have formed an alliance, increased their marketing, public relations knowledge and efforts to brand Alabama, Wild Caught Shrimp. Their efforts have paid off. Marine science has indeed proven that wild-caught shrimp from local waters are in fact less likely to contain contaminates than the farm-raised shrimp that have been imported from other countries. Still, the commercial shrimping industry in Bon <b>Secour</b> is hanging on by a very thin line.|$|R

50|$|Homes in the Bon <b>Secour</b> {{area are}} some of the oldest along the eastern Alabama Gulf Coast. With the arrival of the current {{development}} boom, post Hurricane Ivan, property/houses in the area range anywhere from US$100,000 dollars for an older, inland house, to over several million dollars for a brand new mansion on the Bon <b>Secour</b> River banks or Bon <b>Secour</b> Bay. New, affluent, gated communities are growing. Those with the financial resources can purchase pristine, unadulterated land with million-dollar views of a wonderful ecosystem, complete with access to Mobile Bay, the Intracoastal Waterway, and the maritime travel opportunities that such waterways provide. All that is needed is a yacht and the means to travel anywhere the Intracoastal waterway extends. One can go from their own dock in Bon <b>Secour,</b> Alabama to Ft. Lauderdale, Florida by water. Boaters can circumnavigate the island or even pursue a trans-Gulf crossing, with a big enough vessel and enough seamanship experience for the voyage. Some local vessels have been known to travel from the Alabama Gulf Coast, across the Gulf of Mexico and Bay of Campeche to Cozumel (Mexico), Playa del Carmen, Cancún, etc.|$|R
