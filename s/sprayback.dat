50|$|In 2011, the Vienna University of Technology {{successfully}} built a pykrete ice dome, measuring 10 m in diameter. They improved on {{an original}} Japanese technique of spraying ice on a balloon by utilizing the natural properties {{of ice and}} its strength. This structure managed to stand for three months before solar radiation started melting the ice, rendering the structure unreliable. Researcher Johann Kollegger of Vienna University of Technology thinks his team's alternative new method is easier, avoiding icy <b>sprayback</b> onto the workers. To build their freestanding structure, Kollegger and his colleagues first cut an 8 in plate of ice into 16 segments. To sculpt the segments to have a dome-like curve, the researchers relied on ice's creep behavior. If pressure is applied to ice, it slowly changes its shape without breaking. One of the mechanisms by which glaciers move, called glacial creep, functions similarly, the researchers say.|$|E
