5|$|The four {{credit rating}} {{agencies}} which monitor Iceland's <b>sovereign</b> <b>debt</b> all lowered their ratings during the crisis, and their outlook for future ratings changes became negative. The Icelandic government had a relatively healthy balance, with <b>sovereign</b> <b>debt</b> of 28% of GDP and a budget surplus of 6% of GDP (2007). More recently, the estimated 2011 debt was 130% of GDP {{with a budget}} deficit of 6% of GDP.|$|E
5|$|The {{detailed}} {{causes of}} the debt crisis varied. In several countries, private debts arising from a property bubble were transferred to <b>sovereign</b> <b>debt</b> {{as a result of}} banking system bailouts and government responses to slowing economies post-bubble. The structure of the eurozone as a currency union (i.e., one currency) without fiscal union (e.g., different tax and public pension rules) contributed to the crisis and limited the ability of European leaders to respond. European banks own a significant amount of <b>sovereign</b> <b>debt,</b> such that concerns regarding the solvency of banking systems or sovereigns are negatively reinforcing.|$|E

5|$|On 28 June 2012 eurozone leaders {{agreed to}} permit loans by the European Stability Mechanism {{to be made}} {{directly}} to stressed banks rather than through eurozone states, to avoid adding to <b>sovereign</b> <b>debt.</b> The reform was linked to plans for banking regulation by the European Central Bank. The reform was immediately reflected by a reduction in yield of long-term bonds issued by member states such as Italy and Spain and a rise in value of the Euro.|$|E

40|$|We {{develop a}} dynamic model of {{sovereign}} default and renegotiation {{to study how}} expectations of default and debt restructuring {{in the near future}} affect the ex ante maturity structure of <b>sovereign</b> <b>debts.</b> This paper argues that the average maturity is shorter when a country is approaching financial distress due to two risks: default risk and "debt dilution" risk. Long-term yield is generally higher than short-term yield to reflect the higher default risk incorporated in long-term debts. When default risk is high and long-term debt is too expensive to afford, the country near default has to rely on short-term debt. The second risk, "debt dilution" risk, is the focus of this paper. It arises because there is no explicit seniority structure among different <b>sovereign</b> <b>debts,</b> and all debt holders are legally equal and expect to get the same haircut rate in the post-default debt restructuring. Therefore, new debt issuances around crisis reduce the amount that can be recovered by existing earlier debt-holders in debt restructuring, and thus ``dilute'' existing debts. As a result, investors tend to hold short-term debt which is more likely to mature before it is "diluted" to avoid the "dilution" risk. Model features non-contingent bonds of two maturities, endogenous default and endogenous hair cut rate in a debt renegotiation after default. We show that ``debt dilution'' effect is always present and is more severe when default risk is high. When default is a likely event in the near future, both default risk and ``dilution'' risk drive the ex ante maturity of <b>sovereign</b> <b>debts</b> to be shorter. In a quantitative analysis, we try to calibrate the model to match various features of the recent crisis episode of Argentina. In particular, we try to account for the shifts in maturity structure before crisis and the volatility of long-term and short-term spreads observed in the prior default episode of ArgentinaMaturity Structure, <b>Debt</b> Dilution, <b>Sovereign</b> Default, <b>Debt</b> Renegotiation...|$|R

5|$|A second {{important}} {{factor is the}} success of the IMF Stand-By-Arrangement in the country since November 2008. The SBA includes three pillars. The first pillar is a program of medium term fiscal consolidation, involving painful austerity measures and significant tax hikes. The result has been that central government debts have been stabilised at around 80–90 percent of GDP. A second pillar is the resurrection of a viable but sharply downsized domestic banking system on the ruins of its gargantuan international banking system which the government was unable to bail out. A third pillar is the enactment of capital controls and the work to gradually lift these to restore normal financial linkages with the outside world. An important result of the emergency legislation and the SBA is that the country has not been seriously affected by the European <b>sovereign</b> <b>debt</b> crisis from 2010. Despite a contentious debate with Britain and the Netherlands over the question of a state guarantee on the Icesave deposits of Landsbanki in these countries, credit default swaps on Icelandic <b>sovereign</b> <b>debt</b> have steadily declined from over 1000 points prior to the crash in 2008 to around 200 points in June 2011. The fact that the assets of the failed Landsbanki branches are now estimated to cover most of the depositor claims has had an influence to ease concerns over the situation.|$|E
5|$|According to a {{study by}} economists at St Gallen University credit rating {{agencies}} have fuelled rising euro zone indebtedness by issuing more severe downgrades since the <b>sovereign</b> <b>debt</b> crisis unfolded in 2009. The authors concluded that rating agencies were not consistent in their judgments, on average rating Portugal, Ireland, and Greece 2.3 notches lower than under pre-crisis standards, eventually forcing them to seek international aid. On a side note: as of end of November 2013 only three countries in the eurozone retain AAA ratings from Standard & Poor, i.e. Germany, Finland and Luxembourg.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>sovereign</b> <b>debt</b> having risen {{substantially}} {{in only a}} few eurozone countries, with the three most affected countries Greece, Ireland and Portugal collectively only accounting for 6% of the eurozone's gross domestic product (GDP), it has become a perceived problem for the area as a whole, leading to speculation of further contagion of other European countries and a possible break-up of the eurozone. In total, the debt crisis forced five out of 17 eurozone countries to seek help from other nations by the end of 2012.|$|E

40|$|European {{capital markets}} show {{increasing}} {{concern about the}} extent of <b>sovereign</b> <b>debts</b> and their sustainability. Here we explore some insights that the Overlapping Generations (OLG) framework has to offer on such issues. The OLG framework implies, for example, that {{there is a limit to}} the amount of debt that may be sustained in a closed economy- with high debt raising interest rates and crowding out capital formation. But capital market integration with less indebted partners allows for a fall in interest rates as a result of borrowing from one's neighbour. Indeed we find that - in equilibrium - most of the debt of a high indebted country will be transferred to partner countries. debt sustainability, overlapping generations, <b>sovereign</b> default, Euro-zone <b>debt</b> crisis...|$|R
50|$|In {{relationship}} to the total amounts involved in the Eurozone crisis, the economy of Germany is relatively small and would be unable, {{even if it were}} willing, to guarantee payment of the <b>sovereign</b> <b>debts</b> {{of the rest of the}} Eurozone as Spain and even Italy and France are added to potentially defaulting nations. Thus, according to Chancellor Angela Merkel, German participation in rescue efforts is conditioned on negotiation of Eurozone reforms which have the potential to resolve the underlying imbalances which are driving the crisis.|$|R
5|$|European {{banks are}} {{estimated}} to have incurred losses approaching €1 trillion between {{the outbreak of the}} financial crisis in 2007 and 2010. The European Commission approved some €4.5 trillion in state aid for banks between October 2008 and October 2011, a sum which includes the value of taxpayer-funded recapitalisations and public guarantees on banking debts. This has prompted some economists such as Joseph Stiglitz and Paul Krugman to note that Europe is not suffering from a <b>sovereign</b> <b>debt</b> crisis but rather from a banking crisis.|$|E
5|$|Following the U.S. {{financial}} crisis in 2008, {{fears of a}} <b>sovereign</b> <b>debt</b> crisis developed in 2009 among investors concerning some European states, with the situation becoming particularly tense in early 2010. Greece was most acutely affected, but fellow Eurozone members Cyprus, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain were also significantly affected.

5|$|In {{an effort}} to {{stabilize}} the situation, the Icelandic government stated that all domestic deposits in Icelandic banks would be guaranteed, imposed strict capital controls to stabilize {{the value of the}} Icelandic króna, and secured a US$5.1bn <b>sovereign</b> <b>debt</b> package from the IMF and the Nordic countries in order to finance a budget deficit and the restoration of the banking system.

40|$|Despite the {{popularity}} of the term among advocates of debt forgiveness, there is little agreement on a workable definition of"odious"debts and there are but few examples where the concept has been invoked in law to justify non-payment of <b>sovereign</b> <b>debts.</b> Most often, these have been cases when a successor state or government has refused to honor certain debts contracted by its predecessor state or government. Repudiating <b>sovereign</b> <b>debts</b> on broader grounds - such as that money may have been misused by the borrower or that results were not as hoped for at the outset of lending - would create real risks not only of reduced financial flows to poorer countries {{as a result of the}} danger of ex post challenges to lenders'claims, but also of moral hazard and lack of project ownership. This paper presents a discussion of the extant legal and financial environment facing developing country sovereign borrowers and develops a proposed approach within this environment to address issues of concern underlying the concept of odious or illegitimate debt.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{determinants}} of the sovereign credit ratings provided by the three major rating agencies: Fitch Ratings, Moody's and Standard and Poor.

Results show that sovereign ratings are mostly influenced by per capita income, government income, real exchange rate changes, inflation rate and default history.
