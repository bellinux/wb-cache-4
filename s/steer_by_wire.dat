This version featured increased cruising speed, a digital avionics system with EFIS supplied by AlliedSignal (today Honeywell) and an instrument panel layout change. The nose gear wheel is steered by a <b>Steer</b> <b>by</b> <b>Wire</b> system. The windshield could be heated electrically.|$|E
50|$|Position of coxswain. Boats {{are either}} coxless, bow-coxed (also called bowloaders), or stern-coxed. In coxless ("straight") boats, a {{steersman}} {{is responsible for}} steering by either use of a mechanism connecting one of his shoes <b>by</b> <b>wire</b> to the rudder—the swiveling of the shoe turns the rudder, or by using a hand controlled string, called a tiller rope, which {{is parallel to the}} gunwales or the boat, and controls the rudder in a similar fashion. Singles and doubles do not employ a rudder in competition; the oarsmen <b>steer</b> <b>by</b> increasing or decreasing pressure or length on one scull or the other. In competition, bow- and stern-coxed boats may race one another.|$|R
50|$|Tunnel boring {{machines}} are <b>steered</b> <b>by</b> hydraulic tilting of the cutter head. Rail track vehicles (i.e. trains, trams) are <b>steered</b> <b>by</b> curved guide tracks, including switches, and articulated undercarriages. Land yachts on wheels and kite buggies are steered similarly to cars. Ice yachts and bobsleighs are <b>steered</b> <b>by</b> rotating the front runners {{out of the}} direction of travel. Snowmobiles steer the same way by rotating the front skis. Tracked vehicles (i.e. tanks) <b>steer</b> <b>by</b> increasing the drive force on the side opposite of the direction of turn. Horse-drawn sleighs and dog sleds are <b>steered</b> <b>by</b> changing the direction of pull. Zero-turn lawn mowers use independent hydraulic wheel drive {{to turn on the}} spot.|$|R
50|$|Ships {{and boats}} are usually steered with a rudder. Depending {{on the size}} of the vessel, rudders can be {{manually}} actuated, or operated using a servomechanism, or a trim tab/servo tab system. Boats using outboard motors <b>steer</b> <b>by</b> rotating the entire drive unit. Boats with inboard motors sometimes <b>steer</b> <b>by</b> rotating the propeller pod only (i.e. Volvo Penta IPS drive). Modern ships with diesel-electric drive use azimuth thrusters. Boats driven by oars (i.e. rowing boats, including gondolas) or paddles (i.e. canoes, kayaks, rafts) are <b>steered</b> <b>by</b> generating a higher propulsion force on the side of the boat opposite of the direction of turn. Jet skis are <b>steered</b> <b>by</b> weight-shift induced roll and water jet thrust vectoring. Water skis and surfboards are <b>steered</b> <b>by</b> weight-shift induced roll only.|$|R
50|$|The Fuse uses very {{high-tech}} {{instruments in}} {{it along with}} a highly sophisticated <b>steer</b> <b>by</b> <b>wire</b> system. Inside the Fuse are video, driving, and car configurations that can make driving around a bit easier. With {{the help of the}} Wi-Fi connection that is built into the Fuse, the driver and passengers can instant message one of their friends; much like how a computer or a mobile phone does. Also, the front passenger seat can fold down to create a table, footrest, or just as extra cargo space.|$|E

Firstly, steering force feedback subsystem of <b>steer</b> <b>by</b> <b>wire</b> is designed. Design of <b>steer</b> <b>by</b> <b>wire</b> system mechanical parts must consider effects of automobile vibration environment. Then, worm of worm drive speed reducer is modeled using ANSYS software and modal analysis is performed. Natural frequencies and vibration mode contour maps of each order are acquired.

Many researchers have done their control strategy on <b>steer</b> <b>by</b> <b>wire</b> system in past recent years. This paper presents the control strategy for the wheel synchronization and the variable steering ratio. Mathematical modeling was created for steering wheel and front wheel model.

50|$|Airplanes are {{normally}} <b>steered</b> <b>by</b> {{the use of}} ailerons to bank the aircraft into a turn; the rudder is used to minimise adverse yaw, {{rather than as a}} means to directly cause the turn. Missiles, airships and large hovercraft are usually <b>steered</b> <b>by</b> rudder and/or thrust vectoring. Small sport hovercraft have similar rudders, but <b>steer</b> mostly <b>by</b> the pilot weight-shifting from side to side and unbalancing the more powerful lift forces beneath the skirt. Jet packs and flying platforms are <b>steered</b> <b>by</b> thrust vectoring only. Helicopters are <b>steered</b> <b>by</b> cyclic control, changing the thrust vector of the main rotor(s), and by anti-torque control, usually provided by a tail rotor (see helicopter flight controls).|$|R

40|$|Automobile {{drivers are}} {{regularly}} exposed to vibrational stimuli in their vehicle. Of the automobile subsystems, {{the steering wheel}} {{is one of the}} most important due to its role in controlling the vehicle. In particular, the steering wheel plays an important role in transmitting information about the road and about the vehicle to the driver. This paper investigates the effect of steering system feedback gain and steering system feedback bandwidth on the human interpretation of the driving information transmitted by the steering wheel. Human recognition of road surface type was found to be highly dependent on the feedback gain and the feedback bandwidth of the steering wheel vibration. The results provide some basic guidelines for designing the control logic of <b>steer</b> <b>by</b> <b>wire</b> systems...|$|E
40|$|Sponsoring {{organization}} Title and subtitle Side Wind Compensation using Active Suspension (Sidvindskompensering m. h. a. aktiv fjädring) This thesis investigates what {{mechanisms that}} contribute to the interaction between lateral and vertical dynamics in a four-wheeled vehicle. For this a vehicle model was derived. To capture all the essential dynamics of the vehicle, both a horizontal model and a vertical model was used. The interaction between the models turned out to be quite evident, making it possible to use the active suspension system to influence the yaw dynamics of the vehicle. Further, it was investigated how this effect could be used for attenuating the effects of wind gusts. Since <b>steer</b> <b>by</b> <b>wire</b> is still a topic of active research and it´s integration into vehicles lies in the future, this cannot presently be used for side wind rejection. With the vehicle model, it was possible to design a feedback controller that uses the active suspension system for side wind rejection...|$|E
40|$|In {{conventional}} steering system, a feedback torque {{is produced}} from the contact between tire and road surface and its flows through mechanical column shaft directly to driver. This allows {{the driver to}} sense the steering feel during driving. However, in <b>steer</b> <b>by</b> <b>wire</b> (SBW) system, {{the elimination of the}} mechanical column shaft requires the system to generate the feedback torque which should produce similar performance with conventional steering system. Therefore, this paper proposes a control algorithm to create the force feedback torque for SBW system. The direct current measurement approach is used to estimate torque at the steering wheel and front axle motor as elements to the feedback torque, while, adding the compensation torque for a realistic feedback torque. The gain scheduling with a linear quadratic regulator controller is used to control the feedback torque and to vary a steering feel gain. To investigate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, a real-time hardware in the loop (HIL) methodology is developed using Matlab XPC target toolbox. The results show that the proposed algorithm is able to generate the feedback torque similar to EPS steering system. Furthermore, the compensation torque is able to improve the steering feel and stabilize the system...|$|E

40|$|Distributed {{systems are}} omnipresent {{nowadays}} and networking them is fundamental for the continuous dissemination and thus availability of data. Provision of data in real-time {{is one of}} the most important non-functional aspects that safety-critical networks must guarantee. Formal verification of data communication against worst-case deadline requirements is key to certification of emerging x-by-wire systems. Verification allows aircraft to take off, cars to <b>steer</b> <b>by</b> <b>wire,</b> and safety-critical industrial facilities to operate. Therefore, different methodologies for worst-case modeling and analysis of real-time systems have been established. Among them is deterministic Network Calculus (NC), a versatile technique that is applicable across multiple domains such as packet switching, task scheduling, system on chip, software-defined networking, data center networking and network virtualization. NC is a methodology to derive deterministic bounds on two crucial performance metrics of communication systems: (a) the end-to-end delay data flows experience and (b) the buffer space required by a server to queue all incoming data. NC has already seen application in the industry, for instance, basic results have been used to certify the backbone network of the Airbus A 380 aircraft. The NC methodology for worst-case performance analysis of distributed real-time systems consists of two branches. Both share the NC network model but diverge regarding their respective derivation of performance bounds, i. e., their analysis principle. NC was created as a deterministic system theory for queueing analysis and its operations were later cast in a (min,+) -algebraic framework. This branch is known as algebraic Network Calculus (algNC). While algNC can efficiently compute bounds on delay and backlog, the algebraic manipulations do not allow NC to attain the most accurate bounds achievable for the given network model. These tight performance bounds can only be attained with the other, newly established branch of NC, the optimization-based analysis (optNC). However, the only optNC analysis that can currently derive tight bounds was proven to be computationally infeasible even for the analysis of moderately sized networks other than simple sequences of servers. This thesis makes various contributions in the area of algNC: accuracy within the existing framework is improved, distributivity of the sensor network calculus analysis is established, and most significantly the algNC is extended with optimization principles. They allow algNC to derive performance bounds that are competitive with optNC. Moreover, the computational efficiency of the new NC approach is improved such that this thesis presents the first NC analysis that is both accurate and computationally feasible at the same time. It allows NC to scale to larger, more complex systems that require formal verification of their real-time capabilities...|$|E
