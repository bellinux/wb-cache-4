5|$|Vertical jumps (high {{jump and}} pole vault) set a bar at a {{particular}} height. The competitor must clear the bar without knocking it off the <b>standards</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> holding the bar (flat). Three failures in a row ends the competitor's participation in the event. The competitor has the option to PASS their attempt, {{which can be used}} to strategic advantage (of course that advantage is lost if the competitor misses). A pass could be used to save energy and avoid taking a jump that would not improve their position in the standings. After all competitors have either cleared, passed or failed their attempts at a height, the bar goes up. The amount the bar goes up is predetermined before the competition, though when one competitor remains, that competitor may choose their own heights for the remaining attempts. A record is kept of each attempt by each competitor. After all competitors have taken their attempts, the one jumping the highest is the winner, and so on down the other competitors in the event. Ties are broken by first, the number of attempts taken at the highest height (fewest wins), and then if still tied, {{by the total number of}} misses in the competition as a whole. The bar does not go back to a lower height except to break a tie for first place or a qualifying position. If those critical positions are still tied after applying the tiebreakers, all tied competitors take a fourth jump at the last height. If they still miss, the bar goes down one increment where they again jump. This process continues until the tie is broken.|$|E

Mixing zone policy is defined area surrounding a point source discharge where sewage is diluted by water. Methodology of mixing zone procedure determines the location, size, shape and quality of mixing zones. Variance policy temporarily relax water quality standard and are alternatives to removing a designated use. States and tribes may include variance {{as part of their}} water quality standard. Variance is subject to public review every three years and warrant development towards improvement of water quality. Low Flow policy pertains to states and tribes water quality standards that identify procedures applied to determining critical low flow conditions.|$|E

500|$|In digital {{television}} broadcasting, {{there are three}} competing <b>standards</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> likely to be adopted worldwide. These are the ATSC, DVB and ISDB standards; the adoption of these standards thus far {{is presented in the}} captioned map. All three standards use MPEG-2 for video compression. ATSC uses Dolby Digital AC-3 for audio compression, ISDB uses Advanced Audio Coding (MPEG-2 Part 7) and DVB has no standard for audio compression but typically uses MPEG-1 Part 3 Layer 2. The choice of modulation also varies between the schemes. In digital audio broadcasting, standards are much more unified with practically all countries choosing to adopt the Digital Audio Broadcasting standard (also known as the Eureka 147 standard). The exception is the United States which has chosen to adopt HD Radio. HD Radio, unlike Eureka 147, is based upon a transmission method known as in-band on-channel transmission that allows digital information to [...] "piggyback" [...] on normal AM or FM analog transmissions.|$|E

[...] For forensic chemists, the international Scientific Working Group for the Analysis of Seized Drugs (SWGDRUG) presents recommendations for the quality assurance and quality control of tested materials. [...] In the identification of unknown samples, protocols have been grouped into three categories based on the probability for false positives. [...] Instruments and protocols in category A are considered the best for uniquely identifying an unknown material, followed by categories B and then C. [...] To ensure the accuracy of identifications SWGDRUG recommends that multiple tests using different instruments be performed on each sample, and that one category A technique and at least one other technique be used. [...] If a category A technique is not available, or the forensic chemist decides not to use one, SWGDRUG recommends that at least three techniques be used, two of which must be from category B. [...] Combination instruments, such as GC-MS, are considered two separate tests as long as the results are compared to known values individually [...] For example, the GC elution times would be compared to known values along with the MS spectra. [...] If both of those match a known substance, no further tests are needed.|$|E

The Dean of Admissions of Bryn Mawr noted, [...] "We still prepare {{a disproportionate number of}} women scientists [...] We’re really about the empowerment of women and enabling women to get a top-notch education." [...] The article also contrasted the difference between women's colleges in the Middle East and [...] "the American colleges [...] for all their white-glove history and academic prominence, are liberal strongholds where students fiercely debate political action, gender identity and issues like 'heteronormativity', the marginalizing of <b>standards</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> other than heterosexual.

2500|$|The Supreme Court first {{noted that}} the law (historically) has {{prohibited}} the shackling of a defendant in the guilty-innocent phase of a trial. The court also noted shackling is only allowed {{when there is a}} “special need." [...] The court explained that this concept is embedded in the law and that courts have followed this rule throughout history. The court noted that this rule was first written by William Blackstone in his 18th Century Commentaries on England. Blackstone, a politician, judge and jurist, wrote “it is laid down in our ancient books, that, though under an indictment of the highest nature, a defendant must be brought to the bar without irons, or any manner of shackles or bonds; unless there be evident danger of an escape.” Next, the court looked at more recent opinions to show that this rule relates to a defendant’s right to due process. The court looked at the dictum of three cases, Illinois v. Allen, Holbrook v. Flynn and Estelle v. Williams. In Allen, the Court said that trial courts should only use shackles on defendants, during the guilty phase, as a “last resort.” [...] In Holbrook, the court stated that shackling is “prejudicial” and should only be allowed when state interests are involved. Lastly, in Estelle, the court stated that making a defendant go to in trial wearing prison attire threatened the “fairness of the fact-finding process” and should only be allowed when “essential state policy” justifies it. [...] The Court then established that these cases give acknowledgement to <b>standards</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> embedded in the Constitution and the law which governs in the United States. The court then tried to determine is this rule also applies to the sentencing phase of a trial, not just the guilt-innocent portion.|$|E
