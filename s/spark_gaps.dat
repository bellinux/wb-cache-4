5|$|It was {{recognized}} {{early on that}} SiC had such a voltage-dependent resistance, and so columns of SiC pellets were connected between high-voltage power lines and the earth. When a lightning strike to the line raises the line voltage sufficiently, the SiC column will conduct, allowing strike current to pass harmlessly to the earth instead of along the power line. Such SiC columns proved to conduct significantly at normal power-line operating voltages and thus had {{to be placed in}} series with a spark gap. This spark gap is ionized and rendered conductive when lightning raises the voltage of the power line conductor, thus effectively connecting the SiC column between the power conductor and the earth. <b>Spark</b> <b>gaps</b> used in lightning arresters are unreliable, either failing to strike an arc when needed or failing to turn off afterwards, in the latter case due to material failure or contamination by dust or salt. Usage of SiC columns was originally intended to eliminate the need for the spark gap in a lightning arrester. Gapped SiC lightning arresters were used as lightning-protection tool and sold under GE and Westinghouse brand names, among others. The gapped SiC arrester has been largely displaced by no-gap varistors that use columns of zinc oxide pellets.|$|E
25|$|Static {{triggered}} {{spark gap}} - Commercial and industrial circuits often apply a DC voltage from {{a power supply}} to charge the capacitor, and use high voltage pulses generated by an oscillator applied to a triggering electrode to trigger the spark. This allows control of the spark rate and exciting voltage. Commercial <b>spark</b> <b>gaps</b> are often enclosed in an insulating gas atmosphere such as sulfur hexafluoride, reducing the length and thus the energy loss in the spark.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the largest}} {{applications}} of the Tesla coil circuit was in early radio transmitters called spark gap transmitters. The first radio wave generators, invented by Heinrich Hertz in 1887, were <b>spark</b> <b>gaps</b> connected directly to antennas, powered by induction coils. Because they lacked a resonant circuit, these transmitters produced highly damped radio waves. As a result, their transmissions occupied an extremely wide bandwidth of frequencies. When multiple transmitters were operating {{in the same area}} their frequencies overlapped and they interfered with one another, causing garbled reception. There was no way for a receiver to select one signal over another.|$|E

40|$|A normal de {{resonant}} charger {{was transformed}} into a command-mode charger by connecting a <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> at its output terminal, prior to the load circuit. This charging <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> was triggered by a transformer connected in series, pulsed by a fast <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> circuit. Noise suppression schemes were implemented throughout the command charger, in particular around the charging <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> to order prevent misfiring. The ringing noise and spikes from the capacitor discharge and those of the stray capacitance of coaxial cable were strongly suppressed by a simple LCR circuit so that these would hot induce self-breakdown in the charging <b>spark</b> <b>gap.</b> This triggered <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> command charger was tested to 2 kHz and < 10 kV with a resistive load. A transversely excited atmospheric CO 2 laser was operated up to 300 Hz and (10 - 15) kV that was limited only by the flow rate of the laser gas mixture...|$|R
50|$|In 1886, after noticing unusual induced {{sparking}} in a Riess spiral, physicist Heinrich Hertz concluded {{this phenomenon}} {{could be used}} to scientifically verify James Clerk Maxwell's predictions on electromagnetism. Hertz used a tuned <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> transmitter and a tuned <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> detector (consisting of a loop of wire connected to a small <b>spark</b> <b>gap)</b> located a few meters from the source. In a series of experiments, Hertz verified that electromagnetic waves were being produced by the transmitter: when the transmitter sparked, small sparks also appeared across the receiver's <b>spark</b> <b>gap,</b> which could be seen under a microscope.|$|R
2500|$|Spark-excited or Spark Gap Tesla Coil (SGTC) - This type uses a {{spark gap}} to switch pulses of current through the primary, {{exciting}} oscillation in the transformer. This pulsed (disruptive) drive creates a pulsed high voltage output. <b>Spark</b> <b>gaps</b> have disadvantages {{due to the}} high primary currents they must handle. They produce a very loud noise while operating, noxious ozone gas, and high temperatures which often require a cooling system. The energy dissipated in the spark also reduces the Q factor and the output voltage.|$|E
2500|$|The first-generation IGBTs of the 1980s {{and early}} 1990s were prone to failure through effects such as latchup (in which the device will not turn off {{as long as}} current is flowing) and {{secondary}} breakdown (in which a localized hotspot in the device goes into thermal runaway and burns the device out at high currents). Second-generation devices were much improved. The current third-generation IGBTs are even better, with speed rivaling MOSFETs, and excellent ruggedness and tolerance of overloads. Extremely high pulse ratings of second and third-generation devices also make them useful for generating large power pulses in areas including particle and plasma physics, where they are starting to supersede older devices such as [...] thyratrons and triggered <b>spark</b> <b>gaps.</b> High pulse ratings and low prices on the surplus market also make them attractive to the high-voltage hobbyists for controlling large amounts of power to drive devices such as solid-state Tesla coils and coilguns.|$|E
2500|$|In other {{experiments}} that {{spring and summer}} Lodge put a series of <b>spark</b> <b>gaps</b> along two 29 meter long wires and noticed he was getting a very large spark in the gap {{near the end of}} the wires, which seemed to be consistent with the oscillation wavelength produced by the Leyden jar meeting with the wave being reflected at the end of the wire. In a darkened room, he also noted a glow at intervals along the wire at one half wavelength intervals. He took this as evidence that he was generating and detecting Maxwell's electromagnetic waves. While on summer vacation Lodge learned that Heinrich Hertz in Germany had been conducting his own electromagnetic research and published a series of papers proving the existence of electromagnetic waves and their propagation in free space. Lodge presented his own paper on electromagnetic waves along wires in September 1888 at the British Science Association meeting in Bath, England, adding a postscript acknowledging Hertz's work and saying: [...] "The whole subject of electrical radiation seems working itself out splendidly." ...|$|E

50|$|An {{alternative}} construction uses two capacitors connected as a Blumlein generator. Two capacitors {{are connected}} {{so that one}} plate is a common earth, the others are each connected to the <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> electrodes. These capacitors are often constructed from a single layer of printed circuit board, or similar stack of copper foil and thin dielectric. The capacitors are linked through an inductor, a simple air-spaced coil. One capacitor also has a small <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> across it. When HT is applied, the two capacitors are charged slowly, effectively linked by the inductor. When the <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> reaches its triggering voltage, it discharges and quickly reduces that capacitor's voltage to zero. As the discharge is rapid, the inductor acts as an open circuit and so the voltage difference across the transverse <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> (between the two capacitors) rises rapidly until the main <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> discharges, firing the laser.|$|R
40|$|Ignitability of DMSO vapors {{have been}} {{evaluated}} at 664 mm Hg pressure. The minimum temperature at which the DMSO vapors that are in equilibrium with liquid DMSO has been determined using two types of strong ignition sources. This temperature is 172 F for chemical igniters, and 178 F for spark ignition. Numerous tests have been conducted using controlled intensity sparks to define {{the shape of the}} minimum ignition energy curve as a function of temperature. The ignition energies spanned four orders of magnitude (approximately from 20, 000 to 2 mJ) while the DMSO vapor mixture temperature varied from 185 to 207 F. The Sandia Generator was used to simulate worst case electrostatic sparks that can be produced by the human body. Although it was not designed for air discharges, this device had been used by LLNL for 1 mm <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> and the resultant spark energy had been measured to fall within the range from 3. 2 to 8. 8 mJ. CRC tests using this device showed that the minimum ignition temperature strongly depends on the <b>spark</b> <b>gap.</b> The minimum ignition temperature was 207 F at 1 mm <b>spark</b> <b>gap,</b> 203 F at 3 mm <b>spark</b> <b>gap,</b> and 197 F at 6 mm <b>spark</b> <b>gap.</b> This strong dependence on the <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> is believed to be partly due to the changes in the spark energy as the <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> changes...|$|R

40|$|The <b>spark</b> <b>gap,</b> {{used as a}} {{sound source}} in scale model investigations, has {{advantages}} and disadvantages. One of the advantages is its limited size, which is particularly important for investigations at small scales. Also, the <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> is omnidirectional and can be constructed such that the shape has a negligible influence on the sound field to be measured, for any scale factor. A disadvantage of an excessive discharge is {{the appearance of a}} shockwave.

50|$|Smaller <b>spark</b> <b>gaps</b> {{are often}} used to protect {{sensitive}} electrical or electronic equipment from high-voltage surges. In sophisticated versions of these devices (called gas tube arresters), a small spark gap breaks down during an abnormal voltage surge, safely shunting the surge to ground and thereby protecting the equipment. These devices are commonly used for telephone lines as they enter a building; the <b>spark</b> <b>gaps</b> help protect the building and internal telephone circuits {{from the effects of}} lightning strikes. Less sophisticated (and much less expensive) <b>spark</b> <b>gaps</b> are made using modified ceramic capacitors; in these devices, the spark gap is simply an air gap sawn between the two lead wires that connect the capacitor to the circuit.
