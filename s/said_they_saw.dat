The Bridgeport Herald reported {{a half mile}} flight occurred {{early in the morning}} on 14 August. Whitehead and Harworth said that a flight one and a half miles long was made later that day. In all, four flights were reported to have taken place on 14 August 1901 by witnesses.|$|E
25|$|Maria Esperanza de Bianchini {{had several}} Marian {{apparition}}s among her many other claimed visions and miracles. In one event, on March 25, 1984, 150 other people also <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> the Blessed Mother along with Maria Esperanza. The apparition was deemed valid by Bishop Pio Bello Ricardo of Los Teques, Venezuela, in 1987 and Mrs. Bianchini's cause for sainthood was opened on January 31, 2010.|$|E
25|$|John 'Jackie' Duddy, age 17. Shot as he {{ran away}} from {{soldiers}} in the car park of Rossville Flats. The bullet struck him in the shoulder and entered his chest. Three witnesses <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> a soldier take deliberate aim at the youth {{as he ran}}. He was the first fatality on Bloody Sunday. Like Saville, Widgery also concluded that Duddy was unarmed. His nephew is boxer John Duddy.|$|E

25|$|Following President Enrique Peña Nieto's {{proposal}} to legalize same-sex marriage in Mexico, a poll {{on the issue}} {{was carried out by}} Gabinete de Comunicación Estratégica. 69% of respondents were in favor of the change. 64% <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> it as an advance in the recognition of human rights. Public opinion has changed radically over the course of 16 years. In 2000, 62% felt that same-sex marriage should not be allowed under any circumstances. In 2016, only 25% felt that way.|$|E
25|$|French {{judicial}} documents state Amedy Coulibaly and Chérif Kouachi travelled {{with their}} wives in 2010 to central France to visit Djamel Beghal. In a police interview in 2010, Coulibaly identified Chérif as a friend he had met in prison and <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> each other frequently. In 2010, the Kouachi brothers were named {{in connection with a}} plot to break out from jail another Islamist, Smaïn Aït Ali Belkacem. For lack of evidence, they were not prosecuted. Belkacem was one of those responsible for the 1995 Paris Métro and RER bombings that killed eight people.|$|E
25|$|The 1978 book co-authored by O'Dwyer and Randolph, History by Contract {{argued that}} the Smithsonian {{compromised}} its objectivity when it signed a 1948 agreement with the estate of Orville Wright requiring the Institution to recognize the 1903 Wright Flyer as the first aircraft to make a manned, powered, controlled flight or forfeit possession of the aircraft. The book published correspondence between O'Dwyer and the Smithsonian in which he asked the Institution {{to look at the}} evidence and to attend interviews of people who <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> Whitehead fly. The book called for nullification of the agreement.|$|E

25|$|Several {{survivors}} later <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> Huberty {{walk toward}} the service counter and adjust a portable radio, possibly to search for news reports, before selecting a music station and returning to shooting. Shortly thereafter, he searched the kitchen area, discovering six employees. He opened fire, killing 21-year-old Paulina López, 19-year-old Elsa Borboa-Fierro, and 18-year-old Margarita Padilla, and critically wounding 17-year-old Alberto Leos. Padilla had urged her colleague, 17-year-old Wendy Flanagan, to run, before being fatally shot. Flanagan, four other employees and a female customer hid inside a basement utility room. They were joined by Leos, who had crawled to the utility room after being shot multiple times.|$|E
25|$|Whitehead's work {{remained}} mostly {{unknown to}} the public and aeronautical community after 1911 until a 1935 article in Popular Aviation magazine co-authored by educator and journalist Stella Randolph and aviation history buff Harvey Phillips. Randolph expanded the article into a book, Lost Flights of Gustave Whitehead, published in 1937. Randolph sought out people who had known Whitehead and had seen his flying machines and engines. She obtained 16 affidavits from 14 people and included the text of their statements in the book. Four people said they did not see flights, while the others <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> flights of various types, ranging from a few dozen to hundreds of feet, to more than a mile.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{theories}} {{as to the}} origin of the Book of Mormon. Most adherents to the Latter Day Saint movement view the book as a work of inspired scripture. The most common belief of adherents is that promoted by Joseph Smith, who said he translated ancient golden plates inscribed by prophets. Smith claimed the angel Moroni, a prophet in the Book of Mormon narrative, directed him in the 1820s to a hill near his home in Palmyra, New York where the plates were buried. Besides Smith himself, there were at least 11 witnesses who <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> the plates in 1829, and three also claiming to have been visited by an angel. Several other witnesses observed Smith dictating the text that eventually became the Book of Mormon.|$|E

Some witnesses <b>said</b> that <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> a huge mile-wide wedge tornado coming. The tornado was the third tornado in the Northwest Territories region since 1960.|$|R
5000|$|Kotleba's win was {{described}} as a [...] "shock" [...] by political analysts, who attributed it to deep anti-Romani sentiments in the region. Observers originally had <b>said</b> that <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> almost no chance for Kotleba to succeed in the second round against Maňka, but nonetheless found his strong showing [...] "disturbing".|$|R
25|$|In 2003, the Sci Fi Channel {{sponsored}} a {{scientific study of}} the area and related records by the Coalition for Freedom of Information. The most significant finding of the scientific team was a line of damaged trees broken at the top leading to the site where some eyewitnesses <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> the object embedded in the soil along with associated fresh tree damage. Furthermore, tree core samples dated the damage to 1965. This provided physical evidence that something airborne may have come crashing through the trees and landed in the woods. (However, one of the scientists instead suggested ice damage to the trees.) Minor soil disturbance was also found at the alleged landing site. Another witness reported hearing a pair of loud, horrific screams {{as members of the}} military approached the object on foot.|$|E
25|$|On March 17, 1937, Earhart and {{her crew}} flew {{the first leg}} from Oakland, California to Honolulu, Hawaii. In {{addition}} to Earhart and Noonan, Harry Manning and Mantz (who was acting as Earhart's technical advisor) were on board. Due to lubrication and galling problems with the propeller hubs' variable pitch mechanisms, the aircraft needed servicing in Hawaii. Ultimately, the Electra {{ended up at the}} United States Navy's Luke Field on Ford Island in Pearl Harbor. The flight resumed three days later from Luke Field with Earhart, Noonan and Manning on board. During the takeoff run, Earhart ground-looped, circumstances of which remain controversial. Some witnesses at Luke Field including the Associated Press journalist on the scene <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> a tire blow. Earhart thought either the Electra's right tire had blown and/or the right landing gear had collapsed. Some sources, including Mantz, cited pilot error.|$|E
25|$|On April 17 in Mexico City, {{the police}} raided one of Constanzo's {{properties}} in Atizapán. They discovered piles of homosexual pornography and a hidden ritual chamber with an altar. This prompted {{the police to}} question people in Mexico City's homosexual community {{to see if they}} had any leads on Constanzo's whereabouts. The Mexican police stated that no evidence was found at the scene to link Constanzo or his men to any murders committed there. They <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> altars and other ritualistic belongings, but did not find any traces of blood. No men were arrested at the scene, but the police managed to arrest a lady called María Teresa Quintana Rodríguez, sister of one of Constanzo's lovers and henchmen. The police also discovered that Aldrete's purse and other belongings were left behind, which prompted them to conclude that Constanzo probably murdered her because she knew too much about the inner workings of his cult group. The police stated that they did not see Aldrete with the group when they arrived in Mexico City. They thought that Constanzo might have buried her somewhere in the city. U.S. authorities, however, believed that Aldrete purposely left her belongings behind to confuse investigators and make it appear that she was dead. On April 24, the police arrested Víctor Manuel Antúnez Flores and Salvador Antonio Villaluz, who were hiding in one of Constanzo's properties in Juárez neighborhood.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Ishmael {{interpreted}} the words [...] "all the people perceived the thunderings, and the lightnings, {{and the voice}} of the horn" [...] in [...] (20:15 in the NJPS) to mean that the people saw what could be seen and heard what could be heard. But Rabbi Akiva <b>said</b> that <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> and heard what was perceivable, and <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> the fiery word of God strike the tablets.|$|R
5000|$|Numerous people <b>said</b> that <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> {{the girls}} {{boarding}} a CTA bus on Archer Avenue heading east {{into the city}} after the screening. They allegedly {{got off the bus}} at Western Avenue, about halfway to their home, around 11:05 pm. Why they would get off the bus at that station is unknown.|$|R

They were hardly out of Stronsay Frith when <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> the witch-whale again, {{following}} them up, rolling and spouting and breaching in most uncanny wise. Some <b>said</b> that <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> a gray woman on his back; and they knew--possibly {{from the look}} of the sky, but certainly from the whale's behavior--that there was more heavy weather yet coming from the northward.|$|R
500|$|Yet another injured protesters said: [...] "They had encircled us {{and they}} kept {{shooting}} tear gas and live rounds. The circle got closer and closer." [...] Some witnesses claimed the police used anti-Shia curses during their attacks on the mainly Shia protesters. Medics who arrived at Pearl Roundabout <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> police stamping on handcuffed protesters who laid on the ground. A nurse said she saw a group of police [...] "execute" [...] a young protester with a gun at [...] "point-blank range" [...] after handcuffing and beating him.|$|E
500|$|Harper {{attacked}} Wilkinson's lottery proposal as [...] "Alice in Wonderland" [...] economics. In addition, Harper's campaign {{raised a}} number of ethical issues with regard to Wilkinson's business dealings. Gary Stafford, Wilkinson's brother-in-law who was serving as president of Wallace's Book Store, pleaded guilty to illegal wiretapping and rolling back the odometers on company vehicles. The company was also forced to pay $44,641 in back taxes. Further, Republican state chairman Bob Gable questioned whether Wilkinson had helped Italian businessmen circumvent laws that {{made it difficult to}} export Italian currency by disguising real estate ventures as legitimate business transactions with Jernigan Export Timber. Gable also hired a private investigator who determined that there was [...] "substantial reason" [...] to suspect that foul play was involved in the death of Wilkinson's business partner, Jerome Jernigan. Despite Gable's allegations and the investigator's findings, Lexington police officials <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> no reason to re-open the investigation. Harper was at a substantial fundraising disadvantage, raising only $225,000 for the entire campaign compared to Wilkinson's $8 million. This left him unable to purchase enough media time to solidify any of the ethical questions about Wilkinson in the voters' minds. Wilkinson's campaign also delved into Harper's personal life, admitting that it tipped off the media about Harper's son, who had been shot to death in an attempted burglary.|$|E
500|$|But {{there was}} also {{speculation}} over how long Reagan had demonstrated symptoms of mental degeneration. Not long after the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan, at a reception for mayors, Reagan greeted his Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Samuel Pierce in 1981 by saying [...] "How are you, Mr Mayor? How are things in your city?" [...] Former CBS White House correspondent Lesley Stahl recounted that, in her final {{meeting with the president}} in 1986, Reagan did not seem to know who Stahl was, and that she came close to reporting that Reagan was senile, {{but at the end of}} the meeting, Reagan had regained his alertness. However, Dr. Lawrence K. Altman, a physician employed as a reporter for The New York Times, noted that [...] "the line between mere forgetfulness and the beginning of Alzheimer's can be fuzzy," [...] and all four of Reagan's White House doctors said that they saw no evidence of Alzheimer's while he was president. Dr. John E. Hutton, Reagan's primary physician from 1984 to 1989, said the president [...] "absolutely" [...] did not [...] "show any signs of dementia or Alzheimer's." [...] His former Chief of Staff James Baker considered [...] "ludicrous" [...] the idea that Reagan slept during cabinet meetings. Other staff members, former aides, and friends <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> no indication of Alzheimer's while he was president. Reagan did experience occasional memory lapses, though, especially with names. Reagan's doctors say that he only began exhibiting overt symptoms of the illness in late 1992 or 1993, several years after he had left office. For example, Reagan repeated a toast to Margaret Thatcher, with identical words and gestures, at his 82nd-birthday party on February 6, 1993.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to Smith, several other early Mormons {{said they had}} visions where they saw the angel Moroni. Three Witnesses <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> the angel in 1829: Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer, and Martin Harris. Other early Mormons who <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> Moroni include Emma Hale Smith, Hyrum Smith, Luke S. Johnson, Zera Pulsipher, W. W. Phelps, John P. Greene and his wife Rhoda, John Taylor, Oliver Granger, Heber C. Kimball, Lucy Harris, and Harrison Burgess. Mary Whitmer may also have seen Moroni, although she referred to the angel she saw as [...] "Brother Nephi".|$|E

50|$|In December 2008 a two-member CBI {{team went}} to New York to record {{statements}} from Jasbir Singh and Surinder Singh, two eyewitnesses.

They blamed the CBI for not conducting a fair trial, accusing the bureau of protecting Tytler.|$|R
