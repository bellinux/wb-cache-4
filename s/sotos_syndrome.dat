40|$|Weaver syndrome, first {{described}} in 1974, {{is characterized by}} tall stature, a typical facial appearance, and variable intellectual disability. In 2011, mutations in the histone methyltransferase, EZH 2, were shown to cause Weaver syndrome. To date, we have identified 48 individuals with EZH 2 mutations. The mutations were primarily missense mutations occurring throughout the gene, with some clustering in the SET domain (12 / 48). Truncating mutations were uncommon (4 / 48) and only identified in the final exon, after the SET domain. Through analyses of clinical data and facial photographs of EZH 2 mutation-positive individuals, we {{have shown that the}} facial features can be subtle and the clinical diagnosis of Weaver syndrome is thus challenging, especially in older individuals. However, tall stature is very common, reported in > 90 % of affected individuals. Intellectual disability is also common, present in ~ 80 %, but is highly variable and frequently mild. Additional clinical features which may help in stratifying individuals to EZH 2 mutation testing include camptodactyly, soft, doughy skin, umbilical hernia, and a low, hoarse cry. Considerable phenotypic overlap between <b>Sotos</b> and Weaver <b>syndromes</b> is also evident. The identification of an EZH 2 mutation can therefore provide an objective means of confirming a subtle presentation of Weaver syndrome and/or distinguishing Weaver and <b>Sotos</b> <b>syndromes.</b> As mutation testing becomes increasingly accessible and larger numbers of EZH 2 mutation-positive individuals are identified, knowledge of the clinical spectrum and prognostic implications of EZH 2 mutations should improve...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Overgrowth {{conditions}} are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterised by increased growth and variable features, including macrocephaly, distinctive facial appearance and {{various degrees of}} learning difficulties and intellectual disability. Among them, <b>Sotos</b> and Weaver <b>syndromes</b> are clinically well defined and due to heterozygous mutations in NSD 1 and EZH 2, respectively. NSD 1 and EZH 2 are both histone-modifying enzymes. These two epigenetic writers catalyse two specific post-translational modifications of histones: methylation of histone 3 lysine 36 (H 3 K 36) and lysine 27 (H 3 K 27). We postulated that mutations in writers of these two chromatin marks could cause overgrowth conditions, resembling <b>Sotos</b> or Weaver <b>syndromes,</b> in patients with no NSD 1 or EZH 2 abnormalities. METHODS: We analysed the coding sequences of 14 H 3 K 27 methylation-related genes and eight H 3 K 36 methylation-related genes using a targeted next-generation sequencing approach in three Sotos, 11 'Sotos-like' and two Weaver syndrome patients. RESULTS: We identified two heterozygous mutations in the SETD 2 gene in two patients with 'Sotos-like' syndrome: one missense p. Leu 1815 Trp de novo mutation in a boy and one nonsense p. Gln 274 * mutation in an adopted girl. SETD 2 is non-redundantly responsible for H 3 K 36 trimethylation. The two probands shared similar clinical features, including postnatal overgrowth, macrocephaly, obesity, speech delay and advanced carpal ossification. CONCLUSIONS: Our results illustrate the power of targeted next-generation sequencing to identify rare disease-causing variants. We provide a compelling argument for <b>Sotos</b> and Sotos-like <b>syndromes</b> as epigenetic diseases caused by loss-of-function mutations of epigenetic writers of the H 3 K 36 histone mark...|$|R
40|$|AbstractConventional {{karyotyping}} detects anomalies in 3 – 15 % {{of patients}} with multiple congenital anomalies and mental retardation (MCA/MR). Whole-genome array screening (WGAS) has been consistently suggested as the first choice diagnostic test for this group of patients, {{but it is very}} costly for large-scale use in developing countries. We evaluated the use of a combination of Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) kits to increase the detection rate of chromosomal abnormalities in MCA/MR patients. We screened 261 MCA/MR patients with two subtelomeric and one microdeletion kits. This would theoretically detect up to 70 % of all submicroscopic abnormalities. Additionally we scored the de Vries score for 209 patients in an effort to find a suitable cut-off for MLPA screening. Our results reveal that chromosomal abnormalities were present in 87 (33. 3 %) patients, but only 57 (21. 8 %) were considered causative. Karyotyping detected 15 abnormalities (6. 9 %), while MLPA identified 54 (20. 7 %). Our combined MLPA screening raised the total detection number of pathogenic imbalances more than three times when compared to conventional karyotyping. We also show that using the de Vries score as a cut-off for this screening would only be suitable under financial restrictions. A decision analytic model was constructed with three possible strategies: karyotype, karyotype + MLPA and karyotype + WGAS. Karyotype + MLPA strategy detected anomalies in 19. 8 % of cases which account for 76. 45 % of the expected yield for karyotype + WGAS. Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) of MLPA is three times lower than that of WGAS, which means that, for the same costs, we have three additional diagnoses with MLPA but only one with WGAS. We list all causative alterations found, including rare findings, such as reciprocal duplications of regions deleted in <b>Sotos</b> and Williams–Beuren <b>syndromes.</b> We also describe imbalances that were considered polymorphisms or rare variants, such as the new SNP that confounded the analysis of the 22 q 13. 3 deletion syndrome...|$|R

40|$|Fetal {{cerebral}} ventriculomegaly {{is defined}} as sonographically measured ventricular width of at least 10 mm in the atrium from 13 weeks of gestation till term, measured perpendicular to the long axis of the cerebral lateral ventricles. Our data are derived from the Center for Prenatal Diagnosis, Kurfürstendamm 199, Berlin. The fetuses were examined between 1 / 1 / 1998 and 7 / 31 / 2006. All ultrasound examinations were performed by gynecologists specialized in prenatal diagnosis. 27 645 fetuses were included referred for sonographic screening or in a minority of cases for suspected fetal malformations. In case of ventriculomegaly (VM), invasive testing and serologic screening {{for the detection of}} congenital infections were offered. Fetal VM was diagnosed in 252 cases. These cases were divided in two groups: VM of 10 to 14. 9 mm (group I) and VM of at least 15 mm (group II). Mild VM was defined as ventricular width of 10 - 12 mm. The rate of associated fetal malformations, chromosomal abnormalities and congenital infections was examined with respect to the degree of VM. There {{was no significant difference in}} the rate of chromosomal abnormalities in groups I and II (19. 4 vs. 18. 2 %, ns.). In group I 9. 2 % of fetuses showed trisomy 21 as most common chromosomal abnormality in this group whereas in group II trisomy 13 was most common. Structural chromosomal abnormalities were more common in group I (6 vs. 3 %) : The prevalence of VM was 0. 9 % in our study group and 0. 4 % for mild VM (10 - 12 mm). Associated malformations were detected in all cases but two, which showed <b>Sotos</b> and Goldenhar <b>syndrome</b> postnatally (2 / 109 not detected prenatally, 1. 8 %)) In group II associated malformations were diagnosed in 70 %, whereas this rate was 48 % in group I (p< 0, 005). There was a huge variety of accompanying CNS-malformations, the most common being neural tube defects (10 %), absent corpus callosum (7 %) and Dandy Walker malformation (6 %). The prevalence of congenital infections was as low as 0. 8 % (2 cases), both in group 2. There was no congenital infection in mild VM. Trisomy 21 was detected in 5 of 109 fetuses with mild VM, 4 of them showed additional softmarker for trisomy 21. In our cohort of 143 fetuses with trisomy 21, VM was diagnosed in 7 % (0. 9 % in normal fetuses). We conclude that in fetal ventriculomegaly the search for additional malformations and chromosomal abnormalities is advisable. Congenital infections should be ruled out though the prevalence is relatively low...|$|R

50|$|Mutations in the NSD1 gene cause <b>Sotos</b> <b>syndrome.</b> The NSD1 gene {{provides}} {{instructions for}} making a protein that is involved in normal growth and development. The function of this protein is unknown, however. In the Japanese population, the most common genetic change leading to <b>Sotos</b> <b>syndrome</b> deletes genetic material from the region of chromosome 5 containing the NSD1 gene. In other populations, small mutations within the NSD1 gene occur more frequently. Genetic changes involving the NSD1 gene prevent one copy of the gene from producing any functional protein. It is unclear how a reduced amount of this protein during development leads to learning disabilities, overgrowth, and the other features of <b>Sotos</b> <b>syndrome.</b>|$|E
50|$|It {{can present}} be {{in cases of}} Sensenbrenner syndrome, Crouzon syndrome, <b>Sotos</b> <b>syndrome,</b> as well as Marfan syndrome.|$|E
50|$|Bone age may be {{significantly}} advanced in genetic overgrowth syndromes, such as <b>Sotos</b> <b>syndrome,</b> Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and Marshall-Smith syndrome.|$|E
50|$|Examples of {{overgrowth}} syndromes include; Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Proteus syndrome, <b>Sotos</b> <b>syndrome,</b> neurofibromatosis, Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome, Weaver syndrome, Sturge-Weber syndrome, Macrocephaly-capillary malformation, CLOVES syndrome, fragile X {{syndrome and}} Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome.|$|E
50|$|Other signs include scoliosis, seizures, {{heart or}} kidney defects, hearing loss, and {{problems}} with vision. Some infants with this disorder experience jaundice and poor feeding. A {{small number of}} patients with <b>Sotos</b> <b>syndrome</b> have developed cancer, most often in childhood, but no single form of cancer {{has been associated with}} this condition. It remains uncertain whether <b>Sotos</b> <b>syndrome</b> increases the risk of specific types of cancer. If persons with this disorder have any increased cancer risk, their risk is only slightly greater than that of the general population.|$|E
50|$|Weaver {{syndrome}} and <b>Sotos</b> <b>syndrome</b> are often mistaken {{for one another}} due to their significant phenotypic overlap and similarities. Clinical features shared by both syndromes include overgrowth in early development, advanced bone age, developmental delay, and prominent macrocephaly. Mutations in the NSD1 gene may also be another cause for confusion. The NSD1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in normal growth and development. Deletions and mutations in the NSD1 gene is a common cause for patients with <b>Sotos</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{and in some cases}} for Weaver syndrome as well.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sotos</b> <b>syndrome</b> (cerebral {{gigantism}} or Sotos-Dodge syndrome) {{is a rare}} {{genetic disorder}} characterized by excessive physical growth during {{the first years of}} life. Excessive growth often starts in infancy and continues into the early teen years. The disorder may be accompanied by autism, mild intellectual disability, delayed motor, cognitive, and social development, hypotonia (low muscle tone), and speech impairments. Children with <b>Sotos</b> <b>syndrome</b> tend to be large at birth and are often taller, heavier, and have relatively large skulls (macrocephaly) than is normal for their age. Signs of the disorder, which vary among individuals, include a disproportionately large skull with a slightly protrusive forehead, large hands and feet, large mandible, hypertelorism (an abnormally increased distance between the eyes)(large inter-pupillary distance), and downslanting eyes. Clumsiness, an awkward gait, and unusual aggressiveness or irritability may also occur. Although most cases of <b>Sotos</b> <b>syndrome</b> occur sporadically, familial cases have also been reported. It is similar to Weaver syndrome.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sotos</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{is not a}} {{life-threatening}} disorder and patients may have a normal life expectancy. Developmental delays may improve in the school-age years; however, coordination problems may persist into adulthood, along with any learning disabilities and/or other physical or mental issues.|$|E
50|$|Features {{distinguishing}} Weaver syndrome from <b>Sotos</b> <b>syndrome</b> include broad {{forehead and}} face, ocular hypertelorism, prominent wide philtrum, micrognathia, deep-set nails, retrognathia with a prominent chin crease, increased prenatal growth, and a carpal bone age that is greatly advanced compared to metacarpal and phalangeal bone age.|$|E
50|$|Weaver {{syndrome}} (also called Weaver-Smith syndrome) is {{an extremely}} rare congenital disorder associated with rapid growth beginning in the prenatal period and continuing through the toddler and youth years. It is characterized by advanced osseous maturation, and distinctive craniofacial, skeletal, and neurological abnormalities. It was first described by Dr. David Weaver in 1974. It is similar to <b>Sotos</b> <b>syndrome.</b>|$|E
50|$|Naomichi Matsumoto (born August 3, 1961) is a Japanese {{physician}} and medical geneticist who identified several causative genes for human diseases, including <b>Sotos</b> <b>syndrome</b> (2002), Marfan syndrome type II (2004), Ohtahara syndrome (2008), West syndrome (2010), Microphthalmia with limb anomalies (2011), Autosomal-recessive cerebellar ataxias (2011), Hypomyelination with cerebellar atrophy and hypoplasia of the corpus callosum (HCAHC) (2011), Porencephaly (2012), and Coffin-Siris syndrome (2012).|$|E
50|$|Individuals with <b>Sotos</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{often have}} {{intellectual}} impairment, and most also have behavioral problems. Frequent behavioral impairments include {{attention deficit hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD), phobias, obsessions and compulsions, tantrums, and impulsive behaviors. Problems with speech and language are also common. Affected individuals may often have stuttering, difficulty with sound production, or a monotone voice. Additionally, weak muscle tone (hypotonia) may delay other aspects of early development, particularly motor skills such as sitting and crawling.|$|E
50|$|Perlman {{syndrome}} shares clinical {{overlaps with}} other overgrowth disorders, with similarities to Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome having been particularly emphasized in scientific study. Similarities with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome include polyhydramnios, macrosomia, nephromegaly and hypoglycaemia. It is the distinctive facial dysmorphology of Perlman, including deep-set eyes, depressed nasal bridge, everted upper lip, and macrocephaly {{which allows the}} two conditions to be distinguished from one another. Diagnosis of Perlman syndrome also overlaps with other disorders associated with Wilms tumor, namely, <b>Sotos</b> <b>syndrome</b> and Weaver syndrome.|$|E
50|$|Many genetic {{conditions}} {{are associated with}} macrocephaly, including familial macrocephaly related to the holgate gene, autism, PTEN mutations such as Cowden disease, neurofibromatosis type 1, and tuberous sclerosis; overgrowth syndromes such as <b>Sotos</b> <b>syndrome</b> (cerebral gigantism), Weaver syndrome, Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (bulldog syndrome), and macrocephaly-capillary malformation (M-CMTC) syndrome; neurocardiofacial-cutaneous syndromes such as Noonan syndrome, Costello syndrome, Gorlin Syndrome, (also known as Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome) and cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome; Fragile X syndrome; leukodystrophies (brain white matter degeneration) such as Alexander disease, Canavan disease, and megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts; and glutaric aciduria type 1 and D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} inversions known which {{are related to}} human disease.

More examples include Angelman syndrome and <b>Sotos</b> <b>syndrome.</b> However, recent research shows that one person can have 56 putative inversions, thus the non-disease inversions are more common than previously supposed. Also in this study it's indicated that inversion breakpoints are commonly associated with segmental duplications. One 900 kb inversion in the chromosome 17 is under positive selection and are predicted to increase its frequency in European population.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to advance {{understanding}} of the cognitive and behavioural profiles associated with <b>Sotos</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Specifically, {{the aim of this}} thesis was to establish the cognitive profile and whether autistic features are associated with <b>Sotos</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Initially, a systematic review of all published literature providing data on cognition and behaviour in <b>Sotos</b> <b>syndrome</b> was conducted. In general, research investigating cognition and behaviour in <b>Sotos</b> <b>syndrome</b> has been sporadic and much of the existing literature is based on small samples. The findings from the systematic review were used to inform the design of the research presented in the subsequent chapters. The studies reported within this thesis have used the largest samples to date to investigate cognition and behaviour in individuals with <b>Sotos</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Specifically, the findings demonstrate that <b>Sotos</b> <b>syndrome</b> is associated with a high prevalence of autistic features, as well as a clear and consistent cognitive profile. In particular, the <b>Sotos</b> <b>syndrome</b> cognitive profile is characterised by relative strength in verbal ability and visuospatial memory and relative weakness in non-verbal reasoning ability and quantitative reasoning. Furthermore, greater severity of autistic features is associated with lower intellectual ability for individuals with <b>Sotos</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Communicative difficulties are common in both adults and children with <b>Sotos</b> <b>syndrome</b> and individuals display difficulty with both structural and pragmatic aspects of language. Overall, the findings reported within this thesis advance understanding of the cognitive and behavioural phenotype of <b>Sotos</b> <b>syndrome</b> and have important implications for considering the syndrome-specific needs of these individuals...|$|E

Previous {{research suggests that}} <b>Sotos</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{may be associated with}} relative strength in verbal ability and relative weakness in non-verbal reasoning ability but this has not been explicitly assessed. To date, the cognitive profile of <b>Sotos</b> <b>syndrome</b> is unknown. Cognitive abilities of a large and representative sample of individuals with <b>Sotos</b> <b>syndrome</b> (N = 52) were assessed using the British Ability Scales (BAS 3). The majority of participants had intellectual disability or borderline intellectual functioning. The cluster score profile analysis revealed a consistent verbal ability > non-verbal reasoning ability profile. Four specific criteria were proposed as the <b>Sotos</b> <b>syndrome</b> cognitive profile (SSCP) : verbal ability > non-verbal reasoning ability; quantitative reasoning T-score or matrices T-score mean T-score. Of the 35 participants included in the profile analysis, 28 met all four SSCP criteria, yielding a sensitivity of 0. 8. The sensitivity of each of the SSCP criteria was > 0. 9. Individuals with <b>Sotos</b> <b>syndrome</b> display a clear and consistent cognitive profile, characterized by relative strength in verbal ability and visuospatial memory but relative weakness in non-verbal reasoning ability and quantitative reasoning.

40|$|<b>Sotos</b> <b>syndrome</b> is a {{childhood}} overgrowth syndrome characterized clinically by a distinctive facial gestalt, advanced bone age, childhood overgrowth, and non-progressive developmental delay; and genetically by haploinsufficiency of the Nuclear receptor binding SET Domain 1 (NSD 1) gene. Generalized lymphedema has not previously {{been associated with}} <b>Sotos</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Generalized lymphedema {{has been associated with}} mutations in several genes including FLT 4. This gene is involved in the regulation of VEGFR 3, a key governor of lymphatic-endothelial cell development and function.
