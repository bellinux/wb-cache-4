50|$|The Lake Station gas {{manufacturing}} plant on Lake Union {{was the largest}} private utility then existing in Seattle. It operated as “Seattle Lighting Company” until 1930, when the name was changed to “Seattle Gas Company”. Its primary product was illuminating gas (so-called because it was used for lighting) manufactured from coal. The gas was later also used for cooking, refrigeration, and heating homes and water. It was also called city gas to distinguish it from natural gas. The gas was made from coal up to 1937 when {{the high cost of}} operating the old coke oven and coal-gas generating sets forced a change-over to oil. A pair of oil-to-gas generators was built in 1937 and the old coal-gas facilities were disassembled. In 1946-47, two more oil gas generator pairs were constructed to keep up with demand for gas. Since by-products from gas manufacturing had strong markets of their own, new equipment was installed {{at the same time to}} produce “Gasco charcoal briquets”, toluene, <b>solvent</b> <b>naphtha,</b> sulfur, xylene, and resin tar.|$|R
40|$|Due to wide {{implementation}} of Epoxy insulators in industrial applications and its economic implications; development of various Epoxy insulator materials {{has to be}} evaluated along with a reliable prediction methodology of their lifetimes. In this study, a new methodology based on Artificial-Neural-Networks (ANN) is developed to predict Epoxy insulators lifetime using laboratory measurements of their surface leakage current under accelerated aging. The effect of adding fillers with various concentration rates to the Epoxy insulators such as; Calcium Silicate (CaSiO 2), Mica and Magnesium Oxide (Mg(OH) 2) on their lifetimes is compared with the base case (no filler and dry condition). Furthermore, the lifetime of each specimen under study is examined under various weather conditions such as dry, wet, salt wet (NaCl) and hydro carbon <b>solvent</b> <b>Naphtha.</b> The obtained results are weighing against the experimental measured data based on two ANN techniques; i. e., Feed-Forward-Neural-Network (FNN) and Recurrent-Neural-Network (RNN). The results obtained from the FNN and RNN are compared to validate the proposed methodology to predict the lifetime of epoxy insulators {{in terms of the}} type and percentage concentration of filler. The obtained Epoxy insulators predicted lifetime under various filler concentrations and weather conditions are compared and conclusions are reported...|$|R

2500|$|Following the {{invention}} of coal gas early in the 19th century, {{it was discovered that}} numerous organic and inorganic chemicals could be obtained when purifying the gas. Processes began to be developed to recover these, and a major branch of the British chemical industry – the coal tar and ammonia by-products industry – came into existence. By 1876 a nearby company, Burt, Boulton and Haywood of Silvertown, was distilling each year [...] of coal tar to manufacture ingredients for disinfectants, insecticides and dyes. Sulphur from the gas works was the raw material for local manufacturers of sulphuric acid needed by other nearby companies producing products such as fertilizers. Subsequently the GLCC decided that it would carry out the processing of by-products itself, rather than sell them to independent chemical companies. A purpose-built chemical works, Beckton Products Works, was constructed in 1879. It was the largest tar and ammonia by-products works in the UK, possibly in the world. Besides millions of gallons of road tar, products included phenol, the cresols and xylenols, naphthalene, pyridine bases, creosote, benzene, toluene, xylene, <b>solvent</b> <b>naphtha,</b> ammonium sulphate and ammonia solution, sulphuric acid, picolines, quinoline, quinaldine, acenaphthene, anthracene and dicyclopentadiene. Since the Products works was dependent on by-products of gas manufacture it could not long survive the introduction of natural gas. The last train carrying chemical products, a load of pitch, left the works on 1 June 1970.|$|R
40|$|Substitution of {{hazardous}} substances against less hazardous ones {{is a central}} requirement of the European Chemical Regulation REACH (European Regulation 1907 / 2006 /EC). Hazardous substances emitted from products may not only affect the worker; drift off and distribution in the environment may finally result in exposure of the general population. This potential threat to health is covered by the impact category “toxicity” in Life Cycle Assessments. In this paper, we present {{a case of a}} substitution of volatile organic compounds in a reactive varnish, and compare the “old” formulation with the “new” formulation against health risk to the worker, and concerning the Life Cycle Assessment impact category “toxicity”. The “old” formulation contained Naphtha (petroleum), hydrodesulfurized, heavy and <b>Solvent</b> <b>naphtha</b> (petroleum), light, aromatic. In the new formulation, both naphthas were replaced by n-Butylacetate, 1 -Ethoxy- 2 -propyl acetate and Ethyl- 3 -ethoxy propionate. In the European Union, the naphthas are classified as mutagens and carcinogens category 1, officially. However, if benzene is below 0. 1 %, registrants in the EU proposed to omit this classification, and todays naptha products on the market obviously have benzene contents below 0. 1 %. On a first glance, the improvement for workplace safety introduced by the substitution, therefore, is comparatively small, as it is for toxicity in Life Cycle Assessment. However, when background knowledge concerning chemical production processes of naphtha is included, benzene below a content of 0. 1 % needs to be taken into consideration, and the benefit of substitution is more obvious...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop and evaluate nanoemulsions for remediation of soil contaminated by petroleum, by using a commercial solvent Solbrax.

30|$|Isomalk- 4 SM is {{the process}} used for the {{isomerization}} of C 7 + hydrocarbons. In the process, a robust platinum-containing mixed metal oxide SI- 2 catalyst works effectively at lower temperature range of around 120 – 140  °C for LSRN isomerization. The yield of <b>naphtha</b> increases over <b>90</b>  wt% and with RON of about 95 – 98 using Isomalk- 4 SM. In addition, refiners can comprehend the maximum naphtha molecules, and reduce cracking and formation of benzene. The C 7 + stream is directed to Isomalk- 4 SM unit to attain the equilibrium quantity of di and trimethylbutanes, which have high-octane numbers [31]. The reformer’s feedstock is controlled to reduce the precursors of benzene, cracking, and hydro dealkylation reactions, thus increasing the RON and yield of the product. The basic configuration used in GTC is once-through isomerization and once-through with pre-feed deisopentanizer. Recycling of low-octane pentanes and hexanes and full recycling of all non-branched paraffin and pre-feed deisopentanizer.|$|R
