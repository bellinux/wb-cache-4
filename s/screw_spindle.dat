50|$|There were {{originally}} eight cams for forward motion and three for reverse, which gave {{a range of}} cut-offs from 15% to 85% in forward gear. The hand reversing <b>screw</b> <b>spindle</b> carried a disk, suitably notched with a locking device {{to ensure that the}} cam rollers would be in the centre of the selected cams under working conditions. During drifting, the reversing gear is placed in the neutral position where the exhaust valves are held fully open. These conditions were ideal for drifting and superior to any Walschaerts valve gear in admitting steam to the steam chests, even with cylinders equipped with by-pass valves, snifting valves and drifting valves.|$|E

The automatic compensation of the changes was proposed {{by means of a}} ball screw pretightening device by using adjustable force measurement and control. The detail design and simulation were conducted for the specific device. A case study was presented for the CNC lathe’s application. Testing results have shown that the device can be easily operated with an acceptable precision for positioning...|$|E
50|$|A {{screw pump}} is a positive-displacement (PD) pump that use one or several screws to move fluids or solids along the screw(s) axis. In its {{simplest}} form (the Archimedes' screw pump), a single screw rotates in a cylindrical cavity, thereby moving the material along the <b>screw's</b> <b>spindle.</b> This ancient construction is still {{used in many}} low-tech applications, such as irrigation systems and in agricultural machinery for transporting grain and other solids.|$|R

40|$|N. Mononobe and S. Okabe {{proposed}} the formula of the seismic earth pressure {{acting on the}} retaining wall by expanding Coulomb's and Rankine's Formula in 1924. Studies of seismic earth pressure have been attempted by many students but without experimental success so far. Lately, the measurements of active earth pressure during the vibration are carried our in out laboratory, using the shaking box (30 cm in depth, 56 cm in width, 100 cm in length) with the movable wall. The movable wall is supported by two rollers in vertical direction and four <b>screw</b> <b>spindles</b> in holizontal direction and is displaced with various kinds of displacement type by the rotation of handle. This results give us following suggestions : 1) The resultant force of the seismic active earth pressure are nearly constant {{in spite of the}} difference of displacement type of wall. 2) The internal friction angle of dry sand decrease at the rate of 2. 0 ～ 2. 5 degrees per increment of seismic coef. 0. 1 during vibration. 3) The redistribution of the earth pressure acting on the retaining wall is recognized...|$|R
40|$|The ball-screw {{feed drive}} has varying {{high-order}} dynamic characteristics due to flexibilities of the slender <b>screw</b> <b>spindle</b> and joints between components, and an obvious feature of non-collocated control when a direct position measurement using a linear scale is employed. The dynamic characteristics and non-collocated situation {{have long been}} the source of difficulties in motion and vibration control, and deteriorate the achieved accuracy of the axis motion. In this study, a dynamic model using a frequency-based substructure approach is established, considering the flexibilities and their variation. The position-dependent variation of the dynamic characteristics is then fully investigated. A corresponding control strategy, which is composed of a modal characteristic modifier (MCM) and an intelligent adaptive tuning algorithm (ATA), is then developed. The MCM utilizes a combination of peak filters and notch filters, thereby shaping the plant dynamics into a virtual collocated system and avoiding control spillover. An ATA using an artificial neural network (ANN) as a smooth parameter interpolator updates the parameters of the filters in real time in order to cope with the feed drive’s dynamic variation. Numerical verification of the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed strategy is shown for a real feed drive...|$|E

50|$|The {{machinery}} for projecting and withdrawing the {{torpedo tube}} {{consists of a}} couple of chain drums worked by gearing which is driven by a rotary engine made by Root, New York, NY. One of these drums is placed in the tank or reservoir in the bows of the vessel, and the chain from it is used for hauling in the tube. In order to prevent the chain from overriding on the drum, it is guided by passing through a suitable block which, as the drum revolves, is moved transversely along the drum and deposits the chain in regular coils. The transverse movement of the guiding block is given by a <b>screwed</b> <b>spindle</b> which has a pinion fixed on it gearing into a spur wheel on the chain drum. The hauling out of the torpedo carrier is effected by means of a chain attached to its inner end and led to the second chain drum which is placed above and slightly abaft the tank, as shown in Fig. 2. The arrangement adopted for guiding the chain is the same in this case as in that of the hauling-in drum. Each drum is loose upon its shaft, but is capable of being connected to it by a clutch, the two clutches being connected by levers {{so that they can be}} thrown into gear alternately. The tube can be run in and out by the machinery we have described at the rate of from 8 to 12 double strokes per minute.|$|R

500|$|Certain {{techniques}} and styles {{can be found}} throughout Nine Inch Nails' catalog. Songs such as [...] "Wish", and [...] "The Day the World Went Away" [...] exhibit terraced dynamics. Reznor's singing follows a similar pattern, frequently moving from whispers to screams. He also has used software to alter his voice in several songs, as evident in [...] "Starfuckers, Inc." [...] and [...] "Burn". The band's music also occasionally contains complex time signatures, notably in [...] "The Collector", from With Teeth, and concert favorite [...] "March of the Pigs". Reznor regularly uses noise and distortion in his song arrangements, and incorporates dissonance with chromatic melody and/or harmony. These techniques are all used in the song [...] "Hurt", which contains a highly dissonant tritone played on guitar during the verses, a B5#11, emphasized when Reznor sings the eleventh note on the word [...] "I" [...] every time the B/E# dyad is played. [...] "Closer" [...] concludes with a chromatic piano motif: The melody is debuted during the second verse of [...] "Piggy" [...] on organ, then reappears in power chords at drop D tuning throughout the chorus of [...] "Heresy", while an inverted (ascending) version is used throughout [...] "A Warm Place", and then recurs in its original state for the final time on [...] "The Downward Spiral". On The Fragile, Reznor revisits this technique of repeating a motif multiple times throughout different songs, either on a different musical instrument, with a transposed harmony, or in an altered tempo. Many of the songs on Year Zero contain an extended instrumental ending, which encompasses the entire {{second half of the}} three-minute long [...] "The Great Destroyer".

50|$|A {{differential}} screw is {{a mechanism}} used for making small, precise {{adjustments to the}} spacing between two objects (such as in focusing a microscope, moving the anvils of a micrometer, or positioning optics). A differential <b>screw</b> uses a <b>spindle</b> with two <b>screw</b> threads of differing leads (aka thread pitch), and possibly opposite handedness, on which two nuts move. As the spindle rotates, {{the space between the}} nuts changes based on the difference between the threads. These mechanisms allow extremely small adjustments using commonly available screws. A differential screw mechanism using two nuts incurs higher friction and therefore requires more torque to turn than a simple, single lead screw with an equivalent pitch.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{variability}} in yield oxidative status and appearance of palm oils as affected by fruit type and extraction equipment in the small scale industry. A 23 factorial experimental design with palm fruit types Dura and Tenera and extraction equipment digester <b>screw</b> hand <b>spindle</b> and hydraulic presses were studied. Quality indices of oils i. e. free fatty acid ffa peroxide value moisture content impurities colour and yield were accessed using standard methods. The ffa values obtained for oils produced from both Dura and Tenera fruit types and the extraction equipment ranged 5. 25 - 5. 71 were above the CODEX standard of 5. 0. Furthermore significant differences were also recorded in both moisture contents and impurities from the same oils produced. The oil yield from Tenera fruit types were two folds higher than the Dura fruit types. The redness colour of palm oils for Dura fruit types was a little above the Tenera fruit types. However the yellowness and lightness of colour of palm oils for Tenera were higher than oils from Dura fruit types. Therefore the study concludes that the oil processors in the small scale industry preferred the digester screw press machine because it gave low level of impurities and moisture content than other presses. Tenera fruit type is {{the best choice for}} palm oil processing because of its higher oil yield content. However in terms of oil colour Dura fruit type is preferred...|$|R
40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{approach has}} been developed to determine the optical orientation of biaxial minerals by combining spindle stage and X-ray-diffractometer measurements. First, a goniometer head, with crystal affixed, is <b>screwed</b> onto a <b>spindle</b> stage, and its orientation matrix for the biaxial indicatrix is determined. Next, the same goniometer head is transferred to a single-crystal X-ray diffractometer, where the unit cell and, in turn, an orientation matrix for the reciprocal crystallographic axes are determined. The necessary transformations and calculations are then developed to relate these two orientation matrices mathematically. Examples for two orthorhombic minerals of known optical orientation, one monoclinic mineral of unknown optical orientation, and one triclinic mineral of known optical orientation are given. Several measurements were repeated to test the accuracy, reproducibility, and systematic errors of the method; these measurements yielded an accuracy and reproducibility of the method to within 1. 0 °. Once a suitable crystal has been selected and mounted on a goniometer head, all the required measurements and calculations can be performed in approximately one hour...|$|R
