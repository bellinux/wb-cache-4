2500|$|An {{appearance}} by Little River Band, scheduled for 12 January 2015 on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, was cancelled after complaints from earlier members concerning its promotion as a 40th anniversary performance. Permission for any songs written by Birtles, Briggs, Goble or Shorrock was refused. “We’ve just {{had enough of}} it,” Original Lead singer Glenn Shorrock said. “They’ve been living off our coat-tails for years.” [...] "They are promoting a newly recorded album of their own material, or whatever material they have got. They <b>should</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> rather than pretend they are the band that sold 30 million albums." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, Reddy {{decided to}} return to {{performing}} after being buoyed by the warm reception she received when she sang at her sister's 80th birthday party. [...] "I hadn't heard my voice in 10 years, and when I heard it coming over the speaker, it was like: 'Oh, that’s not bad. Maybe I <b>should</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> again,'" [...] Reddy explained in 2013. On 12 July 2012, Reddy returned to the musical stage at Croce's Jazz Bar in San Diego and for a benefit concert for the arts at St. Genevieve High School in Panorama City, a neighborhood of Los Angeles. Reddy also sang a duet ("You're Just in Love") with senior choir member Rosalind Smith.|$|E

6000|$|Her {{answer was}} unexpected. [...] "You once spoke {{of getting a}} {{transfer}} to a forest near Denver. If you <b>should</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> you might see me occasionally--for I may make my home in Colorado Springs." ...|$|E

6000|$|Mrs. Brook, as {{a result}} of thinking, {{appeared}} for a little to demur. [...] "Yes--but one mustn't be too much driven to it. It's by one's sympathies that one suffers. If you <b>should</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> I couldn't bear it." ...|$|E
