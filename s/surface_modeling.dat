Using a 2 -D(Dimensional) surface fitting approach, the general {{behavior of the}} solar radiation in a year is modeled. By {{the help of the}} newly adopted visualization approach, a total of 9 analytical <b>surface</b> <b>models</b> are obtained and compared.

When the sensor data are obtained from fixed sensors, the problem of occlusion arises. To overcome occlusion, sensors may be mounted on a robot that moves the sensors over the surface. In this thesis the sensors are single-point range finders. The range finders provide a set of sensor points, that is, the surface points detected by the sensors. The sets of sensor points obtained during the robot's motion are used to construct a <b>surface</b> <b>model.</b> The <b>surface</b> <b>model</b> is used in turn in the computation of the robot's motion, so <b>surface</b> <b>modelling</b> is performed on-line, that is, the <b>surface</b> <b>model</b> is constructed incrementally from the sensor points as they are obtained.

This classification step depends on the measured parameters of the particular test bone. In case all parameters of a test bone were covered by the training population's parameter ranges, this bone is classified as normal bone, otherwise as outlier bone. Our experimental results showed that statistically {{there was no significant difference}} between the morphometric parameters extracted from the reconstructed <b>surface</b> <b>models</b> of the normal cases and those extracted from the reconstructed <b>surface</b> <b>models</b> of the outliers.
