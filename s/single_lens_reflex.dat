25|$|In 1981, Sony {{unveiled}} the first consumer camera {{to use a}} charge-coupled device for imaging, {{eliminating the need for}} film: the Sony Mavica. While the Mavica saved images to disk, the images were displayed on television, and the camera was not fully digital. In 1991, Kodak {{unveiled the}} DCS 100, the first commercially available digital <b>single</b> <b>lens</b> <b>reflex</b> camera. Although its high cost precluded uses other than photojournalism and professional photography, commercial digital photography was born.|$|E
25|$|The reflex design {{scheme is}} the primary {{difference}} between a DSLR and other digital cameras. In the reflex design scheme, the image captured on the camera's sensor is also the image that is seen through the view finder. Light travels through a single lens and a mirror is used to reflect a portion of that light through the view finder – hence the name <b>Single</b> <b>Lens</b> <b>Reflex.</b> While there are variations among point-and-shoot cameras, the typical design exposes the sensor constantly to the light projected by the lens, allowing the camera's screen {{to be used as}} an electronic viewfinder. However, LCDs can be difficult to see in very bright sunlight.|$|E
2500|$|The age of {{the citizen}} {{journalist}} and the providing of news photos by amateur bystanders {{have contributed to the}} art of [...] photojournalism. Paul Levinson attributes this shift to the Kodak camera, one of the first cheap and accessible photo technologies that [...] "put a piece of visual reality into every person's potential grasp." [...] The empowered news audience {{with the advent of the}} Internet sparked the creation of blogs, podcasts and online news, independent of the traditional outlets, and [...] "for the first time in our history, the news increasingly is produced by companies outside journalism". Dan Chung, a former photojournalist for The Guardian and Reuters, believes that professional photojournalists will have to adapt to video to make a living. Most digital <b>single</b> <b>lens</b> <b>reflex</b> bodies are being equipped with video capabilities.|$|E
50|$|Miranda {{cameras were}} {{a line of}} quality 35mm <b>single</b> <b>lens</b> <b>reflexes,</b> a range of over 30 models between first prototypes in 1953 through to the last {{production}} model in 1978. Many had advanced or sophisticated features for their day. Almost all Miranda SLR's shared the same basic lens mount, but the mount complexity increased {{over the years to}} accommodate more aperture and metering controls.|$|R
50|$|In 1957, {{the family}} moved to Miami with the hope of a new start in United States. It was during this time that Thoen first became {{interested}} in photography.

2500|$|In 1934, {{with part of}} Horace Latimer's bequest the Boston Camera Club {{purchased}} a building at nearby 351A Newbury Street, Back Bay. The club occupied three floors. There were a large and small exhibition gallery, darkroom, library and kitchen. Public exhibitions of photography resumed. [...] For tax purposes, in 1946 the club decided to sell no. 351A and remain in the building as a lessee. [...] Growth continued apace, reaching 555 in 1959492 regular, 51 associate and 4 honorary membersa level maintained for some two decades. Besides post-war prosperity, the growth is attributable to introduction of 35mm film by Kodak in the 1930s, and <b>single</b> <b>lens</b> <b>reflex</b> (SLR) 35mm cameras by Nikon, Pentax {{and others in the}} 1960s, for which enthusiasts often sought instruction by joining a camera club.|$|E
