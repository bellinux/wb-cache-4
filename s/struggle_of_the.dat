5|$|In October 1942, Popovac {{issued an}} appeal to Muslim Partisans, urging them to join the Chetniks and turn against the Ustaše. In a report to Mihailović dated 3 November, Popovac wrote:I have to {{emphasize}} to you the intimate cooperation between the Muslims and Orthodox in the Stolac district from where, through the joint <b>struggle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Muslims and Orthodox, the Croat inhabitants, who were largely Ustaša-inclined, have been expelled.

5|$|The {{implementation}} of the immense task of reconstructing the country was accompanied by the <b>struggle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new government to acquire centralized authority, further complicated by the mistrust a considerable part of society held for the new regime and by disputes over Poland's postwar borders, which were not firmly established until mid-1945. In 1947 Soviet pressure caused the Polish government to reject the American-sponsored Marshall Plan, and to join the Soviet Union-dominated Comecon in 1949. The Soviet forces present engaged in plunder of the former eastern territories of Germany which were being transferred to Poland, stripping it of valuable industrial equipment, infrastructure and factories and sending them to the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Under John Kourkouas, the Byzantines {{conquered the}} emirate of Melitene, along with Tarsos the strongest of the Muslim border emirates, and {{advanced}} into Armenia in the 930s; {{the next three}} decades were dominated by the <b>struggle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Phokas clan and their dependants against the Hamdanid emir of Aleppo, Sayf al-Dawla. Al-Dawla was finally defeated by Nikephoros II Phokas, who conquered Cilicia and northern Syria and recovered Crete. His nephew and successor, John I Tzimiskes, pushed even further south, almost reaching Jerusalem, but his death in 976 ended Byzantine expansion towards Palestine.|$|E

25|$|Trotskyists {{differ on}} the extent to which this is true today, but even the most {{orthodox}} tend to recognise in the late twentieth century a new development in <b>the</b> revolts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rural poor, <b>the</b> self-organising <b>struggles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> landless, and many other struggles which in some ways reflect the militant united organised <b>struggles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> working class, and which to various degrees do not bear <b>the</b> marks <b>of</b> class divisions typical <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heroic peasant <b>struggles</b> <b>of</b> previous epochs. However, orthodox Trotskyists today still argue that the town and city based working class struggle is central to <b>the</b> task <b>of</b> a successful socialist revolution, linked to these <b>struggles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rural poor. They argue that the working class learns of necessity to conduct a collective struggle, for instance in trade unions, arising from its social conditions in the factories and workplaces, and that the collective consciousness it achieves as a result is an essential ingredient <b>of</b> <b>the</b> socialist reconstruction <b>of</b> society.|$|R

5|$|Wadzeks Kampf mit der Dampfturbine (Wadzek's Struggle {{with the}} Steam Turbine) is a 1918 comic novel by the German author Alfred Döblin. Set in Berlin, it narrates the futile and often {{delusional}} <b>struggle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eponymous industrialist Wadzek against Rommel, his more powerful competitor. In its narrative technique and {{its refusal to}} psychologize its characters, {{as well as in}} its vivid evocations of Berlin as a modern metropolis, Wadzeks Kampf mit der Dampfturbine has been read as a precursor to Döblin's better-known 1929 novel Berlin Alexanderplatz.|$|E
5|$|From {{its origin}} as a {{city-state}} {{on the peninsula}} of Italy in the 8th century BC, to its rise as an empire covering much of Southern Europe, Western Europe, Near East and North Africa to its fall in the 5th century AD, the political history of Ancient Rome was closely entwined with its military history. The core of the campaign history of the Roman military is an aggregate of different accounts of the Roman military's land battles, from its initial defense against and subsequent conquest of the city's hilltop neighbors on the Italian peninsula, to the ultimate <b>struggle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Western Roman Empire for its existence against invading Huns, Vandals and Germanic tribes. These accounts were written by various authors throughout and after {{the history of the}} Empire. Following the First Punic War, naval battles were less significant than land battles to the military history of Rome due to its encompassment of lands of the periphery and its unchallenged dominance of the Mediterranean Sea.|$|E
5|$|On {{the day of}} the Axis {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union, the Executive Committee of the Communist Internationalheadquartered in Moscowtelegraphed the Central Committee of the KPJ to take all measures to support and alleviate the <b>struggle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet people, and to organise partisan detachments to fight the Axis in Yugoslavia. The Executive Committee also stressed that the fight, at the current stage, should not be about socialist revolution, but about the liberation from the Axis occupiers. In response to this appeal, the leaders of the KPJ decided on 4July in Belgrade to launch a nationwide armed uprising, which began three days later in western Serbia. The members of the KPJ-led forces were called Partisans, and their supreme commander was Tito. On 13July, in Sarajevo, the KPJ Provincial Committee for Bosnia-Herzegovina, headed by Svetozar Vukmanović, organised the province into military regions: Bosanska Krajina, Herzegovina, Tuzla, and Sarajevo.|$|E

5|$|The {{food supply}} of the country {{depended}} on cereals produced in southern Russia, while the Finns had specialized in milk and butter production. The cessation of the cereal imports from disintegrating Russia led to food shortages in Finland. The Senate responded by introducing rationing and price controls. The farmers opposed the state control; a black market with sharply rising food prices formed and export to free market of the Petrograd area increased. Food supply, prices, {{and in the end}} the fear of starvation became emotional political issues between farmers and industrial workers, in particular the unemployed ones. The common people, their fears exploited by the politicians and the political media, took to the streets. Despite the food shortages, no large-scale starvation hit southern Finland before the civil war and the food market remained a secondary stimulator in the power <b>struggle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Finnish state.|$|E
5|$|During the Italian campaign, and afterwards, {{during the}} <b>struggle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Papal Curia with Frederick, Manuel tried to seduce the Popes with hints of a {{possible}} union between the Eastern and Western churches. Although in 1155 Pope Hadrian had expressed his eagerness to prompt the reunion of the churches, hopes for a lasting Papal-Byzantine alliance came up against insuperable problems. Pope Adrian IV and his successors demanded recognition of their religious authority over all Christians everywhere and sought superiority over the Byzantine Emperor; they were not at all willing to fall {{into a state of}} dependence from one emperor to the other. Manuel, on the other hand, wanted an official recognition of his secular authority over both East and West. Such conditions would not be accepted by either side. Even if a pro-western Emperor such as Manuel agreed, the Greek citizens of the empire would have rejected outright any union of this sort, as they did almost three hundred years later when the Orthodox and Catholic churches were briefly united under the Pope. In spite of his friendliness towards the Roman Church and his cordial relations with all the Popes, Manuel was never honoured with the title of Augustus by the Popes. And although he twice sent embassies to Pope Alexander III (in 1167 and 1169) offering to reunite the Greek and Latin churches, the Pope refused, under pretext of the troubles that would follow union.* J. W. Birkenmeier, The Development of the Komnenian Army, 114 Ultimately, a deal proved elusive, and the two churches have remained divided.|$|E
5|$|To an extent, the Arab–Khazar wars {{were also}} {{linked to the}} <b>struggle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Caliphate against the Byzantine Empire along the eastern fringes of Asia Minor, a theatre of war which adjoined the Caucasus. The Byzantine {{emperors}} pursued close relations with the Khazars, which amounted to a virtual alliance {{for most of the}} period in question, including such exceptional acts as the marriage of emperor Justinian II (r. 685–695; 705–711) to a Khazar princess in 705. The possibility of the Khazars linking up with the Byzantines through Armenia was a grave threat to the Caliphate, especially given its proximity to the Umayyad metropolitan province of Syria. This did not materialize, and Armenia was left largely quiet, with the Umayyads granting it wide-ranging autonomy and the Byzantines likewise refraining from active campaigning there. Indeed, given the common threat posed by the Khazar raids, the Umayyads found the Armenians (and the neighbouring Georgians) willing allies against the Khazars. Although some Byzantinists, notably Dimitri Obolensky, suggested that the Arab–Khazar wars were motivated by a Muslim desire to outflank the Byzantine defences from the north, this idea is not borne out by the limited nature of the conflict until the 720s. It is more probable that the Byzantines encouraged the Khazars to attack the Caliphate to relieve the mounting pressure on their own eastern frontier in the early 8th century, as indeed they profited considerably from the diversion of the Muslim armies northwards in the 720s and 730s, resulting in another alliance through marriage, between the future emperor Constantine V (r. 741–775) and the Khazar princess Tzitzak in 733.|$|E
