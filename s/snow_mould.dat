The results indicate that despite differences in winter hardiness between the three amphidiploid cultivars, the mean winter hardiness of androgenic progeny from each cultivar was the same.

40|$|Disease {{infection}} {{in relation to}} sowing time of winter rye (Secale cereale) was studied in southern Finland in order to compare overwintering capacity of modern rye varieties and to give recommendations for rye cultivation. This was done by using three sowing times and four rye varieties in field trials conducted at three locations in 1999 – 2001. The early sown rye (beginning of August) was severely affected by diseases caused by Puccinia recondita and Microdochium nivale, whereas postponing sowing for {{two weeks after the}} recommended sowing time resulted in considerably less infection. The infection levels of diseases differed among rye varieties. Finnish rye varieties Anna and Bor 7068 were more resistant to <b>snow</b> <b>mould</b> and more winter hardy than the Polish variety Amilo, or the German hybrid varieties Picasso and Esprit. However, Amilo was the most resistant to leaf rust.

40|$|Lack of {{resistance}} to pink <b>snow</b> <b>mould</b> (Microdochium nivale) is a major constraint for adaptation of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) to continental regions with long-lasting snow cover at higher latitudes. Almost all investigations of genetic variation in resistance have been performed using cold acclimated plants.

In this study {{our aim was to}} identify candidate genes involved in such resistance mechanisms. We first characterized variation in resistance to M. nivale among non-acclimated genotypes from the Norwegian cultivar ‘Fagerlin’ based on relative regrowth and fungal quantification by real-time qPCR. One resistant and one susceptible genotype were selected for transcriptome analysis using paired-end sequencing by Illumina Hiseq 2000. Transcriptome profiles, GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis indicate that defense response related genes are differentially expressed between the resistant and the susceptible genotype. A significant up-regulation of defense related genes, as well as genes involved in cell wall cellulose metabolic processes and aryl-alcohol dehydrogenase (NADP+) activity, was observed in the resistant genotype.

40|$|Microdochium nivale causes pink <b>snow</b> <b>mould</b> {{disease that}} damages forage grasses (especially {{perennial}} ryegrass) covered by snow, particularly in late winter. This makes {{the survival of}} perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.), which is an economically important forage grass in Europe, difficult. Resistance mechanisms against pink <b>snow</b> <b>mould</b> disease is not fully understood. Thus, {{to gain a better}} understanding of resistance mechanisms in perennial ryegrass, we investigated variation in resistance among L. perenne genotypes, measured as relative regrowth after inoculation with several M. nivale isolates, and conducted a global transcriptome study of resistant and susceptible genotypes using an RNA sequencing approach. Ten genotypes, 8 from the Norwegian cultivar genotypes Fagerlin and 2 from the European cultivar Picaro, were used in this study. Clones of ten genotypes were inoculated with M. nivale isolates and incubated in darkness at 2 °C for 5 - 12 weeks. Relative regrowth was calculated as the ratio of the regrowth of inoculated and non-inoculated plants after 5, 8 and 12 weeks of incubation. Based on relative regrowth one ‘resistant’ genotype (M) and one ‘susceptible’ genotype (F) were selected for transcriptome studies. Total RNA was extracted from the leaf blade tissue of plants exposed to three different treatments: non-inoculated and non-incubated plants (non-incubated control), non-inoculated plants after 4 days of incubation (incubated control), and inoculated plants after 4 days of incubation (inoculated). There were two biological replicates of each genotype and treatment (totally 12 samples). cDNA libraries were prepared and paired-end sequencing was performed using Illumina Hiseq 2000. Before sequencing, qPCR was performed with the candidate gene PR- 5 (thaumatin-like protein), a gene which is expressed in response to pathogen attack. The results indicate that there is significant variation among M and F genotypes during 0 day and the 4 th day. Higher transcript levels of PR- 5 were observed in both non-incubated control (0 day) and inoculated (4 th day) plants of the ‘resistant’ M genotype than in the ‘susceptible’ F genotype. This variation in the expression of PR- 5 indicates that the two selected genotypes are different in respect to resistance against pink <b>snow</b> <b>mould,</b> and that they are suitable for being used for global RNA sequencing. De-novo assembly was done using the Trinity software platform. A total number of 188, 355 and 261, 978 assembled contigs with N 50 values of 1, 672 and 1, 784 bp were generated from the “M” and “F” genotypes, respectively. Mapping was done by aligning the reads back to the assemble contigs using the Bowtie program and then transcript abundance was estimated by RSEM. Using EdgeR, differential expression analysis of read counts was done. A total number of 7, 282 and 19, 055 significantly differentially expressed (DE) genes were detected between non-incubated control and inoculated (incubated at 2 °C), 6, 227 and 19, 832 DE genes were detected between non-incubated control and non-inoculated plants, and 275 and 83 DE genes were detected between inoculated and non-inoculated plants of the “M” and “F” genotypes, respectively. In this study we mainly focused on gene expression in inoculated and non-inoculated incubated plants as they were treated under the same conditions, i. e. incubation in darkness. DE genes from the ‘resistant’ (M) genotype and from the ‘susceptible’ (F) genotype were blasted and annotated against the NCBI non-redundant database using Blast 2 go program. The annotation results gave us about various genes that are differentially expressed at various stress factors. Further detailed studies on these genes will help us to understand the interactions between perennial ryegrass plants and M. nivale and also provied information that can be used to develop cultivars with improved resistance against pink <b>snow</b> <b>mould</b> by studying expressions of various defence related genes...|$|E

EFsymbIBP is 53, 38 % identical to the IBP from the Flavobacteriaceae bacterium strain 3519 - 10, isolated from the glacial ice of the Lake Vostok. EFsymbAFP and EFsymbIBP are 31, 73 % identical at the amino acid level and are organised in tandem on the bacterial chromosome.

The rhizosphere microflora {{and its impact on}} plant growth is in many respects still unexplored, and biocontrol is part of a growing research area called 'plant-microbe interactions'. The aim {{of this study was to}} find bacterial isolates that were able to suppress wheat (Triticum aestivum) diseases caused by Fusarium spp. and Microdochium nivale. A special challenge was the <b>snow</b> <b>mould</b> disease, which brought about the low temperature approach used in this work. Psychrotrophic bacteria were isolated at + 1. 5 °C and 598 isolates were screened in a field-correlated greenhouse bioassay, out of which 163 were tested for disease suppression under field conditions (I). In field experiments during five consecutive years biocontrol of wheat seedling blight, caused by F. culmorum and M. nivale was in many cases as effective as the fungicide (guazatine acetate) control. Three isolates suppressed <b>snow</b> <b>mould</b> in winter wheat and brought about an average yield increase of 1450 kg/ha (I). Of special interest was how selection during the isolation of bacteria could affect the proportion of isolates with disease suppressiveness (II). The isolates were grouped and analysed in search for isolation factors that had a propitious effect on the isolation frequency of such isolates. In total, 30 groups were defined. The colony morphology of the isolates, which is a crude reflection of bacterial species or group, was also analysed. An unexpected discovery was that there was a higher frequency of potential biocontrol agents isolated from plants of the Brassicaceae family. A morphological group containing 56 highly disease-suppressive Isolates having characteristic Optically Denser Spots in their colonies were found and denoted IODS. Members of this group have similar in vitro inhibition spectra of pathogens and produce an antifungal polyketide (DDR) (II, III). A second aim was to identify the mode of action of isolates with disease-suppressive ability. One of the IODS, strain MF 381 produced DDR, pyrrolnitrin, and a novel antibiotic named pseudotrienic acid A (III). In other strains, metabolites such as massetolide and viscosin were found (II). One of the strains (MF 30) had a high disease-suppressive effect against F. oxysporum f. sp. radicis lycopersici causing wilt in tomato. Results by other authors indicate that MF 30 induces plant resistance by means of bacterial lipopolysaccarides through the ISR pathway (IV; Konnova et al. 1999).

The profile of the restriction digestion of the amplified ITS region revealed that all the M. nivale isolates analysed belonged to var. nivale. RAPD profiling and RFLP analyses of the IGS regions of rDNA revealed extensive genetic diversity within var. nivale. With RAPD markers, the average similarity coefficient was 66 % and the estimate of genotypic diversity was 0 � 179. Population subdivision analysis showed that 92 � 2 % of the total genetic diversity was found among individuals within populations compared to 7 � 8 % among populations. In dendrograms derived from genetic distances using RAPD and IGS-RFLP markers, there was some evidence for host specialization. Most RAPD markers were shared by individuals from different turfgrasses, and the populations were not highly differentiated.

40|$|Several {{species of}} Typhula cause {{diseases}} of cereals and grasses at low temperatures. Taxonomic separation of T. phacorrhiza, T. incarnata and T. ishikariensis was investigated using RAPD, ITS-RFLP and nucleotide sequencing of the ITS region. Using 10 RAPD primers on genomic DNA or eight restriction enzymes on PCR-amplified ITS regions, banding patterns were generated {{for each of}} 19 isolates from five species or varieties. Polymorphisms were found between species and varieties, with fewer among isolates within species or varieties. RAPD analysis suggested that T. ishikariensis var. idahoensis may be distinct from the other varieties (var. ishikariensis and var. canadensis), although this was not supported by ITS-RFLP. To confirm relationships, ITS nucleotides were obtained from single isolates {{of each of the}} five Typhula taxa, and sequence alignments were subjected to distance and parsimony analysis. Although there were differences in branching between dendrograms derived from sequencing vs. RAPD or ITS-RFLP, sequence data supported the distinction of the three main Typhula species, with the T. ishikariensis varieties grouping together and showing differences at an infraspecific level. ITS sequence data also indicated the closer taxonomic affinity of Typhula species to the agaricoid Tricholoma sejunctum compared to the clavarioid Thelephora terrestris. Several species of Typhula are pathogens of grasses and cereals. Typhula phacorrhiza Reichard, the type species of Typhula (Remsberg, 1940), occurs in northern temperate zones.

This thesis investigated the fate and behaviour of three microbial model control agents with effect against fungal pathogens in cropping systems, and the spread of one of the model strains in bioaerosols. The bacterium Pseudomonas brassicacearum MA 250 was monitored in winter wheat systems, in a climate chamber trial and in field conditions. The contribution of strain MA 250 to the total microbial load in bioaerosols was also investigated. Two filamentous fungi, Hypocrea parapilulifera IMI 206039 and Trichoderma atroviride IMI 206040, were investigated on a golf green and in microcosms with soil sampled from the green and with agricultural soil. To track and enumerate the applied strains, intrinsic strain-specific sequence-characterised amplified region (SCAR) markers were utilised in quantitative real-time PCR. Supplementary methods, such as cultivation-based methods and analysis of the Gram-negative bacterial cell constituent endotoxin, were also included. In both winter wheat studies, MA 250 colonised the roots of healthy seedlings. Withered seedlings that had died due to <b>snow</b> <b>mould</b> infection were not colonised, indicating the importance of a healthy seedling for proliferation of MA 250. In the microcosm studies, with the two fungal biocontrol strains, populations of introduced cells behaved differently depending on the soil. On the golf green, the two fungal biocontrol strains were detected only sporadically, but nevertheless maintained their control effect. In the bioaerosol study, the SCAR marker consistently enabled detection of strain MA 250, whereas other methods tested did not. The results showed that MA 250 significantly contributed to the total microbial load in aerosols after 60 minutes of coating, when MA 250 was added to the system. However, after 240 minutes of coating this significant increase was not seen and MA 250 could only be detected against the background with use of the SCAR marker. In conclusion, the use of strain-specific SCAR markers proved a reliable method in quantifying added populations in soils, plants and aerosols. This type of information is valuable for optimising the use of the biocontrol microorganisms and to determine the risks associated with application of the strains...|$|E

Reactions of sorts of winter wheat to Fusarium culmorum were tested in the field trials inoculated with conidial suspension during 1994 and 1995. At the turn of 1995 was proved influence of fungicides on the yield of winter wheat inoculated with the same pathogen. In the investigated and the possibility of chemical protection was veryfied. Also the attack of germinated kernels was evaluated and influence of fungicides for protection of seed in laboratory conditions was tested. From above mentioned results there are following successive conclusions: 1. Sorts of winter wheat Alka, Ilona and Hana show good tolerance against Fusarium head blight. 2. Application of effective fungicides expressively decreases attack by Fusasrium head blight. In the trials very good effect proved fungicides Sportak 45 EC, Opus and Tango, but too Alert, Alto Combi 420 SC and Folicur Plus 375 EC. 3. Very good results were achieved with application of reduced doses of the fungicides. This is very interesting from the economic and ecologic point of view too. 4. In regions with long-term of snow cover it is better to grow sorts with higher tolerance against fusarioses, respectively <b>snow</b> <b>mould.</b> In the trials the best result achieved German sort of winter wheat Trane. 5. Application of the fungicides against fusarioses during dormancy is unnecessary. 6. In all casses is very advantageous the seed treatment. As fungicid with the highest effect against fusarioses was evaluated Prelude SP WS. The resistance to infection by Fusaria is polygenic and breeding for resistance is rather difficult. Creation of resistant (or tolerant) genotypes is not very effective from the short-term point of view. For successful protection greater attention must be paid to the study of pathogen biology in order to eliminate its spreading. Use of newly - developed diagnostic methods can also help to determine real seed contamination. The knowledge obtained in this way is utilized for correct establishment of growth, good chice of growing regions and varietiesAvailable from STL Prague, CZ / NTK - National Technical LibrarySIGLECZCzech Republi...|$|E
40|$|Local {{races of}} winter rye have been grown {{to the present}} day in many places in Finland. These races of this allogamous and highly {{heterozygous}} species are usually strongly adapted to local climate, soil quality conditions and cultivation practices. Local races are derived from old, mainly European local races or varieties which have been imported to Finland during the history of rye cultivation here. The single plants which {{have not been able to}} survive over hard winters or which lacked growth vigour during stand development have not produced seed. This elimination of weak plants has continued from generation to generation raising the fitness of the population and increasing adaptation. Because of cross pollination rye plants will become very similar by phenotype if there is no pollen transfer from the outside. Different parts of Finland have varied growing conditions which has led to different adaptation of local races and our country has become a valuable source of rye polymorphism. Rye breeders in our country have repeatedly used local races as gene sources for winter hardiness, earliness and disease resistance. Domestic market varieties which have been grown widely and successfully are reliable cross parents as well. Our long lasting winter is often too severe to varieties from more southern countries. A winter rye variety for Finland must be hardy against extreme cold in the winters without snow cover and resistant against <b>snow</b> <b>mould</b> in the winters when snow cover stands long. Here in the North rye varieties must also be adapted to long day lengths to be able to exploit all the sun light for rapid growth. The Finnish rye breeding has been much based on crosses between local land races or domestic varieties and foreign, high yielding varieties possessing high resistance against lodging. The goal is to breed a modern rye variety with high adaptability and stabile yield level. The crosses between non-relatives guarantee a high degree of continuous heterozygocity and heterosis in varieties descending from such crosses which raises their yield level in cultivation. Seeds of local races were collected and saved from being lost by collecting expeditions soon after founding of the Nordic Gene Bank. Now the collections of the Nordic Genetic Resource Centre (NordGen) include 90 local races and 34 varieties of rye from our country. A part of the collection has been evaluated for field characteristics in Jokioinen in 1999. As a breeder s view, the local race from Kinahmi, Nilsiä, was a good candidate among some others for a cross parent. Today, local races are still grown for production in many provinces. Seed samples of those are acquired by the working group of genetic resources in question. The samples are usually rejuvenated by distance isolations to get the sample of high quality for long term storage in NordGen. As an example, there have been three such distance isolations in the South Savo experimental station of MTT Agrifood Research Finland this summer. One of them, a local race originating from Iissavaara, Lieksa, showed exceptionally high tillering capacity and resistance against diseases. vo...|$|E
