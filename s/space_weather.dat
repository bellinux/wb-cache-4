40|$|<b>Space</b> <b>weathering</b> {{is defined}} as the {{physical}} and optical changes incurred by material exposed to the space environment. Through studies of lunar soils, these changes are becoming well understood. However, the effects of <b>space</b> <b>weathering</b> are dependent on the physical environment to which the host materials are exposed, and thus, the effects will likely vary from body to body. The optical effects of <b>space</b> <b>weathering</b> result from nanophase iron (npFe(sup 0)) created during micrometeorite bombardment and solar wind sputtering. In the asteroid belt, bodies are farther from the sun than our Moon, and are widely known to incur less solar wind implantation and sputtering. The velocity of impacts is smaller resulting in less melting and vaporization, and therefore fewer <b>space</b> <b>weathering</b> products. The impact rate in the asteroid belt is greater, which will result in more comminution, further diluting any weathering products. Ergo, asteroidal regoliths should contain fewer <b>space</b> <b>weathering</b> products than lunar soils. However, even very small degrees of <b>space</b> <b>weathering</b> can have dramatic consequences for the optical properties of soils. A discussion on the optical effects of <b>space</b> <b>weathering</b> is presented...|$|R
30|$|In {{the remote}} {{detection}} of mineral compositions of planetary surface materials on airless bodies, <b>space</b> <b>weathering</b> is an obstacle which makes reflectance spectra redder and darker and weakens spectral features. This study attempts to model {{an effect of}} <b>space</b> <b>weathering</b> due to vapor coating by accounting for the change in surface reflectivity of regolith particles wherein nanophase-reduced iron (npFe 0) particles are concentrated on their surfaces. When applied to a suite of reflectance spectra of lunar soils having different degrees of <b>space</b> <b>weathering,</b> this model can estimate the degrees of <b>space</b> <b>weathering</b> {{in terms of the}} thicknesses of the coating layer and provide an absorption coefficient spectrum of the host material.|$|R
40|$|All {{materials}} exposed at {{the lunar}} surface undergo <b>space</b> <b>weathering</b> processes.

Yet <b>space</b> <b>weathered</b> surfaces (patina) are relatively common on returned rock samples, some of which directly sample the surface of larger boulders. Because, as witness plates to lunar <b>space</b> <b>weathering,</b> rocks and boulders experience longer exposure times compared to lunar soil grains, they allow us to develop a deeper perspective on the relative importance of various weathering processes as a function of time...|$|R

30|$|S-type asteroids are {{believed}} to be parent bodies of ordinary chondrites. However, the reflectance spectra of S-type asteroids are different from those of ordinary chondrites. This spectral mismatch is strongly considered as a result of <b>space</b> <b>weathering,</b> where high-velocity dust particle impacts should change the optical properties of the uppermost regolith surface of asteroids. To simulate <b>space</b> <b>weathering</b> by impact heating of dust particles, we irradiated nanosecond pulse laser beam onto planetary surface materials, whose pulse duration and energy rate are comparable with those of real dust impacts. The laser-irradiated samples show optical changes similar to that by <b>space</b> <b>weathering,</b> and contain nanophase metallic iron particles considered as the essential cause of <b>space</b> <b>weathering.</b> After laser-irradiations, we observed the samples by an Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) to perform quantitative analysis of nanophase metallic iron particles.

25|$|<b>Space</b> <b>weather</b> exerts a {{profound}} influence {{in several areas}} related to space exploration and development. Changing geomagnetic conditions can induce changes in atmospheric density causing the rapid degradation of spacecraft altitude in Low Earth orbit. Geomagnetic storms due to increased solar activity can potentially blind sensors aboard spacecraft, or interfere with on-board electronics. An understanding of space environmental conditions is also important in designing shielding and life support systems for manned spacecraft.|$|E

25|$|Due to its link {{to other}} kinds of solar activity, sunspot {{occurrence}} {{can be used to}} help predict <b>space</b> <b>weather,</b> the state of the ionosphere, and hence the conditions of short-wave radio propagation or satellite communications. Solar activity (and the solar cycle) have been implicated in global warming, originally the role of the Maunder Minimum of sunspot occurrence in the Little Ice Age in European winter climate. Sunspots themselves, in terms of the magnitude of their radiant-energy deficit, have a weak effect on terrestrial climate in a direct sense. On longer time scales, such as the solar cycle, other magnetic phenomena (faculae and the chromospheric network) correlate with sunspot occurrence.|$|E
40|$|<b>Space</b> <b>weathering</b> is now {{understood}} {{to be a key}} modifier of visible and near infrared reflectance spectra of airless bodies. Believed to be caused by vapour recondensation after either ion sputtering or impact vaporization, <b>space</b> <b>weathering</b> has been successfully simulated in the laboratory over the past few years. The optical changes caused by <b>space</b> <b>weathering</b> have been attributed to the accumulation of sub-microscopic iron on regolith grain surfaces.

40|$|<b>Space</b> <b>weathering</b> {{alters the}} chemistry, microstructure, and {{spectral}} proper-ties of grains on {{the surfaces of}} airless bodies by two major processes: micrometeorite impacts and solar wind interactions. Investigating the nature of <b>space</b> <b>weathering</b> processes both in returned samples and in remote sensing observations provides information fundamental to understanding the evolution of airless body regoliths, improving our ability to determine the surface composition of asteroids, and linking meteorites to specific asteroidal parent bodies. Despite decades of research into <b>space</b> <b>weathering</b> processes and their effects, we still {{know very little about}} weathering rates. For example, what is the timescale to alter the reflectance spectrum of an ordinary chondrite meteorite to resemble the overall spectral shape and slope from an S-type asteroid? One approach to answering this question has been to determine ages of asteroid families by dynamical modeling and determine the spectral proper-ties of the daughter fragments. However, large differences exist between inferred <b>space</b> <b>weathering</b> rates and timescales derived from laboratory experiments, analysis of asteroid family spectra and the <b>space</b> <b>weathering</b> styles; estimated timescales range from 5000 years up to 108 years. Vernazza et al. concluded that solar wind interactions dominate asteroid <b>space</b> <b>weathering</b> on rapid timescales of 10 (exp 4) - 10 (exp 6) years. Shestopalov et al. suggested that impact-gardening of regolith particles and asteroid resurfacing counteract the rapid progress of solar wind optical maturation of asteroid surfaces and proposed a <b>space</b> <b>weathering</b> timescale of 10 (exp 5) - 10 (exp 6) years...|$|R
40|$|<b>Space</b> <b>weathering</b> {{effects on}} airless bodies result largely from {{micrometeorite}} impacts and solar wind interactions. Decades of research have provided insights into <b>space</b> <b>weathering</b> processes and their effects, but a major unanswered question still remains: {{what is the}} rate at which these <b>space</b> <b>weathering</b> effects are acquired in lunar and asteroidal regolith materials? To determine the <b>space</b> <b>weathering</b> rate for the formation of rims on lunar anorthite grains, we combine the rim width and type with the exposure ages of the grains, as determined by the accumulation of solar flare particle tracks. From these analyses, we recently showed that <b>space</b> <b>weathering</b> effects in mature lunar soils (both vapor-deposited rims and solar wind amorphized rims) accumulate and attain steady state in 10 (sup 6) - 10 (sup 7) y. Regolith grains from Itokawa also show evidence for <b>space</b> <b>weathering</b> effects, but in these samples, solar wind interactions appear to dominate over impactrelated effects such as vapor-deposition. While in our lunar work, we focused on anorthite, given its high abundance on the lunar surface, for the Itokawa grains, we focused on olivine. We previously studied 3 olivine grains from Itokawa and determined their solar flare track densities and described their solar wind damaged rims]. We also analyzed olivine grains from lunar soils, measured their track densities and rim widths, and used this data along with the Itokawa results to constrain the <b>space</b> <b>weathering</b> rate on Itokawa. We observe that olivine and anorthite have different responses to solar wind irradiation...|$|R

5000|$|The various {{modifications}} of surface minerals, or <b>space</b> <b>weathering,</b> {{is used to}} evaluate meteorite and asteroid types and ages. Rocks and metals shielded by atmospheres (particularly thick ones), or other minerals, experience less weathering and fewer implantation chemistries and cosmic ray tracks. Asteroids are currently graded by their spectra, indicating surface properties and mineralogies. Some asteroids appear to have less <b>space</b> <b>weathering,</b> by various processes including a relatively recent formation date or a [...] "freshening" [...] event.

30|$|Dust {{particles}} play {{an important}} role in the <b>space</b> <b>weathering</b> of airless bodies such as the Moon. Bombardment of high-velocity dust particles of the lunar surface contributes to the production of its regolith layer. As we have mentioned in Introduction, <b>space</b> <b>weathering</b> affects its optical properties. As the surface undergoes <b>space</b> <b>weathering,</b> the overall albedo is reduced, reflectance decreases with wavelength, and the depth of its diagnostic absorption bands is reduced. The mineral compositions of lunar materials derived from remote-sensing observations of the reflectance spectrum become ambiguous due to the space-weathering effect. Since the bombardment rate of dust particles of the Moon has not been measured precisely, any changes in the reflectance of lunar surface materials have not been evaluated quantitatively. It is important to measure the current flux of inflow dust particles, from which the weathering effect in the past can be inferred. The latitudinal distribution of the inflow position of dust particles is also interesting, because the latitude dependence of <b>space</b> <b>weathering</b> may reveal a leading cause of <b>space</b> <b>weathering.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Space</b> <b>weather</b> degrades GPS {{operation}} in two ways, direct interference by solar radio burst {{noise in the}} same frequency band or by scattering of the GPS radio signal in ionospheric irregularities referred to as scintillation. Both forms of degradation follow the 11 year solar cycle and are a maximum at sunspot maximum although they can occur at any time. Solar radio bursts are associated with solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and their impact can affect reception over the half of the Earth facing the sun. Scintillation occurs most frequently at tropical latitudes where it is a night time phenomenon. It occurs less frequently at high latitudes or mid-latitudes where magnetic storms can lead to scintillation. In addition to producing scintillation, magnetic storms can produce strong ionospheric gradients that degrade the accuracy of SBAS systems.|$|E
500|$|Geospace is {{the region}} of outer space near Earth. Geospace {{includes}} the upper region of the atmosphere and the magnetosphere. The Van Allen radiation belt lies within the geospace. The outer boundary of geospace is the magnetopause, which forms an interface between the planet's magnetosphere and the solar wind. The inner boundary is the ionosphere.

500|$|Stars, {{planets and}} moons retain their atmospheres by {{gravitational}} attraction. Atmospheres have no clearly delineated boundary: {{the density of}} atmospheric gas gradually decreases with distance from the object until it becomes indistinguishable from outer space. The Earth's atmospheric pressure drops to about Pa at [...] of altitude, compared to 100,000 Pa for the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) definition of standard pressure. Above this altitude, isotropic gas pressure rapidly becomes insignificant when compared to radiation pressure from the Sun and the dynamic pressure of the solar wind. The thermosphere in this range has large gradients of pressure, temperature and composition, and varies greatly due to <b>space</b> <b>weather.</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Space</b> <b>weathering</b> - {{bombardment}} of airless bodies with charged particles and micrometeorites - may significantly modify optical {{properties of the}} uppermost layers of airless bodies. Silicate rocks dominate the surfaces of planets and small bodies in the inner solar system. <b>Space</b> <b>weathering</b> of Fe-containing silicate targets causes darkening and spectral reddening of their surfaces, induced mostly by reduction of Fe. However, effects of <b>space</b> <b>weathering</b> on surface properties of low-albedo small bodies are poorly understood. Such small bodies may contain organic materials which show very different <b>space</b> <b>weathering</b> trends. Recent experiments show that carbonization/polymerization of complex organics induced by <b>space</b> <b>weathering</b> may neutralize initially reddish spectral slopes of hydrocarbon-bearing targets. These new findings may explain, for example, unusual color-diameter trends observed within populations of low albedo outer belt asteroids (Cybeles, Hildas and Trojans). Furthermore, spectral differences between carbonaceous meteorites and the surfaces of dark main belt asteroids belonging to the C-complex were previously explained by extensive thermal metamorphism. Wide-spread metamorphism would imply the absence of soluble and insoluble organic materials on the surfaces and in the interiors of these asteroids. Alternatively, the observed spectral differences between primitive meteorites and C-asteroids {{can be explained by}} <b>space</b> <b>weathering</b> of their surfaces. In this case only surface layers would be affected by carbonization.

500|$|The vast {{majority}} of the Solar System consists of a near-vacuum known as the interplanetary medium. Along with light, the Sun radiates a continuous stream of charged particles (a plasma) known as the solar wind. This stream of particles spreads outwards at roughly 1.5 million kilometres per hour, creating a tenuous atmosphere that permeates the interplanetary medium out to at least 100AU (see [...] ). Activity on the Sun's surface, such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections, disturb the heliosphere, creating <b>space</b> <b>weather</b> and causing geomagnetic storms. The largest structure within the heliosphere is the heliospheric current sheet, a spiral form created by the actions of the Sun's rotating magnetic field on the interplanetary medium.|$|E
500|$|The varying {{conditions}} in the magnetosphere, known as <b>space</b> <b>weather,</b> are largely driven by solar activity. If the solar wind is weak, the magnetosphere expands; while if it is strong, it compresses the magnetosphere and more of it gets in. Periods of particularly intense activity, called geomagnetic storms, can occur when a coronal mass ejection erupts above the Sun and sends a shock wave through the Solar System. Such a wave can take just two days to reach the Earth. Geomagnetic storms can {{cause a lot of}} disruption; the [...] "Halloween" [...] storm of 2003 damaged {{more than a third of}} NASA's satellites. The largest documented storm occurred in 1859.

500|$|Weather is {{not limited}} to {{planetary}} bodies.

40|$|The {{effective}} investigation of <b>space</b> <b>weathering</b> demands an interdisciplinary {{approach that is}} at least as diversified as any other in planetary science.
