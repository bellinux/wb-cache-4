40|$|The {{vehicle seat}} rattles or, in general, BSR (buzz, <b>squeak,</b> <b>and</b> <b>rattle)</b> <b>noises</b> {{are one of}} the major issues, which are {{directly}} linked to the NVH (noise, vibration and harshness) quality of the vehicle. Predicting and improving the seat BSR noise in early design phase is still challenging. This is mainly due to the complexity, nonlinearity and uncertainty of the impact mechanism at joints contributed to the rattle. Here, it is shown that there is a strong link between the seat structural dynamics <b>and</b> the seat <b>rattle</b> <b>noise</b> so that the seat <b>rattle</b> <b>noise</b> can be predicted and controlled from the seat structural analysis in early design phase. Accordingly, two experiments are designed for this study. The first experiment is set up to characterize the seat resonant frequencies and its corresponding structural mode-shapes. The second experiment is designed to measure the seat-radiated noise when it goes under vibration excitation. Alternatively, a concept CAE (Computer Aided Engineering) model of the seat is developed and the seat structural dynamics is character-ized by using this analytical model.

40|$|The {{noise and}} {{vibration}} of a poor automotive seat aggravate the interior cabin noise and discomfort. The automotive seat structural {{noise and vibration}} {{is caused by the}} transmission of the power train or road vibration into the seat. The characterization of seat structural dynamics behavior in early design phase assists to effectively improve the NVH quality of the seat. The seat nonlinear buzz, <b>squeak,</b> <b>and</b> <b>rattle</b> (BSR) <b>noise</b> are the major issues which are directly linked to the NVH quality of the vehicle. For this purpose, a practical CAE (computer-aided engineering) concept modeling method is introduced and developed for full BIW (body-in-white) and seat separately. Here, the seat concept model is employed to allow designing the seat structure modifications as well as examining the effects of the modifications on the <b>rattle</b> <b>noise.</b> Comparisons {{of the results of the}} simulation and experiment validate the developed seat CAE model. Three modifications are proposed to optimize the dynamics of the seat structure to prevent the seat <b>rattle</b> <b>noise.</b> These modifications are designed to shift or decrease the seat torsion resonance and vibration level, respectively. The results verified that by modification the seat structural dynamics, the nonlinear events such as <b>rattle</b> <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> in general BSR noise can be reduced or controlled accordingly...|$|R
40|$|Many {{researches}} {{have discussed}} {{the dynamics of the}} vehicle seat structure in response to vibration. The structural dynamics of the seat is linked to the seat noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) quality. The interaction of the vehicle seat resonances with the seat mounting points or the floor resonances may considerably increase the transmission of the vibration into the seat and cause either vibration discomfort or the <b>rattle</b> <b>noise.</b> The vehicle seat rattles or, in general, buzz, <b>squeak,</b> <b>and</b> <b>rattle</b> (BSR) <b>noises</b> are one of the major issues which are directly linked to the NVH of the vehicle. Predicting and improving the seat BSR noise in early design phase is still challenging. This is mainly due to the complexity, nonlinearity and uncertainty of the impact mechanism at joints contributed to the rattle. In this research, two experiments are designed. The first experiment is set up to characterize the seat resonant frequencies and its corresponding structural mode-shapes.

Alternatively, a concept Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) model of the seat is developed and the seat structural dynamics is characterized by using this analytical model. Comparisons {{of the results of the}} simulation and experiment validate the developed CAE model. The seat structure demonstrated two major torsion and fore-aft bending structural modes in low vibration frequencies (< 50 Hz) where the structure have more potential to be rattled. We have confirmed that the occurrence of the <b>rattle</b> <b>noise</b> is related to the seat structural dynamics and it can be controlled and managed by modifying the structure. Two modifications are designed using the seat CAE model.

40|$|Clatter <b>and</b> <b>rattle</b> <b>noise</b> is an {{increasing}} challenge {{for the development of}} low-noise transmissions. Efforts to reduce fuel consumption and exhaust emissions of combustion engines combined with a decrease of the idle speed cause increasing cyclic irregularities within modern drivelines which result in {{an increasing}} clatter <b>and</b> <b>rattle</b> <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> can even lead to serious damage of driveline components. Beside these aspects, the improvement of transmission efficiency as part of the powertrain efficiency and therefore fuel consumption of the vehicle is a major task during {{the development of a new}} transmission. In order to design future transmissions that implicate improvements on both tasks simultaneously, new grounds were broken by the Institute of Machine Components (IMA) of the University of Stuttgart, Germany in the field of clatter <b>and</b> <b>rattle</b> <b>noise</b> free automotive transmissions. This is achieved in principle by decoupling all gears which are not in the power flow. On the basis of a patented solution named CARF-Transmission, the Clatter <b>And</b> <b>Rattle</b> <b>noise</b> Free transmission is presented as well as derived developments.

40|$|<b>Squeak</b> <b>and</b> <b>rattle</b> is a {{cause of}} high {{warranty}} costs and a driver behind the production of pre-series cars for subjective evaluation. An important feature for a premium car brand is a high perceived quality and consequently the lack of <b>squeak</b> <b>and</b> <b>rattle</b> issues. To bring down development time and cost while still increasing the <b>squeak</b> <b>and</b> <b>rattle</b> capabilities, the automotive industry is now striving towards better models for virtual evaluation of <b>squeak</b> <b>and</b> <b>rattle.</b> This master’s thesis is a step toward virtual rattle evaluations at Volvo Car Corporation. A test rig for rattle measurement was successfully designed, built, tested and evaluated. An objective rattle metric, based on psychoacoustics theory, was evaluated by comparison of subjective clinical trial results of rattle produced by the test rig. Some features, such as temperature dependency, could be verified through the virtual evaluation of rattle with the objective metric while other features could not, judging from comparisons with the subjective data. The overall congruence between subjective and objective evaluation was inconsistent. More work is needed before any model for virtual evaluation {{can be used in}} the development of new car models. However, all hypotheses set out by the group were confirmed, if considering the mean value trends, both by the objective metric and the subjective listening clinical trials if studying the results of these independently. This means that both of the evaluation methods work well by itself but that the connection between them is yet to be established.

To consider Buzz, <b>Squeak</b> <b>and</b> <b>Rattle</b> (BSR) from initial stage of the interior design, {{it is very important}} to obtain, analyze and understand the structural behaviors of the materials under environmental changes as well as time. In this report, the mechanical property changes of the plastics for automobiles are measured to investigate the temperature and humidity effects.

At first the different control theory areas are covered and divided into the main problem groups, stabilization through state-feedback and bandwidth-adjustment measures through feedforward-filters. This is followed by the system modelling, where an actuator model is designed, with separate modelling steps for the electric, magnetic and mechanical parts.

These test systems consist of 4 hydraulic actuators on top of which {{the wheels of the}} vehicle are placed. Movements of the actuators simulate the road surface and forces exerted by the road on the wheels. The movements of the system are tightly controlled by a digital test controller. During the research phase of a vehicle a 4-poster system is used to test newly designed suspension systems and their durability. In production 4-poster systems are usually used to test every vehicle {{at the end of the}} production line on <b>squeak</b> <b>and</b> <b>rattle,</b> which is a check to make sure the vehicle doesn't have any loose parts. Different kinds of testing are possible: sine test (sweep in frequency); simple wave form on each actuator; open loop test (driven by an external tension signal); a particular testing method called ICS control, which allows to reproduce on a car an actual service environment, starting from those data coming from the outdoor acquisition sessions.|$|R

These are tested against very stringent governmental regulations. Some of these requirements include: seat belt and air bag functionality testing, front and side impact testing, and tests of rollover resistance. Assessments are done with various methods and tools, including Computer crash simulation (typically finite element analysis), crash test dummies, and partial system sled and full vehicle crashes.Fuel economy/emissions: Fuel economy is the measured fuel efficiency of the vehicle in miles per gallon or kilometers per liter. Emissions testing includes the measurement of vehicle emissions, including hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), and evaporative emissions.NVH engineering (noise, vibration, and harshness): NVH is the customer's feedback (both tactile felt and audible heard) from the vehicle. While sound can be interpreted as a rattle, squeal, or hot, a tactile response can be seat vibration or a buzz in the steering wheel. This feedback is generated by components either rubbing, vibrating, or rotating. NVH response can be classified in various ways: powertrain NVH, road noise, wind noise, component <b>noise,</b> <b>and</b> <b>squeak</b> <b>and</b> <b>rattle.</b> Note, there are both good and bad NVH qualities. The NVH engineer works to either eliminate bad NVH or change the “bad NVH” too good (i.e., exhaust tones).|$|R

The im-portance of this development goal is increasing with rising customer expectations and increasingly stringent legal restrictions on noise emissions. The cause of <b>rattling</b> <b>and</b> clattering <b>noise</b> is torsional vibration of transmission components that are not under load, that move backwards and forwards within their func-tional clearances. This noise is perceived as distinct from other sources of noise, and is intrusive because of its undesirable character.
