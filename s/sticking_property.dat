40|$|Although {{many studies}} have {{addressed}} the role of bacteria in the degradation of organic matter, few have examined how bacteria alter the physicochemical properties of dissolved and colloidal organic matter in coastal systems. Here, we investigate how the <b>sticking</b> <b>properties</b> of transparent exopolymeric particles (TEP) varied with DOM age in batch cultures. We show that in two contrasted sites, despite different initial TEP <b>sticking</b> <b>properties</b> and bulk concentrations, after 48 h, the <b>sticking</b> <b>properties</b> were similar and increased (i. e. TEP became stickier) with increasing DOM age. We propose that TEP occurring after 48 h of incubation are mainly of heterotrophic origin, which {{is in contrast to}} the previously identified TEP of autotrophic origin. These results highlight the potential importance of bacterial DOM production, particularly in the aphotic zone, and further underline the potential of bacterial heterotrophs to produce biologically refractory dissolved organic matter that is physically reactive (i. e. sticky) ...|$|R

For each sampling station, a suspension of TEP and beads was prepared {{and the formation of}} mixed aggregates was monitored in the laboratory under controlled turbulence intensity. The number of beads attached to TEP per volume of TEP increased from 0. 22 × 10 − 3 ± 0. 15 × 10 − 3 μm− 3 to 5. 33 × 10 − 3 ± 1. 61 × 10 − 3 μm− 3, from low (28) salinities, respectively. The sudden increase in TEP <b>sticking</b> <b>properties</b> from salinity 10 to 15 suggests the occurrence of an "aggregation web" resulting from the stimulation of aggregation processes. For a given turbulence level, the formation of large aggregates should be enhanced seaward. The presence of a higher fraction of large aggregates seaward is supported by the increase of the slope of the particle size spectra measured in situ. The observed increase in TEP <b>sticking</b> <b>properties</b> toward high salinities may affect the vertical export pump in estuaries.

40|$|Variations of the <b>sticking</b> <b>properties</b> of {{transparent}} exopolymeric particles (TEP) {{were investigated}} {{by studying the}} interactions between latex beads and TEP precursors collected along a gradient of increasing metal concentrations. For each sampling station, a suspension of TEP and beads was prepared {{and the formation of}} mixed aggregates was monitored under increasing turbulence intensities. The number of TEP-attached beads scaled with TEP size and was highest in the stations near the coral reef, and decreased towards anthropogenically-impacted stations. The combined study at successive levels of turbulence revealed that the TEP pool at a given station was composed of particles with heterogeneous physico-chemical properties. TEP stickiness, estimated at low turbulence intensity from the exponential decrease in particle concentrations in the 5 - 7 mu m size range, increased continuously from the bay to the open ocean station, from 0. 05 to 0. 71. The role of metals in regulating TEP <b>sticking</b> <b>properties</b> was investigated by monitoring changes in TEP-beads interactions after addition of metals to solutions of TEP precursors. Addition of metals resulted in a strong decrease of the number of TEP-attached beads, suggesting that high metal concentrations induce a reduction of TEP <b>sticking</b> <b>properties.</b> Potential implications for vertical flux in the lagoon are discussed, considering estimates of naturally occurring turbulence regime, particle concentrations, and TEP turnover rates. This study suggests that the low physico-chemical reactivity of TEP in metal-impacted areas may result in a decoupling between coagulation and sedimentation rates, implying enhanced retention time and recycling...|$|R

The top carbon fibre stick tested here hits a ball around 6 % faster than a wooden stick under the same conditions.

The approach of Marichal Ketin to improve the rolling performances in the last finishing stands is presented. The Hi-Cr cast iron possesses excellent wear resistance due to the presence of hard chromium carbides, but its thermal conductivity and <b>sticking</b> <b>properties</b> are fairly low. A graphite precipitation could contribute to an improvement in thermal conductivity and serve as lubricant preventing sticking. The new material, called graphitic chromium iron, shows good oxidation, wear and thermal behaviour allowing its use as work roll in the last stands of the finishing section of a HSM. In the as-cast condition, graphite precipitation in high Ni and Si chromium cast iron occurs at a temperature of 950 degrees C. Moreover, the amount and volume of free graphite may be increased by secondary graphite precipitation during suitable heat treatment. Peer reviewe...|$|R

However, {{little is known about}} their main ecological traits within the coral holobiont. In this study, a quantitative and qualitative characterization of viral and bacterial communities was conducted on the mucus of seven different coral species of the Van Phong Bay (Vietnam). On average, the concentrations of viruses and bacteria were, respectively, 17 - and twofold higher in the mucus than in the surrounding water. The examination of bacterial community composition also showed remarkable differences between mucus and water samples. The percentage of active respiring cells was nearly threefold higher in mucus (m= 24. 8 %) than in water (m= 8. 6 %). Interestingly, a positive and highly significant correlation was observed between the proportion of active cells and viral abundance in the mucus, suggesting that the metabolism of the bacterial associates is probably a strong determinant of the distribution of viruses within the coral holobiont. Overall, coral mucus, given its unique physicochemical characteristics and <b>sticking</b> <b>properties,</b> can be regarded as a highly selective biotope for abundant, diversified and specialized symbiotic microbial and viral organisms...|$|R

Children's responses to photographs of child models encountering alcohol, a syringe, medicine, glue, and household bleach were coded for recognition of substance, awareness of potential danger, and understanding of danger or harm. Responses from 59 children (28 girls and 31 boys, who were all children of the required age in an urban primary school) were compared across three age groups (6 - 7 years, 8 - 9 years, and 10 - 11 years). 15 to 18 of 20 children in each of three age groups recognised all the dangerous substances. Significant differences across age groups were found for awareness of the potential harm from alchohol, glue, and medicine, but not for the syringe or bleach.

40|$|In pilot entrained-flow {{slagging}} coal gasifiers, high conversion efficiency and low pollutant emission levels have been observed, but the mechanism leading to this behaviour {{is not fully}} understood. Recent literature proposes several different mechanisms as playing an important role, ranging from the <b>sticking</b> <b>properties</b> of both particles and slag-covered walls to the thermal and chemical history along the trajectory of the particles in the entire gasifier. Nonetheless, very few attention {{has been devoted to}} the role of particle–particle interactions, even if {{it has been shown that}} this mechanism can lead to new regimes likely to occur in slagging gasifiers and to promote the rise in the coal conversion efficiency. This study presents the results of a simplified configuration that allows to highlight the role of the four different interactions that can be envisaged when considering particles and confining walls as either sticky or non sticky. Particles are subjected to a body force that mimics the action of the drag exerted by a swirling flow field in a cylindrical vessel. Particle–particle collisions are modelled with an Hertzian approach that includes torque and cohesion effects. Results clearly indicate the different structure of the layer of particles establishing on the wall surface in the different interaction regimes. They confirm the importance to adequately take into account particle–particle interactions for a correct prevision of the fate of coal particles in slagging gasifiers...|$|R
40|$|In protoplanetary disks, CO_ 2 {{is solid}} ice beyond its snow line at ∼ 10 AU. Due to its high abundance, it {{contributes}} heavily to the collisional evolution {{in this region}} of the disk. For the first time, we carried out laboratory collision experiments with CO_ 2 ice particles and a CO_ 2 -covered wall at a temperature of 80 K. Collision velocities varied between 0 - 2. 5 m/s. Particle sizes were {{on the order of}} ∼ 100 μm. We find a threshold velocity between the sticking and the bouncing regime at 0. 04 m/s. Particles with greater velocities but below 1 m/s bounce off the wall. For yet greater velocities, fragmentation occurs. We give analytical models for the coefficients of restitution and fragmentation strength consistent with the experimental data. Set in context, our data show that CO_ 2 ice and silicate dust resemble each other in the collisional behavior. Compared to water ice the sticking velocity is an order of magnitude smaller. One immediate consequence as example is that water ice particles mantled by CO_ 2 ice lose any "sticking advantage. " In this case, preferential planetesimal growth attributed to the <b>sticking</b> <b>properties</b> of water ice will be limited to the region between the H_ 2 O ice line and the CO_ 2 ice line...|$|R
40|$|The {{absorption}} of anthropogenic atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2) {{by the ocean}} provokes its acidification. This acidification may alter several oceanic processes, including the export of biogenic carbon from the upper layer of the ocean, hence providing a feedback on rising atmospheric carbon concentrations. The effect of seawater acidification on transparent exopolymeric particles (TEP) driven aggregation and sedimentation processes were investigated by studying the interactions between latex beads and TEP precursors collected in the lagoon of New Caledonia. A suspension of TEP and beads was prepared {{and the formation of}} mixed aggregates was monitored as a function of pH under increasing turbulence intensities. The pH was controlled by addition of sulfuric acid. Aggregation and sedimentation processes driven by TEP were drastically reduced when the pH of seawater decreases within the expected limits imposed by increased anthropogenic CO 2 emissions. In addition to the diminution of TEP <b>sticking</b> <b>properties,</b> the diminution of seawater pH led to a significant increase of the TEP pool, most likely due to swollen structures. A diminution of seawater pH by 0. 2 units or more led to a stop or a reversal of the downward flux of particles. If applicable to oceanic conditions, the sedimentation of marine aggregates may slow down or even stop as the pH decreases, and the vertical flux of organic carbon may reverse. This would enhance both rising atmospheric carbon and ocean acidification...|$|R
40|$|Ants of {{the genus}} Crematogaster are able to raise their abdomen {{forwards}} and over the thorax and head. In many Crematogaster species, the venom is emitted as a froth that accumulates on the spatulate portion and at {{the basis of the}} sting, and thus can be easily applied to the integument of enemies. In the three European species of Crematogaster ants, the Dufour gland contains complex mixtures of long chain derivatives bearing a (E,E) -cross-conjugated dienone linked to a primary acetate function. When the venom is emitted, these compounds are transformed into highly electrophilic and toxic 4 -oxo- 2, 5 -dienals by an esterase and an oxidase stored in the poison gland. On the other hand, the Dufour gland of one Crematogaster species from Papua-New Guinea produces long chain furan derivatives, whereas two Brazilian species produce furanocembrene diterpenes. To further investigate the defensive mechanisms in this genus and to assess whether the composition of the Dufour gland secretion could be used for taxonomic purposes, we have now studied two other Crematogaster species. The Dufour gland of C. nigriceps from Africa contains a mixture of l-alkyl-l, 3, 5 -cyclohexanetriols. In C. montezumia, collected in Argentina, the defensive mechanism is based on the production of triacylglycerols bearing polyunsaturated fatty acids containing (Z,Z,Z) -conjugated trienes or (5 E, 8 Z, 10 Z, 12 Z) -tetraenes, which are responsible for the strong <b>sticking</b> <b>properties</b> of the secretion...|$|R

The various fibers have identical size distributions but differ in their affinities for components of the cell membrane. They were treated with boiling toluene or chemically modified by treatment with alkyldimethylchlorosilanes (R = C 8, C 18) that react with free-surface hydroxyl groups to form the corresponding siloxanes. Fibers in MEM supplemented with 15 % fetal calf serum were added to a suspension of V 79 - 4 cells labeled with tritiated thymidine and the mixture was incubated. Aliquots of this mixture were spun down on a density gradient to determine the degree of cell-fiber interaction. At 37 degrees C native amosite (UICC standard) stuck to cells within 15 min of incubation, and the amount of sticking was maximum within 70 min. Decreasing the temperature decreased the amount of sticking, and at 20 degrees C no sticking was observable. The chemically modified amosite and the amosite treated with boiling toluene did not stick to the cells even after 70 min. Soaking the toluene-treated amosite with aqueous solutions at room temperature for 48 hr produced a material that had the same <b>sticking</b> <b>properties</b> as the original untreated fiber.

In the world of grandmother Noemi, “things are made of put together utterances”, and her granddaughter makes the effort to catch the meaning hidden in them, subtly interwoven in grandmother’s life hour after hour, gesture by gesture.

Seawater samples were prescreened and ultrafiltered to concentrate the 30 kDa to 10 mu m size fraction. First, we produced small magnetizable aggregates by combining glass microfibers and paramagnetic 1 -mu m beads with the organic matter present in the concentrated solution. The second step involved clustering the small aggregates into a single macro-aggregate, using a small ring-shaped magnet as an aggregation nucleus. Viral and bacterial densities, determined after dissolution of the newly formed aggregates with methanol, averaged 13. 8 x 10 (6) +/- 3. 6 x 10 (6) vir. agg.

(- 1) h(- 1) and 1. 54 +/- 0. 45 ng C agg. (- 1) h(- 1), respectively. Particulate organic carbon and nitrogen content of the newly formed macro-aggregates averaged 31. 92 +/- 2. 67 mu g C agg.

This approach allows the concentration and isolation of the organic matter precursors that compose natural aggregates and provides a simple protocol for recombining those precursors into single newly formed macro-aggregates, which can then be easily manipulated for further investigation. This method is a new tool for investigations into the interactions between microorganisms and marine aggregates and their implications at the ecosystem level, but also into the interactions between aggregates and dissolved organic or inorganic substances...|$|R
40|$|Planetesimal {{formation}} stage {{represents a}} major gap {{in our understanding}} of the planet formation process. The late-stage planet accretion models typically make arbitrary assumptions about planetesimals and pebbles distribution while the dust evolution models predict that planetesimal formation is only possible at some orbital distances. We want to test the importance of water snow line for triggering formation of the first planetesimals during the gas-rich phase of protoplanetary disk, when cores of giant planets have to form. We connect prescriptions for gas disk evolution, dust growth and fragmentation, water ice evaporation and recondensation, as well as transport of both solids and water vapor, and planetesimal formation via streaming instability into a single, one-dimensional model for protoplanetary disk evolution. We find that processes taking place around the snow line facilitate planetesimal formation in two ways. First, due to the change of <b>sticking</b> <b>properties</b> between wet and dry aggregates, there is a "traffic jam" inside of the snow line that slows down the fall of solids onto the star. Second, ice evaporation and outward diffusion of water followed by its recondensation increases the abundance of icy pebbles that trigger planetesimal formation via streaming instability just outside of the snow line. Planetesimal formation is hindered by growth barriers and radial drift and thus requires particular conditions to take place. Snow line is a favorable location where planetesimal formation is possible {{for a wide range of}} conditions, but still not in every protoplanetary disk model. This process is particularly promoted in large, cool disks with low intrinsic turbulence and increased initial dust-to-gas ratio. Comment: Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysic...|$|R

We performed an experiment on the REXUS 12 suborbital rocket. The protoplanetary dust analogue materials were micrometre-sized monodisperse and polydisperse SiO 2 particles prepared into aggregates with sizes around 120 μm and 330 μm, respectively and volume filling factors around 0. 37. During the experimental run of 150 s under reduced gravity conditions, the sticking of aggregates {{and the formation}} and fragmentation of clusters of up to a few millimetres in size was observed. The sticking probability of the sub-mm-sized dust aggregates could be derived for velocities decreasing from 22 to 3 cm/s. The transition from bouncing to sticking collisions happened at 12. 7 cm/s for the smaller aggregates composed of monodisperse particles and at 11. 5 and 11. 7 cm/s for the larger aggregates composed of mono- and polydisperse dust particles, respectively. Using the pull-off force of sub-mm-sized dust aggregates from the clusters, the surface energy of the aggregates composed of monodisperse dust was derived to be 1. 6 x 10 - 5 J/m 2, which can be scaled down to 1. 7 x 10 - 2 J/m 2 for the micrometre-sized monomer particles and is in good agreement with previous measurements for silica particles. The tensile strengths of these aggregates within the clusters were derived to be 1. 9 Pa and 1. 6 Pa for the small and large dust aggregates, respectively. These values are in good agreement with recent tensile strength measurements for mm-sized silica aggregates.

Conditions for the attractivity of the equilibrium set of MDOF mechanical systems with multiple friction elements are presented. These results are obtained by application of a generalisation of LaSalle’s principle for differential inclusions of Filippov-type. Besides passive systems, also systems with negative viscous damping are considered. For such systems, only local attractivity of the equilibrium set can be assured under certain conditions. Moreover, an estimate for the region of attraction is given for these cases. The effectiveness of the results is illustrated by means of both 1 DOF and MDOF examples...|$|R
40|$|Perhaps {{the most}} famous “bundle ” in United States law is the meta-phor used to conceptualize {{property}} rights. Law students learn that one way to understand property is as a bundle of rights: the right to possess, the right to exclude, the right to sell, the right to destroy, the right to de-vise, etc. 1 One reason to conceptualize anything {{in terms of a}} bundle is to consider what happens if someone or something—the state, a third par-ty—unties the binding or pulls out one of the <b>sticks.</b> In <b>property,</b> this thought exercise helps students understand many of the doctrines taught in the canonical first year course, including easements, adverse posses-sion, and the rule against perpetuities.

40|$|Pulverised {{coal-fired}} power generation technologies {{are important for}} meeting the electricity consumption worldwide, especially for the developing countries. Changing fuels (coal blending, co-combustion, new fuels, etc.) is common practice in the power stations, which may result in the change of ash deposition behaviours. Ash deposition issues can reduce the heat transfer and {{have a negative effect}} on the long-term operation of the combustion systems. Therefore, prediction of ash deposition behaviours is significant for the efficient operation of boilers. In this thesis, new ash deposition prediction models based on particle impaction and sticking behaviours, ash melting behaviour and multi-slagging routes have been developed in order to understand ash deposit formation and predict the slagging propensities through using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods and ash deposition indices. Regarding the CFD methods, an ash deposition model has been proposed to predict the ash deposit formation on an uncooled probe for the co-combustion of South African coal and palm kernel expeller in an entrained flow reactor. A new revised particle impaction sub-model has been developed in order to minimize the numerical related errors without excessive meshing. The molten fraction model obtained from the chemical equilibrium calculations was employed to predict the particle sticking behaviour. The simulation results show that the revised particle impaction model is suitable to accurately resolve particle impaction without using a prohibitive meshing size. Particle impaction and <b>sticking</b> <b>properties</b> dictate the ash deposit formation. In addition, a CFD-based dynamic ash deposition model has been developed to predict the slagging formation on a cooled probe under high furnace temperatures of Zhundong lignite (rich in alkali and alkaline earth metal elements) combustion in a pilot-scale furnace. The developed model is based on the inertia impaction, the thermophoresis and the direct alkali vapour condensation and incorporates the influence of the heat transfer rate. The results show that particle deposition from the inertia impaction and the thermophoresis dictates ash deposit formation under high furnace temperatures. The deposition caused by the direct alkali vapour condensation is less significant. As deposition time increases, particle impaction efficiency decreases and sticking efficiency increases due to the thermophoresis and the local temperature conditions. In addition, the ash deposition characteristics are influenced under different furnace temperatures, due to the changes in the particle impaction and sticking behaviours. Further, a new method for building the ash deposition indice has been proposed to predict the slagging propensities of coals/blends combustion in utility boilers. The method is based on the initial slagging routes and the sintered/slagging route. Two types of initial slagging routes are considered, namely (i) pyrite-induced initial slagging on the furnace wall, and (ii) fouling caused by the alkaline/alkali components condensing in the convection section. In addition, the sintered/slagging route is considered by the liquids temperature, which represents the melting potential of the main ash composition and is calculated using the chemical equilibrium methods. The partial least square regression (PLSR) technique, coupled with a cross validation method, is employed to obtain the correlation for the ash deposition indice. The results obtained show that the developed indice yields a higher success rate in classifying the overall slagging potential in boilers than some of the typical slagging indices. In addition, both SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 can reduce the slagging potential, but the drop in slagging propensity is more significant by adding Al 2 O 3 compared to SiO 2...|$|R
50|$|Here two {{distinct}} ways {{have to be}} differentiated:The first one, similar to the external approach, focuses on property right distributions in Africa. These usually emerge from the setup of the society, being more collective than individualist with tribes or families playing {{an important role in}} Africa. Thereby the distribution of property rights is an obstacle to economic development. Also, there are few incentives to change this setup into an economically more advantageous setting. For rulers it is often the rational choice to <b>stick</b> to this <b>property</b> rights setup, thereby being able to extract more from their dominion than by fostering economic development.The second internal approach focuses directly on resource endowments within the specific regions. Labor scarcity until the 20th century combined with a relatively low quality of soils lead to a extensive way of farming, largely relying on vast amounts of land rather than on intensive use of labor on the land. Combined with bad institutions from precolonial or colonial times this economic setup hinders the extensive use of technology and thereby slowing down or even preventing economic development.|$|R

But the people around our old house of Barryogue, although they did not like my father for his change of faith, yet stood by him at this moment, and were for exterminating the mutes sent by Mr. Plumer of London with the lamented remains. The monument and vault in the church were then, alas! all that remained of my vast possessions; for my father had sold every <b>stick</b> of the <b>property</b> to one Notley, an attorney, and we received but a cold welcome in his house--a miserable old tumble-down place it was. [Footnote: In another part of his memoir Mr. Barry will be found to describe this mansion {{as one of the most}} splendid palaces in Europe; but this is a practice not unusual with his nation; and with respect to the Irish principality claimed by him, it is known that Mr. Barry's grandfather was an attorney and maker of his own fortune.] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of mechanical systems with dry friction elements, modeled by set-valued force laws, can be de-scribed by differential inclusions. The switching and set-valued {{nature of the}} friction force law is responsi-ble for the hybrid character of such models. An equi-librium set of such a differential inclusion corresponds to a stationary mode for which the friction elements are <b>sticking.</b> The attractivity <b>properties</b> of the equilib-rium set are of major importance for the overall dy-namic behavior {{of this type of}} systems. Conditions for the attractivity of the equilibrium set of linear MDOF mechanical systems with multiple friction elements are presented. These results are obtained by application of a generalization of LaSalle’s principle for differen-tial inclusions of Filippov-type. Besides passive sys-tems, also systems with negative viscous damping are considered. For such systems, only local attractivity of the equilibrium set can be assured under certain condi-tions. Moreover, an estimate for the region of attraction is given for these cases. The results are illustrated by means of a 2 DOF example. Moreover, the value of the attractivity results {{in the context of the}} control of me-chanical systems with friction is illuminated. Key word...|$|R
40|$|A general kinetic {{nucleation}} and condensation {{model is}} proposed and {{implemented in the}} direct simulation Monte Carlo method. Both gas and clusters are treated as particles in this model, and clusters possess internal energy and potential energy. Nucleation and condensation processes are treated as collision events, and the probability for possible nucleation or condensation is determined from the nucleation rate and sticking coefficient. Literature review shows {{that there are many}} uncertainties in gas nucleation and condensation theory. The proposed model is then very useful for parametric studies. Our parametric studies show that both nucleation rate and <b>sticking</b> coefficient affect <b>properties</b> of the gas and clusters. Simulation of supersonic flow in an expansion nozzle shows that the proposed model is able to simulate complicated flows involving clusters.

40|$|In the {{continuous}} quest for {{low cost housing}} delivery in the developing countries, Periwinkle shells {{have been used in}} the riverine (Niger-Delta) areas of Nigeria to wholly or partially replace granite in concrete, while Owa stick (Jaundea Pinnata) has been used for decades in reinforcing earthen houses. This paper reports the stress resistance of owa stick reinforced grano-periwinkle concrete slab compared to plain and steel reinforced grano-periwinkle concrete slab. The mix ratio of 1 : 2 : 2 was used for the concrete; the ratio of 1 : 1 was used for granite and periwinkle shells with a water-cement ratio of 0. 5. Concrete cubes were casted and used in testing for compressive strength. Slabs of 500 x 500 x 100 mm were also used to test for the maximum flexural stress under point load. The slabs were simply-supported (ssss) on all the sides. The 28 -day compressive strength and density of the concrete was found to be 19. 932 N/mm 2 and 2617. 48 kg/m 3. From this study it can be concluded that owa <b>stick</b> has elastic <b>properties</b> which helps in improving the tensile strength of concrete, though in comparison steel is still preferred, but the stress resistance of owa stick reinforced concrete slab was more than that of plain concrete with the gain in stress of about 4. 56 %.
