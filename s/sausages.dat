5|$|Glamorgan <b>sausages</b> {{are thought}} to have been {{originally}} made with Glamorgan cheese which is no longer made due to the near-extinction of the Glamorgan cattle from which it was produced. They rose in popularity during the Second World War due to rationing limiting the volume of meat. The Welsh Gas Board promoted the sausage in a cookbook published in the 1950s, in which it did not specify the type of cheese to be used.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} fat, raw pork skin and added {{water on the}} color, yield, texture and {{palatability}} of fresh pork <b>sausage</b> were investigated. Fresh pork <b>sausage</b> was produced to contain 8 percent and 20 percent fat, 10 percent or 20 percent pork skin and zero percent or 10 percent added water. Three controls were produced at 8 percent, 20 percent and 35 percent fat with no added pork skin or water. <b>Sausage</b> with added pork skins had increased pH values. The 8 percent fat <b>sausage</b> and <b>sausage</b> without added water had the greatest cook yields, while the addition of pork skin did not affect cook yield. Pork skins and added water caused <b>sausage</b> to be lighter in color. Redness of the <b>sausage</b> was similar for 20 percent fat/ 20 percent pork skin <b>sausage</b> compared to the 35 percent fat control. Kramer shear values indicated added water made <b>sausage</b> softer. Added pork skin did not affect Kramer shear values. A sensory panel rated 10 percent pork skin <b>sausage</b> more tender than <b>sausage</b> with 20 percent pork skin. <b>Sausage</b> with 8 percent fat and 10 percent pork skin was rated higher for juiciness and overall acceptability when compared to 8 percent fat <b>sausage</b> with 20 percent pork skin and 20 percent fat <b>sausage</b> at both added pork skin levels. Pork skins were successfully incorporated into reduced fat-fresh pork <b>sausage.</b> Production of acceptable reduced-fat pork <b>sausage</b> with added pork skins would increase the demand for this pork <b>sausage</b> and add value to a by-product of the pork industry...|$|R

Commonly hunted game included deer, bear, buffalo, and turkey. The larger parts of the animals were roasted and served with currant and other sauces, while smaller portions went into soups, stews, <b>sausages,</b> pies, and pasties.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, a {{campaign}} began {{to register the}} Glamorgan sausage under the European Union geographical indications and traditional specialities scheme.

5|$|Poisonous <b>sausages</b> {{containing}} toad meat {{are being}} trialled in the Kimberley (Western Australia) {{to try to}} protect native animals from cane toads' deadly impact. The Western Australian Department of Environment and Conservation has been working with the University of Sydney to develop baits to train native animals not to eat the toads. By blending bits of toad with a nausea-inducing chemical, the baits train the animals {{to stay away from the}} amphibians. Researcher David Pearson says trials run in laboratories and in remote parts of the Kimberley region of WA are looking promising, although the baits will not solve the cane toad problem altogether.|$|E
