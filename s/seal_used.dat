5|$|The {{distinction}} between the king's personal household department of the Wardrobe and the governmental department of the Chancery, which was headed by the chancellor, disappeared almost entirely during Burnell's period of office. The Wardrobe had developed as a less formal department for the collection and distribution of money, but under Edward had effectively become a treasury for warfare. There was no rivalry between the holders of the Great Seal, the official seal of government and used for formal documents, and the Privy <b>Seal,</b> <b>used</b> to authenticate the king's less formal letters. During Burnell's time in office the king only used a Privy Seal warrant, or an informal set of instructions for the chancellor to issue {{a letter from the}} Chancery under the Great Seal, when the king and Burnell were apart; after Burnell's death the number of Privy Seal warrants increased greatly.|$|E
5|$|Canada's {{national}} {{symbols are}} influenced by natural, historical, and indigenous sources. The use of the maple leaf as a Canadian symbol dates to the early 18th century. The maple leaf is depicted on Canada's current and previous flags, and on the Arms of Canada. The Arms of Canada is closely modelled after the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom with French and distinctive Canadian elements replacing or added to those derived from the British version. The Great Seal of Canada is a governmental <b>seal</b> <b>used</b> for purposes of state, being set on letters patent, proclamations and commissions, for representatives of the Queen and for the appointment of cabinet ministers, lieutenant governors, senators, and judges. Other prominent symbols include the beaver, Canada goose, and common loon, the Crown, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and more recently the totem pole and Inuksuk. Canadian coins feature many of these symbols: the loon on the $1 coin, the Arms of Canada on the 50¢ piece, the beaver on the nickel. The penny, removed from circulation in 2013, featured the maple leaf. The Queen' s image appears on $20 bank notes, and on the obverse of all current Canadian coins.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the time}} of Richard III, the large room over the gateway of the Angel Inn was called La Chambre le Roi (the King's Chamber). [...] Street {{concluded}} that this room's name came from Norman French, and probably from the visit to Grantham that John paid in 1213 (during which he delvered Letters Patent at Grantham granting the release of Lucian of Arquill). [...] The evidence for Richard III's visit he took from Rymer's Fædera, as quoted in Halstead's History of Richard the Third, which said that the Great <b>Seal,</b> <b>used</b> for issuing a death warrant, was delivered to the king by messenger [...] "in a chamber called the King's chamber in the Angel Inn, {{in the presence of}} the Bishops of Worcester, Durham, St David's, and St Asaph, and of the Earls of Northumberland and Huntingdon, and of Sir Thomas Stanley".|$|E
2500|$|In September 1864, an {{engraver}} named J. Baumgarten from Baltimore, Maryland {{made and}} sent Lincoln an unsolicited seal, marked with [...] "A Lincoln" [...] on its side, meant for personal use. [...] Baumgarten also {{claimed to have}} made seals of the [...] "same plan" [...] for both Presidents Fillmore and Buchanan. [...] This was just prior to Nevada becoming the 36th state, but as the design of this seal is not described, and no reply from Lincoln is known and no payment is recorded, {{it is not possible}} to know if it was the aforementioned 36-star seal, something similar to the simple F <b>seal</b> <b>used</b> by Fillmore, an entirely different seal, or if it was used at all. [...] Baumgarten may well have been related to Selig Baumgarten, an engraver who emigrated to Baltimore from Hanover with eight children in 1852. [...] One of Selig's sons, Herman Baumgarten, later engraved the 1877 version of the Great Seal.|$|E
2500|$|The actual <b>seal</b> <b>used</b> by the {{president}} was changed to have a similar design, though apparently not at the time. [...] The Daily Graphic article reported the 1850 seal was still in use in 1885, but the change {{had been made by}} 1894, as an impression of this new seal was obtained from Henry T. Thurber (President Cleveland's private secretary) for use in a book on heraldry. [...] This version moved closer to the modern design, with the words OF THE in smaller capital letters than the other words (a feature which is still used), and the layout of stars being slightly changed into essentially the arrangement still used today. [...] This seal remained in use until 1945, as Gaillard Hunt confirmed the design was still current as of 1916, and it also matches actual impressions taken from {{the president}}ial seal in 1936 during Franklin Roosevelt's administration. [...] The design continued to evolve in other places in the meantime, particularly the presidential flag, and these evolved designs were used when the seal was changed again in 1945.|$|E
