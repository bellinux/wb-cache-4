Its popularity for this purpose {{is associated with the}} American artist and sex educator Betty Dodson, who used it in demonstrations and instructional classes to instruct women regarding self-pleasure techniques. Dodson became active in the sex-positive movement in the late 1960s. She recommended women put a small towel over their sex organs in order to dull the sensation of the vibrator and prolong the pleasurable experience. Her technique became known as the Betty Dodson Method. Her sessions were known as Bodysex workshops and featured 15 naked women in <b>supine</b> <b>position,</b> each using a Magic Wand simultaneously to aid in masturbation. She provided a Magic Wand to each woman for these two-hour masturbation sessions. Dodson taught thousands of women to achieve orgasm using this technique.|$|E

She was naked and her clothes, consisting of a leather cape and three woolen garments, had been placed on top of her. Hurdles of branches and wooden poles pinned the body down. The complete skin envelope and the internal organs were both intact. The body had a lancing wound to the knee joint area, where some object (possibly one of the sharp poles) penetrated to some depth. Her skin was deeply bronzed with a robust skin tone due to tannins in the peat, and all the body joints were preserved with overlying skin in a state as if she had died only recently. Doctors determined she had been about 50 years old when she died and in good health without signs of degenerative diseases (such as arthritis) which are typically found in human remains of that age.|$|E
25|$|Sleeping in the <b>supine</b> <b>position</b> is {{believed}} to make the sleeper more vulnerable to episodes of sleep paralysis because in this sleeping position {{it is possible for}} the soft palate to collapse and obstruct the airway.

40|$|PURPOSE: To compare {{arterial}} {{blood gas analysis}} of patients who underwent percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) in flank position under ultrasonography guidance with PCNL in prone and <b>supine</b> <b>positions</b> under fluoroscopic guidance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a clinical trial, a total of 90 patients with no upper urinary tract abnormalities were candidate for the PCNL. They were assigned into three groups using pseudorandomization method (30 patients in each group). Patients in group 1 underwent ultrasonography-guided PCNL in flank position. Patients in groups 2 and 3 underwent fluoroscopic-guided PCNL in prone and <b>supine</b> <b>positions,</b> respectively. Arterial blood gas was taken just before and 20 minutes after repositioning. RESULTS: The patients’ mean age was 40. 8 ± 6. 9, 39. 4 ± 10. 6, and 37. 2 ± 11. 1 years in flank, prone, and <b>supine</b> <b>positions,</b> respectively (P =. 69). The mean body mass index was 27. 8 ± 3. 4, 26. 7 ± 4. 7, and 28. 1 ± 5. 1 kg/m 2 in flank, prone, and <b>supine</b> <b>positions,</b> respectively (P =. 21). Arterial oxygen pressure (PaO 2) increased significantly in flank (111. 7 ± 43. 8 to 132. 8 ± 58. 1 mmHg; P =. 01) and prone (118. 6 ± 50. 2 to 134. 6 ± 58. 5 mmHg; P <. 001) positions and decreased nonsignificantly in supine group (121. 7 ± 64. 5 to 119. 7 ± 60. 9 mmHg; P =. 23). With surgical positioning, {{there were no significant}} changes demonstrated in PaCO 2 and serum concentration of HCO 3 in the flank, prone, and supine groups.

40|$|Having {{choices and}} being {{involved}} in decision making contributes to women's positive childbirth experiences. During a physiological birth, women's preferences can play {{a leading role in}} the choice of birthing positions. In this study, we explored women's preferences with regard to birthing positions during second stage of labor, with a special focus on women who preferred positions other than common <b>supine</b> <b>positions.</b> A questionnaire survey was conducted among women in 54 Dutch midwifery practices. Of the 1154 women in the study, 58. 9 % preferred <b>supine</b> <b>positions,</b> 19. 6 % preferred other positions (e. g. sitting or standing), and 21. 5 % had no distinct preference. Women who preferred <b>supine</b> <b>positions</b> gave birth in these positions more often than women with preferences for other positions. Among the women having a preference for other positions, the actual fulfillment of their preference was related to longer duration of second stage of labor, higher levels of education, the strength of the preference, and giving birth at home. These results demonstrate differences in women's use of preferred positions during childbirth. Midwives can contribute to women-centered care by proactively exploring women's preferences for birthing positions throughout pregnancy and birth, supporting women in developing well-informed choices and facilitating these choices where possible. © 2012 Informa UK, Ltd...|$|R

25|$|When {{performing}} the Dix–Hallpike test, patients are lowered quickly to a <b>supine</b> <b>position,</b> with the neck extended by the clinician {{performing the}} maneuver. For some patients, this maneuver {{may not be}} indicated, and a modification may be needed that also targets the posterior semicircular canal. Such patients include those who are too anxious about eliciting the uncomfortable symptoms of vertigo, and those {{who may not have}} the range of motion necessary to comfortably be in a <b>supine</b> <b>position.</b> The modification involves the patient moving from a seated position to side-lying without their head extending off the examination table, such as with Dix–Hallpike. The head is rotated 45 degrees away from the side being tested, and the eyes are examined for nystagmus. A positive test is indicated by patient report of a reproduction of vertigo and clinician observation of nystagmus. Both the Dix–Hallpike and the side-lying testing position have yielded similar results, and as such the side-lying position can be used if the Dix–Hallpike cannot be performed easily.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The prone {{position}} has been considered the only position for percutaneous access to the kidney for the past 25 years, whereas the <b>supine</b> Valdivia <b>position</b> has recently started to gain acceptance, although it was originally described in the late 1980 s. Even more recently, the Galdakao-modified <b>supine</b> Valdivia <b>position</b> was described. However, {{there is no consensus}} on which is the best position for percutaneous nephrolithotomy, and the choice is currently based on the surgeon's preference. Materials and Methods: The prone, supine, and modified <b>supine</b> <b>positions</b> are described, pointing out the advantages, disadvantages, and results of each technique. Results: A number of potential advantages have been described for the supine over the {{prone position}}: less cardiovascular change; no need for patient repositioning (with less associated risk of central and peripheral nervous system injury); less X-ray exposure to the surgeon; and less risk of colonic injury. The recently described Galdakao-modified <b>supine</b> Valdivia <b>position</b> allows for a simultaneous anterograde and retrograde approach to the renal cavities for the one-stage treatment of complex renal stones or concurrent renal and ureteral calculi. Moreover, the use of a flexible ureteroscope allows for Endovision puncture to achieve perfect access to the kidney. Conclusions: The prone position still represents the standard for percutaneous access to the kidney, and other positions should be compared with this <b>position.</b> However, the <b>supine</b> and the modified <b>supine</b> <b>positions</b> have potentially important advantages for both patients and surgeons that need to be investigated in a large randomised trial to define their superiority over the traditional prone position...|$|R

Later that year, Georg Hirschel (18751963) described a percutaneous approach to the brachial plexus from the axilla. In 1928, Kulenkampff and Persky published their experiences with a thousand blocks without apparent major complications.

40|$|Purpose—To {{evaluate}} with spectral domain {{optical coherence tomography}} (SD-OCT) {{the relationship}} between the retina and overlying silicone oil tamponade after macular hole surgery, and to evaluate how this relationship changes with patient positioning. Patients and Methods—Retrospective consecutive case series of 10 eyes from 9 patients who underwent macular hole surgery with silicone oil tamponade and subsequent SD-OCT scans. Four of the included eyes were also imaged with patients in face-down posture to determine if the silicone-retina apposition changes with prone positioning. Finally, a single patient was additionally scanned in the lateral and <b>supine</b> <b>positions.</b> Results—The posterior surface of the silicone oil bubble was well visualized in all 10 eyes. In the majority of eyes (7 / 10) the oil tamponade bridged across the macular hole creating a pre-foveal fluid space, but in 3 eyes the silicone oil filled the macular hole and was seen in touch with the underlying foveal depression or retinal pigment epithelium. In 75 % of eyes (3 / 4) the silicone oil-retinal approximation did not vary with face-down <b>position.</b> <b>Supine</b> <b>positioning</b> clearly floated the silicone tamponade anteriorly and off of the retinal surface. Conclusions—Silicone oil tamponade can either bridge across macular holes, or in a novel finding, can fill the underlying foveal depression or macular hole space. Generally, the oil position is stable between face-forward and prone SD-OCT images, suggesting that either of these patient positions allows waterproofing of the underlying macular hole. Finally, our images confirm that <b>supine</b> <b>positioning</b> should be avoided post-operatively as it leads to loss of oil-retinal tamponade...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1998 A common {{therapeutic}} {{nursing intervention}} is patient positioning. Despite demonstrated benefits of lateral positioning, critically ill patients may require prolonged <b>supine</b> <b>positioning</b> {{in order to}} obtain reproducible hemodynamic measurements. The rationale for <b>supine</b> <b>positioning</b> is based on research that suggests that pulmonary artery (PA) pressure measurements in the lateral and <b>supine</b> <b>positions</b> are different. However, this research was limited by the lack of an angle-specific left atrial (LA) reference, which may have introduced systematic measurement error. It was unknown if PA pressure measurements in the 30 -degree lateral position, using an angle-specific LA reference, were similar to supine measurements. To determine the effect of 30 -degree right and left lateral positions on PA and PAW pressures in critically ill adults, 35 post-cardiac surgery patients, aged 27 to 89 (mean 63. 6 ± 11 years) were <b>positioned</b> in <b>supine,</b> right- and left-lateral positions. The patients served as their own controls. PA and PAW pressures were measured in each position. Data analysis included analysis of variance for repeated measures, post-hoc paired t-tests, and comparison to baseline pressure fluctuations. On average, PAS, PAED and PAM pressures in the left-lateral position were significantly different (p <. 05) from supine pressures. The largest position-related pressure difference occurred in the PAS (2. 0 ± 2. 1 mm Hg), while the maximum PAED and PAW pressure differences were 1. 4 ± 2. 7 mm Hg and 1. 6 ± 2. 4 mm Hg, respectively.
