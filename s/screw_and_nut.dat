With the introduction of the No. 4 Mk 2 rifle, the British refurbished many of their existing stocks of No. 4 rifles and brought them up to the same standard as the No. 4 Mk 2. No. 4 Mk 1 rifles so upgraded were re-designated No. 4 Mk I/2, whilst No. 4 Mk I* rifles that were brought up to Mk 2 standard were re-designated No. 4 Mk I/3.|$|E

40|$|There {{are many}} {{workbenches}} where the wooden screw in the vise {{is out of}} order {{after many years of}} use. To make new <b>screws</b> <b>and</b> <b>nuts</b> you need two tools, a screwbox to make the external threads and a tap to make the internal threads in the nut. The screwbox is a nut with internal threads where a v-shaped cutter has been placed in a precise position so that the external threads will go with the internal threads. In this essay details of great importance to obtain a well function screw are examined. Yellow birch has been used for the <b>screws</b> <b>and</b> <b>nuts.</b> Screwboxes with only one cutter has been examined and used. Details concerning the features of the tap have not been examined further. Ten screws of different age and eleven old screwboxes have been examined. The screwboxes have been drawn in scale 1 : 1. A test showing what importance the wood of the screw has to the result of the screw has been made. One old screwbox has been renovated and one has been made from pieces of birch and with a v-cutter from an old screwbox in order to detect details that affect the result of the screw.

50|$|Most {{electro-mechanical}} designs {{incorporate a}} lead <b>screw</b> <b>and</b> lead <b>nut.</b> Some use a ball <b>screw</b> <b>and</b> ball <b>nut.</b> In either case the screw may {{be connected to}} a motor or manual control knob either directly or {{through a series of}} gears. Gears are typically used to allow a smaller (and weaker) motor spinning at a higher rpm to be geared down to provide the torque necessary to spin the screw under a heavier load than the motor would otherwise be capable of driving directly. Effectively this sacrifices actuator speed in favor of increased actuator thrust. In some applications the use of worm gear is common as this allow a smaller built in dimension still allowing great travel length.|$|R

50|$|The {{three main}} {{elements}} of a typical planetary roller screw are the screw shaft, nut and planetary roller. The screw, a shaft with a multi-start V-shaped thread, provides a helical raceway for multiple rollers radially arrayed around the screw and encapsulated by a threaded nut. The thread of the screw is typically identical to the internal thread of the nut. The rollers spin in contact with, and serve as low-friction transmission elements between <b>screw</b> <b>and</b> <b>nut.</b> The rollers typically have a single-start thread with convex flanks that limit friction at the rollers' contacts with <b>screw</b> <b>and</b> <b>nut.</b> The rollers typically orbit the screw as they spin (in the manner of planet gears to sun gear), and are thus known as planetary, or satellite, rollers. As with a lead screw or ball screw, rotation of the nut results in screw travel, and rotation of the screw results in nut travel.|$|E
