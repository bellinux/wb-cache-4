5|$|In {{contrast}} to the confusion and loss of leadership aboard the American vessel, the British boarding party was being effectively organised. A number of small-arms men rushed aboard Chesapeake, led by Broke, including the purser, Mr G. Aldham, and the clerk, Mr John Dunn. Aldham and Dunn were killed as they crossed the gangway, {{but the rest of}} the party made it onto Chesapeake. Captain Broke, at the head of not more than twenty men, <b>stepped</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> rail of the waist-hammock netting onto the muzzle of the after-carronade of Chesapeake, and from there he jumped down to her quarterdeck. As the British boarded there were no American officers left on the quarterdeck to organise resistance.|$|E
25|$|After Moses' death, God told Moses' {{minister}} Joshua {{to cross}} the Jordan with the Israelites. God would give them every place on which Joshua <b>stepped,</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Negev desert to Lebanon, from the Euphrates to the Mediterranean Sea. God enjoined Joshua {{to be strong and}} of good courage, for none would be able to stand in his way, as God would lead him all of his life. God exhorted Joshua strictly to observe God's law, and to meditate on it day and night, so that he might succeed.|$|E
25|$|Another {{incident}} occurred in 1958 {{in a game}} against the Washington Senators. Williams struck out, and as he <b>stepped</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> batter's box swung his bat violently in anger. The bat slipped from his hands, was launched into the stands and struck a 60-year-old woman— one {{who turned out to be}} the housekeeper of the Red Sox general manager Joe Cronin. While the incident was an accident and Williams apologized to the woman personally, to all appearances it seemed at the time that Williams had hurled the bat in a fit of temper.|$|E

25|$|On Sunday, November 24, Oswald {{was being}} escorted by detectives through the {{basement}} of Dallas Police Headquarters toward an armored car that was {{to take him to}} the nearby county jail. At 11:21a.m. CST, Dallas nightclub operator Jack Ruby <b>stepped</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> crowd and shot Oswald once in the abdomen at close range. Oswald was taken unconscious by ambulance to Parkland Memorial Hospital—the same hospital where doctors tried to save President Kennedy's life two days earlier. Oswald died at 1:07p.m. Dallas police chief Jesse Curry announced Oswald's death on a TV news broadcast.|$|E
500|$|On March 24, 1958, Presley {{was drafted}} into the U.S. Army as a private at Fort Chaffee, near Fort Smith, Arkansas. His arrival was a major media event.

500|$|Prince Albert {{arrived at}} 10 a.m. at the Great Western Railway terminus. The royal train, {{conducted}} by Brunel himself, had taken {{two hours and}} forty minutes from London. There was a guard of honour {{of members of the}} police force, soldiers and dragoons and, as the Prince <b>stepped</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> train, the band of the Life Guards played works by Labitsky and a selection from the [...] "Ballet of Alma". Two sections of the platform were boarded off for the reception and it was noted by The Bristol Mirror that parts were covered with carpets from the Council House. The Prince Consort, dressed as a private gentleman, was accompanied by his equerry-in-waiting, personal secretary, the Marquess of Exeter, and Lords Wharncliffe, Liverpool, Lincoln and Wellesley.|$|E

500|$|Around 3 p.m., {{the cannon}} fire subsided, and 12,500 Southern {{soldiers}} <b>stepped</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ridgeline and advanced the {{three-quarters of a}} mile (1,200 m) to Cemetery Ridge in what is known to history as [...] "Pickett's Charge". As the Confederates approached, there was fierce flanking artillery fire from Union positions on Cemetery Hill and north of Little Round Top, and musket and canister fire from Hancock's II Corps. In the Union center, the commander of artillery had held fire during the Confederate bombardment (in order to save it for the infantry assault, which Meade had correctly predicted the day before), leading Southern commanders to believe the Northern cannon batteries had been knocked out. However, they opened fire on the Confederate infantry during their approach with devastating results. Nearly {{one half of the}} attackers did not return to their own lines.|$|E
2500|$|In 1999, Neil Young {{inducted}} McCartney {{into the}} Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and praised McCartney, saying: [...] "I loved that record {{because it was}} so simple.

2500|$|Deploying {{with the}} army on 11 May 1745, {{the day of the}} battle' he {{unexpectedly}} found himself, on reaching the crest of a low hill, {{face to face with the}} Gardes Françaises, who, though anticipating an engagement as little as Hay, showed no sign of disorder. According to the French accounts, of which Voltaire's is the best known, Lord Charles <b>stepped</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ranks and, in response to a similar movement promptly made by the French commander, politely called to him to order his people to fire, but in reply was assured, with equal politeness, that the French guards never fired first. According to the story which he himself sent in a letter to his brother three weeks later, his men came within twenty or thirty paces of the enemy, whereupon he advanced in front of the regiment, drank to the health of the French, bantered them with more spirit than pungency on their defeat at Dettingen, and then turned and called on his own men to huzzah, which they did. Hay recalled that [...] "it was our regiment that attacked the French Guards: and when we came to within twenty or thirty paces of them, I advanced before our regiment; drank to them and told them that we were the English Guards, and hoped they would stand till we came quite up to them, and not swim the Scheldt as they did the Main at Dettingen." ...|$|E
