40|$|Between 2008 and 2012 {{a wooden}} {{shipwreck}} from the 19 th century was located and recorded {{at the eastern}} entrance of the Kiel Firth {{at a depth of}} 18 metres. As a result of the investigation conducted by the Study Group for Maritime and Limnic Archaeology (AMLA) based at the Institute of Prehistoric and Protohistoric Archaeology, University of Kiel, the wreck can presumably be identified as the historically known yacht „Catharina Maria“, the owner of which was the Danish merchant and smuggler Christian Pedersen Norsk from Langeland. He was well-known for trading gunpowder to Lübeck and smuggling coffee in the western Baltic Sea region. According to the accident report, the 15 metre vessel sank in June 1893 during good weather without any information about the possible causes. At the time of sinking, the ship carried Faxechalk from the Danish Island Zealand. Although yachts were typical coastal vessels in the 18 th and 19 th centuries, {{little is known about the}} structural development, the rigging and the spread of this type of vessel and its importance for shipping in the western Baltic Sea region. The infestation of the shipwreck with the shipworm Teredo navalis and the ongoing destruction of the ship´s <b>stock</b> <b>anchor</b> clearly show that modern shipwrecks are endangered. Besides the Swedish warship “Hedwig Sophia” and the Danish warship “Lindormen”, the Danish yacht “Catharina Maria” is the third wreck, which could recently be investigated and identified on the coast of Schleswig-Holstein...|$|E

50|$|Portable {{beaching}} gear could be attached by ground crew {{so that the}} aircraft could be pulled up on land. The gear consisted {{of a pair of}} two-wheeled struts that could be attached to either side of the fuselage, below the wing, with a two- or four-wheel trolley and towbar attached under the rear of the hull. A standard <b>stocked</b> <b>anchor</b> was stowed in the forward compartment alongside the anchor winch. Depending on the operating area, a number of different kinds of anchor could be carried to cope with different anchorages. Another means of direction control on the water was by application of the rudder and aileron flight controls. The ailerons would cause asymmetric lift from the airflow and, ultimately, drop a float into the water to cause drag on that wing. The pilots could vary engine power to control the direction and speed of the aircraft on the water. In adverse combinations of tide, wind, and destination, this could be very difficult.|$|R

25|$|For centuries {{large numbers}} of lead bars have been found on the Mediterranean seabed, and there was debate over whether they were <b>anchor</b> <b>stocks</b> or not. It was argued by some that iron tipped wooden anchors secured by ropes were not heavy enough to be {{effective}} {{so they had to}} have metal stocks and there was considerable academic controversy over the issue. The Nemi ships, constructed during the transition period when iron anchors were replacing wooden ones, were the first Roman wrecks found to have intact anchors, and confirmed that the lead bars were indeed <b>anchor</b> <b>stocks.</b> Two types of anchor were found, one of oak with iron-tipped flukes and a stock of lead while the other was of iron with a folding timber stock that closely matched the design of the Admiralty pattern anchor re-invented in 1841. In the 1960s, a similar anchor was found in Pompeii and in 1974 another was found buried near Aberdarewllyn in Gwynedd, Wales. These further discoveries confirmed that these technologically advanced anchors were a standard Roman design.|$|R

It was still as dark as pitch, and save the white crest of a leaping wave nothing was to be seen beyond the side of the vessel. The mate was peering round him in despair at the ruin which had come so suddenly upon them when he found Captain Ephraim at his elbow, half clad, but as wooden and as serene as ever.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the typical}} anchor ({{expected}} {{value of the}} outflow or expected loss) used in the most popular decision rule of the stock management modeling, the “Anchoring and Adjustment Rule ” is studied for structures including a decaying <b>stock.</b> A new <b>anchor</b> (equilibrium value of loss) is proposed and compared with the expected loss formulation. We demonstrate that equilibrium value of loss formulation helps bringing the control stock to its desired level more rapidly. In addition, we show that managing a decaying stock in a stable way is difficult when the supply line is discrete. Standard stock adjustment and supply line adjustment terms anchored around expected loss can yield highly unstable oscillations. Counter-intuitively, for some cases, ignoring the supply line adjustment term may completely eliminate unwanted oscillations. If equilibrium value of loss is selected as the anchor and when the decay time (life time) is small enough, management of the stock can even be done by ignoring all the adjustment terms...|$|R
50|$|The first archaeological {{materials}} studied {{from the}} area were recovered from the seabed. This happened in 1974, when the first scuba diving clubs were set on the island. A series of amphorae dating from the 1st to the 4th centuries AD started to be found and recovered from the seabed, thus proving the presence of Roman ruins in this place. Five years later, the first underwater survey was carried out. Some of the amphora rims which were found presented stamps. Two of them read LEPMI BSCD and TEP/LOP. Also, some Late Empire amphorae (Dressel 26) were found. During the following years some archaeologists and historians from the island published articles on amphorae and different types of ceramics recovered from different underwater sites in Menorca. Some of the amphorae types which were identified were PE 17, 25 y 26. Also J.C. de Nicolás wrote about the Roman anchors found in Menorca, where he mentioned an <b>anchor</b> <b>stock</b> from Sanitja which weighed 26 kilograms.|$|R
40|$|The {{first chapter}} {{examines}} {{whether and how}} concentrated stock markets dominated by {{a small number of}} large firms affect economic growth. Using data from 47 countries worldwide relating to the period 19892013, I show that a countrys stock market concentration is negatively related to capital allocation efficiency, which results in sluggish IPO activity, innovation, and economic growth. These findings suggest that the structure of a concentrated stock market indicates insufficient funds for emerging, innovative firms; discourages entrepreneurship; and is ultimately detrimental to economic growth. In the second chapter, we challenge the finding of Weld, Michaely, Thaler, and Benartzi (2009). They find that the average nominal price of stocks listed on New York Stock Exchange and American Stock Exchange has been approximately $ 25 since the Great Depression and that this nominal price fixation is primarily a U. S. or North American phenomenon. Using a larger data set from 38 countries, we show that the nominal share prices of most stocks in every country are meanreverting and their best predictor is the beginning of sample period nominal stock prices. We demonstrate that corporate actions maintain these nominal <b>stock</b> price <b>anchors.</b> The third chapter investigates the executive pay gap between public and private firms. We find that the executive pay gap escalates when there is less supply in potential competent executives, when shareholders power is stronger, and when a stricter rule on monitoring and disclosure is enacted. These findings largely support the view of the competitive executive labor market hypothesis that executive compensation is determined by market forces and increases when executives bear additional risk. The findings are inconsistent with the argument of the entrenchment hypothesis...|$|R
60|$|He {{was a large}} {{powerful}} man, of that rugged {{build and}} hairy aspect that might have suggested {{the idea that he}} would be difficult to kill. He was a fair man, with red hair and a deeply sun-burned face, on which jovial good-humour sat almost perpetually enthroned. At the moment when we introduce him to the reader, however, that expression happened to be modified in consequence of his having laid him down to sleep in a sprawling manner on his back--the place as well as the position being, apparently, one of studied discomfort. His legs lay over the heel of the bowsprit; his big body reposed on a confused heap of blocks and cordage, and his neck rested on the <b>stock</b> of an <b>anchor,</b> so that his head hung down over it, presenting the face to view, with the large mouth wide open, in an upside down position. The man was evidently on the verge of choking, but, being a strong man, and a rugged man, and a healthy man, he did not care. He seemed to prefer choking to the trouble of rousing himself and improving his position.|$|R
40|$|As {{part of the}} FIRB 2001 Project, {{we started}} a {{computer}} research project on Roman merchants {{who worked in the}} Mediterranean area from the 3 rd century B. C. to the 3 rd century A. D. Data about the single businessmen were gathered from inscriptions (first of all instrumentum domesticum) and literary sources (both Greek and Latin); data were processed in a relational database, which is briefly described here. This paper, by way of an example, concerns merchants who lived during the Republic (over 250 people) and focuses on the economic and social aspects of their activity. Painted inscriptions (tituli picti) or graffiti on Roman amphorae, stamps on amphorae stoppers and marks on <b>anchor</b> <b>stocks</b> inform us of the names of many traders (most of all ingenui or freedmen) involved in the transport and sale of goods such as wine and olive oil. Other inscriptions (mainly epitaphs or religious dedications) refer to a lot of tabernarii who worked in Rome, in other towns of Roman Italy or the Provinces during the late 2 nd and 1 st centuries B. C. Some data from literary sources are also available, mainly concerning important businessmen who operated in the whole Mediterranean basin...|$|R
60|$|On the forecastle, {{the work}} went on badly, and thither Captain Crutchely proceeded. The second-mate scarce {{knew what he}} was about, and the captain took charge of the duty himself. At the same time he issued an order to Mark to get up tackles, and to clear away the launch, preparatory to getting that boat into the water. Hillson had bent the cable wrong, and much of the work had to be done over again. As soon as men get excited, as is apt to be the case when they find serious blunders made at {{critical}} moments, they are not always discreet. The precise manner in which Captain Crutchely met with the melancholy fate that befel him, was never known. It is certain that he jumped down on the anchor-stock, the anchor being a cock-bill, and that he ordered Mr. Hillson off of it. While thus employed, and at an instant when the cable was pronounced bent, and the men were in the act of getting inboard, the ship made a heavy roll, breakers again appeared all around her, the white foam rising nearly to the level of her rails. The captain was seen no more. There is little doubt that he was washed from the <b>anchor</b> <b>stock,</b> and carried away to leeward, {{in the midst of the}} darkness of that midnight hour.|$|R
5000|$|The Governor Philip, which {{arrived on}} Saturday last, from Moreton Bay and Port Macquarie, has {{brought up the}} crew of the ship America, bound from Hobart Town to Batavia, which was {{unfortunately}} wrecked on a coral reef, on the Northern Loo Islands. This disastrous occurrence took place about 1 o'clock in the morning of the 20th of June, when the vessel was running under three topsails and a foresail, {{in the midst of a}} black showery squall. All the sails were immediately clewed up and stowed, the stream <b>anchor</b> <b>stocked,</b> and every exertion made to endeavour to heave off, but without effect; particularly as the darkness of the night and the heavy sea, rendered it quite impossible to lower a boat. The ship, meanwhile, continued heavily beating on the reef, and in about an hour after she struck, began to fill very fast. At 3 o'clock, there was about four-feet-water in the hold, and all the rudder-bands, the rudder-trunk, and part of the counter had been carried away. At day light, it was found that the ship had bilged, as the fore-hold was nearly half full of water. With considerable difficulty the long-boat and pinnace were got out, together with some provisions and other necessaries with which the crew made for a small island, on the same reef, about two miles N.N. W. of the wreck, where they remained until the boats were rigged, when they set sail for Moreton Bay, which place they reached on the 27th of June. The following are some interesting particulars of the proceedings of the crew, from the time the vessel struck up to their safe arrival at Moreton Bay:Monday, June 20th_Early this day the ship's company were employed in getting out the long- boat and pinnace, which they at length accomplished, and loaded them with a few casks of provisions and water, and all the people's clothes. About 11 o'clock a. m. they left the ship and made for a small island about two miles off, and landed, after tome difficulty, on the reef, and the. crew employed themselves in carrying the light goods to the island, until high-water, when the long-boat und pinnace were safely discharged. The long-boat was anchored outside the reef, and the pinnnce hauled upon the beach. At high-water the reef is quite covered, but is dry at low-water. A tent was erected on the island, and the dry goods placed under it. The people caught a turtle this evening.21st.-The pinnace was manned and proceeded to the wreck, out of which various goods were taken. A party was also sent in search of water, and to ascertain what the island produced. Not the least sign of water, nor a single fruit, of any kind, were found. The reef was covered with turtle, and the island abounded with birds, consisting, principally, of doves, magpies and sea fowl. This [...] "day the people shifted their tent to a more convenient spot among some trees, and. Under all the circumstances, made a tolerably comfortable abitation. Weather hot and sultry. Lat."23 44'.22d.-The pinnace and her crew were again dispatched to the wreck, and brought off various articles. A party also walked across the reef, to a dry part of which a rope was passed from the wreck, and by this means a great deal of property was saved. The labour, however, was excessive, owing, particularly, to the difficulty of walking on the reef, as the coral gave way almost at every step. The people's feet were dreadfully cut. A turtle was caught to-day, weighing: nearly 4 cwt. Crew all in good heath, and excellent spirits.23d.-Every thing of any use had been removed by this time, and the long-boat made ready for sea. The water began to get very low, without any prospect of obtaining a further supply. All the boats were got ready, and the people determined to make for Moreton Bay.24th to 30t/i.-Ready for sea, but waiting for a fair wind.July 1st to 6th.-Wind still foul.7th.-Early this morning the people put to sea with a fair wind at N.W. The day was remarkably fine, with a steady breeze throughout.8th.-The weather very unfavourable sea running high, with a fresh breeze. A quantity of provisions, and other stores, had been thrown overboard, from the long boat, to keep her from swamping. In the course of the night of the 7th, the boats passed an island, for which they this day bore up, and towards night, got under its lee.9th.-The crew landed took out all the boats cargo, and set to work to make them more sea-worthy. The main land of New South Wales was discernable from this island, on which the people remained till the 16th, when they were obliged to leave for want of water.16th:-Sailed, and on the following morning the boats were under the main land. Nothing particular occurred this day (l7th) or night, during the whole of which the boats sailed under the land.18th-About 12 o'clock p. m. the people went ashore on an island close to the main, where they fortunately found water, and having taken in a supply proceeded on their voyage.The weather was in general fine from this time up to the 27th, when the shipwrecked mariners reached Moreton Bay in safety, where they were most kindly received, and every assistance afforded them by the Commandant, of whose gentlemanly and humane conduct the sailors are loud in praise.|$|R
