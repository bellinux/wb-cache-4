5|$|Still {{awaiting}} imperial {{permission to}} build in the courtyard, the Perushim wished to rely on an old firman given to the Jews in 1623, which stated {{that there could be}} no objection to them building in their own quarters. Having received a <b>supporting</b> <b>document</b> issued by the Qadi of Jerusalem in March 1824, it was possible for them begin rebuilding the dwellings in the courtyard. In practice, however, construction never materialised as they were unable to exercise their authority over the plot of land. This was apparently due to confrontation with the Arab squatters and the local government's disregard of the <b>documents</b> <b>proving</b> their ownership of the courtyard.|$|R

To retrieve such entity, people usually first locate a small set of <b>support</b> <b>documents</b> which contain answer entities, and then further detect the answer entities in this set. In the literature, people view the <b>support</b> <b>documents</b> as relevant documents, and their findings as a conventional document retrieval problem.
