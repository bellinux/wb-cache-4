5|$|On 5 May {{the number}} of ZNG troops and their {{composition}} was determined, followed by operational guidelines issued by Defence and Interior Ministers Martin Špegelj and Josip Boljkovac for the transfer of police personnel to the ZNG on 10 May. By 15 May several special police units (SPUs) transferred to the ZNG, forming four brigades. By July the ZNG had approximately 8,000 troops and, unlike other Croatian forces, were fully equipped with <b>small</b> <b>arms.</b> The reserve police force, numbering about 39,000 in April, was also transferred to reserve ZNG brigades and independent battalions. On 18 May the Zrinski Battalion was established as a special forces unit of the ZNG, its core consisting of 27 volunteers drawn from the Kumrovec SPU. Initially, it also relied on former French Foreign Legion troops. By July, the reserve force of 40,000 ZNG troops was assigned to 19 brigades and 14 independent battalions; however, they did not possess sufficient heavy or <b>small</b> <b>arms</b> for all their personnel. The Croatian police had approximately 15,000 <b>small</b> <b>arms,</b> with less than 30,000 additional weapons obtained from abroad by August.|$|E

5|$|As Revenge was {{the nearest}} {{of the three}} pirate vessels to the Americans, Allen ordered Alligator boats lowered to run inshore and attack her. Some 40 men armed with <b>small</b> <b>arms</b> were put into the boats, with Allen {{personally}} taking command of the launch, Lieutenant Dale the cutter, and midshipman Henley the gig. Revenge was already underway {{by the time it}} was sighted and attempted to escape the Americans despite the lack of wind, using its sweeps. After the American boats had rowed about , the pirate schooner made an about-face and raised a red flag. Upon approaching the pirates, the American craft were fired on with both grape and round shot. The American boats returned fire with <b>small</b> <b>arms</b> and moved in to board the vessel. Rather than try to fight off the boarding attempt, the pirates abandoned Revenge while another schooner covered their escape. Alligator gig manned by Henley and four men was sent off to take Revenge as a prize.|$|E
5|$|Based on his {{research}} for the book and mini-series The Pacific, author Hugh Ambrose suggested that Basilone was not killed by a mortar, but by <b>small</b> <b>arms</b> fire that {{hit him in the}} right groin and the neck, and nearly took off his left arm.|$|E

40|$|PC Based <b>Small</b> <b>Arm</b> Robot {{project is}} {{represented}} a <b>small</b> <b>arm</b> robot that controlled by Personal Computer (PC) using Graphical User Interface (GUI). The idea behind {{this project is}} able to enhance the student knowledge about industrial robot application. Basically, this project {{is focused on the}} designing the system include controlling elements. The project was involving mechanical part, hardware and software. These three elements are the main system of this project. A <b>small</b> <b>arm</b> robot is a mechanical part that represented the system output overall. Besides that, the Graphical User Interface (GUI) is developed by using Visual Basic software acted as the panel control through the personal computer (PC). The hardware element of the project is microcontroller circuit in order to manipulate and control the final system. As the additional information, a <b>small</b> <b>arm</b> robot has five degree of freedom (DOF) based on human’s arm. These all degree of freedoms is functioned as joint which is base, shoulder, elbow, wrist and end-effectors. The <b>small</b> <b>arm</b> robot is totally run by servo motors. For this project, the system is interfaced by using Atmel microcontroller. The Atmel microcontroller can manipulate the movement of <b>small</b> <b>arm</b> robot according to the Graphical User Interface (GUI) data signal. Data signal from personal computer (PC) triggered the function program code in microcontroller as the output signal that controls the servo motor rotational motions. Communication between personal computer (PC) and microcontroller circuit is connected by the serial communication integrated circuit (IC) that combined with microcontroller board...|$|R
5|$|In April, the Bosnian Serbs {{were able}} to deploy 200,000 troops, {{hundreds}} of tanks, armoured personnel carriers (APCs) and artillery pieces.

5|$|Meanwhile, {{across the}} river in the American AO the US 1/503rd Battalion had {{uncovered}} a large Viet Cong bunker system and became involved in fierce fighting that had included desperate hand-to-hand combat, with both sides resorting to using bayonets. Throughout the morning the Australians had heard the increasing crescendo of firing as the battle raged; however, as neither they nor the US 2/503rd Battalion had been called on to reinforce the US 1/503rd Battalion they had pressed on. The American paratroopers had contacted a well-equipped Viet Cong Main Force regiment, complete with khaki uniforms, steel helmets and Soviet automatic weaponry and <b>small</b> <b>arms.</b> The fighting across the Song Dong Nai continued into the afternoon, before subsiding into sporadic sniper and <b>small</b> <b>arms</b> fire in the later afternoon and early evening. During the fighting, Specialist Lawrence Joel—a medic—distinguished himself tending to his wounded comrades while under heavy fire. He was subsequently awarded the Medal of Honor.|$|E

40|$|Remote {{handling}} {{in nuclear}} waste management requires a robotic system with precise motion {{as well as}} a large workspace. The concept of a <b>small</b> <b>arm</b> mounted {{on the end of a}} large arm may satisfy such needs. However, the performance of such a serial configuration lacks payload capacity which is a crucial factor for handling a massive object. Also, this configuration induces more flexibility on the structure. To overcome these problems, the topology of bracing the tip of the <b>small</b> <b>arm</b> (not the large arm) and having an end effector in the middle of the chain is proposed in this paper. Also, control of these cooperating disparate manipulators is accomplished in computer simulations. Thus, this robotic system can have the accuracy of the <b>small</b> <b>arm,</b> and at the same time, it can have the payload capacity and large workspace of the large arm...|$|R
5|$|Since the {{collimated}} image {{produced by}} the sight is only truly parallax free at infinity, the sight has an error circle equal to {{the diameter of the}} collimating optics for any target at a finite distance. Depending on the eye position behind the sight and the closeness of the target this induces some aiming error. For larger targets at a distance (given the non-magnifying, quick target acquisitions nature of the sight) this aiming error is considered trivial. On <b>small</b> <b>arms</b> aimed at close targets this is compensated for by keeping the reticle {{in the middle of the}} optical window (sighting down its optical axis). Some manufacturers of <b>small</b> <b>arms</b> sights also make models with the optical collimator set at a finite distance. This gives the sight parallax due to eye movement the size of the optical window at close range which diminishes to a minimal size at the set distance (somewhere around a desired target range of 25-50 yards).|$|E
5|$|Soon after Hampel's {{assumption}} of command, {{he became aware}} that local Chetniks were scavenging the Operation Vollmond battlefields for divisional equipment.

5|$|The North Korean People's Army {{was able}} to {{maintain}} transport to its front lines over long lines of communications despite heavy and constant air attacks. The United Nations air effort failed to halt military rail transport. Ammunition and motor fuel, which took precedence over all other types of supply, continued {{to arrive at the}} front, though in smaller amounts than before. There was still a considerable resupply of heavy weapons, such as tanks, artillery, and mortars, at the front in early September, although a steady decline in artillery can be traced from the middle of August. There was a sufficient supply of <b>small</b> <b>arms</b> ammunition, but a shortage of <b>small</b> <b>arms</b> themselves became apparent by mid-August and continued to worsen with each passing week. Rear areas were able to fill only about one third of the requisitions from the front for <b>small</b> <b>arms</b> in mid-August and resupply ceased entirely about the middle of September. New trucks were almost impossible to obtain. There was no resupply of clothing. At best there were rations for only one or two meals a day. Most units had to live at least partially off the South Korean populace, scavenging for food and supplies at night. By September 1 the food situation was so bad in the North Korean Army at the front that most of the soldiers showed a loss of stamina with resulting impaired combat effectiveness. At the same time, seriously wounded North Korean soldiers were often not transported to the rear for medical services, and many died while stranded on the front line.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} four weapons (the Trinity gadget, Little Boy, Fat Man, and an unused bomb) were {{produced}} {{by the end of}} 1945, making the average cost per bomb around $500million in 1945 dollars.

5|$|At 03:00, {{just before}} dawn, Spragg took {{command of the}} trench in the {{southern}} sector of No.3 Post, opposite where the Turks appeared to be gathering their forces to assault the post. He successfully deployed his men {{so that when the}} attack began, it was met and broken up by the New Zealanders' <b>small</b> <b>arms</b> fire. But by 03:30 the post was under sustained Turkish rifle and grenade attack and the relieving 2nd Squadron was still held up on a ridge to the south of the post. Between them and No.3 Post was a strong Turkish force which had dug in and were in communication with the Turkish attackers in the gully {{to the north of the}} post. However, the 2nd Squadron could now bring their own <b>small</b> <b>arms</b> fire onto the Turks attacking No.3 Post, making them keep their heads down. At daylight Elmslie led a troop in an attack which captured a Turkish trench to the left of the post. At 06:30 communications were re-established with No.3 Post by using signal flags, and Allied artillery were able to bring harassing fire onto the Turkish communications trenches. But by now the defenders were running short of supplies, especially ammunition, and no one could be spared to look after the wounded, who had to see to themselves.|$|E
