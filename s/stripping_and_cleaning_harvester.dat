50|$|Once glazing or carbon {{build up}} has occurred, {{it can only}} be cured by {{stripping}} down the engine and re-boring the cylinder bores, machining new honing marks <b>and</b> <b>stripping,</b> <b>cleaning</b> <b>and</b> de-coking combustion chambers, fuel injector nozzles and valves. If the problem is detected in its early stages, running an engine at maximum load to raise the internal pressures and temperatures allows the piston rings to scrape glaze off the bores and allows carbon build-up to be burnt off. However, if glazing has been allowed to progress to the stage where the piston rings have seized into their grooves, this will not have any effect.|$|R

By using a standard UV mask aligner as an exposure tool followed by immersion development, thick resist layers up to 100 mu m could be patterned in a single step on pre-processed silicon wafers. Repeated exposure and development were successfully used for structuring resist layers of up to 200 mu m thick. High aspect ratios of more than 10, as well as steep edges of more than 88 degrees could be fabricated. The resist patterns were moulded by using pulse or DC electroplating.

40|$|In this article, {{the authors}} {{investigate}} {{the formation and}} removal of resist residues with the main objective to improve the reliability of transistor gate fabrication. Device performance {{is strongly dependent on}} the quality of metal contacts and the interface between gate metal and substrates. Reliable transistor fabrication becomes increasingly difficult as transistor dimensions shrink. Residual resist layers can become significant if wet or dry etching steps are required for gate recessing, e. g., for high electron mobility transistors or the removal of thin oxide layers in III-V metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor fabrication. They observe two sorts of residual resist layers in polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) : exposed and nonexposed. Exposed residuals have been observed by many groups in electron beam exposed and developed regions of PMMA. In this article, they show that the observed granularity lies on top of a continuous residual film and consider this effect on gate fabrication. They also present evidence of a nonexposed residual layer observed in regions of unexposed resist which have been subject to a standard solvent based resist <b>strip</b> <b>and</b> <b>cleaning</b> procedure. They further demonstrate that CV measurement techniques can be used to detect the presence of residual layers of resist...|$|R

Usually, the thickness of LN wafer is 0. 5 mm and that is beyond the requirement for thickness of photoelectric sensitive element.

40|$|Very thick {{photoresist}} layers were patterned by contact ultraviolet (UV) lithography. In {{a following}} microelectrodeposition step the generated resist patterns were molded and three-dimensional (3 D) microstructures were fabricated directly onto system surfaces. The new technology, called 3 D UV-microforming, {{consists of an}} advanced resist preparation process, an UV lithographic step, resist development, a molding procedure by electrodeposition, <b>and</b> finally <b>stripping</b> <b>and</b> <b>cleaning</b> for finishing the structures. It enables the low-cost fabrication {{of a wide variety}} of microcomponents for many different uses. During resist preparation, layers up to 200 mu m thickness were obtained. By using a standard UV mask aligner as an exposure tool followed by immersion development, thick resist layers up 100 mu m could be patterned in a single step on preprocessed silicon wafers. Repeated exposure and development were successfully used for structuring resist layers of up to 200 mu m thickness. Using AZ 4000 Series photoresist, the resolution is also limited by mechanical stability. For lines and spaces in 15 - mu m-thick resist a minimum width of 3 mu m for the resist was found to be necessary to overcome the fabrication process. For thicker layers high aspect ratios of more than 10 as well as steep edges of more than 88 degrees could be fabricated. The resist patterns used were molded by pulse or by direct current electroplating. For microsystem applications some metals and alloys were deposited. Three-dimensional microcomponents were fabricated as samples for demonstrating the new technique.

5000|$|The Model 4006 {{has been}} used by many law {{enforcement}} agencies as a standard duty sidearm, including by the California Highway Patrol, California State Parks and Rec., and until recently, the Colorado State Patrol. California State Parks and Rec, carried the Smith & Wesson model 4006-CHP from 1996 to 2009, as the primary duty weapon issued to State Park Peace Officers. The 4006-CHP was unique in that it had an adjustable rear sight (no fixed Novak rear sight), no trigger play spring, and was engraved with the State's Grizzly Bear logo and the words California State Parks under it. Additionally, the slide, frame, and barrel were engraved with a unique identification number, which started with PR, which stood for Parks and Recreation. This number helped department armorers keep track of when a weapon went into service, who it was issued to, and kept State Park Peace Officers from inadvertently swapping parts with other officers during field <b>stripping</b> <b>and</b> <b>cleaning,</b> as the three main parts were hand-fitted. California State Parks and Rec. used other variants of the 4006, from 1996 to 2009, State Park Peace Officers K9 handlers were issued the 4006-TSW, with a tactical light, to free up their off hand for dog handling; also, investigators and command staff were issued the smaller, aluminum-framed version, the 4013-TSW. As of September 2009, both the California State Parks and Rec. Department and the Colorado State Patrol have both retired the venerable 4006 in favor of the lighter and more versatile Smith & Wesson M&P 40, also chambered in [...]40 S&W.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} SERDP project CP- 1038 is to {{evaluate}} and develop non-thermal plasma (NTP) reactor technology for Department of Defense (DoD) air emissions control applications. The primary focus is on oxides of nitrogen (NO{sub x}) and a secondary focus on hazardous air pollutants (HAPs), especially volatile organic compounds (VOCs).
