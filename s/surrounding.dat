5000|$|... 7.1 {{sound is}} the common name for an eight-channel <b>surround</b> audio system {{commonly}} used in home theatre configurations. It adds two additional speakers to the more conventional six-channel (5.1) audio configuration. As with 5.1 <b>surround</b> sound, 7.1 <b>surround</b> sound positional audio uses the standard front, center, and LFE (subwoofer) speaker configuration. However, whereas a 5.1 <b>surround</b> sound system combines both <b>surround</b> and rear channel effects into two channels (commonly configured in home theatre set-ups as two rear <b>surround</b> speakers), a 7.1 <b>surround</b> system splits the <b>surround</b> and rear channel information into four distinct channels, in which sound effects are directed to left and right <b>surround</b> channels, plus two rear <b>surround</b> channels.|$|R
