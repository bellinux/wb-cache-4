40|$|This article {{offers a}} {{critical}} analysis of some contemporary attempts to bring up <b>the</b> issue <b>of</b> God and religion again in philosophical discourse, after <b>the</b> disenchantment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> project <b>of</b> Enlightenment. At first the author analyses G. Vattimo’s recent book Belief, in which he repudiates the violence and oppression of technically manipulating and politically controlling reason. In order {{to put an end}} to this violence, Vattimo argues in favour of a complete historicisation and secularisation of Christianity, which has caritas as its limit. The author criticises Vattimo on the point that his thinking leads to a subjectivation of religion and truth, and therefore is unable to stop <b>the</b> violence <b>of</b> reason. Secondly, Ch. Taylor’s interpretation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> malaise <b>of</b> modernity is analysed. He considers Christianity as a <b>safeguard</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intrinsically <b>good</b> and true, which enables contemporary thinking to overcome its subjectivism. As a conclusion, the author stresses <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> religious idea <b>of</b> irreducible transcendence as confining <b>the</b> violence <b>of</b> self-willed thinking...|$|R
40|$|The {{modalities}} that {{active citizenship}} finds to act (in social, environmental, cultural contexts, etc.), {{developed in the}} last few years in Europe, with or without the institutional support, have represented an important resource for <b>the</b> growth and <b>safeguard</b> <b>of</b> common <b>goods.</b> <b>The</b> territory is the place where individual and community’s needs and rights emerge and they can only be satisfied when citizens participate to public life adopting new modalities. However, active citizenship does not always acquire those features that make it formally recognized as an association with a specific role within the public area. Sometimes, it rather appears as an extemporary mobilization that fades away as soon as the strong call becomes weaker; sometimes, also, it happens to pursue different purposes related to specific pressing urges. This paper will analyze <b>the</b> various forms <b>of</b> active citizenship (from voluntary associations to civic organizations up to defining real collective mobilizations), examining its modalities <b>of</b> intervention and <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> involvement in public policies. Such forms of activism open interesting questions for a survey concerning the capability that citizens have in creating social capitals and in cooperating for <b>the</b> <b>safeguard</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> general interest...|$|R
