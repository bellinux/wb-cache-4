5|$|Considerably {{shorter than}} the average footballer at 5ft 7in, Gibbs made up for his {{physical}} disadvantage with positional play, determination, accurate tackling, and <b>staying</b> <b>on</b> his feet.

The diamond's journey to Monaco took three weeks, {{with the use of}} three men with identical briefcases, of which only one held the actual diamond. The men flew from New York to Nice in France, and upon entering Monaco an armed guard with a machine gun gave further protection to the diamond. The couple were in Monaco to celebrate Princess Grace's fortieth birthday at the 'Scorpio Ball', a gala ball held at the Hermitage Hotel in Monte Carlo. The briefcase that contained the diamond also held three 50¢ pairs of stockings that Taylor would buy in New York and were unavailable elsewhere, and Taylor was just as excited to receive the stockings as the diamond.|$|E

Race officials later decided to alter the course, <b>staying</b> <b>on</b> the Italian side of the Alps, believing the stretches that were to take place in France were too remote and that radio communication in the area could not be assured. The course as it originally was designed mimicked exactly a course used in the 1949 Giro d'Italia.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{successful}} collaboration on the pitch, {{a strong}} personal rivalry developed between Ramsey and Nicholson, partly because both {{liked the idea}} of <b>staying</b> <b>on</b> at Tottenham in a coaching role after retiring.

Another challenge to Ramsey's position at Tottenham {{came in the form of}} Danny Blanchflower, a Northern Ireland international wing-half signed from Aston Villa to replace Nicholson. Blanchflower was a more attacking player than Nicholson and thus did not provide the necessary cover for Ramsey to advance upfield; Ramsey also resented the idea that Blanchflower might supplant him as Tottenham's main strategist.|$|E
