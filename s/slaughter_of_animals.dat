5|$|Bal Gangadhar Tilak has {{credited}} Jainism {{with the}} cessation of <b>slaughter</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> in the brahamanical religion. Some scholars have traced the origin of Ahimsa to Jains and their precursor, the sramanas. According to Thomas McEvilley, a noted Indologist, certain seals of Indus Valley civilisation depict a meditative figure surrounded by a multitude of wild animals, providing evidence of proto yoga tradition in India akin to Jainism. This particular image might suggest that all the animals depicted are sacred to this particular practitioner. Consequently, these animals would be protected from harm.|$|E
25|$|When the Temple existed, most sacrifices and offerings {{could only}} be {{conducted}} by priests. Non-priest Levites (i.e. all those who descended from Levi, the son of Jacob, but not from Aaron) performed {{a variety of other}} Temple roles, including ritual <b>slaughter</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals,</b> song service by use of voice and musical instruments, and various tasks in assisting the priests in performing their service.|$|E
25|$|During 1996, {{the debate}} over the {{practice}} of shechita (Jewish religious <b>slaughter</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals)</b> in Finland continued. Although a motion to pass a law prohibiting shechita (on animal rights grounds) was defeated in December 1995, thereby allowing the practice to continue in Finland (on the condition that the slaughtering takes place simultaneously with a stunning blow), parties opposed to shehitah were not satisfied. The debate has spanned several years, became an election issue during the 1995 general election and often took on an unpleasant tone, as the proponents of the ban (some of whom were politicians) equated shehitah with female circumcision and mutilation.|$|E

25|$|The {{founder of}} Chabad also instituted various other Halachic rulings, {{including}} the use of stainless steel knives for the <b>slaughter</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> before human consumption, which is by now universally accepted in all sects of Judaism.|$|R
25|$|In February 2014, Minister for Food, Agriculture and Fisheries Dan Jørgensen {{signed a}} {{regulation}} which banned ritual <b>slaughter</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> without prior stunning. Prior to this, religious groups could file for an exemption {{to the law}} that required stunning {{if they wanted to}} slaughter without prior stunning, although no groups had applied for such exemption. At the time, all halal slaughter in Denmark was performed with prior stunning, while kosher slaughter (which does not allow stunning) had not been practiced in Denmark since around 2004, all kosher meat being imported. In spite of this, the Muslim and Jewish Communities in Denmark strongly opposed the decree, arguing that it constituted an infringement upon religious freedom.|$|E
25|$|Hunting {{often had}} {{elaborate}} preparations, such as fasting and religious rituals performed by medicine men {{before and after}} the hunt. In Lipan culture, since deer were protected by Mountain Spirits, great care was taken in Mountain Spirit rituals in order to ensure smooth deer hunting. Also the <b>slaughter</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> must be performed following certain religious guidelines (many of which are recorded in religious stories) from prescribing how to cut the animals, what prayers to recite, and proper disposal of bones. A common practice among Southern Athabascan hunters was the distribution of successfully slaughtered game. For example, among the Mescalero a hunter was expected to share as much as one half of his kill with a fellow hunter and with needy people back at the camp. Feelings of individuals concerning this practice spoke of social obligation and spontaneous generosity.|$|E
25|$|Most {{evidence}} of Christian practice comes from monks and is heavily biased towards monastic life. From {{this can be}} seen the daily cycle of prayers and the celebration of the Mass. Less well recorded, but as significant, was the role of bishops and their clergy. Bishops dealt with the leaders of the tuath, ordained clergy and consecrated churches. They also had responsibilities for the poor, hungry, prisoners, widows and orphans. Priests carried out baptisms, masses and burials. They also prayed for the dead and offered sermons. They anointed the sick with oil, brought communion to the dying and administered penance to sinners. The church encouraged alms giving and hospitality. It also dictated in moral and legal matters, including marriage and inheritance. It also impinged on other elements of everyday life through its rules on fasting, diet, the <b>slaughter</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> and rules on purity and ritual cleansing.|$|E

25|$|Various ethical reasons {{have been}} {{suggested}} for choosing vegetarianism, usually predicated on the interests of non-human animals. In many societies, controversy and debate have arisen over the ethics of eating animals. Some people, while not vegetarians, refuse to eat the flesh of certain animals due to cultural taboo, such as cats, dogs, horses or rabbits. Others support meat eating for scientific, nutritional and cultural reasons, including religious ones. Some meat eaters abstain from the meat of animals reared in particular ways, such as factory farms, or avoid certain meats, such as veal or foie gras. Some people follow vegetarian or vegan diets not because of moral concerns involving the raising or consumption of animals in general, but {{because of concerns about}} the specific treatment and practises involved in the raising and <b>slaughter</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals,</b> i.e. factory farming and the industrialisation of animal slaughter. Others still avoid meat because meat production is claimed to place a greater burden on the environment than production of an equivalent amount of plant protein.|$|E

500|$|Culture in the Anuradhapura Kingdom {{was largely}} based on Buddhism with the <b>slaughter</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> for food {{considered}} low and unclean. As a result, animal husbandry, except for the rearing of buffalo and cattle, was uncommon. Elephants and horses were prestige symbols, and could only be afforded by the nobility. The skills needed to train and care for these animals were highly regarded [...] Cattle and buffalo were used for ploughing and preparing paddy fields. Dairy products formed {{an important part of}} people's diets while Pali and Sinhala literature often refer to five products obtained from the cow: milk, curd, buttermilk, ghee and butter. Bullocks and bullock carts were also used for transport.|$|E
5000|$|Shelley was {{a strong}} {{advocate}} for social justice for the [...] "lower classes".

500|$|Hitler {{followed}} a vegetarian diet. At social events he sometimes gave graphic {{accounts of the}} <b>slaughter</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> {{in an effort to}} make his guests shun meat. Bormann had a greenhouse constructed near the Berghof (near Berchtesgaden) to ensure a steady supply of fresh fruit and vegetables for Hitler. Hitler publicly avoided alcohol. He occasionally drank beer and wine in private, but gave up drinking because of weight gain in 1943. He was a non-smoker for most of his adult life, but smoked heavily in his youth (25 to 40 cigarettes a day); he eventually quit, calling the habit [...] "a waste of money". He encouraged his close associates to quit by offering a gold watch to anyone able to break the habit. Hitler began using amphetamine occasionally after 1937 and became addicted to it in late 1942. Speer linked this use of amphetamine to Hitler's increasingly erratic behavior and inflexible decision making (for example, rarely allowing military retreats).|$|E
500|$|During {{the winter}} months of May–August the {{scientists}} were busy in their laboratories, while elsewhere equipment and stores were prepared for the next season's work. For relaxation there were amateur theatricals, and educational activities {{in the form of}} lectures. A newspaper, the South Polar Times, was edited by Shackleton. Outside pursuits did not cease altogether; there was football on the ice, and the schedule of magnetic and meteorological observations was maintained. As winter ended, trial sledge runs resumed, to test equipment and rations in advance of the planned southern journey which Scott, Wilson and Shackleton were to undertake. Meanwhile, a party under Royds travelled to Cape Crozier to leave a message at the post there, and discovered an emperor penguin colony. Another group, under Armitage, reconnoitred in the mountains to the west, returning in October with the expedition's first symptoms of scurvy. Armitage later blamed the outbreak on Scott's [...] "sentimental objection" [...] to the <b>slaughter</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> for fresh meat. The entire expedition's diet was quickly revised, and the trouble was thereafter contained.|$|E
500|$|In Iron Age and Early Medieval Northern Europe, {{the term}} blót {{referred}} to animal sacrifice performed {{to thank the}} deities and gain their favor. Such sacrifices have generally proved impractical for most modern practitioners, {{due to the fact}} that skills in animal slaughter are not widely taught, while the <b>slaughter</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> is regulated by government in Western countries. In 2007 Strmiska noted that a [...] "small but growing" [...] number of Heathen practitioners in the U.S. had begun performing animal sacrifice as a part of blót. Those who do so typically follow the procedure outlined in the Heimskringla: the throat of the sacrificial animal is slashed with a sharp knife, and the blood is collected in a bowl before being sprinkled onto both participants of the rite and statues of the gods. Animals used for this purpose have included poultry as well as larger mammals like sheep and pigs, with the meat then being consumed by those attending the rite. Some practitioners have made alterations to this procedure: Strmiska noted two American Heathens who decided to use a rifle shot to the head to kill the animal swiftly, a decision made after they witnessed a blót in which the animal's throat was cut incorrectly and it slowly died in agony; they felt that such practices would have displeased the gods and accordingly brought harm upon those carrying out the sacrifice.|$|E
50|$|Pehowa is {{considered}} religious place of high importance and {{to highlight the}} sanctity of the place, Haryana State Government has banned sale, possession, consumption and purchase of non-vegetarian food in the town limits. <b>Slaughtering</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> is also banned in the town through the court orders. The town {{is considered}} sacred to Ahirs, Hindus and Sikhs.|$|R
5000|$|In Spain, {{where he}} was called [...] "Ashkenazi" [...] (German), he met the {{foremost}} rabbinical authorities, who thought highly of him. Dan, however, was so imprudent as to give a letter of recommendation to a youth who pretended to be a prophet (compare Abraham Of Avila); and when the latter turned it to account, Solomon Adret cast scorn upon the German rabbi in his circular letter on the pseudoprophet. Even before this occurrence the relations between these two men {{do not seem to}} have been very friendly, since Dan declared at Saragossa that, from the strict {{point of view of the}} Halakah, there could be no objection to the <b>slaughtering</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> by Christians, as the reason given in the Talmud for forbidding the <b>slaughtering</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> by pagans did not apply to Christians; for the pagan regarded the slaughtering as a sacrifice to his idols, while the same could not be said of the Christians.|$|R

2500|$|Today, it is {{acknowledged}} by historians that Hitler – at least {{during the war}} – followed a vegetarian diet. [...] At social events, he sometimes gave graphic accounts of the <b>slaughter</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> {{in an effort to}} make his dinner guests shun meat. An antivivisectionist, Hitler may have followed his selective diet out of a profound concern for animals. Bormann had a greenhouse constructed near the Berghof (near Berchtesgaden) to ensure a steady supply of fresh fruit and vegetables for Hitler throughout the war.|$|E
2500|$|In 1582, Emperor Akbar invited Hiravijaya Suri {{to explain}} him the {{principles}} of Jainism. He first discussed the various aspects of religion and philosophy with Abul Fazal and the [...] later with Akbar. The emperor {{was so impressed with}} Hiravijaya Suri that he bestowed on him the title of Jagatguru which means World Teacher or the Preceptor of the World. Akbar was so much influenced by the religion of non-violence preached by the Jain monk that he became vegetarian most of the days, prohibited <b>slaughter</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> and birds, released prisoners and gave up fishing and hunting which were his favourite pastime. Hiravijaya is reported to have told Akbar: [...] "How could a man’s stomach be a tomb of animals?" [...] creating an aversion for meat eating in mind of Akbar. Out of respect for Jainism, Akbar declared firmans (royal decree) for Amari Ghosana banning the killing of animals during the Jain festivals of Paryusana and Mahavir Jayanti. He rolled back the Jazia tax from Jain pilgrim places like Palitana. Furthermore, he issued firmans for ban on <b>slaughter</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> for six months in Gujarat, abolishing the confiscation of property of deceased persons and removal of the Sujija Tax (Jazia) and a Sulka (possibly a tax on pilgrims).|$|E
25|$|In rabbinical {{interpretation}} {{a continuing}} {{application of the}} commandment is identified.

2500|$|Collective {{living and}} {{rational}} division of domestic responsibility was a primary tenet of Fourierism. During {{its first two}} or three years of existence, extreme frugality was deemed necessary, and only [...] "scanty" [...] meals were served at the common table. The situation was further complicated by the presence of significant numbers of associationists with specific dietary beliefs, including contingents of vegetarians and Christian sectarians who foreswore the use of all products produced at the cost of a sacrifice of life. The effect was disruptive, with the moderate and extreme vegetarians agitating against the <b>slaughter</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> and the consumption of meat.|$|E
2500|$|The main [...] "organic fertilizers" [...] are peat, animal wastes, plant wastes from agriculture, {{and treated}} sewage sludge (biosolids).
