50|$|The 3830 Model 2 <b>storage</b> <b>control</b> and {{associated}} Integrated Storage Controls announced in August 1972were {{the first instance}} of a <b>storage</b> <b>control</b> as a director for A-Units.|$|E
50|$|In {{nonsynchronous}} operation, {{the transfer}} of data between the channel and the <b>storage</b> <b>control</b> is not synchronized with {{the transfer of}} data between the <b>storage</b> <b>control</b> and the device. Channel programs can be executed such that channel and <b>storage</b> <b>control</b> activities required to end execution of one command and advance to the next {{do not have to}} occur during the inter-record gap between two adjacent fields. An intermediate buffer in the <b>storage</b> <b>control</b> allows independent operations between the channel and the device. A major advantage of ECKDs is far longer cables; depending upon application it may improve performance.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} types of Service Modules used in the Intel Modular Server System; the <b>Storage</b> <b>Control</b> Module, the Ethernet Switch Module, and the Chassis Management Module. An Intel Modular Server Chassis {{accommodates}} one Chassis Management Module, up to two <b>Storage</b> <b>Control</b> Modules, and up to two Ethernet Switch Modules. The addition of a second Ethernet Switch Module and/or <b>Storage</b> <b>Control</b> Module permits high availability and load balancing.|$|E

50|$|A <b>storage</b> <b>control,</b> {{frequently}} {{called a}} <b>Storage</b> <b>Control</b> Unit, attaches to a System/360 (or System/370) channel {{one or more}} logically separate devices. The control unit and the device each comporting to System/360 and/or System/370 Input/Output architecture. Since the control unit and attached devices are logically distinct either or both can be busy when an I/O is initiated and either can present ending status when it becomes free.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In view of {{the current}} popular cloud <b>storage</b> access <b>control,</b> some {{security}} problems were still existed. To solve the problem which the cloud service provider canâ€™t verify the user write permissions by the CP-ABE based cloud <b>storage</b> access <b>control,</b> in this paper a cloud <b>storage</b> access <b>control</b> method is proposed {{which is based on}} the encryption algorithm of the cipher-text (CP-ABE) and the attribute-based signature (ABS). This method not only achieves the cloud storage environment information privacy and integrity, but also supports inheritance authorization and scalability...|$|R

5000|$|On January 4, 1968, IBM {{announced}} the System 360 Model 25 {{which included the}} [...] "Disk Attachment Control" [...] (DAC) attaching up to four 2311 DASD. This integrated attachment simulates both a channel and a <b>storage</b> <b>control</b> unit between the CPU and attached 2311 units. By merging the functions the DAC {{eliminates the need for}} a channel and a separate <b>storage</b> <b>control.</b> There are no differences between a 2311 connected to a 2841 SCU and one connected to the DAC.|$|E
5000|$|Disk {{units are}} {{identified}} as Models A2, A2F, B2, B2F, C2, and C2F with each model containing two HDAs. The models are installed in strings of units with an A2 or A2F unit required and attached to a <b>storage</b> <b>control</b> such as the IBM 3830 Model 2 or the equivalent integrated <b>storage</b> <b>control</b> of a system unit. After the A2 can be up to 3 B2 units or up to 2 B2s and a C2. The C2 unit also connects to a <b>storage</b> <b>control</b> {{and serves as a}} secondary path to itself and the A2 and B2 units. When using a C2 two I/O operations could simultaneously take place on the string, one via an A2 and a second via the C2. The valid 3350 strings are: -A, -AB, -ABB, -ABBB, -AC-, -ABC-, or -ABBC- configurations.|$|E
