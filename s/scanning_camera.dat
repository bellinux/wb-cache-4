30|$|In general, {{high-resolution}} CCD {{cameras are}} used. Use of both line scan and area <b>scan</b> <b>cameras</b> {{has been reported}} in the literature. Line <b>scan</b> <b>cameras</b> have been widely used as it is easier to realise a strong and even illumination to the surface area to be inspected. The disadvantage with the line <b>scan</b> <b>cameras</b> is that they do not generate a complete image at once and requires an external hardware to build up images from multiple line scans [7]. Most of the automatic surface inspection system manufacturers use line <b>scan</b> <b>camera.</b> For area <b>scan</b> <b>cameras,</b> the usage of transport encoder is optional and the inspection resolution in both directions is independent of the object (web) speed. However, while using area <b>scan</b> <b>camera,</b> special attention is needed to ensure even illumination of the total area under scan to the extent possible.

The capacity of the UltraCam was enlarged by replacing the used CCDs with 9 µm pixels over 7. 2 µm to 6 µm for the UltraCamXp, having 196 Mpix. The DMC and the UltraCam are system cameras, reaching {{the large number of}} pixels by a combination of 4, respectively 9 CCDs.

40|$|Good focus {{quality is}} {{essential}} in imaging applications. For a hyperspectral line <b>scanning</b> <b>camera,</b> lack of continuous autofocus will quickly make the image become out of focus, given curved or sloped objects. In spite of this, continuous autofocus solutions for hyperspectral line scanning cameras seem largely absent. In the presented work a continuous autofocus system for a HySpex VNIR- 1600 hyperspectral line <b>scanning</b> <b>camera</b> is detailed. Passive autofocusing techniques were first tested, showing little potential due to failure of differentiating between contrast changes and focus quality. Moving on, an active autofocus solution was developed. Using a laser displacement sensor mounted ahead of the camera's field of view, the topography of the object is measured and focus adjusted accordingly. The system is dependent on several calibrations. Calibration procedures were invented to ease the calibration process, and the obtained calibration accuracies are discussed. Several samples were tested for focus quality using two different speed settings, and the quality and measured performance is discussed. Furthermore, working conditions for the laser sensor is also investigated. The resulting continuous autofocus system worked as intended, adjusting for topography changes within the physical limits of the system. The obtained focus quality for slow topography changes is excellent. For large topography changes over a small distance the system struggles to follow. Furthermore, adjustment for changes of 5 mm over a distance of one refocusing period (4. 1 - 4. 3 mm) is not recommended due to vibrations in the camera. The refocusing period for the system is off from the set value. While not impacting the functionality directly, it indicates an implementation error in the system. Implementing a dynamic refocusing period might improve system performance. Furthermore, "pause and adjust"-scanning is suggested as a possible improvement with potential for objects with sudden topography changes.

Sediment cores collected from the Blue Hole of Lighthouse Reef, Belize provide a continuous, high-resolution proxy record for hurricane strikes spanning the past ca. 1200 years.

These beds are found interbedded with normal background sediments that consist of annually laminated biogenic carbonate muds that, in combination with ¹⁴C AMS dating, allow for the development of an absolute storm chronology. In order to facilitate the recognition and counting of these not always well-developed laminations, a new quantitative method was developed for use with the widely-used Geoscan line <b>scanning</b> <b>camera</b> system. The hurricane signal at the Blue Hole was found to exhibit multi-centennial frequency variability, with periods of increased activity occurring between ∼ 1100 and 600 yBP and ∼ 100 yBP to present, and a period of decreased activity occurring between ∼ 600 and 100 yBP.

40|$|Line {{scanning}} cameras, which capture only {{a single}} line of pixels, have been increasingly used in ground based mobile or robotic platforms. In applications where it is advantageous to directly georeference the camera data to world coordinates, an accurate estimate of the camera’s 6 D pose is required. This paper focuses on the common case where a mobile platform {{is equipped with a}} rigidly mounted line <b>scanning</b> <b>camera,</b> whose pose is unknown, and a navigation system providing vehicle body pose estimates. We propose a novel method that estimates the camera’s pose relative to the navigation system. The approach involves imaging and manually labelling a calibration pattern with distinctly identifiable points, triangulating these points from camera and navigation system data and reprojecting them in order to compute a likelihood, which is maximised to estimate the 6 D camera pose. Additionally, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is used to estimate the uncertainty of the offset. Tested on two different platforms, the method was able to estimate the pose to within 0. 06 m/ 1. 05 ∘ and 0. 18 m/ 2. 39 ∘.

When people make a saccade across the light sources, they can perceive 2 D images thanks to the retinal afterimage drawn by the saccade. Though, so far, saccades of observers are induced by other stimuli such as two sequentially flashing light sources, if the saccades are remotely detected, practical applications can be realized. In this study, we present a new technique for detecting saccades, based on the fast, robust pupil detection method. The method uses two infrared light sources synchronized with the camera's frame rate. The two light sources generate bright and dark pupil images, and we can carve out {{the position of the}} pupil by subtracting them. From the series of the captured image, change of the eye gaze is measured as the displacement of the pupil's position.

40|$|Sea ice concentrations, {{derived from}} passive {{microwave}} satellite sensor measurements, provide today reliable ice information on global scal. The current operational Special Sensor Microwave/ Imager (SSM/ I) operating {{as part of}} the U. S. Defence Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP), was first launched in june 1987 into a polar orbit. Due to the different emissivities of water and different ice types it is possible to obtain ice concentrations and ice fractions using suitable algorithms. During the winter time, when the overlying snow on sea ice is dry, concentrations can be retrieved to an accuracy of +/- 7 %. In the summer, when surface melt is predominant, melt features appear on the ice in form of puddles or melt holes. The extent of melt features depends very much on the host ice type. In general the ice can be calssified as first year ice or old ice. The amount of water accumulated in melt features could be as high as 90 % on first year ice and possibly up to 50 % on old ice can lead to significant algorithm retrieval errors of ice concentrations. In order to obtain accurate melt feature concentrations a line <b>scan</b> <b>camera</b> mounted on a helicopter can provide areal coverage. Preliminary analysis of the camera data indicates that water, ice, puddles and refrozen puddles could be quantitatively separated. On 7 an 8 August 1990, based on two line <b>scan</b> <b>camera</b> flights, the ice concentration was 67 % with 14 % melt puddles and 40 % ice concentrations with 52 % melt puddles, respectively. The rest open water. The SSM/ I ice concentration for the same locations wer 46 % and 35 % respectively. The SSM/I ice concentrations can be compared directly to the line <b>scan</b> <b>camera</b> values. The difference in ice concentrations observed of 21 and 5 % respectively can be explained due to differences in areal coverage by the two sensors. The line <b>scan</b> <b>camera</b> covered only about 6 % of the gridpoint area covered by the SSM/I which consist of an area of 625 Km 2, based on these measurements, the actual SSM/I ice concentration should be 86 % and 65 % respectively.
