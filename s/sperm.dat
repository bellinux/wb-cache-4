5|$|A {{closer look}} into the {{behavior}} of Cornu aspersum, shows {{that it is not}} the mechanical action of the dart that increases paternity in <b>sperm</b> donors but instead the mucus that coats the dart. The mucus carries an allohormone that is transferred into the recipient snail’s hemolymph when the dart is stabbed. This allohormone reconfigures the female component of the reproductive system in the receiving individual: the bursa copulax (<b>sperm</b> digestion organ) is closed off, and the copulatory canal (leading to the <b>sperm</b> storage) is opened. This reconfiguration allows more <b>sperm</b> to access the <b>sperm</b> storage area and fertilize eggs, rather than being digested. Ultimately this increases the shooter’s paternity.|$|E
5|$|At {{least in}} some species, {{juvenile}} ctenophores appear capable of producing small quantities of eggs and <b>sperm</b> while they are well below adult size, and adults produce eggs and <b>sperm</b> {{for as long as}} they have sufficient food. If they run short of food, they first stop producing eggs and <b>sperm,</b> and then shrink in size. When the food supply improves, they grow back to normal size and then resume reproduction. These features make ctenophores capable of increasing their populations very quickly.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes have genital slits on the {{underside}} of their bodies. The male can retract and conceal his penis through his slit. The female's slit houses her vagina and anus. Females have two mammary slits, each housing one nipple, one {{on each side of the}} genital slit. The ability to stow their reproductive organs (especially in males) allows for maximum hydrodynamics. The breeding season produces significant physiological changes in males. At that time, the testes enlarge, enabling them to hold more <b>sperm.</b> Large amounts of <b>sperm</b> allow a male to wash away the previous suitor's <b>sperm,</b> while leaving some of his own for fertilization. Also, <b>sperm</b> concentration markedly increases. Having less <b>sperm</b> for out-of-season social mating means it wastes less. This suggests <b>sperm</b> production is energetically expensive. Males have large testes in relation to their body size.|$|E

5|$|Female {{birds have}} <b>sperm</b> storage {{mechanisms}} that allow <b>sperm</b> from males to remain viable long after copulation, a hundred days in some species. <b>Sperm</b> from multiple males may compete through this mechanism.

Males of species that engage in extra-pair copulations will closely guard their mates to ensure the parentage of the offspring that they raise.|$|E
5|$|Fossil <b>sperm</b> whales {{differ from}} modern <b>sperm</b> whales in tooth count {{and the shape}} of the face and jaws. For example, Scaldicetus had a tapered rostrum. Genera from the Oligocene and early and middle Miocene, with the {{possible}} exception of Aulophyseter, had teeth in their upper jaws. Acrophyseter, from the late Miocene, also had teeth in both the upper and lower jaws as well as a short rostrum and an upward curving mandible (lower jaw). These anatomical differences suggest that fossil species may not have necessarily been deep-sea squid eaters like the modern <b>sperm</b> whale, but that some genera mainly ate fish. Zygophyseter, dated from the middle to late Miocene and found in southern Italy, had teeth in both jaws and appears to have been adapted to feed on large prey, rather like the modern Orca (Killer Whale). Other fossil <b>sperm</b> whales with adaptations similar to this are collectively known as killer <b>sperm</b> whales.|$|E
5|$|In case {{of failure}} with PVS, {{spermatozoa}} are sometimes collected by electroejaculation: an electrical probe is {{inserted into the}} rectum, where it triggers ejaculation. The success rate is 80–100%, but the technique requires anaesthesia and {{does not have the}} potential to be done at home that PVS has. Both PVS and electroejaculation carry a risk of autonomic dysreflexia, so drugs to prevent the condition can be given in advance and blood pressure is monitored throughout the procedures for those who are susceptible. Massage of the prostate gland and seminal vesicles is another method to retrieve stored <b>sperm.</b> If these methods fail to cause ejaculation or do not yield sufficient usable <b>sperm,</b> <b>sperm</b> can be surgically removed by testicular <b>sperm</b> extraction or percutaneous epididymal <b>sperm</b> aspiration. These procedures yield <b>sperm</b> in 86–100% of cases, but nonsurgical treatments are preferred.|$|E
40|$|Protein {{degradation}} {{mediated by}} the proteasome {{is important for the}} protein homeostasis. Various proteasome activators, such as PA 28 and PA 200, regulate the proteasome function. Here we show double knockout (dKO) mice of Psme 3 and Psme 4 (genes for PA 28 γ and PA 200), but not each single knockout mice, are completely infertile in male. The dKO <b>sperms</b> exhibited remarkable defects in motility, although most of them showed normal appearance in morphology. The proteasome activity of the mutant <b>sperms</b> decreased notably, and the <b>sperms</b> were strongly positive with ubiquitin staining. Quantitative analyses of proteins expressed in dKO <b>sperms</b> revealed up-regulation of several proteins involved in oxidative stress response. Furthermore, increased 8 -OHdG staining was observed in dKO <b>sperms</b> head, suggesting defective response to oxidative damage.

40|$|Introduction The morphologic {{features}} of human <b>sperms</b> are key indicators for monitoring fertility problems in men. Therefore, automated analyzing methods via microscopic videos {{have become the}} most favorite policy in infertility treatment during the last decades. Materials and Methods In the proposed method, firstly a hypothesis testing framework was defined to distinguish <b>sperms</b> from background. Then, some regions were selected as candidates by minimization of the information distance between the original and processed images. Finally, the correct <b>sperms</b> were extracted from candidates using a watershed-based algorithm. Results The proposed, Watershed Segmentation Algorithm (WSA), Multi Structure Element Segmentation (MSES) and Dynamic Threshold Segmentation (DTS) algorithms achieve true positive rates of 96 %, 84 %, 81 %, and 70 %, respectively, versus typically 3 % of false positive rate in semen specimens with high density of <b>sperms.</b> The true positive rates of 87 %, 69 %, 66 %, and 52 %, respectively, at the same false positive rate were obtained for the semen specimens with high density of <b>sperms.</b> Conclusion Results show that false positive rates of the proposed algorithm were at least 8 % (in the first scenario) and 32 % (in the second scenario) better than other methods considering the minimum acceptable true positive rate of 90 %. Furthermore, {{it has been shown}} that the proposed algorithm extracted <b>sperms</b> at least 12 % (in the first scenario) and 18 % (in the second scenario) better than other methods in presence of a typically low false positive rate equal to 3 %...|$|R

5|$|<b>Sperm</b> {{whales are}} not the easiest of whales to watch, due to their long dive times and ability to travel long {{distances}} underwater. However, due to the distinctive look and large size of the whale, watching is increasingly popular. <b>Sperm</b> whale watchers often use hydrophones {{to listen to the}} clicks of the whales and locate them before they surface. Popular locations for <b>sperm</b> whale watching include the town of Kaikoura on New Zealand's South Island, Andenes and Tromsø in Arctic Norway; as well as the Azores, where the continental shelf is so narrow that whales can be observed from the shore, and Dominica where a long-term scientific research program, The Dominica <b>Sperm</b> Whale Project, has been in operation since 2005.|$|E
