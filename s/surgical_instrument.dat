5|$|Allingham {{was born}} in 1896 in Clapton, County of London. When he was 14 months old, his father, Henry Thomas Allingham (1870-1899), died at age 29 of tuberculosis. Henry is {{recorded}} in the 1901 census with his widowed mother Amy Jane Allingham (née Foster) (1873-1915), a laundress forewoman, living {{with her parents and}} brother at 23 Verulam Avenue, Walthamstow. His mother remarried in 1905 to Hubert George Higgs and in 1907 the family moved to Clapham, London. Henry and his mother are recorded in the 1911 Census living at 21 Heyford Avenue, Lambeth, while his stepfather was lodging away from home working as a wheelwright. Henry attended a London County Council school before attending the Regent Street Polytechnic. Allingham remembered seeing the City Imperial Volunteers return from the Second Boer War, and also recalled watching W. G. Grace play cricket. On leaving school, Allingham started work as a trainee <b>surgical</b> <b>instrument</b> maker at St. Bartholomew's Hospital. He did not find this job very interesting, and so left to work for a coachbuilder specialising in car bodies.|$|E
5|$|A general {{principle}} concerning dental abscesses is ubi pus, ibi evacua ("{{where there is}} pus, drain it"), which applies to any case {{where there is a}} collection of pus in the tissues (such as a periodontal abscess, pericoronal abscess, or apical abscess). The pus within the abscess is under pressure, and the surrounding tissues are deformed and stretched to accommodate the swelling. This leads to a sensation of throbbing (often in time with the pulse) and constant pain. Pus may be evacuated via the tooth by drilling into the pulp chamber (an endodontic access cavity). Such a treatment is sometimes termed open drainage. Drainage can also be performed via the tooth socket, once the causative tooth is extracted. If neither of those measures succeeds, or they are impossible, incision and drainage may be required, in which a small incision is made in the soft tissues directly over the abscess at the most dependent point. A <b>surgical</b> <b>instrument</b> such as a pair of tweezers is gently inserted into the incision and opened, while the abscess is massaged to encourage the pus to drain out. Usually, the reduction in pain when the pus drains is immediate and marked as the built up pressure is relieved. If the pus drains into the mouth, there is usually a bad or offensive taste.|$|E
40|$|<b>Surgical</b> <b>instruments</b> {{are being}} in use to serve human {{healthcare}} for centuries.

Pakistan exports almost 50 % of its produced quantity of <b>surgical</b> <b>instruments</b> to Europe and 25 % to USA. In our research project we are conducting research on a small company of Pakistan. The name of the company is NATA Surgical International. The company is a small business entity located at Sialkot, a city of Pakistan. It is working with local suppliers, who export the <b>surgical</b> <b>instruments</b> to foreign countries. NATA Surgical International desires to remove this middle man barrier and wants to reach the customers directly. NATA Surgical International is looking for two opportunities; either they should start supplying <b>surgical</b> <b>instruments</b> directly to domestic hospitals or start exporting <b>surgical</b> <b>instruments</b> to foreign countries. A research was carried out by the NATA management who identified that 50 % of its <b>surgical</b> <b>instruments</b> are directly exported to Europe from Pakistan. With the help of these statistics, we on behalf of NATA Surgical International try to investigate on the two different markets. This research explore the opportunities for NATA Surgical International to either expand its sales further within the domestic market, by selling directly to dealers, or in the European market. We investigate the best markets within the European countries, as well as study domestic opportunities and barriers...|$|R

25|$|In 1930, Gillies' cousin, Archibald McIndoe, {{joined the}} {{practice}} and became committed to plastic surgery. When World War II broke out, plastic surgery provision was largely divided between the different services of the armed forces, and Gillies and his team were split up. Gillies himself was sent to Rooksdown House near Basingstoke, which became the principal army plastic surgery unit; Tommy Kilner (who had worked with Gillies during the First World War, and who now has a <b>surgical</b> <b>instrument</b> named after him, the kilner cheek retractor), went to Queen Mary's Hospital, Roehampton, and Mowlem to St Albans. McIndoe, consultant to the RAF, moved to the recently rebuilt Queen Victoria Hospital in East Grinstead, Sussex, and founded a Centre for Plastic and Jaw Surgery. There, he treated very deep burn, and serious facial disfigurement, such as loss of eyelids, typical of those caused to aircrew by burning fuel.|$|E
25|$|Prions, the {{infectious}} agent of CJD, {{may not be}} inactivated by means of routine <b>surgical</b> <b>instrument</b> sterilization procedures. The World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that instrumentation used in such cases be immediately destroyed after use; short of destruction, {{it is recommended that}} heat and chemical decontamination be used in combination to process instruments that come in contact with high-infectivity tissues. No cases of iatrogenic transmission of CJD have been reported subsequent to the adoption of current sterilization procedures, or since 1976. Copper-hydrogen peroxide has been suggested {{as an alternative to the}} current recommendation of sodium hydroxide or sodium hypochlorite. Thermal depolymerization also destroys prions in infected organic and inorganic matter, since the process chemically attacks protein at the molecular level, although more effective and practical methods involve destruction by combinations of detergents and enzymes similar to biological washing powders.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately, this optimistic {{prediction}} was not fulfilled; {{by the end}} of October, {{the development}} of sepsis made amputation appear inevitable. The French surgeon Auguste Nélaton, known for innovations in surgical tools, was asked to examine Garibaldi. An electrical probe designed by Favre had been used previously, without success, in an attempt to determine if the bullet remained. Nélaton used a normal surgical probe to examine the wound, concluding that Partridge had been mistaken and the bullet was indeed lodged in the joint; he recommended extraction using ball forceps. He later designed a special probe with a tip of unglazed porcelain, which could be introduced into the wound and retain an impression of any bullet present. Using this improved probe, the Italian surgeon Zanetti became convinced of the bullet's presence, and successfully extracted it on 23 November, saving Garibaldi's limb. The triumph of an innovative <b>surgical</b> <b>instrument</b> in this case was just one example of a trend over {{the latter half of the}} nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth towards the acceptance of surgery as a craft, with instruments as essential tools of that craft.|$|E

2500|$|In 1988, {{there was}} a {{confirmed}} death from CJD of a person from Manchester, New Hampshire. Massachusetts General Hospital believed the patient acquired the disease from a <b>surgical</b> <b>instrument</b> at a podiatrist's office. In September 2013, another patient in Manchester was posthumously determined to have died of the disease. The patient had undergone brain surgery at Catholic Medical Center three months before his death, and a surgical probe used in the procedure was subsequently reused in other operations. Public health officials identified thirteen patients at three hospitals {{who may have been}} exposed to the disease through the contaminated probe, but said the risk of anyone's contracting CJD is [...] "extremely low."

2500|$|Tonsillectomies {{have been}} practiced for 2,000 years, with varying {{popularity}} over the centuries. The procedure is claimed in some books as [...] "Hindu medicine" [...] about 1000 BC (non-evidence based literature). Others {{refer to it}} as cleaning of tonsil using the nail of the index finger. Roughly a millennium later the Roman aristocrat Aulus Cornelius Celsus (25 BC – 50 AD) described a procedure whereby using the finger (or a blunt hook if necessary), the tonsil was separated from the neighboring tissue before being cut out. Galen (121–200 AD) was the first to advocate the use of the <b>surgical</b> <b>instrument</b> known as the snare, a practice that was to become common until Aetius (490 AD) recommended partial removal of the tonsil, writing [...] "Those who extirpate the entire tonsil remove, at the same time, structures that are perfectly healthy, and, in this way, give rise to serious Hæmorrhage". In the 7th century Paulus Aegineta (625–690) described a detailed procedure for tonsillectomy, including dealing with the inevitable post-operative bleeding. 1,200 years pass before the procedure is described again with such precision and detail.|$|E
2500|$|Inspired by {{the work}} of Italian {{psychiatrist}} Amarro Fiamberti, Freeman at some point conceived of approaching the frontal lobes through the eye sockets instead of through drilled holes in the skull. In 1945 he took an icepick from his own kitchen and began testing the idea on grapefruit and cadavers. This new [...] "transorbital" [...] lobotomy involved lifting the upper eyelid and placing the point of a thin <b>surgical</b> <b>instrument</b> (often called an orbitoclast or leucotome, although quite different from the wire loop leucotome described above) under the eyelid and against the top of the eyesocket. A mallet was used to drive the orbitoclast through the thin layer of bone and into the brain along the plane of the bridge of the nose, around fifteen degrees toward the interhemispherical fissure. The orbitoclast was malleted five centimeters (2in) into the frontal lobe, and then pivoted forty degrees at the orbit perforation so the tip cut toward {{the opposite side of the}} head (toward the nose). The instrument was returned to the neutral position and sent a further two centimeters (in) into the brain, before being pivoted around twenty-eight degrees each side, to cut outwards and again inwards. (In a more radical variation at the end of the last cut described, the butt of the orbitoclast was forced upwards so the tool cut vertically down the side of the cortex of the interhemispherical fissure; the [...] "Deep frontal cut".) All cuts were designed to transect the white fibrous matter connecting the cortical tissue of the prefrontal cortex to the thalamus. The leucotome was then withdrawn and the procedure repeated on the other side.|$|E

2500|$|On 12 November 1935 at the Hospital Santa Marta in Lisbon, Moniz {{initiated}} {{the first of}} a series of operations on the brains of the mentally ill. The initial patients selected for the operation were provided by the medical director of Lisbon's Miguel Bombarda Mental Hospital, José de Matos Sobral Cid. As Moniz lacked training in neurosurgery and his hands were crippled from gout, the procedure was performed under general anaesthetic by Pedro Almeida Lima, who had previously assisted Moniz with his research on cerebral angiography. The intention was to remove some of the long fibres that connected the frontal lobes to other major brain centres. To this end, it was decided that Lima would trephine into the side of the skull and then inject ethanol into the [...] "subcortical white matter of the prefrontal area" [...] so as to destroy the connecting fibres, or association tracts, and create what Moniz termed a [...] "frontal barrier". After the first operation was complete, Moniz considered it a success and, observing that the patient's depression had been relieved, he declared her [...] "cured" [...] although she was never, in fact, discharged from the mental hospital. Moniz and Lima persisted with this method of injecting alcohol into the frontal lobes for the next seven patients but, after having to inject some patients on numerous occasions to elicit what they considered a favourable result, they modified the means by which they would section the frontal lobes. For the ninth patient they introduced a <b>surgical</b> <b>instrument</b> called a leucotome; this was a cannula that was [...] in length and [...] in diameter. It had a retractable wire loop at one end that, when rotated, produced a [...] diameter circular lesion in the white matter of the frontal lobe. Typically, six lesions were cut into each lobe, but, if they were dissatisfied by the results, Lima might perform several procedures, each producing multiple lesions in the left and right frontal lobes.|$|E
