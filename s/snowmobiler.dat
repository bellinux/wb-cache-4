40|$|ABSTRACT: Over {{the last}} five winters, {{mountain}} <b>snowmobilers</b> accounted for 53 % (41 of 77) of all rec-reational avalanche fatalities in Canada, which is a significant increase from the 28 % (18 of 64) during the previous five winters. This trend clearly highlights {{the need for the}} Canadian avalanche community to im-prove avalanche awareness among this user group. Creating an in-depth understanding of the perspec-tives, needs and challenges of mountain <b>snowmobilers</b> is an important first step in the development of more appropriate risk communication and prevention strategies. This paper presents preliminary results from an extensive online survey on mountain snowmobiling and avalanche awareness that was conduct-ed in British Columbia during the 2011 / 2012 winter season. The survey included a series of discrete choice experiments, a stated preference technique, to examine how <b>snowmobilers</b> adjust their riding preferences as new avalanche hazard information becomes available during different stages of typical backcountry trips. The analysis revealed that participating <b>snowmobilers</b> interpret danger ratings on a lin-ear scale and that the presence of a persistent avalanche problem does not affect their riding choices. Furthermore, under increasing avalanche danger, <b>snowmobilers</b> first gravitate towards areas with higher snowmobile traffic before they avoid complex and challenging avalanche terrain. The analysis also showed that instability observations (i. e [...] whumpfs) affect riding choices more than other relevant observa-tions. The results of this study can help to develop evidence-based avalanche safety initiatives that effec-tively target existing weaknesses in the avalanche safety behavior of mountain <b>snowmobilers...</b>|$|R

40|$|Context: Snowmobiling is {{a rapidly}} growing wintertime sport across the United States. Its {{popularity}} has grown {{by leaps and bounds}} in the last twenty years. With the increase of interest in this winter sport, has come an increase in injuries and fatalities. Some of the leading causes of accidents include excessive speed, alcohol, inexperience, and poor judgment. Most often injuries sustained while snowmobiling involve the musculoskeletal system but can involve any organ system. Objective: The {{purpose of this study was}} to use a survey to assess the demographics, safety precautions, and common injuries of <b>snowmobilers</b> over the age of eighteen in the Northern Black Hills of South Dakota. This study assessed what types of first-aid items were carried and if it was adequate for common snowmobile-related injuries. It also looked into how prepared <b>snowmobilers</b> felt for common injuries they may encounter while snowmobiling. Assessment was done of modifiable known risk factors for snowmobile-related injury and mortality, such as, helmet use and alcohol consumption. Design: <b>Snowmobilers</b> were surveyed during the month of January 2006. · Only <b>snowmobilers</b> over the age of eighteen were surveyed. Most surveys were completed in person at Trailshead Lodge (Lead, SD) a popular starting and rest area near a trail system entrance. Surveys and survey receptacles were also available at sites that were likely to be visited by <b>snowmobilers,</b> such as, rental businesses and picked up at the end of the month. These surveys were completed by <b>snowmobilers</b> riding on the 350 mile trail system within the 1. 2 million acres of the Black Hills National Forest. Results: Of the total 305 <b>snowmobilers</b> surveyed, 89 % carried some type of first-aid or winter survival item but only 16. 7 % carried and adequate or better first-aid kit recommended for <b>snowmobilers.</b> There were 46. 2 % that reported an injury while snowmobiling, with headache, blister, and frostbite the most common conditions. A total of 71 % had some type of medical training. Conclusion: This study evaluated the safety preparedness and common injuries sustained by <b>snowmobilers</b> in the Northern Black Hills of South Dakota. Of the total respondents, 11 % were not carrying any first aid or winter survival items. There were 83. 3 % that did not carry an adequate first-aid kit recommended for <b>snowmobilers.</b> Health care providers, snowmobile clubs, law enforcement officials, departments of natural resources, parks, and recreation, and government agencies all play a crucial role in educating snowmobile enthusiasts about risks and important safety precautions. The risks associated with injury and mortality can be modified by following safe snowmobiling practices. Exercising good judgment and avoiding unnecessary risk should be encouraged in the health care setting and out on the trails...|$|R

40|$|In spring 2014 a web survey aimed towards Swedish <b>snowmobilers</b> were conducted. The {{aim was to}} {{identify}} riding habits, attitudes to risk, knowledge of avalanches {{and the use of}} safety equip- ment. In total 2917 <b>snowmobilers</b> responded. The results provide new and important knowledge about behavior and attitudes to risk and general knowledge about avalanches and avalanche awareness. 34 % of the <b>snowmobilers</b> state that they are sometimes or often in contact with avalanche terrain. Of those, 19 % has been involved in at least on avalanche related incident. In the same group, only 14 % are regularly equipped with avalanche transmitter and probe. Among those who are using avalanche safety equipment, 33 % states that they rarely or never practice to use it. In Sweden the use of snowmobile has greatly increased the past 20 years and so has the popularity re- garding freeriding with snowmobiles in steep terrain. The total number of snowmobiles is now more than 280, 000. Between 2005 and 2014, 102 <b>snowmobilers</b> in Sweden where killed in snowmobile related acci- dents in total but very few accidents during this period has officially been avalanche related which is surprisingly. Do Swedish <b>snowmobilers</b> uses the terrain differently than in North America and in Norway where there is much more accidents recorded or is there a difference in their attitudes to risk, or is the relatively few ava- lanche accidents just a coincidence? Is the relatively few accidents connected with the development of stronger and faster snowmobiles? Will Sweden also see a growing number of accidents with more vic- tims? Are there other factors? The final results will be used in the Swedish Mountain Safety Councils efforts to develop future avalanche education programs for <b>snowmobilers</b> and as a way to support research and development in the area.

50|$|A High mark {{begins when}} a <b>snowmobiler</b> leaves an {{established}} trail and fully accelerates; blazing his/her own trail upward toward {{the summit of}} a snow-covered mountain face, ideally lying at a 30-45% grade. As the terrain gets steeper, the machine's acceleration slows down. At {{the apex of the}} elevation gained, the rider must sharply turn 180 degrees and descend the feature. The height of the arching track left in the snow by a pioneering rider usually sparks competition within members of a rider's party, urging the rest to surpass the height of the original arch, thus initiating a competition. High marks vary in their degrees of difficulty depending on the pitch of a given ascent and conditions of the snow.|$|E
