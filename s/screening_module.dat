40|$|Abstract—The spike {{classification}} is {{a critical}} step in im-plantable neural decoding. The energy efficiency issue in the sensor node is a big challenge in the entire system. Compressive sensing (CS) provides a potential way to tackle this problem. However, the overhead of signal reconstruction constrains the compression in sensor node and analysis in remote server. In this paper, we design a new selective CS architecture for wireless implantable neural decoding. We implement all the signal analysis on the compressed domain. To achieve better energy efficiency, we propose a two-stage classification procedure, including a coarse-grained <b>screening</b> <b>module</b> with softmax regression and a fine-grained analysis module based on deep learning. The <b>screening</b> <b>module</b> completes the low-effort classification task in the front-end and transmits the compressed data of high-effort task to remote server for fine-grained analysis. Experimental results indicate that our selective CS architecture can gain more than 50 % energy savings, yet keeping the high accuracy as state-of-the-art CS architectures. I...|$|E

Optical transducer principles lend themselves {{very well to}} the designing of parallel test systems for detecting molecular interaction. At the University of Tuebingen, reflectometric interference spectroscopy (RIfS) is applied successfully to the detection of unlabeled heterogeneous assays in single samples. Optical path length changes caused by binding of an analyte to immobilized reference molecules on the transducer surface are detected by means of white light interference. In the project effort, the laboratory model of an RIfS <b>screening</b> <b>module</b> was developed and tested. The laboratory model permits the simultaneous measurement of the binding curves of 80 samples at time intervals of 20 seconds {{over a period of}} 10 minutes. The smalest thickness change of the sensitive transducer layer the instrument can detect is 10 pm. The arrangement of samples in a matrix of 4. 5 mm grid size allow the measurement setup to be scaled up to 384 samples in microtitration plates. The laboratory model was used for carrying out many tests with functionally decisive subassemblies.

40|$|International audiencePrevalence of {{epilepsy}} {{in developing}} countries {{is considered to be}} 2 to 5 times superior to the industrialized countries. In tropical areas, the diagnosis of epilepsy is still reliant on the clinic and requires a precise semiological description. A good epidemiological and clinical research requires standardized and validated screening tools. The objective of this work was to evaluate the validity of the <b>screening</b> <b>module</b> of the investigation questionnaire on epilepsy in tropical areas, in Nouakchott, Mauritania. All the patients included in the study were examined at first by a neurologist, then directed towards an investigator who asked the 5 screening items of the investigation questionnaire. Any person answering "yes" at least one question was regarded as "suspected of epilepsy" by the investigator. Secondly the neurologist re-examined the subjects and confirmed the diagnosis. The sensitivity and the specificity of the module of screening were calculated. On the whole, 236 patients were included in the study 131 had answered "yes" {{at least one of the}} questions of the module of screening and was regarded as "suspected" of epilepsy (55. 5 %) by the questionnaire. The diagnosis of epilepsy was made for 82 subjects by the neurologist. The sensitivity of the module of screening of the epilepsy was 95. 1 % (CI 95 %: 87. 3 - 98. 4) and specificity was 65. 6 % (CI 95 %: 57. 5 - 72. 9).

40|$|One {{major problem}} in cancer therapy is the {{immortality}} of tumor cells showing an active telomerase, {{which is responsible for}} the elongation of the telomeres after each cellular division and the knocking down of apoptotic suppressors. A further phenomenon occurring during cancer therapies is the problem of multicellular resistance. To develop therapeutic anticancer approaches inducing cellular apoptosis, gene-modified biological in vitro systems were established and evaluated for drug, screening in a capillary system for a real-time, impedimertic monitoring. Multicellular spheroids of the human breast cancer cell line T- 47 D clone II were transfected with 1) antisense caspase- 3 cDNA expression vectors for knocking down the main cell death molecule and 2) sense Bel-xi cDNA expression vectors for overexpressing the apoptotic suppressor, resulting in more aggressive tumor models. These gene-modified tumor spheroids less sensitive for apoptosis were developed for screening drugs such as methotrexate in tumor spheroid-based biosensor systems via impedance spectroscopy.

However, some US studies find lower screening uptake in this group. This study explored whether rates of breast and colorectal screening in England are lower for obese than healthy weight individuals. Setting: Data were from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA). Methods: We analysed data from adults who were eligible to have been invited to the UK national screening programmes for breast or colorectal cancer (CRC) in the last five years, and had been given the <b>screening</b> <b>module</b> in Wave 5 of ELSA (N 1804 for CRC screening, N 2401 for breast cancer screening). Weight and height were measured by a nurse at Wave 4 (two years earlier). Logistic regression was used to calculate the odds of breast and CRC screening (ever) for participants in higher weight categories (Body Mass Index [BMI] 5 25) compared with healthy weight individuals (BMI < 25), controlling for socio-demographic variables. Results: Of ELSA participants, 63 % reported CRC screening, and 92 % of the women reported breast cancer screening. Obesity was associated with lower CRC screening, but effects were strongest for class III obesity (BMI 540) (45 % screened; OR 0. 48, 95 % CI 0. 32 – 0. 93, P. 029).

40|$|IntroductionColorectal cancer (CRC) {{screening}} {{rates are}} low in New Mexico. We used statewide surveys of primary care physicians and the general population to characterize CRC screening practices and compare perceptions about screening barriers. MethodsIn 2006, we surveyed 714 primary care physicians in New Mexico about their CRC screening practices, beliefs, and perceptions of patient, provider, and system barriers. A 2004 state-specific CRC <b>screening</b> <b>module</b> for the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey asked 3, 355 participants aged 50 years or older why they had not ever or had not recently completed a fecal occult blood test (FOBT) or lower endoscopy. ResultsThe 216 physicians (30 % response rate) reported offering screening to a median 80 % of their average-risk patients {{in the past year}} and estimated that a median 50 % were current with screening. They attributed low screening proportions mainly to patient factors (embarrassment, fear of pain, lack of insurance). However, just 51 % of physician respondents used health maintenance flow sheets, and only 13 % used electronic medical records to identify patients due for CRC screening. The BRFSS respondents most often reported that lack of physician discussion was responsible for not being current with screening (45 % FOBT, 34 % endoscopy); being asymptomatic was also often cited as an explanation for lack of screening (22 % FOBT, 36 % endoscopy). ConclusionPhysicians and adults in the general population had markedly different perspectives on barriers to CRC screening. Increasing screening may require system supports to help physicians readily identify patients due for CRC testing and interventions to educate patients about the rationale for screening...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Identifying {{gene and}} {{environment}} interaction (G × E) can provide insights into biological networks of complex diseases, identify novel genes that act synergistically with environmental factors, and inform risk prediction. However, {{despite the fact}} that hundreds of novel disease-associated loci have been identified from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), few G × Es have been discovered. One reason is that most studies are underpowered for detecting these interactions. Several new methods have been proposed to improve power for G × E analysis, but performance varies with scenario. In this article, we present a module-based approach to integrating various methods that exploits each method’s most appealing aspects. There are three modules in our approach: (1) a <b>screening</b> <b>module</b> for prioritizing Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs); (2) a multiple comparison module for testing G × E; and (3) a G × E testing module. We combine all three of these modules and develop two novel “cocktail ” methods. We demonstrate that the proposed cocktail methods maintain the type I error, and that the power tracks well with the best existing methods, despite that the best methods may be different under various scenarios and interaction models. For GWAS, where the true interaction models are unknown, methods like our “cocktail ” methods that are powerful under a wide range of situations are particularly appealing. Broadly speaking, the modular approach is conceptually straightforward and computationally simple. It builds on common test statistics and is easily implemented without additional computational efforts. It also allows for an easy incorporation of new methods as they are developed. Our work provides a comprehensive and powerful tool for devising effective strategies for genome-wid...|$|E

For this purpose, a 1 / 4 scale model of straight duct of the engine intake with screen/mesh combinations was fabricated and tested at the inlet of the centrifugal compressor in CLOCTER facility of N. A. L. Five meshes of different size and porosity ranging form 39 % to 56 % either in single or in combination mode were {{used to create a}} number of different distortion patterns at flow Mach numbers of 0. 3 to 0. 34. A total pressure rake of eight arms having 40 pressure tappings distributed in five equal area rings across the duct, was used to obtain the pressure distribution downstream of the mesh for estimating the pressure loss and total pressure contours.

For the exploration of new structures and new imaging modalities, validated automated methods do not yet exist, and so researchers must rely on manually drawn landmarks. Voxel-by-voxel labeling can be extremely resource intensive, so large-scale studies are problematic. Recently, statistical approaches and software have been proposed to enable Internet-based collaborative labeling of medical images. While numerous labeling software tools have been created, {{the use of these}} packages as high-throughput labeling systems has yet to become entirely viable given training requirements. Herein, we explore two modifications to a typical mouse-based labeling system: (1) a platform independent overlay for recognition of mouse gestures and (2) an inexpensive touch-screen tracking device for non-mouse input. Through this study we characterize rater reliability in point, line, curve, and region placement. For the mouse input, we find a placement accuracy of 2. 48 ± 5. 29 pixels (point), 0. 630 ± 1. 81 pixels (curve), 1. 234 ± 6. 99 pixels (line), and 0. 058 ± 0. 027 (1 – Jaccard Index for region). The gesture software increased labeling speed by 27 % overall and accuracy by approximately 30 - 50 % on point and line tracing tasks, but the touch <b>screen</b> <b>module</b> lead to slower and more error prone labeling on all tasks, likely due to relatively poor sensitivity. In summary, the mouse gesture integration layer runs as a seamless operating system overlay and could potentially benefit any labeling software; yet, the inexpensive touch screen system requires improved usability optimization and calibration before it can provide an efficient labeling system...|$|R
