5|$|On April 4, Lin passed {{directly}} over Tonga with winds up to 110km/h (70mph) and heavy rains. Initial reports of damage stated that only vegetation had been impacted. However, later reports stated that power lines had been knocked down by high winds {{and the heavy}} rains triggered minor flooding in Nuku'alofa. Some houses lost their rain gutters from the storm. Due to strong winds, officials were forced to <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> <b>power</b> stations in Tongatapu to protect the system. Most of the power lines in Tonga were either downed or damaged by the storm and numerous trees fell across the island. Several roads were also blocked by downed trees and billboards were broken. No one was injured by the storm but {{there were reports of}} significant crop losses.|$|E
25|$|Effects from Frederic {{were first}} felt on the outward facing Leeward Islands. In Antigua, {{the threat of}} {{widespread}} power outages forced the insular government to <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> <b>power.</b> A peak gust of 62mph (100km/h) was documented on the island {{as a result of}} the storm. These strong winds also unroofed some buildings. Strong winds and rain were felt in Guadeloupe, Barbuda, and a number of other islands, but no damaging effects from the passing tropical cyclone occurred in those locations. Power outages knocked out electricity to half of Tortola in the British Virgin Islands and downed telephone lines. Rainfall and downed trees blocked several roads. Offshore, the yacht Princess blew out into sea, prompting a coast guard rescue of the ship and its crew.|$|E

50|$|Emboldened by this, a {{coalition}} of anti-Agreement unionist politicians and paramilitaries organised the Ulster Workers' Council strike which began on 15 May. The strikers brought Northern Ireland to a standstill by <b>shutting</b> <b>down</b> <b>power</b> stations, and after Prime Minister Harold Wilson refused to send in troops to take over from the strikers, the power-sharing executive collapsed on 28 May 1974.|$|R
50|$|The New York Aquarium was {{significantly}} damaged by Hurricane Sandy in October 2012 which severely flooded the facility and <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> <b>power.</b> A {{small group of}} WCS staff who remained onsite during the hurricane were able to save 90 percent of the animals in the collection.|$|E
50|$|On June 28, 2007, a {{short circuit}} caused {{a fire in}} the {{transformer}} of the power plant and required the plant to be <b>shut</b> <b>down.</b> <b>Power</b> outages were experienced in the neighboring areas. The sequence of events caused the dismissal and resignation of several Vattenfall Europe AG employees.|$|E
50|$|The Pupu Power Scheme survived as an {{emergency}} backup, and apart from lightning strike damage in 1956 continued to operate until 1980 when the alternator stator burned out in a 'flashover' short circuit. After 51 years of operating reliably, the <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> <b>power</b> scheme was put up for tender in 1980.|$|E

50|$|Gaitskell {{played an}} {{important}} role steering the Coal Nationalisation Bill through the House of Commons, bearing the brunt of the committee stage and winding up the final debate. In the fuel crisis of February 1947 Shinwell, who had ignored Gaitskell’s warnings, had to ask the Cabinet for permission to <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> <b>power</b> stations; Gaitskell was put on and ran the key committee which decided where coal should be sent. In 1947 he once again {{played an important}} role steering electricity nationalisation through the House of Commons, winding up the debate on the second reading.|$|E
5000|$|The Northeast Blackout of 1965 {{marked a}} turning point for the region's {{electric}} power industry. It <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> <b>power</b> for 30 million customers. On January 1966, the Northeast Power Coordinating Council (NPCC) formed to improve system reliability. Concerned about the system's reliability, the Northeast's power companies formed three [...] "power pools" [...] to ensure a dependable supply of electricity. The New England Power Pool (NEPOOL), formed in 1971 by the region's private and municipal utilities, was intended to foster cooperation and coordination among utilities in the six-state region.|$|E
50|$|To <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> or <b>power</b> off a {{computer}} {{is to remove}} power from {{a computer}}'s main components in a controlled way.

50|$|No. 117 {{came to an}} {{emergency}} stop at 6:06 p.m., just after entering the Transbay Tube, with the operator reporting thick smoke which kept him from determining the exact location. Central operations <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> <b>power</b> to the third rail, but restored it 40 seconds later {{in an effort to}} uncouple the lead portion of the train from the burning cars. This was unsuccessful, and vent fans were turned on at 6:08 p.m. to attempt to clear the smoke, and the third rail was again powered down at 6:15 p.m. A BART supervisor who had been riding on the train helped gather passengers in the lead car, including one blind passenger.|$|E
50|$|His powers {{allow him}} to absorb energy {{in order to make}} himself stronger. For example, if he were to use up all his power {{fighting}} Geo-Force and was just producing sparks {{he would be able to}} use electricity from other sources, Black Lightning can make himself stronger, faster, heal quicker and produce more lightning. Any source of electricity will do, but he has a fondness for absorbing lightning from thunderstorms. He can even drain power plants, which give him a huge boost, even if it does <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> <b>power</b> for the rest of the city sometimes. He can also use this power in an offensive way by draining energy from machines that might be attacking him.|$|E

50|$|Saltley Gate Coke Depot was {{the site}} of the Battle of Saltley Gate, one of the largest mass pickets during the 1970s. On Thursday 10 February 1972 30,000 Birmingham {{engineers}} walked out on strike. They struck to deliver solidarity to striking miners. Up to 15,000 then marched to join 2,000 miners who were picketing Saltley Coke Depot. The blockade forced the police, who had kept the depot open all week, to close the gates. The victory at Saltley was the turning point in the miners' strike. Militant picketing involving tens of thousands of miners had <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> <b>power</b> stations, docks and coke and coal depots. Power cuts forced the Tory government to call a state of emergency. After seven weeks the government was defeated.|$|E

50|$|On 10 February 2016 the Krabi Airport {{terminal}} was {{plunged into}} darkness for over six hours, from 09:00-15:30 {{due to an}} electrical power outage. The Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA) had notified Krabi Airport two days in advance that it would <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> <b>power</b> {{in the area for}} maintenance. Airport authorities activated back-up generators, but they did not work. Krabi's airport director stated after the event that management will rent generators in the future to prevent blackouts from happening. With no power for their computers, immigration officials were unable to access immigration databases and were forced to write down details of 2,000 passengers for later vetting. The deputy national police chief in charge of security, Pol Col Srivara Ransibrahmanakul, assured the public that a follow-up check showed that no blacklisted people were allowed into the country during the incident.|$|E

At San Diego’s Lindbergh Field, maintenance workers <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> <b>power</b> and performed 12 hours of repairs in the terminal, and across San Diego at the Mission Valley Inn, Pacific Southwest and American Airlines held a crew luncheon and pool party. At Chicago O’Hare, Eastern Air Lines, American Airlines, and Continental swung open the doors to their Boeing 707s and 720Bs. Trans World Airlines presented its Convair 880, and United Airlines, its new Sud-Aviation Caravelle twin-jet from France. At Chicago’s Midway, American, United, and TWA displayed Douglas DC-6s and DC-7s. The two Chicago airports also worked on communications during the down time and reduced the price of phone calls between each other from 15 to 10 cents for the first five minutes.|$|E
50|$|A lot of {{research}} has been done on the dynamic power reduction with the use of DVFS techniques. However, as technology continues to shrink, leakage power will become a dominant factor. Power gating is a commonly used circuit technique to remove leakage by turning off the supply voltage of unused circuits. Power gating incurs energy overhead; therefore, unused circuits need to remain idle long enough to compensate this overheads.A novel micro-architectural technique for run-time power-gating caches of GPUs saves leakage energy. Based on experiments on 16 different GPU workloads, the average energy savings achieved by the proposed technique is 54%.Shaders are the most power hungry component of a GPU, a predictive shader <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> <b>power</b> gating technique achieves up to 46% leakage reduction on shader processors.The Predictive Shader Shutdown technique exploits workload variation across frames to eliminate leakage in shader clusters. Another technique called Deferred Geometry Pipeline seeks to minimize leakage in fixed-function geometry units by utilizing an imbalance between geometry and fragment computation across batches which removes up to 57% of the leakage in the fixed-function geometry units. A simple time-out power gating method can be applied to non-shader execution units which eliminates 83.3% of the leakage in non-shader execution units on average.All the three techniques stated above incur negligible performance degradation, less than 1%.|$|E
50|$|The {{residents}} of Manila {{had nothing to}} do but wading through waist-deep floodwaters, dodging branches and flying debris as the typhoon sent surging waves as tall as palm trees over seawalls completely submerging neighborhoods. By the evening of September 27, at-least 7 people were reported to be killed and most of them in metropolitan Manila, a place already battered by heavy monsoonal rains. Similar to the Tulane University during Hurricane Katrina, the Manila Hospital moved patients from its ground floor which was flooded with neck-deep waters. Hospital generators were flooded and the building had no power since the typhoon arrived. Soldiers and police in trucks moved thousands of residents, most importantly the women and the children away from the Baseco shanty after many houses were washed away in the storm surge and floodwaters brought by Nesat. The typhoon made landfall before dawn triggering instant response. Authorities ordered more than a hundred thousand people across the country to flee from Typhoon Nesat's rains and wind gusts. Several schools and offices were shut and thousands were stranded after flight and ferry services were completely disrupted by the fierce storm. Nearly thirty-seven percent of Manila Electric Company’s service area was left without power after high winds and heavy rains toppled power lines. Also, in Malabon, Navotas and Valenzuela the Manila Electric power company <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> <b>power</b> to prevent any accidents.|$|E
50|$|Under Cisco's pre-standard scheme, the PSE (switch) {{will send}} a Fast Link Pulse (FLP) on the {{transmit}} pair. The PD (device) connects the transmit line to the receive line via a low pass filter. And thus the PSE gets the FLP in return. And a common mode current between pair 1 and 2 will be provided resulting in 48 V DC and 6.3 W default of allocated power. The PD has then to provide Ethernet link within 5 seconds to the auto-negotiation mode switch port. A later CDP message with a type-length-value tells the PSE its final power requirement.
