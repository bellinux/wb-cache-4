5|$|The Anti-Relief partisans {{nominated}} former Senator John J. Crittenden {{for one of}} the {{two seats}} apportioned to Franklin County in the state House. The Relief Party countered with Sharp and Lewis Sanders, a prominent area lawyer. During the sharply contested campaign, both John U. Waring and Patrick Henry Darby, a land speculator, said that Sharp's life was at risk if he won. Opponents revived the charges of Sharp's illegitimate child. It was also alleged that Sharp had claimed that the child was mulatto and <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> certificate from Cooke's midwife to that effect; whether Sharp made this claim may never be known for certain. Despite the controversy, Sharp netted the most votes in the election, winning by 69 {{out of a total of}} 1600 votes cast in the county.|$|E

Miller filed a preliminary injunction {{as part of the}} suit, asking that the federal judge immediately order the State to stop counting the ballots, due to irreparable harm that would happen if the counting continued, but the request was denied.|$|E

25|$|England and Australia {{drew the}} match. England were happy {{that they had}} saved the Test, but their batting was still weak with only Graveney, May and Cowdrey capable of playing Benaud's leg-spin with any confidence. Trueman had bowled well without any luck and Laker and Lock had shown their {{spinning}} skills, but the English fielding needed to be improved. Benaud was criticised for his defensive tactics, but <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> job to do and 2–0 up was good {{for him and his}} team.|$|E

The following year, in San Francisco, Subramuniya founded what is now Himalayan Academy and opened America's first Hindu temple at 3575 Sacramento Street, near Presidio Park. In Switzerland, 1968, he wrote of Shum, a mystical language of meditation that names and maps inner areas of consciousness.|$|E
25|$|Very outspoken {{about his}} ideas, he begged Nicholas II {{to cancel the}} {{coronation}} ball at the French embassy in Moscow following the Khodynka Tragedy, warning him that holding it would create a perception of monarchical indifference such as had made Marie Antoinette unpopular. When it was held nevertheless, he arrived with his brothers, then departed soon after in protest. His manner could turn caustic. The Imperial family always <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> mean and critical tongue. He loathed Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna and her family, the Vladimirovichi. A vehement critic of most of his male cousins, Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich in particular, Nicholas Mikhailovich was a divisive figure among the Romanovs.|$|E
25|$|On October 8, 2014, Vonderrit Myers Jr. {{was shot}} and killed by an off-duty police officer in St. Louis. Police <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> gun and shot at them. Doug Hollis of St. Louis, a {{relative}} of both Myers and Michael Brown, did not witness the shooting but told USA Today that Myers was unarmed, with only a sandwich in his hands, and suggested that the gun found at the scene might have been planted by police. Following the shooting, there were multiple nights of protests. Forensic evidence later confirmed that Myers had gunshot residue on his right hand, shirt, and pants, indicating that he had fired a gun. Three bullets fired at police matched Myers's gun. The family's attorney noticed that police versions differ about the weapon Myers allegedly used: first, police mentioned a 9mm Ruger, and later a 9mm Smith & Wesson. Although later determined that Myers did have a gun and it matched the same gun he was seen in various photos posted to social media. An independent autopsy by Dr. Cyril H. Wecht found that six of the eight wounds were {{at the back of the}} body. Police investigators served Wecht with a subpoena for his results. The funeral was held on October 26.|$|E

500|$|Following the 2016 Presidential Election, the creators' {{vision for}} the comic shifted. Rucka, who had used the letter columns in the series to discuss his {{concerns}} about then-candidate Donald Trump, told Oregon Public Broadcasting that after the election results Lazarus had changed from a dystopian science fiction story to a documentary. During a discussion panel at the 2017 Chicago Comic & Entertainment Expo, Rucka described Lazarus as being [...] "about the blood red rage {{that leads to a}} Trump administration" [...] before joking that he had [...] "tried to warn you three years ago!" [...] Although the overall plan for Lazarus did not change, Rucka <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> growing interest in writing about a brighter future instead.|$|E
500|$|Moore {{retired to}} Hilton Head, South Carolina, {{where he spent}} his time sailing, and also at his summer home in Northeast Harbor, Maine. Moore also became a regular humor {{columnist}} for the local newspaper The Island Packet with a column titled [...] "Mumble, Mumble", later releasing a book of his columns under the same name in the early 1980s. He made two rare television appearances during his retirement, in a 1984 special on game-show bloopers hosted by William Shatner and in a late 1980s television tribute to Carol Burnett. Moore recounted the time circumstances forced Burnett and him to share a dressing room for one show. After many years, Moore <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> confession to make: [...] "I peeked." [...] Burnett replied, [...] "So did I." ...|$|E

He took over a team that had gone 0–10 in 1982 and led the Knights to a 5–6 record in 1983. He resigned midway through the 1984 season with UCF's record at 1–6. Saban, by then 63 years old, <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> meeting with school officials and felt he [...] "had no part in their plans for the future". At UCF, Saban was playfully referred to as Lou [...] "two point two" [...] Saban because his average tenure as a coach was 2.2 years. He was replaced by his assistant, Jerry Anderson.|$|E

500|$|Sanford {{announced}} in late December 1997 {{that he had}} been diagnosed with inoperable esophageal cancer and that his doctors <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> few months to live. After his release from the hospital, his condition slowly deteriorated. He died in his sleep while surrounded by his family at his Durham home. He was 80years old. At his funeral, he was eulogized by a childhood friend who said Sanford [...] "took [...] oath when he was twelve years old and kept it. It started out, 'On my honor, I will do my best to do my duty to God and my country,' and included such things as 'help other people at all times.' He believed it. He was the eternal Boy Scout." [...] Sanford is entombed in the crypt of Duke University Chapel.|$|E
500|$|Roger Moore <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> {{great fear}} of heights, {{and to do}} the {{climbing}} in Greece, he resorted to moderate drinking to calm his nerves. Later in that same sequence, Rick Sylvester, a stuntman who had previously performed the pre-credits ski jump in The Spy Who Loved Me, undertook the stunt of Bond falling {{off the side of}} the cliff. The stunt was dangerous, since the sudden rope jerk at the bottom could be fatal. Special effects supervisor Derek Meddings developed a system that would dampen the stop, but Sylvester recalled that his nerves nearly got the better of him: [...] "From where we were , you could see the local cemetery; and the box [...] looked like a casket. You didn't need to be an English major to connect the dots." [...] The stunt went off without a problem.|$|E
500|$|Eurogamer Schilling {{called the}} self-referential {{nature of the}} release a [...] "very postmodern conceit", which he thought worked well despite the dual faux pas of parodying The Matrix and overtly [...] "satirizing game mechanics". He felt that the satire was not good, though the writing was [...] "genuinely funny", and that the {{repeated}} Dominatrix fight scenes should not have felt as low budget. He recommended the pack for those who love [...] "wry gags about creaky gaming tropes with the occasional belly laugh", and <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> better time finding his own fun than playing through the missions. Patterson of Electronic Gaming Monthly noted {{that those who are}} looking for cost benefit would be disappointed by lack of content, especially those who had already finished the main game, but he was interested in Enter the Dominatrix for its behind-the-scenes aspects, which he encouraged other developers to use more often.|$|E
