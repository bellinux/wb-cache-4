40|$|Abstract—The radio {{spectrum}} is a scarce resource. Cognitive radio stretches this resource by enabling <b>secondary</b> <b>stations</b> {{to operate in}} portions of the spectrum that are reserved for primary stations but not currently used by the primary stations. As it is whenever stations share resources, coordination is a central issue in cognitive radio networks: absent coordination, there may be collision, congestion or interference, with concomitant loss of performance. Cognitive radio networks require coordination of <b>secondary</b> <b>stations</b> with primary <b>stations</b> (so that <b>secondary</b> <b>stations</b> should not interfere with primary <b>stations)</b> and of <b>secondary</b> <b>stations</b> with each other. Coordination in this setting is especially challenging because of {{the various types of}} sensing errors. This paper proposes novel protocols that enable <b>secondary</b> <b>stations</b> to learn and teach with the goal of coordinating to achieve a round-robin Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) schedule. These protocols are completely distributed (requiring neither central control nor the exchange of any control messages), fast (with speeds exceeding those of existing protocols), efficient (in terms of throughput and delay) and scalable. The protocols proposed rely on cooperative learning, exploiting the ability of stations to learn from and condition on their own histories while simultaneously teaching other stations about these histories. Analytic results and simulations illustrate the power of these protocols.

50|$|In {{the case}} of LORAN, one station remains {{constant}} in each application of the principle, the primary, being paired up separately with two other <b>secondary</b> <b>stations.</b> Given two <b>secondary</b> <b>stations,</b> the time difference (TD) between the primary and first secondary identifies one curve, and the time difference between the primary and second secondary identifies another curve, the intersections of which will determine a geographic point {{in relation to the}} position of the three stations. These curves are referred to as TD lines.|$|R
60|$|The day {{was not yet}} far advanced, {{when all}} the {{component}} parts of the grand procession {{had arrived in the}} square. Shortly after, a flourish of clarions gave notice of the approach of the authorities. First came the bailiff, filled with the dignity of station, and watching, with a vigilant but covert eye, every indication of feeling that might prove of interest to his employers, even while he most affected sympathy with the occasion and self-abandonment to the follies of the hour; for Peter Hofmeister owed his long-established favor with the bürgerschaft more to a never-slumbering regard to its exclusive interests and its undivided supremacy, than to any particular skill in the art of rendering men comfortable and happy. Next to the worthy bailiff, for apart from an indomitable resolution to maintain the authority of his masters, for good or for evil, the Herr Hofmeister merited the appellation of a worthy man, came Roger de Blonay and his guest the Baron de Willading, marching, pari passu, {{at the side of the}} representative of Berne himself. There might have been some question how far the bailiff was satisfied with this arrangement of the difficult point of etiquette, for he issued from his own gate with a sort of side-long movement that kept him nearly confronted to the Signor Grimaldi, though it left him the means of choosing his path and of observing the aspect of things in the crowd. At any rate, the Genoese, though apparently occupying a <b>secondary</b> <b>station,</b> had no grounds to complain of indifference to his presence. Most of the observances and not a few of the sallies of honest Peter, who had some local reputation as a joker and a bel esprit, as is apt to be the case with your municipal magistrate, more especially when he holds his authority independently of the community with whom he associates, and perhaps as little likely to be the fact when he depends on popular favor for his rank, were addressed to the Signor Grimaldi. Most of these good things were returned in kind, the Genoese meeting the courtesies like a man accustomed to be the object of peculiar attentions, and possibly like one who rather rioted in the impunity from ceremonies and public observation, that he now happened to enjoy. Adelheid, with a maiden of the house of Blonay, closed the little train.|$|E

In some cases <b>secondary</b> <b>stations</b> were assigned the same frequency, with provisions to avoid interference to the primary station's coverage, by having the <b>secondary</b> <b>stations</b> located long distances from the primary station, using limited powers, or restricted to daytime-only operation.|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} resource allocation for the Third Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP) long-term evolution (LTE) cognitive radio network (CRN). The CRN {{is made up of}} the licensed (primary) service stations which can share their spectrum resources with the unlicensed (<b>secondary)</b> <b>stations.</b> The objective is to provide wireless access to the <b>secondary</b> <b>stations</b> on a best effort basis without compromising the quality of service (QoS) for the primary stations. To accomplish this we employ a simple two-step procedure. In the first step the spectrum resources are allocated to primary stations to maximize the QoS for the primary users. In the second step the spare service capacity of the primary channels is distributed among the <b>secondary</b> <b>stations</b> to maximize the QoS of the secondary users. The proposed theoretical framework adheres closely with the LTE specification. The corresponding resource allocation algorithm does not involve additional network signaling over the wireless medium, and improves the overall QoS in the network. These advantages of the proposed approach for resource allocation make it ready for implementation in a real network...|$|R
