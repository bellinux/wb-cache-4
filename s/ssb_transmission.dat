5|$|After {{the work}} of John R. Carson in 1915 {{it became clear that}} {{multiplexed}} telephone transmissions could be greatly improved by the use of single sideband suppressed carrier (<b>SSB)</b> <b>transmission.</b> Compared to basic amplitude modulation (AM) SSB has the advantage of half the bandwidth and a fraction of the power (one sideband can have no more than 1/6 of the total power and would typically be a lot less). AM analysed in the frequency domain consists of a carrier and two sidebands. The carrier wave in AM represents the majority of the transmitted power but contains no information whatsoever. The two sidebands both contain identical information so only one is required, at least from an information transmission point of view. Up to this point filtering had been by simple tuned circuits. However, SSB required a flat response over the sideband of interest and maximum rejection of the other sideband with a very sharp transition between the two. As the idea was to put another (completely different) signal in the slot vacated by the unwanted sideband it was important that all traces of it were removed to prevent crosstalk. At the same time minimum distortion (i.e. flat response) is obviously desirable for the sideband being retained. This requirement led to a big research effort in the design of electric wave filters.|$|E

This requirement led to a big research effort in the design of electric wave filters.George A. Campbell and Zobel worked on this problem of extracting a single sideband from an amplitude-modulated composite wave for use in multiplexing telephone channels and the related problem of extracting (de-multiplexing) the signal {{at the far end of}} the transmission.|$|E
40|$|Abstract In this paper, the {{implications}} of linear channel dis-tortions in systems using envelope detection are reviewed and an equivalent baseband channel is formulated. Finally, the fibre optic channel is treated as a special case to analyse the impair-ments of Intensity Modulation/Direct Detection (IM/DD) sys-tems employing Single Sideband (<b>SSB)</b> <b>transmission...</b>|$|E
50|$|The band segment 10.120 to 10.140 {{may only}} be used for <b>SSB</b> <b>transmissions</b> {{in the area of}} Africa south of the equator during local {{daylight}} hours.|$|R
25|$|Output power limits {{may also}} {{depend on the}} mode of transmission. In Australia, for example, 400W {{may be used for}} <b>SSB</b> <b>transmissions,</b> but FM and other modes are limited to 120W.|$|R
50|$|Suppressed {{carriers}} {{are often used}} for single sideband (<b>SSB)</b> <b>transmissions,</b> such as for amateur radio on shortwave. That system is referred to in full as SSB suppressed carrier (SSBSC) or (SSB-SC). International broadcasters agreed in 1985 to also use SSBSC entirely by 2015, though IBOC and IBAC digital radio (namely Digital Radio Mondiale) seems likely to make this irrelevant.|$|R
40|$|We have {{designed}} and fabricated a silicon photonic in-phase-quadrature (IQ) modulator {{based on a}} nested dual-drive Mach-Zehnder structure incorporating electrical packaging. We have assessed its use for generating Nyquist-shaped single sideband (SSB) signals by operating it either as an IQ Mach-Zehnder modulator (IQ-MZM) or using just a single branch of the dual-drive Mach-Zehnder modulator (DD-MZM). The impact of electrical packaging on the modulator bandwidth is also analyzed. We demonstrate 40 Gb/s (10 Gbaud) 16 -ary quadrature amplitude modulation (16 -QAM) Nyquist-shaped <b>SSB</b> <b>transmission</b> over 160 km standard single mode fiber (SSMF). Without using any chromatic dispersion compensation, the bit error rates (BERs) of 5. 4 × 10 - 4 and 9. 0 × 10 - 5 were measured for the DD-MZM and IQ-MZM, respectively, far below the 7 % hard-decision forward error correction threshold. The performance difference between IQ-MZM and DD-MZM is most likely due to the non-ideal electrical packaging. Our work is the first experimental comparison between silicon IQ-MZM and silicon DD-MZM in generating SSB signals. We also demonstrate 50 Gb/s (12. 5 Gbaud) 16 -QAM Nyquist-shaped <b>SSB</b> <b>transmission</b> over 320 km SSMF with a BER of 2. 7 × 10 - 3. Both the silicon IQ-MZM and the DD-MZM show potential for optical transmission at metro scale and for data center interconnection...|$|E
25|$|As a result, <b>SSB</b> <b>transmissions</b> use the {{available}} amplifier energy more efficiently, providing longer-range transmission {{with little or}} no additional cost. Receivers normally select one of the two sidebands to amplify anyway, so implementing SSB in the receiver is simply a matter of allowing it to choose which sideband to amplify on reception, rather than simply choosing one or the other in the design stage.|$|R
25|$|However, {{in order}} for a {{receiver}} to reproduce the transmitted audio without distortion, it must be tuned to exactly the same frequency as the transmitter. Since this is difficult to achieve in practice, <b>SSB</b> <b>transmissions</b> can sound unnatural, and if the error in frequency is great enough, it can cause poor intelligibility. In order to correct this, a small amount of the original carrier signal can be transmitted so that receivers with the necessary circuitry to synchronize with the transmitted carrier can correctly demodulate the audio. This mode of transmission is called reduced-carrier single-sideband.|$|R
5000|$|In {{a number}} of {{countries}} the allocation is still channelized at present, whereas others have block or band allocations or a mixture. Voice operation is generally in upper sideband (USB) mode to facilitate inter-communication by non-amateur service users if necessary. In the United States and its Dependencies, channelized USB is mandatory. Where channelization is used, the USB suppressed carrier frequency (a.k.a. 'dial' frequency) is normally 1.5 kHz below the quoted channel frequency. For example, 5403.5 kHz is the 'dial' frequency for the channel centered on 5405 kHz. The [...] "center" [...] of the channel {{is based on the assumption}} that the bandwidth of <b>SSB</b> <b>transmissions</b> are 3 kHz, at most. Transmitters that are capable of wider SSB bandwidths should be adjusted for 3 kHz bandwidth or less so their emissions stay within the allocated channel.|$|R
50|$|Although {{average power}} {{is the same as}} PEP for complex {{modulation}} forms, such as FSK, the peak envelope power bears no particular ratio or mathematical relationship to longer-term average power in distorted envelopes, such as a CW waveform with power overshoot, or with amplitude modulated waveforms, such as SSB or AM voice transmissions. Typical average power of a <b>SSB</b> voice <b>transmission,</b> for example, is 10-20% of PEP. The percentage of longer term average power to PEP increases with processing, and commonly reaches ~50% with extreme speech processing.|$|R
