40|$|Belle II is {{the general}} purpose {{detector}} that will be operated by the second generation B-Factory SuperKEKB and it is currently in an advanced construction stage in KEK (Japan). SuperKEKB is a high luminosity asymmetric e+e− collider (peak luminosity up to 8 × 10 ^ 35 cm^− 2 s^− 1), with the center-of-mass energy tuned on {{the peak of the}} Υ(4 S) resonance. It realizes an optimal environment to perform precision measurements in the heavy flavour sector and it will allow collecting an integrated luminosity of 50 ab^− 1 of Υ(4 S) events. The Belle II detector is designed to study a broad spectrum of heavy flavour physics, including the CP violation of B and D systems and the rare decay modes of B, τ and D. The improved precision that will be achieved, thanks to the increased statistic and to the high performance of the detector, may allow to observe physics Beyond the Standard Model at energy scales higher than those directly accessible. Several channels in the Belle II physics program already show tensions with Standard Model predictions that might be signatures of New Physics. To perform the B physics measurements with the required precision and to fully exploit the B-Factory environment, it is essential to reconstruct the complete Υ(4 S) events including the momenta and the vertices of the charged particle tracks down to tens MeV/c and the energy neutral particles. To fulfil this demanding task, Belle II adopts a high performance silicon Vertex Detector (VXD), realized with two Pixel Detector layers (PXD) and four Silicon Strip Detector layers (SVD), and a Drift Chamber (CDC). The Belle II - Pisa group is involved in the production of the forward and backward regions SVD modules. This thesis work has been partially devoted performing electrical qualification test on the produced forward and backward modules, in the INFN Laboratories, while the main focus of the activity has been on the reconstruction software development, as described below. The Belle II tracking software is designed to perform the pattern recognition, vertexing and fitting procedures in the online (i. e. in the high level trigger of the experiment) and offline event reconstruction. One of the prominent features of the Belle II tracking software is its capability of efficiently reconstructing tracks down to p⊥ ∼ 50 MeV/c using a VXD standalone track finder (VXDTF), necessary for instance to reconstruct the low momentum pions from D∗ decays. In this momentum range the pattern recognition is particularly hard: only a few hits seen in VXD are available to reconstruct the tracks and the material effects, like energy losses and multiple scattering, significantly divert the trajectory from an ideal helix. To overcome this issue the VXDTF adopts the <b>Sector</b> <b>Map</b> concept, a lookup table called <b>Sector</b> <b>Map,</b> that contains the geometrical informations of the patterns, is used to compare the measured track information with the expected ones. The pattern recognition begins by building segments (pairs of hits), then triplets (pairs of segments sharing the inner hit) and then four-hit track (pairs of triplets sharing the inner segment). To reject the random combinations of hits, at each step geometrical and dynamical filters with the information provided by the <b>Sector</b> <b>Map</b> are applied. The <b>Sector</b> <b>Map</b> is realized collecting the information from a sample of simulated events, called Training Sample, which defines a priori the <b>Sector</b> <b>Map</b> that will be used in the actual data taking. After the reduction of the combinatorial burden performed by the <b>Sector</b> <b>Map</b> filters the tracks are identified and collected by a cellular automaton. Then, a best candidate selection is performed by a Hopfield Neural Network to remove the overlap between tracks which share hits. During the period of this thesis the Belle II tracking group has been involved in a redesign of VXDTF code, in order to improve its flexibility and maintainability. This redesign allows developing new strategies to improve the performance of the track finder, in term of efficiency, fake rate and time consumption. One of the critical points of the VXDTF is the definition of the Training Sample, that directly affects the <b>Sector</b> <b>Map</b> complexity and then the track finding efficiency and purity together with CPU time and memory footprint. In fact, if inside the Training Sample there are tracks which are very far from helical trajectories, and therefore not trackable, the <b>Sector</b> <b>Map</b> will allow the collection of patterns that will be discarded in fitting phase. Therefore these tracks increase the time consumption and the fake rate of the track finder, without a significant efficiency gain. One of the central points of this thesis is the development of the selection procedure of the Training Sample, with the definition of proper requirements on the simulated tracks in order identify and discard a priori the non trackable patterns, without discarding events of physical interest. One of the possible sources of this class of tracks are low momentum multiple scattering effects which make the track depart from the ideal trajectory. This effect increases at low the momentum, coherently with the observed degradation of the performance of the track finder. A chance to identify these tracks comes from the analysis of the track parameters in their evolution along the trajectory: these parameters should be constant along the track, and a strong variation in a certain position inside the detector is a signature of an unusually large interaction. The Training Sample selection shows several advantages: the fake rate, i. e. the number of random combination of hits selected by the VXDTF, is halved, the CPU time required by the VXDTF is reduced by a factor three and the fitting efficiency increases. The side effect is a small degradation of the low momentum tracking efficiency of some percent. Part of the thesis works covers the application of the redesigned track finder on the real data, with the participation to the DESY Testbeam in February 2017, where a six-layer sector of VXD has been tested on an electron beam with an energy up to 6 GeV. The purpose of the testbeam was to test the SVD and PXD sensors with the complete readout and trigger chain, and to test the tracking software after the substantial upgrades of the redesign. During the testbeam track finder performances studies has been performed together with the characterization of the SVD sensors in term of hit efficiency, with a very promising average value of 99. 6 %. In conclusion in my thesis work I have covered some of the most relevant aspects of the silicon tracking detector operations, from the single module electrical tests, to the optimization of tracking software, to the test of the tracker performance on beam...|$|E

40|$|Background: Surgical {{reconstruction}} of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) can be complicated by incorrect and variable tunnel placement, graft tunnel mismatch, cortical breaches, and inadequate fixation due to screw divergence. This is the first report describing {{the use of a}} C-arm with image intensifier employed {{for the sole purpose of}} eliminating those complications during trans-tibial ACL reconstruction. Purpose: To determine if the use of a C-arm with image intensifier during arthroscopically assisted transtibial ACL reconstruction (IIAA-TACLR) eliminated common complications associated with bone–patellar tendon–bone ACL reconstruction, including screw divergence, cortical breaches, graft-tunnel mismatch, and improper positioning of the femoral and tibial tunnels. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: A total of 110 consecutive patients (112 reconstructed knees) underwent identical IIAA-TACLR using a bone–patellar tendon–bone autograft performed by a single surgeon. Intra- and postoperative radiographic images and operative reports were evaluated for each patient looking for evidence of cortical breeching and screw divergence.

It does not address detection of recurrence, progression during active surveillance and evaluation of {{other parts of the}} body. PI-RADS™ v 2 improves and standardises communication between radiologists and urologists to detect or exclude the presence of significant prostate cancer with a high likelihood. Findings on mpMRI are assessed on a 5 -point category scale based on the probability that a combination of findings on T 2 -weighted (T 2 w) sequences, diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) correlates with the presence of a clinically significant prostate cancer at a particular location. PI-RADS assessment categories range from 1 to 5 with 5 being most likely to represent clinically significant prostate cancer. The dominant sequence to detect prostate cancer in the peripheral zone is DWI, whereas for tumour detection in the transition zone T 2 w is the most important sequence.

The PA group was subdivided into two subgroups, which comprised patients with temporal visual field (VF) defects (perimetric PA group, 34 eyes) and without VF defect (preperimetric PA group, 12 eyes). The mGCIPL thickness and circumpapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (cpRNFL) thickness were measured using Cirrus HD-OCT. We calculated {{the number of patients}} who had an abnormal GCA <b>sector</b> <b>map,</b> defined as at least one yellow or red sector. Eyes in the perimetric PA group had significantly decreased mGCIPL thickness in all sectors. Eyes in the preperimetric PA group had significantly thinner mGCIPL in the superior, superonasal, inferonasal, and inferior sectors than eyes in control group, but no changes in cpRNFL parameters were observed. The mGCIPL thickness in inferonasal area showed the greatest AUC value (0. 965), followed by the superonasal area (0. 958) for discriminating preperimetric PA group from the control group.

Xa- 1 is located on chromosome 10 and in the heterozygote state causes leaves to be yellow. Transgenic Ac-containing tomato plants which differed in the location and number of their Ac elements were crossed to Xa- 1 tester lines and F(1) progeny were scored for aberrant somatic sectoring. Of 800 test and control F(1) progeny screened, only four plants had aberrantly high levels of somatic sectors. Three of the plants had twin sectors consisting of green tissue adjacent to white tissue, and the other had twin sectors comprised of green tissue adjacent to tissue more yellow than the heterozygote background. Sectoring was inherited and the two <b>sectoring</b> phenotypes <b>mapped</b> to opposite homologs of chromosome 10; the green/yellow <b>sectoring</b> phenotype <b>mapped</b> in coupling to Xa- 1 while the green/white <b>sectoring</b> phenotype <b>mapped</b> in repulsion.

Sectoring was still observed after transposition of the Ac to a new site which indicated that sectoring was not limited to a single locus. In both sectored lines, meiotic recombination of the sectoring Ac to the opposite homolog caused the phenotype to switch between the green/yellow and the green/white phenotypes. Thus the two different sectoring phenotypes arose from the same Ac-induced mechanism; the phenotype depended on which chromosome 10 homolog the Ac was on. We believe that the twin sectors resulted from chromosome breakage mediated by a single intact, transposition-competent Ac element...|$|R

40|$|For many years, water {{resources}} management in Vietnam was concentrated on activities ensuring the available freshwater for agricultural production, including flood control. With the increase of water demands {{and the emergence of}} new water usages since the late 1980 s, this has subsequently changed. During the past two decades, and {{within the context of a}} broad economic transition process, the water sector has undergone a series of reforms, including various attempts to integrate environmental concerns; however, many challenges in {{water resources}} management still prevail to date. This paper starts with a brief overview on the historical development of {{water resources management}} in Northern and Southern Vietnam, in order to identify the roots of the current system. It then focuses on state management institutions in the water <b>sector,</b> <b>mapping</b> out the administrative apparatus and legal framework in order to understand how state management in the water sector is organised and practically works. Accordingly, national policies as well as its implementation in practices are examined. The paper concludes on the existing challenges for water resources management and indicates that the nation's overall pro economic growth aspirations still dominate over environmental concerns. Moreover, the political and administrative systems lack provisions for integrated, sustainable and long-term planning. A centralist top-down approach still prevails; whereas locally diverse problems require local solutions...|$|R
30|$|The {{majority}} of the computational cost of the proposed bispectrum {{is due to the}} fast Fourier transform (FFT). Therefore, the fundamental computation required for bispectral estimates is given by (7), the triple product of the three individual Fourier transformations, while this computation is straightforward, limitations on computer time and statistical variance impose severe limitations on implementation of the definition of the bispectrum [19]. On the other hand, we take advantage of the symmetrical properties of the bispectrum to reduce the computational complexity and memory requirements of calculating third-order statistics. It can now be calculated in any one <b>sector</b> and <b>mapped</b> onto the others [20].|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{a small and}} fixed number of fermions in an isolated one-dimensional trap (microcanonical ensemble). The ground state {{of the system is}} defined at T= 0, with the lowest single-particle levels occupied. The number of particles in this ground state fluctuates as a function of excitation energy. By breaking up the energy spectrum into particle and hole <b>sectors,</b> and <b>mapping</b> the problem onto the classic number partitioning theory, we formulate a new method to calculate the exact particle number fluctuation more efficiently than the direct combinatorics method. The exact ground state number fluctuation for particles interacting via an inverse-square pair-wise interaction is also calculated. Comment: 13 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
