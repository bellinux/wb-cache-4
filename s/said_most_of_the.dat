5|$|In late November 2007, a Hyderabad-based company named Goldstone Technologies {{acquired}} the film negative rights to 14Telugu films produced by Vijaya Vauhini Studios, including Mayabazar (1957) and Pelli Chesi Choodu, to release digitally re-mastered versions in colour. The remastered and colourised version of Mayabazar {{was released in}} January 2010 and performed well in theatres, but Goldstone Technologies decided not to remaster the remaining 14 films, including Pelli Chesi Choodu; the company <b>said</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> producers who sold {{the rights of the}} negatives to television channels lost control over them. Goldstone added that there were many legal issues over ownership and copyright whenever other producers tried to do something on their own.|$|E

AllMusic described Frith's singing on the album as [...] "strange high-pitched", and the songs as [...] "pop-like ditties" [...] with a [...] "simple and repetitive" [...] structure.

Nordby stated:Stage one is beautiful Jennifer and then two and three were strictly makeup where her eyes become more recessed and she would start to look plain {{like the rest of}} us. And stage four was some custom dentures that KNB made for her, and then visual effects in stage four was mainly facial warping and recessing her eyes some more and having a pinning effect to her irises {{and a variety of other}} musculature deforms, just bringing her cheek bones down more. And stage five was the full on, as crazy as it gets, which you don't really see until near the end.|$|E
500|$|Walker {{considered}} the compilation to be [...] "an {{almost unheard of}} opportunity to take something you had already released and make it better". Senior designer Mike Wikan <b>said</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> content additions were subtle changes, such as streamlining the engines for steady framerates and shorter loading times, and higher resolution textures. Prime had the addition of light bloom, and Echoes had difficulty tweaks to make it [...] "more accessible {{to those who were}} really intimidated early on". For Corruption, the code was examined to find ways to make it run faster and better than in the original Wii release. Besides the changes, the particle and water ripple effects found in the original versions of Prime were reduced, while the word [...] "damn" [...] uttered by the character Admiral Dane in Corruptions original release was also replaced with [...] "no".|$|E
500|$|Verlaine and Lloyd interplayed their guitars {{around the}} rhythm section's drum hits and basslines. Their dual playing drew on 1960s rock and avant-garde jazz styles, abandoning the layered power chords of {{contemporary}} punk rock {{in favor of}} melodic lines and counter-melodies. Verlaine established the song's rhythmic phrase, against which Lloyd played dissonant melodies. Lloyd had learned to notate his solos {{by the time they}} recorded Marquee Moon, allowing him to develop his solo for a song from introduction to variation and resolution. The two traded rhythmic and melodic lines several times on some songs while producing tension. [...] "There weren't many bands where the two guitars played rhythm and melody back and forth, like a jigsaw puzzle", Lloyd <b>said.</b> <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solos on Marquee Moon followed a pattern wherein Verlaine ran up a major scale but regressed slightly after each step. On [...] "See No Evil", he soloed through a full octave before playing a blues-influenced riff, and on the title track, he played in a Mixolydian mode and lowered the seventh by half a step. Lloyd opened [...] "Friction" [...] by playing octaves before Verlaine's ringing harmonics and series of descending scales.|$|E

500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN Movies {{gave the}} film {{two out of}} five stars. He was unhappy with the little screen time Bell and Elwes had been given, saying that the time the film did spend with them didn't have much impact. He said the traps were a step down from Saw VI, but did point out his {{favorite}} and highlight of the film as the [...] "garage trap". About the film's 3D effects, Goldman said [...] "The 3D is used {{as you might expect}} it to be – which is to say, this is no James Cameron immersive experience. Instead, blades jut out of the screen, and there is some fun had with blood and guts literally shooting forward at several points". [...] Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a mixed review. He said Saw 3D is [...] "consistent both stylistically and thematically with previous editions", but <b>said</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film's traps lack the [...] "Rube Goldberg-style cleverness that marked the series". [...] Scheck {{went on to say that}} it was [...] "unfortunate" [...] the creators killed Bell's character so early in the series and called Mandylor's character (Hoffman) an [...] "exceedingly bland stand-in". He called the visual impact of the 3D [...] "negligible".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{positive to}} fair reviews. Alan Sepinwall, television journalist for The Star-Ledger, said [...] "Boys' Club" [...] was funnier that previous episode and included scenes with good physical comedy involving Leslie, particularly when she spilled the beer bottles; he also praised Andy's [...] "naked crutch chase". Matt Fowler of IGN said the episode {{gave a little}} more insight into Leslie's [...] "aspirations about {{wanting to be a}} woman who succeeds in government, which {{is a step in the}} right direction", but Fowler said her constant mistakes and wrong decisions bog down the story. Fowler said the best part of the episode was Andy's subplot, particularly the scene in which he hops down the street naked on his crutches. Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B- grade, and said the Amy Poehler character needs to be more fully formed in future episodes. Phipps <b>said</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> show's laughs came from supporting characters Andy, Tom and Ron; he also particularly praised Ron's shutdown of Leslie's hearing and his monologues of the ideal government: [...] "One guy, who sits in a small room at a desk. And the only thing he’s allowed to decide is who to nuke." [...] Jeremy Medina of Entertainment Weekly liked that the episode included a moral crisis of sorts for Leslie, who he described as [...] "a realized character instead of a caricature".|$|E

2500|$|In Illinois, {{proposed}} legislation in 2013 would have defined the term [...] "semi-automatic assault weapon" [...] to mean any semi-automatic firearm {{able to accept}} a detachable magazine, {{but it was never}} brought to a vote.

The NRA said the proposal would have restricted about 75 percent of handguns and 50 percent of long guns in circulation. As municipalities, Chicago and Cook County bans certain firearms defined as assault weapons and have no provision for legal possession of firearms owned before their laws were passed. [...] Minnesota also defines certain firearms as assault weapons and regulates their sales.|$|E

[...] "When I asked why he took the photos, he said their moms asked him to. I remember the girls were naked." [...] "He said he was a professional, so in my mind I was being a model for him," [...] said a woman who allowed Alcala to photograph her in 1979.

60|$|On {{the road}} our pretty muletress gossiped cheerfully, and our patriarch gloomily, {{and between the}} two we {{accumulated}} a store of information concerning the present inhabitants of Capri, which, I am sorry to say, has now {{for the most part}} failed me. I remember that they <b>said</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land-owners at Capri were Neapolitans, and that these villas were their country-houses; though they pointed out one of the stateliest of the edifices as belonging to a certain English physician who had come to visit Capri for a few days, and had now been living on the island twenty years, having married (said the muletress) the prettiest and poorest girl in the town, from this romance--something like which the muletress seemed to think might well happen concerning herself--we passed lightly to speak of kindred things, the muletress responding gayly between the blows she bestowed upon her beast. The accent of these Capriotes has something of German harshness and heaviness: they say non bosso instead of non posso, and monto instead of mondo, and interchange the t and d a good deal; and they use for father the Latin pater, instead of padre. But this girl's voice, as I said, was very musical, and the island's accent was sweet upon her tongue.|$|E
60|$|Jason complied, {{and for an}} hour or two we had the {{pleasure}} of accompanying the young ladies, as they strolled among the booths and different groups of that singular assembly. As has been <b>said,</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blacks had been born in the colony, but there were some native Africans among them. New York never had slaves on the system of the southern planters, or in gangs of hundreds, to labour in the fields under overseers, and who lived apart in cabins of their own; but, our system of slavery was strictly domestic, the negro almost invariably living under the same roof with the master, or, if his habitation was detached, as certainly sometimes happened, it was still near at hand, leaving both races as parts of a common family. In the country, the negroes never toiled in the field, but it was as ordinary husbandmen; and, in the cases of those who laboured on their own property, or as tenants of some extensive land-ford, the black did his work at his master's side. Then all, or nearly all our household servants were, and still are, blacks, leaving that department of domestic economy almost exclusively in their hands, with the exception of those cases in which the white females busied themselves also in such occupations, united to the usual supervision of the mistresses. Among the Dutch, in particular, the treatment of the negro was of the kindest character, a trusty field slave often having quite as much to say on the subject of the tillage and the crops, as the man who owned both the land he worked, and himself.|$|E
