HBO also advised viewers that purchasing a descrambler for $395 ($882.21 in 2017 dollars) would (along with the monthly fee) allow them to continue watching HBO. Several satellite dish dealers across the United States closed their stores {{as a result of}} a reduction in dish sales, caused by the rise in <b>signal</b> <b>scrambling.</b> Satellite dish owners began protests over scrambling, saying that clear signals from cable channels would become difficult to receive. One such protest was by members of the Satellite Television Industry Association, who converged on Washington, D.C., in March 1986 to urge the United States Congress to protect access to satellite transmissions.|$|E

40|$|Speech {{scrambling}} {{methods are}} widely used for copyright protection and encrypting digital speech signals in order to guarantee the confidentiality of the original signals. They are very important methods for preventing eavesdropping and unauthorized copying. However, {{it seems to be}} impossible to completely recover a <b>scrambled</b> speech <b>signal</b> into the original signal. Moreover, nobody can comprehend the partial speech content from speech <b>signals</b> <b>scrambled</b> with these methods. In this paper, we propose a semi-scramble method for speech signals based on phonemic restoration. By using a speech scrambling method based on the random-bit shift of quantization bits, speech signals are converted to <b>scrambled</b> <b>signals</b> in partial intervals. We evaluated the confidentiality and efficiency of the proposed method by using two objective measures, signal-to-error ratio (SER) and perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ). As a result, we confirmed that the proposed method can play a role in copyright protection for an original signal and recover a semi-scrambled speech signal into the original one. Finally, we indicated that the acoustic characteristics of signal semi-scrambled with the proposed method enable the listener to understand the speech information...|$|R
50|$|An {{independently}} validated {{study by}} Frank and Levinson in 1973 indicated that 97% of 115 dyslexics evidenced neurological and electronystagmographic {{signs of a}} dysfunction within the inner-ear and its supercomputer—the cerebellum. Dyslexia was postulated to occur when impaired ocular-motor fixation and sequential tracking due to a subclinical nystagmus of inner-ear and cerebellar origin scrambled the letter and word signals during reading and thus secondarily interfered with their cerebral cortical and related brain processing. A follow-up study of 4,000 learning disabled and dyslexics in 1988 further validated the hypotheses. Utilizing an optokinetic instrument, dyslexics were shown to have significantly reduced ocular-motor fixation, sequential tracking and visual span capacities as well as abnormal <b>signal</b> <b>scrambling</b> vs controls. Inner-ear-enhancing anti-motion sickness medications were clinically recognized to improve most all reading and non-reading dyslexic symptoms and mechanisms. Later research suggested {{that a majority of}} those with fears, phobias and related anxiety disorders have cerebellar-vestibular determinants and deficits as well as related abnormal optokinetic tracking, visual span and signal capacities vs controls.|$|E
50|$|The {{cerebellar}} theory {{asserts that}} a mildly dysfunctional cerebellum can cause dyslexia. The initial cerebellar hypothesis {{suggested that a}} <b>signal</b> <b>scrambling</b> impairment of cerebellar origin secondarily impaired brain processors. In attempting to explain all the many known reading and non-reading dyslexic symptoms, therapies and theories {{as well as the}} presence of only cerebellar and related vestibular neurophysiological signs in dyslexics, the cerebellum was postulated to fine-tune in time and space all signals (visual, auditory, tactile, proprioceptive, motion) entering and leaving the brain as well as signal interconnections. The quality and severity of the many symptoms characterizing each dyslexic was reasoned to depend on the diverse cerebral cortical and other brain processors receiving scrambled signals due to a cerebellar dysfunction, the degree of signal- scrambling as well as the compensatory descrambling capability of specific brain processors. Helpful therapies were reasoned to enhance cerebellar fine tuning (e.g.,the use of cerebellar-vestibular stabilizing antimotion sickness medications) and/or improve descrambling and other compensatory cognitive capabilities (e.g.,tutoring, biofeedback). Most other theories equate the dyslexia disorder with impaired reading comprehension and so attempt to only explain the latter. Another cerebellar proposal indicated that articulation problems can contribute to the phonological deficits that can cause dyslexia. The cerebellum also contributes to the automitisation of learned behaviors, which can include learning the grapheme-phoneme relationships when reading texts. However, some have suggested that cerebellardysfunction alone may not be a primary cause of dyslexia and that dysarticulation andphonological deficits appear unrelated.|$|E
30|$|<b>Signal</b> <b>scrambling</b> {{techniques}} {{differ from}} each other in how the <b>signal</b> <b>scrambling</b> is performed to decrease the PAPR. Reducing PAPR via <b>signal</b> <b>scrambling</b> causes no in-band interferences and MER degradation. However, most of these approaches imply the use of a portion of sub-carriers/bits or transmission of additional information. Furthermore, to obtain the optimum PAPR reduction gain a search of all possible combinations of the bits is needed which requires a high computational effort [11].

50|$|A {{method of}} {{achieving}} the spreading {{of a given}} signal {{is provided by the}} modulation scheme. With DSSS, the message signal is used to modulate a bit sequence known as a Pseudo Noise (PN) code; this PN code consists of a radio pulse that is much shorter in duration (larger bandwidth) than the original message signal. This modulation of the message <b>signal</b> <b>scrambles</b> and spreads the pieces of data, and thereby resulting in a bandwidth size nearly identical to that of the PN sequence. In this context, the duration of the radio pulse for the PN code {{is referred to as the}} chip duration. The smaller this duration, the larger the bandwidth of the resulting DSSS signal; more bandwidth multiplexed to the message signal results in better resistance against interference.|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} improve the power {{efficiency}} of OFDM systems, various PAPR reduction techniques have been proposed, which can be categorized into <b>signal</b> <b>scrambling</b> and signal distortion technologies. Signal distortion schemes such as clipping, windowing and peak cancellation reduce peak power at cost of reduced signal quality and usually spectral regrowth. Some <b>signal</b> <b>scrambling</b> schemes such as coding require additional bits to reduce PAPR {{at the cost of}} reduced data rate. Another group of <b>signal</b> <b>scrambling</b> approaches including Selective Level Mapping (SLM), Partial Transmit Sequence (PTS), and Hadamard Transformation either requires side information at the receiver to decode the input signal or modification of the receiver structure; thus, both are not standards compliant. Active constellation extension is another <b>signal</b> <b>scrambling</b> scheme, where the outer points of signal constellations are extended adaptively so that the PAPR of an OFDM symbol is minimized [3 – 5]. This method does not result in throughput and MER loss and thus is of interest for practical use in many OFDM-based systems.|$|E

With PNC, <b>signal</b> <b>scrambling</b> due to interference, which causes packet collisions in the MAC layer protocol of traditional wireless networks (e.g., IEEE 802.11), can be eliminated.|$|E

40|$|Methods of {{communications}} using chaotic signals use an {{ability of a}} chaos generator (encoder) and matched response system (decoder) to behave identically despite the instability of chaotic oscillations. Chaotic oscillations cover a wide spectral domain and can efficiently mask an information <b>signal</b> <b>scrambled</b> by the chaotic encoder. At {{the same time the}} wide spectrum poses intrinsic difficulties in the chaotic decoding if the chaotic signal is transmitted over real communication channels with limited bandwidth. We address this problem both numerically and experimentally. Two alternative ways to improve communication with chaos over band-limited channels are investigated. The first method employs a matching filter in the decoder which compensates channel distortions of the transmitted signal. This modification does not change the individual dynamics of chaotic systems in the synchronous state however the information signal injected into the driving system, breaks the symmetry between encoder and decoder and therefore exact recovery is impossible. We show that this approach has limited ability for synchronization of chaotic encoder. The second approach does not use adaptive compensation but relies on the design of chaotic oscillators which produce narrow-band chaotic waveforms.

Some of the major drawbacks in OFDM are its high peak-to-average-power ratio(PAPR) of the transmitted signals and the synchronization of signals. OFDM consist of large number of independent subcarriers, as a result of which the amplitude of such a signal can have high peak values.

It is expected that the full integration of outside-hospital personal health information and hospital electronic health records will further promote preventative health services as well as global health.

40|$|Altricial nestlings in {{structured}} families show {{a diverse}} array of behavioural mechanisms to compete for food, ranging from <b>signalling</b> <b>scrambles</b> to aggressive interference. Rates of filial infanticide are moderately high in white storks. It has been hypothesized that this unusual behaviour is an adaptive parental response {{to the absence of}} efficient mechanisms of brood reduction (aggression or direct physical interference) by nestlings. To test this latter assumption, we analyzed video recordings of 41 complete feeding episodes at 32 broods {{during the first half of}} the nestling period, when nestlings complete 90 % of growth and chick mortality and size asymmetries are highest. Parents delivered food to all nestlings simultaneously by regurgitating on the nest floor. No direct (bill to bill) feeding was recorded. Senior nestlings were never observed to limit their junior nestlings from eating food, either by aggression or physical interference. Experimental feeding tests revealed that heavier nestlings handled prey items more efficiently and ate food at a higher speed. The high degree of tolerance shown by senior nestlings is unusual among birds with similar ecological and phylogenetic affinities, such as herons. Tolerance by seniors cannot be easily explained by absence of parental favouritism or proximate factors known to affect the occurrence of sibling aggression in other species (rate of food transfer, brood size, hatching asynchrony or length of nestling period).
