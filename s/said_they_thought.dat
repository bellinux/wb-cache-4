She {{said that she was}} approached by groups such as MoveOn.org and Win Without War to go on TV, because these organizations say that the networks were not allowing antiwar voices to be heard. Garofalo and the other celebrities who appeared at the time <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> their fame could lend attention to that side of the debate. Her appearances on cable news prior to the war garnered her praise from the left and spots on the cover of Ms. and Venus Zine.

25|$|On 17 June 2010, a Scilly shrew made {{headlines}} on BBC Cornwall when it stowed {{away from the}} Isles of Scilly on Scillonian III. The small 2 in (5 cm) mammal was discovered {{in a corner of}} the Upper Deck as the ferry was about to arrive in Penzance and staff were clearing the area near the gangway. Paul Semmens, the Isles of Scilly Wildlife Trust's onboard marine guide, identified the animal as a shrew about two months old and looked after it for the night. The next day, the shrew was flown back from Penzance to Scilly on a Skybus plane and released back into its natural environment. Managers at the Isles of Scilly Steamship Company <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> it could have been the smallest passenger ever to travel on Scillonian III and the Skybus.|$|E

500|$|A second {{version of}} the video (known as the Sugar Lumps version), which adds the Sugar Lumps—a satirical {{version of the}} Spice Girls played by Kathy Burke, Dawn French, Llewella Gideon, Lulu, and Jennifer Saunders—was filmed for the [...] "Red Nose Day" [...] of the 1997 Comic Relief, {{one of the two}} {{high-profile}} telethon events held in the United Kingdom. The video starts with the Sugar Lumps as schoolgirls dreaming of becoming Spice Girls, and ends with them joining the group on stage, while dancing and lip-synching the song. Halliwell commented about the shoot: [...] "The women were all really warm and funny and nice. The freakiest thing about it was seeing Jennifer Saunders. She looked just like me and everyone <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> she was me. It was alsolutely bizarre–the make-up, everything. It was scary–like, do I really do that?".|$|E

It was the highest-rated show on the Fox network that week. The episode {{was nominated for a}} Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program, but lost to Will Vinton's A Claymation Easter on CBS. [...] "Radio Bart" [...] was submitted for consideration because it was the staff's favorite episode of the season. Executive producer Al Jean <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> this episode or an episode of The Ren & Stimpy Show would win and they were [...] "absolutely floored" [...] when neither did. The Simpsons director David Silverman said he thinks The Simpsons and Ren & Stimpy split the vote, allowing A Claymation Easter to win the Emmy.|$|E

According to witness statements, the aircraft climbed to a height of between [...] and , before the nose began to rise. One said the aircraft was [...] "wobbling" [...] and another <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> the aircraft had stalled. The aircraft impacted with the roof of a three-storey apartment building before it crashed into a wooded ravine approximately 250 feet from busy Buford Highway, a major Atlanta road lined with apartments. All five passengers and two crew members were killed in the accident, and an individual on the ground, standing in a parking lot, sustained serious burns from aviation fuel and remained in a critical condition for a day after the accident.

Newsday indicated that it was Ortega and other protest leaders who called for participants to march to Miraflores. [...] "Many marchers <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> the call to proceed to Miraflores was spontaneous," [...] reported Newsday, but some planners [...] "said the idea had always been to bring crowds to Miraflores to demand Chávez's resignation once they had sufficient turnout and a pledge from the military that it would second their call for his ouster." [...] At the palace the protesters shouted [...] "Chávez Out!" [...] The New York Times quoted Ortega as shouting: [...] "Chávez get out!... We do not want you! We reject you!" [...] Shortly after the protesters arrived at Miraflores, Chávez issued a call for calm on national TV. According to an opinion piece by Sandra Hernandez, opposition TV aired images of anti-Chávez protesters outside the palace being beaten by troops.|$|E
2500|$|Some hockey legends in {{interviews}} {{throughout the years}} have commented on Fedorov's abilities, such as former Red Wings teammate Nicklas Lidström: [...] "I think he's {{the best player in}} the League. He's real tough to defend against. He's got quickness to best you if you step up to him. It's tough to stop him." [...] Former Boston Bruins legend Ray Bourque once said, [...] "Sergei is a dominating player, a franchise player. When he makes a move on you, he has the ability to maintain his speed or even go faster. There aren't many defensemen who can keep up with him." [...] Steve Yzerman and Wayne Gretzky speaking to Fox Sports columnist and Detroit radio host Art Regner in past interviews <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> [...] "Fedorov is the most talented player they've ever seen." [...] After leaving the Red Wings (his first season with Anaheim, in which he scored 31 times), Fedorov had multiple injuries and his tally of 18 goals in 2006-07 was the most he scored until his retirement from the NHL in 2008-09.|$|E

A more recent poll now suggest that 45% of Argentineans are in favor of abortion for any reason in the first twelve weeks. This same poll conducted in September 2011 also suggests that most Argentineans favor abortion being legal when a woman's health or life is at risk (81%), when the pregnancy is a result of rape (80%) or the fetus has severe abnormalities (68%). A March 2007 poll regarding the abortion law in Brazil found that 65% of Brazilians believe that it [...] "should not be modified", 16% that it should be expanded [...] "to allow abortion in other cases", 10% that abortion should be [...] "decriminalized", and 5% were [...] "not sure".

2500|$|On August 16, 1988, at the Republican {{convention}} in New Orleans, Louisiana, George H. W. Bush chose Quayle {{to be his}} running mate in the 1988 United States presidential election. The choice immediately became controversial. Outgoing President Ronald Reagan praised Quayle for his [...] "energy and enthusiasm". Press coverage of the convention was dominated with questions about [...] "the three Quayle problems", in the phrase of Brent Baker, {{executive director of the}} Media Research Center, a conservative group that monitors television coverage. The questions involved his military service, a golf trip to Florida with Paula Parkinson, and whether he had enough experience to be vice president. Quayle seemed at times rattled and at other times uncertain or evasive as he tried to handle the questions. Delegates to the convention generally blamed television and newspapers for the focus on Quayle's problems, but Bush's staff <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> Quayle had mishandled the questions about his military record, leaving questions dangling. Although Bush was trailing by up to 15 points in public opinion polls taken before the convention, in August, the Bush/Quayle ticket took the lead, which they did not relinquish {{for the rest of the}} campaign.|$|E
2500|$|After leaving Chicago, Cetera {{continued}} his streak of success. His first single, [...] "Glory of Love" [...] {{was used as}} the theme song for the film The Karate Kid Part II. Co-written by Cetera, David Foster, and Diane Nini, Cetera has said it was written originally for the film, Rocky IV. It was a number one hit on the Billboard Hot 100 and Adult Contemporary charts in the US in 1986, and achieved similar success throughout the world. It went on to win an ASCAP Award for Cetera for Most Performed Songs from Motion Pictures and a BMI Film & TV Award for David Foster for Most Performed Song from a Film. [...] It was also nominated for both an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award in the category of Best Original Song, as well as a Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Male Artist. He performed a shortened version of the song live at the 59th Academy Awards ceremony. In two interviews Cetera gave in 1987, he discussed people’s confusion about [...] "Glory of Love", and <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> initially that it was a new song by Chicago. By February of that year, however, he had achieved enough recognition as a solo performer to win the American Video Award for [...] "best new artist".|$|E

2500|$|Just {{before the}} NPA's announcement, however, {{at least two}} {{political}} parties intimated that they would consider legal action of their own should the charges be dropped. The Democratic Alliance subsequently filed for a judicial review of the NPA's decision, with party leader Helen Zille stating that Mpshe had [...] "not taken a decision based in law, but [...] buckled to political pressure". The case was set to be heard on 9 June 2009. Whilst Zuma filed his responses timeously, Mpshe delayed the hearing of the matter, requesting two extensions to file the NPA's response. NPA spokesperson Mthunzi Mhaga {{said he could not}} file papers because there were [...] "outstanding matters" [...] to be resolved. Zille, the Democratic Alliance's party head contended that Zuma's response was fundamentally wrong and [...] "devoid of any constitutional basis". Whilst the legal challenges continued, a survey showed that, as at June 2009, more than half of South Africans believed President Jacob Zuma was doing a good job. The poll, conducted by TNS Research Studies in the last half of June 2009, revealed that Zuma's approval ratings had steadily improved. Around 57% of the people polled <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> Zuma was a capable leader – this was up 3% from April 2009 when the president was inaugurated. In November 2008, just months after former president Thabo Mbeki was recalled and when Zuma was facing graft charges, only 36% of South Africans were positive about him.|$|E

They later said that Derek had previously declared that he and Kat were [...] "two peas in a pod", which would [...] "make her very appealing to an egotist like Derek!" [...] They said that [...] "sparks would fly if Derek and Kat hooked up. He's got that dangerous edge that [...] Kat loves, but Alfie lacks! And we all know that Derek's a man who's used to getting what he wants—every time..." [...] Soaplife said that Derek is part of every other storyline and actor Foreman's contract was extended, so the chances of it being Derek are high, but they did not want it to be Derek. However, they later <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> it would be Derek, as love is not Kat's motivation (ruling out Jack), and Derek {{is the only one who}} would not be cheating on a partner, saying the others [...] "would have to cheat on their other half [...] for no better reason than Kat has to cheat on Alfie (ie. none). And that would be too far-fetched." [...] They said Derek would probably enjoy the danger of being caught out by Alfie, and continued to rule out the other suspects, maintaining that they have seen nothing to change their minds that it is Derek. All About Soap wondered if Derek would have the time and inclination to woo Kat as he is struggling to bond with his children Alice and Joey Branning (David Witts), and opined that he would, and the fact that [...] "he's just the wrong side of dodgy, [...] right up Kat's street. Walford's creepiest couple could be on the cards!" [...] They made him their joint third favourite for the affair, along with Ray, and later said that an affair between Kat and Derek would be [...] "very believable" [...] but [...] "more than a little bit gross", noting that Derek is on a power trip and Kat loves to be dominated and as there is more to the affair than physical attraction, there would be a [...] "strong chance" [...] it would be Derek.
