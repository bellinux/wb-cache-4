40|$|Purpose This {{research}} employs value co-destruction as {{a theoretical}} lens {{to investigate the}} antecedents of consumer <b>showrooming</b> behavior. Drawing on relevant literature, a research model specifying <b>showrooming</b> dynamics from the consumer’s perspective is conceptualized and empirically tested. Methodology Utilizing survey data from 275 consumers, structural equation modelling is employed to assess a research model including thirteen hypotheses. Findings The study findings reveal that <b>showrooming</b> behavior is complex and comprises differing degrees of accumulative value co-destruction and value co-creation behavior across online and offline channels. Specifically, consumer characteristics, channel characteristics and product characteristics are shown {{to be associated with}} in-store value taking and online value co-destruction and co-creation. Originality and Value Scholarly insights into the antecedents of consumer <b>showrooming</b> are rare. In responding to calls for research, this paper represents the first empirical investigation of consumer <b>showrooming</b> behavior utilizing the lens of value co-destruction. The study adds to academic understanding of the <b>showrooming</b> phenomena and demonstrates that co-destructive and co-creative behaviors can occur in a simultaneous, concurrent and iterative fashion. Focusing on practice, the findings reveal opportunities for experience-led shopping environments...|$|R

This paper focuses specifically {{on the relationship between}} hairdressers and L’Oréal Redken, using a dyadic research methodology that improves upon previous research of <b>showrooming</b> that often have limited their studies to only one side of the relationship.
