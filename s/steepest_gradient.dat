5|$|Rafting is also {{popular in}} some of the Canadian {{stretches}} of the river, especially those near the headwaters that have the <b>steepest</b> <b>gradient</b> and the most challenging rapids. Several Canadian outfitters provide trips on the river near Kootenay National Park ranging from a few hours to several days. Canoeing in the numerous sloughs, side-channels and distributaries of the Kootenay that thread through the wetlands of the Kootenay Flats has the additional benefit of watching birds and wildlife in the Creston Valley Wildlife Management Unit and other surrounding marshes. Larger craft such as houseboats are able to travel on Kootenay and Koocanusa Lakes. Rafting and kayaking is also an activity on the swift-flowing Slocan River, the lowermost major tributary of the Kootenay, and in parts of other major Kootenay tributaries as well.|$|E
25|$|A trial trip to Mapperley {{was made}} on 1 May on car 57. Apparently {{it was a very}} hot day and the driver of the car said that much sand was needed to {{overcome}} the stickiness of the tar, which had melted and overflowed onto the rails from between the setts. The <b>steepest</b> <b>gradient</b> of the section was 1 in 11. Major Pringle, the Board of Trade inspector, duly inspected the approved route on 6 May and public service commenced a week later, on 13 May. This service operated via the Market Place to Trent Bridge every 12 minutes, alternating with a short working between Alexandra Park and Trent Bridge every 12 minutes. The fare between the Market Place and Mapperley was 2d., with intermediate 1d. stages. At first there was a stop on the outward journey at Cranmer Street, but this was discontinued early in 1903 because of the difficulty of restarting the cars, the hill being at its steepest at this point.|$|E
500|$|After Foss-Eikeland, {{the line}} crosses Figgjo River on a [...] truss bridge.

It had a [...] passing loop and a [...] platform, and a [...] single-story station building in wood.

500|$|The {{line was}} built with [...] narrow gauge, a {{minimum curve radius}} of [...] and a <b>steepest</b> <b>gradient</b> of 3.0 percent. It was the only line in Norway for which no {{blasting}} was done during construction. At the old Lier Station, located [...] {{above mean sea level}} (AMSL), the line connected with the Drammen Line and then ran [...] northwards up the Lier Valley. The line passed through stations at Landfald and Egge before reaching a branch line to the gravel pit at Egge. The line continued past Utengen and Sjåstad before crossing the wooden, [...] Sjåstad Bridge. It then ran past Muggerud and ran along the [...] viaduct across Sverregropen until passing Iledalen. A [...] branch line ran from Iledalen via a wooden [...] bridge over Solbergelva to Tronstad Bruk. The main line continued across the wooden, [...] bridge over the creek Solbergelva before reaching Sylling. This was the line's highest elevation, at [...] AMSL. Between there and Holsfjorden, a branch of the Tyrifjorden lake, the line was built with a zig-zag, so the train had to back [...] and then continue forward. At Svangstrand, located [...] AMSL there was connection with a steam ship.|$|E

2500|$|After passing under Schlicher's Covered Bridge and a {{pedestrian}} footbridge, the Jordan Creek makes a hairpin curve, ultimately turning to flow straight south. [...] To {{the east of}} the creek, in this section, arises Elk Ridge—the last and easterly most rise of the Schochary Ridge. [...] The elevation rise from Jordan Creek to Elk Ridge is the <b>steepest</b> <b>gradient</b> and largest elevation gain in the park. [...] The Jordan continues under a second pedestrian bridge—erected in 1997—and over the Zoo's ford. [...] Elk Ridge Run, Macintosh Run and Thicket Run are all seasonally intermittent minor tributaries of the Jordan. Just before the ford, the Jordan is joined by [...] Elk Ridge Run. This south flowing watercourse begins near the bison paddocks and drains the eastern slope of Elk Ridge and the western slope of the environmental center grasslands. After the ford, the Jordan Creek continues south until forming a confluence with Macintosh Run.|$|E
60|$|From Offenburg to Hornberg {{the road}} {{makes a good}} stiff climb of twenty-seven miles, and some 1200 English feet in altitude, with {{a fair number of}} minor {{undulations}} on the way to diversify it. I will not describe the route, though {{it is one of the}} most beautiful I have ever travelled--rocky hills, ruined castles, huge, straight-stemmed pines that clamber up green slopes, or halt in sombre line against steeps of broken crag; the reality surpasses my poor powers of description. And the people I passed on the road were almost as quaint and picturesque in their way as the hills and the villages--the men in red-lined jackets; the women in black petticoats, short-waisted green bodices, and broad-brimmed straw hats with black-and-crimson pompons. But on the <b>steepest</b> <b>gradient,</b> just before reaching Hornberg, I got my first nibble--strange to say, from two German students; they wore Heidelberg caps, and were toiling up the incline with short, broken wind; I put on a spurt with the Manitou, and passed them easily. I did it just at first in pure wantonness of health and strength; but the moment I was clear of them, it occurred to the business half of me that here was a good chance of taking an order. Filled with this bright idea, I dismounted near the summit, and pretended to be engaged in lubricating my bearings; though as a matter of fact the Manitou runs in a bath of oil, self-feeding, and needs no looking after. Presently, my two Heidelbergers straggled up--hot, dusty, panting. Woman-like, I pretended to take no notice. One of them drew near and cast an eye on the Manitou.|$|E
