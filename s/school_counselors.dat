Budget cuts, however, have affected placement of public <b>school</b> <b>counselors</b> in Canada, Ireland, the United States, and other countries due to the global recession in recent years. In the United States, rural areas and urban areas traditionally have been under-served by <b>school</b> <b>counselors</b> in public schools due to both funding shortages and often a lack of best practice models.

The study shared school counselors' views on educational policies, practices, and reform, and how many of them, especially in urban and rural school settings, are not given the chance to focus on what they were trained to do, especially career and college access counseling and readiness for all students, in part due to high caseloads and inappropriate tasks that take up too much of their time. <b>School</b> <b>counselors</b> made strong suggestions about their crucial role in accountability and success for all students and how school systems need to change so that <b>school</b> <b>counselors</b> can be key players in student success. Implications for public policy and district and school-wide change are addressed. The National Center for Transforming School Counseling at The Education Trust released a brief, Poised to Lead: How <b>School</b> <b>Counselors</b> Can Drive Career and College Readiness, challenging all schools to utilize <b>school</b> <b>counselors</b> for equity and access for rigorous courses for all students and ensuring college and career access skills and competencies be a major focus of the work of <b>school</b> <b>counselors</b> K-12.|$|E

40|$|M. Ed. The {{primary purpose}} of this enquiry was to {{discover}} {{whether or not a}} relation exists between how school counselors’ in training, enrolled in an Honours programme relates to the proposed theoretical model of counselor development by Skovholt and Ronnestad (1992). The three-stage model assumes that counselors, who engage with a registered educational counselor training programme, progressively move through the incremental stages transitioning towards personal and professional development. A second purpose was to address the paucity of research, specifically in the context of South Africa, addressing the personal and professional development literature of registered counselors in training. A qualitative research methodology was used to collect data, which was derived from 3 purposefully-spaced semi-structured interviews with 5 participants across their training year. Categories were identified through the process of open coding, resulting in the emergence of 3 themes – namely: the beginning <b>school</b> <b>counselor,</b> the practicing <b>school</b> <b>counselor</b> and the emerging helping professional - emphasising the process of <b>school</b> <b>counselor</b> development. It is evident from this study that a relation exists between that of the proposed theoretical model and the honours <b>school</b> <b>counselor</b> training programme in which the participants were involved. It is recommended that the honours <b>school</b> <b>counselor</b> training programme offered by the Department of Educational Psychology at the University of Johannesburg be refined, by acknowledging Skovholt and Ronnestad’s (1992) theoretical model, which emphasises the processes of counselor development. By documenting the training experiences of the participants in a <b>school</b> <b>counselor</b> programme, insight has been gained into the processes underway for a <b>school</b> <b>counselor</b> in training, as they develop in a personal and professional capacity...|$|R
