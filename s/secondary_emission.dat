It exploited the positive or negative electrostatic charge generated by displaying either a dash or a dot at any position on the CRT screen, a phenomenon known as <b>secondary</b> <b>emission.</b> A dash generated a positive charge, and a dot a negative charge, either of which could be picked up by a detector plate in front of the screen; a negative charge represented 0, and a positive charge1. The charge dissipated in about 0.2seconds, but it could be automatically refreshed from the data picked up by the detector.|$|E
25|$|The {{invention}} of the photomultiplier is predicated upon two prior achievements, the separate discoveries of the photoelectric effect and of <b>secondary</b> <b>emission.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{phenomenon}} of <b>secondary</b> <b>emission</b> (the ability of electrons {{in a vacuum}} tube to cause the emission of additional electrons by striking an electrode) was, at first, limited to purely electronic phenomena and devices (which lacked photosensitivity). In 1899 the effect was first reported by Villard. In 1902, Austin and Starke reported that the metal surfaces impacted by electron beams emitted {{a larger number of}} electrons than were incident. The application of the newly discovered <b>secondary</b> <b>emission</b> to the amplification of signals was only proposed after World War I by Westinghouse scientist Joseph Slepian in a 1919 patent.|$|E

The value of the <b>secondary</b> electron <b>emission</b> does not depend upon temperature. The effect of a gas film on the value of the <b>secondary</b> electron <b>emission</b> was detected...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the electron thermal collection, other processes that could influence the current collection in an EDT system are photoemission, <b>secondary</b> electron <b>emission,</b> and <b>secondary</b> ion <b>emission.</b> These effects pertain to all conducting surfaces on an EDT system, not just the end-body.|$|R

It suggests that secondary electrons would induce the transition. Furthermore, the phenomena which occur in the sheath regions are discussed in detail based on the simulation results.

25|$|The {{photomultiplier}} tube {{is an extremely}} sensitive detector of light, which uses the photoelectric effect and <b>secondary</b> <b>emission,</b> rather than thermionic emission, to generate and amplify electrical signals. Nuclear medicine imaging equipment and liquid scintillation counters use {{photomultiplier tube}} arrays to detect low-intensity scintillation due to ionizing radiation.|$|E
25|$|The {{machine was}} not {{intended}} to be a practical computer but was instead designed as a testbed for the Williams tube, the first random-access digital storage device. Invented by Freddie Williams and Tom Kilburn at the University of Manchester in 1946 and 1947, it was a cathode ray tube that used an effect called <b>secondary</b> <b>emission</b> to temporarily store electronic binary data, and was used successfully in several early computers.|$|E

25|$|When {{displaying}} fast one-shot events, {{the electron}} beam must deflect very quickly, with few electrons impinging on the screen, {{leading to a}} faint or invisible image on the display. Oscilloscope CRTs designed for very fast signals can give a brighter display by passing the electron beam through a micro-channel plate just before it reaches the screen. Through the phenomenon of <b>secondary</b> <b>emission,</b> this plate multiplies the number of electrons reaching the phosphor screen, giving a significant improvement in writing rate (brightness) and improved sensitivity and spot size as well.|$|E
25|$|Photomultipliers are {{typically}} constructed with an evacuated glass housing (using an extremely tight and durable glass-to-metal seal like other vacuum tubes), containing a photocathode, several dynodes, and an anode. Incident photons strike the photocathode material, {{which is usually}} a thin vapor-deposited conducting layer {{on the inside of}} the entry window of the device. Electrons are ejected from the surface as a consequence of the photoelectric effect. These electrons are directed by the focusing electrode toward the electron multiplier, where electrons are multiplied by the process of <b>secondary</b> <b>emission.</b>|$|E
25|$|These are {{extremely}} light-sensitive vacuum tubes with a photocathode coated onto part (an end or side) {{of the inside}} of the envelope. The photocathode contains combinations of materials such as caesium, rubidium and antimony specially selected to provide a low work function, so when illuminated even by very low levels of light, the photocathode readily releases electrons. By means of a series of electrodes (dynodes) at ever-higher potentials, these electrons are accelerated and substantially increased in number through <b>secondary</b> <b>emission</b> to provide a readily detectable output current. Photomultipliers are still commonly used wherever low levels of light must be detected.|$|E

An object, {{such as a}} small ball of glass or iron, placed {{in the path of}} cathode rays produces <b>secondary</b> <b>emissions</b> to the sides, flaring outwards in a manner reminiscent of a comet's tail. See the work of Hedenus for pictures and additional information.|$|R
25|$|The first {{documented}} photomultiplier demonstration {{dates to}} the early 1934 accomplishments of an RCA group based in Harrison, NJ. Harley Iams and Bernard Salzberg {{were the first to}} integrate a photoelectric-effect cathode and single <b>secondary</b> <b>emission</b> amplification stage in a single vacuum envelope and the first to characterize its performance as a photomultiplier with electron amplification gain. These accomplishments were finalized prior to June 1934 as detailed in the manuscript submitted to Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers (Proc. IRE). The device consisted of a semi-cylindrical photocathode, a secondary emitter mounted on the axis, and a collector grid surrounding the secondary emitter. The tube had a gain of about eight and operated at frequencies well above 10kHz.|$|E
25|$|The {{ingredients}} for inventing the photomultiplier were coming together during the 1920s as {{the pace of}} vacuum tube technology accelerated. The primary goal for many, if not most, workers was {{the need for a}} practical television camera technology. Television had been pursued with primitive prototypes for decades prior to the 1934 introduction of the first practical camera (the iconoscope). Early prototype television cameras lacked sensitivity. Photomultiplier technology was pursued to enable television camera tubes, such as the iconoscope and (later) the orthicon, to be sensitive enough to be practical. So the stage was set to combine the dual phenomena of photoemission (i.e., the photoelectric effect) with <b>secondary</b> <b>emission,</b> both of which had already been studied and adequately understood, to create a practical photomultiplier.|$|E
25|$|A {{photomultiplier}} is a phototube whose sensitivity {{is greatly}} increased {{through the use}} of electron multiplication. This works on the principle of <b>secondary</b> <b>emission,</b> whereby a single electron emitted by the photocathode strikes a special sort of anode known as a dynode causing more electrons to be released from that dynode. Those electrons are accelerated toward another dynode at a higher voltage, releasing more secondary electrons; as many as 15 such stages provide a huge amplification. Despite great advances in solid-state photodetectors, the single-photon detection capability of photomultiplier tubes makes this vacuum tube device excel in certain applications. Such a tube can also be used for detection of ionizing radiation {{as an alternative to the}} Geiger–Müller tube (itself not an actual vacuum tube). Historically, the image orthicon TV camera tube widely used in television studios prior to the development of modern CCD arrays also used multistage electron multiplication.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Atmospheric {{levels of}} 43 PCBs, 22 OCPs, and 14 PBDEs were {{determined}} in 16 cities at {{urban and rural}} sites by passive sampling to generate the first large-scale nationwide dataset of POP residues in Turkey's atmosphere. Sampling campaign was performed from May 2014 to April 2015 with three-month sampling periods at locations on east-west and north-south transects through the country to investigate seasonal and spatial variations, including long range atmospheric transport (LRAT). Factor analysis was conducted to infer on the potential sources. Overall average Σ 43 PCBs concentration was 108 ± 132 pg/m 3. PCB- 118 (26. 3 ± 44. 6 pg/m 3) was the top congener, and penta-CBs had the highest contribution with 54. 3 %. ΣDDTs had the highest annual mean concentration with 134 ± 296 pg/m 3 among the OCP groups among which the highest concentration compound was p'p-DDE (97. 6 ± 236 pg/m 3). Overall average concentration of Σ 14 PBDEs was 191 ± 329 pg/m 3 with the highest contribution from BDE- 190 (42 %). Comparison of OCPs and PCBs concentrations detected at temperatures which were above and below annual average temperature indicated higher concentrations in the warmer periods, hence significance of <b>secondary</b> <b>emissions</b> for several OCPs and Σ 43 PCBs, as well as inference as LRAT from <b>secondary</b> <b>emissions.</b> The first nationwide POPs database constructed in this study, point to current use, local <b>secondary</b> <b>emissions,</b> and LRAT for different individual compounds, and indicate the need for regular monitoring...|$|R

25|$|Higher {{gains were}} sought than those {{available}} from the early single-stage photomultipliers. However, it is an empirical fact that the yield of secondary electrons is limited in any given <b>secondary</b> <b>emission</b> process, regardless of acceleration voltage. Thus, any single-stage photomultiplier is limited in gain. At the time the maximum first-stage gain that could be achieved was approximately 10 (very significant developments in the 1960s permitted gains above 25 to be reached using negative electron affinity dynodes). For this reason, multiple-stage photomultipliers, in which the photoelectron yield could be multiplied successively in several stages, were an important goal. The challenge was to cause the photoelectrons to impinge on successively higher-voltage electrodes rather than to travel directly to the highest voltage electrode. Initially this challenge was overcome by using strong magnetic fields to bend the electrons' trajectories. Such a scheme had earlier been conceived by inventor J. Slepian by 1919 (see above). Accordingly, leading international research organizations turned their attention towards improving photomultiplers to achieve higher gain with multiple stages.|$|E
25|$|When a uranium nucleus fissions {{into two}} {{daughter}} nuclei fragments, about 0.1 {{percent of the}} mass of the uranium nucleus appears as the fission energy of ~200MeV. For uranium-235 (total mean fission energy 202.5MeV), typically ~169MeV appears as the kinetic energy of the daughter nuclei, which fly apart at about 3% of the speed of light, due to Coulomb repulsion. Also, an average of 2.5neutrons are emitted, with a mean kinetic energy per neutron of ~2MeV (total of 4.8MeV). The fission reaction also releases ~7MeV in prompt gamma ray photons. The latter figure means that a nuclear fission explosion or criticality accident emits about 3.5% of its energy as gamma rays, less than 2.5% of its energy as fast neutrons (total of both types of radiation ~ 6%), and the rest as kinetic energy of fission fragments (this appears almost immediately when the fragments impact surrounding matter, as simple heat). In an atomic bomb, this heat may serve to raise the temperature of the bomb core to 100million kelvin and cause <b>secondary</b> <b>emission</b> of soft X-rays, which convert some of this energy to ionizing radiation. However, in nuclear reactors, the fission fragment kinetic energy remains as low-temperature heat, which itself causes little or no ionization.|$|E

2500|$|However, the tetrode had one new problem. In any tube, {{electrons}} {{strike the}} anode with sufficient energy {{to cause the}} emission of electrons from its surface. In a triode this so-called <b>secondary</b> <b>emission</b> of electrons is not important since they are simply re-captured by the more positive anode (plate). But in a tetrode they can be captured by the screen grid (thus also acting as an anode) since it is also at a high voltage, thus robbing them from the plate current and reducing the amplification of the device. Since secondary electrons can outnumber the primary electrons, in the worst case, particularly as the plate voltage dips below the screen voltage, the plate current can decrease with increasing plate voltage. This is the so-called [...] "tetrode kink" [...] and {{is an example of}} negative resistance which can itself cause instability. The otherwise undesirable negative resistance was exploited to produce an extremely simple oscillator circuit only requiring connection of the plate to a resonant LC circuit to oscillate; this was effective over a wide frequency range. The so-called dynatron oscillator thus operated on the same principle of negative resistance as the tunnel diode oscillator many years later. Another undesirable consequence of <b>secondary</b> <b>emission</b> is that in extreme cases enough charge can flow to the screen grid to overheat and destroy it. Later tetrodes had anodes treated to reduce secondary emission; earlier ones such as the type 77 sharp-cutoff pentode connected as a tetrode made better dynatrons.|$|E
2500|$|One variant {{called a}} [...] "channel {{electron}} multiplier" [...] {{does not use}} individual dynodes but consists of a curved tube, such as a helix, coated on the inside with material with good <b>secondary</b> <b>emission.</b> One type had a funnel of sorts to capture the secondary electrons. The continuous dynode was resistive, and its ends were connected to enough voltage to create repeated cascades of electrons. The microchannel plate consists of an array of single stage electron multipliers over an image plane; several of these can then be stacked. This can be used, for instance, as an image intensifier in which the discrete channels substitute for focussing.|$|E

[...] The high energy of the beta particles gives rise to <b>secondary</b> <b>emission</b> of X-rays via Bremsstrahlung (braking radiation) in dense shielding materials such as lead.
