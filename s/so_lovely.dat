25|$|In 1972, Ralph Berry {{argued that}} Shakespeare was chiefly {{concerned}} with epistemology in this play. The lovers declare illusion to be reality, the actors declare reality to be illusion. The play ultimately reconciles the seemingly opposing views and vindicates imagination. Also in 1972, Thomas McFarland {{argued that the}} play is dominated by a mood of happiness {{and that it is}} one of the happiest literary creations ever produced. The mood is <b>so</b> <b>lovely</b> that the audience never feels fear or worry about the fate of the characters.|$|E
25|$|Bachelor Sanson Carrasco is seen {{covering}} a bookcase with wallpaper, while Antonina is putting some rusty old armour and a helmet made of pasteboard into a cupboard. Don Quixote de la Mancha enters, reading a book. He {{goes to the}} bookcase and, not finding it, believes it has been stolen by evil magicians. Then he settles into an armchair and continues reading. He delights in stories of brave knights, fabulous giants and other fantastical creatures, {{but most of all}} Don Quixote dreams of his beloved Dulcinea, a woman that he believes to be <b>so</b> <b>lovely</b> and noble that she must be divinity. Gradually he nods and falls asleep to dream of their romantic adventures. Darkness falls.|$|E

25|$|Esma Sultan, the {{daughter}} of Sultan Abdul Hamid I and aunt of Sultan Abdülmecid I, lived in luxury in her magnificent villa in Istanbul, but still her life passed in sadness because {{she could not have}} the one thing she wished for most; a child. At length she decided to adopt a child, {{the daughter}} of Gök Bey Gogen who belonged to one of the noble families of the Ubykh tribe of Circassia in the Ottoman Empire, after reaching satisfactory terms with the mother and father, when Rahime was a toddler one year of age. the child was particularly diminutive, delicate and graceful, so she renamed her Perestu, the Persian word for swallow. All the kalfas in Esma Sultan's villa behaved toward this child as though she were a daughter of an Ottoman imperial princess, and indeed her disposition and manners were <b>so</b> <b>lovely</b> that they became devoted to her. In the mean time Princess Esma Sultan carefully arranged the training and education of Perestu. She had three brothers, Mustafa, Hüseyn and Hasan Bey, and two sisters, Fatma Gülcemal Hanım and Mihrifidan Hanım.|$|E
500|$|In {{recent years}} historians have vigorously debated how {{political}} Verdi's operas were. In particular, the Chorus of the Hebrew Slaves (known as Va, pensiero) {{from the third}} act of the opera Nabucco {{was intended to be}} an anthem for Italian patriots, who were seeking to unify their country and free it from foreign control in the years up to 1861 (the chorus's theme of exiles singing about their homeland, and its lines such as O mia patria, si bella e perduta / [...] "O my country, <b>so</b> <b>lovely</b> and so lost" [...] were thought to have resonated with many Italians). Beginning in Naples in 1859 and spreading throughout Italy, the slogan [...] "Viva VERDI" [...] was used as an acronym for Viva Vittorio Emanuele Re D'Italia (Long live Victor Emmanuel King of Italy), referring to Victor Emmanuel II.|$|E
500|$|Well, I {{actually}} had the idea, I wrote {{the story about}} what it is actually like to be in the Service, and it does take a lot of physical strength, but now that I've been through it – and even just for the three days I was there, [...] a lot of mental strength. We used only Marines, no actors or actresses. We used all of the Marine's equipment and they were <b>so</b> <b>lovely</b> to us, I always have fun even though it's a lot of work. Even though I was sore and exhausted, I was so educated on people in the service, who I've always respected but the stuff they go through, and the kind of loyalty they possess, it's very communal, and community. Not to sound weird, but it seems like the heart of America. Seriously, the heart.|$|E

[...] Referring to his character's storyline as a hero's journey, Sbarge said the intention was to show that Jiminy Cricket did not just begin as a noble guy – [...] "what you get to see on this trip are the fire rings he had to walk through to get to a place where he could evolve to develop a sense of doing the right thing." [...] The episode featured guest stars Harry Groener and Carolyn Hennesy as Jiminy's parents Martin and Myrna. Groener had previously worked with Espenson in the third season of the fantasy television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It is their only appearances in the series.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a second}} paper {{presented}} in May 1914, Franck and Hertz {{reported on the}} light emission by the mercury atoms that had absorbed energy from collisions.

The relationship of energy and wavelength had also been predicted by Bohr. After a presentation of these results by Franck a few years later, Albert Einstein {{is said to have}} remarked, [...] "It's <b>so</b> <b>lovely</b> it makes you cry." ...|$|E

They married on December 5, 2003, in a ceremony at a hotel in Southern California. Paltrow and Martin have two children together: daughter Apple Blythe Alison Martin (b. 2004) and son Moses Bruce Anthony Martin (b. 2006).

2500|$|On 22 November 2012, a {{reporter}} for Channel 5 revealed that filming for the storyline had commenced during the week. Scenes were filmed at FremantleMedia Australia's Melbourne studios, {{as well as on}} location in Kangaroo Ground. The episodes were filmed over four days; the wedding ceremony and the reception scenes were shot in the first two days, with the explosion being shot on the third day and the aftermath on the fourth. Morey commented [...] "It was nice that it was all broken up, as it meant that we could actually enjoy the happy wedding part! It was <b>so</b> <b>lovely</b> filming it, so it was quite surreal to know that it was all going to explode later on!

2500|$|In a March 30, 2010 {{interview}} with Soap Opera Digest, Riegel explained why {{she decided to}} move on from the character: I had {{tried to make it}} work with All My Children. I don’t have a business head, so I don’t really make business decisions; every decision I make in my life is emotional and it was difficult to feel that the show wasn’t... that Bianca was getting lost. That who she was, was getting lost. I went back several times and they were <b>so</b> <b>lovely</b> to let me come back and play a character I love with the people I love so many times. But I felt that the people making the show didn’t really understand what Bianca was about anymore... It troubled me. I got letters from people to whom Bianca meant a great deal essentially saying, [...] "Please don’t come back. We can't take it anymore." ...|$|E

2500|$|Nebuchadnezzar in Caesarea (1980), about a {{performance}} of Giuseppe Verdi's opera Nabucco by the Deutsche Oper Berlin at the ancient Roman amphitheatre in Caesarea. The opera {{tells the story of}} Nebuchadnezzar, who destroyed the biblical Kingdom of Judah. It was performed in a theatre built by the Romans, who destroyed Judah's successor state, the Hasmonean kingdom of Judea, by the successor generation of Nazi Germany, which perpetrated the Holocaust against the Jewish people, successors of Judah and Judea, in their own, newly established homeland. The nationalist aria [...] "Va, pensiero!"—a highlight of the opera—had especial significance for the [...] audience. The line O mia patria, si bella e perduta ("O my country, <b>so</b> <b>lovely</b> and so lost"), sung by Jewish exiles, particularly resonated with the audience. In another poignant scene, the opera's German producer apologized to a group of Jewish extras for asking them to play Babylonians, while German performers played persecuted Jews.|$|E
