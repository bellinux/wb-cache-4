5000|$|Soon {{after the}} end of slavery, white {{planters}} encountered a labor shortage and sought a way to manage it. Although Blacks did not all abruptly stop working, they did try to work less. In particular, many sought to reduce their <b>Saturday</b> <b>work</b> hours, and women wanted to spend more time on child care. In the view of one contemporary economist, freed people exhibited this [...] "noncapitalist behavior" [...] because the condition of being owned had [...] "shielded the slaves from the market economy" [...] and they were therefore unable to perform [...] "careful calculation of economic opportunities." ...|$|E

5000|$|The Metropolitan Meat Market Company {{continued}} {{to operate the}} market until June 1974, a total of ninety four years. The Managing Director of the Company in its final years was J.M. (Malcolm) Howlett, who {{was the son of}} James M. Howlett, who with his brother John T. Howlett commenced work with William Reynolds in the 1880s. Malcolm Howlett has remained keenly interested in the market since it became a Craft Centre and has in his writings about it, given us a clear picture of what it was like. [...] "as {{to the use of the}} buildings as a wholesale Meat Market one must remember that it was designed for the use of horse-drawn vehicles. If you look at the stone kerbs in front of the stalls, you can see how they are worn down by the continual backing of the steel-tyred wheels of the lorries against them and although petrol driven trucks started to appear after 1914, it was a gradual change and I remember at least one horse drawn lorry still operating late in the 1940s. [...] The use of horses for transport meant that the market needed someone to see to [...] the orderly bringing in of the various lorries and carts as they arrived. In the busy early morning there would be many outside in the street awaiting their turn to [...] come in. This function was in the hands of the caretaker whose many duties included keeping the central area swept and clean as well as the opening and closing of the Market on time and responsibility to the company for the orderly running of the place. The builder engaged in the construction of the Market was a Mr. Launder [...] of Hawthorn and presumably it was his son, Thomas Launder, who [...] became the first caretaker. He not only filled the duties mentioned above but acted as Meat Inspector as well. It is interesting that Thomas Launder was succeeded in the post by his son Mr. Ern Launder, who in turn was followed by his son Mr. Jack Launder. Four generations of one [...] family covering one hundred years.” (When Jack Launder retired in March 1986 he turned the first sod to plant a Blackwood tree in the activities courtyard as a permanent reminder of his Families' contribution to the Market). “The Market opened at 5.00am every day including Saturdays until <b>Saturday</b> <b>work</b> was cut out. It was from 6 o'clock to 8 o'clock in the [...] morning that the market was at its busiest and a stranger would have been amazed at the crescendo of sound inside the building. The rattle and clatter of the lorries on the cobbled floor, the cries of the lumpers [...] calling the weights to the booking clerks, the bargaining between [...] salesmen and customers and not infrequently a violent argument ending in a fight. To a stranger quite deafening and crazy but the natural atmosphere to those who worked there. In later years [...] unfortunately, this atmosphere was lost. The advent of motor trucks [...] and the departure of the horse lorry, the increased turnover in labour [...] and the closing up of some of the smaller businesses caused much of the personality of the Market to go. Over the years, there was a gradual change in the firms, though many were there for long periods. Some of the names worth recording were - Reynolds, Ogden, Birtwistle, Mark Morris, Stone, Oldmeadow, Pridham, McAllister, Mehegan, [...] Howlett, Spillane, Laming, Borthwick and Brooklea. In the 1970s the market was facing a critical situation. Built 90 years before in the horse and cart era, the petrol driven vehicles having to load and unload inside the building with the exhaust fumes in close proximity to the meat in the stalls, health regulations demanded some means of separation and further refrigeration and with the space available to manoeuvre this was impossible. Eventually in 1974 the firms operating there either moved to other premises or closed up and the Market ceased as a Meat Market”.|$|E

40|$|It is {{the aim of}} {{the present}} study to assess factors {{associated}} with time spent in class among working college students. Eighty-two working students from 21 to 26 years old participated in this study. They were enrolled in an evening course of the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Participants answered a questionnaire on living and working conditions. During seven consecutive days, they wore an actigraph, filled out daily activity diaries (including time spent in classes) and the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale every three hours from waking until bedtime. Linear regression analyses were performed in order to assess the variables associated with time spent in classes. The results showed that gender, sleep length, excessive sleepiness, alcoholic beverage consumption (during workdays) and working hours were associated factors with time spent in class. Thus, those who spent less time in class were males, slept longer hours, reported excessive sleepiness on <b>Saturdays,</b> <b>worked</b> longer hours, and reported alcohol consumption. The combined effects of long work hours (> 40 h/week) and reduced sleep length may affect lifestyles and academic performance. Future studies should aim to look at adverse health effects induced by reduced sleep duration, even among working students who spent more time attending evening classes...|$|R
