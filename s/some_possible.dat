Their research led them to groups such as the Maharashtra Dyslexia Association and Parents for a Better Curriculum for the Child (PACE). Dyslexia eventually became the central topic and theme of the film. The pair worked with dyslexic children to research and develop the screenplay, basing characters and situations on their observations.

The hoard also contained two rare coins which had not been discovered in Britain before, and the largest number of silver denarii ever found in Britain.|$|E
5|$|The {{position}} of Balaur {{relative to other}} bird-like dinosaurs and early birds {{has been difficult to}} determine. The initial phylogenetic analysis placed Balaur bondoc closest to the Asiatic mainland dromaeosaurid species Velociraptor mongoliensis. A 2013 study by Brusatte and colleagues, using {{a modified version of the}} same data, found it in an unresolved close relationship with the dromaeosaurids Deinonychus and Adasaurus, with <b>some</b> <b>possible</b> alternative trees suggesting it branched off before the common ancestor of Deinonychus and Velociraptor, while others maintained it as the closest relative of Velociraptor, with Adasaurus as their next closest relative.|$|E
5|$|Both the Rodrigues {{solitaire}} and the dodo are now extinct. A common {{threshold of}} the extinction of the dodo is 1662, but <b>some</b> <b>possible</b> sightings had been made as late as 1688. The last sighting with a description was in 1662, but a statistical analysis by Roberts and Solow found that the extinction of the dodo was in 1693. The Rodrigues solitaire was killed off later than the dodo. The IUCN uses an extinction date of 1778 for the solitaire, although a more probable date {{would be in the}} 1750s or 1760s. Both birds became extinct as a consequence of human hunting and the introduction of mammals that ate the birds and their eggs.|$|E

A single mf1 from the Allen Formation (Late Cretaceous of Argentina) was described as another ferugliotheriid genus, Trapalcotherium, in 2009.|$|E
