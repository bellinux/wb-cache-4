5|$|Edward's {{difficulties}} were {{exacerbated by}} prolonged problems in English agriculture, {{part of a}} wider phenomenon in northern Europe known as the Great Famine.

The theological developments of Edward's reign provided a vital source of reference for Elizabeth's religious policies, though the internationalism of the Edwardian Reformation was never revived.|$|E
