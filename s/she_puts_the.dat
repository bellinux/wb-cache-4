5|$|The video {{starts at}} the Clarksons' household. There, {{she and her husband}} are engaged in a heated {{argument}} and he threatens to smash down a picture of the family at one point. Time freezes still and her husband becomes immobile; Clarkson, however, is immune to this. Looking around her house, she sees her younger self. Hand in hand, the younger and older versions of Clarkson relive her troubled childhood as various painful memories are seen, such as the younger Clarkson making a picture for her father who tosses it into the sink while talking on the phone, and Clarkson's mother making an unappreciated dinner for her father as <b>she</b> <b>puts</b> <b>the</b> father's dinner into the bin. These events drive her mother to the point of taking pills before closing the door in the younger Clarkson's face, so that she doesn't see her starting to cry. The breaking point is finally seen when Clarkson's parents have a physical fight and throw objects at each other. Soon after, Clarkson's father packs his bags and leaves despite the younger Clarkson's pleas for him to stay. The older Clarkson runs back in time to the present, and instead of fighting with her husband, they make up. They then see that their daughter in the video had seen them fight, and they embrace her and each other. Throughout the music video, Clarkson is shown singing on the front porch, her mother's bed and a room full of mirrors, reflecting an image of her younger self. Note that Kelly is holding Kennedy's hand in the scene where the childhood memories are revealed.|$|E

She is popular with everyone, she is an honour student, is quick in her movements, is a good cook, and is sweet-tempered. <b>She</b> <b>puts</b> <b>the</b> brakes on Erika Kiriya once in a while, for Erika tends to go her own way without {{consulting}} anyone.

25|$|Several {{months after}} her presumed death, Ryan {{receives}} a champagne flute from Greenlee. Realizing {{that no one ever}} actually identified the body, he comes to believe that Greenlee is still alive. In November 2009, Ryan discovers Greenlee's medical records on David's computer, who claims he was using them for research into Amanda Dillon's pregnancy. It is later revealed that David has been keeping Greenlee in Massachusetts while she recovers. Greenlee has been comatose for the past year and has no memory of the accident. Upon her awakening, David tells Greenlee that she is paralyzed and if she does not have surgery to fix her spine, she will remain paralyzed {{for the rest of her}} life. She tells David that she wants to do the surgery, but if she dies during surgery, not to tell anybody that she was alive before her death. After successfully recovering from her injuries, Greenlee attempts to visit Ryan but is surprised to see him having sex with Erica Kane. Out for revenge, Greenlee asks David to bring her a hard-drive hidden in Ryan's house. <b>She</b> <b>puts</b> <b>the</b> hard-drive into Fusion's computer and it crashes all the files. Even with Fusion's files being lost, Erica is set out to build Fusion back up once again; during an interview, she tells reporters that whoever crashed Fusion's computers has not destroyed the company. Greenlee feels that she has not done enough and decides to stay in Pine Valley. Greenlee asks David to marry her, hoping that when she walks down the aisle at her wedding, everyone will be surprised, and that Ryan will be hurt.|$|E

500|$|TV Guide Adam Bryant {{called the}} scene with the bear [...] "one of the funniest moments on TV that week". Bryant also praised the story arc between Torres and Robbins, adding: [...] "I really like how honest Arizona is with Callie, and the way <b>she</b> <b>puts</b> <b>the</b> firecracker in her place." [...] He was {{positive}} of Leigh's performance, writing: [...] "Chyler Leigh gave a powerful performance in this episode. Her speech to Meredith was a little overwritten, but she almost made you forget that with her emotion. And the bond that is growing between Lexie and Meredith is nice to see. From Meredith finally saying out loud how she feels about Lexie, to Lexie being at Mer's side when she wakes up, I am really glad to see these sisters' happy." [...] Michael Pascua of The Huffington Post gave a positive review of the episode, commenting: [...] "I love how Grey's Anatomy can bounce between serious and hysterical moments. Old people wanting penile implants, bears attacking a groggy Alex, counterbalanced with Mercy West drama, Cristina being ignored, and Lexie's father arriving at the hospital hacking blood." [...] Pascua also praised the writing of Waite's character's storyline and Leigh's performance.|$|E

500|$|Though {{a modern}} {{synopsis}} {{has not been}} published, the original synopsis was published in The Moving Picture World on December 3, 1910. It states: [...] "Captain Smith sails away on his vessel for a trip around South America, through the Pacific, leaving behind him his wife and little girl, whom he dearly loves. The ship is reported lost with all on board, {{with the exception of}} a cabin boy who is picked up in mid ocean. The captain's wife struggles to support her child, but owing to a rapidly failing health she fights a losing battle with poverty. One by one her valued possessions find their way to the pawnshop, where the kind-hearted old pawnbroker, Levy, becomes interested in the sad-faced woman and pretty child, who never seem able to redeem any of their possessions. The last article of value left in Mrs. Smith's possession is her wedding ring, and Levy refuses to take this. Instead he offers her help, which the widow proudly refuses. She insists that she can go out and get work. Levy, seeing that he can help in no other way, offers to care for little Marie, and to this the mother finally gives her consent. Half in jest, Levy gives the mother a pawn ticket for the little girl, which he fills out to read that 'a precious jewel, a value beyond price,' has been left with him and can be redeemed 'at any time.' The mother leaves the little one in Levy's care and upon reaching home and finding herself mortally stricken, <b>she</b> <b>puts</b> <b>the</b> pawn ticket he has given her in an envelope which she entrusts to a friendly janitoress, to be given into no other hands than those of her husband should it be that he is not dead.|$|E
2500|$|Anna (Elizabeth Lail) {{arrives at}} Rumplestiltskin's (Robert Carlyle) tower {{and talks to}} him about the {{disappearance}} of her parents. Rumplestiltskin offers to help if <b>she</b> <b>puts</b> <b>the</b> contents of a vial into the Apprentice's drink telling her that he is an evil man. Anna states that she will do [...] "whatever it takes" [...] to find out why her parents visited The Enchanted Forest and Rumplestiltskin comments that he loves when people say they will do whatever it takes. Anna goes to the man's house and after a brief conversation she has a chance to put the vial's contents into his tea but instead decides to throw them into the fire thinking that it is poison. Anna arrives back at Rumplestiltskin's tower and informs him that she gave the contents of the vial to the Apprentice. Mr. Gold says that is good because it is an antidote to a poison he was given yesterday. Anna, horrified by this, tells Rumplestiltskin the truth and says they must go back to the cottage. They look in Rumplestiltskin's crystal ball and see the man succumbing to the poison by turning into a mouse.|$|E
