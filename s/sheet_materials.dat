40|$|In {{sheet metal}} forming (SMF) of {{materials}} such as stainless steels {{there is a major}} problem with transfer and accumulation of <b>sheet</b> <b>material</b> to the metal forming tool surface. The problem is known as galling; a kind of severe adhesive wear, which results in severe scratching of produced parts. In this thesis, galling observed in contacts between tool steels and stainless steel sheets under lubricated sliding conditions was studied, focusing on the early stage of galling. It was found that changes in friction cannot be used as galling indicator in the early stage of galling because transfer and accumulation of <b>sheet</b> <b>material</b> happens even though friction is low and stable. The progression of galling is influenced by tool steel damage occurring around the tool steel hard phases caused by <b>sheet</b> <b>material</b> flow, which results in formation of wear-induced galling initiation sites. A correlation between the critical contact pressure to galling and <b>sheet</b> <b>material</b> proof stress was found. Galling happened at lower pressures for <b>sheet</b> <b>material</b> with lower proof stress possibly due to easier <b>sheet</b> <b>material</b> flow, resulting in quicker tool damage. Material transfer and tool steel damage were delayed for tool steels comprising homogenously distributed, small and high hard phases. Additionally, the galling resistance was higher for tool steels with higher hardness due to decreased tool steel damage. In a comparison between observations of the worn tool surfaces after wear tests and calculations in FEM it was found that material transfer did not take place at regions with highest contact pressures but at regions with highest plastic strains. The results obtained in this thesis indicate that tool steel damage and <b>sheet</b> <b>material</b> flow occurring in the contact during sliding are important factors influencing galling...|$|R

40|$|A study {{examining}} {{the effect of}} specimen configuration on the mechanical behaviour of self-piercing riveted, multi-layer joints in aluminium alloys was conducted. It has observed that the specimen configuration {{had a significant effect}} on the strength and failure mechanism of a self-piercing riveted multi-layer joint. During shear testing, when secondary bending was present interlock failure was observed, while in the absence of secondary bending, <b>sheet</b> <b>material</b> failure occurred. Interlock and <b>sheet</b> <b>material</b> failure modes were also observed in T-peel tests, where depending on the configuration, either substrate failure led to peeling the top sheet away from the rivet head, or interlock failure resulted in pulling the rivet out of the bottom sheet. In the cases where the <b>sheet</b> <b>material</b> failed, an increase in <b>sheet</b> <b>material</b> strength led to an increase in joint strength. Under identical setting conditions, joints with double shear and no secondary bending effect exhibited significantly higher shear strength and more energy absorption than joints in single shear.

40|$|The {{processes}} {{significantly affect}} {{the productivity of}} printing and packaging machines. The process of transporting the <b>sheet</b> <b>material</b> begins with its separation from the stack, move into the treatment zone and outputting to the receiving table. The aim of this work {{is to determine the}} possibility of pre-analytical method without the element to be contacted cutting <b>sheet</b> <b>material,</b> its transport and fixation in the cutting zone due to the vacuum chamber. The advantage is that the vacuum transport, that the <b>sheet</b> <b>material</b> does not operate mechanical strength. Also semi-products are not deformed or damaged actuators conveyors. Using the method without the element to be contacted trimming <b>sheet</b> <b>material</b> cutting tool eliminates contact with the contacting element. Since the blade is in contact directly with only semi-finished product that it can be assumed that its bluntness is minimized, and the streamlined design of the transport system greatly simplifies the implementation of the technological process of pruning. ??????????????? ???????? ??????????? ?????? ?? ?????????????????? ?????? ??????????????? ? ??????????? ?????. ??????? ??????????????? ????????? ????????? ?????????? ? ??? ????????? ?? ?????, ??????????? ? ???? ????????? ? ?????? ?? ???????? ????. ????? ?????? ?????? ???????? ??????????????? ????????????? ??????????? ??????????? ????????????? ??????? ??????? ????????? ?????????, ??? ??????????????? ? ???????? ? ???? ??????? ?? ???? ????????? ??????. ????????????? ????????? ??????????????? ???????? ??, ??? ?? ???????? ???????? ?? ????????? ???????????? ????, ??? ?????????? ???????? ??????????????? ????????. ????? ???? ????????????? ?? ????????????? ? ?? ???????????? ??????????????? ?????????? ?????????????. ????????????? ????????????? ??????? ??????? ????????? ????????? ????????? ??????? ???????? ??????????? ? ?????????????? ?????????. ????????? ?????? ???? ???????????? ??????????????? ?????? ? ??????????????, ?? ????? ????????????, ??? ??? ?????????? ???????? ? ????????, ? ????????????????? ??????????? ?????????????????? ??????? ??????????? ???????? ?????????? ???????????????? ???????? ???????...|$|R
