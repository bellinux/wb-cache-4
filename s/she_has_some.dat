Spitzer was unsure how to craft the scene, and eventually requested advice from the other series' writers. They decided that Jan would give a [...] "psychobabble" [...] response to Michael. Sitting on a panel of television writers at Northwestern University, Spitzer briefly described her reasoning, [...] "Jan’s nuts. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> <b>some</b> bad psychiatrist giving her bad advice."

[...] Orbit, who was working with Frost and Harry on an assignment, contacted them for collaborating with Madonna on [...] "Masterpiece". He had heard Frost's initial composition of the song and knew that Madonna would love it. According to Frost the theme explained to them was about bittersweet love and the hardships felt being in a relationship. Madonna, Frost and Harry sat together with this idea and brainstormed and came up with the lyrics and the melody. Over time, Madonna changed the structure of the song and the final version was ready for recording. Madonna recalled: ...|$|E

She's the same age as Primula, so they easily become friends. Sakura is Rin's and Kaede's childhood friend, they know each other since elementary school. That's why she knows about Rin's and Kaede's tragic past. Nadeshiko is Rin's homeroom teacher.

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from June 25, 1910. It states: [...] "Bill Raymond, a convict, sentenced to a long term, {{is on his way}} to prison, in custody of the sheriff. A little girl [...] is a passenger in the same train. She shows that she feels sorry for the man. He in turn appreciates her sympathy. The train is wrecked, and the sheriff, who is handcuffed to Bill, is killed. Bill takes the key of the handcuffs from the pocket of the dead man, frees himself, and is about to escape, when he notices that the little girl, abandoned by her nurse, is lying unconscious in the car, which is now on fire. The convict risks his life to save the child, and carries her out in his arms. He takes her to her nurse and is recognized by a policeman and taken in custody, his chance for freedom lost. The child, who is the daughter of the governor, although Bill does not know it, is restored to her parent.

500|$|Giving a {{partially}} negative {{review of the}} film was Joshua Rothkopf of Time Out New York, who said the [...] "movie has a centerfold sheen to it—and some lesbianic soft-core flirtation to match—as its plot dives deeply into Twilight-esque heavy-melo meltdown in the last act" [...] and that [...] "Cody throws one too many losses at Needy; the screenwriter loses her satiric way about halfway through. But for a while, this has real fangs". Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post said, [...] "There's a certain kooky, kinky fun to be had with Jennifer's Body" [...] but that [...] "dmittedly, this {{is the stuff of}} lurid adolescent distraction, not great cinema" [...] and [...] "is strictly a niche item but provides a goofy, campy bookend to Drag Me to Hell on the B-movie shelf. Watch it, forget it, move on". San Francisco Chronicle Peter Hartlaub stated, [...] "Enjoy the film for its witty dialogue and fun performances, but know that there isn't a single good scare. An episode of Murder, She Wrote has more thrills." [...] Hartlaub felt the film is not bad, is [...] "almost always pleasing" [...] and that Fox [...] "proves that <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>some</b> [...] range" [...] but [...] "the chances that it will be somebody else's pop culture reference 27 years from now are slim to none". Joe Neumaier of New York Daily News said, [...] "Fox merely needs to look either vacant or evil, which the Transformers boy-toy does spookily well" [...] but [...] "ords and story are still the lifeblood of a movie, and Jennifer's Body is filled like a Twinkie with half-fleshed-out ideas". Disagreeing with Fox's performance, Chicago Tribune's Michael Phillips called Fox [...] "a pretty bad actress" [...] who [...] "doesn't seem to get Cody's sense of humor. At all". He reasoned the [...] "movie's partially redeemed by Seyfried, who makes her character more than a repository for audience sympathy" [...] and [...] "her make-out scene with Fox is handled with more suspense and care than anything else in the movie".|$|E
