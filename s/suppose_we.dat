25|$|<b>Suppose</b> <b>we</b> {{are given}} a {{monotonic}} path, which may happen to cross the diagonal. The exceedance of the path is defined to be the number of vertical edges which lie above the diagonal. For example, in Figure 2, the edges lying above the diagonal are marked in red, so the exceedance of the path is 5.|$|E
25|$|The Meissner {{effect is}} {{distinct}} from this—it is the spontaneous expulsion which occurs during transition to superconductivity. <b>Suppose</b> <b>we</b> have a material in its normal state, containing a constant internal magnetic field. When the material is cooled below the critical temperature, we would observe the abrupt expulsion of the internal magnetic field, which we would not expect based on Lenz's law.|$|E

25|$|To show this, <b>suppose</b> <b>we</b> divide {{integers}} n by m (where m is nonzero). When long {{division is}} applied to the division of n by m, only m remainders are possible. If 0 appears as a remainder, the decimal expansion terminates. If 0 never occurs, then the algorithm can run at most m − 1 steps without using any remainder more than once. After that, a remainder must recur, and then the decimal expansion repeats.|$|E
25|$|But <b>suppose</b> <b>we</b> rename 0 and 1 to 1 and 0 respectively. Then {{it would}} still be Boolean algebra, and {{moreover}} operating on the same values. However it would not be identical to our original Boolean algebra because now we find ∨ behaving the way ∧ used to do and vice versa. So there are still some cosmetic differences to show that we've been fiddling with the notation, despite the fact that we're still using 0s and 1s.|$|E
25|$|Otherwise, <b>suppose</b> <b>we</b> have m vectors of n coordinates, with m<n. Then A is an n×m matrix and Λ is {{a column}} vector with m entries, {{and we are}} again {{interested}} in AΛ= 0. As we saw previously, this is equivalent {{to a list of}} n equations. Consider the first m rows of A, the first m equations; any solution of the full list of equations must also be true of the reduced list. In fact, if 〈i1,...,i'm〉 is any list of m rows, then the equation must be true for those rows.|$|E

25|$|For instance, <b>suppose</b> <b>we</b> wish {{to divide}} by the regular number 54 = 2133. 54 is a divisor of 603, and 603/54 = 4000, so {{dividing}} by 54 in sexagesimal {{can be accomplished}} by multiplying by 4000 and shifting three places. In sexagesimal 4000 = 13600 + 660 + 401, or (as listed by Joyce) 1:6:40. Thus, 1/54, in sexagesimal, is 1/60 + 6/602 + 40/603, also denoted 1:6:40 as Babylonian notational conventions did not specify the power of the starting digit. Conversely 1/4000 = 54/603, so division by 1:6:40 = 4000 {{can be accomplished by}} instead multiplying by 54 and shifting three sexagesimal places.|$|E
25|$|Example: <b>Suppose</b> <b>we</b> {{have six}} schools with populations of 150, 180, 200, 220, 260, and490 {{students}} respectively (total 1500 students), {{and we want}} to use student population as the basis for a PPS sample of size three. To do this, we could allocate the first school numbers 1to150, the second school 151 to 330(=150+180), the third school 331 to 530, and so on to the last school (1011 to1500). We then generate a random start between 1 and 500 (equal to1500/3) and count through the school populations by multiples of 500. If our random start was 137, we would select the schools which have been allocated numbers 137, 637, and1137, i.e. the first, fourth, and sixth schools.|$|E
25|$|The {{independent}} samples t-test is used when two separate sets of independent and identically distributed samples are obtained, one {{from each of}} the two populations being compared. For example, <b>suppose</b> <b>we</b> are evaluating the effect of a medical treatment, and we enroll 100subjects into our study, then randomly assign 50subjects to the treatment group and 50subjects to the control group. In this case, we have two {{independent samples}} and would use the unpaired form of the t-test. The randomization is not essential here – if we contacted 100people by phone and obtained each person's age and gender, and then used a two-sample t-test to see whether the mean ages differ by gender, this would also be an independent samples t-test, even though the data are observational.|$|E

25|$|For example, <b>suppose</b> <b>we</b> wish {{to sample}} {{people from a}} long street that starts in a poor area (house No. 1) and ends in an {{expensive}} district (house No. 1000). A simple random selection of addresses from this street could easily end up with too many from the high end and too few from the low end (or vice versa), leading to an unrepresentative sample. Selecting (e.g.) every 10th street number along the street ensures that the sample is spread evenly {{along the length of}} the street, representing all of these districts. (Note that if we always start at house #1 and end at #991, the sample is slightly biased towards the low end; by randomly selecting the start between #1 and #10, this bias is eliminated.|$|E
25|$|A vector e on a globe on {{the equator}} at point Q is {{directed}} to the north. <b>Suppose</b> <b>we</b> parallel transport the vector first along the equator until at point P and then (keeping it parallel to itself) drag it along a meridian to the pole N and (keeping the direction there) subsequently transport it along another meridian back to Q. Then we notice that the parallel-transported vector along a closed circuit does not return as the same vector; instead, it has another orientation. This would not happen in Euclidean space and {{is caused by the}} curvature of the surface of the globe. The same effect can be noticed if we drag the vector along an infinitesimally small closed surface subsequently along two directions and then back. The infinitesimal change of the vector {{is a measure of the}} curvature.|$|E
25|$|Light has an {{associated}} frequency, and this frequency {{may be used}} to drive the workings of a clock. The gravitational redshift leads to an important conclusion about time itself: Gravity makes time run slower. <b>Suppose</b> <b>we</b> build two identical clocks whose rates are controlled by some stable atomic transition. Place one clock on top of the tower, while the other clock remains on the ground. An experimenter on top of the tower observes that signals from the ground clock are lower in frequency than those of the clock next to her on the tower. Light going up the tower is a just a wave, and it is impossible for wave crests to disappear on the way up. Exactly as many oscillations of light arrive {{at the top of the}} tower as were emitted at the bottom. The experimenter concludes that the ground clock is running slow, and can confirm this by bringing the tower clock down to compare side-by-side with the ground clock. For a 1km tower, the discrepancy would amount to about 9.4nanoseconds per day, easily measurable with modern instrumentation.|$|E

25|$|Early {{evidence}} relating tobacco smoking to {{mortality and}} morbidity came from observational studies employing regression analysis. In {{order to reduce}} spurious correlations when analyzing observational data, researchers usually include several variables in their regression models {{in addition to the}} variable of primary interest. For example, <b>suppose</b> <b>we</b> have a regression model in which cigarette smoking is the independent variable of interest, and the dependent variable is lifespan measured in years. Researchers might include socio-economic status as an additional independent variable, to ensure that any observed effect of smoking on lifespan is not due to some effect of education or income. However, it is never possible to include all possible confounding variables in an empirical analysis. For example, a hypothetical gene might increase mortality and also cause people to smoke more. For this reason, randomized controlled trials are often able to generate more compelling evidence of causal relationships than can be obtained using regression analyses of observational data. When controlled experiments are not feasible, variants of regression analysis such as instrumental variables regression may be used to attempt to estimate causal relationships from observational data.|$|E
25|$|Even when {{a system}} is entirely {{isolated}} from external influences, its microstate is constantly changing. For instance, the particles in a gas are constantly moving, and thus occupy a different position at each moment of time; their momenta are also constantly changing as they collide with each other or with the container walls. <b>Suppose</b> <b>we</b> prepare the system in an artificially highly ordered equilibrium state. For instance, imagine dividing a container with a partition and placing a gas {{on one side of}} the partition, with a vacuum on the other side. If we remove the partition and watch the subsequent behavior of the gas, we will find that its microstate evolves according to some chaotic and unpredictable pattern, and that on average these microstates will correspond to a more disordered macrostate than before. It is possible, but extremely unlikely, for the gas molecules to bounce off one another in such a way that they remain in one half of the container. It is overwhelmingly probable for the gas to spread out to fill the container evenly, which is the new equilibrium macrostate of the system.|$|E
