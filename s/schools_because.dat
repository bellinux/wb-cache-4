5|$|Business school rankings are {{important}} to the various business <b>schools</b> <b>because</b> they are an important marketing tool used to recruit top students, and lure recruiters from the top companies. Business schools attempt to achieve higher rankings in order that they may obtain the top students who will over the course of their careers most likely benefit the school by achieving high ranking positions, attaining great influence, and accumulating great wealth. Such students often are able to help other students attain better (higher paying, more respected and more influential) jobs. Students use the rankings to choose their school, and creators of the rankings produce them to aid in this decision.|$|E
5|$|Horvath {{was born}} to Croatian {{immigrants}} in South Bend, Indiana in 1921; his family soon moved to Parma, Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland, Ohio. He attended Parma Senior High School starting in 1936 and played on the track, basketball and football teams until the 11th grade. He decided to switch <b>schools</b> <b>because</b> he felt his basketball teammates were not taking the sport seriously. Horvath's family relocated, and in 1938 he enrolled at James Ford Rhodes High School in Cleveland, one of Parma's rivals. Playing as a quarterback for the Rhodes Rams, Horvath guided the team to seven straight wins in 1938, but the team lost to West Technical High School {{for a chance to}} be the Cleveland Senate League's nomination to play in the city championship. He graduated in 1939.|$|E

25|$|When {{he was a}} child {{still living}} in Russian-occupied Poland, Rickover was not allowed to attend public <b>schools</b> <b>because</b> of his Jewish faith.

Following his formal education in the U.S., Admiral Rickover developed a decades-long and outspoken interest in the educational standards of the United States.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 1970s The Etobicoke Board of Education {{had gone through}} the process of closing over thirty <b>schools</b> <b>because</b> of a {{dramatic}} decline in enrolment, which dropped from 65,000 to fewer than 35,000 pupils. In spite of this, the senior staff felt compelled to resume innovative programs that had characterized the Board during the 1960s and 1970s. One idea had been talked about in the program department was a school for artistic students.|$|E

25|$|Benefits for universities. Admitting early {{decision}} applicants benefits <b>schools</b> <b>because</b> {{there is}} an almost certain probability that the admitted applicants will attend and, as a result, colleges can increase their yield by admitting them, and this can help a college improve its ranking. In addition, it helps admissions departments spread the work of sifting through applications throughout more of the school year. Generally counselors suggest this option is only for students who know with certainty that one particular college is their first choice.|$|E
25|$|A key {{turning point}} for braille {{literacy}} was {{the passage of the}} Rehabilitation Act of 1973, an act of Congress that moved thousands of children from specialized schools for the blind into mainstream public <b>schools.</b> <b>Because</b> {{only a small percentage of}} public schools could afford to train and hire braille-qualified teachers, braille literacy has declined since the law took effect. Braille literacy rates have improved slightly since the bill was passed, in part because of pressure from consumers and advocacy groups that has led 27 states to pass legislation mandating that children who are legally blind be given the opportunity to learn braille.|$|E

25|$|In a 1977 study, Fox {{compared}} the separation effects experienced by kibbutz children when {{removed from their}} mother, compared with removal from their caregiver (called a metapelet in Hebrew). He found that the child showed separation distress in both situations but, when reunited, children were significantly more attached to their mothers than to the metapelet. The children protested subsequent separation from their mothers when the metapelet was reintroduced to them. However, kibbutzim children shared high bonding with their parents as {{compared to those who}} were sent to boarding <b>schools,</b> <b>because</b> children in a kibbutz spent three to four hours with their parents every day.|$|E
25|$|Although {{religious}} education for children is officially forbidden by law in China, the Communist party allows Hui Muslims to violate this law {{and have their}} children educated in religion and attend Mosques while the law is enforced on Uyghurs. After secondary education is completed, China then allows Hui students {{who are willing to}} embark on religious studies under an Imam. China does not enforce the law against children attending Mosques on non-Uyghurs in areas outside of Xinjiang. Since the 1980s Islamic private schools (Sino-Arabic schools (中阿學校)) have been supported and permitted by the Chinese government among Muslim areas, only specifically excluding Xinjiang from allowing these <b>schools</b> <b>because</b> of separatist sentiment there.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, {{cultural}} wars arose over issues of prohibition and {{education in the}} United States. The Bennett Law was a highly controversial state law passed in Wisconsin in 1889 that required the use of English to teach major subjects in all public and private elementary and high <b>schools.</b> <b>Because</b> Wisconsin German Catholics and Lutherans each operated large numbers of parochial schools where German {{was used in the}} classroom, it was bitterly resented by German-American (and some Norwegian) communities. Although the law was ultimately repealed, there were significant political repercussions, with the Republicans losing the governorship and the legislature, and the election of Democrats to the Senate and House of Representatives.|$|E

The college was {{stripped}} of its accreditation Sept. 22 by Southern Association of Colleges and <b>Schools</b> <b>because</b> of ongoing financial and administrative problems. The school was notified in June that the association had recommended its removal from its list of approved members. The trustees appealed the decision and diligently worked to save the school - including launching a fund-raising campaign - but the appeal was not successful. Without accreditation, no federal or state funds were available to Sue Bennett students and the State of Kentucky withdrew the school's license to teach effective Nov. 26.|$|E
25|$|After the {{specific}} threat against children was delivered, many school groups curtailed field trips and outdoors athletic activities based upon safety concerns. At {{the height of}} the public fear, some school districts, such as Henrico County Public Schools and Hanover County Public Schools, after the Ponderosa shooting, simply closed school for the day. Other schools such as the MJBHA, cancelled all outdoor activities after the shooting at the Connecticut and Aspen Hill intersection. Others changed after-school procedures for parents to pick up their kids to minimize the amount of time children spent in the open. Extra police officers were placed in <b>schools</b> <b>because</b> of this fear. In addition to this, Joel Schumacher's film Phone Booth was deemed potentially upsetting enough that its release was delayed for months.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} two classes, despite the school’s title and function, only six of the first 23 {{graduates}} were field grade officers. A board reviewing all service schools of the United States Army observed that the Field Officers School had a course load that in other branches of the Army was distributed among several <b>schools.</b> <b>Because</b> all other Air Service schools were technical training in nature, the board recommended that the school be opened to all air service officers regardless of rank. Accordingly, Army regulations changed {{the name of the}} school to that of Air Service Tactical School on 8 November 1922. With the passage of the Air Corps Act of 1926, the school again changed its name, becoming the Air Corps Tactical School on 2 July 1926.|$|E
