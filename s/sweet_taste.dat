5|$|In winemaking, fruit sugars are {{converted}} into alcohol by a fermentation process. If the must formed by pressing the fruit {{has a low}} sugar content, additional sugar may be added to raise the alcohol content of the wine in a process called chaptalization. In the production of sweet wines, fermentation may be halted before it has run its full course, leaving behind some residual sugar that gives the wine its <b>sweet</b> <b>taste.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lactarius subdulcis has a mild {{taste with}} a {{slightly}} bitter after-taste. Though considered edible after cooking, it is not recommended, as it has a taste reminiscent of ivy. There {{are a number of}} other mushrooms that appear at the same time and in the same areas as L.subdulcis that are preferable to it, including L.mitissimus, meaning that L.subdulcis is not particularly useful as a foodstuff. The milk is one of distinguishing features, having a <b>sweet</b> <b>taste</b> that turns bitter in the mouth, with L.subdulcis being considered a sweet milk mushroom.|$|E
40|$|Sweet" {{smells and}} tastes are {{perceptually}} similar, and physiological data indicate some commonality of central processing. However, <b>sweet</b> <b>tastes</b> and <b>sweet</b> smells {{do not provide}} interchangeable contexts in psychophysical experiments. The same <b>sweet</b> <b>tastes</b> are perceived as less intense when stronger <b>sweet</b> <b>tastes</b> are present, and they are perceived as more intense when weaker <b>sweet</b> <b>tastes</b> are present, as with sweet smells. However, complementary sets of <b>sweet</b> <b>tastes</b> and smells (e. g., weak <b>sweet</b> <b>tastes,</b> strong <b>sweet</b> smells) do not eliminate these differential context effects (DCEs). The present experiments examined, first, whether DCEs between <b>sweet</b> <b>tastes</b> and smells arise because of differences between odors and tastes {{in the way that}} sweetness scales with intensity as concentration rises, and, second, whether DCEs may be smaller for <b>sweet</b> <b>tastes</b> and smells, when contrasted with <b>sweet</b> <b>tastes</b> and nonsweet smells. The findings were clear: DCEs were consistently present, suggesting they are independent of perceptual similarity. These results imply that DCEs are probably not psychological in origin or centrally based; rather, they may have a subcortical locus. 10 page(s...|$|R

M. limonia, known from the Netherlands, has a lemon-yellow cap and stem and more gills. Another species similar in appearance is M. metata, which has a <b>sweet</b> <b>taste.</b>|$|E
5|$|Beyonce has crafted her brand around {{embracing}} femininity {{and female}} sexuality. Although as Dr. Cheryl Thompson explains {{in her article}} “The <b>sweet</b> <b>taste</b> of lemonade: Beyonce serves up black feminist history most recent album,” Beyonce is only recently exploring the intersecting themes of feminism and black empowerment in her work. According to Thompson, Beyonce - like many other black female artists - has held back with her identity as a black woman {{for the sake of}} appealing to the masses. Like the SNL skit that pokes fun at white Beyonce fans that listened to “Lemonade” and realized {{for the first time that}} Beyonce is indeed a black woman, it is only very recently that the artist has transformed her feminist image into something more specific to the issues black women face. As Thompson explains, all of Beyonce’s previous albums were about feminism. “Lemonade” is about black feminism. The importance of having artistry like “Lemonade” in the mainstream is critical to examining the lived experiences of black women, and the racial and gender-based oppression that intersect to create a unique set of obstacles.|$|E
5|$|Ethylene glycol {{poisoning}} is {{a relatively}} common occurrence worldwide. Human poisoning often occurs in isolated cases, but may also occur in epidemics. Many cases of poisoning {{are the result of}} using ethylene glycol as a cheap substitute for alcohol or intentional ingestions in suicide attempts. Less commonly it {{has been used as a}} means of homicide. Children or animals may be exposed by accidental ingestion; children and animals often consume large amounts due to ethylene glycol having a <b>sweet</b> <b>taste.</b> In the United States there were 5816 cases reported to poison centers in 2002. Additionally, ethylene glycol was the most common chemical responsible for deaths reported by US poison centers in 2003. In Australia there were 17 cases reported to the Victorian poison center and 30 cases reported to the New South Wales poison center in 2007. However, these numbers may underestimate actual numbers because not all cases attributable to ethylene glycol are reported to poison control centers. Most deaths from ethylene glycol are intentional suicides; deaths in children due to unintentional ingestion are extremely rare.|$|E

5|$|Regarding Hall's fate, the {{official}} investigation that followed ruled {{the cause of}} death was apoplexy (an early term for stroke). Some of Hall's symptoms— partial paralysis, slurred speech, delirium— certainly fit that diagnosis. Indeed, the pains that Hall complained about down one side of his body, which he attributed to many years' huddling in an igloo, may have been due to a previous minor stroke. However, in 1968, Hall's biographer Chauncey C. Loomis, a professor at Dartmouth College, made an expedition to Greenland to exhume Hall's body. Because of the permafrost, Hall's body, flag shroud, clothing and coffin were remarkably well-preserved. Tests on tissue samples of bone, fingernails and hair showed that Hall had received large doses of arsenic in the last two weeks of his life. Arsenic poisoning appears consistent with the symptoms party members reported: stomach pains, vomiting, stupor, and mania. Arsenic can have a <b>sweet</b> <b>taste,</b> and Hall had complained that the coffee had tasted too sweet, and had burned his stomach. It also appears that at least three of the crew, Budington, Meyer, and Bessels, expressed relief at Hall's death and said that the expedition would be better off without him. In his book The Arctic Grail, Pierre Berton suggests that it is possible that Hall accidentally dosed himself with the poison, as arsenic was common in medical kits of the time. But it is considered more probable that he was murdered by one of the other members of the expedition, possibly Bessels, who was in nearly constant attendance of Hall. No charges were ever filed.|$|E

Children (n = 691) from five European countries were genotyped for the first variant site rs 713598 of the TAS 2 R 38 bitter receptor gene. Three-day dietary records were obtained yearly from one to six years of age. Foods were categorized in sweet and non-sweet-tasting. Mixed models were used to describe group differences in food and nutrient intake and BMI z-score over time. TAS 2 R 38 genotype was related to energy intake from <b>sweet</b> <b>tasting</b> foods: Children with PP and PA genotype consumed an average 83 kJ/d (95 % CI 21 to 146; p = 0. 009) more <b>sweet</b> <b>tasting</b> foods than children with AA genotype and a mean 56 kJ/d (95 % CI 15 to 98; p = 0. 007) more energy from energy dense sweet products. Intake of <b>sweet</b> <b>tasting</b> foods was lower in girls than boys and differed between countries. TAS 2 R 38 genotype {{was not associated with}} the intake of energy, macronutrients, sugar, single food groups and BMI z-score.

25|$|Milk {{contains}} {{several different}} carbohydrate including lactose, glucose, galactose, and other oligosaccharides. The lactose gives milk its <b>sweet</b> <b>taste</b> and contributes approximately 40% of whole cow's milk's calories. Lactose is a disaccharide composite of two simple sugars, glucose and galactose. Bovine milk averages 4.8% anhydrous lactose, which amounts to about 50% {{of the total}} solids of skimmed milk. Levels of lactose are dependent upon the type of milk as other carbohydrates can be present at higher concentrations that lactose in milks.|$|E
25|$|Ethylene glycol is {{moderately}} toxic, with an oral LDLo = 786mg/kg for humans. The major {{danger is}} due to its <b>sweet</b> <b>taste,</b> which can attract children and animals. Upon ingestion, ethylene glycol is oxidized to glycolic acid, which is, in turn, oxidized to oxalic acid, which is toxic. It and its toxic byproducts first affect the central nervous system, then the heart, and finally the kidneys. Ingestion of sufficient amounts can be fatal if untreated. Several deaths are recorded annually in the U.S. alone.|$|E
