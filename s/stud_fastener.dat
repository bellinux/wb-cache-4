40|$|Abstract. The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to provide the stiffness and strength characteristics for cold-formed steel stud walls stabilized by sheathing. The primary stability resistance is provided by translational (lateral) stiffness supplied at the fastener locations to the cold-formed steel studs. This paper separates the source of this translational stiffness into two parts: local and diaphragm. To analyze the local stiffness an experimental study consisting of small-scale stud-fastener-sheathing assemblies is conducted. In these tests sheathing type, stud spacing, fastener spacing, edge distance, environmental conditions, and construction flaws are all varied. The results provide characterization of the local stiffness and strength that is supplied as the fasteners bear and rotate in a stud-sheathing assembly. Results are sensitive to the design variables (<b>stud,</b> <b>fastener,</b> sheathing, spacing) as well as the environmental and construction conditions. Diaphragm stiffness develops as the sheathing itself undergoes shear, which also translates into a lateral resistance at the fastener locations. A simple analytical model for the translational stiffness supplied by the sheathing diaphragm action is proposed and validated. The importance of including both local and diaphragm stiffness is illustrated with a test on a full-scale cold-formed steel stud wall. For the first time, this paper provides a comprehensive bracing model for sheathing-braced stud walls which include both local and diaphragm stiffness. ...|$|E
50|$|The PLCE webbing {{system is}} {{produced}} from double-layered 1000 Denier internally rubberised Cordura Nylon, a long lasting and hard wearing fabric. Olive (OD/OG) webbing {{of the same}} material (1000 D) is being incorporated, along {{with a variety of}} hard wearing plastic fasteners (ITW Nexus), Hook and loop fasteners (Velcro) and anti-magnetic press <b>stud</b> <b>fasteners</b> (Pull the Dot).|$|R
5000|$|Treehouse {{attachment}} bolts or TABs are specialized bolts engineered for treehouse construction.Various models and trademarks exist, with {{names such as}} Garnier limbs (GLs); tree anchor bolts; artificial limbs; heavy limbs or hyper limbs (HLs); special tree <b>fastener</b> or <b>stud</b> tree <b>fastener</b> (STFs).|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} types are the screw, nut and bolt. Other, more {{specialized}} types, include captive threaded <b>fasteners,</b> <b>stud,</b> threaded inserts, and threaded rods.|$|R
50|$|Threaded Stud - A {{threaded}} <b>stud</b> is a <b>fastener</b> {{consisting of}} a shank portion which is driven into the base material (and is therefore not visible after fastening) and a threaded portion (which remains visible after the fastening). An object is then attached to the threaded portion with a nut. The most common thread sizes are 1/4-20, and 3/8-16.|$|R
50|$|Fire {{testing of}} drywall {{assemblies}} {{for the purpose}} of expanding national catalogues, such as the National Building Code of Canada, Germany's Part 4 of DIN4102 and its British cousin BS476, are a matter of routine research and development work in more than one nation and can be sponsored jointly by national authorities and representatives of the drywall industry. For example, the National Research Council of Canada routinely publishes such findings. The results are printed as approved designs {{in the back of the}} building code. Generally, exposure of drywall on a panel furnace removes the water and calcines the exposed drywall and also heats the <b>studs</b> and <b>fasteners</b> holding the drywall. This typically results in deflection of the assembly towards the fire, as that is the location where the sublimation occurs, which weakens the assembly, due to the fire influence.|$|R
5000|$|Pressurized {{walls are}} {{temporary}} walls built with reams of [...] " [...] (6 mm) to [...] " [...] (16 mm) sheet rock (plasterboard), metal 2 × 3s (approx. 5 × 7 cm) or 2 × 4s, or taped, plastered and compounded. Most installation companies utilize LATTICE strips of wood {{to cover the}} joints of the above drywall. After the frame-out process, 1" [...] (32 mm) sheet rock screws are used to attach the drywall to the pressurized 2×4s that contact the floor, the ceiling and {{the sides of the}} property's walls. In order to prevent structural or architectural damage, only T-nuts and leveling screw pads are used on those <b>studs.</b> No additional <b>fasteners</b> or adhesives are used to add stability to the frame work.|$|R
