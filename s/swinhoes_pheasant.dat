50|$|<b>Swinhoe's</b> <b>{{pheasant}}</b> (Lophura swinhoii), {{also known}} as the Taiwan blue pheasant, is a bird of the pheasant subfamily in the fowl family Phasianidae. It is endemic to Taiwan. Along with the Mikado pheasant and Taiwan blue magpie, two other Taiwan endemics, the <b>Swinhoe's</b> <b>pheasant</b> is sometimes considered an unofficial national symbol for Taiwan as it bears the colours of the national flag (red, white and blue).|$|R
50|$|<b>Swinhoe's</b> <b>pheasant</b> eats seeds, fruits, {{and some}} insects and other animal matter. Predators include the crested goshawk {{as well as}} civets and badgers.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Swinhoe's</b> <b>pheasant</b> {{is found}} in the {{mountains}} of central Taiwan, where it lives in primary broadleaf forest up to 2,300 meters in elevation.|$|R
50|$|Robert Swinhoe FRS (1 September 1836 - 28 October 1877) was an English {{biologist}} {{who worked as}} a Consul in Formosa. He discovered many Southeast Asian birds and several, such as <b>Swinhoe's</b> <b>pheasant,</b> are named after him.|$|R
50|$|The male <b>Swinhoe's</b> <b>pheasant</b> {{can grow}} up to 79 cm. He has a glossy blue-purple chest, belly and rump, white nape, red wattles, white tail feathers, and a white crest. The female is brown marked with yellow arrow-shaped spots and complex barring patterns, and has maroon outer rectrices. The {{juvenile}} male is dark blue with brown and yellow patterns on its wings. <b>Swinhoe's</b> <b>pheasants</b> can also be distinguished from the Mikado pheasant by having red legs.During display, the male's wattles become engorged and he performs a display consisting of a hop followed by running {{in a circle around}} females. A frontal display with the tail fanned is occasionally observed. He also does a wing-whirring display like other Lophura pheasants.|$|R
50|$|There {{are some}} rare animal species in Taiwan {{that are found}} no where else or {{otherwise}} in less numbers. Of particular note are: the <b>Swinhoe</b> <b>Pheasant</b> and the Mikado Pheasant, which are almost extinct in nearby regions. The Formosan rock macaque, a species of monkey, is found only in Taiwan.|$|R
50|$|The female lays {{a clutch}} of 2 to 6 eggs which are {{incubated}} for 25 to 28 days. The young can leave the nest at 2 to 3 days old. It is often assumed the <b>Swinhoe's</b> <b>pheasant</b> is polygynous, as males are often seen with several females, though information on this assertion is lacking.|$|R
25|$|The zoo {{sports a}} large {{collection}} of attractive birds, including some threatened species - large parrots including {{a number of}} macaw species, conures, lories and lorikeets; other large birds like touracos and hornbills; colourful game birds like the golden pheasant, Lady Amherst's <b>pheasant</b> and <b>Swinhoe's</b> <b>pheasant</b> and some large flightless birds like the emu, cassowary and ostrich.|$|R
5000|$|... 2007 saw {{the opening}} of an aviary near the zoo {{entrance}} containing roseate spoonbill, sacred ibis, and multiple species of waterfowl such as yellow-billed duck, Mandarin duck, paradise shelduck, ringed teal, common shelduck, rosybill and red-crested pochard. The aviary also houses golden pheasants, Lady Amherst's <b>pheasants</b> and <b>Swinhoe's</b> <b>pheasants.</b> Adjacent to the aviary is a flock of Chilean flamingos.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the country's industrialization, {{the mountainous}} areas held several endemic animal species and subspecies, {{such as the}} <b>Swinhoe's</b> <b>pheasant</b> (Lophura swinhoii), Taiwan blue magpie (Urocissa caerulea), the Formosan sika deer (Cervus nippon taiwanensis or Cervus nippon taiouanus) and the Formosan {{landlocked}} salmon (Oncorhynchus masou formosanus). A few of these are now extinct, and many others have been designated endangered species.|$|R
50|$|The Dasyueshan National Forest Recreation Area in Heping District, Taichung, {{contains}} {{a section of}} Dasyueshan, consisting of several shorter peaks, with Siaosyueshan (Little Snow Mountain) being the tallest at 2997m. Formerly a logging area, many of the affected areas have been reforested {{and it has become}} a popular scenic destination and birdwatching spot. Bird species seen here include the Mikado <b>pheasant,</b> <b>Swinhoe's</b> <b>pheasant,</b> and Taiwan partridge.|$|R
50|$|The Mikado {{pheasant}} (Syrmaticus mikado) is a gamebird in the pheasant family Phasianidae of {{the order}} Galliformes, gallinaceous birds. Sometimes considered an unofficial national bird of Taiwan (along with the <b>Swinhoe's</b> <b>pheasant</b> and Taiwan blue magpie), a pair of Mikado pheasants and Yushan National Park, {{one of the areas}} it is known to inhabit, is depicted in the 1000 dollar bill of the Taiwanese dollar.|$|R
25|$|The Pheasant Aviary {{is a long}} row of cages home to a large {{variety of}} bird species, {{particularly}} pheasants. Exhibited species include Elliot's pheasant, Lady Amherst's pheasant, Cabot's tragopan, blue eared-pheasant, mountain peacock-pheasant, MÃ©rida helmeted curassow (Pauxi pauxi pauxi), <b>Swinhoe's</b> <b>pheasant,</b> eastern loggerhead shrike (Lanius ludovicianus migrans), white-throated ground-dove, Lord Derby's parakeet, Montezuma oropendola, and yellow-crested cockatoo. Across from the exhibit is a large pond for Chilean flamingos and coscoroba swans.|$|R
50|$|Breeding {{groups of}} wild species of {{pheasants}} {{have been kept}} at Cobthorn for many years. These include the jungle fowl and gallopheasants, with breeding successes in <b>Swinhoe's</b> <b>pheasants</b> (Lophura swinhoii) in the 1960s leading {{to the establishment of}} a number of breeding populations, including at Bristol Zoo. Cobthorn Trust is engaged on a breeding programme to study the biology of the kalij pheasant (Lophura leucomelanos) and silver pheasant (Lophura nycthemera). The trust has also undertaken field studies of several pheasant species in their native habitats in Asia.|$|R
