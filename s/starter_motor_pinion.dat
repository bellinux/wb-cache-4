50|$|A {{starter ring}} gear, {{sometimes}} called a starter ring or ring gear, is a {{medium carbon steel}} ring with teeth that is fitted {{on the periphery of}} a flexplate or flywheel of an internal combustion engine, mostly for automotive or aircraft applications. The teeth of the starter ring are driven by the smaller gear (the pinion) of the starter motor. The primary function of the starter ring is to transfer torque from the <b>starter</b> <b>motor</b> <b>pinion</b> to the flywheel or flexplate to rotate the engine to begin the cycle.|$|E

40|$|In this study, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) {{software}} for real time condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of serial wound <b>starter</b> <b>motors</b> {{has been developed}} using Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) neural network. The <b>starter</b> <b>motors</b> are serial wound dc motors which enable the Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) to run. When the <b>starter</b> <b>motor</b> fault occurs, the ICE cannot be run. Therefore, condition monitoring and pre-diagnosis of <b>starter</b> <b>motor</b> faults are important. The information of voltages and currents is acquired from the <b>starter</b> <b>motor</b> via data acquisition card and transferred to the program. With this program using LVQ network, six faults observed in the <b>starter</b> <b>motors</b> were successfully detected and diagnosed in real time. The GUI software {{makes it possible to}} condition monitoring and diagnose the faults in <b>starter</b> <b>motors</b> before they occur by keeping fault records of the past occurrences. This system can be used in service shops and in test departments of <b>starter</b> <b>motor</b> manufacturers. In addition, this system has potential to be used for real time condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of vehicles with the help of industrial computers...|$|R

50|$|The <b>starter</b> <b>motor</b> is a series, compound, or {{permanent}} magnet type electric motor with a solenoid and solenoid operated switch mounted on it. When low-current {{power from the}} starting battery {{is applied to the}} starter solenoid, usually through a key-operated switch, the solenoid closes high-current contacts for the <b>starter</b> <b>motor</b> and it starts to run. Once the engine starts, the key-operated switch is opened and the solenoid opens the contacts to the <b>starter</b> <b>motor.</b>|$|R

50|$|Early KB Centuras also {{experienced}} quality issues with interior fixtures, with door trims cracking, and torn vinyl trim near stitching lines not uncommon. A story going around {{is that no}} Centura models were fitted with <b>starter</b> <b>motor</b> relays, which simply put the load onto the ignition switch when cranking instead, which reduced the ignition switch life in some cars.The <b>starter</b> <b>motor</b> relay {{is attached to the}} firewall above the <b>starter</b> <b>motor</b> in all models. Traction in wet weather proved to be poor, with an open differential, relatively large six-cylinder Hemi engine and very light weight over the rear wheels.|$|R
40|$|<b>Starter</b> <b>motors</b> are {{sensitive}} for overheating. By estimating {{the temperature and}} preventing cranking in time, there is an option to avoid the dangerous temperatures. The truck manufacturer Scania CV AB proposed a master thesis that should evaluate the need of an overheating protection for the <b>starter</b> <b>motor.</b> The aim is to evaluate any positive effects of implementing an algorithm that can estimate the brush temperature instead of using the available time constrain, which allows 35 seconds of cranking with a following 2 seconds delay, allowing the crank shaft to stop before a new start attempt is allowed. To achieve high load on the <b>starter</b> <b>motor</b> and high temperature in the brushes, tests were performed under − 20 o Celsius. Initial testing on truck, under normal temperatures, showed that the batteries could not run the <b>starter</b> <b>motor</b> long enough to reach high temperatures in the brushes. This {{is believed to be}} caused by the voltage drop between the batteries and the <b>starter</b> <b>motor,</b> causing the <b>starter</b> <b>motor</b> to run in an operating area it is not optimized for. There are several other problems which gives a higher load on the engine, for example oil viscosity, resulting in higher currents, but those are not mentioned in this report. Three different models are compared, Two State Model, Single State Model and a Time Constrained Model. Tests and verifications show that the Two State Model is superior when it comes to protecting the <b>starter</b> <b>motor</b> from overheating {{and at the same time}} maximizing the cranking time. The major difference between the Two State Model and the Single State Model are the cooling characteristics. In the Single State Model the brush temperature drops quickly to the outside temperature while in the Two State Model the brush temperature drops to a second state  temperature instead of the outside temperature. With the currently implemented time constrain it is possible to overheat the <b>starter</b> <b>motor.</b> The algorithms are optimized under cold conditions, due to problems in reaching high temperatures under warmer conditions...|$|R

50|$|Although the {{electric}} <b>starter</b> <b>motor</b> {{was to come}} to dominate the car market, in 1912 there were several competing types of starter, with the Adams, S.C.A.T. and Wolseley cars having direct air starters, and Sunbeam introducing an air <b>starter</b> <b>motor</b> with similar approach to that used for the Delco and Scott-Crossley electrical <b>starter</b> <b>motors</b> (i.e. engaging with a toothed ring on the flywheel). The Star and Adler cars had spring motors (sometimes referred to as clockwork motors), which used the energy stored in a spring driving through a reduction gear. If the car failed to start the starter handle {{could be used to}} wind up the spring for a further attempt.|$|R

50|$|Two {{types of}} {{electrical}} <b>starter</b> <b>motor</b> can be used, direct-cranking (to disengage as internal combustion engines) and starter-generator system (permanently engaged).|$|R
50|$|The huffer {{works by}} blowing {{compressed}} air via flexible hose to the aircraft's bleed air system. From there, the air flows via a pilot controlled valve to the engine's <b>starter</b> <b>motor.</b> The <b>starter</b> <b>motor</b> converts {{the energy of the}} moving air to rotational torque. The <b>starter</b> <b>motor</b> is linked via shaft to the N2 or core of the engine and spins the compressor and first stage turbine. Once there is enough air flowing through the compressor and the combustion chamber to light the engine, fuel in the form of vaporized kerosene starts flowing and an igniter similar to a spark plug ignites the fuel. Then fuel flow is increased to spin the engine up to its normal idle speed, at which point the engine is self-sustaining and no longer needs the support of the starter.|$|R
