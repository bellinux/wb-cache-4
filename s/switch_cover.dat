50|$|Splinter Cell: Conviction in 2010 {{introduced}} {{cover to}} cover movement, which allows player character Sam Fisher to quickly move between covers {{by looking at the}} next cover and pressing a button.

50|$|Gibson {{has since}} {{released}} a Michael Bloomfield Les Paul—replicating his 1959 Standard—in {{recognition of his}} impact on the blues genre, {{his role in the}} revived production of the guitar, and his influence on many other guitarists. Because the actual guitar had been unaccounted for so many years, Gibson relied on hundreds of photographs provided by Bloomfield's family to reproduce the guitar. The model comes in two configurations—a clean Vintage Original Specifications (VOS) version, with only Bloomfield's mismatched volume and tone control knobs, missing toggle <b>switch</b> <b>cover,</b> and kidney-shaped tuners replacing the Gibson originals indicating its inspiration and a faithful, process-aged reproduction of the guitar as it was when Bloomfield played it last, complete with the finish smudge below the bridge and various nicks and smudges elsewhere around the body.|$|E

Environments that enable a test designer to model a real complex software and to obtain test cases to validate such a software are mandatory in an automated test approach. This paper presents an environment, GTSC, which enables test sequences to be obtained from both Statechart-based and FSM-based behavioral models. The environment supports test case generation from some test methods for FSM, such as <b>switch</b> <b>cover,</b> DS and UIO methods, and also from some test criteria for Statecharts based on the SCCF family.

Copper oxide-to-copper <b>switching</b> <b>covered</b> a large dynamic range, from 85 % and 10 % photopic transmittance, with a coloration efficiency of about 32 cm 2 /C. Gradual {{deterioration of the}} switching range occurred over 20 to 100 cycles. This is tentatively ascribed to coarsening of the film and contact degradation caused by the 65 % volume change on conversion of Cu to Cu 2 O. Switching between the two copper oxides (which have similar volumes) was more stable and more efficient (CE = 60 cm 2 /C), but covered a smaller transmittance range (60 % to 44 % T). Due to their large electrochemical storage capacity and tolerance for alkaline electrolytes, these cathodically coloring films may be useful as counter electrodes for anodically coloring electrode films such as nickel oxide or metal hydrides...|$|R
