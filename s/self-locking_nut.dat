40|$|Devido ao crescimento do mercado automobilístico no país, evitar retrabalhos e reduzir custos torna-se extremamente importante para uma empresa ser cada vez mais competitiva no mercado. Este trabalho trata dois destes problemas: o alto índice de rejeições durante o aperto da porca autotravante no semi-eixo e o espanamento da rosca do parafuso da junta homocinética. O objetivo deste trabalho é reduzir os dois índices descritos. Foram {{realizadas}} análises geométricas nas roscas da porca com o auxílio de um projetor de perfil e os valores obtidos foram comparados com valores normalizados. Foram realizados, ainda, ensaios em amostras da porca e do parafuso; realizou-se ensaio de dureza Vickers nas peças para verificar se estão dentro do especificado em projeto, metalografia para analisar sua estrutura e análise química quantitativa para verificar o material que compõe as peças. Através dos ensaios realizados, verificou-se que existem melhorias que podem ser realizadas no processo produtivo da rosca devido às diferenças encontradas na altura de filete com a norma e, também, uma melhoria no controle da produção dos semi-eixos, devido às altas variações encontradas nas medições. Due to {{the growth}} of the automobile market in the country, avoiding rework and reducing costs is extremely important for a company to be increasingly competitive. This work deals with two of these problems: the high rate of rejections in the grip of the <b>self-locking</b> <b>nut</b> and the axle shaft, as well as the wear of the screw thread in the CV joint. The goal of this work is to reduce the two indices described. Geometric analysis were performed on the threads of the nut {{with the aid of a}} profile projector and through the comparison between the values obtained the standard values. The Vickers hardness test was conducted on the parts to verify if they are within its specification in the project, metallographic to examine its structure and quantitative chemical analysis, to certify the material that composes the parts. Through the tests, it was found that there are improvements that can be performed in the production process of the thread, due to differences in height with the standard fillet, and in the production control of semi-axes, due to high variations detected in the measurements...|$|E
5000|$|Authorities {{disagree}} on whether nyloc nuts should be reused. For example, Carroll Smith (Carroll Smith's Nuts, Bolts, Fasteners, and Plumbing Handbook) {{notes that the}} nylon insert is not damaged by installation and therefore they can be reused many times, and a Federal Aviation Administration Advisory Circular allows nuts to be reused if the prevailing torque is within specification. [...] However, an Air Force Technical Order requires replacement of <b>self-locking</b> <b>nuts</b> in critical areas. [...] Various specifications for aerospace-grade <b>self-locking</b> <b>nuts</b> require that the running torque be maintained {{after a number of}} cycles of assembly, but without preloading the fastener.|$|R
40|$|There the {{influence}} of construction of locking member in <b>self-locking</b> <b>nuts</b> on the joint strength has been studied. The specifications for the joints with self-tapping and thread-pressing-out screws have been ascertained, their strength characteristics have been determined. The hardening method of joints with sheet materials has been offered; the new type of lubricant to install the progressive fasteners has been developed. The study results have been brought in production of GAZ- 6611, GAZ- 4301 motor vehicles, of PAZ- 3205, LiAZ- 5256 busesAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R

Briefly, safetying is defined as: [...] "Securing by various means any nut, bolt, turnbuckle etc., on the aircraft so that vibration will not cause it to loosen during operation." [...] These practices are not a means of obtaining or maintaining torque, rather a safety device to prevent the disengagement of screws, nuts, bolts, snap rings, oil caps, drain cocks, valves, and parts. Three basic methods are used in safetying; safety-wire, cotter pins, and <b>self-locking</b> <b>nuts.</b> Retainer washers and pal nuts are also sometimes used.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two types}} of acorn nuts. One is low, or the {{standard}} acorn nut. The other is the high acorn nut. The high acorn nut is wider and higher and will protect extra long studs. There are also <b>self-locking</b> acorn <b>nuts</b> that have distorted threads in the hex area to create a tight friction fit to prevent the nut from vibrating loose.|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} this {{investigation}} was to evaluate Vespel for potential application on the Solid Rocket Booster to replace all-metal deformed <b>self-locking</b> <b>nuts</b> and anchor nuts and be used as self-locking elements for bolts and screws. The Vespel self-locking elements were tested for prevailing torque retention at room temperature, after heating to 450 F and exposure for 3 hr, breakaway torque at 450 F and for vibration at a level consistent with the maximum expected on the SRB at lift-off and reentry. The investigation revealed Vespel has properties that can provide a self-locking capability for threaded fasteners up to 450 F and it can be used in nuts and anchor nuts for installation on the SRB. Vespel elements in bolts did not meet all our SRB requirements for reuse, however, we have defined a design for Vespel elements in nuts/anchor nuts that fully meets all requirements. It is recommended that No. 1, 1 / 4 in. and 5 / 16 in. nuts/anchor nuts be procured for use on the SRB. This system will eliminate the galling problems now encountered and achieve a much higher reuse life than the present deformed nut design...|$|R
