50|$|The {{mentioned}} QZSS TKS {{technology is}} a novel satellite timekeeping system which does not require on-board atomic clocks as used by existing navigation satellite systems such as GPS, GLONASS or Galileo system.

This allows the system to operate optimally when satellites are {{in direct contact with}} the ground station, making it suitable for a system like the Japanese QZSS.

40|$|The remote {{synchronization}} system RESSOX {{is a novel}} {{concept for}} a GNSS time keeping system that does not require an on-board atomic clock. RESSOX has been presented {{as an alternative to}} the classic GPS scheme and was specifically designed for the Japanese augmentation system QZSS (Quasi-Zenith Satellite System). According to the RESSOX structure, QZSS satellites will carry light and inexpensive clocks that are remotely synchronized to a main atomic clock located in the master ground station. The positioning performance of the whole augmentation system is directly influenced by the quality of the <b>synchronization</b> <b>network.</b> Moreover, there are unavoidable events that could stress the behavior of the <b>synchronization</b> <b>network</b> or periods of time when the synchronization cannot be controlled. During these periods the <b>synchronization</b> <b>network</b> cannot be utilized, and satellite clocks will have to be on their own (free-run case). This paper presents an analysis of the positioning performance of the GPS plus QZSS positioning system when anomalies in the remote synchronization scheme occurs and the RESSOX cannot be employed. QZSS satellite on-board time reference and ground atomic clock de-synchronization failures are studied, recreated and their effects on the positioning are analyzed by means of a dedicated software simulator. ...|$|E

40|$|SDH {{networks}} are much used by telecommunication operators {{and they have}} to be well-synchronized in order to ensure reliable and high-quality transmissions. The main difficulties in correctly configuring a <b>synchronization</b> <b>network</b> with respect to the various construction constraints reside in the multiple configuration options and in the automatic reactions of equipments in case of failure. By selecting their synchronization source according to the priorities assigned to their input ports and the signal quality messages, equipments modify the <b>synchronization</b> <b>network</b> plan. The size of the network and the configuration complexity hardly let a network designer predict the way a network would react to a failure. The need to have a network as fault tolerant as possible, requires validating the correctness of a given configuration before deploying it on the operator's network. This paper presents a platform that helps in the design and the configuration of SDH synchronization networks. To determine the automatic reconfiguration of a network after failures, we have developed a model of the synchronization mechanisms of SDH equipments.
