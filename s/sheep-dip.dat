50|$|Secord's {{responsibilities}} as a one-man logistics and operations staff covered {{a wide range}} of duties. One of the first duties he assumed was defense of Lima Site 85. In early 1967, General Hunter Harris briefed Secord and Lair on the upgrading of the TACAN installation there with guidance radar. The location, nearly on the Lao border with northern Vietnam, would enable American strike aircraft to follow its radar beam to Hanoi or Vinh and drop their bombs blind, regardless of weather. Lair and Secord were tasked with defense of the site. Despite their best efforts, this site would be overrun in March 1968. Secord requested additional protection for the <b>sheep-dipped</b> technicians. Ambassador William H. Sullivan, who supervised the war in Laos by presidential directive, denied the need for stationing Green Berets at the site, or for personal weaponry. However, Secord insubordinately issued small arms to the onsite technicians for self-defense.|$|R

6000|$|... "'Oh, I wasn't {{thinking}} of them dudes and culls on the hoof,' says he. 'I was {{thinking of}} the time me and George put <b>sheep-dip</b> in Horsehead Johnson's whisky. I wish I was back in Atascosa City,' says he.|$|E
6000|$|Into a deep pond, an old <b>sheep-dip,</b> Dark, {{overgrown}} with willows, cool, with the brook [...] ebbing through so slow, Naked on the steep, soft lip Of the bank I stand watching my own white shadow [...] quivering to and fro.|$|E
6000|$|Like {{so many of}} his fellows--cultured moderns, {{alien to}} the larger forms of patriotism, that rich liquor brewed of maps and figures, {{commercial}} profit, and high-cockalorum, which served so perfectly to swell smaller heads--Felix had a love of his native land resembling love for a woman, a kind of sensuous chivalry, a passion based on her charm, on her tranquillity, on the power she had to draw him into her embrace, to make him feel that he had come from her, from her alone, and into her alone was going back. And this green parcel of his native land, from which the half of his blood came, and that the dearest half, had a potency over his spirit that he might well be ashamed of in days when the true Briton was a town-bred creature with a foot of fancy in all four corners of the globe. There was ever to him a special flavor about the elm-girt fields, the flowery coppices, of this country of the old Moretons, a special fascination in its full, white-clouded skies, its grass-edged roads, its pied and creamy cattle, and the blue-green loom of the Malvern hills. If God walked anywhere for him, it was surely here. Sentiment! Without sentiment, without that love, each for his own corner, 'the Land' was lost indeed! Not if all Becket blew trumpets till kingdom came, would 'the Land' be reformed, if they lost sight of that! To fortify men in love for their motherland, to see that insecurity, grinding poverty, interference, petty tyranny, could no longer undermine that love--this was to be, surely must be, done! Monotony? Was that cry true? What work now performed by humble men was less monotonous than work on the land? What work was even a tenth part so varied? Never quite the same from day to day: Now weeding, now hay, now roots, now hedging; now corn, with sowing, reaping, threshing, stacking, thatching; the care of beasts, and their companionship; <b>sheep-dipping,</b> shearing, wood-gathering, apple-picking, cider-making; fashioning and tarring gates; whitewashing walls; carting; trenching--never, never two days quite the same! Monotony! The poor devils in factories, in shops, in mines; poor devils driving 'busses, punching tickets, cleaning roads; baking; cooking; sewing; typing! Stokers; machine-tenders; brick-layers; dockers; clerks! Ah! that great company from towns might well cry out: Monotony! True, they got their holidays; true, they had more social life--a point that might well be raised at Becket: Holidays and social life for men on the soil! But--and suddenly Felix thought of the long, long holiday that was before the laborer Tryst. 'Twiddle his thumbs'--in the words of the little humanitarian--twiddle his thumbs in a space twelve feet by seven! No sky to see, no grass to smell, no beast to bear him company; no anything--for, what resources in himself had this poor creature? No anything, but to sit with tragic eyes fixed on the wall before him for eighty days and eighty nights, before they tried him. And then--not till then--would his punishment for that moment's blind revenge for grievous wrong begin! What on this earth of God's was more disproportioned, and wickedly extravagant, more crassly stupid, than the arrangements of his most perfect creature, man? What a devil was man, who could yet rise to such sublime heights of love and heroism! What a ferocious brute, the most ferocious and cold-blooded brute that lived! Of all creatures most to be stampeded by fear into a callous torturer! 'Fear'--thought Felix--'fear! Not momentary panic, such as makes our brother animals do foolish things; conscious, calculating fear, paralyzing the reason of our minds and the generosity of our hearts. A detestable thing Tryst has done, a hateful act; but his punishment will be twentyfold as hateful!' ...|$|R
60|$|This was {{spoken in}} a low tone, {{scarcely}} intended for Carley, but she had keen ears and heard distinctly. Not improbably this <b>sheep-dip</b> was what Flo meant as the worst to come. Carley adopted a listless posture to hide her keen desire to hear what Glenn would reply to Hutter.|$|E
60|$|Whereupon Carley felt mount in {{her breast}} an intense and rebellious {{determination}} {{to see a}} <b>sheep-dip.</b> She would astonish Glenn. What did he want, anyway? Had she not withstood the torturing trot of the hardest-gaited horse on the range? Carley realized {{she was going to}} place considerable store upon that feat. It grew on her.|$|E
6000|$|His {{pointing}} {{hand went}} southward until {{they saw the}} Africanders riding down to Windhuk. Two men, Boer farmers both, rode side by side and talked of the German officer they brought prisoner with them. He had put <b>sheep-dip</b> in the wells of drinking-water; his life was fairly forfeit, {{and he was not}} to be killed. [...] "We want no more hate in South Africa," [...] they agreed. [...] "Dutch and English and German must live here now side by side. Men cannot always be killing." ...|$|E
6000|$|At length the {{cut-over}} land {{ended in}} a forest of straggling pines, through which the road wound southward, and eventually down into a wide shallow canyon. Through the trees Carley saw a stream of water, open fields of green, log fences and cabins, and blue smoke. She heard the chug of a gasoline engine and the baa-baa of sheep. Glenn {{waited for her to}} catch up with him, and he said: [...] "Carley, this is one of Hutter's sheep camps. It's not a--a very pleasant place. You won't care to see the <b>sheep-dip.</b> So I'm suggesting you wait here--" ...|$|E
60|$|Morning {{disclosed}} {{the fact}} that gray clouds had been blown away. The sun shone bright upon a white-frosted land. The air was still. Carley labored at her task of rising, and brushing her hair, and pulling on her boots; and it appeared her former sufferings were as naught compared with the pangs of this morning. How she hated the cold, the bleak, denuded forest land, the emptiness, the roughness, the crudeness! If this sort of feeling grew any worse {{she thought she would}} hate Glenn. Yet she was nonetheless set upon going on, and seeing the <b>sheep-dip,</b> and riding that fiendish mustang until the trip was ended.|$|E
6000|$|... "But that Marilla {{girl was}} {{a benefit to}} the eye. And {{she was the most}} elegant kind of a housekeeper. I was the nearest neighbour, and I used to ride over to the Double-Elm {{anywhere}} from nine to sixteen times a week with fresh butter or a quarter of venison or a sample of new <b>sheep-dip</b> just as a frivolous excuse to see Marilla. Marilla and me got to be extensively inveigled with each other, and I was pretty sure I was going to get my rope around her neck and lead her over to the Lomito. Only she was so everlastingly permeated with filial sentiments toward old Cal that I never could get her to talk about serious matters.|$|E
60|$|The {{students}} {{work all day}} in the fields, the nurseries, and the shearing-sheds, learning and doing all the practical work of the business--three days in a week. On the other three they study and hear lectures. They are taught the beginnings of such sciences as bear upon agriculture--like chemistry, for instance. We saw the sophomore class in sheep-shearing shear a dozen sheep. They did it by hand, not with the machine. The sheep was seized and flung down on his side and held there; and the students took off his coat with great celerity and adroitness. Sometimes they clipped off {{a sample of the}} sheep, but that is customary with shearers, and they don't mind it; they don't even mind it as much as the sheep. They dab a splotch of <b>sheep-dip</b> on the place and go right ahead.|$|E
6000|$|And {{there were}} little villages, with neat {{stations}} well placarded with showy advertisements--mainly of almost too self-righteous brands of [...] "sheepdip." [...] If {{that is the}} name--and I think it is. It is a stuff like tar, and is dabbed on to places where the shearer clips a piece out of the sheep. It bars out the flies, and has healing properties, and a nip to it which makes the sheep skip like the cattle on a thousand hills. It is not good to eat. That is, {{it is not good}} to eat except when mixed with railroad coffee. It improves railroad coffee. Without it railroad coffee is too vague. But with it, it is quite assertive and enthusiastic. By itself, railroad coffee is too passive; but <b>sheep-dip</b> makes it wake up and get down to business. I wonder where they get railroad coffee? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then Glenn {{knocked him}} flat. You {{ought to have}} heard that crack. Sounded like Charley hitting a steer with a club. Dad yelled: 'Look out, Glenn. He packs a gun!'--Ruff got up mad clear through I reckon. Then they mixed it. Ruff got in some swings, but he couldn't reach Glenn's face. An' Glenn batted him right an' left, every time in his ugly mug. Ruff got all bloody an' he cussed {{something}} awful. Glenn beat him against the fence an' then we all saw Ruff reach for a gun or knife. All the men yelled. An' shore I screamed. But Glenn saw {{as much as we}} saw. He got fiercer. He beat Ruff down to his knees an' swung on him hard. Deliberately knocked Ruff into the dip ditch. What a splash! It wet all of us. Ruff went out of sight. Then he rolled up like a huge hog. We were all scared now. That dip's rank poison, you know. Reckon Ruff knew that. He floundered along an' crawled up at the end. Anyone could see that he had mouth an' eyes tight shut. He began to grope an' feel around, trying to find the way to the pond. One of the men led him out. It was great to see him wade in the water an' wallow an' souse his head under. When he came out the men got in front of him any stopped him. He shore looked bad.... An' Glenn called to him, 'Ruff, that <b>sheep-dip</b> won't go through your tough hide, but a bullet will!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know it. And the station-business doesn't {{pay for the}} <b>sheep-dip</b> to sanctify {{their coffee}} with. It's just as I say. And accommodating? Why, if you shake a rag the train will stop {{in the midst of}} the {{wilderness}} to pick you up. All that kind of politics costs, you see. And then, besides, any town that has a good many votes and wants a fine station, gets it. Don't you overlook that Maryborough station, if you take an interest in governmental curiosities. Why, you can put the whole population of Maryborough into it, and give them a sofa apiece, and have room for more. You haven't fifteen stations in America that are as big, and you probably haven't five that are half as fine. Why, it's perfectly elegant. And the clock! Everybody will show you the clock. There isn't a station in Europe that's got such a clock. It doesn't strike--and that's one mercy. It hasn't any bell; and as you'll have cause to remember, if you keep your reason, all Australia is simply bedamned with bells. On every quarter-hour, night and day, they jingle a tiresome chime of half a dozen notes--all the clocks in town at once, all the clocks in Australasia at once, and all the very same notes; first, downward scale: mi, re, do, sol--then upward scale: sol, si, re, do--down again: mi, re, do, sol--up again: sol, si, re, do--then the clock--say at midnight clang--clang--clang--clang--clang--clang--clang--clang--clang --clang--clang--clang----and, by that time you're--hello, what's all this excitement about? Oh I see--a runaway--scared by the train; why, you wouldn’t think this train could scare anything. Well, of course, when they build and run eighty stations at a loss and a lot of palace-stations and clocks like Maryborough's at another loss, the government has got to economize somewhere hasn't it? Very well look at the rolling stock. That's where they save the money. Why, that train from Maryborough will consist of eighteen freight-cars and two passenger-kennels; cheap, poor, shabby, slovenly; no drinking water, no sanitary arrangements, every imaginable inconvenience; and slow?--oh, the gait of cold molasses; no air-brake, no springs, and they'll jolt your head off every time they start or stop. That's where they make their little economies, you see. They spend tons of money to house you palatially while you wait fifteen minutes for a train, then degrade you to six hours' convict-transportation to get the foolish outlay back. What a rational man really needs is discomfort while he's waiting, then his journey in a nice train would be a grateful change. But no, that would be common sense--and out of place in a government. And then, besides, they save in that other little detail, you know--repudiate their own tickets, and collect a poor little illegitimate extra shilling out of you for that twelve miles, and----" ...|$|E

This suggests that a village of that name existed long before the flooding of the valley. Over the years Woolley Moor has had a number of shops and a post office although these have been transformed into normal houses since the 1980s. There was also another public house named 'The New Napoleon' which closed for good after a period of uncertainty in the late noughts.|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the effect of}} biochar on the water-soluble arsenic (As) concentration {{and the extent of}} organochlorine degradation in a co-contaminated historic <b>sheep-dip</b> soil during a 180 -d glasshouse incubation experiment. Soil microbial activity, bacterial community and structure diversity were also investigated. Biochar made from willow feedstock (Salix sp) was pyrolysed at 350 or 550 °C and added to soil at rates of 10 g kg- 1 and 20 g kg- 1 (repre-senting 30 t ha- 1 and 60 t ha- 1). The isomers of hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) alpha-HCH and gamma-HCH (lindane), underwent 10 -fold and 4 -fold reductions in concentration as a function of biochar treatment. Biochar also resulted in a significant reduction in soil DDT lev-els (P < 0. 01), and increased the DDE:DDT ratio. Soil microbial activity was significantly in-creased (P < 0. 01) under all biochar treatments after 60 days of treatment compared to the control. 16 S amplicon sequencing revealed that biochar-amended soil contained more members of theChryseobacterium, Flavobacterium, Dyadobacter and Pseudomonadaceae which are known bioremediators of hydrocarbons.

40|$|Phosphorus (P) {{influences}} arsenic (As) {{mobility and}} bioavailability which {{depends on the}} charge components of soil. The objective {{of this study was}} to examine P–As interaction in variable-charge allophanic soils in relation to P-induced As mobilization and bioavailability. In this work, the effect of P on arsenate [As(V) ] adsorption and desorption was examined using a number of allophanic and non-allophanic soils which vary in their anion adsorption capacity. The effect of P on As uptake by Indian mustard (Brassica juncea L.) plants was examined using a solution culture, and a soil plant growth experiment involving two As-spiked allophanic and non-allophanic soils which vary in their anion adsorption capacity, and a field As-contaminated sheep dip soil. Arsenate adsorption increased with an increase in the anion adsorption capacity of soils. The addition of P resulted in an increase in As desorption, and the effect was more pronounced in the case of allophanic soil. In the case of both As-spiked soils and field contaminated <b>sheep-dip</b> soil, application of P increased the desorption of As, thereby increasing its bioavailability. The effect of P on As uptake was more pronounced in the high anion adsorbing allophanic than low adsorbing non-allophanic soil. In the case of solution culture, As phytoavailability decreased with increasing concentration of P which is attributed to the competition of P for As uptake by roots. While increasing P concentration in solution decreased the uptake of As, it facilitated the translocation of As from root to shoot. The net effect of P on As phytoavailability in soils depends on the extent of P-induced As mobilization in soils and P-induced competition for As uptake by roots. The P-induced mobilization of As could be employed in the phytoremediation of As-contaminated sites. However, care must be taken to minimize the leaching of As mobilized through the P-induced desorption, thereby resulting in groundwater and off site contamination...|$|E
