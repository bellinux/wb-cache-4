500|$|During {{the war of}} {{independence}} from Spain, anarchists joined others in the labor movement in distributing propaganda to Spanish soldiers, urging them not to oppose the separatists, and to join the anarchist cause. A few years previously, anarchists had embraced the ideas espoused by Spanish anarchists of organizing not just in unions, but also forming <b>specificly</b> anarchist groups to educate people and commit violent anti-state acts known as [...] "propaganda of the deed", which carried on into the war {{of independence}}. Anarchists placed bombs that blew up bridges and gas pipelines, {{and contributed to the}} failed separatist attempt to assassinate the colonial head Captain General Valeriano Weyler in 1896. This led to the government further repressing of anarchists, closing the Sociedad General de Trabajadores (which grew out of the Círculo), mass deportations of activists, and even the forbidding of the lectura in the workplace.|$|E

The band's {{following}} studio album, End of the Century, was their only record produced by Phil Spector and their most successful album commercially, peaking at 44 on the United States Billboard 200 and charting in six other countries. In 1981 they released Pleasant Dreams via producer Graham Gouldman, who, according to the album's critics, sparked {{a change in the}} Ramone's style of music, <b>specificly</b> their genre beginning to transform from more classic punk rock, surf punk, and British punk to a heavier punk rock, heavy metal, and acid rock. Subterranean Jungle, released in 1983, would be the band's final release to chart withing the top 100 of the Billboard 200, and was also the final release before firing Marky as drummer. Richie Ramone would be the band's new drummer for 1984's Too Tough to Die, which was produced by former drummer Tommy alongside Ed Stasium. While the album was a critically acclaimed for having similar characteristics to the band's earlier albums, their next release, Animal Boy (1986) was denounced for being too unspecific about their style, and venturing into such genres as rock, pop punk, new wave, and Britpop.|$|E
