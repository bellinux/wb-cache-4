After the departure of long-time drummer Bob Bryar in March 2010, the band released their fourth studio album, , in November that same year, to positive reviews. After the addition of touring keyboardist James Dewees in 2012 {{and the release of}} Conventional Weapons, a series of singles recorded in 2009, released over the course of five months, the band announced its break-up on March 22, 2013, one month after the final release in the Conventional Weapons series.

A tenth anniversary reissue of The Black Parade was released in September 2016 titled The Black Parade/Living with Ghosts.|$|E

His daughter Þorgerður recalls that she was once sent to a slaughterhouse to collect a specimen but arrived just as the workers were taking a lunch break: [...] "Someone asked, 'What's in the basket?' I had to say, 'I'm collecting a frozen goat penis.' After that I said, 'I will never collect for you again.'" [...] According to Sigurður, [...] "Collecting penises is like collecting anything. You can never <b>stop,</b> <b>you</b> can never catch up, you can always get a new one, a better one." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2006, Bono recounted another {{experience}} {{he had in}} El Salvador, where {{he had seen a}} body thrown from a van into the road. He remarked, [...] "People would just disappear. If you were part of the opposition, you might find an SUV with the windows blacked out parked outside your house.... If that didn't <b>stop</b> <b>you,</b> occasionally they would come in and take you and murder you; there would be no trial." [...] Bono understood the cause of the Madres and COMADRES and wanted to pay tribute to it. His experiences in Central America inspired the lyrics of [...] "Mothers of the Disappeared" [...] and another track from The Joshua Tree, [...] "Bullet the Blue Sky".|$|E
500|$|Although Kanye West has not {{contacted}} him, Frederickson {{was interviewed}} {{about the game}} by MTV's Hive, which said it is [...] "the best video game ever created based on a pop song and/or artist" [...] and compared it to other games based on the song [...] "Margaritaville" [...] and the band Grateful Dead—he described the interview [...] "unthinkably disproportionate to the interest of Kanye Zone"; it even verged into the discussion of a film adaptation. He was also a guest on the British video gaming radio show One Life Left. Luke Plunkett of Kotaku called the game a [...] "perversely addictive thing", and Complexs Jacob Moore said it is [...] "as basic as it can get, but that won't <b>stop</b> <b>you</b> from wasting hours of your day." [...] Metro dubbed Kanye Zone [...] "the dumbest game you will spend 20 minutes playing" [...] and [...] "a hilarious low impact game {{in the tradition of}} early Atari".|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} acclaim from critics. [...] James Montgomery of MTV News {{said of the}} song, [...] "there {{are moments}} on Stairs that <b>stop</b> <b>you</b> dead in your tracks, send shivers up your spine and make you go 'Whoa'... like the first four-and-a-half minutes of 'I Will Possess Your Heart,' a propulsive whirl of stalking bass line, spindly guitars and stabbing piano." [...] Will Hermes noted in Rolling Stone that the sense of menace in the song was [...] "playing against type for a guy with one of rock's purest voices—a vibrato-less, bell-clear high tenor whose choirboy quality only throws the darkness here into relief." [...] Blender Jonah Weiner concurred, stating [...] "it's a pleasant surprise to hear Gibbard inhabit such a self-consciously creepy role, rather than play the occasionally errant, essentially good-hearted boyfriend who soft-shoes through {{so many of his}} tales." [...] In 2011, Tyler Kane of Paste included the song in a list of [...] "the 25 creepiest songs about love".|$|E

500|$|In India, {{the film}} {{received}} mostly positive reviews from critics. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave 4.5 out of 5 stars, reporting [...] "On the whole, Dhoom 2 {{is a winner}} all the way. For Yash Raj, who've not only produced but also distributed the film, Dhoom 2 should emerge {{as one of the}} biggest hits of their career." [...] Rajesh Karkera of Rediff gave it three and a half stars out of five, calling it [...] "A complete roller-coaster ride which left me completely enthralled and exhausted. Sure, there are faults when you stop to think rationally. But that does not <b>stop</b> <b>you</b> from being dazzled by the film." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave it a three star rating, saying that Dhoom 2 is without doubt better than its predecessor, and that Hrithik Roshan is {{the heart and soul of}} the film. Vijay Venkataramanan of Planet Bollywood gave it seven out of ten stars; while complaining about flaws in the plot and Aishwarya Rai’s performance, he still called it a good adrenaline-pumping entertainer.|$|E
500|$|... "Drive" [...] {{received}} largely positive {{reviews from}} critics. Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club wrote positively of the episode, awarding it an A, and writing that the entry was [...] "a {{great example of}} the engine that keeps great television moving." [...] Handlen noted that {{the climax of the}} episode was [...] "as moving as it is suspenseful" [...] and drew parallels between Bryan Cranston's portrayal of Mr. Crump and his eventual portrayal of Walter White from Breaking Bad, noting that both illustrate the idea that [...] "you have to keep moving. If you <b>stop,</b> <b>you</b> die." [...] Review website IGN named it the ninth best standalone X-Files episode of the entire series and complimented the interaction between Crump and Mulder, writing [...] "it's the interplay between Mulder and Crump that makes this episode a standout. [...] Crump here is an antagonistic yet heartbreaking character, and as he and Mulder become unlikely allies in their 'drive,' 'Drive' in turn becomes a memorably scary X-Files episode [...] because of the perhaps most frightening element of the show's world ever: mankind itself, and the governments that supposedly protect us." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first song}} {{featured}} in the episode is [...] "Sugalumps." [...] This song is a parody of The Black Eyed Peas' hit [...] "My Humps" [...] which The Yale Herald wrote was based around the premise that [...] "balls are significantly more hilarious than boobs". In addition, the song was later described as a [...] "New Zealanders version of" [...] Kelis's [...] "Milkshake." [...] Bret briefly appears as The Prince of Parties, {{a reference to a}} song from the season one episode [...] "New Fans." [...] Dave sings his portion of the rap in a style very similar to the opening theme of the TV series The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. The second song {{featured in the}} episode is [...] "You Don't Have to Be a Prostitute." [...] In an interview with The A.V. Club, Jemaine explained that the song was inspired by The Police's hit single [...] "Roxanne". However, the duo wished to make a [...] "judgmental" [...] version that [...] "makes a lot of assumptions about the profession. Singing a song about prostitution, like 'I'll <b>stop</b> <b>you</b> from being a prostitute with this song'".|$|E

500|$|After {{the early}} {{release of the}} lyrics, it had {{garnered}} criticism from some Asian and Hispanic communities, including Latino groups MECha and Chicanos Unidos Arizona, claiming that the usage of the terms [...] "chola" [...] and [...] "orient" [...] was offensive and derogatory. In response to the lyrics, Robert Paul Reyes of Newsblaze.com stated that while he agreed with its pro-gay stance, he questioned {{the use of the}} term [...] "chola", asking, [...] "Are Latinos supposed to be grateful that a white superstar, born of privilege, included a racist shout out to our community? Not all Latino ladies are 'cholas' in the barrio, some of them are teachers, writers, engineers and nurses and doctors." [...] Radio stations in Malaysia chose to censor the part of the lyrics dealing with the acceptance of the LGBT community, due to censorship in the country of content that may be deemed offensive. In response, Gaga urged her Malaysian fans, who wanted the uncensored version to be played, to take action by stating: [...] "It is your job and it is your duty as young people to have your voices heard. You must do everything that you can if you want to be liberated by your society. You must call, you must not <b>stop,</b> <b>you</b> must protest peaceably." ...|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers also {{commented on}} the {{accompanying}} alternate reality game. Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times, praised the album and game concept as [...] "a total marriage of the pop and gamer aesthetics that unlocks the rusty cages {{of the music industry}} and solves some key problems facing rock music as its cultural dominance dissolves into dust." [...] In relation to the declining music industry, Joseph Jaffe of Brandweek commented that such [...] "mysterious marketing measures [...] are what's desperately needed to gain attention in this uncertain era of distribution dilemmas and sagging sales", also commending acts such as Nine Inch Nails and Radiohead for being [...] "more innovative than marketers". Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B+, comparing it to The X-Files and calling it [...] "A sci-fi concept album whose end-of-days, paranoia-drenched story line has been disseminated via the Internet". It also stated: [...] "Amid its carefully calibrated sonic assaults, Year Zero has a number of tracks that will <b>stop</b> <b>you</b> in yours. Sometimes, it's a matter of dropping the volume [...] Even his use of electronics has shifted to a new level [...] Is the truth in here? Dunno, but Reznor's claim that 'I got my violence in high def ultra-realism' sounds like gospel to us." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{his review}} of the single, for the NME, Derek Johnson admired McCartney's {{performance}} and the lyrics' [...] "pseudo-religious" [...] qualities. Although he considered that the melody paled beside some of the band's previous singles, Johnson added: [...] "As ever with The Beatles, this is a record to <b>stop</b> <b>you</b> dead in your tracks and compel you to listen attentively." [...] John Gabree of High Fidelity magazine found the lyrics [...] "dangerous politically", but viewed the song as possibly [...] "the best thing musically that McCartney has done".|$|E

[...] This prompted 380 complaints and the BBC apologised, saying that the character was simply reminding another character, former football hooligan Jase Dyer, that the actions of hooligans led to the fencing-in of football fans.
