50|$|To {{simplify the}} sealing issues, the plugnut, core, springs, <b>shading</b> <b>ring,</b> and other {{components}} are often {{exposed to the}} fluid, so they must be compatible as well. The requirements present some special problems. The core tube needs to be non-magnetic to pass the solenoid's field through to the plugnut and the core. The plugnut and core need a material with good magnetic properties such as iron, but iron is prone to corrosion. Stainless steels can be used because they come in both magnetic and non-magnetic varieties. For example, a solenoid valve might use 304 stainless steel for the body, 305 stainless steel for the core tube, 302 stainless steel for the springs, and 430 F stainless steel (a magnetic stainless steel) for the core and plugnut.|$|E

Global and reflected shortwave down-ward and upward longwave radiations were measured at the snow surface {{and at the top}} of a 30 m tower. Direct solar radiation was also measured at the snow surface. The spectral measurements of shortwave radiation divided into four wavelength regions were made. Sensitivity constants of the pyranometers used for the measurement of global and reflected radiations showed large deviation from the cosine law response at a low solar elevation. Field calibration of the pyranometers was made extensively and some realistic equation to derive the global radiation under a broken sky from several calibration factors was proposed. As for the longwave radiation measurements, the pyrgeometer was equipped with a simple <b>shading</b> <b>ring</b> in order to eliminate the heating effect of the hemispherical dome due to solar radiation. Diurnal and seasonal variations of radiation components are shown and those of the net radiation are also given. Daily totals of the net radiation remain negative even in the summer for the clear sky, on account of high albedo of the snow surface and large upward longwave radiation compared with the downward.

TAKAHASHI, Y. INOUE and K. NAGASAWA. Faculty of Horticulture, Chiba University, Matsudo, Japan. Tech. Bull. Fac. Hort. Chiba Univ., No. 19 : 13 - 21, 1971. The {{effects of}} shading of fruits {{including}} leaves and branches by different covering materials, time of <b>shading</b> and <b>ringing</b> together with <b>shading</b> on the physiological fruit drop in Diospyros kaki L. (cv. Hiratanenashi) were studied in 1968 and 1969. In the experimental years, the second peak of fruit drop in normal trees occurred on July 7 in 1968 and July 5 in 1969. Shading with aluminum corted vinyl film {{at the time}} of June drop accelerated fruit drop, occurring from June 25 to July 2 in 1968, the peak observed on June 28 being accelerated 9 days as compared with that of natural fruit drop on July 7. The shading by black polyethylene film at 5 different times during the period of June drop in 1969 increased the percentage of fruit drop. However, the time of drop peak in any of the shading treatment was not accelerated, the reason for this discrepancy between years might be due to the difference in the amounts of sunshine in 1968 and 1969. In 1969, the effects of the shading with aluminum foil combined with ringing below the fruits on the bearing shoots, ringing above and below the fruits without shading and without <b>shading</b> and <b>ringing</b> on the fruit drop were compared in order to know the role of carbohydrates in fruit drop. In this experiment, the 50 0 ropping occurred in order of plots of <b>ringing</b> without <b>shading,</b> <b>shading</b> with <b>ringing,</b> and without shadding and ringing. It {{is interesting to note that}} dropping in the <b>shading</b> with <b>ringing</b> plot started later and ended earier than that in the <b>ringing</b> without <b>shading</b> plot.

40|$|When a <b>shade</b> <b>ring</b> is used {{to shield}} a {{pyranometer}} from direct solar radiation, a correction to the measured diffuse radiation is necessary to account for diffuse radiation intercepted by the ring. A general analysis is developed to relate shade-ring corrections to the radiance distribution of diffuse radiation. The corrections are split into two components: a geometric component based on an isotropic sky and varying with shade-ring dimensions; and an anisotropy component, relatively independent of ring dimensions. Shade-ring corrections are calculated using mean distributions of the radiance of cloudless skies. Tables and figures are given for calculating these corrections as functions of latitude, ring dimensions and time of year.

40|$|In 2003, {{the artist}} Gabriel Orozco {{produced}} a sculpture entitled <b>Shade</b> Between <b>Rings</b> of Air for the 50 th Venice Biennial. The work was a full-scale replica of La Pensilina (1952), an architectural structure that {{functioned as a}} pergola, designed by the Italian architect Carlo Scarpa. Scarpa’s construction {{was part of his}} Sculpture Garden situated at the inner courtyard of the Italian Pavilion in Venice. La Pensilina, however, was itself deemed to be so sculptural that it proved difficult to exhibit other sculpture there, and as a result the project was abandoned soon after completion. Orozco’s <b>Shade</b> Between <b>Rings</b> of Air, described by the artist as a ‘platonic pavilion’, was fabricated in birch wood and placed in an interior space adjacent to the patio where La Pensilina was situated. It was presented thus in contrast to Scarpa’s concrete structure which stood outdoors like a modern ruin, already deteriorated by time and weather. <b>Shade</b> Between <b>Rings</b> of Air was subsequently exhibited in diverse sites and contexts as an independent sculpture, raising issues about site-specificity, cultural memory, and the dialectical relation between architecture and sculpture. This article explores, first, how Orozco’s work negotiates ideas related to architectural sculpture (and sculptural architecture), while drawing particular attention {{on the role of the}} replica and its spatiotemporal relation to the original architectural construction; and secondly, it examines how the artist internalizes with this work, aspects of modernist architecture and its often utopian aspirations, in order to recast his own identity as a sculptor at the turn of the twenty-first century...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Masters Diploma (Heavy Current)) [...] Cape Technikon, 1991 Linear {{induction}} motors {{are built}} for numerous applications. Their robustness, gearfree-link to the load {{and the fact}} that speed is not a function of the number of poles (as in round machines) are only a few advantages. As every single phase motor needs some starting aid, so does a linear induction drive. For round machines, capacitors or shaded poles are usually used. A capacitor can be damaged electrically, which is a rare occurrence for <b>shading</b> <b>rings.</b> A useful combination of these advantages is a linear induction motor which is gearless and uses the shaded pole principle as a starting aid. In order to simplify the designing process, a computer program (Fortran) was written. The main objective on the electrical side was to obtain low input power, high power factor and high efficiency. In order to find the performance curves, torque measurements were made. Although the principles of torque measurements are well known the device to measure torque for this machine was not available and had to be constructed...|$|R
5000|$|A {{shaded-pole}} motor {{is the original}} type of AC single-phase induction motor. A {{shaded-pole motor}} is a small squirrel-cage motor in which the auxiliary winding is composed of a copper ring or bar surrounding a portion of each pole. This auxiliary single-turn winding is called a shading coil. Currents induced in this coil by the magnetic field create a second electrical phase by delaying the phase of magnetic flux change for that pole (a shaded pole) enough to provide a 2-phase rotating magnetic field. The direction of rotation is from the unshaded side to the <b>shaded</b> (<b>ring)</b> side of the pole. [...] Since the phase angle between the shaded and unshaded sections is small, shaded pole motors produce only a small starting torque relative to torque at full speed. Shaded-pole motors of the asymmetrical type shown are only reversible via disassembly and flipping over the stator, though some similar-looking motors have small, switch-shortable auxiliary windings of thin wire instead of thick copper bars and can reverse electrically. Another method of electrical reversing involves four coils (two pairs of identical coils).|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) based solar-shade system, {{as part of a}} technically- and financially-viable multipurpose system to provide long-term solutions to global warming and the energy crisis is discussed. The proposed solar-shade and power system would be enabled by the {{development of}} a previously-proposed less-expensive, environment-friendly, space-elevator system to lift mass into space. The solar shades, even during their early deployment and growth in LEO, would provide benefits such as reduction of space-debris and depletion of the Van Allen radiation belts. The Terrestrial temperature profile has been approximated for each latitudinal zone with a one-dimensional model. A <b>shade</b> <b>ring</b> at an altitude of 2000 - 4000 km, consisting of thin-film mega panels totaling up to 4 % of the earths surface area (to block ~ 1 % of insolation), is proposed. The effects of such near-polar rings on the global temperature pattern has been examined using the simple model. Specific emphasis has been laid on this effect in the Polar Regions. One such proposed ring could reduce the peak summer temperature of the Polar Regions (80 - 90 degree latitude) by almost 3 K. The tilting of the solar-shades, to reduce their cooling effect at the poles and to increase it in the near-polar regions, is recommended. Comment: 11 pages, 6 figures Proc. of Int.
