5|$|Kristoff, meanwhile, {{expressed}} {{disappointment with}} his second-place finish and {{his failure to}} defend his 2014 title. He suggested that another rider in the final part of the race could have given a better result, as Paolini's tiredness after a long spell {{at the front of}} the race meant that Kristoff had to start his sprint too early. Michael Matthews's third-place finish was the most significant result of his career, but he too was disappointed at having fallen short, after feeling <b>strong</b> <b>on</b> the climb of the Poggio.|$|E

5|$|Michigan's {{line was}} <b>strong</b> <b>on</b> defense. The fullback was {{called upon to}} make a tackle only once in the entire season. In the final three games of the season, Michigan's defense allowed only seven first downs. Four of Michigan's opponents (Albion, Case, Beloit, and Indiana) never had {{possession}} of the ball in Michigan's territory. Only Northwestern and Buffalo moved the ball inside Michigan's 30-yard line, and those two instances came on penalties against Michigan for forward passes. Only one player {{was taken out of}} a game for injury, and he returned to practice the Monday after the Saturday game.|$|E
5|$|Samuelsson's primary {{offensive}} attribute is his shot. Rather {{than relying}} on stickhandling in the offensive zone, his primary tendency is to direct the puck towards the net, hoping for a rebound. Before becoming an offensive threat later in his career, he established himself first as a defensively responsible forward in the NHL, earning time on the penalty kill and against opposing team's top players. <b>Strong</b> <b>on</b> his skates, he is also noted to play aggressively, as well. As a result, Samuelsson {{is known as a}} versatile, two-way player.|$|E
5|$|On the hardwood, he was {{considered}} the consummate defensive center, noted for his unmatched defensive intensity, his stellar basketball IQ and his sheer will to win. Russell excelled at playing man-to-man defense, blocking shots, and grabbing defensive and offensive rebounds. Opponent Wilt Chamberlain said Russell's timing as a shot-blocker was unparalleled. Russell “was the smartest player ever {{to play the game}} ” according to Bill Bradley, Russell’s erstwhile Knicks opponent writing in 2009. He also could score with putbacks and made mid-air outlet passes to point guard Bob Cousy for easy fast break points. He also was known as a fine passer and pick-setter, featured a decent left-handed hook shot and finished <b>strong</b> <b>on</b> alley oops. However, on offense, Russell's output was limited. His NBA career personal averages show him to be an average scorer (15.1 points career average), a poor free throw shooter (56.1%), and average overall shooter from the field (44%, not exceptional for a center). In his 13 years, he averaged a relatively low 13.4 field goals attempted (normally, top scorers average 20 and more), illustrating that he was never {{the focal point of the}} Celtics offense, instead focusing on his tremendous defense.|$|E

25|$|At {{his most}} {{comfortable}} against pace bowling, Vermeulen was a back-foot player by inclination, particularly <b>strong</b> <b>on</b> the cut, pull and hook shots, {{although he was}} also a sweet timer of the ball through the covers.

25|$|In 13 {{first-class}} {{matches in}} 1876, he took 36 wickets {{at an average}} of 19.38, not particularly good given the generally poor pitches of the time.

25|$|Clinton chose U.S. Senator Al Gore (D-Tennessee) to be {{his running}} mate on July 9, 1992.

Gore did serve to balance the ticket in other ways, as he was perceived as <b>strong</b> <b>on</b> family values and environmental issues, while Clinton was not. Also, Gore's similarities to Clinton allowed him to push some of his key campaign themes, such as centrism and generational change.|$|E
