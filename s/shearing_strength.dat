The author had proposed method to estimate <b>shear</b> <b>strengths</b> of wood from measured withdrawal resistances of probes which are screwed into wood. In order to verify the accuracy of these estimated <b>shear</b> <b>strengths</b> by proposed methods, withdrawal resistance measurements and shear loading tests were conducted for wood. Single withdrawal resistance measurement was applied for wood specimens, and estimated <b>shear</b> <b>strengths</b> from withdrawal measurements were compared to the measured <b>shear</b> <b>strengths</b> by <b>shear</b> loading tests of wood. Correlation between the estimated <b>shear</b> <b>strengths</b> and measured <b>shear</b> <b>strengths</b> of specimens was reasonably good (R 2 = 0. 73). Multiple coaxial withdrawal resistance measurement which can provide distribution of <b>shear</b> <b>strengths</b> in cross-section of wood was also proposed. The average of estimated <b>shear</b> <b>strengths</b> by single withdrawal resistances was 7 percent {{less than that of}} measured <b>shear</b> <b>strengths.</b> The average of estimated <b>shear</b> <b>strength</b> by multiple coaxial withdrawal resistances was 3 percent greater than that of measured <b>shear</b> <b>strengths.</b> The single withdrawal measurements and multiple coaxial withdrawal resistances are available to estimate <b>shear</b> <b>strengths</b> of wood and <b>shear</b> <b>strength</b> distribution in the cross-section of wood.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The <b>shear</b> <b>strength</b> {{behavior}} of an unsaturated silty soil {{over the entire}} suction range was studied in this paper. In addition, the <b>shear</b> <b>strength</b> behavior was also studied following the drying and wetting path in the high suction range (i. e. 2, 000 to 30, 000 kPa). The {{results of the study}} show that the maximum <b>shear</b> <b>strength</b> value occurs approximately at the residual suction value. The <b>shear</b> <b>strength</b> contribution due to suction starts reducing at suction values greater than the residual suction value and reaches an approximately constant value in the residual zone of unsaturation (RZU). The <b>shear</b> <b>strength</b> value in the RZU is less than half the <b>shear</b> <b>strength</b> at residual suction value. Hysteresis effects were negligible with respect to the <b>shear</b> <b>strength</b> following both the drying and wetting path in the high suction range. An attempt was also made in this paper to predict the variation of <b>shear</b> <b>strength</b> with respect to suction using six equations that use the Soil-Water Characteristic Curve (SWCC) and the saturated <b>shear</b> <b>strength</b> parameters from the literature. However, none of the six prediction equations were able to provide reasonable comparisons with the measured <b>shear</b> <b>strength</b> values.
