5|$|Basically it’s {{just about}} having a throwdown {{out in the woods}} — that’s what we used to do in high school. I can’t {{honestly}} sit here and say that I do it much anymore, I’m getting too old, but it’s fun for me to <b>sing</b> <b>about</b> those times and the crazy stuff that I used to do, and the crazy stuff that I know somewhere, as we speak right now, kids are doing somewhere in somebody's field. I know you're tearing it up out there.|$|E

5|$|Cagney {{spent most}} of the next year on his farm, and went back to work only when Edward L. Alperson from Grand National Films, a newly established, {{independent}} studio, approached him to make movies for $100,000 a film and 10% of the profits. Cagney made two films for Grand National: Great Guy and Something to <b>Sing</b> <b>About.</b> He received good reviews for both, but overall the production quality was not up to Warner Bros. standards, and the films did not do well. A third film, Dynamite, was planned, but Grand National ran out of money.|$|E
5|$|At the Powhatan River, Smith, Rolfe, Percy, Walter, Larry, Robin, and Alice {{disembark}} from a barge as {{the chorus}} of soldiers and adventurers <b>sing</b> <b>about</b> the joy of reaching the shore. Larry, Walter, Alice (Walter’s wife), and Robin reminisce about love, and Robin admits to Larry his lustful feelings about Alice. Meanwhile, Nima is preparing a bridal gown for Pocahontas in the royal village of Werocomoco, but Pocahontas expresses displeasure about the arrangement her father made for her to marry Miami, a rival Indian prince. Smith is then attacked by a party of Indians, including Nantaquas, Pocahontas’s brother.

5|$|Committed {{to living}} the {{philosophy}} they <b>sing</b> <b>about,</b> {{the band members}} have each pursued careers apart from their lives as the superstars of Malagasy pop music. Most {{of the members of}} Mahaleo have also launched individual humanitarian projects, in addition to the cooperative they formed together in the 1980s to support the hand-made production of traditional musical instruments, and the Centre des informations de communication, d'animation, formation et d'éducation (CICAFE) rural development center they launched in 2000. As the years passed {{and the members of the}} band matured in their respective careers, they started to write songs more relevant to the difficult conditions of life of the Malagasy people and the underdeveloped state of the nation, addressing such topics as environmental conservation, poverty, education, and violence. Among their hits in this period are songs that address rural-urban flight, homesickness after moving abroad to find work, husbands who abandon their families, and the guilt of military personnel required to carry out repression against their compatriots.|$|E

5000|$|In [...] "Cleaning Windows," [...] Van Morrison <b>sings</b> <b>about</b> {{listening}} to Rodgers, {{but this is}} more likely to refer to Jimmy Rogers, the blues singer, as Morrison is <b>singing</b> <b>about</b> other blues singers in the same song, and does not mention any other Country and Western singers.|$|R
5000|$|The song {{is in the}} chanson style, and {{features}} Berry <b>singing</b> <b>about</b> the unexpectedness of a [...] "great love". As the song ends, however, she <b>sings</b> <b>about</b> the ending of such a love, but sings {{that it is not}} a bad thing if it is replaced by friendship.|$|R
5|$|The {{earliest}} Greek {{thought about}} poetry considered the theogonies {{to be the}} prototypical poetic genre—the prototypical mythos—and imputed almost magical powers to it. Orpheus, the archetypal poet, also was the archetypal singer of theogonies, which he uses to calm seas and storms in Apollonius' Argonautica, and to move the stony hearts of the underworld gods in his descent to Hades. When Hermes invents the lyre in the Homeric Hymn to Hermes, {{the first thing he}} does is <b>sing</b> <b>about</b> the birth of the gods. Hesiod's Theogony is not only the fullest surviving account of the gods, but also the fullest surviving account of the archaic poet's function, with its long preliminary invocation to the Muses. Theogony also was the subject of many lost poems, including those attributed to Orpheus, Musaeus, Epimenides, Abaris, and other legendary seers, which were used in private ritual purifications and mystery-rites. There are indications that Plato was familiar with some version of the Orphic theogony. A silence would have been expected about religious rites and beliefs, however, and that nature of the culture would not have been reported by members of the society while the beliefs were held. After they ceased to become religious beliefs, few would have known the rites and rituals. Allusions often existed, however, to aspects that were quite public.|$|E

It's a different side of me." ...|$|R

25|$|Frank's {{style was}} very innovative, {{which was why}} he had such {{difficulty}} with early acceptance. He would bend notes and <b>sing</b> <b>about</b> the chordal context of a note rather than to sing the note directly, and he stressed each rhythmic downbeat, which {{was different from the}} smooth balladeer of his time.|$|E
25|$|Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, {{a former}} President of France, {{has said that}} it is ridiculous to <b>sing</b> <b>about</b> {{drenching}} French fields with impure Prussian blood as a German Chancellor takes the salute in Paris.

25|$|The {{song was}} written by Shiho Ochi and Kōichi Tabo {{especially}} for the drama Summer Rescue: Tenkū no Shinryōjo, starring Osamu Mukai and Machiko Ono. Ochi was inspired to write the lyrics for the song after reading the scrift for the drama, and decided to <b>sing</b> <b>about</b> rebirth, around a mofit {{of the sun and}} the moon.

She arrives, handing him a letter from his detective, and they <b>sing</b> <b>about</b> how exactly in agreement are their ideas on economy. Caroline is disconcerted that Rudolph insists on courting her in the market square, but he explains that he has made a law compelling couples to do all courting in the square so as to increase the value of his properties around the square. She approves of this example of economy.|$|E

25|$|Recorded in {{the hills}} of Trinidad, here is a {{fascinating}} juxtaposition of three music and music / dance practices of non-urban dwellers derived from African roots. Bamboo-Tamboo evolved out of the ban which European colonizers imposed on drumming: dry, hollow bamboo poles were cut to varying lengths to produce different pitches when thumped against the ground. These bamboo instruments are used to accompany or speak about calinda (stick fighting). Belair (bélé) is a dance of older women accompanied by drums and shakers, often danced all night long; whereas Kaiso, has its origins in West Africa and was brought over by the slaves who in the early history of the art form used it to <b>sing</b> <b>about</b> their masters.|$|E
500|$|According to Mudhoney vocalist Mark Arm, [...] "Touch Me I'm Sick" [...] {{originated}} from {{a discussion with}} Sub Pop owner Bruce Pavitt, who [...] "said: 'Hey, you <b>sing</b> <b>about</b> dogs.
