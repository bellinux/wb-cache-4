25|$|Lovers' Rock reclines on the {{hillside}} of Bowen Road near Shiu Fai Terrace, mid-levels Wan Chai. The rock received its name since it resembles a small, thin column <b>sticking</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rock base. This special-looking rock {{is said to have}} granted happy marriages to its devoted worshippers. Many people are attracted by its reputation.|$|E
25|$|The site at The Crook Beach, 1 km {{northeast}} of Scar, {{was found in}} 1985 by John Dearness, a farmer on Sanday. He found bones <b>sticking</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ground and a small lead object, and thought {{that he might have}} discovered the resting place of a dead sailor. Dearness died before the significance of the site was realized.|$|E

25|$|A teaser poster was released, {{which shows}} Wonder Woman comforting Superman, Batman in a {{different}} costume (with a sword and {{what appears to be}} chain mail armor) and Donna Troy wearing her Wonder Girl costume again. Kyle Rayner is wearing a yellow ring, and Mary Marvel is shown partially in shadow. Mister Miracle stands next to Big Barda. Also notable among the poster is a Legion flight ring, a minuscule red hand (the Atom's) <b>sticking</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rubble, and the bodies of Blue Beetle (Ted Kord), Maxwell Lord, The Question (Vic Sage), and Jade — major or notable heroes who had recently died. The heroes are gathered around the head of the Statue of Liberty; the decapitated body of the statue {{can be seen in the}} background.|$|E
25|$|When the German Army {{invaded the}} Netherlands in May 1940, the Royal Netherlands Navy made a plan which {{involved}} scuttling Jan Pieterszoon Coen {{at the entrance}} of the port of IJmuiden in order to prevent German warships entering the harbor. The plan was set in motion in the night of 14 May 1940, Captain R. van Rees Vellinga sailed Jan Pieterszoon Coen from Amsterdam to IJmuiden. Once there, the ship was supposed to be escorted to the harbor entrance by two tugboats, but they were accidentally sunk too early. As a solution to the problem, The Royal Netherlands Navy ordered the tugboat Atjeh and a minesweeper to tow the ship into place. The tugboat and minesweeper towed the ship into place with much difficulty due to the tide change. The ship was positioned with the bow to the Southern pier and the stern to the Northern pier of the port entrance. The explosives which were previously installed on the ship were detonated and the ship sank between the piers. Her upper decks were still <b>sticking</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water due to the shallow depths. The plan was successful and the ship prohibited German ships to enter the harbor, the Netherlands however surrendered to the Axis powers and was occupied by Nazi-Germany.|$|E

25|$|Ron {{is given}} his brother Charlie's old, chipped wand, {{which is made}} out of ash and has a unicorn hair <b>sticking</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> end. He holds the wand {{together}} with Spellotape after nearly breaking it in half at the start of Chamber of Secrets, but it malfunctions dreadfully after this, backfiring spells, making strange noises, and emitting objects from the wrong end. Ron's new wand is fourteen inches, willow and unicorn hair, which he procures before the start of his third year at Hogwarts. He also shows signs of exceptional tactical ability, as evidenced by his skill at Wizard's Chess (which is played exactly like normal chess but with living pieces). Ron's talents are rarely shown, but he, like the other DA members, survives a violent encounter with adult Death Eaters in Order of the Phoenix, and it is implied that during the Death Eater assault in Half-Blood Prince he held his own quite well because he was being helped by Felix Felicis, the good luck potion. In Deathly Hallows, Ron loses his original wand, and takes Peter Pettigrew's wand for his own. Following this, Ron begins to demonstrate more aptitude and general knowledge, along with a sudden spurt in maturity after a terrible row with Harry. For a while, he effectively leads the trio in the hunt for the Horcruxes while Harry suffers a major depression.|$|E
500|$|Mulder and Scully drive Bruckman to {{a wooded}} spot where Bruckman has {{said they will}} find Dukenfield's body. [...] As they tromp through the woods, Bruckman {{explains}} how he gained his ability {{following the death of}} Buddy Holly and The Big Bopper in a plane crash. Bruckman cannot pinpoint the exact spot where the body is, however, so they return to the parked car, where they see a lifeless hand <b>sticking</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wet mud underneath. Traces of silk fibers are subsequently found on Dukenfield similar to fibers found on previous victims - they are later analyzed and found to be from lace.|$|E
500|$|On 11 August 1889 Nansen {{announced}} his engagement to Eva Sars, {{the daughter of}} Michael Sars, a zoology professor who had died when Eva was 11 years old. The couple had met some years previously, at the skiing resort of Frognerseteren, where Nansen recalled seeing [...] "two feet <b>sticking</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> snow". Eva was three years older than Nansen, and despite the evidence of this first meeting, was an accomplished skier. She was also a celebrated classical singer who had been coached in Berlin by Désirée Artôt, one-time paramour of Tchaikovsky. The engagement surprised many; since Nansen had previously expressed himself forcefully against the institution of marriage, Otto Sverdrup assumed he had read the message wrongly. The wedding took place on 6 September 1889, {{less than a month}} after the engagement.|$|E

500|$|The Recopa Sudamericana trophy has not {{undergone}} {{many changes}} in its history. The trophy consists of a gold-coated body with a pedestal. The body consists of an Adidas Tango ball, a successful family and brand of association footballs. It was first introduced as the Tango Durlast in 1978 for the 1978 FIFA World Cup in Argentina. The ball is hoisted by a golden, cylindrical body with four quadrilateral edges <b>sticking</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body at 45 degrees from each other. The pedestal is separated into two parts; the top part of the pedestal consists of the CONMEBOL emblem. The bottom part of the pedestal contains a gold badge underneath the CONMEBOL emblem with the phrase, [...] "RECOPA", imprinted into it. To the left and right, badges of previous winners are placed.|$|E
500|$|The {{first game}} {{was to begin}} at 6pm CDT, with the second game to follow. Lorelei, a model who did public {{appearances}} for WLUP and who was very popular in Chicago that summer for her sexually provocative poses in the station's advertisements, threw out the first pitch. As the first game began, Mike Veeck got word that {{thousands of people were}} {{trying to get into the}} park without tickets. [...] He sent his security personnel to the stadium gates to keep the would-be gate crashers at bay. This left the field unattended, and fans began throwing the uncollected disco LPs and singles from the stands. [...] Tigers designated hitter Rusty Staub remembered that the records would slice through the air, and land <b>sticking</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ground. [...] He urged teammates to wear batting helmets when playing their positions, [...] "It wasn't just one, it was many. [...] Oh, God almighty, I've never seen anything so dangerous in my life." [...] Attendees also threw firecrackers, empty liquor bottles, and lighters onto the field. The game was stopped several times because of the rain of foreign objects.|$|E
500|$|Police {{searching the}} house at Wardle Brook Avenue found an old {{exercise}} book in which the name [...] "John Kilbride" [...] had been scribbled, which made them suspicious that Brady and Hindley might {{have been involved in}} the unsolved disappearances of other youngsters. A large collection of photographs was discovered in the house, many of which seemed to have been taken on Saddleworth Moor. One hundred and fifty officers were drafted to search the moor, looking for locations that matched the photographs. Initially the search was concentrated along the A628 road near Woodhead, but a close neighbour, 11-year-old Pat Hodges, had on several occasions been taken to the moor by Brady and Hindley and she was able to point out their favourite sites along the A635 road. On 16 October, police found an arm bone <b>sticking</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peat; officers presumed that they had found the body of John Kilbride, but soon discovered that it was that of Lesley Ann Downey. Her mother (now named Ann West after her marriage to Alan West) had been on the moor watching as the police conducted their search, but was not present when the body was found. She was shown clothing recovered from the grave, and identified it as belonging to her missing daughter.|$|E

500|$|In {{keeping with}} {{previous}} entries, the story {{focused on a}} single protagonist rather than a group as in other role-playing games of the time to promote full player immersion. The main protagonist was the first character to be created, being featured in the first Alpha build. So as to include a feeling of [...] "digitality" [...] in the game, the main character was designed as something akin to a human computer. This approach {{was inspired by the}} special make-up used in David Cronenberg's 1983 horror film Videodrome. While the protagonist was originally designed with keyboards growing from inside him, Kaneko felt uncomfortable with that and instead redesigned him with full-body tattoos. The tattoos were intended to convey the character's demon powers, act as an obvious stigma in place of wings or horns, and be a reference to real-world shamans who commonly made themselves stand out using tattoos. Kaneko's inspiration for the main character's design was the American rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers: according to Kaneko, he [...] "imagined [...] running around the desert naked". The main character was initially going to use one of the series' recurring arm-mounted COMP computers, but as he had already become a demon hybrid, it did not make sense to include it. As he was the character controlled by the player, more focus was given to embodying and reflecting his world view than to developing a personality. In keeping with the game's theme of energy remaking reality, Kaneko dressed his character in comfortable shorts to balance against his tattoos. The spike growing from the main character's neck, the Magatama fused with him {{at the beginning of the}} game, was inspired by the theory that a person's aura appears as a shark fin <b>sticking</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> back of their neck when viewed from the side.|$|E
500|$|This rockfowl builds its nest {{onto the}} sides of rocks, {{normally}} in caves, where nests are built both by the entrance and deep within, or on nearly vertical cliff faces, which can be either bare or have some vegetation, though never woody branches, near the nest. Nests need to be built under an overhang {{to protect it from}} water, and the rock surface normally slopes forward slightly. The nests are almost always found near water, which can be in the form of either streams or forest pools. These streams, particularly those located {{at the base of a}} nesting cliff, help keep predators away from the nests. Nests on rock surfaces are normally built [...] above the ground. In addition to the rock face nests, there is a record of a nest being constructed on the buttress root of a Piptadeniastrum tree above a small stream. Two nests were even built onto a concrete bridge in Gabon's Lopé National Park. The male and female rockfowl work equally on the nest's construction, and it can take two to three months to build one, though in some extreme cases it takes more than a year. The nest itself is a half-cup constructed of dry mud with grass fibres and dead leaves mixed in, often with the plant matter <b>sticking</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nest's walls. It is either built onto the rock surface or, in some cases, is built more like a retaining wall across the opening of a small rock fissure. Nests are built at least away [...] from each other, and in some cases up to [...] The nest is normally [...] thick, though the nest is uneven in its construction and one nest was [...] thick. It is about [...] wide and [...] long and weighs about [...] However, nest sizes do have a large degree of variability. After the mud dries, it becomes a very hard structure. The inside of the nest is lined with rootlets and thin strips of grass.|$|E
