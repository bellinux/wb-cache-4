50|$|Manoeuvring {{thruster}} (bow thruster or <b>stern</b> <b>thruster)</b> is {{a transversal}} propulsion device built into, or mounted to, either the bow or stern, {{of a ship}} or boat, {{to make it more}} maneuverable. Bow thrusters make docking easier, since they allow the captain to turn the vessel to port or starboard side, without using the main propulsion mechanism which requires some forward motion for turning; indeed, the effectiveness of a thruster is curtailed by any forward motion due to the Coandă effect. A <b>stern</b> <b>thruster</b> is of the same principle, fitted at the stern. Large ships might have multiple bow thrusters and stern thrusters.|$|E

50|$|Sea Pole class bathyscaphe has a {{teardrop}} shape tapering {{toward the}} stern and four tail fins which form an X shape. The main thruster system {{is based on}} the same design principle as that of the Russian Mir class bathyscaphe. Four main thrusters inclined in a narrowing shape are mounted in the spaces between the four fins. One horizontal thruster is mounted {{on the top of the}} bow, and thrusters for vertical / horizontal turning and auxiliary propulsion are provided on the two sides of the hull. Parallel movement in the horizontal direction is achieved by using a combination of the horizontal thruster on the bow and the right and left <b>stern</b> <b>thrusters,</b> while vertical movement uses a combination of the bow side thrusters and the top and bottom <b>stern</b> <b>thrusters.</b>|$|R

50|$|Built as an icegoing ship, Katarina {{was fitted}} with {{propellers}} in both stern and bow. Previously, such propulsion arrangement had been utilized in Finnish icebreakers. Her main engines, a 4-cylinder Wärtsilä 4R22HF and a 8-cylinder Wärtsilä 8R22HF medium-speed diesel generating sets, produce 590 and 1,180kW of electricity, respectively. The propulsion motors are rated 855kW (stern) and 630kW (bow). In addition, Katarina has a bow thruster and a <b>stern</b> <b>thruster,</b> both rated at 215kW.|$|E

These engines provide power for various ship's {{services}} and for two STN AEG propulsion motors. The propulsion motors drive two propellers, each of which measures 5.8 m in diameter. For manoeuvring, the ship has three bow thrusters and a <b>stern</b> <b>thruster.</b> The ship's service speed is 24 kn, though during sea trials she reached a maximum speed of 29 kn.|$|E
25|$|To {{maintain}} position azimuth thrusters (electric, L-drive or Z-drive) bow <b>thrusters,</b> <b>stern</b> <b>thrusters,</b> water jets, rudders and propellers are used. DP {{ships are}} usually {{at least partially}} diesel-electric, as this allows a more flexible set-up and is better {{able to handle the}} large changes in power demand, typical for DP operations. These fluctuations may be suitable for hybrid operation. An LNG-powered platform supply vessel started operation in 2016 with a 653 kWh/1600 kW battery acting as spinning reserve during DP2, saving 15-30% fuel.|$|R
50|$|Two bow and two <b>stern</b> <b>thrusters</b> provide port manoeuvrability, and {{two pairs}} of {{stabilizer}} fins reduce rolling. A special silicone-based paint, instead of biocides used by much of the industry, keeps barnacles off of the hull. This increases her efficiency by reducing drag while also protecting the ocean from biocides that may leak. The paint is credited with lowering the water drag enough to save 1,200 tonnes of fuel per year. The ship has a bulbous bow, a standard feature for cargo ships.|$|R
25|$|When the France was {{converted}} into the Norway, the speed for trans-Atlantic crossing {{was no longer}} needed, and so the forward boilers and engines were shut down and eventually dismantled. This move also reduced the fuel consumption to 250 tonnes per 24 hours. The remaining four boilers and engine room were made fully automated, and operated from either a central control station below decks, or from the bridge. Five bow and <b>stern</b> <b>thrusters,</b> developing 10,600hp, were also installed to increase manoeuvrability in ports without the assistance of tugs.|$|R
50|$|Each ship is {{propelled}} by two main engines providing {{a total of}} 2,900 horsepower. The main engines turn two seven-foot (2.1-meter) propellers with controllable pitch, which provides greater response time and maneuverability. The ships also are equipped with two thrusters. The <b>stern</b> <b>thruster</b> is a water jet system that allows the ship to move in any direction {{without the use of}} propellers. This system was installed to protect the endangered manatee population that inhabits regions of the Banana River where the ships are based. The system also allows divers to work near the ship during operations at a greatly reduced risk.|$|E
50|$|The new MV Abegweit was a {{much larger}} and more capable vessel - the largest on the Northumberland Strait service and she became the {{flagship}} of this route. Measuring 401 feet (122 m) in length and displacing 12,000 tons, the ship had six main engines which generated 18,000 brake horsepower (13 MW) which drove two stern propellers and two bow thrusters and one <b>stern</b> <b>thruster.</b> She could carry 974 passengers and 250 cars (or 40 trucks or 20 railway cars) and had a hoistable car deck which doubled the number of cars on the B/C decks.|$|E

5000|$|Reacquired {{five years}} later, Naubuc was {{reinstated}} to the Naval Vessel Register 1 June 1967 arid {{scheduled to be}} converted to a Salvage Craft Tender. In March 1968 she was reclassified (ARST-4) and assigned to the 13th Naval District for conversion. In her later years, she was outfitted with four 12-cylinder diesel engines that powered four rotating thrusters mounted on vertical shafts. She was configured as a cable laying and implantment vessel with a cable drum located in the bow along with a cable guide going over the <b>stern.</b> The four <b>thrusters</b> allowed the vessel to stay [...] "on station". When underway, however, only the two bow or <b>stern</b> <b>thrusters</b> were operated at any one time. The vertical thruster shafts increased the vessel's draft significantly. The thrusters were easily damaged by impact with the bottom. The Naubuc's final mission was as a support vessel for a cable underwater recovery vehicle (CURV-2) in the Tongue of the Ocean, off Andros Island.|$|R

50|$|Before the {{two sisters}} entered service for Stena Line, an {{extensive}} refurbishment/conversion overseen by Stena Ro-Ro and Knud E Hansen was undertaken at the Remontowa Shipyard in Gdansk, Poland. This was rumoured {{at the time}} to have cost a total of €14M. As part of this conversion, the free height of the upper vehicle deck was raised to 5.05 m allowing Stena to carry full height freight. Both ships also received an additional bow thruster to improve manoeuvrability, taking their complement to 3 bow thrusters and 1 <b>stern</b> <b>thruster.</b> As the new port in Scotland had a TTS automated mooring system installed, the ships where also adapted to work with this by adding 3 steel bollards on the starboard side bow.|$|E
