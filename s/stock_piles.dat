50|$|If {{a player}} sees a card {{to which he}} is not {{entitled}} by playing out of turn or by drawing more than one card {{from the top of}} the <b>stock</b> <b>pile,</b> that card is placed face up on top of the <b>stock</b> <b>pile.</b> The next player in turn may either take the card or have it placed face down in the center of the <b>stock</b> <b>pile</b> and proceed to play as if no irregularity had occurred. If more than one card is so exposed at the top of the <b>stock</b> <b>pile,</b> the option of each player in turn is only to take the top such card remaining there, or the top face-down card of the <b>stock</b> <b>pile,</b> or the previous player's discard. That is, players have three options to draw from instead of the normal two for as long as exposed cards remain at the top of the <b>stock</b> <b>pile.</b>|$|R

50|$|It is {{possible}} when many cards {{have been taken}} out of turn in a hand, resulting in many penalty cards, that the <b>stock</b> <b>pile</b> may dwindle down to nothing before any player has gone out. Should this happen, the <b>stock</b> <b>pile</b> is turned over once, without shuffling, and play continues in order. If the remaining cards in the <b>stock</b> <b>pile</b> are depleted a second time without any player going out, the hand ends and all points remaining in all players' hands are tallied as they would be had someone gone out.|$|R
5000|$|Paskahousu ( [...] , shit pants) is a Finnish card game. The {{object of}} the game is to play higher cards than the {{previously}} played cards, first to get replacement cards from the <b>stock</b> <b>pile,</b> and, after the <b>stock</b> <b>pile</b> has exhausted, to get rid of one's cards.

50|$|While playing Speed, when {{it comes}} to {{slapping}} your final pile, players have the option of shouting the word “Speed” as they slap the deck. This rule can be carried over to Spit, however it is not mandatory. The difference between Spit and Speed is in the arrangement of the <b>stock</b> <b>piles.</b> In Spit, each player has a row of <b>stock</b> <b>piles,</b> usually five, each with the top card face up. In Speed, each player has a single face down stock pile and a hand of five cards.|$|E

50|$|Spit is {{a similar}} game in which two players {{simultaneously}} put down cards in ascending or descending order, until all of one player's cards are gone. In Speed each player holds up to five cards in his hand, and has one stock pile, face down. In Spit each player has a row of <b>stock</b> <b>piles,</b> usually five, with the top card face up, so all cards in play are visible to both players.|$|E

Food riots erupted in several dozen countries; {{in at least two}} cases, Haiti and Madagascar, this led to the toppling of governments. A second global food crisis unfolded due to the spike in food prices of late 2010 and early 2011. Fewer food riots occurred, due in part to greater availability of food <b>stock</b> <b>piles</b> for relief. However, several analysts argue the food crisis was one of the causes of the Arab Spring.|$|E

50|$|It was {{revealed}} on the 14th {{that all of}} the British county councils, London boroughs and unitary authorities were advised by the government to have six days' supplies of road salt in 2009. Up to 30 councils rejected last year's offer of thousands of tonnes of de-icing salt at a reduced price, to use on the roads this winter according to the BBC. The British Salt Director David Stephen made an offer out of the firm's 60,000 tonnes stockpile at Middlewich, Cheshire, in April 2009, but virtually no one to take up the offer. Evidence suggests that only a few took up the government's advice. The Highways Agency had 13 days worth of road salt, while Glasgow, Kirklees, Derbyshire, Derby City, Buckinghamshire, Cherwell District and the London Borough of Harrow took up the offer and raised their <b>stock</b> <b>piles</b> to seven days worth. The Cherwell Borough, Bicester Parish, Oxfordshire, Slough borough, Harrow, Leicestershire, Buckinghamshire, Fife, Brighton and Hove unitary authority, Liverpool city, Pembrokeshire, Lancashire, Belfast city and Perth and Kinross councils nearly to run out of salt. Scotland, Cumbria, Northumbria and Northern Ireland were getting priority access to salt due to the severity of the local landscape and storm activity.|$|E
50|$|The {{concept of}} nationalizing the coal mines had been {{accepted}} in principle by owners and miners alike before {{the elections of}} 1945. The owners were paid £165,000,000. The government set up the National Coal Board to manage the coal mines; and it loaned it £150,000,000 to modernize the system. The general condition of the coal industry had been unsatisfactory for many years, with poor productivity. In 1945 there were 28% more workers in the coal mines than in 1890, but the annual output was only 8% greater. Young people avoided the pits; between 1931 and 1945 the percentage of miners more than 40 years old rose from 35% to 43%, and 24,000 over 65 years old. The number of surface workers decreased between 1938 and 1945 by only 3,200, but in that same time the number of underground workers declined by 69,600, substantially altering the balance of labour in the mines. That accidents, breakdowns, and repairs in the mines were nearly twice as costly in terms of production in 1945 {{as they had been}} in 1939 was probably a by-product of the war. Output in 1946 averaged 3,300,000 tons weekly. By summer 1946 {{it was clear that the}} country was facing a coal shortage for the upcoming winter with <b>stock</b> <b>piles</b> of 5 million tons too low. Nationalization exposed both a lack of preparation for public ownership and a failure to stabilize the industry in advance of the change. Also lacking were any significant incentives to maintain or increase coal production to meet demand.|$|E
5000|$|Two to {{four people}} can play {{at a time}} as individuals, or, six or more players in teams (no more than three partnerships). The object {{of the game is}} to be the first player or team to play out their entire <b>stock</b> <b>pile(s).</b> The player with the middle age goes first. Each player is dealt 30 cards for their pile with only the top card visible, and a hand of five cards, and the {{remaining}} cards are placed face down to create a common draw pile. The shared play area allows up to four build piles, which must be started using either a [...] "1" [...] card or a Skip-Bo, and each player also has up to four personal discard piles. Each turn the active player draws until they have five cards in hand, though there are cases of not drawing more cards to equal five cards, instead doing a draw of a certain number of cards. They must play either the next card in sequential order or a wild Skip-Bo card, using either cards in hand, the top card of their stock pile, or the top card of any of their four discard piles. If the player can play all five cards from their hand, they draw five more and continue playing. When no more plays are available, the player discards one card to either an empty discard pile or on top of an existing one and play passes to the next player. When a build pile reaches 12, it is removed from the board and that space becomes empty for another pile to be started; play continues until one player has played their final start card.|$|E
