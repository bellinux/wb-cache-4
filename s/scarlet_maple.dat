'Neither {{thinking}} nor fog conduced {{to seeing}} where I was going; {{and when my}} ankle began to give out, and I was going to turn, I ran into a hedge, which, looming through the mist, I had been taking for a fine range of distant mountains--rather my {{way of dealing with}} other objects. Being without a horse on whose neck to lay the reins, I could only coast the hedge, hoping it might lead me back to Oakstead Park, which I had abandoned in my craving for space and dread of being dogged by the Ensign. But the treacherous hedge led me nowhere but to a horsepond; and when I had struggled out of the adjacent mire, and attained a rising ground, I could only see about four yards square of bare down, all the rest being grey fog. Altogether, the scene was worth something. I heard what I thought the tinkling of a sheep bell through the cloud, which dulled the sound like cotton wool; I pursued the call, when anon, the veil began to grow thin, and revealed, looking just like a transparency, a glimpse of a little village in a valley almost under my feet, trees, river, church-spire and all, and the bell became clearer, and showed me what kind of flock it was meant for. I turned that way, and had just found a path leading down the steep, when down closed the cloud--a natural dissolving view--leaving me wondering whether it had been mirage or imagination, till presently, the curtain drew up in earnest. Out came, not merely form, but colour, as I have seen a camera clear itself--blue sky, purple hills, russet and orange woods, a great elm green picked out with yellow, a mass of brown oaks, a <b>scarlet</b> <b>maple,</b> a beech grove, skirting a brilliant water meadow, with a most reflective stream running through it, and giving occasion for a single arched bridge, and a water mill, with a wheel draperied with white foam; two swans disporting on the water (I would not declare they were not geese), a few cottony flakes of mist hanging over damp corners, the hill rising green, with the bright whitewashed cottages of this district, on the side a rich, red, sandstone-coloured church, late architecture, tower rather mouldering--all the more picturesque; churchyard, all white headstones and ochreous sheep, surmounted by a mushroom-shaped dark yew tree, railed in with intensely white rails, the whole glowing in the parting coup-de-soleil of a wet day, every tear of every leaf glistening, and everything indescribably lustrous. It is a picture that one's mental photograph ought to stamp for life, and the cheering and interest it gave, no one but you can understand. I wished for you, I know. It looks so poor in words.|$|E
50|$|Being {{considered}} a holy place, a monument commemorating the birth legend of Kim Alji {{was built in}} 1803 by the Joseon. Gyerim has been designated as historical landmark #19 from the Korean government since January, 1963. The grounds cover 7,300㎡ and has a dense forest of old oak, ash, zelkova, willow, Japanese clovers, <b>scarlet</b> <b>maple</b> and Japanese pagoda trees.|$|E
50|$|Momijigari (a.k.a. Viewing <b>Scarlet</b> <b>Maple</b> Leaves, Maple Leaf Viewing, or Maple Viewing) is a Japanese film shot in 1899 by Shibata Tsunekichi. It is {{a record}} of the kabuki actors Onoe Kikugoro V and Ichikawa Danjūrō IX {{performing}} a scene from the kabuki play Momijigari. It is the oldest extant Japanese film and the first film to be designated an Important Cultural Property.|$|E
60|$|But when Austen appeared, with Pepper, {{to drive}} her home to Fairview, his {{presence}} never failed to revive the fierce faith {{that it was his}} destiny to make the world better, and hers to help him. Wondrous afternoons they spent together in that stillest and most mysterious of seasons in the hill country--autumn! Autumn and happiness! Happiness as shameless as the flaunting <b>scarlet</b> <b>maples</b> on the slopes, defiant of the dying year of the future, shadowy and unreal as the hills before them in the haze. Once, after a long silence, she started from a revery with the sudden consciousness of his look intent upon her, and turned with parted lips and eyes which smiled at him out of troubled depths.|$|R

60|$|This picture {{had always}} been the ruling star of John's house, his main {{dependence}} for brightening up his bachelor apartments; and {{when he came to the}} task of furbishing those same rooms for a fair occupant, the picture was still his mine of gold. For a picture painted by a real artist, who studies Nature minutely and conscientiously, has something of the charm of the good Mother herself,--something of her faculty of putting on different aspects under different lights. John and his wife had studied their picture at all hours of the day: they had seen how it looked when the morning sun came aslant the <b>scarlet</b> <b>maples</b> and made a golden shimmer over the blue mountains, how it looked toned down in the cool shadows of afternoon, and how it warmed up in the sunset and died off mysteriously into the twilight; and now, when larger parlors were to be furnished, the picture was still the tower of strength, the rallying-point of their hopes.|$|R

Baxter and Canadian Prime Minister W.L.M. King, for Carman’s ashes to be returned to Fredericton." [...] "His ashes were buried in Forest Hill Cemetery, Fredericton, and a national memorial service was held at the Anglican cathedral there." [...] Twenty-five years later, on May 13, 1954, a <b>scarlet</b> <b>maple</b> tree was planted at his gravesite, to grant his request in his 1892 poem [...] "The Grave-Tree": ...|$|E
5000|$|Reginald H. King, {{head of the}} Scarborough Board of Education when Thomson opened, was a classicist. The motto Nil sine magno labore (Nothing without great effort) was {{selected}} as most appropriate from his collection of Latin mottos and was incorporated in the Thomson logo, which remains unchanged. The motto appears {{at the base of}} a <b>scarlet</b> <b>maple</b> leaf on which are superimposed a lamp of learning and the initials D and M in white. The leaf is flanked by a large [...] "C" [...] and [...] "I", both in black forming arcs of a circle with the lower sections of the motto. Finally the name [...] "Thomson", white on a scarlet background, surmounts the rest of the design and completes the circle. The school colours were originally scarlet, black and white.|$|E
60|$|It was a {{beautiful}} and brilliant sunset, yet not so beautiful and brilliant but that the whole opulent forest around him seemed to challenge and repeat its richest {{as well as its}} most delicate dyes. The reddening west, seen through an opening of <b>scarlet</b> <b>maples,</b> was no longer red; the golden glory of the sun, sinking over a promontory of gleaming yellow sumach that jutted out into the noble river, was shorn of its intense radiance; at times in the thickest woods he seemed surrounded by a yellow nimbus; at times so luminous was the glow of these translucent leaves that the position of the sun itself seemed changed, or the shadows cast in defiance of its glory. As he walked on, long reaches of the lordly placid stream at his side were visible, as far as the terraces of the opposite shore, lifted on basaltic columns, themselves streaked and veined with gold and fire. Paul had seen nothing like this since his boyhood; for an instant the great heroics of the Sierran landscape were forgotten in this magnificent harlequinade.|$|R
6000|$|In the sun-sweet {{place before}} the Pulpit Stone we boys had put up a board table. Aunt Janet allowed us to cover it with an old tablecloth, the worn places in which the girls artfully {{concealed}} with frost-whitened ferns. We had the kitchen dishes, and the table was gaily decorated with Cecily's three <b>scarlet</b> geraniums and <b>maple</b> leaves in the cherry vase. As for the viands, they were fit for the gods on high Olympus. Felicity had spent the whole previous day and the forenoon of the picnic day in concocting them. Her crowning achievement was a rich little plum cake, on the white frosting of which the words [...] "Welcome Back" [...] were lettered in pink candies. This was put before Peter's place, and almost overcame him.|$|R
