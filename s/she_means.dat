After cunningly obtaining {{the secret of the}} dacoits' cave, Kasim sentences Alibaba to death, falsely accusing him of attempted murder. Marziana pretends to heed Kasim's order. She declares that Alibaba has been unfaithful to her and he deserves this retribution. Taking a knife, Marziana acts as though <b>she</b> <b>means</b> to kill Alibaba, but instead cuts the ropes that bind his hands.

500|$|... "Si Tú Supieras" [...] (...) {{is a song}} {{written by}} Kike Santander and {{performed}} by Mexican recording artist Alejandro Fernández. It was co-produced by Santander and Emilio Estefan and was released as the first single from Me Estoy Enamorando by Sony Music Mexico on August 1997. The song is a bolero-pop ballad with ranchera influences and portrays the singer yearning for his lover {{to know how much}} <b>she</b> <b>means</b> to him. A music video was made for the track and was used as the main theme for the Mexican telenovela María Isabel.|$|E
500|$|Hilary is sent with {{a search}} party {{to find the}} missing girl. Meanwhile, Margaret makes a daring escape via the window, and rides off on the school horse. [...] She finds Marie, who is miserable and frightened and wants {{to return to the}} school {{whatever}} the consequences. Margaret confesses that she [...] borrowed [...] the £5 to bet on a horse, and has won £100. <b>She</b> <b>means</b> to leave Willow Gables for good, and apologises to Marie for the trouble she has caused her. This conversation is overheard by Hilary's search party, and after a scuffle the truants are captured. On the way back to school they hear cries from the river; it is Myfanwy, who has got into difficulties while swimming. Margaret frees herself from her captors' clutches, dives in and saves her drowning friend.|$|E
500|$|It {{was also}} noted that Lewis' [...] "delicately seductive vocals are more versatile", with the Detroit Free Press stating that her voice [...] "smoothly mixes classic country with pop and indie-rock, Lewis is as adept on the ballads as {{she is on the}} rave-ups." [...] The Times {{considered}} Lewis' songwriting [...] "leagues ahead of anything that she has done in the past" [...] and her vocals sound [...] "as though <b>she</b> <b>means</b> it". DeRogatis pointed out that [...] "Lewis' impressive strength as both a singer and a songwriter is that she makes every listener feel as if her music was crafted just for them." [...] However, Angela Zimmerman of Crawdaddy! felt that Lewis often used a [...] "pervasive soprano that she can't quite execute" [...] on tracks like [...] "Black Sand", [...] "Pretty Bird", [...] "Trying My Best to Love You", and [...] "Jack Killed Mom".|$|E
6000|$|... "Mother," [...] he cried, passionately, [...] "to {{lose her}} now would kill me. She is my hope, my stay, my God! She has stabbed {{me to the}} heart to-night. Did <b>she</b> <b>mean</b> it? <b>She</b> can't <b>mean</b> it!" ...|$|R

500|$|The {{dictator}} novel {{came back}} into fashion in the 1970s, {{towards the end of}} the Boom. As Sharon Keefe Ugalde remarks, [...] "the 1970s mark a new stage in the evolution of the Latin American dictator novel, characterized by at least two developments: a change in the perspective from which the dictator is viewed and a new focus on the nature of language." [...] By this <b>she</b> <b>means</b> that the dictator novels of the 1970s, such as The Autumn of the Patriarch or I, the Supreme, offer the reader a more intimate view of their subject: [...] "the dictator becomes protagonist" [...] and the world is often seen from his point of view. With the new focus on language, Keefe Ugalde points to the realisation on the part of many authors that [...] "the tyrant's power is derived from and defeated by language." [...] For example, in Jorge Zalamea's El Gran Burundún Burundá ha muerto the dictator bans all forms of language.|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Judy Coleman of The Boston Globe called [...] "Get Back" [...] a [...] "welcome girl-rock hit". Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic included the song at number eight on his [...] "Top 10 from the Disney girls" [...] list, and said, [...] "She wrote {{this with the}} Jonas Brothers, but it sounds more like a Tommy Tutone B-side from the early '80s or {{the sort of thing}} Greg Kihn was pining for when he sang, 'They don't write 'em like that anymore'". Masley noted that the song sounds better live, as does [...] "nearly everything Lovato touches". Masley concluded, writing, [...] "When she sings 'I {{want to get back to}} the old days,' what <b>she</b> <b>means</b> is when she and her boyfriend were happy, but power-pop fans will hear it as a call to get back to much older days than that." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic noted it as one of the best tracks on Don't Forget. Joey Guerra of The Houston Chronicle called it [...] "undeniably kicky, and Lovato manages some surprisingly credible rock wails." [...] Ken Barnes of USA Today called it an [...] "insidious, Go-Go's-like single".|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with MTV in 2006, vocalist Taylor said that Come What(ever) May was {{a return to the}} roots of the band, stating it is [...] "a lot more from the spirit of what the band started with in 1992". He noted that some songs were [...] "very atmospheric" [...] while others maintained [...] "the hard rock and the heavy stuff". Jon Wiederhorn of MTV said that [...] "for every thrash riff there's a tunefully grungy passage, for every flailing guitar line there's a rock-radio hook." [...] When talking about the track [...] "30/30-150", he said parts are [...] "bludgeoning, barbed and heavy" [...] while others are [...] "soaring and triumphant" [...] with the production of Raskulinecz helping to balance the album's heaviness with its radio-accessibility. Come What(ever) Mays lyrics include themes of [...] "pain, pleasure, happiness, and grief". The diversity in subjects is evident throughout the album; songs including [...] "Come What(ever) May" [...] were politically influenced while the track [...] "Socio" [...] is about [...] "social anxiety attacks" [...] that Taylor suffered. [...] "Zzyzx Rd" [...] is a love song written to Taylor's wife for helping him in his struggles against alcoholism and contemplation of suicide. [...] "I've never written anything like that before, but it was very important for me to tell the world not only how much she saved me, but how much <b>she</b> <b>means</b> to me," [...] said Taylor. Taylor said there is a common thread with the lyrics throughout the album, saying that they are [...] "about never forgetting where you came from, who you are and why you do this." ...|$|E

2500|$|Other, more pro-Serb British intellectuals sharply criticised her views. Rebecca West {{included}} Durham in her {{description of}} the sort of traveller who came back [...] "with a pet Balkan people established in their hearts as suffering and innocent, eternally the massacree and never the massacrer," [...] (Durham sued West over this) and then went on to say [...] "the Albanians, as championed by Miss Durham, strongly resembled Sir Joshua Reynold's picture of the Infant Samuel." [...] The distinguished historian R.W. Seton-Watson commented that [...] "the fact is that while always denouncing 'Balkan mentality', she is herself exactly what <b>she</b> <b>means</b> by the word." ...|$|E

As they discuss the possibility of Cope marrying, Randolph remarks:(193) ...|$|E

2500|$|Speaking to Ngũgĩ's {{relevance}} to the first debate, Spivak notes that while globalization requires a few hegemonic languages {{in order to maintain}} international communication, in order to nurture [...] "the impossible dream of a welfare-world globalization (by which <b>she</b> <b>means</b> 'using capital as socialism would'), this requirement must be supplemented by a deep immersion in that world's richness of language." [...] In other words, English has its uses, but nurturing and proliferating indigenous languages will only help to improve the more egalitarian projects of globalization. Spivak insists that Ngũgĩ's Decolonising the Mind paved the way for this perspective on globalization: [...] "Ngũgĩ was not simply arguing for his mother tongue, as his subsequent career has shown. He was also arguing for inhabiting non-hegemonic languages with the depth of imaginative use, while retaining English... as 'the first language of international communication'." ...|$|E
2500|$|Back to Black {{was named}} one of the 10 best albums of 2006 and 2007 by several {{publications}} on their year-end albums lists, including The Austin Chronicle (number four), Billboard (number three), Blender (number eight), Slant Magazine (number four), Entertainment Weekly (number two), The New York Times (number three) and Time (number one). The album was placed at number 40 on Rolling Stones list of The Top 50 Albums of 2007. Entertainment Weekly critic Chris Willman named Back to Black the second best album of 2007, commenting that [...] "Black will hold up {{as one of the great}} breakthrough CDs of our time." [...] He adds, [...] "In the end, the singer's real-life heartache over her incarcerated spouse proves what's obvious from the grooves: When this lady sings about love, <b>she</b> <b>means</b> every word." [...] Rolling Stones list of the 100 Best Albums of the 2000s ranked the album number 20. In 2012, Rolling Stone ranked the album at number 451 on its list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.

That's awesome, she's freaking Janet Jackson." [...] Jackson contacted Kahn directly to direct the video, saying [...] "I was star struck on Janet for sure, {{because that was the}} first time that I really dealt with someone that was in my youth. I studied Janet Jackson videos growing up. So to finally see myself face to face with her and working with her and her calling me on a first name basis and calling my home and tracking me down on my cell phone… like her leaving messages, it was the weirdest thing." [...] Kahn continued [...] "And Janet, she really is elegant, she’s like royalty. Even though she’s talking to you and trying to be normal, she’s not – she’s Janet Jackson – and you can never get that out of your head. You realize that she’s a real person and she’s got just the same emotions as everyone else, but you can never get around the fact that she’s special." ...|$|E
