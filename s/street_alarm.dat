5000|$|The first {{fire station}} {{east of the}} Anacostia River was built in 1898. This station, {{designed}} by the Washington, D.C. architectural firm of Averill and Adams, was the fourth built there in 1910. The eclectic style, principally French revival, reflected the desire by the Office of the Municipal Architect to create unique designs for new fire stations. [...] At the time, {{this part of the}} District of Columbia was considered a suburban district because it was beyond public water service and the <b>street</b> <b>alarm</b> system. Chemical Company Number 2 was housed here for that reason. The building’s hose tower was also used as a lookout post. It joined with the last of the District's Chemical companies in being converted to a regular engine company on January 1, 1921 when it became Engine Company 19. In 1925 it was the last company in the department to switch from horse drawn apparatus to motorized.|$|E
25|$|The {{entire process}} from initial {{notification}} until a unit is dispatched {{can take up}} to two (2) minutes, depending on the complexity of the call, the information provided by the caller(s) and the degree of other alarm activity in the office. If a dispatch office is so busy that its incoming telephone alarm lines are all busy or not answered within 30 seconds, the call is automatically transferred to another borough dispatch office. If an Emergency Reporting System (ERS) <b>street</b> fire <b>alarm</b> box is not answered with 60 seconds, usually because all of the alarm receipt consoles are in use, the computer automatically dispatches an engine company to the location of the physical <b>street</b> fire <b>alarm</b> box.|$|R
50|$|The Ansonia Fire Department {{also has}} an Office of the Fire Marshal and a Fire Alarm Superintendent Division (which {{maintains}} the <b>street</b> box <b>alarm</b> notification system). The Fire Marshall commands an investigation truck and a staff vehicle, and the Superintendent operates a utility bucket truck (also used by the Public Works Department).|$|R
50|$|The fire department's {{central station}} was located {{only a few}} blocks away at Preston and Caroline <b>Streets.</b> The <b>alarm</b> was {{received}} at 12:50 a.m. Deputy Chief Grover Cleveland Adams was the first to arrive at the burning hotel where he summoned a general alarm as he witnessed flames shooting from windows and the roof.|$|R
50|$|In 1960, {{the largest}} police {{corruption}} {{scandal in the}} U.S. to date began to unfold. More than 50 area law-enforcement personnel - almost entirely Denver Police Officers were caught in a burglary ring. Cops had stolen {{over a quarter of}} a million dollars from businesses they were supposed to be protecting on their beats over a ten-year period. Police cars would close down a few blocks of a major business avenue, such as University or Broadway, then burgle and steal the safes from the businesses along the closed down portion of the <b>street.</b> <b>Alarms</b> would be going off all up and down the street, they would take their loot, then respond to the alarms and take the reports. It all came to a crashing halt when an officer named Art Winstanley literally had a safe fall out of the back of his police cruiser. He testified against his fellow officers and by the end of 1961, 47 police officers had lost their badges.|$|R
50|$|New {{equipment}} was purchased and housed in Barrett's barn {{on the corner}} of Florida Grove Road- and May <b>Street.</b> An <b>alarm</b> system consisting of a locomotive wheel and hammer was also set up at this site. In 1918 lots were purchased at the {{on the corner of}} May and Charles Streets and the building was erected in 1921. Hopelawn's first fire chief was John Jancisko.|$|R

50|$|In 1888 Bombay Municipal Corporation Act {{was enacted}} and {{protection}} of life and properties from fire become {{the duty of the}} Corporation. W. Nicholls of the London Fire Brigade was appointed Chief Officer in 1890. The first motorized fire engine was commissioned in 1907. Also in 1907, the Bombay Salvage Corporation was formed, responsible for fire protection and salvage operations. <b>Street</b> fire <b>alarms</b> were installed in 1913. The Brigade was motorised by replacing horse-drawn steam engines in 1920, and the Bombay fire brigade started ambulance service using six donated ambulances.|$|R
5000|$|The Albanian {{government}} {{tried to}} keep secret {{the news of the}} Italian ultimatum. While Radio Tirana persistently broadcast that nothing was happening, people became suspicious; and the news of the Italian ultimatum was spread from unofficial sources. On April 5 the king's son was born and the news was announced by cannons. People poured out into the <b>streets</b> <b>alarmed,</b> but the news of the newborn prince calmed them. People were suspicious that something else was going on, which led to an anti-Italian demonstration in Tirana the same day. On 6 April there were several demonstrations in Albania's main cities. That same afternoon 100 Italian aircraft flew over Tirana, Durrës, and Vlorë, dropping leaflets instructing the people to submit to Italian occupation. The people were infuriated by this demonstration of force and called for the government to resist and to release the Albanians arrested as [...] "communists". The crowd shouted, [...] "Give us arms! We are being sold out! We are being betrayed!". While a mobilization of the reserves was called, many high-ranking officers left the country. Also the government was fading away. The Minister of the Interior, Musa Juka, left the country for Yugoslavia the same day. While King Zog broadcast to the nation that he would resist Italian occupation, people felt that they were being abandoned by their government.|$|R
60|$|Terror {{seized upon}} the populace, for they {{considered}} these ravings as the inspirations of prophecy.

25|$|That Tuesday night, many {{residents}} around East Ninth <b>street</b> were <b>alarmed</b> and {{called into the}} Gazette and News that they believed more murders had been committed because they heard sirens. The sirens {{turned out to be}} sound effects from a carnival. Guard dogs became a hot commodity in local want-ads. Terrified wives would not go out after dark. In addition to arming and barricading themselves, residents took to extreme measures, such as creating booby-traps, installing lights, and even temporarily moving into hotels or relative's homes, for safety in numbers. Overnight watches were kept, and tensions were high, with police questioning anyone who appeared suspect.|$|R
50|$|The City Council of Chicago {{passed a}} law {{requiring}} that a fire alarm box be installed in front of schools and other public assembly venues. The interior fire alarm systems of these buildings must {{be connected to the}} <b>street</b> fire <b>alarm</b> box. Another requirement was that all schools where it was deemed vital would have sprinkler systems installed. However, nine months later, in September 1959, Fire Commissioner Quinn, when interviewed by WNBQ reporter Len O'Connor, admitted that although 400 of the 1040 schools in Chicago at that time had been deemed in critical need of sprinkler systems, only two had actually had sprinklers installed.|$|R

6000|$|In {{the month}} of August was {{published}} anonymously the History of England, on which Goldsmith had been for some time employed. It was in four volumes, compiled chiefly, as he acknowledged in the preface, from Rapin, Carle, Smollett and Hume, [...] "each of whom," [...] says he, [...] "have their admirers, in proportion as the reader is studious of political antiquities, fond of minute anecdote, a warm partisan, or a deliberate reasoner." [...] It possessed {{the same kind of}} merit as his other historical compilations; a clear, succinct narrative, a simple, easy, and graceful style, and an agreeable arrangement of facts; but was not remarkable for either depth of observation or minute accuracy of research. Many passages were transferred, with little if any alteration, from his Letters from a Nobleman to his Son on the same subject. The work, though written without party feeling, met with sharp animadversions from political scribblers. The writer was charged with being unfriendly to liberty, disposed to elevate monarchy above its proper sphere; a tool of ministers; one who would betray his country for a pension. Tom Davies, the publisher, the pompous little bibliopole of Russell <b>Street,</b> <b>alarmed</b> lest the book should prove unsalable, undertook to protect it by his pen, and wrote a long article in its defense in [...] "The Public Advertiser." [...] He was vain of his critical effusion, and sought by nods and winks and innuendoes to intimate his authorship. [...] "Have you seen," [...] said he in a letter to a friend, [...] "'An Impartial Account of Goldsmith's History of England'? If you want to know who was the writer of it, you will find him in Russell Street--but mum!" ...|$|R
50|$|From their {{organization}} to 1894, {{the two companies}} operated independently although working close together. When Ansonia became a separate Town from Derby in 1889, the two fire departments continued to operate separately. The Borough of Ansonia financed the Eagle Hose, while the West Ansonia Fire District financed the Fountain Hose. Shortly after Ansonia was incorporated as a Town, the current <b>street</b> box fire <b>alarm</b> notification system was installed on the east side. The West Ansonia Fire District purchased a few fire alarm boxes for their district to be tied into the system.|$|R

Lord Sheffield suggested constructing ramparts along {{the eastern side of the}} city, which was open to attack, and warned that the rebels were crossing the river around Bishopsgate with ease.|$|R

He gave the shotgun to Doc Holliday who hid it under his overcoat. He took Holliday's walking-stick in return. From Spangenberg's, the Cowboys moved to the O.K. Corral where witnesses overheard them threatening to kill the Earps. They then walked a block north to an empty lot next to C. S. Fly's boarding house where Doc Holliday lived.|$|R

There, as we discover, our poor slim Louison Chabray, her poor nerves all fluttered, is arriving about this very hour.

They report, successively, to a wakeful Hotel-de-Ville what comfort they can report; which again, with early dawn, large comfortable Placards, shall impart to all men.|$|R
60|$|The scaling party {{mounted with}} {{difficulty}} and in small numbers; the sentinel was killed at his post, and seventy of the Moors {{made their way}} into the <b>streets</b> before an <b>alarm</b> was given. The guards rushed to the walls to stop the hostile throng that was still pouring in. A sharp conflict, hand to hand and man to man, took place on the battlements, and many on both sides fell. The Moors, whether wounded or slain, were thrown headlong without the walls, the scaling-ladders were overturned, and those who were mounting were dashed upon the rocks, and from thence tumbled upon the plain. Thus in a little while the ramparts were cleared by Christian prowess, led on by that valiant knight Don Alonzo Ponce, the uncle, and that brave esquire Pedro Pineda, nephew, of the marques of Cadiz.|$|R
5000|$|Each {{address in}} the city is {{assigned}} a box number, based on the closest street, special building or highway box.

5000|$|Charles Holzter {{founded the}} company as [...] "Holtzer Co." [...] and began {{manufacturing}} simple electrical devices such as doorbells and electric igniters. In 1880, Seth W. Fuller partnered with Holzter, and the company became known as [...] "Seth W. Fuller & Holtzer", and later as [...] "Fuller, Holtzer & Company". George E. Cabot joined the business, and Fuller left in 1889. The company then {{changed its name to}} [...] "Holtzer-Cabot", which remained their name until their closing. In 1891, the company built an electric car that sat four people and moved approximately 16 MPH. It was the first to feature a steering wheel, and is known as the first successful electric vehicle in America, though other unsuccessful prototypes had been built before. Around the turn of the 20th century, the company branched out to create various telephone/telegraph-related products, clocks, and fire alarm systems. They invented the first shunt-type fire alarm system, where a local alarm pulled in a building would also trigger the nearest municipal <b>street</b> fire <b>alarm</b> box. Most of their fire alarm systems were installed in hospitals, factories, and institutions. In 1927, Charles Holtzer died. Throughout World War II, the company branched out even more, but struggled to retain business. In 1972, the company officially closed its doors, and sold the remainder of their lines to Eastern Air Devices based in Dover NH (Now known as Electrocraft). The original factory in Jamaica Plain, MA still exists, but has now been converted to an apartment complex.|$|R

50|$|After {{the fire}} at Our Lady of the Angel, state {{regulations}} required {{that there had}} to be fire <b>alarm</b> <b>street</b> boxes no more than one hundred feet {{from the front of the}} building. The General Assembly of Illinois also passed life safety codes in response to the fire at Our Lady of the Angel. Things such as more control over waste disposal, proper storage of combustible supplies, more frequent fire drills and inspections were put in place. Other reforms from the fire include the city of Chicago modifying the Municipal Building Code of Chicago, affecting fire safety of schools as well as other buildings with two or more stories. To prevent fires and deaths caused by fires, schools must have an evacuation plan in place, and make sure that all the proper fire alarms and warnings work. Teachers must take charge of the situation and be a leader. Teachers should also consider the amount of students that they have. They need enough space and time to get all of the students out quickly, and safely. Teachers should also be the ones that are looking out for causes of fires, in order to try and stop it from happening.|$|R
50|$|From inception, the Penn Central {{consumed}} {{enormous amounts}} of cash in order to operate. Revenue generated from the various business units {{was not enough to}} cover operating expenses, but this fact was downplayed or denied by optimistic statements of management. To operate and keep up appearances, the Penn Central had to borrow money from Wall Street banks and financial firms. The corporate annual reports filed for 1968, 1969 and 1970, obscured the actual dire financial status of the company. At {{the end of the first}} year of operating, the Penn Central lost $150 million. The next two years were worse. Wall <b>Street</b> became increasingly <b>alarmed</b> at the losses and one by one, the banks refused to lend any more money. This forced the hand of the Penn Central Board of Directors, who voted on June 21, 1970, to file a Chapter 77 motion in the Federal bankruptcy court. The American financial system was shocked when after only two years of operations, the Penn Central Transportation Company was bankrupt. It was the largest corporate bankruptcy in American history at that time. Although the Penn Central Transportation Company was put into bankruptcy, its parent Penn Central Company was able to survive.|$|R

2500|$|Each {{address in}} the city is {{assigned}} a box number, based on the closest street, special building or highway box. The term [...] "box" [...] refers to the Fire Alarm Boxes, which at one time lined street corners {{and in front of}} certain buildings. Each Fire Alarm Box was given a specific number by the FDNY's Bureau of Communications. Even if the physical fire alarm box is no longer at a specific address or street corner, the address or street corner is still assigned that fire alarm box's number. Box numbers can be duplicated in different boroughs, which is why they are always identified by borough name or numerical prefix on the computer (66 for Bronx and Manhattan, 77 for Brooklyn, 88 for Staten Island and 99 for Queens). If there is also a street address given to the dispatchers, the responding apparatus will get this information in the firehouse, over the air, and via their mobile data terminals in the rigs, in addition to the Box number. At present there are about 16,000 physical fire <b>alarm</b> <b>street</b> boxes in New York City, with many additional special building boxes and highway boxes, as well as [...] "dummy boxes" [...] used for special response assignments. In addition there are two airport crash boxes, one in the LaGuardia Tower, (Queens Box 37), and one in the JFK Tower, (Queens Box 269), which can only be activated by the personnel in these towers. When either box is sounded it brings an automatic second alarm (2–2) response of equipment, along with various special units.|$|R
60|$|The {{electric}} bell rang three times, and we crept forward--halted--looked around, forward again--halt again--another look round; and so, yard by yard, we approached Colenso. Half {{a mile away}} we stopped finally. The officer, taking a sergeant with him, went on towards the village on foot. I followed. We soon reached the trenches {{that had been made}} by the British troops before they evacuated the place. 'Awful rot giving this place up,' said the officer. 'These lines took us a week to dig.' From here Colenso lay exposed about two hundred yards away--a silent, desolate village. The streets were littered with the belongings of the inhabitants. Two or three houses had been burned. A dead horse lay in the road, his four legs sticking stiffly up in the air, his belly swollen. The whole place had evidently been ransacked and plundered by the Boers and the Kaffirs. A few natives loitered near {{the far end of the}} <b>street,</b> and one, <b>alarmed</b> at the aspect of the train, waved a white rag on a stick steadily to and fro. But no Dutchmen were to be seen. We made our way back to the railway line and struck it at the spot where it was cut. Two lengths of rails had been lifted up, and, with the sleepers attached to them, flung over the embankment. The broken telegraph wires trailed untidily on the ground. Several of the posts were twisted. But the bridge across the Tugela was uninjured, and the damage to the lines was such as could be easily repaired. The Boers realise the advantage of the railway. At this moment, with their trains all labelled 'To Durban,' they are drawing supplies along it from Pretoria to within six miles of Ladysmith. They had resolved to use it in their further advance, and their confidence in the ultimate issue is shown by the care with which they avoid seriously damaging the permanent way. We had learned all that there was to learn--where the line was broken, that the village was deserted, that the bridge was safe, and we made haste to rejoin the train. Then the engine was reversed, and we withdrew out of range of the hills beyond Colenso at full speed--and some said that the Boers did not fire because they hoped to draw us nearer, and others that there were no Boers within ten miles.|$|R
5000|$|City fire {{departments}} {{were in their}} infancy in 1883 and for an individual to lead both the police and {{fire departments}} was an innovation in Hereford. Soon after his arrival, he wrote to the Mayor of Hereford referring to the possible appointment of seven men as firemen. Up until this time policemen carried out fire-fighting, and he wanted a new situation whereby if policemen arrived first at a fire, they would fight the fire but {{give way to the}} firemen when they arrived. The letter also suggests that both the police officers and the seven new firemen men should receive training as fire-fighters. This was agreed by the Watch Committee of Hereford City Council. After further discussion, the seven fire fighters were integrated into the police force, using them as constables when there were no fires to be fought. Richardson also introduced a new grey uniform for the fire fighters. A post boy was employed as a runner; one of his duties was to run to the Merton Meadows or the Green Dragon Public House in Broad Street, Hereford, to collect two horses to pull a steam driven fire engine named the Nell Gwynne. A charge of five pounds five shillings was made for attendance of the steam fire engine. The fire station had a bell which was tolled to call the fireman out. The seven firemen each had houses in DeLacey <b>Street</b> and electric <b>alarm</b> bells were installed. The Chief Constable also had an electric bell installed at Security Villa which alerted him of a fire. Also a horse and gig cart from the Security Villa's own small stable was made ready by a policeman. In later years, a taxi would automatically arrive at the front door, again, summoned by the duty police officer. Richardson took great pride in his creation. Apart from the grey uniform, red piping was later added, plus three sets of fire headgear, boots and axes and a motto [...] "Always Ready". In 1885 300 yards of canvas hose, couplings and stand pipes and a [...] "telescopic fire escape" [...] were added to the equipment. [...] This made the use of the old leather buckets obsolete. He distributed hand-held [...] "fire extinguishers", patented in 1868, to public and larger buildings. These contained about a gallon of water in a sealed glass container within a smaller metal canister. There was a weak point created {{at the top of the}} glass and the idea was to throw it on the fire where it would spray water. In 1907 a severe fire broke out at Rotherwas House, a country gentleman's mansion with an historic chapel, just outside the city limits. Richardson broke the councils rules by rushing to the scene and prevented the blaze from spreading. Horses pulled fire engines in Hereford until 1908 when a motorized unit was purchased. As a further refinement the 1912 [...] "list of beats" [...] for the city police showed that certain city centre night beats were designated [...] "fire escape beats". These were the areas with a higher risk of fire and ensured a rapid response for the heart of the city. This arrangement continued until the 1930s. The officers on the special beat list occupied a row of houses in DeLacy Street, adjacent to the police and fire stations.|$|R
