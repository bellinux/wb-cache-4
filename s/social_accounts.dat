Only rough estimates of strength are possible, since humans tend to follow patterns in such tasks, and those patterns can usually assist an attacker. In addition, lists of commonly chosen passwords are widely available for use by password guessing programs. Such lists include the numerous online dictionaries for various human languages, breached databases of plaintext and hashed passwords from various online business and <b>social</b> <b>accounts,</b> along with other common passwords. All items in such lists are considered weak, as are passwords that are simple modifications of them. For some decades, investigations of passwords on multi-user computer systems have shown that 40% or more are readily guessed using only computer programs, and more can be found when information about a particular user is taken into account during the attack.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{conceptual}} objection is, {{that the}} distinctions between productive and unproductive labor offered by various Marxists are essentially arbitrary, and without a genuine, scientifically sound foundation. In a complex division of labor, specialist productive work relies on a network of indispensable managerial, facilitary and technical support services, without which it could not take place at all. Marx himself never said that managerial functions were wholly [...] "unproductive", but rather that they combined productive and unproductive tasks. He {{pointed out that there}} were continually disputes about whether labour was productive or not, depending on who could make money from it – and that in turn depended on how the accounting was done as well as on property rights. Whether workers physically and directly produce something tangible or not, they are all necessary, or at least most of them are (as Marx acknowledges with his concept of the [...] "collective worker" [...] or, in German, Gesamtarbeiter). It is therefore impossible to attribute the creation of new value only to workers who directly produce a tangible product. Marxists often assume in their <b>social</b> <b>accounts</b> that the total payment of unproductive labor is made from a redistribution of part of the current surplus value produced by productive labor, but there is no proof of that assumption whatsoever, and indeed some Marxists have argued that the [...] "overhead expense" [...] of unproductive labor represents an outlay of circulating constant capital. David Ramsay Steele has defended the productive economic role of financial markets.|$|E
2500|$|Biologist Richard Lewontin {{asserts that}} patriarchy {{persists}} through {{social and political}} reasons, rather than purely scientific reasons. Some opponents of gender feminism have argued that patriarchy has its origin in biological factors. This is called biological determinism, which looks at humanity from a strictly biological point of view. Thus, the evolution of science in a patriarchal society's focus begins with man and woman. The male testosterone hormone is, for instance, known to greatly enhance risk taking behaviour; which can generate increased status in groups if successful (balanced with an equal increase in number of failures, with potential losses of status or death as result). The potential magnitude, frequency and longevity of the increased status from a hormonally driven risk-taking success depends on opportunities, which increases rapidly with societal complexity. A hypothetical patriarchal culture based primarily on a hormonally-driven increased rate of male successes, thus require a certain critical level of societal evolution before it could evolve. Other proponents of this theory posit that because of a woman's biology, she is more fit to perform roles such as anonymous child-rearing at home, rather than high-profile decision-making roles, such as leaders in battles. Through this simple basis, [...] "the existence of a sexual division of labor in primitive societies is a starting point as much for purely <b>social</b> <b>accounts</b> {{of the origins of}} patriarchy as for biological". [...] Hence, the rise of patriarchy is recognized through this apparent [...] "sexual division." [...] Although patriarchy exists within the scientific atmosphere, [...] "the period over which women would have been at a physiological disadvantage in participation in hunting through being at a late stage pregnancy or early stage of child-rearing would have been small", [...] {{during the time of the}} nomads, patriarchy still grew with power. Lewontin and others argue that such biological determinism unjustly limits women. In his study, he states women behave a certain way not because they are biologically inclined to, but rather because they are judged by [...] "how well they conform to the stereotypical local image of femininity". Feminists believe that people have gendered biases, which are perpetuated and enforced across generations by those who benefit from them. [...] For instance, it has historically been claimed that women cannot make rational decisions during their menstrual periods. This claim cloaks the fact that men also have periods of time where they can be aggressive and irrational; furthermore, unrelated effects of aging and similar medical problems are often blamed on menopause, amplifying its reputation. [...] These biological traits and others specific to women, such as their ability to get pregnant, are often used against them as an attribute of weakness.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – This paper adds to a {{focus of}} the <b>social</b> <b>accounting</b> {{literature}} (on perceptions and attitudes to <b>social</b> <b>accounting)</b> by seeking to offer insights into Syrian accountants' attitudes towards, and perceptions of, <b>social</b> <b>accounting</b> in Syria {{in the first decade}} of the twenty-first century, with particular attention to its role, future development and implementation. Design/methodology/approach – The paper takes the form of an analysis of interviews of Syrian accountants; contextual analysis (and an appreciation of the prior literature). Findings – Syrian accountants' perceptions are shaped by developments in Syria's socio-political and economic context, encompassing imperialism/colonialism, globalisation and cultural specificities, including Islam. Interviewees perceived a significant role for a <b>social</b> <b>accounting</b> – that would parallel the Western form of <b>social</b> <b>accounting</b> – in enhancing well-being in the dynamic context. At the same time, they were reluctant to see the development and implementation of this accounting in Syria as an urgent issue, so that this <b>social</b> <b>accounting</b> might be left initially at least with an even more marginal part to play than in the West. The study suggests that a combination of forces – global developments, Western imperialism and Syria's colonial history – have had a substantively repressive rather than progressive impact on the development of <b>social</b> <b>accounting</b> in Syria vis-à-vis its more positive potential. Research limitations/implications – All limitations of interview research apply. This study focuses on Syria in a context when economic transition was a major issue. Further studies of economies in transition would be of interest. Practical implications – An awareness of how the local and the global interact in debates over <b>social</b> <b>accounting</b> can provide insights for policy makers concerned with accounting regulation.

40|$|Rachunkowość społeczna w świetle badań polskich autorów The aim of {{the article}} is to present the essence and {{prerequisites}} of <b>social</b> <b>accounting</b> {{in the light of}} Polish authors' research. Initially, <b>social</b> <b>accounting</b> developed as a statistical-economic discipline used to capture economic processes on a macroeconomic scale. <b>Social</b> <b>accounting</b> in the micro scale became popular in the late 1970 s with the increasing importance of corporate social responsibility. Therefore, the author decided to separate considerations on the essence and development of <b>social</b> <b>accounting</b> in macro- and microeconomic contexts in the article. The analysis shows that studies on the development of <b>social</b> <b>accounting</b> on the macroeconomic scale were conducted in post-war Poland by Peche and Kowalczyk. <b>Accounting</b> of <b>social</b> responsibility (also referred to as <b>social</b> <b>accounting)</b> in micro terms has been discussed since the 1980 s.

40|$|Different {{stakeholders}} are now {{showing a}} higher interest in organisations’ social responsibility than ever before, creating an increased pressure on organisations' sustainability performance. Various researchers (e. g. Emerson, 2003; Lingane & Olsen, 2004) stress {{that in order}} to meet this pressure and to achieve a true sustainable development, organisations need to fully incorporate social values through <b>social</b> <b>accounting.</b> Although numerous organisations report on their social impacts (Hahn & Kühnen, 2013), it is often said that small to medium sized enterprises (SMEs) are lagging behind in terms of sustainability performance (Cassells & Lewis, 2011). A few studies have addressed this by investigating difficulties for social enterprises to conduct <b>social</b> <b>accounting</b> but a research gap is evident regarding practical implications for SMEs in the for-profit sector. Through an embedded case study design of a sustainability network of for-profit SMEs on Gotland, we sought to explain SME managers perception of difficulties and benefits associated with <b>social</b> <b>accounting,</b> and how such attitudes relate to their sustainability practices. Through a triangulation design, surveys and qualitative interviews were applied to determine the relationship between attitudes and actions. A theoretical framework by Thomas and Lamm (2012), based on Ajzen’s (2005) theory of planned behaviour and Suchman’s (1995) typology of legitimacies was used for analysis. The SME managers were found to have a neutral attitude towards <b>social</b> <b>accounting</b> and they all engaged in practical actions rather than social impact measurement or social reporting. Thus, the results reflect consistency between attitudes towards <b>social</b> <b>accounting</b> and actions, i. e. the intention to perform <b>social</b> <b>accounting.</b> The SME managers perceived the difficulties of <b>social</b> <b>accounting</b> to outweigh the benefits of it, and were insecure about their abilities to perform <b>social</b> <b>accounting.</b> The findings of this study could confirm previously found implications of <b>social</b> <b>accounting</b> and further found that the SME managers expected additional difficulties for companies in the service sector and for those without employees...|$|R
