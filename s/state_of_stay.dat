40|$|The ingestive {{behavior}} patterns were evaluated using nine sheep 1 / 2 Texel + 1 / 2 Ile-de-France over a six-month period, Sheep were fed the diet at 9 a. m. and 4 p. m. which was composed by 250 g of concentrate (15. 45 % CP, 36. 54 % NDF) and ad libitum grass hay (6. 69 % CP, 69. 10 % NDF). The ingestive behavior was continuously measured by five days per period, and its activities or states {{were classified as}} eating, ruminating or idling, and sequentially registered. The time series was necessarily transformed in discrete variable, in the probability estimates, which incorporated the probabilities {{of being in a}} given <b>state,</b> <b>of</b> <b>staying</b> in that <b>state</b> and <b>of</b> changing from a state to another one. The probabilities were estimated at different times without assuming the stationary presumption, The 5 minutes time sampling interval was considered the most adequate as compared to 7 and 10 minutes, with less information lost especially in relation to the changes <b>of</b> <b>states.</b> The probability values <b>of</b> being or <b>staying</b> in a given state were higher than transition state probabilities. Measurement periods showed significant differences in overall mean probabilities values partially related to changes in voluntary intake due to photoperiod effect...|$|R

Ingestive behavior was continuously measured {{for five days}} per period, and its activities or states were classified as eating, ruminating or idling, and sequentially registered. The probability estimates incorporated three types: The probabilities {{of being in a}} given <b>state,</b> <b>of</b> <b>staying</b> in a given <b>state</b> and <b>of</b> changing from a state to another one. Finite Fourier transformation was applied to the series of probabilities estimated at each five minutes, during 22 hours per day. In the nyeterohemeral probabilities distribution study, it was used the analysis of periodgrams, phase diagrams and analysis of variance upon the transformed values of the probabilities series. The analysis of variance showed that all probability types followed a nycterohemeral distribution, and it was significantly affected by experimental period and animals at several frequencies. Analysis of periodgrams and phase diagrams showed that differences between the experimental periods and animals was mainly due to differences in the amplitude of trigonometric functions that described the nycterohemeral distribution of probabilities <b>of</b> being or <b>staying</b> in a given state. The day moment, the experimental period and individuals affected the nycterohemeral distribution <b>of</b> the transition <b>state</b> probabilities...|$|R
