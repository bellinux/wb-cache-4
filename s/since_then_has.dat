The ALP and the Liberal Party have always held one Senate seat each.|$|E

5|$|Much of the {{research}} into the properties of neptunium <b>since</b> <b>then</b> <b>has</b> been focused on understanding how to confine it as a portion of nuclear waste. Because it has isotopes with very long half-lives, it is of particular concern {{in the context of}} designing confinement facilities that can last for thousands of years. It has found some limited uses as a radioactive tracer and a precursor for various nuclear reactions to produce useful plutonium isotopes. However, most of the neptunium that is produced as a reaction byproduct in nuclear power stations {{is considered to be a}} waste product.|$|E
5|$|Since 1971, the Republic of China (Taiwan) {{has been}} {{excluded}} from the UN and <b>since</b> <b>then</b> <b>has</b> always been rejected in new applications. Citizens of this country are also not allowed to enter the buildings of the United Nations with the passport of Taiwan. In this way, critics agree that the UN is failing its own development goals and guidelines. This criticism also brought pressure from the People's Republic of China, which regards the territories administered by Taiwan as their own territory.|$|E

It remained the dominant language of Ireland {{for most of}} those periods, having influences from Latin, Old Norse, French and English. It declined under British rule but remained the majority tongue until the early 19th century, and <b>since</b> <b>then</b> <b>has</b> been a minority language.|$|E

5|$|The current bridge along Grand Avenue {{over the}} Colorado River and I-70 {{just east of}} the highway's western {{terminus}} dates to 1953. It was built as a two-lane bridge with shoulders; expansion <b>since</b> <b>then</b> <b>has</b> added a second lane in either direction.

5|$|This puffball was {{originally}} described in 1790 by French botanist Jean Baptiste François Pierre Bulliard as Lycoperdon utriforme, and <b>since</b> <b>then,</b> <b>has</b> been variously {{placed in the}} genera Bovista, Lycoperdon, Calvatia, and Utraria. In 1989, German mycologist Hanns Kreisel described the genus Handkea to include species of Calvatia that had distinct microscopic features: Handkea species have a unique type of capillitium (coarse thick-walled hyphae in the gleba), with curvy slits {{instead of the usual}} pores. Although accepted by some authors, the genus concept has been rejected by others.|$|E
5|$|Though Joehana's {{works were}} {{published}} independently, they were {{popular in the}} Bandung area where they were sold. Local businesses may have offered funds for product placement, and Joehana's works were adapted to the stage and film. However, they received little academic attention until the 1960s, and critical consensus <b>since</b> <b>then</b> <b>has</b> been negative. Two of his works have been republished since the 1960s, and stage productions of his novel Rasiah nu Goreng Patut continued into the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Whereas the ACT's federal electorates {{have been}} mainly held by Labor, the Liberal Party {{has been able}} to gain some footing in the ACT Assembly, and were in {{government}} for just over eight of the Assembly's 21-year history. Most of this was during a period of six and half years from 1995 and 2001, which ended when Labor gained a 14.1% swing at the polls. In contrast to the state elections, Labor has polled at least seven percentage points more than the Liberals at every federal election since 1990, and their average lead <b>since</b> <b>then</b> <b>has</b> been 15 percentage points.|$|E

5|$|Both the IRFU and WIFU {{suspended}} {{operations in}} 1942 {{due to the}} Second World War. Grey Cup play {{was expected to be}} suspended along with the unions; however, the military felt the game and sport would serve as a morale booster and organized teams at bases across the country. For the following three years, Grey Cup competition was limited to military teams, and in the 1942 Grey Cup, the Toronto RCAF Hurricanes defeated the Winnipeg RCAF Bombers 8–5 to become the first non-civilian team to win the national championship. Two years later, the St. Hyacinthe–Donnacona Navy defeated the Hamilton Flying Wildcats, 7–6; no Grey Cup championship <b>since</b> <b>then</b> <b>has</b> featured two eastern teams. The conclusion of the war led to the reformation of civilian teams; the IRFU resumed play in 1945, and the WIFU the following year.|$|E
5|$|By 2014, OR-7 {{had settled}} in the Rogue River {{watershed}} in the southern Cascade Range east of Medford, Oregon, with a mate. It is not known when the two wolves met, but DNA tests of fecal samples showed that she is related to wolves {{in two of the}} eight packs in northeastern Oregon. In early 2015, officials designated the two adult wolves and their offspring as the Rogue Pack, the first wolf pack in western Oregon and the state's ninth overall since wolves returned to Oregon from Idaho in the 1990s. The batteries in OR-7's tracking collar expired in October 2015, and monitoring the pack <b>since</b> <b>then</b> <b>has</b> depended on trail cameras and live sightings. Meanwhile, other wolves have migrated into the mountainous cross-border region, and relatives of OR–7 have formed two packs in northern California.|$|E
