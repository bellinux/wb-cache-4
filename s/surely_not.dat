500|$|Within hours, Rudd and Dreyer were hurrying {{south to}} present the {{document}} to Rhodes, travelling by mule cart, the fastest mode of transport available. Thompson and Maguire stayed in Bulawayo to defend the concession against potential challenges. Rudd reached Kimberley and Rhodes on 19 November 1888, a mere 20 days after the document's signing, and commented with great satisfaction that this marked a record that would <b>surely</b> <b>not</b> be broken until the railway was laid into the interior. Rhodes was elated by Rudd's results, describing the concession as [...] "so gigantic it is like giving a man the whole of Australia". Both in high spirits, the pair travelled to Cape Town by train, and presented themselves to Robinson on 21 November.|$|E
500|$|The book {{arose from}} a series of {{articles}} written over the winter of 1898 for the Yorkshire Evening Post, in which he interviewed former players and reflected their experiences after retirement. Encountering the desperate circumstances in which many former players lived, Pullin was moved to campaign on their behalf. Hodgson suggests that he [...] "did not mince his words... He held a deep regard for the players, and found it difficult to contemplate the forlorn situation and desperate straits that several of the old Yorkshire cricketers he interviewed were faced with." [...] When investigating the whereabouts of John Thewlis, Pullin was told [...] "Think dead; if not, Manchester". Pullin later wrote about Thewlis: [...] "The moral responsibilities of cricket managers, so far as a player is concerned, should <b>surely</b> <b>not</b> end with the termination of his active career. He ought not to be cast aside like an old shoe." ...|$|E

GameSpot regarded Kratos as a [...] "sympathetic antihero" [...] and a [...] "badass", and {{described him as}} endearing due to his unforgiving demeanor, but added that the slowly-developing story offered players [...] "no understanding [...] " [...] in the game's early stages. IGN said he was ruthless, merciless and savage, noting the character's main motive is vengeance and [...] "all he desires is murder." [...] IGN also stated that in time the player would begin to [...] "love and loathe Kratos and hate Ares." [...] GamePro said it was [...] "Kratos' tragic fall and brutal ascension to the peaks of Mount Olympus that made the original God of War so memorable." [...] PlayStation Universe said he was [...] "certainly a unique character and a warrior to be reckoned with," [...] and that [...] "this iconic PlayStation anti-hero will <b>surely</b> <b>not</b> be forgotten." ...|$|E

500|$|The UANC {{delegation}} was led, as expected, by Muzorewa {{and included}} Sithole representing ZANU, Nkomo for ZAPU and James Chikerema, the former ZAPU vice-president, {{for a third}} militant party, the Front for the Liberation of Zimbabwe. According to Rhodesian intelligence, the various nationalist factions had not patched up their differences, were not prepared to accept Muzorewa as their leader and, to this end, were hoping that the conference failed to produce an agreement. The Rhodesians relayed these concerns to Pretoria, which told them firmly that the UANC would <b>surely</b> <b>not</b> risk losing the support of Kaunda and the Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere by deliberately sabotaging the peace process. When the Rhodesians persisted in their complaints, citing evidence of nationalist infighting in Lusaka, the South Africans were terser still, eventually wiring Salisbury: [...] "If you don't like what we are offering, you always have the alternative of going it alone!" ...|$|E
500|$|The show's {{popularity}} {{resulted in}} enquiries for coats similar to Sherlock's, reported retailer Debenhams. Garment manufacturer Belstaff put the wool trench coat worn by Benedict Cumberbatch back into production before the series had ended. The Independent reported, [...] "designer Paul Costelloe moved {{to meet the}} demand, offering tailored coats and scarves based on the series, while Savile Row bespoke tailor John Pearse said many of his clients were inquiring about the actors' clothes." [...] Journalist Alexis Petridis commented, [...] "ou can see why men {{wanted to get the}} look. Perhaps they noted the effect Cumberbatch, by no means your standard telly hunk, had on lady viewers … and decided it must {{have something to do with}} the clobber. So it is that Britain's latest men's style icon is a fictional asexual sociopath first seen onscreen hitting a corpse with a horse whip. <b>Surely</b> <b>not</b> even the great detective himself could have deduced that was going to happen." ...|$|E
500|$|Stein {{wrote in}} The Mismeasure of Desire (1999) that Sexual Preference {{is one of}} the most {{detailed}} and frequently cited retrospective studies relating to sexual orientation. In Stein's view, while the study has been criticized on various grounds, including that all of its subjects were living in San Francisco, arguably an atypical place with respect to the sexual orientation of its inhabitants, Bell et al.′s conclusions about theories attributing sexual orientation to the effects of experience have been accepted and confirmed. Stein observed that many other studies have been conducted on childhood gender nonconformity partly because of Bell et al.′s findings relating it to homosexuality. The psychologists Stanton L. Jones and Mark Yarhouse called Sexual Preference a famous study, writing that Bell et al.′s data suggest that mothers have only a weak influence on the development of homosexuality, and that their work is therefore [...] "sometimes thought of as the study that discredited the psychoanalytic theory." [...] Jones and Yarhouse observed that in Bell et al.′s sample [...] "considerably more homosexual males reported fathers who were detached or not affectionate than did heterosexual men". They concluded that, [...] "While clearly not providing definitive support for the psychoanalytic hypothesis, this study is <b>surely</b> <b>not</b> the refutation of that hypothesis that it is sometimes supposed to be." ...|$|E

2500|$|Drinan {{continued}} to be a vocal supporter of abortion rights, much to the ire of some of the Catholic hierarchy, and notably spoke out in support of President Bill Clinton's veto of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act in 1996. In his weekly column for the Catholic New York, Cardinal John O'Connor sharply denounced Drinan.

2500|$|George {{developed}} {{what he saw}} as {{a crucial}} feature of his own theory of economics in a critique of an illustration used by Frédéric Bastiat in order to explain the nature of interest and profit. Bastiat had asked his readers to consider James and William, both carpenters. James has built himself a plane, and has lent it to William for a year. Would James be satisfied with the return of an equally good plane a year later? <b>Surely</b> <b>not!</b> He'd expect a board along with it, as interest. The basic idea of a theory of interest is to understand why. Bastiat said that James had given William over that year [...] "the power, inherent in the instrument, to increase the productivity of his labor," [...] and wants compensation for that increased productivity.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{question}} as to whether defense is a public good. Murray Rothbard argues, [...] "'national defense' is <b>surely</b> <b>not</b> an absolute good with only one unit of supply. It consists of specific resources committed in certain definite and concrete ways—and these resources are necessarily scarce. A ring of defense bases around New York, for example, cuts down the amount possibly available around San Francisco." [...] Jeffrey Rogers Hummel and Don Lavoie note, [...] "Americans in Alaska and Hawaii could very easily be excluded from the U.S. government's defense perimeter, and doing so might enhance the military value of at least conventional U.S. forces to Americans in the other forty-eight states. But, in general, an additional ICBM in the U.S. arsenal can simultaneously protect everyone within the country without diminishing its services".|$|E

In 2004, Newman requested that Princeton University disassociate the event from his name, {{due to the fact that}} he did not endorse the behavior, citing his creation in 1980 of the Scott Newman Centre, [...] "dedicated to the prevention of substance abuse through education". [...] Princeton disavowed any responsibility for the event, responding that Newman Day is not sponsored, endorsed, or encouraged by the university itself and is solely an unofficial event among students.|$|E
2500|$|The Rabbis of the Midrash {{debated whether}} {{the report of}} [...] “And the Lord was ( [...] , vayehi) with Joseph,” {{signified}} an occurrence of trouble or joy.
