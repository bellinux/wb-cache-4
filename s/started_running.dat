5|$|The tunnel {{was officially}} opened on 30 May 1980 by Minister of Transport and Communications Ronald Bye and officially taken into use on 1 June. The tunnel, {{including}} Nationaltheatret, cost NOK 625 million Norwegian krone (NOK), of which Oslo Municipality had paid NOK170 million. At first, {{the tunnel and}} Nationaltheatret was used by commuter trains from Lillestrøm to Drammen and Spikkestad, and trains from Eidsvoll and Årnes used the tunnel and turned at Skøyen. On 27 May 1989, OsloV was closed and all traffic <b>started</b> <b>running</b> via Nationaltheatret.|$|E
5|$|Because of delays from Stadler's subcontractors, five {{instead of}} eight trams were {{available}} when the line opened on 22 June 2010. Skyss {{had planned to}} operate with a ten-minute headway until August, but had a 15-minute headway until 16 August. To compensate, none of the parallel bus routes ceased until then. On 7 June, two trams collided at low speed at Byparken, causing a derailment and forced the two trams to be repaired. This caused the summer schedule to {{be reduced to a}} 30-minute headway. From 1 November, the line <b>started</b> <b>running</b> every six minutes during the rush hour. On 22 June, {{the first part of the}} line was officially opened by Queen Sonja of Norway.|$|E

5|$|Eight {{additional}} Pendolinos {{were ordered}} {{at the end}} 1997 {{at the price of}} FIM 77 million per train (€13 million). They were delivered between 2000 and 2002. The main series trains differed in various ways from the prototypes. The new trains allowed Pendolino traffic to extend: they <b>started</b> <b>running</b> between Helsinki and Jyväskylä on 22 October 2001. In June 2002, the network was expanded further, and routes were continued from Tampere onwards to Oulu and from Jyväskylä to Kuopio. One of the main series trains (number 7x08) was damaged during maritime transport in October 2001. The badly secured train had come loose during a storm on the Atlantic, almost causing the loss of M/S Traden, the ship carrying it. Thanks to good actions of the ship's crew, it was able to reach Le Havre and the train was sent back to Italy to be repaired.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, {{ridership}} {{increased by}} 10 percent and by 12 percent the following year. In 1971 and 1972, it saw a 20-percent increase—the latter representing {{the first year}} with InterRail tickets. By then the annual ridership had reached 175,000. In 1970, an additional train was stationed at Flåm, which {{made it possible to}} travel a round trip between Flåm and Bergen in a day. Between 1975 and 1982, NSB <b>started</b> <b>running</b> direct trains between Ål and Flåm. In 1978, the morning express trains on the Bergen Line started stopping at Myrdal, allowing better access for tourists to the Flåm Line. Traffic increased further until 1980, when it hit 200,000, and then remained stable through the decade.|$|E
5|$|In the 1985 Indianapolis 500, he {{was passed}} {{for the lead}} by Danny Sullivan in Turn One on lap 139. Immediately after {{completing}} the pass, Sullivan spun in front of Andretti. A caution for the spin, minimized the time Sullivan would lose to Andretti by pitting to replace 20 laps later Sullivan took the lead for good when he passed Andretti without incident. Andretti dominated the 1987 Indianapolis 500, leading 170 of the first 177 laps of the race. His lead was so large, that he was advised to slow his pace to preserve his equipment. In a cruel twist of fate, when Andretti <b>started</b> <b>running</b> slower, his reduced engine rpm's created a harmonic imbalance in his turbocharged Ilmor/Chevrolet V8 {{that led to a}} broken valve spring with 20 laps to go.|$|E

5|$|On February 24, 2016, the MTA {{allocated}} $66 {{million to}} speed up the construction of the first phase so that it could open in December. However, by June, the project was not being built at a rate that would allow a December 2016 completion. Concerns about the line's timely opening persisted through October and November, with key systems such as elevators, escalators, and fire alarms not having been tested. The third rail was energized and test trains began running through the new line on October 9, 2016, with weights to simulate rush hour loads; non-revenue Q trains, taken out of service at 57th Street–Seventh Avenue, <b>started</b> <b>running</b> through the subway in November 2016.|$|E
5|$|The Stoics {{sought to}} be free of the unruly emotions, which they {{regarded}} as being contrary to nature. The passions or emotions (pathe) are the disturbing element in right judgment. Chrysippus wrote a whole book concerning the therapy of the emotions. The passions are like diseases which depress and crush the soul, thus he sought to eradicate them (apatheia). Wrong judgements turn into passions when they gather an impetus of their own, just as, when one has <b>started</b> <b>running,</b> it is difficult to stop. One cannot hope to eradicate the emotions when one is in the heat of love or anger: this can only be done when one is calm. Therefore, one should prepare in advance, and deal with the emotions in the mind as if they were present. By applying reason to emotions such as greed, pride, or lust, one can understand the harm which they cause.|$|E
5|$|The {{first part}} of the line, {{originally}} a light rail, was from Majorstuen to Smestad, and opened in 1912. It was built as a cooperation between the Municipality of Aker and the company Holmenkolbanen, and connected to the Holmenkoll Line's terminus. In 1928, the line received a connection to the city center when the {{first part of}} the Common Tunnel was completed. In 1935, the first extension of the Røa Line proper was made, when the line was extended to Røa. In 1942, the Kolsås Line became a branch. Additional extensions to the Røa Line were made in 1948 to Grini, in 1951 to Lijordet and in 1972 to Østerås. By then, the line had become an integrated part of the municipal Oslo Sporveier. The line was upgraded to rapid transit in 1995, became part of the metro and <b>started</b> <b>running</b> through the city center.|$|E

5|$|The first {{plans for}} a line through Numedal were {{launched}} after the Sørland Line reached in Kongsberg in 1871. After {{it was decided that}} the Bergen Line would instead follow Hallingdal, the Numedal plans lay dead until it was decided that a railway was necessary to build two hydroelectric power stations near Rødberg. The plans were passed in 1918, the first trains <b>started</b> <b>running</b> in 1924 and the line was officially opened in 1927. At first all services were provided with steam locomotives, but from the 1930s diesel multiple units were used for passenger trains. The line was frequented with classes Cmd 16, 86, 87 and 91. The last regular train ran in 1988; since, there has been sporadic freight service and some heritage trains running from Kongsberg to Rollag. Draisine rental is available on the section from Veggli to Rødberg.|$|E
5|$|In 1932, No.1 FTS <b>started</b> <b>running</b> {{two courses}} each year, the first commencing in January {{and the second}} in July; it also ceased graduating non-commissioned {{officers}} as pilots, and thus took on a character resembling the other armed services' cadet colleges, the Royal Australian Naval College and the Royal Military College, Duntroon. The roughly 1,200 applications for each flying course competed for around twelve places. Wing Commander Hippolyte DeLa Rue became commanding officer in early 1933. The following year, No.1 FTS commenced regular courses in signals, photography, air observation, and aircraft maintenance. In April 1936, the school took delivery of its first Avro Cadets, procured as an intermediate trainer {{to bridge the gap}} between the Gipsy Moth employed for elementary flying instruction and the Wapiti used for advanced training. De La Rue was succeeded by Wing Commander Frank Lukis in January 1938. By this time the school was training up to 96 new pilots per year, a small percentage of whom were slated for secondment to the RAF on short-service commissions. Link Trainer simulators were introduced in March 1939.|$|E
5|$|Operation of {{the first}} subway began on October 27, 1904, {{with the opening of}} all {{stations}} from City Hall to 145th Street on the West Side Branch. Service was extended to 157th Street on November 12, 1904, as that station's opening had been delayed because of painting and plastering work. The West Side Branch was extended northward to a temporary terminus at 221st Street and Broadway on March 12, 1906 served by shuttle trains operating between 157th Street and 221st Street. However, only the Dyckman Street, 215th Street, and 221st Street stations opened on that date as the other stations were not yet completed. The 168th Street station opened on April 14, 1906. The 181st Street station opened on May 30, 1906, and on that date express trains on the Broadway branch began running through to 221st Street, eliminating the need to transfer at 157th Street to shuttles. The station at 207th Street was completed in 1906, but since it was located in a sparsely occupied area, it did not open until April 1, 1907. The original system as included in Contract 1 was completed on January 14, 1907, when trains <b>started</b> <b>running</b> across the Harlem Ship Canal on the Broadway Bridge to 225th Street, and the nearby 221st Street station was closed.|$|E

5|$|As North Korean {{soldiers}} advanced, {{they began}} to envelop both A and B Companies, and 30 minutes after the first shots were fired, both companies were ordered to withdraw, one platoon at a time. C Company, kept in reserve during the engagement, retreated without coming in contact with North Korean forces. A Company, under the heaviest attack, attempted a gradual withdrawal which quickly became disorderly, as men ran from the hill, some without weapons and ammunition, being strafed by North Korean machine guns the entire time. Panic quickly overtook {{many of the men}} of the battalion, and they <b>started</b> <b>running</b> past the designated rally points, all the way to Pyongtaek. Others, too scared to retreat, remained in their foxholes and were captured by the North Korean forces. One officer attempted to stay behind and search for survivors, before he and three others were allegedly captured and executed by North Korean forces. Company commanders gathered what men they could and began moving south, though one-fourth of 1st Battalion was killed, missing or captured immediately after the brief fight. The retreating elements left a trail of equipment behind, littering the road back to Pyongtaek with ammunition, helmets, and rain gear. In the disorderly retreat one platoon from A Company was left behind, and had to retreat through a railway for cover.|$|E
5|$|Jamaica-born former Clemson University athlete Cydonie Mothersill {{qualified}} for the women's 200meter dash and participated {{on behalf of the}} Cayman Islands. 30 {{years old at the time}} of the Beijing Olympics, Mothersill had been participating in the Olympics since she was 18 at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. She also attended the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney and the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, but only <b>started</b> <b>running</b> her present event in Sydney. In Beijing, Mothersill participated in the first round of her event on 18 August, where she was placed in Heat 1 versus the United States' Muna Lee and France's Muriel Hurtis-Houari. Mothersill ranked third in the heat with a time of 22.76seconds, placing behind Hurtis-Houari by 0.04seconds. Overall, Mothersill ranked third in the event out of 48 athletes, behind Lee and Hurtis-Houari. She progressed to the 19 August second round and was placed in Heat 1, which included Jamaica's Veronica Campbell and the Bahamas' Debbie Ferguson. Mothersill ranked fourth of eight, earning a time of 22.83seconds. She fell behind Ferguson by 0.06seconds, and placed ahead of fifth place heat finalist Ionela Tirlea of Romania by 0.29seconds. Cydonie Mothersill tied Muna Lee in Round 2 for ninth place out of 32 athletes. Mothersill {{qualified for}} semifinals on 20 August, and was placed in Heat 2. Mothersill ranked fourth out of eight, this time running the event in 22.61seconds and falling behind Jamaican Sherone Simpson and American Marshevet Hooker by 0.11seconds, but beating Hurtis-Houari by 0.1seconds. Mothersill ranked ninth in the event out of sixteen. During the final races, Mothersill ran the event in 22.68seconds, and ranked eighth overall.|$|E
