5000|$|Epistemic {{uncertainty}}: Epistemic {{uncertainty is}} also known as <b>systematic</b> <b>uncertainty,</b> and is due to things one could in principle know but doesn't in practice. This may be because a measurement is not accurate, because the model neglects certain effects, or because particular data has been deliberately hidden. An example of a source of this uncertainty would be the drag in an experiment designed to measure the acceleration of gravity near the earth's surface. The commonly used gravitational acceleration of 9.8 m/s^2 ignores the effects of air resistance, but the air resistance for the object could be measured and incorporated into the experiment to reduce the resulting uncertainty in the calculation of the gravitational acceleration.|$|E
50|$|The largest <b>systematic</b> <b>uncertainty</b> {{in using}} galaxy {{clusters}} to study cosmology {{comes from the}} mass-observable relation. Theories predict galaxy cluster masses, while experiments measure different observable quantities (i.e. optical richness) for galaxy clusters. The mass-observable relation for the DES will be calibrated directly using weak gravitational lensing. By measuring the cosmic shear around clusters, weak lensing can provide estimates of their total mass. Because measurements for individual clusters are low signal-to-noise, DES clusters will be binned by that observable and redshift. For each of these bins, the average cluster mass profile will be calculated using weak lensing. Relating the observable quantity to the calculated cluster mass profile calibrates the mean mass-observable relation.|$|E

In this way, they can be used as standard candles for distance measurements although there are difficulties with the effects of metallicity, faintness, and blending. The effect of blending can impact RR Lyrae variables sampled near the cores of globular clusters, which are so dense that in low-resolution observations multiple (unresolved) stars may appear as a single target.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{suggested}} to decompose the statistical and <b>systematic</b> <b>uncertainties</b> from the residues between {{the calculation of}} a theoretical model and the observed data. The residues and {{the parameters of the}} model can be obtained through the standard statistical fitting procedures. The present work concentrates on the decomposition of the total uncertainty, of which the distribution corresponds to that of the residues. The distribution of the total uncertainty is considered as two normal distributions, statistical and <b>systematic</b> <b>uncertainties.</b> The standard deviation of the statistical part, σstat, is estimated through random parameters distributed around their best fitted values. The two normal distributions are obtained by minimizing the moments of the distribution of the residues with the fixed σstat. The method is applied to the liquid drop model (LD). The statistical and <b>systematic</b> <b>uncertainties</b> are decomposed from the residues of the nuclear binding energies with and without the consideration of the shell effect in LD. The estimated distributions of the statistical and <b>systematic</b> <b>uncertainties</b> can well describe that of the residues. The normal assumption of the distribution of the statistical and <b>systematic</b> <b>uncertainties</b> is examined through various approaches. The comparison between the distributions of the specific nuclei and those of the statistical and <b>systematic</b> <b>uncertainties</b> are consistent with the physical considerations, although the latter two can be obtained without the knowledge of these considerations. Such as, the LD are more suitable to describe the heavy nuclei. The light and heavy nuclei are indeed distributed mostly inside the distributions of the statistical and <b>systematic</b> <b>uncertainties,</b> respectively.

On 1 March 2013 NASA published a detailed synopsis of the event, stating that at peak brightness (at 09:20:33 local time), the meteor was 23.3 km (14.5 miles, 76,000 feet) high, located at 54.8°N, 61.1°E. At that time it was travelling at about 18.6 km/s (11.6 mi/s), (about 67,000 km/h, or about 41,750 mph) —almost 60 times the speed of sound. In November 2013, results were published based on a more careful calibration of dashcam videos in the field weeks after the event during a Russian Academy of Sciences field study, which put the point of peak brightness at 29.7 km altitude and the final disruption of the thermal debris cloud at 27.0 km, settling to 26.2 km, all with a possible <b>systematic</b> <b>uncertainty</b> of +/− 0.7 km.|$|E
50|$|The main {{theoretical}} uncertainties in {{the interpretation}} of BAO measurements are the effects of nonlinear gravitational evolution and of scale-dependent bias between galaxies and dark matter. Non-linear evolution erases the acoustic oscillations on small scales, while both non-linear mode coupling and scale-dependent bias can shift the positions of the BAO features. Scale-dependent bias on large scales is potentially more of a concern for interpreting the broad-band power spectrum shape than for the BAO signal. Simulations that will become available over the next few years, should enable us to calculate the corrections due to non-linearity and scale-dependent bias to sufficient accuracy that the remaining <b>systematic</b> <b>uncertainty</b> will be small compared to the DES statistical errors on large scales. In addition, since the bispectrum(The Fourier transform of the second-order cumulant used to search for nonlinear interactions) responds to non-linearity and bias differently from the power spectrum, measurement of the angular bispectrum shape in DES will provide a cross-check on these effects, constrain this scale-dependence and determine the efficacy and robustness of including the broad-band shape in constraining dark energy.|$|E
50|$|The Araucaria Project is a {{collaboration}} between astronomers from institutions in Europe, Chile and the US. Its principal aim is to provide an improved calibration of the local extragalactic distance scale. In the process of setting up the extragalactic distance scale, the greatest difficulty leading to the currently largest contribution on the <b>systematic</b> <b>uncertainty</b> of the Hubble constant lies in the determination of accurate absolute distances to nearby galaxies. The principal reason for this persisting difficulty is in the unknown dependences of stellar standard candles, {{used to measure the}} distances of nearby galaxies, on the environmental properties of their host galaxies (metallicity, age of the stellar populations etc.). The Araucaria Project is an effort to remedy this situation for several of the most important stellar candles, including Cepheid variables, RR Lyrae stars, red clump giants, and blue supergiants which all have the potential to provide accurate distance determinations to nearby galaxies once their environmental dependences are well calibrated. Our strategy is to determine precise distances using the various stellar candles to handful of galaxies with widely different environmental parameters, carefully analyze the distance differences between the different stellar candles, and how they vary with the environmental parameters of their host galaxies.|$|E

50|$|If the {{transfer}} of the ice from the land to the sea is balanced by snow falling back on the land then there will be no net contribution to global sea levels. The general trend shows that a warming climate in the southern hemisphere would transport more moisture to Antarctica, causing the interior ice sheets to grow, while calving events along the coast will increase, causing these areas to shrink. A 2006 paper derived from satellite data, measuring changes in the gravity of the ice mass, suggests that the total amount of ice in Antarctica has begun decreasing in the past few years. A 2008 study compared the ice leaving the ice sheet, by measuring the ice velocity and thickness along the coast, to the amount of snow accumulation over the continent. This found that the East Antarctic Ice Sheet was in balance but the West Antarctic Ice Sheet was losing mass. This was largely due to acceleration of ice streams such as Pine Island Glacier. These results agree closely with the gravity changes. An estimate published in November 2012 and based on the GRACE data as well as on an improved glacial isostatic adjustment model discussed <b>systematic</b> <b>uncertainty</b> in the estimates, and by studying 26 separate regions, estimated an average yearly mass loss of 69 ± 18 Gt/y from 2002 to 2010.
