5|$|Afterward, Grant {{suggested}} {{to his colleagues}} that they should {{catch up with the}} presidential limousine. Since he was the only Dallas-based member of the press in camera car two, Grant directed his driver to the Trade Mart, where they saw no activity. A worker across the street <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> a limousine speed past, accompanied by motorcycles with their sirens blaring; Grant knew immediately that they were headed to Parkland Memorial Hospital. Once at Parkland, Grant started snapping pictures of anything he could, including Vice President Johnson's car, and a man and a police officer delivering what Grant believed was blood plasma.|$|E
5|$|In 1855, Tchaikovsky's father funded {{private lessons}} with Rudolph Kündinger and {{questioned}} {{him about a}} musical career for his son. While impressed with the boy's talent, Kündinger <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> nothing to suggest a future composer or performer. He later admitted that his assessment was also based on his own negative experiences as a musician in Russia and his unwillingness for Tchaikovsky to be treated likewise. Tchaikovsky was told to finish his course and then try for a post in the Ministry of Justice.|$|E
5|$|A senior {{national}} team official, Colonel Roman Lisiewicz of the Polish Army, <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> the goalkeeper and the journalist reach {{the hotel in}} a taxi soon after 05:00—but rather than going to his room, Młynarczyk then left again with Zieliński before returning again around 07:00. Tired and hungover, Młynarczyk joined {{the rest of the}} players for breakfast, and according to Terlecki spent most of the meal getting worked up about possible managerial retribution. Młynarczyk was in such bad shape that he was unable to carry his own bags; Smolarek took them for him. Next to the team bus, one of Kulesza's assistants, Bernard Blaut, confronted Smolarek and told him that Młynarczyk was to stay behind.|$|E

5|$|While {{investigating}} a murder involving a hitman, Howard (Melissa Leo) and Felton (Daniel Baldwin) question Miles Stradinger (Paul Schulze), {{who serves as}} an arbitrator between hitmen and their customers. Stradinger gives up several of his clients, including Calpurnia Church (Mary Jefferson), a woman suspected of murdering five husbands for insurance money. Although Church denies killing anybody, the detectives find enough evidence to close many outstanding cases. Lewis, who had previously been investigating the Church case, believes his prayer with Crosetti led to her arrest. This is further upheld when Crosetti receives an anonymous call claiming a man named Alfred Smith shot Thormann. While searching for Smith, Crosetti meets a man named Charles Flavin (Larry E. Hull) who <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> Smith shoot Thormann and will testify to it in court. The episode ends with Crosetti sitting with an unconscious Thormann {{in the hospital and}} listening to jazz music, which the two friends used to discuss frequently.|$|E

He then saw his stepfather shove Piott against the kitchen counter and threaten to kill him too. As Piott begged for his life, they heard emergency sirens. Corrigan thought this was the only reason Stiltz did not kill Piott. Corrigan said his stepfather lied in his account of the event before the coroner's jury.|$|E
25|$|Police officer Robert Riske was {{the first}} officer at the crime scene. He testified that he found a barefoot woman in a black dress lying face down in a puddle {{of blood on the}} walkway that led to the front door of her house. He next saw Goldman's body a short {{distance}} away, lying on its side beside a tree and off the walkway. Riske <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> a white envelope, which was later found to contain the glasses left at the restaurant by Brown's mother. He also saw Goldman's beeper, a black leather glove, and a dark blue knit ski cap on the ground near the bodies. The front door of Brown's house was wide open, but there were no signs of forced entry nor any evidence that anyone had entered the premises. Nothing inside was out of the ordinary.|$|E

25|$|Olen Montgomery {{testified that}} he had been alone on a tank car the entire trip, and had not known about the fight or alleged rapes.

He <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> the white teenagers jump off the train. Roberson, Montgomery, and Powell all denied they had known each other or the other defendants before that day. Andy Wright, Eugene Williams, and Haywood Patterson testified that they had previously known each other, but had not seen the women until the train stopped in Paint Rock. Knight questioned them extensively about instances in which their testimony supposedly differed from their testimony at their trial in Scottsboro. They did not contradict themselves in any meaningful way.|$|E
25|$|Andrija Hebrang accused his party's dissidents, Vidošević and Primorac, {{as well as}} most right-wing {{candidates}} for 'stealing' his votes saying the result was that two left-wingers would face-off in the second round. Despite this, he called the election a great victory of the right claiming that right-leaning candidates combined achieved better results that left-leaning candidates combined. In making this assertion, he failed to consider Bandić as left-leaning, and ignored Vidošević's appeal to the left-leaning voters as well. Vidošević conceded defeat saying that one should never blame his failures on others, but himself. He urged the public to continue believing in a better tomorrow saying that Croatia should be a country of knowledge and justice, not of corruption and divisiveness. Pusić gave a short teary speech calling Croatia a country with a lot of potential with only the right leadership. She also noted that no government would ever be able to win without the support of HNS. Primorac said he would be forming a new party which would be independent from both HDZ and SDP and <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> a bright future for Croatia.|$|E
25|$|Wakanohana finally earned {{promotion}} to yokozuna in 1998 after winning two consecutive championships in March and May of that year. He had spent 29 tournaments at ōzeki {{before reaching the}} yokozuna rank, the third longest wait ever. He and Takanohana became the first pair of brothers to ever become yokozuna. However his time at sumo's highest rank was brief and injury plagued, and {{he was unable to}} add to his tally of championship wins. The best result he had as a yokozuna was in January 1999 when he came into the final day the tournament leader on 13–1. However he was defeated by Chiyotaikai and, in the subsequent playoff between them for the championship, he lost a rematch after the first bout was deemed by the judges to be too close to call, despite many observers feeling Wakanohana had clearly won the match. He was unable to complete the next three tournaments due to a leg sprain, and then his refusal to withdraw from his comeback tournament in September 1999 despite suffering a torn thigh muscle on the tenth day ensured that he became only the second yokozuna ever to finish a 15-day tournament with more losses than wins (the other yokozuna to suffer this fate was Ōnokuni, exactly ten years previously). He resolved to continue wrestling after consulting with his father, and was also supported by the head of the Japan Sumo Association, the former Yutakayama Katsuo, who <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> no reason for retirement as his poor record was directly caused by injury.|$|E
