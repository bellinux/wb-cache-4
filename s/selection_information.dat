40|$|Spoken {{dialogue}} {{systems have}} a strong requirement to produce concise and informative utterances. While interacting over a phone, users must both understand the system’s utterances, and remember important facts {{that the system is}} providing. Thus most dialogue systems implement some combination of different techniques for (1) option selection: pruning the set of options; (2) information selection: selecting a subset of information to present about each option; (3) aggregation: combining multiple items of information succinctly. We first describe how user models based on multi-attribute decision theory support domain-independent algorithms for both option <b>selection</b> and <b>information</b> <b>selection.</b> We then describe experiments to determine an optimal level of conciseness in <b>information</b> <b>selection,</b> i. e. how much information to include for an option. Our results show that (a) users are highly oriented to utterance conciseness; (b) the <b>information</b> <b>selection</b> algorithm is highly consistent with user’s judgments of conciseness; and (c) the appropriate level of conciseness is both user and dialogue strategy dependent. 1...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} presents {{empirical evidence}} and interpretation {{about the effects}} of planning participants and contextual factors on <b>information</b> <b>selection</b> in public organizations. The study addresses important research questions and gaps in the literature about applicability of planning theory to practice, about effects of planning participants and participant diversity on <b>information</b> <b>selection,</b> and about community and organizational factors that influence <b>information</b> <b>selection</b> in the planning process. The research informs emergency planning, practice, and guidance, as well as planning theory and practice in general. The research sample consists of survey data from 183 local emergency planning committees (LEPCs) about their conduct of hazardous materials commodity flow studies (HMCFS), along with data from other secondary sources. HMCFS projects collect information about hazardous materials (HazMat) transport {{that can be used in}} a wide range of local emergency planning and community planning applications. This study takes the perspective that socio-cultural frameworks, such as organizational norms and values, influence information behaviors of planning participants. Controlling for organizational and community factors, the participation of community planners in HMCFS projects has a significant positive effect on <b>selection</b> of communicative <b>information</b> sources. Participation of HazMat responders in HMCFS projects does not have a significant negative effect on <b>selection</b> of communicative <b>information</b> sources. The diversity of HMCFS participants has a significant positive effect on <b>information</b> <b>selection</b> diversity. Other organizational and community factors, such as vicarious experience, 'know-how' and direct experience, financial resources, and knowledge/perception of hazards and risks are also important influences on <b>information</b> <b>selection</b> behavior. Results of this study are applicable to planning entities that are likely to use planning information: proactive LEPCs, planning agencies, and planning consortiums. The results are also applicable to community planners in local planning agencies and emergency responders in local emergency response agencies, and public planning organizations in general. In addition to providing evidence about the applicability of communicative rationality in planning practice, this research suggests that institutional/contextual, bounded, instrumental, and political rationalities may also in influence conduct of planning projects.

Despite their widespread use, however, practice guideline evaluation lacks a rigorous scientific methodology to support its development and application. Discussion Firstly, we review the major epidemiological foundations of practice guideline development. Secondly, we propose a chronic disease epidemiological model in which practice patterns are viewed as the exposure and outcomes of interest such as quality or cost are viewed as the disease. Sources of <b>selection,</b> <b>information,</b> confounding and temporal trend bias are identified and discussed. Summary The proposed methodological framework for outcomes research to evaluate practice guidelines reflects the <b>selection,</b> <b>information</b> and confounding biases inherent in its observational nature which must be accounted for in both the design and the analysis phases of any outcomes research study. </p...|$|E

40|$|Previous design {{research}} has demonstrated how epistemic uncertainty engenders localized, creative reasoning, including analogizing and mental simulation. We analyzed not just the short-term, localized effects of epistemic uncertainty on creative processing and <b>information</b> <b>selection,</b> but also its long-term impact on downstream creative processes. Our hypothesis was that heightened levels of uncertainty associated with a particular cognitive referent would engender: (1) immediate creative elaboration of that referent aimed at resolving uncertainty and determining information selection; and (2) subsequent attentive returns to that cognitive referent at later points in time, aimed at resolving lingering uncertainty and determining <b>information</b> <b>selection.</b> Findings: First – contrary to expectations – we observed that increased epistemic certainty (rather than increased epistemic uncertainty) in relation to cognitive referents triggered immediate, creative reasoning and information elaboration. Second, epistemic uncertainty was, as predicted, found to engender subsequent attentive returns to cognitive referents. Third, although epistemic uncertainty did not predict the <b>selection</b> of <b>information,</b> both immediate creative elaboration and subsequent attentive returns did predict <b>information</b> <b>selection,</b> with subsequent attentive returns being the stronger predictor. Our findings hold promise for identifying more global impacts of epistemic uncertainty on creative design cognition possibly mediated through the establishment of lasting associations with cognitive referents...|$|R
