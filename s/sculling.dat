5|$|Rush {{organised}} {{two major}} Sydney <b>sculling</b> events, {{held on the}} Parramatta River. The first was in August 1906 which included a Veterans' Race, and a Ladies' Double <b>Sculling</b> Championship. The Veterans' Race included many old <b>sculling</b> champions, {{with the exception of}} Trickett who had retired from sporting activity. In 1907, Rush organised an even more ambitious event, 'Rush's Rowing Carnival', held in February 1907. with a Veteran's Event, and an 'All Comers' Handicap' offering a prize of £50. Rush hoped to 'resuscitate an interest in rowing.' The Carnival attracted several promising scullers, including future champions Richard Arnst and Peter Kemp, but spectator attendance was 'very small'. Rush's last recorded participation in a major <b>sculling</b> event was as umpire of the World Championship match between William Webb and Charles Towns held 3 August 1907, over the Parramatta course.|$|E
5|$|Michael Rush (3 January 1844 – 17 December 1922) was an Irish Australian sculler {{noted for}} his {{one-on-one}} competitions against champion opponents, which drew vast crowds of spectators. He attempted {{to win the}} World <b>Sculling</b> Championship.|$|E
5|$|Rush {{remained}} {{interested and}} involved in the sport of <b>sculling.</b> He was in demand as a race official, for example, as a umpire or timekeeper, though he did little coaching.|$|E

5|$|Elias C. Laycock was his 'chief rival'. Just a year {{younger than}} Rush, and like him, a large and {{powerful}} man, Laycock came {{to live on the}} Lower Clarence River around 1874. The two scullers met first at the Queen's Birthday regatta in Grafton in May 1874. Laycock, untried at boat racing, was beaten, though undeterred. During the following years, Laycock challenged Rush and others to <b>sculling</b> matches, until in April 1879, he beat World Champion Trickett at a State regatta. A series of matches followed to determine the current Australian <b>sculling</b> Champion, who would defend the World Title. Laycock beat Rush again and again, but Trickett eventually beat Laycock. Trickett once more went to the Thames to row against Ned Hanlan, but these preliminary contests in Sydney marked the end of Rush's World Championship ambitions.|$|E
5|$|Though his {{finances}} remained shaky, and {{his attempts}} at various business enterprises were unsuccessful, Rush continued {{to the end}} of his life to be interested and involved in the sport of rowing and <b>sculling,</b> organising carnivals and umpiring important matches. Rush died on his small farm in Hurstville, in December 1922.|$|E

In 1985, she came second in both the single <b>sculls</b> and the quad <b>sculls.</b> In 1986, she won her first national championship (in the double <b>sculls</b> with Sylvia Schwabe), and she came second in both the single <b>sculls</b> and the quad <b>sculls.</b> In 1987, she came third in the quad <b>sculls.</b> She gained her second national title in 1988 (in the quad <b>sculls)</b> and also came second in the double <b>sculls.</b> She was national champion in the double <b>sculls</b> in both 1989 (with Jana Sorgers) and 1990 (with Kathrin Boron), and was also second in 1990 in the quad <b>sculls.</b> In total, she was thus East German national rowing champion four times.|$|R
5|$|Francis Punch was {{a younger}} brother of sculler, publican and {{promoter}} James 'Jem' Punch. Following the death of James, Francis bought Punch's Hotel. Punch sponsored a <b>sculling</b> prize and though this event did not attract any international entrants, Rush, Trickett and Laycock competed over the Championship course in early October 1882. Rush won not only the Punch Trophy but regained the Australian Championship.|$|E
5|$|In sport, an iron puddler, Robert Chambers of the company's Walker works, won the <b>sculling</b> {{championship}} at the 1857 Thames Regatta. The heavy work stirring the iron {{was said to}} have strengthened his arms and shoulders. Chambers also won the return match, held on the Tyne on 19 April 1859, even after a collision with a moored boat left him a hundred yards behind.|$|E
5|$|Most {{histories}} of professional Australian <b>sculling</b> commence with this event. By 1877, Australia had a vigorous interest in sport, and {{a class of}} professional athletes was emerging. Far from defeating him, the match of 30 June 1877 gave Rush new energy. After {{a year or two}} of retirement, he began to train and compete, mastering the sliding seat. He regained his Australian Championship in September 1881.|$|E

5|$|Rush {{arrived in}} Sydney in 1861 {{at the age}} of 16, an {{assisted}} immigrant brought to augment Australia's mostly agricultural workforce. Rush was a farm labourer, who knew nothing of boats or boating, but within ten years of his arrival in Australia, Rush was Champion Sculler of the Clarence River, as well as a selector, cattle-raiser and butcher. His interest in the sport of rowing dominated Rush's life, and hampered his prosperity. He repeatedly travelled from his Clarence River home to compete for large money prizes on Sydney's Parramatta River, neglecting his business affairs. Rush became Champion Sculler of Australia in 1873, and defended his championship several times, not always successfully. Rush succeeded on a few occasions in having the Championship venue moved from Sydney to the Clarence River, the first to shift the focus of <b>sculling</b> away from the capital city. From 1874, there was talk of Rush travelling to England to compete for the World <b>Sculling</b> Championship, but this did not eventuate. Instead, Edward Trickett won the World Championship on the Thames in 1876. Rush and Trickett in 1877 competed on the Parramatta River for the World Championship, but Rush lost this race.|$|E
5|$|Rush {{organised}} an Aquatic Carnival at Grafton, held on 2 January 1888, {{as part of}} {{the national}} celebrations marking the centenary of European settlement in Australia. The event attracted many up-and-coming scullers, including future World Champion Henry Searle, and even Ned Hanlan, who declined to compete due to illness, though he gave an exhibition of 'trick' <b>sculling.</b> Rush rowed his last professional match on this occasion, {{as a member of a}} pair-oar crew.|$|E
5|$|Edward 'Ned' Trickett {{sought to}} win the Australian Championship from Rush. Trickett was outclassed by Rush at the 1874 and 1875 events, but {{afterwards}} competed at numerous regattas and in private matches, and his form was consistently improving. Trickett and his backers demanded that Rush contest the title on the Parramatta River where he won it from Hickey. Rush declined to row anywhere but on the Clarence River, and demanded that the stakes be not less than £500. By 1875, Rush had a wife and five children to support, {{as well as many}} business commitments, and could not afford to undertake a sporting endeavour involving a major investment in time and money, unless there was a chance of an adequate financial return. Dozens of letters and articles in the Australian press debated the issue for nearly two years, as Trickett and his supporters became increasingly incensed at Rush's stalling. Finally, former champion sculler and now a prosperous publican and backer of <b>sculling</b> events, offered to finance an attempt by an Australian sculler to topple the current holder of the World <b>Sculling</b> Championship, Englishman Joseph Sadler. Rush declined to travel to London. Trickett agreed to the journey, went to the Thames, beat Sadler, and brought home the World Championship to Australia. Rush challenged Trickett for the World title. Trickett demanded that the race be rowed on the Parramatta River, and the match came off on the afternoon of 30 June 1877.|$|E

5|$|In April 1881, Mason, Brothers {{offered a}} cash prize of £300, {{to be known}} as the Walker Whiskey Trophy. The cash prizes {{attracted}} so many entrants that a series of preliminary heats was held during September 1881. Rush took part, but was eliminated from the final race. Rush also rowed a number of private matches at this time, notably against J. J. Power, Harry Pearce, both of whom he beat, and Elias Laycock. The match against Laycock was for the Championship of Australia, which Laycock won with ease. Rush announced his retirement from <b>sculling</b> contests, not for the first or the last time.|$|E
5|$|Rush married Anne Aby (known as Annie) Fitzpatrick on 18 September 1865, at St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney. Annie Fitzpatrick, born 1846, was the {{daughter}} of Irish ex-convicts. She bore Rush fourteen children, three of whom died in infancy and two in early adulthood. None of Rush's children became professional sportsmen, though three of his sons competed successfully in various amateur <b>sculling</b> contests and one as a cyclist. His daughter Emily was a well-known amateur singer during her youth. Two Rush sons fought in the Boer War, another went gold-prospecting on the Kalgoorlie gold-fields, and died there. Rush retired around 1913, to a cottage and ten acres of land in Hurstville, New South Wales. He died there on 22 December 1922, after a brief illness. Rush is buried in Sydney's Waverley Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Rush {{was unique}} in early Australian <b>sculling</b> {{in that he}} {{provided}} opportunities for others to compete and excel, by organising regattas and other rowing events, though financially he gained little. He raised and raced horses, organised athletic carnivals, and was a generous supporter of charities, churches, and schools. His background {{as the son of}} Irish tenant farmers, a class traditionally debarred by law from owning land and hence accumulating wealth, gave Rush little understanding of the management of money. Rush and his wife had fourteen children, and the Rush family lived in grand, if not extravagant style; most Rush enterprises were financed by mortgages or promissory notes. When the Banks Crash of 1893 came, Rush was not only deeply in debt, he did not even own the house he lived in.|$|E

5000|$|Darell was an eminent single <b>sculler,</b> {{competing}} for the Household Brigade Boat Club. In 1906 he was runner-up to Harry Blackstaffe in the Diamond Challenge <b>Sculls</b> at Henley.

5|$|The {{sea otter}} propels itself {{underwater}} {{by moving the}} rear end of its body, including its tail and hind feet, up and down, and is capable of speeds of up to 9km/h (5.6mph). When underwater, its body is long and streamlined, with the short forelimbs pressed closely against the chest. When at the surface, it usually floats on its back and moves by <b>sculling</b> its feet and tail from side to side. At rest, all four limbs can be folded onto the torso to conserve heat, whereas on particularly hot days, the hind feet may be held underwater for cooling. The sea otter's body is highly buoyant because of its large lung capacity – about 2.5 times {{greater than that of}} similar-sized land mammals – and the air trapped in its fur. The sea otter walks with a clumsy, rolling gait on land, and can run in a bounding motion.|$|E
5|$|Business {{and family}} {{commitments}} kept Rush busy {{for the next}} few years. He moved his home up-river from Maclean to Grafton, the effective 'capital' of the Clarence River district. Rush purchased a hotel and an adjacent store, and a riverside villa which he named 'Clarence House'. Rush took an active part in a great many community and sporting organisations. He was a founder of the Grafton Rowing Club and was several times an office-holder of the Clarence River Jockey Club. He continued to promote and take part in local regattas. One of these was the Clarence River Aquatic Carnival, held on 10 March 1883. The Carnival attracted thousands of spectators. The main event was Rush vs Laycock for a stake of £1000 and the Championship of Australia, which Laycock won convincingly. At a banquet later that week, Rush announced his retirement from professional <b>sculling,</b> but in December of that year, he rowed Trickett on the Parramatta River for a stake of £400, and lost convincingly. The newspapers praised Rush for his valour, but hinted that it was high time he retired.|$|E
5|$|Rush set {{his sights}} on the Australian <b>Sculling</b> Championship, and in February 1873, won it from William Hickey in a {{controversial}} match: many claimed that Hickey 'sold' the race. Rush insisted that the championship be contested on his home waters of the Clarence River. To make this condition was his right as the holder of a current championship. Rush's enterprise in arranging for sponsors to provide substantial sums of prizes encouraged Australia's best scullers to compete. These events drew large crowds of spectators and gamblers to the Clarence River, especially the town of Grafton. Rush helped to organise, and took part in, aquatic contests held Grafton in 1874, and 1875 Two of these were held in conjunction with Grafton's celebration of the Queen's Birthday. Rush also organised an Intercolonial Regatta, held at Grafton 7 October 1874 at which he successfully defended his championship. However, at the Queen's Birthday regatta of 1875, Rush, who was ill, lost the race to Elias C. Laycock.|$|E
50|$|Each {{team was}} made up of 13 rowers (5 women, 7 men, and a cox).
