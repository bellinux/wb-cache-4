40|$|Tuberose {{is one of}} the {{tropical}} and subtropical bulbous cut flowers cultivated extensively in most floricultural regions of Iran. Although it has a high potential for a long vase life after harvest, tuberose declines rapidly at home. In order to overcome this problem, two experiments were conducted on a local cultivar, “Goldorosht-e-Mahalat”, using a completely randomized design. To find a suitable preservative which provides the longest vase life for tuberose, the experiment was carried out by applying the carelessness of most consumers: not recutting stem ends nor changing the vase solutions. In the first experiment the preservative solutions were: sucrose (1, 2 and 3 %), <b>silver</b> <b>thiosulphate</b> (0. 4, 0. 8 and 1. 2 mM), silver nitrate (50, 100 and 150 mgl- 1), citric acid (150, 300 and 450 mgl- 1) and tap water as the control. In {{the early days of the}} experiment, <b>silver</b> <b>thiosulphate</b> caused severe burning of the florets, silver nitrate caused the wilting of the florets and bent the end of the flower spikes; and sucrose didn’t have any positive effect, but decreased the vase life.

The treatments were: sterilized distilled water, citric acid made with sterilized distilled water (150, 300 and 450 mgl- 1) and tap water as the control. The longest and the shortest vase life belonged to sterilized distilled water and the control (tap water) respectively.

40|$|During {{the first}} days of development, maize roots showed {{considerable}} variation in the production of ethylene and the rate of elongation. As endogenous ethylene increases, root elongation decreases. When these roots are treated with the precursor of ethylene aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid (ACC), or inhibitors of ethylene biosynthesis 2 -aminoethoxyvinyl glycine (AVG) or cobalt ions, the root elongation is also inhibited. Because of root growth diminishes at high or reduced endogenous ethylene concentrations, it appears that this phytohormone must be maintained in a range of concentrations to support normal root growth. In spite of its known role as inhibitor of ethylene action, <b>silver</b> <b>thiosulphate</b> (STS) does not change significantly the root elongation rate.

40|$|White clover (Trifolium repens L.), {{like many}} epigeal {{emerging}} legumes, displays a {{phenomenon known as}} contractile growth. This process occurs in the weeks following seedling emergence and involves the longitudinal shortening and radial expansion of tissues in the hypocotyl and upper primary root. During routine trials at AgResearch Grasslands, Palmerston North, {{it was noted that}} some seedlings of cv. Grasslands Huia displayed an aberrant growth form characterized by a failure to display normal contractile growth. These seedlings were intermated for one to two generations to form the 'non-contractile' populations used in this thesis. The 'contractile' populations used were formed through the random selection and intermating of plants which showed normal contraction. The non-contractile phenotype was found to occur naturally in populations of white clover at a frequency of 2 - 22 %. When compared to tissue from normal contractile seedlings, hypocotyl tissue from non-contractile seedlings showed reduced radial expansion which in turn led to decreased contraction. Since the plant hormone ethylene has been implicated in the promotion of radial expansion in many plant tissues and systems (Abeles 1973 b), the effects of applying <b>silver</b> <b>thiosulphate</b> and the ethylene-releasing compound Ethrel, were examined in contractile and non-contractile seedlings. Endogenous ethylene production by contractile and non-contractile seedlings was also examined. Seedlings from the contractile line showed an overall higher production of ethylene during early seedling growth than did seedlings from the non-contractile line. When treated with <b>silver</b> <b>thiosulphate</b> (which blocks ethylene perception), hypocotyls from seedlings of the contractile line failed to display contractile growth and hypocotyls from seedlings of the non-contractile line displayed non-contractile growth to a greater degree. When treated with Ethrel hypocotyls from seedlings of the non-contractile line displayed contractile growth but hypocotyls from seedlings of the contractile line failed to display contractile growth. These results indicate that ethylene is required for normal contractile growth of the hypocotyl in white clover seedlings, and that non-contractile growth of the hypocotyl is caused by a decreased production of, rather than a decreased sensitivity to, the plant hormone ethylene...|$|E
40|$|Background: In {{many species}} floral {{senescence}} is coordinated by ethylene. Endogenous levels rise, and exogenous application accelerates senescence. Furthermore, floral senescence is {{often associated with}} increased reactive oxygen species, and is delayed by exogenously applied cytokinin. However, how these processes are linked remains largely unresolved. Erysimum linifolium (wallflower) provides an excellent model for understanding these interactions due to its easily staged flowers and close taxonomic relationship to Arabidopsis. This has facilitated microarray analysis of gene expression during petal senescence and provided gene markers for following the effects of treatments on different regulatory pathways.

Furthermore senescence is delayed by treatments with the ethylene signalling inhibitor <b>silver</b> <b>thiosulphate,</b> and accelerated with ethylene released by 2 -chloroethylphosphonic acid. Both treatments with exogenous cytokinin, or 6 -methyl purine (which is an inhibitor of cytokinin oxidase), delay petal senescence. However, treatment with cytokinin also increases ethylene biosynthesis. Despite the similar effects on senescence, transcript abundance of gene markers is affected differentially by the treatments. A significant rise in transcript abundance of WLS 73 (a putative aminocyclopropanecarboxylate oxidase) was abolished by cytokinin or 6 -methyl purine treatments. In contrast, WFSAG 12 transcript (a senescence marker) continued to accumulate significantly, albeit at a reduced rate. <b>Silver</b> <b>thiosulphate</b> suppressed the increase in transcript abundance both of WFSAG 12 and WLS 73.

Conclusions: A model for the interaction between cytokinins, ethylene, reactive oxygen species and auxin in the regulation of floral senescence in wallflowers is proposed. The combined increase in ethylene and reduction in cytokinin triggers the initiation of senescence and these two plant growth regulators directly or indirectly result in increased reactive oxygen species levels.

Nodal shoot cultures {{grown in the}} presence of 1 -aminocyclopropane carboxylic acid (ACC, 1. 0 mM) resulted in a significant reduction in percent fresh and dry weights, shoot length, leaf area, petiole length and chlorophyll content, but leaf development was significantly increased. In contrast, nodal cultures grown {{in the presence of}} <b>silver</b> <b>thiosulphate</b> (STS, 0. 5 mM) significantly produced the highest percentage of fresh and dry weights, shoot length, leaf production, leaf area expansion, petiole length and leaf chlorophyll content. Nodal cultures and rooted whole plantlets placed in medium-sized (125 mL) culture vessels had significantly better growth than those cultures placed in small (70 mL) or in large (250 mL) vessels. Cultures grown in medium-sized vessels had higher fresh and dry weights, longer shoots, more leaves and larger leaf area than those cultures placed in smaller or larger vessels. Similarly, values for said growth parameters and for chlorophyll content of the nodal and rooted whole plantlets were higher when they were incubated under high light intensity of 120 mumol m(- 2) s(- 1) at a prevailing temperature of either 20 +/- 1 C or 25 +/- 1 C...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: High {{temperatures}} during lettuce seed imbibition can {{delay or}} completely inhibit germination and the endosperm layer appears {{to restrict the}} radicle protrusion. The role of endo-b-mannanase during lettuce seed germination at 35 °C {{and the influence of}} ethylene in endo-b-mannanase regulation were investigated. Seeds of ‘Dark Green Boston ’ (DGB) and ‘Everglades ’ (EVE) were germinated in water, or 10 mmol L- 1 of 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid (ACC), or 10 mmol L- 1 of aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG), or 20 mmol L- 1 of <b>silver</b> <b>thiosulphate</b> (STS). Seeds were also primed in polyethylene glycol (PEG), or PEG + ACC, PEG + AVG, or PEG + STS. Untreated seeds germinated 100 % at 20 °C. At 35 °C, EVE seeds germinated 100 %, whereas DGB seeds germinated only 33 %. Seed priming or adding ACC during incubation increased germination at 35 °C. Higher ethylene evolution was detected in EVE than in DGB during germination at 35 °C. AVG did not inhibit seed germination of DGB at 35 °C, but STS did. Higher endo-b-mannanase activity was observed in EVE compared with DGB seeds. Providing ACC either during priming or during germination increased endo-b-mannanase activity, whereas AVG and STS led to decreased or no activity. Ethylene may overcome the inhibitory effect of high temperature in thermosensitive lettuce seeds due to increased endo-b-mannanase, possibly leading to weakening of the endosperm...|$|E

Shoot organogenesis and plant regeneration in Sinningia speciosa were improved using ethylene inhibitors. The leaf explants were cultured on initial shoot regeneration media (MS media with BAP at 2 mg/L +NAA at 0. 1 mg/L) supplemented with different concentrations of aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG), cobalt chloride (CoCl 2), and <b>silver</b> <b>thiosulphate</b> (STS). The addition of AVG, CoCl 2, and STS significantly improved the regeneration frequency giving higher shoots per explant and longer shoot length. The highest shoot growth was found when STS at 5 mg/L was incorporated with generation medium, performing highest regeneration frequency with highest number of shoots. This treatment (STS at 5 mg/L) produced 40 % more shoots per explant compared to control followed by STS at 10 mg/L with increasing 37 % more shoots compared to control. In the cases of AVG and CoCl 2 the highest shoot number per explant was found at 1 mg/L. Treated with AVG and CoCl 2 at 1 mg/L increased shoot number by 16 and 12 %, respectively, compared to control.

40|$|Each postharvest {{physiological}} or handling step has {{a potential}} to either maintain or reduce {{the quality of}} fresh cut flowers. The undesirable postharvest changes that occur during the storage of fresh flowers (wilting, senescence) can be delayed through elevated carbon dioxide and lowered oxygen in storage atmosphere. In typically ultra low oxygen atmosphere used for cut flowers, the content of oxygen is critical for optimising the gaseous mixture just above inducing the fermenta-tive metabolism. However, if fresh flowers are exposed to stress oxygen and/or higher CO 2 level for a period longer than the time span they usually tolerate, detri-mental effects like abnormal petal colour and accumu-lation of ethanol and acetaldehyde occur. Elevated CO 2 atmosphere treatment of cut white carnation flowers for 3 days at 0 °C and 20 °C caused a transient yellowing of petals upon removal from 60 % CO 2 atmosphere at 20 °C (IRVING, HONNOR 1994). Various physiological and storage studies were con-ducted aimed at the role of ethylene production and sen-sitivity in senescence (WU et al. 1991 a,b; STABY et al. 1993; BRANDT, WOODSON 1992), and the climacteric peak of ethylene production (LEE et al. 1990). No mor-phological changes symptomatic of floral senescence appeared in flowers treated with aminotriazole and lon-gevity was extended (ALTMAN, SOLOMOS 1993).

40|$|The role of {{ethylene}} in vegetative bud regeneration was {{studied in}} cultured tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv Samsun) thin-layer explants. The experimental approach consisted in supplementing the bud-inducing medium with an inhibitor of ethylene biosynthesis, aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG), an ethylene antagonist, <b>silver</b> <b>thiosulphate</b> (STS), or an ethylene-releasing compound, 2 -chloroethylphosphonic acid (CEPA), at various concentrations. The organogenic response was assessed both macroscopically (percentage of bud-forming explants, final number of buds per explant) and cytohistologically (number, characteristics, and localisation of meristemoids and bud primordia). The time course of ethylene production during culture was also evaluated. At {{the end of}} culture (day 27) all the explants treated with these compounds had a lower number of buds compared to controls. STS was detrimental to meristemoid initiation at all the concentrations tested. In contrast, 0. 5 mu M AVG, which strongly inhibited ethylene production, provoked a large increase {{in the formation of}} meristemoids early in culture and the appearance of anomalous ("twin") buds. CEPA reduced meristemoid formation but, at the lower concentrations (1 and 10 mu M) speeded up bud emergence. On the whole it mainly favoured disorganised growth and xylogenesis. The results of this work highlight the contrasting effects of ethylene in relation to the two critical stages of the organogenic process, i. e., meristemoid formation and bud primordium development...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Ovule {{lifespan}} is {{an important}} factor in determining the ability to set fruits and produce seeds. Once ovule senescence is established, fruit set capacity in response to gibberellins (GAs) is lost. We aimed to elucidate whether ethylene plays a role in controlling ovule senescence and the fruit set response in Arabidopsis. Results Ethylene response inhibitors, <b>silver</b> <b>thiosulphate</b> (STS) and 1 -methylcyclopropene (1 -MCP), were able to delay the loss of pistil response to GA 3. In addition, ethylene insensitive mutants ein 2 - 5 and ein 3 - 1 showed delayed loss of pistil response, as in plants treated with STS and 1 -MCP, while constitutive mutant ctr 1 - 1 displayed premature loss of response. The analysis of the expression of ethylene biosynthesis genes suggests that ethylene is synthesised in ovules at the onset of ovule senescence, while a transcriptional meta-analysis also supports an activated ethylene-dependent senescence upon the establishment of ovule senescence. Finally, a SAG 12 :GUS reporter line proved useful to monitor ovule senescence and to directly demonstrate that ethylene specifically modulates ovule senescence. Conclusions We have shown that ethylene is involved in both the control of the ovule lifespan and the determination of the pistil/fruit fate. Our data support a role of the ovule in modulating the GA response during fruit set in Arabidopsis. A possible mechanism that links the ethylene modulation of the ovule senescence and the GA 3 -induced fruit set response is discussed. </p...|$|E
40|$|Ethylene-responsive element-binding factor (ERF) genes {{constitute}} one of {{the largest}} transcription factor gene families in plants. In Arabidopsis and rice, only a few ERF genes have been characterized so far. Flower senescence is associated with increased ethylene production in many flowers. However, the characterization of ERF genes in flower senescence has not been reported. In this study, 13 ERF cDNAs were cloned from petunia. Based on the sequence characterization, these PhERFs could be classified into four of the 12 known ERF families. Their predicted amino acid sequences exhibited similarities to ERFs from other plant species. Expression analyses of PhERF mRNAs were performed in corollas and gynoecia of petunia flower. The 13 PhERF genes displayed differential expression patterns and levels during natural flower senescence. Exogenous ethylene accelerates the transcription of the various PhERF genes, and <b>silver</b> <b>thiosulphate</b> (STS) decreased the transcription of several PhERF genes in corollas and gynoecia. PhERF genes of group VII showed a strong association with the rise in ethylene production in both petals and gynoecia, and might be associated particularly with flower senescence in petunia. The effect of sugar, methyl jasmonate, and the plant hormones abscisic acid, salicylic acid, and 6 -benzyladenine in regulating the different PhERF transcripts was investigated. Functional nuclear localization signal analyses of two PhERF proteins (PhERF 2 and PhERF 3) were carried out using fluorescence microscopy. These results supported a role for petunia PhERF genes in transcriptional regulation of petunia flower senescence processes...|$|E
40|$|The vase-life of Alstroemeria (cv. Rebecca) flowers is {{terminated}} {{when the}} tepals abscise. Abscission was accelerated by both chloroethylphosphonic acid (CEPA) and 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid (ACC). Petals abscised 24 h earlier compared with controls, when isolated cymes {{were placed in}} 340 nM CEPA, and earlier still when higher concentrations were used. This suggests that flowers of this Alstroemeria cultivar are very ethylene sensitive. Treatment with <b>silver</b> <b>thiosulphate</b> (STS) overcame the effects of exposure to CEPA and delayed perianth abscission of untreated isolated flowers by 3 - 4 days. The inclusion of 1 % sucrose in the vase solution also extended longevity but not {{by as much as}} STS treatment; combined STS and sucrose treatments did not increase longevity beyond that of either treatment alone. However, removal of the young buds from the axil of the first flower was the most effective treatment to extend vase-life and encouraged the growth and development of the remaining flower. Flowers on cut inflorescences from which young axillary buds were trimmed more than doubled in fresh weight 6 days after flower opening compared with an increase of only 70 - 80 % in those untreated or treated with STS and/or sucrose. Growth was less in isolated cymes but followed a similar pattern. The effect of STS and/or sucrose treatment was synergistic with the trimming treatment and thus the vase-life of trimmed, STS and sucrose-treated flowers was over 7 days longer than that for untreated controls...|$|E
40|$|Tese dout., Ciências Agrárias, Universidade do Algarve, 2008 The aims of {{this work}} were to study bract and flower abscission in Bougainvillea spectabilis ?Killie Campbell? plants, under {{post-production}} conditions. The effect of spraying with <b>Silver</b> <b>Thiosulphate</b> (STS) and with Naphtalene Acetic Acid (NAA, at high concentration: 500 mg. l- 1), separately or together, was tested on plants exposed or not to exogenous ethylene. Quantification of non-structural carbohydrates in the bracts, leaves and stems, {{as well as the}} respiratory rates of these plant organs were assessed. In another stage, the photosynthetic rates of leaves and bracts were determined and the anthesis of the flowers, existing in the interior of each group of bracts, was monitored. In the absence of exogenous ethylene, NAA was enough to reduce CD bract abscission during post-production. If plants were exposed to exogenous ethylene, then the treatment STS+NAA was needed to reduce bract abscission. Pooling together the four post-production treatments, bract abscission was positively correlated with bract+flower dark respiration, and with bract+flower total non-structural carbohydrates. Similary to what was previous found for other plant organs bract+flower respiration seems to be a good early indicator of bract longevity. Plants that presented greater bract longevity (i. e., NAA and STS+NAA treatments) were the ones that had a reduced percentage of opening flowers and whose flowers had shorter period of anthesis. Flower and bract longevity in potted bougainvillea are distinct events although they abscise together. Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia (FCT...|$|E
