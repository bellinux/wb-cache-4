40|$|By {{example of}} a Permalloy {{particle}} (40 × 40 μm(2) size, 30 nm thickness) we demonstrate a procedure to quantitatively investigate the dynamics of magnetic <b>stray</b> <b>fields</b> during ultrafast magnetization reversal. The measurements have been performed in a time-resolving photoemission electron microscope using the X-ray magnetic circular dichroism. In the particle under investigation, we have observed a flux-closure-dominated magnetic ground structure, minimizing the magnetic <b>stray</b> <b>field</b> outside the sample. A fast magnetic field pulse introduced changes in the micromagnetic structure accompanied with an incomplete flux closure.

In our design, a pinned magnetic layer is introduced under the heave metal separated by an insulator, generating an in-plane <b>stray</b> <b>field</b> in the perpendicularly magnetized layer. We have confirmed the deterministic switching of perpendicularly magnetized layers through micromagnetic simulation and theoretical analysis.
