5|$|Reborning {{involves}} numerous {{time consuming}} steps. The most basic {{form of the}} process involves taking a vinyl doll, adding multiple hand painted layers of paint, and adding other physical features to the doll. Artists can pick different brands to best suit the doll they wish to create. Reborn artists can also buy reborn doll kits that are sculpted by reborn sculpt artists. A kit includes the vinyl doll parts. Customers can then purchase a reborn doll by choosing a kit (name) by sculptor (name) and have it reborned by a reborn artist (name) e.g. Adam by Mary reborned by Ann. Consumers can purchase {{a wide range of}} supplies for creating their own reborn. Making a doll from a kit allows artists to omit <b>some</b> <b>steps</b> in the fabrication process and begin with a blank canvas. Many supplies are needed for both external and internal modifications of reborns to make the doll seem more realistic.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. It is proved {{for certain}} graded non-commutative rings that if M and N are graded bi-modules, finitely {{generated}} from either side, then the Ext groups between M and N vanish from <b>some</b> <b>step</b> if {{and only if}} the Ext groups between N and M vanish from <b>some</b> <b>step.</b> Among the rings in question are twisted homogeneous coordinate rings of elliptic curves. It is a striking result of commutative algebra that if A is a local complete intersection ring and M and N are finitely generated A-modules, then Ext i A (M, N) = 0 for i ≫ 0 ⇔ ExtiA (N, M) = 0 for i ≫ 0.
