5|$|The {{separation}} of static and dynamic data to reduce write amplification {{is not a}} simple process for the SSD controller. The process requires the SSD controller to separate the LBAs with data which is constantly changing and requiring rewriting (dynamic data) from the LBAs with data which rarely changes and does not require any rewrites (<b>static</b> <b>data).</b> If the data is mixed in the same blocks, as with almost all systems today, any rewrites will require the SSD controller to garbage collect both the dynamic data (which caused the rewrite initially) and <b>static</b> <b>data</b> (which did not require any rewrite). Any garbage collection of data that would not have otherwise required moving will increase write amplification. Therefore, separating the data will enable <b>static</b> <b>data</b> to stay at rest and if it never gets rewritten it will have the lowest possible write amplification for that data. The drawback to this process is that somehow the SSD controller must still find a way to wear level the <b>static</b> <b>data</b> because those blocks that never change will not get a chance to be written to their maximum P/E cycles.|$|E

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of using streamwise surface heat transfer measurements {{to detect the}} presence of flow separation in a two-dimensional reflected oblique shock/turbulent boundary layer interaction is reported. Surface heat transfer and <b>static</b> pressure <b>data</b> are presented for attached and separated flows for a free stream nominal Mach number range of 2. 5 to 3. 5 and shock generator angles of 2 to 8 degrees. The <b>static</b> pressure <b>data</b> do show the characteristic triple inflection point distribution for the strongly separated flow cases. The corresponding surface heat transfer data show unique trends that correlate well with the static pressure determination {{of the extent of}} the separated flow region. For the incipient or weakly separated flow cases, the <b>static</b> pressure <b>data</b> do not exhibit the characteristic triple inflection point distribution. However, the same trends in the heat transfer data that are seen for the strongly separated flow cases are evident for the weakly separated flows. Hence, the heat transfer data can be used {{to determine the extent of}} weakly separated flows when the surface static pressure distributions often can not...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{describes}} a unified data-driven prognostic framework that combines failure time <b>data,</b> <b>static</b> parameter <b>data</b> and dynamic (time-series) data. The approach employs Cox {{proportional hazards model}} (Cox PHM) and soft dynamic multiple fault diagnosis algorithm (DMFD) for inferring the degraded state trajectories of components and to estimate their remaining useful life (RUL). This framework {{takes into account the}} cross-subsystem fault propagation, a case prevalent in any networked and embedded system. The key idea is to use Cox proportional hazards model to estimate the survival functions of error codes and symptoms (soft test outcomes/prognostic indicators) from failure time <b>data</b> and <b>static</b> parameter <b>data,</b> and use them to infer the survival functions of components via a soft DMFD algorithm. The average remaining useful life and its higher-order central moments (e. g., variance, skewness, kurtosis) can be estimated from these component survival functions. The proposed prognostic framework {{has the potential to be}} applicable to a wide variety of systems, ranging from automobiles to aerospace systems...|$|R
