5|$|In {{the first}} episode when Steve Owen pulls over Susie Money, when she hands him her license, one can {{momentarily}} see the birth date {{on the back of}} the card; it <b>shows</b> <b>her</b> birth year as 1984.

5|$|To avoid a narrator, {{the serial}} delegates the novel's first ironic {{sentence}} to Elizabeth {{in an early}} scene. The adaptation opens {{with a view of}} Darcy's and Bingley's horses as they race across a field toward the Netherfield estate, expressing vitality; Elizabeth watches them before breaking into a run. While the novel indicates Elizabeth's independence and energy in her three-mile trek to Netherfield, the adaptation of this scene also <b>shows</b> <b>her</b> rebelliousness and love of nature.|$|E

Veronica had previously hired Weevil to destroy Madison’s car, but right before it {{is about to be}} crushed, she calls it off.|$|E
5|$|An {{inventory}} {{drawn up}} at the Hôtel de la Reine after Catherine's death <b>shows</b> <b>her</b> {{to have been a}} keen collector. Listed works of art included tapestries, hand-drawn maps, sculptures, rich fabrics, ebony furniture inlaid with ivory, sets of china, and Limoges pottery. There were also hundreds of portraits, for which a vogue had developed during Catherine's lifetime. Many portraits in her collection were by Jean Clouet (1480–1541) and his son François Clouet (1572). François Clouet drew and painted portraits of all Catherine's family and of many members of the court. After Catherine's death, a decline in the quality of French portraiture set in. By 1610, the school patronised by the late Valois court and brought to its pinnacle by François Clouet had all but died out.|$|E

5|$|As Mulder {{arrives in}} the fields, he {{inadvertently}} drives over a patch of mushrooms which releases a cloud of hallucinogenic spores. Mulder—unbeknownst to the viewer—begins to hallucinate. He soon discovers Wallace and Angela in a cave, and the two claim they were abducted by aliens, who covered up their disappearance with false skeletons. Later, Scully arrives at Mulder's apartment and he explains to Scully what happened. He <b>shows</b> <b>her</b> an alien that he captured at Brown Mountain. Scully, however, accepts his reasoning without question and Mulder begins to doubt his surroundings. Eventually, after seeing the yellow substance, much like Angela saw, Mulder awakens in the cave he followed Wallace into earlier, covered in the yellow secretion, being digested alive.|$|E
5|$|Athenian {{girls were}} not {{formally}} educated; instead, their mothers taught them the domestic {{skills necessary for}} running a household. Formal education for boys consisted of rhetoric, necessary for effective political participation, and physical education in preparation for military service. These skills were not considered necessary for women, who were barred from learning them. Classical art indicates that girls and boys played with toys such as spinning tops, hoops, and seesaws, and played games such as piggyback. The gravestone of Plangon, an Athenian girl aged about five {{which is in the}} Glyptothek museum in Munich, <b>shows</b> <b>her</b> holding a doll; a set of knucklebones hangs on a wall in the background.|$|E

5000|$|... "The Little Prince" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. The A.V. Clubs Noel Murray graded the episode a [...] "B+", stating [...] "... this episode made {{good use of}} Kate at different points on the timeline: <b>showing</b> <b>her</b> now, anxious about losing Aaron, and <b>showing</b> <b>her</b> three years ago on Penny’s boat, prepared to lie for Jack {{in order to keep}} Aaron safe, and <b>showing</b> <b>her</b> three years ago on the island, helping Claire bring Aaron into the world. In just a few short scenes, Lost lays the foundation for what that boy means to Kate." ...|$|R
