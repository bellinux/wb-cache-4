50|$|The initial laser systems {{used during}} the {{development}} of laser peening were large research lasers providing high energy pulses at very low pulse frequencies. Since the mid-late 1990s, lasers designed specifically for laser peening featured steadily smaller size and higher pulse frequencies, both of these more desirable for production environments. The laser peening systems include both rod laser systems and a <b>slab</b> <b>laser</b> system. The rod laser systems can be separated roughly into three primary groups, recognizing {{that there is some}} overlap between them: (1) high energy, low repetition rate lasers operating typically at 10-40 J per pulse with 8-25 ns pulse length at nominally 0.5-1 Hz rep rate, nominal spot sizes of 2 to 8 mm; (2) intermediate energy, intermediate repetition rate lasers operating at 3-10 J with 10-20 ns pulse width at 10 Hz rep rate, nominal spot sizes of 1-4 mm; (3) low energy, high repetition rate lasers operating at ≤ 1 J per pulse with ≤10 ns pulse length at 60+ Hz rep rate, ≤ 1 mm spot size. The <b>slab</b> <b>laser</b> system operates in the range of 10-25 J per pulse with 8-25 ns pulse duration at 3-5 Hz rep rate, nominal spot sizes of 2-5 mm. The commercial systems include rod lasers represented by all three groups and the <b>slab</b> <b>laser</b> system.|$|E

40|$|High-average-power {{broadband}} 780 -nm slab Ti:sapphire lasers, pumped by a kilohertz {{pulse repetition}} frequency copper vapor laser (CVL), were demonstrated. These lasers are designed for damage-free power scaling when pumped by CVL’s configured for maximum output power (of order 100 W) but with poor beam quality (M² ~ 300). A simple Brewster-angled <b>slab</b> <b>laser</b> side pumped by a CVL produced 10 -W average power (1. 25 -mJ pulses at 8 kHz) with 4. 2 -ns FWHM pulse duration at an absolute efficiency of 15 % (68 -W pump power). Thermal lensing in the Brewster <b>slab</b> <b>laser</b> resulted in multitransverse mode output, and pump absorption was limited to 72 % by the maximum doping level for commercially available Ti:sapphire (0. 25 %). A <b>slab</b> <b>laser</b> with a multiply folded zigzag path was therefore designed and implemented that produced high-beam-quality (TEM₀₀-mode) output when operated with cryogenic cooling and provided a longer absorption path for the pump. Excessive scattering of the Ti:sapphire beam at the crystal surfaces limited the efficiency of operation for the zigzag laser, but fluorescence diagnostic techniques, gain measurement, and modeling suggest that efficient power extraction (> 15 W TEM₀₀, > 23 % efficiency) from this laser would be possible for crystals with an optical quality surface polish. 8 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Fulltext: To {{scale the}} output power of diode pumped solid state lasers at high beam quality, high {{efficiency}} and low cost, {{we have developed}} a novel <b>slab</b> <b>laser</b> concept, which consists of slab-shaped crystal with only two polished faces for passing pumping and laser beam. The slab crystal is end pumped by a stack consisting of 3 diode laser bars and mounted in a watercooled brass heat sink with two large faces serving as thermally conducting surfaces. The pumped volume underfills the slab volume and has a rectangular cross section. Hybrid resonator, which is stable in {{the plane of the}} small dimension and unstable in the plane of the large dimension, was used for diffraction-limited beam quality at high efficiency. Unlike in the conventional <b>slab</b> <b>laser</b> design, in which the laser beam takes zigzag path inside the slab crystal, in our design the laser beam goes straight through the slab. This leads reduced crystal cost and possibility of parasitic oscillation. With the <b>slab</b> <b>laser</b> 38 W outpu t power was obtained at a electro-optical efficiency of 17 per cent.

This method removes waste pump heat by flowing slightly-chilled, turbulent gas over the flashlamps and blastshields after each shot, with the cooled blastshields serving as heat sinks for radiatively extracting residual heat deposited in the <b>laser</b> <b>slabs.</b> We performed both experiments and modeling to characterize residual optical distortions arising from both temperature gradients within the <b>laser</b> <b>slabs</b> {{as well as from}} buoyantly-driven convection currents in the amplifier cavity and attached beam tubes.

40|$|Several {{remote sensing}} {{applications}} require pulsed {{sources in the}} mid-infrared spectral regime with high average powers and good beam quality. Ho:YAG lasers {{have a number of}} attractive features for high power generation at 2. 1 microns, either for direct applications or as a pump source for parametric conversion to longer infra-red wavelengths. Unfortunately, direct diode pumping of Ho:YAG is not practical, so a two-step process is generally employed in which one or more diode-pumped thulium-doped lasers are used to directly pump (in-band) the Ho:YAG laser. In response, we have investigated a slab-based architecture for scaling the output power of a Tm:YLF laser to the 100 W power regime at 1. 91 microns, corresponding to a strong Ho:YAG absorption line. Multiple <b>slab</b> <b>lasers</b> with moderate beam quality in the plane of the slab can be combined to efficiently end-pump a low-doping concentration Ho:YAG rod in a pump-guided configuration.

40|$|A four-pass {{optical coupler}} affords {{increased}} (in comparison with related prior two-pass optical couplers) utilization of light {{generated by a}} laser diode in side pumping of a solid-state <b>laser</b> <b>slab.</b> The original application for which this coupler was conceived involves a neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) crystal slab, which, when pumped by a row of laser diodes at a wavelength of 809 nm, lases at a wavelength of 1, 064 nm. Heretofore, typically, a thin <b>laser</b> <b>slab</b> has been pumped in two passes, the second pass occurring by virtue of reflection of pump light from a highly reflective thin film on the side opposite the side through which the pump light enters. In two-pass pumping, a Nd:YAG slab having a thickness of 2 mm (which is typical) absorbs about 84 percent of the 809 -nm pump light power, leaving about 16 percent of the pump light power to travel back toward the laser diodes. This unused power can cause localized heating of the laser diodes, thereby reducing their lifetimes. Moreover, if the slab is thinner than 2 mm, then even more unused power travels back toward the laser diodes. The four-pass optical coupler captures most of this unused pump light and sends {{it back to the}} <b>laser</b> <b>slab</b> for two more passes. As a result, the slab absorbs more pump light, as though it were twice as thick.
