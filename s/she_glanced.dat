2500|$|Mr. A.'s wife - Vera's mother - {{had died}} in 1967. In December 1969, when Vera was {{recovering}} from an illness, <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> at her mother's framed photograph on the piano and wished they could still talk. With pen in hand Vera found herself writing - with difficulty - on the writing pad in front of her, [...] "I love you Vera." ...|$|E
6000|$|Winterbourne was {{watching}} the young girl; at this question his attention quickened. She stood there, smiling and smoothing her bonnet ribbons; <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> at Winterbourne. Then, while <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> and smiled, she answered, without a shade of hesitation, [...] "Mr. Giovanelli--the beautiful Giovanelli." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> at the shapeless heap, and shuddered. Agravaine nodded.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glances</b> at {{the face}} of the {{approaching}} man. They maintain a bashful silence until he has passed.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I see I {{have come}} to the right house,' said <b>she,</b> <b>glancing</b> at the lad, and smiling. 'But I was not sure till you opened the door.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quiet, indeed!" [...] said <b>she,</b> <b>glancing</b> {{round at}} the vast circle of silent moors, {{with the one}} tiny line of grey cottages which sloped down beneath us.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> {{across the}} room at him, half curiously, half scornfully.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> {{once more}} over her {{shoulder}} toward the village--perhaps beyond.|$|E
60|$|Then Miss Kinnaird laughed {{softly as}} <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> at her attire.|$|E
6000|$|... (<b>She</b> <b>glances</b> {{round her}} at the couples. Then her eyes rest on Bloom with hard insistence. Her large fan winnows wind towards her heated faceneck and embonpoint. Her falcon eyes glitter.) ...|$|R
50|$|A year later, Veronica {{is working}} as a {{cocktail}} waitress. <b>She</b> <b>glances</b> up at a television and sees Johnny. He's {{a member of a}} pit crew, having taken a step toward realizing his dream.|$|R
6000|$|My girl she's airy, she's buxom and gay; [...] Her {{breath is}} {{as sweet as}} the {{blossoms}} in May; [...] A touch of her lips it ravishes quite: [...] She's always good natur'd, good humour'd, and free; [...] <b>She</b> dances, <b>she</b> <b>glances,</b> <b>she</b> smiles upon me; [...] I never am happy when out of her sight.|$|R
60|$|And Dahlia {{was in the}} drawing-room. <b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> up at my entrance.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> {{about and}} noted the orator. Doubtless she divined the situation.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> at him entreatingly; the sarcasm was too bitter, too unendurable.|$|E
6000|$|... "All will be right, dear," [...] said <b>she,</b> <b>glancing</b> {{down at the}} fluffy yellow {{curls and}} tiny ear. [...] "There is still much to be done, but I think we may venture to order the trousseau." ...|$|R
50|$|A woman {{leaves her}} {{children}} {{for an evening}} {{to go to a}} nightclub. In a moment of indecision <b>she</b> <b>glances</b> back, slips and falls. Money, desire and dreams converge as she enters a surreal world of haunting colours and lyrical distortions.|$|R
6000|$|... "There is a {{great deal}} of it," [...] said <b>she,</b> <b>glancing</b> along the paper, and {{interrupting}} the sweetest sounds which mortal ears can drink in,--those of a youthful poet's verses, namely, read by the lips which are dearest to him.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> at him, a {{question}} in her eyes, then looked away.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> at his worn {{clothing}} and soiled white necktie, and smiled.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> at me {{swiftly and}} surely; {{and shook her}} head again.|$|E
6000|$|The widow laughs heartily and really. She {{places a}} {{handkerchief}} over her mouth. <b>She</b> <b>glances</b> at her brother {{with a pair}} of eyes full of knowing mischief. [...] "Ah, dear James," [...] she says, [...] "you don't {{know what it is to}} have a mother's feelings." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Professor Gilroy is not satisfied," [...] said <b>she,</b> <b>glancing</b> {{up at me}} {{with her}} strange little eyes. [...] "My poor fan is to get the credit of that experiment. Well, we must try {{something}} else. Miss Marden, would you have any objection to my putting you off?" ...|$|R
60|$|ZOE: Me. Mind your cornflowers. (She darts to {{the piano}} and bangs chords on it with crossed arms) The cat's ramble through the slag. (<b>She</b> <b>glances</b> back) Eh? Who's making love to my sweeties? (She darts back to the table) What's yours is mine and what's mine is my own.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> at {{the little}} Yale key which hung from her bracelet.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> at {{the porch}} against {{which a man}} was still leaning.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> {{down at her}} high-necked {{gown and}} avoided Helen's anxious eyes.|$|E
60|$|Fanny, after {{following}} a few steps, stops and thinks. Ernest has entered with the wood. He is piling {{it in the}} basket by the fire. His entrance decides her. <b>She</b> <b>glances</b> {{through the open door}} of the dressing-room, then flies across to the desk, seats herself, and begins feverishly to write a telegram.|$|R
6000|$|MISS GALBRAITH, rises, {{and goes}} to the large mirror to wipe away her tears. <b>She</b> <b>glances</b> at Mr. Richards, who does not move. She sits down in a seat nearer him than the chair she has left. After some faint murmurs and hesitations, she asks, [...] "Will you please tell me why you went out just now?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> merely <b>glanced</b> {{up at his}} entrance. Her {{eyes were}} still far away.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> {{towards the}} opened windows, and he closed them at once.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> {{up at him}} and waited. Arnold, however, {{had stopped}} short.|$|E
60|$|She {{was silent}} for several moments. Then <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> at him curiously.|$|E
6000|$|... "How fanciful he is! And his conversation,--one {{might think}} he had {{acquired}} the art at Marly or in the Fauxbourg. In truth, {{he should have been}} born {{on the far side of}} the Channel. And he has the air of the great man," [...] said <b>she,</b> <b>glancing</b> up at ms, covertly. [...] "For my part, I prefer a little more bluntness." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> {{scarcely}} <b>glanced</b> {{at him as}} {{she sent}} him away, yet Tavernake walked on air.|$|R
6000|$|... “You see, ’tis a gala {{day with}} us,” says <b>she,</b> <b>glancing</b> {{down to the}} star complacently, “and we have our orders on. Does not mamma look charming? ’Twas I dressed her!” Indeed, Esmond’s dear mistress, {{blushing}} {{as he looked at}} her, with her beautiful fair hair and an elegant dress, according to the mode, appeared to have the shape and complexion of a girl of twenty.|$|R
