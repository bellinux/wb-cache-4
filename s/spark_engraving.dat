We present a novel technique which uses only purely physical processes to fabricate linear chain conductors which seem to meet all claims laid by the CDW mechanism of conductivity in its ideal form. A <b>spark</b> <b>engraves</b> in an originally low-conducting nonlinear silver-based material, driven far from equilibrium beyond some critical power input, a discharge pattern, inside the branches of which chains of Ag+-ions run which form a high-conducting current path, along which CDWs may propagate nearly unattenuated. The material obtained exhibits an electrical conductivity which is by four orders of magnitude higher than the conductivity of metallic silver. A simple model is presented to explain this high conductivity and some related phenomena associated with electrical conduction via a moving CDW...|$|R

Prior to use, the glass apertures were rendered hydrophobic by a silanization process and were then incorporated into a simple microfluidic device.

Due to the simplicity and rapidity of the SACE process, these glass apertures could be easily integrated into an all-glass microfluidic system for BLM formation...|$|R
40|$|As {{the field}} of {{microelectromechanical}} systems (MEMS) matures, new demands are being placed on the microfabrication of complex architectures in robust materials, such as hard plastics. Iterative design optimization in a timely manner—rapid prototyping—places challenges on template fabrication, for methods such as injection moulding and hot embossing. In this paper, we demonstrate {{the possibility of using}} <b>spark</b> assisted chemical <b>engraving</b> (SACE) to produce micro patterned glass templates. The direct, write-based approach enabled the facile fabrication of smooth microfeatures with variations in all three-dimensions, which could be replicated by hot embossing different thermoplastics. As a proof of principle, we demonstrated the technique for a high glass transition temperature polycarbonate. Good fidelity over more than 10 cycles provides evidence that the approach is viable for rapid prototyping and has the potential to satisfy commercial-grade production at medium-level output volumes. Glass imprint templates showed no degradation after use, but care must be taken due to brittleness. The technique has the potential to advance microfabrication needs in academia and could be used by MEMS product developers...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an investigation on the gravity feed micro-drilling <b>spark</b> assisted chemical <b>engraving</b> (GFMD-SACE). The competitive {{advantage of the}} GFMD-SACE process is its combined simplicity and low-cost with high aspect ratio and smooth surface finish. As long as these values are well-preserved and intensified, this process will take {{a share in the}} market of micro-fabrication. The main objective {{of this study is to}} establish a systematic approach of the improvement in GFMD-SACE by minimizing initially different variabilities in the process. The methodology is to observe in details the process by adapting the six sigma procedures to determine the major error states and their root causes. To this end, the process initial documentations are created such that it keeps the door wide open for continuous improvement. Based on the initial evaluation, an improved process is recommended on the tool electrode thermal and material properties, electrolyte levels and the use of pulse voltage.

Micro fabrication is the means of turning the new designs and ideas in micro and nano technology into devices that benefit mankind. Among the materials used in microfluidic devices, glass has very interesting properties such as transparency, chemical resistance, bio-compatibility and low electrical conductivity. Conventional glass patterning can be performed via chemical or physical processes. <b>Spark</b> assisted chemical <b>engraving</b> (SACE) is an unconventional micro-machining technology based on electrochemical discharges used for micro-machining of non-conductive materials. SACE Glass 2 D-micro- machining was characterized and parameters affecting the quality and geometry of the micro-channels were presented and the effect of each of the parameters assessed. Chemical contribution to the material removal mechanism is investigated. The results from the FT-IR analysis on the machined sample and Inductive Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) test showed that chemical etching at high local temperatures is the major phenomenon contributing to the machining process. Calculations of removed mass by analytical balance and geometrical methods, followed by the results from the nano-indentation test indicate that the hardness and density of the machined surface decrease during the machining process. Finally microfluidic components fully fabricated by SACE are presente...|$|R
40|$|Glass is {{a fantastic}} {{material}} for a medical device. It is biocompatible, chemically inert, straightforward sterilisable and optically transparent, but machining is also a challenge. <b>Spark</b> Assisted Chemical <b>Engraving</b> (SACE) is a hybrid technology based on thermally assisted chemical etching of glass. Discovered by Kurafuji and Suda in 1968 [1], this process now emerges at the industrial level as a flexible, rapid and cost-effective possibility to machine the glass. This novel technology machines the glass without burrs, cracks or deposits on the surface. A pulsed potential [2] is applied between the tool and a counter-electrode into a conductive electrolyte, typically NaOH. Sparks appear at the tool, which allows increasing the temperature of electrolyte locally around the tool. The electrolyte, when heated, becomes highly corrosive for glass, which is ?electro-dissolved? locally. This process coupled to a highly accurate Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine allows drilling micro-holes with a depth of millimetres {{in a few seconds}} and mills channels of several hundred microns deep without difficulty. With this equipment, it is also possible to cut the glass over a thickness of a few millimetres or create a chamfer, for example. All these machining methods can be realized directly, without any intermediate process. After presenting the SACE process and technology, some applications in medical and microfluidic areas will be demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study of}} the variability in <b>spark</b> assisted chemical <b>engraving</b> (SACE) gravity feed drilling in glass. SACE gravity feed drilling is a novel micromachining technology for use on non-conducting materials that has yet to move beyond academic investigation. However, SACE is a promising technology. It can be used to create high quality structures, at low cost, using a machine that could be installed into any laboratory. One problem SACE faces is it has issues with reproducibility. This is why the variability of the process is studied here. The goal of this thesis is to quantify and reduce the variability in SACE gravity feed drilling. This goal is accomplished through three steps. First, the process is modeled to provide an efficient way to quantify variability. Two new stochastic models are presented that relate the depth evolution of SACE gravity feed drilling to the voltage. Statistical tests are used to validate the models. Second, experimental studies of the variability of the depth evolution are discussed. The effect on the variability of having poorly regulated bulk electrolyte temperature and level is studied. Finally, experimental results from two feedback controllers that are capable of reducing the variability in SACE gravity feed drilling are discussed. The results from these controllers are compared with the predictions of one of the models developed...|$|R
40|$|We are {{surrounded}} by glass! This material has been greatly used for thousand years. More than 2000 years ago in ancient Egypt glass was used to manufacture bottles of perfume. So its first uses were primarily related to decoration and jewellery. The researchers left its decorative use to introduce it to new technologies. Today miniaturisation is a major technological challenge. Material machining to micrometric or submicrometric scale becomes {{one of the key}} techniques for the future. Glass is often involved in these miniaturized devices. This interest can be explained by its properties: glass is transparent and has a good chemical durability. Many techniques of glass micromachining exist from laser to HF etching and sand powder blasting. In this work, we introduce a glass microstructuring technique, that we called <b>Spark</b> Assisted Chemical <b>Engraving</b> (SACE). It was presented {{for the first time in}} the Sixties to drill microholes in glass (diameter = 6  μ). Since the first use of SACE as machining technology in 1968, theoretical approaches were proposed in literature to understand the process. They are based on thermal models by finite elements method or on electrical characterization, with ohmic resistances calculations. They give a good quantitative approximation of the material removal rate. The goals of the thesis are to achieve a local understanding of the process and to highlight electrochemical and thermal phenomena involved around tool-electrode tip before and during SACE process. This thesis will try to answer two questions: How does SACE work? and how to apply it to microstructure glass? A new approach based on potential sweep is proposed to study the process. The originality consists in matching electrochemical measurements with high resolution photographs from the tool-electrode. This report is structured in three parts. A bibliographical part, which introduces not only glass as a material but also presents technologies for glass microstructuration (including SACE). A theoretical part, which focuses on describing current behaviour before spark formation, which allows material removal. It starts by a theoretical recall of variations of electric parameters (conductivity, resistance) as a function of gas hold-up. This theory is then applied to build a model, based on resistance calculations in the system. The goal of this model is to explain electrochemical measurements. An experimental part, which validates the theory developed to explain what happens before spark formation. Characteristics of sparks are then studied by a technique based on voltage pulses and used in a finite elements model. Finally, we will present concrete results, illustrating SACE possibilities to drill microholes. A mechanical prototype for SACE was developed during this thesis and is presented for microreactors fabrication and other glass microstructurations...|$|R
40|$|Glass {{has stirred}} human {{interest}} {{since the dawn}} of history due to its unique properties including its high mechanical strength, transparency, thermal and chemical properties. With the great technological advancement that we are witnessing today in the micro-technology field, glass micro-machining has already found applications in the optical, electronics, and biomedical applications. In fact, such applications require high-aspect-ratio structures of defined wall flatness and surface roughness. There exist nowadays several glass micro-machining technologies that are being developed to meet this demand. These are based on thermal (laser), chemical (dry and wet etching), and mechanical (ultrasonic, abrasive and diamond-tool drilling) processes. <b>Spark</b> Assisted Chemical <b>Engraving</b> (SACE) is a non conventional glass micro-machining technology which is based on discharge generation at the tool tip. This is known to heat up the glass surface. Today, the machining mechanism is highly questionable where it is explained differently by many researchers in the field. This {{is due to the fact}} that the basic understanding about the process and the local variables in the machining zone is still missing. Although research about SACE drilling has allowed achieving deeper and smaller holes, these results remain specific to certain machining conditions. In fact, they are achieved experimentally by trial and error due to limited knowledge about the process fundamentals. Therefore, it can be said that SACE machining is still blind where the idea of doing feed-back drilling has not been explored sufficiently. These are the basic reasons of why SACE glass machining remains in laboratories and is never applied in industry. The aim of this work is to unveil basic information about the SACE machining process and the local parameters in the machining zone. For this purpose, a methodology is developed for measuring the local machining zone parameters based on the force exerted on the tool during machining. Measurement errors caused by tool bending, wear and thermal expansion are quantified and considered while measuring and analysing the machining forces. Thus, in a first step, the machining force is characterized and analysed to get a deeper understanding about its origin and the reasons of its formation. This signal is used in a second step to extract information about local variables including the machining gap size, the local glass surface temperature and the origin of its texture. Based on the understanding of the machining process that this work brings, a thermal model is built which describes heat transfer to the glass surface. The agreement between calculations and measurements ensures the validity of both the model and measurement methodology. Based on the results, the machining mechanism is explained as a thermal assisted etching process. Machining can exist in two modes based on the electrolyte state (aqueous or molten) which depends on the local flushing. Force signal readings showed that tool-glass bonding can occur during machining which may hinder the drilling progress. Based on the understanding that this work brought about the machining mechanism and the factors that influence it, force feedback algorithms are built with the aim to establish a balance between local heating and flushing. The efficiency of the various algorithms in enhancing the drilling performance was compared and assessed based on the resulting drilling time. The knowledge acquired allowed building algorithms that succeeded in drilling high-aspect-ratio holes up to 1 : 9 while using very small tools (70 microns diameter) without breakage. The resulting drilling time is dramatically reduced to few seconds compared to several minutes in the state-of-the-art SACE drilling. ...|$|R
