25|$|Recognition {{memory is}} {{sometimes}} {{divided into two}} functions by neuroscientists: familiarity and recollection. A strong <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>familiarity</b> can occur without any recollection, for example in cases of deja vu. The temporal lobe, in particular the perirhinal cortex, responds differently to stimuli which feel novel than to things which feel familiar. Firing rates in the perirhinal cortex are connected with the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>familiarity</b> in humans and other mammals. In tests, stimulating this area at 10–15Hz caused animals to treat even novel images as familiar, and stimulation at 30–40Hz caused novel images to be partially treated as familiar. Specifically, stimulation at 30–40Hz led to animals looking at a familiar image for longer periods, as they would for an unfamiliar one; {{but it did not}} lead to the same exploration behavior normally associated with novelty. Recent studies on lesions in the area concluded that rats with a damaged perirhinal cortex were still more interested in exploring when novel objects were present, but seemed unable to tell novel objects from familiar ones — they examined both equally. Thus, other brain regions are involved with noticing unfamiliarity, but the perirhinal cortex is needed to associate the feeling with a specific source.|$|E
25|$|The Okinawan {{origin of}} the word, however, has long been questioned. In fact, it was in {{mainland}} Japan that the word was first attested and eventually came to refer to Okinawa. The first known reference to uruma is a waka poem by Fujiwara no Kintō in the early 11th century. He compared a woman's coldheartedness to the incomprehensible speech of drifters from Ureung Island (迂陵島, identified as Ulleung Island) of Goryeo Kingdom, which Kintō called Silla, a practice rather common in Heian-period Japan. However, the association with Ulleung Island was soon forgotten because the reference to Silla was dropped when his poem was recorded in the Senzai Wakashū (1188). Thereafter waka poets only thought uruma as an island somewhere outside Japan with an unintelligible language. At the same time, it evoked a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>familiarity</b> because the phrase uruma no ichi (market in Uruma) was poetically associated with Mino Province. From the viewpoint of mainland Japanese poets, Okinawa {{might have been an}} ideal referent of uruma because, despite the exotic name of Ryūkyū, the first reference to Okinawan-composed waka poems was as early as 1496. The first known identification of uruma as Okinawa Island {{can be found in the}} Moshiogusa (1513), but the association remained weak for some time. For example, Hokkaido, in addition to Okinawa, was referred to as uruma in the Shōzaishū (1597). The mainland Japanese poetic practice was adopted by Okinawan waka poets in the late 17th century. The Omoidegusa (1700), a purely Japanese poetic diary by Shikina Seimei, is known for its extensive use of the word uruma.|$|E

Dominating the intangible pull of Egypt is the ever present Nile, which is more than a constant backdrop. Its varying colors and changing water levels signal the coming and going of the Nile flood that sets the rhythm of farming in a rainless country and holds the attention of all Egyptians. No Egyptian is ever far from his river and, except for the Alexandrines whose personality is split by looking outward toward the Mediterranean, the Egyptians are a hinterland people with little appetite for travel, even inside their own country. They glorify their national dishes, including the variety of concoctions surrounding the simple bean. Most of all, they have a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> all-encompassing <b>familiarity</b> at home and a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> alienation when abroad ...

He is aware of the goddess's true identity and foretells her future and at times battles with her.

The other is Orochi, the eight-headed demon and a major villain within the game which the player will encounter several times. Orochi repeatedly has threatened Kamiki village, demanding a sacrifice of a young woman. Each of its eight heads is infused with a different elemental magic power, but the entire demon is susceptible to a special brew of sake available only at Kamiki Village, allowing Amaterasu to defeat it while in its stupor. Amaterasu trusts Queen Himiko, the ruler of [...] "Sei-an City", who is killed by one of the demons.|$|E

40|$|How is place-making as a {{tool for}} the {{formation}} of social identities related to categories, networks and categorical networks? How do people use the built environment and hence, following Massey, create places in space? Such questions are asked to reverse the usual way of looking at urban neighbourhoods. The neighbourhood in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, where the ethnographic research for this article was conducted, is not taken for granted. The symbolic meanings and practical uses the neighbourhood has today and has had over the past 75 years are discussed in relation to class and social networks. Local networks, grounded in everyday activities, provided a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> class-based <b>familiarity</b> when the shipbuilding industry (1900 - 60) reigned. This did not necessarily produce communities as people imagined them, but it did produce quite local, and categorical, networks. However, such "catnets" on the local level can no longer be taken for granted, if they ever could. This article addresses how elderly people within a neighbourhood use the built environment to: (1) produce new local networks (by using local facilities as meeting points) and new social identifications with others; (2) imagine a community by developing a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> 'localness' rather than 'class' as a shared category, although they have a similar class position; and (3) produce collective memories and, in the process of this production, format the neighbourhood symbolically. In doing so, they reduce the multi-layered identities of earlier times to a one-dimensional memory of the working-class community which is equated with the neighbourhood. This enables this group of elderly people to make <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> their contemporary, changing social environment. Copyright Joint Editors and Blackwell Publishers Ltd 2001. ...|$|R
