We {{found that the}} experimental and calculated combustion pressures were close near the <b>stoichiometric</b> combustion <b>point.</b> At other compositions, particularly near the flammable limits, the calculated equilibrium pressures were much higher.

Charge-reversal of the MB-PE complex particles has been observed by the microscopic electrophoresis method, revealing unusual overcharging behaviors in MB-PE complex solutions, as follows. The critical concentrations of cationic PEs added for overcharging were not only independent of their chain lengths and molecular species, but also much larger than <b>stoichiometric</b> neutralization <b>points.</b> Thus, we provide a theoretical sketch that considers the adsorption-desorption kinetics of small anions on the surface of genuine microbubbles, which can explain the inefficient charge-reversal...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{performance}} of the charged aerosol detector (CAD) was investigated using a diverse set of 29 solutes, including acids, bases and neutrals, over a range of mobile phase compositions, {{particularly with regard to}} its suitability for use in hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC). Flow injection analysis was employed as a rapid method to study detector performance. CAD response was ‘quasi-universal’, strong signals were observed for compounds that have low volatility at typical operating (room) temperature. For relatively involatile solutes, response was reasonably independent of solute chemistry, giving variation of 12 – 18 % RSD from buffered 95 % ACN (HILIC) to 10 % ACN (RP). Somewhat higher response was obtained for basic compared with neutral solutes. For cationic basic solutes, use of anionic reagents of increasing size in the mobile phase (formic, trifluoroacetic and heptafluorobutyric acid) produced somewhat increased detector response, suggesting that salt formation with these reagents is contributory. However, the increase was not <b>stoichiometric,</b> <b>pointing</b> to a complex mechanism. In general, CAD response increased as the concentration of acetonitrile in the mobile phase was increased from highly aqueous (10 % ACN) to values typical in the HILIC range (80 – 95 % ACN), with signal to noise ratios about four times higher than those for the RP range. The response of the CAD is non-linear. Equations describing aerosol formation cannot entirely explain the shape of the plots. Limits of detection (determined with a column for solutes of low k) under HILIC conditions were of the order of 1 – 3 ng on column, which compares favourably with other universal detectors. CAD response to inorganic anions allows observation of the independent movement through the column of the cationic and anionic constituents of basic drugs, which appear to be accompanied by mobile phase counterions, even at quite high solute concentrations...|$|R

Different hydrocarbon fuels have different contents of carbon, hydrogen and other elements, thus their stoichiometry varies.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} use of gradients {{of concentration}} generated in flow injection (FI) systems to perform determinations based on points where {{the concentration of}} titrant and analyte are at stoichiometric ratio. Two procedures were developed. In one procedure the titrant is injected in a FI manifold and merges with the sample which is continuously pumped towards the detector. In the other procedure the sample is injected and merged with the titrant which is continuously pumped. Both techniques make use of concentration gradients of the sample or titrant generated in FI manifolds that contain a mixing chamber. This gradient is calibrated employing only one standard solution (usually the titrant) in order to convert any detector signal, obtained in the elapsed time after injection, to instantaneous concentration values. The flow system is microcomputer controlled and data are treated to locate points where the concentration of titrant and analyte are at the <b>stoichiometric</b> ratio. These <b>points</b> are found in abrupt changes of the signal × concentration curves obtained {{in the presence of}} the reaction. The method has been evaluated for determination of Fe(II) and acetic acid by spectrophotometric and conductimetric detection, respectively. Results show a mean relative standard deviation lower than 1 %, an average accuracy of 1 % and a high sampling processing capability (40 to 60 samples per hour) ...|$|R
40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2010. Includes bibliographical references. Mosses are an understudied {{group of}} plants that can {{potentially}} confirm or expand principles of plant function described for tracheophytes, from which they diverge strongly in structure. Resaerch was undertaken to assess whether mosses follow patterns already observed in vascular plants such as optimization of performance by modification of functional "clusters" of trait-trait and trait-environment correlations, increase of tissue δ 13 C associated with greater microhabitat irradiance and altitude, and nutrient content and stoichiometry associated with soil fertiliy and other environmental gradients. A total of 40 physiological and morphological traits were measured from 17 ground-, trunk-and branch-dwelling Hawaiian moss species and one liverwort species to test the hypotheses that 1) trait values would reflect the distinctive growth form and slow growth of mosses, but also that trait correlations would be analogous to those of tracheophytes, 2) moss carbon isotope ratios would correlate with irradiance and elevation, and 3) moss nutrient concentrations would follow stoichiometric patterns found in vascular plants. The moss species had low leaf mass per area (LMA) and low gas exchange rates, but unlike tracheophytes, light-saturated photosynthetic rate per mass (Amass) did not correlate with habitat irradiance. Other photosynthetic parameters and structural traits were aligned with microhabitat irradiance, driving inter-correlation of traits including leaf area, cell size, cell wall thickness, and canopy density. Across species, Amass and nitrogen concentration correlated negatively with canopy mass per area (CMA), analogous to linkages found for the "leaf economic spectrum," with CMA replacing LMA. Bryophytes were remarkably similar to vascular plants in exhibiting greater δ 13 C with increasing elevation and microhabitiat irradiance. Results supported stoichiometric theory: mass-based nutrient concentrations increased with nutrient availability; area-based nutrient concentrations increased with irradiance as mediated by bryophyte canopy mass per area; N and P followed the general scaling shown previously for tracheophytes; and P increased and N:P decreased with elevation consistent with increasing cold tolerance. These findings extend the generality of <b>stoichiometric</b> theory, <b>pointing</b> to convergent physiological responses across distantly related lineages, operating across local and global resource gradients. Despite divergence of mosses and tracheophytes in leaf size and function, analogous trait coordination has arisen during ecological differentiation...|$|R
50|$|Three-way {{converters}} {{are effective}} when {{the engine is}} operated within a narrow band of air-fuel ratios near the <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>point,</b> such that the exhaust gas composition oscillates between rich (excess fuel) and lean (excess oxygen). Conversion efficiency falls very rapidly when the engine is operated outside of this band. Under lean engine operation, the exhaust contains excess oxygen, and the reduction of NOx is not favored. Under rich conditions, the excess fuel consumes all of the available oxygen prior to the catalyst, leaving only oxygen stored in the catalyst available for the oxidation function.|$|E
50|$|As {{the motor}} burns, the {{increase}} in diameter of the fuel port results in an increased {{fuel mass flow rate}}. This phenomenon makes the oxidizer to fuel ratio (O/F) shift during the burn. The increased fuel mass flow rate can be compensated for by also increasing the oxidizer mass flow rate. In addition to the O/F varying as a function of time, it also varies based on the position down the fuel grain. The closer the position is {{to the top of the}} fuel grain, the higher the O/F ratio. Since the O/F varies down the port, a point called the <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>point</b> may exist at some point down the grain.|$|E
50|$|These three {{reactions}} occur most efficiently {{when the}} catalytic converter receives exhaust from an engine running slightly above the <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>point.</b> For gasoline combustion, this ratio is between 14.6 and 14.8 parts air to one part fuel, by weight. The ratio for Autogas (or {{liquefied petroleum gas}} LPG), natural gas and ethanol fuels is slightly different for each, requiring modified fuel system settings when using those fuels. In general, engines fitted with 3-way catalytic converters are equipped with a computerized closed-loop feedback fuel injection system using one or more oxygen sensors, though early in the deployment of three-way converters, carburetors equipped with feedback mixture control were used.|$|E
50|$|Though {{increasing}} {{the ratio of}} metal fuel to oxidizer up to the <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>point</b> increases the combustion temperature, {{the presence of an}} increasing molar fraction of metal oxides, particularly aluminum oxide (Al2O3) precipitating from the gaseous solution creates globules of solids or liquids that slow down the flow velocity as the mean molecular mass of the flow increases. In addition, the chemical composition of the gases change, varying the effective heat capacity of the gas. Because of these phenomena, there exists an optimal non-stoichiometric composition for maximizing Isp of roughly 16% by mass, assuming the combustion reaction goes to completion inside the combustion chamber.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{influence}} of charge ratio on the transient network formation of bridged polyelectrolyte complex micelles. The polyelectrolyte complex micelles are based on mixing an ABA triblock copolymer in which the A-blocks are positively charged and the B-block is neutral and hydrophilic, and a negatively charged homopolymer. We investigate the microstructure of our samples with (dynamic) light scattering and small-angle X-ray scattering, and the mechanical properties by rheometry. At charge stoichiometric conditions, we obtain flowerlike polyelectrolyte complex micelles. These micelles become interconnected at high concentrations, leading to a sample-spanning transient network. For excess negative charge conditions, we obtain so-called ‘soluble complexes’ which are small aggregates carrying the excess negative charge on the polyelectrolyte complex parts. For excess positive charge conditions, micelles stay intact, because the triblock copolymers can localize the excess positive charge at {{the periphery of the}} micellar corona.
