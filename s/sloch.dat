50|$|Geographically {{the town}} is, broadly speaking, {{laid out in}} a linear fashion, {{following}} the coastline. There is a lower shore area and an upper area. Fundamentally Buckie itself is {{the central part of the}} community lying between the Victoria Bridge under which flows the Buckie Burn at the western end of West Church Street, the eastern end of Cluny Harbour and above the shore area. To the west of Victoria Bridge and the Buckie Burn is Buckpool which was formerly known as Nether Buckie and on the shoreline, west of Cluny Harbour, between Baron Street and the Buckie Burn mouth, there is The Yardie. Immediately above The Yardie on the Buckie side of the burn is The Seatown. To the west of The Yardie is Harbourhead. To the east of Cluny Harbour lie Ianstown, Gordonsburgh and Portessie also known locally as The <b>Sloch</b> (historically The Rotten Slough) which reaches towards Strathlene. These communities were, to all intents and purposes, separate fishing settlements which gradually merged over the course of time. A new town was laid out above the shoreline in the 19th century and this is the rump of Buckie.|$|E
5000|$|There are two {{significant}} summits on the line; [...] Drumochter Summit (also spelled Druimuachdar) (elevation 1484 ft) between Blair Atholl and Dalwhinnie, and <b>Slochd</b> Summit (elevation 1315 ft) between Carrbridge and Inverness. Other distinct {{features on the}} route include the viaducts at Culloden and Tomatin, the spectacular mountain pass at Drumochter and the severe gradients encountered in both directions, particularly the extended climb from Inverness to the <b>Slochd</b> summit which averages around 1 in 60 the whole way.|$|R
50|$|The route {{north from}} Pitlochry roughly follows {{the route of}} the A9 road and Highland Main Line railway through the Grampian {{mountains}} via the Pass of Killiecrankie, Pass of Drumochter and <b>Slochd</b> Summit to the Moray Firth at Inverness.|$|R
5000|$|The current {{station was}} opened in 1898, to designs by the {{architect}} William Roberts when the [...] "direct" [...] line to Inverness via <b>Slochd</b> was built, making Aviemore an important junction and replacing the original 1863 building. William Roberts also provided an engine shed {{to the north}} of the station in 1896.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Slochd</b> Summit ( [...] ; An Sloc) is a {{mountain}} {{pass on the}} A9 road and the Highland Main Line Railway in the Scottish Highlands between Inverness and Aviemore. An old military road also goes through the pass. National Cycle Network route 7 also goes over the summit, largely following the old A9.|$|R
50|$|Both {{the road}} and the railway have signs marking the spot - the A9 is at a height of 1328 ft, while the railway reaches 1315 ft. The <b>Slochd</b> Summit is the second highest place on the route from Inverness to Perth - the Pass of Drumochter at 1500 ft is higher and bleaker.|$|R
5000|$|... "As I {{came through}} the <b>slochd</b> (ravine) by east the hill there, I foregathered wi' the beast. My long dog there turned him. I bucked wi' him, and dirkit him, and syne whuttled his craig (cut his throat), and brought awa' his countenance for fear he might come alive again, for they are very {{precarious}} creatures.|$|R
50|$|Mackinnon was {{the eldest}} son of John Og Mackinnon, {{probably}} {{to be identified as}} the brother of Sir Lachlan Mackinnon of Strath. Clan traditions relate that his life was in danger as a child and that he spent some time in hiding in a cave, known ever since as <b>Slochd</b> Altrimen (“the Nursing Cave”). He graduated with an M.A. from the University of Glasgow in 1626.|$|R
5000|$|On 4 January 2010, {{a freight}} train from Inverness to Grangemouth, hauled by a DB Schenker Class 66 for Stobart Rail, derailed on the 1 in 60 (1.67%) {{gradient}} down from <b>Slochd</b> Summit at the run out or catch points at {{the northern end of}} the station, and ran down an embankment. The driver and technician on the train suffered minor injuries. The line was not reopened until 13 January.|$|R
25|$|The section between Perth and Inverness {{is often}} cited as being the most {{dangerous}} section of the road, and regularly appears in lists of Scotland's most dangerous roads. This portion of the road is mostly single-carriageway, however there are intermittent short sections of dual carriageway from Perth to Luncarty, Bankfoot to Birnam, Pitlochry to Killiecrankie, south of Drumochter Summit, <b>Slochd</b> Summit to Tomatin and south of Inverness as well as shorter three lane overtaking sections to reduce frustration and accidents. All the towns on {{this section of the}} route have now been bypassed.|$|R
50|$|Ben Avon is a {{very large}} and complex {{mountain}} sprawling over more than 30 km². The summit plateau is dominated by granite tors, one of which forms the summit. From the broad summit plateau ridges lead in almost every direction, allowing access from Glen Avon to the north, from Beinn a' Bhùird to the west and from Gleann an t-Slugain in the south. To the west of the summit lies the massive corrie, <b>Slochd</b> Mòr, with its rocky cliffs, and the approaches from the south and west take you close to the corrie rim.|$|R

50|$|After {{crossing}} the River Spey the road {{ran along the}} western side of Strathspey via Kincraig, Alvie and Aviemore to Kinveachy. Here it set out northwestwards, away from the modern roads, to cross the River Dulnain by means of the high stone arch of Sluggan Bridge - a crossing now used by the National Cycle Network. Wade took the road through the pass at The <b>Slochd</b> just as the modern road does, and crossed the River Findhorn at Raigbeg. He chose to cross the River Nairn at Bridge of Faillie before running the road a last few miles over Drummossie Muir to the barracks at Fort George, Inverness.|$|R
5000|$|The {{succession}} {{is divided}} into two subgroups; the Dava Subgroup (previously referred to as the Dava Succession) and the Glen Banchor Subgroup. The former, named from the locality of Dava between Inverness and Grantown-on-Spey includes the <b>Slochd</b> Psammite and Flichity Semipelite formations. The latter is named for Glen Banchor, west of Newtonmore, the type area being from here to Laggan. The Glen Banchor sequence is believed to be between 1 and 1.5km thick and unconformably overlain by rocks of the Grampian and Appin groups, though the boundary may be tectonic in nature. [...] Long the subject of debate as to how they relate to surrounding rock sequences, some geologists place the Badenoch Group within the Moine Supergroup whilst others describe them as simply ‘Moine-like’. The lithologies of these rocks suggest deposition in shallow marine conditions.|$|R
40|$|The Monadhliath Mountains {{comprise}} of an extensive area of plateau in the Central Highlands of Scotland, which is bounded {{to the north}} by the Great Glen and to the south by Strathspey. The region is located immediately to the northwest of the Cairngorm Mountains, {{to the north of}} Creag Meagaidh and to the northeast of the Ben Nevis Range, forming a nearly continuous area of upland from Glen Roy westwards to where the A 9 crosses <b>Slochd</b> Summit (Fig. A). The upland consists of rounded summits and is dissected by at least twenty-five key catchments. It is divided to an extent in two by the Corrieyairack pass, forming a much smaller area of upland in the west, to the north of Glen Roy, and a larger (main) plateau in the central and eastern part of the region. This main plateau slopes downwards towards the north, with the altitude of the plateau edge ranging from 900 m in the south, with individual summits as high as 945 m (Carn Dearg, NH 636 024), to 600 m in the north. As a result, the main watershed runs from west to east across the southern edge of the plateau, and this asymmetry is manifest in short, steep catchments {{on the south side of}} the plateau, with the majority of the plateau draining northwards or eastwards within large catchment areas. Valleys draining the plateau to the south tend to have steep backwalls separating the valley floor from the plateau above whilst catchments in the north gently rise onto the plateau, often with no backwall. This asymmetry has significantly affected the form and dynamics of glaciers in the region and is discussed further by Boston (this guide) ...|$|R
