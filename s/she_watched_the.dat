5|$|As Styles was {{examining}} the ricochet marks, Alison Cahn {{was approached by}} an elderly woman, who led Cahn to a nearby apartment building. There, the woman introduced Cahn to her daughter—Carmen Proetta—who told Cahn that she had witnessed the shooting at the petrol station; although initially reluctant, she was persuaded by Cahn to give her account of the events in an affidavit. Proetta asserted that, immediately before McCann and Farrell were shot, she saw a police car travelling north on Winston Churchill Avenue with its siren activated; as <b>she</b> <b>watched,</b> <b>the</b> police car stopped abruptly and four men—one uniformed police officer and three men in civilian clothes—jumped out. She stated that the three men in plain clothes, all carrying pistols, leapt across the central reservation barrier, at which point she saw McCann and Farrell raise their hands. Proetta believed that all three men then opened fire, while McCann and Farrell had their hands in the air, and that neither suspect made any movements towards their clothing or Farrell's handbag. She went on to state that she witnessed {{one of the men}} crouch over McCann and Farrell while they were on the ground, and continue to shoot them. According to Styles, Proetta's account of the shooting tallied with the bullet marks he examined at the petrol station; he also found her description of the bullets striking the bodies particularly convincing, believing that only somebody who had witnessed such an event would be able to describe it so vividly. The journalists also discovered that Proetta's account of the soldiers arriving in a police car matched some of the newspaper reports from the day after the shootings.|$|E

25|$|In Now You See It: How the Brain Science of Attention Will Transform the Way We Live, Work, and Learn Cathy Davidson {{examines}} {{the phenomenon of}} attention blindness: humans perceive {{only a fraction of}} everything going on around us, particularly when we're focusing intently on one specific task, and that this attention blindness does not properly prepare us for the multi-task oriented digital age. According to Davidson, attention blindness is a basic neurological feature of the human brain. In the introduction of Now You See It, Davidson describes attending a lecture on attention blindness which addressed the tendency of the human brain to concentrate intensely on one task at the expense of missing almost everything else. To demonstrate this tendency, the lecturer showed a video of six people passing basketballs back and forth, and instructed viewers to count the number of tosses only between those wearing white shirts. Many people correctly counted fifteen tosses, yet nearly everyone failed to see someone in a full gorilla suit stride in among those tossing basketballs, then walk away. Davidson, who is dyslexic, didn’t even try to keep count, but instead decided to relax as <b>she</b> <b>watched</b> <b>the</b> tape, and thus, she noticed the gorilla.|$|E

500|$|Barr became outraged when <b>she</b> <b>watched</b> <b>the</b> {{first episode}} of Roseanne {{and noticed that}} in the credits, Williams was listed as creator.

[...] In the same interview, Werner said, [...] "I don't think Roseanne, to this day, understands that this is {{something}} legislated by the Writers Guild, and it's part of what every show has to deal with. They're the final arbiters." [...] During the first season, Barr sought more creative control over the show, opposing Williams' authority. Barr refused to say certain lines and eventually walked off set. She threatened to quit the show if Williams did not leave. ABC let Williams go after the thirteenth episode.|$|E
500|$|Historians often {{assume that}} Catherine's {{love for the}} arts stemmed from her Medici heritage. [...] "As the {{daughter}} of the Medici," [...] suggests French art historian Jean-Pierre Babelon, [...] "she was driven by a passion to build and a desire to leave great achievements behind her when she died." [...] Born in Florence in 1519, Catherine lived at the Medici palace, built by Cosimo de' Medici to designs by [...] Michelozzo di Bartolomeo. After moving to Rome in 1530, she lived, surrounded by classical and Renaissance treasures, at another Medici palace (now called the Palazzo Madama). There <b>she</b> <b>watched</b> <b>the</b> leading artists and architects of the day at work in the city.

500|$|Following his death, Watts' mother {{moved the}} family to Llanfawr Farm in Llangefni and Llanfairpwllgwyngyll, towns {{on the island of}} Anglesey in North Wales, where they lived with Watts' {{maternal}} grandparents, Nikki and Hugh Roberts, for three years. During this time, Watts attended a Welsh language school, Ysgol Gyfun Llangefni. She later said of her time in Wales: [...] "We took Welsh lessons in a school {{in the middle of nowhere}} while everyone else was taking English. Wherever we moved, I would adapt and pick up the regional accent. It's obviously significant now, me being an actress. Anyway, there was quite a lot of sadness in my childhood, but no lack of love." [...] In 1978, her mother remarried (though she would later be divorced again) and Watts and her brother then moved to Suffolk, where she attended Thomas Mills High School. Watts has stated that she wanted to become an actress after seeing her mother performing on stage and from the time <b>she</b> <b>watched</b> <b>the</b> 1980 film Fame.|$|E
500|$|Chastain's biggest {{success of}} the year came with the drama The Help, co-starring Viola Davis, Octavia Spencer and Emma Stone, {{which was based on}} Kathryn Stockett's novel of the same name. Chastain played Celia Foote, an {{aspiring}} socialite in 1960s Jackson, Mississippi, who develops a friendship with her black maid (played by Spencer). Chastain was drawn to her character's anti-racist stand and connected with her energy and enthusiasm; in preparation, <b>she</b> <b>watched</b> <b>the</b> films of Marilyn Monroe and researched the history of Sugar Ditch, Tennessee, where her character was raised. The Help earned $216 million at the box office to become Chastain's most widely seen film to that point. Manohla Dargis of The New York Times praised the chemistry between Chastain and Spencer and Roger Ebert commended her for being [...] "unaffected and infectious". The ensemble of The Help won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Cast and Chastain received her first Oscar nomination in the Best Supporting Actress category, in addition to BAFTA, Golden Globe and SAG nominations in the same category, all of which she lost to Spencer.|$|E
500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning {{wrote that}} [...] "Corporate Crush" [...] was a [...] "solid episode", and that 30 Rock seemed [...] "to have hit its storytelling stride". He added that [...] "as we near the season finale, we're {{happy to see}} that 30 Rock has begun their drive towards a big finish." [...] Canning rated this episode an 8 out of 10. TV Guides Matt Webb Mitovich opined that [...] "though the 'My guy friend is dating my boyfriend' gag {{has been done to}} death on TV sitcoms, 30 Rock is to be forgiven if only because the same episode gave us a preview of, no, not The Real Wedding Crashers , but Jefferson, starring... Tracy Jordan." [...] Julia Ward of TV Squad awarded this episode with 5 out of 7, and said that Jenna Maroney's (Jane Krakowski) absence was upside to the episode, explaining, [...] "I actually like Jane Krakowski, but I can't say that I've missed her". Regarding Jack and Liz's relationship in the episode, Ward thought it was an [...] "uneasy mutual respect thing", which she thought let [...] "Alec Baldwin exercise his thespian prowess". However, Ward said that she did not watch 30 Rock for the continuing storylines, rather, <b>she</b> <b>watched</b> <b>the</b> series for the [...] "wacky".|$|E

500|$|Strong {{explained}} in Desperate Housewives: Behind Closed Doors {{that she believed}} {{there to be a}} [...] "conceptual shift" [...] after the filming of the original pilot with Lee, and [...] "they realized they needed something different", stating: [...] "There certainly wasn't something wrong with what [...] did. It was just that instead of vanilla they wanted chocolate, and I happened to be chocolate. When I walked in to audition, Marc Cherry was so sweet. He said, 'I hope you don't mind, but I'm going to close my eyes, because I really want to hear how you sound.' When I was done with the audition, {{he opened his eyes and}} this angelic smile crept across his face, and I thought, 'Oh, good. Something went right.'" [...] The actress also explained that <b>she</b> <b>watched</b> <b>the</b> pilot filmed with Lee and while that was helpful for her own portrayal, she saw that what she had to offer for the role was different, saying: [...] "It's a little strange when you watch someone else in a role you're auditioning for because his or her performance lives in your mind. It can be hard to distinguish yourself sometimes, but I had fun with it." [...] Scenes featuring Lee were refilmed with Strong as her replacement. Strong stated years later that her role and narration as Mary Alice led to her voice becoming significantly recognizable, explaining in a 2012 interview with Entertainment Weekly that fans of the series would recognize her in coffee shops solely by her voice. The actress served as the narrator of almost every episode of the series, with the exceptions of the third season episode [...] "My Husband, the Pig" [...] (in which Steven Culp narrates the episode as the deceased Rex Van de Kamp) and the fifth season episode [...] "Look Into Their Eyes and You See What They Know" [...] (in which Nicollette Sheridan narrates the episode as the deceased Edie Britt).|$|E
