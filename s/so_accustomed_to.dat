5|$|Bean {{starred in}} the espionage {{television}} series Legends as Martin Odum, an FBI agent who takes on various fabricated identities to go undercover. The show was cancelled after its second season. An intensive viral marketing campaign was centred on the hashtag #DontKillSeanBean, focusing on the various deaths of his past characters and promising his character in Legends would not suffer the same fate. The campaign culminated with a Funny or Die exclusive video featuring Bean filming a scene for the show where he's become <b>so</b> <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> dying on screen that he expects his character to die a bizarrely gruesome death despite {{the simplicity of the}} scene.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} {{the nineteenth}} century, there was no single {{currency}} in use in Macau, but the predominant circulating coins were the silver Mexican dollars, the British silver trade dollars of Hong Kong and the Straits Settlements, as well as the silver dollars and fractional coinage of the neighbouring province of Canton. In 1901, it was decided to have a uniquely Macau currency, and for that purpose, the Banco Nacional Ultramarino was granted exclusive rights to issue legal tender banknotes that were to be denominated in patacas. On January 27, 1906, pataca notes in denominations of 1, 5, 50 and 100 were introduced and all foreign coinage was outlawed, the idea being to make the pataca paper notes the sole legal tender currency in Macau. However, the Chinese, being <b>so</b> <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> using silver for barter, were suspicious of this new paper money, and as such, the paper pataca always circulated at a discount in relation to the silver dollar coins. On the contrary, a similar action at exactly the same time in the Straits Settlements, and for the same purpose, had the different effect of putting the new Straits dollar into the gold exchange standard. Hence both the Macau pataca and the Straits dollar were launched at a sterling value of 2 shillings and 4 pence, but where the Straits dollar remained at that value until the 1960s, the Macau pataca fluctuated with the value of silver, just like the Hong Kong unit.|$|E
500|$|During the Dublin sessions, Eno {{was sent}} tapes of the {{previous}} two months' work, which he called a [...] "total disaster". Joining U2 in the studio, he stripped away what he thought to be excessive overdubbing. The group believes his intervention saved the album. Eno theorised that the band {{was too close to}} their music, explaining, [...] "if you know a piece of music terribly well and the mix changes and the bass guitar goes very quiet, you still hear the bass. You're <b>so</b> <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> it being there that you compensate and remake it in your mind." [...] Eno also assisted them through a crisis point one month before the recording deadline; he recalled that [...] "everything seemed like a mess", and he insisted the band take a two-week holiday. The break gave them a clearer perspective and added decisiveness.|$|E

500|$|IGN's Chris Carabott {{said that}} [...] "now that Lost has finally wrapped {{up most of}} the loose ends from season two, the episode can shift focus to this season's mysteries." [...] He also felt the episode [...] "offers a healthy mix of plot and {{character}} development with a fair share of revelations thrown in for good measure." [...] Christine Fenno of Entertainment Weekly declared herself [...] "sold on the adrenaline-rush direction the show has taken", with praise to the flashbacks and the cliffhanger involving the reveal of the second island. Lost critic Andrew Dignan described [...] "Every Man for Himself" [...] as [...] "quite the exhilarating episode, packing in enough thrills to make the 42-minutes fly by" [...] in Slant Magazine. Ryan Mcgee of Zap2it considered [...] "watching the con man get conned was brutally satisfying", saying that Sawyer [...] " [...] the whole gamut of emotions", and felt Colleen's death and the reveal of Ben's tumor [...] "were good things, as people were already impatient by the glacial-like pace of Season3." [...] Writing for AOL TV, Jonathan Toomey considered [...] "Every Man for Himself" [...] as [...] "an interesting episode" [...] which set up many new elements, and while Toomey called the flashback [...] "a little dry and 100% predictable", he liked how it related to the other events in the story [...] "right up to the title". [...] Mac Slocum of Filmfodder.com praised the episode for returning to the mythology, as he considered the previous episode lacked [...] "the slack-jawed wonder I'm <b>so</b> <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> experiencing with this show".|$|E

[...] James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film {{three out of four}} stars, saying that it [...] "isn't for everyone, but it offers {{a breath of fresh air}} to anyone gasping on the fumes of too many traditional Hollywood thrillers." ...|$|E
2500|$|How much of Stein's wartime {{activities}} {{were motivated by}} the real exigencies of self-preservation in a dangerous environment can only be speculated upon. However, her loyalty to Pétain may have gone beyond expedience. She had been urged to leave France by American embassy officials, friends and family when that possibility still existed, but declined to do <b>so.</b> <b>Accustomed</b> <b>to</b> a life of entitlement since birth, Stein may have been convinced her wealth and notoriety would exempt her from what had befallen other European Jews. In an essay written for the Atlantic Monthly in November, 1940, Stein had written about her decision not to leave France: [...] "it would be awfully uncomfortable and I am fussy about my food." [...] Stein continued to praise Pétain after the war ended, this {{at a time when}} Pétain had been sentenced to death by a French court for treason.|$|E

2500|$|However, Poincaré did {{not share}} Kantian views in all {{branches}} of philosophy and mathematics. For example, in geometry, Poincaré believed that the structure of non-Euclidean space can be known analytically. Poincaré held that convention {{plays an important role}} in physics. His view (and some later, more extreme versions of it) came to be known as [...] "conventionalism". Poincaré believed that Newton's first law was not empirical but is a conventional framework assumption for mechanics (Gargani, 2012). He also believed that the geometry of physical space is conventional. He considered examples in which either the geometry of the physical fields or gradients of temperature can be changed, either describing a space as non-Euclidean measured by rigid rulers, or as a Euclidean space where the rulers are expanded or shrunk by a variable heat distribution. However, Poincaré thought that we were <b>so</b> <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> Euclidean geometry that we would prefer to change the physical laws to save Euclidean geometry rather than shift to a non-Euclidean physical geometry.|$|E
2500|$|Murphy was {{succeeded by}} Mike McClennan in February 1990. In his first season, McClennan took St Helens to the 1991 Challenge Cup Final, {{where they were}} {{defeated}} by 13 points to 8 by Wigan. They won the Lancashire Cup, in the 1991–92 season, beating Rochdale Hornets. They also lost the Premiership Final that season, losing to Wigan. In 1993 the club avenged their defeat by Wigan the season previous to win the Premiership, in the same season that they won the Charity Shield, and lost the Lancashire Cup final. McClennan was head coach until December 1993, when Eric Hughes succeeded him as head coach in 1994. Under Hughes, St Helens only reached the one, Regal Trophy Final, where they lost to Wigan in 1996 by 25 to 16. They finished fourth in both of Hughes' seasons in charge. The lack of trophies in the St Helens cabinet, after the club had suddenly become <b>so</b> <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> success, would need {{to change in the}} [...] "new" [...] brand Super League that formed in 1996; hence Hughes' departure in 1996 and replacement with Australian Shaun McRae.|$|E
2500|$|Rocko's design {{changed as}} his {{character}} evolved. The {{first version of}} the character was Travis. Murray said [...] "I liked him, but changed him considerably for Rocko." [...] Murray said that the version placed in the Rocko's Modern Life proposal was [...] "much looser, and closer to my independent film style." [...] Murray did not consider how the character would be animated, as Murray {{did not believe that}} the character would be animated. When the pilot for Rocko's Modern Life was approved, Murray began streamlining the character so that others could easily draw him. Murray said that one could perceive a difference between the character as he appears in the original model sheet used in the original animation versus the character as he appears in the animation produced abroad. Murray continued to streamline Rocko so that overseas studios could easily draw him. Murray and the directors had become <b>so</b> <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> quickdrawing Rocko that the changes in the character, in his words, [...] "naturally occurred, lending more to the happy personality Rocko had developed into ( [...] less the victim, paranoid one from the beginning)." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Macau, {{the unit}} of {{currency}} is the pataca, which is currently pegged to the Hong Kong dollar {{at a rate of}} HK$1= MOP1.03. The name pataca is a Portuguese word which was applied to the Mexican dollars that were the main circulating coin in the wider region {{in the second half of}} the 19th century. In 1894, the pataca was introduced in both Macau and Portuguese Timor as a unit of account for the Mexican dollar and the other silver dollar coins in circulation. However, the pataca was not the official currency when it was first enacted. In 1901, it was decided to grant the Banco Nacional Ultramarino the exclusive rights to issue banknotes denominated in patacas, and in the year 1906, all foreign coins were outlawed. However, the Chinese were suspicious of these paper patacas, being <b>so</b> <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> using silver for barter, and as such, the paper patacas circulated at a discount in relation to the silver dollar coins. In 1935, when China and Hong Kong abandoned the silver standard, the Hong Kong dollar was pegged to sterling at the fixed rate of 1 shilling and 3 pence, whereas the pataca was pegged to the Portuguese escudo at a sterling equivalent rate of only 1 shilling. From 1945 to 1951, fractional coins of the pataca were minted for issue in Portuguese Timor; and, in 1952, similar issues were minted for Macau including an actual pataca coin for the first time.|$|E
2500|$|Marvel {{encouraged}} Daley and Goldstein {{to express}} {{their own sense of}} humor in the script, with Daley saying, [...] "When you’re seeing the world {{through the eyes of a}} fun, funny kid, you can really embrace that voice, and not give him the cookie-cutter one-liners that you’re <b>so</b> <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> hearing from Peter Parker." [...] Inspired by their experiences working on sit-coms, the writers also looked to create [...] "a network of strong characters" [...] to surround Parker with in the film. In October 2015, Watts said he was looking to make the film a coming-of-age story to see the growth of Parker, citing Say Anything..., Almost Famous, and Can't Buy Me Love as some of his favorite films in that genre. It was this aspect of the film that had initially got Watts interested in directing it, as he had already been looking to make a coming-of-age story when he heard that the new Spider-Man would be younger than previous incarnations. Watts re-read the original Spider-Man comics in preparation for the film, and [...] "came to a new realization about why he was so popular originally: He gave a different perspective on this world that they were building. He was introduced in the ‘60s, when they had already built a crazy spectacular Marvel Universe ... to give a regular person’s perspective on it. And that ties in really nicely with what I get to do with this movie, which is" [...] introduce him to the MCU. Specific comics that Watts noted as potential influences were Ultimate Spider-Man and Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane. In December, Oliver Scholl signed on to be the production designer for the film.|$|E
