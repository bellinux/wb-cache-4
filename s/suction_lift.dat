5000|$|A village {{settlement}} was established at Murtho, 2-3 miles km upstream of Renmark (on the opposite bank) in the 1890s as a socialist colony. The Village Settlements established under Part VII of the Crown Lands Amendment Act 1893 was mostly used by unemployed people seeking {{a fresh start}} during an economic depression. Murtho was different in that it required financial commitment by the members and no government handouts. Chairman of the Murtho Co-operative Village Settlement Association was Henry Cordeaux ( [...] -1902). By 1897, Murtho had 60-70 acres under irrigation. However, by 1899, Murtho settlement had, like many others, been largely abandoned. The settlement failed chiefly through inadequate irrigation — the {{settlement was}} atop a 120 feet m cliff. This was initially seen as an advantage, as the land sloped away from the banks, thus easier to irrigate but the double-acting plunger pump required to raise water to this height was expensive, inefficient, and could barely cope with 20 feet m of <b>suction</b> <b>lift</b> during [...] "normal" [...] low river levels, and failed utterly when the river dropped further. The cost of transporting provisions and produce by river was exorbitant (dearer per ton than from London to Adelaide), and rabbits took much of their crop: they bypassed the wire netting fences by scaling the cliffs! [...] Among the Murtho settlers were brothers John Napier Birks (1845-1929) and Walter Richard Birks (1847-1900), of Adelaide's prominent Birks family.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The {{experiment}} {{was about to}} study of water jet pumps with different diameters and nozzle-to-throat area ratios. Most experimental studies on water jet pumps mainly carried out to assess the maximum efficiency. But maximum efficiency occurs when the <b>suction</b> <b>lift</b> is relatively small for a given head loss through the pump, which implies, when the suction flow rate is maximum. However, <b>suction</b> <b>lift</b> is inversely proportional to flow rate. But {{in the field of}} application there are many cases (such as drainage, dredging, well-pumping and other systems) where <b>suction</b> <b>lift</b> is more important factor than any other for water jet pumps, which gives importance to the assessment of depending factor of <b>suction</b> <b>lift</b> of water jet pumps. Six different jet pumps of two different nominal diameter each of three different nozzle to throat area ratio were made to carry out this experiment. The results revealed that the nozzle-to-throat area ratio was an important parameter to characterize the <b>suction</b> <b>lift</b> of the jet pumps, but nominal diameter had a negligible play role...|$|E

50|$|<b>Suction</b> and <b>lift</b> are {{important}} considerations when pumping fluids. Suction is the vertical {{distance between the}} fluid to be pumped and {{the centre of the}} pump, while lift is the vertical distance between the pump and the delivery point. The depth from which a hand pump will suck is limited by atmospheric pressure to an operating depth of less than 7 meters. The height to which a hand pump will lift is governed by the ability of the pump and the operator to lift the weight in the delivery pipe. Thus the same pump and operator will be able to achieve a greater lift with a smaller diameter pipe than they could with a larger diameter pipe.|$|R

It is a non-invasive procedure and may be performed in-office by a trained skin care professional.

40|$|Prior to the {{detailed}} design of components, turbomachinery engineers must guide a mean-line or throughflow design towards an optimum configuration. This process requires {{a combination of}} informed judgement and low-order correlations for the principle sources of loss. With these requirements in mind, this paper examines the impact of key design parameters on endwall loss in turbines, a problem which remains poorly understood. The paper presents a parametric study of linear cascades, which represent a simplified model of real-engine flow. The designs are nominally representative of the Low Pressure Turbine blades of an aero engine, with varying flow angles, blade thickness and <b>suction</b> surface <b>lift</b> styles. RANS calculations are performed for a single aspect ratio and constant inlet boundary layer thickness. The paper first examines the two-dimensional design space before studying endwall losses in detail. It is demonstrated that endwall loss can be decomposed into two components: one due to the dissipation associated with the endwall boundary layer; and another induced by the secondary flows. This secondary-flow-induced loss is found to scale {{with a measure of}} streamwise vorticity predicted by classical secondary flow theory. Rolls-Royce pl...|$|R

The preliminary test results obtained using grains show that the efficiency of a conventional hammer mill and its ability to produce an output of specific size of 400 �m- 600 �m for both maize and cowpeas is low when compared with the output of the new hammer mill. The new hammer mill, which is a partially closed system while in operation and utilizes suction power, virtually eliminates environmental pollution usually associated with the operation of conventional hammer mills and can be used to mill commonly occurring Nigerian grains like millet, sorghum, maize, cowpeas, guinea-corn and soya beans into flour and also for pulverizing locally occurring solid minerals like clays into powder.

40|$|The factors {{affecting}} {{the formation of}} air-entraining vortices in sumps are enumerated, and their relative importance assessed from experiments {{with a number of}} different sumps. It is established that vortices are caused by rotation of the mass of water within the sump arising primarily from the entry conditions. Their severity, measured in terms of the minimum safe submergence to avoid air entrainment was also found to depend greatly on the velocity in the suction inlet; air entrainment rarely occurred below a velocity of 2 ft. per sec., and above 15 or 20 ft. per sec. the severity of the vortices did not increase substantially. The shape and disposition of the suction inlet only slightly affected the vortices, but sump boundaries were found to reduce appreciably the tendency for vortex formation when closer than 8 diameters to the suction pipe: with the walls very close to the pipe, vortices did not occur. Small sumps may thus be more satisfactory than spacious ones. Tests with scale models of existing or proposed pump installations are described, and for one sump, where vortices formed within the working range, it is demonstrated that suitably placed boundary walls would be considerably more effective in preventing vortices than modifications to the suction inlets. Measurements of the quantity of air drawn into the pump through a vortex showed that air entrainment of this type could seriously impair pump performance. Severe vortices could lead to depriming of pumps operating with <b>suction</b> <b>lift...</b>|$|E

Sidewall BLC is required to maintain spanwise two-dimensionality of the flow over the airfoil at large angles of attack. A supercritical-type high-lift air-foil, equipped with a double-slotted flap and a leading-edge slat, was used for the study which was conducted at a Mach number of 0. 2 and Reynolds numbers based on chord of 9 and 16 million.

A polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) peristaltic micropump was designed, fabricated, and characterized, for intended use within rodent brain direct-sampling neuroscience experiments, with capillary electrophoresis - laser-induced fluorescence (CE-LIF) chemical analysis. The micropump was fabricated in-part using replica molding (REM) and injection molding. The micropump channel {{was formed by}} bonding an open PDMS Gaussianshaped micromolded channel, to a featureless slab of PDMS. Two pieces of capillary tube interconnects were sealed within the closed-off microchannel, and used to make connections with the outside world. The micropump was actuated using piezoelectric cantilevers, with a precision machined microvalve attached {{to the tip of}} each cantilever actuator. Registration of the cantilevers and microvalves over the PDMS microchannel, was accomplished with the aid of in-house machined micropositioners. The micropump was thoroughly characterized, for use and application as a bio-analytical add-on attachment device, to an already existing CE-LIF instrument. The micropump was characterized for: various microchannel geometries; different microvalve sizes, tilt, positioning, and shutoff performance; micropositioner design and performance; and, flow rate, backpressure, and peristaltic signal analysis. A P-Q (or H-Q) plot was formed, to represent the performance of the micropump for maximum attainable backpressure (P), versus flow rate (Q). The linear plot was formed by experimentally collecting fourteen individual data points, each corresponding to a unique micropump, “state. ” The P-Q plot as discussed within Chapter VIII, is very potent, in providing a 5 -for- 1 benefit ratio. The P-Q plot allows an experimentalist to obtain: 1) a means to understand how the micropump output performance for both flow rate and backpressure, can be optimized for any particular microfluidic application, 2) an experimentally characterized micropump performance curve/s, 3) an experimentally characterized system curve, 4) the maximum power output of the micropump, and 5) a means to acquire a quantitative measure of the <b>suction</b> <b>lift</b> requirements associated with rodent brain direct-sampling neuroscience experiments.

40|$|Due to the {{unavailability}} of electricity, about 85 % {{of groundwater}} irrigation in eastern India employs fuel-powered surface pumps, which can have system efficiencies {{as low as}} 5 %. As fuel prices continue to rise, impoverished smallholder farmers cannot afford the operation costs of their systems and, as a result, irrigate less land. This research aimed to develop a more efficient off-grid system that eliminates suction head while continuing to utilize a fuel engine on the surface. Design requirements included increased discharge, increased efficiency, portability, maintainability, availability of replacement parts, and affordability. Flow rates and efficiencies of Indian pumps at varying pressure heads were tested to establish baseline performance and test the hypothesis that removing <b>suction</b> <b>lift</b> reduces operation costs. It was found that eliminating suction head can decrease operation costs up to 44 % for the farmers. Fuel-driven system options investigated include flexible shafts and telescoping shafts to transmit power from a surface engine to a submersible pump, fluid machinery such as semi-open hydraulic systems, jet pumps, compressed air motors, and air lifts, and off-grid electricity generation employing a household backup generator or automotive alternator. However, none of these alternatives met all the design requirements. Instead, a hybrid motorized-manual rope pump was prototyped and tested on a well in Ruitola, Jharkhand. Although this system does not meet all the design requirements, it has {{the added benefit of}} providing domestic water supply. The prototype discharged an average of 155. 4 L/min in motorized mode and 17. 2 L/min for men and 13. 3 L/min for women in manual mode. The rope pump received positive feedback from the users and thus could be taken forward with several modifications to improve performance. To increase the available water resources, evaporation reduction strategies to limit water loss from farm tanks were explored. The strategies employed waste materials and included covering a water surface with waste PET bottles and floats comprised of PET waste bottles and old saris. While waste bottles proved promising in a preliminary test, data in a larger experiment has thus far proved inconclusive and further testing is needed. by Emily Gorbaty. Thesis: S.

40|$|The {{sustainable}} use of Dambos for crop production using a technological package is presented. Dambos which {{are known as}} vleis in South Africa and Zimbabwe, fadamas in West Africa and mbugas in East Africa are identified as potential environments and key-resource areas for alleviating poverty and hunger in arid and semi-arid areas where drought occurrences are characteristic and limit upland crop production. Dambos present themselves as environments with soil moisture potential and high water tables ranging from 50 - 100 cm below the ground surface for most part of the year. Particular difficulties arise in abstracting this water for use to irrigate crops in Dambos. Most small-scale farmers use a rope and a bucket to draw water from hand dug wells. These methods are labour intensive and thus limited lands are cultivated by small-scale farmers. This study has identified, modified and introduced a treadle pump as a technology for lifting water from shallow water tables such as in Dambos. The treadle pump also lifts water from rivers, swamps, wells and dams within a <b>suction</b> <b>lift</b> of 0 - 8 m to the intended place of use i. e. vegetable garden, domestic application, livestock watering and in construction. The study has further investigated and introduced the clay pot as a water saving device. The clay pot sub-surface irrigation technology saves between 50 and 70 % of water as compared to conventional watering can and bucket systems. This technology can combine well with the treadle pump by using the latter to refill water in the former, thus {{making it easy to}} fill the system once the water is depleted. The use of the treadle pump has demonstrated its impact on the society in many ways. Firstly: the small-scale farmer is now able to increase the size of his/her garden from 0. 1 ha irrigating using watering cans/buckets to between 0. 25 ha and 0. 5 ha using the treadle pump. With this innovative way of irrigating, farmers have thus been able to diversify cropping. Secondly: farmers have been able to increase household income from a meager US$ 125 without a treadle pump to US$ 850 and US$ 1700 on a 0. 25 ha piece of land with a treadle pump on a 300 % cropping intensity (growing crops three times a year). This has helped the country reduce on imported vegetables and thus save the much needed foreign exchange. Thirdly: the technology has contributed to employment creation, notably from the manufacturing point of view where artisans are employed to make the pump and carpenters to make the wooden parts. On the output side for buyers (merchants/hawkers) and transport contractors who trade and transport the produce. The study essentially alludes to the great impact the treadle pump has made by noting the brand naming of the pump as 'Chova pump' by the small-scale farmers. Chova is a local name, which means to boost one's income or to pedal signifying {{the manner in which the}} pump is operated. Dambos, cover about 3. 6 million hectares of land in Zambia and are suitable environments for application of the treadle pump. The potentials and limitations of Dambos are highlighted and the impact of their use using treadle pumps elucidated. Marketing of Dambo produce is discussed with respect to the adoption of the technology. The study notes that Dambos are highly accessible with no land tenure limitations. Thus the more than 800, 000 small-scale farmers in Zambia have an opportunity to utilize Dambos for crop production and help reduce poverty and food insecurity at household level.

40|$|The flow at low Reynolds number around {{rectangular}} cylinders {{of varying}} chord-to-thickness ratios under transverse periodic forcing is studied numerically. Although of relatively low amplitude, the forcing locks the shedding {{from both the}} {{leading and trailing edges}} to the applied frequency. The base <b>suction,</b> and the <b>lift</b> and the drag on the cylinders are found to be complex functions of the forcing frequency. At low Reynolds numbers and without applied forcing, the flow is controlled by a global instability with the leading- and trailing-edge shedding locked; moreover, the reduced frequency of shedding varies in a stepwise manner with the chord-to-thickness ratio. This global instability is still evident in the flows under external forcing examined in this paper. While previous researchers have conjectured that the trailing-edge shedding plays a dominant role in the preferred frequency selection in the natural shedding case, the important role of trailing-edge shedding when the flow is forced is confirmed in the present study. In particular, the individual contributions from leading- and trailing-edge vortices on the perturbation to the leading-edge shear layer are examined. In addition, it is shown that the base suction is maximum when the forcing frequency is close to the global instability frequency observed in unforced flows, thereby strengthening the argument that the unforced, forced, and duct resonant cases are strongly influenced by the same global instability. The variations of the lift, drag and formation length with chord-to-thickness ratio are quantified. 1...|$|R
40|$|Wingtip vortices, {{created as}} a {{byproduct}} of lift, are both a hazard and a significant limiting factor in the increase of air traffic. In order to reduce separation distances between airplanes and increase safety, active flow control solutions are considered, however, more research is required {{to better understand the}} behavior of wingtip vortices. Therefore, this research focuses on the modification of the flow structure downstream using pulsed jets, visualization of the behavior of wingtip vortices using two dimensional particle image velocimetry, as well as measurements of the forces and moments affected by the pulsed jets using an aerodynamic balance. A NACA 0012 wing model equipped with two slots was mounted in a wind tunnel at approximately 150, 000 Reynolds number. A valve system was designed to create jets of air at the wing tip in a steady or pulsed pattern from a slot placed either on the pressure side or the suction side. Particle image velocimetry measurements were taken at various distances downstream, and post-processed for the characterization of the vortex : position, angle, distance, vorticity contour, and circulation. Results indicate that the vortex can be forced into a cyclic pattern constrained between the baseline (no jet) vortex core position, and the position when the jet is permanently activated (steady blowing cases). Depending on the slot used, the vortex trajectory can be forced into an inclination angle. Steady blowing cases show near-sinusoidal oscillations, while pulsed blowing cases exhibit a steady rise in angle, with a slight oscillating pattern in displacement distance values. The circulation values are significantly changed, with a significantly higher dispersion than for the baseline case. Furthermore, the vortex core size is consistently larger as it is displaced away from the baseline case. Additionally, lift, drag and pitching moment were measured in a wind tunnel using an aerodynamic balance. Results showed that lift/drag coefficients consistent with published results, and that activating the jets on the pressure or <b>suction</b> side decreased <b>lift.</b> As instability grows, the destruction of the wingtip vortices occurs past the maximum downstream distance studied, therefore, additional PIV measurements should be taken further downstream. Moreover, supplementary PIV measurements at the slot themselves should be considered to better understand how the perturbed flow structure interacts with the pulsed jets...|$|R
50|$|Even though {{years of}} {{experience}} accounts for a good gauge for the appropriate lifting anchor to be used, {{it should not be}} left to the reinforcement fabricators and precast factory personnel to select the lifting anchor. The design engineer should specifically account for the applied loads expected during the lifting, transport and placement (or re-usability requirements) of the element. Flexure, casting bed suction, load direction (axial ‘tensile’, angular ‘sling’, transverse ‘shear’) are also load considerations to be accounted for in the lifting design of the element.The anchor selection, together with additional reinforcement, and rigging arrangements is influenced by:- The dead weight of the element- The number of anchors in the element and the configuration of the anchor- Capacity of the anchor at the specific concrete compressive strengths at time of lift- The dynamic loads applied during <b>lifting</b> (<b>suction</b> to the casting bed, or crane dynamics)- The rigging configurationAll of the above factors must be taken into consideration during the lifting design phase of the element.The weight of the element can be determined by the calculated volume, and using the specific gravity (normal weight reinforced concrete is approximately 24 kN/m3).Establishing the lifting anchor positions will influence the rigging arrangements used and therefore the static analysis of the rigging should be determined. Particular rigging configurations may be more suitable for particular job sites or lifting in place considerations, and the lifting design should denote the assumptions accordingly. For example, the statically determined systems, shown in Figure 3, where the determination of the loads is not always possible.Dynamic loads considered in lifting design are accounted for in two stages; suction to the casting bed on the initial lift and then the dynamic loads induced from crane vibration. These crane impact loads must be accounted for during transportation in the yard and on-site, and the coefficient increases from an overhead gantry crane through to a crane moving over rough terrain. Consideration for the entire transportation loads {{must be taken into account}} during the lifting design.Anchor capacity, or load resistance, should be considered for tensile loads (axial), sling angle (angular) and shear loads (transverse). Consideration of different load combinations may result in wide variations required from the lifting insert. The load directions during production, transport and placement should be considered carefully. Depending on the planned load direction, either a different anchor may be included in the lifting design, alternatively, reinforcement may be included to reduce the possibility of element flexure crack damage. The configuration (size, position and quantity) of this reinforcement should be supplemented to the element reinforcement design to ensure for adequate capacity of the lifting design.Lifting design is influenced by the steel / concrete interaction of the specific anchor selected. Different load cases are considered by the lifting design engineer, such as anchor susceptibility to edge distance, placement sensitivity, and anchor capacity at the specific concrete strength at time of lift. For example, a footed pin head style anchor maybe more susceptible to edge distance than a hairpin style anchor. Or a splayed anchor does not have the same tensile/axial capacity with the equivalent anchor length (effective embedment is greater on a footed anchor than a splayed anchor of equivalent overall length, see figure 4).|$|R
