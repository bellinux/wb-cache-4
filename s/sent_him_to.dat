5|$|Biographer Weissweiler {{does not}} dismiss the {{possibility}} that Busch's increasing alcohol dependence hindered self-criticism. He refused invitations to parties, and publisher Otto Basserman <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> Wiedensahl to keep his alcohol problem undetected from those around him. Busch was also a heavy smoker, resulting in symptoms of severe nicotine poisoning in 1874. He began to illustrate drunkards more often.|$|E

5|$|Julius Delius {{assumed that}} his son would {{play a part in}} the family wool business, and {{for the next three years}} he tried hard to persuade him to do so. Delius's first job was as the firm's {{representative}} in Stroud in Gloucestershire, where he did moderately well. After being sent in a similar capacity to Chemnitz, he neglected his duties in favour of trips to the major musical centres of Germany, and musical studies with Hans Sitt. His father <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> Sweden, where he again put his artistic interests ahead of commerce, coming under the influence of the Norwegian dramatists Henrik Ibsen and Gunnar Heiberg. Ibsen's denunciations of social conventions further alienated Delius from his commercial background. Delius was then sent to represent the firm in France, but he frequently absented himself from business for excursions to the French Riviera. After this, Julius Delius recognised that there was no prospect {{that his son}} would succeed in the family business, but he remained opposed to music as a profession, and instead <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> America to manage an orange plantation.|$|E

5|$|A {{week after}} Reed's return from Baku, {{he began to}} {{experience}} dizziness and headaches, thought at first to be symptoms of influenza. Five days later, when he became delirious, doctors diagnosed typhus and <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> the hospital. There, with Bryant by his side, he died on October 17, 1920, a few days shy of his 33rd birthday.

Although interested in studying journalism, he did not pursue it as a profession.|$|E
5|$|After this feat {{that earned}} him fame and glory, in 1262 Alexios was {{appointed}} again to lead an army against Epirus.
