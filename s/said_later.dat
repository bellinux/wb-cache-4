5|$|She {{moved to}} Los Angeles and quickly secured {{a role in}} Dawson's Creek. Williams <b>said</b> <b>later</b> that she thought she knew all she needed to know since age15. She said in 2011 that she chose {{emancipation}} as she was influenced by other young actors doing it. In 1997, unhappy with the roles they were being offered, Williams and several actor friends wrote a script entitled Blink. It was sold, but nothing happened with it.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1942 Cardus {{rented a}} small flat in the Kings Cross {{district}} of Sydney, where {{he wrote his}} Ten Composers (1945) and Autobiography (1947). He <b>said</b> <b>later</b> that he found the discipline of writing for seven hours a day difficult at first, but that the process had turned him from a journalist into something more substantial. When later in 1942 his wife announced her intention of sailing from England to join him, Cardus declined {{to move to a}} larger flat to accommodate them both, and rented a separate establishment for her a mile away. They dined together once a week, but otherwise continued to lead largely separate lives.|$|E
5|$|In its engagements {{during the}} Perimeter battle, the KPA 13th Division, with 9,500 men, had forced South Korean troops into the Tabu-dong {{corridor}} and started advancing on Taegu. This division had battled the ROK 11th and 12th Regiments in the Yuhak-san {{area for a}} week before it broke through to the corridor on August 17. A regimental commander of the division <b>said</b> <b>later</b> it suffered 1,500 casualties in the process. On August 18, the 13th Division was concentrated mostly west of the road just north of Tabu-dong.|$|E

"This town {{is full of}} right-wingers—the {{world is}} full of right-wingers—intolerant, cruel sons-of-bitches," [...] <b>said</b> Kirk <b>later.</b> But he <b>later</b> <b>said</b> that he [...] "richly {{deserved}} to be fired from the studios because of my irresponsibility. A person on drugs is not fit for work." ...|$|R

5|$|Vrba's {{marriage}} ended {{around this}} time. In 1958 {{he received an}} invitation to an international conference in Israel, and while there he defected. He worked {{for the next two}} years at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot. He <b>said</b> <b>later</b> that he could not continue to live in Israel because the same men who had, in his view, betrayed the Jewish community in Hungary were now in positions of power there. In 1960 he moved instead to England, where he worked for two years in the Neuropsychiatric Research Unit in Carshalton, Surrey, and seven years for the Medical Research Council. He became a British subject by naturalization on 4 August 1966.|$|E
5|$|The crisis flared again {{two years}} later when the Canadian {{military}} called for overseas reinforcements. Ralston wanted King to impose conscription, but at Macdonald's urging, seemed willing to compromise by going along with the prime minister's plan for one last voluntary recruitment campaign. King however, suddenly dismissed Ralston during a cabinet meeting on November 1, 1944. Macdonald considered resigning, but <b>said</b> <b>later</b> he would have struck King if he had risen to leave. Instead {{he sat in his}} chair ripping sheets of notepaper into small shreds and dropping them on the floor. Stephen Henderson writes that Macdonald's decision not to resign probably saved the King government. King himself seemed to recognize that if Macdonald had left, Ilsley would have resigned too, possibly taking other ministers with him and causing the government's collapse.|$|E
5|$|This too {{was intercepted}} and photographed but, {{as it was}} a {{relatively}} harmless letter, it was forwarded on while the British authorities continued to monitor Lody's communications in the hope of finding out more about the German espionage network. The day after sending it, on 15 September, Lody travelled to London to reconnoitre the city's war preparations. Travelling light, he stayed for two nights at the Ivanhoe Hotel in Bloomsbury (now the Bloomsbury Street Hotel) and set to work finding information about the security measures at public buildings. He <b>said</b> <b>later</b> that he had not actually observed the buildings himself but had obtained cuttings from newspapers, which he intended to send to Berlin. He also wrote a report on 16 September, but claimed that he had never sent it– it was never found by the British– as he felt that it was poorly written.|$|E
5000|$|The {{phenomenon}} {{was noted}} by the Romans themselves: In many words in which the ancients <b>said</b> s, they <b>later</b> <b>said</b> r... foedesum foederum, plusima plurima, meliosem meliorem, asenam arenam Varro, De lingua Latina, VII, 26 ...|$|R

5|$|Following {{news of his}} father's {{premature}} death in 1864, Riel lost interest in the priesthood and he withdrew from the college in March 1865. For a time he continued his studies as a day student in the convent of the Grey Nuns, but was soon asked to leave following breaches of discipline. He remained in Montreal over a year, living {{at the home of}} his aunt, Lucie Riel. Impoverished by the death of his father, Riel took employment as a law clerk in the Montreal office of Rodolphe Laflamme. During this time he was involved in a failed romance with a young woman named Marie–Julie Guernon. This progressed to the point of Riel having signed a contract of marriage, but his fiancée's family opposed her involvement with a Métis, and the engagement was soon broken. Compounding this disappointment, Riel found legal work unpleasant, and by early 1866 he had resolved to leave Canada East. Some of his friends <b>said</b> <b>later</b> that he worked odd jobs in Chicago, Illinois, while staying with poet Louis-Honoré Fréchette, and wrote poems himself in the manner of Lamartine; also that he was then for a time employed as a clerk in Saint Paul, Minnesota, before returning to the Red River Settlement on 26 July 1868.|$|E
5|$|To {{communicate}} with his handlers, Lody {{was instructed to}} write to certain addresses in Christiania (now Oslo), Stockholm, New York City and Rome. He acquired an American emergency passport {{in the name of}} Charles A.Inglis, a genuine document obtained from the US Embassy in Berlin. When Germany declared war on Russia on 1 August, newly imposed restrictions prevented foreigners from leaving Germany without travel documents. Embassies and consulates throughout the country experienced a rush of visitors as foreigners sought emergency passports; these had to be submitted to the German Foreign Ministry to obtain exit permits for neutral Denmark or the Netherlands. One such applicant was the real Charles A. Inglis, whose passport went missing– lost, it was claimed, although in fact the Foreign Ministry had appropriated it for Lody's use. As the passport lacked security features such as the holder's photograph or fingerprints, being merely a single-sheet document, it was well-suited for use by a spy. Lody <b>said</b> <b>later</b> that he had received it in the post from his superiors atN. He was also given £250 in British banknotes, 1,000 Danish krone and 1,000 Norwegian krone to finance his mission to the UK, where he would travel via Denmark and Norway.|$|E
25|$|This was {{spoken in}} such an {{agitated}} voice that Erjavec was unable {{to understand what was}} being <b>said.</b> (<b>Later,</b> on hearing the recording of this call, Captain Kröse had difficulty in understanding his own words).

25|$|About 150 {{people were}} present. Jean-Baptiste Estrade (a tax inspector), Duffo (a court official), and the {{officers}} from the garrison were present.

25|$|During 1948, Amazing Stories ceased all {{publication}} of Shaver's stories. Palmer would later claim {{the magazine was}} pressured by sinister outside forces to make the change: science fiction fans would credit their boycott and letter-writing campaigns for the change. The magazine's owners <b>said</b> <b>later</b> that the Shaver Mystery had simply run its course and sales were decreasing.|$|E
25|$|Divers {{scoured the}} cave, looking in every small crevice and fissure where Ben might have crawled in a panicked {{attempt to get}} out as his tanks ran low, a pattern found in other cave diving deaths; many <b>said</b> <b>later</b> that they felt they had risked their own lives to do so. But over the ensuing weekend they found no sign of Ben.|$|E

25|$|The SO19 {{firearms}} officers {{involved in}} the shooting were debriefed and drugs and alcohol tests were taken as a standard procedure. The officers were taken off duty pending {{an investigation into the}} shooting. One security agency source <b>said</b> <b>later</b> that members of SO19 received training from the SAS. He said the operation was not typical of the police, and bore the hallmarks of a special forces operation.|$|E
25|$|Rosario's {{phone records}} show {{she was also}} trying to call Edwards around the same time. He did not answer, {{and when he did}} not she tried to call Jordan McCrary, a UNCCH soccer player she knew. At 4:25 a.m., she left the {{apartment}} to get in McCrary's car. At that time, Rosario <b>said</b> <b>later,</b> she believed Hedgepeth was asleep in her room, and left the apartment's door unlocked.|$|E
25|$|Ignoring the haka is {{a tactic}} {{sometimes}} used by opposing teams. Famously, the Australian rugby team did a warm up drill {{well away from}} the All Blacks during their 1996 test match in Wellington. More recently, the Italian rugby team ignored the haka during a 2007 World Cup Pool Match. All Black team member, Keven Mealamu, <b>said</b> <b>later</b> that in his opinion the snub had backfired and provided motivation to his team.|$|E

25|$|Buse was accorded {{a benefit}} match by Somerset {{in his final}} {{first-class}} season, 1953, and picked the three-day County Championship game against Lancashire at Bath. The match was a sensation, though not to Buse's gain. At {{the root of the}} sensation was a newly-laid pitch, which took vicious spin from the start of play. Lancashire's acting captain, the England Test batsman Cyril Washbrook, <b>said</b> <b>later</b> that Lancashire would have refused to play had it not been a benefit match.|$|E
25|$|Ewbank {{moved back}} to Oxford in {{retirement}} and wrote a book in 1977 called Football Greats. He {{was inducted into the}} Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1978, but <b>said</b> <b>later</b> that year that he was glad to be out of coaching. With the expansion of the NFL, he said, talent had become diluted and fielding a good team was difficult. Coaches, meanwhile, customarily took the blame for a team's failures, and the sport had become too violent.|$|E

His final campaign in 1980 was close, with Goldwater winning in a near draw against Democratic challenger Bill Schulz. Goldwater <b>said</b> <b>later</b> that the close result convinced him not to run again.|$|E
