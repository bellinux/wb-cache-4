The revision extended the technology development phase by {{six months to}} give industry more time to refine vehicle designs. Milestone B would occur in 2014, with {{the selection of a}} <b>single</b> <b>vendor</b> for the engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) and production phases of the program. This would initiate critical design and testing activities in anticipation of vehicle production. Budgetary pressures caused the reduction of number of vendors to be selected from two to one.|$|E

2500|$|On 27 August 2013, the Army and Marine Corps {{announced}} that full-scale testing of JLTV prototypes would begin the following week, {{with all three}} vendors having had 66 vehicles delivered. [...] Each company delivered 22 vehicles and six trailers to Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, and Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona. [...] Previous testing had already put the vehicles through more than 400 ballistic and blast tests on armor testing samples, underbody blast testing, and more than 1,000 miles in shakedown testing. [...] Soldiers from the Army Test and Evaluation Command and personnel from the Defense Department's Office of Test and Evaluation would put the vehicles through realistic and rigorous field testing during 14 months of government performance testing. [...] Testing was {{to be completed by}} FY 2015, with a production contract to be awarded to a <b>single</b> <b>vendor</b> for nearly 55,000 vehicles, with each vehicle coming off the assembly line not exceeding $250,000. [...] The Army is to begin receiving JLTVs by FY 2018, and have all their vehicles planned to be delivered in the 2030s. On 3 September 2013, full-pace, full-scope JLTV testing began at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Yuma Proving Ground, and Redstone Arsenal, Alabama. [...] The program is on track despite sequestration, but if budget issues are not worked out the schedule could slip. [...] One vendor will be selected by July 2015, and produce 2,000 vehicles for three years of additional testing to fine-tune the assembly line and full-up the system.|$|E

It avoids the re-use of relevant existing international standards (e.g. several cryptographic algorithms, VML, etc.). There are literally hundreds of technical flaws that should be addressed before standardizing OOXML including continued use of binary code tied to platform specific features, propagating bugs in MS-Office into the standard, proprietary units, references to proprietary/confidential tags, unclear IP and patent rights, and much more".|$|R

Lack of standardization remains a problem with PWRs, as, at least in the United States, there are three design families represented among the current PWR fleet (Combustion Engineering, Westinghouse, and Babcock & Wilcox), within these families, there are quite divergent designs. Still, some countries could reach a high level of standardisation with PWRs, like France.|$|R
