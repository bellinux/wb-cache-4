40|$|Background: Reducing the phytate {{content in}} grains by genetic {{manipulation}} {{is a novel}} approach to increasing nonheme-iron absorption from mixed diets. Fractional iron absorption from a genetically modified strain of low-phytate maize (LPM) increased significantly, by 50 %. Objective: We assessed iron absorption from porridges prepared from the same LPM (lpa- 1 - 1 mutant) and unmodified wild-type maize (WTM), {{both of which were}} fortified with either ferrous sulfate or <b>sodium</b> <b>iron</b> <b>EDTA.</b> Design: Porridges providing 3. 4 mg Fe were fortified with either ferrous sulfate or <b>sodium</b> <b>iron</b> <b>EDTA</b> to provide an additional 1 mg Fe/serving. In 14 nonanemic women, iron absorption was meas-ured as the amount of radioiron incorporated into red blood cells (extrinsic tag method) 12 d after consumption of the study diets. Results: No significant effect of phytate content on iron absorp-tion was found when porridge was fortified with either <b>sodium</b> <b>iron</b> <b>EDTA</b> or ferrous sulfate. Fractional absorption of iron from WTM porridge fortified with <b>sodium</b> <b>iron</b> <b>EDTA</b> (5. 73 %) was 3. 39 times greater than that from the same porridge fortified with ferrous sulfate (1. 69 %). Fractional absorption of iron from the sodium iron EDTA–fortified LPM porridge (5. 40 %) was 2. 82 times greater than that from LPM porridge fortified with ferrous sulfate (1. 91 %) (P < 0. 0001 for both comparisons, repeated-measures analysis of variance). Thus, the previously identified benefit of LPM was no longer detectable when maize porridge was fortified with additional iron. Conclusion: Iron was absorbed more efficiently when the forti-ficant was <b>sodium</b> <b>iron</b> <b>EDTA</b> rather than ferrous sulfate, regard-less of the type of maize.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{performed}} to provide data on the disposition, accumulation and toxicity of <b>sodium</b> <b>iron</b> <b>EDTA</b> in comparison with iron (II) sulfate in rats on administration via the diet for 31 and 61 days. Clinical signs, body weights, food consumption, food conversion efficiency, hematology, clinical chemistry and pathology of selected organs were used as criteria for disclosing possible harmful effects. Determination of iron and total iron binding capacity in blood plasma and non-heme iron analysis in liver, spleen and kidneys {{were used to assess}} the disposition and accumulation of iron originating from <b>sodium</b> <b>iron</b> <b>EDTA</b> or iron (II) sulfate. It was concluded that, under the conditions of the present study, iron is accumulated from the diet in liver, spleen and kidneys in a dose-dependent manner, and iron derived from FeEDTA is taken up and/or accumulated less efficiently in liver and spleen than iron from FeSO 4. Moreover, feeding iron up to 11. 5 and 11. 2 mg/kg body weight/day, derived from FeSO 4 and FeEDTA, respectively, did not result in tissue iron excess nor in any other toxicologically significant effects. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The synthesis FeNaEDTA {{has been identified}} in several methods, infra red spectrophotometry, C. H. N analyzer and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP- OES). NaFeEDTA is the only non-haem source that has good bioavailability as it is relatively independent of flour composition and withstands the inhibitory effects of phytates.

40|$|Micronutrient {{undernutrition}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} common and preventable nutritional problems in the world. Several strategies have been developed to prevent and control micronutrient deficiency; however, the problem still persists. We have developed Nutrigems, a food-based micronutrient delivery vehicle which represents a simple technology to provide critical micronutrients to children using the food service logistics of an on-going school lunch program in developing countries. This thesis work was aimed at establishing the stability of micronutrients in Nutrigems after cooking and accelerated storage. Nutrigems made with corn flour and all purpose wheat flour were evaluated as a potential vehicle to deliver vitamin A (VA, as retinol palmitate), iron and the combination. Two types of iron sources were evaluated: <b>sodium</b> <b>iron</b> (III) ethylenediaminetetraacetate (FEDTA) and ferrous sulfate (FS). Nutrigems and rice were mixed (1 : 100 w/w) and cooked in a conventional rice cooker. Samples were stored at two relative humidities (RH) 33 % and 77 % within two temperatures 23 ??C and 40 ??C. Color, VA content and malondialdehyde-thiobarbituric acid (MDA-TBA) were measured at 0, 7 and 14 days after storage. VA was quantified using reverse phase HPLC with Photodiode Array (PDA) detection. Iron and MDA-TBA were quantified using spectrophotometric methods. After cooking, percent retention respectively were 92, 99 and 68 % for VA, NaFeEDTA and the combination. Vitamin A stability after storage was more affected by temperature than RH. However, this changed in the presence of iron. The source of iron had the greatest effect on vitamin A stability, the level of oxidative rancidity and the final color of Nutrigems. <b>Iron</b> <b>EDTA</b> was chosen as it was the least reactive iron source. The optimal conditions for storage with <b>iron</b> <b>EDTA</b> were low RH conditions, which allowed respective retentions of VA of 87. 7 % and 84. 37 % for Nutrigems formulations containing only VA and the combination of VA with <b>iron</b> <b>EDTA.</b> These studies describe a promising technological alternative for its use in point of consumption, local fortification food programs for delivering critical micronutrients and improving nutritional quality of the meals provided in the School Lunch Program in Honduras or other programs with similar logistics...|$|R

40|$|Iron {{deficiency}} anemia (IDA) is a {{major public}} health problem in sub-Saharan Africa. The efficacy of iron fortification against IDA is uncertain in malaria-endemic settings. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the efficacy of a complementary food (CF) fortified with <b>sodium</b> <b>iron</b> <b>EDTA</b> (NaFeEDTA) plus either ferrous fumarate (FeFum) or ferric pyrophosphate (FePP) to combat IDA in preschool-age children in a highly malaria endemic region. This is a secondary analysis of a nine-month cluster-randomized controlled trial conducted in south-central Côte d'Ivoire. 378 children aged 12 - 36 months were randomly assigned to no food intervention (n = 125; control group), CF fortified with 2 mg NaFeEDTA plus 3. 8 mg FeFum for six days/week (n = 126; FeFum group), and CF fortified with 2 mg NaFeEDTA and 3. 8 mg FePP for six days/week (n = 127; FePP group). The outcome measures were hemoglobin (Hb), plasma ferritin (PF), iron deficiency (PF < 30 μg/L), and anemia (Hb < 11. 0 g/dL). Data were analyzed with random-effect models and PF was adjusted for inflammation. The prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum infection and inflammation during the study were 44 - 66 %, and 57 - 76 %, respectively. There was a significant time by treatment interaction on IDA (p = 0. 028) and a borderline significant time by treatment interaction on iron deficiency with or without anemia (p = 0. 068). IDA prevalence sharply decreased in the FeFum (32. 8 % to 1. 2 %, p < 0. 001) and FePP group (23. 6 % to 3. 4 %, p < 0. 001). However, there was no significant time by treatment interaction on Hb or total anemia. These data indicate that, despite the high endemicity of malaria and elevated inflammation biomarkers (C-reactive protein or α- 1 -acid-glycoprotein), IDA was markedly reduced by provision of iron fortified CF to preschool-age children for 9 months, with no significant differences between a combination of NaFeEDTA with FeFum or NaFeEDTA with FePP. However, there was no overall effect on anemia, suggesting most of the anemia in this setting is not due to ID. This trial is registered at clinicaltrials. gov (NCT 01634945) ...|$|E

Fortification of maize flour significantly affected the mineral contents of the flours.
