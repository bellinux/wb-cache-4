5|$|Initially, diesel {{propulsion}} {{was planned}} for these ships, {{as had been}} used for the three Panzerschiffe. However, {{it was decided to}} use superheated steam propulsion. The main reason was that the required total output for the desired speed was three times that of the Panzerschiffe. In the case of triple-screw ships, this would have meant more than twice the <b>shaft</b> <b>horsepower</b> per shaft of the Panzerschiffe, {{and in the case of}} a quadruple-screw ship, this would have amounted to more than 40,000 horsepower per shaft. This requirement was beyond the diesel technology then available, and devising engines that could meet this demand would take an unforeseeable amount of time. Since high-pressure superheated steam had already proved successful, it was considered the most suitable choice for high power machinery.|$|E
25|$|After {{the ship}} was launched, the QE2 was fitted out with a steam turbine {{propulsion}} system utilising three Foster Wheeler E.S.D II boilers, which provided steam for the two Brown-Pametrada turbines. The turbines were rated with a maximum power output figure of 110,000 <b>shaft</b> <b>horsepower</b> (normally operating at 94,000hp) and were coupled to two six-bladed fixed-pitch propellers.|$|E
25|$|Furness Shipbuilding Co Ltd of Haverton Hill-on-Tees built London Valour in 1956 as an oil tanker. She was {{launched}} on 12 June and completed on 6 December. She was LOF's first steam turbine-driven tanker. She had twin steam turbines producing {{a total of}} 8,200 <b>shaft</b> <b>horsepower</b> between them. They were double reduction-geared onto a single shaft to drive a single screw. The turbines were built by Richardsons Westgarth & Company of Hartlepool, {{which was part of}} the same group as Furness Shipbuilding.|$|E
40|$|Combustion-chamber {{performance}} {{characteristics of a}} Python turbine-propeller engine were determined from investigation of a complete engine over a range of engine speeds and <b>shaft</b> <b>horsepowers</b> at simulated altitudes. Results indicated the effect of engine operating conditions and altitude on combustion efficiency and combustion-chamber total pressure losses. Performance of this vaporizing type combustion chamber was also compared with several atomizing type combustion chambers. Over the range of test conditions investigated, combustion efficiency varied from approximately 0. 95 to 0. 99...|$|R
5000|$|... "F" [...] series engines were {{designed}} for late model pursuit aircraft, and are identified by the compact external spur gear-type reduction gear box. Military models were V-1710-27, -29, -39, -45, -49, -51, -53, -55, -57, -61, -75, -77, -81, -87, -89, -91, -95, -99, -101, -105, -107, -111, -113, -115, -119, producing [...] at 3000 rpm. The V-1710-101, -119 and -121 models has an auxiliary supercharger, some with a liquid-cooled aftercooler. Supercharger gear ratios were: 6.44:1, 7.48:1, 8.10:1, 8.80:1 and 9.60:1 depending on altitude rating. These engines had either a six or twelve weight crankshaft, revised vibration dampeners that combined to allow higher engine speeds, SAE #50 propeller <b>shaft,</b> and higher <b>horsepower</b> ratings. The [...] "E" [...] series and [...] "F" [...] series engines were very similar, the primary difference being the front crankcase cover, which was interchangeable between the two series engines.|$|R
25|$|While {{glowing in}} {{praise for the}} helicopter's {{advances}} over piston-engined helicopters, the Army reports from the service tests of the YH-40 {{found it to be}} underpowered with the production T53-L-1A powerplant producing a maximum continuous 770 <b>shaft</b> <b>horsepower</b> (570 kilowatts). The Army indicated the need for improved follow-on models even as the first UH-1As were being delivered. In response, Bell proposed the UH-1B, equipped with the Lycoming T53-L-5 engine producing 960shp (720kW) and a longer cabin that could accommodate either seven passengers or four stretchers and a medical attendant. Army testing of the UH-1B started in November 1960, with the first production aircraft delivered in March 1961.|$|E
25|$|Salvor is {{the third}} ship of the {{auxiliary}} rescue and salvage class of vessel constructed for the US Navy. The rugged construction of this steel-hulled vessel, combined with her speed and endurance, make Salvor well-suited for rescue and salvage operations throughout the world. The hull below the waterline is ice-strengthened. Her propulsion plant can develop 4200 <b>shaft</b> <b>horsepower</b> with four Caterpillar399 diesel engines coupled in pairs to two shafts. She is fitted with a Controllable Reversible Pitch (CRP) propeller within a Kort nozzle on each shaft. The CRP propeller/Kort nozzle combination produces greater thrust and more maneuverability control than conventional propellers. Salvor is also configured with a bow thruster which provides athwartship thrust for additional control of the bow when the ship's speed is less than five knots (9km/h).|$|E
25|$|The {{rebuilding}} {{and expanding}} of the Finnish icebreaker fleet continued until all Finnish ports could be kept open year-round. In the late 1970s, the first post-war icebreakers were approaching either mid-life update or retirement. As a result, the 25-year-old Voima was extensively rebuilt by Wärtsilä Helsinki Shipyard in 1978–1979 {{at a cost}} of about FIM 86 million, 60% of the price of a new icebreaker of comparable size. In the refit, Voima received new hull plating and additional ice-strengthening, new main engines and a completely new superstructure to accommodate the crew, and her propulsion motors and electrical systems were completely refurbished. After the refit, Voima was practically a new ship with only web frames, bottom plating, forepeak and propellers remaining from the original ship and, at 14,000 <b>shaft</b> <b>horsepower,</b> the third most powerful icebreaker of Finland at the time. She returned to service on 10 October 1979.|$|E
500|$|The {{propulsion}} of the {{two ships}} was provided by Vickers vertical triple expansion engines instead of the steam turbines being used to power most contemporary dreadnoughts.

500|$|In {{common with}} the first eight ships built by Western Pipe & Steel, West Avenal was powered by a single General Electric steam turbine rated at 2,500 <b>shaft</b> <b>horsepower,</b> that drove a single screw propeller, and moved the ship at a [...] pace. These General Electric {{turbines}} proved unreliable {{and most of the}} ships powered by them were either lost or scrapped {{by the end of the}} 1920s. Later vessels of the same type built by WPS for the USSB were powered by much more reliable Joshua Hendy triple expansion steam engines, and had considerably longer service lives.|$|E
500|$|Electricity {{is stored}} in four {{lead-acid}} battery packs, totalling 400 tonnes, assembled by Pacific Marine Batteries, {{a joint venture between}} VARTA of Germany and Pacific Dunlop of Australia. These supply a single Jeumont Schneider DC motor, which provides 7,200 <b>shaft</b> <b>horsepower</b> to a seven-bladed, [...] diameter skewback propeller. The propeller design is classified Top Secret, and must be covered before a Collins-class submarine can be removed from the water for maintenance. Emergency propulsion is provided by a MacTaggart Scott DM 43006 retractable hydraulic motor. The aft control surfaces are mounted on an X-shaped structure, giving the boats the ability to outmanoeuvre most warship and submarine classes.|$|E
500|$|Although {{plans were}} not finalized, the third battlecruiser, [...] "Q", was ordered from Germaniawerft in Kiel on 8 August 1939. One month after, the {{contract}} design was refined. The displacement was increased to [...] (design) and [...] (full-load), while the draft at those two figures was [...] and , respectively. At the waterline, the length {{was set at}} [...] and beam at [...] The main battery {{was the same as}} previously (six /47 caliber guns in dual turrets), while the secondary battery was split between six paired /48 caliber anti-surface guns and paired /65 caliber anti-aircraft guns because German designers {{had not been able to}} develop a satisfactory dual-purpose gun. Light anti-aircraft guns were eight 37mm in four dual mounts and twenty 20mm autocannon in single mounts. Twelve [...] torpedo tubes finished out the armament aboard the ships. Four floatplanes for scouting were planned. At the design displacement, the maximum speed was reduced by half a knot, to this required a top <b>shaft</b> <b>horsepower</b> of 173,600.|$|E
500|$|Design {{work on a}} nuclear-powered {{radar picket}} {{submarine}} (SSRN) began in 1954–1955.

500|$|The {{ship was}} one of the [...] "long-hull" [...] designs of the class, which had begun {{production}} after March 1943. This [...] "long hull" [...] variant involved lengthening the bow above the waterline into a [...] "clipper" [...] form. The increased rake and flare provided deck space for two quadruple [...] mounts; these units also had the flight deck slightly shortened forward to provide better arcs of fire.

However, the U.S. Navy never maintained any institutional distinction between the long-hull and short-hull members of the Essex class, and applied postwar refits and upgrades to both groups equally. The ship was powered by eight 600 psi Babcock & Wilcox boilers, and Westinghouse geared steam turbines that developed 150,000 <b>shaft</b> <b>horsepower</b> that turned four propellers. Like other Essex-class carriers, she had a maximum speed of [...] The ship's cost is estimated at $68,000,000 to $78,000,000.|$|E
500|$|The Mahans' {{propulsion}} plant was considerably improved over {{that of the}} Farraguts. Steam pressure was raised from [...] to [...] in some ships, and superheated steam temperature was raised from [...] to [...] in all ships. Double reduction gearing replaced single reduction gearing, allowing smaller, faster-turning turbines to be used; this saved enough space and weight to allow cruising turbines to be fitted, which greatly improved fuel economy at moderate speeds. Boiler economizers, as in previous ships, further improved fuel economy. The ships' range was extended to [...] at , [...] farther than the Farraguts. Design <b>shaft</b> <b>horsepower</b> was increased from [...] to [...] in the same space and weight as in the Farraguts. The relatively compact power plant contributed to the Mahans' ability to carry 12 torpedo tubes instead of eight with only 150 tons extra displacement. The main turbines were manufactured by General Electric and were impulse-type, also called Curtis turbines. Each main turbine was divided into a high-pressure (HP) and a low-pressure (LP) turbine feeding into a common reduction gear to drive a shaft, {{in a similar manner}} to the machinery illustrated at the following reference. Steam from the boilers was supplied to the HP turbine, which exhausted to the LP turbine, which exhausted to a condenser. The cruising turbines were geared to the HP turbines and could be engaged or disengaged as needed; at low speeds they were operated in series with the HP turbines to improve the efficiency of the overall turbine arrangement, thus improving fuel economy. This general arrangement with double reduction gearing became standard for most subsequent steam-powered surface ships of the US Navy, although not all of these had cruising turbines.|$|E
