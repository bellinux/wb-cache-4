40|$|Protest is one {{political}} strategy by which marginalized groups {{can try to}} effect social change in society. As an ethnic group with a unique historical relationship with the United States government, Hmong former refugees have regularly engaged in protests in response to perceived political threats, political opportunities, or both. Using cataloged English-language newspapers, this study examines the characteristics, forms and collective action frames of 84 Hmong American-led protest events in the United States between 1980 and 2010. The evidence indicates that Hmong American protests emerged in the 1990 s, coinciding with their formation of socioeconomically mobile ethnic communities, and continued to increase in frequency throughout the 2000 s particularly in places with substantial concentrations of Hmong. Although most Hmong protest events involved demonstrations, these events varied greatly {{in terms of their}} targets and issues. During the past 30 - 35 years, Hmong American cycles of protest have produced three master frames: the refugee protection frame, the military <b>service</b> <b>frame,</b> and the civil rights frame. I argue that the military <b>service</b> <b>frame</b> represents one of the most enduring and, to date, most potent collective action frames in Hmong Americans’ modern repertoire of contention. Immigrant groups’ increasingly developed communities and their strategic use of collective action frames could have significant implications for their political incorporation in the United States...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Virtual output queues (VOQs) {{are widely}} used by input-queued (IQ) {{switches}} to eliminate the head-of-line (HOL) blocking phenomena, which limits switching performance. An effective matching scheme must provide high throughput under several admissible traffic patterns and keep implementation complexity low. A variety of matching schemes for IQ switches that deliver high throughput under uniform traffic have been proposed. However, {{there is a need}} of matching schemes that provide high throughput under several admissible traffic patterns, including those with nonuniform distributions. In this paper, we introduce the captured frame-size concept for matching schemes in IQ switches. We use the captured-frame eligibility concept in a round-robin based scheme, uFORM, and in a random-base scheme, uFPIM, to improve switching performance under nonuniform traffic patterns. The uFPIM scheme is based in the parallel iterative matching (PIM) scheme and shows the throughput improvement achieved with the captured frame concept. The uFORM scheme provides high performance under nonuniform traffic while keeping the high performance that round-robin schemes are known to have under uniform traffic.

The concepts are experience of treatment, responses and relational perspective. The analysis of the empirical material has been carried out with the help of the concepts and earlier research. The method consisted of qualitative, semi-structured interviews with six informants. The aim was to get the informants to talk exhaustive and use their own words. We have divided the informants into two groups, those who are still in treatment and those who have completed treatment. In the analysis we have compared the two groups’ results. Our conclusion is that the informants in the both groups do not differ to any greater extent. The informants experience the Marte meo treatment as positive and they consider the response from the therapist as professional. A key aspect for the clients, to get positive results in the treatment, is the response from the therapist. The informants’ experience of the Marte meo treatment is that it is concrete and the pictures makes a deep impression. The things that separate the groups from each other are predominantly that the informants that have completed their treatment have a deeper understanding of the treatment...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access system’s (WIMAX, IEEE 802. 16) {{broadband}} net-works is {{an attractive}} solution for high-bandwidth wireless access network. In {{the context of a}} wireless broadband access network, the term open real-time access implies the ability of multiple service BS (base station) to share the deployed access network infrastructure to make available to the SSs (subscribe Station). This paper contains brief variable rate control strategies for real-time multimedia VBR (Variable Bit Rate) <b>service</b> <b>frame</b> over IEEE 802. 16 broadband networks. A data rate control mechanism is derived for the case where the downlink channel provides real time polling bandwidth allocation service while keeping the traffic rate parameter constant. The paper shows that common queue scheduling algorithms have some bandwidth allocation fairness problems for real time polling under the WIMAX system (IEEE 802. 16) MAC layer. In other words, the use of a VBR real-time polling service by a WIMAX system results in additional access latency jitter and bandwidth allocation disorder in the transmitted variable data rate of a multimedia stream, during the base station’s regular time interval polling of Subscribe Sta-tion (SSs) for the contention bandwidth request period. However, this scheduling algorithm solves SSs contented bandwidth resource problems, depending on the real-time polling service (rtPS) quality of service function under ranging response non-contention polling period, as the adopted fairness bandwidth allocation max-min algorithm is the only time constraint condition for transmitting real-time multimedia video or VOIP in the 802. 16 wireles...|$|E
40|$|Hough-Goldstein, JudithCerambycidae are a {{large family}} of beetles that have been studied in detail in recent years. They are of {{particular}} interest {{because there are a}} number of species that are important pests of silviculture. Many of these species are not native in the area in which they are considered pests. Therefore recent research has developed synthesized aggregation pheromones that attract a broad range of cerambycid species that can be used in sentinel traps in ports to detect non-native beetles before they can establish so that eradication is possible. These pheromone blends were used in this study to test these lures as possible sentinel traps for non-native cerambycids and to survey the cerambycids of Delaware. Field bioassays were conducted in collaboration with the USDA Forest <b>Service</b> <b>FRAME</b> project (Forest Fragments in Managed Ecosystems). The goal was to determine which species occurred in which forest fragments and predict what forest factors influenced abundance. Traps baited with pheromone blends and host plant volatiles were put out in 24 for sites for 22 weeks from April to September in 2012 and 2013. The catches in these traps were collected once a week. A total of 15, 368 cerambycid beetles in 72 species were captured including one exotic species. The forest factors predicted to influence cerambycid abundance that were measured in each of the sites were tree species, patch size, and tree health. I tested these factors using AIC values from the unmarked package in R. Tree species and patch size were significant factors in determining cerambycid abundance on a species by species basis. Tree stress was not, but the visual cues that were used to determine health may have not been accurate enough to successfully predict cerambycid abundance.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} political participation and political incorporation of Hmong American communities across three states [...] California, Minnesota, and Wisconsin [...] between 1980 and 2012. This study asks two main questions: First, given Hmong Americans' particular contexts of exit and contexts of reception, how {{and to what}} extent have Hmong former refugees and their U. S. -born children been incorporated into the U. S. political system? Second, how do broader political contexts or homeland circumstances shape Hmong American politics and the state's treatment of Hmong in the U. S. and abroad? I address these questions through two historical analyses of Hmong Americans' non-electoral and electoral participation and two detailed case studies of Hmong Americans' social movements. The first historical analysis focuses on Hmong Americans' protest events from 1980 to 2011. Through news media reports and relevant archival materials, I examine 84 Hmong American protests, their contents, and their consequences on public policies and mobilizers' organizational capacity. My findings show that during the past three decades, Hmong Americans' patterns of protest participation are oriented toward both the host society and the homeland. Homeland-oriented protests, rather than declining in frequency, have occurred at a rate almost equal to domestic-oriented protests. The findings also show that Hmong Americans' engagement in protest activities, regardless of domestic or international orientations, has helped them nurture their civic sense and strengthen their organizational capacity. Specifically, protest mobilization has offered ample opportunities for Hmong Americans to develop younger leaders, form new civic organizations, and cultivate a broad alliance system. Protest mobilization has also helped Hmong to refine methods for building collective identity and building collective consensus through the use of common protest symbols such as the uniformed Hmong veteran and master frames such as the military <b>service</b> <b>frame.</b> My second historical analysis focuses on Hmong Americans' electoral participation across three U. S. states [...] California, Minnesota, and Wisconsin [...] between 1990 and 2012. I find evidence that Hmong Americans have achieved greater descriptive representation in Minnesota and Wisconsin compared to California. This difference in the level of descriptive representation appears to be due to differences in state and local political contexts. But a significant relative ethnic population size and the presence of ethnic collective mobilization are common to places with higher levels of descriptive representation. The first extended case study examines two interrelated social movements of the early to late- 1990 s: Hmong Americans' multi-site movements against the benefit ineligibility provisions in the federal Welfare Reform Act of 1996 and their movements in support of the Hmong Veterans' Naturalization Act since 1990. This study reveals that framing plays {{a crucial role in the}} success of protest/social movements. In both the movements against Welfare Reform and for naturalization provisions, `ordinary' Hmong social actors were able to construct and their institutional allies were able to make effective use of a specific collective action frame [...] the military-service frame [...] to bring about benefits and naturalization accommodations in existing state policies specifically for Hmong veterans. I argue that the state's dominant ideology and its foreign policy interests influenced its positive reception of the military-service frame. The second extended case study builds on the first case study to the extent that it examines in detail the contentious, interactive processes of social problem construction that underlie two other Hmong American movements for greater political inclusion. However, this second case differs from the first in that its central focus is on understanding how intra-ethnic conflict affects competing groups' ability to construct social problems and subsequently their ability to make claims upon the state [...] a state that is usually highly suspicious of ethnic movements for political inclusion. Drawing on interviews and primary written sources, I examine a Hmong American-led social movement that sought to incorporate Hmong history into the social science curriculum of California's public schools and the emotionally intense ethnic counter-movement that arose to meet it. My findings suggest that the mass media play crucial roles in creating cultural opportunities for the emergence of certain social problems and in (de) legitimizing such social problems. Although the California State Legislature showed deference to the military <b>service</b> <b>frame</b> and was willing to give token recognition to a broad, informal, quasi-racial category such as Southeast Asians, it trivialized and refused to hear the claims of an ethnolinguistic group regarding institutionally-produced language material inequity. I conclude that the collective mobilization of endogenous and exogenous resources in response to perceived political opportunities has been the key mechanism through which Hmong Americans have been able to participate in the U. S. political system. Hmong Americans' degree of political incorporation is a byproduct of the interplay between Hmong-led mobilization and the responses of the state...|$|E
