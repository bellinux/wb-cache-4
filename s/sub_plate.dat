40|$|Development {{of brain}} is {{fascinating}} {{because of the}} multitude {{and complexity of the}} processes involved in it. It starts with primary neurulation in the third and fourth week of gestation. Primary neurulation refers to formation of the neural tube. This is followed by prosencephalic development {{in the second and third}} months of gestation. Development of prosencephalon is considered best in terms of three sequential events, i. e., prosencephalic formation, prosencephalic cleavage, and midline prosencephalic development. 1 This development is followed by proliferation of the brain’s total complement of neurons. At a microscopic level, the first process to occur is neuronal proliferation and generation of radial glia. This takes place during the first half of gestation. In addition, cortical neurons will move from their sites of origin in the ventricular and subventricular zones to the loci within central nervous system where they will reside the rest of their life and start to differentiate. Neuronal differentiation and organization processes include establishment and differentiation of <b>sub</b> <b>plate</b> neurons, attainment of proper alignment, orientation and layering of cortical neurons, elaboration of dendritic and axonal ramifications, synapse formation, cell death, selective elimination of neuronal processes,synapses, proliferation and differentiation of glia. 1 Organizational events occur in a peak time period from approximately the fifth month of gestation to several years after birth. The glia cells take care of axonal myelination. Myelination occurs especially between the second trimester of gestation and end in the first postnatal year. However, it is first completed around 30 years. 2 Brain development consists of the creation of components and the elimination of elements. Approximately half of the created neurons die (apoptosis), in particular during mid gestation. Similarly, axons and synapses are eliminated, the later especially between 18 months of age and puberty. The shaping of the nervous system by these regressive phenomena is guided by neural chemical processes and neural activity. The neural elements that fit the environment persist, thus allowing for adaptation of the brain to its own environment. 2 This indicates that not only a substantial part of brain development occurs before term age, but alsothat throughout childhood the brain is in a continuous process of remodeling. The presence of continuous neurobiological changes during childhood has major clinical consequences such as age specific vulnerability of the nervous system with age specific signs and symptoms. Due to the age specific differences, it is difficult to predict nervous system development outcome during early infancy. Age specific neurological assessment is required. 2,...|$|E

40|$|Results are {{presented}} for unidirectional (0, 10) (sub s) and (90, 10) (<b>sub</b> s) <b>plates,</b> ((0 / 90) (sub 5) (<b>sub</b> s)) <b>plates,</b> and for aluminum plates. Results are also presented for ((+/- theta) (sub 6) (<b>sub</b> s)) angle-ply <b>plates</b> for values of theta = 30, 45, and 60 degrees. The {{results indicate that}} the change in axial stiffness of a plate at buckling is strongly dependent upon cutout size and plate orthotropy. The presence of a cutout gives rise to an internal load distribution that changes, sometimes dramatically, as a function of cutout size coupled with the plate orthotropy. In the buckled state, the role of orthotropy becomes more significant since bending in addition to membrane orthotropy is present. Most of the plates with cutouts exhibited less postbuckling stiffness than the corresponding plate without a cutout, and the postbuckling stiffness decreased with increasing cutout size. However, some of the highly orthotropic plates with cutouts exhibited more postbuckling stiffness than the corresponding plate without a cutout. These results suggest the possibility of tailoring the cutout size and the stacking sequence of a composite plate to optimize postbuckling stiffness. It was found that plates with large radius cutouts do exhibit some postbuckling strength. The results also indicate that a cutout can influence modal interaction in a plate. Specifically, results {{are presented}} that show a plate with a relatively small cutout buckling at a higher load than the corresponding plate without a cutout, due to modal interaction. Other results are presented that indicate the presence of nonlinear prebuckling deformations, due to material nonlinearity, in the angle-ply plates with theta = 45 and 60 degrees. The nonlinear prebuckling deformations are more pronounced in the plates with theta = 45 degrees and become even more pronounced as the cutout size increases. Results are also presented that show how load-path eccentricity due to improper machining of the test specimens affects the buckling behavior. Some of the plates with cutouts and eccentricity exhibited a snap-through type of buckling behavior...|$|R

Earthquake {{data for the}} period 1900 - 1988 was utilized for the seismicity studies Most earthquakes clustered {{on the edges of}} the Zagros-Tauros subduction zones between the Arabian <b>sub</b> continent <b>Plate</b> and the Iranian and Anatolian Plates; in addition to few intraplate type events on the tectonically stable zone to the west. It was found that 95. 5 % of the events have mb magnitudes range of (4. 0 - 5. 5) and that 75. 5 % of the vents have a focal depth range of (0. 0 - 50. 0) Kms. The (a) and (b) constants of the Gutenberg-Richter recurrence relation gave the values of 6. 85 and 0, 89 respectively, thus reflecting and intermediate seismicity level. Historical data for the period 1260 B. C. 1900 A. D. were utilized for the historical isointensity determinations. A seismic zoning map was constructed showing four damage zones ranging between less than (III) and (VIII) on the MM scale. A seismicity index map was also constructed showing the areas east of Tigris River to depict the highest seismicity index. Seismic sources were also investigated, where five line sources and four area sources were modeled and their locations and parameters determined. Isoacceleration maps were constructed for the studies area for four return periods of 25, 50, 100 and 200 years respectively. The acceleration values tend to increase towards the eastern, northeastern and northern direction. The seismic design parameters were studies and seismic design regionalization map was presented showing a value increase towards the east, northeast and north. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of isolating mechanisms within a species population impedes gene flow. This allows isolated populations to diverge along different trajectories, which may {{ultimately lead to}} the formation of new species. Our attempts to understand the {{evolution of}} isolating barriers have benefited enormously from studies of divergent populations that are still recognized as members of the same species. The co-occurrence of five acoustically distinct populations of the bushcricket Mecopoda elongata in south India provided us with the opportunity to study one such divergence of sympatric populations of a single species. In sympatric populations that share identical ecology, sexual selection has the potential to play a prominent role in the maintenance of reproductive isolation. Based on a previous traditional morphometric study, Mecopoda elongata in India were thought to be a morphologically indistinguishable cryptic species complex. The lack of morphological divergence suggests a less significant role of ecology in the divergence of the group. One possibility is that songtypes may be maintained by the preference of Mecopoda elongate females for mating with a specific songtype. In this thesis I show that female phonotaxis to their ‘own’ call has the potential to contribute to behavioural isolation among the songtypes and in particular between two songtypes with overlapping temporal call parameters. This finding is supported by an independent no-choice mating experiment utilizing the same two songtypes. To investigate the cues other than song that Mecopoda elongata females’ may use to exercise preference for their own type, I examined the composition of cuticular lipids in the cuticle and the detailed structure of secondary sexual characters. I was able to differentiate all Mecopoda elongata songtypes with high probability based on CHC profiles and geometric morphometrics of the <b>sub</b> genital <b>plate</b> and cerci. My study reveals that divergence in sexual traits other than acoustic signals, although dramatically less obvious in nature, is present among Mecopoda elongata populations. This provides potential mechanisms for premating isolation among Mecopoda elongata songtypes in the wild suggesting that reproductive isolation is maintained by female preferences for male sexual signals. Additionally, I discovered a parasitoid Tachinid fly responsible for infecting three different songtypes of Mecopoda elongata, namely Double Chirper, Two Part and Helicopter. This Tachinid fly appears to have specialized hearing organ to track down calling Mecopoda elongata males throwing light on potential selection pressure and possible mechanism for Mecopoda elongata song divergence...|$|R
