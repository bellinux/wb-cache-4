5|$|The 2011 {{declaration}} by Russia that {{it would}} stay in DST all year long was subsequently followed by a similar declaration from Belarus. Russia's plan generated widespread complaints due to the dark of wintertime morning, and thus was abandoned in 2014.

5|$|The Black Hawk War {{gave the}} young captain Abraham Lincoln his brief {{military}} service, although he never {{participated in a}} battle. Other participants who later became famous included Winfield Scott, Zachary Taylor, and Jefferson Davis.

5|$|After being {{dismissed}} as the Redskins' coach, Graham {{returned to the}} Coast Guard Academy as athletic director and {{said he planned to}} <b>stay</b> <b>there</b> until he retired. He coached the college team in the College All-Star Game in 1970 for his tenth and final time. The college stars lost for the seventh time in a row that year, falling 24–3 to the Kansas City Chiefs. He was replaced in 1971 by Blanton Collier, who had retired after succeeding Brown as Cleveland's head coach.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the high}} {{inclination}} of its orbit, Eris only passes through a few constellations of the traditional Zodiac; it {{is now in the}} constellation Cetus. It was in Sculptor from 1876 until 1929 and Phoenix from roughly 1840 until 1875. In 2036 it will enter Pisces and <b>stay</b> <b>there</b> until 2065, when it will enter Aries. It will then move into the northern sky, entering Perseus in 2128 and Camelopardalis (where it will reach its northernmost declination) in 2173.|$|E
5|$|By late 1943, Miller {{was based}} in Gloucestershire. One night, he {{threatened}} to punch his commanding officer, resulting in his being sentenced for insubordination to a three-week disciplinary course with hard labour. In mid-November, he was posted to Ouston near Newcastle-upon-Tyne where he trained in the used of radar.

5|$|Convoys from Britain {{lacked the}} surface vessel escort after 13°W. Hudsons could only make sweeps up to 17°W but lacked {{endurance}} to <b>stay</b> <b>there.</b> From Gibraltar, {{the lack of}} flying boats meant a lack of air cover after 100 miles. Nevertheless, great efforts were made with limited resources to provide cover from first to last light, the time when U-boats could use the rising and setting sun to see the silhouettes on the horizon.|$|E
5|$|Isle Verde, where {{approximately}} 2,300people were killed, {{was declared}} uninhabitable by officials; however, residents still {{returned to the}} area due to a need for land. Eventually, signs that used to warn people not {{to stay on the}} islet were eventually taken down and people were no longer warned not to live there. A resettlement community was constructed months later, with plans to house 912 of the 2,668families that needed to be moved from the area. Those that were not moved were left on Isle Verde despite orders not to <b>stay</b> <b>there.</b> Another resettlement project for 700families was planned at the cost of $1million.|$|E
5|$|Tatsuguchi reached Rabaul on October 4, 1942. His <b>stay</b> <b>there</b> was {{probably}} short, {{for his wife}} recorded that he joined her in Tokyo that same month prior to being redeployed.

5|$|The hunt of {{the pilot}} whale is known by the locals as the Grindadráp. There are no fixed hunting seasons. As soon as a pod close enough to land is spotted, the locals set out to begin the hunt, after {{approval}} from the sysselman. The animals are driven into a bay which is approved for whaling by the Faroese government, and then {{they try to make}} the whales to beach themselves. The only way out is being blocked off by some of the boats, which <b>stay</b> <b>there</b> until men who have been waiting on shore have slaughtered all the whales.|$|E
5|$|While Native hunters did {{not rely}} on dogs, white hunters {{utilized}} them from Colonial times; George Washington is credited with owning {{some of the first}} coon hunting dogs, French hounds given to him by the Marquis de Lafayette. Most of the early coon dogs were actually Foxhounds imported from Europe or mixed breeds with hound blood, but these dogs often had trouble finding raccoons when the latter climbed trees, and breeders began to specifically develop dogs for their treeing ability: the ability to follow the scent to the base of a tree and <b>stay</b> <b>there</b> until the hunter came.|$|E
5|$|With {{the help}} of Chinnamaya, Lambu and Jambu, Ghatotkacha creates a magical town {{consisting}} of an illusory marketplace and palace. He names the town Mayabazar and invites the Kauravas to <b>stay</b> <b>there.</b> Chinnamaya, Lambu and Jamu introduce themselves to the Kauravas as servants appointed by Balarama to look after them. They manage to trick Sarma and Sastry, Shakuni's lackeys. Ghatotkacha (in Sasirekha's form) makes Duryodhana's wife rethink the marriage arrangement and teases Lakshmana Kumara. He plans the wedding of the real Sasirekha and Abhimanyu in his hermitage which is attended by Krishna. Using his divine powers, Krishna also attends as a guest for the marriage {{taking place in the}} Mayabazar.|$|E

5|$|Wright told Lee {{that it was}} {{relatively}} easy {{to get to the}} crest, but it was difficult to <b>stay</b> <b>there.</b> A significant reason Wright could not stay was his lack of support. Two brigades were on Wright's left and could have reinforced his success. Carnot Posey's brigade made slow progress and never crossed the Emmitsburg Road, despite protestations from Wright. William Mahone's brigade inexplicably never moved at all. Gen. Anderson sent a messenger with orders to Mahone to advance, but Mahone refused. Part of the blame for the failure of Wright's assault must lie with Anderson, who took little active part in directing his division in battle.|$|E
5|$|By late 1943, Miller {{has been}} based at RAF South Cerny in Gloucestershire. One night, he was pulled over by his {{commanding}} officer, whom he detested, for not wearing his uniform cap. An altercation resulted, and Miller posed {{as though he were}} about to punch his officer. The result was that Miller was charged with insubordination and sentenced to a three-week disciplinary course with hard labour, from 18 October to 9 November. In mid-November he was posted to Ouston near Newcastle upon Tyne where he was trained in the use of radar using Anson and Oxford aircraft. During his <b>stay</b> <b>there,</b> Miller was thrown on his back during a wrestling match, sustaining an injury that caused him recurring problems in later years, diminishing his ability to bowl.|$|E
5|$|Carr Gomm {{contacted}} {{other institutions}} and hospitals {{more suited to}} caring for chronic cases, but none would accept Merrick. Gomm {{wrote a letter to}} The Times, printed on 4 December, outlining Merrick's case and asking readers for suggestions. The public response—in letters and donations—was significant, and the situation was even covered by the British Medical Journal. With the financial backing of the many donors, Gomm was able to make a convincing case to the committee for keeping Merrick in the hospital. It was decided that he would be allowed to <b>stay</b> <b>there</b> for the remainder of his life. He was moved from the attic to two rooms in the basement adjacent to a small courtyard. The rooms were adapted and furnished to suit Merrick, with a specially constructed bed and—at Treves's instruction—no mirrors.|$|E

5|$|Danube crested newts {{have the}} longest aquatic {{phase in the}} genus Triturus. Adults move to their {{breeding}} sites in February or March and usually <b>stay</b> <b>there</b> for six months; occasionally, they may even stay longer or return to the water in autumn. Males court females with a display of ritualised body movements. When they have gained the female's interest, they guide it over a spermatophore they deposit on the ground, which the female then takes up with her cloaca. The eggs are fertilised internally. As in other crested newts, a female lays around 200 eggs per season, which are folded individually into leaves of aquatic plants. Larvae develop over two to four months until they reach metamorphosis and leave the water.|$|E
5|$|In March 1792, the King {{commissioned}} Prince Ernest Augustus as {{a colonel}} into the 9th Hanoverian Light Dragoons. The Prince {{served in the}} Low Countries in the War of the First Coalition, under his elder brother Frederick, Duke of York, then commander of the combined British, Hanoverian, and Austrian forces. Seeing action near the Walloon town of Tournai in August 1793, he sustained a sabre wound to the head, {{which resulted in a}} disfiguring scar. During the Battle of Tourcoing in northern France on 18 May 1794 his left arm was injured by a cannonball which passed close by him. In the days after the battle, the sight in his left eye faded. In June, he was sent to Britain to convalesce, his first <b>stay</b> <b>there</b> since 1786.|$|E
5|$|Matilda {{presented}} {{herself as}} continuing the English tradition of centralised royal government, {{and attempted to}} maintain a government in England parallel to Stephen's, including a royal household and a chancellor. Matilda gathered revenues from the royal estates in the counties under her control, particularly in her core territories where the sheriffs were loyal to her cause. She appointed earls to rival those created by Stephen. She was unable to operate a system of royal law courts, however, and her administrative resources were extremely limited, although some of her clerks {{went on to become}} bishops in Normandy. Matilda issued two types of coins in her name during her time in England, which were used in the west of England and Wales. The first were initially minted in Oxford during her <b>stay</b> <b>there,</b> and the design was then adopted by her mints at Bristol, Cardiff and Wareham after her victory at the Battle of Lincoln. A second design was minted at Bristol and Cardiff during the 1140s.|$|E
