5|$|In adults, the {{diagnosis}} {{is supported by the}} absence of classical or structural diseases of the gastrointestinal system. Supportive criteria include a regurgitant that does not taste sour or acidic, is generally odourless, is effortless, or at most preceded by a belching <b>sensation,</b> <b>that</b> there is no retching preceding the regurgitation, and that the act is not associated with nausea or heartburn.|$|E
5|$|Subcutaneous {{emphysema}} is when gas or air is in {{the layer}} under the skin. Subcutaneous refers to the tissue beneath the skin, and emphysema refers to trapped air. It is sometimes abbreviated SCE or SE and also called tissue emphysema, or Sub Q air. Since the air generally comes from the chest cavity, subcutaneous emphysema usually occurs on the chest, neck and face, where {{it is able to}} travel from the chest cavity along the fascia. Subcutaneous emphysema has a characteristic crackling feel to the touch, a <b>sensation</b> <b>that</b> has been described as similar to touching Rice Krispies; this sensation of air under the skin is known as subcutaneous crepitation.|$|E
5|$|A {{person with}} MS can have almost any {{neurological}} symptom or sign, with autonomic, visual, motor, and sensory problems {{being the most}} common. The specific symptoms {{are determined by the}} locations of the lesions within the nervous system, and may include loss of sensitivity or changes in sensation such as tingling, pins and needles or numbness, muscle weakness, blurred vision, very pronounced reflexes, muscle spasms, or difficulty in moving; difficulties with coordination and balance (ataxia); problems with speech or swallowing, visual problems (nystagmus, optic neuritis or double vision), feeling tired, acute or chronic pain, and bladder and bowel difficulties, among others. Difficulties thinking and emotional problems such as depression or unstable mood are also common. Uhthoff's phenomenon, a worsening of symptoms due to exposure to higher than usual temperatures, and Lhermitte's sign, an electrical <b>sensation</b> <b>that</b> runs down the back when bending the neck, are particularly characteristic of MS. The main measure of disability and severity is the expanded disability status scale (EDSS), with other measures such as the multiple sclerosis functional composite being increasingly used in research.|$|E

25|$|Common {{symptoms}} of mercury poisoning include peripheral neuropathy, presenting as paresthesia or itching, burning, pain, {{or even a}} <b>sensation</b> <b>that</b> resembles small insects crawling on or under the skin (formication); skin discoloration (pink cheeks, fingertips and toes); swelling; and desquamation (shedding or peeling of skin).|$|E
25|$|Even so, at {{the start}} of the 1935 season, Gimblett was invited to go to Taunton for a two-week trial with the county. The trial seems not to have been a success, but it led {{directly}} to the <b>sensation</b> <b>that</b> was Gimblett's first-class cricket debut.|$|E
5000|$|Sensory {{phenomena}} are general feelings, urges or bodily <b>sensations</b> <b>that</b> precede or accompany repetitive behaviors {{associated with}} Tourette syndrome and tic disorders. These phenomena are also defined as [...] "generalized or focal uncomfortable feelings or <b>sensations</b> preceding tics <b>that</b> usually are relieved by the movement".|$|R

25|$|Vertigo {{can also}} be {{classified}} into objective, subjective, and pseudovertigo. Objective vertigo describes when the person has the <b>sensation</b> <b>that</b> stationary objects in the environment are moving. Subjective vertigo refers to when the person feels {{as if they are}} moving. The third type is known as pseudovertigo, an intensive sensation of rotation inside the person's head. While this classification appears in textbooks, it {{has little to do with}} the pathophysiology or treatment of vertigo.|$|E
25|$|White wine is {{regularly}} {{used as an}} ingredient. Its acidity balances well with fat taking away excess heaviness. This acidity also refines the meat or fish and it helps {{to break down the}} fibres of the meat to make it tender. The role of white wine {{is similar to that of}} lemon juice used under the same conditions: once verjuice also fulfilled this function. The vinegar combines acidity with a burning <b>sensation</b> <b>that</b> gives recipes where it is used a bittersweet side characteristic.|$|E
25|$|This {{is a rare}} form of synesthesia where {{individuals}} {{feel the}} same <b>sensation</b> <b>that</b> another person feels (such as touch). For instance, when such a synesthete observes someone being tapped on their shoulder, the synesthete involuntarily feels a tap on their own shoulder as well. People {{with this type of}} synesthesia have been shown to have higher empathy levels compared to the general population. This {{may be related to the}} so-called mirror neurons present in the motor areas of the brain, which have also been linked to empathy.|$|E
5000|$|There is no {{such thing}} as a [...] "qualia-free" [...] observer. Qualia are {{collections}} of personal or subjective experiences, feelings, and <b>sensations</b> <b>that</b> inevitably come with human awareness.|$|R

25|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the <b>sensation</b> <b>that</b> greeted the Fox sisters, demonstrations of mediumship (séances and automatic writing, for example) {{proved to be a}} profitable venture, and soon became popular forms of entertainment and spiritual catharsis. The Fox sisters were to earn a living this way and others would follow their lead. Showmanship became an increasingly important part of spiritualism, and the visible, audible, and tangible evidence of spirits escalated as mediums competed for paying audiences. As independent investigating commissions repeatedly established, most notably the 1887 report of the Seybert Commission, fraud was widespread, and some of these cases were prosecuted in the courts.|$|E
25|$|Shallow water {{blackout}} – {{caused by}} hyperventilation prior to swimming or diving. The primary urge to breathe is triggered by rising carbon dioxide (CO2) {{levels in the}} bloodstream. The body detects CO2 levels very accurately and relies on this to control breathing. Hyperventilation reduces the carbon dioxide content of the blood but leaves the diver susceptible to sudden loss of consciousness without warning from hypoxia. There is no bodily <b>sensation</b> <b>that</b> warns a diver of an impending blackout, and victims (often capable swimmers swimming under the surface in shallow water) become unconscious and drown quietly without alerting anyone {{to the fact that}} there is a problem; they are typically found on the bottom.|$|E
25|$|The primary urge {{to breathe}} is {{triggered}} by rising carbon dioxide (CO2) {{levels in the}} bloodstream. Carbon dioxide builds up in the bloodstream when oxygen is metabolized {{and it needs to}} be expelled as a waste product. The body detects carbon dioxide levels very accurately and relies on this as the primary trigger to control breathing. Hyperventilation artificially depletes the resting concentration of carbon dioxide causing a low blood carbon dioxide condition called hypocapnia. Hypocapnia reduces the reflexive respiratory drive, allows the delay of breathing and leaves the diver susceptible to loss of consciousness from hypoxia. For most healthy people the first sign of low oxygen levels is a greyout or unconsciousness: there is no bodily <b>sensation</b> <b>that</b> warns a diver of an impending blackout.|$|E

25|$|There {{are only}} two {{chemical}} bird repellents registered {{for use in the}} United States. They are methyl anthranilate and anthraquinone. Methyl anthranilate is a primary repellent that produces an immediate unpleasant <b>sensation</b> <b>that</b> is reflexive and {{does not have to be}} learned. As such it is most effective for transient populations of birds (DeVault et al. 2013). Methyl anthranilate has been used with great success at rapidly dispersing birds from flightlines at Homestead Air Reserve Station (Engeman et al. 2002). Anthraquinone is a secondary repellent that has a laxative effect that is not instantaneous. Because of this it is most effective on resident populations of wildlife that will have time to learn an aversive response (Izhaki 2002, DeVault et al. 2013).|$|E
25|$|Certain drugs {{increase}} the chances of déjà vu occurring in the user, resulting in a strong <b>sensation</b> <b>that</b> an event or experience currently being experienced has already been experienced in the past. Some pharmaceutical drugs, when taken together, have also been implicated {{in the cause of}} déjà vu. Taiminen and Jääskeläinen (2001) reported the case of an otherwise healthy male who started experiencing intense and recurrent sensations of déjà vu upon taking the drugs amantadine and phenylpropanolamine together to relieve flu symptoms. He found the experience so interesting that he completed the full course of his treatment and reported it to the psychologists to write up as a case study. Because of the dopaminergic action of the drugs and previous findings from electrode stimulation of the brain (e.g. Bancaud, Brunet-Bourgin, Chauvel, & Halgren, 1994), Taiminen and Jääskeläinen speculate that déjà vu occurs as a result of hyperdopaminergic action in the mesial temporal areas of the brain.|$|E
500|$|Lincoln's Inn Fields {{opened on}} 28 June 1661, {{with the first}} [...] "moveable" [...] or [...] "changeable" [...] scenery used on the British public stage, i.e. wings or {{shutters}} that ran in grooves and could be smoothly and mechanically changed between or even within acts. The production was a revamped version of Davenant's own five-year-old opera The Siege of Rhodes. It is not known who painted the scenes or shutters, or whether continental craftsmen {{were responsible for the}} technical construction, but the result was such a <b>sensation</b> <b>that</b> it brought Charles II to a public theatre for the first time.

500|$|Although the Bouffes-Parisiens {{played to}} full houses, the theatre was {{constantly}} {{on the verge of}} running out of money, principally because of what his biographer Alexander Faris calls [...] "Offenbach's incorrigible extravagance as a manager". An earlier biographer, André Martinet, wrote, [...] "Jacques spent money without counting. Whole lengths of velvet were swallowed up in the auditorium; costumes devoured width after width of satin." [...] Moreover, Offenbach was personally generous and liberally hospitable. To boost the company's finances, a London season was organised in 1857, with half the company remaining in Paris to play at the Salle Choiseul and the other half performing at the St James's Theatre in the West End of London. The visit was a success, but did not cause the <b>sensation</b> <b>that</b> Offenbach's later works did in London.|$|E

They also praise the theme of the [...] "smooth-riding coaster" [...] stating [...] "the mysterious crime-fighter is a proven crowd-pleaser". American Coaster Enthusiasts have also praised the ride, awarding it Coaster Landmark status in 2005. They describe the ride as a [...] "revolutionary design" [...] which offers [...] "unprecedented intensity, while maintaining remarkable smoothness, comfort, and pacing". Ultimate Rollercoaster describes Batman: The Ride as [...] "the ride of your life". They state [...] "the sensation created by an inverted coaster is very different from that of traditional roller coasters. It is a <b>sensation</b> <b>that</b> every coaster fan must experience".|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} Randles was {{three and a}} half, she was invited to play for King George III, Queen Charlotte {{and other members of}} the Royal Family. The recital was a success and the king {{presented}} Randles with 100 guineas (worth approximately £96,000 in 2014). She created such a <b>sensation</b> <b>that</b> Caroline, Princess of Wales, wished to adopt her though her father would not allow it. The publicity of the royal concert led to a subsequent breakfast concert for the public, with tickets costing 1 guinea each (approximately £960 in 2014). The concert was held at Cumberland Gardens, with approximately 500 people [...] "of first rank" [...] attending. All profits of the breakfast, as well as donations by the attendees, were given to Randles in the form of various trusts.|$|E
