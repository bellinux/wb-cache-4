40|$|A spherical nanocrystal, {{also known}} as a quantum dot, is often {{referred}} to as an artificial atom due to its remarkable discrete and size-tunable physical properties. Just as bonding between natural atoms forms molecules, coupling between discrete groupings of artificial atoms creates artificial nanocrystal molecules. There are two primary mechanisms by which this coupling can occur: plasmonic coupling through organic linkers, and electronic coupling through inorganic interconnections. Analogous to natural molecules, artificial nanocrystal molecules with a myriad of physiochemical properties may be obtained from a discrete set of atomic building blocks. Enormous potential exists for exciting and useful behaviors to arise in these new materials. Thus, the design and characterization of nanocrystal molecules is a significant endeavor. This dissertation explores the new physical properties that can arise in a nanocrystal molecule, and demonstrates the use of artificial molecules as probes in biological and materials systems. Chapter 1 provides an introduction to nanocrystal molecules, highlighting their synthetic preparation and physical properties. Biomolecules can serve as the organic linker bonds between plasmonic nanocrystals, and additionally provide interesting systems to probe. Chapter 2 describes the use of gold nanocrystal molecules to elucidate a force-generating ultrastructure present in prokaryotic systems. Inorganic interconnections enable nanocrystal molecules of different shapes and behaviors. Chapter 3 investigates the strain-dependent photoluminescence of CdSe/CdS nanocrystal molecules with three different topologies: the sphere, rod, and tetrapod. The effects of shape on strain-dependence are discussed. Importantly, tetrapod nanocrystals are observed to exhibit differential photoluminescence behavior under hydrostatic and non-hydrostatic environments, suggesting that the tetrapod may be useful as a gauge of local stress. Chapter 4 presents the design and implementation of a luminescent nanocrystal <b>stress</b> <b>gauge.</b> The tetrapod <b>stress</b> <b>gauge</b> is calibrated in a simple uniaxial tensile geometry. Tetrapod luminescence is further used to reveal the local microscale stress profile of a polymer fiber. The microscale measurements support previous observations of local mobility and predictions of local stress behavior. In addition to shape, the chemical composition of artificial atom components alters the optoelectronic behavior of the resultant nanocrystal molecule. Typically, an organic or nanocrystal fluorophore exhibits radiative emission from a single transition. Chapter 5 discusses the observation of multiple radiative emission peaks in fluorescence spectroscopy studies of single CdSe/CdS tetrapods. The dependence of multiple emission on external factors including CdS arm length, incident power, and excitation energy suggest that this photophysical phenomenon is due to spatially direct and indirect transitions within the nanocrystal molecule. Unique nanocrystal molecule designs will likely allow further control over the lifetime, oscillator strength, and energy of the indirect transition. A significant advantage of colloidal nanocrystals is their ease of incorporation into many different systems. Chapter 6 highlights the tetrapod quantum dot as a dynamic nanocrystal probe that fluorescently reports cellular forces with spatial and temporal resolution. Rat-derived cardiomyocytes are cultured on a luminescent tetrapod array and induce clear time-dependent spectral shifts in the array emission. The small size and colloidal state of the tetrapod suggest that it may be further developed as a tool to measure cellular forces in vivo and with nanoscale spatial resolution. The tetrapod can additionally be utilized to convert biochemical inputs into optical signals, which may be useful for applications including synthetic biology designs. Concluding remarks are presented in Chapter 7...|$|E
40|$|Granular {{materials}} can consume {{large amounts of}} kinetic energy through deformation of their inherently complex meso-structure. Little is understood about what effect the geometrical variations such as particle size and shape have on their response to shock loading. With this in mind, this thesis attempts to measure the effects that particle size has on the compaction curve of brittle granular materials. Three monodisperse and one polydisperse samples of soda-lime glass microspheres were chosen for this study. A quartz sand was also investigated {{to determine if the}} microspheres were a sufficient analogue whilst additionally introducing morphological differences. Beds of these materials were subjected to quasi-static loading therefore measuring the stress-density compaction response. Post-loading analysis of the samples revealed a strong dependence on particle size and morphology. The macro-scale shock compaction responses of the granular samples were measured using plate impact techniques and piezo-resistive <b>stress</b> <b>gauge</b> diagnostics. Similar trends were observed in the quasi-static loading behaviour. Smaller particles appeared to have higher strength in the macroscale which, due to scaling effects at boundaries, contradicted trends from meso-scopic fracture tests. It was concluded that beds composed of smaller, spherical particles show the greatest resistance to shock and quasi-static compaction. For convenience, a single Hugoniot relationship is typically used to represent the shock response of granular materials. This assumption was challenged in this thesis. Identical incident shock loading produced different loading states with a changing bed thickness. The terminal loading states varied considerably with bed thickness in the samples of larger microspheres. The majority of this variation was due to dispersion within the initial portion of the wave. The study concludes that particle size has a significant effect on the shock response of granular materials if the particle geometry is suited to inducing a total-fracture particle densification mechanism.

The results show that microplasticity by combined (primary) prismatic and (secondary) basal slips can well capture the characteristic features observed experimentally for shocked Lucalox. For AD 995, the results show that porosity has a much more significant role than glassy grain boundaries in causing its lower shock strength than Lucalox. Its shock response can be well modeled by a combination of void-induced intense basal twinning and prismatic slip. The mesoscopic model has also been used to extract from the available experimental data the crystal elasticity and plasticity properties of aluminum oxynitride (AlON). ^ At the macroscopic level, a homogeneous continuum model, which combines nonlinear elasticity and pressure-dependent plasticity for effective strength description has been proposed. A procedure for determining the material parameters via matching the model simulations with the available shock wave profile measurements has been demonstrated for AlON and for a polycrystalline α- 6 H silicon carbide (SiC-N). ^ Finally, a new finite element piezoresistance model for interpreting the measurement of a manganin <b>stress</b> <b>gauge</b> has been developed and calibrated with the longitudinal gauge measurements obtained in the shock-compressed SiC-N.
