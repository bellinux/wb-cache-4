5|$|Blaise Pascal {{invented the}} {{mechanical}} calculator in 1642; {{it was the}} first operational adding machine. It made use of a gravity-assisted carry mechanism. It was the only operational mechanical calculator in the 17thcentury and the earliest automatic, digital computer. Pascal's calculator was limited by its carry mechanism, which forced its wheels to only turn one way so it could add. To <b>subtract,</b> the operator had to use the Pascal's calculator's complement, which required as many steps as an addition. Giovanni Poleni followed Pascal, building the second functional mechanical calculator in 1709, a calculating clock made of wood that, once setup, could multiply two numbers automatically.|$|E
5|$|For a {{transmission}} line carrying sinusoidal waves, {{the phase of}} the reflected wave is continually changing with distance, {{with respect to the}} incident wave, as it proceeds back down the line. Because of this continuous change there are certain points on the line that the reflection will be in phase with the incident wave and the amplitude of the two waves will add. There will be other points where the two waves are in anti-phase and will consequently <b>subtract.</b> At these latter points the amplitude is at a minimum and they are known as nodes. If the incident wave has been totally reflected and the line is lossless, there will be complete cancellation at the nodes with zero signal present there despite the ongoing transmission of waves in both directions. The points where the waves are in phase are anti-nodes and represent a peak in amplitude. Nodes and anti-nodes alternate along the line and the combined wave amplitude varies continuously between them. The combined (incident plus reflected) wave appears to be standing still on the line and is called a standing wave.|$|E

5|$|Iridescence, as {{explained}} by Thomas Young in 1803, is created when extremely thin films reflect {{part of the}} light falling on them from their top surfaces. The rest of the light goes through the films, and a further {{part of it is}} reflected from their bottom surfaces. The two sets of reflected waves travel back upwards in the same direction. But since the bottom-reflected waves travelled a little further – controlled by the thickness and refractive index of the film, and the angle at which the light fell – the two sets of waves are out of phase. When the waves are one or more whole wavelength apart – in other words at certain specific angles, they add (interfere constructively), giving a strong reflection. At other angles and phase differences, they can <b>subtract,</b> giving weak reflections. The thin film therefore selectively reflects just one wavelength – a pure colour – at any given angle, but other wavelengths – different colours – at different angles. So, as a thin-film structure like a butterfly's wing or bird's feather moves, it seems to change colour.|$|E
5|$|Saggers was in {{stronger}} form {{following his}} tour to England. On 10 December 1948, Saggers, included in AL Hassett's XI for Test trial matches and benefits, {{as well as}} continuing his career at New South Wales, scored 38 for the latter against Queensland. At the same time, he aided Jack Moroney in his own comeback to cricket at New South Wales by suggesting he <b>subtract</b> three years from his age when he submitted his registration form. Overall in the 1948–1949 season he scored 300runs from nine matches, his highest season total, at 25.00, and taking 21catches and six stumpings. Following the South Africa tour of 1949–1950 he returned to Australia again for one final season from 1950–1951, however played only one match, scoring five runs and taking two catches. Through his entire first-class career of 77appearances from 1939 until 1951, he was to make one century in a tour match against Essex and eight half-centuries for New South Wales, ending with 1,888runs {{at an average of}} 23.89, together with 146catches and 75stumpings.|$|E
