2500|$|Frick {{had ordered}} the {{construction}} of a <b>solid</b> <b>board</b> fence topped with barbed wire around mill property. The workers dubbed the newly fortified mill [...] "Fort Frick." [...] With the mill ringed by striking workers, agents from the Pinkerton National Detective Agency, which Frick had contracted to provide security at the plant in April 1892, planned to access the plant grounds from the river. Three hundred Pinkerton detectives assembled on the Davis Island Dam on the Ohio River about five miles (8km) below Pittsburgh at 10:30p.m. on the night of July 5, 1892. They were given Winchester rifles, placed on two specially-equipped barges and towed upriver with the object of removing the workers by force. Upon their landing, a large mêlée between workers and Pinkerton detectives ensued. Several men were killed, nine workers among them, and the riot was ultimately quelled only by the intervention of 8,000 armed state militia. Among working-class Americans, Frick's actions against the strikers were condemned as excessive, and he soon became a target of even more union organizers.|$|E

5000|$|An {{electromagnetic}} pen-based {{interactive whiteboard}} involves {{an array of}} wires embedded behind the <b>solid</b> <b>board</b> surface that interacts with a coil in the stylus tip to determine the horizontal and vertical coordinates of the stylus. The pen itself usually is passive, i.e., it contains no batteries or other power source; it alters the electrical signals produced by the board. For instance, when {{close to the surface}} of the board, the mouse pointer can be sensed, giving the board [...] "mouse-over" [...] capabilities. When it is pressed in against the board in one way, the board activates a switch in the pen to signal a mouse click to the computer; pressed in another way, contact with the board signals a click of the right mouse-button. Like a scaled-up version of a graphics tablet used by professional digital artists and designers, an electromagnetic IWB can emulate mouse actions accurately, will not malfunction if a user leans on the board, and can potentially handle multiple inputs.|$|E

The zero-defects project was a local production improvement project based on approaches, tools and methods known as Lean. The project is seen as an actor-network, which means that its reality, and the understandings and practices of it, are effects of the web of people, structures, technologies and others who relate to it. The analysis is thus an exploration of the networks of relations, how these relations assemble or not, and the effects of these networks. The goal of the zero-defects project was to contribute to a zero-defects practice based on mutual learning processes and broad participation.

40|$|Functional {{chemicals}} {{are used in}} paper production to enhance specific characteristics in the final paper product. One functional chemicals category is internal sizing chemicals which are used to create liquid resistance hydrophobicity in the paper, at the wet end of the production process. This thesis report calculated the environmental burdens of three internal sizing chemicals produced by Eka Chemicals, a business unit of AkzoNobel. The three chemicals under study are a specific product {{of each of the}} following categories: Alkyl Ketene Dimer (AKD), Alkenyl Succinic Anhydride (ASA) and Cationic Dispersion Rosin. A Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was performed from cradle to end customer gate. The Carbon, Energy and Water Footprint of the three products were calculated using Gabi 4 software. The functional unit used in LCA was the kilograms of dry sizing chemical required for the production of 1 kg of paper. Two paper grades were used; copy paper, where AKD and ASA are mostly applied and <b>solid</b> <b>board,</b> where ASA and Rosin are applied. The Carbon Footprint for copy paper and a distribution distance 1500 km was found to be 2, 5 kg CO 2 eqv/ton paper for AKD, 5, 1 kg CO 2 eqv/ton paper for ASA and 4, 9 kg CO 2 eqv/ton paper for Rosin. The Energy Footprint results for the same case were 62 MJ/ton paper consumed by AKD, 136 MJ/ton paper by ASA and 228 MJ/ton paper by Rosin. The Water Footprint results for copy paper and 1500 km distribution distance were 0, 1 m 3 water/ton paper consumed by AKD, 0, 3 m 3 water/ton paper by ASA and 0, 5 m 3 /ton paper by Rosin. Dominance analysis diagrams illustrated that for all three sizing chemicals raw material production is a hotspot both for the Carbon Footprint and the Energy Footprint. Data was evaluated and a sensitivity analysis was performed on assumptions, allocation percentages and scenarios (including and not including the emulsification of ASA). The results conclude that AKD is the best alternative according to the Carbon, Energy and Water Footprint calculated for all applications. For <b>solid</b> <b>board</b> the best choice for large distribution distances appears to be ASA. www. ima. kth. s...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Diagnostic reasoning, {{defined as}} the ability to infer unobserved causes based on the {{observation}} of their effects, is a central cognitive competency of humans. Yet, little is known about diagnostic reasoning in non-human primates, and what we know is largely restricted to the Great Apes. To track the evolutionary history of these skills within primates, we investigated long-tailed macaques’ understanding of the significance of inclinations of covers of hidden food as diagnostic indicators for the presence of an object located underneath. Subjects were confronted with choices between different objects that might cover food items. Based on their physical characteristics, the shape and orientation of the covers did or did not reveal the location of a hidden reward. For instance, hiding the reward under a <b>solid</b> <b>board</b> led to its inclination, whereas a hollow cup remained unaltered. Thus, the type of cover and the occurrence or absence of a change in their appearance could potentially be used to reason diagnostically about the location of the reward. In several experiments, the maca-ques were confronted with a varying number of covers and their performance was dependent on the level of complexity and on the type of change of the covers ’ orientation. The macaques could use a board’s inclination to detect the reward, but failed to do so if the lack of inclination was indicative of an alternative hiding place. We suggest that the monkeys ’ performance is based on a rudimentary understanding of causality, but find no good evidence for sophisticated diagnostic reasoning in this particular domain...|$|E
40|$|In 1999, the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) District Board, in California, {{adopted a}} policy {{creating}} {{a framework for}} BART system expansion that placed new emphasis on cost-effectiveness, ridership generation, multimodal access, transit-oriented development, local partnerships, {{and the use of}} appropriate transit technologies. The board directed staff to develop criteria and a detailed process for implementing these goals. The resulting expansion planning process and criteria for the BART system, adopted by the BART board in December 2002, are described along with the method used to develop the criteria and process. Some of the implementation issues that have arisen are assessed. The process uses a strategic opportunities assessment as an initial sketch-planning evaluation tool and then applies criteria and a rating system to evaluate preliminary proposals as well as project alternatives that proceed to environmental review and beyond. The rating system also indicates to local jurisdictions the kinds of access and land development that would support a BART investment. As part of the process, localities are encouraged to prepare a ridership development plan that puts in place transit-supportive plans, zoning, infrastructure, and services. Extensive consultation with the board and other stake holders helped build understanding of the issues and <b>solid</b> <b>board</b> support for the new planning process and criteria. Application of the new process has led to transit-supportive plans and zoning changes in several local jurisdictions. Some jurisdictions are not prepared to make the land use changes needed for a “high” project rating and are considering lower-cost transit alternatives...|$|E
40|$|Knowledge {{about how}} tree {{properties}} affect {{the final product}} is necessary to utilise each log and tree in the forestry production chain fully. So far, the Swedish Pine Stem Bank (SPSB) has been used extensively for sawing simulation, but not for simulation further down the production process. Hence, it is desirable to model the further processing of sawn timber using the SPSB. In this study, a simulation tool for cross cutting and finger jointing of boards has been developed and tested. The simulation program utilises the SPSB and the results from a sawmill simulation program to simulate a cross-cutting and finger-jointing process. The tool has been tested against an empirical material consisting of defect data from an industrial scanner, used at a producer of finger-jointed furniture products. To illustrate the potential use of the finger-jointing simulation program, two investigations have also been carried out. The first deals with comparing the recovery for finger jointing and cutting of <b>solid</b> <b>boards</b> for different products. The second investigation {{is an attempt to}} estimate the impact of process-related defects on the recovery of finger-jointed products. The results show that the simulation tool produces similar results as the real process, {{and the use of the}} SPSB provides adequate predictions of the real system’s behaviour. The first of the investigations shows that finger jointing generally has a better recovery than cutting of <b>solid</b> <b>boards,</b> but for short products, the latter might be a viable option. The second investigation suggests that process-related defects reduce recovery by up to 5 % units in the finger-joint process studied. Thus, there is future potential for using the finger-jointing simulation tool to investigate production strategies and/or raw material selection in the forestry production chain.
