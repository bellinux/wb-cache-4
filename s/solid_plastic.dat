25|$|Set {{gillnets}} {{consist of}} a single netting wall kept vertical by a floatline (upper line/headrope) and a weighted groundline (lower line/footrope). Small floats, usually shaped like eggs or cylinders and made of <b>solid</b> <b>plastic,</b> are evenly distributed along the floatline, while lead weights are evenly distributed along groundline. The lower line can also be made of lead cored rope, which does not need additional weight. The net is set on the bottom, or at a distance above it and held in place with anchors or weights on both ends. By adjusting the design these nets can fish in surface layers, in mid water or at the bottom, targeting pelagic, demersal or benthic species. On small boats gillnets are handled by hand. Larger boats use hydraulic net haulers or net drums. Set gillnets are widely used all over the world, and are employed both in inland and sea waters. They are popular with artisanal fisheries because no specialized gear is needed, and it is low cost based {{on the relationship of}} fuel/fish.|$|E
2500|$|Azo-type {{pigments}} used in tattoos tend to cleave through {{enzymatic catalysis}} of redox reactions, resulting in highly electrophilic aromatic amine by-products capable of covalently binding with DNA. Naphthol and Azos break down in sunlight exposure into toxic and/or carcinogenic aromatic amines. [...] As with heavy metals, these by-products of the pigments’ decomposition accumulate in the lymphatic system. [...] Plastic-based inks (e.g., glow-in-the-dark ink) {{are known to}} lead to polymerisation under the skin, where the tattoo pigment particles converge into one <b>solid</b> <b>plastic</b> piece under the skin.|$|E
2500|$|Since then, various {{detection}} {{methods have been}} used. Super Kamiokande is a large volume of water surrounded by photomultiplier tubes that watch for the Cherenkov radiation emitted when an incoming neutrino creates an electron or muon in the water. The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory is similar, but uses heavy water as the detecting medium, which uses the same effects, but also allows the additional reaction any-flavor neutrino photo-dissociation of deuterium, resulting in a free neutron which is then detected from gamma radiation after chlorine-capture. Other detectors have consisted of large volumes of chlorine or gallium which are periodically checked for excesses of argon or germanium, respectively, which are created by electron-neutrinos interacting with the original substance. MINOS used a <b>solid</b> <b>plastic</b> scintillator coupled to photomultiplier tubes, while Borexino uses a liquid pseudocumene scintillator also watched by photomultiplier tubes and the NOνA detector uses liquid scintillator watched by avalanche photodiodes. The IceCube Neutrino Observatory uses [...] of the Antarctic ice sheet near the south pole with photomultiplier tubes distributed throughout the volume.|$|E

2500|$|Aqua Skoot: Invented by Ken Bailey in {{the early}} 1980s, riders would carry a hard, <b>solid</b> <b>plastic</b> sled {{up to the top}} of the ride, go down a slide {{consisting}} of rollers akin to those found in factories, warehouses, or assembly lines, and end up in a pool that in most areas was no deeper than a puddle. The idea of the ride was to, once the sled hit the water, skip across the water like a stone. In order to do this the rider had to be in a certain position, leaned back. If the rider was not in this position, the sled would sink into the water as soon as it hit the pool, flinging the rider off head-first, which often resulted in head injuries. Other times, riders would be leaving the pool only to have others crash into them as they were riding. This ride consisted of parallel slides originally. [...] At some point in the mid 1980s, a third slide was added. Each slide was 30' long. [...] The slides were removed when Intrawest took over the resort in 1998, the pool was redesigned into the Lost Island River which is part of the children's section. [...] The platform / tower riders climbed to ride the Aqua Skoot became the Treetop Cabanas in 2003.|$|E
2500|$|Through the 1970s the {{hand-held}} electronic calculator underwent rapid development. The red LED and blue/green vacuum fluorescent displays consumed a lot {{of power}} and the calculators either had a short battery life (often measured in hours, so rechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries were common) or were large so that they could take larger, higher capacity batteries. In the early 1970s liquid-crystal displays (LCDs) were in their infancy and {{there was a great deal}} of concern that they only had a short operating lifetime. Busicom introduced the Busicom LE-120A [...] "HANDY" [...] calculator, the first pocket-sized calculator and the first with an LED display, and announced the Busicom LC with LCD. However, there were problems with this display and the calculator never went on sale. The first successful calculators with LCDs were manufactured by Rockwell International and sold from 1972 by other companies under such names as: Dataking LC-800, Harden DT/12, Ibico 086, Lloyds 40, Lloyds 100, Prismatic 500 (a.k.a. P500), Rapid Data Rapidman 1208LC. The LCDs were an early form using the Dynamic Scattering Mode DSM with the numbers appearing as bright against a dark background. To present a high-contrast display these models illuminated the LCD using a filament lamp and <b>solid</b> <b>plastic</b> light guide, which negated the low power consumption of the display. These models appear to have been sold only for a year or two.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A {{mechanism}} of particles aggregation in liquid media is analyzed {{by applying the}} theory of aggregation which {{was developed in the}} field of colloid engineering. Hydrophobic particles are liable to aggregate in collision. Inclusions aggregation by using <b>solid</b> <b>plastics</b> particles in various solvent is observed in the course of floatation. Aggregation rate and size distribution of particles in turbulent dispersions has been studied. The aggregation contributed by plastic particles based on surface energy density and the droplet surface oscillation is considered. Hydrophobic particles, generally having a tendency to aggregate in water, disperse well in ethanol, particles in the mixture of water and ethanol are much better disperse than separately in water. The solvent properties, temperature and simulation particles are influence to the aggregation from the experiment that we can discover. The aggregation rate and size distribution were determined by wettabiliy...|$|R
