40|$|Mirror shape {{accuracy}} {{as a key}} optical {{performance parameter}} for parabolic trough collectors can be assessed accurately by common measurement systems proving the high quality of state-of-the-art mirror panels. However, measurement results cannot always be compared directly because critical boundary conditions are not yet standardized. This paper quantifies the differences in shape accuracy results between the most common measurement setups for parabolic trough mirror panels and identifies measurement position, mounting mode and <b>support</b> <b>frame</b> employed for the measurement as relevant boundary conditions. Deflectometric measurements of mirror panels of RP 3 geometry were performed at DLR’s QUARZ Center Cologne in vertical (mounting points vertically and curved direction horizontally aligned) and horizontal measurement position (mirrors facing upward with mounting points horizontally aligned), both with and without tightening the mirrors to a <b>support</b> <b>frame</b> with screws. Finite element models were applied to calculate gravity-induced deformation and resulting slope and focus deviation on three different types of support frame: an ideally rigid <b>support</b> <b>frame,</b> a laboratory <b>support</b> <b>frame,</b> and an ideal <b>support</b> <b>frame</b> with elastic brackets. The measurement results demonstrate that the difference in position and mounting mode can lead to relevant deviations of the shape accuracy results higher than {{the uncertainty of the}} employed deflectometric measurement system. For RP 3 inner mirror panels a difference of up to 0. 7 mrad in root mean square slope deviation (SDx) and 3. 3 mm in root mean square focus deviation (FDx) from vertical to horizontal position was measured. Mirror shape specifications may thus not be applicable in all positions. Concerning the mounting onto different types of modeled <b>support</b> <b>frame</b> (in horizontal position) a variation of 0. 5 mrad (SDx) and 1. 8 mm (FDx) was calculated for perfectly shaped RP 3 inner mirrors mounted onto an ideally rigid <b>support</b> <b>frame</b> compared to the case when mounted to a <b>support</b> <b>frame</b> with elastic brackets...|$|R

40|$|The present thesis {{examines}} {{the influence of}} measurement parameters and boundary conditions on shape accuracy of parabolic trough concentrator mirrors of RP 3 geometry by means of optical measurements and finite element analyses. Deflectometric measurements of mirror panels are performed in common laboratory setups: in vertical and horizontal measurement position, both with and without tightening the mirrors to a <b>support</b> <b>frame</b> with screws. The results serve for validation of finite element models which are applied to calculate the difference in shape accuracy between, firstly, the individual setups and secondly, between mirrors horizontally fixed to differently rigid <b>support</b> <b>frames.</b> The effect of angular deviations of the mounting pads is assessed. Gravity-induced deformation of mirrors mounted to two exemplary collector support structures is determined for the relevant working positions. The transferability of shape accuracy data measured in laboratory to data applying for mirrors mounted to a collector is assessed. For RP 3 inner mirror panels a difference of up to 0. 8 mrad in root mean square slope deviation (SDx) and 3. 3 mm in root mean square focus deviation (FDx) from vertical to horizontal position is measured. Gravity-induced deformation and resulting slope and focus deviation on three different types of horizontally oriented <b>support</b> <b>frames</b> is modeled: an ideally rigid <b>support</b> <b>frame,</b> a laboratory <b>support</b> <b>frame,</b> and an ideal <b>support</b> <b>frame</b> with elastic brackets. A variation of 0. 5 mrad (SDx) and 1. 8 mm (FDx) is calculated for perfectly shaped RP 3 inner mirrors mounted onto an ideally rigid <b>support</b> <b>frame</b> compared to the case when mounted to a <b>support</b> <b>frame</b> with elastic brackets. In case of an angular deviation of the mounting pads mirror panels fixed to an ideally rigid <b>support</b> <b>frame</b> show additional local slope deviation in {{the magnitude of the}} angular pad deviation. Due to gravity-induced deformation and slope deviation the shape accuracy of RP 3 inner mirrors mounted to an ideally rigid collector support structure varies up to 1. 0 mrad in SDx and up to 1. 2 mrad in SDx when compared to the ideal shape and the shape in zenith collector angle, respectively. For RP 3 inner mirrors mounted to a collector structure with elastic brackets the values are 1. 6 mrad and 2. 1 mrad. Whereas the models of mirrors mounted to a laboratory <b>support</b> <b>frame</b> allow for a conversion and thus a comparison of results obtained in different setups, the models for the collector support structure need to be refined in order to allow for a conversion from laboratory to collector measurement results. The results demonstrate that measurement position, mounting mode and employed support structure have to be documented in order to obtain reproducible measurement results. They should hence be included as measurement boundary conditions in guidelines for the measurement and assessment of mirror shape accuracy for concentrating solar collectors. The inspection of the angular accuracy of the mounting pads is part of a complete optical mirror assessment. The data of standardized shape accuracy measurement serve for subsequent calculation of intercept factors and annual energy yields {{as well as for the}} evaluation of optimization approaches...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the universalization, improvement and {{further development of}} a compact crane <b>support</b> <b>frame</b> for flatbed trucks. The work has been conducted at El och Fordonsteknik AB (henceforth EFAB) in Uppsala. The aim of the work has been to shorten the assembly time of the product.

This {{has been done by}} universalizing the <b>support</b> <b>frame</b> to be compatible with most of the chassis EFAB works with. Additionally, the entire construction has been made lighter, which will make it a more attractive choice for customers.

One such limitation has been the geometry of the truck bed that the <b>support</b> <b>frame</b> shall be compatible with.
