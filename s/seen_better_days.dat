5|$|On June 22, 2010, {{the town}} of Lyndhurst put forward a {{proposal}} to buy the station depots at both Kingsland and Lyndhurst stations. The mayor of Lyndhurst, Richard DiLascio, said that the stations have <b>seen</b> <b>better</b> <b>days</b> and New Jersey Transit {{has no interest in}} renovating both buildings. Design plans for Kingsland station look towards a new coffee shop, after repairing and renovating the building. The station would also be converted from its old subway tile to a newer retro look for the building, paid for by leasing the building. Because an average of 440 to over 1,000 people use the Kingsland station daily, it would look better for {{the town of}} Lyndhurst to make a good impression on the riders. Asof 2012, the station house was unoccupied. The town of Lyndhurst has requested that NJT lease the building to the municipality so that it might be renovated and brought into use as a way to revitalize the immediate vicinity.|$|E

Swartzwelder also pitched the plot idea about the angry dog who chases Bart in the episode.|$|E

2500|$|The third {{pairing of}} Neagle and Wilding in the [...] "London Films", as {{the series of}} films came to be called, was in Spring in Park Lane (1948). A drama, this {{depicted}} the romance between a millionaire's niece and a footman (actually a nobleman who has <b>seen</b> <b>better</b> <b>days).</b> The script was written by Nicholas Phipps, who also played Wilding's brother. Although not a musical, it contains a dream sequence featuring the song [...] "The Moment I Saw You". Spring in Park Lane was the 1949 Picturegoer winner for Best Film, Actor and Actress. Neagle and Wilding were together for a fourth time in the Technicolor romance Maytime in Mayfair (1949). The plot is reminiscent of Roberta, as it had Wilding inheriting a dress shop owned by Neagle.|$|E
2500|$|Sackville Street prospered in the 1800s, {{though an}} {{invisible}} boundary {{seems to have}} been maintained for some time between the Upper and Lower street. As planned, Lower Sackville Street became highly successful as a commercial location; its terraces ambitiously lined with purpose-designed retail units, one of the first schemes of its kind in Europe. By contrast the northern end proved not to be as successful initially; being exposed to the commercial activity of the lower street, it lost its fashionability as a quiet enclave of grand townhouses, whilst also being too far away from the commercial core of the city to stand as a strong retail location. As a result, a difference between the two ends of the street developed: the planned lower end successful and bustling next to the river, and the upper end featuring a mixture of less prominent businesses and old townhouses, some converted for commercial use and growing somewhat decrepit. Upon his visit to Dublin in 1845, William Makepeace Thackeray observed: [...] "The street is exceedingly broad and handsome; the shops at the commencement, rich and spacious; but in Upper Sackville Street, which closes with the pretty building and gardens of the Rotunda, the appearance of wealth begins to fade somewhat, and the houses look as if they had <b>seen</b> <b>better</b> <b>days.</b> Even in this, the great street of the town, there is scarcely any one, and it is as vacant and listless as Pall Mall in October." ...|$|E

40|$|The current {{production}} of the Hungarian agricultural machinery manufacturing sector, which used to <b>see</b> <b>better</b> <b>days,</b> lags behind the {{production of}} the previous years to a great extent. Our study reveals the initial results of longer research work. We examine how the innovation activity of organisations changed during the period between 2007 and 2009. The conclusions of our paper are based on the examination results of questionnaires and in-depth interviews that were carried out at 40 Hungarian agricultural machinery manufacturing companies. The characteristic features of the companies that were involved in the examination reflect the Hungarian conditions properly. Besides the brand-new or higly developed products and technological (procedure) innovations, novelties in organisation and marketing are also paid attention. Furthermore, some of the indicators of the innovation performance of the companies are also presented. The question of cooperation between the organisations taking part in innovation is referred to, as well. The other results of the research are detailed in our further publications...|$|R

50|$|I {{die without}} remorse; in the insurrection I only desired the {{well-being}} and independence Britain of my country. My views and my actions were sincere and were innocent {{of any of}} the crimes which dis-honor mankind, and which are too common when released passions boil up... In spite of so many mishaps, my heart still keeps its courage and its hopes for the future; my children and my friends will <b>see</b> <b>better</b> <b>days.</b> Looking tranquilly ahead, I am sure that they will win freedom. That is what fills me with joy when all around me is sorry and desolation... I leave behind me children whose only heritage is the memory of my misfortune. Poor orphans, it is you who are to be pitied, you whom the bloody and arbitrary hand of the law strikes through my death. You will have no gentile and affectionate memories of happy days with your father. When you are old enough to reflect, you will see in your father a man who has paid on the scaffold for actions such as have immortalized other happier men. The only crime of your father was his failure.|$|R

60|$|The {{projected}} walk {{was never}} taken, for {{by and by}} Marty's mother fell ill, and Marty had to be with her, nursing her night and day. And months went by, and at length, when her mother died, she {{was not in a}} fit condition to go long walks and climb those long, steep slopes. After the child was born, it was harder than ever to leave the house, and Johnnie, too, had so much work at the farm that he had little inclination to go out on Sundays. They ceased to speak of the tree, and their long-projected pilgrimage was impracticable until they could <b>see</b> <b>better</b> <b>days.</b> But the wished time never came, for, after the first child, Marty was never strong. Then a second child came, then a third; and so five years went by, of toil and suffering and love, and the tree, with all their hopes and fears and intentions regarding it, was less and less in their minds, and was all but forgotten. Only Johnnie, when at long intervals his master sent him to Salisbury with the cart, remembered it all only too well when, coming {{to the top of the}} down, he saw the old thorn directly before him. Passing it, he would turn his face away not to see it too closely, or, perhaps, to avoid being recognised by it. Then came the time of their extreme poverty, when there was no work at the farm and no one of their own people to help tide them over a season of scarcity, for the old people were dead or in the workhouse or so poor as to want help themselves. It was then that, in his misery at the sight of his ailing anxious wife--the dear Marty of the beautiful vanished days--and his three little hungry children, that he went out into the field one dark night to get them food.|$|R

500|$|Though Stivetts {{initially}} denied it, it {{was reported}} on September28, 1891 that he signed with the Boston Beaneaters of the National League(NL) for the 1892season. Stivetts joined a pitching rotation that already included future Baseball Hall of Fame members John Clarkson and Kid Nichols, as well as veteran Harry Staley. With Boston's solid pitching staff, and their potent mix of position players consisting of future Hall of Fame members and established veterans, the team was expected to compete for a second consecutive NL championship.

On June23, he hit his first home run of the season, along with a double, in a 13–6victory over the Baltimore Orioles. The Pittsburg Dispatch reported on July1 that Stivetts was leading Boston hitters in batting at that point in the season.|$|R
