50|$|An {{inoculation}} needle is {{an essential}} tool in inoculating a <b>stab</b> culture. A sterile <b>stab</b> culture cap is removed and the open end is flamed. The needle tip and its length is then pushed into the <b>stab</b> media and stopped once the needle tip reaches 0.5 inches away {{from the bottom of}} the <b>stab</b> media. The inoculation needle is withdrawn from the media in the same direction and path that it was pushed into the <b>stab</b> media to prevent the wobbling effect that may disturbed the culture. The needle is sterilized by flaming.|$|R

5|$|As {{a sequel}} to , T2 3-D: Battle Across Time {{introduced}} two new Terminator characters. The first is the Cyberdyne's latest invention, the T-1000000. It is a large spider-like version of the T-1000 that defends Skynet's CPU from attack. Like the T-1000, it is made of mimetic polyalloy, allowing it to form its legs into <b>stabbing</b> weapons. The only known T-1000000 was destroyed when Skynet's core was destroyed.|$|E
40|$|The {{radiological}} {{depiction of}} <b>stab</b> wounds in soft-tissues using multislice computed tomography {{is difficult and}} the hereby obtained images often lack contrast. To overcome these shortcomings we tried a new method. We gently instilled the contrast medium Lipiodol((R)) Ultra-fluide into five experimentally induced <b>stab</b> wounds on a pork haunch. Subsequent MSCT reconstructions of the wounds delivered clear, for medical laymen easily appreciable images regarding the <b>stab</b> direction and the <b>stab</b> depth. We believe that this easy and rapid technique {{can be useful in}} the examination of <b>stab</b> wounds in living and dead victims of sharp trauma...|$|R
40|$|The {{hyaluronic acid}} {{receptor}} for endocytosis Stabilin- 2 /HARE mediates systemic clearance of multiple glycosaminoglycans from the vascular and lymphatic circulations. In addition, recent {{in vitro studies}} indicate that <b>Stab</b> 2 can participate in signal transduction by interacting with hyaluronic acid (HA), which results in Erk phosphorylation. However, {{it is not known}} whether <b>Stab</b> 2 function or HA-Stab 2 signaling play any role in embryonic development. Here we show that <b>Stab</b> 2 functions in a signal transduction pathway regulating arterial-venous differentiation during zebrafish embryogenesis. <b>Stab</b> 2 morpholino knockdown embryos (morphants) display an absence of intersegmental vessels and defects in the axial vessel formation. In addition, <b>Stab</b> 2 morphants show defects in arterial-venous differentiation including the expansion of venous marker expression. Simultaneous knockdown of Stabilin- 2 and Has 2, an HA synthetase, results in a synergistic effect, arguing that HA and <b>Stab</b> 2 interact during vasculature formation. <b>Stab</b> 2 morphants display reduced Erk phosphorylation in the arterial progenitors, which is a known transducer of VEGF signaling, previously associated with arterial-venous differentiation. In addition, VEGF signaling acts as a negative feedback loop to repress <b>stab</b> 2 expression. These results argue that <b>Stab</b> 2 is involved in a novel signaling pathway that {{plays an important role in}} regulating Erk phosphorylation and establishing arterial-venous identity...|$|R

Judicial officers, {{and a federal}} police officer {{who was in the}} court building testifying in an unrelated case, arrived at the scene; however, during the ongoing commotion the police officer mistook Okaz for the attacker and shot him in the upper leg. Wiens collapsed and was apprehended after one of the judges pointed out that not Okaz but Wiens was the assailant. While under arrest, Wiens resisted and begged the police officer to shoot him dead. Okaz, critically wounded in the <b>stabbing</b> attack, was in a coma for two days. He was subsequently treated for several weeks in a hospital near Dresden for the <b>stabbing</b> and shooting injuries.
