50|$|An {{inoculation}} needle is {{an essential}} tool in inoculating a <b>stab</b> culture. A sterile <b>stab</b> culture cap is removed and the open end is flamed.

The inoculation needle is withdrawn from the media in the same direction and path that it was pushed into the <b>stab</b> media to prevent the wobbling effect that may disturbed the culture.

5|$|As {{a sequel}} to , T2 3-D: Battle Across Time {{introduced}} two new Terminator characters. The first is the Cyberdyne's latest invention, the T-1000000. It is a large spider-like version of the T-1000 that defends Skynet's CPU from attack. Like the T-1000, it is made of mimetic polyalloy, allowing it to form its legs into <b>stabbing</b> weapons. The only known T-1000000 was destroyed when Skynet's core was destroyed.|$|E
40|$|The {{radiological}} {{depiction of}} <b>stab</b> wounds in soft-tissues using multislice computed tomography {{is difficult and}} the hereby obtained images often lack contrast. To overcome these shortcomings we tried a new method. We gently instilled the contrast medium Lipiodol((R)) Ultra-fluide into five experimentally induced <b>stab</b> wounds on a pork haunch. Subsequent MSCT reconstructions of the wounds delivered clear, for medical laymen easily appreciable images regarding the <b>stab</b> direction and the <b>stab</b> depth.

40|$|The {{hyaluronic acid}} {{receptor}} for endocytosis Stabilin- 2 /HARE mediates systemic clearance of multiple glycosaminoglycans from the vascular and lymphatic circulations. In addition, recent {{in vitro studies}} indicate that <b>Stab</b> 2 can participate in signal transduction by interacting with hyaluronic acid (HA), which results in Erk phosphorylation. However, {{it is not known}} whether <b>Stab</b> 2 function or HA-Stab 2 signaling play any role in embryonic development. Here we show that <b>Stab</b> 2 functions in a signal transduction pathway regulating arterial-venous differentiation during zebrafish embryogenesis. <b>Stab</b> 2 morpholino knockdown embryos (morphants) display an absence of intersegmental vessels and defects in the axial vessel formation. In addition, <b>Stab</b> 2 morphants show defects in arterial-venous differentiation including the expansion of venous marker expression. Simultaneous knockdown of Stabilin- 2 and Has 2, an HA synthetase, results in a synergistic effect, arguing that HA and <b>Stab</b> 2 interact during vasculature formation. <b>Stab</b> 2 morphants display reduced Erk phosphorylation in the arterial progenitors, which is a known transducer of VEGF signaling, previously associated with arterial-venous differentiation. In addition, VEGF signaling acts as a negative feedback loop to repress <b>stab</b> 2 expression. These results argue that <b>Stab</b> 2 is involved in a novel signaling pathway that {{plays an important role in}} regulating Erk phosphorylation and establishing arterial-venous identity...|$|R
