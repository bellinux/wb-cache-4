40|$|Echinococcus granulosus and Echinococcus multilocularis {{are the two}} {{tapeworm}} species {{responsible for}} the majority of human echinococcosis cases. Infection of this zoonosis can be acquired all over the world by accidental ingestion of eggs. The prevalence of echinococcosis is highest in areas with extensive animal husbandry. Most diagnostic tests for the detection of antibodies against echinococcosis in humans are based on crude or partly purified native antigen extracts. The production of standardized diagnostic-grade native antigen is not possible. Native antigen suffers from batch-to-batch variation depending on purity, origin and developmental stage of the parasite material. In addition, native antigen is limited in availability. Substantial progress in the development of standardized reagents has been achieved by the production of recombinant antigens. Consequent further development of antigens might lead to the production of <b>synthetic</b> <b>antigen.</b> This PhD thesis investigated the applicability of synthetic peptides ranging from 24 to 47 amino acids in length for the use as synthetic antigens in serological diagnosis of cystic and alveolar echinococcosis. A bioinformatic selection procedure was established for identification of potentially antigenic protein sequences. From each of these parent proteins one or several peptides were selected for chemical synthesis. Peptides were designed from predicted domains of alpha-helical coiled-coils and intrinsically unstructured regions. These two motifs are capable of adopting their natural conformation even if synthesized as isolated fragments. The diagnostic performance of a <b>synthetic</b> <b>antigen</b> depends on its ability to fold into its native structure and thus be recognized by antibodies that had been naturally induced in the course of an infection. Peptide candidates were designed from different sets of parent proteins which had been selected by three different approaches: i) a genomics approach, ii) a proteomics approach, and iii) a transcriptomics approach. These three approaches identified 6 promising peptide candidates. The synthetic peptide performing best obtained a sensitivity of 74...|$|E

40|$|SummaryIn {{patients}} with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a single neoplastic antigen-specific B cell accumulates and overgrows other B cells, leading to immune deficiency. CLL is often treated with drugs that ablate all B cells, leading to further weakening of humoral immunity, and a more focused therapeutic strategy capable of targeting only the pathogenic B cells would represent a significant advance. One approach to this would be to develop synthetic surrogates of the CLL antigens allowing differentiation of the CLL cells and healthy B cells in a patient. Here, we describe nonpeptidic molecules capable of targeting antigen-specific B cell receptors with good affinity and selectivity using a combinatorial library screen.

The aim of this work was to determine whether a serological test based on a panel of defined individual trehalose esters of characteristic synthetic mycolic acids has improved diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing patients with culture positive PTB from individuals who were Mtb culture negative. One hundred serum samples from well-characterized patients with presumptive tuberculosis, and diagnosed as having pulmonary smear and culture positive TB, or being culture and smear negative were evaluated by ELISA using different combinations of <b>synthetic</b> <b>antigens</b> and secondary antibodies. Using cut-off values determined from these samples, we validated this study blind in samples from a further 249 presumptive TB patients. With the first 100 samples, detailed responses depended both on the precise structure of the antigen and on the secondary antibody. Using a single antigen, a sensitivity/specificity combination for smear and culture positive PTB detection of 85 and 88 % respectively was achieved; this increased to 96 % and 95 % respectively by a statistical combination of the results with seven antigens.
