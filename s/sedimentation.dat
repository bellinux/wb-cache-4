5|$|The lake {{appears to}} have a higher <b>sedimentation</b> rate than would be {{expected}} in other similar reservoirs, being in the region of 100–150t.km−2.yr−1.|$|E
5|$|Igneous {{activity}} {{associated with}} this stretching occurred from 12million to 4million years ago. <b>Sedimentation</b> is concentrated in valleys (basins) from material eroded from adjacent ranges. The amount of sediment deposited has roughly kept up with this subsidence, resulting in retention of {{more or less the}} same valley floor elevation over time.|$|E
5|$|Many river pools {{which are}} an {{important}} summer refuge and habitat for aquatic and terrestrial flora and fauna have been lost due to <b>sedimentation</b> and modification of the flow regime caused by impoundments in the Canning River.|$|E
5|$|Other imaging methods, such as ultrasonography, {{computed}} tomography (CT), and magnetic imaging (MRI), can aid in diagnosis. Blood tests {{can also help}} identify the presence of infection: the erythrocyte <b>sedimentation</b> rate (ESR), the C-reactive protein (CRP) level, and chlamydial and gonococcal DNA probes.|$|E
5|$|The EPA {{approved}} temperature TMDLs {{for three}} Rogue River tributaries: Upper Sucker Creek in 1999, Lower Sucker Creek in 2002, and Lobster Creek in 2002. It approved temperature, <b>sedimentation,</b> and biological criteria TMDLs for the Applegate River basin in 2004, and temperature, <b>sedimentation,</b> fecal coliform, and Escherichia coli (E. coli) TMDLs for the Bear Creek watershed in 2007. In 1992 it had approved pH, aquatic weeds and algae, and dissolved oxygen TMDLs for the Bear Creek watershed. In December 2008, DEQ developed two TMDLs for the Rogue River basin (except the tributaries {{with their own}} TMDLs); a temperature TMDL was meant to protect salmon and trout from elevated water temperatures, and a fecal contamination TMDL was intended to safeguard people using surface waters for recreation.|$|E
5|$|A major {{contributor}} to the <b>sedimentation</b> of the Little Applegate River is McDonald Ditch, an irrigation ditch near McDonald Creek. Built in 1920 to provide water to residents of nearby Wagner Creek, the ditch has failed numerous times, sending several tons of dirt and mud downstream. The Talent Irrigation District approved purchasing a $10,000 monitoring system for the ditch in September 2010, and applied for a $100,000 United States Bureau of Reclamation grant to replace the ditch with pipes.|$|E
5|$|Early Jurassic uplift {{created an}} {{unconformity}} above the Chinle Formation that represents about ten million years of missing <b>sedimentation</b> {{between it and}} the next formation, the Moenave. Periodic incursions of shallow seas from the north during the Jurassic flooded parts of Wyoming, Montana, and a northeast–southwest trending trough on the Utah/Idaho border. The Moenave was deposited in a variety of river, lake, and flood-plain environments.|$|E
5|$|Preservation of most {{specimens}} {{was made}} possible by the fast <b>sedimentation</b> that quickly cut the organism off from seawater; it may also have been enhanced by the decay products of the rotting organism, which could have helped the overlying sediment to mineralise and harden. It has been suggested that a mucus trail produced by the organism may have assisted its preservation, but experiments suggest that mucus disintegrates too easily {{to play a role in}} binding sediment together.|$|E
5|$|Since its {{completion}} in 1940, the Canning Dam {{has contributed to}} a wide range of environmental and ecological problems in surrounding regions, problems include more common algal blooms, habitat loss and <b>sedimentation.</b> Despite these issues, Canning Dam and the adjacent parks and forests provide a variety of recreational activities for the public such as bushwalking, historic walks and picnic facilities.|$|E
5|$|The Petitcodiac {{river valley}} at Moncton is broad and {{relatively}} flat, bounded {{by a long}} ridge to the north (Lutes Mountain) and by the rugged Caledonia Highlands to the south. Moncton lies at the original head of navigation on the river, however a causeway to Riverview (constructed in 1968) resulted in extensive <b>sedimentation</b> of the river channel downstream and rendered the Moncton area of the waterway unnavigable. On 14 April 2010, the causeway gates were opened {{in an effort to}} restore the silt-laden river.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} {{is based on}} the combination of the symptoms, as very few other diseases cause the same symptoms together. Blood tests may show elevated creatinine and urea levels (in kidney involvement), raised IgA levels (in about 50%), and raised C-reactive protein (CRP) or erythrocyte <b>sedimentation</b> rate (ESR) results; none are specific for Henoch–Schönlein purpura. The platelet count may be raised, and distinguishes it from diseases where low platelets are the cause of the purpura, such as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.|$|E
5|$|The entire works was {{upgraded}} between 1956 and 1969, in five distinct phases. The {{plan was}} announced in January 1956, and was expected to cost £1 million. The first phase was {{the construction of a}} filter pressing plant, for which the main contractor was Norwest Construction Co Ltd, while the actual presses and other plant were supplied by S. H. Johnson and Co Ltd. This phase was completed in 1962, and was officially opened by the Lord Mayor on 14 May 1963. The second phase consisted of a preliminary treatment plant, a storm sewage separation plant, and metering of the flows within the plant. This was completed in 1965. The third phase was split into two parts, which initially involved the building of new primary <b>sedimentation</b> tanks. Once these were operational in 1969, the old <b>sedimentation</b> tanks were converted to become temporary storm sewage tanks. This fourth phase was called phase 3b, and was completed in 1970. The final phase was the construction of a sludge incinerator, which was completed in 1969 and meant that the pressed sewage cake {{did not have to be}} taken to Thrybergh to be dumped.|$|E
5|$|The {{park has}} a diverse and complex {{geologic}} history. Since its formation, {{the area that}} comprises the park has experienced at least four major periods of extensive volcanism, three or four periods of major <b>sedimentation,</b> and several intervals of major tectonic deformation where the crust has been reshaped. Two periods of glaciation (a series of ice ages) have also had effects on the area, although no glaciers ever existed in the ranges now in the park.|$|E
5|$|The {{stone that}} was quarried is arkose of the Famennian stage. Approximately 360 million years ago, {{the thrust of}} forming Gondwana plates raised the seabed. Meanwhile, an ice age {{occurred}} in regions near the poles. Marine regression allowed <b>sedimentation</b> of detrital sand and clays which left large shoals of hard sandstone with ripple marks, alternating with levels more or less shaley according to their clay's content.|$|E
5|$|Two hazards {{are uniquely}} {{identified}} with the dam. One is that <b>sedimentation</b> projections are not agreed upon, {{and the other is}} that the dam sits on a seismic fault. At current levels, 80% of the land in the area is experiencing erosion, depositing about 40million tons of sediment into the Yangtze annually. Because the flow is slower above the dam, much of this sediment will now settle there instead of flowing downstream, and there will be less sediment downstream.|$|E
5|$|Although {{not a true}} coral, Millepora alcicornis {{is subject}} to the same general threats that corals and coral reefs are facing. The {{greatest}} of these is global warming and the consequent rise in sea temperatures. Millepora alcicornis {{is one of the first}} corals to show bleaching as the symbiont zooxanthellae are killed. However, it is also more resilient than most and becomes re-established by recruitment earlier than the scleractinian corals. Other general threats to reefs include ocean acidification, pollution, <b>sedimentation,</b> invasive species and other changes in species dynamics, coral diseases, fisheries, leisure activities and tourism. Small quantities of Millepora alcicornis are gathered for sale to collectors.|$|E
5|$|Coral {{reefs and}} shallow marine environments are threatened, {{not only by}} natural events and {{increased}} sea temperatures, but also by such man-made problems as pollution, <b>sedimentation</b> and destructive fishing practices. Pollution {{may be the result}} of run-off from the land of sewage, agricultural products, fuel or chemicals. These may directly kill or injure marine life, or may encourage the growth of algae that smother native species, or form algal blooms with wide-ranging effects. Oil spills at sea can contaminate reefs, and also affect the eggs and larva of marine life drifting near the surface.|$|E
5|$|For over {{a century}} the water was {{supplied}} untreated. In the 1980s a dam at Westbury allowed selective pumping from the river and some improvement in water quality. As Hagley's water was not fully treated, {{from time to time}} contamination required boil-water notices. <b>Sedimentation</b> damaged hot-water cylinders and restricted supply due to the deposits left in the water delivery system. Work began in 2012 on a $5.5 million water treatment work at Westbury to supply Westbury, Hagley and Exton. This water treatment plant was opened by Ben Lomond Water in June 2013, supplying filtered and treated water to Hagley.|$|E
5|$|Hyperuricemia is {{a classic}} feature of gout, but {{nearly half of the}} time gout occurs without hyperuricemia and most people with raised uric acid levels never develop gout. Thus, the {{diagnostic}} utility of measuring uric acid levels is limited. Hyperuricemia is defined as a plasma urate level greater than 420 μmol/l (7.0mg/dl) in males and 360 μmol/l (6.0mg/dl) in females. Other blood tests commonly performed are white blood cell count, electrolytes, kidney function and erythrocyte <b>sedimentation</b> rate (ESR). However, both the white blood cells and ESR may be elevated due to gout in the absence of infection. A white blood cell count as high as 40.0×109/l (40,000/mm3) has been documented.|$|E
5|$|Other diagnoses {{that are}} {{typically}} considered include fractures, tumors, or systemic disease if plantar fasciitis pain fails to respond appropriately to conservative medical treatments. Bilateral heel pain or heel {{pain in the}} context of a systemic illness may indicate a need for a more in-depth diagnostic investigation. Under these circumstances, diagnostic tests such as a CBC or serological markers of inflammation, infection, or autoimmune disease such as C-reactive protein, erythrocyte <b>sedimentation</b> rate, anti-nuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, HLA-B27, uric acid, or Lyme disease antibodies may also be obtained. Neurological deficits may prompt an investigation with electromyography to evaluate for damage to the nerves or muscles.|$|E
5|$|The Willamette River basin {{was created}} {{primarily}} by plate tectonics and volcanism and was altered by erosion and <b>sedimentation,</b> including some related to enormous glacial floods as recent as 13,000years ago. The initial trough-like configuration was created about 35million {{years ago as}} a forearc basin while the Pacific Plate subducted beneath the North American Plate. Marine deposits on top of older volcanics underlie the valley, which was initially part of the continental shelf, rather than a separate inland sea. About 20 to 16million years ago, uplift formed the Coast Range and separated the basin from the Pacific Ocean.|$|E
5|$|The {{concentration}} of alkalinity in Roaring Creek upstream of Lick Run is 9 milligrams per liter. Many nearby watersheds have been rendered nearly devoid of aquatic life due to acid mine drainage caused by coal mining. However, Roaring Creek {{has not been}} affected by this, {{although it has been}} still impacted by human land use. <b>Sedimentation,</b> siltation, and agricultural impacts occur in the watershed. The only impaired stream in the watershed is a small unnamed tributary that is impaired by siltation. From a chemical standpoint, Roaring Creek is infertile.|$|E
5|$|The geology of the Lassen {{volcanic}} area presents {{a record of}} <b>sedimentation</b> and volcanic activity {{in the area in}} and around Lassen Volcanic National Park in Northern California, U.S. The park is located in the southernmost part of the Cascade Mountain Range in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. Pacific Oceanic tectonic plates have plunged below the North American Plate in this part of North America for hundreds of millions of years. Heat from these subducting plates has fed scores of volcanoes in California, Oregon, Washington and British Columbia over at least the past 30 million years (see Geology of the Pacific Northwest) and is also responsible for activities in the Lassen {{volcanic area}}.|$|E
5|$|The geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area {{includes}} nine known exposed formations, all {{visible in}} Zion National Park in the U.S. state of Utah. Together, these formations represent about 150 million years of mostly Mesozoic-aged <b>sedimentation</b> {{in that part}} of North America. Part of a super-sequence of rock units called the Grand Staircase, the formations exposed in the Zion and Kolob area were deposited in several different environments that range from the warm shallow seas of the Kaibab and Moenkopi formations, streams and lakes of the Chinle, Moenave, and Kayenta formations to the large deserts of the Navajo and Temple Cap formations and dry near shore environments of the Carmel Formation.|$|E
5|$|There is {{significant}} stormwater flow and <b>sedimentation</b> in Mahoning Creek, {{as well as}} agricultural and urban runoff. However, the creek is less environmentally damaged than the nearby Chillisquaque Creek. Mahoning Creek is considered by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection to be impaired downstream of Kase Run, part of which is also impaired. Additionally, the tributary Mauses Creek {{is considered to be}} impaired, as are {{the upper reaches of the}} tributary Sechler Run. The cause of the impairment of Mahoning Creek is siltation and the source is agriculture and urban runoff/storm sewers. Sections of all three of its named tributaries are impaired, with the cause being siltation and the source being agriculture.|$|E
25|$|Erythrocyte <b>sedimentation</b> rate can be measured, with an {{elevated}} <b>sedimentation</b> rate indicating that an inflammatory process is present.|$|E
25|$|Waters {{exiting the}} {{flocculation}} basin may enter the <b>sedimentation</b> basin, also called a clarifier or settling basin. It {{is a large}} tank with low water velocities, allowing floc to settle to the bottom. The <b>sedimentation</b> basin is best located close to the flocculation basin so the transit between the two processes does not permit settlement or floc break up. <b>Sedimentation</b> basins may be rectangular, where water flows from end to end, or circular where flow is from the centre outward. <b>Sedimentation</b> basin outflow is typically over a weir so only a thin top layer of water—that furthest from the sludge—exits.|$|E
25|$|Agriculture {{contributes}} {{greatly to}} soil erosion and sediment deposition through intensive management or inefficient land cover. It {{is estimated that}} agricultural land degradation is leading to an irreversible decline in fertility on about 6 million ha of fertile land each year. The accumulation of sediments (i.e. <b>sedimentation)</b> in runoff water affects water quality in various ways. <b>Sedimentation</b> can decrease the transport capacity of ditches, streams, rivers, and navigation channels. It can also {{limit the amount of}} light penetrating the water, which affects aquatic biota. The resulting turbidity from <b>sedimentation</b> can interfere with feeding habits of fishes, affecting population dynamics. <b>Sedimentation</b> also affects the transport and accumulation of pollutants, including phosphorus and various pesticides.|$|E
25|$|Erythrocyte <b>sedimentation</b> rate {{is usually}} raised.|$|E

25|$|Slump: {{typically}} monoclinal, {{result of}} differential compaction or dissolution during <b>sedimentation</b> and lithification.|$|E
25|$|The above {{approach}} can be performed at many sections containing the PETM. This {{has led to an}} intriguing result. At some locations (mostly deep-marine), <b>sedimentation</b> rates must have decreased across the PETM, presumably because of carbonate dissolution on the seafloor; at other locations (mostly shallow-marine), <b>sedimentation</b> rates must have increased across the PETM, presumably because of enhanced delivery of riverine material during the event.|$|E
25|$|The gel network {{stabilization}} {{represents the}} principal way to produce colloids stable to both aggregation and <b>sedimentation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Dead {{organisms in}} nature are usually quickly removed by scavengers, bacteria, rotting and erosion, but <b>sedimentation</b> can {{contribute}} to exceptional circumstances where these natural processes are unable to work, causing fossilisation. The chance of fossilisation is higher when the <b>sedimentation</b> rate is high (so that a carcass is quickly buried), in anoxic environments (where little bacterial activity occurs) or when the organism had a particularly hard skeleton. Larger, well-preserved fossils are relatively rare.|$|E
25|$|The rate {{at which}} {{sediment}} is deposited differs depending on the location. A channel in a tidal flat can see the deposition of a few metres of sediment in one day, while on the deep ocean floor each year only a few millimetres of sediment accumulate. A distinction can be made between normal <b>sedimentation</b> and <b>sedimentation</b> caused by catastrophic processes. The latter category includes all kinds of sudden exceptional processes like mass movements, rock slides or flooding. Catastrophic processes can see the sudden deposition of {{a large amount of}} sediment at once. In some sedimentary environments, most of the total column of sedimentary rock was formed by catastrophic processes, even though the environment is usually a quiet place. Other sedimentary environments are dominated by normal, ongoing <b>sedimentation.</b>|$|E
