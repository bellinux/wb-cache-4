6000|$|... "Think? Can you not see? If Pontiac {{will only}} turn the youth <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> tender mercies, we shall hold {{all of the}} Morrises in our power." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, he's a-doin' tolerable. I {{took him}} <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> Uncle Joe's, you know, {{and the women}} folks over there will give him the best o' care." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{telegram}} for Mr. David Porter!" [...] {{called out}} one of the hotel boys, just after the lads had finished eating; and he passed the communication <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> hero.|$|R
60|$|The rebel pickets are {{reported}} as calling <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> pickets today {{that we had}} taken some rebel fort. This is not very intelligible, and I think is entirely unreliable.|$|R
60|$|The next day, {{at about}} eleven o'clock, the Sand Lady and the Shell Man walked <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> little bay, {{where they found}} Walkirk and me fencing upon the level beach.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Mrs. Sloane, won't {{you come}} <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> house at once?" [...] he gasped. [...] "The baby, he's got colic, and ma's just wild, and he's all {{black in the}} face." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Of Bombardaro, {{where my}} liege, his present Majesty, would have {{performed}} prodigies of velour, {{but that the}} whole of his uncle's army came <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> side, {{with the exception of}} Prince Bulbo.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish {{we could}} win Captain Langless <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> side," [...] put in Sam suddenly, struck by the idea. [...] "Do you suppose {{it could be done}} if we paid him well?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "--Of Bombardaro, {{where my}} liege, his present Majesty, would have {{performed}} prodigies of valor, {{but that the}} whole of his uncle's army came <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> side, {{with the exception of}} Prince Bulbo--" ...|$|R
60|$|The town of Ahmedabad was <b>to</b> {{be handed}} <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> ally, Futteh Sing; but it {{declined}} to surrender, {{and was taken}} by assault, the storming party being commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Hartley.|$|R
6000|$|... "Julian Orden," [...] Fenn replied, [...] "has {{been handed}} <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> secret service by the {{unanimous}} {{vote of the}} Council. We have absolute liberty {{to deal with him}} as we think fit." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Shall I go up with you, Charlie, or {{will you}} go alone?" [...] Harry asked. [...] "Of course, there are some horses here, and you could lend me one <b>to</b> drive <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> own place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He comes {{every day}} to Theos to send off his cables," [...] Domiloff answered. [...] "I shall send you word where he is, and you must send for him. It is {{absolutely}} necessary that he come <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> side." ...|$|R
60|$|Believe me, {{we are not}} {{so black}} as we're painted. There are two sides to this question. Like you, we do <b>our</b> best <b>to</b> do what is right. And we hope, we still hope, <b>to</b> win you <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> side.|$|R
6000|$|... "You can go <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> cottage, if you wish. Mother is at home, and {{she will}} willingly let you dry {{yourself}} at the kitchen fire. I would lend you one of my suits, but I imagine it wouldn't be large enough." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Our lofty {{standard}} {{will proceed}} to your lands and, just as {{occurred in the}} time of Agha Mohammed Khan, so now you will be subjected to doubly increased devastation, and Georgia will again be annihilated, and the Georgian people given <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> wrath." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So you shall, Dan; but I'd rather you wouldn't {{come with}} me now, 'cause there was nothin' said about my bringin' anybody. Keep on with Bill an' Jip, an' I'll go <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> room jest as soon as I get through at the engine-house." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} badly mistaken," [...] Dick {{admitted}} with a smile. [...] "Still, I {{know the people}} I'm going to like. How is it I haven't seen you about? We're not very far off {{and most of the}} people in the neighborhood have driven <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> camp." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, no, not exactly," [...] {{says the}} fat man, [...] "not when it comes. I turned that matter <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> second vice-president. I was anxious after Brother Jackson's safetiness. I reckon he'll be along right soon. What does that lobster salad you {{mentioned}} taste like, Brother Jackson?" ...|$|R
5000|$|A more {{contemporary}} {{example of the}} Neanderthal as subject is Robert J. Sawyer's trilogy “The Neanderthal Parallax” - here “scientists from an alternative earth in which Neanderthals superseded homo sapiens cross <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> world. The series as a whole allows Sawyer to explore questions of evolution and humanity’s relationship to the environment.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are a {{servitor}} of Castile, Señor Colon, though {{little is}} attempted for even this kingdom, without the approbation and {{consent of the}} King of Aragon.

40|$|While {{eating dinner}} at the Indianapolis Athletic Club the other evening we noticed an old gentleman dining alone next to us. His {{loneliness}} was so apparent that we invited him <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> table. We were quite {{surprised to find that}} we had a celebrity in our midst when he joined us. The old gentleman was Meredith Nicholson, American essayist and novelist...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I admire your taste, sir,' says Mr. Chestle. 'It does you credit. I {{suppose you}} don't take much {{interest}} in hops; but I am a pretty large grower myself; and if you ever like <b>to</b> come <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> neighbourhood--neighbourhood of Ashford--and take a run about our place,--we shall be glad for you to stop {{as long as you}} like.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, Mrs. Jones," [...] he said. [...] "I {{have entered}} {{your name and}} address, and I hope we shall see you again soon.

6000|$|... "Well spoken, Rupert," [...] Sir John said. [...] "Now we {{have kept}} you {{talking in the}} sun an unconscionable time; come <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> tent, and have {{something}} to wash the dust away.

6000|$|... "For {{the moment}} I do not know," [...] Sir Denis confessed. [...] "Advise me, all of you. I {{undertook}} this enterprise {{partly because of}} its danger, partly for a great sum of money which I should have handed <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> cause, partly because if I succeeded it would hurt England. Now I have come back and I find you all moved by a different spirit." ...|$|R
60|$|Setting spurs to Covenant I rode <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> companions and {{delivered}} the message. Sir Stephen, {{who had been}} struck by a petronel bullet, and wore a crimsoned kerchief bound round his snow-white head, saw {{the wisdom of the}} advice, and moved his townsmen as directed. His musqueteers being better provided with powder than ours did good service by keeping down for a time the deadly fire from across the fosse.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is, {{that you}} will do me and Mrs Brook the {{pleasure}} of coming <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> location this afternoon to dinner. It is our Gertie's birthday. She is thirteen to-day. In a rash moment we promised her a treat or surprise of some sort, but really the only surprise I can think of in such an out-of-the-way place {{is to have a}} dinner-party in her honour. Will you come?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Amicia. Fortunately: {{think what}} some of them might be! Though Florentia saw nothing I saw many things in this poor little shabby [...] "Due d'Enghien," [...] coming <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> roaring London, where the dots {{have to be so}} big on the i's, with its barely audible note of originality. It appealed to me, touched me, offered me a poignant {{suggestion}} of the way things happen in life.|$|R
5000|$|The cover art to {{the single}} came {{courtesy}} of Michael Stipe. [...] "Michael brought those negatives <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> place," [...] explains photographer Terry Allen. [...] "He said, 'Can you make a print of these?' and we said, 'What, you want a picture of this blur?'

6000|$|... "Yes, Allah destroy them! They are. They've come <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> side. After {{centuries of}} {{fighting}} {{they refuse to}} play fair any longer. They're on our side! Who ever {{heard of such a}} thing? Bah! But, of course," [...] he added more quietly, [...] "we shall massacre them just the same. We shall insist, in the terms of peace, on retaining our rights of massacre. But then, no doubt, all the nations will." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon," [...] said Mrs. Woods, with a smile. [...] "I forgot it's a {{profound}} secret until then. But {{here we are}} at the house; I see the girls have walked <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> neighbors'. Perhaps you {{would like to have a}} few moments to yourself before you dress for dinner, and your portmanteau, which has been sent for, comes from your hotel. You must be tired of seeing so many people." ...|$|R

The support we received from our local and global community blew us away! We’re so happy to have met and worked with all the beautiful hearts during the S4C Shop’s 5 months in Toronto." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{shall have}} both, my dear boy. We had all given {{you up for}} dead. When we saw you washed down, we were afraid that you were lost. The only hope was that the current might bring you <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> side again, and we went two or three miles down the stream to look for you. We hunted again still more {{carefully}} the next morning, {{and it was not}} until the afternoon that we moved.|$|R
5000|$|Baddour came <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> house... The {{university}} {{offered me}} salary {{equal to the}} basketball head coach's, but Baddour {{made it clear that}} it would create a real hardship on the department if I took it. He also said, [...] "If you want football to be equal to basketball, you should go to Texas." ... Baddour told us the chancellor had said to offer a ten-year contract.... He did add that he didn't feel the Board of Trustees would approve the long-term deal.|$|R
