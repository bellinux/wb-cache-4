40|$|Abstract- Weather {{modification}} activities {{began in}} Western Kansas in 1972 and several cloud seeding operations were conducted from 1972 through 1978. The centerpiece of weather modification activities in Kansas {{is represented by}} the Western Kansas Weather Modification Program that has operated from 1975 to the present time under the leadership of the Western Kansas Groundwater Management District No. 1. The primary objective of the Program has been to reduce hail damage, although a significant effort has also been made to increase precipitation. The Program has been evaluated on several previous occasions by various entities. However, the previous evaluation methodology and/or results have been viewed as somewhat inconclusive by the Kansas Water Office. The precipitation component as per the recent evaluation by the Kansas Water Office showed that precipitation declined by 0. 25 inches in the target area from the pre-cloud seeding time period of 1941 to 1970 to the cloud seeding time period of 1979 - 1993. This amount of change in rainfall is well within normal precipitation variation and was determined to be of no practical economic significance. In contrast, the Kansas Water Office evaluation of the hail <b>suppression</b> <b>component</b> of the Program was very positive. The estimated percentage decrease in hail damage to crops in the target area was 27 percent, and resulted in an estimated benefit of approximately $ 60, 000, 000 to the six county target area for the 1979 - 1993 time period or $ 4, 000, 000 per year, after the expenses to operate the Program have been deducted.

40|$|Abstract- The {{insertion}} loss (IL) {{is regarded as}} the best interference suppression characteristic of power filters or <b>suppression</b> <b>components.</b> The IL definitions are considered and as an alternative the paper suggests the use of network parameters. It is a known fact that the standard IL measurements do not provide reliable information about the operational performance of a suppressor. This is largely due to the source and load mismatch, which is typical in power lines. Arguments are presented, showing that network parameters allow for more complete and reliable characterization of power filters and components. The IL would not be abandoned, because the network parameters provide enough information to obtain not only the standard IL, but also the IL in a non 50 Ω system. A new treatment of “worst case ” or minimum IL is proposed, which is also based on network parameters. Furthermore, input, output, or transfer impedances, simulation models, and other characteristics, can be obtained from the network parameters, but not from the currently published standard IL data...|$|R

We investigated the test-retest reliabilities and heritabilities of three ERP components in healthy monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs. METHODS: ERP components (P 300, P 50 and MMN) were recorded using a 19 -channel electroencephalogram (EEG) in 40 healthy monozygotic twin pairs, 19 of them on two separate occasions, and 30 dizygotic twin pairs. Zygosity was determined using DNA genotyping. RESULTS: High reliabilities were found for the P 300 amplitude and its latency, MMN amplitude, and P 50 <b>suppression</b> ratio <b>components.</b> ICC= 0. 86 and 0. 88 for the P 300 amplitude and P 300 latency respectively. Reliability of MMN peak amplitude and mean amplitude were 0. 67 and 0. 66 respectively. P 50 T/C ratio reliability was 0. 66. Model fitting analyses indicated a substantial heritability or familial component of variance for these ERP measures. Heritability estimates were 63 and 68 % for MMN peak amplitude and mean amplitude respectively. For P 50 T/C ratio, 68 % heritability was estimated. P 300 amplitude heritability was estimated at 69 %, and while a significant familiality effect was found for P 300 latency there was insufficient power to distinguish between shared environment and genetic factors. CONCLUSIONS: The high reliability and heritability of the P 300 amplitude, MMN amplitude, and P 50 <b>suppression</b> ratio <b>components</b> supports their use as candidate endophenotypes for psychiatric research. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBinocular rivalry {{is thought}} to arise from a {{low-level}} cortical site. Experiment 1 evaluates this claim with respect to local and global motion processing by using a multiple-aperture motion stimulus and measuring the predominance of global coherence while one of the component gratings is engaged in rivalry. Results show that rivalry <b>suppression</b> of the <b>component</b> grating precludes global coherence. Presumably, <b>suppression</b> prevents the <b>component</b> motion signal from advancing to higher-level global motion areas, suggesting rivalry occurs between local and global motion processing. However, feedback from higher-level mechanisms might exert an influence on binocular rivalry and thus Experiment 2 measures how the predominance of a local target engaged in binocular rivalry with a competing local stimulus is affected when the target forms part of a globally coherent motion stimulus. The augmented level of target predominance during global motion relative to local motion indicates that higher-level motion mechanisms can feedback and influence the binocular rivalry process. Together, these data imply a looping hierarchy of motion processing stages, with rivalry suppression transpiring at an intermediate level and subject to feedback from higher-level motion areas...|$|R

Among the many implementation challenges, the problem of "double talk" {{is considered one of}} the toughest. When near-end speech and the acoustic echo of the far-end speech are simultaneously present in the microphone signal, it is very difficult to separate these two components and provide satisfactory echo attenuation. After providing a thorough overview of the application and the major adaptive filtering algorithms used in {{echo cancellation}}, this thesis presents an in-depth study of the published techniques for dealing with double talk. We classify these existing approaches according to their underlying methodology, such as signal level comparison, signal correlation, weight progression monitoring, and dual filter architecture. The strengths and weaknesses of a number of representative algorithms are discussed in some detail. We argue that detection of echo path changes yields a more robust echo canceller than direct double talk detection. The major contribution of this thesis is the development of a novel variable step size approach that uses a measure of the correlation between successive gradient estimates to control the system's adaptation rate. Two main algorithms, denoted GC-VSS 3 and PC-VSS, are derived by applying this approach to the Least Mean Squares and Affine Projection algorithms, respectively. We demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithms in a double talk environment. This is done through a series of simulation experiments using white noise, coloured noise, and recorded speech as the input signals. We also show how an auxiliary double talk detector, based on the proposed variable step size technique, may be employed to control the peripheral echo <b>suppression</b> <b>components</b> that are usually required in a hands-free telephone set. Finally, computational complexity is analyzed and shown to be reasonable for practical implementation when certain beneficial properties of the adaptive filter structure are exploited...|$|R

Previous studies in ovarian cancer have {{demonstrated}} that decreased expression and function of the T-cell receptor (TcR) -associated signal transducing zeta-chain correlates with deficient immune responsiveness of T cells. In this study, sera and ascitic fluids obtained from woman with advanced ovarian cancer were found to suppress the expression of TcR-associated zeta chain. This suppression of zeta chain expression was dose-dependent and was not observed with biologic fluids obtained from healthy women. The factor responsible for the loss of zeta chain was purified from ascites and characterized as a protein with an appropriate molecular weight of 14 kD. Suppression of T-cell TcR-zeta was specific, since neither lck nor ZAP- 70 expression was affected, while zeta chain was almost completely suppressed. This selective suppression of TcR-zeta expression by the 14 kD ascites-derived factor was shown to operate at the mRNA level. By defining the mechanism through which this protein modulates TcR-zeta chain levels, {{it might be possible to}} ultimately prevent the suppressive influences of the tumour microenvironment and restor immune competence in patients with ovarian carcinoma...|$|R

The two models fail to address these concerns. This dissertation focused on message propagation in Zimbabwe because there is military belligerence involved in the information warfare.
