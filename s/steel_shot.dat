500|$|The {{official}} {{weight of the}} shot was listed at 68lbs but in reality this varied according to the material of the shot itself; cast iron shot weighed , wrought iron shot and <b>steel</b> <b>shot</b> weighed , and chilled steel weighed [...] [...] It was estimated that one 68-pound shot had the destructive power equivalent to five 32-pound shot. The explosive shells were primed with [...] of gunpowder. They were fitted with simple fuses that were ignited by the flash of the charge – early wooden fuses were eventually replaced by more reliable fuses designed by Captain Edward Boxer in 1849. The gun crew still had to gauge the best length of fuse for the range they were firing – ideally the shell should explode just before hitting its target. To prevent the shell exploding in the barrel it was fitted with a sabot to ensure the fuse faced away from the charge.|$|E
500|$|After Palestro withdrew, the Austrian ironclads {{turned their}} {{attention}} to the ships of Riboty's division. By this time, Re d'Italia had been rammed and sunk, and Palestro was burning furiously. Persano broke off the engagement to consolidate his forces, but his ships, low on coal and ammunition, and with badly demoralized crews, could not be rallied by Persano's half-hearted attempt to launch an attack. The Italian fleet began to withdraw, followed by the Austrians; as night began to fall, the opposing fleets disengaged completely, heading for Ancona and Pola, respectively. Regina Maria Pia had had one iron plate destroyed, and another had a <b>steel</b> <b>shot</b> lodged in it. She had been badly burned, and the flames had nearly reached her powder magazine.

2500|$|Shotshell presses {{typically}} use {{a charge}} bar to drop precise amounts of shot and powder. [...] Most commonly, these charge bars are fixed in their capacities, {{with a single}} charge bar rated at, say, 1-1/8 oz. of lead shot, with a switchable powder bushing that permits dropping precisely measured fixed amounts {{of different types of}} powder repetitively (e.g., MEC.) [...] On the other hand, some charge bars are drilled to accept bushings for dropping different fixed amounts of both shot and powder (e.g. Texan.) [...] For the ultimate in flexibility, though, universal charge bars with micrometers dropping fixed volumes of powder and shot are also available; these are able to select differing fixed amounts of both powder and shot, and are popular for handloaders who load more than just a few published recipes, or, especially, among those who wish to experiment with numerous different published recipes. [...] Fixed charge bars are rated for either lead or <b>steel</b> <b>shot,</b> but not for both.

40|$|Presented {{as part of}} Special Symposium SA 2 - In-situ Risk Reduction of Metal-Contaminated SoilsCyclonic ashes, {{consisting}} of modified aluminosilicates, were compared to other soil additives used for in-situ remediation of metal-contaminated soils. The effectiveness to reduce bioavailability of metals was evaluated in a pot experiment. The additives cyclonic ashes with or without <b>steel</b> <b>shots,</b> lime, phosphate rock and red mud were added to control soil and to four Zn-, Cd- and Pb-contaminated soils. Three of these soils were from an industrial site and one was a garden soil. Lettuce and ryegrass were grown on the treated soils. These plants could not grow on the untreated industrial soils from Maatheide and Joplin. This was also found when phosphate rock and red mud were added. The lime and cyclonic ash (± <b>steel</b> <b>shots)</b> treatments were most efficient in promoting plant growth and reducing Zn and Cd concentration in pore water of the different soils. When detectable, also Pb decreased but less spectacularly. In the plants, only accumulation of Zn was systematically lower when these soil additives were applied. Cd was reduced {{in a few cases}} and to a lower extent. Pb in leaves was often higher in the treated soils, in particular with lime additions. The treatments with cyclonic ashes were slightly better than the lime treatments in the Joplin soil and addition of <b>steels</b> <b>shots</b> seemed to reduce Pb transfer into shoots. Also column percolation experiments and long-term results (12 years) of application of cyclonic ashes in the field will be discussed.

40|$|Phytoremediation is a {{promising}} and cost-effective strategy to manage heavy metal polluted sites. In this experiment, we compare phytoextraction and phytostabilisation technologies on a soil contaminated by Cd and Zn fallouts {{from a former}} Zn smelter. 	Lolium perenne plants were cultivated for 2 months under controlled conditions in a 27. 6 dm³-pot experiment filled with the contaminated soil. A leachate tank below the soil compartment allowed the collect of leachates. The heavy metals phytoextraction was promoted by adding Na-EDTA (0. 5 g. kg- 1) in watering solution 4 days after germination. Phytostabilisation was assessed by mixing soil with <b>steel</b> <b>shots</b> (1 %) before Lolium perenne sowing. Plants, soils and leachates were regularly monitored during 2 months for plant growth, leachate volume, elemental concentrations (Ca, Cd, Fe, K, Mg, Na and Zn), pH and electrical conductivity. 	Shoot biomass was low, because of high heavy metal toxicity. Presence of plants exacerbated heavy metal leaching, by improving soil hydraulic conductivity. Use of EDTA for phytoextraction increased heavy metal mobility in soil, leading to higher concentration of heavy metal in shoots. Moreover, biomass production was also increased despite higher Cd and Zn concentration in shoots, because EDTA was able to reduce metal toxicity in plant tissues. However, this higher heavy metal extraction was insufficient to significantly reduce the heavy metal content in soil, and did not justify the important leaching induced by EDTA. 	On the other hand, addition of <b>steel</b> <b>shots</b> decreased efficiently both CaCl 2 (0. 01 M) extraction of Cd and Zn, and therefore heavy metal mobility in soil, and their leaching. This input improved also shoot biomass production. However, improvement of growth conditions by <b>steel</b> <b>shots</b> led to higher heavy metal mass in shoot tissues. Therefore, soil heavy metal mobility and plant uptake are not always linked, as reduction of metal mobility enhanced plant metal uptake in our experiment...|$|R

2500|$|Stone (usually granite) countertops and {{bathroom}} vanities both involve a finished slab of stone, usually polished but sometimes with another finish (such as honed or sandblasted). Industry standard thicknesses in the United States are 3/4" [...] (2cm) and 1.25" [...] (3cm). Often 2cm slabs will be laminated {{at the edge}} to create {{the appearance of a}} thicker edge profile. The slabs are cut to fit the top of the kitchen or bathroom cabinet, by measuring, templating or digital templating. Countertop slabs are commonly sawn from rough blocks of stone by reciprocating gangsaws using <b>steel</b> <b>shot</b> as abrasive. More modern technology utilizes diamond wire saws which use less water and energy. Multi-wire saws with as many as 60 wires can slab a block in less than two hours. The slabs are finished (i.e., polished, honed), then sealed with resin to fill micro-fissures and surface imperfections typically due to the loss of poorly bonded elements such as biotite. The fabricators shop cuts these slabs down to final size and finishes the edges with equipment such as hand-held routers, grinders, CNC equipment, or polishers. In 2008, concerns were raised regarding radon emissions from granite countertops; the National Safety Council states that the contributions of radon to inside air come from the soil and rock around the residence (69%), the outdoor air and the water supply (28%), and only 2.5% from all building materials-including granite countertops. [...] A concerned homeowner can employ ASTM radon mitigation and removal techniques. [...] The stone for countertops or vanities is usually granite, but often is marble (especially for vanity tops), and is sometimes limestone or slate. The majority of the stone for this application is produced in Brazil, Italy, and China.|$|E
2500|$|Rifle and pistol {{reloading}} presses {{are usually}} not dedicated to reloading a single caliber of cartridge, although they can be, but are configured for reloading various cartridge calibers as needed. [...] In contrast, shotshell presses are most often configured for reloading just one gauge of shotshell, e.g., 12 gauge, and are rarely, if ever, reconfigured for reloading other gauges of shotshells, {{as the cost of}} buying all new dies, shot bar, and powder bushing as required to switch gauges on a shotshell press often exceeds the cost of buying a new shotshell press outright, as shotshell presses typically come from the factory already set up to reload one gauge or bore of shotshell. [...] Hence, it is common to use a dedicated shotshell press for reloading each gauge or bore of shotshell used. Likewise, the price of shot for reloading shotshells {{over the last several years}} has also risen by over an order of magnitude, such that lead shot that was readily available for around $0.50/lb. (c. 2005) now reaches $2.00 per pound (2013.) Due to this large increase in the price of lead shot, the economy of reloading 12 gauge shotshells vs. just using promotional (low-cost) 12 gauge shotshells only starts to make economic sense for higher volume shooters, who may shoot more than 50,000 rounds a year. [...] In contrast, the reloading of shotshells that {{are usually not}} available in low-cost, promotional pricings, such as [...]410 bore, 12 ga. slugs, 16 ga, 20 ga., and 28 ga., becomes more economical to reload in much smaller quantities, perhaps within only 3-5 boxes of shells per year. Reloading [...]410 bore, 12 ga. slugs, 16 ga., 20 ga, and 28 ga. shells therefore remains relatively common, more so than the reloading of 12 gauge shotshells, for which promotional shotshells are usually readily available from many retailers. [...] These smaller bore and gauge shotshells also require much less lead shot, further lessening the effect of the rapid rises seen in the price of lead shot. [...] The industry change to <b>steel</b> <b>shot,</b> arising from the US and Canadian Federal bans on using lead shotshells while hunting migratory wildfowl, has also affected reloading shotshells, as the shot bar and powder bushing required on a dedicated shotshell press also must be changed for each hull type reloaded, and are different than what would be used for reloading shotshells with lead shot, further complicating the reloading of shotshells.|$|E

40|$|A {{combination}} of metal immobilising agents and metal tolerant plants has been utilised {{in order to}} reduce the environmental impact of the acidic metal contaminated Jales mine spoil tips. The addition of Beringite (a modified aluminosilicate), <b>steel</b> <b>shots</b> (iron bearing material) and organic matter as spoil amendments resulted in changes in arsenate (As) concentrations and pH of spoil material and improved plant growth. The application of Beringite increased both pH and plant available As concentrations. A 4 -year follow up of the spoil analysis demonstrated that the effect of the spoil treatments was stable following treatments, however, the effectiveness did not increase any more after 2 years. The use of metal tolerant grasses in combination with spoil treatments resulted in a rapid and effective revegetation of the As contaminated Jales mine spoils. Colonisation and reproduction of Agrostis castellana and Holcus lanatus was most successful when the substrate contained a {{combination of}} all three additives. Plant performances could be enhanced by supplementation of a phosphate fertiliser. The rapid reproduction of the two grass species makes them very suitable for revegetation purposes. Agrostis castellana and Holcus lanatus apparently exhibited a level of metal- and As-tolerance sufficient for survival on untreated spoil, but in the first stages of revegetation the use of spoil amendments was found to be essential. Organic matter in combination with Beringite and/or <b>steel</b> <b>shots</b> resulted in decreased As in the aboveground biomass, protecting possible grazers and predators from undesirable levels of As. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.

Whereas changing orientation fields do not produce any positive effect, steady fields provide peculiar and interesting properties to the media through the drawing of state diagrams. Thus Magnetic Stabilized Fluidized Bed (MSFB) can be obtained and the stabilization zone is increased by a factor 6 when ferromagnetic mass fraction goes from 10 to 75 %. Such stabilizing effects improve bed performances of some applications, such as electrochemical cementation. Besides typical remanant porosity effects are highlighted...|$|R
