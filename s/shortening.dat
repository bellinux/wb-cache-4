5|$|After {{the initial}} {{sequence}} of rocks has been deposited, the rock units can be deformed and/or metamorphosed.

5|$|In {{terms of}} rhythm, English is {{generally}} {{described as a}} stress-timed language, meaning {{that the amount of}} time between stressed syllables tends to be equal. Stressed syllables are pronounced longer, but unstressed syllables (syllables between stresses) are shortened. Vowels in unstressed syllables are shortened as well, and vowel <b>shortening</b> causes changes in vowel quality: vowel reduction.|$|E

5|$|A line of rats with {{hereditary}} kidney cancer {{were developed}} by Japanese researchers. They have a mutation in the FLCN homolog that produces a truncated protein, though they do not develop the cutaneous or pulmonary symptoms seen in humans. Heterozygotes have renal abnormalities seen very early in life that develop into clear cell and hybrid tumors, significantly <b>shortening</b> the animals' lifespan; they also are prone to endometrial and salivary gland clear cell hyperplasia as well as rhabdomyolysis. Homozygotes do not survive to birth. When a wild-type FLCN gene was added, the phenotype was rescued.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Shorten</b> (SHN) is a {{file format}} used for {{compressing}} audio data.

However, <b>Shorten</b> is still in use by some people because there are legally traded concert recordings in circulation that are encoded as <b>Shorten</b> files. <b>Shorten</b> files use the [...]shn file extension.|$|R
5|$|Born in Anillaco, Menem {{became a}} Peronist {{during a visit}} to Buenos Aires. He led the party in his home {{province}} of La Rioja, and was elected governor in 1973.

He defeated the Buenos Aires governor Antonio Cafiero in the primary elections for the 1989 presidential elections, which he won. Hyperinflation forced outgoing president Raúl Alfonsín to resign early, <b>shortening</b> the presidential transition.|$|E
5|$|Carnotaurus {{is one of}} the best-understood genera of the Abelisauridae, {{a family}} of large theropods {{restricted}} to the ancient southern supercontinent Gondwana. Abelisaurids were the dominant predators in the Late Cretaceous of Gondwana, replacing the carcharodontosaurids and occupying the ecological niche filled by the tyrannosaurids in the northern continents. Several notable traits that evolved within this family, including <b>shortening</b> of the skull and arms as well as peculiarities in the cervical and caudal vertebrae, were more pronounced in Carnotaurus than in any other abelisaurid.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Shorten</b> {{began his}} career as a writer with the pulp {{magazine}} publisher Columbia Publications (co-owned by Silberkleit) before moving on to MLJ Comics (later known as Archie Comic Publications). As a writer, <b>Shorten</b> co-created a number of superheroes for MLJ's imprint Dark Circle Comics. In January 1940, with artist Irv Novick, <b>Shorten</b> created the Shield, the first USA patriotic comic book hero. That same year, <b>Shorten</b> also co-created with artist Bob Wood The Firefly. The Black Hood, another 1940 <b>Shorten</b> creation, became a popular character and in 1943 was given his own title, Black Hood Comics. <b>Shorten</b> occasionally used the MLJ house pen name [...] "Cliff Campbell" [...] for his comics writing, but didn't do much writing for MLJ after 1941 because of his editorial duties.|$|R

5|$|In mathematics, the curve-shortening flow is {{a process}} that modifies a smooth curve in the Euclidean plane by moving its points perpendicularly to the curve at a speed {{proportional}} to the curvature. The curve-shortening flow {{is an example of a}} geometric flow, and is the one-dimensional case of the mean curvature flow. Other names for the same process include the Euclidean <b>shortening</b> flow, geometric heat flow, and arc length evolution.|$|E
5|$|Iran {{lies within}} the complex zone of {{collision}} between the Arabian Plate and the Eurasian Plate; near Qeshm {{the rate of}} convergence is about 25 millimeters annually. Part of this convergence is accommodated by <b>shortening</b> within the Zagros fold and thrust belt, with the remainder occurring {{to the north of}} the Iranian Plateau. The most active part of the Zagros is the 'Simply Folded Belt', which is characterised by large folds formed above a layer of late Neoproterozoic to Early Cambrian Hormuz salt, which locally reaches the surface in the crests of some anticlines as salt diapirs. The sedimentary rocks above the salt layer comprise a basal Cambrian conglomerate and a thick sequence of limestones of Palaeozoic to Upper Cretaceous age, known together as the 'Competent Group' due to their relatively high competence, followed by a sequence of mechanically weaker marls and interbedded limestones of latest Cretaceous to Lower Miocene age topped by Neogene sandstones and conglomerates. There is evidence of intermediate level detachment at some of the weaker layers, leading to folds at different stratigraphic levels have different locations, orientations or wavelengths. Earthquake focal mechanisms and hypocentral depths show that <b>shortening</b> is accommodated by a mixture of high-angle and low-angle reverse faulting, within either the lowest part of the sedimentary cover or in the basement beneath the Hormuz salt.|$|E
5|$|M-34 was {{designated}} and {{signed with the}} beginning of the state highway system around July1, 1919, along a route that extended to either end of its current routing. These western and eastern extensions were added to other highways during the 1920s, <b>shortening</b> M-34 to roughly its current length. A few more changes were made in the mid-1950s and 1960s resulting in the modern routing. M-34 has a short, unsigned sibling, Connector 34, which is better known as Industrial Drive in the Adrian area.|$|E
