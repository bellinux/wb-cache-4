5|$|Birnholz was {{followed}} by Eric Gurvis, Steven Engel, and Jim Egolf, all of whom, like Nussbaum before them, also served as the rabbis of Temple Beth El in Lexington, Mississippi, leading services there once a month on <b>Sunday.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> end of the 20th century, Beth Israel was {{the largest of the}} fourteen synagogues in Mississippi, with 213 members.|$|E
5|$|Several of the {{services}} featured in the film were one-off events. For example, the wedding was shot at Lyng, where the bride's father was the rector. The bridegroom, Nigel McCulloch, {{went on to become}} the Bishop of Manchester. The production encountered difficulties with obtaining some footage; while filming a Seaman's Mission from Great Yarmouth, a wave flooded the boat, ruining the sound-recording equipment, and a sequence featuring an open-air service taking place at daybreak on Easter <b>Sunday</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> most easterly point of the UK — at Ness Point, Lowestoft — was nearly missed after the sound recordist overslept.|$|E
5|$|With {{the release}} in the United States and Canada on May 3, 2002 on 7,500 screens at 3,615 theaters, the film earned $39,406,872 on its opening day, {{averaging}} $10,901 per theater. This {{was the highest}} opening day at the time until it was surpassed by its sequel Spider-Man 2s $40.4 million haul in 2004. Spider-Man also set an all-time record for the highest earnings {{in a single day}} with $43,622,264 on its second day of release, a record later surpassed by Shrek 2 in 2004. On the Sunday during its opening weekend, the film earned an additional $31,814,980, the highest gross a film took in on a <b>Sunday,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time.|$|E

25|$|Finally, in late June 1961 {{the trio}} {{recorded}} two albums, <b>Sunday</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Village Vanguard, and Waltz for Debby. These albums were live recordings {{from the same}} live date, and are often named among the best ever jazz recordings. Evans later showed special satisfaction with these recordings, seeing them as {{the culmination of the}} musical interplay of his trio.|$|E
25|$|In late 1959, Evans {{left the}} Miles Davis band and {{began his career}} as a leader, with bassist Scott LaFaro and drummer Paul Motian, a group now {{regarded}} as a seminal modern jazz trio. In 1961, ten days after recording the highly acclaimed <b>Sunday</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Village Vanguard and Waltz for Debby albums, LaFaro died in a car accident. After months of seclusion, Evans re-emerged with a new trio, featuring bassist Chuck Israels.|$|E

25|$|The {{conclave}} {{began in}} the Vatican on 21 April, Easter <b>Sunday.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> opening ceremonies, out of sixty living cardinals thirty-nine were in attendance. Three more arrived later, in time to cast a vote: Andreas of Austria, Ludovico Madruzzo of Trent, and Guido Luca Ferrero of Vercelli. Two factions quickly formed. The first was led by Cardinal Ferdinando de' Medici and the second by Luigi d'Este (grandson of King Louis XII of France). They were willing to combine to make a pope, but it depended on whether they could agree on a common candidate.|$|E
25|$|However, later {{commentators}} {{cast doubt}} as to this explanation {{of the events of}} Sunday, 11 January as fighting continued on <b>Sunday</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Ohaeawai. Another explanation provided by later commentators is that Heke deliberately abandoned the pā to lay a trap in the surrounding bush as this would provide cover and give Heke a considerable advantage. If this is the correct explanation, then the Heke's ambush was only partially successful, as Kawiti's men, fearing their chief had fallen, returned towards the pā and the British forces engaged in battle with the Māori rebels immediately behind the pā.|$|E
25|$|The tournament {{traditionally}} {{took place}} over two weeks in late June and early July, starting on the third Monday in June and culminating with the Ladies' and Gentlemen's Singles Finals, scheduled for the Saturday and <b>Sunday</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{end of the second}} week. However recent changes to the tennis calendar have seen the event moved back by two weeks cumulatively to begin in early July. Five major events are held each year, with additional junior and invitational competitions also taking place. Wimbledon traditions include a strict dress code for competitors and Royal patronage. The tournament is also notable for the absence of sponsor advertising around the courts. In 2009, Wimbledon's Centre Court was fitted with a retractable roof to lessen the loss of playing time due to rain.|$|E

500|$|The {{winners were}} {{announced}} during the awards ceremony on February 27, 2005. At age 74, Clint Eastwood became the oldest winner for Best Director in Oscar history. With his latest unsuccessful nomination for directing The Aviator, nominee Martin Scorsese joined Robert Altman, Clarence Brown, Alfred Hitchcock, and King Vidor {{as the most}} nominated individuals in the Best Director category without a single win at the time. Best Actor winner Jamie Foxx became the second actor and tenth individual overall to earn two acting nominations in the same year. By virtue of her portrayal of Katharine Hepburn, Best Supporting Actress winner Cate Blanchett was the first performer to portray a previous Oscar winner. [...] "Al otro lado del río" [...] from The Motorcycle Diaries became the second song with non-English lyrics to win Best Original Song. The first to achieve this feat was the titular song from the 1960 Greek film Never on <b>Sunday</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 33rd Academy Awards.|$|E
500|$|The Grey Cup {{was first}} {{won by the}} University of Toronto Varsity Blues. Play was {{suspended}} from 1916 to 1918 due to the First World War and in 1919 due to a rules dispute. The game has typically been contested in an east versus west format since the 1920s. Traditionally held on a <b>Sunday</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of November, the Grey Cup has been played in inclement weather at times, including the 1950 [...] "Mud Bowl," [...] in which a player reportedly came close to drowning in a puddle, then the [...] 1962 [...] "Fog Bowl," [...] when the final nine minutes of the game had to be postponed to the following day due to a heavy fog, and the 1977 [...] "Ice Bowl," [...] contested on the frozen-over artificial turf at Montreal's Olympic Stadium. The Edmonton Eskimos formed the Grey Cup's longest dynasty, winning five consecutive championships from 1978 to 1982. [...] Competition for the trophy has been exclusively between Canadian teams, except for a three-year period from 1993 to 1995, when {{an expansion of the}} CFL south into the United States resulted in the Baltimore Stallions winning the 1995 championship and taking the Grey Cup south of the border for the first time.|$|E

500|$|After Davidson's {{death and}} burial, press {{attention}} withered as newspapers concentrated on more significant {{events in the}} years before the Second World War. In the decades after the war interest in the affair was periodically revived. In 1963 Blythe, deemed by Parris to be the affair's [...] "best historian", published his account. Later in the 1960s, two stage musical versions were produced: The Stiffkey Scandals of 1932, which appeared in Edinburgh in 1967 and London in 1968, and God Made the Little Red Apple, staged in Manchester in 1969. Neither of these productions was commercially successful; when the former was adapted for television, The Daily Telegraphs critic questioned the artistic justification for a musical about [...] "so sad and peculiar a person". In the 1970s Davidson's case {{was the subject of a}} radio documentary, A Proper Little Gent, and in 1994 an episode of BBC Television's Matter of Fact series examined the affair. Cullen's full-length biography of Davidson in 1975 posits a theory that multiple personalities led him to behave in different ways in differing circumstances. Robert Brown, in a biographical sketch for the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, suggests that what really motivated Davidson will never be known. In 2007 John Walsh published a fictionalised account of Davidson's life, <b>Sunday</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Cross Bones (Fourth Estate), in which, according to a review in The Guardian, Davidson is depicted as [...] "well-meaning but ineffectual, bewildered by the world's wickedness and his own barely acknowledged desires".|$|E
