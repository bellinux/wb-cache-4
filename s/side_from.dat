5|$|A railway, the Bristol Port Railway, {{was built}} through the gorge {{on the east}} <b>side</b> <b>from</b> Hotwells to Avonmouth between 1863 and 1865. The Portishead Railway was opened {{on the west side}} in 1867. The section of the Bristol Port Railway between Hotwells and Sneyd Park {{junction}} was closed in 1922, when construction of a major road through the gorge, the Portway, was started. The Portway was opened in 1926. The road is now part of the A4 road, linking Bristol city centre to the M5 motorway, which bypasses the city near Avonmouth.|$|E
5|$|After his inauguration, Obama {{announced}} {{to a joint}} session of Congress in February 2009 his intent to work with Congress to construct a plan for healthcare reform. By July, a series of bills were approved by committees within the House of Representatives. On the Senate <b>side,</b> <b>from</b> June to September, the Senate Finance Committee held a series of 31 meetings to develop a healthcare reform bill. This group—in particular, Democrats Max Baucus, Jeff Bingaman and Kent Conrad, along with Republicans Mike Enzi, Chuck Grassley and Olympia Snowe—met for more than 60 hours, and the principles that they discussed, in conjunction with the other committees, became the foundation of the Senate healthcare reform bill.|$|E
50|$|A {{total of}} 60 teams will contest the league, {{divided into three}} groups of 20 teams. Originally, teams would include 4 <b>sides</b> relegated <b>from</b> the 2013-14 Serie B season, 29 sides playing the 2013-14 Prima Divisione season, 18 sides playing the 2013-14 Seconda Divisione season, and 9 <b>sides</b> {{promoted}} <b>from</b> the 2013-14 Serie D season. In the middle of last season Nocerina was expelled from Lega Pro (on 1 August was admitted to Eccellenza); on 15 July 2014 CoViSoc expelled Padova and Viareggio due to financial reasons; on 1 August 2014 FIGC admitted 3 teams that were relegated in the last season, thus the league included 3 <b>sides</b> <b>from</b> 2013-14 Serie B, 27 <b>sides</b> <b>from</b> 2013-14 Prima Divisione, 21 <b>sides</b> <b>from</b> 2013-14 Seconda Divisione and 9 <b>sides</b> <b>from</b> 2013-14 Serie D.|$|R

He had a hand in founding the NFL Alumni Association, a charitable organization.|$|E
5|$|Arnold James Fothergill {{was born}} on 26 August 1854 in Newcastle upon Tyne, Northumberland. He began his cricket career with Northumberland Cricket Club, a private club which was a {{precursor}} to the county team. He appeared as a professional for the <b>side</b> <b>from</b> 1870 until 1879, during which time he was also employed by Benwell High Cross Cricket Club in 1870 and 1871, and Manchester Cricket Club in 1879, before moving to Somerset in 1880.|$|E
5|$|Bayard's Cove Fort {{was built}} in the early 16th century to protect the coastal town of Dartmouth in Devon. In the medieval period, the town's harbour, located in the estuary of the River Dart, was an {{important}} trading and fishing port, able to hold up to 600 vessels; it continued to prosper in the 15th century on the proceeds of the wool trade. Fears of a French invasion, combined with the hope of retaining a valuable royal subsidy, led the town to develop Dartmouth Castle, {{on the west side of}} the estuary, into an artillery fort after 1486, with another fortification, Kingswear, being constructed the east <b>side</b> <b>from</b> 1491 onwards.|$|E

5|$|Buffon played {{every minute}} of Italy's 2002 World Cup campaign, keeping a clean sheet in the opening match against Ecuador, and saving a {{controversial}} penalty against co-hosts South Korea in the round of 16, which {{was not enough to}} stop the under-performing <b>side</b> <b>from</b> being eliminated by a golden goal in extra time. He also featured in every match at Euro 2004, keeping a clean sheet in his nation's opening 0–0 draw against Denmark, although Italy, despite not losing a match, once again underperformed, and were eliminated in the first round on direct encounters following a three-way, five-point tie with Sweden and Denmark.|$|E
5|$|Irvine soon {{warmed to}} his new neighbourhood; he enjoyed visiting Carrickfergus Castle and often spent time at the harbour. In 1950, he moved to Sunnylands Primary School and began to play {{football}} seriously. He initially concentrated on playing as a goalkeeper for the school team. In 1953, the team reached {{the final of the}} County Cup, but were defeated 0–3 by an older <b>side</b> <b>from</b> Carrick Technical School. Irvine's elder brother Bobby, who went on to represent Stoke City and was also a Northern Ireland international, played for the opposition. Along with his schoolmate William Donnelly, Irvine often frequented Windsor Park to watch the Northern Ireland national team, and he idolised players such as Jimmy McIlroy and Danny Blanchflower.|$|E
5|$|Relegation {{meant that}} 2009–10 saw Luton {{playing in the}} Conference Premier, a {{competition}} which the club had never before participated in. The club unsuccessfully contested the promotion play-offs three times in four seasons during their time as a non-League club, employing five different managers. In the 2012–13 FA Cup fourth round, Luton won their away tie against Premier League club Norwich City 1–0 and, in doing so, became the first non-League team to beat a <b>side</b> <b>from</b> England's top division since 1989. In the 2013–14 season, under the management of John Still, Luton won the Conference Premier title with three games to spare, and thereby secured {{a return to the}} Football League from 2014–15.|$|E

5|$|The {{next five}} days saw very heavy {{fighting}} as the Soviets slowly advanced through heavy German defences and repelled German counterattacks. On January 13, bad weather prevented the Soviet <b>side</b> <b>from</b> employing their air force. That day they gained almost no ground and incurred heavy losses. The German side, after their counterattacks {{had failed to}} throw back the Soviet troops, started further reinforcing the area by assembling battle groups using portions of divisions from the quiet parts of the front. These included battle groups from the 1st Infantry Division, the 61st Infantry Division, the 5th Mountain Division and the SS Police Division.|$|E

Armagh were the {{defending}} champions, having won their first title the year previously. They {{had lost the}} final in 1953 and 1977. No side had won consecutive titles since Cork in 1989 and 1990, while no <b>side</b> <b>from</b> Ulster had done so since Down, who won in 1960 and 1961.|$|E
5|$|A pair of towers {{stand on}} the river's edge a short {{distance}} on either <b>side</b> <b>from</b> the main building. They were originally two-storyed open-backed structures with gun platforms situated on their first floors, providing flanking fire down {{the line of the}} ditch around the castle's perimeter. They were later adapted for use as accommodation, with their backs closed with bricks and the towers increased in height to provide a third storey. Traces of the gun embrasures can still be seen {{at the point where the}} original roofline was. The South Tower was said to have been for the use of the castle's governor, though their lack of comfort meant that successive governors declined to live there. The two towers are linked to the main building by a crenallated curtain wall where additional cannon were emplaced in two embrasures on the north parapet and one on the south.|$|E
5|$|After {{crossing}} through Jarbo Gap, SR 70 {{drops down}} into the canyon of the North Fork Feather River, which it follows almost to Quincy, usually on the opposite <b>side</b> <b>from</b> the Feather River Route; this results in two places where both transportation lines cross the river and each other. The first {{of these is the}} Pulga Bridge, an arch bridge that crosses over a lower railroad truss bridge; soon after are the highway's three tunnels through rock formations in the canyon. After a fair distance through the canyon, and that formed by the East Branch North Fork Feather River, SR 70 reaches the junction with State Route 89 near Paxton; Routes 70 and 89 overlap southeast from that point, where the East Branch splits into Indian Creek and Spanish Creek.|$|E
