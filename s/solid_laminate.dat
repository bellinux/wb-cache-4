When heated, assembled between wood veneers and then compressed, a strong and waterproof laminated plywood was formed. Most plywood at this time used other adhesives, such as casein. These adhesives were generally applied as aqueous solutions, which caused warping of thin veneers and {{made it difficult to}} achieve a <b>solid</b> <b>laminate</b> without risk of voids. As Tego film was used dry, it gave a high integrity result, solid and without risk of hidden weaknesses.

40|$|In this study, the {{behavior}} and the damage caused in the bolt joints in sandwich structures with laminates made of glass fiber and foam core is investigated. Many investigators have studied the strength of mechanically bolted joints in composite structures but there is less in sandwich structures. It is performed on a fully composite airplane at the connection area of the wing to the fuselage and the landing gear. The area around the joint is surrounded by the laminates from glass layers (<b>solid</b> <b>laminate)</b> and its thickness is equal to whole thickness of sandwich panel. Different states of connection between the solid laminates, where the bolt connection is imbedded are studied. Also, the foam core around the connection is studied and the dependence {{of the magnitude of}} damage on various parameters like the connection angle, size, and the general shape of the <b>solid</b> <b>laminate</b> on buckling is evaluated. For considering the bolted joint performance, a three dimensional finite element model has been developed by ANSYS commercial code. Two proposed circular and squared shape of <b>solid</b> <b>laminate</b> has been considered. The results indicate that the squared shape as compared circular design will decrease the damage significantly. The best <b>solid</b> <b>laminate</b> interface angle (θ) which decreases the damage obtains 45 o and <b>solid</b> <b>laminate</b> length is not effective in damage value. Eventually, the effect of these parameters on the local buckling due to the concentrated loading applied to the bolt connection in the sandwich structure is investigated. For confirming the analytical outcomes some experimental models were performed. For testing the analytical results a fixture has been designed.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{represents}} {{an effort to}} predict the bearing strength, failure modes, and failure load of bolted joints in foam-core sandwich composites. The studied joints {{have been used in}} a light full composite airplane. By using solid laminates, a new design for the joint zone is developed. These solid laminates include a number of glass plies with total thickness equal to core thickness. The effect of <b>solid</b> <b>laminate</b> size and interface angle of foam–solid laminate in the bonding zone on the bearing strength, failure loads and type of modes are investigated. The numerical study is performed using 3 D FEM in ANSYS commercial code. Tsai–Wu failure criterion is used in the failure analysis. The results indicate that the most important parameter in the proposed joint zone design is the foam–solid laminate interface angle which plays an important role on the value of failure criterion (damage) in the bonding zone. Also, the use of squared shaped <b>solid</b> <b>laminate</b> as compared with a circular laminate will decrease the criterion value significantly. Finally, the influence of <b>solid</b> <b>laminate</b> size and interface angle on the buckling strength was discussed. As obtained through eigenvalue buckling analysis, the increase of <b>solid</b> <b>laminate</b> size or interface angle could result in considerable higher buckling strength.

40|$|A "simplified shear solution" method approximates the {{through-thickness}} {{shear stress}} distribution within a composite laminate {{based on an}} extension of laminated beam theory. The method does not consider the solution of a particular boundary value problem; rather, it requires only knowledge of the global shear loading, geometry, and material properties of the laminate or panel. It is thus analogous to lamination theory in that ply-level stresses can be efficiently determined from global load resultants at a given location in a structure and {{used to evaluate the}} margin of safety on a ply-by-ply basis. The simplified shear solution stress distribution is zero at free surfaces, continuous at ply boundaries, and integrates to the applied shear load. The method has been incorporated within the HyperSizer commercial structural sizing software to improve its predictive capability for designing composite structures. The HyperSizer structural sizing software is used extensively by NASA to design composite structures. In the case of through-thickness shear loading on panels, HyperSizer previously included a basic, industry-standard, method for approximating the resulting shear stress distribution in sandwich panels. However, no such method was employed for <b>solid</b> <b>laminate</b> panels. The purpose of the innovation is to provide an approximation of the through-thickness shear stresses in a <b>solid</b> <b>laminate</b> given the through-thickness shear loads (Qx and Qy) on the panel. The method was needed for implementation within the HyperSizer structural sizing software so that the approximated ply-level shear stresses could be utilized in a failure theory to assess the adequacy of a panel design. The simplified shear solution method was developed based on extending and generalizing bi-material beam theory to plate-like structures. It is assumed that the through-thickness shear stresses arise due to local bending of the laminate induced by the through-thickness shear load, and by imposing equilibrium both vertically and horizontally, the through-thickness shear stress distribution can be calculated. The resulting shear stresses integrate to the applied shear load, are continuous at the ply interfaces, and are zero at the laminate-free surfaces. If both Qx and Qy shear loads are present, it is assumed that they act independently and that their effects can be superposed. The calculated shear stresses can be rotated within each ply to the principal material coordinates for use in a ply-level failure criterion. The novelty of the simplified shear solution method is its simplicity {{and the fact that it}} does not require solution of a particular boundary value problem. The advantages of the innovation are that an approximation of the though-thickness shear stress distribution can be quickly determined for any <b>solid</b> <b>laminate</b> or <b>solid</b> <b>laminate</b> region within a stiffened panel...|$|E

The {{method of}} Acoustic Wavefield Imaging (AWI) offers many {{advantages}} over conventional ultrasonic techniques for nondestructive evaluation, and {{also provides a}} means of incorporating fixed ultrasonic sensors used for structural health monitoring into subsequent inspections.

Defect areas appear as stationary scattering sources on these images, but such scattered wave energy is often obscured by the stronger incident acoustic wavefield.

The modalities of the terahertz radiation used were time domain spectroscopy (TDS) and continuous wave (CW). The composite materials and structures investigated include both non‐conducting polymeric composites and carbon fiber composites. Terahertz signals in the TDS mode resembles that of ultrasound; however, unlike ultrasound, a terahertz pulse can detect a crack hidden behind a larger crack. This was demonstrated in thick GFRP laminates containing double saw slots.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 105 - 109) In tapered closeouts designs, {{the sandwich}} laminate is transitioned to a <b>solid</b> <b>laminate,</b> with high compressive strength, {{by eliminating the}} core. Tapered closeouts {{are found to be}} prone to fatigue failure by delamination. The delaminations initiate at the region where the upper and lower facesheet meet to form a <b>solid</b> <b>laminate,</b> due to the presence of voids or resin rich areas. These cracks then grow along the facesheet-core interfaces and lead to fatigue failure by delamination. Improving the fatigue life of sandwich closeouts requires {{a better understanding of the}} stresses and the damage growth mechanisms. The goal of this study is to elucidate the deformation mechanisms, load transfer, and interface stresses in the tapered close out section of a sandwich. The investigation of sandwich closeouts were performed using finite element analyses (FEA). The effects of geometry and facesheet to core stiffness on the deformation and stresses in the closeout regions are presented. The symmetry of the taper geometry and the interaction of the facesheet and core local deformation at the closeout regions are shown to provide anisotropic shear-bending coupling and shear-extension coupling. Large facesheet-core interfacial shear and normal stresses arise at the closeout region due to the localized bending at this region. The preliminary investigations also showed that the gradient in the geometry of the core leads to gradients in deformation and stress in the region. To compensate for stiffness reduction in the core geometry, use of functionally graded material (FGM) for the cores at the closeout locations are investigated. FGM cores with various gradations in the elastic modulus of the core along the closeout region were analyzed. The results indicate that increasing the core modulus at the tapered closeout apex region is effective in reducing the local deformations. However, these increases lead to small increases in stress. The increase in stress in the FGM core is not a significant concern, because in FGMs increasing stiffness can also lead to increase in strength. Decreasing the core modulus at the closeout apex regions was found to be most effective in reducing the stresses. However, such a design has large localized deformations and reduced structural stiffness. The analyses indicate that a FGM material with decreasing inplane modulus, but increasing out of plane and shear modulus will be an optimum choice for the core material at the closeout location...|$|E
