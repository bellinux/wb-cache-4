5|$|The Eurasian rock pipit's song is a {{sequence}} of about twenty tinkling cheepa notes followed by a rising series of thin gee calls, and finishing with a short trill. The shrill pseep flight call is intermediate between the soft sip sip <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> the meadow pipit and the water pipit's short, thin fist.|$|E
5|$|The water pipit's song is {{delivered}} from a perch or in flight, {{and consists of}} four or five blocks, each consisting of about half a dozen repetitions of a different short note. In comparison, the Eurasian rock pipit's song is a sequence of about twenty tinkling cheepa notes followed by a rising series of thin gee calls, and finishing with a short trill. The call of the water pipit is a single or double sharp “dzip” or similar, slightly harsher than soft sip sip <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> the meadow pipit or the shrill pseep of the Eurasian rock pipit. The short, thin fist flight call is intermediate between the <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> the meadow pipit and the rock pipit's feest. The differences between the calls of the pipit species are very subtle, and not diagnostic in the absence of other evidence. The flight call of the subspecies A. s. coutellii is shorter and more buzzing than that of the nominate race.|$|E

5|$|Some lead {{compounds}} are colorful {{and are used}} widely in paints, and lead paint is a major route of lead exposure in children. A study conducted in 1998–2000 found that 38 million housing units in the US had lead-based paint, down from a 1990 estimate of 64 million. Deteriorating lead paint can produce dangerous lead levels in household dust and soil. Deteriorating lead paint and lead-containing household dust are the main causes of chronic lead poisoning. The lead breaks down into the dust and since children {{are more prone to}} crawling on the floor, it is easily ingested. Many young children display pica, eating things that are not food. Even a small amount of a lead-containing product such as a paint chip or a <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> glaze can contain tens or hundreds of milligrams of lead. Eating chips of lead paint presents a particular hazard to children, generally producing more severe poisoning than occurs from dust. Because removing lead paint from dwellings, e.g. by sanding or torching creates lead-containing dust and fumes, it is generally safer to seal the lead paint under new paint (excepting moveable windows and doors, which create paint dust when operated). Alternately, special precautions must be taken if the lead paint is to be removed. In oil painting it was once common for colours such as yellow or white to be made with lead carbonate. Lead white oil colour was the main white of oil painters until superseded by compounds containing zinc or titanium in the mid-20th century. It is speculated that the painter Caravaggio and possibly Francisco Goya and Vincent Van Gogh had lead poisoning due to overexposure or carelessness when handling this colour.|$|E
25|$|The race saw him break Indianapolis victory lane {{tradition}} when {{he drank}} a celebratory bottle {{of orange juice}} instead of the traditional bottle of milk. He was only the second driver to not drink milk at Indianapolis since the tradition was founded in 1936 (and firmly established in 1956). Fittipaldi owned several orange groves in his native Brazil, and wanted to promote the citrus industry. He was widely criticized and ridiculed for the action, even though he later took a <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> milk after the television cameras were off.|$|E

500|$|McCay {{began work}} that May {{on his next}} {{animated}} film, How a Mosquito Operates, based on a Rarebit Fiend episode from June 5, 1909, in which a man in bed tries in vain to defend himself from a giant mosquito, which drinks itself so full that it explodes. [...] The animation is naturalistic—rather than expanding like a balloon, with each <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> blood the mosquito's abdomen swells according to its body structure. [...] The film was completed in January 1912, and McCay toured with it that spring and summer.|$|E
500|$|Throughout Tyler's life, he {{suffered}} from poor health. As he aged, {{he suffered}} more frequently from colds during the winter. On January 12, 1862, after complaining of chills and dizziness, he vomited and collapsed. He was treated, but his health did not improve, and he made {{plans to return to}} Sherwood Forest by the 18th. As he lay in bed the night before, he began suffocating, and Julia summoned his doctor. Just after midnight, Tyler took a <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> brandy, and told his doctor, [...] "I am going. Perhaps it is best." [...] He died shortly thereafter, most likely due to a stroke.|$|E
500|$|The new {{marketing}} strategy did not prove particularly successful, and in 2004 Diageo returned to regional advertising. AMV BBDO {{were presented with}} the choice of coming up with either a new theme {{to appeal to the}} 18–35 British male demographic or a new angle on the tried and tested Good things... concept. A number of ideas were put forward, including [...] "The Longest Wait". From this concept, noitulovE was quickly plotted out: the advert would show three individuals waiting 500,000,000years before finally taking their first <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> Guinness, the timeline compressed into a 50-second clip. The decision to run the [...] "Evolution sequence" [...] in reverse was taken fairly early, as it was felt that it would better hold viewers' interest during a 60-second television spot.|$|E

500|$|On 15 December, PZPN {{officials}} {{attempted to}} reconstruct the night's events, asking various players and staff to give accounts of what had happened. Several journalists were present. The stories told contradicted each other in several places, notably regarding how much Młynarczyk had had to drink. The team's technical staff {{said that he had}} been obviously intoxicated when they had seen him, while the goalkeeper insisted he had taken only [...] "three glasses of champagne and a <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> beer" [...] with his friend. Another point of contention regarded the conversation at the airport, which had caused Kulesza to yield. It was generally agreed that the players had talked the manager around by telling him that Młynarczyk had personal problems, but the non-playing staff now accused them of emotional blackmail. The players said their intention had been to explain the goalkeeper's off-field issues to help the manager make a more informed decision.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, Guinness {{launched}} a retrospective television advertising campaign promoting Guinness Extra Cold stout, featuring new ten-second versions of commercials broadcast between 1984 and 2004. These included Mars (with Rutger Hauer reprising {{his role as}} the [...] "Pure Genius"), Anticipation, Fish Bicycle, Surfer, and Bet on Black. noitulovE joined the campaign in 2006, and was the only piece to receive more than one new version. In the first of these, the patrons are encased only seconds after taking their first <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> Guinness in a glacier identical to the one which appeared halfway through the original spot. In the second, the sea through which the three fish bound backwards in the original spot is frozen while the trio are in mid-leap, leaving the characters skidding across the surface. In the final version, the primeval pool {{at the end of the}} original spot freezes while the mudskippers are taking their drink, and the protagonists' tongues are left stuck in the ice.|$|E
500|$|Becky Bain of Idolator {{commented on}} the simple {{structure}} and themes of the video, writing [...] "There’s not much to this simple vid, but it does feature Carey doing her usual hand waving theatrics while hitting some absolutely killer high notes." [...] Bain also observed {{that the vast majority}} of the shots of Carey are either long shots, showing the singer from a distance, or close up shots, showing Carey from the shoulders and above, so that the viewer was not able to easily recognise that she was pregnant. Nicole James of MTV Buzzworthy also praised the content of the video, writing [...] "Of course it wouldn't be a Mariah Carey video without some glitz and glam so the stage and backdrop are covered in (what else?) glitter. Mariah puts on a great show and sings her heart out with that famous eight-octave range... scrooges need not apply, 'Oh Santa!' is fun and festive and has you longing for a <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> eggnog." ...|$|E

500|$|The piece {{begins with}} three patrons taking their first <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> Guinness in a London pub. To {{the accompaniment of}} Sammy Davis, Jr.'s {{rendition}} of [...] "The Rhythm of Life" [...] from the 1969 film version of the 1966 Broadway musical Sweet Charity, a reverse-motion sequence begins. The three men retreat from the bar and into the street, other patrons disappearing as they pass. As they move down the street, a reverse time-lapse-style sequence transforms their clothes to match a rapidly changing urban scene, which progresses through modern-day London to the Edwardian period. Electric lights transform into gas lamps and buildings begin to disappear frame by frame. A short cutaway sequence shows the city regressing into the past, shrinking to a small Saxon settlement before disappearing entirely. Returning to the main sequence, the three men's clothes and hairstyles are adjusted into Bronze Age equivalents as they pass through thickening woodland. A close-up {{of one of the}} characters shows his features quickly transformed into those of a caveman. The trio are then frozen in an ice age glacier.|$|E
500|$|Grohl and Jones {{produced}} the record across {{a period of}} one week in October 1994, with Grohl on vocals and all instruments. Both would arrive {{in the morning at}} Robert Lang Studios, start production by noon and do four songs a day. According to Grohl, during the recording process he would run from room to room, [...] "still sweating and shaking from playing drums and [...] pick up the guitar and put down a track, do the bass, maybe another guitar part, have a <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> coffee and then go in and do the next song". The only performance by an outsider was a guitar part on [...] "X-Static" [...] provided by Greg Dulli of The Afghan Whigs, who was watching Grohl record the songs. Grohl eventually asked him if he wanted to play and handed him a guitar. Each song took about 45 minutes to be completed, and the compositions were recorded in the same order that became the album's track listing. The only song that required two run-throughs before completion was [...] "I'll Stick Around". Grohl was insecure about his singing, and added effects to his voice in [...] "Floaty", and tried to enhance the performance through double track – [...] "You know how people double their vocals to make them stronger? That album the vocals are quadrupled." ...|$|E

2500|$|The low-budget ad {{featured}} {{only two}} characters: a patron of an unidentified pub and the barman serving him. The patron (McKinney) orders {{a pint of}} Guinness stout and, {{while waiting for the}} pint to be poured, carries out a series of quirky dancing movements with the settling pint in the foreground, to the amusement of the barman. The piece ends with the patron taking his first <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> the freshly poured pint overlaid by the Guinness advertising slogan [...] "No time like Guinness Time". The advert is set to Guaglione by Pérez Prado, and makes heavy use of jump cutting from a static camera to allow the dancer to make a series of movements that could not be achieved in reality.|$|E

[...] "There was much noise, calls for order and the singing of a ribald chorus of 'On Rosenwater's doorstep, down Leytonstone way' {{to the tune of}} Mother Kelly. Irving Rosenwater was a leading member at that time and some of the club's elder statesmen were angry enough to walk out.

The incident was also brought up during a [...] "Celebrity Secrets" [...] comedy bit on Late Night with Conan O'Brien in the late 1990s, where a nervous-acting Ritter jokingly says [...] "Somebody asked me if I did that on purpose...", after taking a nervous <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> water, he responds [...] "You bet I did!" ...|$|E
