30|$|Second, {{while driving}} speed is {{definitely}} the predominant measure for consideration around schools, the selection of appropriate traffic control devices should also consider other factors, such as visibility, legibility, and comprehension. All of these <b>signs</b> <b>and</b> markings are explicitly defined in China’s Road Traffic <b>Signs</b> <b>and</b> Markings Manual (2009). Since {{a thorough understanding of}} traffic <b>signs</b> <b>and</b> markings is one of the prerequisites for obtaining a driver’s license, we assumed that all drivers are familiar with the <b>signs</b> <b>and</b> markings. Consequently, we did not evaluate drivers’ cognitive ability. Certainly, if possible, the legibility of <b>signs</b> <b>and</b> markings and drivers’ cognitive ability should be studied in further research.|$|R

On that basis the per-weapon cost is $300,000 or twelve times the cost of the comparable American JDAM, although the latter has been manufactured in much larger quantities (~250,000 kits) and would be reasonable to expect a drastic reduction of the price of the French munition if larger contracts are <b>signed</b> <b>and</b> economies of scale are achieved.|$|E

5|$|In {{light of}} this information, it is {{unlikely}} that Cairano, at his death, was able to pass on an artistic legacy to assure the survival of his studio, despite having trained his son and other co-workers, as well as artists such as Ambrogio Mazzola, whose Madonna and Child, <b>signed</b> <b>and</b> dated 1536 and preserved in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, clearly shows the influence of Cairano's style from thirty years before.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{development}} and testing of a tool designed to assess chronic wounds for the clinical <b>signs</b> <b>and</b> symptoms of localized infection. Thirty-one wounds were assessed by two independent nurse observers for the <b>signs</b> <b>and</b> symptoms of infection using the Clinical <b>Signs</b> <b>and</b> Symptoms Checklist. The Clinical <b>Signs</b> <b>and</b> Symptoms Checklist delineates 12 <b>signs</b> <b>and</b> symptoms of infection (i. e., pain, erythema, edema, heat, purulent exudate, serous exudate with concurrent inflammation, delayed healing, discoloration of granulation tissue, friable granulation tissue, pocketing {{at the base of}} the wound, foul odor, and wound breakdown) and their definitions. The reliability of each sign or symptom on the checklist was calculated using percent agreement and the Kappa statistic. Percent agreement ranged from 65 % to 100 %, and Kappa statistics ranged from 0. 53 to 1. 00, excluding pocketing of the wound base. The reliability estimates obtained for <b>signs</b> <b>and</b> symptoms on the Clinical <b>Signs</b> <b>and</b> Symptoms Checklist compare favorably with other data regarding interclinician agreement on wound assessment. Incorporating a structured approach to assess and monitor for wound infection, such as the Clinical <b>Signs</b> <b>and</b> Symptoms Checklist, may improve clinician skill and accuracy in identifying this condition...|$|R

The document today exists in the Bodleian Library in Oxford, as a transcript made by the 17th-century antiquarian William Dugdale.
