2500|$|The {{required}} notice may {{be given}} by including it in the agency’s regular billing statement for the property-related fee or charge, or by any other mailing by the agency to the address to which the agency customarily mails the billing statement for the property-related fee or charge. [...] However, if the agency desires to preserve any authority it may have to record or enforce a lien on the parcel to which a property-related service is provided, the agency must also mail notice to the record owner’s address shown on the last equalized assessment roll if that address is different than the billing or <b>service</b> <b>address.</b> [...] While allowing local agencies to include a property-related fee or charge notice in the regular billing statement may be cost-effective for the local agency, it places a greater responsibility on the record owner to thoroughly review the billing statement mailing {{so as not to}} overlook a property-related fee or charge notice.|$|E

50|$|Both numbers can {{be called}} from mobile phones with the keylock on, or without {{entering}} the PIN where {{that would otherwise be}} required. Although some mobile phones allow emergency calls to be attempted without a SIM card, at present the UK networks reject such calls. Since November 2009, an emergency call can be made through any UK mobile network {{as long as there is}} a SIM for any valid UK network in the handset. Although UK VOIP phone providers are required to offer 999 / 112 service this is subject to a registration for the service and with a verified <b>service</b> <b>address</b> and users need to be aware such service may not work in a power blackout; However International VOIP providers may not provide this service.|$|E
50|$|If 9-1-1 is dialed from a {{commercial}} Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP) service, {{depending on how}} the provider handles such calls, the call may not go anywhere at all, or it may go to a non-emergency number at the public safety answering point associated with the billing or <b>service</b> <b>address</b> of the caller. Because a VoIP adapter can be plugged into any broadband internet connection, a caller could actually be hundreds or even thousands of miles away from home, yet if the call goes to an answering point at all, it would be the one associated with the caller's address and not the actual location of the call. It may never be possible to reliably and accurately identify the location of a VoIP user, even if a GPS receiver is installed in the VoIP adapter, since such phones are normally used indoors, and thus may be unable to get a signal.|$|E
