25|$|Windows Server 2012 also {{introduced}} {{the ability to}} use simple SMB shares as a <b>shared</b> <b>storage</b> option (in conjunction with the new Scale out File Services role in Server 2012 for highly available environments), alleviating the need for expensive SANs. This is particularly useful for low budget environments, without the need to sacrifice performance due to the many new improvements to the SMB3 stack. Windows Server 2012 will fully support the live migration of VMs running on SMB shares, whether it be a live or live system migration.|$|E
2500|$|Windows Server 2012's {{implementation}} of Hyper-V (Version 3.0) introduced many new features to increase VM mobility, including {{the ability to}} execute simultaneous live migrations (Windows Server 2008 R2 only supported live migrating a single VM at a time, significantly increasing {{the time required to}} carry administrative tasks, such as draining a node for scheduled maintenance). The only real limiting factor here is hardware and network bandwidth available. Windows Server 2012 also supports a new [...] "shared nothing live migration" [...] option, where no traditional <b>shared</b> <b>storage</b> is required in order to complete a migration. Also referred to as “Live System Migration”, a shared nothing live migration will move a running VM and its storage from one Hyper-V host to another without any perceived downtime. Live Migration between different host OS versions is not possible, although this is soon to be addressed in Windows Server 2012 R2.|$|E

For example, a single storage area network accessed by multiple virtualization hosts is considered <b>shared</b> <b>storage,</b> but is not considered highly available at the storage level - if that single storage area network fails, neither host within the cluster can access the <b>shared</b> <b>storage.</b> DRBD allows for a storage target that is both shared and highly available.|$|E

The main purpose of our research {{is to develop a}} highly secure and highly reliable storage system. We have proposed a storage system that utilizes a secret <b>sharing</b> scheme. The <b>storage</b> system is called the Secret <b>Sharing</b> <b>Storage</b> System. So far, we have developed a prototype of the storage system. In this paper, we propose an automatic repair mechanism, and an interval decision method for this system. key words: secret <b>sharing</b> scheme, <b>storage</b> system, multi-agent system 1...|$|R

50|$|The {{practitioners}} of big data analytics processes are generally hostile to slower <b>shared</b> <b>storage,</b> preferring direct-attached storage (DAS) {{in its various}} forms from solid state drive (Ssd) to high capacity SATA disk buried inside parallel processing nodes. The perception of <b>shared</b> <b>storage</b> architectures—Storage area network (SAN) and Network-attached storage (NAS) —is that they are relatively slow, complex, and expensive.
