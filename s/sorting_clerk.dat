50|$|Whilst {{he was a}} teenager, Kiely {{began to}} feel the urge to become a writer. He had a keen {{interest}} in the work of George Bernard Shaw, H. G. Wells and Jonathan Swift. In 1936, after completing his education at Mount St Columba Christian Brothers School in Omagh, he went to work as a <b>sorting</b> <b>clerk</b> in Omagh Post Office, where his brother-in-law Frank McCrory was working (Frank was the husband of Kiely's sister Eileen).|$|E
50|$|In 1946, the United States Postal Service {{explored}} {{the concept of}} flying post offices using highly modified C-82s which would operate similarly to those on trains where mail would be <b>sorted</b> by <b>clerks</b> and put in bags and then transferred to trucks on landing.|$|R

30|$|When {{looking at}} the wage {{dispersion}} {{on the basis of}} a much more detailed classification criterion for workers, such as occupational groups, we can observe the Gini index varying widely across different occupations, ranging from 0.08 (Mail carriers and <b>sorting</b> <b>clerks)</b> to 0.40 (System analysts). Moreover, it becomes obvious (see Table  1) that the wage dispersion is much lower when based on 4 -digit occupational groups (on average, within-occupational Gini[*]=[*] 0.19) rather than 5 educational groups (on average, within-educational Gini[*]=[*] 0.29). But more importantly, it is worth noting that within-occupational wage variation still accounts for, on average, approximately two thirds of the level measured for the total population (the average within-occupation Gini index is 0.19, whereas the measured Gini index of the whole population is 0.34). Thus, even after controlling for occupation, wage variation is still observable.|$|R
50|$|Brown {{was born}} in Glasgow, Scotland, where {{his father was a}} Clydeside engineer. He was educated at Allan Glen's School and Whitehill Secondary School, Glasgow. He left school aged 14 to work at the Post Office, and played semi-professional {{football}} at Shettleston Juniors. By 1935 he was a temporary postman-messenger and by 1937 a <b>sorting</b> <b>clerk</b> and telegraphist. Both of his parents were members of the Independent Labour Party, which he also joined in 1935. He moved over to the Labour Party in 1946. He became a civil servant in 1947 at the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance.|$|E
5000|$|Like other ambitious rural Irishmen of his generation, such as Michael Collins and J.J. Walsh, Lynch found {{employment}} in the Postal service. He began working as a <b>sorting</b> <b>clerk</b> in the Cork GPO and studied at Skerry's College for entrance to the Civil Service. In an open competitive examination he secured a place as a [...] "Boy Clerk" [...] at the Mount Pleasant money order office, London. Mount Pleasant would play a very significant part {{in the growth of}} the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB), because it was here that individuals such as Collins, Sam Maguire and others first became acquainted. Lynch himself would {{become a member of the}} IRB Supreme Council. While in London he played hurling with the London Gaels.|$|E
50|$|Wright's {{father was}} a {{postmaster}} in the town and at age 14 {{he was forced to}} leave Barnsley Grammar School and the scholarship he had won. Wright began working at the local postoffice serving in the various departments as messenger boy, post boy, <b>sorting</b> <b>clerk</b> and serving behind the counter. He was determined to succeed in life and took exams which bought him to London in 1894 as a second division clerk. In 1897 he was promoted into the London Postal Service. He was always interested in church work and had taught in the Sunday School at the church he attended. After hearing a sermon one Sunday from a missionary, he felt drawn to missionary work and he offered to CMS to go abroad as one of their missionaries.|$|E
6000|$|Then I recollected what Jasper, who {{had been}} in to Winnipeg, told me a day or two before. [...] "I looked in at the Tecumseh House, and the clerk {{mentioned}} that a wild man from the old country had been asking for you. Wouldn't answer any questions; a lunatic of some <b>sort,</b> the <b>clerk</b> reckoned." ...|$|R

50|$|Increasingly, {{there were}} Dyaks, a <b>sort</b> of high <b>clerk</b> who {{supplemented}} a voyevoda in administrative affairs. Valid documents {{had to be}} countersigned by the Dyak. This collective administration was designed to prevent corruption. Below the Dyak was the Podyachy or underclerk. These were often local men who might hold office for decades.|$|R
50|$|Henry Kelly {{was born}} to Charles Kelly of Dublin and Jane (née McGarry) of Manchester. He was left the oldest of 10 {{children}} after his father died in 1904. He was educated at St Patrick's School and Xaverian College, both in Manchester. After moving to King Street in Moston he was employed as a <b>sorting</b> <b>clerk</b> at the Newton Street sorting office and trained with the 'Manchester Royal Engineers territorial Regiment'. On 5 September 1914, aged 27, he enlisted into the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders as a Private. He transferred to the Manchester Regiment and became a Lance Corporal and two weeks later a Sergeant Major. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant on 12 May 1915 into the Duke of Wellington's Regiment (West Riding Regiment). On 29 October 1918 {{he was awarded the}} Victoria Cross and after being presented with his VC ribbon, by the corps commander on 11 September he was made a Temporary Lieutenant.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very good, sit down," [...] said Frank, [...] "and let us {{consider}} it. In the first place, I regret to say that I have not been taught any trade, so that I cannot become a blacksmith or a carpenter or anything of that <b>sort.</b> A <b>clerk's</b> duties I can undertake, {{but it seems to}} me that clerks are not much wanted here just now. Porterage is heavy work and rather slow. I may be reduced to that if nothing better turns up, but it has occurred to me that I might try painting with success. What would you say to that, Joe?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Meantime, not {{to change}} the subject, I'd better be {{planning}} and watching for a suitable day for proposing, don't you think? Consider it.

6000|$|... 'They are principally yours, Fortescue,' Mr. Hawtrey said, as the <b>clerk</b> <b>sorted</b> them over. 'The {{inquiries}} after Clara's health {{must have}} materially benefited the postal revenue. As {{you are not}} coming I will put those four for Ada in my pocket. There is nothing for either of the others, and only one for me. I know what its contents are without opening it.' ...|$|R
25|$|G Deck, the Lower Deck, was {{the lowest}} {{complete}} deck to accommodate passengers, and had the lowest portholes, protruding above the waterline. The squash court was located here along with the travelling post office where mail <b>clerks</b> <b>sorted</b> letters and parcels {{so that they would}} be ready for delivery when the ship docked. Food was also stored here. The deck was interrupted at several points by orlop (partial) decks over the boiler, engine and turbine rooms.|$|R
50|$|Herbert Vogel, {{known as}} Herb, {{was the son}} of a Russian Jewish garment worker from Harlem. He never {{finished}} high school and, after serving in the U.S. Army during World War II, worked nights as a <b>clerk</b> <b>sorting</b> mail for the United States Postal Service until his retirement in 1979. Dorothy Faye Hoffman was the daughter of an Orthodox Jewish stationery merchant from Elmira, New York. She received a bachelor's degree from Syracuse University and a master's degree from the University of Denver, both in library science, and worked until her retirement in 1990 as a librarian for the Brooklyn Public Library.|$|R
5000|$|Hegener {{was born}} in Sensburg, East Prussia, in 1905. He trained as a banker, working for Dresdner Bank as an accountant. After losing his job because of the Depression, he founded a dye works, which, however, went bankrupt. He joined the Nazi party in 1931. In 1937, an {{acquaintance}} enabled him {{to find a job}} at the Reich Chancellery, and he was transferred to Hitler's Chancellery. Initially he worked as a <b>clerk</b> <b>sorting</b> mail addressed to Hitler and processing applications from part-Jews, so-called Mischlinge, who wished to marry. By 1939, the year Hitler gave permission for the program to [...] "euthanize" [...] handicapped children, he had become deputy to Hans Hefelmann and office manager in Department IIb, which processed ministerial matters and requests for clemency.|$|R
60|$|I {{was raised}} to farm work, which I {{continued}} till I was twenty-two. At twenty-one I came to Illinois, Macon County. Then I got to New Salem, {{at that time in}} Sangamon, now in Menard County, where I remained a year as a <b>sort</b> of <b>clerk</b> in a store. Then came the Black Hawk war; and I was elected a captain of volunteers, a success which gave me more pleasure than any I have had since. I went the campaign, was elected, ran for the Legislature the same year (1832), and was beaten--the only time I ever have been beaten by the people. The next and three succeeding biennial elections I was elected to the Legislature. I was not a candidate afterward. During this legislative period I had studied law, and removed to Springfield to practice it. In 1846 I was once elected to the lower House of Congress. Was not a candidate for re-election. From 1849 to 1854, both inclusive, practiced law more assiduously than ever before. Always a Whig in politics; and generally on the Whig electoral tickets, making active canvasses. I was losing interest in politics when the repeal of the Missouri Compromise aroused me again. What I have done since then is pretty well known.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Quite right, my boy; {{the pity}} {{was that he}} did not trust to your honour, but he seems to have worked himself into the state of mind when young men run amuck. I saw his colonel, Lydiard, and the captain and {{sergeant}} of his company, who had from the first seen that {{he was a man of}} a higher class under a cloud, and had expected further inquiry, though, even from the little that had been seen of him, there was a readiness to take his word. As the sergeant said, he was not the common <b>sort</b> of runaway <b>clerk,</b> and it was a thousand pities that he must go to the civil power---in which I am disposed to agree. What sort of man is the cousin at the marble works?' ...|$|R
40|$|Job {{prospects}} for former Supreme Court law clerks have radically changed in recent years. Beginning in 1986, skyrocketing law firm signing bonuses caused a transformation {{from the natural}} <b>sorting</b> system, where <b>clerks</b> chose among private practice, government, academic, and public interest positions, to a Bonus Baby Regime where former clerks almost always choose to work in private firms after they leave the Court. This development {{is a result of}} both financial and ideological factors. While the more conservative clerking corps of recent years has been increasingly drawn to private practice, the firms themselves hire along ideological lines. Still, while former clerks have largely eschewed non- law-firm positions at the start, most clerks are not shackled by golden handcuffs and leave their first jobs after two years. Thus, the new breed of bonus babies has unprecedented career options—both lucrative and prestigious—in a way that their predecessors never had...|$|R

60|$|The {{master of}} the workhouse is not, in our parish—nor is he usually in any other—one of that class of men {{the better part of}} whose {{existence}} has passed away, and who drag out the remainder in some inferior situation, with just enough thought of the past, to feel degraded by, and discontented with the present. We are unable to guess precisely to our own satisfaction what station the man can have occupied before; we should think he had been an inferior <b>sort</b> of attorney’s <b>clerk,</b> or else the master of a national school—whatever he was, it is clear his present position is a change for the better. His income is small certainly, as the rusty black coat and threadbare velvet collar demonstrate: but then he lives free of house-rent, has a limited allowance of coals and candles, and an almost unlimited allowance of authority in his petty kingdom. He is a tall, thin, bony man; always wears shoes and black cotton stockings with his surtout; and eyes you, as you pass his parlour-window, as if he wished you were a pauper, just to give you a specimen of his power. He is an admirable specimen of a small tyrant: morose, brutish, and ill-tempered; bullying to his inferiors, cringing to his superiors, and jealous of the influence and authority of the beadle.|$|R
5000|$|Fujibayashi's first {{involvement}} with the Zelda series was with the Game Boy Color games The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages. In the initial development stages, he acted as <b>sort</b> of a <b>clerk,</b> who gathered all staff ideas and created presentations to propose the game concepts to producer Shigeru Miyamoto. Fujibayashi eventually became the director, participated as planner and scenario writer, and devised a system to link the two games for consecutive playthroughs. During his time at Capcom, he also directed and planned the Game Boy Advance games The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords and The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap. Following his switch to Nintendo, Fujibayashi became subdirector and story writer for the Nintendo DS game The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass. Afterward, he made his directorial debut for a home console Zelda with the Wii game The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword. He would later return to direct the Nintendo Switch/Wii U game The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. According to Fujibayashi, {{the most important aspect}} of game design is making the fundamental rule set of a video game absolutely clear to a player. He has a special fondness for the first Legend of Zelda, which he described as [...] "novel" [...] and [...] "groundbreaking" [...] for its time.|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly," [...] said Mrs. Arabin. [...] "I {{have got}} to show now that I did not steal it,--have I not? Mr. Soames will indict me now. And, indeed, I have had some trouble to refresh my memory as to all the particulars, for you see {{it is more than}} a year past." [...] But Mrs. Arabin's mind was clearer on such matters than Mr. Crawley's, and she was able to explain that she had taken the cheque as part of the rent due to her from the {{landlord}} of [...] "The Dragon of Wantly," [...] which inn was her property, having been the property of her first husband. For some years past there had been a difficulty about the rent, things not having gone at [...] "The Dragon of Wantly" [...] as smoothly as they had used to go. At one time the money had been paid half-yearly by the landlord's cheque on the bank at Barchester. For the last year-and-a-half this had not been done, and the money had come into Mrs. Arabin's hands at irregular periods and in irregular sums. There was at this moment rent due for twelve months, and Mrs. Arabin expressed her doubt whether she would get it on her return to Barchester. On the occasion to which she was now alluding, the money had been paid into her own hands, in the deanery breakfast-parlour, by a man she knew very well,--not the landlord himself, but one bearing the landlord's name, whom she believed to be the landlord's brother, or at least his cousin. The man in question was named Daniel Stringer, and he had been employed in [...] "The Dragon of Wantly," [...] as a <b>sort</b> of <b>clerk</b> or managing man, as long as she had known it. The rent had been paid to her by Daniel Stringer quite as often as by Daniel's brother or cousin, John Stringer, who was, in truth, the landlord of the hotel. When questioned by John respecting the persons employed at the inn, she said that she did believe that there had been rumours of something wrong. The house had been {{in the hands of the}} Stringers for many years,--before the property had been purchased by her husband's father,--and therefore there had been an unwillingness to move them; but gradually, so she said, there had come upon her and her husband a feeling that the house must be put into other hands. [...] "But did you say nothing about the cheque?" [...] John asked. [...] "Yes, I said a good deal about it. I asked why a cheque of Mr. Soames's was brought to me, instead of being taken to the bank for money; and Stringer explained to me that they were not very fond of going to the bank, as they owed money there, but that I could pay it into my account. Only I kept my account at the other bank." ...|$|R
