5|$|Plutonium–uranium, {{with about}} 15–30mol.% plutonium, {{can be used}} as a nuclear fuel for fast breeder reactors. Its {{pyrophoric}} nature and high susceptibility to corrosion to the point of self-igniting or disintegrating after exposure to air require alloying with other components. Addition of aluminium, carbon or copper does not improve disintegration rates markedly, zirconium and iron alloys have better corrosion resistance but they disintegrate in <b>several</b> <b>months</b> <b>in</b> air as well. Addition of titanium and/or zirconium significantly increases the melting point of the alloy.|$|E
