5000|$|Both {{telescoping}} types use the manometric {{property of}} water to provide a seal. The whole tank floats in a circular or annular water reservoir, held up by the roughly constant pressure of a varying volume of gas, the pressure determined {{by the weight of}} the structure, and the water providing the seal for the gas within the moving walls. Besides storing the gas, the tank's design serves to establish the pressure of the gas system. With telescoping (multiple-lift) tanks, the innermost tank has a ~1 ft wide by 2 ft high (30x60 cm) lip around the outside of the bottom edge, called a cup, which picks up water as it rises above the reservoir water level. This immediately engages a downward lip on the inner rim of the next outer lift, called a dip or grip, and as this grip sinks into the cup, it preserves the water seal as the inner tank continues to rise until the grip grounds on the cup, whereupon further injection of gas will start to raise that lift as well. Holders were built with as many as four lifts. An extra flying lift could be retrofitted into column or frame gas holders. This was an additional inner tank that extended above the standards, when the infrastructure would support the extra shear forces and weight.

40|$|In this article, an {{integrated}} conjecture about {{the method of}} drawing of monumental prehistoric wall-paintings is presented and supported. Specifically, the article deals with paintings that initially decorated the internal walls of the highest floor of a building, called ""Xeste 3 "", at Akrotiri of the Greek island of Thera circa. 1650 B. C. It is argued that these wall-paintings could had been drawn while the brush was guided by an apparatus, which corresponds to advanced for the era of geometric prototypes with impressive precision. A set of assumptions concerning the actions the artists might have taken {{in order to create}} the spiral themes is stated and supported. These assumptions refer to the existence of a draft plan, the sequence of brush strokes, the placement of the brush on the wall, as well as the possible form of the apparatus. These conjectures are evaluated and tested by means of curve fitting and image analysis methods developed by the authors. The results indicate that all drawn contour parts optimally fit along a single prototype linear spiral with fitting error of less than 0. 4 mm, supporting existence of a very advanced culture for the era of geometric guide. It is statistically rejected that this guide could have the form of a stamp. Moreover, there is strong evidence that the painter might have used a draft plan of the spiral themes to prepare the final drawing and that the linear <b>spiral</b> <b>guide</b> has been used by alternating its placements in order to form the internal and external spiral contour. © 2010 ACM...|$|R

Methods An upstream catheter was used, modified to allow for percutaneous insertion by the Seldinger technic (fig. 1). Tihe catheter had an asym-metrical double lumen, the narrower lumen being occupied by the leads from the thermistor to an external resistance bridge, the large lumen (1. 2 mm.) being used to introduce the catheter over a <b>spiral</b> <b>guide</b> and for injection of indicator. The external diameter was 2. 5 mm. The tip of the catheter was slightly conically narrowed and slightly curved. The thermistor was located on the concave surface of the curve (to prevent contact with the vessel wall) about 5 to 10 mm. from the tip. The thermistor was slightly raised {{from the surface of the}} catheter, resting on its own lead wires in order to limit a thermal in-fluence on it by the intraluminal contents of the catheter. The insulation layer on the thermistor was as thin as possible in order to have a small time constant, 0. 3 second or less, measured in cool water. The indicator was 5 ml. of physiologic saline kept at room temperature. The duration of the injection varied from 0. 3 to 0. 5 second. Just before each injection we fill the catheter with blood by opening the stopcock slightly. This allows us to subtract a precise dead space of the catheter from the known total injectate.

40|$|The Holweck pump {{is widely}} used in the vacuum pumping industry. It can be a self {{standing}} apparatus {{or it can be}} part of a more advanced pumping system. It is composed by an inner rotating cylinder (rotor) and an outer stationary cylinder (stator). One of them, has <b>spiral</b> <b>guided</b> grooves resulting to a gas motion from the high towards the low vacuum port. Vacuum pumps may be simulated by the DSMC method but due to the involved high computational cost in many cases manufactures commonly resort to empirical formulas and experimental data. Recently a computationally efficient simulation of the Holweck pump via linear kinetic theory has been proposed by Sharipov et al [1]. Neglecting curvature and end effects the gas flow configuration through the helicoidal channels is decomposed into four basic flows. They correspond to pressure and boundary driven flows through a grooved channel and through a long channel with a T shape cross section. Although the formulation and the methodology are explained in detail, results are very limited and more important they are presented in a normalized way which does not provide the needed information about the pump performance in terms of the involved geometrical and flow parameters. In the present work the four basic flows are solved numerically based on the linearized BGK model equation subjected to diffuse boundary conditions. The results obtained are combined {{in order to create a}} database of the flow characteristics for a large spectrum of the rarefaction parameter and various geometrical configurations. Based on this database the performance characteristics which are critical in the design of the Holweck pump are computed and the design parameters such as the angle of the pump and the rotational speed, are optimized.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an investigation into}} the scattering of the fundamental Lamb, shear horizontal and edge-guided Rayleigh-type wave modes from sub-surface and hard-to-inspect damage on cavities representative of fuel weep holes in integral stiffeners. Detection, localisation and characterisation of scattered elastic guided wave fields can assist with improving the reliability and probability of detection of health monitoring systems through informed placement of actuators and sensors. The combination of the experimental-computational-analytical approach gives rise to new insights and guidance for the quantification of defects located in hard-to-inspect regions with actuators and sensors placed in easily accessible locations. Three-dimensional laser vibrometry is used to confirm that ultrasonic guided plate waves, generated by permanently bonded low-profile surface-mounted piezoceramic disc transducers, are able to form edge-guided Rayleigh-type waves on the free surface of open cavities. The behaviour of the propagating ultrasonic guided waves around cavities and their interaction with simulated fatigue damage emanating from the cavities is visualised. In situ non-destructive evaluation of the airframe stiffener is shown to be viable using symmetric guided waves given that the strength of the characteristic scattered <b>spiralling</b> <b>guided</b> wave field maintains its form and grows in amplitude as the damage length in increased. In contrast to the high frequency bulk-wave wedge transducer methodology traditionally used for weep hole inspection, the length-scales of the in situ technique are such that the wavelength of the incident guided waves are comparable with the hole diameter, and larger than the defect length. The monitoring of upward growing hidden damage from circular weep holes in integral stiffeners using symmetric guided waves is unique in that the received energy, that is the measured surface velocity on the accessible surface, monotonically increases with respect to increasing damage length. A series of computational studies with a three-dimensional finite element model is conducted to understand how and why scattered plate waves from the defect can be detected on the accessible surface. The ability to accurately model acousto-ultrasonic elastic wave dynamics is crucial for future developments in this research field. The computational results are compared with the experimental laser vibrometry data for model validation. It is concluded that the boundary conditions for wave scattering from the hidden notch are a complex combination of the incident wave field and the dispersive edge-guided Rayleigh-type wave that is formed on the free surface of the cavity...|$|R

Measurements were carried out both in the vent opening itself and in the greenhouse {{at the height of the}} ventilator. Wind blowing parallel to the greenhouse ridge gave rise to an inflow at the leeward part of the ventilator. The influx then follows a <b>spiral</b> trajectory <b>guided</b> by the internal surface of the walls and the shape of the roof before exiting at the upwind end. A large portion of the greenhouse situated between the centre and the upwind wall is ventilated less efficiently than the remainder of the greenhouse creating a large volume of higher temperature air that extends between the centre of the greenhouse and the windward wall. It is shown that the mean and turbulent components of the sensible heat flux through the vent amount to 58 % and 42 % of the total exchange between the greenhouse and its environment. Comparison with previous measurements demonstrates a large dependence of the wind-driven ventilation efficiency on wind speed. This confirms that other ventilation mechanisms, such as the stack effect, become important when the wind speed is low. These measurements are in a very good accord with flow patterns simulated by computational fluid dynamics techniques. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B. V...|$|R

Chapter VII describes some (Tl) /Ge(Li) y - y coincidence measurenents of 207 Bi and it is possible that these are the first measurenents on 207 Bi with this type of equipment. <p...|$|R
