50|$|Using {{a carrier}} board is a benefit in many cases, {{as it can}} {{implement}} special I/O interfaces, memory devices, connectors or form factors. Separating {{the design of the}} carrier board and COM makes design concepts more modular, if needed. A carrier tailored to a special application may involve high design overhead by itself. If the actual processor and main I/O controllers are located on a COM, it is much easier, for example, to upgrade a CPU component to the next generation, without having to redesign a very <b>specialized</b> <b>carrier</b> as well. This can save costs and shorten development times. On the other hand, this only works if the board-to-board connection between the COM and its carrier remains compatible between upgrades.|$|E
50|$|Likely {{the most}} {{important}} technological advance made during the General War in the west was the fast drone. Early drones could only make speeds 8 or 12, and target starships could easily evade them while still threatening the ships that launched them. These slow drones made the Anchor tactic an mandatory for the Kzintis and Gorns, who relied on their seeking weapons {{for most of their}} firepower. Just before the war's start, the speed-20 (type M or medium speed) drones appeared. These could still be evaded but were difficult to avoid while attacking the launcher starship. In Y180 the fastest type F or speed-32 drones began appearing in the war, and these proved devastatingly effective, though expensive. Many other drone improvements became available to the drone-using races: multi-warhead drones, spearfish and swordfish drones with specialized warheads, Active Terminal Guidance (freeing drone control channels on the launcher starship), and armored drones which were more difficult to intercept. The Electronic Warfare Drone revolutionized starship fighting tactics because it made its parent ship more difficult to hit. Finally, the long-range bombardment drone, with its <b>specialized</b> <b>carrier</b> starship, won many battles for their users throughout the war. They became ever-more-powerful with the ongoing development of superior drone ammunition.|$|E
40|$|A {{previous}} report from our laboratory (Collier et al 1993) {{showed that the}} elongated tubules of mitochondria in the cytoplasm of cultured chicken embryo fibroblasts collpased to irregularly shaped structures surrounding the nuclear membrane after a 1 h heat shock treatment. The normal mitochondiral morphology reappeared upon removal of then thermal stress. We have now determined that several changes occured in mitochondrial-related metabolites under these same heat shock and recovery conditions. Among these were significant decreases in the levels of fumarate and malate and increases in the amounts of aspartate and glutamate. In contrast, other intermediates of the tri-carboxylic acid cycle were unaltered as were levels of ATP and phosphocreatine. The changes observed might result from heat shock-induced changes in enzyme activities of the mitochondria or from alterations in the membrane-embedded <b>specialized</b> <b>carrier</b> proteins that transport metabolites between cytosol and mitochondria, from a disorganization of the electron-transport system normally coupled to oxidative metabolism. The rapid recovery, however, suggested that these changes were transient and readily reversible...|$|E

40|$|Auxins {{represent}} an important class of plant hormone that regulate plant development. Plants use <b>specialized</b> <b>carrier</b> proteins {{to transport the}} auxin indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) to target tissues. To date, efflux carrier-mediated polar auxin transport has been assumed to represent the sole mode of long distance IAA movement. Localization of the auxin permease AUX 1 in the Arabidopsis root apex has revealed a novel phloem-based IAA transport pathway. AUX 1, asymmetrically localized to the plasma membrane of root protophloem cells, is proposed to promote the acropetal, post-phloem movement of auxin to the root apex. MS analysis shows that IAA accumulation in aux 1 mutant root apices is impaired, consistent with an AUX 1 phloem unloading function. AUX 1 localization to columella and lateral root cap tissues of the Arabidopsis root apex reveals that the auxin permease regulates a second IAA transport pathway. Expression studies using an auxin-regulated reporter suggest that AUX 1 is necessary for root gravitropism by facilitating basipetal auxin transport to distal elongation zone tissues...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{research}} has highlighted {{the importance of}} auxin concentration gradients during plant development. Establishment of these gradients is believed to involve polar auxin transport through <b>specialized</b> <b>carrier</b> proteins. We have used an experimental system, the wood-forming tissue of hybrid aspen, which allows tissue-specific expression analysis of auxin carrier genes and quantification of endogenous concentrations of the hormone. As part of this study, we isolated the putative polar auxin transport genes, PttLAX 1 –PttLAX 3 and PttPIN 1 –PttPIN 3, belonging to the AUX 1 -like family of influx and PIN 1 -like efflux carriers, respectively. Analysis of PttLAX and PttPIN expression suggests that specific positions in a concentration gradient of the hormone are associated with different stages of vascular cambium development and expression of specific members of the auxin transport gene families. We were also able demonstrate positive feedback of auxin on polar auxin transport genes. Entry into dormancy {{at the end of}} a growing season leads to a loss of auxin transport capacity, paralleled by reduced expression of PttLAX and PttPIN genes. Furthermore, data from field experiments show that production of the molecular components of the auxin transport machinery is governed by environmental controls. Our findings collectively demonstrate that trees have developed mechanisms to modulate auxin transport in the vascular meristem in response to developmental and environmental cues...|$|E
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of the transport process of the water-soluble vitamin biotin across the basolateral membrane (BLM) of rat intestine, i. e. the exit of biotin from rat enterocyte, were examined using established BLM vesicles (BLMV) techniques. Results of osmolarity and temperature {{studies have indicated that}} the majority of biotin taken up by these vesicles is the result of transport of the vitamin into the intravesicular spaces, with little membrane binding. Transport of biotin in these vesicles was found to be: (1) higher in BLMV of the jejunum than those isolated simultaneously from the ileum, (2) Na(+) -independent in nature, (3) saturable as a function of concentration, with an apparent Km of 3. 51 microM and a Vmax. of 16. 49 pmol/ 10 s per mg of protein, (4) inhibited by high concentrations of unlabelled biotin and its related compounds, but not by the unrelated taurocholate, (5) sensitive to the anion transport inhibitors 4, 4 '-diisothiocyanatostilbene- 2, 2 '-disulphonic acid (DIDS) and 4 -acetamido- 4 -isothiocyanostilbene- 2, 2 '-disulphonic acid (SITS), and (6) not affected by imposing a positive or a negative intravesicular space {{with the use of a}} valinomycin-induced K+ diffusion potential. Based on these findings, it is concluded that biotin transport across the rat intestinal BLM is mediated via a <b>specialized</b> <b>carrier</b> system which is Na(+) -independent, transports the vitamin by a process which is sensitive to the effects of anion transport inhibitors, and is electroneutral in nature...|$|E

40|$|Eukaryotic cells contain {{hundreds}} of proteins that require iron cofactors for activity. These iron enzymes {{are located in}} essentially every subcellular compartment; thus, iron cofactors must travel to every compartment in the cell. Iron cofactors exist in three basic forms: Heme, iron-sulfur clusters, and simple iron ions (also called non-heme iron). Iron ions {{taken up by the}} cell initially enter a kinetically labile, exchangeable pool that {{is referred to as the}} labile iron pool. The majority of the iron in this pool is delivered to mitochondria, where it is incorporated into heme and iron-sulfur clusters, as well as non-heme iron enzymes. These cofactors must then be distributed to nascent proteins in the mitochondria, cytosol, and membrane-bound organelles. Emerging evidence suggests that specific systems exist for the distribution of iron cofactors within the cell. These systems include membrane transporters, protein chaperones, <b>specialized</b> <b>carriers,</b> and small molecules.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{critical}} problems facing the telecommunications industry {{is the extent to which}} competition will be introduced into what has been, for the most part, a regulated industry. In the forefront of the competitive environment has been the telephone interconnection industry. The genesis of this industry was the Carterfone decision by the Federal Communications Commission which allowed competition in the interconnection field. It is the thesis of this project that the most significant factor affecting the telephone interconnection industry today is the continued impact of competition on the industry. To insure that the project stayed within manageable limits the authors chose to examine the issues dealing with that part of the interconnect industry providing for the connection of answering devices, acoustic couplers, personal custom telephones, intercom systems, key business systems, or private branch exchanges (PBX) to the telephone system. Issues surrounding the competitive interconnect services of microwave and satellite links provided by the <b>specialized</b> common <b>carriers</b> are beyond the scope of this project. The <b>specialized</b> common <b>carrier</b> area is a critical issue on its own right and should be the subject of investigation by future participants in the Telecommunications Program. An analysis of present, past and potential interconnect manufacturers is provided to show how the lure and promise of competition has affected the industry. Because there are hundreds of companies involved in the manufacture and marketing of interconnect devices, only a limited cross section has been chosen for this project...|$|R
