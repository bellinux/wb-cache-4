Notably, the Southern Branch of the river at Money Point had become a 35-acre biological dead-zone with a nearly entirely lifeless river floor.

30|$|A similar {{observation}} {{was noted}} at Teluk Kemang {{in a separate}} study where {{a portion of the}} beach in the main bathing area receiving direct <b>storm</b> <b>water</b> <b>discharge</b> had significantly higher loads of antibiotic resistant bacteria as compared to other bathing sites not directly receiving pollution loadings from the stormwater discharge pipes. Obviously from our clustering results, three of the beaches (Tok Bali, Sri 7 and Kualar Besar) had sampling sites grouped in more than one cluster as opposed to a situation where all sampling sites on the same beach are clustered in a group. This observation supports the dynamic nature of microbial loadings in beaches. It should thus be noted for studies that will emerge in the future, sampling spots that do not representatively cover the entire length of any beach in question may be far from presenting an accurate picture of the overall quality of the beach. It is also recommended that future strategies for BQM in Malaysia should include a zoning strategy for individual beaches such that each zone of a beach in question is classified based on the potential pollution input and associated level of threat or risk to public health. With this system in place, bathers are able to make an informed choice on which portion of the beach to bath. Although factors that drive bathers preference for bathing sites within a beach is albeit complex and subjective, from physical observation of beaches in Malaysia, it could be noted that bathers on arriving at a designated beach generally would make a choice on which portion of the beach to bathe based on nearness to amenities such as food stalls, relaxation tents, speed boats etc. In a previous study, the section of Teluk Kemang beach with intense recreational activity is also very close to a <b>storm</b> <b>water</b> <b>discharge</b> pipe.
