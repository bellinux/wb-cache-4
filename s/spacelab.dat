5|$|On 20 {{missions}} (1983–98) the Space Shuttle carried <b>Spacelab,</b> {{designed in}} cooperation with the European Space Agency (ESA). <b>Spacelab</b> was not designed for independent orbital flight, but remained in the Shuttle's cargo bay as the astronauts entered and left it through an airlock. Another famous series of missions were the launch and later successful repair of the Hubble Space Telescope in 1990 and 1993, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The {{mission was}} also {{scheduled}} {{to carry out}} a series of tests with the TDRS-1 satellite which had been deployed by STS-6, to ensure the system was fully operational before it was used to support the <b>Spacelab</b> 1 program on the upcoming STS-9 flight. The orbiter furthermore carried equipment to allow for encrypted transmissions, to be tested for use in future classified missions.|$|E
5|$|Van den Berg was {{assigned}} as Payload Specialist on STS-51B Challenger (April 29–May 6, 1985). STS-51B, the Spacelab-3 mission, was launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, {{and returned to}} land at Edwards Air Force Base, California. It was the first operational <b>Spacelab</b> mission. The seven-man crew aboard Challenger conducted investigations into crystal growth, drop dynamics leading to containerless material processing, atmospheric trace gas spectroscopy, solar and planetary atmospheric simulation, cosmic rays, and laboratory-animal and human medical monitoring.|$|E

5|$|Four Getaway Special {{payloads}} were carried. One {{studied the}} effects of cosmic rays on electronic equipment. The second studied {{the effect of the}} gas environment around the orbiter using ultraviolet absorption measurements, as a precursor to ultraviolet equipment being designed for <b>Spacelab</b> 2. A third, sponsored by the Japanese Asahi Shimbun newspaper, tried to use water vapor in two tanks to create snow crystals. This was a second attempt at an experiment first flown on STS-6, which had had to be redesigned after the water in the tanks froze solid. The last was similar to an experiment flown on STS-3, and studied the ambient levels of atomic oxygen by measuring the rates at which small carbon and osmium wafers oxidized.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{objectives}} of STS-71, launched on June 27, {{called for the}} Space Shuttle Atlantis to rendezvous and perform the first docking between an American Space Shuttle and the station. On June 29, Atlantis successfully docked with Mir, becoming the first US spacecraft to dock with a Russian spacecraft since the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project in 1975. Atlantis delivered Cosmonauts Anatoly Solovyev and Nikolai Budarin, who would form the expedition EO-19 crew, and retrieved Astronaut Norman Thagard and Cosmonauts Vladimir Dezhurov and Gennady Strekalov of the expedition EO-18 crew. Atlantis also carried out on-orbit joint US-Russian life sciences investigations aboard a <b>Spacelab</b> module and performed a logistical resupply of the station.|$|E
25|$|Millie Hughes-Fulford (Ph.D. 1972), NASA {{astronaut}} {{who studied}} osteoporosis. She flew aboard STS-40 <b>Spacelab</b> Life Sciences (SLS 1) in June 1991, the first <b>Spacelab</b> mission dedicated to biomedical studies. She {{was the first}} civilian scientist on a space mission.|$|E
40|$|To predict blood {{pressure}} outside the clinic from a short-term in-hospital registration for patients referred for ambulatory {{blood pressure}} monitoring (ABPM) with {{special attention to}} office hypertension. A series of measurements of blood pressure was performed by the same technician for 187 patients, 82 % of whom were being administered antihypertensive therapy. She performed three mercury measurements of blood pressure (Hg stress 1) and then three manually started measurements with a semi-automatic device (Dinamap 1846 SX; Dinamap stress) alternated with three manually started readings with a <b>SpaceLabs</b> 90207 monitor (<b>SpaceLabs</b> stress) on the contralateral non-dominant arm. The in-hospital session was continued with 15 automatic Dinamap registrations at 2 min intervals without the technician being present (Dinamap unstressed, five periods of three measurements averaged) before the patient left the hospital for 24 h ABPM. The percentages of patients with hypertension in the office (systolic blood pressure >/= 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure >/= 90 mmHg, or both) were 80 % with Hg stress 1, 76 % with Dinamap stress and 85. 0 % with <b>SpaceLabs</b> stress. Average diastolic <b>SpaceLabs</b> stress was 6. 0 +/- 5. 6 mmHg (significantly) higher than diastolic Dinamap stress, whereas the difference between systolic blood pressures was 0. 2 +/- 10. 0 mmHg. No further {{change in blood pressure}} occurred after the fourth period of Dinamap unstressed measurements. Office hypertension defined as <b>SpaceLabs</b> stress systolic blood pressure >/= 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure >/= 90 mmHg, or both, and <b>SpaceLabs</b> daytime systolic blood pressure < 135 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure < 85 mmHg was found in 21 individuals. Office hypertension defined with similar cut-off points in the comparison of Dinamap stress versus Dinamap unstressed period 5 was found in 29 cases, 10 of which overlapped with the definition <b>SpaceLabs</b> stress versus <b>SpaceLabs</b> daytime. The differences between Dinamap stress and Dinamap unstressed period 5 were significantly correlated to the changes of <b>SpaceLabs</b> stress and <b>SpaceLabs</b> daytime both for systolic (r = 0. 41) and for diastolic (r = 0. 32) blood pressures. Measurements of blood pressure in the office with various techniques (mercury, Dinamap and <b>SpaceLabs)</b> are not equivalent. Office hypertension cannot be reliably predicted from a short-term semi-automatic in-hospital registration of blood pressure with a Dinamap devic...|$|R

25|$|Because Chrétien did {{not officially}} fly into space as an ESA {{astronaut}}, {{but rather as}} a member of the French CNES astronaut corps, the German Ulf Merbold is considered the first ESA astronaut to fly into space. He participated in the STS-9 Space Shuttle mission that included the first use of the European-built <b>Spacelab</b> in 1983. STS-9 marked the beginning of an extensive ESA/NASA joint partnership that included dozens of space flights of ESA astronauts in the following years. Some of these missions with <b>Spacelab</b> were fully funded and organizationally and scientifically controlled by ESA (such as two missions by Germany and one by Japan) with European astronauts as full crew members rather than guests on board. Beside paying for <b>Spacelab</b> flights and seats on the shuttles, ESA continued its human space flight co-operation with the Soviet Union and later Russia, including numerous visits to Mir.|$|E
25|$|Pletser {{was invited}} to {{participate}} in several other campaigns. In 1992, he participated in a DLR campaign aboard the NASA’s KC-135/930 in Houston to train German astronauts on AFPM operations prior to the <b>Spacelab</b> D2 - STS-55 mission.|$|E
25|$|In January 1995, he {{was officially}} {{presented}} by Belgium as a Payload Specialist astronaut candidate for NASA’s Life and Microgravity <b>Spacelab</b> (LMS) - STS-78 mission.

25|$|STS-61-A Challenger (October 30-November 6, 1985), was the West German D-1 <b>Spacelab</b> mission. It was {{the first}} to carry eight crew members, the largest to fly in space, and was also the first in which payload {{activities}} were controlled from outside the United States. More than 75 scientific experiments were completed in the areas of physiological sciences, materials science, biology, and navigation. During the flight, Dunbar was responsible for operating <b>Spacelab</b> and its subsystems and performing a variety of experiments. Her mission training included six months of experiment training in Germany, France, Switzerland, and The Netherlands. STS-61-A launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and returned to land at Edwards Air Force Base, California. Mission duration was 7 days, 44 minutes 51 seconds, traveling 2.5 million miles in 111 orbits of the Earth.|$|E

Since ESA's astronaut corps was formed, the Space Shuttle has been the primary launch vehicle used by ESA's astronauts to get into space through partnership programmes with NASA. In the 1980s and 1990s, the <b>Spacelab</b> programme was an ESA-NASA joint research programme that had ESA develop and manufacture orbital labs for the Space Shuttle for several flights on which ESA participate with astronauts in experiments.|$|E
25|$|Selected by NASA in January 1990, Chiao {{became an}} {{astronaut}} in July 1991. He qualified for flight assignment as a mission specialist. His technical assignments included: Space Shuttle flight software verification in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL); crew equipment, <b>Spacelab,</b> Spacehab, and payload {{issues for the}} Astronaut Office Mission Development Branch; training and flight data file issues; and extravehicular activity (EVA) issues for the EVA Branch. Chiao also served as Chief of the Astronaut Office EVA Branch.|$|E
25|$|STS-55 Columbia {{launched}} from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on April 26, 1993. Nearly 90 experiments were conducted during this German-sponsored <b>Spacelab</b> D-2 mission to investigate life sciences, materials sciences, physics, robotics, astronomy and the Earth and its atmosphere. STS-55 also flew the Shuttle Amateur Radio Experiment (SAREX) making contact {{with students in}} 14 schools around the world.

40|$|To {{determine}} whether measured differences between standard mercury sphygmomanometry and the <b>SpaceLabs</b> 90207 ambulatory blood pressure monitor in pregnant women remain constant during 24 h measurements. Repeated comparisons between standard mercury sphygmomanometry and <b>Spacelabs</b> 90207 were performed at nine predetermined time points during 24 h ambulatory blood pressure measurements {{in a group}} of ten pregnant women with various pregnancy complications, including hypertension. Individual and group differences between standard mercury sphygmomanometry and <b>SpaceLabs</b> 90207 were calculated for each time point. Friedman's ANOVA was used to test stability of differences across time. Mean group differences (standard deviation) between mercury sphygmomanometry and the <b>SpaceLabs</b> 90207 were - 2 (6) mmHg and 3 (7) mmHg for systolic and diastolic pressure respectively. For systolic pressure the differences between time points were not statistically significant. Although a statistical significant trend was found for diastolic pressure differences (P < 0. 05), none of the contrasts between any pair of time points reached statistical significance. For both systolic and diastolic pressure the minimal and maximal difference lay at least 10 mmHg apart in seven patients. Despite standardisation and training, a substantial within-subject variability of the pressure difference between observers and <b>SpaceLabs</b> was found in this heterogeneous group of women. However, a systematic time-related effect on this pressure difference could not be demonstrated. The pressure difference between both methods cannot be estimated with great precision.

25|$|In 1983, Columbia, {{under the}} command of John Young on what was his sixth spaceflight, {{undertook}} its second operational mission (STS-9), in which the <b>Spacelab</b> science laboratory and a six-person crew was carried, including the first non-American astronaut on a space shuttle, Ulf Merbold. After the flight, Columbia spent 18 months at the Rockwell Palmdale facility beginning in January 1984, undergoing modifications that removed the Orbiter Flight Test hardware and bringing it up to similar specifications as those of its sister orbiters. At that time the shuttle fleet was expanded to include Discovery and Atlantis.|$|E
