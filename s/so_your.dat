It was at a melancholy {{point in my life}} and the song reflects the yearning that was going on inside of me. It was like being in a situation but you want to break free and you can't, <b>so</b> <b>your</b> confined yet you're releasing those emotion through the lyrics and the actual act of singing. Thats why {{think a lot of people}} felt very strongly about that song, because the emotion is clear when you listen to it.|$|E

25|$|Given {{the proper}} {{environment}} and care, a Komondor is a responsible, loving dog. They are devoted and calm without being sluggish. As in any breed, there {{is quite a}} range of personalities, <b>so</b> <b>your</b> needs should be outlined clearly to your breeder. An experienced breeder can try to identify that personality which would be happier as an independent livestock dog, or that which wants more to please and would make a good obedience dog or family pet. Adolescence can be marked by changes in a Komondor's temperament, eating habits, trainability and general attitude.|$|E
50|$|The {{film was}} part of a lawsuit by Harold Lloyd against Universal Pictures.

500|$|Branham {{claimed he}} was baptizing {{converts}} on June 11, 1933 in the Ohio River near Jeffersonville when people along the bank saw a bright light descend over where he was and that he heard a voice say, [...] "As John the Baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of Jesus Christ, <b>so</b> <b>your</b> message will forerun His second coming." [...] The only available newspaper report of Branham's activities at this time {{was that of the}} Jeffersonville Evening News on June 2, which indicated that the Branham campaign reported 14 converts. Given the lack of corroborating evidence for this supposed supernatural event it is possible that Branham later embellished the incident by [...] "remembering" [...] the forerunner message when he was achieving success in the healing revival.|$|E
500|$|Palmer {{felt that}} the {{characters}} of Marston and Williamson represented siblings in their former gang, while Dutch {{was more of a}} parental figure. He stated that Williamson is envious of Marston, despite Marston being his [...] "moral anchor". Palmer also felt that, after Marston left the gang, Williamson's life began to [...] "tailspin" [...] uncontrollably. [...] "s John grew into a man who conquered by achieving, Bill fell into a man who achieved simply by conquering," [...] said Palmer. The character of Edgar Ross was partly inspired by lawyer and political activist Charles Joseph Bonaparte, while the in-game Mexican Revolution of Nuevo Paraíso was somewhat based on the Plan de San Diego. When developing other characters, the team was inspired by various historical figures of the 20th century, including Frank James, Pearl Hart and Tom Horn. In terms of the random non-player character (NPC) dialogue, Houser felt that Redemption sits between Bully, in which NPCs remember the protagonist, and Grand Theft Auto, in which NPCs are unaware of the protagonist's identity. [...] "here are countryside environments and people are to some extent bored so they're looking for thing to talk about <b>so</b> <b>your</b> actions get spoken about and people are aware of you more," [...] said Houser.|$|E
500|$|Shane Rangi as Asterius the Minotaur and Josh Campbell as {{the voice}} of Asterius. An elderly minotaur who aids Caspian. He is killed during the raid while holding the gate open to allow some of the army to escape. Rangi also stood in for Aslan, the Bulgy Bear, the Werewolf, another Minotaur, and the Wild Bear on set. Rangi played General Otmin in the {{previous}} film and Tavros in The Voyage of The Dawn Treader. He was able to see more in the redesigned animatronic minotaur heads, though [...] "in order to make the eye line straight and correct, you've actually got to hold your head down, <b>so</b> <b>your</b> view is only about {{a foot and a half}} in front of you, which still makes it a little bit hard". This resulted in Rangi knocking himself against the rising gate of the Telmarine castle, although he was fine and it was the animatronic head that bore the brunt of the damage. The costumes were still very hot, reducing him to a [...] "walking waterfall". Although a head sculpt of Aslan was used to stand in for the character on the first film, Rangi had to portray the character on set because Lucy interacts with him more. Rangi lost four kilograms wearing all his costumes.|$|E

How they met is unknown. From the {{available}} documentation, the assumption would be they {{met on the}} dock when she arrived in Singapore. However, {{in a letter to}} her dated February 8, 1942, Elbert wrote, [...] "Do you remember, dearest, the morning of your first arrival in Singapore, seven sweet years ago, when I pushed all the boats out of the harbor <b>so</b> <b>your</b> ship could come in?" [...] which could be either romantic metaphor, or a hint he was waiting for her there (the same letter mentions a clearly metaphorical female character he calls [...] "Elfin," [...] to which Elbert attributes much [...] "good luck" [...] he apparently thinks they had in the past).|$|E
2500|$|Lock {{screen is}} the {{simplest}} way to prevent unauthorized access your computer. [...] Since it is standard on most computers, it costs no extra memory or financial expense, but secures your computer so securely the FBI finds it difficult to gain access, let alone ordinary people. [...] Trying to control privacy and maintain parental controls within the computer without screen lock is like leaving the exterior doors of your house unlocked or wide open, relying on small locks on cabinets, drawers, closets, interior doors, (etc.), which your teenager or other intruder can lock-pick open at leisure away from the public view. Lock screen is actually more secure than common safeguards in life, such as locking your car <b>so</b> <b>your</b> child won't have a car accident which won't do any good if the child finds your keys, or a house-key while there are windows that can be smashed or pushed open for entry. If you do discover that the lock screen is not effective, then it is a certainty that you need to change your password to something less predictable, which is easily done, far easier than re-keying a car key or changing the combination of a physical lock.|$|E
2500|$|In the 2013 second season, a {{flashback}} shows that Hanzo and Bi-Han were childhood friends but driven apart by the mutual disdain of their clans. Two decades later, the Shirai Ryu and Lin Kuei {{have made some}} effort towards reconciliation, but Hasashi, while {{with his wife and}} son, encounters Bi-Han's younger brother, Kuai Liang, who provokes a fight and is killed by Hanzo offscreen. Hanzo and Bi-Han later meet to discuss the incident, and both are shown to be honorable men committed to maintaining the truce between their clans. Bi-Han swears {{that there will be no}} repercussions against the Shirai Ryu for Kuai's death, but after the events of season one, the resurrected Hanzo (now Scorpion) is convinced of Bi-Han's culpability in his family's and clan's deaths, not knowing that Bi-Han is not responsible and is instead incensed about the attack that he believes was carried out by his own Lin Kuei warriors. In the present day, Bi-Han and Scorpion fight in the Mortal Kombat tournament, during which Scorpion stabs his spear into Bi-Han's ankle. Despite Bi-Han's pleas that he was not involved in the death of his clan and family, Scorpion rips out his spine. This storyline was played out over the seventh and eighth episodes and filmed entirely in English. Dale, who has a background in kung fu, said in a 2013 interview with Nerd Reactor that the series [...] "challenge the assumptions that [...] have always been sworn enemies—we have new layers in their story and rivalries." [...] He said that after rehearsals, [...] "my arms and shoulders felt like they had daggers in them," [...] while the contacts he wore were [...] "cumbersome" [...] and that he was [...] "seeing through a tiny pinhole, <b>so</b> <b>your</b> peripheral vision is completely taken away." ...|$|E
