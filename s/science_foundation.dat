The Life <b>Sciences</b> <b>Foundation</b> came into existence in 2011, serving to document the stories of biotechnology's founders and increasing {{public awareness of the}} history of biotechnology through digital archives, hard copies of relevant historical items, and a free magazine. The Life <b>Sciences</b> <b>Foundation</b> subsequently merged with the Chemical Heritage Foundation in 2015.|$|R
