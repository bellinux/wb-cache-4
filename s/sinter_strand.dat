40|$|In the {{integrated}} steel industries the sintering process {{plays an important}} role furnishing raw material to the blast furnace. In this work, a computational simulation of the sinter process is developed that is able to predict the most important phenomena within the sintering bed. The model is based on the multi phase concept with multiple components described by conservation equations of each component coupled with the momentum, chemical reactions and heat transfer. The model validation was carried out comparing the model predictions with averaged industrial data and local temperature measurements within the <b>sinter</b> <b>strand.</b> The model predictions presented good agreement with the averaged values measured on the industrial sinter process...|$|E
40|$|With the {{formation}} of melt, {{the structure of a}} sintering bed transforms because of material coalescence. The drivers of coalescence were studied using two bench-scale techniques. Analogue sinter mixes of varying the basicity and gangue levels were taken to high temperatures using thermomechanical analysis (TMA) and in an ash fusion test (AFT). In TMA, the penetration of a piston into the sinter mix as melt was generated provided information on the deformation, shrinkage, densification and flow of the sample as a function of temperature. Projected sample shapes in the AFT were used to determine sample density and densification level. A computer model FactSage and reported equations were used to provide estimates of melt volume and viscosity. Trends indicated by the TMA and AFT results were similar and large changes in results were only obtained with significant melt generation. Differences in results between the samples could not always be explained because varying the composition of the sinter mix altered the porosity of the sample. Increasing sample porosity meant that the generated melts were not as connected and more work is required to achieve the same level of densification. On a <b>sinter</b> <b>strand,</b> coalescence occurs under a normal load and this effect is simulated in the TMA. However, the excessive flow of melt from the crucible and chemical reactions means that TMA results are unreliable at temperatures greater than 1300 °C. For this reason, the AFT is the preferred technique to understand the factors that cause material coalescence on a <b>sinter</b> <b>strand...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{processing}} of iron-ore to form sinter {{is a complex}} metallurgical process carried out on a moving grate. The production rate of good quality sinter is affected by significant variations in {{the properties of the}} raw input materials and in operating conditions. I large production units the emphasis is on overall steadiness of the process and the <b>sinter</b> <b>strand</b> is driven at constant speed for long periods. In principle, the efficiency of the process can be improved by manipulating the strand speed, but the control problem is complicated by the high order of time delay involved in the system. The paper presents a case for the application of multi-step prediction methods which can provide the operator with advance information on waste-gas variation and guide his action in adjusting strand speed...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of the sintering process can be increased by means of various procedures. One of the options is increasing the permeability of the sintering charge and improving the gas-dynamic conditions during the combustion.

40|$|The {{agglomeration}} of {{iron ores}} or fine-grained recycled high-grade iron materials {{is an essential}} part of the integrated iron and steelmaking process. The 15 European countries produce more than 100 Mt of sinter per year. However, environmental regulation is becoming more stringent, and therefore, sintering plants are under pressure to minimize their generated emissions, because they are the most polluting processes. Different possibilities have been suggested to solve this problem, e. g. using imported pellets or briquettes in blast furnace or to use EAF process. Such changes are very expensive and also delete the recycling route of the by-products, thereby creating an additional treatment or disposal problem. In this paper, different methods for minimizing emissions generated from <b>sinter</b> <b>strands</b> are reviewed. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{granulation}} process, {{which is}} determined by many factors like properties of the mixture and the operating parameters, is of very importance for getting a good permeability of the burden in the <b>sintering</b> <b>strand.</b> The prediction of the size distribution of the granules and the permeability of its bed by the artificial neural network was studied in this paper. It was found by the experiments that the order of significance in the granulation process is water content added into the mixture, the mass fraction of the particles of 0. 7 - 3 mm, and the moisture capacity. The water content added in the mixture and the mass fractions of the particles of 0. 7 - 3 mm have the positive relation to the permeability of granulation, While, the moisture capacity has the negative relation to the permeability of granulation. Both the moisture capacity and the water content added were used as the inputs in the model of artificial neural network, which can give a good prediction on the permeability and mass fraction of the granules of 3 - 8 mm, {{as well as the}} tendency of the samples under instable raw materials conditions. These two models can be used for optimization the granulation...|$|R
40|$|The {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the design of a feedforward control scheme aimed at minimising the waste product from a <b>sinter</b> <b>strand</b> process by manipulating strand speed. The results of simulation exercises are discussed in which the sinter bed is assumed to be composed of a series of lumped sections. The velocity of the flame-front within a section is assumed to be nonlinear and initially proportional to the raw-mix permeability. Permeability data from plant are used as input and strand speed and acceleration are constrained to lie within practically realisable limits. The results of simulation exercises using simple control laws based on straight and weighted averaging of ideal section speeds are presented. The proposed control law involves a technique for modifying the time-shift increments associated with the straight-average law. The reduction obtained in output waste from the strand when the new control law is used is clearly demonstrate...|$|E
40|$|Sintering is {{a thermal}} {{agglomeration}} {{process that is}} applied to a mixture of iron ore fines, recycled ironmaking products, fluxes, slag-forming agents, and solid fuel (coke). The purpose of the sintering process is manufacturing a product with the suitable characteristics (thermal, mechanical, physical and chemical) to be fed to the blast furnace. The process has been widely studied and researched in the iron and steelmaking industry to know the best parameters that allow one to obtain the best sinter quality. The present article reviews the sintering process that the mixture follows, once granulated, when it is loaded onto the <b>sinter</b> <b>strand.</b> There, the sinter mixture is partially melted at a temperature between 1300 - 1480 °C and undergoes a series of reactions that forms the sinter cake to be loaded into the blast furnace to produce pig iron.

40|$|An {{assessment}} {{was carried out}} at a UK integrated steelworks to investigate the exposure of workers via inhalation to dioxins [polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDD/F) ], polychlori-nated biphenyls (PCBs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) including benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P). Investigations focused on a basic oxygen steelmaking (BOS) plant and an iron ore sin-tering plant. The highest concentrations of PCDD/F and dioxin-like PCB were found at the BOS vessels and <b>sinter</b> <b>strand</b> area at the BOS and sinter plant, respectively. A risk {{assessment was}} carried out by comparing the daily intake of PCDD/F and PCB via inhalation with the recom-mended tolerable daily intake (TDI) proposed by the World Health Organisation (WHO). For the most exposed category of worker in this study (i. e. sinter plant workers inside the strand area), the estimated daily intake via inhalation was estimated to be 0. 25 pg WHO-toxic equiva-lent concentrations (TEQ) kg 21 body weight (bw). Considering that the average UK adult expo-sure to PCDD/F from the diet is 1. 8 pg WHO-TEQ kg 21 bw day 21, the results indicated that the estimated daily intake of PCDD/F and PCB via inhalation for sinter plant workers would not result in the recommended range of the TDI (1 – 4 pg WHO-TEQ kg 21 bw day 21) being exceeded.

40|$|PCDD/F {{data are}} {{presented}} from 75 samples of primary emissions sampled between 1995 – 1997 {{as part of}} the compliance monitoring survey undertaken by the UK Environment Agency. Municipal solid waste (MSW), chemical waste and clinical waste incinerators, cement kilns, sinter plants and sewage sludge incinerators were the source categories monitored and reported here. Based on this monitoring programme, the previous national UK emission estimates by Eduljee and Dyke (1) of 560 – 1100 g I-TEQ a− 1 for 1993 have been revised downwards to 220 – 660 g I-TEQ a− 1. Despite source reduction measures, MSW incinerators remain a significant source of PCDD/Fs to the atmosphere, contributing between 30 – 50 % of the ΣPCDD/F I-TEQ emission, rather than the 80 % they were estimated to contribute in 1993. 2, 3, 7, 8 -substituted PCDD/F congener profile data are presented for some of the source categories and generally support the view that differences in the mixtures (‘fingerprints’) of PCDD/Fs emitted from different sources are observed. New data on the dioxin-like PCB emissions are presented for cement kilns and sinter plants. These show that TEQ-rated PCBs can make an important contribution to the I-TEQ emitted from certain combustion sources. High concentrations of a full range of PCB congeners/homologues have been measured in the atmosphere close to <b>sintering</b> <b>strands,</b> although the precise source of PCBs from this process remains unclear...|$|R
40|$|A {{racetrack}} magnet, using Nb{sub 3 }Sn superconducting cable reacted before winding, {{has been}} fabricated and tested at Fermilab. It {{consists of two}} flat racetrack coils, connected in a common-coil configuration, separated by a 5 mm thick fiberglass plate. Synthetic oil was used to prevent <b>sintering</b> of the <b>strands</b> during the heat treatment. The coils were wound and vacuum impregnated in the mechanical structure. The turn-to-turn insulation, consisting of Kapton{reg_sign}and pre-impregnated fiberglass tapes {{as wide as the}} cable, was wound together with the bare cable in order to form a continuous inter-turn spacer. The coils were instrumented with voltage taps, temperature sensors, spot heaters and quench heaters. The maximum current achieved was 12675 A which is 78 % of the short sample limit at 5. 1 K (minimum temperature in the coil during 75 A/s ramp). Measurement of the temperature margin revealed a low degradation in the innermost turns. Quench performances at different temperatures and ramp rate effects have been measured and are presented and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Within the {{research}} project a computer supported metallurgical simulation tool was created, tested and applied. Models {{for the main}} units of an integrated metallurgical plant (<b>sinter</b> <b>strand,</b> blast furnace, converter) and for promising process integrated pollution control measures (circulating fluidized bed, hot briquetting, hydrocyclone, Inmetco, low blast furnace, oxygen cupola furnace) were created and then various options for residue streams in the plant were simulated. Of special interest were the environmental and process relevant elements zinc, lead, potassium and sodium {{as well as their}} compounds. This modelling method based equally on empirical knowledge and fundamental thermodynamical principles provides profound mass and energy balances. Based on the calculated data, a technical, economical and ecological assessment was made to support decision makers regarding investments in innovative pollution control technologies, which will become necessary in the near future due to decreasing dump capacities and increasing law requirements. The modelling method proved to be suitable for the problem and is going to be applied to other industrial areas (electric steelmaking, non-ferrous metal industry). The first steps to commercialize this tool have already been taken. Within the continuation project (5 / 1997 - 4 / 1999) the existing models are being supplemented and new ones will be created to achieve greater consideration of emission transfers between the environmental media soil, air and water and to improve the possibilities for their application and commercialization.

40|$|The {{task of the}} projekt was {{to reduce}} the {{emissions}} of particulate matter and heavy metals from a sinter plant. For {{the first time in}} europe a fabric filter was installed after an existing electrostatic precipitator on a industrial level. Technical measurements established a efficient reduction of particulate matter, heavy metals and gaseous inorganic compounds (HCl, HF). The operation of the fabric filter prooved to be a practicable dedusting process. Blinding of the fabric materials caused by oil aerosols and alkalines or corrosion from acid compounds in the waste gas can effectively be avoided by the dosage of slaked lime. An other target of the project was the examination of PCDD/PCDF - emissions and their reduction by the fabric filter. Measurements in the wind boxes underneath the <b>sinter</b> <b>strand</b> lead to different dioxin profiles regarding the length of the sinter machine with a maximum in the last third of the length. Calculations based on the discoveries established by the princip of EOS a maximum circulation of 33 % of the waste gas, a reduction of the PCDD/F-concentration due to thermal destruction in the circulated waste gas and a load reduction by minimizing the waste gas stream. Tests about PCDD/F-reduction during the dosage of carbon additives were also carried out. Depending on the dose point and the sort of additive in single cases precipitation levels of more than 99 % were achieved. With the installed industrial dosage system reduction levels of 90 % were achieved. (orig.)

40|$|Iron-ore sinter plants, {{according}} to {{studies conducted in}} the years from 1992 to 1995 by the steel industry and the German Federal Environmental Agency, generated during this period a specific PCDF/D emission of 1 - 4 #mu#g I-TEQ/t sinter and accounted for around 95 % of all the dioxin emitted in {{iron and steel making}} in the Federal Republic. Following theoretical investigations and extensive practical preliminary trials on a semi-industrial and industrial scale, various European sinter plant operators have joined together as a working group to test and demonstrate the practicability of the entrained flow process incorporating downstream catalytic oxidation. The demonstration facility was set up at a <b>sinter</b> <b>strand</b> with a suction area of 150 m" 2 operated by Thyssen Krupp Stahl AG in Duisburg. By adding lignite coke, a mean separation efficiency of 70 % and PCDF/D mass concentrations between 0. 13 and 0. 76 ng I-TEQ/m" 3 in the clean gas were achieved in the adsorption stage. Safety aspects received special consideration when the facility was built and the trials were conducted. The half-yearly trials using an oxidative catalytic converter revealed a sharp drop in catalytic activity, which was attributed {{to the surface of the}} catalytic converter becoming coated with hydrocarbons. The separation efficiency of the catalytic converter fell in the course of the trials from over 60 % (when new) to the point of ineffectiveness. It has so far not been possible to achieve the target value of 0. 1 ng I-TEQ/m" 3. The trials with other adsorbents to increase the effectiveness of the adsorption stage will be continued upon completion of the current project. (orig.)

40|$|Within the {{research}} project {{a system for}} the support of strategic decision called KOSIMEUS has been developed and prototypically applied. All unit operations of an integrated metallurgical plant and an electric steel works (<b>sinter</b> <b>strand,</b> blast furnace, desulphurisation, converter, electric arc furnace) were modelled with a flowsheeting system and simulated in combination with also modelled promising process integrated pollution control measures (hot briquetting, low blast furnace, INMETCO- and COMET-process). The method of problem adequate modelling, which was developed within {{the research}} project, is based equally on empirical knowledge and fundamental thermodynamical principles. It provides profound mass and energy balances, which are the basis for a technical, economical and ecological assessment. Besides the consideration of the main elements, the relevant substances for processes and environment as well as important elements for the product quality, the method allows a modelling of the predominant non linear process coherencies. KOSIMEUS has found its first prototypical application in a reference company, the Salzgitter AG Stahl und Technologie. In the application innovative concepts for the recycling of production residues were developed, simulated and extensively evaluated. It was shown, that the implementation of process integrated pollution control measures does not cause necessarily a rise in the specific production costs. With suitable technical measures the iron content of the residues can be regained in a recycling product like sponge iron and can be recycled within the process chain and thus reduce the consumption of other iron bearing input materials. Processing technologies like INMETCO or COMET can also enrich zinc in a secondary dust, which could possibly be sold to the zinc industry. Studies, which were carried out in co-operation with other (reference-) companies, show further promising fields of application of the developed method. For this reason additional areas of the process industry should be opened up for KOSIMEUS. Simultaneously it should be aimed at a expansion of the system for further planing problems, for example operative planing, the evaluation of recycling concepts including a company network or in the field of environmental controlling.
