During the velocity controlled trials on concrete, significant increases in Contact Angle occurred, as well as decreases in Stroke Frequency after training.

The camera space particle filter fuses the odometry and vision sensors information within camera space, resulting in a precise update of the wheelchair’s pose.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to design a height control system that {{could be applied to}} a Three Point Linkage mounted implement. Several methods of {{achieving}} this goal were investigated. The two methods that were investigated in detail were an electrical over hydraulic system and a mechanical over hydraulic system. The unique operation of the three point linkage implements when lift assist is used presents problems when accurate frame height is required, such as when seeding operations are being performed. The system has been designed so that it is constantly sensing the height of the frame {{at both ends of the}} implement. The output from this sensing is used to control a hydraulic valve mechanically or electrically. If a height discrepancy between the front and rear of the implement is detected, this valve will be activated to allow a flow of hydraulic oil to the lift assist system, levelling the implement. The investigation of the electrical control system involved constructing a prototype circuit that was based on a PICAXE microcontroller to provide computing power. This chip was programmed to read the output from two variable resistors and detect any height discrepancies. When a discrepancy was detected, the microcontroller activated a servomechanism that used mechanical motion to correct the position of one of the resistor to match the mechanical position of the two resistors, thus proving the concept of mechanical height control. The mechanical system was designed so that the output from two height <b>sensing</b> <b>wheels</b> was mechanically input into the hydraulic valve to actuate it when the <b>wheels</b> <b>sensed</b> that there was a height discrepancy.

5000|$|The VTM-4 system {{claimed to}} be {{different}} from other all-wheel-drive systems in that it [...] "anticipated" [...] wheel slippage, rather than waiting for the vehicle to <b>sense</b> <b>wheel</b> slippage, after the vehicle may already be in trouble. The VTM-4 systemconsisted of a pair of computer-controlled wet clutches in the rear axle that worked in concert with the front wheels regardless of road conditions. On start-up, the VTM-4 system would send torque (power) from the front wheels to the rear wheels to supplement the normal front-wheel drive mode. With all four wheels being powered on start-up, regardless of conditions, more tire adhesion is provided from four driving wheels rather than two front driving wheels. In the dry, this served to reduce front-wheel drive torque steer, and provide more front tire adhesion for cornering. In the wet, snow or mud, power to the rear wheels moves the vehicle from rest with a minimum of wheelspin because all four tires are working together to move the car, rather than just two front tires. If conditions are really slippery and wheel spin is unavoidable, VTM-4 instantly reacts by adding rear-wheel torque in proportion to both the slippage and the rate of increase of slippage. VTM-4 was also designed with a special lock mode to help extract the vehicle from a stuck condition, such as a snow bank. This lock mode automatically engaged power to all four wheels at low speeds. As speeds increased, the power to the rear wheel would decrease, and by 18 mph, the system would revert to front-wheel drive.|$|R

Delica also features the same selector dial next to the shift selector that allows the driver to switch between three drive modes: 2WD, 4WD AUTO and 4WD LOCK. Mitsubishi's skid-preventing Active Stability Control (ASC) system is also present. Mitsubishi has refined the Delica's four-wheel drive management software from the Outlander by increasing the proportion of torque directed to the rear wheels during uphill driving and reducing it during smaller steering maneuvers in 4WD mode because of the vehicle's difference in wheelbase and weight compared to the Outlander. The results are better hill-climbing performance and cornering stability. Also, in LOCK mode the system <b>senses</b> when <b>wheels</b> on the diagonally opposite corners {{are in danger of}} spinning without traction during vehicle operation at low speeds. By activating the brake traction control function at lower speeds than the system in the Outlander, Mitsubishi improved the vehicle's all-terrain performance at low speeds.|$|R

40|$|In today’s {{fast moving}} world, {{automobiles}} are facing challenges {{in terms of}} having to survive road accidents, increasing traffic, bad road-conditions and high/express ways. Brake systems {{play a vital role}} in controlling the vehicle speed while avoiding road accidents. The conventional brake systems consist of basically an actuator, transmission and frictional parts. This system is difficult for manipulated control by the driver during emergency and panic braking situations. In particular road and environmental conditions, it requires certain skill to have safe and effective brake control, which is always not possible from all drivers. Wheel locking is a predominant phenomenon during panic braking and this will cause vehicle skidding resulting in injuries and road accidents. In the case of a two-wheeler, being a single-track vehicle, skidding is one of the major causes for fatal road accidents due to loss in lateral balance. As the road safety regulations are becoming more stringent, the anti-lock brake systems (ABS) will replace the conventional brake systems in all road vehicles to avoid accidents and to improve vehicle safety. Early ABS systems, developed in the last 100 -years, use intermittent and cyclic brake pressure control by <b>sensing</b> the <b>wheel</b> speed or wheel-slip as one of the major control inputs. Regulating the brake pressure with a preset threshold value is another method. These ABS systems have used electronics, or hydraulics or pure mechanical control. However, such ABS are not widely used in two-wheelers and other low cost vehicles till now, because of several limitations identified as follows: High cost, power supply needed for its operation in the case of intermittent and cyclic brake control, susceptibility to failure in the electronics system, interference from RF signals (from cell-phones for example), uneasiness to drivers from pedal pulsations with pedal noise, heavier weight, increased vehicle vibrations and failure modes of wheels due to torsional vibrations. The present research work is carried out to develop a new mechanical ABS concept, which will address most of the above problems. During braking, the change in rider-input force will change wheel reactions. This change is made proportional to the change in rider input force only upto wheel locking. Such a principle is used to develop the new mechanical ABS. The new concept regulates the output force from the ABS, by <b>sensing</b> the dynamic <b>wheel</b> reactions with increase in rider-response. The ABS output force is regulated by one of the following ways: (a) Slipping-down the lever-ratio or (b) preventing the excessive brake input force. Based on the parameters like less number of parts, least weight, simplicity, reliability, efficiency, durability, time-response, etc., the second method (of preventing the excessive brake input force) has been chosen. Further a new concept of ABS interconnecting system is proposed for usage between the front and rear wheels of the vehicle. This interconnecting system will ensure that the two mechanical ABS systems function at any kind of braking-balance between the front and rear applications. An analytical vehicle model has been developed with several input parameters like mass, geometry, inertia, aerodynamic properties, frictions of road and bearing-supports, road gradients, etc. From this analytical model, the dynamic wheel reactions and limiting adhesion of each tyre for various braking conditions are determined and the results are used to design the mechanical ABS. The same analytical model is used to predict the brake performance like stopping distance, vehicle deceleration and the vehicle speed variation for ideal braking conditions. The new ABS is modelled in Pro-E using the inputs from the analytical model. To evaluate the concept, a functional proto-type is built and fitted on a motorcycle. The ABS is evaluated for its functionality and performance at different road (level surface, up-gradients and down gradients) and environmental conditions (dry and wet road conditions). Using the VBOX II, proximate sensors and load-cells fitted on the vehicle, the vehicle stopping distance, wheel slip and pedal force are measured. The results show that wheel locking does not occur under panic driving conditions, which is the primary objective. In addition, the results show a good agreement with the predicted stopping distance and vehicle deceleration from the analytical model. As there is good scope for this new mechanical ABS for use in two-wheelers and other low cost vehicles, further research is needed to make this system work in curvilinear motion & banked surfaces...|$|R
40|$|Terrestrial robots must {{be capable}} of {{negotiating}} rough terrain {{if they are to}} become autonomous outside of the lab. Although the control mechanism offered by wheels is attractive in its simplicity, any wheeled system is confined to relatively flat terrain. Wheels will also only ever be useful for rolling, while limbs observed in nature are highly multimodal. The robust locomotive utility of legs is evidenced by the many animals that walk, run, jump, swim, and climb in a world full of challenging terrain. On the other hand, legs with multiple degrees of freedom (DoF) require much more complex control and precise <b>sensing</b> than <b>wheels.</b> Legged robotic systems are easily hampered by sensor noise and bulky control loops that prohibit the high-speed adaptation to external perturbations necessary for dynamic stability in real time. Low sensor bandwidth can limit the system’s reaction time to external perturbations. It is also often necessary to filter sensor data, which introduces significant delays in the control loop. In addition, state estimation is often relied upon in order to compute active stabilizing responses. State estimation requires accurate sensor data, often involving filtering, and can involve additional nontrivial computation such as the pseudo-inversion of fullbody Jacobians. This perception portion of the control burden is all incurred before a response can be planned and executed. These delays can prevent a system from executing a corrective response before instability leads to failure. The present work presents an approach to legged system design and control that reduces both the perception and planning aspects of the online control burden. A commonly accepted design goal in robotics is to accomplish a task with the fewest possible DoF in order to tighten the control loop and avoid the curse of dimensionality. However, animals control many DoF in a manner that adapts to external perturbations faster than can be explained by efferent neural control. The passive mechanics of segmented animal limbs are capable of rejecting unexpected disturbances without the supervision of an active controller. By simulating biomimetic limbs, we can learn more about this preflexive response, how the properties of segmented biological limbs foster self-stable passive mechanics, and how the control burden can be mitigated in robotic legged systems. The contribution of this body of work is to reduce the control burden of legged locomotion for robots by drawing on self-stabilizing mechanical design and control principles observed in animal locomotion. To that end, minimal templates such as Sensory-Coupled Action Switching Modules (SCASM), Central Pattern Generators (CPGs), and the Spring-Loaded Inverted Pendulum (SLIP) model are used {{to learn more about the}} essential components of legged locomotion. The motivation behind this work lies largely in the study of how internal, predictive models and the intrinsic mechanical properties of biological limbs help animals self-stabilize in real time. Robotic systems have already begun to demonstrate the benefits of these biological design primitives in an engineering context, such as reduced cost of transportation and an immediate mechanical response that does not need to wait for sensor feedback or planning. The original research presented here explores the extent to which these principles can be utilized in order to encourage stable legged locomotion over uneven terrain with as little sensory information as possible. A method for generating feedforward, terrain-adaptive control primitives based on a compliant limb architecture is developed. Offline analysis of system dynamics is used to develop clock-driven patterns of leg stiffness and attack angle control during late swing with which passive stance phase dynamics will produce the desired apex height and stride period to within 0. 1 mm and 50 μs, respectively. A feedforward method of energy modulation is incorporated that regulates velocity to within 10 − 5 m/s. Preservation of a constant stride period eliminates the need for detection of the apex event. Precise predictive controls based on thorough offline dynamic modeling reduce the system’s reliance on state and environmental data, even in rough terrain. These offline models of system dynamics are used to generate a controller that predicts the dynamics of running over uneven terrain using an internal clock signal. Real-time state estimation is a non-trivial bottleneck in the control of mobile systems, legged and wheeled alike. The present work significantly reduces this burden by generating predictive models that eliminate the need for state estimation within the control loop, even in the presence of damping. The resulting system achieves not only self-stable legged running, but direct control of height, speed, and stride period without inertial sensing or force feedback. Through this work, the controller dependency on accurate and rapid sensing of the body height and velocity, apex event, and ground variation was eliminated. This was done by harnessing physics-based models of leg dynamics, used to generate predictive controls that exploit the passive mechanics of the compliant limb to their full potential. While no real world system is entirely deterministic, such a predictive model may serve as the base layer for a lightweight control architecture capable of stable robotic limb control, as in animal locomotion...|$|R
40|$|For my {{bachelor}} thesis I {{have chosen}} the topic Experience of Seniors with a Modern Home and Personal Technology. In the 21 st century is {{for most of us}} common everyday use of modern technology, such as mobile phones, credit cards, digital cameras and other technical devices. However, there is an amount of population who do not use these devices as much as the others. They are the seniors. In the theoretical part I drew from the listed sources and focused on explanations of particular terms which are related to the theme of the work. This part is divided into four sections. In the first section I focused on the explanation of the terms old age and ageing, in the second section I looked on the ageing in the 21 st century, the third section deals with the communication with seniors and the last section is focused on the modern home and personal technology. In the research section I focused on achieving of the aim and answering the research questions. The aim of the bachelor thesis was to find out what experience seniors have with the use of modern home and personal technology. As a research question I have chosen: What problems do seniors have when using modern home and personal technology? According to the topic, a qualitative research and the method of semi guided interview were chosen. The research group consisted of eight seniors from České Budějovice, who have been living in the Rest home U Hvízdala, the Nursing home CSS Staroměstská and in the Rest home Máj. I had prepared the basic questions and if appropriate I asked supplemental questions. The interviews were carried out in a pleasant background after the consultation with the social worker. Respondents agreed with the research and they also agreed with recording of the interview on a dictaphone. I recorded the interviews carefully and then evaluated them. The research was carried out in March. The results summarize the information which I took during the interviews. Despite their age seniors use modern technology. The most used devices are mobile phones, televisions and radios. Credit cards, digital cameras and sCards are among the less used or unused devices. Most respondents have experience with a radio, owned by everyone interviewed, then with a television, owned by seven out of eight respondents, and a mobile phone, owned by five respondents but others formerly also owned a mobile phone. The main research question should find out what is the biggest problem when using modern home and personal technology. Speaking about a mobile phone, seniors have the biggest problem when operating, caused by bad eyesight, small letters, small buttons or complicacy of a mobile phone. The biggest problem with credit cards is, according to respondents, a necessity of attendance at cashpoints. They also stated the fear of assault, misuse or loss of credit card and money. The main problems with sCards are similar to those with credit cards; attendance at cashpoints, misuse or assault. Another problem which I encountered is a lack of information for seniors. Some of the seniors have no idea {{what is the purpose of}} sCards. Television is for some a leisure time activity. The main problem here is a tune of channels. Addressed seniors stated that they would have to ask someone else for help. Another problem, as they states, occurs when setting of a television. Respondents have the least problems with a radio. The majority has no problems, others mention that the biggest problem occurs when operating a radio, for instance they have no <b>sense</b> for spinning <b>wheel</b> when tuning radio stations. Others do not have problems and the use of a radio sees rather positively. In conclusion, I think that it would be appropriate to introduce courses which would deal with a specific issue. It would be probably helpful to inform seniors more and to provide more articles, advertisements and lectures. The bachelor thesis could serve for others as information about the given topi...|$|R
