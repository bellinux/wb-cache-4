The global solar energy reaching the earth's surface can be calculated easily according to the change of latitude, altitude, and sloped surface depending {{on the amount of}} the actual state of the atmosphere and clouds. The high-resolution solar-meteorological resource map with 1 km resolution was developed in 2011 based on GWNU (Gangneung-Wonju National University) solar radiation model with complex terrain. The very high resolution <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> <b>map</b> can be calculated and analyzed in Seoul and Eunpyung with topological effect using by 1 km solar-meteorological resources map, respectively. Seoul DEM (Digital Elevation Model) have 10 m resolution from NGII (National Geographic Information Institute) and Eunpyeong new town DSM (Digital Surface Model) have 1 m spatial resolution from lidar observations. The solar energy have small differences according to the local mountainous terrain and residential area. The maximum bias have up to 20 % and 16 % in Seoul and Eunpyung new town, respectively. Small differences are that limited area with resolutions. As a result, the solar energy can calculate precisely using solar radiation model with topological effect by digital elevation data and its results can be used as the basis data for the photovoltaic and solar thermal generation...|$|E
40|$|The 2003 Mars Exploration Rover (MER) mission rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, {{have been}} {{exploring}} the Martian surface {{for more than}} two years (as of February 2006). During the mission, our team has routinely performed topographic mapping and rover localization to support strategic and tactical traverse planning as well as various scientific investigations. Topographic maps and localization data have been provided to MER mission scientists and engineers through a web-based GIS. This paper presents new photogrammetric techniques that are being used for the latest mapping- and localization-related activities. Among them is a bundle adjustment-based rover localization technology that has corrected wheel slippage, IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) drift and other navigation errors as large as 10. 5 % in the Husband Hill area of the Gusev Crater landing site (Spirit) and 21 % in Eagle Crater at the Meridiani Planum landing site (Opportunity). Detailed 3 D terrain models of major features, such as Endurance Crater and Larry’s Lookout, have been generated using multi-site or single-site panoramic stereo images. These models are being used as important data for geological analysis of craters and stratigraphy. Special products such as a north-facing slope map and a <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> <b>map</b> have been generated to aid in choosing north-facing slopes where the Spirit rover can capture more solar energy during the upcoming winter season. Comparison of bundle-adjusted rover locations with those seen from orbital images is also being conducted to verify the bundle adjustment results...|$|E

40|$|Renewable energy {{resources}} are those having a cycling time less than 100 years and are renewed {{by the nature}} and their supply exceeds the rate of consumption. Renewable energy systems use resources that are constantly replaced in nature and are usually less polluting. In order to tap the potential of renewable energy sources, {{there is a need}} to assess the availability of resources spatially as well as temporally. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) along with Remote Sensing (RS) helps in mapping on spatial and temporal scales of the resources and demand. The spatial database of resource availability and the demand would help in the regional energy planning. This paper discusses the application of geographical information system (GIS) to map the solar potential in Karnataka state, India.

When estimating insolation with satellite, we used a physical model to measure the amount of hourly based solar surface insolation. Furthermore, we also considered the effects of topography using the Global Land One-Kilometer Base Elevation (GLOBE) digital elevation model (DEM) for the actual amount of incident solar radiation according to solar geometry. The surface insolation mapping, by integrating a physical model with the Communication, Ocean, and Meteorological Satellite (COMS) Meteorological Imager (MI) image, was performed through a comparative analysis with ground-based observation data (pyranometer). Original and topographically corrected solar radiation maps were created and their characteristics analyzed.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Solar</b> {{radiation}} (Rs) <b>energy</b> {{received at}} the Earth's surface is measured usingclimatological variables in horizontal surface and {{is widely used}} in various fields. Domination of hot and dry climates especially in the central regions of Iran results from decreasing cloudiness and precipitation and increasing sunshine hours, which shows the high potential of <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> in Iran. There is a reasonable climatic field and solar radiation in most of regions and seasons which have provided an essential and suitable field to use and extend new and pure energy. Materials and Methods: One of the common methods to estimate the <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> received by the earthis usingtemperature variables in any place. An empirical model is proposed to estimate the <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> {{as a function of}} other climatic variables (maximum temperature) recorded in 50 climatological, conventional stations; this model is helpful inextending the climatological solar-energy estimation in the study area. The mean values of both measured and estimated <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> wereobjectively <b>mapped</b> to fill the observation gaps and reduce the noise associated with inhomogeneous statistics and estimation errors. This analysis and the solar irradiation estimation method wereapplied to 50 different climatologicalstations in Iran for monthly data during 1980 – 2005. The main aim of this study wasto map and estimate the <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> received in four provinces of Yazd, Esfahan, Kerman and Khorasan-e-Jonoubi. The data used in this analysis and its processing, as well as the formulation of an empirical model to estimate the climatological incident of <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> as a function of other climatic variables, which is complemented with an objective mapping to obtain continuous solar-energy maps. Therefore, firstly the Rswasestimated using a valid model for 50 meteorological stations in which the amounts of solar radiation weren't recorded for arid and semi-arid areas in Iran. Then, the appropriate method was selected to interpolate by GS+ software and after that, the seasonal maps of the received <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> over the ground surface were produced by GIS software. The best fitof the Gaussian model was determined in winter with the lowest residual error and the highest correlation 1. 87 and 0. 913 respectively, in spring with the lowest RSS and highest R 23. 87 and 0. 86 respectively and during summer with RSS and R 2, 5. 9 and 0. 851 and the exponential model in autumn withthe RSS and R 2, 3. 61 and 0. 88 [...] Results and Discussion: Naturally, some of the differences in the mean <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> among the stations may be related to inter annual variability rather than to differences in the climatic, radiative regimes. If different periods for the climatological estimations are used, the resulting mean values can be representative of the regional climatic regime of <b>solar</b> <b>energy.</b> The results showed that 53...|$|R
40|$|The flyby of {{the nucleus}} of the Comet 19 P/Borrelly by the Deep Space 1 {{spacecraft}} produced the best views to date of the surface of these interesting objects. It transformed Borrelly from an astronomical object shrouded in coma of gas and dust into a geological object with complex surface processes and a rich history of erosion and landform evolution. Based on analysis of the highest resolution images, stereo images, photometry, and albedo we have mapped four major morphological units and four terrain features. The morphological units are named dark spots, mottled terrain, mesas, and smooth terrain. The features are named ridges, troughs, pits, and hills. In strong contrast to asteroids, unambiguous impact craters were not observed on Borrelly's surface. Because of the relatively short period of this comet, surface erosion by volatile sublimation is, in geologic terms, a very active process. The formation and the morphologies of units and features appear to be driven by differential rates of sublimation erosion. Erosional rates across the comet are probably controlled by <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> input and the location of the subsolar point during perihelion. Differences in energy input may produce different varieties of sublimation erosional landforms. The terrains on Borrelly suggest that <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> input could <b>map</b> directly into erosional processes and landforms...|$|R
40|$|The Netherlands {{used only}} a very small {{percentage}} (6. 5 %) of self generated renewable electricity in 2006. Depending on fossil fuels on a large scale has numerous disadvantages on strategic, health, environment and climate grounds. A solution {{can be found in the}} use of renewable energy. Since the sun is -by far- the biggest source of energy, the renewable energy source that directly converts <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> into electricity (PV <b>solar</b> <b>energy)</b> is chosen as the renewable energy source to focus on for this research. Germany is world leader in PV <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> at time of this research and therefore it can be regarded as a best practice example for The Netherlands. The main goal of this research is to identify the success factor(s) for the PV <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> success in Germany. Once determined, the question is if these success factors can be implemented into the Netherlands to increase PV <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> use in the Netherlands and whether this is wanted or not. First a quantitative analysis is made of PV <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> use in both countries from 2000 till 2006. This showed that in absolute terms Germany used 63 times more PV <b>solar</b> <b>energy,</b> relatively Germany used 12 times more PV <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> than the Netherlands in the last year of comparison 2006. Comparing policies of both countries in the time span 2000 to 2006 showed that the German government is much more focused on PV <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> as a serious energy option than the Dutch government. This heightened interest of Germany in PV <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> is reflected in their policies, of which the policy known as the Erneubare Energie Gesetz (EEG) is identified as the specific success factor for the increased PV <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> use in Germany. The selection of the EEG as a success factor for PV <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> is strengthened since this policy contains all success factors for good policy which are long term planning security for investors, technology specific remuneration for green power and strong efforts in the field of power supply systems (grid extension, fair access to the grid etc.) Also in a broader context, the EEG is regarded as an example to promote PV <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> by third party policy makers. After the identification of the EEG as success factor, an actor study was made by interviewing eight actors in the Dutch PV <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> field to gain insights if an EEG is possible and wanted in the Netherlands. Actors were asked their general opinion about Dutch policy, their opinion about the EEG, and also their power to influence policy makers. From the data that was gained by these interviews appears that all actors see a big role for PV <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> in the future, 2050 and further, electricity supply of the Netherlands. The actors also agree that an introduction of a Dutch EEG is theoretically possible although some adjustments must be made. However the question whether this is wanted resulted in different opinions. Of the eight actors four are in favor of an introduction of a Dutch EEG, two are neutral and two do not want an EEG. Since the power of the actors is different and the opponents in this case out power the proponents, the Netherlands, until the day of this research, does not have an EEG like regulation that stimulates the large scale implementation of PV <b>solar</b> <b>energy.</b> It is interesting that the current sectors in the Netherlands that oppose a Dutch EEG were also the sectors in Germany that opposed the EEG introduction there. In Germany however politicians made the choice to put PV <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> on the <b>map</b> and started in 2000, in The Netherlands this choice has not (yet) been made by politicians. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{doctoral}} thesis is {{framed in the}} field of <b>solar</b> resource <b>energy</b> prediction as well as the selection of adequate photovoltaic technology for a semi-desert specific region (south of Sonora-Mexico). The research is focused on the development of a methodology for the development of <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> resource <b>maps</b> using Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models validated with weather stations data base ranging between 3 to 8 years data. In order to optimize the calculation time, without prejudice of the sensitivity of the method is proposed to use a type of solar irradiation year, selected by identifying the most representative days from a database of 30 years. In the study seven cumulus parametrization are compared, which establish convective effects that indirectly affect the solar irradiation and directly the formation of hydrometeors in microphysics parameterization. The convective parameterization New Simple Arakawa-Schubert was the most appropriate for the region in two extreme seasons (summer and winter). In addition, a third test was performed to determine the response of the model in an intermediate year season (spring). The precision of the results obtained is high in comparison to previous results given in literature. The goodness of the results allows concluding that the meteorological model, with the selected parameterizations, could be used to develop a database of global horizontal irradiation in the selected region but also in regions with similar conditions. Finally, an appropriate selection of solar photovoltaic technologies based on different climate regions is proposed. For this reason, a comparative study of different technologies of photovoltaic solar modules (monocrystalline silicon, polycrystalline silicon (standard technology silicon and UMG – Upgraded Metallurgical Grade silicon) and CIS -Copper, indium and selenium) with special emphasis on response on high and low levels of solar irradiation...|$|R

40|$|The sun is an {{ultimate}} {{source of energy}} for life on earth, and hence the knowledge of solar radiation is essential for hydrological, climatological, biological modeling and utilization of renewable <b>energy</b> resources. <b>Solar</b> radiation can be measured from ground instruments at meteorological stations. Installations of instruments that directly measure global solar radiation are quite expensive, and thus spatial density of instruments is low. For instance, in Ethiopia {{there is only one}} Pyranometer, which is currently not functional. In addition, unlike rainfall and temperature, solar radiation cannot be interpolated for other areas with any degree of confidence from few sample measurements. This is mainly because the solar intensity is highly dependent on topography and surface features. Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) are important to derive these topographic characteristics that affect the amount of incoming solar radiation. Estimation of solar resources in a complex topography and inaccessible areas, where measurements are not available and/ or costly to measure over large areas from DEM is fast, cost effective and reliable. Ethiopia is located in the tropics and thus highly endowed with an abundance of <b>solar</b> <b>energy.</b> However, exploitation of <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> is much underutilized and the energy sector is the least developed. The aim {{of this study is to}} calculate available <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> resources and <b>mapping</b> the most suitable sites for large-scale PV installations in Ethiopia. The monthly and annual global solar radiations of Ethiopia were calculated from 30 meter resolution ASTER DEM using the ArcGIS solar radiation analysis tools. Solar radiation potential of Ethiopia ranges from 0. 2 MWh/m 2 /year in the lowlands (peripheral area) to 2. 6 MWh/m 2 /year in the central highlands.
