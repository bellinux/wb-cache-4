40|$|Purpose. The {{article is}} {{aimed to develop}} a {{technique}} for calculating the magnetic characteristics of uncompensated traction electric motors (TEM) at any degree of attenuation of excitation based on the approximating expression for improved universal magnetic characteristics (UMC). It is also necessary to conduct an analysis of expressions for improved UMC {{with the aim of}} finding an expression that most fully satisfies the requirements for developing a technique for determining the inductive parameters of TEM. Methodology. It is necessary to determine the <b>saturation</b> <b>coefficient</b> for each degree of attenuation of the excitation for building the characteristics with the improved UMC. This can only be done analytically. To simplify the analytical finding of the <b>saturation</b> <b>coefficient,</b> the method based on solving a system of two equations is proposed, one of which is UMC itself, and the second one is a straight line whose angular coefficient is proportional to the <b>saturation</b> <b>coefficient.</b> Resulting values of the <b>saturation</b> <b>coefficient</b> for the excitation degrees β < 1 are essentially the coefficients of the shape of the magnetic characteristic. To get rid of the need to determine the coefficients of approximation each time in the calculation of characteristics a form of improved UMC is proposed, in which the magnetomotive force (MMF) of the excitation winding serves as the argument's role. Findings. Using the improved UMC it is possible to calculate the characteristics of uncompensated TEMs for any degree of attenuation of excitation. The accuracy of the calculation at β = 1 does not differ from that in the calculation for UMC, proposed by Prof. M. D. Nakhodkin. The same accuracy is preserved at excitation degrees that are different from unity. Originality. An analytical technique for calculating the magnetic (speed) characteristics of uncompensated TEM for any degree of attenuation {{with the help of an}} improved UMC is proposed. The analytical technique for determining the <b>saturation</b> <b>coefficient</b> for an improved UMC at any degree of attenuation of excitation is also proposed. Due to the introduction of an excitation winding as an argument, there is no need to determine the approximation coefficients for each specific TEM. Practical value. The developed methodology let calculate magnetic characteristics of uncompensated REMs for any degree of attenuation of excitation. On the basis of this technique, it is possible to develop a technique for determining the inductive parameters of the TEM, using the <b>saturation</b> <b>coefficient</b> of the machine as initial data...|$|E

30|$|Salt {{weathering}} {{is dependent}} on fluctuations in temperature and relative humidity (RH). The physical effect of salt crystallisation cycles {{will depend on the}} type of salt (crystallisation pressure), the pore size and distribution within the substrate, and the depth at which crystallisation occurs [34]. Very small pores do not absorb water, therefore water absorption characteristics, when combined with porosity and <b>saturation</b> <b>coefficient,</b> can be used to build a picture not only of the quantity of pores but also the pore size [35]. The resistance of stone to salt damage decreases as the proportion of fine pores increases [36]. When considering the characteristics of the tested samples, it would appear that concrete is the material most at risk from salt damage, as it has the highest <b>saturation</b> <b>coefficient</b> and a relatively low absorption. Concrete is an aggregate material however which makes this interpretation less reliable than it would be for natural stone. Of the materials tested (Table  2) brick {{is by far the most}} porous yet has a <b>saturation</b> <b>coefficient</b> similar to the other materials, suggesting that many of its pore spaces are large and not likely to be affected by salt crystallisation pressure.|$|E

40|$|To {{outline the}} {{concepts}} involved in optimizing antibacterial dosing in critically ill patients with {{acute renal failure}} undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), provide a strategy for optimizing dosing, and summarize the data required to implement the strategy. Data Sources: MEDLINE search from February 1986 to 2008. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Optimal dosing of antibacterials is dependent on achieving pharmacokinetic targets associated with maximal killing of bacteria and improved outcomes. The initial dose {{is dependent on the}} volume of distribution. Maintenance doses are dependent on clearance. Both should be adjusted according to the pharmacokinetic target associated with optimal bacterial killing, when known. The volume of distribution of some antibacterials is altered by critical illness or acute renal failure or both. Clearance by CRRT is dependent on the dose and mode of CRRT and the sieving or <b>saturation</b> <b>coefficient</b> of the drug. Both sieving and <b>saturation</b> <b>coefficient</b> are related to the plasma protein binding and thus may be altered in renal failure. Conclusions: Appropriate dose calculation requires knowledge of the pharmacokinetic target and the usual minimum inhibitory concentration of the suspected organism in the patient’s locality (or if unavailable, the break point for the organism), published pharmacokinetic data (volume of distribution, non-CRRT clearance) on critically ill patients receiving CRRT (which may differ substantially from noncritically ill patients or those without renal failure), the sieving or <b>saturation</b> <b>coefficient</b> of the relevant drug in critically ill patients, the dose and mode of CRRT being used, and the actual dose of CRRT that is delivered. This large number of variables results in considerable inter- and intrapatient heterogeneity in dose requirements.

40|$|AbstractSaturation {{discrimination}} {{has been}} reported to be affected early {{in the course of a}} disease. Our empirical data show a compressive curvi-linear relationship between opponent/nonopponent channel activity and saturation thresholds in normal trichromatic observers. This relationship can be explained by a model based on the Hurvich and Jameson <b>saturation</b> <b>coefficient</b> (1957), Psychology Reviews, 64, 384 – 404. The model considers effects of both selective and nonselective channel losses on saturation processing based on the assumption that disease produces elevated thresholds while maintaining normal psychometric response functions. Both the model and data support clinical observations of saturation losses occurring early in disease. However, the results also indicate that saturation may not be the best modality for monitoring long-term progression of such conditions. We suggest that the different processing characteristics for blue-yellow thresholds may yield added information for saturation testing under some circumstances and that saturation processing occurs at a higher cortical level.

An example shows how one can calculate alpha, alpha standardized and alpha max. Though statistical weighting of the items offers the possibility of increasing the internal consistency of a scale, the different importances given to each item should not be too far from a rational weighting based the nature of the items or other theoretical considerations.

The nonlinear effects result from vibronic transitions and cubic nonlinear-refraction. To measure the pure total third-order nonlinear susceptibility, we removed thermal effects with a frequency optimized optical-chopper. Our measurements of thermal-relaxation dynamics of alcohols, from 1560 nm thermal lens pump and 780 nm probe experiments revealed faster and slower thermal-relaxation timescales, respectively, from conduction and convection. The faster timescale accurately predicts thermal-diffusivity, which decreases linearly with alcohol chain-lengths since thermal-relaxation is slower in heavier molecules. The relation between thermal-diffusivity and alcohol chain-length confirms structure-property relationship...|$|R
50|$|The OPT model {{demonstrates}} that the sample grain of a study, sampling adequacy, {{and the distribution of}} species <b>saturation</b> <b>coefficients</b> (a measure of the fractal dimensionality of a species distribution) in a community are together largely able to explain the patterns commonly found in empirical occupancy distributions. Hui and McGeoch (2007) further show that the self-similarity in species distributions breaks down according to a power relationship with spatial scales, and we therefore adopt a power-scaling assumption for modeling species occupancy distributions. The bimodality in occupancy frequency distributions that is common in species communities, is confirmed to a result for certain mathematical and statistical properties of the probability distribution of occupancy. The results thus demonstrate that the use of the bisection method in combination with a power-scaling assumption is more appropriate for modeling species distributions than the use of a self-similarity assumption, particularly at fine scales. This model further provokes the Harte-Maddux debate: Harte et al. demonstrated that the power law form of the species-area relationship may be derived from a bisected, self-similar landscape and a community-level probability rule. However, Maddux showed that this self-similarity model generates biologically unrealistic predictions. Hui and McGeoch (2008) resolve the Harte-Maddux debate by demonstrating that the problems identified by Maddux result from an assumption that the probability of occurrence of a species at one scale is independent of its probability of occurrence at the next, and further illustrate the importance of considering patterns of species co-occurrence, {{and the way in which}} species occupancy patterns change with scale, when modeling species distributions.|$|R

The spatially varying absolute permeability is estimated by regularisation combined with a bi-cubic spline approximation.
