25|$|According to the {{official}} accident report, after the first officer made his initial rudder pedal input, he {{made a series of}} alternating full rudder inputs. This led to increasing <b>sideslip</b> angles. The resulting hazardous <b>sideslip</b> angle led to extremely high aerodynamic loads that resulted in separation of the vertical stabilizer. If the first officer had stopped making these inputs at any time before the vertical stabilizer separation, the natural stability of the airplane would have returned the <b>sideslip</b> angle to near 0Â°, and the accident would have been avoided. The airplane performance study indicated that when the vertical stabilizer separation began, the aerodynamic loads were about two times the loads defined by the design envelope. It can be determined that the vertical stabilizer's structural performance was consistent with design specifications and exceeded certification requirements.|$|E
25|$|The yaw string, {{also known}} as a slip string, is a simple device for {{indicating}} a slip or skid in an aircraft in flight. It performs the same function as the slip-skid indicator ball, but is more sensitive, and does not require the pilot to look down at the instrument panel. Technically, it measures <b>sideslip</b> angle, not yaw angle, but this indicates how the aircraft must be yawed to return the <b>sideslip</b> angle to zero.|$|E
25|$|The yaw string is {{considered}} a primary flight reference instrument on gliders, which must be flown with near zero <b>sideslip</b> angle to reduce drag as much as possible. It is valued for its high sensitivity, {{and the fact that}} it is presented in a head-up display. Even the most sophisticated modern racing sailplanes are fitted with yaw strings by their pilots, who reference them constantly throughout the flight.|$|E
50|$|The Libelle was {{a popular}} and {{influential}} design. Its light wings and easy rigging set a new benchmark. Handling is generally easy except that it is sensitive to <b>sideslipping</b> and has relatively ineffective airbrakes that make short landings tricky for inexperienced pilots.|$|R

50|$|The Libelle and Standard Libelle {{were very}} popular and {{influential}} designs. Their very light wings and extremely easy rigging {{set a new}} benchmark. Their handling is generally easy except that they are quite sensitive to <b>sideslipping</b> and have relatively ineffective air brakes that make short landings tricky for inexperienced pilots.|$|R
25|$|Concorde's Air Intake Control System also {{pioneered the}} use of digital data {{highways}} (multiplexed serial data buses) which connected the Air Intake Sensor Units that collected aerodynamic data at {{the nose of the}} aircraft (total pressure, static pressure, angle of attack and <b>sideslip)</b> and sent it to the Air Intake Control Units located nearer the air intakes using screened, twisted pair cables to replace a much greater weight in aircraft wiring had only analogue signal wiring been used.|$|E
25|$|When {{an engine}} on a multi-engine {{aircraft}} fails, the thrust distribution on the aircraft becomes asymmetrical, {{resulting in a}} yawing moment {{in the direction of}} the failed engine. A <b>sideslip</b> develops, causing the total drag of the aircraft to increase considerably, resulting in a drop in the aircraft's rate of climb. The rudder, and to a certain extent the ailerons via the use of bank angle, are the only aerodynamic controls available to the pilot to counteract the asymmetrical thrust yawing moment.|$|E
25|$|The Lavi {{employed}} a mainly traditional airframe, {{the majority of}} development focus being upon the avionics and systems to provide the aircraft's performance edge instead. In {{order to meet the}} low structural weight requirements imposed, the use of composite materials was employed in elements such as the wing and its substructure, as well as the fin and the skin. The forward fuselage was shaped in a manner that resulted in it naturally directing air into the engine intake and to avoid inlet blanking while flown at a <b>sideslip</b> condition.|$|E
50|$|On 11 August 1919, the Felixstowe Fury <b>sideslipped</b> {{and crashed}} into the sea 500 yards {{offshore}} soon after takeoff while on a test flight. It was preparing for an 8,000-mile flight to Cape Town, South Africa. The wireless operator, Lt. MacLeod, was killed, and the 6 passengers were rescued. The wreckage was towed ashore.|$|R
40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{model for the}} unsteady aerodynamic effects for use in lateral aircraft dynamics has been developed. The approach is to derive approximations to the force and moment coefficients based on Weissinger's arrangement for the trailing vortex pattern for a <b>sideslipped</b> wing.

40|$|Force {{tests of}} the static and dynamic lateral {{stability}} characteristics of a VTOL airplane having a triangular wing mounted high on the fuselage with a triangular vertical tail {{on top of the}} wing and no horizontal tail {{have been made in the}} Langley free-flight tunnel. The static lateral stability parameters and the rolling, yawing, and <b>sideslipping</b> dynamic stability derivatives are presented without analysis...|$|R
25|$|The {{investigation}} commission {{concluded that}} the accident {{was caused by the}} aircraft losing altitude, falling into a <b>sideslip</b> and descending into the ground, first hitting it with the right wingtip. The cause of loss of altitude was unknown, but could either have been part of a sideways banking maneuver or uncontrolled. The varying weather with pockets of good and poor visibility led the commission to believe that the aircraft could have flown into an area with fog and lost sight of the horizon. It reported that the accident took place towards the end of a very long flight and that fatigue could have reduced the pilots' faculties. This could be a decisive pivoting factor in the narrow margins while maneuvering at such low altitudes. The commission found no signs of technical error on the aircraft. It also commented that flying at low altitudes over the sea was common because of the lower wind speeds.|$|E
25|$|Heavier {{aircraft}} are more stable and {{more resistant to}} yawing moments, and therefore have lower VMCAs. The longitudinal centre of gravity affects the VMCA as well: the further from the tail it is, the lower the minimum control speed, because the rudder {{will be able to}} provide a larger yawing moment, and so it is easier to counteract the imbalance in thrust. The lateral centre of gravity also has an effect: the nearer the inoperative engine it is, the larger the moment of the working engine, and so the more force the rudder has to apply. This means that if the lateral centre of gravity shifts towards the inoperative engine, the aircraft's VMCA will increase. The thrust of most engines depends on altitude and temperature; increasing altitude and higher temperatures decrease thrust. This means that if the air temperature is higher and the aircraft has a higher altitude, the force of the operative engine will be lower, the rudder will have to provide less counteractive force, and so the VMCA will be lower. The bank angle also influences the minimum control speed. A small bank angle away from the inoperative engine is required for smallest possible <b>sideslip</b> and therefore lower VMCA. Finally, if the P-factor of the working engine increases, then its yawing moment increases, and the aircraft's VMCA increases as a result.|$|E
25|$|Reading {{the control}} yoke {{data from the}} FDR {{revealed}} that the pilots made a crucial error by pulling back on the control yoke throughout the dive with the stick-shaker audible on the CVR from {{the onset of the}} dive. This raised the aircraft's angle of attack, removed all aileron authority, prevented recovery from the roll induced by the rudder, and caused an aerodynamic stall. Because the aircraft had entered a slip, pulling back on the yoke only aggravated the bank angle further. Boeing's test pilots reenacted the fatal dive in both a simulator, as well as a test 737-300 by flying the same parameters on the accident FDR, and found that recovery from a fully deflected rudder at level flight, while at 190 knot crossover speed, was accomplished by turning the wheel to the opposite direction of the roll, and not pulling back on the yoke to regain aileron authority. The NTSB remarked that no airline had ever trained a pilot on the proper recovery technique for the situation experienced by the pilots and that the pilots had just 10 seconds from the onset of the roll to troubleshoot before recovery of the aircraft was impossible. The FDR revealed that after the aircraft stalled, it along with the crew and passengers were subjected up to a 4g load throughout the dive until impact with the ground in an 80 degree nose-down attitude traveling at approximately 300mph under significant <b>sideslip.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was taken to}} Filey on the English east coast for testing on the sands with B.C.Hucks at the controls. On 8 March 1911, after taxying for several miles, he made the first takeoff. He flew successfully for a while at about 30 ft (10 m) and 50 mph (80 km/h), but he <b>sideslipped</b> into the sands when attempting his first turn.|$|R
40|$|A {{computer}} program developed {{for determining the}} subsonic pressure, force, and moment coefficients for a fuselage-type body using slender body theory is described.

500|$|Resolving {{the problem}} with the guns had {{prevented}} the aircraft from undergoing its State acceptance trials in July 1953 as stipulated and a special commission was appointed to conduct the trials on 31 December 1953. [...] After the manufacturer's trials were successfully concluded in January 1954 the aircraft was turned over and the State acceptance trials lasted from 21 January â 15 March 1954. The tests were generally successful with the Il-40 proving to be easy to fly, maneuverable enough to be a handful for the MiG-15bis and MiG-17 fighters opposing it and considerably superior to the piston-engined Ilyushin Il-10M ground-attack aircraft then in service. However flight tests did reveal blast gas ingestion when firing in a <b>sideslip</b> by the engine on the side opposite the <b>sideslip.</b> Several solutions were evaluated to cure the problem, but Ilyushin pushed for the more radical solution of extending the air intakes for the engines {{all the way to the}} nose of the aircraft and moving the guns to the bottom of the nose, behind the air intakes.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} various {{vertical}} tail arrangements upon {{the stability and}} control characteristics of an XP- 62 fighter model was investigated. Rudder-free yaw characteristics with take-off power and flaps deflected were satisfactory after dorsal fin modifications. Directional stability was obtained with all modified vertical tails. Satisfactory rudder effectiveness resulted partly because the dual-rotation propellers produced no asymmetric yawing moments. Pedal forces in <b>sideslips</b> were undesirably large but may be easily reduced...|$|R
50|$|During {{a bombing}} attack on Corregidor, her gunners blasted away at three twin-engined {{aircraft}} winging over {{the eastern end}} of the island. One exploded between Manja Island light and Corregidor, and the other two crashed just beyond the minefield. Pigeon scored again the following day when an enemy observation plane made the mistake of passing overhead, then turned back for a closer look. Shells from Pigeon ripped into the enemy aircraft which <b>sideslipped,</b> lost altitude, and headed out to sea.|$|R
50|$|While the {{performance}} was generally good, the prototype {{could not be}} <b>sideslipped</b> steeply, and {{this resulted in a}} redesign where sweptback metal wings, with differing wing section, were fitted. When tested again, the Atlas was found to have lost its good handling, having dangerous stall characteristics. The Atlas had already been ordered for service, however, and suffered a number of accidents during takeoff and landing in {{the first few months of}} operation until modified with automatic slats and increased sweepback. This cured the poor handling.|$|R

2500|$|The crew at {{the station}} {{set out to find}} the {{aircraft}} in [...] of snow, and did not manage to bring the survivor back to the station until the following day. Four military ships were dispatched to search for the aircraft. Once it was found, Andenes and SÃ¸rÃ¸y returned to TromsÃ¸ and then took the investigation commission to BjÃ¸rnÃ¸ya. They concluded that the accident was caused by the aircraft losing altitude through a <b>sideslip,</b> possibly due to the pilot losing spatial awareness in the poor visibility.|$|E
2500|$|The {{final report}} stated that during a {{high-speed}} dive with a left turn, [...] "slight lateral-direction oscillations" [...] started on roll-out and grew in amplitude and frequency. The pilot attempted {{to correct the}} roll with [...] "counterphase input roll manoeuvres and then pedal inputs", but this did not dampen the oscillations. They instead became divergent, bringing the <b>sideslip</b> angle at 10.5Â°, well above the 4Â° maximum allowed, [...] "inducing contact of the right proprotor with the right wing due to excessive flapping of the proprotor blades". This severed fuel and hydraulic lines in the wing leading edge, triggering a fire.|$|E
2500|$|The stall {{characteristics}} are also relatively benign, being described by Flight International as [...] "probably the most docile of any aircraft I can remember". On the DA42, stall conditions are forewarned by the sounding of a warning horn at 5-7kt above stall, {{as well as}} by elevating levels of airframe buffeting and a 5â10Â° drop of the nose. The aircraft is relatively difficult to stall outside of substantial mishandling or deliberate intention. Both longitudinal and lateral stability can be maintained with a relatively low level of effort, not necessitating continuous trimming while the aircraft is accelerating. Active use of the rudder is necessary for effective turns and counteracting <b>sideslip</b> tendencies.|$|E
