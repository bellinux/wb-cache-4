5000|$|Early {{automatic}} transmissions, including GM's Hydra-Matic, Packard's Ultramatic, and Borg Warner's automatic used by {{a number}} of independent manufacturers (Rambler, Studebaker) used a pattern of [...] "P N D L R", which put Reverse {{at the bottom of the}} quadrant, next to Low which was contrary to the pattern used by other manufacturers. Drivers used to moving the shift lever all the way down for [...] "low gear" [...] would accidentally select [...] "R" [...] and would unexpectedly move the car backwards. In addition, other manufacturers, such as Chrysler, used a <b>push-button</b> <b>selector</b> to choose gear ranges. Ford was the first to use the [...] "P R N D L" [...] pattern, which separated Reverse from forward ranges by Neutral. Eventually this pattern became the standard for all automatic-shift cars.|$|R
