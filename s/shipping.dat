5|$|Ambrose Channel is {{the main}} <b>shipping</b> channel {{in and out of}} the Port of New York and New Jersey, making it the only means of {{accessing}} an important commercial port. Delays posed a major problem for <b>shipping</b> en route to New York City, and bad weather could close the Channel for days. Ships were forced to wait at the Harbor's entrance for conditions to clear. These delays cost <b>shipping</b> companies substantial amounts of money, with each ship costing between $500 and $4000 per hour it was stopped (roughly $5,700 to $46,000 in 2013 dollars).|$|E
5|$|By 1670, {{the city}} had 6,000tons of <b>shipping,</b> of which half was used for {{importing}} tobacco. By the late 17th century and early 18th century, this <b>shipping</b> was also playing {{a significant role in}} the slave trade.|$|E
5|$|Considerable Australian {{and other}} Allied {{military}} resources {{were devoted to}} protecting <b>shipping</b> and ports from Axis submarines and warships. For instance, the RAN escorted over 1,100coastal convoys the Army established coastal defences to protect important ports and {{a high proportion of}} the RAAF's operational squadrons were used to protect <b>shipping</b> at various times. Nevertheless, the use of these units for defensive tasks and the <b>shipping</b> casualties in Australian waters did not seriously affect the Australian economy or Allied war effort.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{vulnerability}} of the Australian <b>shipping</b> industry, the Axis attacks did not seriously affect the Australian or Allied war effort. While the German surface raiders which operated against Australia caused considerable disruption to merchant <b>shipping</b> and tied down Allied naval vessels, they did not sink many ships and only operated in Australian waters for a few short periods. The effectiveness of the Japanese submarine campaign against Australia was limited by the inadequate numbers of submarines committed and flaws in Japan's submarine doctrine. The submarines were, however, successful in forcing the Allies to devote considerable resources to protecting <b>shipping</b> in Australian waters between 1942 and late 1943. The institution of coastal convoys between 1942 and 1943 may have also significantly reduced the efficiency of the Australian <b>shipping</b> industry during this period.|$|E

The French firm CMA CGM, the Israeli firm Zim Integrated <b>Shipping</b> Services, and Maersk Line Limited, a subsidiary of the world's largest <b>shipping</b> line, A. P.

5|$|The {{alliance}} {{celebrated its}} first anniversary in August 2016 {{with a new}} joint operations center and continued growth in traffic, despite a drop in <b>shipping</b> caused by slower growth in Asia. Later that month, Hanjin <b>Shipping,</b> a major operator in Seattle, filed for bankruptcy and was barred from the Port of Seattle over fears of unpaid terminal fees. The bankruptcy sent the global <b>shipping</b> industry into a panic, with several Hanjin ships anchored off the Pacific coast awaiting approval to unload cargo. In December, Hanjin's Terminal 46 in Seattle was sold to an affiliate of Mediterranean <b>Shipping</b> Company for $78 million; the move was opposed by the Port of Seattle, who filed a request to block the sale over a lack of correspondence about the new lease and security deposit.|$|E

Under Mikhail Gorbachev's rule the Soviet Union became the largest buyer of new ships in the world.

5|$|A new route was {{launched}} by Bømlo Mayor Malvin Meling, who proposed a pontoon bridge which would cross Stokksundet. He {{was inspired by}} the plans to build what would become the Nordhordland Bridge north of Bergen. In 1973, the municipal councils of Bømlo, Stord and Fitjar decided to launch a planning process, which concluded that a pontoon bridge between Sørstokken and Foldrøyholmen would be optimal. The report also considered bridges across the Fitjar Archipelago and a crossing via Spissøy and Føyno. There were protests from Wichmann Motorfabrikk who were concerned about their operations if the sound was closed for <b>shipping</b> traffic. Similar protests also came from the <b>shipping</b> industry, who wished to continue using Stokksundet; the protests were not remedied by the plans including a suspension bridge across Foldrøysundet. To illustrate their point, one shipowner let two of his ships cross in the middle of Foldrøysundet. The <b>shipping</b> industry received support from Norwegian Coastal Administration and the plans were abandoned in 1974.|$|E
