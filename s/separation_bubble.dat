A surfboard fin with dimples creates a turbulent flow a fin without Dimples is more a lamina flow. Turbulent flow has more adhesion so when you start to turn, the dimpled fin surface delays the flow separation, reducing cavitation's (the <b>separation</b> <b>bubble)</b> allowing the foil to maintain performance. When the surfer is turning at high speeds, the turbulent boundary layer helps the flow overcome an adverse pressure gradient and allows the fin to remain attached to the surface longer than it would otherwise. This reduces drag, increases lift and improves overall performance of the fin design. a World Tour Proven Innovation that has set the path for 3DFINS as an innovator of Fins.

An earlier experimental study using hot-wire anemometry for a clean (no jet) NACA 2415 aerofoil at α = 8 ° shows a laminar <b>separation</b> <b>bubble</b> over the one-third of the airfoil upper surface.

The numerical study is in two parts: (1) a two dimensional time-accurate Navier-Stokes solver {{is used to}} simulate flows over the APEX airfoil, and (2) a numerical procedure is developed for localized simulations of transitional separation bubbles. The 2 -D computations of flow over the APEX airfoil show that the flow is unsteady with periodic vortex shedding. A linear stability analysis of the separated flow shows that the vortex shedding is caused due to the instability of the separated flow. For transonic flows over the APEX airfoil the vortex shedding is additionally influenced {{by the presence of}} shocks. The flowfield has two characteristic time scales, one corresponding to the vortex shedding and another corresponding to the movement of the shocks.

In the aeronautical world, laminar <b>separation</b> <b>bubbles</b> have traditionally been of con- cern for the aerodynamics of sailplanes and of small aircrafts. However, recent measurements stress their importance for commercial transport aircrafts in slow flight, where laminar bubbles strongly affect the flow on high-lift devices.
