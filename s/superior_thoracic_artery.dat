40|$|Objectives: The {{question}} of whether skeletonized internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> harvesting reduces the incidence of sternal wound complications {{in comparison with the}} pedicled technique, in the context of single or bilateral internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>arteries,</b> remains controversial. We studied the impact of the internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> harvesting strategy on sternal wound complication in the Arterial Revascularization Trial. Methods: Patients enrolled in the Arterial Revascularization Trial (n = 3102) were randomized to coronary artery bypass grafting with single or bilateral internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>arteries.</b> Sternal wound complication rates were examined according to the harvesting technique that was documented in 2056 patients. The internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> harvesting technique, based on the surgeon's preference, resulted in 4 groups: pedicled single internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> (n = 607), pedicled bilateral internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> (n = 459), skeletonized single internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> (n = 512), and skeletonized bilateral internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> (n = 478). Propensity scores weighting was used to estimate the impact of the harvesting technique on sternal wound complications. Results: A total of 219 of 2056 patients (10. 6 %) experienced a sternal wound complication within 1 year from the index operation. Of those, only 25 patients (1. 2 %) required sternal wound reconstruction. Pedicled bilateral internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> (odds ratio [OR], 1. 80; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 23 - 2. 63) but not skeletonized bilateral internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> (OR, 1. 00; 95 % CI, 0. 65 - 1. 53) or skeletonized single internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> (OR, 0. 89; 95 % CI, 0. 57 - 1. 38) was associated with a significantly increased risk of any sternal wound complications compared with pedicled single internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery.</b> Conclusions: The present Arterial Revascularization Trial substudy suggests that, with a skeletonization technique, the risk of sternal wound complication with bilateral internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> grafting is similar to that after standard pedicled single internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> harvesting, whereas skeletonized single internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> harvesting did not add any further benefit when compared with pedicled single internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> harvesting...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveWe {{compared}} sternal wound infections between diabetic patients undergoing off-pump {{coronary artery}} bypass surgery using bilateral internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> grafting or single internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> grafting and nondiabetic patients receiving bilateral internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> or single internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> grafting using a modified pedicled harvest technique of internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery.</b> MethodsThis retrospective {{study was conducted to}} analyze the data from 3072 patients who underwent primary {{coronary artery bypass}} surgery using an off-pump technique from August 2004 to October 2010. Of the 1211 diabetic patients, 181 received bilateral internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> grafts (group 1) and 1030 received single internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> grafts (group 2). Of the 1861 nondiabetic patients, 161 received bilateral internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> grafts (group 3) and 1700 received single internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> grafts (group 4). The incidence of postoperative sternal wound infections in diabetic patients who received bilateral internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> grafting was compared with the incidence in other groups (group 2, 3, and 4). A modified technique of pedicled harvesting of the internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> was done in patients receiving bilateral internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> grafting, and a standard pedicled harvest was used in patients receiving single internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> grafts. ResultsNo significant differences were present in the preoperative variables among the groups. The observed rate of superficial sternal wound infections in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 was 1. 1 % (2 patients), 1. 65 % (17 patients), 1. 86 % (3 patients), and 1. 65 % (28 patients), respectively (P = . 9941). Deep sternal infections were observed in 1 (0. 55 %), 5 (0. 48 %), 1 (0. 62 %), and 14 patients (0. 82 %) in groups 1 through 4, respectively (P = . 8380). Multivariate analysis showed that bilateral internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> harvesting (P = . 889), diabetes mellitus (P = . 96), and patient age were not predictors of sternal wound infection.

40|$|The {{present study}} investigates the {{incidence}} of anatomic variations of the responsible vessels of blood supply in female breast and autopsy material. These female bodies had not died of diseases hereditary or acquired that involved the anatomic structures of breast area. We studied 140 female bodies between 45 and 65 years old from August 2002 till July 2005. We have to mention {{that this is the}} first such study in Greece. A careful dissection of basic breast vessels took place in every female body. All the cases with emphasis to variations were studied and a lot of photos were taken. According to the literature the occlusions are as follows: Blood supply of the breast come from 2 main vessels, the internal mammary artery and the axillary artery. The first is a brunch of the subclavian and the second its continuity to the upper limb. Internal mammary artery supplies breast with four perforators to the anterior thoracic wall. In 42, 9 % only the second, third and fourth perforators were present. In 28, 57 % all the four perforators were present. Axillary artery supplies breast with three brunches which are the superior thoracic, the thoracoacromial and the lateral thoracic artery. <b>Superior</b> <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> was absent in 21, 42 % of cases.

40|$|Pectoralis major myocutaneous flap is {{regarded}} as the workhorse for reconstruction in many head and neck surgeries and was first described by Ariyan in late 1970 s. Mc Gregor and Reed in 1970 described the blood supply to skin flaps as axial or random. PMMC has both axial blood supply (distinct arteriovenous circulation along its long axis) in its proximal part as well as random supply (communicating vessels in dermal subdermal plexus) in the distal part beyond the pectoral branches of thoracoacromial artery when skin and underlying rectus fascia are included. Pectoralis major being a thick fan shaped muscle has origins from medial half of clavicle, sternocostal from manubrium and body of sternum with second to sixth costal cartilage and from rectus fascia. It is inserted into the crest of greater tuberosity of humerus. The fibers are directed from horizontal to oblique. The nerve supply is from lateral pectoral nerve which arises from the lateral cord of brachial plexus and is located medially and from medial pectoral nerve which is located laterally and originates from medial cord of brachial plexus. Lateral pectoral nerve is closely related to pectoral branch of the thoracoacromian artery and forms the neurovascular bundle. The arterial supply is from the pectoral branch of thoracoacromian artery, the lateral thoracic artery from axillary artery and from <b>superior</b> <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> to a lesser extent.

40|$|ObjectiveManagement of {{a patent}} left {{internal}} <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> graft during reoperation is controversial. The “no-dissection” technique avoids dissection and clamping {{of the left}} internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> graft, and myocardial protection is achieved using adjunctive systemic hypothermia and hyperkalemia. We compared the postoperative outcomes after isolated reoperative aortic valve replacement in patients with previous coronary artery bypass grafting with a patent left internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> graft using a no-dissection technique with the outcomes of patients with previous coronary artery bypass grafting without a left internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> graft. MethodsThe outcomes were analyzed for patients who underwent isolated reoperative aortic valve replacement with previous coronary artery bypass grafting from January 1, 2002, to June, 30, 2011. Patency of the left internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> was confirmed using either coronary angiography or computed tomography angiography. The patent left internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> group did not undergo dissection or clamping of the left internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> graft, and myocardial protection was obtained using systemic hypothermia and hyperkalemia. The no left internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> group underwent isolated aortic valve replacement with previous coronary artery bypass grafting but had no left internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> graft. ResultsA total 174 patients were identified for the patent left internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> group and 26 for the no left internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> group. The perfusion and crossclamp times were similar. No differences were seen between the 2 groups in operative mortality (6. 9 % vs 7. 7 %, P =  1. 00). The complication rates were similar, and the peak creatine kinase-MB values within 24 hours of surgery {{were not significantly different}} between the 2 groups (median, 27. 4 vs 29 μ/mL; P = . 72). ConclusionsReoperative aortic valve replacement in patients with previous coronary artery bypass grafting and a patent left internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> graft can be performed safely without dissection or clamping of the left internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> using systemic hyperkalemia and hypothermia.

40|$|ObjectiveThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the effect of arterial grafting on long-term coronary artery bypass grafting mortality. MethodsConsecutive coronary artery bypass grafting surgeries performed at a single tertiary care center between 1995 and 2007 were reviewed. Long-term survival was compared among patients according to the type of arterial grafts used: no internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery,</b> single internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery,</b> single internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> with other arterial graft, or bilateral internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery.</b> Cox proportional hazard models were generated to examine the association of arterial grafting with mortality. ResultsA total of 8264 isolated coronary artery bypass grafting operations were performed and followed for a median time of 4. 7 years (interquartile range, 2. 1 – 7. 5). A single internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> was used in the majority of patients (79 %), multiple arterial grafts were used in 24 % of patients, and bilateral internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> grafts were used in 13 % of patients. Patients who received multiple arterial grafts were more likely to be younger, to be male, and to undergo non-urgent surgery. After adjusting for these differences, patients who received bilateral internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> grafts were found to have a significant survival advantage when compared with all other patients, including those who received a single internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> plus other arterial grafts (hazard ratio, 0. 818; confidence interval, 0. 672 – 0. 996). Survival at 10 years was 71 % for patients with bilateral internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> grafts compared with 66 % for patients with single internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> grafts and 58 % for patients with no internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> graft. Patients with bilateral internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> grafts had significantly better freedom from readmission for acute coronary syndrome (hazard ratio, 0. 802; confidence interval, 0. 668 – 0. 963).

40|$|ObjectiveThe {{internal}} <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> is {{the gold}} standard conduit in coronary artery bypass grafting. Although {{the right and left}} internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>arteries</b> are excellent conduits, the use of the bilateral internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> is not widespread. A recent report of the Society of Thoracic Surgery revealed that {{only a small percentage of}} patients receive a bilateral internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> in North America. The aim of this study was to determine the current use of the bilateral internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> during coronary artery bypass grafting among cardiac surgeons in Canada and identify the main concerns that limit the use of these conduits. MethodsWe developed an online survey with 17 questions about the use of the bilateral internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> in different clinical scenarios. An invitation to participate was sent to all the adult cardiac surgeons currently in practice in Canada. ResultsA total of 101 surgeons (69 %) of 147 currently in practice across 27 different hospitals completed the survey. Forty percent of surgeons use the bilateral internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> only sometimes (6 %– 25 % of cases), 37 % of surgeons use the bilateral internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> very infrequently (50 %). The most common concerns in the use of the bilateral internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> are the risk of sternal wound infection and the unknown superiority of the right internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> over other conduits. ConclusionsThe majority of Canadian cardiac surgeons consider few clinical features, such as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus or morbid obesity, as contraindications to the use of bilateral internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery.</b> However, the reported use of the bilateral internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> is low. A wider diffusion of this technique is warranted to improve the results of coronary surgery...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: This report {{presents}} double axillary {{and double}} brachial arteries {{on the right}} side of an adult male cadaver. In this case, the right axillary artery bifurcated into axillary artery I and axillary artery II posterior to the pectoralis minor muscle. Both the axillary arteries with their branches traversed upto lower border of teres major muscle and continued further as seperate entities into the cubital fossa as brachial artery I and brachial artery II respectively. The axillary artery I which continued as brachial artery I was super-ficial and tortuous in its course, while the axillary artery II was slender and deeply situated. The thoraco-acromial, lateral thoracic and subscapular arteries took origin from axillary artery I. The <b>superior</b> <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> was seen arising from the thoraco-acromial artery. The anterior and posterior circumflex humeral arteries arose from axillary artery II. The profunda brachii artery was given off by the brachial artery II, while at the level of intercondylar line, the ulnar artery was given off by brachial artery I. In the cubital fossa, the brachial artery it divided into radial and common interosseous artery, while the brachial artery II ended by anastomosis with brachial artery I. The ulnar, radial and common interosseous arteries continued as separate entities and exhibited a normal course and distribution in the forearm. The hypothesis for the embryological basis of persistence of double axillary and double brachical arteries may be useful for experimental embryology. The knowledge of such multiple arterial variations as in the present case is of immense significance during Doppler scanning of blood vessels for clinical diagnosis and surgical management of diseases of superior extremity.

Among patients receiving a bilateral internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery,</b> both arteries were harvested in a pedicled fashion in 300 cases, whereas both internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>arteries</b> were skeletonized in the remaining 150 cases. ResultsCompared with a single internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery,</b> harvesting both internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>arteries</b> either in a skeletonized or in a pedicled fashion increased the chance of deep (1. 1 % vs 3. 3 % vs 4. 7 %; P =. 01) or superficial (4. 8 % vs 7. 8 % vs 12 %; P =. 002) sternal infection. However, the technique of artery harvesting (odds ratio, 4. 1; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 4 - 12. 1); the presence of peripheral arteriopathy (odds ratio, 3. 1; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 2 - 8. 5), and resternotomy for bleeding (odds ratio, 8. 2; 95 % confidence interval, 2. 0 - 33. 6) were the only independent predictors for deep sternal infection, whereas the technique of artery harvesting (odds ratio, 3. 0; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 6 - 5. 4), female sex (odds ratio, 2. 2; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 2 - 4. 2), and diabetes (odds ratio, 1. 7; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 0 - 2. 9) were the only independent predictors of superficial sternal infection.

40|$|ObjectiveCoronary artery bypass {{grafting}} {{with multiple}} internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> grafts is currently controversial. This study assessed single institutional outcomes with multiple internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> grafting for guidance with future clinical decisions. MethodsIn 19, 482 patients undergoing multivessel {{coronary artery bypass}} grafting (1984 - 2009), baseline characteristics were recorded in a prospective databank, and follow-up was obtained by questionnaires, phone contact, or National Death Index. Outcomes examined were subsequent myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention, reoperative coronary artery bypass grafting, all-cause death, and a composite of the 4. Three groups were defined: (1) no internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> graft (1874 / 19, 482 or 9 %); (2) single internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> grafts and adjunctive venous conduits (single internal thoracic artery; 16, 881 / 19, 482 or 87 %); and (3) multiple internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> grafts (728 / 19, 482 or 4 %). Multivariable Cox modeling adjusted for differences in baseline characteristics, and comparisons were performed using area under the curve analysis. ResultsDifferences in baseline characteristics for the no internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> graft, single internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery,</b> and multiple internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> groups were as follows: median age 66, 64, and 59 years, respectively; congestive heart failure 22 %, 18 %, and 13 %, respectively; ejection fraction 0. 50, 0. 52, and 0. 51, respectively; reoperation 10 %, 3 %, and 7 %, respectively; diabetes 27 %, 30 %, and 15 %, respectively; and female gender 33 %, 28 %, and 20 %, respectively. No differences existed in the median number of diseased vessels (3, 3, and 3, respectively) or number of grafts per patient (3, 3, and 3, respectively). Composite outcome improved with increasing internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> grafts, whether assessing unadjusted or risk-adjusted data. Compared with no internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> graft, the adjusted hazard ratio was 0. 79 (confidence interval, 0. 74 - 0. 83) for single internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> grafting and 0. 70 (confidence interval, 0. 62 - 0. 80) for multiple internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> grafting (both P < . 001), reducing risk by 21 % and 30 %, respectively. ConclusionsThis study confirms improved patient outcomes with multiple internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> grafting, achieving half again as much benefit as single internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> grafting alone. The data suggest that increasing application of multiple internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> grafting {{should be encouraged to}} mitigate the inherent risks and costs of long-term cardiac events...|$|R

MethodsIn 21 patients who had Y <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> grafts, the flow was measured in the main stem of the left internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery,</b> in the left internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> branch, and in the right internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery.</b> A transit time Doppler flowmeter was used. Measurements were repeated after the injection of a bolus of 20 μg/kg dobutamine. ResultsAt baseline condition, the mean blood flow was 44. 8 ± 24. 2, 23. 4 ± 11. 5, and 21. 4 ± 15. 3 mL/min in the main stem of the left internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery,</b> in the left internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> branch, and in the right internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery,</b> respectively. After dobutamine injection, these values increased to 93. 2 ± 49. 8, 46. 1 ± 22. 6, and 42. 5 ± 31. 2 mL/min, respectively. Flow reserve was 2. 1 ± 0. 6, 2. 2 ± 0. 9, and 2. 1 ± 0. 9 mL/min, respectively. ConclusionsIntraoperative injection of dobutamine increases the flow in the Y thoracic graft by more than two times, not only in the main stem but also in each branch. This finding attests to the safety of Y thoracic conduits in terms of hemodynamic potential...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveThis study {{assessed}} {{the safety and}} efficacy of off-pump bilateral internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> grafting in patients with left main disease. MethodsWe reviewed the records of 768 patients who underwent off-pump bilateral internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> grafting between September 2004 and June 2009. Bilateral internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> grafts {{were used for the}} left coronary system in all patients, of whom 268 had left main disease and 500 did not. We compared operative and postoperative variables and early and 1 -year angiographic patency rates of the bilateral internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> between the 2 groups. ResultsThe perioperative mortality and incidence of postoperative complications were not significantly different between groups. In patients without left main disease, the left and right internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>arteries</b> were used for the left anterior descending artery in 87. 4 % and 12. 2 % of patients, respectively. In patients with left main disease, the left and right internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>arteries</b> were used for the left anterior descending artery in 70. 5 % and 29. 1 % of patients, respectively. In patients with left main disease, the patency rates for the left and right internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>arteries</b> at 1 -year postoperative follow-up were 97. 0 % and 93. 2 %, respectively. In patients without left main disease, the patency rates for the left and right internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>arteries</b> at 1 -year follow-up were 97. 6 % and 91. 6 %, respectively. The patency rates of the left and right internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>arteries</b> did not differ significantly in patients with or without left main disease (P =. 9803 and P =. 7205 in left and right internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>arteries,</b> respectively).

Recently, we reported that chymase-dependent angiotensin II formation {{plays an important role in}} the development of intimal hyperplasia in dog grafted veins. In this study we investigated the levels of angiotensin II–forming enzymes, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and chymase in human saphenous veins and internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>arteries.</b> Methods: The saphenous vein and internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> specimens were obtained from coronary artery bypass grafts of patients during surgical procedures (saphenous vein, n = 16; internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery,</b> n = 16). Activities of angiotensin-converting enzyme and chymase were determined by using the extract from the saphenous vein or internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery.</b> Sections of the saphenous vein or internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> were stained with van Gieson's elastin stain and were immunostained with anti-human chymase antibody. Results: The activities of angiotensin-converting enzyme in the saphenous vein and internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> were 0. 34 ± 0. 12 and 0. 32 ± 0. 17 mU/mg protein, respectively, and the difference was not significant. The chymase activity in the saphenous vein was significantly higher than that in the internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> (saphenous vein, 10. 1 ± 0. 81 mU/mg protein; internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery,</b> 6. 21 ± 1. 86 mU/mg protein). Chymase-positive cells in the saphenous vein were located in both the media and adventitia, and those in the internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> were located only in the adventitia. The number of chymase-positive cells in the saphenous vein was about 2. 6 times that in the internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery.</b> Conclusion: The chymase activity, but not the angiotensin-converting enzyme activity, was significantly higher in the saphenous vein, suggesting that the high levels of chymase activity may be related to the poorer performance of the saphenous vein for use as a bypass conduit.

MethodsConcentration-contraction (normalized as force gram produced by each millimeter of the circumference tissue of the artery) curves for vasopressin with or without pretreatment of vasodilators and concentration-relaxation curves for the vasodilators listed were established in the human radial artery (n = 107) and internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> (n = 122) segments. ResultsVasopressin induced a greater contraction in the radial artery than in the internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> (1. 9 ± 0. 2 g/mm vs 0. 6 ± 0. 1 g/mm, P <. 001) with a higher sensitivity (lower EC 50 : − 9. 28 ± 0. 11 vs − 8. 91 ± 0. 05 log 10 M, P =. 006). Milrinone was less potent than nitroglycerin and nitroprusside with higher EC 50 (P <. 05) in both the internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> and radial artery. Pretreatment with milrinone and nitroprusside significantly inhibited vasopressin contraction in the internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> but had little effect in the radial artery. Pretreatment with nitroglycerin did not significantly inhibit the maximum vasopressin contraction in either the internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> or radial artery. ConclusionThe radial artery is more prone to develop spasm related to vasopressin than is the internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery,</b> and the effect of vasodilators in vasopressin-induced contraction is different in the radial artery from that in the internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery.</b> A more significant prophylactic antispastic effect of milrinone and nitroprusside is demonstrated in the internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> than in the radial artery. Therefore, more intensive antispastic treatment is necessary in the radial artery than in the internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> during coronary artery bypass grafting...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Objective: Composite graft of left {{internal}} <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> {{and great}} saphenous vein in revascularization {{of the left}} coronary system is a technique well described in literature. The {{aim of this study}} is to analyze blood flow dynamics in this configuration of composite graft especially in what concerns left internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery's</b> adaptability and influence of great saphenous vein segment on left internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery's</b> flow. Methods: Revascularization of left coronary system with composite graft, with left internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> revascularizing the anterior interventricular artery and a great saphenous vein segment, anastomosed to the left internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery,</b> revascularizing another branch of the left coronary system, was performed in 23 patients. Blood flow was evaluated by transit time flowmetry in all segments of the composite graft (left internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> proximal segment, left internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> distal segment and great saphenous vein segment). Measures were performed in baseline condition and after dobutamine-induced stress, without and with non-traumatic temporary clamping of the distal segments of the composite graft. Results: Pharmacological stress resulted in increase of blood flow values in the analyzed segments (P< 0. 05). Non-traumatic temporary clamping of great saphenous vein segment did not result in statistically significant changes in the flow of left internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> distal segment, both in baseline condition and under pharmacological stress. Similarly, non-traumatic temporary clamping of left internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> distal segment did not result in statistically significant changes in great saphenous vein segment flow. Conclusion: Composite grafts with left internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> and great saphenous vein for revascularization of left coronary system, resulted in blood flow dynamics with physiological adaptability, both at rest and after pharmacological stress, according to demand.

MethodsFrom September 2008 to October 2011, 224 patients with multivessel coronary artery disease were randomized prospectively to undergo off-pump revascularization using the saphenous vein group (n =  112) or the right internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> group (n =  112) as Y-composite grafts. Early postoperative (1. 4 ± 1. 1 days) angiographic patency and clinical outcomes were compared. ResultsThere was 1 operative death in the right internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> group. No statistically significant differences in postoperative morbidities, including atrial fibrillation and acute renal failure, were observed between the groups. The number of distal anastomoses using the side-arm Y-composite graft (saphenous vein vs right internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery)</b> were 2. 3 ± 0. 8 and 1. 9 ± 0. 7 in the saphenous vein and right internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> groups, respectively (P < . 001). A third conduit was used in 44 patients (saphenous vein group vs right internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> group, 4 / 109 vs 40 / 110; P < . 001) to extend the side-arm Y-composite graft for complete revascularization. Early angiography demonstrated an overall patency rate of 99. 4 % (771 of 776 distal anastomoses). Patency rates of the side-arm Y-composite graft (saphenous vein vs right internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery)</b> were 98. 8 % (245 of 248) and 99. 5 % (207 of 208) in the saphenous vein and right internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> groups, respectively (P = . 629).

The {{aim of this}} study was to compare the long-term outcome of single and bilateral internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> grafting with concomitant saphenous vein grafting for multivessel coronary artery bypass grafting. MethodsBetween March 1985 and April 1995, 6650 patients underwent primary isolated coronary artery bypass grafting with internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> grafts, including 4382 patients with multivessel bypass grafting requiring at least 3 grafts. Outcomes of patients undergoing single internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> plus saphenous vein grafting (n = 2547) and bilateral internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> plus saphenous vein grafting (n = 1835) were obtained at a mean follow-up of 11 ± 3 years. ResultsPatients with bilateral internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> grafting were younger, were mostly male, and had less diabetes, hypertension, unstable angina, and recent myocardial infarction than patients undergoing single internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> grafting. Thirty-day mortality was 2. 3 % for the group undergoing single internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> grafting versus 1. 2 % for those undergoing bilateral internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> grafting (P =. 007). Survival probability at 10 years was 88 % for the single-graft group compared with 93 % for the bilateral-graft group (P <. 001). Multivariate analysis with propensity scoring showed that bilateral internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> grafting decreased the risk of death (hazard ratio, 0. 74; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 60 - 0. 90), myocardial infarction (hazard ratio, 0. 79; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 67 - 0. 93), and coronary reoperation (hazard ratio, 0. 41; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 21 - 0. 80) throughout the follow-up period. Other significant predictors of death were diabetes, prior myocardial infarction, need for intra-aortic balloon pump, chronic heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease.

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{determine}} whether adding right internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> to previous left internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> bypass at reoperation increases deep sternal wound infection and hospital mortality, particularly in diabetic patients. MethodsReoperations (n = 2875; 2381 men) {{in patients with}} previous left internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> bypass were performed between January 1990 and January 2003; 1939 (67 %) had no repeat internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> grafting, 923 (32 %) received an additional right internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> graft, and 13 (0. 5 %) had bilateral internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> grafting with reuse of the left internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery.</b> Of the patients, 352 (12 %) were insulin-treated and 590 (21 %) non–insulin-treated diabetics. Multivariable logistic regression {{analysis was used to}} identify preoperative variables associated with right versus non–right internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> use in diabetics and nondiabetics and to formulate propensity models. Propensity scores were used for matching and adjusted multivariable analyses of deep wound infection and hospital mortality. ResultsDeep wound infection occurred in 3. 0 % (7 / 230) of diabetics receiving right internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> grafts, 2. 2 % (5 / 230) of propensity-matched diabetics receiving non–right internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> grafts (P =. 6), in 1. 1 % (6 / 538) of nondiabetics receiving right internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> grafts, and in 1. 0 % (5 / 538) of matched non-diabetic patients receiving non–right internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> grafts (P =. 8). Corresponding hospital mortality in these matched groups was 1. 7 % (4 / 230) versus 6. 1 % (14 / 230) for diabetics (P =. 02) and 2. 6 % (14 / 538) versus 3. 5 % (19 / 538) for nondiabetics (P =. 4). Risk factors for deep wound infection included higher weight (P =. 0003), higher New York Heart Association functional class (P =. 03), and less severe left anterior descending disease (P =. 03). Risk factors for death were (P <. 02) emergency operation, mitral valve replacement, and greater number of saphenous vein grafts.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundThis {{study was}} {{conceived}} {{to evaluate the}} effect of carbon dioxide insufflation on free internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> flows. MethodsWe studied 56 consecutive patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting in which the left internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> was anastomosed to the left anterior descending artery. The first 26 consecutive internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>arteries</b> were harvested as a pedicled graft (group 1), and the next 30 consecutive internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>arteries</b> were dissected by using the carbon dioxide insufflation technique (group 2). The internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> harvesting was performed by 2 experienced surgeons by using the same instrumentation and technique. First, free flows of the internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>arteries</b> were registered after distal cutting of the vessel in both groups. After the first measurements, diluted papaverine was sprayed on the internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> pedicle only in group 1, and then second measurements were registered after 15 minutes in both groups. Hemodynamic parameters were recorded with each measurement. ResultsThe first free flow measurement was significantly higher in the carbon dioxide–insufflated internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>arteries</b> (group 2, 60 ± 32 mL/min; group 1, 28 ± 19 mL/min; P <. 05). Although the second free flow measurement of the carbon dioxide–insufflated group was higher than in group 1, {{the difference was not}} statistically significant (68 ± 46 mL/min vs 53 ± 32 mL/min; P =. 53). ConclusionsCarbon dioxide insufflation of the internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> is an efficient technique to increase the flow and seems to be safe, simple, and reliable.

40|$|AbstractGrafting an {{internal}} <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> to a coronary artery with moderate stenosis remains controversial. Competitive {{flow from the}} native coronary artery has been proposed {{as the cause of}} distal narrowing and ultimate failure of the internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> graft. We investigated intraoperative phasic blood flow in internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>arteries</b> grafted to coronary arteries with various degrees of stenosis and the influence of stenosis on postoperative angiographic findings. One hundred patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting of {{an internal}} <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> to the left anterior descending coronary artery were divided into three groups according to degree of coronary stenosis. Group 1 included 39 patients who had 75 % or less stenosis, group 2 included 34 patients with stenosis from 76 % to 90 %, and group 3 included 27 patients with stenosis greater than 90 %. Mean flow and peak systolic flow of internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> graft in group 1 were lower than those in group 2 (p < 0. 01, p < 0. 05). Peak diastolic flow in group 1 showed no difference from flows in groups 2 and 3. In eight patients in group 1, internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> flow showed a predominant diastolic peak with characteristic systolic reversal as a result of competitive flow from the native coronary artery. Angiography at 1 month showed that the internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> graft was patent in every case. Relative contributions of native coronary <b>artery</b> and internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> flow to distal perfusion differed among the three groups (p < 0. 001). In group 1, 15 % of patients showed native-dominant flow, 62 % showed balanced flow, and 23 % showed internal thoracic artery–dependent flow. In group 2, 9 % of patients showed native-dominant flow, 29 % showed balanced flow, and 62 % showed internal thoracic artery–dependent flow. In group 3, 96 % of patients showed internal thoracic artery–dependent flow. String sign of the internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> graft developed in only three patients; in two of these patients internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>arteries</b> were grafted to coronary arteries with stenosis of 50 % or less and in the other patient there was competitive flow from a diagonal vein graft. Eleven of 13 internal <b>thoracic</b> <b>arteries</b> grafted to coronary arteries with stenosis of 50 % or less did not show string sign.
