40|$|Although {{a number}} of recent studies have focused on the {{existence}} of a non-negligible sire contemporary group interaction effect (s) affecting the estimation of genetic parameters for maternally influenced traits in beef cattle, the assessment and interpretation of this effect using field data remains poorly understood. In this study 27, 639 records of both birth weight (BW) and weaning weight (WW) from the Asturiana de los Valles breed were used to assess the consequences of the inclusion of an <b>s</b> <b>effect</b> on the estimation of genetic parameters for BW, WW and average daily gain (ADG) fitting univariate and bivariate models. Estimations of s 2 for BW, WWand ADG were 0. 040, 0. 070 and 0. 077 regardless of the fitted model. Inclusion of s in the estimation models induced a reduction of both the direct and the maternal heritability, varying between 8 and 28 % with the trait and the estimation model employed. As expected, the correlations between both direct and maternal genetic effects for each trait were less negative when s was included in the estimation model. The estimated correlations between the <b>s</b> <b>effect</b> affecting BW, WW and ADG were 0. 108, 0. 038 and 0. 616 for the pairs BW–WW, BW–ADG and WW–ADG, respectively. These results suggest that misidentification of individuals cannot be the sole cause of the effect of s and that this effect is of a different nature and origin for different traits (i. e. selective matings for low BW’s and unaccounted management practices for preweaning growth traits). Models including the <b>s</b> <b>effect</b> should be accepted as working models in beef improvement schemes...|$|E

40|$|Rationale and objective: Sufficiently {{high doses}} of β-phenylethylamine (β-PEA), a trace amine that is rapidly metabolized by monoamine oxidase-type B (MAO-B), can produce effects {{comparable}} to those of cocaine or methamphetamine (MA). The present experiments were conducted to study how the discriminative-stimulus (S D) and reinforcing-stimulus (<b>S</b> R) <b>effects</b> of β-PEA in monkeys are modified by treatment with inhibitors of MAO-B [R-(–) -deprenyl and MDL 72974]. Methods and results: In studies of its <b>S</b> D <b>effects,</b> doses of β-PEA up to 30 mg/kg engendered only sporadic responding on the drug-associated lever in squirrel monkeys that discriminated intramuscular injections of 0. 3 mg/kg MA from vehicle whereas lower doses of 0. 3 – 1. 0 mg/kg β-PEA produced full substitution when administered after either R-(–) -deprenyl or MDL 72974 (0. 3 mg/kg). The MA-like <b>S</b> D <b>effects</b> of β-PEA were attenuated by either dopamine D 1 or D 2 receptor blockers. In studies of its <b>S</b> R <b>effects,</b> {{high doses of}} β-PEA maintained responding in two of three monkeys under a second-order fixed-interval schedule (3. 0 or 10 mg/kg per injection) and two of three monkeys under a simple fixed ratio (FR) schedule (0. 3 – 1. 0 mg/kg per injection) of intravenous (i. v.) self-administration. MAO-B inhibition by R-(–) -deprenyl or MDL 72974 enhanced the <b>S</b> R <b>effects</b> of β-PEA in all monkeys and, under the FR schedule, induced a 30 -fold or greater leftward shift in the dose-response function for its i. v. self-administration. Based on time-course determinations, the enhanced <b>S</b> R <b>effects</b> of β-PEA under the FR schedule were long-lasting and dissipated gradually over 3 – 7 days. Conclusions: These results show that inhibition of MAO-B enhances S D and <b>S</b> R <b>effects</b> of β-PEA in monkeys, presumably by delaying its inactivation. MAO-B inhibition leading to increased levels of β-PEA may be useful, alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents, in the pharmacological management of selected aspects of drug dependence...|$|R
