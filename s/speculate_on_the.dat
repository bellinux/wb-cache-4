5|$|In 1806 Jennings {{headed west}} to Jeffersonville in the Indiana Territory, but stayed only briefly. He moved to Vincennes, {{the capital of}} the Indiana Territory, in early 1807 to open his own law {{practice}} and was admitted to the bar in April. Jennings had difficulty earning an income as a lawyer, finding there were too few clients in the territory to keep him busy. In July 1807 Nathaniel Ewing, the federal land receiver at Vincennes and a friend from Pennsylvania, invited Jennings to take a job as assistant to John Badollet, the registrar at the federal land office in Vincennes. Along with Badollet, Jennings engaged in land speculation. He obtained significant land holdings and made substantial profits. In 1807 Jennings became an assistant to the clerk of the territorial legislature and continued to <b>speculate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sale of public lands.|$|E

25|$|Loss of steamboats by collision, fire, or river {{obstacles}} (snags) {{was well}} understood, but boiler explosions seemed arbitrary and mysterious. Immediately {{after the loss}} of the Lucy Walker, many newspapers began to <b>speculate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cause or causes of the explosion. One paper opined that a faulty force pump and low water level in the boiler was the cause. Another newspaper reported qualms about reckless behavior of the boat's officers or shoddy construction of the boilers. Later there was speculation that steamboat racing might have contributed to the disaster.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, Estragon dozes off and Vladimir rouses him {{but then}} stops {{him before he}} can share his dreams another {{recurring}} activity between the two men. Estragon wants to hear an old joke, which Vladimir cannot finish without going off to urinate, since every time he starts laughing, a kidney ailment flares up. Upon Vladimir's return, the increasingly jaded Estragon suggests that they hang themselves, but they abandon the idea when the logistics seem ineffective. They then <b>speculate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> potential rewards of continuing to wait for Godot, but can come to no definite conclusions. When Estragon declares his hunger, Vladimir provides a carrot (among a collection of turnips), at which Estragon idly gnaws, loudly reiterating his boredom.|$|E

25|$|In 1766 Johann Lambert wrote, {{but did not}} publish, Theorie der Parallellinien {{in which}} he attempted, as Saccheri did, to prove the fifth postulate. He worked with a figure that today we call a Lambert {{quadrilateral}}, a quadrilateral with three right angles (can be considered half of a Saccheri quadrilateral). He quickly eliminated {{the possibility that the}} fourth angle is obtuse, as had Saccheri and Khayyam, and then proceeded to prove many theorems under the assumption of an acute angle. Unlike Saccheri, he never felt that he had reached a contradiction with this assumption. He had proved the non-Euclidean result that the sum of the angles in a triangle increases as the area of the triangle decreases, and this led him to <b>speculate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> possibility of a model of the acute case on a sphere of imaginary radius. He did not carry this idea any further.|$|E
25|$|When the U.S. {{government}} {{moved back}} to Philadelphia in 1790, the city, {{in an attempt to}} convince the federal government not to move to Washington, was determined to provide luxurious accommodations at Congress Hall, the recently constructed building where Congress was to meet. One of the finishing touches was in June 1791, when a large Axminster carpet was installed in the Senate's upper-floor chamber. The central design was the U.S. coat of arms, complete with the constellation of 13 stars, surrounded by the linked shields of all thirteen states. Under the arms, there was also a pole with a liberty cap and a balance of justice. The carpet was 22 by 40 feet, and was made by William Peter Sprague, an Englishman from Axminster (probably trained under Thomas Whitty) who had set up a factory in Philadelphia. The carpet was not brought to Washington, D.C., when the government moved in 1800, and is long lost. The National Park Service had a reproduction made in 1978 as part of the restoration of Congress Hall; they had to <b>speculate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> exact design of the eagle and chose the representation seen on the first seal die.|$|E
25|$|In {{the wake}} of the battle the Australians were left to <b>speculate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> reason it occurred. One {{hypothesis}} was that the Viet Cong had intended to attack and overwhelm Nui Dat, with the initial plan to mortar the base to draw a response force into an ambush after which the base would be attacked and captured, but that they had been prevented from doing so after clashing with D Company. A second possibility was that they may have had the more limited aim of drawing D Company into an ambush to destroy it and secure a small victory over an isolated force. Finally, it was possible no ambush was planned at all, and that the Viet Cong had been moving on Nui Dat in regimental strength when they unexpectedly ran into D Company, resulting in an encounter battle. The evidence suggested they intended an attack on Nui Dat in some form, while the lack of prepared positions from which to mount an ambush made this unlikely. Brigadier David Jackson—Commander 1 ATF—believed the Viet Cong had been on their way to attack Nui Dat on the night of 18/19 August when D Company intercepted them and this was supported by information from a prisoner captured afterwards. They were carrying large quantities of ammunition and may have had sufficient strength to seriously damage the base, even if its defences were likely strong enough to withstand such an attack. Yet, from the earliest Jackson had felt the Viet Cong would have to engage 1 ATF in a major battle if they wished to retain control of Phuoc Tuy, and this interpretation fitted his previous thinking. In dispatching patrols east of Nui Dat following the mortar attack on 16/17 August Jackson seemingly reacted to his opponent's first move, and he may have allowed himself to be shaped into responding as the Viet Cong had intended.|$|E

500|$|Viruses co-exist {{with life}} {{wherever}} it occurs. They have probably existed since living cells first evolved. The origin of viruses remains unclear {{because they do}} not form fossils, so molecular techniques have been the most useful means of hypothesising how they arose. However, these techniques rely on the availability of ancient viral DNA or RNA but most of the viruses that have been preserved and stored in laboratories are less than 90 years old. Molecular methods have only been successful in tracing the ancestry of viruses that evolved in the 20th century. Three main theories <b>speculate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> origins of viruses: ...|$|E
500|$|These later {{accounts}} {{were more}} willing to present Constantine as a genuine convert to Christianity. Beginning with Norman H. Baynes' Constantine the Great and the Christian Church (1929) and reinforced by Andreas Alföldi's The Conversion of Constantine and Pagan Rome (1948), a historiographic tradition developed which presented Constantine as a committed Christian. T. D. Barnes's seminal Constantine and Eusebius (1981) represents the culmination of this trend. Barnes' Constantine experienced a radical conversion, which drove him on a personal crusade to convert his empire. Charles Matson Odahl's recent Constantine and the Christian Empire (2004) takes much the same tack. In spite of Barnes' work, arguments over the strength and depth of Constantine's religious conversion continue. Certain themes in this school reached new extremes in T.G. Elliott's The Christianity of Constantine the Great (1996), which presented Constantine as a committed Christian from early childhood. A similar view of Constantine is held in Paul Veyne's recent (2007) work, Quand notre monde est devenu chrétien, which does not <b>speculate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> origins of Constantine's Christian motivation, but presents him, {{in his role as}} Emperor, as a religious revolutionary who fervently believed himself meant [...] "to play a providential role in the millenary economy of the salvation of humanity".|$|E

500|$|Music critics {{generally}} {{welcomed the}} video as {{for most of}} her time in the spotlight, Beyoncé has been a strictly private celebrity. Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly wrote that it was pleasant to see Beyoncé unguarded as it is a rare occurrence. He added that though the clip is a more professional-looking than most people's home movies, it remains the closest thing that fans have seen so far to [...] "Bey just being Bey". Similarly, Brent Woodie of The Christian Post commented about how the 2008 wedding of Beyoncé to Jay-Z was kept very private; there were no photographs or videos released from the event, leaving media and gossip columnists to <b>speculate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> nuptials. He welcomed the clip for being the first behind-the-scenes footage of Beyoncé on her wedding day. Luchina Fisher of ABC News described it as [...] "a home movie featuring highlights from Beyonce's decorated life" [...] and felt that it's [...] "the personal moments [...] the singer's fans will no doubt devour". Samantha Cortez of Daily News felt that the content of the video which included Beyoncé's most personal moments and the lyrics of the song, [...] "add even more sentiment to the video". At the 43rd NAACP Image Award presented on February 17, 2012, the video for [...] "I Was Here" [...] was nominated in the category for Outstanding Music Video.|$|E
500|$|Gray, {{considered}} by Darwin {{to be his}} friend and [...] "best advocate", also attempted to convince Darwin in his letters that design was inherent in all forms of life, and {{to return to his}} faith. Gray saw nature as filled with [...] "unmistakable and irresistible indications of design" [...] and argued that [...] "God himself is the very last, irreducible causal factor and, hence, the source of all evolutionary change." [...] Darwin agreed that his theories were [...] "not at all necessarily atheistical" [...] but was unable to share Gray's belief. [...] "I feel most deeply that the whole subject is too profound for the human intellect. A dog might as well <b>speculate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mind of Newton," [...] he wrote. Gray was a Christian, but he was a staunch supporter of Darwin in America. He collected together a number of his own writings to produce an influential book, Darwiniana (1876); these essays argued for a conciliation between Darwinian evolution and the tenets of theism, {{at a time when many}} on both sides perceived the two as mutually exclusive. Gray denied that investigation of physical causes stood opposed to the theological view and the study of the harmonies between mind and Nature, and thought it [...] "most presumable that an intellectual conception realized in Nature would be realized through natural agencies". The result of all this is that Gray distanced himself from Social Darwinism. Gray is a critical link in the history of American intellectualism, and his writings that explain how religion and science were not necessarily mutually exclusive have been considered his supreme accomplishment; thereby providing a way for believers in Creationism to consider Darwin's ideas.|$|E
