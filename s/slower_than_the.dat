5|$|Henry Kolm went on {{to start}} Magplane Technology in the 1990s to develop the {{magnetic}} transportation technology that O'Neill had written about. In 2007, Magplane demonstrated a working magnetic pipeline system to transport phosphate ore in Florida. The system ran at a speed of 40mph (65km/h), far <b>slower</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> high-speed trains O'Neill envisioned.|$|E
5|$|Because Neptune {{is not a}} solid body, its {{atmosphere}} undergoes differential rotation. The wide {{equatorial zone}} rotates with {{a period of about}} 18hours, which is <b>slower</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> 16.1-hour rotation of the planet's magnetic field. By contrast, the reverse is true for the polar regions where the rotation period is 12hours. This differential rotation is the most pronounced of any planet in the Solar System, and it results in strong latitudinal wind shear.|$|E

5|$|Benjamin Enzema was {{the sole}} male athlete {{representing}} Equatorial Guinea at the Rio Games at age 27. He had previously competed at the 2012 Summer Games. Enzema qualified for the Games via a wildcard as his fastest time of one minute and 53.35 seconds, set at the 2015 African Games, was 7.55 seconds <b>slower</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> qualifying standard for his event, the men's 800 metres. He was drawn in the third heat on 12 August, finishing eighth out of nine athletes, {{with a time of}} one minute and 52.14 seconds. Enzema ranked ahead of final-placed finisher Alex Beddoes of the Cook Islands (one minute and 52.76 seconds) but behind Brazil's Lutimar Paes (one minute and 48.38 seconds) in a heat led by eventual gold medallist David Rudisha from Kenya (one minute and 45.09 seconds). Overall, he finished 50th out of 54 runners, and was unable to advance to the later rounds because he finished 7.15 seconds <b>slower</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> slowest competitor in his heat who progressed to the second round.|$|E
5|$|Djibouti was {{represented}} by one male athlete at the 2008 Olympics in athletics: Mahamoud Farah, a 1500 meters runner. It was Farah's Olympic debut but he had previously competed in the 2007 IAAF World Championships. He competed on 15 August in Beijing, and finished 8th out of 12 in heat four {{in a time of}} 3minutes and 43.62seconds. He was 8.83seconds behind the winner of his heat, Mohamed Moustaoui. Overall he finished 42nd out of 53 athletes, and he was 1.32seconds <b>slower</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> slowest athlete that progressed to the semi-final round and, therefore, {{that was the end of}} his competition.|$|E
5|$|During a LARP, player {{actions in}} the real world {{represent}} character actions in an imaginary setting. Game rules, physical symbols and theatrical improvisation are used to bridge differences between the real world and the setting. For example, a rope could signify an imaginary wall. Realistic-looking weapon props and risky physical activity are sometimes discouraged or forbidden for safety reasons. While the fictional timeline in a tabletop RPG often progresses in game-time, which may be much faster or <b>slower</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> time passing for players, LARPs are different in that they usually run in real-time, with game-time only being used in special circumstances.|$|E

5|$|HD 28185 {{is similar}} to our Sun in terms of mass, radius, and luminosity. The star is on the main {{sequence}} and is generating energy by fusing hydrogen in its core. The spectral type of G5V implies HD 28185 is cooler than the Sun. Like the majority of extrasolar planet host stars, HD 28185 is metal-rich relative to the Sun, containing around 173% of the solar abundance of iron. The star rotates <b>slower</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> Sun, with a period of around 30 days, compared to 25.4 days for the Sun.|$|E
5|$|Just before migration, the ruff {{increases}} {{its body}} mass {{at a rate}} of about 1% a day, much <b>slower</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> bar-tailed godwits breeding in Alaska, which fatten at four times that rate. This is thought to be because the godwit cannot use refuelling areas to feed on its trans-Pacific flight, whereas the ruff is able to make regular stops and take in food during overland migration. For the same reason, the ruff does not physiologically shrink its digestive organs to reduce bodyweight before migrating, unlike the godwit.|$|E
5|$|The Ilyushin Il-20 was a Soviet {{prototype}} for a heavily armored ground-attack aircraft {{to replace the}} Ilyushin Il-10. It featured a number of innovative concepts including a cockpit mounted {{on top of the}} engine, directly behind the propeller, and wing-mounted autocannon that could be adjusted on the ground to fire level or depressed 23° to allow the aircraft to strafe ground targets while remaining in level flight. However it was <b>slower</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> Il-10, and its M-47 engine was problematic in flight tests in 1948–49. It was not placed into production. The test pilots called the aircraft the Gorbach (Hunchback).|$|E

5|$|The {{rainfall}} lightened {{almost as}} soon as it began, but the top riders in the general classification still faced a course made more difficult by the rain. Most of them rode conservatively, to keep their positions intact rather than aim for the stage win, but Danilo Di Luca did not. Di Luca attacked the course, riding with a high cadence from the outset. He had the best time at the first intermediate time check, but he lost energy and faded away as the course went on, finishing 45 seconds <b>slower</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> stage winner.|$|E
5|$|According to {{historian}} Charles Coulson {{the accumulation}} of wealth and resources, such as food, led {{to the need for}} defensive structures. The earliest fortifications originated in the Fertile Crescent, the Indus Valley, Egypt, and China where settlements were protected by large walls. Northern Europe was <b>slower</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> East to develop defensive structures and {{it was not until the}} Bronze Age that hill forts developed and began to spread across Europe. In the medieval period castles were influenced by earlier forms of elite architecture, contributing to regional variations. Importantly, while castles had military aspects, they contained a recognisable household structure within their walls, reflecting the multi-functional use of these buildings.|$|E
5|$|At the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, O'Brien placed {{second in}} his {{heat of the}} 200m breaststroke {{in a time of}} 2min 36.8s, which placed him 13th. He was eliminated, having been 2.9s <b>slower</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> last-placed {{qualifier}} for the final. The eventual winner posted a time 0.9s slower than that of O'Brien four years earlier. O'Brien did better in the newly introduced 100m event, winning his heat in a time of 1min 8.9s to qualify second-fastest for the semifinals. O'Brien scraped into the final after coming second in his semifinal in a time of 1min 9.0s. It was the barest of margins; O'Brien was the slowest qualifier and could not be electronically separated from the ninth-fastest semifinalist, with judges being used to decide the placings. O'Brien went on to finish sixth in a time of 1min 8.6s.|$|E

As of 2016, the time is her personal best. She ranked ahead of Afa Ismail from the Maldivies (12.52 seconds) and Jordan's Rima Taha (12.66 seconds) in a heat led by Feta Ahamada of the Comoros (11.81 seconds). Overall she finished 57th out of 78 competitors, and did not advance into the first round because her fastest time was 0.05 seconds <b>slower</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> slowest athlete who progressed.|$|E
5|$|Converge {{began writing}} Axe to Fall in November 2008.

Though most songs originated from a guitar or bass riff from Ballou or Newton, all members had equal input on the writing process, with each member proposing different songs. Vocalist Bannon wrote a few songs for Axe to Fall, but were scrapped because they were <b>slower</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> rest of the songs, and did not fit the energy of the album.|$|E
5|$|During {{the post-war}} boom, {{the methods used}} to set up {{business}} in South Australia were unique. Playford's government would charge little to no business tax, supply cheap electricity, land and water, and have the Housing Trust build the factories and workers' homes. Consumer goods and automotive factories were created in the northern and western suburbs of Adelaide; mining, steel and shipbuilding industries appeared in the 'Iron Triangle' towns of Whyalla, Port Pirie and Port Augusta. Prices and wages were kept relatively low to enable continued investment, and South Australia was <b>slower</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> other states to abolish these wartime measures to increase its industrial competitiveness. The government initiatives managed to overcome the large logistic burden, as Adelaide and South Australia were far from the markets where the goods would be sold.|$|E
