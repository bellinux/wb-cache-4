5|$|Bergen Street is {{laid out}} similar to other subway {{stations}} located below narrow streets, with two levels. The upper level—the only one used in regular service—serves local trains, while the lower level has formerly seen express service. As {{a result of the}} station's proximity to ground level, {{there is no room for}} a mezzanine, making it one of only three as-built express stations in the system that do not allow free transfers between directions. As a result passengers wishing to transfer from a Brooklyn-bound G to a Manhattan-bound F, and vice versa, cannot do <b>so</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> station.|$|E
5|$|Goater {{was born}} in the Bermudian capital Hamilton, living with his mother Lynette, his {{grandmother}} and two aunts. His introduction to English football came in April 1987 when he was invited to join the Saltus Grammar School football and basketball tour. He spent two weeks playing against various English high school teams, including the Leicester City youth team. At the age of 17, he left home to further his education in the United States, where he had a soccer scholarship at Columbia High School, New Jersey. Whilst home in Bermuda during his Thanksgiving break, Goater was spotted by scouts from Manchester United, who invited him to England for a trial. With encouragement from his mother, who was a former football player herself, Goater accepted, forfeiting his scholarship by doing <b>so.</b> <b>At</b> <b>this</b> time, Goater did not play as a striker, but instead played as a creative midfielder.|$|E

In that spirit, I pledge to each of you that any disagreements we may have are just that and no more. Walking in each other's shoes takes effort and pause; however, it is my sincere hope that I never lose the patience to view each of you as human beings first, God's creatures, and foremost. I deeply appreciate this opportunity to serve with each of you. I very much look forward to getting to know you better.|$|E
25|$|After the Americans {{launched}} an invasion in July 1812, the war raged {{back and forth}} along the border of Upper Canada, on land {{as well as on}} the waters of the Great Lakes. The British succeeded in capturing Detroit in July, and again in October. On July 12, US General William Hull invaded Canada at Sandwich (later known as Windsor). The invasion was quickly halted and Hull withdrew, giving General Isaac Brock the excuse he needed to abandon his previous orders and advance on Detroit, securing Shawnee chief Tecumseh's aid to do <b>so.</b> <b>At</b> <b>this</b> point, even with his aboriginal allies, Brock was outnumbered approximately two to one. However, Brock had gauged Hull as a timid man, and particularly as being afraid of Tecumseh's confederacy; he was thus able to convince Hull to surrender. The defeat of Detroit was utter and complete. A major American thrust across the Niagara frontier was defeated at the Battle of Queenston Heights, where Sir Isaac Brock lost his life.|$|E

500|$|The {{scenes with}} Tyler Durden were staged to conceal that the {{character}} was a mental projection of the unnamed Narrator. The character was not filmed in two shots {{with a group of}} people, nor was he shown in any over the shoulder shots in scenes where Tyler gives the Narrator specific ideas to manipulate him. In scenes before the Narrator meets Tyler, the filmmakers inserted Tyler's presence in single frames for subliminal effect. Tyler appears in the background and out of focus, like a [...] "little devil on the shoulder". Fincher explained the subliminal frames: [...] "Our hero is creating Tyler Durden in his own mind, <b>so</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> point he exists only {{on the periphery of the}} Narrator's consciousness." ...|$|E
500|$|The seal from 1752 {{is shown}} in Figure 2. The beaver honored Albany's past as an {{important}} fur trading port. Adding {{to the history of}} this seal, one historian states, [...] " [...] displays the beaver, but looking in the original, more like a drowned cat than the fat and sleek animal, it was intended to represent. Neither the resolution nor the records state why the change was made." [...] In 1755 the original seal (Figure 1) was reinstated for use by the mayor in licensing businesses. <b>So</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> point the city had two seals, one corporate and one public. The earlier seal, however, was last seen in 1761 and the beaver continued as the sole city seal from then on.|$|E

Talbot's mother, Sharon, said she was told that her daughter [...] "...was too young to be their sort of artist", adding [...] "We have been told to look for a company which looks after children." [...] In a statement, the label said [...] "there was some deliberation over the possibility of recording with Connie... However, the decision not to proceed was made with the best intentions for Connie, taking into consideration her age and {{that it would not be}} right to do <b>so</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> time." [...] Cowell himself said that [...] "when the time is right, [...] be delighted to see if [...] make it work". The Talbot family decided to search for another label, saying [...] "while [...] loves what she's doing it would be cruel to stop her. Fame and money will never matter." ...|$|E

500|$|I {{definitely}} don't go {{the straight}} and narrow path, and you know, I definitely kinda like to experiment and collaborate. And so, I think it's taken me and Max this long to work together because of that, because what he does is genius and he is a classic hitmaker. But when I was coming out it was {{at a time when we}} had the huge pop explosion, and he was all over radio and I just wanted to work with others like Linda Perry and do that route and do [...] "Beautiful" [...] and songs like that. We built a level of respect for each other. <b>So</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> point, coming together, especially embracing my true pop-starness, at this point in my career having come full circle, I was able to really truly embrace it, and embrace him. He gave me the freedom to really sing on these songs, and have a little more creative freedom because I heard he is a stickler for melody and a melody king and I was scared, I was like 'Oh my God! I won't be able to collaborate here.' But he couldn't have been more great, and this is a really fun song, super up-tempo. It's probably the most dancey-ish song on my record, but it's called 'Let There Be Love' but it's free and representative of what this album is about.|$|E
500|$|In late December 1964, Thảo {{was summoned}} back to Saigon by Khánh, who {{correctly}} suspected him and Khiêm of plotting together in Washington. Thảo believed Khánh {{was attempting to}} have him killed, so he went underground upon returning to Saigon, and began plotting in earnest, unfazed {{by the prospect of}} being charged for desertion. The ruling junta appealed to Thảo in newspaper advertisements and broadcasts to follow orders to report, but he ignored them. Due to his Catholicism, Thảo was able to recruit Diệm loyalists such as Phát. In mid-January 1965, the regime called for him to report to his superiors in the ARVN, warning that he would be [...] "considered guilty of abandoning his post with all the consequences of such a situation" [...] if he failed to do <b>so.</b> <b>At</b> <b>this</b> time, it was still not known that Thảo was a communist agent who was deliberately trying to cause infighting within South Vietnam at every opportunity. With Khánh's hold on power shaky, an anonymous source said Thảo was worried about how he would be treated if someone else took over: [...] "Thảo acted first, out of fear that if he did not, the other generals would overthrow Khánh and get rid of him as well. He knew that if the others overthrew Khánh his fate would be worse than Khánh's." [...] During this time, Thảo kept in touch with elements of the CIA in an attempt to get American backing.|$|E
2500|$|Since July 7, 1987, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has listed Gopherus polyphemus as [...] "Threatened" [...] {{wherever}} the tortoises are found {{west of the}} Mobile and Tombigbee Rivers in Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana. Its status is listed as [...] "Under Review" [...] in Florida and in other locations. On November 9, 2009, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed rulemaking to include the eastern population of Gopherus polyphemus in the List of Threatened Wildlife. G. polyphemus appears on the IUCN Red List as a [...] "Vulnerable" [...] species; however, {{it has not been}} assessed {{for the purposes of this}} list since 1996. In July 2011, United States Fish & Wildlife Service (USFWS) determined that listing the eastern population of the tortoise as Threatened under the Endangered Species Act is warranted, however, it is precluded from doing <b>so</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> time due to higher priority actions and a lack of sufficient funds to commence proposed rule development. In the interim period of time the USFWS [...] will place the eastern population of the tortoise on its candidate species list until sufficient funding is available to initiate a proposed listing rule.|$|E

2500|$|At 11:30p.m. on July 22, Edwards flagged {{down two}} Milwaukee police {{officers}} {{at the corner of}} North 25th Street. The officers noted Edwards had a handcuff attached to his wrist, whereupon Edwards explained to the officers that a [...] "freak" [...] had placed the handcuffs upon him and asked if the police could remove them. When the officers' handcuff keys failed to fit the brand of handcuffs, Edwards agreed to accompany the officers to the apartment where, Edwards stated, he had spent the previous five hours before escaping. When the officers and Edwards arrived at Apartment 213, Dahmer invited the trio inside and acknowledged he had indeed placed the handcuffs upon Edwards, although he offered no explanation as to why he had done <b>so.</b> <b>At</b> <b>this</b> point, Edwards divulged to the officers that Dahmer had also brandished a large knife upon him and that this had happened in the bedroom. Dahmer made no comment to this revelation; indicating to one of the officers, Rolf Mueller, that the key to the handcuffs was in his bedside dresser in the bedroom. As Mueller entered the bedroom, Dahmer attempted to pass Mueller to himself retrieve the key, whereupon the second officer present, Robert Rauth, informed him to [...] "back off".|$|E
2500|$|This {{may occur}} in compact {{fluorescent}} lamps with integral electrical ballasts or in linear lamps. Ballast electronics failure is a somewhat random process that follows the standard failure profile for any electronic device. There is an initial small peak of early failures, followed by a drop and steady increase over lamp life. Life of electronics is heavily dependent on operating temperature—it typically halves for each 10nbsp&°C temperature rise. The quoted average {{life of a lamp}} is usually at [...] ambient (this may vary by country). The average life of the electronics at this temperature is normally greater than this, <b>so</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> temperature, not many lamps will fail due to failure of the electronics. In some fittings, the ambient temperature could be well above this, in which case failure of the electronics may become the predominant failure mechanism. Similarly, running a compact fluorescent lamp base-up will result in hotter electronics, which can cause shorter average life (particularly with higher power rated ones). Electronic ballasts should be designed to shut down the tube when the emission mix runs out as described above. In the case of integral electronic ballasts, since they never have to work again, this is sometimes done by having them deliberately burn out some component to permanently cease operation.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1920s Browne began a {{speaking}} tour around the country, providing {{information about her}} beliefs {{on the need for}} accessibility of information about birth control for women, women’s health problems, problems related to puberty and sex education and high maternal morbidity rates among other topics. [...] These talks urged women to take matters of their sexuality and their health into their own hands. Birth control was an embarrassing issue because it would directly challenge relations between men and women too, making this control for women a touchy subject. [...] During this tour several women asked Browne for abortions, however as Jones recognizes in her article, Browne was not “medically qualified” and had to refuse them. Though she was becoming increasingly interested in women’s right to terminate their pregnancies, she would still be considered a “heretic” were she to say <b>so</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> time. [...] Despite this, in 1929 she brought forward her lecture “The Right to Abortion” in front of the World Sexual Reform Congress in London. [...] In the years leading up to the presentation of this paper, Browne worked to gather information on maternal mortality, and found that rates were higher than ever before in 1929, and became the secretary of the Chelsea Labour Party in hopes of bringing ideas of birth control and abortion to light in political platform in 1926. [...] She was unable to do so as she was forced to leave Chelsea later in 1926, as the Party was no longer recognized as a political Party. By the end of the 1920s, Browne had felt that the fight for birth control had become more successful, as it was more frequently seen in the public sphere and was now being talked about and debated more openly. [...] In April 1930 the Birth Control Conference was a success bringing 700 delegates to attendance and bringing birth control into the political sphere, which she attended and spoke at. [...] In July 1930, the Ministry of Health issued MCW/153, which allowed local authorities to give birth control advice in welfare centres, another partial success for Browne.|$|E
