25|$|A manual {{shutdown}} {{was initiated}} {{during the middle}} of a <b>start-up</b> <b>operation.</b> The cause was a high pressure alarm that was caused by the shutting of a turbine bypass valve. The reactor was at 12% of full power when the alarm occurred at 4:03am (local time) due to a pressure increase to 1,030 psi (7,100 kPa), exceeding the regulatory limit of 1,002 psi (6,910 kPa). The reactor was reduced to 0% power, which exceeded the 5% threshold that requires event reporting, and pressure dropped back under the regulatory limit at 4:25am. Later, at 8:49am the control blades were completely inserted, constituting a manual reactor shutdown. An inspection then confirmed that one of the 8 bypass valves had closed and that the valve had a bad driving fluid connection. The reactor had been starting up following its 25th regular inspection, which had begun on October 18, 2008.|$|E

50|$|After works {{had been}} {{completed}} on the raffinate splitter, consideration {{was given to the}} impending start-up of the plant. One of the primary safety critical steps in the prestart-up process was the use of the BP Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) procedure. The purpose of the review was to ensure that complete and thorough technical checks were carried out and that all non-essential personnel were clear during the <b>start-up</b> <b>operation.</b> Once completed, the PSSR would be signed off by refinery operations and safety managers, authorising the start-up work but this essential safety procedure was not completed.

From a modest <b>start-up</b> <b>operation</b> opening for business in 1999, SA Home Loans (Pty) Ltd (SAHL) has flourished {{in the midst of}} powerfully entrenched competition and global financial turmoil. It has become SA’s 5th largest - and largest non-bank - mortgage (home loan) provider. After 14 years it is solidly established with a strong and recognisable local brand, 190 000 clients, and services its own sizable mortgage portfolio - having originated in excess of R95 billion (approx. US$9 billion) since inception.As a non-bank home finance provider, SAHL pioneered new practices in SA for raising funding from the markets to fund its loan portfolios (securitisation). As a specialist loan servicer, its lending operations cover the full spectrum of home financing: from its own sales force for origination and in-house credit structures, through to ongoing client and loan servicing. Mortgage lending hence can no longer be seen as the sole preserve of Banks.|$|E

40|$|The {{simulation}} of batch distillation columns during <b>start-up</b> <b>operations</b> {{is a very}} challenging modelling problem because of the complex dynamic behaviour. Only few rigorous models for distillation columns start-up are available in literature and generally required a lot of parameters related to tray or pack geometry. On an industrial viewpoint, such a complexity penalizes the achievement of a fast and reliable estimate of start-up periods. In this paper, two “simple” mathematical models are proposed for the {{simulation of}} the dynamic behaviour during <b>start-up</b> <b>operations</b> from an empty cold state. These mathematical models {{are based on a}} rigorous tray-by-tray description of the column described by conservation laws, liquid–vapour equilibrium relationships and equations representative of hydrodynamics. The models calibration and validation are studied through experiments carried out on a batch distillation pilot plant, with perforated trays, supplied by a water methanol mixture. The proposed models are shown by comparison between simulation and experimental studies to provide accurate and reliable representations of the dynamic behaviour of batch distillation column start-ups, in spite of the few parameters entailed...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{emissions}} of various industrial facilities under start-up, shut-down, and normal operations. The industries {{that have been}} investigated include power and/or heat generation, energy-from-waste generation, nuclear power generation, sulphuric acid production, ethylene production, petrochemical production, and waste incineration. The study investigated multiple facilities worldwide {{for each of these}} industrial categories. The different potential contaminants characteristic of each industry type have been investigated and the emissions of these contaminants under non-steady state have been compared to the steady state emissions. Where available, trends have been developed to identify the circumstances, i. e., the industrial sector and contaminant, under which the assessment and consideration of emissions from start-up and shut-down events is necessary for each industry. These trends differ by industrial sector and contaminant. For example, the study shows that sulphur dioxide (SO 2) emissions should be assessed for the <b>start-up</b> <b>operations</b> of sulphuric acid production plants, but may not need to be assessed for the <b>start-up</b> <b>operations</b> of a conventional power generation facility. The trends developed as part of this research paper will help air permit applicants to effectively allocate their resources when assessing emissions related to non-steady state operations. Additionally, it will ensure that emissions are assessed for the worst-case scenario. This is especially important when emissions under <b>start-up</b> and shut-down <b>operations</b> have the potential to exceed enforceable emission limits. Thus, assessing emissions for the worst-case scenario can help in preventing the emissions from adversely impacting public health and the environment...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe <b>start-up</b> <b>operation</b> or {{acclimatization}} {{process of}} anaerobic stabilization pond treatment for palm oil mill effluent (POME) {{was carried out}} in a laboratory anaerobic bench scale reactor (ABSR).

This start-up circuit determines the state of the circuit reliably by measuring the current drawn by BJTs in the circuit, which is well-defined in the desired state. To measure the current using CMOS-compatible devices only, a comparator with an internal offset voltage is used.
