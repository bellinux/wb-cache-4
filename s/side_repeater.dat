50|$|The front turn signals were {{relocated}} {{from underneath}} the bumper on USA versions to their new location next to the headlights, as in the Japanese, Australian and European versions. <b>Side</b> <b>repeater</b> lenses were also added to the USA version, but they were used as side marker lights and not turn signal repeaters.|$|E
50|$|The {{cumulative}} visual {{changes from}} the first models included a revised front grille and headlights, redesigned front and rear bumpers, oval instead of round <b>side</b> <b>repeater</b> indicators, major changes to the interior and dashboard, redesigned rear light lenses, and a radio aerial repositioned {{from the top of}} the right-hand A-pillar to the middle of the roof, towards the rear.|$|E
5000|$|The X350 was facelifted for the 2008 model year, {{a design}} {{unveiled}} {{at the end}} of February 2007. The car featured a mildly revised front grille and new front bumper assembly with a prominent lower grille. Branding changed from the cast bonnet ornament to a Jaguar emblem within the grille featured also on the XK and the XF. [...] The front lights had detail changes while the revised door mirrors incorporated <b>side</b> <b>repeaters.</b> The front wings on all models were remodelled to feature side vents, previously featured on the Super V8 Portfolio (and XJR Portfolio in the UK), while the side sills, rear bumper and tail lights were revised.|$|R

5000|$|Japanese models saw the {{introduction}} of the GT type S2 sedan, which added BBS alloy wheels and rear trunk spoiler as standard equipment, the VZ type R, and the Brighton 220, which had much of the luxury equipment from the VZ trim level and the 2.2 SOHC engine installed in only the Touring Wagon. The Japanese-spec TZ was replaced by the Brighton trim name. In August 1992, the [...] "Legacy Touring Wagon STi" [...] was released and limited to 200 units. A Nardi three spoke black leather steering wheel was installed with the [...] "STi" [...] logo on the center horn button. The only major upgrade mentioned was upgrading the fuel injection ECU, and increasing the turbocharger pressure from the standard 450 mmHg to 650 mmHg, which was being used on the [...] "RS" [...] sedan and the same engine torque output, with an automatic transmission only. The 1989-1991 Japanese version incorporated the <b>side</b> <b>repeater</b> {{into the side of the}} front corner turn signal lens with the <b>side</b> <b>repeater</b> protruding from the lens so that it could be seen laterally, then later adopting the European configuration in 1992.|$|E

50|$|The {{new model}} could be {{recognized}} {{by the addition of}} a slim louvred panel in the front lid to aid radiator exhaust air exit, power operated mirrors carrying a small enamel Ferrari badge, a redesigned radiator grille with rectangular driving lights on each side, and rectangular (in place of round) <b>side</b> <b>repeaters.</b> The interior also received some minor updates, such as a satin black three spoke steering wheel with triangular centre; cloth seat centres became available as an option to the standard full leather. Available included metallic paint, a deep front spoiler, air conditioning, wider wheels, 16-inch Speedline wheels with Pirelli P7 tyres, and a satin black roof aerofoil (standard on Japanese market models).|$|R
50|$|Visually the 1300 was {{distinguished}} {{by a new}} grille design housing single instead of twin head lamps, rectangular <b>side</b> <b>repeaters</b> without ornamentation, and all-metal hubcaps. It also did without bumper over-riders, most pieces of exterior chrome trim, and rear back-up lamps. Inside dashboard and steering wheel came from the TI (though the latter was all-black), there were rubber mats instead of carpets, and several convenience features such as the passenger grab handle and rear ashtrays were omitted.In September 1967 the Giulia 1300 was updated, adopting a black mesh grille with three horizontal chrome bars, the vertical louvres {{at the base of}} the windshield first seen on the Giulia Super, the second series Giulia TI three round instrument dashboard, and the 1300 ti's three-spoke steering wheel.|$|R

5000|$|At {{the same}} time as the 420 was released, Jaguar added a chrome side strip and <b>side</b> <b>repeater</b> {{indicator}} to the Mark X and a centre bar to its grille. Along with alterations to the interior, these changes were used to justify renaming it the 420G ("G" [...] for Grand). The Motor magazine of October 1966 referred to the 420G as [...] "still one of the best looking large cars in the world today" [...] and commented on the similarity of its new radiator grille to that of the 420. Given the similarity between both the names and frontal styling of the 420 and 420G, the casual observer might be forgiven for mistaking one for the other.|$|E
5000|$|The 1989-1994 European and Australian Legacy had <b>side</b> <b>repeater</b> lenses {{installed}} in the front fender just behind the front wheel, with the front turn signals installed next to the headlights. Starting with the 1992 facelift, the European model sold in Germany was available in a [...] "Hubertus 2" [...] trim level on the 1.8 L wagon only; it was offered in green with a manual transmission, all-wheel drive was standard equipment with the dual range transmission, and was also fitted with a painted brush guard matching the body color that protected the front grille and headlights, wrapping around to protect the side turn signals. It was also fitted with the height adjustable air suspension, allowing the vehicle to travel off-road. The name Hubertus is used by a German hunting knife manufacturer and the name Hubertus is {{the patron saint of}} hunters.|$|E
50|$|A {{new version}} of the Giulietta Berlina debuted at the Frankfurt Motor Show in 1959. Mechanical changes were limited to {{shifting}} the fuel pump from the cylinder head to a lower position below the distributor, and moving the previously exposed fuel filler cap from the tail to the right rear wing, under a flap. The bodywork showed a revised front end, with more rounded wings, recessed head lights, and new grilles with chrome frames and two horizontal bars. The rear also showed changes, with new larger tail lights on vestigial fins, which replaced the earlier rounded rear wings. The interior was much more organized and upholstered in new cloth material; the redesigned dashboard included a strip speedometer flanked by two round bezels, that on the T.I. housed a tachometer and oil and water temperature gauges. The T.I. also received a front <b>side</b> <b>repeater</b> mounted in a small spear, unlike the Normale which kept the earlier small round lamp with no decorations. During 1959 the type designation for all models was changed from 750 and 753 to 101.|$|E
40|$|September 2003. "Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 27) Turn signals {{mounted on}} exterior rearview mirrors {{are increasingly being}} used as original equipment on passenger cars and light trucks. The potential for mirror-mounted turn signals (MMTS) to improve the geometric visibility of turn signals is examined in this report. A survey of U. S. and European regulations showed that the turn signals of a vehicle that is minimally compliant with U. S. regulations are not visible to a driver of a nearby vehicle in an adjacent lane. Measurements of mirror location and window geometry were made on 74 passenger cars and light trucks, including 38 vehicles with European-style <b>side</b> <b>repeaters.</b> These data were combined with data on driver eye locations from two previous studies to assess the relative visibility of MMTS and conventional signals. Simulations were conducted to examine the potential for signals to be obstructed when a driver looks laterally through the passenger-side window. With a vehicle population that is fifty percent light trucks, MMTS are visible 52 percent more often than European <b>side</b> <b>repeaters</b> in this scenario. Based on the lateral visibility analysis, the optimal height for geometric visibility of a signal in the adjacent-vehicle scenario is 124 cm above the ground, approximately the average height of a light truck mirror. A plan-view eccentricity analysis showed that an MMTS is {{much closer to the}} viewing driver’s forward-directed line of sight than rear-mounted turn signals when the viewing driver’s vehicle is in or near the blind zone between the signaling driver’s mirror and direct peripheral fields of view. The report concludes that MMTS can improve the geometric visibility of turn signals in the adjacent-vehicle scenario that is believed to precede many lane-change/merge crashes. Further research will be necessary to determine if improved geometric visibility is accompanied by improved detection of turn signals by viewing drivers, and whether improved detection of turn signals has important safety implications...|$|R

5000|$|A facelifted model (the AS) {{arrived to}} Australia in September 1985. This {{comprised}} minor restyling {{to the front}} and rear, a comprehensively updated interior, improved suspension, revised trim and more features. Front turn signals were relocated from the headlamps to the bumper, with <b>side</b> <b>repeaters</b> added to the wrap-around sections of the front bumper. Taillamps for the sedan were restyled, and all models received new hubcaps or alloys. GL was now fitted with a left-hand side wing mirror, with Ghia models gaining electric mirror operation. The AS update also benefited from tinted side and rear glass for the GL sedan. Analogue instrumentation was now standard across the range, dispensing with the digital setup used previously by the TX5 Ghia. The new centre console housed audio equipment, a storage tray, gear lever and, on Ghia models, power window switches. Telstar GL and the base TX5 offered a more basic hand brake console integrating an ashtray for rear passengers. Ghia models featured an armrest console with acrylic [...] "smoked glass" [...] lid to provide extra storage. Compared to the AR series, console storage space for Ghia models was increased, as was glove compartment capacity across all trims. The seats were also revised—the work of Ford Australia—and a modification that only applied to the Ford-badged cars. Other interior changes included those made to the stalk-mounted switchgear, and a new digital clock in the centre of the dashboard benefitting from a glare-prevention hood. The clock was previously located awkwardly ahead of the gear lever.|$|R
