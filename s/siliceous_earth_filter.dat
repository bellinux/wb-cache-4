40|$|The company Kiviks Musteri AB {{produces}} a pear base wine that forms stable foam, which is problematic from a production perspective. The {{aim of this}} thesis {{was to investigate the}} factors underlying foam stability in the pear base wine and to find means for its reduction. This was done by foam testing wines and varying several variables, such as the fining agents normally used in the wine production (bentonite, gelatin, <b>siliceous</b> <b>earth</b> and activated carbon), enzyme treatment, and by changing the fermenting yeast species. Results: The wine started to form stable foam during fermentation, and foam stability could be reduced by using more bentonite and carbon during the fining process. The other fining agents appeared to have only limited impact on foaming characteristics. No pectin was present according to the pectin test, but protein bands were evident from SDS PAGE analysis, though absent in samples treated with increased doses of bentonite. In conclusion, pectin is not a major foaming agent in the wine, the yeast is most likely the producer of the foaming agents, carbon and bentonite have a reducing effect on foam stability, bentonite also reduces protein content. Proteins are likely {{to be involved in the}} foam stabilization but are not the sole contributors to stable foam...|$|R

40|$|Industrial {{production}} of certain amino acids by fermentation requires acquisition of peptide solutions obtained from soybean meal by acidic hydrolysis.

Use of this material for establishment of acid-loving crops was a natural selection and blueberries were a logical fit as a crop to be grown. In order to evaluate this acid residue, a comparison of it with accepted soil acidification and modification procedures was deemed appropriate.

Dialyzed crude enzyme extracts from yeast cells were found to destroy diacetyl in a manner quite similar to that of diacetyl reductase from Aerobacter aerogenes, and both the bacterial and the yeast extracts were stimulated significantly by the addition of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). Diacetyl reductase activity of four strains of A. aerogenes was compared; three of the strains produced enzyme with approximately twice the specific activity of the other strain (8724).

This results in a number of industrial residues with high contents of these phytochemicals. With the aim of supporting the development of profitable industrial procedures for γ-oryzanol and tocopherol recovery, the contents of these phytochemicals in all the residues produced during RBO refining were evaluated. The samples included residues from the degumming, soap precipitation, bleaching <b>earth</b> <b>filtering,</b> dewaxing and deodorisation distillation steps. The highest phytochemical concentrations were found in the precipitated soap for γ-oryzanol (14. 2 mgg− 1, representing 95. 3 % of total γ-oryzanol in crude RBO), and in the deodorisation distillate for tocopherols (576 mg 100 g− 1, representing 6. 7 % of total tocopherols in crude RBO). Therefore, among the residues of RBO processing, the deodorisation distillate was the best source of tocopherols. As the soap is further processed for the recovery of fatty acids, samples taken from every step of this secondary process, including hydrosoluble fraction, hydrolysed soap, distillation residue and purified fatty acid fraction, were also analyzed.

Current study {{focuses on the}} combination of a range of various filters to investigate the reduction of radiation absorbed dose and improving the quality of a radiography image. To simulate the X-ray beam spectrum, a MCNP 5 code was applied. Relative intensity, beam quality, and mean energy were investigated for a typical dental radiography machine. The impact of different rare-earth materials with different thicknesses and tube voltages on the X-ray spectrum was investigated. For Aluminum as a conventional filter, the modeled X-ray spectra and HVL values were in a good agreement with those reported by IPEM. The results showed that for a 70 kVp voltage, with an increase of the thickness and atomic number of a given added filters, an increase of HVL values were observed. However, with the increase of the attenuator thickness, X-ray beam intensity decreases. For mean energy, different results were observed. It was also found that rare <b>earth</b> made <b>filters</b> reduce high energy X-ray radiation due to k-edge absorption. This leads to an ideal beam for intra-oral radiography tasks.

ABSTRACT: Irrigation water quality has significant importance in dry region that have high temperature and low humidity. Mechanical properties and physical properties are stability, porous, soil structure and hydraulic directing relative to exchange ion in irrigation. We can control problem due to pollution in environment level and water resources and can increase products performance. Eatable vegetable are in border with respect to consumption process and should be evaluate because of gathering different elements such as heavy metal like sorb, calcium, corm, Niche, Mercury, Arsenic, cobalt. Model output is depending on application method and reuse method of effluent. Also filterable effluent volume, weather situation, cost and investment level and each value are other effective factors. Recommendation are filtration, <b>Earth</b> <b>filter</b> and soon. We can attribute part of filter to irrigation system trend. Also we can avoid of effluent mix apply or effluent alternative application.

40|$|Seismic signals contain {{information}} about the subsurface. To extract this information we use our knowledge about how waves propagates to generate seismic images. As a wave propagates through the earth, it responds to changes in elastic properties. Relative changes in elastic impedance cause reection of seismic energy according to Snell's law, and these reflections allow us to record signals from the <b>earth</b> <b>filtered</b> waves. If the earth was perfectly elastic, the wave energy would not be absorbed, but in reality only energy in a frequency range band from 10 Hzto about 90 Hz is measured, making {{the reconstruction of the}} elastic earth model a non-unique inverse problem. In particular, the lack of high frequencies puts a limit on the resolution, while the lack of low frequencies only allow us to inferrelative changes. In this thesis seismic inversion techniques are introduced, with an emphasis on how the seismic wavelet aects the inversion, and how the different inversion methods handle the inherent non-uniqueness. The methods are divided into post-stack and pre-stack inversion. Pre-stack data contains {{information about}} the shear properties of the rocks, in addition to the compressional properties also. This information comes at the cost of a lower signal to noise ratio, and a more costly inversion procedure. I was also fortunate to work with real prestack data from the North Sea.
