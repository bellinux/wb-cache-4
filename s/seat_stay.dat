25|$|Recently, a {{variation}} of the traditional <b>seat</b> <b>stay</b> that bypasses the seat tube and connects further into the top tube was patented by Volagi Cycles. This frame element added length to the traditional design of seat stays, making a softer ride at the sacrifice of frame stiffness.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{alternatives}} to the traditional <b>seat</b> <b>stay</b> design have been introduced over the years. A style of <b>seat</b> <b>stay</b> that extends forward of the seat tube, below the rear end of the top tube and connects to the top tube {{in front of the}} seat tube, creating a small triangle, is called a Hellenic stay after the British frame builder Fred Hellens, who introduced them in 1923. [...] Hellenic seat stays add aesthetic appeal at the expense of added weight. [...] This style of <b>seat</b> <b>stay</b> was popularized again in the late 20th century by GT Bicycles (under the moniker [...] "triple triangle"), who had incorporated the design element into their BMX frames, as it also made for a much stiffer rear triangle (an advantage in races); this design element has also been used on their mountain bike frames for similar reasons.|$|E
50|$|On most <b>seat</b> <b>stays,</b> {{a bridge}} or brace is {{typically}} used {{to connect the}} stays above the rear wheel and below the connection with the seat tube. Besides providing lateral rigidity, this bridge provides a mounting point for rear brakes, fenders, and racks. The <b>seat</b> <b>stays</b> themselves may also be fitted with brake mounts. Brake mounts are often absent from fixed-gear or track bike <b>seat</b> <b>stays.</b>|$|R

2500|$|The seat stays {{connect the}} top of the seat tube (often at or near the same point as the top tube) to the rear fork dropouts. [...] A {{traditional}} frame uses a simple set of paralleled tubes connected by a bridge above the rear wheel. When the rear derailleur cable is routed partially along the top tube, it is also usually routed along the <b>seat</b> <b>stay.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Another common {{seatstay}} variant is the wishbone, single <b>seat</b> <b>stay,</b> or mono stay, which {{joins the}} stays together {{just above the}} rear wheel into a monotube that is joined to the seat tube. [...] A wishbone design adds vertical rigidity without increasing lateral stiffness, generally an undesirable trait for bicycles with unsuspended rear wheels. [...] The wishbone design is most appropriate when used {{as part of a}} rear triangle subframe on a bicycle with independent rear suspension.|$|E
2500|$|The {{cantilever}} brake is a {{class of}} brake in which each arm {{is attached to a}} separate pivot point {{on one side of the}} <b>seat</b> <b>stay</b> or fork. [...] Thus all cantilever brakes are dual-pivot. [...] Both first- and second-class lever designs exist; second-class is by far the most common. [...] In the second-class lever design, the arm pivots below the rim. [...] The brake shoe is mounted above the pivot and is pressed against the rim as the two arms are drawn together. [...] In the first-class lever design, the arm pivots above the rim. [...] The brake shoe is mounted below the pivot and is pressed against the rim as the two arms are forced apart.|$|E
25|$|The rear {{triangle}} {{connects to}} the rear fork ends, where the rear wheel is attached. It consists of the seat tube and paired chain <b>stays</b> and <b>seat</b> <b>stays.</b> The chain stays run connecting the bottom bracket to the rear fork ends. The <b>seat</b> <b>stays</b> connect {{the top of the}} seat tube (often at or near the same point as the top tube) to the rear fork ends.|$|R

25|$|Combining {{different}} {{materials can}} provide the desired stiffness, compliance, or damping in different areas better than can be accomplished with a single material. The combined materials are usually carbon fiber and a metal, either steel, aluminum, or titanium. One implementation of this approach includes a metal down tube and chain stays with carbon top tube, seat tube, and <b>seat</b> <b>stays.</b> Another is a metal main triangle and chain stays with just carbon <b>seat</b> <b>stays.</b>|$|R

His father, a lawyer, and mother, a unionized teacher with a blue-collar background, held liberal values and taught him to abide by the Golden Rule.

5000|$|On most upright bicycles, {{the chain}} loops through the right rear {{triangle}} {{made by the}} right chain stay and seat tube. Thus a chain must be separated, (or [...] "broken" [...] ) unless the triangle can be split (usually the <b>seat</b> <b>stay).</b> Chain can either be broken with a chain tool or at a master link. A master link, {{also known as a}} connecting link, allows the chain to be inserted or removed with simpler tools, or even no tools, for cleaning or replacement.|$|E

In the Giro d'Italia, Vicini won 3 stages, and finished third in 1939.He later went on to build racing bicycles, simply named [...] "Vicini", using top of the line components.
