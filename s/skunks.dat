5|$|Birds in the Buffalo Creek {{watershed}} include raptors, waterfowl, songbirds, {{and wild}} turkeys. Mammals in the watershed include rodents, foxes, raccoons, opossums, <b>skunks,</b> white-tailed deer, and black bears. The colder streams in the watershed contain brook trout and brown trout, while the warmer streams contain suckers and smallmouth bass.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, {{poisonous}} or distasteful {{animals that}} advertise their presence with warning coloration (aposematism) use patterns that emphasize rather than disrupt their outlines. For example, <b>skunks,</b> salamanders and monarch butterflies all have high-contrast patterns that display their outlines.|$|E
5|$|Most desert {{animals are}} nocturnal, or mainly active at night. Nocturnal {{behavior}} is an adaptation to both predation and hot summer daytime temperatures. Nocturnal animals at Craters of the Moon include woodrats (also called packrats), <b>skunks,</b> foxes, bobcats, mountain lions, bats, nighthawks, owls, {{and most other}} small desert rodents.|$|E
50|$|<b>Skunk</b> {{also called}} <b>Skunk</b> #1 is a Cannabis sativa and Cannabis indica hybrid strain. The parents of <b>Skunk</b> are Afghani, Acapulco Gold, and Colombian Gold. <b>Skunk</b> was created through an {{selective}} breeding process that spanned several generations. <b>Skunk</b> buds have anearthy smell. <b>Skunk</b> typically has a 14 to 15% THC concentration.|$|R

5|$|Many {{poisonous}} or distasteful {{animals that}} advertise their presence with warning coloration (aposematism) use patterns that emphasize rather than disrupt their outlines. For example, <b>skunks,</b> salamanders and monarch butterflies all have high contrast patterns that display their outlines. These advertising patterns exploit the opposite principle to disruptive coloration, {{for what is}} in effect the exactly opposite effect: to make the animal as conspicuous as possible.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species of}} plants are found {{throughout}} {{the middle and upper}} basin, including California poppy, white alder, Oregon ash, oak, poison oak, bigleaf maple, Indian rhubarb, buttonbush, willow, whiteleaf manzanita, and historically, sugar pine, before heavy logging in the late 19th century. Squirrels, raccoon, jackrabbits, bats, <b>skunks,</b> beavers, mule deer, coyote, bobcat and black bear are among the mammal species found in the middle and upper watershed.|$|E
5|$|Other notable mammal {{species in}} the zoo's {{collection}} include oriental small-clawed otters, Asian lions, meerkats, sun bears, Sumatran tigers, giant anteaters, binturong, African wild dogs, Gr√©vy's zebras, greater one-horned rhinoceros, banteng, red river hogs, swamp wallabies, striped <b>skunks,</b> pygmy hippopotamus, Scottish wild cats, Malayan tapirs, white-faced saki monkeys, ring-tailed lemurs, cottontop tamarins, geladas, chinese gorals, red panda, Siberian musk deer, Nile lechwe, grey kangaroo and Barbary macaques.|$|E
5000|$|Mammalogists {{consider}} S. gracilis and S. putorius {{different species}} because {{of differences in}} reproductive patterns, reproductive morphology, and chromosomal variation. However, interbreeding has never been falsified. The name Spilogale comes from the Greek word spilo, which means [...] "spotted", and gale, which means [...] "weasel". Putorius is the Latin word for [...] "fetid odor". Gracilis is the Latin word for [...] "slender". Several other names attributed to S. putorius include: civet cat, polecat, hydrophobian <b>skunk,</b> phoby <b>skunk,</b> phoby cat, tree <b>skunk,</b> weasel <b>skunk,</b> black marten, little spotted <b>skunk,</b> four-lined <b>skunk,</b> four-striped <b>skunk,</b> and sachet kitty.|$|R
50|$|<b>Skunk</b> is a Cannabis sativa and Cannabis indica hybrid strain. Named <b>Skunk</b> due to {{it being}} {{similar to the}} smell of the spray from a <b>skunk.</b> <b>Skunk</b> was bred by Sacred Seed Company and the parents of <b>Skunk</b> are Afghani, Acapulco Gold, and Colombian Gold. Just as with other strains of cannabis, <b>skunk</b> is {{commonly}} grown in controlled indoor environments under specialized grow lights, or in a greenhouse when full outdoor conditions are not suitable.|$|R
50|$|The eastern hog-nosed <b>skunk</b> {{is found}} only in Southern Texas, Veracruz, Mexico, and ArizonaThe Molina hog-nosed <b>skunk,</b> also known as Andes <b>skunk,</b> (C. chinga) is found in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Peru, and Uruguay. Humboldt's hog-nosed <b>skunk,</b> also known as Patagonian hog-nosed <b>skunk</b> (C. humboldtii) finds its habitat in the open grassy areas in the Patagonian regions of Chile and Argentina. The western hog-nosed <b>skunk</b> (C. mesoleucus) is found in, Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, Sierra Guadalupe, Coahuila, Colima, Honduras, Sonora, and Nicaragua. The striped hog-nosed <b>skunk,</b> C. semistriatus is found in Veracruz, Costa Rica, and Guatemala.|$|R
5|$|The area {{contains}} multiple {{species of}} wildlife, {{both in the}} federal lands {{at the southern end}} of the peninsula (managed in part as an ecological reserve) and in the developed suburban areas. Mammals include raccoons, <b>skunks,</b> possums, bats, rabbits, California ground squirrels, gray foxes, and occasional coyotes. More than 300 species of birds have been observed in Point Loma, which lies on the Pacific Flyway migration route.|$|E
5|$|Vertebrates {{including}} {{several species of}} frog put on warning displays; some of these species have poison glands. Among the mammals, deimatic displays are found in species with strong defences, such as in foul-smelling <b>skunks</b> and spiny porcupines. Such displays are often combined with warning coloration. Thus these displays in both frogs and mammals are {{at least in part}} aposematic.|$|E
5|$|A host of {{different}} animals, including snapping turtles, snake {{species such as}} Nerodia sipedon and Thamnophis sirtalis, muskrats, striped <b>skunks,</b> foxes, dogs, and raccoons prey upon the bog turtle. In addition, leeches (Placobdella multilineata and P. parasitica) and parasitic flies (Cistudinomyia cistudinis) plague some individuals, causing blood loss and weakness. Their shells offer little protection from predators. The bog turtle's main defense when threatened by an animal is to bury itself in soft mud. It rarely defends its territory or bites when approached.|$|E
50|$|The {{southern}} spotted <b>skunk</b> (Spilogale angustifrons) is {{a species}} of mammal in the <b>skunk</b> family, (Mephitidae). It ranges from Costa Rica to southern Mexico. At one time this <b>skunk</b> {{was considered to be}} a subspecies of the eastern spotted <b>skunk</b> (Spigale pusorius).|$|R

5000|$|Jane Bone's <b>Skunk</b> Stuff {{describes}} {{a diet of}} vegetables, fruits, dairy, yogurt, vitamins and minerals, fiber, carbohydrates, and eggs. [...] <b>Skunk</b> Haven disagrees with this diet, and recommends their own sample diet. [...] <b>Skunk</b> expert Mary Kaye Ashley, {{as well as the}} American Domestic <b>Skunk</b> Association, Inc. also disagree with this diet.|$|R
5|$|Its wild creatures include black bear, bobcat, Mexican wolves, elk, Gila monsters, coyotes, rattlesnakes, cougars, <b>skunks,</b> and red foxes, {{as well as}} cranes, golden eagle, red-tailed hawk, {{and great}} horned owls. In keeping with Navajo tradition, none of the zoo's birds were {{captured}} {{for the purpose of}} being exhibited, but were rather rescued after sustaining injuries from vehicles or electrical lines and are thus unable to fly; the majority of the other specimens are also non-releasable and unable to survive in the wild due to being orphaned or having been confiscated as illegal pets from their former owners.|$|E
5|$|Painted turtles {{are most}} {{vulnerable}} to predators when young. Nests are frequently ransacked and the eggs eaten by garter snakes, crows, chipmunks, thirteen-lined ground and gray squirrels, <b>skunks,</b> groundhogs, raccoons, badgers, gray and red fox, and humans. The small and sometimes bite-size, numerous hatchlings fall prey to water bugs, bass, catfish, bullfrogs, snapping turtles, three types of snakes (copperheads, racers and water snakes), herons, rice rats, weasels, muskrats, minks, and raccoons. As adults, the turtles' armored shells protect them from many potential predators, but they still occasionally fall prey to alligators, ospreys, crows, red-shouldered hawks, bald eagles, and especially raccoons.|$|E
5|$|The Shasta-Trinity National Forest {{encompasses}} {{nearly the}} entire Trinity River watershed {{with the exception of}} private inholdings and the small area in Humboldt County. Large mammals found in the national forest include black bear, mountain lion, bobcat, coyote, gray fox, Columbian black-tailed deer (mule deer), and elk. River otters inhabit most streams. Other mammals include ringtails, raccoons, <b>skunks,</b> jackrabbits, martens and many squirrel and rat species including northern flying squirrel. Several species of bats are also found in the watershed, little brown bats being the most common. The area around Trinity Lake has a significant nesting bald eagle population.|$|E

5|$|The {{reverse of}} countershading, with the belly {{pigmented}} {{darker than the}} back, enhances contrast and so makes animals more conspicuous. It is found in animals that can defend themselves, such as <b>skunks.</b> The pattern is used both in startle or deimatic displays and as a signal to warn off experienced predators. However, animals that habitually live upside-down but lack strong defences, like the Nile catfish and the luna moth caterpillar, have upside-down countershading for camouflage.|$|E
5|$|Loggerheads have {{numerous}} predators, especially {{early in}} their lives. Egg and nestling predators include ghost crabs, oligochaete worms, beetles, fly larvae, ants, parasitoid wasp larvae, flesh flies, snakes, gulls, corvids, opossums, bears, rats, armadillos, mustelids, <b>skunks,</b> canids, procyonids, cats, pigs, and humans. During their migration from their nests to the sea, hatchlings are preyed on by dipteran larvae, crabs, toads, lizards, snakes, seabirds such as frigatebirds, and other assorted birds and mammals. In the ocean, predators of the loggerhead juveniles include fish, such as parrotfish and moray eels, and portunid crabs. Adults are more rarely attacked due to their large size, but may be preyed on by large sharks, seals, and killer whales. Nesting females are attacked by flesh flies, feral dogs, and humans. Salt marsh mosquitos can also pester nesting females.|$|E
5|$|Mallards of {{all ages}} (but {{especially}} young ones) and in all locations must contend with a wide diversity of predators including raptors, mustelids, corvids, snakes, raccoons, opossums, <b>skunks,</b> turtles, large fish, felids, and canids, including domesticated ones. The most prolific natural predators of adult mallards are red foxes (which most often pick off brooding females) and the faster or larger birds of prey, i.e. peregrine falcons, Aquila eagles, or Haliaeetus eagles. In North America, adult mallards face no fewer than 15 species of birds of prey, from northern harriers and short-eared owls (both smaller than a mallard) to huge bald and golden eagles, and about a dozen species of mammalian predator, not counting several more avian and mammalian predators who threaten eggs and nestlings.|$|E
5000|$|Recent {{work has}} {{concluded}} that the western hog-nosed <b>skunk</b> or common hog-nosed <b>skunk</b> (formerly Conepatus mesoleucus) is the same species as the American hog-nosed <b>skunk,</b> and that Conepatus leuconotus is the correct name of the merged populations. [...] This species of hog-nosed <b>skunk</b> is native from the southwestern United States (Arizona to southern Texas) south through Mexico to Nicaragua. In Texas, it {{is commonly known as}} the rooter <b>skunk</b> for its habit of rooting and overturning rocks and debris in search of food.|$|R

5|$|Many animals prey on marsh rice rats. The {{barn owl}} (Tyto alba) {{is among the}} most important; one study found that 97.5% of {{vertebrate}} remains in barn owl pellets were marsh rice rats. Other predators include birds (marsh hawks, Circus cyaneus; and barred owls, Strix varia), snakes (cottonmouth moccasins, Agkistrodon piscivorus; and others), alligators, and carnivorans (raccoons, Procyon lotor; red foxes, Vulpes vulpes; minks, Neovison vison; weasels of the genus Mustela; and striped <b>skunks,</b> Mephitis mephitis). Many parasites have been recorded on the marsh rice rat, including various ticks and mites, lice, and fleas among external parasites and many nematodes and digeneans, a pentastomid, and several coccidians among internal parasites (see parasites of the marsh rice rat).|$|E
5|$|Some {{plants are}} thought to employ aposematism to warn herbivores of {{unpalatable}} chemicals or physical defences such as prickled leaves or thorns. Many insects, such as cinnabar moth caterpillars, acquire toxic chemicals from their host plants. Among mammals, <b>skunks</b> and zorillas advertise their foul-smelling chemical defences with sharply contrasting black-and-white patterns on their fur, while the similarly-patterned badger and honey badger advertise their sharp claws, powerful jaws, and aggressive natures. Some brightly coloured birds such as passerines with contrasting patterns may also be aposematic, at least in females; but since male birds are often brightly coloured through sexual selection, and their colouration is not correlated with edibility, {{it is unclear whether}} aposematism is significant.|$|E
5|$|After metamorphosis, {{young adults}} may {{disperse}} into terrestrial habitats or {{continue to live}} in water. Almost all frog species are carnivorous as adults, preying on invertebrates, including arthropods, worms, snails, and slugs. A few of the larger ones may eat other frogs, small mammals, and fish. Some frogs use their sticky tongues to catch fast-moving prey, while others push food into their mouths with their hands. A few species also eat plant matter; the tree frog Xenohyla truncata is partly herbivorous, its diet including a large proportion of fruit, Leptodactylus mystaceus has been found to eat plants, and folivory occurs in Euphlyctis hexadactylus, with plants constituting 79.5% of its diet by volume. Adult frogs are themselves attacked by many predators. The northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens) is eaten by herons, hawks, fish, large salamanders, snakes, raccoons, <b>skunks,</b> mink, bullfrogs, and other animals.|$|E
