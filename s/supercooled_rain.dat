25|$|Gardermoen has had {{considerable}} problems with fog and freezing rain, and has several times had a complete close-down. This {{was also a}} problem at Fornebu, and reported to be at Hurum as well. On average there is super cooled rain three times per month during the winter. The use of deicing fluids is restricted since the area underneath the airport contains the Tandrum Delta, one of the country's largest uncontained quaternary aquifers (underground water systems). On 14 December 1998, a combination of freezing fog and <b>supercooled</b> <b>rain</b> caused glaze at Gardermoen. At least twenty aircraft engines were damaged by ice during take-off, and five aircraft needed to make precautionary landings with only one working engine. On 18 January 2006, an Infratek deicing system was set up, that uses infrared heat in large hangar tents. It was hoped that it could reduce chemical deicers by 90%, but the technique has proved unsuccessful.|$|E
50|$|In {{the morning}} of 14 December 1998, a {{combination}} of freezing fog and <b>supercooled</b> <b>rain</b> caused severe glaze at Gardermoen. At least 20 aircraft engines were damaged by ice during take-off, and five aircraft needed to make precautionary landings with only one working engine. A similar incident took place in Denver International Airport on 31 October 2002.|$|E
50|$|Freezing rain {{develops}} when {{falling snow}} encounters {{a layer of}} warm air aloft, typically around the 800 mbar (800 hPa) level, causing the snow to melt and become rain. As the rain continues to fall, it passes through a layer of subfreezing air just above the surface and cools to a temperature below freezing (0 C). If this layer of subfreezing air is sufficiently deep, the raindrops may have time to freeze into ice pellets (sleet) before reaching the ground. However, if the subfreezing layer of air at the surface is very shallow, the rain drops falling through it will {{not have time to}} freeze and they will hit the ground as <b>supercooled</b> <b>rain.</b> When these supercooled drops make contact with the ground, power lines, tree branches, aircraft, or anything else below 0 C, a portion of the drops instantly freezes, forming a thin film of ice, hence freezing rain.|$|E
50|$|Snow is {{produced}} at upper levels {{in such a}} winter storm system, but it eventually melts into rain as it falls through a warm air layer of above freezing temperature (of at least 1200 ft in depth) associated with the overrunning. The rain passes through colder air near the surface and <b>supercools.</b> When that <b>rain</b> touches the ground or any other cold surface in the cold air below, the droplets freeze on contact, creating accumulations of ice. If the cold air layer is too thick, the droplets refreeze before hitting the ground and form ice pellets, which are usually less hazardous.|$|R
40|$|Oil and gas {{activities}} in the cold seas are endangered by icing. Icing may occur when water spray or moisture is deposited on a vessel or offshore structure above sea level and the air temperatures is below the freezing temperature of water. Ice accumulation can block rescue equipment and doors, and clog ventilation systems, which may {{increase the risk of}} explosion as result of volatile gas accumulation. Icing can be caused by <b>supercooled</b> fog, freezing <b>rain,</b> falling snow and freezing sea spray. The freezing sea spray caused 80 – 90 % of all offshore icing incidents and is the focus of this study. To take precautions against icing, {{it is important to understand}} the physics of icing and to model it. The rate of ice accretion is mainly defined by the spray flux and heat transfer, and both must be accurately predicted. Existing icing models, e. g., ICEMOD and RIGICE 04, simplify the structure, subdividing it into cylindrical and flat components. In these models, airflow around a component is assumed to be unaffected by other parts of the structure, and the heat transfer is approximated using empirical relations. In reality, however, the airflow field is complex. Upwind components can create wind shadow regions or regions of accelerated flow in front of downwind components; this changes both the spray flux and the heat transfer, thus making ICEMOD and RIGICE 04 inadequate. A research subject of this PhD study was the heat transfer and spray flow around a structure in a real airflow. The full-scale measurements in the literature are limited and it is expensive to perform them. Therefore, for a preliminary answer the question was addressed using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), which is capable of predicting the spray flow and heat transfer around a structure with any shape; however, the accuracy of CFD is uncertain. Existing models of sea spray icing, e. g., ICEMOD and RIGICE 04, neglect heat flux into the accreted ice and assume that air cooling is directly spent to freeze the water film on the ice surface. This assumption is good for steady ice growth. However, it is also used in modelling icing caused by periodic sea spray. This study proves numerically and experimentally that the heat flux into the accreted ice generated by freezing must not be neglected. The main contributions of this work are as follows: The study develops the marine icing model, MARICE, which uses CFD to calculate spray flux and heat transfer, and models water film motion on any arbitrary surface. · The study shows that Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models should be used with care in icing simulations: the collision efficiency is well predicted upstream flow separation point by any RANS turbulence model; however, the wake and separation of the flow is modelled poorly. · The study develops and validates a new model of ice growth caused by periodic sea spray, which accounts for the heat conduction inside the accreted ice...|$|R

50|$|Since its opening, Gardermoen has had {{considerable}} problems with fog and freezing rain, causing complete close-down a few times. It {{is hard to}} avoid fog in Norway, and the old airport Fornebu and the alternative airport location Hurum also has fog (at least as much since these two places are near the sea shore, which Gardermoen is not). Gardermoen {{is reported to have}} more problems with <b>supercooled</b> <b>rain,</b> which reportedly occurs on average three times a month during winter on Gardermoen, according to meteorological stats gathered since the 1950s. The use of deicing fluids is restricted since the area underneath the airport contains one of the nation's largest uncontained quaternary aquifers (underground water systems), the Trandum delta.In January 2006 an Infratek deicing system was set up, using infrared heat in large hangar tents. It was hoped that the method would decrease the use of chemical deicers by 90%, but as of February 2007 the technique was still unsuccessful.|$|E
40|$|Two rapidly growing, hail-producing storms {{observed}} in Alabama during the Microburst and Severe Thun-derstorm project in 1986 were examined: the well-studied single-cell storm case on 20 July 1986 {{and a single}} cell within a multicellular storm on 6 July 1986. Both storms are examples of extremely efficient accretional growth processes that produced hail within 10 min. A simple hydrometeor classification algorithm based on multiparameter radar data was used to identify regions within the rain and snow portions of the storm volumes that included hail, graupel, and <b>supercooled</b> <b>rain.</b> By comparing {{the results of the}} simple hydrometeor classification algorithm to previous polarimetric analysis and modeling of the 20 July 1986 storm by other authors, the hydrometeor classification methodology for the 6 July 1986 storm was indirectly validated. The microphysical development of hail and graupel was similar for both the single isolated cell storm and a cell within a multicellular storm. Rapid coalescence within updrafts with high liquid water contents quickly produced precipitation-sized drops that were lofted above the 08 C level and subsequently froze. These frozen drops became hail and graupel embryos and continued to grow by accretion. <b>Supercooled</b> <b>rain</b> was present only in the earliest stages of cell evolution lasting 8 – 12 min and extending 1 – 2 km above the 08 C level. Hail and graupel appeared several minutes after the first appearance of <b>supercooled</b> <b>rain.</b> Graupel was present at highe...|$|E
40|$|The {{article of}} record as {{published}} {{may be found}} at: [URL] aircraft measurements of aerosol chemical and cloud microphysical properties were conducted during the CalWater campaign in February and March 2011 over the Sierra Nevada Mountains and the coastal waters of central California. The main objective was to elucidate the impacts of aerosol properties on clouds and precipitation forming processes. In order to accomplish this, we compared contrasting cases of clouds that ingested aerosols from different sources. The results showed that clouds containing pristine oceanic air had low cloud drop concentrations and started to develop rain 500 m above their base. This occurred both over the ocean and over the Sierra Nevada, mainly {{in the early morning}} when the radiatively cooled stable continental boundary layerwas decoupled fromthe cloud base. <b>Supercooled</b> <b>rain</b> dominated the precipitation that formed in growing convective clouds in the pristine air, up to the − 21 °C isotherm level. A contrasting situation was documented in the afternoon over the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, when the clouds ingested high pollution aerosol concentrations produced in the Central Valley. This led to slow growth of the cloud drop effective radius with height and suppressed and even prevented the initiation of warm rain while contributing to the development of ice hydrometeors in the form of graupel. Our results show that cloud condensation and ice nuclei were the limiting factors that controlled warm rain and ice processes, respectively,while the unpolluted clouds in the same air mass produced precipitation quite efficiently. These findings provide the motivation for deeper investigations into the nature of the aerosols seeding clouds...|$|E
40|$|The {{article of}} record as {{published}} {{may be found}} at [URL] <b>supercooled</b> <b>rain</b> and drizzle from cloud tops at 12 to 21 C down to the 0 isotherm was documented by aircraft observations in clouds {{over a wide range}} of meteorological situations under relatively pristine marine aerosol conditions. The Gulfstream- 1 aircraft during the CalWater campaign in February and early March 2011 measured clouds over the coastal waters of northern California, orographically triggered convective clouds over the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, and orographic layer clouds over Yosemite National Park. Supercooled drizzle in layer clouds near Juneau, Alaska, was measured by the Wyoming King Air as part of a FAA project to study aircraft icing in this region. Low concentrations of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) were commonly observed in all of these clouds, allowing for the formation of clouds with small concentrations of mostly large drops that coalesced into supercooled drizzle and raindrops. Another common observation was the absence of ice nuclei (IN) and/or ice crystals in measurable concentrations, associated with persistent supercooled drizzle and rain. Average ice crystal concentrations were 0. 007 l 1 at the top of convective clouds at 12 C and 0. 03 l 1 in the case of layer clouds at 21 C. In combination, these two conditions of low concentrations of CCN and very few IN provide ideal conditions for the formation of highly supercooled drizzle and rain. These results help explain the anomalously high incidences of aircraft icing at cold temperatures in U. S. west coast clouds and highlight the need to include aerosol effects when simulating aircraft icing with cloud models. California Energy CommissionU. S.
