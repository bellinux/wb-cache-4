40|$|International audienceEcosystem {{management}} {{is a difficult}} task because it must conciliate the ecological, economic, and social dimensions of socioecological systems. In those systems, the action of any single component can {{have an effect on}} the others and result in a critical impact on the organization of the entire system. This study examined the collaboration networks among <b>stockmen</b> within two traditionally agropastoral regions in the Spanish Central Pyrenees, which in the past 30 yr included touristic activities: one under the influence of a national park and centered on ecotourism and the other in a region where there are ski resorts and local <b>stockmen</b> have turned to snow tourism. Our hypotheses were that economic regime affects the structure of the networks, and the type of collaboration (e. g., for economic reasons) influences the collaborations among <b>stockmen.</b> We built <b>stockmen</b> collaboration networks by connecting breeders within the same pastoral partnerships and calculated the importance of collaborations (links density), the occurrence of collaborative subgroups (network modularity), and the existence of collaborations between <b>stockmen</b> in different regions (Krackhardt Ratio). In addition, we identified the distribution of links among types of pastoral partnerships. The network under the influence of the National Park presented higher link density and modularity than did the network influenced by ski resorts, where the presence of nonlocal <b>stockmen</b> is higher. Furthermore, economic partnerships played a major role connecting <b>stockmen.</b> In the study area, differences in the collaboration networks between the two regions suggest that changes in the economic trend in the past 30 yr has influenced the collaborative structure of the <b>stockmen.</b> We discuss possible reasons behind these differences and propose some recommendations that could help to strengthen the collaborative bounds between <b>stockmen</b> in the area.

The genus Condrusia includes 3 species: C rumex <b>Stockmans,</b> C. minor <b>Stockmans</b> and C. brevis Petrosjan. C rumex was described by <b>Stockmans</b> in 1948, who provided a diagnosis and illustrations, but failed to designate a holotype.

25|$|Long a seeker in religion, when he {{was nearly}} 50 he joined the Bahá'í Faith in 1894-5 –almost as soon as {{possible}} in America– and is commonly recognized as the first convert to the religion of the western world. After having organized concerts and businesses in his earlier days, he advanced the organization of communities of the religion especially in Chicago and Los Angeles, serving on early assemblies and publishing committees, the first national attempts at circulating news and guidance for the religion, and an elected national council. He also aided in the founding of other communities, gave talks for the religion in many places including Greenacre in Eliot, Maine, in the northeast and Seattle in the northwest, and authored early books on the religion including an account of his Bahá'í pilgrimage in 1907 and an introductory review of the religion in 1909. During his journeys to the West, `Abdu'l-Bahá, then head of the religion, singled Chase out and identified his gravesite as a place of religious visitation. Ultimately Chase was named a Disciple of `Abdu'l-Bahá. Collections of his papers began, posthumous articles by him were published, biographical articles about him appeared and his place {{in the history of the}} religion in America was contextualized. In 2002 a full biography on Chase was published by Robert H. <b>Stockman</b> and websites have had entries about him since.|$|E
