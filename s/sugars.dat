This process is dependent upon microbial consortia that transform the cellulose into <b>sugars,</b> followed by the fermentation of the <b>sugars</b> into ethanol.

5|$|The World Health Organization {{recommends}} that both {{adults and children}} reduce the intake of free <b>sugars</b> to less than 10% of total energy intake.

50|$|<b>Sugar</b> cane tolerates hot climates better, but the {{production}} of <b>sugar</b> cane needs approximately {{four times as much}} water as {{the production}} of <b>sugar</b> beet, therefore some countries that traditionally produced cane <b>sugar</b> (such as Egypt) have built new beet <b>sugar</b> factories since about 2008.

The 2008 Georgia sugar refinery explosion, which killed 14 people and injured 40, and destroyed most of the refinery, {{was caused by the}} ignition of sugar dust. In its culinary use, sugar that is exposed to a heat source causes caramelization to take place.
