5|$|Despite the {{additional}} expense involved in re-shooting many {{portions of the}} film, Himanshu Rai replaced Najm-ul-Hassan with Ashok Kumar, who was the brother of Sashadhar Mukherjee's wife, as the hero of Jeevan Naiya. This marked the debut, improbable as it may seem, of Ashok Kumar's five-decade-long career in Hindi films. Najm-ul-Hassan was dismissed from his job at Bombay Talkies (this was {{the period in which}} actors and actresses were paid regular monthly salaries by one <b>specific</b> <b>film</b> studio and could not work in any other studio). His reputation as a dangerous cad established, he could not find work in any other studio. His career was ruined and he sank into obscurity.|$|E

Some nominations were announced without reference to a <b>specific</b> <b>film,</b> such as for Ralph Hammeras and Nugent Slaughter, who received nominations in the now defunct category of Engineering Effects. Unlike later ceremonies, an actor could be awarded for multiple works within a calendar year for the same category. Emil Jannings, for example, was given the Best Actor award for his work in both The Way of All Flesh and The Last Command. Moreover, Charlie Chaplin and Warner Brothers each received an Honorary Award.|$|E
25|$|The Big Six major {{studios are}} today {{primarily}} backers and distributors of films whose actual production is largely handled by independent companies—either long-running entities or ones created for and {{dedicated to the}} making of a <b>specific</b> <b>film.</b> The specialty divisions often simply acquire distribution rights to pictures in which the studio has had no prior involvement. While the majors still do a modicum of true production, their activities are focused more in the areas of development, financing, marketing, and merchandising. Those business functions are still usually performed in or near Los Angeles, even though the runaway production phenomenon means that most films are now mostly or completely shot on location at places outside Los Angeles.|$|E

Thanhouser's musical scores were an exception in 1914, but the scores would only be created for the [...] "Thanhouser Big Productions" [...] such as Joseph in the Land of Egypt. In 1913 and 1914, cue sheets or musical suggestions could be obtained inexpensively through various industry sources and retained their dominance. Given that these cue sheets were prepared without any <b>specific</b> <b>film</b> in mind, the music would be chosen to match the themes of the film. The film was shot on one reel by the Thanhouser Company, [...] in total. It was shot in standard 35mm and a spherical 1.37:1 format.

500|$|Having {{been hired}} by Beam's parent company Melbourne House, fantasy and sci-fi writer Paul Kidd quickly took Barnett's place as lead designer. According to Kidd, the given {{timeframe}} for finishing Shadowrun for publisher Data East was very short, forcing the team to complete production in a tumultuous {{five and a half}} to six months. An avid role-player, Kidd was already familiar with the Shadowrun license, but had to utilize the storyline that his predecessor had already gotten approved. Aspects of Beam's earlier action-adventure game Nightshade, of which Kidd was the writer, director and lead designer, were used as a basis for Shadowrun; <b>specific</b> <b>film</b> noir components such as [...] "dark cityscapes, dialogue-heavy exchanges, and touches of humor" [...] were adapted directly from the former to the latter. To coincide with the last of these qualities, Kidd and programmer Jeff Kamenek altered the original [...] "serious" [...] tone of Shadowrun by replacing portions of the script and artwork with more comedic elements. According to Kidd, [...] "we made improvements and changes, but the basic concepts were pretty much the same [...]" ...|$|E
