50|$|The MBBR system {{consists}} of an aeration tank (similar to a activated <b>sludge</b> <b>tank)</b> with special plastic carriers that provide a surface where a biofilm can grow. The carriers are made of a material with a density close to the density of water (1 g/cm3). An example is high-density polyetylene (HDPE) which has a density close to 0.95 g/cm3. The carriers will be mixed in the tank by the aeration system and thus will have good contact between the substrate in the influent wastewater and the biomass on the carriers.|$|E
5000|$|Continuous foam {{separation}} {{is used in}} wastewater treatment to remove detergent-derived foaming agents such as ABS, which became common in wastewater by the 1950s. [...] In 1959 it was shown that by adding 2-octane to foamed wastewater, 94% of ABS could {{be removed from the}} activated sludge through using {{foam separation}} techniques. [...] The foam produced during wastewater treatment can either be recycled back into the activated <b>sludge</b> <b>tank</b> within a waste treatment plant, the bacterial organisms that live there have been found to break down ABS when allowed enough time, or extracted and collapsed for disposal. [...] Foam separation has also been found to decrease the chemical oxygen demand when used as secondary treatment technique for wastewater.|$|E
5000|$|Due to a {{locomotive}} shortage {{because of the}} planned replacement of AN Tasrails English Electric locomotive fleet, twelve DQs and three QRs were sold to the company. DQs 6007, 6330, 6353 and QR 3032, along with eight 1460 class locomotives, were sold to Tasrail. The three DQs were modified for service in Tasmania, while QR 3032 had its short-hood lowered as a DQ. The eight 1460s were fully rebuilt as DQs, with some being undergoing rebuilding when they were sold. Originally the three QRs were on a one year lease, but were later sold. The modifications made to the units were changing the drawgear back to the originally Queensland Railways standard height, increasing the fuel tank capacity, relocate the battery boxes, installation of a <b>sludge</b> <b>tank</b> and engine room sump pan, fitting of the [...] "Kaitiaki" [...] vigilance, fitting of ZTR electronic anti-wheelslip technology and upgrading dynamic brakes.

5000|$|All OWS equipment, new or old, can, in a {{laboratory}} setting, separate oil and water, do so automatically, and produce clean water for discharge overboard that contains no more than 15 parts per million oil. OWS equipment is approved by testing it with specific cocktails of mixed oil and water. Initially these combinations were very simple, basically {{no more than a}} mixture of clean water and diesel fuel, but they have become more sophisticated under MARPOL MEPC 107(49). The vast majority of these many equipment models, manufacturers, and types start with some sort of gravity separation of bilge water. Simply letting oil and water sit is called decanting, and this does not always meet the 15 ppm criterion, which is why each manufacturer has added additional features to his equipment to ensure that this criterion can be met. The separation that takes place inside the OWS allows oil that floats to the top to be automatically skimmed off to a <b>sludge</b> <b>tank</b> or dirty oil holding tank.

50|$|Fine bubble {{diffusers}} {{have largely}} replaced coarse bubble diffusers and mechanical aerators {{in most of}} the developed world and in much of the developing world. The exception would be in secondary treatment phases, such as activated <b>sludge</b> processing <b>tanks,</b> where 85 to 90 percent of any remaining solid materials (floating on the surface) are removed through settling or biological processes. The biological process uses air to encourage bacterial growth that would consume many of these waste materials, such as phosphorus and nitrogen that are dissolved in the wastewater. The larger air release openings of a coarse bubble diffuser helps to facilitate a higher oxygen transfer rate and bacterial growth. One disadvantage of using fine bubble diffusers in activated <b>sludge</b> <b>tanks</b> is the tendency of floc (particle) clogging the small air release holes.|$|R
50|$|Aerobic {{digestion}} {{can also}} be achieved by using diffuser systems or jet aerators to oxidize the sludge. Fine bubble diffusers are typically the more cost-efficient diffusion method, however, plugging is typically a problem due to sediment settling into the smaller air holes. Coarse bubble diffusers are more commonly used in activated <b>sludge</b> <b>tanks</b> or in the flocculation stages. A key component for selecting diffuser type is to ensure it will produce the required oxygen transfer rate.|$|R

40|$|The {{concentrations}} of organic micropollutants are usually low in wastewaters (order of magnitude of mg L− 1). However, their emission standards, {{especially in the}} case of carcinogenic and bioaccumulating substances, are often much lower (order of magnitude of μg L− 1). Since these substances, in some cases, can be adsorbable or volatile, their removal via volatilization, biodegradation or sludge adsorption in a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) becomes a significant feature to include in the usual design process, in order to verify the emission standards in gas and sludge too. In this study a simple screening batch test for the evaluation of the fate of organic micropollutants in water, air and sludge is presented. The test is set up by means of simple laboratory instruments and simulates an activated <b>sludge</b> <b>tank</b> process. In this study the results obtained for four substances with different chemical properties (i. e. toluene, benz(a) anthracene, phenol and benzene) are presented. The screening test proposed can be a useful tool to assess in about one month the fate of organic micropollutants in an activated <b>sludge</b> <b>tank</b> of a WWTP.

40|$|Emerging organic micropollutants are {{compounds}} {{measured in}} water in μg/l or ng/l {{which may have}} long-term negative effects on both wildlife and humans. The purpose of this work was to perform a mass balance of emerging organic micropollutants on activated <b>sludge</b> <b>tank</b> and on secondary settling tank in a small wastewater treatment plant in the Municipality of Rome. The analytes monitored in this work were: Estrone (E 1), 17 β-Estradiol (E 2) and 17 α- Ethinylestradiol (EE 2) for steroid hormones, 4 -Nonylphenol (4 -NP) and Bisphenol A (BPA) for substituted Phenols and Alkylphenols, Amphetamine (AM), Methamphetamine (MET), Benzoylecgonine (BEG) and 11 -nor-Δ 9 -THC- 9 carboxy (THC-COOH) for drugs of abuse. Mass balance on activated <b>sludge</b> <b>tank</b> showed that the emerging organic micropollutants removed were BPA (59 %), EE 2 (34 %), AM (56 %) and THCCOOH (35 %). The processes occurring in the secondary settling tank were able to reduce 4 -NP (26 %), BPA (74 %), E 1 (82 %), EE 2 (93 %), AM (44 %), MET (80 %), BEG (72 %) and THC-COOH (39 %). The residual amount of each substance was distributed between the effluent, the return sludge line and the excess sludge. Since the removal of emerging organic micropollutants was partial, the conventional wastewater treatment plant {{is not able to}} completely break down these substances.

30|$|The maximum TMP {{value that}} {{indicated}} {{a need for}} chemical cleaning was dependent on the start-up pressure, because depending on location of pumps, etc., the start-up pressure could be different from application to application. Hence, a decision must be asserted on the TMP. In our operation, if the pressure increases to approximately 300  mbar, a chemical cleaning cycle was performed. The rotating VRM plates of the MBR system were cleaned chemically after 101  days of operation. The cleaning process occurred in situ without removal of the plate module. The activated sludge was drained outside the VRM chamber. The filter driving motor operated continuously to apply water on the membrane, ensuring the membrane remained wet. Next, the chamber was filled with approximately 500  ppm of sodium hypochlorite solution until the membrane was completely immersed in the solution. The operation continued for several hours with the filter driving motor and scoring air blower operating, to allow sufficient reaction time for the chemicals to dissipate the thick sludge. The solution was drained and the chamber was filled with clean water. Thereafter, that water was drained. The cleaning and draining steps may be repeated according to actual applications. Finally, the chamber was filled with activated sludge and the system was returned to regular operation. The plate modules were not cleaned mechanically from the outside. For a large capacity VRM unit, another option would be to perform the cleaning process outside the activated <b>sludge</b> <b>tank</b> using the same cleaning steps, reinstall in the activated <b>sludge</b> <b>tank,</b> and return to normal operation.|$|E

40|$|Treatment and {{disposal}} of excess sludge produced in an activated sludge process has become an environmental challenge in densely populated urban areas due to difficulty to locate suitable sites for landfill and incineration. Therefore, reduction/minimization of excess sludge within activated sludge processes may be an ideal solution. This study focuses {{on the use of}} a modified activated sludge process, named the oxic-settling-anaerobic (OSA) system, to achieve an effective reduction in excess sludge production. Its key feature is to insert a <b>sludge</b> holding <b>tank</b> in the <b>sludge</b> return circuit to provide an anaerobic sludge zone. The objectives of the study are to: 1) demonstrate the excess sludge reduction in an OSA system; 2) evaluate the appropriate operating conditions; and 3) study the mechanisms of excess sludge reduction, so as to maximize the excess sludge reduction efficiency of the OSA system. In continuous-flow studies, an OSA system was operated in parallel with an activated sludge process as a reference system to investigate the effects of the oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) level and the sludge anaerobic exposure time (SAET) in the <b>sludge</b> holding <b>tank</b> on the <b>sludge</b> reduction. The intended level of ORP was maintained by periodical pure nitrogen purging thus preventing the pH drop by chasing the gaseous product in the <b>sludge</b> holding <b>tank.</b> SAET was regulated by changing the pumping rate of the return <b>sludge</b> from settling <b>tank.</b> In batch studies, proposed mechanisms involving soluble microbial products (SMPs) effects, microbial population effects and sludge decay effects were verified. In addition, a COD balance was carried out to supplement the understanding of the mechanisms. The main findings of my research are : 1) the OSA system had a lower sludge yield and oxygen demand than the reference system under the same solids quantity condition, which demonstrated that an OSA system could provide a cost-effective solution for excess sludge reduction; 2) the OSA system improved COD removal efficiency and sludge settleability; 3) a low ORP in the <b>sludge</b> holding <b>tank</b> favored the excess sludge reduction; 4) low sludge growth yield, soluble microbial products (SMPs) effect and microbial predator contribution were unable to explain the excess sludge reduction; and 5) the excess sludge reduction in an OSA system was mainly due to increased sludge decay in the <b>sludge</b> holding <b>tank</b> under an anaerobic condition and the utilization of COD generated from the sludge decay through denitrification, sulfate reduction, phosphorus release and volatile organic gas production that occurred in the <b>sludge</b> holding <b>tank</b> of the OSA system, among which, the contribution of gaseous production was significant.
